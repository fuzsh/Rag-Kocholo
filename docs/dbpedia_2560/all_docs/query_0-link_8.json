Richard had recently moved to Madison, Wisconsin, after retiring from his professorship at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, and had e-mailed Ron that he was in town. Coincidentally, Ron and his sociology colleagues at the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater had just been talking about inviting Richard to speak to a group of criminology students.1 The gods of sociology must have been watching. Our only previous contact had been through a couple of e-mail exchanges we had in 1994 when Ron invited Richard to submit an article to Sociological Imagination, the journal of the Wisconsin Sociological Association, which he was coediting with Bruce Wiegand. In the abstract of that SI article, Richard wrote, “The wonder of human experience is caught in moments of verbal and visual reflection. We tell our stories and we make our images in the course of everyday life. Meaning is given to the lightness of our being; for the record, a visual sociology of human existence” (1994:130). Bruce, who tragically died from a brain tumor in 2002, wrote the “From the Editors” introduction for that SI issue: “Quinney writes in an autobiographical style but never doubt the steel-eyed critique of Western existence that lies just below the surface of the written word.” Richard had been writing autobiography (and about storytelling) for some time. Ron’s work had taken a different turn too; he was working on a life history study of his father’s and uncle’s Holocaust survival that had profound personal meaning in his life, and he was just beginning a project on disability that was inspired by circumstances in his family. After our first chat in the luminous sunroom of Richard’s home, we realized how much we had in common. We agreed to get together again soon. Our conversations often turned to autobiography and biography and to our mutual interest in developing a more self-reflective form of sociology, one that engaged us more fully as human beings rather than as detached theoreticians or researchers. We decided to organize a session for the fall 2002 meeting of the Wisconsin Sociological Association and call it “Memoir as Ethnography.” Nelia Olivencia and Amber Ault joined us on a vii\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\npanel that was well received by the group in attendance. After the conference, we started thinking about how many people we knew who were doing this type of work and decided to explore the idea of an anthology of original articles. We realized that memoir was not the concept we were looking for, and after some thought, we landed on the idea of narrative and storytelling—the idea that lived experience is constructed, at least in part, by the stories people tell about it. We proceeded to tap into our networks of colleagues and friends, among whom were some highly regarded scholars, to inquire about their interest in contributing to the book. We wrote to those who we knew were already doing narrative sociology or who we thought might be interested in taking the narrative turn. We asked them to think about a contribution that would entail writing about their own life experiences or about their location in a research milieu. The response surprised even us. With no more than two degrees of separation from people we already knew, we had more than enough contributors for a book. These writers are primarily sociologists but also include scholars from anthropology, education, literature, social work, and architecture. Researchers who have been involved in class, racial/ethnic, gender, sexual orientation, and disability studies are represented in the book. The organization of the book emerged inductively, as we sought a flexible, sensitizing scheme within which to tell the collective story of the book. We decided on four interrelated themes—Family and Place, The Body, Education and Work, and The Passing of Time—that tell a story about the life course, about the writers’ familial and spatial/temporal roots, about the ways in which the social is embodied in their skin and bones, about their entrances and exits and time spent within various institutional worlds. We no longer write to further our careers, but seek a sociology that is self-reflective and willing to engage the personal, a sociology that refuses to segregate our professional insights from our own lives. We have discovered that we find meaning and solace in the writing and reading of welltold sociological stories. To this end, we hope to advance our vision of a storytelling sociology, our vision of where to take the narrative turn in social inquiry that has engaged many of our colleagues across the disciplinary spectrum of academe. “Seeing our lives as stories is more than a powerful metaphor. It is how experience presents itself to us” (Taylor 2001:4). Tell me a story, the children cry. If we tell them, they will listen.2\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Berger and Richard Quinney\n\nBut in order to make you understand, to tell you my life, I must tell you a story. —Virginia Woolf The remembering makes it now. And sometimes remembering will lead to a story, which makes it forever. That’s what stories are for. Stories are for joining the past to the future. Stories are for those late hours in the night when you can’t remember how you got from where you are. Stories are for eternity, when memory is erased, when there is nothing to remember except the story. —Tim O’Brien What remains of a story after it is finished? Another story.\n\n—Elie Wiesel\n\nOnce upon a time, sociology emerged as a field of scholarly inquiry out of a need to understand the social changes that accompanied the industrialization of society in the nineteenth century. It was born in an intellectual space between positivist science and literary representation, alternatively striving for analytical understanding and practical application, on the one hand, and the conveyance of meaning and empathy, on the other (Gubrium and Holstein 1997; Lepenies 1988; Richardson 1998).\n\nSociology and Its Critique\n\nPositivist sociology advanced a view of the discipline as a value-free enterprise dedicated to the creation of objective, nonideological knowledge derived from scientific observation of empirical reality. 1 In the United 1\n\n2\n\nRonald J. Berger & Richard Quinney\n\nStates (but not in Europe) this disciplinary quest led to the ascendancy of quantitative methods and the “mathematization” of sociology, to use Ben Agger’s (2000) term. Although some of the early classics of American sociology included works in interpretive biography and ethnography,2 and qualitative studies found a secure foothold in the field, quantitative sociology achieved hegemonic status. Rigor of method demarcated the boundary between “real” sociology and impostors. Economics, not the humanities, became the allied field most admired by professional sociologists as they sought to advance their academic careers and persuade university administrators and grant agencies to fund faculty positions and research projects for sociologists. To some extent, even qualitative methods became subject to such constraints, as witnessed in the development of systematic techniques for the coding and transformation of qualitative data into numerical variables that could be analyzed by means of the latest computer software (Neuman 2003). In the postmodern era of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, however, a growing number of sociologists have become disenchanted with the project of positivist sociology. Critics within the discipline have observed that sociology has become so dependent on quantitative instrumentation removed from lived experience that its claim of being an empirical science capable of ascertaining social reality seems rather dubious. The apparent objectivity of quantitative data is belied by the fact that the numbers do not speak for themselves. The meaning of these data is in large part a rhetorical accomplishment, as researchers assert relationships among variables with descriptive terms such as “significant,” “robust,” “stable,” and “predictive” (Agger 2000; Maines 1993). Especially noteworthy for his role in advancing this critique was C. Wright Mills, who observed that sociologists’ preoccupation with method, what he called “abstracted empiricism,” endangered the disappearance of sociology’s subject matter. In The Sociological Imagination, Mills (1959) called for a sociology that grappled with the intersection of biography and history in society and the ways in which personal troubles are related to public issues. This famous dictum, as we shall see, underpins the perspective of this book. Mills was, of course, a man of the political left, and his penetrating analyses of class and power paved the way for an intense engagement with Marxism and socialist ideas among New Left activists and academics in the 1960s. This movement, along with the civil rights, women’s, sexual liberation, and anticolonial movements of that period, pushed the critique of positivist sociology further. New voices were heard as members of previously marginalized groups began speaking their own “truths” about their lives and the world as they saw it. Sociologists were challenged to abandon their faith in value neutrality and seek alliance with these advocates of change.\n\nThe Narrative Turn in Social Inquiry\n\n3\n\nFeminism in particular played a key role in debunking sociology’s privileged knowledge claims. Feminist scholars argued that “truth” is contested and polyvocal and that women’s social position in society gives them distinctive insights, indeed a different epistemological standpoint, from men’s. They advocated a research methodology that would eschew personal detachment and encourage collaboration and empathic connection with research subjects, cross-fertilization among academic disciplines, and involvement in action-oriented research that would facilitate personal and social transformation (Harding 1991; Jaggar 1983; Laslett and Thorne 1997; Reinharz 1992). In the years that followed, intellectual movements variously called poststructuralist, deconstructionist, and most commonly postmodernist launched a provocative philosophical critique of scientific practice as an exercise of power. According to Michel Foucault, a chief figure in this movement, dominant regimes of “truth” construct restrictive criteria for the generation of knowledge and empower institutionalized “experts” with authority to administer knowledge and police heretical practices. In doing so, these regimes also produce a set of inferiorized knowledges, or disciplinary “others,” which though subordinated and marginalized remain historically viable and continuously in revolt (Barrett 1991; Lemert 1997; Seidman 1996). The counterreaction to these critiques and the defense of the status quo have been fierce in some quarters (Huber 1995; see Pierce 2003; Richardson 1996; Sparks 2002). Some consider postmodernism a fad that will eventually pass and are asserting institutionalized authority within doctoral programs, faculty recruitment and retention decisions, and professional publication outlets to police ideas they believe are undermining the legitimacy of sociology. But whatever postmodernism is, and according to Charles Lemert (1997), it may not be what you think, it will not go away. If postmodernism is about anything, it is about the fact that the world has changed in some unmistakable yet ill-defined and unfolding way, and that our conventional ways of thinking about social life may no longer suffice (Denzin 1997).\n\nThe Narrative Turn\n\nAmidst all this commotion and strife, one began to hear a cacophony of voices throughout the social sciences and the humanities about narrative, narrative analysis, stories, and storytelling. This movement is constituted by diverse “analytic languages and growing representational heritages” that often talk around and past each other and do not fully engage (Gubrium and Holstein 1999:564). There is at this moment no central core or standardized\n\n4\n\nRonald J. Berger & Richard Quinney\n\nset of procedures that can be said to have achieved dominance. The less contentious and more cordial practitioners are content with allowing various avenues of inquiry to grow and are reluctant to enforce a regime of truth that will undermine creative developments. In general, narrative is about stories and story structure. It is about imbuing “life events with a temporal and logical order,” about establishing continuity between the past, present, and as yet unrealized future, about transforming human experience into meaning (Ochs and Capps 2001:2). Narrative turns mere chronology—one thing after another—into “the purposeful action of plot” (Taylor 2001:2). A coherent plot is one that has a beginning, middle, and end. It grows plausibly out of what has come before and points the way to what might reasonably come next. Hayden White calls this emplotment, the way in which “a sequence of events fashioned into a story is gradually revealed to be a story of a particular kind” (1973:7). Narratives, however, are not always orderly accounts and do not invariably have happy endings. In Lost in the Funhouse, John Barth selfconsciously comments on the failure of his story to cohere: “the plot doesn’t rise by meaningful steps but winds upon itself, digresses, retreats, hesitates, sighs, collapses, expires” (1968:96). Such stories are harder to hear, harder to make sense of, because they are stories about disconnectedness, about absurdity and uncertainty. In their telling, however, the sense of chaos may actually be eased, a “healthy disorder” may be unleashed (Mitchell 1981:ix). Even an effectively narrated tragedy will allow us to “take comfort that even the worst life has to offer can be given a shape, can be expressed—enacted—and therefore contemplated and reconciled” (Taylor 2001:75). But while some narratives are about healing, others are about wounds and pain that cannot be cured but only endured (Frank 1995; Zeitlan 1997). Some analysts make a distinction between narrative and story. For example, D. Jean Clandinin and F. Michael Connelly (1998) characterize narrative as a method of inquiry and story as the phenomenon of that inquiry. They write that people “lead storied lives and tell stories of those lives,” while “narrative researchers describe such lives, collect and tell stories of them, and write narratives of experience” (p. 155). David Maines (1999) conceptualizes narrative as the cultural “master frame” or structure that prefigures stories and makes storytelling possible. Stories rely on and invoke collective myths, archetypes, symbols, linguistic forms, and vocabularies of motive, without which their meaning “would remain unintelligible and uninterpretable” (Ewick and Silbey 1995:211–212). Arthur Frank, on the other hand, notes that “since narratives only exist in particular stories, and all stories are narratives, the distinction is hard to sustain” (1995:188).\n\nThe Narrative Turn in Social Inquiry\n\n5\n\nNarrative scholars of various stripes seem to concur with the proposition that lived experience can be understood through the stories people tell about it. Stories are ways not merely of telling others about ourselves but of constructing our identities, of finding purpose and meaning in our lives. Frank observes that “stories of people trying to sort out who they are figure prominently on the landscape of postmodern times” (Frank 1995:xiii). In the telling we remember, we rework and reimagine the past, reflect back upon ourselves, and entertain what we have and could become. What is included or omitted from our stories makes plausible our anticipated futures. Because stories unfold over time, they are provisional and openended and contain the possibility for change. At the same time, storytelling does not occur in a social vacuum. It requires listeners who may validate or reject our stories or require us to accommodate our stories to theirs (Clandinin and Connelly 2000; Gubrium and Holstein 1997; Rosenwald and Ochberg 1992; Taylor 2001). Some analysts are concerned that by acknowledging that everyone has their own story, narrative inquiry runs the risks of dissolving into solipsism or the local circumstances of each particular telling and of assuming that people’s commonsense accounts are suitable substitutes for sociological analysis. According to this view, people tell stories and use narrative in everyday life, but it generally takes a trained observer to make sociological sense out of all that is told. Thus Jaber Gubrium and James Holstein argue that researchers should allow “indigenous voices [to] have their own say” without abandoning their authorial obligation to “complement and contextualize the explication of informants’ accounts, or nonaccounts as the case might be” (Gubrium and Holstein 1999:569–570; Rosenwald and Ochberg 1992). The narrative literature is replete with myriad authorial strategies for narrating people’s stories. Gubrium and Holstein are noteworthy for their ethnomethodologically informed inquiries into the how questions of “narrative practice,” that is, the everyday activities through which “stories about experience are presented, structured, and made to cohere” and thus constitute and sustain the meaningful realities of social life (1997:147). They view stories as incomplete “prior to their telling” and are interested in how people assemble their accounts “to meet situated interpretive demands” and in the process transform “experiential ‘chaos’ into coherent and decipherable forms” and social identities of the self (1998:166). To this end, they employ a variety of abstract, generalized narrative concepts (e.g., narrative linkage, slippage, editing, options, control, collaboration, coherence) to illuminate “how the meaning of experience is both artfully constructed and circumstantially conditioned” (1998:177; Holstein and Gubrium 2000). Gubrium and Holstein offer readers a healthy sampling of conversational exchanges derived from a rich source of ethnographic data. Other\n\n6\n\nRonald J. Berger & Richard Quinney\n\nnarrative researchers employ more narrowly construed conversational analyses, examining the microstructural features or rules of conversation that enable people to speak to “one another in an orderly, recognizable fashion” (Gubrium and Holstein 1997:55). These texts may use formal notation devices that take on the appearance of quasi-mathematical verbal formulas. Then there are those who utilize content analysis assisted by the latest computer software or apply semiotic or other linguistic methods to analyze the microstructural properties of symbolic texts. These narrative strategies privilege analyst and method over storyteller and story and distance us from the world of lived experience.3 Microlevel narratives also lack a Millsian sensitivity to the interconnection between biography and history in society. In contrast, other narrative analysts examine personal stories as embedded in a field of power and inequality that extends beyond the realm of “pure narrativity” itself (Rosenwald and Ochberg 1992:7). Here the analyst is concerned that storytellers are unable or unwilling to articulate the structures of domination that colonize consciousness and reiterate and elaborate hegemonic frameworks that reinforce the status quo. Personal experience can be too narrow, too idiosyncratic, to shed light on important social debates. Often the most compelling insights come from examining the multiple experiences of others. Thus the imposition of critical social analyses may be necessary for the telling of subversive stories that facilitate personal, spiritual, and political emancipation. According to Patricia Ewick and Susan Silbey, “Subversive stories are narratives that employ the connection between the particular and the general by locating the individual within social organization” (1995:220). The personal is political. Personal troubles are public issues. A problem with such critical narratives, however, is that they, too, often privilege the analyst over the storyteller. If the past has taught us anything, it is that members of marginalized groups should be afforded the opportunity to speak their own truths. Changing social conditions create cultural openings for the telling of alternative tales, which in turn pave the way for new modes of engagement with the world. Historical reality is a contested terrain. People previously silenced are now giving voice to their stories and imagining better endings for themselves and the communities in which they are enmeshed.\n\nQualitative Methods and Self-Reflexive Social Inquiry\n\nThe critique of positivist sociology discussed earlier in this introduction gave birth to a “crisis of representation.” In the postmodern period, who can lay claims to speak the truth? Nowhere has this crisis been more visi-\n\nThe Narrative Turn in Social Inquiry\n\n7\n\nble than in the field of qualitative methods (Denzin 1997; Denzin and Lincoln 2003). Qualitative inquiry, an interdisciplinary endeavor, owes a particular debt to the early anthropologists and Chicago school sociologists who laid the groundwork for the ethnographic fieldwork method in the early twentieth century. In those early years and for several decades thereafter, researchers were assumed capable of authoring objective, truthful accounts of “other” cultures and societies (Adler and Adler 1987; Denzin and Lincoln 2003). In the 1980s anthropology was at the forefront of a methodological self-reflection that challenged the assumptive separation of the observer from the observed. Qualitative data were now understood as a product of the interpretive work that constructs social reality, that “writes culture” (Clifford and Marcus 1986; Denzin 1997; Frank 2000; Geertz 1988). To some extent, it is noncontroversial that ethnographic research is more dependent than quantitative analysis on the researcher’s use of self, for in fieldwork the researcher is the primary instrument for documenting and interpreting the data. Conventionally, however, this truism is viewed as a potential liability. While a range of membership roles is tolerated (e.g., observer-as-participant, participant-as-observer, and complete participant), ethnographers are encouraged to maintain analytic detachment, to cultivate an “attitude of strangeness,” and especially to avoid “going native” (Adler and Adler 1987; Neuman 2003:375). The postmodern challenge, on the other hand, actively eschews the ideal of the trained “social science voyeur” who stands apart from the experience being observed, remembered, or recorded (Denzin 1998:411; Richardson 1998, 2002). There is no separation of the observer and the observed. The writer’s voice is always present. The author is part of the story. In this view, researchers no longer have the option of avoiding selfreflection. As Michelle Fine and Lois Weis observe, “It is now acknowledged that we, as critical ethnographers, have a responsibility to talk about our own identities, why we interrogate as we do, what we choose not to report, on whom we train our scholarly gaze, who is protected and not protected as we do our work” (2002:284). In the midst of this epistemological reappraisal, autoethnography emerged as an identifiable research strategy. As far as we can tell, the term is attributable to David Hayano (1979), who defined it as the cultural study of one’s own people. Under the creative influence of Carolyn Ellis, however, autoethnography came to be understood as a method by which the ethnographer turns her or his gaze inward, while also maintaining the observer’s gaze outward and examining the larger social context in which experiences of the self occur (Bochner and Ellis 2002; Ellis 1995, 2004; Ellis and Bochner 1996).\n\n8\n\nRonald J. Berger & Richard Quinney\n\nWhile many of the articles in this book could be described as autoethnographic, the term is too narrow for our purposes. We are interested in both the autobiographical and the biographical, and we understand these two genres as intertwined. One cannot write autobiography without interfacing that story with the stories of others. Neither, as we have seen, can one write biography without recognizing the authorial voice that produces the biographical presence. Thus we seek a narrative sociology that embraces both of these forms, as well as the ethnographic and other qualitative genres (e.g., life history, oral history, life story, case studies) whose boundaries blur in rebellion against the instinct to classify (see Denzin 1989:47–48). A self-reflexive sociology anticipates the charge of solipsism and selfindulgence that is often brought against it. The rebuttal to this charge lies, in part, in the Millsian recognition of the relationship between the individual and society. Society runs through our blood. We are not separate from it. As Jean-Paul Sartre would have it: “I am the universal singular, universalizing in my singularity the crisis and experiences of my historical epoch” (paraphrased by Denzin 1999:511). Or, in Kathryn Church’s words: “My subjectivity is filled with the voices of other[s]. . . . Writing about myself is a way of writing about these others and about the worlds which we create [and] inhabit” (1995:5). At the same time, and this is perhaps the paradox, the writer must have the humility to acknowledge that “I give you the world as experienced by a single individual. And even when I am moved to generalize beyond my own experience, be cautioned that this is just one observer writing to make sense of his own life” (Quinney 1998:xi–xii). There is never a single story that can be told.\n\nToward a Storytelling Sociology\n\nStorytelling is as ancient as the language it uses. It emerged out of the need to speak and to understand the world. Storytelling secures and increases our consciousness and extends the reality of our experiences. But since the last quarter of the twentieth century, we seem to have undergone a storytelling revival. The writing and reading of autobiography and biography are more popular than ever. Everyone wants to write his or her memoir. Professional storytellers have become more visible. People are researching their family’s genealogy and relatives’ histories, preserving these stories for future generations. Storytelling is invoked in the art of healing, as a way of defining one’s journey through and beyond suffering. Sociologists have become storytellers.4 Perhaps this revival reflects a culture that is ill at ease, that lacks compelling myths to bind us all together. Perhaps it has something to do with\n\nThe Narrative Turn in Social Inquiry\n\n9\n\nour sense of rootlessness, of separation from extended family. Perhaps it’s the secularization of the world or the vacuousness of television. Perhaps it’s a form of nostalgia, a way to resurrect something we never really had. Perhaps it’s the condition of postmodernity. In this book of narrative sociology, we follow Robert Coles’s lead. In The Call of Stories, Coles (1989) tells of the advice given to him by one of his supervisors, Dr. Ludwig, during his residency in a psychiatric ward. Ludwig urged Coles to dispense with the theoretical abstractions of his profession in order to let patients tell him their story. “What ought to be interesting, Dr. Ludwig kept insisting, is the unfolding of a lived life rather than the confirmation such a chronicle provides for some theory. . . . Let the story itself be our discovery” (p. 22). Norman K. Denzin (1997, 1999) distinguishes two general orientations toward narrative inquiry: the analytic and storied approaches. The analytic, as we have seen, is more positivist in orientation, maintaining the analyst’s neutral stance, silencing the writer’s voice, and employing abstract interpretive schemes derived from preexisting theory or deduced from the data itself. The storied approach, on the other hand, is theoretically minimalist, seeking meaning in the stories themselves and encouraging the listener/reader’s active engagement with the material (Jackson 1998; Polkinghorne 1995). This is why, in the forthcoming introductions to the four sections of this book—Family and Place, The Body, Education and Work, and The Passing of Time—we avoid overtheorizing the essays. Following Thomas Barone (1995), we understand the artfully persuasive storyteller as one who is willing to relinquish control over the story’s meaning and to trust readers to bring their own interpretive and emotional sensibilities to bear on the tale being told. In this project, which we call storytelling sociology, the measure of the “truth” is judged not by conventional scientific standards of validity and reliability but by the power of stories to evoke the vividness of lived experience (Denzin 1997). The aim is verisimilitude, or what Sara LawrenceLightfoot and Jessica Hoffmann Davis call “authenticity,” the degree to which the narrative captures “the essence and resonance of the actors’ experience and perspective through details of action and thought revealed in context” (1997:12). Stories transfuse “the pale abstractions of disembodied reason with the blood and bone of the senses and presents them for inspection” (Taylor 2001:30). They tell a truth that “no amount of theorizing or recitation of statistics” could reveal, a truth that generates empathy, makes it more difficult to marginalize others, helps build social bonds (Duncan 1998:107). Stories help us consider “the conditions under which the moral terms of the self are constituted” (Denzin 1999:513). They make us more “forgiving of moral failure at the same time that they convince us”\n\n10\n\nRonald J. Berger & Richard Quinney\n\nof the necessity of moral choices and of the need to engage the world in the struggle for peace and justice (Taylor 2001:55). A compelling story is not simple entertainment, although it can be entertaining. A compelling story “isn’t a flight from reality but a vehicle that carries us on our search for reality, [a] best effort to make sense out of the anarchy of existence” (McKee 1997:12). Characters in stories—when they are interesting characters—make choices, exercise agency in the face of structural constraints, attempt “to take control over their lives and the stories about them” (Denzin 1999:512). They are both chosen by and choose their stories. A compelling story connects personal experience to public narratives, allowing society to “speak itself” through each individual. In storytelling sociology, the writing is recognized as part of the research process. It is not merely a “report” of one’s observations, but an integral part of the process of creating meaning. As Laurel Richardson observes, “I write because I want to find something out. I write in order to learn something that I didn’t know before I wrote it” (1998:347). It is through the writing that we discover our “voice,” as we emerge from silence, in our search to discover or rediscover our selves (Lincoln 2002; Lincoln and Denzin 2003; Lincoln and Guba 2003; Richardson 2002). Storytelling sociology encourages writing that experiments with different forms of representation and that seeks engagement with the world beyond academe. Much sociological writing is, quite frankly, dull and turgid. Students, if they can manage to muddle through it, find it boring and “are disappointed that sociology is not more interesting” (Richardson 1998:346). We need to cultivate a writing that reaches a broader audience, not just a writing that impresses our colleagues with our ability to master theoretical abstraction or mathematical technique. We need a writing that avoids esoteric language, that informs and enlightens without being pedantic, that appeals to both the intellect and emotions, seeking to inform and inspire and joining “the endeavors of documentation, interpretation, and intervention” (Lawrence-Lightfoot and Davis 1997:xvi). Lawrence-Lightfoot and Davis, among others, seek an interdisciplinary approach to narrative inquiry that operates at the border of the social sciences and the humanities, that blurs the boundaries of empiricism and aesthetics. This approach is permissive of experimental forms of writing that abandon conventional scientific formats. In the process new narrative genres are being created. We are now hearing more about “sociopoetics” and “performance” texts that span the range of communicative expression with photography, drama, music, and dance (Bochner and Ellis 2002; Ellis and Bochner 1996; Gergen and Gergen 2003; Richardson 1998, 2002). Relative to these experimental forms, the readings in this book are in many ways more conventional. Our own affinity is for a narrative style that most closely resembles the personal essay. As Phillip Lopate (1995) notes\n\nThe Narrative Turn in Social Inquiry\n\n11\n\nin his wonderful anthology The Art of the Personal Essay, this a genre that spans a history of over 400 years. According to Lopate, the “hallmark of the personal essay is its intimacy” (p. xxiii). It is a writing that reveals the process by which the writer has arrived at her thoughts, lets readers in on his doubts, makes the writer vulnerable in the text, reflects on roads taken and not taken. This does not mean that the writer bares all. It is not kiss and tell. The writer is entitled to some privacy. The writing style of the personal essay is friendly, even conversational, but also literary. The reader should enjoy the “pleasure of knowing that we are in cultivated hands, attending to a well-stocked liberally educated mind” (p. xli). Importantly, according to Lopate, the “personal essayist must above all be a reliable narrator; we must trust his or her core of sincerity. We must . . . feel secure that the [writer] has done a fair amount of introspective homework . . . and is trying to give us the maximum understanding and intelligence of which he or she is capable” (p. xxvi). This criterion raises the question of narrative truth. We agree with the proposition that there is no such thing as unmediated reality. At the same time, the contributors to this book have made a conscientious effort to describe the world as they see it (or perhaps, we should say, as they tell it). They do not deliberately deceive or “make things up” to provoke the reader’s attention. We are content to live in the borderland between reality and our perceptions of it, as we marvel at the breadth and depth of the human experience. Let the stories begin!\n\nNotes\n\n1. Critiques of positivist sociology can be found in Denzin (1997), Lemert (1997), Maines (1993), Richardson (1996), and Seidman (1996). 2. Some good examples are Anderson (1923), Shaw (1930), Thomas and Zaniecki (1918–1920), Thrasher (1927), and Whyte (1943). 3. Further comments on such strategies can be found in Denzin (1997), Frey et al. (1992), Manning and Cullum-Swan (1998), Ochs and Capps (2001), Pathas (1995), and Silverman (1991). 4. Storytelling in sociology and in the larger society is celebrated in Denzin (1997, 1999), Frank (1995), Hovey (2003), Quinney (2000), Sobol (1999), Stich (2002), Taylor (2001), and Zinsser (1998).\n\nPART\n\n1\n\nFamily and Place It was C. Wright Mills’s contention, as it is ours, that the simultaneous consideration of individual lives and social contexts, the exploration of how they are intermeshed, can yield sociological insight into both those lives and those contexts. The family would seem as good a place to start as any, for the very existence of the “autobiographical and biographical genre is structured by the belief that lives have beginnings in families” (Denzin 1989:19). It may seem a simplistic observation to say that life begins with a family. But as the contemporary state of family life attests, what constitutes a “family” is very much a social construction. For many people, family constitutes not just a presence but an absence as well. Missing people. Ghosts of the past. People who live in our heads. Lives once known that have been lost. Families are also situated in time and place. We live in, and through, historical eras. Our lives are shaped by the time in which we were born into the world and through which we move in successive stages, carrying with us the particular stamp of the generational cohort in which we are enmeshed (Elder 1994). Our lives are situated in a place, or places. A place is not simply an address, a geographical locale. “The meaning of a place . . . depends on the geniuses we locate there” (Bell 1997:813). It is populated by persons, “even when there is no one there.” We “live in landscapes filled with ghosts,” of people we once knew, who give life to a place even in their absence. Our memory of place is filled with visions of the physical terrain, whether it is the asphalt streets of an urban milieu or the scenic beauty of a mountainous landscape. We experience these physical environments as if they were people, for they are embodied with a soul, the soul of our selves and the lives of others who have made us what we are or hope to be (or not to be). This section opens with Norman Denzin’s “Searching for Yellowstone,” a moving familial narrative that unfolds into a critical reading of Wallace Stegner’s autobiographical account of his own childhood. Stegner, as Denzin points out, is considered to be the founding father of 13\n\n14\n\nFamily and Place\n\ncontemporary literature and history on the American West. He wrote a dozen novels and seven nonfiction works, won numerous prestigious awards, and was a national figure in the environmental movement. Denzin reads Stegner as a way back to his own family’s history, as a way to dream himself back into the mid-twentieth-century midwestern landscape of his roots. Stegner’s father was a salesman, as were Denzin’s grandfather and father. Denzin sees many parallels between his own feelings and those of one of Willy Loman’s sons in Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman, a feeling of shame over what constituted the white male middle-class American dream of that era, a dream of making fast money but never being unscrupulous enough to get it. This sad story of America was written upon the backs of the northern plains Indians, whose history, Stegner (mistakenly) says, stopped in 1890. It is in Yellowstone, however, where Denzin searches for the answer to his life. Yellowstone, the oldest national park in the world, famous for its natural wonders, its geysers and hot springs, is perhaps another embodiment of the American dream. Denzin is searching for a spot where his grandfather fished for trout many years ago. Stegner’s father had passed through those parts too. Denzin’s grandfather wanted to take him there, to experience a place where he could find fulfillment. But Denzin will have to take the trip on his own. Nelia Olivencia takes another American landmark, the Twin Towers in New York City, as the point of departure for her understanding of family and place. Prior to the infamous September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center, Olivencia had not really thought of herself as a New Yorker, as being part of the Lower East Side of that city, even though this is where she grew up. In her essay, “Twin Towers,” Olivencia reflects on her conflictual feelings of being a child of Puerto Rican immigrants, a woman who grew up under difficult conditions and who experienced rejection by the Anglo world, a woman who persevered in the face of difficulty to forge a life of accomplishment. September 11 hit her with a jolt, as it did the rest of the nation (indeed the world) and caused her to reassess her feeling of alienation from the United States. She was no longer a Nuyorican but a New Yorker and a Puerto Rican. Like the Twin Towers, Olivencia was half of a twin pair. In 1989 the two of them had ascended to the top of the Twin Towers. She could never have imagined the demolition of these structures. It was a metaphor for what had happened to her formerly tight-knit family, which was crumbling under the weight of her overbearing and aging mother. September 11, however, was an opportunity for a reconciliation not only of Olivencia’s ethnic identity but of her relationship with her mother as well, as she came “full circle to the trust of a newborn for her mother.”\n\nFamily and Place\n\n15\n\nEthnic identity is also the theme of A. Javier Treviño’s “Remembering George Washington on the Rio Grande.” Treviño writes about growing up in the U.S.-Mexican border town of Laredo, Texas, and more specifically about his experiences with his high school marching band and the band’s participation in a particular celebration of George Washington’s birthday. This annual tradition, which began in 1898, might seem peculiar given that Laredo is over 90 percent Hispanic (mostly of Mexican descent) and that Mexican nationals from across the border are invited to join in the festivities. Treviño notes that the event has come to symbolize “an organic solidarity of continued cooperation” between the United States and Mexico as well as a “bicultural way of life.” But while blurring traditional social boundaries, this “invented tradition” produces new ones as well, a fragmented integration fraught with paradoxes and contradictions, especially in a post–September 11 context involving U.S. leaders’ increased suspicion of open borders. Still, Treviño remains intrigued about living on “the border,” as he remains spiritually and existentially connected to his roots, which he now views from a spatial and temporal distance. He remains “umbilically bound” to Laredo and its celebratory tradition. “It’s eccentric,” he writes. “It’s the border. But it’s ours.” Like some of the other contributors to this book, Jean Hector Faley lived her life with a feeling of ambivalence about ethnic identity, having reluctantly immigrated from Glasgow, Scotland, to the United States in her teens. But it was not ambivalence about being an American that troubled Faley. Rather it was remorse about the life she has lost by being severed from her homeland. When she returned to Glasgow in her later years, she stood in the place she had stood as a young child decades earlier. The community had been decimated by the decline of industrial jobs. Familiar landmarks had been demolished. The old tenement structures were gone, as was the vibrant tenement culture of her youth. Faley’s “My Ain Folk: Scottish Oral History and the Sociological Imagination” is not an essay of romantic nostalgia for a day gone by but recounts an experience of self-discovery through the lives of others: “my ain folk, my own people.” As she embarked on an oral history project with older Glaswegians who had lived through that earlier era, Faley found herself not only preserving for posterity a lost way of life but also coming to understand her own angst as a reluctant immigrant, which she had experienced as a personal trouble but which was in fact a commonly shared public issue. Tony Platt, too, was a European immigrant to the United States. But for secular Jews like Platt, America was not exile, not the abyss of the Diaspora, but in fact the “promised land.” Platt was a product of the post–World War II decline in anti-Semitism, when being Jewish became a\n\n16\n\nFamily and Place\n\nmatter more of choice than of social proscription. In fact, in Manchester, England, the land of his birth, many of Platt’s relatives seemed to care about everyone else but Jews. Platt’s essay, “Everyone Else: Becoming Jewish,” takes us into this world of secular Judaism and the progressive leftist politics it entailed. After his arrival in Berkeley, California, in 1963, Platt involved himself in the political struggles of the day, hanging out with Jews “for whom anti-Semitism was our lowest priority” and who sided with Palestinians and not Israelis in the politics of the Middle East. But something curious started to happen to Platt many years later, in 1999, while he was doing research on California history at the Huntington Library. He learned of an original copy of the 1935 Nazi Nuremberg Laws that the library administrators had kept secret for over five decades. Platt wondered why. His ensuing and persistent inquiry into this issue led one library employee to comment, “You’re becoming really Jewish.” Platt was taken aback, but he realized “she was on to something.” As he concludes his essay, we get the sense that Platt is not quite sure what that something might be. Is it nothing more than an uncanny reminder of his past? What does it mean to be a Jew when one has more interest in politics than in religious faith? Reading Platt’s essay along with DeWitt Clinton’s “Walking with Lao Tzu at Auschwitz” makes for an uncanny connection as well. Clinton, a son of a Methodist minister, had always been fascinated with the people of the Old Testament, which propelled him (perhaps subconsciously) on a lifelong quest in search of the Hebrews. When he finally found them, he converted and became close friends with a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany. He started to hear the ghosts of the Holocaust calling out to him. Can one be a Jew without thinking about Auschwitz? Clinton, a literature professor and poet, had also become fascinated with other religions of the world. He was especially drawn to Eastern philosophers—the Buddha, the Dalai Lama, and especially Lao Tzu. As he read the works of these great thinkers alongside literature of the Holocaust, a poem took shape in his mind. An old Chinese sage was giving voice to those who were silenced, taking the poet on a spiritual journey into a tumultuous past. Clinton’s epic poem “Reading the Tao at Auschwitz” concludes his essay: “In Time to Come This will be / A Place where Tourists come / To weep, or finish what was started . . . / Some will wander through, amazed / A Place like This was ever Here . . . / Let the living start to come back / Let it be a place of memory / A place where some had hope / We’d all rise & float away / From this place.”\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nSearching for Yellowstone Norman K. Denzin\n\nI am now ready for the Yellowstone Park, and look forward to the trip with intense pleasure. —General William Strong, 1876\n\nNative American writer Elizabeth Cook-Lynn says she can no longer read Wallace Stegner, the founding father of contemporary literature and history on the American West.1 She refuses to accept Stegner’s view that history for northern plains Indians “sort of stopped at 1890” (Cook-Lynn 1996:29– 30; Stegner 1962:66). To read Stegner, she contends, is to endorse his view that Native Americans occupy a marginal place at best in the history of the American West. I agree with Cook-Lynn. Cook-Lynn explicitly criticizes Stegner’s view of Native Americans as given in Wolf Willow (1962), his autoethnographic account of his childhood in Cypress Hills in southern Saskatchewan, where his family homesteaded from 1914 to 1920. In Wolf Willow Stegner speaks of the plains Indians’ destroying “the world that nourished them” (p. 66). He describes the homestead setting of his childhood as a semicivilized world and writes of living on the “disappearing edge of nowhere,” “growing up as a sensuous little savage” in a new country that had no history (pp. 24–25, 28, 57). CookLynn’s point, of course, is that the plains Indians’ world was drenched in history, culture, and tradition, a history that fourth-generation European immigrants, including Stegner’s family, could not see but helped to destroy. But today I read Stegner anyway, and this is because his autoethnography and his family history help me find my way back to my father, my grandfather, and my mother (see Stegner 1943, 1962, 1979, 1992). Dreaming my way into a midcentury landscape, I seek to understand my family’s middle-class version of the American dream. Yellowstone Park is as good a place as any to start.2 17\n\n18\n\nNorman K. Denzin\n\nIn 1932, about the same time Stegner’s father was taking a shortcut through Yellowstone Park on a bootleg whiskey run to Cody, Wyoming (Stegner 1943), my grandfather was fishing for brown and rainbow trout in the Firehole River near Old Faithful Lodge. I have a picture of Grandpa smiling, standing beside a Lincoln roadster, wearing a white shirt, a tie, and a gray fedora, proudly pointing to a string of over twenty trout. Today I search for the spot in Yellowstone where Grandpa caught those trout, wondering if he and Stegner’s father may have been in the same place at the same time.3 Stegner’s father was a salesman; so was Grandpa, and so was my father. Grandpa made his money in the Depression. He invented a mechanical device somewhat like a slide rule or today’s hand calculator. Used properly, it allowed persons to instantly compute sums, fractions, decibels, or ratios. The slender bronze-colored metal device was in the shape of a monkey suspended in midair. Trapped in a metal cage, the monkey wore a red hat. The monkey’s arms and feet could be moved back and forth and up and down, across a sliding metric. If you divided 30 by 2, the monkey’s hands pointed to the number 15. Grandpa talked small-town store owners into buying the franchise rights to his calculating monkey. For $10,000 a store owner could have the sales rights to an entire county. Grandpa then showed owners how they could use trading stamps, which would give customers discounts on purchases at their store, if they bought a monkey. Grandpa printed and sold these stamps. In his Lincoln roadster Grandpa toured the Middle West, the West, and the South, selling this system. He got rich and retired to the farm at the age of forty, taking hundreds of boxes of monkeys with him. One version of family legend holds that he was chased out of Kansas City by the mob, the same mob that helped Truman gain the White House in 1945. My father sold hardware, John Deere tractors and plows, Farm Bureau life and car insurance, Ramblers, Dodges, Pontiacs, used cars, sunken treasure from pirate ships, antiques and collectibles, and fake brass doorknobs. He could sell anything. My junior year in high school we read Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman (1949). I saw too many parallels between Dad and Willy Loman. Like one of Willy’s sons, I was ashamed to have a father who was a salesman. My girlfriend at the time, whose father was a physician, said I had nothing to be ashamed of. I cried anyway, reading Willy Loman’s disgrace and death as if they were my father’s. When I was sixteen my father sold me a $5,000 life insurance policy. The premium has stayed the same for forty-five years, $44.80 payable June 1 and November 1. Every time I write out the check I think of that night when he sold me the policy, telling me that this sale helped him make his quota for that month, maybe even qualify him for a ten-day company fishing trip to Canada and a Hudson Bay Wool blanket.\n\nSearching for Yellowstone\n\n19\n\nMy father never got rich. He was a devout conservative, a Reagan-Bush Republican; over his desk in Small Stuff, his antique shop in the Amana Colonies, hung a photo of him and George Bush shaking hands. Across the top, Bush wrote, “Thanks to my good friend Ken Denzin.” My father believed in the U.S. of A. and in the American dream, no social security or affirmative action; he held to hard work, handcrafted bookcases, dark blue serge suits, gray sweaters, close-cut hair, women in the kitchen, Camel cigarettes, home-cooked meals, community theater, learning from your mistakes, and after sobriety, kindness, generosity, and fierce loyalty to family. When he died he left a few clothes, three broken Timex watches, two pocketknives, a woodworking shop full of hand-oiled tools, awls, files, screwdrivers, little planes, saws, drills, bits, levels, hammers, and pliers. I gathered them up and took them home. I bought a sheet of pegboard and some hooks. I hung the pegboard on the wall in my basement shop and neatly arrayed the awls, hammers, and screwdrivers. It looks like a display in a museum, my father’s legacy, three wood boxes and a handful of tools. We spread his ashes on the Mississippi River. Stegner says his father “was born with the itch in his bones. . . . He was always telling stories of men who had gone over the hill to some new place . . . made their pile, got to be big men” (1943:83). By the time I was eight my family had moved ten times. The next sales job was always going to be the best, somewhere, “if you knew where to find it, someplace where money could be made like drawing money from a well, some Big Rock Candy Mountain where life was effortless and rich . . . but not in Chicago, or Milwaukee, or Terre Haute, or the Wisconsin woods, or Dakota. . . . Twelve houses at least in the first four years” (pp. 83, 374). On the Big Rock Candy Mountain Where the cops have wooden legs, And the handouts grow on bushes, And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs, Where the bulldogs all have rubber teeth And the cinder dicks are blind— I’m a-gonna go Where there ain’t any snow, Where the rain don’t fall And the wind don’t blow On the Big Rock Candy Mountain (Stegner 1943:461)\n\nAnd the bluebird sings to the lemonade springs (Stegner 1992). When Stegner’s father died, the final sum was “One dented silver mug . . . One pair of worn shoes, one worn suit, a dozen spotted neckties, a third interest in a worthless mine” (Stegner 1943:556).\n\n20\n\nNorman K. Denzin\n\nThe Big Rock Candy Mountain was always just around the corner, and my father, like Stegner’s, never seemed to have the nerve, or resolve, to get there. Perhaps it was the fear of really getting on top of the mountain—or was it pride, or restlessness, or an arrogance born of a natural talent never fully realized? To paraphrase Stegner (1943:437), my father was haunted off and on throughout his life by the dream of quick money, but he was never quite unscrupulous enough to make his dream come true. He was a gambler of sorts, but not quite gambler enough. He had “a kind of dull Dutch caution.” He would “gamble with one hand and hold back a stake with the other.” My father was self-centered, stubborn, an egotist dependent on women, stern-voiced, quick to anger, with two years of college, a childhood of poverty and illness, three wives, and three divorces. My grandfather did not have these characteristics. Men like Willy Loman, my father, and Stegner’s father are victims of the post–World War II version of the American dream: work hard, listen to your government, save your money, and you will succeed; do your own thinking but keep it defined in narrow terms, good versus evil. This is a dream that chews up little people and spits them back out. Men like my grandfather escaped this version of the dream. They learned how to get to the top of the Big Rock Candy Mountain, no dull Dutch caution in them, no self-doubt, no crippling addiction, always self-controlled, good humored, never showing anger except to family. Grandpa left Yellowstone with a pocketful of memories and one photograph. Stegner’s father drove through the park and made a bundle on the whiskey he sold to bootleggers in Cody. Surely the two men never met, but the memories of them come together in my mind, opposites, each man seeking something in this sacred site called Yellowstone. By the time he had his picture taken Grandpa was a man of leisure, a man of wealth. In those days such men were tourists, travelers to places of natural wonder, places like Yellowstone (see Dorst 1999; Pomeroy 1957; Rothman 1998; Shaffer 2001). Male tourists in those days wore suits, white shirts, gray fedoras, and drove Lincoln roadsters. Grandpa fit this model to a T. Old Faithful became the place where he performed his version of this identity. In his mind’s eye, that picture represented in a timeless way what his version of the American dream had allowed him to become, a tourist from the Midwest, a man of means occupying a position of authority in nature. Stegner’s father, like mine, never had time to be a tourist. There are no pictures of Dad in a park. Parks like Yellowstone were places to drive through on the way to somewhere else where money could be made. And when he found himself in nature, it was when he won a trip from the Farm\n\nSearching for Yellowstone\n\n21\n\nBureau Life Insurance Company. One million dollars in premiums bought ten days in a Canadian fishing camp with a group of salesmen who were strangers to one another. But there are no pictures from those camps, just a story or two, and an old faded Hudson Bay blanket. Peanuts, he said, “One day we’ll go to Canada on a fishing trip, catch walleyes and pike.” But we never went. And then, on another day, Grandpa said, “One day we’ll get to Yellowstone, and I’ll take you to Old Faithful.” And we never went. As a child and a young man I grew up with these two stories and this picture. Somehow they were sandwiched between and around that photograph of Grandpa and his trout. When Grandpa died and we took his belongings from the nursing home, I got the Yellowstone picture. I feel like Terry Tempest Williams (2000), who also grew up with a picture hanging over her head. My question is hers, “What do I make of this legacy, of this picture?” As a child I grew up with Hieronymus Bosch’s painting . . . El jardin de las delicias . . . hanging over my head. My grandmother had thumbtacked the wings of Paradise and Hell to the bulletin board over the bed where I slept. The prints were . . . part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s series of discussions designed for home education. . . . Whenever my siblings and I stayed overnight, we fell asleep in the “grandchildren’s room” beneath Truth and Evil. —Terry Tempest Williams (2000:5–6)\n\nWhenever I stayed overnight with my grandparents, I fell asleep in the guest bedroom, which had Grandpa’s Yellowstone picture sitting on the dresser. I awakened each morning to the picture of Grandpa and his fish. I have followed that picture into the heart of Yellowstone Park, to the inn at Old Faithful. I have walked along the banks of the Madison and Firehole rivers, where he surely fished. I have stood, as he surely did, with other tourists and waited for Old Faithful to erupt skyward. I have hiked past Upper Geyser Basin to the campground at Fountain Paint Pot, wondering if Grandpa camped here. I drove to West Thumb, Grant Village, and Geyser Basin, looking for his footprints. We say that Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872, but in fact we have never stopped establishing Yellowstone. Whether as first-time visitors or as world-famous biologists we continue to discover and explore it, and we also continue to create it. That is why I call this book Searching for Yellowstone. Our continuing attempt to understand the park and fit it into our national and international life is the most important and certainly the most exciting thing we do here. . . . The search for Yellowstone is . . . a search for ourselves . . . a search for . . .\n\n22\n\nNorman K. Denzin\n\nunderstanding . . . these emotional, subjective and shared portrayals [that] enable us to communicate that search without . . . analytical filters. —Paul Schullery (1997:2–3, 261–262)\n\nLike Schullery, I search Yellowstone Park for meanings, for answers, and I find them in my reflections in the clear evening waters of the Yellowstone River itself. Rod and reel in hand, gray-haired, wearing baggy khaki shorts, faded blue shirt, and Birkenstocks, I stand at water’s edge. I stand not in the image of my father or my grandfather. I have become someone else, a sixty-one-year-old college professor who writes books and stories about whom he might have been. The meaning of the picture is now evident: my grandfather’s smile was an invitation to come to this site. Like others in his generation, he searched for meaning in his life. He was drawn to and found Yellowstone, and in this site he felt fulfilled and complete, fulfilled in a way that he never felt anywhere else. This is why he wanted to take me to Yellowstone, so I could experience this feeling for myself, so I could find myself in the fast-running waters of this river. And I am finding myself. I use this river as a bridge between two landscapes, the plains of the Midwest and the mountains of Montana and Wyoming. On this bridge I look in two directions at the same time. I see two reflections: my father on the one side, my grandfather on the other. In this moment, as these two reflections come together, I see myself more clearly than ever before. There has always been too much of my father in me for me to have become someone like my grandfather, a man who would wear a suit into the park. And there has been too much of my grandfather in me for me to be like my father, a restless man of quick schemes who would race through a park to get somewhere else. But I’m always pulled in both directions at the same time. Their memories flow through me as I stand and look into this river. I am proud of who I have become, my father’s son, my grandfather’s grandson, a man who has grown up. Now I smile back at my grandfather’s photograph and thank him for this gift. And Mother? When Grandpa was staying in Old Faithful Lodge and fishing for trout, Mother and Grandmother were visiting Aunt Elizabeth in her summer home in the Berkeley Hills above Oakland, California. Grandma did not like to travel with Grandpa, so they took separate vacations. She did not like his line of work, and she did not like the women he met on the road. So she and Mother never went to Yellowstone. I suppose, then, this is why I still read Stegner, for reading him helps me continue my search for Yellowstone, its meanings in my life, and my place in my family’s history. Working through Stegner’s treatment of Native Americans also helps me better understand cowboys and Indians,\n\nSearching for Yellowstone\n\n23\n\nredskins and chiefs, and their contradictory places in our national imagination. For this understanding I thank Elizabeth Cook-Lynn.\n\nNotes\n\n1. Wallace Stegner wrote twelve novels and seven nonfiction works and won numerous prestigious awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1971. He was a national figure in the environmental movement and a major Western historian (Benson 1996). 2. I take this essay’s title, in part, from Schullery (1997). I thank Laurel Richardson for her comments on an earlier version of the essay. 3. My grandfather was Waldo William Townsley. John Townsley, whose relationship to my grandfather is uncertain, was a midcentury Yellowstone Park superintendent. John had a son named Forest. When I was ten years old Grandma Townsley invited Uncle Forest and Aunt Elizabeth to visit the farm. They came from Milwaukee. Aunt Elizabeth was an interior decorator. She decorated Grandma’s living room. The Victorian walnut loveseat she picked out in 1950 sits in our balcony today. In searching for Yellowstone, I claim my place in this version of Townsley family history.\n\nCHAPTER\n\n3\n\nTwin Towers Nelia Olivencia\n\nIt would never be the same again. The veil lifted from my eyes to\n\nreveal the devastation wreaked on September 11, 2001, on a neighborhood that had been the setting of some of the most formative years of my life. Until that moment I had not thought of myself as a New Yorker and as part of the Lower East Side of the city. I was shocked by the pain I felt as I saw the fortress of my life become vulnerable. As a child, I was exposed to the brute force of nuns who punished children harshly for real or imagined infractions and to a world full of destruction: condemned buildings with broken windows, gutted insides, and backyards littered with broken liquor bottles, used condoms, chunks of rock, and scraps of paper. It was ugly, but to a child the broken glass of the liquor bottles shone like jewels, and the backyards served as the backdrop for imaginative games in which I leaped around hills made of trash and played stickball and kick the box. The years I spent growing up in the Lower East Side prepared me to confront, survive, and overcome the many obstacles that were yet to come. As a nine-year-old, I made a conscious decision to be an outsider rather than suffer humiliation and hurt. As a teenager, I was victimized by but survived within rival gang turfs, lived side by side with drug addicts and prostitutes, criminals and assassins. I was usually the one who escorted friends from bad streets to good streets. As a young woman in college I learned to accept and overcome rejection and denigration of my people and me. I worked at menial jobs in which I was verbally and physically harassed because I was a Puerto Rican and a woman. In graduate school, I survived the intellectually refined mental and verbal abuse of the world of academics. The place I lived as a child was a village within a village within a metropolis. My contact with the world was in Spanish, with an outside 25\n\n26\n\nNelia Olivencia\n\nworld that was Puerto Rican. This outer world would eventually extend to Brooklyn College, Mexico, St. Louis, California, Wisconsin, and beyond, in solitary travels throughout South America and to many other places such as London, Amsterdam, Munich, Madrid, Granada, Paris, Casablanca, Cairo, Tangiers, and Mexico City. And then there was September 11, 2001. I knew where everything in the Lower East Side was located and had gone back often to revisit. But the sudden blow of 9/11 to the pattern of my comfortable memories as a child and outsider brought shock, disbelief, utter pain, and sorrow. I felt as if my guts had been ripped open. My feelings were not of loss or revenge; instead I began feeling what America is really about. I gained a new level of insight into this country and of myself as a New Yorker. I had always defined myself as a Puerto Rican, not as a New Yorker. But this identity was uprooted, and I became what I now am— not a Nuyorican but a New Yorker and a Puerto Rican. The people who perished in those towers reflected the vision of this country as the most multicultural and polyglot of nations. They represented a spectrum from the most humble to the richest person. They were from many nations, races, religions, and from every level of society. It was a revelation, albeit a tragic one, of what makes New York City the heart of the United States and the Lower East Side a significant element within it. It is a place to which “visitors are drawn . . . to connect with their heritage in the old neighborhood—to trace family memories, explore legendary streets, discover venerable synagogues and other historical places, visit tiny shops and sample food evoking the past” (Mendelsohn 2001:1). It is a neighborhood that generated the likes of George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jacob Javits, Irving Berlin, Jimmy Durante, and Rocky Graziano. It had comforted me with a belief that, as an immigrant, I too could transcend the neighborhood and become “somebody.” Its streets have played a role in many films and songs: Delancey Street, the Williamsburg Bridge, Pitt Street, Orchard Street, the Henry Street Settlement, the La Guardia projects, the Grand Street Settlement, the Essex Street Market, and Seward Park. The Twin Towers silhouetted against the sky served as a backdrop to these places. Their destruction left a deep gash, an immeasurable hole, in the fabric of New York. Beginning with immigrants who constitute a tough people, the assault reverberated across the neighborhood, the city, the country, and the world. We would never be the same, and as New Yorkers we gained a new respect and admiration from others for our ability to overcome this blow. My nuclear family furnished me with an identity and supportive environment from which I was able to exit daily to streets full of danger and garbage, lined with broken windows, cracked sidewalks, and leveled tene-\n\nTwin Towers\n\n27\n\nment buildings. An early memory is my own insistence at four on being called “Araña Peluda” (Hairy Spider) to shock and amuse my elders. I frankly liked the sound of it, knowing that in some way it described my shiny, kinky black hair. I loved music and dance. At five, I would break into song and dance, a blooming talent later used by my third-grade teacher to beg for donations for the church. People gaped at this “child wonder” with her lyrical voice. For my mother I became the family’s hope, a vehicle for the road to riches. My life was also shaped by my experiences in which we as Puerto Ricans were denied housing, employment, and equal opportunity. I remember my father and mother telling me that finding a landlord who would rent to Puerto Ricans was difficult. I remember as a teenager seeing my closest friend, an Irish/Norwegian, being hired at the same time and place as I was but at much higher pay and working with customers in the front. Meanwhile, I was paid at minimum wage and had to use the freight elevator to go to work in the back upstairs. I discovered at seven or eight years of age that speaking English was essential to survival in a monolingual society that despises accents and foreign tongues. My mother’s inability to speak English exposed her to constant ridicule, exploitation, and abuse. I swore to myself that I would fully master English. My mother had a second-grade education; I attained a Ph.D. Rather than emulating the victimizer, as Frantz Fanon so well described in his works (Gordon et al. 1999), I have always identified with the underdog.1 My background prepared me to become actively involved in events of the late 1960s and 1970s such as the shaping and implementing of affirmative action, open admissions, and women’s rights to fight injustice and inequity. I wore with assurance, determination, and commitment the hats of a minority activist and a woman activist. Three other faculty members at San Jose State College joined with me to sketch out a curriculum that would be called Chicano studies and become part of the race and ethnic cultures program. It was similar to the struggle being waged for Puerto Rican studies at City University of New York by my brother and sister. I was present at Black Panther events, at a seminal workshop for the creation of “el teatro campesino” (the cultural/dialectical theater of Cesar Chavez’s United Farm Workers), at dialogues and confrontations regarding Black studies, and at the first antidraft movement march. The resolve carried over into my years in Wisconsin, when I marched for abortion rights and served as chair of the Governor’s Committee on Hispanic Affairs and a member of the Governor’s Commission on the Status of Women, as well as a founder of the Wisconsin Women’s Network. Most recently I served on the national board for Chicano studies, and I am now serving on the national board for Puerto Rican studies. My determination in all of this has been driven by those early years in the Lower East Side.\n\n28\n\nNelia Olivencia\n\nMy experiences prepared me for the global vision I now have and my love for, rather than fear of, differences. This view shaped my reaction to 9/11, for even though the downing of the Twin Towers was a personal catastrophic experience, it was also a statement against the United States’ blindness to the plight of many around the world who live without basic necessities such as food, potable water, clothing, and housing. Still, after 9/11 my life would never be the same again. My new sense of identity as a New Yorker and Puerto Rican has not overcome my ambiguous feeling toward the United States, in which I still feel like an outsider. The river runs deep. Only when I am outside of the country do I feel like I am part of it. Only then do I realize that I have internalized many things that are American—but so has the rest of the world. The ambiguity remains. Like each of the Twin Towers, I am half of a set of twins. Nelson and I were shaped and molded by the common bond of sharing the same womb, being born prematurely four minutes apart, spending the first month of our lives in an incubator, and being visually impaired. It also meant sharing the same birthday cake and birthday celebrations, attending the same school and classes for eight years, participating in the same social activities, and sharing the same friends until college. Only when I went to graduate school at Washington University in St. Louis was the bond broken. To this day I have dreams in which I search for my other half, never feeling complete. Our Puerto Rican identity manifests itself differently because of gender and geographical differences. While I left New York City for graduate school never to return permanently, my twin remained in the city. While both of us are fluent in Spanish and English and versed in Puerto Rican and U.S. history, politics, and culture, our dual vision of the world is balanced differently—his toward being American, mine toward being Puerto Rican. Our political perspectives differ. I view Puerto Rico as a nation; he views Puerto Rico as part of the United States. The only way I can make sure that I am communicating with my mother is to speak in Spanish. “Las torres gemelas que se derrumbaron el 11 de septiembre, ¿te recuerdas de este evento?” (The Twin Towers that fell on 9/11, do you remember this event?). My mother nods yes. This is in response to her asking me who is bin Laden, whose picture flashes on screen during the Spanish news show she is watching on TV. So many years of living in the financial world center, but she still lives in a parallel universe. I stand on the line between these two worlds—juggling hers and mine. She, a ninety-year-old Puerto Rican jibara (peasant) with a second-\n\nTwin Towers\n\n29\n\ngrade education, I, her daughter, with a Ph.D. The same bloodline and culture. From her window in a room on the tenth floor of the Isabella Nursing Home in Upper Manhattan—on the right side, a view of the George Washington Bridge, the Hudson River, and the Westside of Manhattan; on the left side, the Bronx, the East River, and the Eastside of Manhattan. The right view is a spectacular panorama my mother ignores by keeping the windows of the room curtains closed all day. This is the way she has lived her whole life, her body and soul always in Puerto Rico. My brother and I, my mother’s twin towers, born prematurely at six months’ gestation after a massive hemorrhage—she claims we plot against her. Although we never waver in our physical, economic, and emotional support, even the twins’ devotion is crumbling under her extreme demands. Two nightmare visits during the 2002 Christmas holidays leave us spent. During the first one she refuses to talk, eat, or open her presents, and she talks about worms promenading across her hands. Her banshee screams make me flee her room on the second visit. My twin, aided by five hospital workers, fights to move this frail eighty-pound woman from the bathroom from which she will not budge to her bed. The forty-five-minute battle concludes with his coming to get me. Distress, anger, and shame struggle within me. Shaking with trepidation, I reenter the room only to be berated by fanatical preaching about how one’s mother is to be venerated, cared for and honored, not abandoned as I am doing. The outrage, fury, and humiliation I feel at hearing these reproaches that have been repeated so often during the last twenty years make me almost flee a second time. My other half, my twin brother, puts a different spin on it. He jokes, drips sarcasm and mockery, imitating my mother’s shrieks and her words to him: “Salte; vete sinverguenza” (Get out, go, you shameless person). When she refuses to eat, he sticks the meat-filled fork in her face, and her fury offers an opportunity for a camera snapshot. Negative attention affirms the existence of a son for whom she only appears to show contempt because he is the most like her now deceased husband. Out of four children, only the eldest and first son merit her devotion and unconditional love. The “others,” as I baptized the rest of us, are a mere nuisance. But now even her relationship with her favorite son has disintegrated. There is only her all-consuming obsession to manipulate, control, and destroy any opposition. I ask myself, “Why is she like this? Had she always been like this and I just did not see it before?” But I do know that this same primitive instinct preserved her and her family in the past. Her own mother relinquished the mother’s role to her eight-year-old daughter, charging her with caring for her siblings, who eventually numbered\n\n30\n\nNelia Olivencia\n\neleven. My mother’s childhood, education prospects, and dreams were shattered at this age, never to be regained. This loss made her determined to instill in her children her survival instincts and unfulfilled thirst for education. Like my father, who was orphaned at age seven, my mother had no childhood. She recalls falling off a stool she used at eight years of age to reach the stovetop to cook. When a spot of scalding water fell on her, her mother responded by beating her. She recalls begging one of her brothers, the brightest one, to teach her the lessons he had learned at school. At night by candlelight, this brother would repeat lessons taught that day. She would hungrily devour the knowledge and the books he shared with her. It was only at forty-five years of age that she completed elementary school in the United States, with other immigrants from places like Italy and Poland. As a teenager I helped her with her homework and attended her graduation ceremony, applauding wildly for her. I loved, admired, and worshiped this woman. She was our sanctuary and protected us the way a lioness shields her cubs. She chased for blocks an older boy who struck me in the head with a baseball. She threw caldrons of boiling water on members of a gang named the Mayrose, a training group for future Mafia members, who broke my bedroom window playing stickball almost every other week, scattering shards of glass over the furniture and floor. When this same group tried to rape me on the backstairs of our building, my screams brought her immediate response. With the meager allowance my father permitted her, every year she scoured the Orchard Street area bargaining for hours to buy her children new Easter outfits. My mother’s constant refrain to me was ”Be proud of being Puerto Rican, and get an education.” But she was also proud of sewing a Black Panther insignia pattern onto my older brother’s jacket, proud of his manly feats in the streets. She served him American meals specially prepared to his tastes while the “others,” the rest of us, were fed typical Puerto Rican meals of rice, beans, and pork chops. A woman of contradictions and ferocity, my mother endured shame and embarrassment during Abuela’s visits from Puerto Rico to the humble three-room apartment that six of us occupied along with small companions—rats, mice, cockroaches, and occasional bedbugs. There was no inside toilet or bathroom, no living room, no heat or hot water. The halls were infested with derelicts and addicts who urinated, defecated, and shot up drugs. My mother and her children lived in such conditions for over ten years. Eventually her mother and other family members from the Island stopped visiting us. No recriminations against her own mother ever surface now, except for the denial of an education that would have catapulted my mother to the\n\nTwin Towers\n\n31\n\nhigher social and economic status to which she aspired her whole life. In later years she impersonated a woman of breeding, covering her rough, wrinkled, worker’s hands with gloves. She emulated the airs and deeds of a lady of the manor or upper class and, like Florence Nightingale or Mother Teresa, dispensed money for which she had scrimped for years to those she felt were less fortunate. With her return to Puerto Rico after forty years of exile in the United States, she became the understudy for her mother’s role. My matriarchal grandmother commanded her tribe of thirteen children, thirty-two grandchildren, and forty-two great-grandchildren, who provided her with a rent-free house, food and other necessities, and a maid after my grandfather died. Less than five feet tall, weighing ninety pounds, and illiterate, Doña Isa, as she was called by everyone including her children, was a cold and unloving woman who ran the farm in Corozal, Puerto Rico, administering harsh corporal punishment to her children on a regular basis and, except for the act of procreation, ignoring her alcoholic and faithless husband. Out of her large brood, three sons became successful businessmen; three daughters, including my mother, escaped to New York City. The oldest son became an alcoholic, a beautiful daughter was lobotomized to deny her sexuality and maintain her virginity, and another daughter was banished and permanently expelled from Puerto Rico because of her “wildness.” The lobotomized Ines, once spirited and lovely, was reduced to the equivalent of a mindless five-year-old child who soiled her underpants, played and sang songs from her youth all day, and at times became physically and uncontrollably violent. Her cruel, heartless fate haunts me and reminds me of the violence that, if prodded, lurks in us all. But in this telling I find only a partial answer to why Mother is now the way she is, always trying to transcend the obstacles of her childhood, her poverty, and the incongruities between her aspirations and reality. Within two years of her return to Puerto Rico, my father’s death ended her shortlived realization of her aspirations for wealth, prestige, social standing, and acceptance. She was left widowed and defenseless, without the necessary tools to maintain her illusions. How could she be the independent woman she thought she was when she could not divide or multiply, comprehend the concepts of fractions and decimals, balance her checkbook, or grasp what interest rates or dividends were? All of these skills are indispensable for economic and social independence. My mother is a woman who wants all or nothing. She wanted all that her mother had in her advanced years—a gift house, a maid—and the right to inherit the mantle of matriarch after her mother’s death, but these never came. In my mother’s world, her life in New York, including her husband and children, was a shabby mirage. Her most recent return to the city was forced upon her because of her incessant demands and the burden she had placed on her extended family—sisters, brothers, cousins, nephews, and\n\n32\n\nNelia Olivencia\n\nnieces. And her own children are irrelevant and useless because they could not ensure the fulfillment of her dreams and expectations. This uncompromising, dominating, and independent varonil (manly) woman has become an unyielding engine of primitive violence. The veneer of any pretense to be anything other than who she is has been forever stripped away. Her humanity and individuality have given way to the raw instinct for survival and performance of basic bodily functions. Loftier concepts like love and acceptable social behavior have vanished, a possible result of the aging process. But it’s also part of her strength and weakness, her unbending will to not conform blindly to the strictures of society in Puerto Rico and the United States, a characteristic inherited by her children. My twin brother’s badgering again prevails over my fear of heights when I give him my involuntary agreement to ascend to the top of the Twin Towers in 1989. As we overlook the city, looming above helicopters, my fear is held at bay by the unnerving yet majestic panorama surrounding me on four sides. I never imagined that the towers would be gone, just as my vision of my family vanished so long ago. My nuclear family was torn apart piece by piece by my widowed mother. My mother’s power emanates from her tightly knit family, where it is expressed to turn son against son, daughter against daughter, son against daughter. This ongoing destruction is as wantonly shocking as the instantaneous disintegration of the towers on September 11. Why do I write? Perhaps to understand myself and perhaps to keep my sanity. Today I talked to my mother, who just turned ninety-one. Over the phone, her high-pitched, cracked voice and the clacking of her false teeth made it difficult for me to understand what she was saying or decipher what was real, what was fancied, and what lay in the world in between. We have always been able to communicate because of my ability to comprehend her at different levels of consciousness, without having to censor myself from listening to her. That is what my sister probably means when she says that I really understand our mother. It is not the fact that she speaks only Spanish—except for a few English words sprinkled here and there to make sure I understand her, something I also resort to at times—but that I listen oh-so-very-carefully to what she says and does not say, the nuances of silence and “tu sabes lo que estoy diciendo.” I am the only one who believes her when she says that she was in the emergency ward because of a heart attack, or that someone attacked her and stole her walker. She is not paranoid or delusional. No, I am not special, nor do I cater to the idea\n\nTwin Towers\n\n33\n\nthat I am the only one who knows what she is saying or that I know her better than my siblings. I just know when it is real. It hurts, and I cannot bear it. My heart starts racing a mile a minute and I think I am going to die. Because I am there in the moment and in her mind, in the reality that she lives as a ninety-one-year-old woman with most of her generation long dead and gone. The Twin Towers have fallen and been covered over. The standoffs, battles, and furious interchanges between mother and daughter are over too, chased off by the specter of her impending death and struggle with living demons. My mother reminisces about her “precocious” and frantically energetic daughter, a child whose unstoppable questioning, curiosity, and physical activity constantly challenged her. But New York exists and my mother lives on. On my most recent trip to New York City, I approach her with trepidation and anxiety. She is frail, with only a short time to live. She might die tomorrow, or in a few years— that is all we can predict, because death gives no notice. The three visits that my daughter and I pay her, for once, are shockingly tranquil, positive experiences. Is this my mother’s response to her own mortality? The indomitable mother-force spins lighthearted tales of her own childhood for her granddaughter, forging the bond between grandmother and granddaughter that had been hindered until now by differences in language, culture, and generations. I am amazed by my mother’s warm reception and by her lucidity in recounting events of our common past and my childhood experiences of want, sadness, and comic tragedy. We recall the Daily News’s front-page photo of a four-year-old Puerto Rican neighbor’s body pierced through by a jutting two-story-tall stake after she fell from a fourth-floor window; the picture in El Diario of the corpse of a young Puerto Rican man lying on the floor of a bar, killed by my second cousin; and the Daily Mirror’s spread on the bullet-riddled body of an Italian hit man and cop killer in a 34th Street hotel, a former member of the Mayrose gang, part of the group that attempted to rape me when I was fifteen. Less public memories include the time that Colorado (Red), a Puerto Rican who later became leader of the Dragons gang, was fed by my mother because he was hungry. Later in his teens, one day he came running through our tenement apartment and up the fire escape to escape from police, who were chasing him from tenement to tenement because he had shot a member of an Italian gang. And we remember how the Egyptian Khalil, husband of one of my mother’s cousins, brought gifts from his wanderings throughout the world to my mother for her kindness and out of respect. More personally, my mother remembers caring for two newborn babies at intervals eight years apart, the children of her “wild” younger sister.\n\n34\n\nNelia Olivencia\n\nThere were five of us then sleeping in one room containing a crib, a piano, a full-sized bed, a television set, and a bureau; I banged against one or another every day. Shared living, shared experiences. This is the first time in my life that I pepper my mother with endearments like chiquita and preciosa and hug her with love and gentleness so as not to cause more cracks to her brittle-boned body covered by translucent skin. I can finally give her love without having conditions or stipulations placed on it. And for the first time in her life, she accepts it willingly and warmly. I leave New York City, for once, with a sense of peace, without guilt or shame, with a feeling of fulfillment at being able to give without being shunted aside, mocked, or berated. I have come full circle, to the trust of a newborn for her mother.\n\nNote\n\n1. My father and mother migrated from Puerto Rico in different years for different reasons. My father came from Mayaguez (a major city on the west coast) with his widowed father in 1925, when he was thirteen years old. They moved to the Bronx, where my grandfather bought a bodega (small grocery store) with the money my father’s deceased mother had willed to her son. My mother fled to Manhattan in 1934 to escape an arranged marriage and to earn money to send back home to her siblings. She worked in the garment district until 1937, when she married my father, whom she had met through a mutual acquaintance. Their children were born in Flower Hospital in the middle of Spanish Harlem. Our birth certificates placed our address at East 110th Street, in el barrio. In the late 1940s the family returned to Puerto Rico, hoping to remain there, but prevented from staying because of my father’s inability to find work. The move back to the Lower East Side in 1947 left the family with financial problems that lasted for many years.\n\nCHAPTER\n\n4\n\nRemembering George Washington on the Rio Grande A. Javier Treviño\n\nThere is an old Mexican custom having to do with a newborn’s driedup umbilical cord that, if we take seriously Émile Durkheim’s (1912) notion of religion as consisting of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, could well be regarded as fraught with religious significance. When the shriveled, black-brown life stem falls off a few days after birth, the parents gently, and with a certain degree of reverence, as though it were a sacred object, bury it near the child’s birthplace. The practice is the burial; the belief is that the child for the rest of its life will be tied—bound—to that place of its birth. I’m told by my parents that my ombligo was buried in the border town of my birth, Laredo, Texas, a city whose character the travelerwriter Paul Theroux has described as “more Mexican than Texan” (1979:39). This is where I spent my formative years. It is also the home I left long ago but to which I periodically return to visit, though never to stay (Treviño 1999).1 Writing of his own experiences in the borderland of the Midwest, Richard Quinney (2001) observes that only by truly attending to life—by intimately experiencing a remembered past and an unfolding present—can one go beyond the borderland. For the sociologist who has left the borderland for the mainstream world—the dominant culture—transcendence of that place of origin means seeing it from a different, a more distanced, perspective. It also means that in returning to the frontier—la frontera—a perspectival shift occurs so that that place, that home on the margin, can no longer represent the social center. This notwithstanding, I remain spiritually and existentially tethered to that border town, and as I return to it with a certain conversance in sociological theory, its people and its culture now appear to me to be off-center, eccentric. With this awareness I now look back to another time, at that city of my birth on the Texas-Mexico border during a very significant period in my 35\n\n36\n\nA. Javier Treviño\n\nlife: my three years in high school, 1972–1975. I consider my experiences as a member of one particular group—the J. W. Nixon High School Band— particularly (though not exclusively) in the context of our band’s participation in a unique ceremony: Laredo’s annual Washington’s Birthday Celebration (WBC). A city. A band. A ceremony. Today, some thirty years later, I remain inextricably tied to them. And so, as a sociologist whose specialty—indeed, passion—is sociological theory, I endeavor to remember, in autobiographical retrospective, and to explain, if only to myself, this time, this place, these events. Laredo, Texas, is situated on the banks of the Rio Grande, the murkybrown, watery demarcation it shares with its sister city in Mexico, Nuevo Laredo. In his superb ethnographic study, his “tale” of the two Laredos, Alan Klein aptly describes this border as “a foot-dragging river barely 200 yards across, cut between two very hot and tired-looking towns” (1997:3). While these two towns—los dos Laredos—are separated by a river and a political boundary, they are integrally bound by culture, language, kin relations, a bridge, and the WBC. Begun in 1898, Laredo’s annual WBC has continued unabated through good times and bad: the Mexican Revolution, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, the 1970s oil crisis. But what is perhaps most intriguing to scholars who have considered the event is that it is celebrated in a city whose population is over 90 percent Hispanic (of Mexican descent) and who are joined by thousands of other Mexican nationals (Cigarroa 1991; Dennis 1997). This eccentricity, however, is something that most Laredoans do not think much about; nor, for that matter, did my friends and I back in the mid-1970s when we participated in the WBC events as members of the J. W. Nixon High School Band. The band was 125 members strong, and we called ourselves La Banda de Animo, the Band with Spirit. And spirited we were. Our pep rallies— those rituals during which we loudly and zealously projected (never blared) our school fight song “Jalisco” (an adaptation of the mariachi song “Ay Jalisco No Te Rajes”)—near our totemic mascot (a statue of a green mustang, reared on its hind legs, positioned in the grassy patch next to the band hall) were truly “animated” social gatherings. 2 Long before I had read Durkheim’s The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, I was experiencing the “collective effervescence”—the shared exaltation and passionate belief—of belonging, truly belonging, to a group: the Mighty Mustang Band. No doubt we believed in ourselves as a performing band, for we had just been awarded Division 1 status in marching, in my freshman year during the fall of 1972. Perhaps more significant, we believed in ourselves as a\n\nRemembering George Washington on the Rio Grande\n\n37\n\ncohesive in-group with our own folkways, our own esprit de corps. We were La Banda de Animo and thus different from other student organizations—Student Council, Slide Rule Club, Speech Club—even while we may have also belonged to some of these groups and pursued various other activities. So too did we inspire (breathe the spirit of life?) school spirit at the football games as we played contemporaneous scores such as “Theme from M*A*S*H” and “Theme from Shaft.” During halftime, which was our time, we performed eagerly and energetically, with true panache, as we executed our signature march, the Chester Step, evoking, at least to my adolescent mind, Don McLean’s enigmatic lyrics in “American Pie”: Now the halftime air was sweet perfume While sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance ’Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died?\n\nWith an average annual rainfall of less than nineteen inches and half of its streets unpaved, Laredo is typically hot and, at least until the 1970s, always dusty. The summer of 1972, just prior to the start of high school for me, was a real scorcher for weeks on end, and the lyrics from America’s “A Horse with No Name” seemed to strike a resonant chord as we practiced— our marching and our music—on the blistering asphalt of the school’s parking lot: The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz And the sky with no clouds The heat was hot and the ground was dry But the air was full of sounds"
