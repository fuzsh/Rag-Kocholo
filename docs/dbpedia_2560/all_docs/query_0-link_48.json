February 2021\n\nx\n\nIntroduction: Irish modernisms in the plural Paul Fagan, John Greaney and Tamara Radak\n\nIn a 1915 article for the New Age titled ‘The Non-Existence of Ireland’, Ezra Pound situates J. M. Synge and James Joyce as modern writers of merit by severing their literary achievements from the island of their birth. ‘A man of genius cannot help where he is born,’ Pound writes, ‘and Ireland has no claim upon Synge.’ Joyce, for his part, ‘has fled to Trieste and into the modern world’, and it is only by thus ‘escaping’ the censorious traditionalism of his native land that he ‘writes as a European, not as a provincial’. In his formulation, Pound insists that ‘a nation’s claim to a man depends not upon the locality of his birth, but upon their ability to receive him’ – based on the Playboy riots, the Hugh Lane controversy and Ireland’s continued ignorance of Joyce, Pound summarizes that he ‘simply cannot accept the evidence that [the Irish] have any worth as a nation, or that they have any function in modern civilization’.1 Noting its resonances with the foundational manifestoes of Joyce’s ‘The Day of the Rabblement’ and Samuel Beckett’s ‘Recent Irish Poetry’, the mid-century literary critic may well have nodded in sage approval of Pound’s implication that there is a profoundly oxymoronic quality to the notion of an Irish modernism – or, indeed, of an Irish modernism. New criticism, which defined modernism in strictly formalist terms, cemented this critical commonplace throughout much of the twentieth century. Over the past three decades, however, the coordinates of modernist studies have been shifted dramatically away from such a delocalized understanding of modernism through a historicist critical drive that conceives of an almost deterministic relationship between literature and the nation state. In their 1995 collection, Modernism and Ireland: The Poetry of the 1930s, Patricia Coughlan and Alex Davis address the ‘insufficient exploration of the fate of modernism in Irish literature after the first modernist generation’ through a sustained focus on the 1930s ‘neo-modernist’ poets Thomas MacGreevy, Brian Coffey, Denis Devlin and George Reavey. The rationale for expanding the Irish modernist canon to include these figures remains somewhat Poundian in its coordinates, if not necessarily in its tone or spirit, as they are foregrounded as ‘anti-realist and internationalist’ experimenters expressing their ‘dissatisfaction with the narrow, anti-intellectual culture of the new Irish state’ and its ‘nationalist, ruralist and bigoted ideology’.2 Formalizing the Irish modernist critical tradition that had in many ways been initiated by the Lace\n\n2\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\nCurtain’s republication of ‘Recent Irish Poetry’ in 1971,3 this reframing of ‘Ireland and modernism’ doubles down on the polemic division between ‘Antiquarians’ and ‘Others’ established in Beckett’s piece, arguing that these second-generation Irish modernists had been de-canonized in favour of the ‘more literalist and self-proclaimed Irishness’ of their contemporaries.4 In certain ways, Coughlan and Davis’s collection marks the culmination of this critical narrative about Irish modernism, as emergent new waves in Irish and modernist studies began to reshape the field. The postmodernist critical wave reclaimed the playfulness of Beckett and Flann O’Brien from what appeared to certain critics to be an elitist, exclusionary and self-serious modernism, and thus provided expanded terms for interrogating this critical concept.5 Emerging alongside the success of postcolonial studies and a renewed historicism, the 1990s saw the significant rise of Irish studies, which historicized and repatriated Joyce and Beckett’s experimental writing from what was seen, broadly speaking, as excessively deracinated paradigms. These studies laboured to overturn Pound’s assertion that Ireland did not ‘produce’ its modernists by establishing the shaping influence on these authors of their sustained, if often contentious, engagements with, and debts to, overlapping debates regarding Irish aesthetics, politics and identities.6 Increasingly, critics perceived modernist qualities in the Revival’s cosmopolitan rejections of realism, materialism and modernity;7 they heard national, even nationalist, notes in Joycean modernism;8 they recovered Beckett’s theatrical debts to the Abbey;9 and they overturned the image of an inward-looking Revival by foregrounding its points of encounter and exchange with European artistic movements. As a result, the mutually exclusive categorization of nationalist, revivalist and modernist thought was problematized, although not overturned. Explicitly or implicitly, this trend was driven by a broader postcolonial critical framework that, in Terry Eagleton’s formulation, drew a more or less direct ‘connection between colonial dissent and modernist achievement’.10 In perhaps the purest refinement of this historicizing and archival tradition, Modernism, Ireland and Civil War (2009), Nicholas Allen resituates Joyce, Beckett and Yeats amidst a diversity of republican and Free State discourses, in the process redefining Irish modernism as ‘an improvising set of responses to the present’.11 The parameters of the field that were forged in these decades – historicist, postcolonial and focused predominantly on a narrow canon of ‘men of genius’ with a growing coterie of supporting characters – were significantly complicated and diversified with the advent of the new modernist studies at the turn of the century. With its taste for a ‘discrimination of modernisms’12 – bad modernisms, late modernisms, geomodernisms and so on – and concomitant push from the centre to the margins of the canon, the new modernist turn refocused the critical lens to look for modernist impulses and creative energies in previously neglected genres, forms and sites of publication or expression. In Irish studies, these vertical and horizontal expansions encouraged closer attention to the diversity of Irish modernist bodies, technologies and ecologies, with a particular critical focus on the modernist bona fides of previously marginalized Irish women writers and a metacritical focus on the reasons for their de-canonization in both critical and publishing contexts.13 Casting an eye across this transformed landscape in their field-shaping 2010 collection Irish Modernism: Origins,\n\nIrish Modernisms in the Plural\n\n3\n\nContexts, Publics, Edwina Keown and Carol Taaffe observe that if ‘the incompatibility of modernism and Ireland gradually became a critical staple, juxtaposing an enlightened internationalism with an insular and conservative nationalist culture’, the newmodernist ‘re-evaluation of local, regional and national modernisms’ had revealed ‘not only the importance of modernism to Ireland, but also of Ireland to modernism’.14 By conceptualizing a plurality of modernisms, both the cosmopolitan drives of modernist production and its irreducibly local qualities became palpable in a non-binary relation. We find ourselves in a moment of profound self-reflection in both modernist studies – as reflected in Bloomsbury’s Historicizing Modernism and New Modernisms series – and Irish studies – as demonstrated in Cambridge University Press’s six-volume Irish Literature in Transition critical anthology (2020) and Paige Reynolds’s declaration of a ‘new Irish studies’.15 These developments have been crystallized in a series of major publications that both cement and reflect critically on Irish modernism as it has shifted from an emergent to a dominant branch of Irish studies. The Cambridge Companion to Irish Modernism, edited by Joe Cleary in 2014, announces Irish modernism’s arrival as a canonical critical field even as it acknowledges the significant complications that arise from an undifferentiated and under-theorized definition in delimiting its subject: ‘what exactly would the term “Irish” encompass in an era during which Ireland underwent a radical and continuous process of political and cultural redefinition?’16 Even as this development of the rubric of Irish modernism encourages more fluid, expansive, nonessentialist definitions of Irishness and modernism, we note that this fluidity continues to be anchored to notions of the historical nation state. In an attempt to pull back from Irish modernism’s critical migration from linguistic and formalist analyses to strictly historicist readings, a 2015 special issue of the Journal of Modern Literature attempted to register a finer ‘balance between history and aesthetics’ by foregrounding Irish modernist criticism as still ‘a matter of hearing language with new inflections or seeing reality differently as much as refashioning history’ – albeit, as noted by guest-editor Jean-Michel Rabaté, as ‘represented by three of its most distinguished authors: Yeats, Joyce and Beckett’.17 In a 2018 special number of the Irish Studies Review dedicated to Remapping Irish Modernism, Deaglán Ó Donghaile and Gerry Smyth encourage critics to maintain these coordinates as guiding lights but to expand the terrain beyond these three writers, with more capacious definitions of ‘Irishness’ and ‘modernism’ that make room for more diverse geographies, languages, genres and media.18 Two 2019 collections further redirected these new modernist drives to rehabilitate the rubric ‘Irish modernism’ under revisionist and expansive definitions: A History of Irish Modernism, edited by Gergory Castle and Patrick Bixby, addressed radio, art, architecture and ecologies through both new and more familiar coordinates and figures; while Science, Technology and Irish Modernism, edited by Kathryn Conrad, Cóilín Parsons and Julie McCormick Weng, further imbricated Revivalist and modernist movements through a focus on their overlapping engagements with media, machinery, body politics and scientific discourse. Taken as a whole, in the broad arc from Pound to these recent collections, the field of Irish modernism has advanced meaningful debates and developed significant methodologies intended to address the field’s critical blind spots and to overturn its own prejudices. The critical narrative of Irish modernism as it has emerged through the conversation between these pioneering works remains tied up\n\n4\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\nwith the politics, ideologies and ethics of canon formation and narrow definitions of ‘Irishness’ and ‘the nation’, as the debate oscillates between the poles of exclusion and inclusion, the global and the local, coterie taste and mass consumption. With the advent of these companions, histories and studies, then, Irish modernism has reached critical and cultural mass. Emerging from the shadow and success of Yeats studies, Joyce studies and Beckett studies, Irish modernism has become an umbrella term which connects these scholarly fields and prompts a network through which related and other Irish modernists and Irish artists in modernity can be brought into, and affect, modernist discussion. The intersection of Irish studies and the new modernist studies – with its expanded canon, geography and time, and its focus on cultural practice in modernity – remains influential to the articulation and development of the term. As a result, Irish modernism has gained traction as a historicist discourse, inspired by postcolonial criticism and overtly preoccupied with the material conditions of artistic practice. The history of the Irish state has thus become the main methodological tool through which Irish modernist practice is and has been interrogated. It operates both as an origin to Irish modernism – Ireland’s history of decolonization19 – and as a means for measuring its continuation in the present. The experimental literary practice of Eimear McBride and Mike McCormack, for example, has been connected to a longer history of modernist production related to Ireland through the rubric of Irish modernism, thus reinforcing the chronological time of the state as a medium through which the development of literary practice in and related to modernity in Ireland can be categorized and narrated. This expanded timeline, which extends from and reaches far beyond the limited but still operative Yeats-Joyce-Beckett genealogy, points to the critical ideologies of reception which have, broadly speaking, governed the structure of this field. Now that this mode of narrating Irish modernism has become dominant and evident, it also becomes a phenomenon worthy of critical scrutiny, particularly along the lines of canon construction and theoretical rubric. Indeed, we might be reminded of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s response to Fredric Jameson’s injunction to ‘Always historicize’: ‘What could have less to do with historicizing than the commanding, atemporal adverb “always”?’20 Responding to the construction of the field by literary and cultural critics in the twenty-first century, Irish Modernisms: Gaps, Conjectures, Possibilities asks the following: What is/was Irish modernism? When was Irish modernism? Where was Irish modernism? Whose modernism was it? To raise and interrogate these questions seriously means also to confront some problematic components of the field itself, beyond, and even potentially within, its welcome drives towards representative diversity. For instance, to what extent has ‘modernism’ become a critically colonizing term, that has come to absorb and occlude other fields and adjacent yet distinct aesthetic movements both temporally (expanding its reach ever further forward and backward in time) and culturally (extending its axioms to global cultures and diverse literatures)? Even as the ascription of ‘modernist’ can leverage critical interest in marginalized writers and texts, to what extent does it do so by occluding the non-modernist aspects and currents in such works? Indeed, given its current, seemingly limitless, capacity for extension and incorporation, what significance and critical value does the rubric of Irish modernism maintain beyond\n\nIrish Modernisms in the Plural\n\n5\n\nmerely acting as a synonym for late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Irish studies? To put the issue more directly: at what point, and under what circumstances and criteria, would we want to resist applying the term ‘modernism’ to any Irish text from this era? And if we are unsure of the answer, what does this tell us of the utility of modernism as an illuminating descriptive category rather than a signifier of cultural and critical capital in a crowded academic market? Is Irish modernism, then, a literary and cultural phenomenon, or a mode of critical narration? If it is the latter, what are the opportunities, as well as the obstacles, of the uncertainty of the canon and field and their capacity for redefinition? How might the rearticulation of Irish modernism profitably diverge from dominant trends in the new modernist studies, which by valorizing historical context in the study of modern cultural production have at times divested modernism of its aesthetic meaning? Moreover, if Irish modernism is a retroactive delineation in twenty-first-century critical discourse about modernism, how do we resist the idea that the artists who inspired the term were wont to consider themselves as Irish modernists? To address these questions, the essays gathered in the present collection ask how new theoretical frameworks and analytical tools can advance such conversations beyond the binaries of form and history. With a focus on lacunae in both its canon and scholarship, Irish Modernisms: Gaps, Conjectures, Possibilities opens the field to necessary further reflection by redrawing its borders and diversifying its critical coordinates within the open-ended period of modernism. Our titular terms – gaps, conjectures, possibilities – cater for problematizing certain enduring suppositions in the field, as well as rethinking its boundaries and theoretical potential. Locating gaps in discourse on Irish modernism, the volume introduces authors, texts and intellectual movements to the debate that have been previously overlooked or sidelined – in particular, drawing attention to the too often marginalized importance of women’s writing and queer expression to the Irish avant-garde, as well as exploring the fluid borders between Irish modernism, popular genre fiction, Irish-language and multilingual texts, and diverse transmedial interfaces between visual, literary, dramatic, cinematic, epistolary and journalistic media and platforms. Offering conjectures, it directly challenges the assumptions of national, aesthetic and temporal canon formation in the Irish modernist critical rubric by drawing attention both to what it foregrounds and to what it excludes. Even as they undertake interrelated close readings of marginalized and neglected Irish modernist figures and genres, the collected essays, in concert, reconsider the unspoken, exclusionary hierarchies and biases of this critical terrain and labour to develop a more attentive and fluid theoretical grammar that breaks free of the reductive binaries that have long governed debate in this field: local/global, tradition/innovation, margin/ centre. Establishing new possibilities of critical inquiry, the volume rethinks Irish modernism and expands its purview by testing its responsiveness to contemporary theory beyond postcolonial and Irish studies approaches. Diverse paradigms ranging from biopolitical modernism and posthumanism to weak theory, queer theory, gender and race studies enable the contributors to rethink Irish modernism’s organizing themes (nationalism, martyrdom, war, state violence, prostitution, temporality, death, mourning) through diverse conceptual perspectives.\n\n6\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\nRather than fixing or effacing the limits of Irish modernism, then, Irish Modernisms: Gaps, Conjectures, Possibilities seeks to render the borders of Irish modernist discourse as multiple, diverse and permeable, as well as constructed and constantly shifting. Irish modernism is thus conceptualized here as a dynamic process, one constituted by exploration – the interrogation of cultural production which always renews the invitation to be thought in different terms – and theorization – the intellectual labour of interrupting and regenerating our conceptual categories to host new knowledge. Even as the conversation around Irish modernism threatens to delimit and categorize these fluid encounters, it also establishes the possibility for newly rethinking, testing and troubling these frames – such is the inspiration for the gaps, conjectures and possibilities proposed in this volume.\n\nNotes 1.

R. Leavis, Richard Ellmann and Harold Bloom, Hugh Kenner’s A Colder Eye: The Modern Irish Writers singles out Yeats for his ‘superior mastery’, foregrounds Flann O’Brien as ‘the greatest living virtuoso of the Irish fact’ and elevates Joyce as the English language’s ‘greatest master since Milton’.2 As one front in the broader literary ‘canon wars’, such evaluative determinations based on the criterion of aesthetic merit came under increased scrutiny in the 1980s and 1990s. Important questions thus resounded: who, exactly, gets to determine ‘the best that is known and thought in the world’ and on what terms, privileging whose aesthetic tastes and to what ends? Are the criteria for aesthetic merit ultimately ideological in nature, markers of class that function, in part, to privilege and maintain power hierarchies? Which voices, aesthetics, perspectives and experiences that do not reflect the values of the critical hegemonic taste are excluded from the Irish modernist canon? As the field shifted from evaluative to representative criteria in response to these and other questions concerning canonicity, a critical challenge was mounted to Irish modernism’s narrow focus on male, urban, English-language authors. From the drive ‘to shine a brighter light into the obscure corners of Irish cultural production in the modernist era’,3 the borders of the Irish modernist canon have recently been redrawn to reveal a wealth of artists and works which had previously been exiled to the critical hinterlands due to the underexamined ideological criteria of ‘aesthetic merit’. Clearly, as demonstrated by the Waking the Feminists, Sounding the Feminists and Fired! movements, and the debate over the ‘prosaic lack of women’ in the 2017 Cambridge Companion to Irish Poets,4 with its dispiriting implication that little had changed since the Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing debacle in 1985, these questions surrounding canonicity and Irish literature remain to be adequately addressed and redressed. The opportunity exists to forge a more diverse canon across aesthetics, genres, genders, languages, sexualities, races,\n\n10\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\nclasses, ages and social milieux. The tasks of expanding, diversifying and reorganizing the canon are now vital driving forces for new research and scholarship in the field. Irish Modernisms: Gaps, Conjectures, Possibilities advances the horizontal expansion of the field by rethinking the canon of Irish modernism and pushing its boundaries beyond previous articulations. The collection initiates a focused reconsideration of the very question of canonicity relative to Irish modernism through a series of close readings of marginalized writers working in diverse genres, languages and intellectual movements. Across the volume, new critical and theoretical attention is drawn to revolutionary figures from Joseph Plunkett to Roger Casement, queer authors from Eva Gore-Booth to Kate O’Brien, women novelists from Jane Barlow to L. McManus, Ulster writers from Forrest Reid to Brian O’Nolan, illustrators from Harry Clarke to Pamela Colman Smith, popular writers from Seosamh Ó Torna to Liam O’Flaherty, and Irish-language authors from Pádraig Ó Séaghda to Máirtín Ó Cadhain. Working with this diverse range of variously under-analysed and neglected test cases allows contributors to examine with greater precision and metacritical rigour the points of encounter and divergence between the distinct genres, movements and cultural spheres that are increasingly grouped under the rubric of Irish modernism: from the New Woman writers to revivalism, from science fiction to Irish-language and diglossic modes. At the same time, rethinking Irish modernism through the diverse genres and movements of these liminal figures and movements compels us to reconsider the position of the ‘major (Irish) modernists’ – Synge, W. B. and Jack B. Yeats, Joyce, Beckett, MacGreevy, Bowen – in this reconstituted canon. As they significantly advance the project of revising the Irish modernist canon and redrawing its borders, the essays gathered here concurrently break new ground by reflecting on the limits of this expansive impulse itself, particularly by theorizing its function and value beyond narrower questions of biography, history and national identity. As necessary as recent correctives have been to normative and exclusionary canonical formations, some feminist cultural historians and literary critics, such as Joanna Scutts and Katie da Cunha Lewin, have begun to ask also whether the rhetoric of the critical ‘rediscovery’ of marginalized writers, voices and views can itself be limiting, as well as liberating. At the metacritical level, a too strong critical narrative of past neglect and current liberation can erase the work of previous generations of scholars. Regarding the authors and texts themselves, Scutts registers her concerns that the current critical drive towards the ‘rediscovery’ of ‘neglected’ women writers might be ‘tethering women too forcefully to their biographies, at the risk of diminishing their artistic achievements’ while ‘limiting our recovery efforts to the women who fit a certain outlook, a certain style, a certain politics’, even potentially doubling down on ‘the power structures at work in the literary world’5 in the process. Lewin suggests that even as we continue to recover the very real and enduring ways in which de-canonized writers ‘living under heteropatriarchy were subject to misogyny, racism and homophobia’, we need to further theorize how, by ‘always relegating work by women to the forgotten zone, we risk only understanding them in this way’.6 At stake is not only the Sedgwickian debate between ‘paranoid’ and ‘reparative’ modes of reading,7 or, indeed, the reductive dualism of ‘normative’ and ‘activist’ critical engagement, but the need for a theoretical grammar more finely attuned to significant, if challenging, ethical, methodological and\n\nContested Canons\n\n11\n\ntheoretical questions about the core axioms and assumptions of Irish modernist canon expansion, as well as its continued unexamined biases. Part One pushes new ground on these debates by addressing gaps in previous formations through the test cases of Hannah Berman, Ethel Colburn Mayne, Mary Devenport O’Neill, Sheila Wingfield, Freda Laughton and Rhoda Coghill. Rather than raising the names of these marginalized, liminal figures only as signifiers of a narrative of critical neglect and rediscovery, the essays that open the collection undertake close, theoretically and metacritically reflective readings of the implications for these authors – and for the rubric of Irish modernism itself – regarding their incorporation into the canon, as well as the stakes of allowing them to maintain a liminal, partial, adjacent Irish modernist status. At the same time, the test cases of the more familiar names of Elizabeth Bowen, Samuel Beckett and Máirtín Ó Cadhain allow the contributors to re-examine the theoretical limits of the canon in terms of recent developments in the fields of nonhuman studies and Irish-language modernism. The section’s re-evaluation of the porous and movable limits of the Irish modernist canon along a number of interrelated axes also draws attention to the peculiarities of Irish modernist temporalities. J. C. C. Mays, as Anne Fogarty notes, ‘has postulated that modernism in Ireland is a broken formation, at once proleptic and belated’: arriving prematurely amid the ‘social and political upheavals of post-Famine Ireland’ and making its ‘presence felt post hoc’ in the late modernist period from the 1930s to the 1970s.8 By exploring works at, and beyond, the standard temporal limits of modernism as ‘breaking points, points of nonsynchronism’9 in the broad critical narrative of Irish modernism, and by acknowledging the diverse sites of modernist production and their impact on the critical assimilation of this work, these five chapters mark the resituation of Irish modernist studies. John Brannigan, author of Race in Modern Irish Literature and Culture,10 opens the collection by exploring the work of Hannah Berman as an Irish Jewish writer whose major publications coincided with the rise to prominence of James Joyce. Brannigan considers Berman’s work in the context of debates about ‘Ethnic modernism’, ‘Jewish modernism’ and recent investigations into Irish Jewish writing to foreground the still under-analysed constructions of ethnicity, race and cultural nationalism in the early twentieth century that worked to shape Irish modernism into culturally dominant forms. By asking ‘Is there a home for the work of Hannah Berman in Irish modernism?’, this chapter mounts a meaningful challenge to the spatio-temporal focus of The Cambridge Companion to Irish Modernism and Remapping Irish Modernism, inquiring not only where and when Irish modernism occurred but also ‘whose modernism is it?’ Elke D’hoker, co-editor of the pioneering collection Irish Women Writers: New Critical Perspectives and author of Irish Women Writers and the Modern Short Story,11 interrogates the test case of the now largely forgotten author Ethel Colburn Mayne within and against the canon of Irish modernism. As examples of the birth of the modernist short story in the variegated literary and aesthetic movements of the fin de siècle, Mayne’s collections offer complex and sensitive treatments of the gender norms that shape identity, individual creativity and social relations in the transition from New Woman to modernist paradigms. Concurrently, D’hoker argues, the difficulty of assimilating Mayne’s national, literary and temporal hybridity to a single\n\n12\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\nliterary tradition offers a productive challenge to the very conceptualization of Irish modernism. For even if the honorific of ‘Irish modernist’ can rescue Mayne from critical oblivion in the current academic market, we must be wary of reflexively subsuming the distinct strands of her art – aestheticism, naturalism, symbolism, impressionism, New Woman writing – into an undifferentiated and indiscriminately expanding Irish modernist canon. Lucy Collins intervenes into current debates about the place of the woman poet within received understandings of Irish modernism and the Irish literary tradition through a thematic focus on melancholy and mourning in Mary Devenport O’Neill, Sheila Wingfield, Freda Laughton and Rhoda Coghill. Building on her field-defining work in Poetry by Women in Ireland: A Critical Anthology 1870–1970 and Contemporary Irish Women Poets: Memory and Estrangement,12 Collins here shows how these latemodernist Irish women poets of the 1930s–50s craft complementary and contrary poetic images of the relationship between the speaking subject and her environment. By these means, they show themselves to be aware of the fragility of their own literary status and of the aesthetic preconceptions that governed the reception of their work. Their lives and texts reveal the complex relationship between critical orthodoxy and singular creativity, and the impact of this relationship on the place of their work within Irish literary tradition. Maureen O’Connor’s chapter picks up the thread of Collins’s ecocritical reading to interrogate the limits of death, the human and ‘the metaphysics of finitude’ in Elizabeth Bowen’s fiction. Drawing on nonhuman studies, new materialism and critical posthumanism – theoretical paradigms rarely applied to the field of Irish modernism – and her own pioneering work in The Female and the Species: The Animal in Irish Women’s Writing,13 O’Connor traces the interrelated significance of Bowen’s preoccupation with the trope of haunting and her animist attention to the life of things. Pressingly, O’Connor challenges us to consider the limitations of the anthropocentric focus of received accounts of Irish modernism – with their postcolonial focus on questions of uneven development structured by the metanarrative of the nation state – and the opportunities of rethinking Irish modernism beyond humanist discourses. Finally, Eoin Byrne’s chapter examines Irish modernism’s multilingual history as a fruitful site for probing the very contours and boundaries of literary modernism, particularly as we witness the ‘vertical expansion’ of the new modernist studies. Too often, perhaps, Irish modernism’s status as a multilingual phenomenon is underplayed: Wilde, Synge, Devlin and Beckett reading, composing and translating in English and French; Joyce writing in English, lecturing in Italian and collaborating on the French translation of ‘Anna Livia Plurabelle’ (never mind the polyglot languages of Finnegans Wake); Liam O’Flaherty, Brendan Behan and Brian O’Nolan writing in English and Irish, with the latter’s Cruiskeen Lawn columns incorporating French, Latin, German, Japanese, among other languages. The power dynamics of major and minoritized literatures animate Irish modernist expression, Byrne contends, as modernism’s scepticism regarding the signifier is accentuated in the case of Ireland, with debates over suitable languages and forms stemming back to the foundation of a modern national literature. By reading Beckett’s French-language nouvelle ‘La Fin’ contrapuntally with Máirtín Ó Cadhain’s Irish-language short story ‘Fuíoll Fuine’,\n\nContested Canons\n\n13\n\nByrne identifies a distinctive brand of late modernist Irish literature, one that is as much in thrall to wider transnational paradigms as it is a cultural response to the early decades of independence in Ireland. In the conversation staged between these five chapters, the interrogation of canonicity serves not simply to relocate the borders of Irish modernism but rather to test, to complicate and to multiply the limits of the canon itself.\n\nNotes 1.

In The Cambridge Companion to Irish Modernism, a benchmark in itself of the institutionalization of a scholarly field, Joe Cleary favours ‘the more capacious conceptions’ of Irish modernism, as ‘it was from the outset a decidedly transnational phenomenon’.1 This was evidently true of the canonical triumvirate of Irish modernist studies – Yeats, Joyce and Beckett – but the Companion also stakes this claim on the basis that much of what had appeared insular about the Irish Revival was a vernacular rendering of modernism as a global cultural phenomenon. As Michael Valdez Moses argues in the collection’s final essay, ‘the divide between nativists and cosmopolitans in early-twentieth-century Ireland was often more rhetorical and symbolic than substantive’.2 Through the spatial lens of the new modernist studies, Moses shows that even D. P. Moran’s ‘Irish Ireland’ philosophy proves to have cosmopolitan bearings. The spatial turn is foregrounded more explicitly in a special issue of the Irish Studies Review devoted to ‘Remapping Irish Modernism’, in which Deaglán Ó Donghaile and Gerry Smyth describe an Irish modernism still readable ‘in terms of size, scale, distance, terrain and perspective’ in relation to the ‘cardinal points’ of Yeats, Joyce and Beckett, but which needs to be remapped to account for a more expansive cultural landscape: ‘The modernist note is sounded in Doolin as well as Dublin, Portlaoise as well as Paris; we should learn to listen to it.’3 Critical work to open out the terrain of Irish modernism has responded diligently to the new modernist question ‘where was modernism?’ – a successor to Raymond Williams’s equally productive question of ‘when was modernism?’ Yet, the where of Irish modernism perhaps too often evades an equally pertinent question posed more recently by Sara Blair, namely ‘whose modernism is it?’4 Blair asks this question of a complicated, entangled history of the almost invisible role of Yiddish culture in the formation of American modernism. To ask, ‘whose modernism?’ in the context of Irish modernism might seem already familiar. After all, the current discourse of Irish modernism has largely been sparked by an extensive critical process of reclaiming Yeats, Joyce and Beckett from their tacit assimilation into narratives of British, European or international modernism. In one sense, ‘Irish\n\n16\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\nmodernism’ is a proprietorial response to the question ‘whose modernism?’ However, the act of claiming the ‘Irish’ in Irish modernism raises difficult questions about the extent to which, in the process, other modernisms, or the modernisms of others, are occluded. Finding a home for occluded migrant authors in the expanding house of Irish modernism may be a magnanimous gesture, but it risks continuing a troubling legacy of appropriation. This is a particular danger in the case of Jewish artists and authors, for whom, as Hannah Arendt observes, exploitation or oblivion were the alternate fates of those recognized or unrecognized within a ‘host’ tradition.5 This essay examines the work of Hannah Berman as a distinctive exemplar of intersecting modernisms, as an Irish Jewish writer whose major publications coincided with the rise to prominence of Joyce and Irish modernism, but whose significance lies in her inventions of a Yiddish folk tradition in English. Berman was a prolific short story writer and translator and the author of three novels. Moreover, she was an influential cultural mediator between the Yiddish cultural movement and English-language modernism and between Jewish nationalism as a cultural and political movement and the Irish Revival. Yet, her achievements have largely been neglected due to the methodological limitations of scholarly disciplines attached too closely to metropolitan and nationalist models of cultural territoriality. As Natalie Wynn has argued, Irish Jews seem to be consistently overlooked in ‘the bigger tapestry of Jewish culture and history’, too small a community to be seen as culturally or politically significant.6 Berman’s fictions were almost exclusively about Ashkenazi Jewish communities in the Russian ‘Pale of Settlement’, and perhaps as a result, her work has not figured at all in histories of Irish cultural production of the early twentieth century.7 Unaccountably, however, her work has also not featured in the emergent field of Irish Jewish Studies: neither Abby Bender nor George Bornstein’s recent books on early-twentieth-century Irish-Jewish literary interrelations even reference Berman’s existence, for example.8 This fate is particularly unfortunate given that Berman strived to mediate between the intersecting cultures of Jew and Gentile, Yiddish and English, Jewish and Irish nationalism, migrant and host, tradition and modernity. Yet, it is her complex negotiation of a space for Yiddish cultural nationalism within the emergent forms of Irish, Jewish and AngloAmerican modernisms which this essay argues is deserving of contemporary critical attention when we address the question of ‘whose modernism is it?’\n\nThe life of an Irish Jewish writer Hannah Berman was born in Veckshni (Viekšniai) in Lithuania in 1885, the third child of Levi and Ethel Berman.9 The Bermans emigrated in the early 1890s, in common with many Lithuanian Jews, fleeing from poverty and persecution.10 Levi Berman came first to Dublin alone, but within eighteen months, after starting business as a pedlar of drapery and footwear in Limerick and Athlone, he was able to bring his wife and children from Lithuania to join him.11 Hannah Berman describes the route as served by a ‘filthy cattle-boat that sailed from Bremen with an ever-growing complement of emigrant Jews’.12 From Bremen, the boat sailed to Hull, and from there, the Bermans made their way to Dublin. In a typical case of chain migration, the Bermans chose\n\nBerman, Jewish Nationalism and Irish Modernism\n\n17\n\nDublin as Ethel’s sister and brother-in-law had already moved there and had had some success in establishing a prosperous business.13 The extent of Berman’s education is unclear. She attended a national school in Dolphin’s Barn, and ‘after that she was self-taught’, according to anecdotal family history.14 Her father acquired very little English, and she recorded some of his ingenious ways of communicating the requirements of his business without it.15 However, by the age of fifteen, Berman was showing signs of her literary talent, winning the Hampstead Foundation Prize for an essay she wrote entitled ‘The Temple’.16 In the 1901 census, the Berman family was listed as resident in Dufferin Avenue, Dublin, a relatively comfortable middle-class street, and employing one domestic servant. Berman, aged sixteen, is described as a ‘scholar’. As a young woman, she began to participate in Zionist cultural and political organizations in Dublin, including the Jewish Ladies’ Society and the Daughters of Zion Association.17 She began to publish articles, stories and translations in international Jewish newspapers and magazines, including the Jewish Chronicle (London), The Sentinel (Chicago), the Jewish Exponent (Philadelphia), the Jewish World (London), The Maccabaean (New York) and extensively in the Reform Advocate (Chicago). By 1911, Berman had secured sole rights to translate the work of leading Yiddish writer Sholem Aleichem (pen name of Solomon Naumovich Rabinovich) into English, and it is for her translations of Stempenyu (1913) and Jewish Children (1920) that she became most widely known.18 In the 1911 census, aged twenty-six, she still resided with her parents and younger siblings, although in a less prosperous address in Arnott Street, and with no domestic servant. The street was home to other Jewish families, including another Irish Jewish writer, Joseph Edelstein, author of The Moneylender, who also lived with his parents and siblings. Berman’s occupation is listed as ‘Journalist, Fiction’. Between May and November 1911, she published her first novel, The History of Joseph Sackenovitz, in serial form in the Reform Advocate.19 This was followed in 1913 by her novel Melutovna, published as a book in London by Chapman and Hall. Around this time, Berman began to engage more closely with the Irish literary Revival. She read two of her short stories, ‘My Guest’ and ‘Breneille’s Little Love Affairs’, at a meeting of the National Literary Society in February 1913, alongside Katharine Tynan and Rutherford Mayne.20 Berman published a short story in the Irish Review in 1912, and a translation from Aleichem the following year.21 Berman was already familiar to Jewish communities in England before she moved permanently to London in November 1914, perhaps in the expectation of developing her literary career.22 She had given lectures to Zionist association meetings in London, Manchester and Liverpool several years before. In London, she established herself among a group of Anglo-Jewish writers and artists, including Joseph Leftwich, Lazarus Aaronson, Jacob Epstein and John Rodker, and was a founder member of the Jewish Association of Arts and Sciences (JAAS) in 1915. To many in this group, she is described as ‘a sort of mentor’, having established her reputation with Melutovna and her translations of Aleichem.23 Berman served in various administrative roles in the JAAS, as secretary and vice president, for example, but she also ran the literature section, which met on a weekly basis to criticize and nurture original works by the rising generation of Jewish writers.24 Her connections with Ireland did not end: she published\n\n18\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\nthree short stories in Seamus O’Sullivan’s Dublin Magazine in 1923–4. However, her work henceforth was mainly centred on London, where her stories and translations were published in two significant modernist magazines, the English Review (1918, 1919) and Ford Madox Ford’s Transatlantic Review (1924). She published her third and final novel, Ant Hills, with Faber and Gwyer in 1926. Berman visited Palestine in the late 1920s and travelled to the Soviet Union in 1934, specifically to see the Lithuanian lands of her childhood and her ancestors.25 The Soviet Union then supported Yiddish as a proletarian language, although this would end before the Second World War.26 Berman appears to have become less active as a writer thereafter, although she continued to give talks on Yiddish literature to Jewish women’s and workers’ groups throughout the 1930s, almost disappearing from view by the 1940s. Berman died on 20 February 1955, at her home in London. In his obituary, Joseph Leftwich remarks that Berman had for some years lived completely withdrawn due to illness.27 Her final publication appeared shortly after her death, an English translation of I. A. Lisky’s The Cockerel in the Basket. Berman’s ambition, Leftwich claimed, had been to create Yiddish folk-writing in English, an ambition which she clearly understood within a broader framework of Jewish nationalism.\n\nFrom the shtetl to the city: The politics of cultural translation All three of Berman’s novels, most of her short stories and much of the work she translated into English are set in the same historical and mythological space of the Jewish shtetl in Lithuanian Russia. The significance of this setting is clear from the first page of The History of Joseph Sackenovitz: It rarely happened that anyone in the village of Trepofky, whether he was a free Jew or a Gentile bound for life, took the responsibility of the initiative upon himself. No one ever dreamt of defying the public opinion which held sway over everyone alike. One generation after another was perfectly satisfied that there was only one mode of living – the mode they followed, the mode that their forefathers had followed before them. Their habits, manners and ways of thinking had remained practically unchanged for hundreds of years. While the rest of Europe made haste to cover itself with the cloak of modernity, the villages within the Russian pale of settlement held onto the old fashions – the fashions which had been for the most part imposed on them by the great Catherine when she conceived the idea of cooping the Jews up in a tiny corner of her empire late in the eighteenth century.28\n\nAs Irving Howe argues, the shtetl occupied a key place in the literary imagination of Ashkenazi Jews.29 It was based upon the small towns into which the Jewish communities of Lithuanian Russia had been increasingly compelled to live in the nineteenth century, with their seemingly timeless conditions of poverty, precarity and persecution, but which were also heavily mythologized through Yiddish folk writing and culture as highly formalized, static and outside of history. For a novelist, the shtetl provided a\n\nBerman, Jewish Nationalism and Irish Modernism\n\n19\n\nknowable community rooted in a deep unchanging past, ripe territory for the stock-intrade conflicts between individual and society, tradition and modernity, which defined the novel as a genre. Yet, forby the formal suitability of the shtetl as a fictional setting, Berman’s work is invested in its ideological significance for the Ashkenazi migrant communities. For Jordan Finkin, the shtetl has a crucial place in twentieth-century Jewish political ideologies as ‘a central site of modern Jewish spatial thinking, the object of longing and loathing, revelry and revilement, revelation and renunciation’.30 The shtetl as an idea, as a myth, is invariably the product of the migrant imagination. The Yiddish pioneers of shtetl writing – Aleichem, Sholem Abramovitsh, Isaac Leib Peretz – had all migrated to cities and were influenced by the Haskalah, the Jewish enlightenment. Berman’s intervention in the shtetl genre could hardly have been more marked by its modernity. Written in Dublin in the English language, her first novel was serialized in a Chicago magazine, interspersed with advertisements for hosiery, insurance and stationery. While she begins by placing her reader in the very shtetl setting which embodies ‘a conscious sense of being at a distance from history’,31 she insists upon historicizing it, revealing the ‘old fashions’ which define the shtetl as themselves imposed historically. As Dan Miron argues, the realist conventions employed by shtetl writers led critics to read their fictions as direct, mimetic presentations of premodern Jewish communities in Eastern Europe, yet like the realist authors to whom they have been compared – Balzac, Tolstoy, Dickens – their work is evidently a great deal more selective and artful than this naïve method of reading implies. As a pioneer of writing and translating shtetl works into English, it is important to recognize Berman as belonging to, if not inaugurating, the turn to what Jeffrey Shandler calls the ‘postvernacular’ phase of the Yiddish conceptualization of the shtetl, not as an idea corresponding to a lived reality but ‘as a subject of discourse and cultural creativity’.32 So too, as Thomas Ferraro has argued of realism in the work of American ‘ethnic’ writers of the early twentieth century, there is a compelling case for seeing such work as modernist not in its formal qualities but in its complex negotiation of ethnicity, dislocation and modernity.33 To read the shtetl in Berman’s work as a discursive phenomenon is to attend to its symbolic and metaphorical functions. Although often apparently rooted in folk narratives and historical realism, Berman’s writing frequently draws upon symbolism. This is particularly evident in her short stories, in which figures such as horses, butterflies, weeds and rust are used to explore shtetl ideologies and social structures.34 In Melutovna, the shtetl is the subject neither of nostalgia nor of historical realism but a symbolic setting for conflict between the modernizing merchant, Simson, and the conservative orthodoxy of Jeremiah, who risks exposing the town to Russian persecution rather than tolerating Simson to deviate from ‘the traditions their fathers had handed down to them’.35 The central protagonist, Zelda, Simson’s second wife, has come from a Jewish family who live in isolation deep in the woods and is subject to the whims and scant mercies of the Russian landlord. This background enables Zelda to fulfil a key narrative function of having the social and cultural patterns of the Jewish community in Melutovna explained to her. In common with Aleichem and Abramovitsh, Berman constructs the shtetl of Melutovna as an almost exclusively Jewish town, in which relations with non-Jews are few and almost always pose a threat\n\n20\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\nto the community. This ‘Judaization’ of the shtetl (a more heterogeneous community in actuality) might be regarded, as Miron suggests, as an instance of ‘Jewish chauvinism’,36 but instead it indicates the ideological function of the shtetl in migrant communities in debates about the nature and politics of Jewish nationalism. The idea of the shtetl as a specifically Jewish community enables Berman to place her readers at the heart of a fictional exploration of the contested and ambivalent space of Jewish futurity. In the course of the narrative, Melutovna ranges across several possibilities: Jeremiah poses the vision of a hermetically sealed orthodoxy ruled strictly in accordance with the laws of the Talmud; Simson offers the secular prospect of obtaining through wealth the ability to raise up the Jewish community from their servitude and is heralded as ‘the promoter of new industries, and the benefactor of the whole district’;37 the novel also envisions the darker portent of pogroms and persecution of the Jews as a result of a cholera epidemic for which they are blamed by the Christian peasants. Along the way, Melutovna introduces characters whose symbolic function is to raise questions about memory and forgetting, devotion and secularization, fate and agency, exile and annihilation. For Berman, the shtetl scenes to which she constantly returns are likely to have been deeply ambivalent personally. Were those scenes from her childhood symbolic of a lost home, representing a unity and tradition difficult to recreate in the alien and relatively cosmopolitan environment of Dublin? Or were they instead a negated space, what Finkin describes as ‘a reality to be denied on the road to an ostensibly worthier homeland’?38 Berman was heavily committed to political and cultural organizations for promoting Jewish nationalism and Yiddish culture, and these questions are deeply political as well as personal. For Miron, the ‘classical literary image of the shtetl’ may be a deeply affective terrain, but it is importantly always a displaced, symbolic image of Jewish community: ‘a tiny exiled Jerusalem … the Jewish polity par excellence’.39 In Ant Hills, Berman shows this microcosmic Jewish polity and its internal struggles between religious conservatism and progressive materialism, orthodoxy and assimilation. The Bildungsroman begins with the protagonist, Kopel, being scolded by his father for enjoying the sounds of birdsong in the fields: ‘all of the pleasures of this world are made to ensnare the soul’.40 In his youth, however, Kopel’s imagination of a better world is inspired by the ‘modernists’ of the village, who believe that the Jewish people should embrace the search for wealth, knowledge of mathematics, geography and literature, as well as ‘modern’ languages such as Russian and German. To gain their admiration, he writes a ‘little song’, a simple Romantic expression of yearning for a symbolic spring when ‘on us poor Jews the pleasant sun/ Will shine in streams of light.’41 For writing this song, Kopel and his family are denounced as ‘epicureans’ by the village elders, and Kopel is ostracized. The novel concludes with a bitter scene in which Kopel, having moved to another village and married the granddaughter of a seemingly wise and benevolent elder, is again denounced as an ‘epicurean’ for daring to aspire to a better life and is forced to divorce his wife and leave the village. Set in the 1830s in the same Lithuanian Jewish setting as her previous novels, Ant Hills is nevertheless a fictional exploration of early-twentieth-century debates within Jewish nationalism about the future of the Jewish polity.\n\nBerman, Jewish Nationalism and Irish Modernism\n\n21\n\nAs Shandler contends, ‘the shtetl is Zionism’s anti-home; in conjurings of Yiddishland, it is the Ur-home’.42 Berman’s writings capture exactly this ambivalence in shtetl discourse, which is itself the ambivalence within modernism, between the desire for the new which is at the same time a return to the past, a messianic new Jerusalem which differs not at all from the old Jerusalem as it has been preserved by the faithful through the ages. Kopel’s mother professes, ‘The whole life of the Jew is, alas, nothing but an anticipation of the to-morrow’,43 yet that tomorrow cannot deviate from the traditions which are fiercely protected by the community from the threat of change. Kopel’s final banishment comes after he has expressed his desire to live not for tomorrow but for today.44 Yet, Berman is not simply embracing this same modernity (by writing in English, in the novel genre) and critiquing the conservative ideologies of Ashkenazi communities. Rather, her fiction explores what Scott Spector calls the ‘antinomies’ at the heart of both Jewish modernism and Zionism: ‘the paradoxes of tradition and innovation, the destiny of essential character and the promise of a radical break from it, discomfort with a “present” modernity above all’.45 Berman historicizes these antinomies to understand them as products of the intensely precarious conditions under which the Lithuanian Jewish communities lived and from which they were increasingly forced to flee. In her work as a translator, Berman can be understood as caught within this paradox of Jewish modernism herself. She was Aleichem’s first English translator and chosen by him to be his ‘authorized’ translator across the English-speaking world. As such, she was a pioneer in bringing Yiddish literature and culture into the English language. Vernacular literature in Yiddish was itself relatively new, especially fictional writing, so Berman was translating a modern development in Yiddish, not a tradition or canon. Yet, the writers she translated were shtetl writers, and her translations served to connect those Jewish migrant communities who did not speak or read Yiddish with the idea of a tradition and culture from which they felt lamentably cut off. As Olga Litvak argues, ‘every new translation from the Yiddish opens Sholem Aleichem’s work to a new audience even as it registers the tragic diminution of Jewish culture’.46 Litvak makes this observation of post-war translations of Aleichem, but it is equally the case for the readers of Berman’s translations in the early twentieth century. There is a significant burden of responsibility on the shoulders of the translator when it comes to Aleichem and other shtetl writers, for one is not translating just the work of one author for readers in another language but attempting to transmit and renew what is perceived to be the inherited culture of a people from one generation to another, connecting the past, present and future of Jewish culture across a linguistic, historical and geographical divide. Creating a home for the Jewish people, Berman understood, was as much about finding a home in other languages as other places.\n\n‘so many misapprehensions’: Translating Yiddish in Ireland Perhaps there is much to be made of Berman’s experiences as a writer and translator by way of analogy with Irish Revival writers, who were just as preoccupied with the\n\n22\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\ntransition from rural to urban social structures, the task of embodying folk traditions in modern literary forms and the politics of translating the distinctive idioms of a minor and endangered language into English. So, too, the global patterns of Berman’s publications, which followed the diasporic routes of the Ashkenazi peoples to the UK, the United States, South Africa and Australia, might be compared to the publication networks of the Irish diaspora. The analogy did not escape Berman’s attention. It is clear from an interview that she gave in 1914 to the Jewish Chronicle that she saw the Irish Revival as an analogous enterprise to her own endeavours to promote Yiddish literature and culture, and as an inspiration for what Yiddish may achieve translated into other European languages: Look at the great part which the Irish school of dramatists are playing in the dramatic world to-day. Yiddish drama and fiction have a wider soil to flourish in and have taken deeper roots than the English-Irish drama of to-day. Why, then, should I not expect still greater things from them?47\n\nIt is already implicit in this comment, however, that the grounds for comparison between Yiddish and Irish revivals are in no sense an indication of commonality or common cause. They have different roots and flourish in different soil. The horticultural metaphors hint at a racial understanding of cultural difference, even though Berman and the most prominent Irish Revivalists were working in the same language. When Berman published her short story ‘Nothing – and Nothing’ in the Irish Review in 1912, her accompanying note puts the relationship between Jewish and Irish cultures in equally estranged terms: I do not know if any Irish Magazine has ever printed a Jewish story by an Irish Jewish writer. We Jews have never yet explained ourselves to our hosts; and so many misapprehensions have arisen from time to time. If I can succeed in clearing away the least of them I shall feel more than satisfied.48\n\nThe text itself is perhaps an odd choice to explain Jewish culture to Irish readers. ‘Nothing – And Nothing’ is the story of an old woman in a Lithuanian village weary of the monotonous and empty existence she shares with her husband. It is implied that her repetitive pronouncement that her childlessness and loneliness are ‘really, nothing – and nothing’ conceals a more profound sense of emotional despair. Read as an attempt to ‘explain’ Jewish culture to ‘our hosts’, the story might be understood as an illustration of the stoical character of the Lithuanian Jewish people or as an insight into emotional repression. However, Berman’s comment has wider significance for how we might view her role as a writer, mediating between cultures and mitigating ‘misapprehensions’. In her own unpublished memoir of the Irish experiences of her family, ‘Berman Story’, Berman clearly took some delight in the stories she knew from her father of his arrival in Ireland and his attempts to earn a living as a pedlar in Irish towns and villages. It is a story replete with misapprehension. Levi Berman was frequently mistaken for an Irishman, as he had flaming red hair. If it became clear that he did\n\nBerman, Jewish Nationalism and Irish Modernism\n\n23\n\nnot speak English and was a foreigner, he was sometimes understood to be Italian. On one occasion, Berman recalls, he was mistakenly arrested by the police when he was standing watching a hayrick which had been set ablaze by Land Leaguers. When the police questioned him and got no response – he did not understand a word they said – they assumed from his red hair that he was an Irishman and was being belligerent. When they eventually realized that he was a foreigner, he was released, and, Berman says, the police were always friendly to him in that area thereafter.49 This, she writes, was a surprise to him, as he was more familiar with the brutality and corruption of the Russian police in Lithuania. However, there is a story Berman does not tell of her father’s experiences with the police in Ireland. It is possible that she was unaware of it, although she may also have been eager to present a cordial account of Irish-Jewish relations. In March 1895, a police constable arrested Levi in Bessborough Avenue, Dublin, for using profane language.50 Levi believed that he was being arrested for pedlaring and objected as he had a licence.51 The constable then assaulted Levi and hauled him violently through the streets to the police station. At some point on the way, the constable brutally beat Levi over the head with his own walking stick, causing Levi to bleed profusely from the wound. On seeing the arrest, a bystander asked what the man’s occupation was, to which the constable answered that he was a Jew. Two Jewish men who tried to intervene on Levi’s behalf were also arrested. Levi was fined by the police for using profane language, but the case became newsworthy when he and the two other Jewish men took a cross-summons against the constable for assault and wrongful arrest. The constable was eventually found guilty of illegally arresting and assaulting Levi and fined for his conduct and for perjuring himself in court.52 The courts may have corrected the injustice done to Berman’s father, but the violent antisemitism he experienced at the hands of a Dublin policeman must have struck him as uncomfortably reminiscent of the Russian Pale. Was this then the kind of ‘misapprehension’ which Berman sought to clarify in her fictional writings and in her engagement with Irish readers and audiences? If she knew of this story, it is intriguing that in her memoir she chose to tell the story of how Levi was mistakenly arrested as a Land Leaguer and not of how he was beaten and arrested as a Jew. Berman’s writings in Irish magazines can be read productively as a critical intervention in early-twentieth-century literary and political debates about the analogies between Irish and Jewish experiences.53 It is significant in this regard that one of the stories in the Dublin Magazine in 1923, ‘The Charity Box’, is one of the few she published which focuses not on the intimacies of Yiddish folk culture but on the nature of antisemitism. In ‘The Charity Box’, Berman’s narrator is an antisemitic, misogynist refugee, fleeing from war aboard a train packed full of Jews who have been driven out of their villages. The conditions on board are unbearable: ‘The air was thick with the stench of hundreds of people lying on top of one another – sighing, groaning, wailing, cursing and praying.’54 It is an image which might be read as horribly prescient of the Holocaust, perhaps made more so by the accompanying illustration by Irish Jewish artist Harry Kernoff of emaciated, skeletal bodies packed together in the darkness of a goods wagon. This was not prescience on Berman’s part, but a fictional representation of the conditions of oppression and displacement in which the Russian Jews had lived\n\n24\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\nfor decades. The story centres on an old Jewish man who tells the narrator about having to leave his village after he had attempted to steal from a charity box to buy food for his starving wife and children. Yet rather than showing pity or compassion, the narrator turns in disgust from this ‘strange jew, who was, after all, only a tearful old woman’.55 The history of antisemitism in Russia was not unknown in Ireland in the early twentieth century, of course, and persecution of the Jews in the Russian Pale was frequently reported in Irish newspapers. It was the famous Land Leaguer himself, Michael Davitt, who wrote the most detailed English-language account of the persecution of the Jews in Russia in his 1903 book Within the Pale. Davitt advocated strongly for civic equality, freedom of movement and elementary education for the Jewish population – these were the only means by which he could see Russian Jews being assimilated.56 The Russian state’s solution, he observed, appeared to prefer extermination or emigration. He did not believe that equality, freedom and educational provision were likely to occur under the tsarist system. Perhaps not surprisingly, given his own nationalist convictions, Davitt emerged from his journeys through the ‘economic concentration camp’ in which Jews were confined in the Pale an ardent believer in Zionism.57 For Davitt, a fundamental and disturbing problem in the relations between Russia and its Jewish minority was the persistent superstition that Jewish people committed the ritual murder of Christian children. No amount of rational argument appeared to displace such myths, and Davitt called upon the Tsar, the Pope and the Austrian Emperor to publicly denounce what he called this ‘murdermaking legend’.58 In Melutovna, when the Jewish community is threatened with an angry mob of Christian peasants who blame the Jews for poisoning the wells and spreading sickness and death, Zelda seeks out the local Christian priest to persuade him to denounce this belief. He refuses, perversely deciding that her appeal for his help is proof of the guilt of the Jews, who harbour the dark secret of ritual murder: ‘You can hide nothing from us, though you talk in an accursed lingo that only the devil himself can understand.’59 If Berman’s villains sometimes veer towards the pantomimic, they nonetheless reveal that her fictions are engaged in deeply political questions about the nature of antisemitism and its historical and cultural consequences for the relationship between Jewish communities and their ‘hosts’.\n\nConclusion: Whose modernism? Finkin argues that ‘one of the pivotal ideological debates among Jewish intellectuals in the late nineteenth century involved how to formulate the connection between Jewish communities and the lands they inhabited’.60 An important corollary of this argument is that Jewish modernism, in common with other ‘ethnic modernisms’, cannot be isolated as taking place outside of, or autonomously from, the cultural discourses of the ‘lands they inhabited’.61 Irish modernism also emerged out of debates about the relationship between ethnicities, communities and the territories they inhabit. The degree to which Jewishness and Irishness could inhabit the same space was, of course, a key theme in Joyce’s Ulysses, as well as in John MacDonagh’s The Irish Jew.\n\nBerman, Jewish Nationalism and Irish Modernism\n\n25\n\nIn the Jewish Chronicle interview, conducted in Dublin shortly after the publication of Melutovna, Berman’s Yiddish is described as being ‘as fluent and as free from bookishness as is the English which she knows how to use to good effect. But it sounded strange to hear Yiddish spoken with a soft Irish brogue.’62 Berman attributes the success of her fictions to the characters she got ‘direct from life’ and ‘drawn from local people’ in Dublin.63 Asked about her education, she replies that it was ‘acquired while tramping the country roads’, accompanying her father on his travels around Ireland as a drapery salesman.64 Of course, these statements should be understood in the context of a rare interview, published in the Jewish Chronicle, which was widely read by Jewish communities around Britain and Ireland; they are perhaps reflective of a strategy on the part of a young female Irish Jewish writer to deflect attention away from her own achievements and ingenuity as an author. However, they serve to remind us that Berman’s fictions, although invariably focused on the Jewish shtetl communities of West Russia, were intimately drawn from her experiences of living in Ireland and later in England. Is there a home for the work of Hannah Berman in Irish modernism? Is the work of Hannah Berman at home in Irish modernism? These are not just questions of how capacious we can make Irish modernism, or how transnational we can extend its scope (as if it were simply a question of the generosity of the host). Berman’s IrishLithuanian-Jewish-Yiddish-English modernist-realist-folk writing poses challenging questions about the capacity of any conception of culture based on territorial, ethnic or national formulations to explain or encapsulate the heterogeneity and ambivalence of her work. Perhaps, as Werner Sollors argues of ethnic writers in America, modernism provided a home where the host nation did not do so unambiguously.65 In any case, the intersecting modernisms at work in Berman’s writing raise the very question of what constitutes a home, whether it is in the imagined past of the shtetl, the alienated present of the migrant or the illusory tomorrow of religious and political discourses. This question has a bearing on the muted concepts of ethnicity and territoriality within Irish modernism, even if Berman’s work was never intended to find a home there, for, as Theodor W. Adorno argued of the exiled of modernity, ‘it is part of morality not to be at home in one’s home’.66\n\nNotes 1. Joe Cleary, ‘Introduction’, in The Cambridge Companion to Irish Modernism, ed.

In that essay, Ford praises the ‘Yellow Book School’, which ‘concerned itself with form, with the expression of fine shades, with continental models and exact language’.1 He refers to the ‘chef d’Ecole’ of the movement, ‘Henry Harland, another American of French training’, but then notes, ‘The real motive power of this very important movement came from Miss Ethel Colburn Mayne – another Irish writer of French training.’ Mayne is then singled out for special praise as a ‘great, or, at any rate, a consummate, artist’: To-day Miss Mayne stands alone as a portrayer of the fine shades of civilized contacts – as a portrayer, then, of life as it is lived by you and me … no one will deny that his life is really a matter of ‘affairs’; of minute hourly embarrassments; of sympathetic or unsympathetic personal contacts; of little-marked successes and failures, of queer jealousies, of muted terminations – a tenuous, fluttering and engrossing fabric. … And, now that Mr James is dead, there seems to be only Miss Mayne in England who has the perception and the great skill to be the historian of this our fugitive day.2\n\nThough Ford may have exaggerated Mayne’s role in the Yellow Book,3 he was certainly not alone in praising her work. In reviews, Mayne’s short fiction was routinely – and favourably – compared to Henry James and Katherine Mansfield, while her translations and biographies met with great acclaim. Today, however, she is almost entirely forgotten. Tina O’Toole mentions Mayne as a New Woman writer with Irish roots, alongside such more familiar names as Sarah Grand, George Egerton and L. T. Meade but does not discuss her work.4 Given Mayne’s involvement with the Yellow Book as co-editor and contributor, she certainly deserves the epithet of New Woman writer. Yet, as she continued to publish fiction and non-fiction into the 1930s, she could also be classed as an Irish, or Anglo-Irish, modernist. Following the expansion of the new modernist studies ‘in temporal, spatial and vertical directions’,5 Irish modernism too has extended its remit in recent years to\n\n30\n\nIrish Modernisms\n\ninclude the famous high modernists as well as their fin-de-siècle precursors, Irish émigré writers as well as Irish Revivalists, highbrow experimentalists as well as more middlebrow practitioners.6 This reconsideration of Irish modernism has opened up the traditional modernist canon to several marginalized writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, many of them women. Anne Fogarty discerns ‘two significant phases within the history of women and Irish modernism’:7 A first phase, extending from the 1880s to the 1930s, includes writers like Egerton, Katherine Cecil Thurston, Lady Gregory and Dorothy Macardle, who ‘marry political activism, feminist advocacy and engagement in the public sphere with artistic experimentation’.8 A second generation, comprising Elizabeth Bowen, Maeve Brennan and Kate O’Brien, is considered ‘less politically active than its predecessors’, even as it carries forward ‘the modernist quarrel with literary form while continuing … to unpick the ideological stances that insist on the fixity of gender roles and of national and sexual identities’.9 In this essay, I make a case for Ethel Colburn Mayne to be added to the tradition of Irish modernism in this newly expanded scope. Born in 1865, the same year as W. B. Yeats, Mayne belongs to Fogarty’s early modernists, sharing with these writers a commitment to artistic experimentation and an openness to the literary movements of the time: aestheticism, naturalism, symbolism, impressionism. Although Mayne is less outspokenly feminist and politically active than some of the other writers discussed by Fogarty, her fiction persistently explores the gendered norms that shape the female body, determine feminine behaviour and govern social interactions. Her characters struggle with the contradictory requirements of feminine coquetry, harmonious matrimony and self-effacing motherhood. They often self-consciously play up to these gendered expectations even as they worry about the implications for establishing meaningful relations, intellectual freedom and a true sense of self. While these themes clearly come out of Mayne’s engagement with fin-de-siècle New Woman debates, they are also part of the ‘feminist concerns’ that characterize the work of other female modernists, as they supplement or challenge ‘the views of sexuality and femininity put forward by male artists’.10 While Mayne’s feminocentric fiction shares some thematic concerns of both the early and the late modernists described by Fogarty, the narrative and stylistic features of her short fiction illustrate the continuation between the late-nineteenthcentury impressionist and naturalist movements and modernist innovation.11 Within an Irish framework, her writing provides a unique connection between the New Woman stories of Egerton and Grand and the late modernist short fiction of Bowen, Brennan and Norah Hoult. Mayne’s first two short story collections, The Clearer Vision (1898) and Things That No One Tells (1910), offer many illuminating examples of the birth of the modernist short story in the variegated literary movements of the 1890s, while also revealing a highly complex and sensitive treatment of questions of identity, gender and social relations that anticipate the short fiction of Bowen and Brennan. Before turning to the stories, however, I will first give a brief overview of Mayne’s life and work.12\n\nEthel Colburn Mayne\n\n31\n\nA literary life in Cork and London Ethelind Colburn Mayne was born in Johnstown, County Kilkenny in a Protestant, Anglo-Irish family. When her father became Resident Magistrate in Cork, the family settled in Blackrock. A voracious reader, Mayne kept abreast of new literary developments in London, and in 1894 she sent the story ‘A Pen-and-Ink Effect’ to the Yellow Book, which had been launched with much publicity earlier in the year.
