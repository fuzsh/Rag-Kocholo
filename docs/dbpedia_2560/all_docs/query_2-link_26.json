        "text": "With \"Ford v Ferrari\" making car companies sexy again and \"The Irishman\" stirring interest in Jimmy Hoffa disappearance theories, Detroit is back in the cinematic limelight.\n\nNeither of these films was shot in Michigan. Yet one invites viewers into Henry Ford II's ultra-masculine executive suite in Dearborn. The other takes audiences to where Jimmy Hoffa was last seen, the old Machus Red Fox restaurant in Bloomfield Township — well, the fictional version, since the peaceful country lane depicted in \"The Irishman\" is nothing like Telegraph Road's multi-lane congestion.\n\n\"Ford v Ferrari\" and \"The Irishman\" belong to a decades-long collection of films with scenes that unfold in the Motor City region, the state's bucolic west side or the quirky woodlands of the Upper Peninsula. Not all of them were filmed here. Yet some of the most authentic examples were, stretching geographically from \"8 Mile\" to \"Escanaba in da Moonlight.\"\n\nTo celebrate this legacy, we're presenting a list of 50 essential movies set in Michigan. It focuses on those stories that actually unfold here, not ones shot locally that take place elsewhere (see \"Batman v Superman,\" the superhero clash set in Gotham and Metropolis) or that use our locations as a jumping-off point to other environs (like 1993's \"True Romance,\" the cult-hit road trip that begins in the D).\n\nSometimes, we broke the guidelines if a film's cultural impact can't be denied. Yes, \"Beverly Hills Cop\" spends only a few scenes in Detroit. But the classic 1980s comedy starring Eddie Murphy has done more to publicize the city than, oh, maybe 90% that did make the cut.\n\nWe hope you'll vote for what you think are Michigan's 10 greatest movies. (The ballot is at the bottom of this story.) The results will be presented on Jan. 5, along with commentary and context from some top Michigan movie experts. As for \"Ford v Ferrari\" and \"The Irishman,\" we're still debating whether enough of their narrative takes place in our pleasant peninsula to qualify. Maybe we should put them in a sequel: the 50 best portrayals of Detroiters on the big screen. See you in 2020.\n\n'8 Mile' (2002)\n\nMarshall Mathers had won over the rap universe. Who knew he would do the same with acting in what, so far, is his only major movie role? The reviews hailed Eminem for his honest, sensitive performance as Jimmy Smith Jr., aka B-Rabbit, who works at a stamping plant and lives in his mom's trailer, stuck in a cycle of poverty and lacking confidence to win rap battles. \"With his music, Eminem succeeded beyond any fantasy. Now his screen debut shows that he has it in him to become an authentic movie star,\" wrote Time's Richard Schickel, the dean of critics, at the time. The late Curtis Hanson provided the superb direction that set this character study apart from other Hollywood attempts to connect with the hip-hop generation. The song \"Lose Yourself\" went on to win an Oscar and 8 Mile became global shorthand for the racial divide that still exists in Detroit.\n\nDetroit detail: Although \"8 Mile\" was filmed entirely in the 313, the scenes at the Shelter, where Eminem got his real-life start, were done in an empty factory posing as the Saint Andrew's Hall basement.\n\nMore: Eminem's '8 Mile' anniversary event draws fans and cast members, but no leading man\n\n'Evil Dead' (2013)\n\nThree metro Detroit pals — Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell — launched the famous horror franchise with the 1981 original about five Michigan State University friends whose trip to a secluded cabin turns into a gory nightmare of unleashed terror fueled by the discovery of an ancient book of the dead. While the original's script referred to something evil lurking in \"the wooded mountains of Tennessee,\" director Fede Alvarez's 2013 reboot, done with the founding trio's blessing and producing participation, takes place in Michigan, according to Tapert. He told the Free Press in 2013 that audiences can assume the cursed cabin is somewhere in Michigan (and Flint does get a mention, indicating it was the starting point for the trip to terror).\n\nDetroit detail: While the remade \"Evil Dead\" had a wide release across the country, the original took more than a year to reach theaters after its fancy premiere at Detroit's Redford Theatre.\n\n'Gran Torino' (2008)\n\nClint Eastwood starred in and directed this box-office success that still stands as a high point of Michigan's film incentives heyday, which stretched from about 2008 to 2011 (before the state GOP's opposition caused the program to lose steam and, eventually, be eliminated in 2015). Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a recently widowed, openly racist Korean War veteran whose prejudice is challenged by his relationship with a Hmong teenager who tries to steal Walt's beloved vintage Ford Gran Torino. Over time, the angry old man becomes friends with the young man and faces his own war trauma. The original setting of Nick Schenk's script was Minneapolis, which is home to a large Hmong community, an ethnic group that arrived here from Southeast Asia. But Michigan's lucrative new incentives lured Eastwood to Detroit, where he filmed in the Grosse Pointes, Royal Oak, Highland Park, Center Line and more. The finale of Eastwood's Gran Torino car cruising down Lake Shore Drive is as gorgeous as a Pure Michigan ad.\n\nDetroit detail: The scene where Walt's son asks him for help getting Lions tickets is supposed to illustrate that his family members visit only when they want something. For Lions fans, however, it was more like a joke, given the team's 0-16 record for the 2008 season.\n\n'RoboCop' (1987)\n\nThe story of Alex Murphy, a Detroit cop who's shot to pieces by a vicious gang and put back together as an invincible cyborg, had multiple layers of meaning. Part futuristic Western and revenge fantasy a la \"Dirty Harry,\" the violent action film took satirical swipes at Ronald Reagan's economic and foreign policies. Like \"Wall Street,\" released the same year, it cast a harsh light on corporations, in this case Omni Consumer Products and its robot-driven law-enforcement schemes. And there was another layer: Director Paul Verhoeven saw religious aspects to Murphy's death and sci-fi resurrection. Although Detroit was scouted as a possible location, Verhoeven found his futuristic look in Dallas (and filmed some old factory scenes in Pittsburgh).\n\nDetroit detail: Screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner always envisioned the Motor City as the location, both to symbolize an older industrial city ready for transformation and to evoke its trademark product. As Miner told the Free Press in 2011, \"RoboCop is kind of like an automobile, right? Shiny. Designed.\"\n\n'Semi-Pro' (2008)\n\nIn 1970s Flint, Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell), the owner-coach of the hapless Flint Tropics, launches a do-or-die effort to leave the struggling American Basketball Association and land a spot in the NBA. Underdog comedy \"Semi-Pro,\" costarring Woody Harrelson and Andre Benjamin, gave Ferrell an excuse to wear disco-funkadelic clothing, wrestle a bear and attempt a death-defying leap over a line of cheerleaders. In real life, Ferrell credited the director, Kent Alterman, who at one time worked with Michael Moore on the series \"TV Nation,\" with deciding to film some of the project in Flint and Detroit.\n\nDetroit detail: Nearly a decade after \"Semi-Pro,\" Alterman (then head of Comedy Central) gave the OK for Sam Richardson and Tim Robinson to film the sitcom \"Detroiters\" in Detroit.\n\n'Blue Collar' (1978)\n\nA rare big-screen dive into working-class America, Paul Schrader's directorial debut boasts a knockout cast — Harvey Keitel, Yaphet Kotto and comedy icon Richard Pryor, who's magnetic as a dramatic actor — and a compelling conflict. Three assembly-line workers in need of money (and sick of greedy bosses and crooked union chiefs) plan to steal the contents of a safe at the auto union's headquarters. Schrader, who wrote the scripts for \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull\" (and recently directed 2017's acclaimed indie \"First Reform\"), faced enormous challenges on the \"Blue Collar\" set. As the Ringer put it, \"Schrader and Pryor, for example, fought so ferociously that Schrader was at one point triggered to have a nervous breakdown.\"\n\nMichigan moment: Schrader, who hails from Grand Rapids, filmed partly at Detroit locations, including Ford's River Rouge plant, and at the Kalamazoo Checker Motors plant that manufactured Checker cabs.\n\n'Hoffa' (1992)\n\nThe star team of Jack Nicholson (in the title role), David Mamet (the screenwriter), and Danny DeVito ( who directed and played a fictional Hoffa lieutenant) seemed to bode well for this biopic of Jimmy Hoffa, who built the Teamsters into the biggest labor union of its time and disappeared in 1975 in what remains an unsolved mystery. But the ambitious effort didn't wow audiences or critics. Plus, it spent only a brief stretch of time in Detroit, the city synonymous with Hoffa's rise and fall.\n\nDetroit detail: Mostly shot in Pittsburgh, \"Hoffa\" worked in Detroit in March 1992. It used the Detroit Public Library as a substitute for a Senate office building in Washington D.C. And the former Detroit News building at Lafayette and Third, built in 1915 from an Albert Kahn design, was selected to simulate a 1950s newsroom, complete with real-life Detroit News staffers dressed in period clothes and serving as extras.\n\n'Sparkle' (2012)\n\nIn November 2011, Whitney Houston described Detroit as \"a great temporary home\" in an email to the Free Press. A few months later, the 48-year-old music icon — who reportedly was happy and purpose-filled on the set — would die in California of an accidental drowning in a hotel bathtub (with cocaine and heart disease as contributing factors). The tragedy cast a shadow on this Detroit-made reboot of the 1976 cult hit about a singing sister act. In what was a comeback effort for the troubled diva, Houston played the mom of \"American Idol\" winner Jordin Sparks (who had the title role originally played by Irene Cara). It was Houston's first feature film since 1996's \"The Preacher's Wife.\"\n\nDetroit detail: Houston, whose battles with addiction were widely publicized, is luminous as she sings an emotionally powerful version of \"His Eye Is on the Sparrow.\" The scene was done at the Iroquois Avenue Christ Lutheran Church in Indian Village.\n\n'Detroit' (2017)\n\nThe box-office performance didn't match the hopes of the unblinking, horrifying re-creation of the Algiers Motel incident, a night of racist violence and police brutality during Detroit's 1967 riot that resulted in the killing of three unarmed black teenagers. Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow (\"The Hurt Locker\") brought her usual dedication to realism, however painful, to what essentially is a war story. But her participation also raised questions about whose story it was to tell. In the end, not enough moviegoers wanted to experience the story to give it a chance at awards or a wider audience. There were about three days of filming in Detroit and Hamtramck (plus one day in Mason, near Lansing), but the Boston area was the main production site.\n\nDetroit detail: Actor Algee Smith, who plays one of the young men trying to survive the night at the Algiers Motel, sings a poignant anthem, \"Grow,\" at the film's conclusion. In the music video, Smith is joined by Larry Reed, the man he portrays, and the onetime Dramatics member central to the film's story. It was reportedly the first professional music work done by Reed since he left the Dramatics after the brutal 1967 evening.\n\nWatch: 'Detroit' actor Algee Smith teams with the Dramatics' Larry Reed on new song\n\n'It Follows' (2015)\n\nThis melancholy, claustrophobic and very terrifying thriller follows a teenage girl whose backseat fling with a seemingly nice guy results in her being stalked by an otherworldly creature. The only way to save herself? Pass on the curse by having sex with someone else. Director David Robert Mitchell, who grew up in Clawson, shot his acclaimed indie film mostly in Detroit's suburbs, achieving a hauntingly lovely portrait of middle America as a hidden nightmare.\n\nDetroit detail: The nail-biting scene where actress Maika Monroe is tied to a wheelchair in the middle of what appears to be an empty concrete parking structure was shot at the abandoned Packard Plant in Detroit.\n\n'White Boy Rick' (2018)\n\nThe complex, convoluted, and controversial story of Richard Wershe Jr. — a Detroit kid recruited at 14 to be an FBI informant and sentenced at 18 to life in prison for a drug crime — was condensed into a gritty, R-rated drama starring newcomer Richie Merritt as Rick and Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey as his conflicted father. Earnest but overstuffed, the movie attempted with limited success to cover issues like poverty, race, the war on drugs and the purpose of incarceration in its portrayal of the 1980s Detroit drug world. Except for minimal location shooting in the Motor City, the production stuck to the Cleveland area.\n\nDetroit detail: Eminem considered playing Wershe in the mid-2000s in what would have been a follow-up to \"8 Mile,\" according to Scott Burnstein, a consultant for \"White Boy Rick\" and producer of the 2017 documentary \"White Boy.\"\n\nMore: 'White Boy Rick' event has family drama on screen — and in the theater\n\n'Dreamgirls' (2006)\n\nThe Dreamettes girl group (much like the Supremes) is guided to stardom by a young entrepreneur named Curtis Taylor Jr. (much like Berry Gordy Jr.) from Detroit (looking much like Detroit, but not really, since most scenes were filmed in Los Angeles except for some exteriors done by a second unit). Beyonce, Jamie Foxx and, especially, Eddie Murphy as a faded star make a big impression in this adaptation of the 1981 Broadway hit. But it is Jennifer Hudson as Effie, the Dreamettes member who is heartbroken after being replaced (much like ex-Supreme Florence Ballard), who gives the musical its gravitas.\n\nDetroit detail: In the journey from stage to screen, the Dreamettes' hometown was changed from Chicago to Detroit, thus hewing more closely to the Motown origin story.\n\n'Roger & Me' (1989)\n\nThe documentary that put Michael Moore on the cinematic map is enraged, irreverent and heartfelt in its critique of what General Motors did to his Flint hometown by closing plants and essentially abandoning the city to poverty. Moore employs the techniques here that made him famous (and later won him an Oscar for \"Bowling for Columbine\"), mixing news clips and reporting with startling moments like \"Newlywed Game\" host and Flint native Bob Eubanks making offensive comments. The running gag was Moore's attempt to confront GM boss Roger Smith. Call it the start of Moore's pact with viewers that he'll never bore them — and never give up criticizing the injustices of corporate America and politics.\n\nMichigan moment: Moore's visit with a Flint resident who's surviving financially by selling rabbits for \"pets or meat\" was so disturbingly gripping that the director titled his PBS short film that revisited \"Roger & Me\" characters \"Pets or Meat: Return to Flint.\"\n\n'Searching for Sugar Man' (2012)\n\nThe Academy Award for best documentary went to the unlikely saga of Detroit's Sixto Rodriguez, a gifted singer-songwriter who was supposed to get his big break with the 1970 album \"Cold Fact.\" Despite its strong hooks and socially relevant lyrics, the record bombed. Years later, a bootleg copy wound up transforming Rodriguez into an inspiring icon in apartheid-era South Africa. Finally, thanks to the doc and the Oscar, everyone realized that Rodriguez was a star.\n\nDetroit detail: The footage of Rodriguez walking the streets of his Woodbridge neighborhood still speaks to everyone who loves the real Detroit, not its glossy pockets of upscale development.\n\n'Detropia' (2012)\n\nOscar nominees Heidi Ewing (originally from metro Detroit) and Rachel Grady captured the city on the brink of bankruptcy with their documentary, which made the Academy Awards shortlist. As a Rust Belt elegy, it's a thoughtful, hauntingly lovely look at the toll taken on a former industrial powerhouse by globalization, racial inequality and a fleeing white population. But it goes deeper by focusing on specific Detroiters, a video blogger, a nightclub owner and a now-retired UAW local president, and their struggles to move forward while honoring the truths of the past. \"Detropia\" was among many films at the 2012 Sundance festival that took on the state of the American dream after the economic recession.\n\nDetroit detail: The title was inspired by a shot in the film of an auto parts store sign that had been changed by an artist to read \"utopia.\"\n\n'Detroit Rock City' (1999)\n\nFour teenagers from Cleveland embark on a desperate quest to see Kiss perform at Cobo Hall and are thwarted by misadventures at every turn. There's a nostalgic stoner vibe to the 1978-set story line and appearances by future \"Russian Doll\" star Natasha Lyonne, plus the four members of Kiss. Toronto's environs sat in for the Motor City, so Cobo is played by a coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario. Also, there is no WURP radio station (the giver of Kiss contest tickets) in the D.\n\nDetroit detail: The hyper-strict mother who opens the film by burning her son's Kiss tickets is played by native Detroiter Lin Shaye, who's best known for the \"Insidious\" horror films.\n\n'Paper Lion' (1968)\n\nThe greatest movie ever made about the NFL preseason, according to Vice, stars Alan Alda as author George Plimpton, who wrote the book of the same name about his famous attempt at trying out for a quarterback job with the Detroit Lions. The scenes of the Lions training camp (which occurred in that era at Cranbrook schools in Bloomfield Hills) were done in sunny Florida. Lauren Hutton made her acting debut in \"Paper Lion,\" as did numerous real Detroit Lions of the 1967 team, including Alex Karras, who would transition later to an acting career. We'll leave it to Vice to weigh in on why the very real problems of the city, which had just been through the 1967 riot, aren't addressed here: \" 'Paper Lion' dances around this context with the same blinkered determination that the Lions franchise has shown in dancing around success over the last half-century.\" Ouch!\n\nDetroit detail: \"Paper Lion\" hasn't been released on DVD and is rarely aired on classic movie channels. But it was screened at the Redford Theatre for the 2018 Freep Film Festival.\n\nMore: Freep Film Festival: Paper Lion, George Plimpton back on big screen\n\n'Bird on a Wire' (1990)\n\nGoldie Hawn and Mel Gibson starred in this mediocre action comedy that defied logic on, well, all levels. Hawn is a lawyer based in Detroit. Gibson is a dude who looks amazingly like her fiance who vanished 15 years before (and unbeknownst to her, entered the witness protection program after revealing a dirty DEA agent). They meet cute at a gas station and, with the baddies after him again, have all sorts of improbable adventures that could be unfolding in Generic Town, U.S.A.\n\nDetroit detail: Filmed mostly in British Columbia, the movie contains one of the greatest geographic flubs ever, namely the scene where Hawn and Gibson board a car ferry that takes them from Detroit (on the east side of Michigan) to Racine, Wisconsin (opposite the west side of Michigan). Um, that's how many days, weeks, months via the various Great Lakes?\n\n'Don't Breathe' (2016)\n\nAs a way to escape their impoverished Detroit neighborhood, three teens attempt to rob the home of a blind man (Stephen Lang) reputed to be sitting on a pile of cash. This taut crime scarefest is from director Fede Alvarez (who also did the 2013 \"Evil Dead\" reboot). The thrills come when the would-be thieves are trapped inside the house with a very dangerous Lang.\n\nDetroit detail: The bulk of filming was done in Budapest, Hungary, but some exterior footage was shot in the Motor City. And in a neat twist, a replica of the yellow brick house in Detroit that serves as the blind man's home was constructed on a Budapest soundstage.\n\nMore: 'Don't Breathe' is latest movie to use Detroit as its scary setting\n\n'Mr. Mom' (1983)\n\nThank the economic recession of the 1980s for the city's role in this solid comedy written by future teen-film titan John Hughes and starring Michael Keaton as a laid-off automotive engineer in suburban Detroit who's forced to become a stay-at-home father when his wife (Terri Garr) returns to her job at an ad agency. The result is a genial romp through incompetent dad cliches, topped by Keaton wearing a gas mask to deal with the aftereffects of his toddler eating a can of chili.\n\nDetroit detail: Besides Garr's Michigan sweatshirt, Keaton's small talk about the Lions and a long shot of the Ambassador Bridge, there's an unexpected Motown link. Producer Lauren Shuler was working for the L.A.-based Motown Productions, the film and TV arm of Motown Records, when she reached out for ideas to Hughes, a Michigan native who grew up in Grosse Pointe. His anecdotes about taking care of his own kids sparked the movie's concept.\n\n'The Five-Year Engagement' (2012)\n\nChef Jason Segel and budding academic Emily Blunt are happily engaged in San Francisco when their wedding plans are put on hold by a move to Ann Arbor, home of a post-doctorate psychology program for her. While her career thrives, he's forced to take any job he can get — namely, working behind the counter at Zingerman's Delicatessen. Will true love survive University of Michigan campus life? The smart rom-com mostly avoids easy answers. FYI: Director Nicholas Stoller's wife went to grad school at U-M and her parents have taught there — novelist Nicholas Delbanco in the creative writing program and Elena Delbanco in the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.\n\nMichigan moment: Production designer Julie Berghoff had to re-create the interior of Zingerman's at another location for the inside scenes, with help from Zingerman's, because the real deli's layout was too tight for the cameras. Exteriors were shot at the popular eatery located at the corner of Detroit and Kingsley. \"People who are obsessed with Zingerman's, which is most people, will recognize that there's something that's a little off (in the interior),\" Stoller told the Free Press in 2012.\n\n'American Pie' (1999)\n\nThe king of the raunchy teen-sex comedies, \"American Pie\" follows a group of friends as they try to lose their virginity before graduating from high school in Michigan. Jason Biggs, Chris Klein and Seann William Scott lead the young cast, with classic turns by Eugene Levy as Biggs' concerned dad and Jennifer Coolidge as Scott's cougar mom. Screenwriter Adam Herz made the film's East Great Falls High School a tribute of sorts to his alma mater, East Grand Rapids High.\n\nMichigan moment: Um, does the Michigan license plate on Kevin's (Thomas Ian Nicholas) car count? And the kids talk about going to college in Ann Arbor and East Lansing. P.S.: Not surprisingly, when \"American Pie II\" requested licensing permission from the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, it was rejected by both schools.\n\n'Somewhere in Time' (1980)\n\nChristopher Reeve is a modern-day playwright who uses hypnosis to journey back to 1912 during a trip to Mackinac Island’s Grand Hotel to meet his true love, Jane Seymour, a celebrated actress of the era. Can they overcome the objections of her controlling manager (Christopher Plummer) and the whole time-travel thing? Critics tend to be critical of sweeping romantic fantasy, but fans still treasure this lush gem filmed on the island. The score by composer John Barry was worth the cost of a ticket alone.\n\nMichigan moment: “Somewhere in Time” fans still gather annually at the Grand Hotel, with the next weekend event set for October 2020.\n\n'The Crow' (1994)\n\nThe bleak portrayal of Detroit as a Goth-style wasteland was visually arresting. But the accidental shooting on the set and subsequent death of rising actor Brandon Lee, the son of Bruce Lee, overshadowed the stylish fictional tragedy of this comic book adaptation. The Crow is Lee’s character, Eric Draven, who comes back from the dead to seek revenge for the brutal killing of himself and his fiancée on Devil’s Night in Detroit. In a heartbreaking coda, the film was dedicated to Lee and his fiancée.\n\nDetroit detail: The artist-writer of original “Crow” comic book series, James O’Barr, was so upset by Lee’s death that he couldn’t go back for rewrites to the North Carolina production site, where mistakes involving the use of a prop gun led to Lee’s fatal injury.\n\n'Out of Sight' (1998)\n\nGeorge Clooney and Jennifer Lopez locked together in the trunk of a car, turning a prison escape into a sexy flirtation. What’s not to like? The A-list team of director Steven Soderbergh and writer Scott Frank made what’s arguably the best adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel. And we're willing to make that argument by citing Clooney’s charmingly roguish performance as a bank robber, Jennifer Lopez’s strong turn as U.S. marshal Karen Sisco, and the standout supporting cast of Don Cheadle, Ving Rhames, Steve Zahn, Albert Brooks and Dennis Farina.\n\nDetroit detail: To get Leonard’s beloved Detroit right, Soderbergh and team filmed in the city at the Kronk Gym, the State Theatre and the then-Coach Insignia restaurant on top of the Renaissance Center, which the director made look like the hottest dining experience imaginable (a feat that the sky-high eatery never could quite pull off on its own).\n\n'The Virgin Suicides' (2000)\n\nDirector Sofia Coppola made her big-screen debut helming the adaptation of a novel by metro Detroit native Jeffrey Eugenides. In the old-money suburb of Grosse Pointe in the late 1970s, five teenage sisters (one of whom is played by Kirsten Dunst) are scrutinized by a group of neighborhood boys who never grasp their complexity. When the youngest sister takes her own life, things get even bleaker and more symbolic of adolescence as a mystery and a prison.\n\nDetroit detail: Coppola employed Toronto’s suburbs as the privileged, stately homes of Grosse Pointe. But the novel itself was tied inexorably to Detroit, as Eugenides revealed in a 2009 interview with NPR: “That whole feeling of growing up in Detroit, in a city losing population, and in perpetual crisis really was the mood that made me write 'The Virgin Suicides' in the first place. I was unaware when I was writing the book that that's really the impetus for the entire book. This idea of a family and a collection of girls being suicidal actually came out of the experience of growing up in Detroit.”\n\n'Detroit 9000' (1973)\n\nQuentin Tarantino is among the fans of this gritty, if dated, crime drama about a jaded white detective (Alex Rocco, who’d later play Moe Green in \"The Godfather\") and a dashing black detective (Hari Rhodes) investigating a heist at a political fundraiser that leads to a bloody trail of murder. Shot in Detroit, it’s a time capsule of what the city looked like in the early 1970s (hey there, Hudson’s) and of what passed for street-smart dialogue 50 years ago.\n\nDetroit detail: Among the local celebrity cameos, radio icon Martha Jean (the Queen) Steinberg is seen doing a TV interview with real-life Detroit Police Chief John Nichols.\n\n'Anatomy of a Murder' (1959)\n\nReigning for decades as the most A-list movie ever made in Michigan, the courtroom drama filmed in Marquette and Ishpeming starred Jimmy Stewart, Lee Remick and Ben Gazzara and was directed by Otto Preminger. Based on a novel written under a pseudonym by Michigan Supreme Court Justice John Voelker, it was hailed for its realism and was inspired by a real case. Stewart plays the defense lawyer for an Army officer accused of killing a local businessman. In a neat historical footnote, the judge is played by attorney Joseph Welch, who in real life stood up to Sen. Joseph McCarthy during his anti-communist hearings by asking the famous question, “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”\n\nMichigan moment: Filming was done in several U.P. cities, including Marquette, Ishpeming and Big Bay, the site of the 1952 murder that inspired the novel.\n\n'Standing in the Shadows of Motown' (2002)\n\nThe documentary is a fond tribute to the Funk Brothers — the session musicians who were a vital part of Motown's sound — that director Paul Justman called \"a race against time.\" Several key members, including bassist James Jamerson, drummers Benny Benjamin, drummer Eddie Brown and keyboardist Earl Van Dyke, were no longer alive when filming began. But Justman was able to record surviving Funk Brothers as they reunited for live performances and shared stories of their time in the small Motown basement nicknamed the Snake Pit, where they created instrumental magic. \"The secret to any great group, even one as fluid as the Funks, is mutual respect and love — not just for each other but for the audience and the music,\" noted the Free Press review.\n\nDetroit detail: Once a Motown legend, always a Motown legend. With the genius of the Funk Brothers, the doc won a Grammy for best compilation soundtrack album for a motion picture, television or other visual media.\n\n'The Road to Wellville' (1994)\n\nIf you’ve never heard about the eccentric Dr. John Harvey Kellogg and the sanitarium he created in Battle Creek in the early 1900s, this somewhat amusing comedy written and directed by Alan Parker (“Fame,” “Evita”) may have you thinking about corn flakes in an entirely new way. Roger Ebert called it “a hymn to American cults of hygiene, nutrition and cleanliness” that explains the health tips from Dr. Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) involving colonic irrigation and sexual abstinence, and the visitors (portrayed by Matthew Broderick, Bridget Fonda and John Cusack) drawn to his odd spa. Kellogg’s brother built the cereal empire that still reigns today.\n\nMichigan moment: Based on a T.C. Boyle novel, the movie was filmed in New York and North Carolina – and generally disliked by Battle Creek residents for its take on that bizarre chapter of Battle Creek history.\n\n'Only Lovers Left Alive' (2013)\n\nDirector Jim Jarmusch ventured to the Brush Park neighborhood for his trademark melancholy magic, aimed this time at vampire lovers, one of whom (Tom Hiddleston) lives in a dilapidated Detroit mansion, the other (Tilda Swinton) in Tangier, Morocco. More well-mannered than their human counterparts (one of whom is played by the late, great Anton Yelchin), they feed on blood from medical suppliers and bemoan the decline and fall of civilization on late-night drives past the old Packard Plant. Jarmusch's true affection for the Motor City is on display, as it was in his subsequent documentary on Iggy Pop and the Stooges, \"Gimme Danger.\"\n\nDetroit detail: Hiddleston's architecturally splendid Queen Anne on Alfred Street is known as the Donaldson-Whitney House. A three-story, red-brick structure, it was designed by Mason & Rice and built in 1879.\n\n'The Rosary Murders' (1987)\n\nDonald Sutherland is the priest investigating a series of murders involving Catholic priests and nuns. One clue: the black rosary that's discovered with each victim. Shot at Holy Redeemer in southwest Detroit, \"Rosary Murders\" was based on the novel by local scribe (and ex-priest) William X. Kienzle, who shared screenplay credit with Elmore Leonard. It was described at the time by the Free Press as the first major movie shot entirely in the city.\n\nDetroit detail: Kienzle, who died in 2001, wrote a couple of dozen mystery novels about Father Robert Koesler, the priest played by Sutherland. But according to his Free Press obit, he never saw \"The Rosary Murders\" because he didn't want it to influence his depiction of the character in future works.\n\n'Grosse Pointe Blank' (1997)\n\nA depressed hit man (John Cusack), who's just coming off a botched job, goes to his 10-year reunion at a Grosse Pointe high school. There, he reunites with old friends like his former girlfriend (Minnie Driver), who brush off his confessions about his career as a joke. Darkly comedic complications ensue.\n\nMichigan moment: Screenwriter Tom Jankiewicz grew up in Sterling Heights and based some characters on his teenage pals from Bishop Foley High in Madison Heights. But aside from some aerial footage, the Grosse Pointe scenes were done in California.\n\n'Beverly Hills Cop' (1984)\n\nEddie Murphy's superstar turn as Detroit cop Axel Foley is a conundrum for Michigan-set movies. Although the bulk of the action of all three installments in the franchise occurs in Beverly Hills, where Foley's crime-fighting street smarts reign supreme, the movies put Detroit on Hollywood's map in a big way. Besides the fact that then-Detroit police inspector Gil Hill played Foley's boss, Murphy sparked a worldwide demand in 1985 for the T-shirts worn by Foley in the first movie — the actual \"Mumford Phys. Ed. Dept.″ gear. So, yeah, it makes the list.\n\nDetroit detail: The original's early scene of a police chase for a truck full of illegal cigarettes was filmed in the city near the intersection of Brush and Winder. Decades later, there's been talk — but no real action — of a \"Beverly Hills Cop IV\" reboot that would bring Foley back to his hometown.\n\n'Love and Honor' (2013)\n\nIn the late 1960s, a time of protest on the University of Michigan campus, two soldiers stationed in Vietnam go AWOL in Ann Arbor. Oh, and they do it the same week that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men to walk on the moon. Liam Hemsworth, Austen Stowell, Aimee Teegarden and Teresa Palmer lead the young cast. First-time feature director Danny Mooney helmed the project, co-written by a former teacher, University of Michigan professor Jim Burnstein.\n\nMichigan moment: Filming took place on the U-M campus, but the most buzz was generated by Hemsworth's girlfriend at the time (and current soon-to-be ex-wife), Miley Cyrus, who dropped in for visits and some jet-skiing on Oakland County's Orchard Lake.\n\n'Vanishing on 7th Street' (2011)\n\nWhen an unknown calamity leaves Detroit littered with abandoned cars, remnants of clothing, no electricity and virtually no remaining people, four survivors — a local TV reporter (Hayden Christensen), a physical therapist (Thandie Newton), a movie projectionist (John Leguizamo) and a frightened young boy (Jacob Latimore, who'd play a leading role as a young man in \"Detroit\") — huddle inside a bar and try to figure out what is happening. Shot in 2009, the low-budget indie benefited from the pre-bankruptcy city's more barren areas.\n\nDetroit detail: In a film-friendly bit of cooperation, Detroit agreed to block off a small stretch of 1-75 to create a deserted freeway. The bar's interior shots were done at Kovacs, which also was a location for 1992's \"Hoffa.\" And Christensen's office scenes were done at Southfield's WXYZ-TV (Channel 7) headquarters.\n\n'Chameleon Street' (1989)\n\nWendell B. Harris Jr.'s debut feature, \"Chameleon Street,\" had the sort of roller-coaster ride that sums up the gamble taken by low-budget indies. In 1990, it won the grand jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival and seemed poised for bigger things. But it never played widely in theaters and didn't come out on DVD until 2007. Made in Detroit, it spins off the real story of a career criminal who's portrayed joining a scam to extort Detroit Tigers great Willie Horton and spending his time pretending to be a doctor, attorney, a reporter for Time magazine and a French foreign agent. Harris directed the movie and played the impersonator in what the New Yorker called \"a disarming, disturbing, elusive, and profound meditation on personal identity.\"\n\nDetroit detail: In 2016, the Free Press reported that William Douglas Street, the inspiration for the movie, had been sentenced to three years in federal prison for identity theft and mail fraud. It was the latest wrinkle in his 40-plus years (and 17 criminal convictions and six arrests) as a con man who once fooled the Detroit Tigers into letting him try out for the team.\n\n'Reindeer Games' (2000)\n\nJohn Frankenheimer directed taut classics like \"The Manchurian Candidate\" and \"Seven Days in May.\" This isn't one of them. When Ben Affleck is released from a prison in the snow-coated Upper Peninsula, he sets out to impersonate his cell mate and connect with that guy's girlfriend (Charlize Theron), who has met him only through prison letters. But he doesn't know that, thanks to his new identity, he's now drawn into a plan to rob a Native American casino. Thus, the misunderstandings lead to an action shoot-'em-up that Entertainment Weekly described, in fairness to Frankenheimer, as \"a craftsman trying to do a hack’s job.\"\n\nMichigan moment: The winter wonderland of the U.P. is actually portions of British Columbia and Vancouver, so blame Canada for the opening image of someone dressed as Santa laying bloody in the snow.\n\n'Action Jackson' (1988)\n\nCarl Weathers, aka Apollo Creed in “Rocky,\" is a Harvard-degreed Detroit police sergeant named Jericho (Action) Jackson. Craig T. Nelson is Jackson's nemesis, a shady automaker who might be behind the killing of several union bosses. Vanity, the Prince protege, is Nelson's mistress and a heroin addict (because the baddie hooked her on the junk). Given the pace and violent touches, Roger Ebert wrote that he left the experience dizzy. Oh, and did we mention Nelson shoots his wife and plants her body in Jackson's home to frame him?\n\nDetroit detail: Yes, some of it was filmed here. But, fortuitously given the reviews, plans to spin \"Action Jackson\" into a series of cinematic adventures never happened.\n\n'30 Minutes or Less' (2013)\n\nPrior to becoming Lex Luthor for the made-in-Detroit \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" Jesse Eisenberg was a pizza delivery guy in Grand Rapids who is forced to rob a bank — and strapped into an explosive vest with a timer — by two small-time crooks (Danny McBride and Nick Swardson). He turns to his friend (Aziz Ansari) to help him pull off the task before getting himself or anyone else killed.\n\nMIchigan moment: Hailed upon release as the biggest film shot totally in west Michigan, it is studded with recognizable locations. In particular, Vito’s Pizza on West Fulton Street in Grand Rapids was employed as Eisenberg's workplace. During production, the actor spent time with employees to learn the pie trade and get a feel for his character's job.\n\n'Polish Wedding' (1998)\n\nLena Olin is Jadzia, the strong-willed matriarch of a Polish-American family in Hamtramck. She is married vaguely unhappily to Bolek (Gabriel Byrne) and has four sons and one daughter (Claire Danes). Those are the facts. Now come the secrets in this quirky comedy, namely, Jadzia, who works as a cleaning woman, is having a long-term affair with her boss, while her teenage daughter is pregnant after sleeping with a young cop. The cast is capable of fireworks, but the results of \"Polish Wedding\" were more like a dud sparkler.\n\nDetroit detail: Director-writer Theresa Connelly based the script on her memories of Hamtramck and filmed it there (and in Detroit) at recognizable spots like Wyandotte Street and St. Florian Church. She was quoted as saying it was a love letter to her hometown.\n\n'Four Brothers' (2005)\n\nThe late John Singleton directed a quartet of charismatic actors — Mark Wahlberg, Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson and Garrett Hedlund — in a crime drama about the murder of the mother (Fionnula Flanagan) who adopted them. Set in the freezing Thanksgiving mean streets of Detroit, there are glimpses of landmarks (hello, pre-Ford decaying Michigan Central Station!). But the Toronto-filmed vehicle is much more about vengeful mayhem than the complex bonds of a racially diverse family. Look for future standouts Chiwetel Ejiofor and Terrence Howard as a gangster and policeman, respectively.\n\nDetroit detail: Singleton told a British newspaper at the time, \"Detroit is a complex place. It's the place of the birth and the death of the American revolution, and now it's known as the rust belt. … So much greatness has come out of that city, but lately the only thing is Eminem, for better or for worse.\"\n\n12 more: We named Michigan's 50 most essential movies. Here are some we missed.\n\n'Assault on Precinct 13' (2005)\n\nCue the Detroit skyline shot. The reboot of the 1976 cult action flick by John Carpenter moves from Los Angeles to Detroit — in name only. With principal photography done in Toronto, Detroit was chosen as the new setting for its violent, gritty image and because there's now a snowstorm in the plot, which involves an old police precinct that's about to close and the crime boss (Laurence Fishburne) and cops who must unite to fend off a lethal gang attack. The film arrived the same year that Detroit wanted to look all shiny and new while hosting the Major League Baseball All-Star Game and the NFL's Super Bowl.\n\nDetroit detail: In 2005, the Free Press wrote, \"In the first few minutes of 'Assault on Precinct 13,' Ethan Hawke's cop character gets his day started the way a lot of Detroiters do — with a cup of joe and the Free Press sports section, Mitch Albom's smiling mug right there.\" Today, it's Starbucks and freep.com, and nowadays Albom smiles both online and in print.\n\n'Destined' (2017)\n\nDirector-screenwriter Qasim Basir, who grew up in Ann Arbor, followed his provocative 2011 drama \"Mooz-Lum,\" about an African-American Muslim college student (Evan Ross) who confronts issues of identity on the even of 9/11, with this Detroit-set drama about one man living out two parallel destinies. Cory Hardrict plays two characters: Sheed, a drug dealer on the rise, and Rasheed, an architect in the corporate world. \"Destined\" won a best director award for Basir and best actor for Hardrict at the 2016 American Black Film Festival.\n\nMichigan moment: Basir, a Wayne State University alum, went on to make 2018's \"A Boy. A Girl. A Dream,\" which followed Omari Hardwick and Meagan Good's tentative love story that starts on 2016's presidential election night.\n\n'The Upside of Anger' (2005)\n\nMetro Detroit's own Mike Binder started out as a comedian, then parlayed that into a filmmaking-screenwriting path that reached a high point with this acerbic romantic comedy starring Kevin Costner and Joan Allen. Unfolding in an affluent Detroit suburb, it centers on Allen's alcohol-fueled, if understandable, rage at being left to raise four daughters after her husband indulges in a midlife crisis with his Scandinavian secretary. Enter Costner, an aging baseball star-turned-radio deejay at WRIF-FM (the station was one of several southeast Michigan sites used for filming, so look for the Arthur Penhallow cameo) whose habit of day drinking with Allen may turn into something deeper.\n\nDetroit detail: Binder, who was an advocate for Michigan's terminated film incentives, has woven Detroit into many of this films, including two coming-of-age stories, 1990's \"Coupe De Ville\" and 1992's \"Crossing the Bridge.\" He also looked back upon his youth with 1993's \"Indian Summer,\" an ode to his childhood hangout, Camp Tamakwa of Ontario's Algonquin Park, which was founded in real life by Detroiter Lou Handler. Yes, the camp's oddball handyman is played by Binder's childhood friend Sam Raimi.\n\n'Collision Course' (1989)\n\nOuch. Jay Leno and Pat Morita came to town in 1987 to film a cross-cultural comedy about an American cop and a Japanese police officer who join forces to ... well, you probably can fill in the blanks (and imagine the totally inappropriate racial jokes) of this '80s venture that ran into money problems by the end of six weeks of shooting and was shelved for a couple years by a studio bankruptcy before being released.\n\nDetroit detail: Former Free Press critic Martin F. Kohn summed up Leno's film credits in 1989 with this bon mot: \"Jay Leno has a special fondness for Detroit, and who can blame him? This is the city where he launched his film career, co-starring in 'Collision Course' with Pat Morita. It's also the city where he ended his film career, co-starring in 'Collision Course' with Pat Morita.\"\n\n'Narc' (2002)\n\nFormer Michigander Joe Carnahan set his well-received cop drama in the Motor City, but it's another filmed-in-Toronto production that took advantage of Canada's film incentives. Jason Patric is a troubled detective who teams up with a seasoned, if unpredictable, colleague (Ray Liotta) to track down his partner's killer.\n\nDetroit detail: Patric told Free Press movie reviewer Terry Lawson, \"Toronto's not Detroit.\" Because the Toronto locations would be so inauthentic, Patric complained loud enough to be assigned \"a guerrilla camera crew\" and spent a brief period in Detroit shooting footage.\n\n'Escanaba in da Moonlight' (2001)\n\nMichigan's national treasure got the idea for the play \"Escanaba in da Moonlight\" not long after wrapping the original \"Dumb and Dumber.\" The play about the Soady family deer camp in the Upper Peninsula opened in 1995 and had another run in 1997, eventually moving to the Gem Theatre in Detroit, where it played for roughly a year and four months, becoming the longest-running play in Detroit history. The film version, produced and distributed by the Purple Rose, was filmed in Yooper territory and starred Harve Presnell of \"Fargo\" fame.\n\nMichigan moment: The movie earned a more-than-respectable $3 million in limited screenings across the Midwest. Daniels went on to do a prequel, \"Escanaba in Love,\" at the Purple Rose in 2006 and \"Escanaba,\" a pre-prequel, in 2009.\n\n'Life of Crime' (2014)\n\nIconic Detroit novelist Elmore Leonard was one cool dude about movies and TV adaptations of his work. \"I'm all for it, because you get paid for it. That's the main thing,\" the iconic crime novelist told the Detroit Free Press in 2010. \"And when it's good, there's nothing better.\" In the months before his August 2013 death, Leonard was optimistic about the chances for this adaptation of \"The Switch,\" one of the 1970s Motor City-saturated novels that earned his reputation as the Dickens of Detroit. Critics had mixed feelings. It stars Jennifer Aniston as Mickey, an affluent Oakland County housewife who's kidnapped by a couple of petty criminals (John Hawkes and Yasiin Bey, aka Mos Def) only to find out that her entrepreneur husband (Tim Robbins) is reluctant to pay the ransom.\n\nDetroit detail: Director-screenwriter Daniel Schechter prepped for filming by visiting Leonard at his Bloomfield Village home and spending a weekend driving around with him to metro Detroit to sites mentioned in \"The Switch.\" He filmed instead in Connecticut, but treated the plot and dialogue of the novel as an essential text in writing the script.\n\n'The Man' (2005)\n\nConsidered a misbegotten buddy film by reviewers, the action comedy pairs Eugene Levy as a dental supply salesman at a convention in Detroit and Samuel L. Jackson as an ATF agent wrongly suspected of being part of a weapons heist. Due to a case of collective cinema amnesia, most people don't even recall \"The Man.\"\n\nDetroit detail: Shooting was done in Levy's home country, Canada, but at least one Detroit landmark, the Metro Times, is seen in the trailer if you squint carefully at the newspaper boxes.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press pop culture critic Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com."
