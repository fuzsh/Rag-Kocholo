        "text": "If you want AAA Dylan your route is MFSL (mono and stereo) or Sony / legacy / MOV (mono). Sundazed sources are a bit vague but suspect in most cases they use original tapes transferred to hi-res digital for cutting vinyl. When they started reissue vinyl around 20 years ago I think Sundazed were AAA.\n\nThis is the statement from SC in their FAQ:\n\n\"Are your records completely analogue?\n\nYes! This we guarantee!\n\nAs a matter of principle, only analogue masters are used, and the necessary cutting delay is also analogue. All our cutting engineers use only Neumann cutting consoles, and these too are analogue. The only exception is where a recording has been made – either partly or entirely – using digital technology, but we do not have such items in our catalogue at the present time. Please read the article “Truly analogue?”.\"\n\nThey further clarify in the THE MAGNETIC TAPE\n\n\"Titles with digital recordings are not available in our catalogue, there is only one exception.\"\n\nI have no idea what the single exception is. Don't care either, if it recorded digital, What's done is done. MoFi will use digital recordings and some are still highly recommended. They cut The Nightfly with One-Step processing. I'm not a stickler for AAA. I just want well mastered with best available sources. If original masters are available on analog, all the better.\n\nThis may not be a master tape, can be copies and or backups\n\nThis is a master tape\n\nBut then just because a tape was sent to a mastering lab, does not mean the mastering engineer mastered and EQed the tape. Many will make a high res digital file from the tape, then do their work in the digital realm.\n\nI'm going to correct my statement here to the above quote. Sundazed is actually saying that the \"Mastering\" is done in all-analog, meaning what ever source they had they never converted it to digital for the ease of mastering it for the record.\n\nSo if the source they got was digital to begin with they didn’t digitize it further? Is there still room here to suggest it’s not AAA?\n\nOh I see, maybe just an analog copy of the tape ... but this would still make it AAA, no?\n\nThis is where I'm at, I remembered when digitally recorded music started and they also did a good job mastering it. So much so major artist catalogs all started to come out as Digitally Remastered as a selling point. For me it's not the digital/analogue source or mastering that makes a bad record. It's the mastering engineer themselves and the plating and pressing work that makes a crappy record.\n\nYea we have no choice, we are bound by what happens in the studio as the musicians play. Today that is heavily digitally recorded, there is no tape machine running. And if there happens to be some new music recorded to tape, there will probably be some digital manipulation somewhere down the line, Pro Tools.....\n\nI have to say almost all the new records I buy are much better than the CD version and are on par with the 24bit version, so for me records from digital is fine, we all know the key is how the product is mastered for vinyl. I want a physical media and 24bit/DSD while excellent is not physical and CD/redbook are simply meh. Plus I have zero desire to re-spend money to replicate my records with digital downloads.\n\nWhat I really desire is for some of these companies like Mofi, Sundazed and others that can, get their hands on the original tapes and reissue some of the classics from Zeppelin, Genesis, The Who and so many others. Trying to find a VG/VG+ copy of Zeppelin is tough as well as expensive......BG and RL are still working and they can master these tapes to vinyl and we will buy it. For now the closest we will get is what Jimmy Page did, reissue from a 24/192 digital file with both digital and analog mastering.\n\nYou can take a digital recording that was the original master source and \"Master\" it for a record using all analogue equipment to cut the lacquer.\n\nI think what people get confused with is the steps and terminology from the band recording it to the record we spin.\n\n1) The Band \"Records\" their music to digital or tape.\n\n2) The band and producer puts all the recordings together in the studio to come up with a \"Master Recording\" of how they want their music to be presented.\n\n3) The \"Mastered Recorded Source\" now goes to \"The Mastering Lab\" where golden ears fine tune the music through another board, EQ and make small edits that where missed. They then send the sound change with a RIAA curve to the lathe that cuts the lacquer. They will also make a mastering of a digital file to use for digital sources. Through all this they did not change the \"Original Mastered Recorded Source\"\n\nSo lets look at the terminology a reissue label might use.\n\nSourced from the original master tapes? Well what they are remastering from is original, but this does not tell us \"How\" it was mastered. They can use the tapes, or make a digital copy of the tapes and do the mastering in the digital realm.\n\nAll Analog Mastering? This tells us they did not convert a tape copy to a digital file and mastered it in the digital realm. But it also did not say it was from the original master tape, it can be a copy tape. They might have even got a digital file of the tape from the owner of the music. However all the mastering to cut the lacquer was done with analog equipment.\n\nSimple really, a number of outlets / companies are determined to remain vague as over all, \"its a good little earner\" to do so.\n\nThen there are companies that use global pressing plants and when they reference something usually it means just for a specific continent, an example is Sony who produce all analogue or analogue mastering in the US but those self same titles are often not the same in the EU!\n\nAll analogue is just that, no ambiguity at all.\n\nAll analogue mastering is plain too, mastered from an analogue source. No guarantee that there has not been a digital step along the way.\n\nComments like \"from the two track master tapes\", again can be misleading as this is too vague to be 100% sure of no digital somewhere along the line.\n\nAs has been said, no problem with digital in the process at times, I have some cracking sounding LP's that have been down this route . For me, I'd just like to KNOW what I'm buying rather than buy and sit and guess.\n\nThe shrink wrap comments are misleading far too often and reading liner notes is often clearly incorrect as it will state a mastering engineer who didn't master the LP!\n\nThe one exception is Alan Parsons' Eye in the Sky.\n\nIf half the people in the world are smart, who are the other people? If you want AAA, the record label will state the mastering processes and techniques employed. If there is any doubt in you mind based on a hype sticker's rhetoric, your doubts are probably well founded. This is a digital age. It has been for quite some time. But again, I wouldn't get hung up on AAA, ADA or AAD. Good mastering is good mastering. Good music is good music. Every glass you order in bar doesn't have to be a flute of Dom Perignon. A pint of your favorite beer, isn't a bad thing."
