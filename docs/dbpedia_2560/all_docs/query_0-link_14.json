September 22, 1887 Graves Announces New Centrex Telephone System Students residing in Moore, Brentano, Hughes, and Hale Halls will be getting a bonus with their housing bills starting next Sep- tember. Indiana Bell Telephone Compa- ny, working in conjunction with Tom Scheidler, UE housing direc- tor, has just completed a study and survey of the telephone load for the university. Dorm residents of last year may remember a study was made of the number of calls into and out of the dorms on an average night. This study was conducted over a sufficient period of time to allow the officials to get a clear picture of the average load on the dorm lines. Students living in the campus apartments were not affected as there already were separate lines for each apartment. The survey concluded on Mon- day, September 18, with a question- naire which was passed out to dorm residents. This form explained to the students the increase in housing costs that would accompany any new phone system and asked their opinion on the proposed change. The results were tallied and the -'•Cuglue-* Library Offers Improved Service With New Rooms , Planning With the purchase of $37,000 worth of new library equipment and the addition of a reference and a reserve room, the library will be able to provide “a greatly improved pattern of service.” Librarian James O’Leary has announced the removal of classes from the library and the purchase of equipment which will create both a Reference Room on the ground floor and a Reserve Room on the second floor. The Reference Room will house a unified periodical collection in what was Kleymeyer Auditorium. Previously the reference books were shelved on the main floor in an area without adjacent seating, making patrons carry reference books to another part of the floor to use them. Shelving in this room will line the walls and for the first time a patron will be able to take a seat near the reference shelf. The Refer- ence Room will also house the mic- rofilm collection and the microfilm readers. O’Leary said that the creation of a Reserve Room on the second floor is “another breakthrough in im- proved service” since it will elimi- nate congestion at the main floor charging desk where reserve books were previously kept. The reserve collection will occupy rooms 200 and 201 and according to the librariar, the Reserve Room will operate experimentally on an “open shelf” basis. Until now over- night reserves were held in a closed stack area on the main floor. Instructors will be responsible for Putting call numbers on the reserve took lists they give out. With the cull number the student will be able to go directly to the shelf and °ttain the desired book. Students will charge out reserve nooks only if they wish to take them from the building. All charg- es will be done at the Reserve I^oom entrance. Another ruling is that all reserve books must be read ln the Reserve Room. . Most of $37,000 outlay is going into new stacks and study carrels 0r booths. The new shelfs will in- Cr®f^e lil>rary’s shelf capacity Ue ''irus vaccine is available in tbe Health Center at the cost of $1.00 per shot.

The Health Center is open ^y from 8 a.m. until 12 noon. from 90,000 to 130,000 volumes while the 134 light grey carrels on order will raise the total seating in the library to 395. Because of the innovations, periodicals, which have been located on both the ground and main floors, will be united in one collection which will occupy most of the re- maining space on the ground level. Similiarly, newspapers and some popular periodicals will be available in a browsing room, formerly the Archives room. Later other types of browsing material will be added to the room which will be outfitted with lounge chairs. Also with the removal of parti- tions on the ground and second floors, students will have free move- ment throughout the building via either the main or west stairwells. Before when the partitions were up, the west stairway provided the only UE V.P. Asks For Improvement Faculty members of the Uni- versity of Evansville gathered Fri- day, Sept. 15, to hear Nicoloas Brown, vice-president of the Uni- versity speak at the fall conference. “The year of the New” was the theme that Dean Brown selected for the conference talks. During the afternoon session of the conference. Dr. Wallace Graves answered questions asked him by the faculty. He will deliver a formal “state of the university” message address following the faculty fall conference dinner Friday night in Great Hall. In Brown’s address. He called for reformation of the curriculum and strengthening of the university’s resources “in the light of newly- formulated aims.” He said there is need to improve the library, faculty salaries, teaching loads, and plans for professional development “that gives teachers an opportunity to read, study and think.” Dr. Brown concluded that the university should drop out of the numbers race long enough to catch our breath, build our strength, in- crease our substance, and decide whether or not we want to be the biggest or the best — or both.” The Rev. Dr. Wayne Perkins, director of religious life said in the service that opened the conference, “the transformation of the world re- mains a burning, devine imperative in our time. During this year we must make the attempt to focus, sharpen, and deepen our responses and the responses of our students to each other, to the world, and to God.” package was presented to President Graves for the final decision. He announced Tuesday that he was going to sign the contract with In- diana Bell Telephone for the Sep- tember (1968) installation of the recently developed Centrex Tele- phone System. This new system eliminates the need for our present dormitory switchboards and places an indi- vidual phone in every room. With this system in effect a student in a room can dial any other dorm room on campus by using a four digit code. Each room on campus wlil have it’s individual line and number. The Centrex system also enables students to make long distance calls and to receive them without having to wait for \"community” lines which were so very often tied up. According to Paul Hartman, Asso- ciate Director of Public Relations for UE, long distance calls could then be billed directly to the exten- sion. The present phone situation on campus had reached the limit of lines which could be fed into our switchboards. The university was faced with the decision of either installing a new switchboard sys- tem, with more stations, or advan- cing to the complex Centrex system. The dorm students were shown in the question form that housing bills would be increased approxi- mately $25 per academic year with the introduction of Centrex. The overall student body polled showed 83.9% in favor of the change, while only 13.3% were against the movefl A minority of 2.8% of the students polled had no opinion. Individual breakdowns of the figures showed Moore, Hale, Brentano, and Hughes Hall resi- dents to be 89.8% in favor and 8.9% against the new ssytem. This was contrasted to the Apartment residents figures of 52% for and 36% against Centrex. Hartman stressed the fact that apartment residents already have individual lines and would there- fore not benefit from the change. This, he feels, accounts for the fact that the difference in opinion was much closer in the apartment poll. Business Grad Exams ‘Must’ For Admission access to the ground and second floor stacks, floor stairs. With total completion of the facilities around Nov. 1, O’Leary commented, “But I must be frank to say that we will be offering sub- standard service until the comple- tion date.” Kiechle Earns Dean’s List For 10th time Fred L. Kiechle, a senior chemis- try major, has been named to the Dean’s List at the University of Evansville for the 10th time and heads the honor roll for the summer session.

The Admission Test for Grad- uate Study in Business, which is required of applicants to more than 170 graduate business schools, will be offered on November 4, 1967, February 3, April 6, July 13, and August 10 in 1968. A candidate must make separate application for admission to each business school of his choice and should inquire of each whether it wishes him to take the Admission Test for Graduate Study in Busi- ness and when. Since many busi- ness schools select their first-year classes during the spring preceding entry, candidates for admission to the 1968 classes are advised to take the test as early as possible. The ATGSB is not designed to test specific knowledge in special- ized academic subjects. There are no questions which presume that the candidate has taken any under- graduate work in the business area. Thus, undergraduate training pro- vides sufficient knowledge to answer the test questions. The Bulletin of Information for the test should be obtained six weeks in advance of the desired testing date by writing to Admis- sion Test for Graduate Study in Business, Box 966, Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New WEVC Hosts Music by Froelich WEVC-FM will open its fall broadcasting September 24, with an Inaugural Concert of special music prepared by Robert Froelich ac- cording to Bob Harmon, manager of WEVC. A new transmitter for the radio station will be in operation and according to Harmon, “The trans- mitter, which will, of course, oper- ate much more dependably and efficiently, will greatly increase the quality of the broadcast signal.” The transmitter is a kilowatt, solid-state model. There also is a new production studio which will afford the station space in which to prepare programs while the broadcast studio is in use. WEVC will be broadcasting 70 per cent classical music and will be on the air 8V2 hours daily, Monday through Friday and 5l/2 hours on Sunday. A weekly opera will be presented each Saturday at noon. The new transmitter will provide a greater listening quality for pro- grams scheduled such as the Metro- politan opera and the chamber music series from the Library of Congress. A program guide, listening the A program guide, listing the se- lections to be heard on various pro- grams may be obtained upon re- quest at the station. Jersey 08540. Registration forms and fees must reach ETS at least two weeks before the desired test administration date to allow time for completion of necessary testing arrangements for each candidate. According to Dr. Arensman, head of the business department, “Any student even demotely inter- ested in graduate business work — that includes many nonbusiness undergraduates such as engineer- ing, mathmatica, etc., should take this exam.” For further information concern- ing this exam contact Dr. Arena- man or write to the Educational Testing Service. Tuition Costs Here Less Than Average University of Evansville tuition and fee costs are less than half the national average for private insti- tutions as cited in a recent Depart- ment of Health, Education, and Welfare report. HEW’S study showed that the national average for tuition and fees at private schools is $2,100 per year. According to Thornton B. Patberg, director of admissions, tuition and fees at the U of E amount to $864 per year, even less than the national average ($1,000 according to HEW) for publicly- supported universities. “The student will probably spend an additional $90 on books each year, making the total necessary costs for the U of E student who lives at home about $954,” says Patberg. Mr. Patberg added that the Uni- versity of Evansville student who lives in university housing and eats in the university's dining center will need $1,719 to cover the annual cost for tuition ($825), fees ($39), books ($90), room ($270), and meals ($46). “If the dormitory student spends $250 on clothes and trans- portation, his total college cost per year will be about $1,970, more than $1,000 less than HEW’s es- timate of the national average for private institutions,” Patberg said. Mrs. Eaton Joins Financial Aids Mrs. Joan Eaton, 5403 E. Divi- sion St., has been appointed finan- cial aids counselor at the University of Evansville. Mrs. Eaton will assist the director of financial aids, C. Arthur Tyler, in the administration of more than one million dollars worth of financial assistance. The financial assistance includes scho- larships, grants, loans, and work opportunities. Page 2 Maybe iust a few quickies to keep reader attention? We hear that the Chi 0’s have 27 pledges now? Maybe some problems in the offing for the active chapter??? The Crescent is being published under the auspioes of a new journalism instructor this year. The staff win take this tune to formaUy welcome Mr. Richard Bayley to the UE staff. Bv the way, you Hale residents can get out your Roimler bottles and reefers again, J.C. has left for Oklahoma. Bye bye Joe. (sniff?) UE students have quite a lot going for them— more, in fact, than they’ve ever had. We have a new president with some great ideas about education and he apparently has the initiative and drive to put them into effect. . The paving job on the parking lots is beautiful. Rut— it didn’t do much to enlarge them. We’ve heard through the grapevine that plans are now being made for a new parking facility. However, after thoroughly wracking our few brains, we have no idea where it will be built. Anybody care to guess. It seems someone entered our campus bookstore Tuesday night and made off with a few goodies, however, the campus police have been rather hesitant to talk about it. Whats the score? President Graves’ announcement of the coming installation of the Centrex phone system is bound to be gladly welcomed by the campus residents. Anyone who has ever attempted to call into one of the dorms after six o’clock, especially Moore or Brentano (naturally), can see that the system will be well worth the extra $25 per year on the houpsing bill. Dorm residents are aware that the lines are overloaded now and something has to be done. Faced with the choice of installing a new switchboard or going to centrex was a hard decision for the administration to make, we are sure. The fact that the students were given a chance to voice their opinions speaks highly for the new president’s respect for the students. We also see that the students showed enough initiative to take advantage of this chance as the poll showed an extremely heavy vote either for or against. The “no opinion” votes which show up so heavily in public opinion polls were kept at a minimum. Congratulations, dorm residents! It may further interest the dorm residents to know that this will be the second Centrex system in effect in the Evansville area. The other one being located at Deaconess Hospital.

The Crescent Seplember 22, 1967 Newman Club To Be Revised by Dave Longest “The Newman Club operations this year will try to break the image of a solely Catholic organization and be more of a service organiza- tion to the academic community,” stated Father Kress, new instructor and the first full-time chaplain for the organization. The young priest comes to the University of Evansville from a var- ied itinerary of scholastic institu- tions. For the past two years he has worked on his doctor’s degree in theology at the Pontificial Gregori- an University in Rome where he has just completed his doctorate requirements. He has also spent five years in study at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. “No, I wasn’t there for the winter Olympics,” he added. Father Kress, a native of Jasper, Ind., received his B. A. degree at St. Meinrad College and received his master’s degree at Notre Dame University. He was ordained a priest after servnig as' assistant pastor at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Evans- ville. The father will teach the new Scholastic Philosophy course this fall and will continue as director of the Newman Club operations. As the first full-time chaplain of the House, Father Kress plans to emphasize student comumnity serv- ice by having a mass on Sunday at the House. This has never been done before and he thinks it is the organization’s responsibility to Catholics attending the University. He also added “We are going to broaden our community services in the area of education and social action which includes poverty and racial problems.” Commenting on the structure of the Newman House organization this year he said that there will be a three-man directive committee now composed of Jim Bakel, Bob Schaffstein and Tim McMahan. “Organization will be very informal at first until officers are elected,” he explained. Another innovation the Newman House is offering this year is a quiet room for all students where they may come to read and study. Also, the basement, which is being improved, will be used as a “less quiet” room, according to the father. With its convenient location just across from the University at 1901 Lincoln Ave., the House provides a comfortable and relaxing atmo- sphere for students and faculty. Hours for the Newman House are from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Father Kress is also planning several \"bull” sessions, and semi- nars for campus commentary to acquire a greater continuity be- tween the club and the university. In reference to his reception Teacher Award Established By U.E. Alumni Lewis A. Plane, past presi- dent of the University of Evans- ville National Alumni Association, announced the establishment of a $1,000 “Outstanding Teacher Award” to be presented to a mem- ber of the full-time teaching faculty at U of E by alumni. The announce- ment came at the Faculty Fall Conference dinner Friday (Sept. 15). Each spring an appropriate plaque and the $1,000 will be pre- sented to the faculty member se- lected by a committee consisting of representatives of the faculty, ad- ministration, student body, and the Alumni Association. The chairman of the committee will be Dr. Jack Humphrey, a member of the asso- ciation’s board of directors. The committee will outline and publish the criteria to be used in the selection. It will solicit nom- inations for the award and will ask that nominations be made, in writ- ing, to the committee sometime dur- ing spring quarter. The “Outstanding Teacher Award” is an extension of the “Great Teachers’ Program” begun in 1959 by the Alumni Association, which has raised more than $50,000 to provide higher salaries in sup- port of the outstanding faculty at the university. here so far Father Kress beamed, “I truly received a kind welcome and I am sure glad to be back in Indiana.” Fellowships Open To Seniors, Grads Interested college seniors or re- cent graduates who plan to teach college as a career are invited to inquire about Danforth Graduate Fellowships, to be awarded in March, 1968. According to Dr. Clarence Davis, Associate Dean of the University of Evansville and the campus repre- sentatives of the Danforth Founda- tion, applicants may be single or married, men or women, must be less than thirty years of age at the time of application, and may not have undertaken any graduate or professional study beyond the bac- calaureate. Candidates must be nominated by Liaison Officers of their under- gradfuate institutions by Novem- ber 1, 1967 and the foundation does not accept direct applications for the fellowships. Approximately 120 Danforth Graduate Fellows will be eligible for four years of financial assist- ance, with a maximum annual liv- ing stipend of $2,400 for single Fellows and $2,950 for married Fellows, plus tuition and fees. Financial need is not a condition for consideration. The Danforth Foundation of St. Louis, Mo., was founded in 1927 by the late William H. Danforth, St. Louis businessman and philanthro- pist. The primary aim of the foun- dation is to strengthen education through programs of fellowships and workshops, and through grants to schools, colleges, universities and other educational agencies. Inquires about the fellowship should be made directly to Dr. Clarence Davis, Associate Dean. GERONTE’S PIZZA Willow Rd. at Walnut Phone 423-7261 !

A good way to find out what is coming up next throughout the year is to purchase the campus calander. This pocket directory of school activities is a valuable asset to the old and new students. These can be purchased at the union office for 25$. Are you willing to take a chance? The Computer Dance, an interest- ing way to meet new people, will be held October 14 at 8:00 p.m. in the Great Hall. You can play it safe and bring a date, or you can take a chance and have the com- puter match you up. Sign up in the union. When you are in the union, stop by and say hello to Mrs. Land, Mrs. Fiddick, and Mrs. Rhodes. Their offices are always open to students, whether you are on business or just stopped by to chat. The union was built to serve you, so feel free fo express suggestion or criticisms. There are a couple of important rules that must be followed in the use of the union. No food or drinks are to be taken from the Indian to another room in the building. The other is that the books and magazines in the browsing rooms are for the enjoyment of all the students. These must be left in the rooms. The union encourages aggressive new students to participate in the union activities as a committee member. After two years service on a committee you will be eligible for the position of committee chairman. The eight retiring committee chair- man nominate two students for each committee to run for the posi- tions. The final selection is done by election by the student body. The committees are: Dance, Entertain- ment, Finance, Fine Arts, House, Personnel, Public Relations and Social. The union board is the program- ming board for the union. Each committee is assigned certain areas for which they are held responsible. They also strive to find better uses for the union and its facilities. This years union board members are: Herb Jensen, President; Jim Wills, Vice-President; Marlene Cheek, Secretary; Marty Plank, Jan Boy- Marcia Hisgen, Diane Wilson, Karen Anderson, Becky Prince, and Robert Roeder.

The Baldwin Piano Company, member of the National Piano Company provided the $150 scho- larships for Bettye and Shirley. This foundation was established in 1963 to encourage the enrichment of school music curriculum and continued learning among profes- sional teachers. Scholarship winners followed a rigorous schedule throughout the three week course of study. Their instructor, Professor Robert Pace of the Teacher’s College Music Dept, is a leading proponent of group teaching. His “new music” stresses concepts and principles of music rather than the “old fash- ioned” piano lesson given to one student.

The Kenton concert will be spon- sored by the Evansville Area Jazz Club. It was announced at the club’s monthly meeting and jam session at the Evansville Press Club recently.

Jazz Club President Bob Byler said the 18-piece Kenton Orchestra, which is based in California, will be on tour in October and Novem- ber and that it is a “wonderful break” for the club that the No- vember 2 Evansville date can be worked into their schedule. The Vanderburg Auditorium holds only 2,000, so an early sellout is anticipated by the club. Tickets for the concert will be $3.00 and $4.50 and can now be ordered by mail from: Jazz Club Concert, 410 Old National Bank Building, Ev- ansville, Ind. Kenton is a seven-time winner of the Playboy Jazz Poll Award, a Look magazine “Band of the Year” winner, and his musicians have won numerous Downbeat, Metro- nome and Variety magazine all- star awards.

Greg Brune, SEM’s senior quarterback, launched an aerial attack in the fourth quarter to upend a 7-7 tie. With J'u9t 10:01 left in that last Bruce Nall tied it with the extra stanza, Brune hit half back John Diepenbrock all alone on the end zone with a 39-yard pass. Diepenbrock was hit for six pass- es and 182 yards. Evansville drew first blood after a scoreless first quarter. Don Crane nosed his way into paydirt from the six yard line. End Mike Wood- ard kicked the extra point. 14:04 was left in the quarter. Not more than ten minutes later, SEMO tied it up. Using a mixture of plays, Brune finally carried the ball over himself from the six for the score. point. It was the Aces game on the line, and on the ground, but the air be- longed to SEMS. In the statistics department, SEM out-tallied Evansville except in the penalty department, UE was assessed 30 yards and SEM 65. Evansville’s defense was a factor in the game, all but completely stopping the Indian running game, although SEM’s air attack smoth- ered the Aces, with Brune’s long bombs keeping the Indians far ahead of the Aces secondary.

A week ago, I might have said “another great season”, but that was a week ago. Like five thousand other people, I went to see the Aces take on Southeast Missouri State Saturday night at Reitz Bowl, and watched the Aces get beaten 14-7. Saturday night’s game was a surprise because the “new” Aces had been highly touted by the local papers, as well as head coach Jun Byers. Even I, after reading all the good reports, was ready to say some pretty nice things . . . but then came Saturday night. I probably shouldn’t criticize everybody all the time. As a matter of fact, the defense was tough . . . Grid Battle At Bradley Could Be Real Thriller Saturday night the University of Evansville football Aces will meet the Bradley Braves on the Braves Field in Peoria, 111. The Braves, returning with 18 lettermen will be looking for a big win over the Aces after their loss last year 7-6. Head coach Billy Stone brings on to the field a squad of 37 men made up mostly of sophomores and juniors. Bradley finished with a 6-4 record in 1966 and will further boast an all letterman offensive line. Team captain and returning three-year letterman is senior Ter- ry Stanger who figures big in the Braves pass defense. Stanger is a 255 pound end who returned sev- eral intercepted passes for touch- downs last year. In his split-end position, Dane Waitkus, 6-2, 185 pounds, caught eight passes and carried for a total of eighty-eight yards, and figures to be one of the most important re- ceivers for the Braves. In the backfield, standouts should be senior halfback Mike DafTemer and sophomore fullback Lyman Buysse. Mike Dafferner who weighs 170 pounds and stands 5-2, brought down twenty passes for 215 yards and gained 206 yards on 58 carries last season. Buysse ran only twice last year, but the 6-2, 210 pound sophomore will fig- ure mainly as a pass blocker. SEMO Indians found out that no- body could cover passes for the Aces. Also, some fine passing in the first quarter by Joe Loge and one fine punt return — later called back because of clipping — almost made the offense look good . . . for a while. What’s the reason for what hap- pened Saturday night? First game jitters? Were the Indians just a better team? Were there enough in- juries to account for the poor show- ing? Maybe I’ll be able to tell you after the Aces meet Bradley the twenty-third. The Crescent Sports Section is going to expand to two pages be- ginning with next weeks issue. With the added space, we think we’ll be able to give full coverage to all aspects of sports at U.E.. This also includes intramurals — which should please the Greeks! But!, the Crescent does simply not have the facilities and staff to cover all the intramural contests. And so, we would like to have fraternities, sororities, dorms and other organ- izations involved in intramurals pick one of their members to report to the Crescent their IM activities. If the Greeks, etc. want the good coverage they say they do, then here is their chance. Lasts but not leasts: Letters to the Editor.

TKE Lawn Party Kicks Off Fall Social Rush Calendar THE CRESCENT Volume 48 No. 30 The University of Evansville, Evansville, Ind. September 29, 1967 Four UE Sororities Pledge 72 For Fall Rush Week Record By Joyce Kleinhenn Four sororities climaxed Rush Week September 20 with the pledging of a record number of University of Evansville women. The pledging of 72 women ended a six-day series of concen- trated parties by each sorority. From the time they arrived on campus until the final event in Moore Hall Wednesday evening, girls were busy attending parties and getting acquainted with new people. Pledging activities began with the traditional presentation of pods, and each sorority planned various functions for its newcomers. Alpha Omicron Pi welcomed their 19 pledges with a spaghetti supper sponsored by the Mothers Club. Their pledges were intro- duced Friday at the Teke Lawn Party and Saturday at the Lambda Chi Watermelon Bust. Following the dance Saturday a slumber party was held in honor of the pledges, and Sunday a tea took place in the suite for all girls and their mothers. Chi Omegas started events with an “Owl Hoot” buffet supper. Their 19 pledges were introduced at the Lambda Chi Watermelon Bust, and following the dance they had a slumber party. Sunday the pledges were honored at a tea. Mother Club Serves Phi Mu’s Mother Club served dinner to their 19 pledges immed- iately following the ribboning cere- monies. Their pledges were intro- duced at the Teke Lawn Party and the Lambda Chi Watermelon Bust. Saturday night they were serenaded by actives during their annual slumber party. Sunday consisted of breakfast in the suite, church at the Methodist Temple, and formal Pledging. The alumnae of Zeta Tau Alpha bad a pot luck supper for 15 new Pledges after the presentation of Pods. Pledges were introduced at the Teke Lawn Party and the Lambda Chi Watermelon Bust. A slumber party and serenade took place Saturday night. AOPi Pledges Those women pledged to Alpha Sodalitas Goes National UE’s newest addition to frater- nity row, Sodalitas, officially be- came a colony of Phi Kappa Tau national for this academic year. The fraternity, which was formed 3 a local last December, came nbout because the existing frater- nities did not seem to be fullfilling the students’ needs. Administra- tion feeling was that because of the increasing enrollment and greater mterest in fraternity life, the five 0r'JDnal groups could not pledge the numbers of men interested. Since its organization as a local, Sodalitas has led the fraternities in scholastic achievement. Its grade Point average of 2.58 for last spring quarter was .22 higher than the Maternity average for the same quarter.

Tau Kappa Epsilon held its an- nual Teke Lawn Party Friday night in front of the fraternity house on Lincoln Avenue. Music was provided by “The Villians.” Saturday night’s festivities fea- tured the annual Lambda Chi Al- pha Watermelon Bust at the rear of the LCA fraternity house. Highlighting the program was the naming of Miss Watermelon Bust, the “perfect” girl. Jenny Edgar captured the hon- ors, beating out four other con- testants, as each girl tried to fit into the plywood form. Along with music by “The Cor- sairs,” a tricycle race was held, Methodist Grants Awarded Students Four UE freshmen coeds have been awarded National Methodist Scholarships by the Board of Edu- cation of the Methodist Church. The freshman shcolarships win- ners are: Marsue Hoe Bissey, El- no ra, Ind.; Judy Ann Davis, Chris- ney, Ind.; Jennifer Louise Gwyn, Mt. Carmel, 111.; and Linda Diane Steinmetz of Mt. Vernon, Ohio. Those who have received re- newals of their scholarships for the year 1967-68 are: Delilah Lee Atz, a sophomore from Indianapolis; Su- san C. Jones, a sophomore from Shoals, Ind.; and Patricia G. Nim- nicht, a senior from Washington, Ind. National Methodist Scholarships cover tuition and fees up to $500. They are granted on the basis of su- perior academic standing, leader- ship ability, active churchmanship, character, personality and need. with AOPi capturing first place honors. A1 Bender of TKE beat LCA’s Larry Hurst in the watermelon throwing contest. Bender, however, needed a “throw off” to do it, since judges ruled both his and Hurst’s first toss a tie. Three-time champion Paul Hart- man was defeated in the water- melon eating contest by John Mom- inee. Dr. Thomas Fiddick made a futile attempt to finish. Now beard- less, Dr. Fiddick finished a “weak” third. Former Student Government As- sociation President Jim Browning hosted the evening’s fun. Enrollment Data Show Freshmen As ‘ Brainiest ’ Ever Nearly 5,200 students are en- rolled in day and Community Col- lege classes here this fall.

Page 2 The Crescent Rank-Out Bugged Some R^Ibout time the bands that play at campus dances wised up. For the most part, the UE student body is getting sick and tired of being “ranked out” at dances. It’s becoming a consistent thing any mo[e,to ^ye *o hear gross obscenities such as we heard at the Lambda ^ melon Bust Saturday night. We commend the Chi s on the Bust but the entire evening was marred by one vulgar song. Many popular songs can be taken as either rank or not, such as the one, “Let’s Spend the Night Together.” The song, however, was not banned from all the radio stations, so we may assume that it was not altogether too bad. But when the band changed the words to “Let’s Share our Bed Together,” it went too far. Good bands need not resort to vulgarity, but others insist on iai(7mon fellas, we’re old enough to know about sex without hav- ing it pushed down our necks at every dance sock hop, or party on campus. A drunk in the back row probably liked it, but most of us did not. , , . , The average College Joe doesn’t have to hear such lewd songs to enjoy himself at a dance. Wise up, guys.

Negotiation Now Pleas For Peace Negotiation Now, a national citizens’ campaign for new initia- tives to end the war in Vietnam, has recently been introduced at the University of Evansville. The campaign, which is being seen nationwide as well as on campus, has been presented in the form of posters and literature. It is the hopes of the sponsors that bombing in Vietnam will cease as a result of petitions and money of American citizens.” Various ministers, businessmen, and public leaders have banned to- gether in asking support of the views they express. They are; “We support the call by U Thant for new initiatives to bring about negotiations among all parties to the conflict, leading to a political settlement of the Vietnam war. We call upon the United States, the most powerful nation in the world, to take the first step and end the bombing of North Vietnam now and without conditions. We ask our government to take further ini- tiatives leading to a standstill truce. We ask North Vietnam and the national liberation front to respond affirmatively to any new United States initiatives and to join with the U.S. in a standstill cease-fire.

The show, a repeat of the one given during summer to raise drama scholarships, was seen by a full house. Jim Yeiser, an August graduate, was the director. Acts in eluded a jazz trio with Jim Yeiser at the piano, Dave Emge on drums, and Susan Davis playing bass. Ron Glass and Sherry Crawford sang a jazz number while Leanne Howerter added a folk song. Emily Backus read poetry and also did a scene from “The Rainmaker” with John David Lutz. Dr. Sam Smiley, professor of drama and speech and Ron Glass ended the evening with poetry read- ing mixed with jazz. UE’s Drama department has four major productions coming up this year. RHINOCEROS by Eu- gene Ionesco and directed by Dr. Smiley will be presented November 10-18. It depicts the struggle for identity by an individual in a totali- tarian world. The second production THE PLOUGH AND THE STARS by Sean O’Casey will be directed by Dudley Thomas. Its showing will be February 2-10 and it involves the Easter rebellion and its relation to present times. SLOW DANCE IN THE KILL- ING GROUND by William Hand- ley with John David Lutz directing will be presented March 29-30 and April 3-6. It tells the attempts of three people to escape the KILL- ING GROUNDS. The last major production by the department will be THE MISER a comedy written by Moliere. The dates for it will be May 17-18, and 22-25. Other plays which are to be pre- sented include a children’s play REYNARD THE FOX and a Christmas play EAGER HEART by A. M. Buckton. The Drama Department is eager for new talent and any interested persons are welcome to try out for RHINOCEROUS or other coming plays. “ Activities Day ” Goes African “Activities Day” sponsored by the Student Union, is scheduled for Oct. 10 with an “African” theme to dominant the displays. Annually the Union offers all campus groups a chance to recruit members and display information concerning their organization. The displays will be in the patio this year instead of the Great Hall. To obtain a table for “Activities Day,” an organization should register with Mrs. Judy Fiddick, program direc- tor for the Student Union. “We certainly hope the organiza- tions involved will stick to the theme, commented Marcia Hisgen, house committee chairman of the Union. She suggested that shrunken heads, ivory tusks, and bongo drums could add to the fun and help build the spirit of the occasion. Other suggestions included a cannibal feast, an elephant hunt, tribal dances, safaries, missionary adventures, and various things con- cerning deserts, oases, and witch doctors.

The Cardinals, who will be leav- ing the conference at the end of the season, have trounced Central Mis- souri State and ICC foe Valparaiso. The Aces, on the other hand, lost to Southeastern Missouri State 14- 7 and battled to a 13-13 deadlock with Bradley last Saturday. Ball State has a fine ground game, spearheaded by its three backs, fullback John Onfrejko and halfbacks Amos VanPelt and Dick Lester. According to Coach Jim Byers, The Aces will be expecting a hard BSU ground game. “They use it 85 per cent of the time,\" he said. “We will try to find the weak spots in their defense and not just concentrate on their running attack,” he said. Aces Gain Standoff By Dave Longest A spectacular 91 yard run from scrimmage by Ken Mills high- lighted a 13-13 stalemate with Bradley last Saturday night in Peoria, 111. With 13:13 left in the second quarter, the Aces powerful fullback Mills cut outside left end and gal- loped almost the length of the field for the first score of the standoff. The extra point was added by Mike Woodward and the Aces led briefly 7-0. The Braves, with 18 returning lettermen, muscled their way back PHI KAPPA TAU FRAT. needs a folk singing group for rush banquets and parties. Will pay price.

Evansville tied the score early in the last quarter as halfback Don Crane powered off tackle for five yards and a touchdown. Woodard’s kick to break the tie missed and the score was deadlocked at 13-13. The final minutes were frantic as both teams had touchdown bids. Quarterback Joe Loge propelled the Aces to the Bradley 40, but an intercepted pass set the stage for a Bradley drive to Evansville’s 15 yard line. Then Ace Richard Dick intercepted a pass and ended the Bradley threat. AUTO INSURANCE? Call Goff Insurance 422-4671 In back of the armory at 1615 E.

Here is a prediction on the game: Evansville 21, Ball State 14. A come-from-behind win for Coach Byers and the Aces. Fencing? Yes, that’s what it is In the past week or two, there has been considerable interest ex- pressed around campus in the sport, both by Greeks and inde- pendents. In fact, from a reliable source it was learned that one of the faculty members has tentatively agreed to coach a fencing team. For right now, interested persons, both male and female, can contact Chuck Cof- fin or Jim B as tain in Hale Hall for more detailed information. Aces Improving The football Aces seem to be on the road to improvement. Their showing at Bradley last Saturday — a tie game — — didn’t exactly brand them as future Rose Bowl contenders, but it did indicate that the Aces may still be a team to be reckoned with in the ICC this year. It should be interesting to see what the football Aces can do with their first ICC contender, Ball State, which they meet next week on the Cardinals’ home field in Muncie. BSU, a school of 10,600 enrollment and which in the past has been able to field above aver- age teams in all sports, is expected to be a tough opponent for the Aces. Time will tell . . .

Sure, why not?” According to Dr. William Hartsaw, head of the engineering department, there are currently three girls enrolled in the en- gineering program at the University of Evansville. Susan Westfall, senior, is work- UE Grad Named To Position Jamse E. Wallace, 802 E. 4th St., Mt. Vernon, Ind., has been named an electrical engineer at Tho Bab- cock & Wilcov Company’s Mt. Ver- non Works, it was announced by N. P. Wagner, works manager. A 1967 graduate from Evansville College with a B.S. degree in elec- trical engineering, Wallace is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Royce Wal- lace of Princeton. He previously was employed by Whirlpool Corp. Wallace ib married to tho form- er Phyllis Jones, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alvin Jones ol Fort Branch, Ind. He and his wife have a daughter Daphne, age 5. ing toward a degree in electrical engineering. Nancy Marchant and Madaline Studer, freshmen, both are undecided on the field of en- gineering which they will enter. Despite what the men may say, tho reasons a girl enrolls in such a program vary little from why a guy does. It isn’t the abundance of men, (although wo don’t really mind it,) but rather tho liking for math and science nnd an interest in drawing which leads girls into the depths of this predominately male field. The main disadvantage for being a girl in engineering can easily be Burned up in one word “COMPETI- TION!” For Home reason it seems that tho courses come eusior to the men, and the females have to really work “to stay in tho running.” But, ns Sue WcHtfnll explains, SAL Lawn Party Held Saturday one can easily turn the competition into a challenge, and by hard study, can meet up to the standards set by men. The field is not an easy one no matter who enrolls. It involves a lot of long hours and much hard study. However, the educational and job opportuni- ties are well worth the work for tho females bb well as tho males. The demand for women engineers is discussed little, but if ono looks into the situation, one can see that the demand by far surpasses the supply. Maybe tho girls have not heard about this field, or they may be “just plain chicken,\" but all of the girls currently enrolled in engineering wish that more girls would join them in tho field. (I don’t think tho guys would mind it too much either. Would you, guys? Really, there is very little that n girl cannot do if she applies her- self. Sometimes male assistance is necessary in moving heavy objects, but the men don't seem to mind at all. They are moro than happy to help tho females in distress. At UE there seems to he no re- sentment by the mules for females being in their engineering classes. (They even let us in front of them in the line to tho coke machine during the lab brenks.) They are all very friendly and don’t seem to mind the presence of a girl. Perhaps the hardest adjustment for a girl to mako is the lack of other girls in her engineering classes, hut hIic gets used to it real fast, (and onto we get jised to it wo don’t really mind nt nil.) There aro a few complaints how- ever. There seems to lie no place to put a purse in the drawing lab. the stools are not only rough and ruin hose, but are also rather high nnd hard to get onto in a tight skirt, and tho teachers insist on referring to tho class os “young men!” Each year this event is held to aid high school publication staffs with specific problems. This is ac- complished through workshops nnd outstanding speakers in tho field. One of the highlights of tho day will be a Pi Delta Epsilon Scholar- ship awarded to a student who displays talent in journalistic writ- ing. It is n newswriting competition in which contestants are required to write a story about the speech at tho opening session of Journalism Day. The two winners will each receive a journalism scholarship, worth $160 in tuition when the re- cipient enrolls for a journalism course at the University of Evans- ville. The contest is sponsored by the University of Evansville chapter of Pi Delta Epsilon, a national honorary journalistic fraternity. To enter the contest, each stu- dent must be a senior in high school, have worked on a school publication, and notify Mr. Richard Bayley of his intention to compete by Wednesday, October 25. For the second year participating schools aro invited to enter the special-category competition of both yearbooks nnd newspapers. An award will bo made to tho best newspaper article in the categories of straight news story, feature story, sports story, and editorials. Yearbooks will bo categorized in thomo development, layout, copy- writing and photography. To help publications stnffs evalu- ate their work, Journalism Day offers an individual newspaper and yearbook rating service. Those pub- lications submitted will be carefully examined by the editors of the University of Evansville Crescent, and the LinC. Newspaper nnd yearbooks will be judged nnd rated on their own merits, taking into consideration journalistic standards nnd accepted practices. Tho editors use a de tailed rating sheet in mnking then evaluations. The newspaper and the year book rated highest by the editnr- will be given a “TOP RAT ING and will receive a plaque for their schools.

FaculN >■* ' Page 2 The Crescent October 6, 1967 $(DMSW Letter to the Editor The students at UE are today faced with the annual “popu- larity contest'’ sometimes referred to as class elections. There is one difference between this election and ons of the past; this year’s voter has a reason to stop and think before casting his ballot. The coalitions for this election are different enough to make selection a true matter for consideration. As far as upperclass choices go, the Crescent feels it should strongly support the All- C amp us Party. This coalition, led by SGA President Dick Paulen. offers an extremely strong slate of candidates. The party proved in the spring that the students were fed up with the LCA dominated Action party. A change was needed and was over- whelmingly provided at the polls. Wo feel that the students should do what they can to strengthen this new government, the only way to do it is to vote All-Campus once again. Starting with the Senior class, Mark Hosterman and Paul N iemeier are capable men who have been hard workers for their ' respective fraternities. Niemeier also served as Circulation man- ager for the Crescent wh ile holding down a regular job and earning good grades in class work. The secretary and treasurer’s positions will be most adequately filled by following through on the party line. The candidates for junior class president include: All-Campus candidate Dave Ubelhack who has been a strong worker in the Sig Eps projects and should work well with TElKE Dick Roose m management of the junior class affairs. In the first year at UE, sophomore candidates Steven Creek- baum and Bill Jordan managed to become deeply involved in campus affairs, nd both show signs of strong potentil. They ap- pear to be good choices for their respective offices. To finish out the slate AO Pi’s Sherry Meddock was a strong candidate with her freshman class. Since the freshmen candidates have been on campus such a short time we can only comment on those we have personally met or heard other students supporting. For president the Crescent supports Gary Robinson. Our feeling here being based on his maturity and leadership qualities which come from spend- ing a tour of duty with the armed forces in Viet Nam. Along with Gary7 we support Emma Greenfield for treasurer. Emma, since school has started, has involved h erself with campus life, has met a lot of people, and expressed strong ideas about class government. For frosh secretary, Jennie Bryan appears to be the most interested and is a hard worker. Jennie is a Zeta Tau Alpha pledge. We back the two candidates mentioned above and the All- Campus upperclassmen. We further hope the students of UE will join us in this campaign. HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE! I should like to comment on the Negotiation Now Pious For Pcuee article which uppoared in the Sept. 29 issue of the Crescent. The complete concept of the plan is shear fallacy; that of u North Vietnamese negotiation. Ho and company have repeated time and time again that they are not after peace but total victory in Viet Nam. The article states that various leaders, ministers, and organiza- tions are asociated with the peace move. IIow sweet! Well, it should he enlightening to know thut some o fthc organizations und individuals are either communistic or pro-com- munist. I will support my charge with documented proof. 1.

Peaco Force; elimination of barriers to trade with commu- nist countries; and a “hands off Cu- ba policy.” The Congressional Record, Jan. 11, 1962 (pg. A 76) states: \"Its do- mestic goals include total state con- trol of the economic life of the Na- tion; the application of the theories of John Keynes (British Fabrian Economist) ; loyalty checks for Fed- eral employees; and to the halt of congressional investigation of com- munist activities. (Ibid pg. A76, A81, A82. ) Need I say more? 2. Victor Ruether: Here’s my boy! Upon a letter from Russia on Jan. 30, 1934 he wrote — “Carry on the fight for a Soviet America.’’ From the Hearings Special Committee on Un-American Activities (75th Con- fress, 3rd session, Vol. 11, pg. 165- 169.) His close association with and sometime leadership of the com- munists in the U.A.\\V- Union has been exposed in many congressional hearings. (Ibid Vol. 1, pg. 248- 261). 3.

Arther M Schesinger: Mem- ber of A.D.A., he wrote \"If social- ism (i.e. ownership by the state of all significant means of produc- tion) is to preserve democracy it must be brought about step by step, in a way which will not disrupt the fabric of custom, law, and the nat- ural confidence upon the personal fights.” Congressional Record, Feb. 6, 1962. g. A88 1 ) . He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a heavy pro- comunist organization. So much for the facts. Negotiations now states \"We call upon the most powerful nation on earth to stop the bombing now and without conditions.” Well! Can you beat this? Lyndon Jolmson did just that some months ago and look where it got us. He paused the bomb runs on North Viet Nam 32 days. In the meantime: 1 — Russia sent in Migs and Sams, 2 — They resupplied the North with trained North Vietnamese troops, 3 — Red Chinu sent in Chinese regulars and supplies, ut these all together and they spell ESCALATION. The same SAM’s ure shooting Ameri- can planes out of the sky today Trained North Vietnamese and Chinese regulars are fightirig and killing American soldiers at this minute. The bombings are the only way to hurt this enemy. Who do we think we ure fooling? One more good sized bombing pause and hun- dreds more wil l>e killed in Viet Num. There must be Victory, then peace. Then end all bombing. I for one. am sick and tired of these appeasement planners sitting on their backsides thinking up ways to lose the wur. They make my stomach turn. Surely to goodness, people are not so softheaded as to think that this pause is the best way to the peace table, because it isn’t. I think it’s time we realized we are fighting a real war and that it’s taking real lives. The plan further states “We ask North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front to respond af- firmatively.” Here again what must he said? Have Americans become so lax as to believe communism will aceopt peace? I hope not. Lenin said that a funeral dirge will either bo sung over the capitalists or the socialists. There can bo no pea cm, they cannot coexist. Does this give a hint? Karl V.

Dear Freshmen: In entering college you have no doubt been looking forward to four years of immersion in the knowl- edge process in which your mental horizons will be broadened, in which your parochial background will feel the cool breeze of social, cultural, and ideological diversity and in which you v/ill become an individual, well educated and well prepared for your role as commun- ity participant und good citizen. Forget it. Unless you are one of the rare ones, unless you are either so equipped that college will not crip- ple you or so cynical that you are unburdened by the illusion of Aca- deme, these four years will be more dull gray markers on the road to c mifortal le mediocrity. And the sooner lou realize it, the better off you will he. Your four years will be spent in the company of little minds on both sides of the classroom lectures. You will be scribbling notes in the com- pany of “students” whoso every thought and every deed is modery of that term whose capacity for questioning and inquiry ends with the muterial on a f"
