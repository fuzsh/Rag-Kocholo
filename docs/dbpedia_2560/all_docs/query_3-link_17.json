        "text": "Why choose AV Workshop?\n\nAV Workshop has been in business for over 30 yrs and has never lost a client’s master or keepsake. Every staff member at AV Workshop has a B.A. Degree in this field. Since we have a storefront in the San Francisco Bay Area, you can walk in and drop your project off in person.\n\nDo you ship work out like most other shops or do it there?\n\nWe do all work in house. Unlike small camera stores and big box stores like Costco, we perform all work right here in our Redwood City Lab. You can rest easy knowing your project will never leave our shop.\n\nHow long does it take?\n\nDepending on the type of work / media you have, it will take between 1 day and 4 weeks. However, most jobs are turned within 1-2 weeks.\n\nCan I ship my project to you?\n\nAbsolutely, you can order through our online store. You will receive instructions on how and where to ship your project. Orders over $250 qualify for FREE (Round Trip) shipping. For orders below $250, order through our shopping cart and ship it to our address. There is a return shipping fee of $18. You will be notified both when we receive your order and when it ships out. Furthermore, we keep a digital copy of your project backed up on our server for a couple wks after it ships out.\n\n300 Aikido Martial Arts Audio Interviews Transferred to High Quality WAVE Files\n\nAV Workshop recently converted a collection of 300 Aikido martial arts philosophy audio cassette tapes to uncompressed hi-bit rate digital WAVE files. Aikido is not just a physical practice but also a philosophy that aims to promote peace and personal growth. This audio collection contained over 340 oral interviews of Japanese martial art philosophers on their philosophies and practices.\n\nBefore playback, we cleaned, packed, and labeled all the tapes by number. We used professional grade Sony audio cassette decks for capture and ran the audio through high quality stereo cables into a pro audio workstation running Sony Sound Forge. After capture, we applied level optimization to properly balance the levels at approx -6 db.\n\nAV Workshop created a separate WAVE file for each cassette and labeled each file by number (corresponding to the numbers we labeled the tapes). We then dragged the files onto a USB Hard Drive. The audio files are now preserved forever and can now be easily played, shared and edited!

AV Workshop scanned each of these reels frame-by-frame in 2048 x 1536 definition. Now these movies are preserved in a High Definition mp4 format so that they can be easily used in projects for The Mob Museum.\n\nWe use professional grade scanners which feature an enlarged gate – meaning we can scan the entire film frame and nothing gets cut out. We also use a bright and cool LED light source so we get rich, vibrant color with no risk of the film deteriorating.\n\nWe output the films as HD mp4 Files (1920 x 1080p, 50 mb/s) and organize them onto a flash drive. These versatile mp4 files can be edited, shared, and played just about anywhere!

These videotapes feature Frederick Snowden, also known as ‘The Fox’, the first black head coach at a major college in the United States. The 3/4″ U-matic tapes documented various games Snowden coached, some of his inspirational locker room speeches, the creation of his game plan strategies, and even sit down interviews.\n\nAV started by running the tapes through our high-end professional grade tape decks. We used each tape only once as a playback source and captured the footage directly into our editing suite. Once the tapes were captured, we enhanced the audio by raising the gain to about -6 db and applying noise reduction.\n\nAfter this process, we rendered the movies to HD mp4 Files using the H.264 Codec (the max bitrate) and increased the resolution to 1280 x 720 60p. This smooths the motion of the videos and creates sharp detail without jagged edges.\n\nFinally, we dragged the new HD mp4 Files onto a single USB Hard Drive. Now, the movies can be shared, played, edited, and uploaded almost anywhere (Windows, Smart TVs, MAC, etc…)!\n\nCon’t Reading…\n\nAl Capone’s Miami Mansion 16mm Film Enhanced and Converted to Digital mp4 Files\n\nAV Workshop recently worked with The Mob Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada to digitize Al Capone’s 16mm film. This reel was filmed almost 100 years ago in 1929 at his mansion in Miami, Florida. We scanned every frame of this reel 2048 x 1536 resolution and then output it to an HD mp4 File that can be shared, edited, and uploaded.\n\nAt AV Workshop we transfer all film to digital in-house. Our scanners have an enlarged gate – which means we can scan the entire film frame and nothing gets cut out. We also use a bright and cool LED light source so we get rich, vibrant color with no risk of burning the film.\n\nWe export your films as High Definition mp4 Files (1920 x 1080p, 50 mb/s) and organize them onto a flash drive. These files can be edited, shared, and played almost anywhere!

These tapes documented Koko – a gorilla known primarily for her ability to use and understand sign language.\n\nThe Gorilla Foundation not only wanted to preserve these precious tapes, but they also wanted the videos converted to a high quality and editable format so they could be used for future projects.\n\nAV Workshop captured each tape directly into our editing suite using a lossless firewire connector. Then we applied our HD Upres service to output each MiniDV into a separate HD mp4 File (1280×720 60p). As a result, The Gorilla Foundation now has their MiniDV collection preserved as digital files that can be edited, shared, and easily viewed with modern day technology (Smart TV, Laptop, Computer, etc…)!

At AV, we can convert your audio CDs to mp3 and WAVE files. You will receive your files on a USB Flash Drive – which will have all your discs organized by album. All you have to do is click whichever album you’d like and you’ll see all the tracks and their info right there!\n\nCD Ripping is the process of extracting raw audio files from CDs and converting them to a digital file format (such as WAVE or mp3 files). There are many benefits of converting your audio CD library to a digital library. These include preservation of your CDs (digital files can’t get scratched, broken, or damaged), a much more compact way to store all of your CDs, and the ability to share or upload individual tracks. In short, CD Ripping is the transfer of your CDs to digital files in a digital library.\n\nOnce we convert your CDs to Digital, you will receive your original media back along with your flash drive containing your new digital library!
