This Is A Weapon CD NOTEBOOK Fall and Winter CD This band has stickers that say \"THUNDERLIP - we put the cock back in rock\". They're not kidding... from their spandex wearing sweaty shirtless lead singer that sings like Ian Svenonius (of Nation of Ulysses) would if he fronted a cock rock band in the 8Q's. Complete with killer sing-along songs like 'Meat the Snake'... 'Damnation'... 'Fire in the Hole'... Every song makes you want to pump your fist in the air and imagine you were back at a Black Flag or Minor Threat show in the early 8Q's. Not that they sound like Black Flag, or Minor Threat - but they have that same RAW energy that made those bands have a KILLER live show, and I MEAN KILLER Authentic Philly street punk with ex-members of violent society and bomb squad. For fans of the Casualties and Anti-Flag. FANS OF Aphex Twin, The Postal Service... Amazing instrumental electronic music created by Adam Johnson (of L' Spaerow) in his home, on his computer with live instruments/synths/and drum machines. Musical pieces, bits and songs created for the sole purpose of losing yourself inside of his (Adam Johnson's) head while you write, drive, work, paint, walk, or just plain listen and close your eyes... a record for that long drive... a record for that half asleep/half awake 2 AM chill out session with your friends... Blackout! Records Lucid Records Lucid Records BLOODLINED CALLIGRAPHY They Want You Silent CD TORCHE S/T CD TWENTYINCHBURIAL How Much Will We Laugh And Smile CD \"They Want You Silent\", is the debut full length from the female fronted assault of Bloodlined Calligraphy. Vocalist Ally French can hold her own against any other vocalist in the scene (male or female) and the music is well written and executed with a combination of metal and straight forward hardcore without going over the top with either genre. \"Stoner Pop\" has never existed quite like the mind-blowing debut release from Miami, Flordia's TORCHE. It was hinted at by the singer/songwriter Steve Brooks' former group Floor, founded by the mighty Black Sabbath and nearly accomplished by mainstreamers Queens of the Stone Age... but truly anthemic, triumphant and absolutely massive heavy metal has never been so damn catchy! Hot of the heels of their split with With Resistance, Twentyinchburial is back to woo American audiences with their new full length showcasing their brand of positive melodic hardcore/metal.

Are you the gambling type? the risks intro67 I.. ■ into our nascent existence—that ■ we published our first Art & De¬ sign themed issue. Back then, we were tak¬ ing a pretty big gamble by dedicating an entire issue to the art of the underground. People had come to expect music cover¬ age from punk zines, and to throw a curve ball like that issue just a few years into Punk Planet’s life was a risk. It was a risk that paid off, however, as letters and e-mails flowed in from people excited to see a magazine that eschewed the all-bands-all-the-time status quo to focus on some of the other amazing work coming out of this culture. Since that issue, we’ve incorporated a much wider scope of cultural coverage in the pages of Punk Planet, and the un¬ derground has also become more inclu¬ sive of art forms other than music. But it’s still a nice change of pace to dedi¬ cate an entire issue to art every now and then. And so it is that I’m proud to in¬ troduce the latest in our Art & Design series: Art & Design Three. This issue picks up where the previ¬ ous two left off, by documenting some of the best artists and designers in the un¬ derground (or anywhere, for that matter). But this issue also pushes into new areas as well, covering fashion design, tattoo art, mapmaking, and even someone who uses love as an art form. It’s an eclectic mix full of amazing things to look at—and interest¬ ing stories to read. It’s been a true pleasure putting it together; I hope you enjoy it. I’m also excited to announce the third book from Punk Planet Books is now available. Lessons in Taxidermy, by Bee Laven¬ der, is a moving, yet darkly comic, true- life tale of struggles with illness and pov¬ erty and finding the strength to overcome it all. It’s an unforgettable story, and one I’m especially glad to help tell.

Various sites dis¬ cussed the hippest new compa¬ nies or the hottest new looks, but no one really dug in and talked about design. Vit, a designer himself, found this to be an industry¬ wide problem. “It is important for designers to know how to talk about graphic design,” he says. Inspired by Typographi- ca, a typographic online jour¬ nal, he founded Speak Up, a virtual meeting place for de¬ signers to come together and verbally spar over design issues while educating one another and exchanging information. Designers slowly took no¬ tice of the online forum de¬ voted to critical thought and discussion of design until ev¬ eryone from unknowns to big¬ ger name designers such as Art Chantry and Michael Beirut were posting on the site. The site “has leveled the playing field,” comments Vit. “Anyone can write. Anyone can have his or her opinion heard if you make a good point. If you take the time to write a thoughtful comment on some topic, people will pay atten¬ tion. That is what is great: You don’t have to be a name to have your ideas published.” Designers found Speak Up in many different ways. Some hear through friends and colleagues while others stumbled across it. “Some of my work was being trashed on the site and I inadvertently found out,” says Debbie Mill- man, a Speak Up writer and president of Sterling Group, NY office. “I popped in to voice my opinion and add to the discussion and immedi¬ ately felt that this forum was doing something that I had not fully experienced before. Speak Up was holding people accountable. And it was doing so in real time and in an en¬ tirely immediate and mean¬ ingful way.” Today, Speak Up attracts 7,300 to 13,000 hits per day and has drawn over 25> 000 comments on 9^0 entries during the past two-and-a- half years. The entries range from the redesign of the UPS logo, to how to start your own design studio, to the demise of deconstructive typography. A pool of 14 authors publish¬ es entries pertaining to any¬ thing dealing with design. By their involvement in Speak Up, these authors have evolved into part of the new crop of up-and-coming design critics and writers. “It has provided a lot of people a place where they have discovered they can write, states Byrony Gomez-Pala- cio, designer, contributor and Vit’s wife. “In this third gen¬ eration of authors, there are a couple of people who have never written in their lives other then e-mails, and now they realize that one, they have something to say and two, they can actually say it. Differ¬ ent magazines are beginning to look at Speak Up for new voices.” Vit and Gomez-Palacio keep loose reigns over the site, censoring almost nothing and letting the community flourish and police itself. Most members post under their real names and even give links to their portfolio sites, which is almost unheard of on other online forums. Some see this level of openness, freedom, and lack of editing at times as a double- edged sword. “On the one hand this blog—and it’s not really a blog anymore, but a meeting place, a salon—forces design¬ ers to collect their thoughts and write intelligently about issues both serious and trivi¬ al.” comments Steven Heller, art director of the New York Times Book Review and design writ¬ er and critic. “On the other it allows designers to drivel without the benefit of edito¬ rial oversight. Unlike letters to the editor, which are vetted before publication, these im¬ mediate response mechanisms thwart circumspection. Speak Up is, however, a terrific start¬ ing point possibly for the next generation of design critics and commentators.” Pros and cons aside, Speak Up is an invaluable space for PUNK PLANET 11 “We come from a tradition of non-tradition.” Chicago’s watchers challenge the familiarity OF THE MODERN ROCK SONG. W atchers are the way to go. From the percussive handclaps and un¬ forgettable '60s car-chase riffs of “To the Rooftops/' to the heav¬ ily-textured, no-wave guitar lines of “Mono Man,’’ this Chicago band plays music that is modern, challenging, and draws from a savvy record junkie's most vaunted collection—the Clash, Talking Heads, dub, soul, and African drum music. Their new album, Dunes Phase, captures the band moving in a brave new direction, bringing an intelligent, catchy perspective to the atypical rock song. I talked to Michael Guarrine, the group's propulsive singer, Ethan D'Ericole, guitar player, and Chris Kralik, bassist, before their show at the recently-renovated Fireside Bowl, where Watchers, only a few years before, had played their first set ever. Dunes Phase is a real departure from your first record, which featured more of a dance groove and less aggressive four/four beats. Why’d you decide to move toward a more simplified rock sound? Michael: The last record was a full-length that we basically re¬ corded in a week. It was insanely ambitious. We had to do the songs, the string parts, the girl back-up singers. So for Dunes Phase, we decided to do it in chunks. We decided to let it breathe, designers to reach out and teach others and themselves to be better designers. “Fre¬ quent visits to Speak Up, ei¬ ther as a lurker or participant, may help fellow designers be¬ come more insightful and critical of themselves, their ^ I f something like this was I happening in another neighborhood, people would pay more attention,” says Juan Miguel Turnil, executive di¬ rector of the Little Village En¬ vironmental Justice Organiza¬ tion in Chicago. “But when clients, and the profession,” states Mark Kingsley, founder of Greenberg Kingsley design and Speak Up contributor. “Sitting alone in your cubicle, just doing your job, doesn’t help anyone.” —Kirsten Sorten Join the discussion at: www.underconsideration.com/speakup. we’re talking about our neigh¬ borhood, it’s not a priority for them. They say, ‘We’ll look into it.’ ” Turnil’s concerns about pollution in his neighbor¬ hood are mirrored through¬ out his community. Some vis¬ tas in Little Village and near¬ by Pilsen—adjacent mostly La¬ tino working-class neighbor¬ hoods—look like scenes from the industrial revolution. Plumes of smoke and steam bil¬ low from smokestacks at two of the country’s oldest and dirti¬ est coal-burning power plants. Freight trains chug along the perimeters, and trucks barrel down the main arteries. Fac¬ tories making cheese, steel fix¬ tures, and other goods are nes¬ tled among quaint residential three-flats, vibrant stretches of small businesses and crum¬ bling but stately columned buildings. Right in the heart of Pilsen, a century-old foundry making brass ingots releases clouds of greenish, foul-smell¬ ing smoke. There are few green spac¬ es or even trees. Not surpris¬ ingly, rates of asthma and oth¬ er respiratory problems in the community are high, especially among children. Some of the Mexican families here came from cities with pollution just as bad or worse. Others have never had to deal with this type of soot or grime before. Since its inception as a magnet for immigrants from Eastern Europe, Pilsen has always been a neighborhood known for community orga¬ nizing and resistance. Now, residents are putting this ener¬ gy into cleaning up the neigh¬ borhood. And they don’t mean getting rid of “undesirable” homeless people or gang mem¬ bers as some use that phrase: They mean forcing polluters to clean up their acts. “People are living in and breathing this smoke. Something has to be done.” IN THE CHICAGO COMMUNITY OF PILSEN, RESIDENTS ARE JOINING TOGETHER TO COMBAT POLLUTERS. 12 PUNK PLANET static PP67 so there’s a heck of a lot more space. We decided to use the studio as another instrument, to flesh the songs out. It seems like you’re trying to play rock in a new, interesting way. It’s hard to do something different with a rock song. Did you make a con¬ scious choice to keep the instrumentation simple-no horns, no strings, no back-up singers? Chris: The first record proves were the world’s biggest over¬ analysts when it comes to songwriting. This new record has been a kind of deprogramming to try and trim some of the fat and not to get so in our heads. Michael: At the time we recorded the first record, we wanted to make it special. We wanted it to sound like nothing else that was happening at that moment. We recorded it on Sly Stone s board; we wanted it to sound like it was in the tradition of some of the music we’d been listening to: Syl Johnson’s Is It Because I’m Black?, Curtis Mayfield, and other Chicago soul like the Chi-Lites. Just like the Clash, you’re a group of mostly white dudes responding to black soul music. How much of an influence were they? Ethan: We all grew up with the Clash. I wouldn t say they were a di¬ rect influence on the new record, but they’re so much in us. Michael: But other bands as well—like the Slits, who were really influenced by reggae. Early on, we identified with those bands, and started to discover where their influences came from. Ethan: We’re all record collectors and spend a lot of money on records. You can’t help but get those sources out of you. Some¬ times you’ll write a song and realize it’s very similar to something you were listening to that day. I’ve come to grips with the fact that I might be clearly influenced by something. For Dunes Phase, bands like the Outsiders, this Dutch band, were influential, the Ethiopique compilations, and maybe some Alice Cooper. How do the lyrics connect to the music, Michael? Michael: All of the songs on Dunes Phase are about these out¬ sider views coming together: from the opening track, To the Rooftops,” where I sing, “I want to be hunted in my homeland,” to the other songs throughout. With the lyrics, I was trying to come to grips with how, being in music, we’re kind of on the outside a lot, and trying to take different opinions about being outsid¬ ers. As a band, we don’t necessarily fit on a bill, we get lumped in with other different-sounding bands. Chicago itself is an out¬ sider city. We come from a tradition of non-tradition. The last song, “Blik’em” is a kind of bookend to all the other songs. I sing, “Bless this house, and let the big hand lock us, stare, I am not aware, I am not aware to blink away. I am too aware I m an out¬ sider.” I’m basically saying that we all come from different back¬ grounds, but we’re all in this together, we’re all under this one house, this one roof. —JoeMeno For more on Watchers, go to www. watchersmusic.com. Until recently, many Pilsen residents didn’t even know what was going on in H Kramer, the brass foundry two blocks from one of the neigh¬ borhood’s few parks. But they knew what came out of it— rancid smelling smoke and par¬ ticulate matter that would collect on their cars and windowsills. Scorecard, the pollu¬ tion information website (www. scorecard.org), lists H Kramer in the top IO percent of indus¬ tries nationwide in emissions of toxic and cancer-causing com¬ pounds, the main ones being lead and nickel. Lead poisoning is a serious danger that can lead to mental impairment and oth¬ er problems, especially for the many children in the area. Last summer, activists with the local Green Party canvassed for a non-binding referen¬ dum on the November ballot in one precinct asking if residents wanted a complete, public inves¬ tigation of the content and risk factor of H Kramer’s emissions. Ninety-five percent said yes. Shortly after, officials from the city’s Department of the Envi¬ ronment met with members of a new group calling itself PERRO (Pilsen Environmental Rights and Reform Organization, or in Spanish, “dog,” as in watchdog). “Frequently an overpow¬ ering, foul-smelling smoke spews out of the H Kram¬ er building, coming not only from the stacks but even from the cracks between the bricks of the building itself,” said Karen Sheets, of PERRO, at a recent press conference. “It has received many complaints from residents and been fined tens of thousands of dollars by the EPA over the years, but still the pollution continues.” The department agreed to work with PERRO and the EPA to do an investigation of H Kramer. (The president of H Kramer didn’t return calls for this story). Dorian Breuer, a resident activist, noted that working with the city is part of a multi¬ pronged approach to pollution in the neighborhood. This ap¬ proach also includes public fo¬ rums and grassroots action by residents. “It may be that the emis¬ sions aren’t illegal, [and the companies] may be meeting requirements under current policy,” Breuer said. “So we may ask them to go beyond just meeting the requirements. This smoke is filling people’s apartments when their win¬ dows are open in the sum¬ mer. People are living in and breathing this smoke. Some¬ thing has to be done.” For several years now, residents have also been put¬ ting pressure on power com¬ pany Commonwealth Edison and its parent Midwest Genera¬ tion to reduce emissions at the two coal-burning power plants. Since both were built long be¬ fore the Glean Air Act took ef¬ fect in 1977, they are exempt from meeting clean air stan¬ dards.

W ith a new collection out from Top Shelf Comics and daily strips available online, Tom Hart’s best-known character Hutch Owen may be tough to avoid in 2005.

Little Vil¬ lage Environmental Justice Organization’s Turnil agrees: “We’re talking about discrimi¬ nation and racism against our community.” —Kari Lydersen ary Hutch is a voice of anger and despair that somehow avoids cyni¬ cism, instead clinging to hopes pinned on the example of the few and the innate decency of the indi¬ vidual. And it's funny, too. I spoke with Hart about what goes into making a Hutch story. What do you hope readers take from a Hutch Owen story? I want to create a humorous, intimate look at the struggle of dealing with this world. I actu¬ ally don’t have an agenda; my aim is to just detail the battles that exist in my own heart, and to detail these more vividly by creating a cartoon stage where everything can be focused, in¬ tensified and exaggerated to better look at the truth of the whole thing. Hopefully peo¬ ple walk away slightly cleansed, slightly richer from having ex¬ perienced it. You’ve gone from Xeroxed mini¬ comics to long-form narratives to daily strips. Does your approach to writing change from one format to another? The medium usually shapes the material, and more often than not, I’ve chosen my format be¬ fore doing the work. This is true lately of the daily and weekly strips I do. I wanted finally to test Hutch Owen out in that sort of format, and had to learn those rhythms and parameters before I began. I suspected, correctly, that this format would allow me much quicker access to the ma¬ terial that was always building up in my sketchbooks, but never fleshed out. Really, I’ve only done a few different formats. In my Xerox days I was often at the limits of my ability. That was ev¬ erything I was capable of. Once I decided to do longer stories, the length was decided by the story—32 pages, 42. One was 93 - It There are other things I’d like to try, and in those cases the medium would be the starting point. I’m fond of encyclope¬ dic works that detail entireties of data in complete, ordered form. Lists, contrast and com¬ pare, etc. I’d like to do that with Hutch someday. “I think I do OK farce, but every time I try satire, I see someone else do it better.” INSIDE THE MIND OF COMICS ARTIST TOM HART. 14 PUNK PLANET static PP67 \\ e\\f<£v VVcjUf ^ se a rock. -Vbf'^k +W of ,|U •«. v 4 «e^ < -Hi « ci*» 4 0*0’* **«*'«_ K^*wa - b > u ^< l ; w «* *■‘*•*''4 \\ 4 lenT«.*« 4^«.»' ^ ^ ^ AVN A ^ 4 V\\> j. -H\\e v*b« 4 * uj« 4 ' I* i»< n ~ 7 -|/ \\ «ifWec( £\"(*<•« »C 4-«> \\<;55 * 5 ^« 5 a«<|. r* ^td“ uo«- fciSi*M j U'J'vfc J *VW $4-c«r* c<*V vvj ei5 a ji es 4® u* UV\\U 1 6 V' Ifl i W cj , You’ve written Hutch stories for 10 years now, the earliest pre¬ dating the Iraq invasion, the USA PATRIOT Act, September 11, and even Bush’s presidency. Have these events changed your read¬ ership? And do you approach the stories differently now than, say, six years ago? I really have no idea who my readers are. It seems the whole culture is much more galva¬ nized, and hopefully some people have become interested in my work. Sad to say, but in this culture, you gotta market everything, and aggressively promote stuff if you want it out there. I do try to get more and more people checking it out, but that eats into drawing time. As for approaching the sto¬ ries differently, I think these things you mention have made me angrier. In the early work I was confused by what this cul¬ ture expects of its adults. I m still almost equally confused— though now it’s more about why this culture has been al¬ lowed to develop to this point. But I can’t imagine just rant¬ ing all the time. We have Randi Rhodes for that! I need to be constructive in the middle of all this, in my own way—laugh¬ ter, line and farce. Until November 10 you shied from humor that specifically addressed the 2004 elections. What made you decide to take it on after the polls closed? I’m more interested in emo¬ tional and psychological truth than commentary. Sifting out world events actually helps me come to new understand¬ ings about them. But there are some—September II and Bush’s victory this November— that went right to my heart, which is where the work comes from. I had to deal with those issues directly. I felt deeply for some time that Bush couldn t win again. I was so devastated afterwards that I couldn t let it go undealt with. I forced my characters to feel what I felt, which again, is where I start. Another exception is Grover Norquist, a son of a bitch I find so disgusting and weird that I have to comment on him. He s a cartoon character already— just super dangerous. I dont B ernie Dwyer first went to Cuba in 1988 as a brigadista working in the orange groves.

I think I do OK farce, but every time I try satire, I see some¬ one else do it better. So I stick with my own reactions, which is usually more useful to me than commenting directly on current events.

As this culture gets stranger and more dan¬ gerous (and thus affecting me more directly and immediate¬ ly) I may do more straight com¬ mentary. —Chris Burkhalter Radio Havana.

PUNK PLANET 15 “One man’s boomtown is another man’s boom town.” SCULPTOR DAN GILSDORF PEERS BEHIND THE FACADE OF AMERICAN MANHOOD I f you bumped into him on the streets of his hometown Portland, Oregon, you probably wouldn’t peg Dan Gilsdorf as a gender-conscious artist. At six-foot-four and covered from chest to toe in tattoos—including a pair of evil Siamese twins on his forearm—he sometimes looks more like a bouncer than a cultural critic. Not to mention that he spends most of his free time in his garage (now converted to a studio), or that he wears Car- harts, builds tattoo machines from scratch, and enjoys shooting guns. In short, Dan is a whole lot of man , and in some way his artwork celebrates masculinity—it’s loaded with images of cowboys, tattoos, fighter jets, and battleships. But a conversation with Gilsdorf or a closer inspection of his artwork quickly reveals a disarming, intelligent sensitivity combined with a keen and critical eye. One series of Gilsdorf's photographs feature men's bare torsos with knives, handguns, and various weaponry laid across their hearts. The images themselves are affixed to antique army canteens, suggesting one of the artist's predominant themes: the archaic, dangerous nature of our culture’s traditional ideas about manhood and violence. I recently caught up with Dan, mano y mano, to discuss his artwork, activism, and the nature of the beast. information on right-wing Cuban militants in Miami. Dwyer approached the sub¬ ject from a purely objective stand¬ point and says she maintained that attitude all the way through, de¬ clining even to meet or correspond with the men to make sure that she didn't become too emotionally involved with the story. What she found through her reporting, she said in February, was an example of clearly biased and irrational behavior by US courts in convict¬ ing the men of charges relating to conspiracy and spying when they were not alleged to have procured a single classified document or piece of information. The film includes clips of right-wing Cuban expatriate Or¬ lando Bosch declaring, on na¬ tional television, that he sees nothing wrong with blowing up a plane and other acts he has been charged with because they are in the context of a war against leftist leader Fidel Castro. She documents how the Five actually sought to cooperate with the FBI in avoiding further terrorist acts by right wing Cubans, though they were ultimately rebuffed and ig¬ nored by the US government. One of the main points you seem to be making with this film is that there is a double standard in the US’s treatment of alleged or po¬ tential terrorism, depending on who the “terrorists” are. I deliberately called the movie Mission Against Terror to point that out. These men were fight¬ ing against terrorism. You see [right-wing Cubans] admit¬ ting their attempts to assassi¬ nate Fidel Castro and to blow up planes. Orlando Bosch is one of the most dangerous ter¬ rorists alive, and Bush [Sr] just ignored that and allowed him to stay here. Does the double standard you describe have to do with political pressure or lobbying in the US? Florida is one of the key states in elections. The president wants to get elected, and once he gets in, he wants to stay in. The Cuban right wing have managed to gain power at every level in this country including in the media. What is the current status of the Cuban Five case, and where can someone get more information? Were waiting for the results of an appeal filed last March. The judge has asked for more docu¬ ments, which is a good sign that they’re taking it seriously. To correspond with them—because they will write back—you can go to freethefive.org. When you’re in Cuba, what is daily life like for you? They don’t pay us very much, but I get a ration every month of beans, sugar, rice, butter, coffee, rum. The women get cigarettes if they want them and the men get cigars. Though now there’s a big anti-smoking push going on. Just to show the way the media treats Cuba, now they’re trying to say that Fidel won’t let people smoke anymore. That’s ridiculous. This is a very serious socialist project, but they have an un¬ derstanding that people need to have a good time, to have a drop of rum and a cigar. —Kari Lydersen See www.freethefive.org for more on the Cuban Five. 16 PUNK PLANET static PP67 What originally drew you to masculinity as a subject? It was something I always struggled with personally. Growing up, I was never a particularly masculine person, but not really feminine either. IVe always been interested in motivation and what moti¬ vates people to behave in illogical ways. Specifically I’m thinking of things like fighting and pridefulness; both of these are based on a lot of ridiculous ideas about masculinity. And now we find ourselves in a situation where our political leadership is unable to separate their rash notions of “manliness” and “resolve” from rational thought concerning foreign policy. The war in Iraq, for example, was sold like some macho cowboy action—it was stated in terms of gender and that made it easier for people to stomach. I notice a lot of cowboy imagery in your work, like in the woodcarving “Boomtown “Boomtown” is about the line between cowboys and soldiers, and it plays with the word “Boomtown” as a double-entendre. When I made the piece I was thinking a lot about Iraq, and the phrase “One man’s boomtown is another man’s boom town” kept run¬ ning through my mind—one guy gets riches and “glory,” but an¬ other guy gets his family slaughtered and his house blown up. Do you believe in heroes? I absolutely do. But I find the traditional presentation of heroism a little problematic. Heroic figures ought to be portrayed as they really are, with all their flaws and difficult traits intact. Most of our cultural heroic canon gets saddled with a veneer of infallibil¬ ity, but I think heroes do us the most good when we’re able to see that they’re flawed just like the rest of us. Martin Luther King, for example, is in my top five heroes list, but he was a lot more complex than he’s usually portrayed in the media. His philandering was pretty common knowledge. In a culture that tends to value men’s capacity to destroy rather than create, how effective a tool is art for political activism? I ‘d say that it is one of the most effective tools we have. Creating, be it art, music, performance, writing, conversation, philoso¬ phy, etc. is really all about self-determination. It’s about conceiv¬ ing of a world that contains things it now lacks and then making that world out of whatever materials and using whatever skills are available. This is a powerful thing and it’s devalued in our culture because it is bad for those who now control the culture. And on the other hand: with a population who knew they had the power to create their own worlds, to control their own identities, would we tolerate being told how the world works by supposed “experts”? In reality, the population does have this power—art is the proof. Have you ever been in a fistfight? There was the recent fistfight with the CD player in my studio in which I was soundly defeated. —Justin Hocking Get Your War On BY DAVID REES ^ I’m gonna be so pissed if Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons.

J PUNK PLANET 17 “These people are major blasts to be around.” ARTIST AND SOCIAL WORKER JOHN SPEAR USES ARTWORK AND PERFORMANCE TO CONNECT WITH THE HOMELESS. T here was a time at the close of the last century when the work of John Spear seemed to be everywhere. His Social Worker series—a collection of cartoon animals exploring “The real-world relationship of the community mental-health worker and the community participant,” as Spear describes it—the large cloth wall hangings riffing on Japanese refreshments, or his second film Mantrack (2000), the Chicago artist and social worker's creations were everywhere. Then suddenly Spear slipped off the radar: no more shows, no news of his current work. He had simply decided to retreat from the public and focus on his new marriage and his position as the Clinical Administrator of Psychosocial Rehabilitation at the Heartland Alliance. Recently, however, he decid¬ ed to re-enter the art world, and spoke to me about his current work. How has your re-entry into the art world been? I’ve been luckier than most artists. For a while, I didn’t have any reason to show my artwork. I didn’t want to be more famous. I’d rather be someone who influences other people as a teacher or “After about three weeks of painting on the walls, you start to get bored.” A STRUGGLING ARTS ORGANIZATION ON Chicago’s west side offers kids a place TO CREATE A NEW FUTURE. O n an unseasonably warm Saturday in February on Chicago’s west side, Katie Young and Amy Cimini are leading an expedition. With II kids in tow they’re hunting down the lost sounds of the neighborhood and recording them on a small mp3 play¬ er. After their long journey, they plan to return to Artist and Children Create Togeth¬ er (ACCT), a drop-in center that occupies a small store¬ front building on a corner in the Humboldt Park neighbor¬ hood. When they arrive, they’re greeted with pizza and juice, and they spend the rest of the afternoon making instru¬ ments out of household items: wood blocks, glue, balloons, glitter, and anything else they can find. It’s the last day of a week-long music workshop, and Cimini and Young have been showing these kids there’s more to music than scales and sheet music. For more that 12 years, ACCT has been inviting artists and artisans from all over the city to teach the kids who live in this quiet section of Hum¬ boldt Park. Each week they have a different project for the kids to work on. Casey Droege and Rebecca Grady run the activities at the drop-in center. “The adminis¬ trative staff changes a lot,” says Droege. “We really depend on volunteers. People come in and teach week-long workshops” It’s this steady stream of volunteers that allows ACCT to offer the kids a wide variety of activi¬ ties. In fact both Droege and Grady started as volunteers. Droege taught a bookmaking class nearly four years ago—and applied for a job when one of the coordinators quit. “We try to draw in as many different activities as possi¬ ble,” says Droege “because af¬ ter about three weeks of paint¬ ing on the walls, you start to get bored.” This week, the kids at ACCT are “building instru¬ ments, and then we’re going to have a concert at the end of the day,” Young explains. She is a musician, having studied bas¬ soon at Oberlin College, and she’s helping seven-year-old Miranda Thomas make ma- racas out of wood blocks. “I’ve been wanting to do something like this for a long time, so when Rebecca invited us, we had a lot of ideas.” Last summer they plant¬ ed a community garden—which they continue to maintain and use when the weather is right— and they had a bike workshop. “Working Bikes gave us 20 bikes. We fixed them up spray painted them and made these big paper-mache things to put on them, and we had a parade around the neighborhood.” 18 PUNK PLANET static PP67 social worker and apply my art to that endeavor. That type of rec¬ ognition is a rarity. How does your work with the homeless relate to your artwork? As a clinical administrator there is a good deal of work that simply has to be done. The same came be said for stretching and prepar¬ ing a canvas: It doesn’t feel particularly artistic. My direct-service and training opportunities relate to art most obviously but I bet my boss would disagree and say I appear to think oddly—as an art¬ ist—most of the time in my other functions as well. What is your process, then, and how does the issue of homelessness affect the work produced? For the last several years I have been doing puppet performances with groups of students, clinicians, and participants. They watch a puppet show of a scene between a social worker and Emmit, the “difficult mentally ill client.” It goes like this: the social worker shows up and tries to get Emmit to accept mental health treatment with a variety of interventions. Unless the social worker is per¬ fect—and who is—Emmit’s directive is to resist if he isn’t met on his level. From there the group of participants are invited to cri¬ tique the social workers’ methods and discuss personal anecdotes of disappointment or satisfaction with their interactions with social workers. After a bunch of very interesting perspectives, we take the crowds’ recommendation to correct the social worker behavior and act it out to their satisfaction. It is one of the highlights of my week. Watching them defend the social worker’s bad behavior, recogniz¬ ing opportunities for growth, and then contributing to change them. It is an empowering creative process and artistically satisfy¬ ing. There are a bunch of other methods that are client-specific. I collaborated with this guy who was pissed off with nearly every¬ body including me. I told him I wanted to give him a good time dealing with his anger. I told him that it would be OK for him to draw his violent fantasies that he had about other people and proj¬ ect them onto me in drawings while I counseled him. He ended up drawing hundreds of monsters destroying me with hammers, heavy earthmovers, and diatribes. We laughed and laughed about them. They seemed to really help him. He became very adept at manag¬ ing his anger. It was good for both of us. The wealth of talent in this population is enormous. Totally the funniest people on Earth, smart funny. These people are major blasts to be around. How do you deal with accusations of “colonizing” or “using” homeless subjects as an educated artist? Let me try to express it this way: I try to maintain a moral mind¬ fulness on the issue of exploitation. If someone has this issue with my art I am unaware of it. —Ben Tanker See www.heartlandalliance.org for more. Other workshops have includ¬ ed video workshops where the kids made action figures and shot videos imitating the style of MTV Cribs. It’s Miranda’s first day at the drop in center. Her family recently moved into the neigh¬ borhood. While eating her fourth piece of pizza, she says, “My mom sent me because I like to draw. Everyday when I’m done with my homework I just draw and draw.” Miranda has a twin brother, “but he wouldn’t want to come, and I’m glad—he bothers me.” Unfortunately for kids like Miranda, ACCT has fallen on some difficult times. The orga¬ nization recently lost both their regular grants; now they’re al¬ most completely dependant on community and private dona¬ tions. On top of that, gentri- fication is pushing families out of the neighborhood. “A lot of our regulars have moved away because of the new condos that were built in the neighbor¬ hood,” says Droege. “And we haven’t really been able to es¬ tablish a relationship with the new neighbors yet.” In January, Droege and Grady cut their hours almost in half. Still, Droege isn’t ready to give up. She’s looking for some part-time work, but she’s also looking to find new funding. “It’s a really wonderful place to work,” she says. “We just have so much freedom. Last year we had an end-of-the-semester party. We turned the whole front room into Alaska, we toasted marsh¬ mallows to make smores over a little camping stove, and we told ghost stories. You couldn’t do that anywhere else.” The most amazing part for both Grady and Droege is the way they’ve become a fixture of the neighborhood. “They know where we live,” adds Grady. “They know they can come knock on our door and ask us when the art place is I n middle school, Molly Zucker- man was tortured for being too loud, too big, and too smart.

PUNK PLANET 19 Gallery: Up Against A Wall ARTWORK BY SWOON nism, politics, trees and rain. Molly recently spent a year running a gal¬ lery in our hometown of Olympia, WA, and then left to formally study art for the first time at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. We caught up there to talk about her current work. What are you working on now? The question I keep coming back to these days is women’s sexual power. I like thinking about it in terms of revolution¬ ary potential, and also in terms of my own life. I make art about it even when I don’t want to. I put vaginas in trees. Just paint a vagina into a tree, and I don’t know why. It’s very 1970s, con¬ sciousness-raising stuff. What is female desire? What is it to be an active desirer? What is it to want anything? Tell me about the pictures. I like to paint trees. I got really obsessed with trees when I first moved here. You used to hate trees! It’s true! I would actually talk about hating trees. I got ro¬ manced by the trees here. They got all boney in the fall, and they looked really gaunt and skeletal and interesting, I’d stop my bike and draw them all the time. How have your paintings been af¬ fected by growing up in the Olym¬ pia punk scene? I think of myself as complete¬ ly formed by both the terrible experiences of middle school and high school, and then the punk, queer, indie rock scene. You know I only started paint¬ ing seven years ago. I feel like it was this desperate attempt to find a creative outlet. I’ve always been an artist, or you know, an outsider, whether I’m choosing it or whether it’s put upon me. So I would have found an out¬ sider scene of some kind. And I just happened to be in Olympia so I stayed there. I wanted to be a musician, basically, or a per¬ formance artist, Instead I was just mad all the time, ’cause I wasn’t doing anything, I felt like I didn’t have a participatory iden¬ tity. Finding painting for me was the beginning of not being a spectator. At this point in my life I’m still scared shitless to be cre¬ ative in front of people. Painting allows for all this expression, all this free movement, all this joy and color and beauty and pain, but nobody else has to know I’m doing it while I’m doing it. Then I can step aside and people can look at it, but I don’t have to be the embodiment of it. You’re listening to Led Zeppelin as we talk. What do you think of Led Zeppelin? I think they rock. It’s very sexy music, and totally offensive. It always makes me freak out and just wanna go burn down a city, do a lot of coke, and then fuck all night long. Not that I ever do any of that—I just stay in my house feeling that way. I get re¬ ally mad that men are allowed to feel desire to this crazy de¬ gree, rock out with their cocks out or whatever. So are you saying that you’re a feminist? Yeah. I feel like that’s old fash¬ ioned, like I should be post¬ feminist. But society is so god¬ damned misogynist. Misogyny and racism and classism—be¬ tween those three things, there’s no space. I’m just fighting to keep clarity here. —NomyLamm 20 PUNK PLANET static PP67 New York City-based Swoon uses linoleum block or woodcut printing techniques and lifesize paper cut-outs to comment on and contribute to the decay of forgotten urban areas in her city.

O utrageous Nina Hagen: There was the time Nina was asked on an Austrian talk show what was wrong with the youth of today; she replied by masturbating. Or, there was Nina on MTV in its early days, talking to a UFO through her shoe. But Nina's antics have sometimes eclipsed the whole of her: Nina Hagen—serious animal rights ac¬ tivist, environmentalist, spiritual devotee, and master vocalist and songwriter. Nina entered 2004 with Big Band Explosion , Hagen-ized ver¬ sions of jazz and pop standards. And now she's got a clothing line— Mother of Punk—all up and ready to explode. Your new fashion line, Mother of Punk, doesn’t contain any fur or leather. Why do you think so many designers are still clinging to these materials? They lack the ethics, vision and humanity! They are mon¬ ey-hungry monsters who don’t give a shit! People like Nao¬ mi Campbell first fought for the cause of treating animals ethically, and then changed their minds. They represent the dinosaur-fashion era. The glamour world is great fun, but we need to evolve. What made you nod to your punk past in naming your line? In my heart and soul, I am both a punk and a mother. I found so much love, creativ¬ ity, solidarity and freedom in the punk movement of the late ’70s. Punk is not limit¬ ed. Punk embraces everything but rejects ignorance. Punk grows like a tree. Punk is uni¬ versal. Punk is fun, humor, rebellion and individualism. It’s like a child: free, honest and sweet and sometimes very loud and even angry, silly and ridiculous. Big Band Explosion was released independently, after years of your appearance on major labels. I am just a musician. I love making music—love singing, writing, producing, creating. Independent label or not, it’s what it is. I prefer to work, pro¬ duce, and finance my albums myself, and when production is finished, then we find the right company. Major compa¬ nies tended to be too involved in my artistic territories. That was too many cooks cooking in one pot. Do you get discouraged by the state of the world, or are you filled with so much faith that it never keeps you down? The state of the world is our lesson in karma. The state of the world starts within each of us. Let’s all find and trea¬ sure the source, the immortal true self: ourselves. We can¬ not love the world if we don’t love ourselves. Therefore we must fight the good fight. With truth, love and force, because we have to force our¬ selves out of lethargy. We must force ourselves to be happy and healthy, true and great. —Jojoboy Www.motherofpunk.com sells vegan clothing for punks.

N W, WASH., D.C. 20007-1802 r above: Consume (2003) two single lengths of zipper I t may sound strange, but there’s something about seeing a Cat Chow dress up close that takes me back to my sixth-grade sci¬ ence class, when our teacher had us prick our fingers and smudge a single drop of blood on a thin sheet of glass so we could examine it under a microscope. I had read about cells, cell mem¬ branes, and mitochondria, but I was skeptical until I saw the dark red fade as I turned up the magnification to get a closer look. Suddenly ev¬ erything I saw seemed more fascinatingly com¬ plex than I had ever imagined. So years later, when I first read about Chow—a Chicago-based artist/fashion designer who uses chain-mail techniques to render gar¬ ments from a wide variety of common house¬ hold items, like tape measures, tissues, cellular phones, dollar bills, and anything else she can get her hands on—I had to check it out. Chow’s work is a strange brew of the resourceful DIY craft, high art, avante-garde couture, and com¬ plex geometric design. From far away, the clean lines of her pieces are elegantly understated and simple, but on closer inspection you'll often find her work is an elaborate puzzle in which each piece has been joined by hand, one at a time. Chow is gaining recognition throughout the fashion and art communities for her stunning, imaginative designs as well as her meticulously constructed garments. In 2000 she received the Avante Garde Design Vision award in Gen Art International Design Competition. In 2003 she won the very prestigious Louis Comfort Tiffany Award. Most recently, she received the 2005 Fellowship Award in Visual Arts from the Illinois Arts Council. She has also scheduled several shows throughout the US in 2005, and in March she will be showing her work in Paris for the first time. I had a chance to visit with Cat Chow and her two tail-less cats in February where she showed me her latest zipper concoctions and explained how she discovered her calling for a fashion statement that saw its heyday in the Dark Ages. Interview by Cate Levinson Portrait by Suzy Poling So you started making chain mail in college, and it’s continued to be a major influence for you. Why? I continue working on it and even though my work has changed a lot, it’s the medium I feel most comfortable working in. My early chain-mail works were done in this very basic pattern. In my early work I was sticking to the materials and patterns used to make medieval armor. And if you look at my recent work, I really try to challenge 26 PUNK PLANET myself to invent new ways of putting the pieces together. I love chain mail because you can add and take away pieces seam¬ lessly. I have a strong math background, so I like figuring that out. You were a good math student? Is that what you were studying in school? Well, when I came out here for school at Northwestern, I was accepted into this ac¬ celerated math/social science program. I hadn’t even though about it when I made the decision. I got accepted, and I didn’t think about whether or not I actually want¬ ed to do it, I just went. Halfway through my first quarter there, I realized I didn’t want to be in it. I would hear all these theater majors who lived on my floor talk about how they had to go to costume crew, and go sew all afternoon after they got out of class. Technically they were complaining about how they had to sew all afternoon, but I was like, “You got to sew all after¬ noon? And you’re making all these cos¬ tumes? That sounds really interesting!” I had always been interested in clothing, and I did a lot of hand sewing when I was younger, so I dropped out of the program, and switched over, My career has fol¬ lowed what feels like a very natural pro¬ gression. Even though I never knew where I would end up, I took one step at a time, and I’m really happy with where it’s tak¬ en me. It goes back to the summer after I finished high school and I worked for my friend’s mom, who owns this jewelry fac¬ tory. That’s were I first worked with these tools—like needle-nose pliers—and I loved it. I loved working with my hands. I worked so much that summer, just because I was so into it. By the end of the summer I was so sad to leave, I almost didn’t want to go to college because I loved it so much. By the time I got to school, I had an inkling that I really like this sort of work. It all came together in this funny way: I switched to this theater major, and then I found out that there was this store in Evanston where they made chain mail. I got a job there, and that’s how I learned to work in this me¬ dium. I got so into it, I asked them to pay me in little metal rings instead of money so I could start making chain mail on my own. I made this little chain mail vest for a school project, but I had no way of predict¬ ing that it was going to shape what I would do later in life. }[ After I graduated, I was more interested in fashion, and so I as¬ sisted different people in the business—a couple clothing designers, a hat maker, a 28 PUNK PLANET pattern maker, a shoe maker, a fiber artist . . . For a while, I didn’t know what I want¬ ed to do. I was working for all these dif¬ ferent designers, and I was learning a lot, but I couldn’t envision what my own work would look like. Then one day I ran into this guy I went to college with, and he was like, “What about your chain mail?’’ and it threw me a little. I was like, “That’s it! ” and I went out and bought these little rings and I started making all these different things. At the same time I was really into using all these non-traditional fabrics—materi¬ als not generally considered fabric, like Astroturf—to make wearable garments. It was as if a light turned on in my head. I got this idea to incorporate the everyday objects with the techniques I used to make chain mail to make a completely different kind of fabric. And then I had this oppor¬ tunity to put a few of my pieces in a fashion show. From there, someone told me about a gallery where they were putting together a wearable art exhibition, and the same thing happened after that exhibition. Op¬ portunities continue to pop up for me, and they fit into my interests, so I take them. When did you first begin to incorporate every¬ day objects like baby bottle nipples and tape measures into your work? Well, it all just sort of evolved for me. When I started out, I was working with ob¬ jects that are traditionally used to make chain mail. At that point it was more craft than art. In the end I had this fabric, but as an object it wasn’t associated with any particular meaning. So when I was starting to get back into making chain mail, I was working these garments out of Astroturf, At the time, there were these two guys who had graduated from the Art Institute who ran GoodLookin magazine, and they would have these satirical fashion shows—they would poke fun at snooty fashion shows and the fashion industry as a whole, but actually they were really amazing shows. They would have a theme, for example one show had a spy theme, and that’s when I used the Astroturf. I had these three women dressed in Astroturf suits walk¬ ing down the runway with the music from Charlie's Angels playing in the background, and they tossed these golf balls that were hidden in these secret pockets I had built into the suits. That summer they had a wa¬ ter-themed fashion show that took place in someone’s back yard and they had a Slip-n- Slide runway. For that show I made a dress out of these little glass vials filled with blue water. I wore the dress myself and I jump- roped down the Slip-n-Slide. Those shows had a huge impact on me: They pushed I GET REALLY WRAPPED UP IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE FOR ME IT’S ALL ABOUT EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL THAT’S IN ALL THESE EVERYDAY OBJECTS. MANY OF THE MATERIALS I USE ARE SO UNASSUMING BECAUSE THEY’RE SO FAMILIAR. I I Tassle (2005) a single length of zipper me to think more creatively about my own ideas about clothing and fashion, and they also allowed me to look more critically at the fashion world. When you’re using materials that seem un¬ wearable—or even potentially dangerous—do you think of the body that might wear them? Like with the dress made out of the glass vials, it makes sense that you would decide to wear that dress instead of hiring a model. That definitely poses a problem for the gar¬ ments I make. Early on I did a lot of fash¬ ion shows, and people would complain— es¬ pecially the models. They would say, “This is heavy, and the metal is cold. I can’t even sit down in it!” But it was like we were speak¬ ing two different languages. Obviously, I wasn’t trying to make a practical garment. I wasn’t interested in comfort, so I guess I wasn’t thinking of the body that would go inside the clothing, I just saw them stand¬ ing on their own. For me they were these huge geometric puzzles, so the mathemati¬ cal challenge is really what appealed to me. I remember trying to make my first sleeve; figuring out how to make the sleeve fit into the shoulder was just so fascinating to me. You just play around with it until it all comes together. I get really wrapped up in the process because for me it’s all about exploring the potential that’s in all these everyday objects. Many of the materials I use are so unassuming because they’re so familiar—take the zipper for example. You can sketch it all out and have it all planned so perfectly in your head and on paper, but then you start working and find out that zippers in the real world have certain limitations that you didn’t expect and you have to change your original plan. Since I interned with a pattern maker, I expected that to happen. I had seen experienced artists go through that very same process. I always try to keep that in mind; I know from the start that the materials are going to surprise me and won’t necessarily con¬ form to the plan I outline, When I was teaching at the School of the Art Institute, and I always encouraged my students to do as many internships as they possibly could. You learn so much working one-on-one, it’s a totally different experience than you get when you’re doing schoolwork. Did you encourage internships because there’s so much more at stake when you’re working in a real-world environment? It’s an environment where the primary motivation isn’t to learn, it’s to make a living. Definitely. In fashion it really comes down to business sense. A lot of people fail because they come out of school and they want to start their own business right away. There’s so much that you don’t know at that point, and for me, it was really good to learn from someone older who had some real wisdom and experience. You’re much better off if you make mis¬ takes when there’s someone there who can show you how to do it better. You really learn from that, and then you don’t repeat those mistakes. You don’t have so much riding on mistakes. Exactly. That’s what turned me off on do¬ ing clothing design in a mass-produced way. I learned pretty quickly that there was nothing desirable for me in that field. I don’t want to send stuff off to a factory. At the same time, I have spoken with many women in this industry who are more busi¬ ness savvy, and they think it’s a shame to see all these talented designers who can’t make a living. They’re like, “I know you’re less interested in the business aspect and making fashion that appeals to mass audi¬ ence, but perhaps there are ways you can supplement your income so that this ca¬ reer is an economically viable option for you and you can support yourself as an art¬ ist.” I think that’s an interesting exercise. Working with chain mail poses some pretty fundamental challenges—it’s just not that wearable. So instead of garments, I’ve been making these functional art pieces. I’ve been working on this one piece—I can only describe it as a chain-mail flower ball. The piece is interesting as an art piece when it’s not being used, but then you pick it up and you realize, “Oh my gosh, it’s a purse, or it’s this interesting necklace or bracelet!” Making items like this allows me to work in small quantities. It’s important to me that the objects are personal and special. I don’t want to design something and send them off to a factory—that doesn’t appeal to me at all. I’ve seen the zipper dress you made in a cou¬ ple of different colors, but when I saw it in white, it looked like a wedding dress. Did you do that on commission? Yes, I’ve made a few zipper dresses on com¬ mission, and one as a wedding dress. At some point I thought the zipper dress could be commercially viable in mass produc¬ tion—it’s more comfortable than my oth¬ er designs—but that dress is really tricky. It has to fit snuggly, so it really has to be constructed for a particular body. It isn’t cut from a pattern; it’s a continuous spiral starting at the top. I showed it to this pat¬ ternmaker I used to work with, and I was trying to explain it to her, and she couldn’t understand it. The person wearing it has to be pretty close to my body size in order for it to work. J That dress is really good example of a functional art object. When you unzip it all the way, it lays down in WORKING WITH CHAIN MAIL POSES SOME PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES—IT'S JUST NOT THAT WEARABLE. SO INSTEAD OF GARMENTS, I’VE BEEN MAKING THESE FUNCTIONAL ART PIECES. 30 PUNK PLANET this perfect spiral, and it’s completely un¬ recognizable. When you see it unzipped, the last thing you would guess is that it's a dress. I call it “unDressed” and when it’s lit in this particular way on a pedestal, or hung on the wall, it changes the meaning completely. For a long time I showed my work on the dress forms, but I found that when I let go of that mold, I began to push my ideas forward, The zipper pieces I’ve been making lately aren’t even garments at all, they’re just a single zipper, but they make these wild shapes. I take the two halves of a zipper and join them until they make an object that is interesting to me. Have you had to turn someone away because a particular design isn’t right for them? It seems like that would be an awkward experience. Well, I think that the people who have commissioned me probably notice the dif¬ ference between working with me and go¬ ing to a boutique. I don’t gush over people; I’m not like “Oh my, that looks fabulousl ” I can’t do that. I can’t kiss ass like that. I re¬ ally don’t like going into a boutique where the salespeople—who are working on com¬ mission—do that. It’s so fake and artificial. That’s why I like being my own agent. I don’t go though a gallery or a middleman. I deal directly with a client through the entire process, so it’s a win-win situation. And I can offer them a fair price, ft It’s funny when I think about the advice peo¬ ple used to give me when I first started do¬ ing my work. They would say, “You know, Cat, you really have to pick: fashion or art. You can’t do both.” But I think I’ve done a pretty good job of straddling that line. I m doing both. It keeps my mind open to all sorts of possibilities, and I’ve never had to compromise my integrity. ® J acob Bannon is intense. As the front¬ man for Converge, his thin, tattoo- covered frame flails on stage as he screams his almost inhuman vocals. His art is just as startling as his stage presence. A graduate of the Art Institute of Boston, he creates all of the artwork for his band’s re¬ leases and is in charge of visuals for every al¬ bum released by his label, Deathwish, doing much of it himself, in his trademark heavily textured, unsettling, and kinetic style. Converged 2001 record, Jane Doe, proved just how powerful Bannon's imagery could be: The cover showed the upper torso and head of a woman staring down at the viewer, with Bannon’s spattered ink texture creating an in¬ creasingly dark gradient below her. Inside the record, more searing images of female faces mixed with lyrics that are only occasionally leg¬ ible. Dark and ominous, it matches the feel of Jane Doe perfectly. That’s just what Bannon intends. The mu¬ sic and the packaging are one complete unit, each essential to understanding the other. In this age of iTunes and CD burning, his focus on packaging seems almost passe. But that atten¬ tion to detail makes his work, whether albums or fine-art pieces, so arresting. By Kyle Ryan Tell me about the physical process of creat¬ ing your work. It really depends on the project. Some stuff that I’ve worked on has been purely digital; some stuff that I’ve worked on is built by hand and is then collaged using Photoshop. My more fine-art-oriented stuff is permanently built using a lot of handmade materials and stuff that I make with the specific piece in mind. Say, for example, I want a project to have a cer¬ tain sort of textural feel. I’ll spend a lot of time creating those textural elements. A lot of people ask me how I made the Jane Doe cover. I spent a great deal of time on that. I couldn’t actually find a face that I really liked for a silhouette, so I basi¬ cally scanned a whole lot of them and had a whole lot to look at, to study. Then I built it using a variety of textures that I made using ink and acrylics and things like that. Does your work start digitally or on paper? It sort of jumps between the two worlds. Say for example I’m trying to make some¬ thing digitally and I can’t. I’ll then spend a great deal of time working on that and trying to push it by hand as far as possible before I have to jump back into the digital world with it. Your art is almost always unsettling. Is that your artistic vocabulary, so to speak, or does that mostly come from the project it’s associ¬ ated with? There’s always sort of an underlying style that I have and a way that I like to approach things. I like all my stuff to have power. If you could equate visual work with horse¬ power, I want to soup them up as much as possible. Although I am a designer, and I do want to be as versatile as possible, I’ve been sort of pigeonholed into doing one specific kind of thing or at least variations on one thing all the time. People come to 32 PUNK PLANET me, and they go, “Hey, I want our record to look like a Converge record. I want our re¬ cord to look like record A, B, or C, and has that textural feel.” And I go, “I’m not going to replicate that for you, but I can create something using some of those elements that I happen to be good at and I know how to manipulate well. I can do that for you utilizing your own subject matter blah blah blah blah blah.” 51 Obviously in the punk-rock and hardcore community, it’s become a bit of a visual cliche because everyone wants to have a gritty-looking album that is kinetic in some way. But a lot of them are miss¬ ing the point, you know? They’re just sort of using it for a decorative purpose, and they’re not really capturing the kinetic and powerful energy and equality of typogra¬ phy or a specific visual. Why do you think you’re drawn to this textural, ominous imagery? I think it’s the community in a lot of ways. The community makes its own sort of aes¬ thetic, and being somebody who’s been ac¬ tively a part of the community for so long, you end up creating things that are of that aesthetic. People see stuff that is successful with that kind of approach with a textural feel or something that’s kind of dark and sort of somber, and they go, “That’s what I want.” Sometimes there’s a little bit of non-originality in there, and my job as a designer and as an artist is to sort of attach the substance to their work, inject a little bit into their project, [Laughs] I can’t re¬ member how many Jane Toe-influenced al¬ bums came out after that record was creat¬ ed visually. People started showing them to me on a regular basis. “Hey check this out! Doesn’t this look familiar?” It was flatter¬ ing, but it was a bit insulting because a lot of the people were artists. You go, “Hey I know your work. I know you can do some¬ thing that is as interesting as this and is as powerful as this. Don’t lift from me!” Seeing as how Jane Doe has been replicated so many times, have you ever wanted to rebel against that style? Definitely. For my own band, specifically, we did that with the last record [Fou Fail Me] . We wanted to be as minimal and as dark and as striking as possible. We didn’t want a record that was going to be visually intense like Jane was. Jane had a lot of energy behind it. It was abrasive, but it felt like a bit of a visual roll¬ ercoaster ride at times, whereas with You Fail Me, we wanted a record that would be stark and cold and barren and be the complete antithesis of what Jane was. That was a bit of visual rebellion, but it still serves the same purpose. It’s still iconographic; it’s still pow¬ erful. If anything, it’s more powerful. It tells the same kind of visual story that other Con¬ verge records do, but does it in a much more minimal manner. That was the intent with that album: to tie the visuals and the lyrical prose together along with the actual musical mood of the album. What did you have in mind with making You Fail Me fit the album’s title and content? The record is essentially about hope; it’s about healing wounds. If you unfold the CD version of the record, you’ll notice it works in a reverse storyboard, where the wounds actually bleed a sort of textural heart pattern slowly throughout the piece, and on the cover the wound is healed, es¬ sentially just scars at that point, and the record’s essentially about that; it’s about taking responsibility for actions and about emotional healing. It’s about growing up. It’s about living with misfortune and living with failure and trying to overcome that- facing those demons—and I think that vi¬ sually it’s a metaphor on that. I didn’t re¬ ally want it to be this really striking piece with a whole lot of imagery. I just really wanted to sort of hit it home with that and just concentrate on minimal imagery. I think it really worked. I really enjoyed that record. On Jane Doe , you made some of the lyrics in the album art illegible, but on You Fail Me the lyrics are readable. They’re completely straightforward and they read as one large story. That was completely intentional to go along with the theme of just a really unified, simple album. If any¬ thing, I wanted this album to be understood visually ... I didn’t want people just to go [shijts to a perky voice] “Oh it’s a really neat¬ looking record! I wish our record looked like that!” Fuck that. I wanted them to think and maybe take away some substance. Sadly, substance has been missing from this com¬ munity for so fucking long. I wanted people to hopefully read for once. 34 PUNK PLANET I can’t remember how many Jane Doe-influenced albums came out after that record was created visually. People started showing them to me on a regular basis. “Hey check this out! Doesn’t this look familiar? P U N K P L A N E T 35 r Consistent throughout your work is a very rich, very textured, splattered-paint theme. How do you arrive at that look? I build all my textures using India Ink and spray paint and things like that. They’re physical; they’re real. I always get e-mails from people saying, “Oh I’m trying to cre¬ ate a Photoshop brush that does what you do.” But it never works because it’s not cre¬ ated that way. You’ve said before that the artwork for the record is every bit as important as the music, which isn’t a typical perspective. For a lot of bands, it’s an afterthought. You have so much freedom. You have mu¬ sical freedom, you have lyrical freedom, you have visual freedom. To take those three independent art forms and uniquely package and present them in refined way is one of the most powerful things that can exist in my opinion. It’s one of the most powerful art forms ever. A painting can’t play music, you know? Do you see a difference between graphic de¬ sign and fine art? When you create something in the fine- art world, it is what it is, and it’s either as emotionally complex or as emotionally barren as you say it is. No one can argue with you because you’re the one who es¬ sentially created it and that’s it. So if you say that this big white square on a black canvas is about “the oppression of some sort of third world country and their eco¬ nomic status” or “this is about the gentri- fication of city a, b or c,” no one can ar¬ gue with you. They can say it’s not exactly successful, but you can say it is. With design work, there’s a variety of visual issues that need to be resolved and vi¬ sual problems that need to be solved and answered. For example, in the graphic- design world, you have many things to overcome. You have to appeal to people on an emotional scale and on an intellec¬ tual scale. You need to answer a variety of visual questions. If the album has a spe¬ cific title, and the band wants your art¬ work—and this is talking from my world, by the way, not the general world—then they want the artwork to convey a cer¬ tain emotion. Well, I need to convey that emotion through the use of color and imagery with typography. I need to create something that is what they want. How do your fine art projects differ from your design ones? With fine art, you’re expressing yourself and yourself alone. You have a specific emotion or specific subject matter that you want to visually get out there. That’s where you immerse yourself, and that’s what you’re creating versus trying to just package somebody else’s creation. It’s a very differ¬ ent place. But the majority of your work nowadays seems to be album art. I’ve been sort of stuck for about two years just doing records. I didn’t want to ever become that giry and be the guy who’s just known for just doing that. I really don’t want to always create album covers. Late¬ ly I’ve been trying to just concentrate on doing more fine art-oriented stuff that revolves around my life and my work. Although the design world, the fine-art world, and the Converge world are some¬ what related because they all utilize some of the same technical abilities, there’s a very different emotional place where they all come from. At this point, I really feel like there’s been an absence in my life of doing work that is emotionally satisfying for me. Very few records that I work on that are non-Converge records have ever been emotionally satisfying. I really have a very large expectation of the work that I create for other people, but it’s not the same thing, you know? You’re not creating it because you want to express something emotionally that is within you. You’re try¬ ing to capture someone else’s vision; you’re trying to really refine their package, and it’s not really your process that you’re go¬ ing through. Some records have been emo¬ tional for me, primarily all the Ameri¬ can Nightmare work and the Give Up The. Ghost work—all of that has quite a large amount of emotion attached to it that we at least hoped to convey, and I think that shined through in all of those projects we did together. There’s similar projects here and there, but for the most part the other ones are visual jobs; they’re me solving a visual problem in a unique style—nothing more, really. ® artwork by Christa Donner from her PP AP shirt design PP AP Christa Donner june july Paul Hornschemeier Leia Bell august September | oct nov Andy Mueller december january Nadine Nakanishi february march Jay Ryan april may PUNK PLANET ARTIST PRINT the new limited-edition T-shirt subscription series from Punk Planet. 6 T-shirts. 6 artists. 12 months. subscribe for $100. individual shirts sold only in their release months for $25. only at wwww.punkplanet.com . tara mcpherson T ara McPherson’s artwork haunts you like an odd dream you can’t shake even hours after you’ve wo¬ ken up. Simultaneously beautiful and playful yet slightly sad and eerie, McPherson's rich lines and muted colors are unforgettable— even if you wanted to forget them. In McPher¬ son's world, heart-shaped holes are cut out of your chest, cartoon skulls grow out of rolling fields, and sad-eyed balloons hang dejectedly just out of reach. It's a world that feels both oddly familiar and reassuringly mysterious all at the same time. McPherson has been exploring her off- kilter images since graduating from art school three years ago. In that short time, she's made a name for herself in not just one highly-competi- tive field but three. A successful fine art painter, rock-poster artist, and comic-book cover artist, McPherson is able to switch between these different worlds as smoothly as her lines flow onto a page. Which isn’t to say it's been easy for McPherson; it hasn’t. Her success is a testa¬ ment to her no-surrender work ethic and the fact that McPherson doesn't shy away from a challenge. When contacted by an editor for DC Comics’ Vertigo imprint with the offer of do¬ ing cover illustrations for titles like the Sand¬ man spinoff Thessaly: Witch for Hire and The Witching (notice a theme?), McPherson didn’t worry about the fact that she’d never under¬ taken a project like that—she jumped in with both feet. With her artwork catching on and her ca¬ reer taking off, McPherson is setting herself up for a new challenge, embarking on a cross-coun¬ try move that will transplant her from Portland, Oregon to New York City. It’s a move McPher¬ son says she's always dreamed of, and if this dream plays out like her artwork, it’ll be one she won’t forget. Interview by Daniel Sinker 38 PUNK PLANET When I was in art school, I saw so many students get a style immediately, but I felt lost because I didn’t force a style. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, I was scattered. But ly the time I knew what I wanted to do, I had built up my own visual vocabulary. Which came first for you, paintings or posters? Paintings. I’ve been interested in art my whole life. I went to an art magnet school, and I decided to go to art school for college. I started painting there. The posters came way later. I didn’t even think about doing rock posters until after I graduated. In col¬ lege, I wanted to be a gallery painter. So why did you make the leap into rock posters? I started doing them for my band—I was an artist and it seemed like it would make sense to make our flyers. The flyers started getting more involved as they went on and people started noticing them. The first venue I started doing posters for was the Knitting Factory in LA. Because I wanted to be a painter, I was totally in denial of my posters at first. I wasn’t embarrassed of them, but they were just something I did on the side. I didn’t put them on my website or anything. But I did post them on Gigposters.com and I got a lot of great feedback out of that. It dawned on me that this was a really great thing to be doing, and that it was OK to do both. I put posters up on my website and pretty much imme¬ diately, the posters got more hits than my paintings did! Now I love doing both. How do you balance the two? I usually just go back and forth. I’m not the type of artist that can work on five things at once—I start a piece and I go un¬ til it’s done and then I move on to some¬ thing else. I’ll work on a poster and when it’s finished I’ll have a painting job I need to do or a gallery show I need to make work for. It’s balanced out for me mentally be¬ cause when I get sick of one thing, I can switch to another. That keeps me com¬ pletely interested. But right now I’m in be¬ tween comic-book covers, so I’ve booked a whole bunch of poster jobs. Right now I’m doing poster after poster. Do you ever start a poster, get halfway through it, and think that it would have made a better painting? Or vice-versa? It’s happened a few times where I’ll use the original drawing from a painting and make it into a poster. There’s a Blonde Redhead poster that was a painting first and there’s a PJ Harvey poster I did that was also a painting first. I really liked the images and the painting sold, so I felt like I should use it again so the image could be out there. I’ve also done posters that I think would make really cool paintings. But at least lately, once I’ve made an im¬ age for a poster, I feel like I should let it live its own life in the poster and maybe I shouldn’t use it as a painting. It’s interesting thinking about the audience for your work, because you work in three mediums that are very distinct: the gallery world, the poster world, and the comic-book world. I’ve been doing a lot more comics conven¬ tions recently, I go to Flatstock, which is the poster convention, and then I go to gallery shows and it’s all different, but they’re similar in a lot of ways too. How did you end up doing the comics stuff? I was interviewed in International Tattoo Art magazine and one of the editors from Ver¬ tigo comics read it and e-mailed me. She said “Oh, I hope to find you something re¬ ally soon.” I figured it was going to be six months or a year down the road, but she e- mailed back a few days later and had some¬ thing for me! It was perfect because I always wanted to work in comics but never actively pursued it. I’ve always read comics—I don’t go for the superheroes so much—and it was a really great transition to move into. It was also great to be sought out. It’s funny because the comics work you’ve done compliments your style so well. Yeah, it’s kind of perfect, huh? [Laughs.] It’s a real collaboration working with my writ¬ ers and my editor. There is a really consistent base of images and tone to your work, no matter what medium it’s in. It’s rare that you see a piece that feels like it doesn’t fit in with your other work. What is it about this type of imagery that is so appeal¬ ing to you? When I was in art school, I saw so many students get a style immediately, but I felt lost because I didn’t force a style. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, I was scattered. But by the time I knew what I wanted to do, I had built up my own visual vocabulary. Now I don’t even have to think about it; if I have to illustrate something, it just pops in my head how it should look. Now it hap¬ pens naturally; it’s second nature. Your imagery walks a fine line between being cute and creepy. How do you maintain that balance? I want it to be subtly unnerving. Even if it’s cute and innocent and sweet, I want it to be just a little unsettling. Why? I think life is that way. It’s a reflection on the complexities of the situations life puts you in. One thing I think is unique about your poster work specifically—though I think it corre¬ sponds to your comics work too—is that your depictions of women are so different than the work of your poster-making peers. Your stuff is a far cry from the big-tittied devil girls of Coop, for instance. Are you making a conscious effort to create a different por¬ trayal of femininity in what is a very mascu¬ line scene? 40 P U N K P L A N E T Sometimes, like if I’m at Flatstock, I’ll think, Whoa, there are only two women in this whole convention, but it’s not like I think about it all the time. I don’t sit around thinking, “I’m the only female poster artist on the West Coast.” Yes, it is a fact, but I try not to break it down like that. I just did a Blues Explosion poster that had more of a pinup style look to it—it’s kinda cheesecake—but in my mind, I was think¬ ing that the look she’s giving is very strong and confident. I want women and men to identify with the female character, so keeping in mind that I come from sort of a feminist background. I try to convey that with female characters. There are so few women postermakers. Do you wonder why? There really aren’t many. Sometimes, like if I’m at Flatstock, I’ll think, Whoa, there are only two women in this whole convention, but it’s not like I think about it all the time. I don’t sit around thinking, “I’m the only female poster artist on the West Coast.” Yes, it is a fact, but I try not to break it down like that. You’ve chosen to work in both the poster and comics worlds, which are both dominated by men. Even gallery painting is very male domi¬ nated. There are more female painters percentage-wise than compared to poster artists or comic artists, but still. Your work has such a feminine quality to it that I’m almost surprised that you’re held in such high regard in these worlds. You don’t try to step up and “out macho” the dudes’ stuff. Instead, you’ve staked out your terrain and let your work speak for itself—and you’ve been very successful at it. It’s crazy. I didn’t expect all of this when I decided to become an artist. I feel very fortunate. How long have you been out of art school? Three years now. When were you able to rely on your art to make a living? It took about a year after graduating. I as¬ sisted a painter after I graduated, then I had this funny job retouching photos for a headshot company for about five months—I got really good with Photoshop. [Laughs.] I hated that job. It was one of those kind of jobs that if you came in three minutes late they’d give you the stink eye. I quit out of sheer desperation. I was already starting to get more freelance jobs, and that was the last regular job I had. Did that feel like jumping off the plank into shark-infested waters? It totally did. It was very scary. I’d call up other artist friends of mine who were more successful and ask them, Oh rrygod, what did I do? It was hard work, but I worked a lot, and it started happening. At this point, are you working steadily enough that you don’t have to worry about where the next job is coming from? Yeah, I’m booked up for quite a while— but it’s always scary. I’m moving to New York in two months, and that’s scary, but between my regular jobs, freelance stuff, and commissions for paintings, I’m actu¬ ally booked up for six months right now. It’s a weird feeling to have all this stuff planned out so far ahead, and it’s still nerve-wracking, ’cause I worry if it’ll still be like this next year or five years from now. Why are you moving to New York? You’ve al¬ ready made one move from LA to Portland. I really wanted to leave LA—I grew up there and I was sick of it. My sister lives in Port¬ land and so I moved up here. I’ve been here for a year now, and it just isn’t my type of town. It’s a little too slow and the art scene is really tiny—it’s a really good music town though, I’ll give it that. I’ve always wanted to live in New York at some point in my life, and it’s kind of a perfect time : work is going good and I’m still young and single; I figure what better time than now to just do it—so I am! If you had to choose just one of the three worlds you’re working in to do forever which would you choose? Gallery painting, absolutely. Why is that? Maybe because it was my original dream going into college—or at least what I dis¬ covered once I was there. I really love painting. When I think of art, I think of painting. Part of painting is the drawing part of it and the thinking and the writing and the working out of ideas and themes and concepts. I would love to be able to hang out and paint and show in galleries for the rest of my life. Wanting to do paintings that will show in gal¬ leries is pretty much why everyone wants to go to art school, but not everyone three years after graduating is showing in galleries and getting commissions and living off their art. What do you think it is about your work that connected so quickly? I have no idea! [Laughs.] That’s the part where I fe"
