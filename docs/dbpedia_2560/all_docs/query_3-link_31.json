        "text": "Way back in 2015 — when “Uptown Funk!” was the hottest hit of the year, Sam Smith was named best new artist at the Grammy Awards and Taylor Swift had the year’s top album with the original version of 1989 — the global music industry hit a significant milestone.\n\nIts revenue grew — for the first time in 20 years. That was the beginning of a comeback, and the industry has sustained it since.\n\nIn March, when IFPI released its annual Global Music Report with worldwide results for the recorded-music business for 2023, it reported revenue had grown for a ninth consecutive year, reaching $28.6 billion worldwide.\n\nMusic streaming, of course, has driven that growth, and the IFPI report contained even more good news, stating that paid subscriptions to music streaming services hit a new high of more than 667 million users.\n\nAmong those who have contributed to the music business’ overall growth are Billboard’s 2024 International Power Players — executives nominated by their firms and peers and chosen by our editors from selected industry sectors. All have primary responsibility for markets outside the United States, which account for nearly 60% of the world’s recorded-music sales.\n\nIn fact, although the United States and Canada had a collective global recorded-music revenue increase of 7.4% in 2023, that was the lowest regional growth rate measured last year by IFPI. That figure was surpassed by Europe at 8.9%, Australasia at 10.4%, the Middle East and North Africa at 14.4%, Asia at 14.9%, Latin America at 19.4% and Sub-Saharan Africa at 24.7% (South Africa accounts for 77% of revenue in that region).\n\nEach of those regions is represented among this year’s International Power Players.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the global results, IFPI CFO/interim joint head John Nolan said, “This growth results from record companies’ sustained investment in artists and their careers — more than $7.1 billion annually on A&R and marketing alone [as measured in 2022] — and the impact it has on music ecosystems all over the world.”\n\nYet the global music business faces no shortage of tests as it aims for a solid decade of growth.\n\n“The sustained growth of the recorded-music market is encouraging,” IFPI chief legal officer/interim joint head Lauri Rechardt says, “but it’s also right for us to acknowledge the challenges the industry faces, including streaming fraud, digital piracy in all its forms and, of course, the threat from the abuse of generative artificial intelligence [AI] if it is not developed responsibly and with respect for artists’ and labels’ rights.\n\n“Music fans greatly value authenticity, and our industry has a strong track record of licensing music and supporting the development of new services that create these experiences for fans,” Rechardt continues. “That said, we still need effective tools and the support of authorities to tackle unauthorized uses and to ensure the music ecosystem remains one that is sustainable for the long term.”\n\nRebecca Berman\n\nSenior vp of international, Concord Label Group\n\nFred Gillham\n\nManaging director of U.K. and Europe, Concord Label Group\n\nJeff Van Driel\n\nGM of international operations, Concord\n\nConcord has invested in its global team with key hires and partnerships. “Adding A&R in the U.K., capacity in Latin America and Asia, and launching our European commercial team has allowed us to take further control of campaigns for our labels and artists,” says Berman, who notes the global success of Ghost and Thirty Seconds to Mars as proof that the strategy is working. Van Driel adds that Concord’s administrative teams in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia have reorganized to accommodate local needs while centralizing shared functions at Concord’s Nashville headquarters. “We have introduced numerous tech solutions that integrate regional processes into our global system,” he says.\n\nThomas Coesfeld\n\nCEO, BMG\n\nSebastian Hentzschel\n\nCOO, BMG\n\nCoesfeld, who took over BMG’s top role in July, wasted no time making major changes at the fourth-largest global music company, including bringing its streaming distribution in-house and partnering with Universal Music Group to handle distribution of BMG’s physical products. “Striking direct distribution agreements with Spotify and Apple unleashes a new level of service,” he says. “We now have direct access to data that can really move the dial for artists and songwriters and a unique position in the market.” Coesfeld adds that the changes give BMG “a laser focus on our core businesses of publishing and recordings.”\n\nAdam Granite\n\nCEO of Africa, Middle East and Asia, Universal Music Group\n\nDickon Stainer\n\nPresident/CEO of global classics and jazz and Verve Label Group, Universal Music Group\n\nMichelle Teh\n\nSenior vp of global classics and jazz, Universal Music Group\n\nGranite says that “over the past 12 months, UMG has continued to strengthen and expand our operations, repertoire and leadership teams around the world.” UMG invested in Mavin Records in Nigeria, Oriental Star Agencies in South Asia, Chabaka Music in the Middle East/North Africa and RS Group in Thailand. In addition, the company reached new deals with Chinese stars Jay Chou and Eason Chan. Granite says there are “huge opportunities for global music to find popularity through streaming and discovery.”\n\nDonny Novakovic\n\nVp of international marketing, Disney Music Group\n\n“I am proud of the achievements my team and I have had curating the soundtracks of the world, breathing life into the deep catalog and unearthing hidden gems in multiple languages,” Novakovic says. Disney continues to build “a bridge between cultures,” he adds, noting the impact of titles such as Frozen, Frozen II and Moana. “With their upcoming sequels, we’ll continue building on these cherished stories’ legacy,” Novakovic says. And Encanto has sold 8 million copies of its soundtrack, according to Disney, “proving the world is still talking about Bruno.”\n\nJiwon Park\n\nCEO, HYBE\n\nYJ Shin\n\nPresident, BIGHIT Music\n\nSung Soo Han\n\nMaster professional, PLEDIS Entertainment\n\nYoo Jin Oh\n\nGM, HYBE 360\n\nHYBE’s diversification — including its acquisitions of Quality Control and Exile Music — helped it become the first South Korean entertainment company to surpass 2 billion won ($1.5 billion) in revenue, based on its 2023 results. But many of the company’s highlights still came from its bread-and-butter K-pop artists. Jung Kook topped the Billboard Hot 100 with “Seven” (featuring Latto), and Jimin’s “Like Crazy” also hit No. 1 on the chart. Seventeen’s 10th EP, FML, became the best-selling K-pop album in history with global sales of 6.3 million, according to HYBE. Post-pandemic tours by BTS, Tomorrow X Together, Le Sserafim, ENHYPEN and others attracted 1.2 million concertgoers to 90 performances, according to HYBE.\n\nMelissa Thomas\n\nExecutive vp of international marketing for U.S. repertoire, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nTalita Zuiderveld\n\nHead of global promotions for U.S. international, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nChanel Auguste\n\nDirector of international marketing, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nKaitlin Reid\n\nAssociate director of digital and commercial strategy, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nKatherine Griffith\n\nAssociate director of international marketing, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nIn an increasingly global music industry, “hits and stories can spark from anywhere around the world,” Thomas says. Viral popularity in Southeast Asia, among other markets, helped push SZA’s “Kill Bill” to No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 and Meghan Trainor’s “Made You Look” to No. 11 on the Hot 100, while 22-year-old Tyla emerged from South Africa to reach No. 1 on Billboard’s Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. Meanwhile, Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” was IFPI’s top-selling global single in 2023. “We are highly focused,” Thomas says, “on building campaigns that captivate and engage fans from every corner of the globe.”\n\nPieter van Rijn\n\nPresident of Downtown Music, Downtown Music Holdings\n\nBen Patterson\n\nPresident of artist and label services, Downtown Music Holdings\n\nChristiaan Kröner\n\nPresident of FUGA, Downtown Music Holdings\n\nChristine Barnum\n\nChief revenue officer, CD Baby/Downtown Music Holdings\n\nAcross its many divisions, Downtown flexed its “full strength” in 2023, van Rijn says. In the last year, Downtown purchased royalty processing company Curve Royalty Systems, combined Adrev and FUGA to help bolster monetization for user-generated content and established new partnerships with BandLab and Spirit Music Group. “Powering creativity for rights holders has been at the core of Downtown’s mission since its inception,” van Rijn says. “We are proud to have continued the expansion of our businesses globally across the group.”\n\nEric Wong\n\nPresident/chief marketing officer of recorded music, Warner Music Group\n\nSimon Robson\n\nPresident of international recorded music, Warner Music Group\n\nJess Keeley-Carter\n\nExecutive vp of global marketing, Warner Music International\n\nAmong Warner Music’s international stars, an Udo Lindenberg track topped the German chart for 21 weeks, Bolaget ruled Sweden’s chart for 14 weeks and Gobs held down the No. 1 spot in Denmark for 10 weeks. Robson says the company is eager to use collaborations as a tool to cross international borders, and has helped pair Ninho with Central Cee, Ed Sheeran with 1.Cuz — and Warner Music Canada with Warner Music India on the joint venture 91 North Records. Another collaboration, Karol G and Aldo Ranks’ “WATATI,” peaked at No. 2 in Panama and No. 4 in Honduras on Monitor Latino thanks to Wong’s team, which was instrumental in pushing Barbie: The Album — on which “WATATI” appears alongside songs from Dua Lipa and ­Charli XCX — around the globe.\n\nFrank Briegmann\n\nChairman/CEO, Universal Music Central Europe and Deutsche Grammophon, Universal Music Group\n\nOliver Nusse\n\nCEO, Universal France and Universal Music Africa, Universal Music Group\n\nFrank Kacou\n\nManaging director, Universal Music Africa, Universal Music Group\n\nIn September, Briegmann opened the Universal Inside showcase in Berlin, which he declared was “dedicated to hip-hop” in honor of the genre’s 50th anniversary, and unveiled Universal’s YOUniverse, an interactive platform developed by Universal Music Central Europe. Nusse says, “We are very proud to be pioneers in France” in UMG’s partnership with French digital music service Deezer in launching an artist-centric streaming model, which aims to reward artists and songs that are driving listener engagement. Ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations finals in January, Kacou oversaw the release of an EP showcasing several African artists including Yemi Alade, Magic System, Didi B, Roselyne, Layo, Serge Beynaud, Kerozen, CYsoul, Vegedream, Ayanne, Kaaris and Josey.\n\nFabian Drebes\n\nDoreen Schimk\n\nCo-presidents, Warner Music Central Europe\n\nMark Fry\n\nPresident, Warner Music Nordics\n\nAlfonso Perez-Soto\n\nPresident, emerging markets, Warner Music Group\n\nAlain Veille\n\nPresident, Warner Music France\n\nNiels Walboomers\n\nPresident, recorded music and publishing, Benelux, Warner Music Group\n\nTemi Adeniji\n\nManaging director, Warner Music Africa\n\nWarner Music Central Europe, under Drebes and Schimk, in partnership with Warner Chappell Music Germany, under vp Natascha Augustin, led WMG colleagues in celebrating the September opening of a creative hub in Berlin to bring together international artists, songwriters and producers while also serving its employees. The facility, built on the top floor of the historic Schicklerhaus in the central Berlin borough of Mitte, boasts an interior performance space, rooftop terraces and collaboration rooms featuring cutting-edge technology such as Dolby Atmos immersive sound. WMG CEO Robert Kyncl led a guest list of more than 700 attendees at the grand opening, including WMG artists and songwriters and figures from music, entertainment and politics.\n\nTony Harlow\n\nCEO, Warner Music U.K.\n\nVictor Aroldross\n\nSenior vp of international marketing, Warner Music U.K.\n\n“Before superstar status comes artist development, and, as always, it remains at the very heart of our function,” says Aroldross, who works with Warner Music U.K.’s roster, including Coldplay, Dua Lipa, Ed Sheeran, Fred again.. and PinkPantheress. Under Harlow, who oversees front-line British labels Atlantic, Parlophone, Rhino and Warner Records, as well as ADA U.K., the company achieved breakthroughs with Griff and Maisie Peters, while Sheeran celebrated multiple successes in 2023. His sixth and seventh albums, – (Subtract) and Autumn Variations, both topped the U.K. Official Albums chart and debuted in the top five of the Billboard 200.\n\nJason Iley\n\nChairman/CEO, Sony Music U.K. and Ireland\n\nSony Music-signed or -affiliated artists topped the U.K. Official Singles chart for a combined 28 weeks in 2023, including Miley Cyrus’ 10 weeks at No. 1 with “Flowers” — the top song in the United Kingdom last year with 198 million streams, according to the Official Charts Company. Hit records by SZA, Doja Cat, Libianca, Tyla, Tate McRae, Cassö and Calvin Harris (in collaboration with Ellie Goulding) rounded out a successful 12 months for Sony Music, which relaunched Epic Records U.K. as a front-line label last May. “After reorganizing our labels, we’re proud of our recent chart success,” says Iley, who celebrated 10 years at the helm in April.\n\nDavid Joseph\n\nChairman/CEO, Universal Music U.K. & Ireland\n\nSelina Webb\n\nExecutive vp, Universal Music U.K.\n\nJoseph singles out “two truly global moments” as highlights of the past 18 months. The first was the release of Hackney Diamonds, The Rolling Stones’ first album of original material in 18 years, which topped the charts in 20 countries, according to UMG. The second was The Beatles’ final song, “Now and Then,” which reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom and No. 7 on the Hot 100. “I genuinely think both campaigns will be looked at for many years as best-in-class examples of U.K. creativity exporting to the world,” says Joseph, who oversees the EMI, Decca, Island, Polydor and 0207 Def Jam labels, as well as Abbey Road Studios.\n\nDaniel Lieberberg\n\nPresident of Sony Music Continental Europe and Africa, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nPatrick Mushatsi-Kareba\n\nCEO of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nMarie-Anne Robert\n\nPresident, Sony Music France\n\nBelgian producer Lost Frequencies, Germany’s Purple Disco Machine and 2021 Eurovision winner Måneskin from Italy are among the acts that brought success last year for Sony Music Continental Europe under Lieberberg, who also guided the company’s growth in Africa. Mushatsi-Kareba has advocated for diversity and, in partnership with the nonprofit artist association Music Women* Germany, helped create the Female* Producer Prize to support and promote the careers of rising female-identifying producers across Germany. Robert participated in the March launch of IFPI’s 2024 Global Music Report and spoke of artists switching “from distribution to artist contracts” so labels could oversee their legal and marketing needs.\n\nAlistair Norbury\n\nPresident of U.K. repertoire and marketing, BMG\n\nKylie Minogue, Billboard’s 2024 Women in Music Icon honoree, drove fans to dancefloors around the world with the global success of “Padam Padam,” which was her biggest U.S. hit in 20 years and won the Grammy Award for best pop dance recording in February. The song propelled the album Tension to No. 21 on the Billboard 200, her best showing since 2010. “Together with the accolades from the Grammys and Billboard awards, plus the triumph of [her] Las Vegas [residency],” Norbury says, “Kylie’s success shows how BMG’s global focus can help artists deliver creatively, critically and commercially.”\n\nAlejandro Duque\n\nPresident, Warner Music Latin America\n\nLeila Oliveira\n\nPresident, Warner Music Brazil\n\nTomas Rodríguez\n\nPresident of Warner Music Mexico & Central America, Warner Music Mexico\n\nGuillermo González Arévalo\n\nPresident, Warner Music Iberia\n\nWarner Music Latin America’s “domestic strategy in each market, partnered with our regional infrastructure and Warner Music’s global marketing teams,” led the company to continue growing its market share in 2023, Duque says. It achieved “record-breaking” results with its multigenre, multicountry roster, he adds. Hits included “Lala” by Puerto Rico’s Myke Towers and “La Bebe” by Mexico’s Yng Lvcas. The former topped the Billboard Global 200 Excl. U.S. chart and earned Towers a No. 1 on the Latin Airplay chart. Elsewhere, domestic hits included “Los del Espacio” by Lit Killah, Maria Becerra and Tiago PZK in Argentina; Blessd’s Si Sabe album release in Colombia; and Quevedo’s success in his native Spain and globally, which earned him his first top 10 on a Billboard albums chart.\n\nJesús López\n\nChairman/CEO, Universal Music Latin America/Iberian Peninsula\n\nNarcís Rebollo Melció\n\nPresident, Universal Music Iberian Peninsula\n\nAlfredo Delgadillo\n\nPresident/CEO, Universal Music Mexico\n\nLuis Estrada\n\nPresident, Universal Music Southern Cone\n\nPaulo Lima\n\nPresident, Universal Music Brazil\n\nManuel Peña\n\nManaging director, Universal Music Andean Region & Central America\n\nUniversal’s ability to break local artists at an international level was on display again with the “remarkable international success of Feid,” López says. Feid ended the year as the sixth most-streamed artist globally on Spotify and debuted at No. 1 on the platform’s global chart with his albums Mor, No le Temas a la Oscuridad and Ferxxocalipsis. He was also a top five artist of the year on Vevo, in the top 10 of Billboard’s U.S. year-end Latin artists and sold out his 2023 Ferxxo Nitro Jam Underground U.S. tour in 30 minutes, according to the label. The Colombian star also played sold-out shows in Germany, Switzerland, Italy and France, underscoring his growing international appeal.

In Mexico, López highlights the international success of Natalia Lafourcade — signed 24 years ago — who hit a high with two Latin Grammys and one Grammy for her 2022 album, De Todas las Flores. In Brazil, DENNIS and Kevin o Chris’ “Tá Ok” was a No. 1 hit, while Luísa Sonza is poised for an international breakthrough. In Argentina, Amato applauds the success of pop band Miranda! throughout South America with its album Hotel Miranda. In Spain, Barbat says he remains focused on developing new talent like Ana Mena, while being “attentive to signing consolidated artists with high international and mainstream relevance” like Alejandro Sanz.

In addition, IVE, a girl group on Kakao’s label Starship Entertainment, is on its first global tour, which included six U.S. arena dates in March.\n\nChris Gobalakrishna\n\nJonathan Serbin\n\nCo-presidents, Warner Music Asia\n\nDan Rosen\n\nPresident, Warner Music Australasia\n\nJay Mehta\n\nManaging director, Warner Music South Asia and Warner Music India\n\nUnder Gobalakrishna and Serbin, Warner Music China last year signed Elva Hsiao, one of Greater China’s most successful artists.

In March, Rosen welcomed Behani, an artist with Persian and Italian roots from Melbourne, Australia, to Warner Music Australia and ADA. She broke through in 2023 with “Real Man” (featuring Ne-Yo), which reached No. 2 on Australia’s Shazam chart, according to Warner Music. Under Mehta, Warner Music South Asia will further promote repertoire from Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the home to over 400 million people. Mehta remains in his role leading Warner Music India.\n\nMatt Gudinski\n\nChairman/CEO, Mushroom Group\n\nWith Gudinski at the helm, the Melbourne, Australia-based independent music giant celebrated its 50th anniversary with a yearlong slate of special events, releases, merchandise and an all-star concert at Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena in November featuring scores of Mushroom acts performing originals and classic songs from across the company’s catalog. The business built by Gudinski’s late father, legendary entrepreneur Michael Gudinski, “saw success across our entire group,” Matt says. The standout: the second of Ed Sheeran’s record-setting performances at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with 112,000 in attendance.\n\nKatsumi Kuroiwa\n\nCEO, Avex\n\nThe multifaceted Japanese music company Avex — through a partnership with AEG Presents branded as AEGX — hosted Ed Sheeran’s +-=÷x Tour in Japan in January, as well as Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour at the Tokyo Dome in February, a run that marked the first time a non-Japanese female artist performed at the venue for four consecutive days. Avex’s U.S. imprint, Avex USA, has grown its publishing roster with recent signings including an administration deal with producer Ambezza (Future and Drake’s “Life Is Good”) and a co-publishing deal with GENT! (Doja Cat’s “Agora Hills”) in collaboration with Brandon Silverstein’s S10 Entertainment.\n\nCussion Pang\n\nChairman, Tencent Music Entertainment Group\n\nRoss Liang\n\nCEO/board member, Tencent Music Entertainment Group\n\nTencent Music Entertainment, China’s largest music streaming company, is in a state of flux. Last year, revenue from social entertainment and other services declined 34% to $1.5 billion. Music streaming, however, is booming. Subscription revenue from apps QQ Music, Kugou Music and Kuwo Music rose 39.1% to $1.7 billion, and the number of paying customers rose 20.6% to 106.7 million. As the product improved — long-form audio, livestreaming and exclusive release windows — the free-to-paid conversion rate climbed from 18% in 2022 to 24% in 2023.\n\nTimothy Xu\n\nChairman/CEO, Universal Music Greater China\n\nCalvin Wong\n\nCEO, Universal Music Southeast Asia; senior vp of Asia, Universal Music Group\n\nDevraj Sanyal\n\nChairman/CEO, Universal Music India and South Asia; senior vp of strategy, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, Universal Music Group\n\nPatrick Boulos\n\nCEO, Universal Music Middle East and North Africa\n\nNaoshi Fujikura\n\nPresident/CEO, Universal Music Japan\n\nSean Warner\n\nPresident, Universal Music Australia and New Zealand\n\nIn September, Universal Music Group named Xu to oversee Greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the veteran executive has since signed a global distribution deal with Jay Chou, the first artist from China to appear in the top 10 of IFPI’s global artist chart. In Southeast Asia, under Wong, UMG acquired a majority control of Thailand’s RS Group, a leading music distributor and artist management group. For Universal Music India, Sanyal’s brand partnership with Coca-Cola led to the hit “Khalasi” by Aditya Gadhvi and Achint. Released through Coke Studio Bharat, the song has 5 billion cumulative video views, according to UMG.\n\nDan Chalmers\n\nDirector of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, YouTube Music\n\nSandra Jimenez\n\nHead of music for Latin America and U.S. Latin, YouTube Music\n\nPaul Smith\n\nManaging director, Asia Pacific, YouTube Music\n\nNur Ozdamar\n\nLead of Europe, the Middle East and Africa artist and label development, YouTube Music\n\nYouTube’s focus on fostering growth and innovation in areas such as short-form content and AI has resulted in success for the iconic brand. Both YouTube Premium and YouTube Music surpassed 100 million subscribers, while Shorts climbed to an average of over 70 billion daily views, with the number of channels uploading Shorts growing more than 50% year over year, according to the company. Additionally, YouTube’s Music AI Incubator — made in collaboration with a global slate of artists — and AI Principles proved to be formative steps in protecting artists and fostering creativity in a world where AI is increasingly prevalent.\n\nPhil Choi\n\nManaging director, Boomplay\n\nBoomplay is committed to bringing African music to the global stage and, last year, African superstar Burna Boy made history by becoming the first artist to reach 1 billion streams on the app, according to Boomplay. The launch of Boomlive, an audio livestreaming feature of the app, has bridged the gap between artists and their fans by providing a direct channel of live communication and giving artists an additional tool for promotion and the monetization of their brand. “It has been a long road,” Choi says, “but the success of African music on the global stage and domestically has further strengthened our commitment to developing the African music industry to reach a wider audience.”\n\nBruno Crolot\n\nHead of international music, Spotify\n\nAndy Sloan Vincent\n\nHead of global music programs, Spotify\n\nAnnika Walsh\n\nHead of international music strategy, Spotify\n\nWhile Crolot says that 2023 was “jam-packed for Spotify on all fronts,” he’s especially proud of the continued focus on “championing artists and musical genres from every corner of the world.” In February 2023, the company debuted its personalized AI guide — called DJ — in beta in the United States and Canada. It expanded into the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as select markets in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. “[Our] tools and programs can create magic,” Crolot says. “Somewhere, a fan will get to discover for the very first time an artist that will become a favorite and a lasting connection will be created, no matter the geographical and linguistic barriers.”\n\nPaul Firth\n\nDirector of global music industry, Amazon Music\n\nClaire Imoucha\n\nHead of Amazon Music, Spain\n\nKeisuke Oishi\n\nGM/director, Amazon Music, Japan\n\nImoucha cites Amazon Music’s ­livestream of the 2023 Primavera Sound Festival in Spain as a significant international achievement for the company. “Being able to delight music fans around the world and bring this world-class festival, packed with artist performances, interviews and behind-the-scenes moments, to them at home was a real highlight,” she says. Millions tuned in digitally to watch performances from the Barcelona event by headliners such as Blur and Kendrick Lamar on Amazon Music’s Twitch channel.\n\nGeorges Fornay\n\nDeputy CEO, Qobuz\n\nDan Mackta\n\nManaging director, North America and Northern Europe, Qobuz\n\nQobuz is “consistently outpacing market benchmarks” as the streaming service has expanded its global reach into 26 countries, Mackta says. The high-resolution streaming service has spread into the Canadian market (both French- and English-speaking territories) and recently partnered with Festival Bach Montreal and Off-Bach, the annual three-week classical music festival in Montreal. The move happened after recent launches in Northern Europe, Australia and New Zealand in 2021 and Latin America in 2022, as well as the acquisition of Japanese music company e-Onkyo. Qobuz also partnered with the Jerry Garcia Family, the artist’s estate, to bring the late Grateful Dead member’s full catalog and exclusive playlists to the service.\n\nMaria Garrido\n\nChief marketing officer, Deezer\n\nIn September, Deezer and Universal Music Group launched a plan to increase streaming royalty payments by roughly 10% for performers who meet a minimum number of monthly streams. The French streaming company, whose CEO Jeronimo Folgueira left in March, also rebranded itself with a new logo and a new identity as an “experiences platform” and has reached record-high subscription numbers, according to Garrido. “It was an exciting challenge to bring together the essence of the company’s DNA,” she says, “with a company purpose revolving around helping people belong through music.”\n\nEmmy Lovell\n\nGlobal head of music, SoundCloud\n\nAma Walton\n\nSenior vp of music licensing/deputy general counsel, SoundCloud\n\nHazel Savage\n\nVp of music intelligence, SoundCloud\n\nSoundCloud’s major achievement of 2023 was launching its artist development program, Ascending, which highlights emerging artists monthly. Ascending promoted talents like Kenya Grace, whose single “Strangers” has become a mainstay on users’ playlists since. “I feel like the industry is really taking note of the A&R gold mine that exists on SoundCloud to find and amplify new talent,” Lovell says, adding that the success of artists on SoundCloud motivates her to continue spotlighting emerging acts and connecting them to fans.\n\nCharles Morgan\n\nChief marketing officer, The Beatport Group\n\nThis year, Beatport is celebrating 20 years of serving the DJ community and expanding its international presence.

Since then, Apple has expanded its availability to those areas as well, “bringing the world’s largest classical catalog and ultimate classical experience to more music fans around the globe,” Walsh says. “Classical music is foundational for music lovers everywhere, and we are working with some of the most prolific classical artists and institutions in the world to celebrate and showcase the experience in this new stand-alone app.”\n\nRebecca Allen\n\nJo Charrington\n\nCo-presidents, EMI Records\n\nUnder the joint leadership of Allen and Charrington, EMI Records strengthened its position as one of the top U.K. imprints in 2023. Chart successes included No. 1 albums by Lewis Capaldi, Sam Smith, Take That, Metallica, Shania Twain and Taylor Swift, who had the year’s second- and third-biggest-selling albums in the United Kingdom with Midnights and 1989 (Taylor’s Version), respectively, according to the Official Charts Company. Caity Baser, Olivia Dean and Mae Stephens are among the recent breakthroughs for EMI, which integrated Capitol Records into the wider U.K. label group in 2022. Last year’s launch of EMI North, a new imprint based in Leeds, England, made EMI the first British major label to have a physical office outside of London.\n\nTricia Arnold\n\nExecutive vp of global artist/label services and sales, The Orchard\n\nPrashant Bahadur\n\nExecutive vp/head of strategy, The Orchard\n\nErol Cichowski\n\nJason Pascal\n\nExecutive vps of global artist and label partnerships, The Orchard\n\nThe Orchard marked “another record year” in 2023, Bahadur says, adding that clients “continue to break records and boundaries and lead the way in bringing local music to global audiences.” The distribution and artist services company worked with Double P/Parjin Parlay Records to release Peso Pluma’s Génesis, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 in July; the Mexican singer also landed at No. 12 on Billboard’s year-end Top Artists chart. “Additional successful releases from Bizarrap, Yoasobi, Jorja Smith, IVE, Nas, Riar Saab, DPR IAN and more,” Bahadur says, “continue to grow The Orchard’s profile as a global industry leader.”\n\nStacey Bedford\n\nCEO, Bandzoogle\n\nBandzoogle, the Ottawa, Ontario-based online platform that provides a one-stop shop for independent musicians to build professional websites, celebrated its 20th year in 2023. The site has expanded its options over the years, now offering musicians online press kits, direct marketing and merchandise sales, and expanded its global reach in the process. “One of our main goals is to help make it easier for musicians to make money from their music by selling directly to their fans,” Bedford says. “Seeing our members make over $16.4 million in sales through their websites last year, all commission-free, is truly rewarding for our whole team.”\n\nPascal Bittard\n\nPresident, IDOL\n\nFrench digital distributor IDOL has spent the past year “focused on developing its international divisions by making key signings and hires in the U.S., U.K. and Germany,” Bittard says. Among its moves to support that goal: bringing artists like Afro B and Erick the Architect to TOKiMONSTA’s Young Art Records. Meanwhile, IDOL has become more partner-friendly by dedicating an audience development manager to each client. IDOL also kept expanding its head office and international teams in 2024, with local operations spread across Paris, London, Berlin, New York, Los Angeles, Nashville and Johannesburg.\n\nLouis Bloom\n\nPresident, Island Records U.K.\n\nSteven Rowen\n\nSenior vp/head of international, Island Records\n\nIn December, when the finalists for the Rising Star Award at the 2024 BRIT Awards were announced, two of the three acts — The Last Dinner Party and Sekou — were signed to Island Records U.K. (EMI Records singer Caity Baser was the third), with the honor eventually going to The Last Dinner Party. In April 2023, three of Bloom’s signings — Marcus Mumford, Hozier and Dermot Kennedy — shared a Royal Albert Hall bill in London for a War Child benefit concert. In the United States, Rowen has guided the global rise of Sabrina Carpenter, including linking her with Filipino dance influencer Niana Guerrero in July to create a dance trend for Carpenter’s single “Feather.”\n\nAlec Boateng\n\nAlex Boateng\n\nCo-presidents, 0207 Def Jam\n\nMarisa Lauro-Norris\n\nFormer senior vp of international, Def Jam Recordings\n\nIn the United Kingdom, twin brothers Alec and Alex Boateng have built on the success of grime star Stormzy — most recently through a collaboration with Indo Canadian artist AP Dhillon on “Problems Over Peace.” In the United States, 18-year Def Jam Recordings veteran Lauro-Norris guided international campaigns in the past year for new 0207 Def Jam signing JayO as well as Def Jam U.S. acts like Grammy Award winner Coco Jones, Nigerian superstar Adekunle Gold and American rapper Armani White. (As of March, Lauro-Harris is no longer with Def Jam.)\n\nLilas Bourboulon\n\nTim Dellow\n\nToby L\n\nCompany directors/co-CEOs, Transgressive\n\nTransgressive’s Toby L says the company’s past year was defined by creative and commercial growth in three core areas: the label (with releases from Flume, Arlo Parks, Alvvays, Julia Jacklin, Mykki Blanco and The WAEVE), publishing (extension of a catalog agreement with Foals; new deals with Black Country, New Road and HotWax; and a top three album on the U.K. Official Albums chart from Loyle Carner) and management (Wesley Joseph’s signing to Secretly Canadian and new albums from Marika Hackman and musician-actor Johnny Flynn). “Next year marks 20 years of the company,” Toby L says, “and with new staff hires and a North American office opening on the horizon, there’s a lot to look forward to.”\n\nJorge Brea\n\nFounder/CEO, Symphonic Distribution\n\nJanette Berrios\n\nVp of corporate marketing, Symphonic Distribution\n\nBrea says his company has been expanding its global footprint across continents, from the Americas to Africa and Europe, while also making technological advancements through its in-house tech team. “Our proprietary platform, featuring enhancements like SplitShare, Recoupments and TransferTrack, compares to those of major labels,” he says. “Our financial performance reflects our team’s dedication and effective leadership, demonstrated by a 50% annual growth rate, $100 million in revenue and over $40 million in support from private equity firms.”\n\nKristen Burke\n\nPresident, Warner Music Canada\n\nThe only female head of a major label in Canada, Burke initiated Warner Music’s move from the Toronto suburbs to its downtown headquarters at The Well, where she has continued her forward-thinking strategy. Warner Music Canada partnered with Warner Music India to create 91 North Records, focused on artists of South Asian heritage. “This venture leverages the market potential of uniting two distinct fan bases, [building] a bridge between the East and West,” she says.,” she says. To further that mission, Warner Music Canada directly signed Karan Aujla, a Canadian artist born in India, who was nominated for two Juno Awards in March, and won the Tik Tok Fan Choice Award.\n\nCaitlin Cadden\n\nDirector of global marketing, Warner Music Nashville\n\nOne highlight of WMN’s global success has been singer-songwriter Bailey Zimmerman, whose Religiously.

But last year, Gallo won South African Music Awards for Afropop star Nathi Mankayi and adult contemporary singer Louise Carver. It also rolled out new albums from Grammy Award-winning act Ladysmith Black Mambazo and singer-songwriter Vusi Mahlasela, who is known as “The Voice of South Africa.” “The continent of Africa,” Cowling says, “is still showing off its unstoppable talent and signs of growth.”\n\nBrianne Deslippe\n\nSenior vp of global marketing and strategy, Big Loud Records\n\n“The past year has been a landmark one for our company,” Deslippe says of Nashville-based Big Loud Records, which expanded its business with offices and label managers in London and Brisbane, Australia, while bolstering its already established office in Toronto. The label also supported 17 of its artists on international festivals and tour dates.

The nomination for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Gustavo Dudamel’s Fandango in the best engineered album, classical category followed a strong investment in the classical market by the artist services company. “For me, it always comes down to the artists, their careers, passion and creativity,” Feigelson says. “Our job at Platoon is to help them realize their dreams.”\n\nKenny Gates\n\nCo-founder/CEO, [PIAS]\n\nMichel Lambot\n\nCo-founder, [PIAS]\n\nGates says [PIAS] hit its high note in March, “partnering with Nick Cave, one of our all-time musical heroes, and his management team to license his incredible new album, Wild God.” The 10-track set by Cave and his band The Bad Seeds will arrive Aug. 30 through Cave’s own Bad Seed label through an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with the [PIAS] imprint Play It Again Sam. “In my opinion, [it’s] his best ever, and we will go over the barricades to deliver the global success it deserves,” Gates told Billboard when the deal was announced.\n\nArchie Gormley\n\nHead of international, Big Machine Label Group\n\nLast year, Big Machine Label Group released Dolly Parton’s Rockstar, which debuted in the top 20 on Billboard’s Canadian Albums chart and the top five on the Official U.K. Albums chart. The set, with tracks that featured Steven Tyler, Sting, Ann Wilson, Stevie Nicks and more, also reached No. 1 on the Official Americana Albums chart and No. 3 on the Australian Recording Industry Association’s Top 40 Country Albums chart. “Our whole team felt immensely privileged to play a part in working the Dolly Parton album last year,” Gormley says, and was “proud to deliver her career-best week-one album chart positions internationally outside North America.”\n\nJurgen Grebner\n\nExecutive vp of international marketing, Interscope Capitol Labels Group\n\n“As we continue to work with our artists to build global brands, the past 12 months have seen a number of important successes,” says Grebner, who cites Olivia Rodrigo’s second album, GUTS, a No. 1 debut in 13 countries, and Reneé Rapp’s Snow Angel, a top 10 debut on the U.K. Official Albums chart. Other high points include Karol G, who charted nine of the 10 songs on Mañana Será Bonito (Bichota Season), and Billie Eilish, who hit No. 1 in Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Switzerland — and won her second Academy Award — with “What Was I Made For?” In March, Universal Music Group unveiled its newly restructured West Coast label operation under the banner Interscope Capitol Labels Group.\n\nDonna Gryn\n\nChief marketing officer, Republic Records\n\nStephanie Perez\n\nSenior vp of marketing strategy, Republic Records\n\n“We’ve been simultaneously strategic and aggressive with our international strategy over the last year,” says Gryn, who, along with Perez, was promoted to a new post earlier this year. That approach “really made an impact worldwide,” Gryn adds, citing Noah Kahan’s major breakout in the United Kingdom with “Stick Season” (seven weeks at No. 1) and Ireland (14 weeks at No. 1). Meanwhile, the single’s namesake album also clinched No. 1 for multiple weeks in Canada, Ireland and The Netherlands. Ariana Grande’s long-awaited Eternal Sunshine claimed No. 1 in over 10 markets, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and The Netherlands.

Over the past year, Laufey, from Iceland, won best traditional pop vocal album at the Grammy Awards for Bewitched, which also topped Billboard’s Jazz Albums and Traditional Jazz Albums charts. Meanwhile, since AWAL signed Djo (the moniker of actor Joe Keery from Netflix’s Stranger Things) in 2019, he has achieved global stardom, particularly with his breakout viral hit, “End of Beginning,” which earned him his first entry on the Hot 100 and landed at No. 2 on Spotify’s global chart.

Warner Records launched Boone, whose “Beautiful Things” has spent eight weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, with a “global-first, fan-first, culture-first approach,” Larsen says. Similarly, Warner Records has worked with Swims for four years “to build real fan bases all over the world” for “Lose Control,” which hit No. 4 on the Billboard Global 200, Larsen says.

Virgin Music Group’s global wins range from Chicago’s David Kushner and Miami’s Gonzy to Nigeria’s Rema, France’s Zaho de Sagazan and Australia’s G Flip.\n\nTed May\n\nManaging director U.K./head of international for music, MNRK Music Group\n\nMay takes pride in the balance that his indie company struck across music genres over the past year, from rock legend Ace Frehley’s late-career overseas success, to Gregory Alan Isakov’s accolades in the folk world, to GEE LEE’s dance streaming hit “Fake ID (Coke & Rum Remix)” and other tracks reaching over 100 million streams in a year, according to MNRK. “There has been no other indie nurturing acts across so many genres in so many markets globally this year,” May says, while also teasing an upcoming “huge international rap crossover record” from MNRK.\n\nBen Mortimer\n\nPresident, Polydor Records U.K.\n\nPolydor scored numerous victories in the United Kingdom in 2023, including No. 1 albums from Olivia Rodrigo, Cian Ducrot, boygenius, Ellie Goulding and The Rolling Stones, as well as two catalog titles in the Official Charts Company’s year-end top 10: Eminem’s Curtain Call: The Hits and ABBA’s Gold. There were also breakthroughs for rapper Clavish and Irish dance artist Jazzy, whose hit single “Giving Me” was the first release on Polydor’s new electronic music imprint, Chaos. Lana Del Rey notched her sixth U.K. No. 1 album with Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd. “She’s a true artist in every sense of the word,” Mortimer says, “and there’s so much more to come.”\n\nRoshi Motman\n\nCEO, Amuse\n\nAfter rising in prominence following the success of Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” in 2019, global digital distribution service Amuse remains a top player in the music industry, especially for independent artists. In 2023, Amuse enjoyed success in Sweden, where it had five of the 10 most-streamed songs on Spotify, while one of its licensed acts, Yot Club, reached 1 billion streams with “YKWIM?” “There’s a monumental shift happening in the industry,” Motman says, “and we’re excited to support the new generation of independent stars.”\n\nSuhel Nafar\n\nManaging director, West Africa and North Africa, EMPIRE\n\nEzegozie Eze Jr.\n\nVp of strategy and market development of Africa and Diaspora, EMPIRE\n\nMobolaji Kareem\n\nRegional head of West Africa, EMPIRE\n\nAfter leading the music industry to rethink how it approached distribution of rap albums and singles starting in 2010, the EMPIRE team shifted its attention to Africa. Since 2019, the distributor turned label and content powerhouse has been a major force on the continent, “with the success of Fireboy DML, Asake, Kizz Daniel, Black Sherif, and the unprecedented collaborative project between Bnxn fka Buju and Ruger,” says Eke. And the company has already established a presence in South Africa, North Africa and West Asia in a bid to become one of the fastest-growing music companies in those regions.\n\nJamie Oborne\n\nFounder/owner, Dirty Hit/All on Red\n\nWhile indie label Dirty Hit has grown under Oborne’s stewardship to boast such hit-makers as Bleachers and beabadoobee on its roster, its flagship act remains The 1975, which Oborne has managed for over a decade. The act, which staged its Still… At Their Very Best tour in North America and European arenas in late 2023 and early 2024, has sold nearly 2 million concert tickets, according to Oborne. The group also joined TikTok, with videos using its hashtag boasting over 4 billion combined views. “The campaign has been incredibly personally rewarding,” Oborne says.\n\nAlejandra Olea\n\nManaging director of Americas, Believe\n\nAndreea Gleeson\n\nCEO, TuneCore\n\nRomain Vivien\n\nGlobal head of music/president of Europe, Believe\n\nThe past year has been “incredibly exciting” for the Paris-based digital distribution company “thanks to our team’s unrivaled digital expertise, passion and commitment to empowering local music scenes all around the world,” Vivien says. Believe has grown both at home and abroad. The company says it had a 29% market share in France for the top albums and top singles locally, including the highest-selling French album of the year, Carré, by newcomer Werenoi. Another notable feat: Iñigo Quintero’s viral song “Si No Estás,” which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart in November. A consortium led by Believe founder Denis Ladegaillerie plans to take the company private in the coming year after Warner Music ended acquisition talks.\n\nMaykel Piron\n\nCEO, Armada Music\n\nArmada Music crossed the 20-year mark in 2023 and remains a force in EDM. With a “strong history in creativity and innovation,” Piron says, Armada launched the first dance music investment company with BEAT Music Fund. Shortly afterward, Armada bolstered its catalog globally by adding legacy acts including Dutch duo Chocolate Puma, New York-based independent dance label King Street Sounds, U.K.-based Sola Records and Viva Music. “It has been and remains a privilege to work with the kinds of people that sparked my passion for dance music in the first place,” he says, “and that passion is still very much alive to this day.”\n\nMartin Price\n\nSenior vp of global business development, ONErpm\n\nAhu Ozisik\n\nCountry manager of Turkey, ONErpm\n\nONErpm, which provides digital distribution and artist services, has had year-over-year growth of 40%, Price says, “combined with the rollout of our broader new offerings of Offstep and Enterprise Solutions and continued successful expansion into Scandinavia and the Middle East.” Offstep is a digital distribution service designed for DIY artists, while Enterprise Solutions offers financial and accounting services. In Turkey, ONErpm “has seen over 150% growth from 2022 to 2023,” Ozisik says, with success stories such as the Azer Bülbül Tribute project — which honors the late Turkish singer-actor — reaching over 178 million streams, according to the company.\n\nPaul Redding\n\nCEO, Beggars Group\n\nAlex Keague-Davies\n\nGM, Matador Records\n\n“Our global structure continued to deliver success for our artists and labels,” says Redding of Beggars Group, which is home to labels Matador, 4AD, Rough Trade, XL Recordings and Young. He cites Queens of the Stone Age and The National as two rock bands under its umbrella that released albums in 2023 and went on tours that delivered “unspeakably great live shows” to fans. “There were so many other successes from our artists in so many different countries,” he says. “I could not be more excited about the artists on all our labels and look forward to 2024 being even better.”\n\nJeffrey Remedios\n\nChairman/CEO, Universal Music Canada\n\nJulie Adam\n\nExecutive vp/GM, Universal Music Canada\n\nJP Boucher\n\nSenior vp of marketing, Universal Music Canada\n\nUnder Remedios’ leadership, Universal Music Canada has been the driving force behind award-winning, record-breaking artist projects, initiatives and campaigns over the past 12 months. “The results speak for themselves,” he says. “In Canada in 2023, eight of the top 10 albums overall were by Universal Music artists, and Universal had the No. 1 album 33 of 52 weeks of the year. Canadian artists Josh Ross, Jamie Fine and Preston Pablo continued to break records in Canada and chart internationally, and we’re expanding our epic roster by signing new deals with powerhouse artists.”\n\nRuben Santos\n\nVp of A&R for Cinq Music Latin America, Cinq Music\n\nIn 2023, Santos played a pivotal role in driving Cinq Music’s mission to promote Latin artists worldwide. He notes that singles from Haze and Jhayco, Calle 24 and Chino Pacas, and Fuerza Regida, as well as the release of Tito Torbellino Jr’s album Torbellino and other Cinq projects, helped “fuel the Latin landscape to unprecedented heights,” amassing approximately 500 million streams in total last year, according to the company. “With strategic vision, an innovative approach to artist collaboration and a curated roster of mega hit-makers across genres from reggaetón to regional Mexican,” he says, “I feel proud that my contributions have set the stage for continued cultural richness and the global appeal of Latin American music.”\n\nAdriana Sein\n\nHead of global artist and market development, ADA Worldwide\n\nHoward Corner\n\nManaging director, ADA U.K.\n\nAlassane Konate\n\nManaging director, ADA France\n\nBen Ralph\n\nSenior vp, ADA Australasia\n\nCesar Lores\n\nDirector, ADA Iberia\n\nADA has logged multiple successes over the last year, including Spanish artist Quevedo’s debut album, Donde Quiero Estar, which generated over 3 billion streams and debuted at No. 12 on Top Latin Albums. Sonny Fodera’s gold-certified “Asking” was the first single in a decade from an artist-owned dance label to enter the U.K. top 10. Other notable ADA achievements: Kerser scored the highest-selling first-week numbers for an Australian artist with A Gift & A Kers, and Hamza’s Sincèrement reached No. 1 in France. Sein was instrumental in securing a global distribution deal for U.S.-based Rostrum Records, founded by CEO Benjy Grinberg. One of the world’s leading independent labels, Rostrum launched the careers of Wiz Khalifa and the late Mac Miller.\n\nWassim “SAL” Slaiby\n\nFounder/CEO, SALXCO/XO, Universal Music Arabic\n\nSlaiby knows a star when he sees one. The Weeknd’s longtime manager, through his company SALXCO, has been involved in the careers of multiple chart-topping musicians — from Brandy to Bryson Tiller to French Montana. He has been helping to push Middle Eastern music to the forefront in the United States with artists like Mohamed Ramadan and Elyanna. “Witnessing Elyanna’s historic performance at Coachella [in 2023], where she became the first artist to captivate the audience with a set in Arabic, and subsequently selling out her North American tour at such a young age has been so special,” he says.\n\nMarcelo Soares\n\nPresident, Som Livre\n\nSoares is beyond proud of what Brazilian record company Som Livre achieved last year. “It commanded the top positions of the Brazilian charts in 2023 with five of the top seven songs in the country, and ‘Leão’ by the late Marília Mendonça leading the way,” he says. At last year’s Latin Grammy Awards, held in Seville, Spain, the label’s talent received four of the nine nominations in the Portuguese-language categories including best Portuguese language rock or alternative album, best Portuguese language urban performance, best Portuguese language song and best sertanejo music album.\n\nKieran Thurgood\n\nSenior vp of global marketing, Capitol Music Group\n\nThurgood points to Doechii and her breakout hit, “What It Is” (featuring Kodak Black), as a global success story for Capitol. The song “sparked out of Nigeria and the Philippines, which in turn created a hit in the U.S., with the song recently topping U.S. charts,” he says. The single reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Rhythmic Airplay chart in June. And while he adds that Ice Spice “has been a key global focus” for the label, he promises an “even bigger 2024” for the fast-rising superstar. “It’s a hugely exciting time for Capitol,” he says. “The building is just buzzing.”\n\nChloé van Bergen\n\nVp of operations for U.K. and Europe, Secretly Group\n\nChris Cannon\n\nHead of international strategy, Secretly Distribution\n\nTom Davies\n\nDirector of global marketing and campaigns, Secretly Distribution\n\nWith new offices in Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and Sydney, the Secretly Group of labels and Secretly Distribution enjoyed international growth in 2023. Notably, Secretly Group celebrated the viral success of Mitski’s “My Love Mine All Mine,” which entered the top 30 of the Hot 100 and ruled the TikTok Billboard Top 50 for six weeks. Secretly Distribution added new label clients (including Chrysalis Records and Moshi Moshi Records), with van Bergen citing “hugely successful campaigns it oversaw, such as Sufjan Stevens’ acclaimed Javelin [Asthmatic Kitty], El Michels Affair & Black Thought [Big Crown], Say She She [Colemine Records] and label services client campaigns such as A24, Reverend Kristin Michael Hayter, Beirut and many more.”\n\nDan Waite\n\nCEO, Better Noise Music\n\nIn a year where he moved from president to CEO of hard rock-focused label Better Noise Music, Waite has also been involved in discussions about royalty changes with Spotify and Apple Music in his role as chair of the indie-supporting IMPALA Digital Committee, “representing concerns and questions from the IMPALA members across Europe.” With Better Noise, he has enjoyed another successful year for acts like longtime rock hit-makers Five Finger Death Punch, including a tour supporting Metallica and a No. 1 on Billboard’s Mainstream Rock Airplay chart with “Welcome to the Circus” — the band’s record-extending 10th consecutive No. 1 on the chart.\n\nManuel Abud\n\nCEO, Latin Recording Academy\n\nGlobal expansion and diversification have been the core goals of the Latin Recording Academy over the past year. For the first time, not only were the Latin Grammy Awards held abroad, in Seville, Spain, but also featured 100% female representation in the four main categories — and Laura Pausini was honored as the 2023 person of the year. As part of its international expansion plan, the academy also pursued opportunities in Mexico, Brazil and Spain outside of awards season. “I am very proud to continue leading my team with the support of our board of trustees,” Abud says, “and look forward to continue building on this momentum of our evolution in the year ahead.”\n\nCharlie Lexton\n\nCOO, Merlin\n\nMerlin, which represents 15% of the global recorded-music market, has spent the past year developing what Lexton calls a “data warehouse” to analyze its trove of streaming, video and social media metrics. “This sophisticated platform facilitates comprehensive analysis to deliver deep insights,” says Lexton (who was promoted to COO in 2020), at a time when Merlin had spent the previous 12 years distributing some $4 billion to its more than 500 members. Lexton’s team has also hired data, analytics, finance and software employees who are “focused on furnishing the organization’s members with unique, exclusive and actionable insights.”\n\nJohn Nolan\n\nCFO/interim joint head, IFPI\n\nLauri Rechardt\n\nChief legal officer/interim joint head, IFPI\n\nFollowing last year’s retirement of longtime CEO Frances Moore, two members of IFPI’s executive team, Nolan and Rechardt, were appointed by its global board to co-manage the organization as it searched for its next leader. (Victoria Oakley will assume the CEO role on June 1.) As CFO, Nolan is responsible for IFPI’s global revenue data for the recorded-music industry, global charts and management of the organization’s operational and financial support functions. Rechardt’s experience includes previous roles as deputy general counsel and director of licensing and litigation at IFPI, partner and head of intellectual property at a leading Finnish law firm and head of the IFPI Finnish national group.\n\nJohn Phelan\n\nDirector general, International Confederation of Music Publishers\n\nPhelan’s team helped “bag serious wins in incoming AI laws for the music industry and our songwriter and composer partners,” he says, citing the European Union AI Act, which European Parliament passed March 13 after negotiations throughout 2023. According to the ICMP, the act forces AI companies to “observe EU copyright law,” stop “illegally taking the world’s music to train AI models” and “retain detailed documentation on what content was used to train the model.” The law, Phelan adds, “will be a force multiplier for copyright protection in AI around the world, [which] matters for every last music company and creator.”\n\nAnnette Barrett\n\nManaging director/global strategic liaison, Reservoir; president, International Music Publishers Forum\n\nJeremy Lascelles\n\nCo-founder/CEO, Blue Raincoat Music; CEO, Chrysalis Records\n\nHussain “Spek” Yoosuf\n\nExecutive vp of international and emerging markets, Reservoir; founder/CEO, PopArabia\n\nIn the past year, Reservoir’s global offices have executed strategic deals through its venture with PopArabia, such as signing “Queen of Pop” Nancy Ajram and continuing to develop PopArabia’s rights organization, ESMAA. The first-of-its-kind music rights management entity looks to protect artists and music creators throughout the United Arab Emirates and the Persian Gulf. One of its major accomplishments includes creating the first licensing platform for music publishers and performing rights organizations in the Middle East and North Africa. “It is an honor,” Yoosuf says, “to be recognized alongside my colleagues Jeremy Lascelles and Annette Barrett out of the U.K.”\n\nBenjamin Budde\n\nCEO, Budde Group\n\nBudde is the third-generation CEO of the Berlin-based, family-owned music publisher, which ranks fifth in Germany by market share behind the majors and BMG. Over the past decade, he has expanded the company into talent management, concert promotion and a co-owned agency business that represents film/TV clients, as well as musicians. One big 2023 highlight: a Grammy nomination for the joint-venture tribute album I Am a Pilgrim: Doc Watson at 100, which featured contributions from Dolly Parton, Rosanne Cash and others. Budde Talent Agency is becoming a major player in Europe, and Budde has global ambitions. “I want international success stories for our writers,” he says. “Global hits.”\n\nCatrin Drabble\n\nCFO, Kobalt\n\nRob Christensen\n\nExecutive vp/head of global synch, Kobalt\n\nJon Trumbull\n\nGlobal head of client services and administration, Kobalt\n\nLeslie Ahrens\n\nSenior vp of creative for Latin America, Kobalt\n\nKenny McGoff\n\nHead of creative U.K., Kobalt\n\n“Collectively, the Kobalt team has been behind some of the most important artists of the last 12 months,” McGoff says. He hails Billboard Women in Music 2024 Woman of the Year Karol G, “who continues to break new ground.” Her 2023 album, Mañana Será Bonito, became the first all-Spanish-language album by a female artist to top the Billboard 200 and earned the Latin pop star her first Grammy Award in February. He also cites “top-­liner Mocha” (Imani Lewis), who co-wrote Tyla’s global smash and Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart No. 1, “Water,” and The Last Dinner Party, “one of the most exciting new bands in the world.”\n\nKim Frankiewicz\n\nExecutive vp of worldwide A&R, Concord Music Publishing\n\nTina Funk\n\nManaging director, Concord Music Publishing Germany, Switzerland and Austria\n\nJaime Gough\n\nManaging director, Concord Australia and New Zealand\n\nConcord’s recent successes include such newly minted Grammy winners as South African star Tyla, whose “Water” won best African music performance, and U.K. grime MC-producer Flowdan, whose “Rumble,” a collaboration with Skrillex and Fred again.., won best dance/electronic recording. Concord has also achieved success with Berlin-based songwriter Kristine Bogan, who co-wrote K-pop girl group NewJeans’ hit “Super Shy,” a track from the act’s Billboard 200-topping EP, Get Up. “Our songwriters from across the roster and around the globe had an incredible year with breakthrough hits,” Frankiewicz says. “All this success comes from our creative team and the global network we’ve built.”\n\nShani Gonzales\n\nManaging director, Warner Chappell Music U.K.; head of international A&R, Warner Chappell Music\n\nNatascha Augustin\n\nManaging director, Warner Chappell Music Germany\n\nLars Karlsson\n\nManaging director, Warner Chappell Music Scandinavia\n\nGustavo Menéndez\n\nPresident, U.S. Latin and Latin America, Warner Chappell Music\n\nSantiago Menéndez-Pidal\n\nPresident, Warner Chappell Music Southern Europe\n\nMatthieu Tessier\n\nManaging director, Warner Chappell Music France\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Gonzales oversaw Warner Chappell Music writer Dave teaming up with Central Cee for the 2023 single “Sprinter,” which became the longest-reigning U.K. rap single in U.K. chart history. According to the Official Charts Company, Warner Chappell Music Germany achieved a 27.8% market share in 2023, in part thanks to Augustin’s embrace of German-language hip-hop. Under Karlsson, Warner Chappell writer Loreen won Sweden’s Melodifestivalen contest with “Tattoo,” which she then took to the Eurovision Song Contest. At the Latin Grammy Awards, held in Spain last year, Menéndez celebrated the person of the year honor going to Italian-born Warner Chappell writer-performer Laura Pausini, the first artist born outside of Latin America or Spain to receive the recognition.\n\nDavid Gray\n\nExecutive vp/head of U.S. A&R/head of global creative group, Universal Music Publishing Group\n\nAlexandra Lioutikoff\n\nPresident of Latin America and U.S. Latin, Universal Music Publishing Group\n\nYadira Moreno\n\nManaging director of Mexico and Central America, Universal Music Publishing Group\n\nAna Rosa Santiago\n\nSenior vp of Latin America and U.S. Latin, Universal Music Publishing Group\n\nMore than ever, the team at UMPG is leveraging its network of offices around the world to provide its writers with new opportunities. “[We] think globally, act locally,” Lioutikoff says. “UMPG first looks at UMPG artists and writers in their original market and then ideates how to leverage the writing talents available from other various territories to create worldwide opportunities.” These international opportunities for writers are often spearheaded by UMPG’s Global Creative Group, a worldwide team of A&R executives and creatives. Its successes this year included forming the unlikely pairing of Mexican artist-writer Carín León and its Nashville writers and encouraging the collaboration between Brazil’s Luísa Sonza and Demi Lovato on “Penhasco 2,” a No. 4 hit on the Billboard Brazil Hot 100.\n\nAlexandra Lioutikoff is Billboard‘s inaugural International Power Players’ Choice Award recipient.

It also demonstrated the value of “timeless, well-managed music and ensured a second successful exit event for our investors, following the 2020 [initial public offering] of the portfolio that we originally launched back in 2012,” he says.\n\nGuy Henderson\n\nPresident of international, Sony Music Publishing\n\nDavid Ventura\n\nPresident/co-managing director of U.K./senior vp of international, Sony Music Publishing\n\nTim Major\n\nCo-managing director of U.K., Sony Music Publishing\n\nNicolas Galibert\n\nManaging director of France, Sony Music Publishing\n\nJorge Mejia\n\nPresident/CEO of Latin America and U.S. Latin, Sony Music Publishing\n\nThe publisher scored a global smash with Rema and Selena Gomez’s No. 3 Billboard Global 200 hit, “Calm Down,” produced by Michael “London” Hunter; landed numerous Latin chart-­toppers, including Shakira and Karol G’s “TQG,” co-written by Keityn; and paired Dan Smith of Bastille with composer Hans Zimmer on the score to the BBC’s Planet Earth III. “We are very intentional about nurturing meaningful connections with our songwriters so that we can help them to realize their creative ambitions,” Major says. Ventura notes working with Sony’s Social Justice Fund and SMP’s Songwriters Forward initiative, which “continues to make an impact on the next generation of talent.”\n\nDavid Loiterton\n\nPresident of Indo and Asia Pacific, Primary Wave Music\n\nLoiterton highlights last year’s investment in Indian label/music publisher Times Music — part of the Times of India media conglomerate — as part of Primary Wave’s effort to invest in emerging markets, which he notes “will be the growth engine for the business over the next decade.” The deal marked the company’s “first strategic partnership in emerging markets,” he adds, and “recognizes the growth of non-­English-language music in markets like the U.S.”\n\nMerck Mercuriadis\n\nFounder/chairman, Hipgnosis Song Management\n\nMercuriadis and the Hipgnosis team have had an indelible impact on the catalog market since the company’s inception. Now Mercuriadis, who recently stepped down as Hipgnosis’ CEO but remains its chairman, has $3 billion in assets under management, including parts of catalogs from Justin Bieber, Shakira, David Foster, Tobias Jesso Jr., Erika Ender and TMS in the last few years. Since 2023, Hipgnosis has handled $400 million in acquisitions that includes more than 50 No. 1 hits from Taylor Swift, Mariah Carey and Beyoncé, according to the company. Hipgnosis Songs Management is the investment adviser to Hipgnosis Songs Fund, whose board in April received competing takeover bids from Concord and Blackstone.\n\nMary Megan Peer\n\nCEO, peermusic\n\nSpencer Lee\n\nPresident of Asia Pacific, peermusic\n\nIn October, peermusic opened its 39th office, making it one of the most international independent publishers in the world. As part of the new deal, peermusic also acquired Arctic Rights Management’s catalog of over 5,000 recordings and compositions, including publishing interest in hits like “Don’t Start Now” and “New Rules” by Dua Lipa. It has become a top choice for rights holders, including Hipgnosis and Concord, that need robust international administration services. Plus, its 2016 acquisition of MusicCube has made peermusic a major player in K-pop. “South Korea is the third-largest country in peermusic’s global network on an income basis,” Peer says, citing hits recorded by acts such as NewJeans, G(I)-DLE and Le Sserafim that have contributed most to the company’s 17% compound annual growth rate in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nEmily Stephenson\n\nPresident, Downtown Music Publishing\n\nThando Makhunga\n\nManaging director, Sheer Publishing Africa\n\nScoring new deals with artists like Peso Pluma and Colbie Caillat, Downtown Music Publishing had “unprecedented growth” throughout 2023, Stephenson says. Downtown also represented 11 global songwriters who took home Grammy Awards in 2024, including best traditional pop vocal album and best tropical Latin album. The company helped place Bruce Hornsby’s “The Show Goes On” in the season premiere of FX’s Emmy Award-winning TV series The Bear and secured a new administrative services deal with publisher Spirit Music Group. Stephenson attributes Downtown’s blockbuster year to its “unwavering commitment to serving emerging, independent artists around the world.”\n\nDion Brant\n\nCEO, Frontier Touring\n\nSusan Heymann\n\nCOO, Frontier Touring\n\nFrontier Touring set about smashing records in 2023 with over 600 shows across Australia; more than 40 of those were in stadiums, including Ed Sheeran’s +-=÷x Tour. Equally impressive, Brant says, are the more than 20 new acts broken in that time as touring headliners. “Our approach is different from other promoters,” he says. “Our priorities are the artist, the fans and the show, ahead of the net profit or the quarterly market update.” That success continued in early 2024 with Taylor Swift’s sold-out, seven-date Australian stadium run for her The Eras Tour, produced by Frontier.\n\nCarolina Daza\n\nHead of live entertainment, Cárdenas Marketing Network\n\nLuis Miguel’s world tour kicked off in August with a run of 20 arena shows between Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile.

Live Nation promoted 71 arena dates in the region by German schlager singer Helene Fischer, one of the biggest arena concerts in Germany’s history in the number of shows, according to Live Nation. Kneebone, with help from Lok, oversaw TWICE becoming the first female group to headline a stadium in Australia and the first K-pop act to play such a venue with its one show in November at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne.\n\nPascual Egea\n\nHead of Europe, WK Entertainment\n\nCésar Figueiredo\n\nArtist manager, WK Entertainment/Central Sonora\n\n“Central Sonora has proven to be a powerhouse among Brazil’s exclusive artist management companies,” Figueiredo says. “Its partnership with WK Entertainment has been instrumental in making strides to foster creativity and diversity in the global music landscape.” The artist manager’s top acts include Brazilian superstar Ludmilla, who was named Billboard’s Latin Artist on the Rise in February 2023. Her accolades include winning best Latin collaboration at the LOS40 Music Awards in 2023 and, more recently, “accumulating more than 5 million streams in less than 24 hours” with album Numanice #3, Figueiredo adds. The Rio de Janeiro native performed at this year’s Coachella festival.\n\nKaori Hayashi\n\nCEO, Hayashi International Promotions\n\nHayashi says that “without a doubt” her company’s greatest achievement over the past year was promoting seven sold-out Bruno Mars stadium shows at the Tokyo Dome, which she says broke all records for Japanese box-office receipts and confirmed “that Bruno is the No. 1 international artist in Japan.” Hayashi runs the company founded by her father, Hiromichi “Massy” Hayashi, and was recognized last fall in Billboard Japan’s Women in Music interview series. “There aren’t many female concert promoters out there,” she says, “so I’d be happy if people notice me for being the next generation of the business and for being a rare woman in it who can really help shake up the industry.”\n\nAlex Hill\n\nPresident/CEO, AEG Europe\n\nAdam Wilkes\n\nChairman/CEO, AEG Asia Pacific; chairman of the board, Frontier Touring\n\nSteve Homer\n\nCEO, AEG Presents U.K.\n\nJim King\n\nCEO of European festivals, AEG Presents\n\nJohn Langford\n\nCOO, AEG Europe\n\nSimon Jones\n\nSenior vp of international touring, AEG Presents\n\nFor AEG Europe, Hill oversees venues, tours and festivals including BST Hyde Park in London, which in 2023 welcomed P!nk, Blackpink, Guns N’ Roses, Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, Take That, Lana Del Rey and Billy Joel.

Jones guides AEG tours outside North America, including Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour.\n\nJoe Howard\n\nGlobal festival promoter, C3 Presents\n\nHuston Powell\n\nPromoter, C3 Presents\n\nGlobal impact is a C3 Presents hallmark, as Lollapalooza consistently showcases robust lineups of local and regional talent along with major global touring acts. Howard has observed an uptick in international artists playing higher positions on festival bills, “from Stray Kids headlining Lolla Paris last summer to the significant slots for Karol G, Tomorrow X Together and NewJeans performing at Lolla Chicago, and The Rose playing five different Lollapalooza festivals in the last year between South America, Chicago, Berlin in 2023 and, most recently, in Mumbai [India] this past January.” Colombian artist Feid’s headlining turns at Lolla Chile and Argentina in March provided another highlight.\n\nBlaine Legere\n\nPresident of international, AXS\n\nThe AEG-owned ticketing platform launched AXS New Zealand and AXS Australia with a mix of venue, sports and music clients. Two subsequent high points for the company included the Foo Fighters’ Christchurch gig at Orangetheory Stadium and Paramore’s record-breaking performance at The Domain in Sydney. In Japan, AXS tripled the size of its tech and support teams in running the Valorant Riot Games Championship in Tokyo and supporting World Baseball Classic events in Tokyo and Osaka. “Our presence in [Asia Pacific],” Legere says, “was a key component of AXS winning” the ticketing services deal for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nPeter Loxton\n\nCOO of commercial, ASM Global\n\nASM Global’s presence in the Middle East has grown with the addition of new venues within Expo City Dubai, which hosted COP28 alongside the Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Loxton is also excited about partnerships in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, as well as ventures in East Asia. “This year, the finishing touches are being made to the massive Pearl of the Orient, Kai Tak Sports Park, in Hong Kong,” he says, “and we continue to collaborate on Brisbane Live Arena, which will enhance the entertainment legacy of the city, both for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games and the future.”\n\nKlaus-Peter Schulenberg\n\nCEO, CTS Eventim\n\nEurope’s largest ticketing company, CTS Events, enjoyed a second record-breaking year in revenue and profitability with an international expansion that includes the acquisitions, in partnership with Sony Music Latin-Iberia, of Punto Ticket in Chile and Teleticket in Peru. Besides successfully handling the sales for highly anticipated tours such as Taylor Swift, AC/DC and Rammstein, the company was appointed as one of two ticketers for the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games alongside AEG’s AXS. “These key endeavors underscore our dedication to worldwide growth,” Schulenberg says, “and strengthen CTS Eventim’s position in global live entertainment.”\n\nAlejandro Soberón Kuri\n\nFounder/CEO, OCESA\n\nOctavio Padilla\n\nDirector, OCESA Seitrack\n\nLeizer Guss Guss\n\nFestivals director, OCESA\n\nIn 2023, Soberón Kuri says, OCESA “connected the best artists and bands on the planet with an amazing audience, based on creativity, experience and ­knowledge.” Majority-owned by Live Nation since 2021, the Mexico City-based concert promoter brought fans international superstars like Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, Lana Del Rey, The Weeknd, Billie Eilish, Post Malone, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rauw Alejandro, Imagine Dragons, Mötley Crüe/Def Leppard and Peso Pluma. “Jointly with Live Nation,” Soberón Kuri says, “we will continue to be one of the most prominent cities in the artistic circuit in the world for artists, promoters and music producers to showcase their talent and connect with the best audiences.”\n\nSia Aghaiepour\n\nFounder/CEO, Heavy Rotation\n\nThe booking agency Heavy Rotation “has been making waves in the Middle East,” Aghaiepour says, “orchestrating over 70 blockbuster shows featuring superstars like Chris Brown, Davido, Rema, Asake and many more.” Strategic partnerships with Live Nation Middle East and Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, have “propelled us to new heights,” Aghaiepour says, crediting his “squad for their resilience and ingenuity in shaping the future of global entertainment.”\n\nEmma Banks\n\nMike Greek\n\nCo-heads of international touring/co-heads of London office, CAA\n\nChris Dalston\n\nMarlene Tsuchii\n\nCo-heads of international touring, CAA\n\nAndy Cook\n\nMusic agent, CAA\n\nCAA clients including Harry Styles, Beyoncé, The Weeknd, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Muse and Westlife sold out stadium tours throughout Europe, Asia, South America and Australia, while Lana Del Rey, blink-182, Hozier and Noah Kahan embarked on sold-out global outdoor and arena runs, with “even bigger shows ahead in 2024,” Cook says. He also cites the “staggering success” of AC/DC’s forthcoming Power Up tour, the band’s first European tour in eight years, which Cook says sold 1.5 million tickets internationally the day it went on sale.\n\nMatt Bates\n\nCEO/agent, Primary Talent International\n\nRick Levy\n\nPartner/board member, Primary Talent International\n\nAfter announcing a surprise split with CAA in March 2023 — less than a year after CAA acquired Primary Talent through its purchase of Primary’s parent company, ICM Presents — the U.K. booking agency has continued to grow as a “reestablished independent,” Bates says. Since the decoupling, according to the agency, it has booked over 6,000 shows internationally — and sold 400,000 headline tickets for The 1975 in the United Kingdom alone. Last April, the company also welcomed former ICM agent Pete Nash as a partner, gaining his clients including Kings of Leon, Pet Shop Boys, Regina Spektor, Steve Winwood and Travis.\n\nJeff Craib\n\nCEO, The Feldman Agency\n\nRob Segal\n\nPresident of TFA brands and partnerships, The Feldman Agency\n\n“Over the past year at TFA, my biggest achievement has been shepherding the new business in owned and operated properties,” Segal says, “like Montreal Grand Prix, now expanding to Miami; launching the first season of The Bowl, Toronto’s new outdoor concert venue; and spearheading licensing and branding opportunities for our roster of talented artists.” The agency, which has a long-term strategy that includes verticals besides representing its touring artists, boasts a roster that features Shania Twain, Avril Lavigne, Sum 41, Simple Plan, Barenaked Ladies, Alvvays, Feist, Alessia Cara and Nelly Furtado.\n\nLucy Dickins\n\nPartner/global head of contemporary music and touring, WME\n\nJosh Javor\n\nPartner/co-head of London music department, WME\n\nJames Rubin\n\nPartner/co-head of hip-hop/R&B, WME\n\nBrett Murrihy\n\nPartner/head of music Asia Pacific, WME\n\nShannon Saunders\n\nAgent, WME\n\nTeams in Latin America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region have made WME “the only major music booking agency with multiple regional servicing groups,” Dickins says. This reach made it possible to book “a wide range of truly global tours this year” with runs including a 214-show Backstreet Boys outing that visited six continents and, Dickins says, sold over 2 million tickets. Usher held a residency in Paris; Luis Miguel launched a 121-show tour in North, South and Central America; Bruno Mars played seven sold-out shows at Japan’s Tokyo Dome; Zach Bryan played his first European headlining shows; and J Balvin played his first headline dates in Australia. Adele’s upcoming residency in Munich will also mark the first time an artist has had a stadium purposely built for a show.\n\nUlises Gasparini\n\nGeneral director of GTS Brazil, Global Talent Services\n\nGaby Gómez\n\nDirector of GTS Live Mexico, Global Talent Services\n\nMari Cruz Laguna Santos\n\nGTS Live director/corporate representative, Global Talent Services\n\nIn the past year, Global Talent Services, a division of Universal Music Group, has positioned itself as a top-level agency for management in Spain with 24 acts on its roster, in addition to its live-events division selling out over 500 shows in 2023. In Mexico, GTS sold 175 shows among 25 artists and, in Brazil, serves as the booking agency and managing partner for acts such as Maneva, Leo Santana, Atitude 67, Felipe Araújo and Paula Fernandes. One of the company’s notable highlights, according to Cruz Laguna Santos, is “the positioning of Colombian band Morat as the No. 1 Spanish-speaking pop-rock act of the moment.” The band sold out 1 million tickets across 125 concerts in 15 countries for its Si Ayer Fuera Hoy tour, according to GTS.\n\nHady Hajjar\n\nCo-founder/managing director, HuManagement\n\nRepresenting clients and celebrities from the Middle East and North Africa, HuManagement has had significant growth in the last year through its talent representation business and celebrity marketing work. “Our strategic partnership with Warner Music further solidifies our world position, enabling us to amplify local talent, global superstars and world-class events to the region including F1, Joy Awards and the Red Sea International Film Festival,” Hajjar says. “With the entertainment market expected to grow in the region 9.41% by 2029, we’re excited to be a part of shaping the future of film, music, sports and cultural events.”\n\nKeith Naisbitt\n\nExecutive vp of global touring, Independent Artist Group\n\nPeter Pappalardo\n\nExecutive vp/head of global touring, Independent Artist Group\n\nPappalardo calls 50 Cent’s Final Lap European tour a highlight last year for the company, which was created from the merger of the Agency for the Performing Arts and Artist Group International in June. He says the 50 Cent run boasted a “near 100% sellout rate,” including more than 30,000 tickets sold in Paris and the “fastest sellout” in the history of Riga, Latvia. The tour, which was originally scheduled for 25 shows, garnered such “overwhelming demand,” he adds, that the number of dates swelled to 38 across the continent.\n\nJon Ollier\n\nCEO, One Fiinix Live\n\nThe British booking agency, management firm and digital marketing agency One Fiinix Live experienced “impressive growth” in 2023, according to Ollier, who adds, “We have developed a brand we are incredibly proud of, and we now have agents in both the U.S. and international markets.” Besides bringing tour shows to clubs, theaters, arenas and stadiums, the company has helped post record-breaking runs in Australia and Asia with Ed Sheeran. “It is my belief,” Ollier says, “that we are positioned to become the leading independent agency.”\n\nBrent Smith\n\nExecutive vp/managing executive, Wasserman Music\n\nTom Schroeder\n\nExecutive vp/managing executive, Wasserman Music (U.K.)\n\nJesse Fayne\n\nVp of international festivals, Wasserman Music\n\nAnna Bewers\n\nRyan Penty\n\nAgents, Wasserman Music (U.K.)\n\nThe agency continued representing major stars including SZA, Nothing but Thieves and Fred again.. along with “many of the most promising new artists around the world,” Schroeder says. He says the essential element driving Wasserman Music’s international growth has been “fostering innovation and integration across all the services we provide globally,” from talent booking, brand partnerships and artist marketing to “cross-pollinating all aspects of entertainment, sports and culture.” But, he says, it’s the company’s “core characteristics — passion, creativity, authenticity, industriousness — that have set us apart and always will.”\n\nNeil Warnock\n\nCo-head of UTA U.K./head of global touring, UTA\n\nObi Asika\n\nCo-head of UTA U.K., UTA\n\nAnna Gregorek\n\nSenior director of music brand partnerships and strategic marketing, UTA\n\nCarlos Abreu\n\nAgent, music, UTA\n\nJames Gartshore Boulter\n\nAgent, endorsements and voiceover, UTA\n\nAbreu cites “a record-breaking year, which wouldn’t have become a reality without the hard work of every single skilled agent and colleague across our offices globally.” Highlights include Rosalía performing for 160,000 people at Mexico City’s Zocalo, Karol G’s sold-out Latin American stadium tour and upcoming sold-out European tour, Bring Me the Horizon’s headlining European festival run, Paramore’s sold-out Latin American tour, Post Malone’s headlining set at the inaugural edition of São Paulo’s The Town festival and Burna Boy and Wizkid’s debut London stadium shows. “Our international team,” Abreu says, “impacted global culture in an incredible way.”\n\nHonorees in this sector were chosen solely by Billboard’s editorial team and not through industry nominations.\n\nCasper Bjørner\n\nCEO, STIM\n\nThe Swedish collective management organization (CMO) celebrated its 100th anniversary last year and collected a record 2.7 billion krona ($267.3 million) in 2022, a 25.6% increase over 2021. According to STIM, it will set another record with its 2023 results, partly thanks to processing and licensing hub ICE, which it runs as a joint venture with PRS for Music and GEMA. “Sweden is once again punching above its weight as one of only three net music exporters in the world,” Bjørner says, referring to nations whose repertoire sells outside of its borders. “Laser focused on transparent and fast payments to our members, we are all set for another century of great music-making.”\n\nTobias Holzmüller\n\nCEO, GEMA\n\nLast June, Holzmüller was named CEO of GEMA, the German CMO, where he previously ran the legal department. He officially took on his new role on Oct. 1. In early April, GEMA announced that in 2023, it took in 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion), an 8.4% increase over 2022, and that for the second year in a row, it distributed over 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to its members. GEMA is part of the joint venture ICE, and Holzmüller says “we will strengthen our international position and network to become a leading voice for the rights of authors and songwriters in the global music market.” To that end, GEMA worked with SACEM to commission a study on music and AI that, Holzmüller says, “outlines for the first time the great need for action to ensure that authors still benefit appropriately from the success of technologies based on their creative works.\n\nPeter Leathem\n\nCEO, PPL\n\nAccording to PPL, the U.K. performance society that collects neighboring rights royalties for artists and labels, total revenue grew yet again in 2023, while payouts in 2022 increased by 14.3% to 279.6 million pounds ($350.6 million) from 244.7 million pounds ($306.9 million) in 2022. PPL continues “to grow the value of the global neighboring rights market through supporting the development of the rights landscape outside of Europe,” Leathem says, “including landing a new deal for performers in India and engaging with policymakers in China and Japan to further open up public performance licensing.”\n\nAndrea Czapary Martin\n\nCEO, PRS for Music\n\nIn 2022, U.K. rights collection organization PRS for Music collected a record high 964 million pounds ($1.2 billion), a 22.9% increase over 2021, and cut its cost ratio to a new low of 9.3% — a major focus for Martin. PRS also accomplished “the migration of our distribution systems to the Oracle cloud, the first CMO to do so,” Martin says. That “has accelerated our ability to process even more data so we can pay out more royalties, more accurately and more quickly.”\n\nGadi Oron\n\nDirector general, CISAC\n\nCISAC is the Paris-based trade organization of CMOs worldwide, and a flood of new content and the advent of AI are making it more important than ever. One of Oron’s big 2023 wins was continuing to modernize and increase the adoption of the International Standard Musical Work Code system, which identifies compositions to help royalties flow smoothly. “In our technology work, we support increasing demands for speed and accuracy in data exchanges,” Oron says. CISAC also plays a leading role in shaping AI regulation worldwide, including lobbying for the European Union AI Act that passed in March. “We see ourselves,” Oron says, “as the guardian of human creators and human creativity.”\n\nCristina Perpiñá-Robert\n\nCEO, SGAE\n\nPerpiñá-Robert took the top job at SGAE in April 2023 in time for the organization’s 125th anniversary this year. She is in the process of restoring SGAE’s reputation after some troubled years, and the organization collected 349 million euros ($367 million) in 2022, an increase of 35% over the previous year. In May, the organization will announce that its distributions will rise almost 12%. Perpiñá-Robert is also making SGAE more of a hub for Latin music, representing 16 societies for Pan-European online collection. “We added Argentina in late 2023 and Chile a few months before,” she says. “And our biggest composers make really young, urban music.” She also helped organize an important AI conference in March, with an event on collective management to follow in June.\n\nCécile Rap-Veber\n\nCEO, SACEM\n\nIn 2022, the French CMO collected 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) and distributed 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), and Rap-Veber says 2023, for which results are forthcoming, “was once again a record-breaking year.” Last year, she says, SACEM expanded its blockchain-based Musicstart service, ran a study with Deezer on its pioneering “artist-centric streaming” royalty model and, on the AI front, exercised “the right to opt out of generative AI training databases to ensure fair remuneration for our members” and published a study with GEMA on its impact in music. “I remain convinced that AI needs to be made more virtuous and more transparent,” Rap-Veber says. “That’s why we [were] in dialogue with policymakers” about the European Union AI Act.\n\nContributors: Trevor Anderson, Rania Aniftos, Nefertiti Austin, Katie Bain, Karen Bliss, Lars Brandle, Dave Brooks, Anna Chan, Ed Christman, Leila Cobo, Janine Coveney, Stephen Daw, Kyle Denis, Thom Duffy, Chris Eggertsen, Griselda Flores, Eric Frankenberg, Adrienne Gaffney, Paul Grein, Raquelle “Rocki” Harris, Lyndsey Havens, Rylee Johnston, Gil Kaufman, Steve Knopper, Carl Lamarre, Elias Leight, Robert Levine, Jason Lipshutz, Joe Lynch, Heran Mamo, Taylor Mims, Gail Mitchell, Melinda Newman, Jessica Nicholson, Paula Parisi, Glenn Peoples, Sigal Ratner-Arias, Isabela Raygoza, Kristin Robinson, Jessica Roiz, Craig Rosen, Crystal Shepeard, Richard Smirke, Andrew Unterberger\n\nMethodology: Billboard’s International Power Players recognizes executives whose primary responsibilities are outside the United States, solely within the industry sectors shown.
