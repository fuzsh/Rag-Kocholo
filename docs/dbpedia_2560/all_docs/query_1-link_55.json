        "text": "Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys have devoted much of their artistic lives to a war on rock nostalgia, but when you’re showing a first-time visitor around Liverpool, what can you do? You’re obliged to end up at the Cavern Club, a not-completely-uncharming replica of the vaulted, subterranean bar where the pre-Fab Four honed their fabulousness.\n\nThe attraction on this early Friday evening was a man in a tank top, who stood on the small stage murdering “Here Comes the Sun” with a piercingly loud acoustic guitar. “This,” said McCluskey, as we took our pints of Guinness and sought shelter inside an archway, “is what we were trying to save the world from.”\n\nJust across the road is another bar with a claim to musical history, a dismal spot called Eric’s, where McCluskey and Humphreys performed for the first time, in 1978, as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The headliner was an unknown group from nearby Manchester called Joy Division. McCluskey played bass; Humphreys was on synthesizer. The third member of the band was a tape player loaded with backing tracks, whom they called Winston.\n\nThough Liverpool of that era had many bands that became legends — Echo and the Bunnymen, the Teardrop Explodes — there wasn’t another one remotely like O.M.D. Inspired by the German group Kraftwerk, they played electronic music. They were oddballs, freaks.\n\nThirty-five years later, O.M.D. still doesn’t quite fit in. The genre they helped invent — file under “synth pop” — proved hugely popular through the 1980s but tended to be dismissed unfairly as a hollow, MTV-era fad. Making a comeback at this stage of their lives is about correcting that perception. But there’s something else, too. The day after our outing in Liverpool, McCluskey showed me around his large, elegant house, pausing outside the bedrooms of his two children, empty since the year before last, when his estranged wife moved with them to her native San Diego. Getting back to O.M.D., and the easy compatibility he once shared with Humphreys, is part of another, more personal reclamation project.\n\nGrowing up in a suburban village on the Wirral Peninsula, McCluskey and Humphreys, who are both 53, bonded over their shared revulsion of the ’70s-era macho guitar rock their friends adored. They conducted sound experiments in Humphreys’s mother’s small house, using homemade instruments like the “tuba phone,” a five-foot-long cardboard cylinder with a microphone on one end. McCluskey owned a bass but barely knew how to play it. He was right-handed, but it was a left-handed model, because that one had been cheaper, so he played it upside down. Humphreys had electronic devices that he took apart and reassembled into things that made noise. Eventually he saved up enough to buy a synthesizer from a catalog his mother received in the mail.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
