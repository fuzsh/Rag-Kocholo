        "text": "Randall Deaton had the idea of recasting Bob Seger songs in a bluegrass style many years ago — during the late 2000s, in fact, when he was working with artists such as Ralph Stanley II and the band Blue Moon Rising.\n\n“Ralph II did a song by Elton John called ‘Georgia,’ Blue Moon Rising did a Bruce Springsteen song called ‘Youngstown,’ and those went over really well,” says Deaton, a producer and audio engineer who started the Lonesome Day Records label back in 2002. “I’m a big Bob Seger fan — who isn’t? — and I started to think, ‘Wouldn’t you like to hear ‘Hollywood Nights’ in bluegrass style?’\n\n“So it’s an idea that was floating around a little while. Finally, around 2012, I said: ‘I’m gonna try it. I’m gonna put some arrangements together’ and I had some players and we got started.”\n\nAnd while it took a dozen years — analogous to the long process the Detroit rock hero often took in making his own albums — “Silver Bullet Bluegrass: An All-Star Tribute to Bob Seger” is set to come out July 12.\n\nThe set features 13 Seger songs, recorded at studios in Booneville, Kentucky, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where Seger made his “Beautiful Loser” album and worked on parts of the subsequent “Night Moves,” “Stranger in Town” and “Against the Wind” releases. “Silver Bullet Bluegrass” features vocalists such as “American Idol” runner-up Bo Bice performing “Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man,” former Drive-By Truckers member Shonna Tucker singing “Hollywood Nights,” the Steeldrivers’ Gary Nichols taking on “Turn the Page,” “The Voice” finalist Carson Peters delivering “Long Twin Silver Line” and more.\n\nThe album is fortified by a corps of first-call players, including Nichols on guitar and Peters on fiddle, as well as highly credentialed musicians such as Larry Cordle, Richard Bennett, Shawn Brock, Tim Crouch, Megan Lynch, Tammy Rogers, Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section alumnus David Hood on bass and many others.\n\n“They’re just good songs — I don’t know any other way than that to describe ’em,” says Deaton, who also owns and operates the Lake Fanny Hooe Resort and Campground in Copper Harbor on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula — a business he came across when a family driving trip to California followed the route taken by Seger in his song “Roll Me Away,” covered on the album by Bill Taylor.\n\n“I think that’s why they transpose to bluegrass so well,” Deaton continues. “It goes back to that whole three chords and the truth. These songs are just so comfortable in the melodies; you can sit down and play ’em with a guitar, just by yourself, and they sound good. If you’re at a restaurant or a ballgame and a Bob Seger song comes on, it just makes you feel good.”\n\nAfter some initial sessions — “Main Street” with Josh Shilling was the first track recorded — Deaton put the “Silver Bullet Bluegrass” project aside for a number of reasons, including his own burn-out within the music industry and the demands of running the resort. During a chance meeting with Nichols at a festival in Kentucky, however, the singer suggested Deaton do some work in Muscle Shoals and introduced him to recording engineer Jimmy Nutt, whose The NuttHouse Recording Studio became a home for the sessions.\n\nhttps://www.theoaklandpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/09-Main-Street.mp3\n\nIt was Nutt who also brought David Hood into the album to play on “Night Moves,” connecting the tribute to Seger’s best-selling recordings.\n\n“Finally in 2002, I got with Jimmy and I said, ‘What do you think up finishing up this record?'” Deaton recalls. “He said, ‘Yeah, alright, let’s do it.’ We had it about 90 percent done … and they were just too good to keep hidden anymore. We had a couple tracks to still get vocals on, so we started working on it. I went down to Jimmy’s studio in February of 2023 with Carson Peters and started the process of wrapping it up, and here we are now.”\n\nWhile the recordings stay melodically faithful to Seger’s originals, Deaton enjoyed the opportunity to use the instrumentation to take the song in different directions. “Betty Lou’s Getting’ Out Tonight,” for instance, gets a honky tonk treatment behind Ward Hayden’s vocals, while “You’ll Accomp’ny Me” is more upbeat, with a two-step flavor. Fiddle substitutes for the original guitar lick on “Main Street,” and dobro subs for saxophone on “Turn the Page.”\n\n“One of the harder songs to pull off, I thought, was ‘We’ve Got Tonite,'” Deaton says of the elegiac, emotionally complex ballad that was a Top 15 hit for Seger in 1978. “It relies so much on the vocal. It’s definitely out of the norm for your typical bluegrass ensemble. It still has your typical acoustic guitar, mandolin, banjo, upright bass and fiddle, but it had to bring the same kind of support as you’d get with orchestrations for a big power ballad kind of thing. It was tricky.”\n\nDeaton and company did record one other song, a rendition of “The Answer’s The Question” from his 2006 album “Face the Promise,” but ultimately, Deaton said, “it didn’t hit me like it was gonna work out.”\n\nDeaton obtained all the necessary licenses for “Silver Bullet Bluegrass,” but has had no contact with the Seger camp during the process. He knows some Nashville players who have worked with Seger over the years, including Jim “Moose” Brown from the final Silver Bullet Band roster, but the connections have been indirect, and Deaton notes he’s “never crossed paths with any of the Seger guys.”\n\nBut he’s still happy to be putting some more Seger music into the world while its creator has been largely out of sight since his final concert on Nov. 1, 2019.\n\n“My roots are country, but I think (Seger) crosses over a lot of genres,” Deaton says. “It’s timeless music, timeless songs. This is just putting them in a different kind of setting that I think works really well. I’m really proud of it, and … I hope if he hears it, he’ll like it, too.”"
