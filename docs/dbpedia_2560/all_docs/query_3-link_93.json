        "text": "Authenticity in this context refers to the honest, unfiltered portrayal of student experiences and stories. It means moving away from scripted narratives and turning towards the real experiences of students— their achievements, challenges, hopes, and dreams.\n\nAs we navigate the digital age, leveraging the power of authentic student voices is becoming increasingly vital. Student stories, replete with personal experiences and aspirations, can bridge the gap between the institution and potential donors, offering a genuine glimpse into the lives that their contributions can impact.\n\nA study by Cohn & Wolfe showed that authenticity is one of the top qualities that attract modern consumers to a brand. In higher education, institutions are the brands, and students are the ambassadors. Harnessing authentic student voices can create a genuine brand image with which potential donors connect.\n\nTHE POWER OF AUTHENTIC STUDENT STORIES: A STONEHILL COLLEGE EXAMPLE\n\nStephen Cobbs, a senior at Stonehill College, provides a compelling testament to the power of authentic student stories. A budding athlete since childhood, his dreams of playing Division I football seemed to shatter when he suffered a significant hip injury.\n\nDespite doctors’ devastating news about his uncertain future in sports, Stephen didn’t lose hope. His journey of recovery, underpinned by unwavering support from his physical therapist Kayla and the Stonehill College coaches and faculty, showcased his resilience and determination.\n\nHis story goes beyond just his athletic journey. It paints a holistic picture of Stephen, showcasing him as a student-athlete striving to break the stereotype often attached to the label. He embodies the student body at Stonehill College - diverse in interests, engaged in their community, and striving for personal and academic growth. Stephen’s narrative conveys more than any scripted appeal could. His thoughts and words help us understand the heart of a student-athlete at Stonehill College, his challenges, his perseverance, and the college’s impact on his life.\n\nTHE IMPACT OF AUTHENTIC STUDENT STORIES\n\nReal student stories like Stephen’s can profoundly impact potential donors. They provide a human face and a personal narrative of a cause, making the donation appeal more compelling. Authentic stories allow donors to see the direct impact of their contributions, making the experience much more rewarding and personal for them.\n\nWhen donors hear authentic student stories, they’re not just being asked to donate; they’re invited to become a part of a student’s journey. This direct and personal appeal fosters a deeper connection between the donor and the institution, which, in turn, can lead to increased engagement.\n\nAUTHENTICITY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n\nIn the digital age, where we are exposed to countless marketing messages daily, authenticity stands out. Although many try, it’s not something somebody can manufacture; when done correctly, exploring real student experiences and stories will act as a beacon, drawing in those looking for something real, something they can trust. And in higher education marketing and development, this is more crucial than ever.\n\nIn essence, authenticity isn’t just a trend or a buzzword - it’s a powerful force that can shape the future of higher education marketing and development. As demonstrated by students like Stephen, authentic voices paint a more accurate and honest picture of student life and resonate more deeply with potential donors by giving a much more personal and rewarding experience.\n\nLinks\n\nStonehill College\n\nStonehill College YouTube\n\nStonehill Twitter\n\nDevlo Media\n\nthe analog heritage of sound recording\n\nIn a world of digital audio recordings, it is easy to forget the analog heritage of sound recording. Reel-to-reel audio recorders, also known as tape recorders, were once the standard for capturing and preserving sound. One of the most iconic and highly regarded models of reel-to-reel recorders was the Nagra III.\n\nThe Nagra III was produced by the Swiss company Kudelski SA and was introduced in the late 1950s. It was known for its compact size, durability, and high-quality sound recordings. The Nagra III was used by professionals in various fields, including film, television, and music production. Journalists who used the recorder appreciated its portability and dependability in the field.\n\nThe Nagra III was designed with simplicity in mind, and it was easy to operate. It featured a basic control panel with knobs for adjusting levels, speeds, and playback direction. The recorder was powered by a battery and could run on a single charge for several hours, making it ideal for field recordings. The Nagra III was also designed to be rugged and encased in a metal housing that protected it from damage.\n\nThe sound quality of the Nagra III was its defining characteristic, and it remains one of the most sought-after reel-to-reel recorders to this day. The recorder's circuitry was designed to provide a low-noise, high-fidelity signal. It produced a warm, natural sound free from the harshness and distortion often found in other reel-to-reel recorders. The Nagra III was also known for its low wow and flutter, which helped preserve the recordings' accuracy.\n\nDespite the advent of digital recording technology, the Nagra III remains a popular choice for audio enthusiasts and professionals. It is a testament to the quality of the design and construction of the Nagra III that so many of these recorders are still in use today, more than 60 years after they were first introduced.\n\na place in popular culture\n\nThe Nagra III also has a place in popular culture. It was prominently featured in the 1981 Brian De Palma movie \"Blow Out.\" In the film, John Travolta plays a sound technician who uses a Nagra III to record audio that provides crucial evidence in a political conspiracy. The film highlights the versatility and reliability of the Nagra III, which has helped increase the recorder's cultural visibility.\n\nThe use of Nagra III in \"Blow Out\" also speaks to the enduring appeal of analog recording technology. Despite the convenience and affordability of digital recording equipment, there is still a demand for the warm, natural sound that analog equipment provides. The Nagra III is a reminder of this. It continues to be a popular choice for recording enthusiasts and professionals who appreciate the sound quality and tactile experience of analog recording.\n\nThe long days and mild weather make it the perfect time to capture the country's stunning landscapes and natural wonders.\n\nOne of the best photography opportunities in Iceland is at the Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon, where you can capture the floating ice chunks and the blue-white ice against the dark, dramatic background. The black sand beach at Reynisfjara is another great spot, where you can photograph the unique basalt columns and the powerful waves crashing against the shore. The nearby Dyrholaey peninsula offers a panoramic view of the black sand beach and the Reynisdrangar sea stacks.\n\nAnother great spot for photography is the Seljalandsfoss waterfall, where you can walk behind the waterfall and capture the cascading water and the rainbow that forms in the mist. Skógafoss waterfall is another great spot, where you can photograph the powerful waterfall and the lush greenery that surrounds it.\n\nThe Northern Lights are another spectacular photography opportunity. Iceland is one of the best places in the world to see the aurora borealis, and September is a great time to witness this natural wonder.\n\nIn addition to natural landscapes, Iceland also offers plenty of opportunities to photograph the country's unique culture and architecture. The colorful buildings in Reykjavik and the charming towns and villages that dot the island are perfect for capturing the essence of Iceland.\n\nOverall, Iceland in September offers endless opportunities for photography enthusiasts. With its stunning landscapes, natural wonders, and unique culture, Iceland is a photographer's dream destination.\n\nTravel Notes:\n\nDriving\n\nWhile Iceland is a small country, its rugged terrain and unpredictable weather conditions can make it difficult to access certain areas. Therefore, when planning a self-directed tour of Iceland, it's important to consider the type of vehicle you will need to rent.\n\nA four-wheel drive SUV is highly recommended for exploring the secondary roads in Iceland. This is because many of the roads, especially those leading to the country's natural attractions, are unpaved and can be quite rough. A four-wheel drive vehicle will allow you to navigate these roads with ease and safely reach some of the most remote and beautiful areas of Iceland.\n\nAdditionally, renting a four-wheel drive SUV will give you the freedom to explore Iceland off the beaten path and discover hidden gems that you might miss otherwise.\n\nIt's important to note that it can be more expensive to rent a four-wheel drive SUV, but it's worth the investment to ensure that you can access all the amazing places that Iceland has to offer.\n\nWhen renting a car, also make sure to get full insurance and check the terms and conditions of your rental agreement, as some rental companies do not permit their cars to be driven on certain roads. Be sure to inform the rental company of your plans and ask for their recommendation on the type of car you should rent.\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore you go make sure to order one of these maps from INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER - a publishing house specializing in travel and photography.\n\nhttps://international-photographer.com/en/product/map-iceland-v5/\n\n“The Iceland map brings together essential road information, a detailed description of all the areas of interest ( volcanoes, waterfalls, lighthouses, monuments, fauna, flora and curiosities …) as well as as national parks and nature reserves. But it goes way beyond!”\n\nOn a recent trip to NYC, I happened to find myself in a conversation with a gentleman from Eritrea. I mentioned that although I hadn’t been to the Eritrea, I was very close in Ethiopia - about 30 miles from the border in the Shimelba Refugee Camp. As soon as I mentioned Shimelba, he immediately shut me down declaring “It’s fake.” I thought he misunderstood what I said so I politely replied, “What do you mean, fake? The Shimelba Refugee Camp?” He said, “Yes, yes. It’s fake.” I replied, “No, I was actually in the camp for several days on a project.” He again lectured me that it’s was a hoax - “…Shimelba is a lie perpetrated by Ethiopia to embarrass Eritrea.” Again, I tried to explain, “No, I actually followed a group of Kunama refugees from Shimelba to Rhode Island...” Again he dismissed, “Kunama are just traitors and work with Ethiopia, Shimelba is a lie...”\n\nI politely left the conversation and moved on, trying to wrap my head around what just happened. Unfortunately, I can understand where the gentleman’s misinformation tirade comes from. According to Human Rights Watch, the Eritrean government's human rights record is among the worst in the world. Eritrea has had no national elections, no legislature, independent press, or independent civil society organizations since 2001. Religious freedom is severely curtailed. A United Nations Commission of Inquiry in 2016 found the government manifested “wholesale disregard for the liberty” of its citizens. In 2018, a United Nations Special Rapporteur reported that human rights violations “continue unabated.\n\nIn 2006, I directed and produced the documentary “Home Across Lands,” which follows a family of Kunama refugees who had fled Eritrea and sought refuge in The Shimelba Refugee Camp in Northern Ethiopia and their subsequent resettlement to the US. As a documentary filmmaker, we have the great privilege and honor to enter peoples lives and gather their stories. To be able to tell their story is both humbling and horrifying at the same time. There’s a huge amount of responsibility to be authentic, to be real, and to be objective. Objectivity is the key - it’s that guiding principle that every decision I make has to abide by.\n\nThis recent conversation (or angry lecture) brought my mind back to that story and I started searching for more information. I found that the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea signed an agreement on July 9th, 2018, to restore diplomatic relations, as well as reopen embassies in Addis Ababa and Asmara, and resume flights between the two countries. But, what about the camp - is it still there?\n\nMy answers are unfortunately what I thought they would be. The camp is still there: https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/62695 The conditions and problems persist: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/healing-hidden-wounds-eritrean-refugees-ethiopia and the refugee story is still the same. It’s not fake, its real. Real people’s lives. It’s real people and it’s real families."
