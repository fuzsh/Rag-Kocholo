        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\n\nNovember 8, 2023\n\nMedia Contact: Aaron Pelo, apelo@miaflcio.org | 734.355.2741\n\nLabor-Backed Candidates Win Big In Local Elections Across Michigan\n\nLANSING, Mich. – Labor-backed candidates for local office saw huge success on election night, winning Mayor, city council, and other municipal seats across Michigan. More than 75% of the candidates endorsed by local AFL-CIO bodies won their elections Tuesday night.\n\n“Fighting for workers’ rights continues to be a winning message up and down the ballot,” said Michigan AFL-CIO President Ron BIEBER. “Michigan voters could not be more clear that they want their elected officials at all levels of government to put workers first, and pass policies that strengthen wages, create good-paying union jobs, and empower collective bargaining rights in the workplace. Voters are looking to their local governments to deliver for working people and partner with our pro-worker majorities in Lansing to get things done at all levels of government. Tonight’s victories in local races should send a clear message that labor is stronger than ever.”\n\nIn Warren, Angela Rogensues was re-elected to City Council At-Large. She will serve in a new pro-labor majority on City Council along with Mayor-elect Lori Stone, whose race also received strong support from labor and the endorsement of the Metro-Detroit AFL-CIO.\n\n“This victory is shared with the working men and women of the Michigan AFL-CIO and the tremendous effort put forth to re-elect pro-labor candidates,” said ROGENSUES. “I have never been more proud to serve the community, union members, and the residents of Warren.”\n\nIn September, Rongesues was selected as the Michigan AFL-CIO’s Local Legislator of the Year in recognition of her work on Warren City Council to deliver for workers, promote good-paying union jobs, and empower the labor movement at the local level.\n\nLabor-backed candidate Spencer Calhoun also won his race for Mount Clemens City Commission Tuesday. Calhoun, who came to Mount Clemens as a homeless teen, will be one of the first openly LGBTQ+ elected officials in Macomb County. Calhoun is an Organizing Specialist at the Michigan AFL-CIO and has spent years as an activist, political organizer, and champion of the labor movement.\n\n“I’m thankful for the trust voters placed in me to serve them as City Commissioner,” said CALHOUN. “Our city has needed fresh leadership to face the challenges and growth that lie ahead for our community. Yesterday was a testament to the power of a positive and common-sense approach to local government. As a young person and a union member, I’m excited to see a future for our community that supports the middle class and uplifts our residents. The future looks bright for Mount Clemens.”\n\nIn Westland, State Representative Kevin Coleman was elected Mayor in a landslide victory, and in Trenton, Mayor Steve Rzeppa was handily reelected. Both Mayoral candidates received the endorsement of the Metro-Detroit AFL-CIO.\n\nPro-labor candidates won big in Monroe, with Mike Hayter and Andrew Felder winning their City Council races and incumbent Michelle Lavoy getting reelected by a wide margin. Burton Mayor Duane Haskins was reelected, a victory for the labor movement in Greater Flint, and in Jackson, voters chose Daniel Mahoney to serve another term as Mayor and elected Conner Wood to represent Ward 4 on City Council. Each of these candidates received an endorsement from their local AFL-CIO body.\n\nThe Michigan AFL-CIO, Michigan’s largest labor organization, is a federation representing forty different labor organizations, eighteen different central labor councils, and eight constituency groups representing over 1 million union members and their families.\n\n###"
