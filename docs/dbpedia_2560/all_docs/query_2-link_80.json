        "text": "WE WERE ARAB at home, mostly, and American in public. On weekends, Arabic music and the scents of cumin and sumac spilled through the windows in our otherwise sedate neighborhood in Syracuse, N.Y. Dad’s dinner parties were outsize, like his cooking, everything studded with garlic and bedded in great piles of rice: mujadara, maqluba, stuffed grape leaves and the most important Jordanian dish, mansaf, named for the big platter upon which it’s served. Ours covered the center of the dining room table. My youngest sister could have gone sledding with it. The bigger the mansaf, the more generous the host.\n\nMy Jordanian auntie was of the firm opinion that there was to be bread at the base, a paper-fine version, sometimes called shrak. But when I was a kid in the 1960s and ’70s, my parents lined their serving trays with slices of Wonder Bread, which was then heaped with the dish’s most memorable component: rice. (Uncle Ben’s, not basmati, but still lofty and tender, the ideal backdrop.) Next came the boiled lamb in an oniony yogurt sauce — sometimes made of dried yogurt balls called jameed, which were heated very gently and then stirred slowly for hours; as my auntie used to say, the sauce would curdle if you had even the wrong thoughts in your head. And then, to finish, toasted pine nuts or almonds. The sauce binds the meat, rice and bread, lending a tangy, creamy, nearly buttery flavor to a gleaming, seductive dish, made for daylong gatherings of eating and visiting.\n\nI haven’t made mansaf, not once, in nine years. Not since Dad passed away. Lush and heavy and rich and fatty, the dish is perfect for leading a string of camels from Saudi Arabia to Syria in the 17th century, but not for contemporary life parked at a computer. It’s too much work, too much hosting. Who has hours to sweat over a stove, stirring oneself into hypnosis? Back then, my parents and their friends seemed to have actual free time. Now, we book in advance, throwing dinner parties that are simple and fast, or even sometimes outsourced, so we can all get back to work.\n\nMy daughter, Grace, will turn 13 this year. She doesn’t remember the taste of her jiddo’s mansaf. His cooking and storytelling were central to his identity, and I want her to know who he was. I begin to wonder if there wasn’t some restaurant version that she and my husband, Scott, could share with me that might conjure the dish of my childhood. I hesitate, afraid it will be a disappointment, afraid that there is something too personal about mansaf, something that requires it be made at home or not at all.\n\nT’s Winter Travel Issue\n\nA trip around the world through the lens of a vital grain.\n\n- Tracing Mexico’s history through its ambivalent relationship to rice, a staple inextricable from colonialism.\n\n- When scorched on the bottom of the pot by a skilled cook, rice transforms from bland supporting actor to rich, complex protagonist.\n\n- Mansaf, a Bedouin dish of lamb and rice, is both a national symbol in Jordan and a talisman of home for suburban Detroit’s Arab American diaspora.\n\n- Senegal, which consumes more rice per capita, most of it imported, than almost any other African nation, is attempting to resuscitate homegrown varieties.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
