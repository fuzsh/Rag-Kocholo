\r\n\tMichigan's western Upper Peninsula (UP) is home to the nation's largest concentration of Finnish Americans and is locally referred to as "the sauna belt." Art Moilanen is the dean of Finnish-American piano accordionists in this region.

\r\n\t

\r\n\tArt Moilanen (1916-2005) has lived in Mass City most of his life. He has been a logger and tavern keeper, while all the time playing the accordion. He began to "fool around" with his brother's accordion in 1930 and to imitate what he had been hearing from first-generation Finnish-American farmers and lumberjacks, and he "picked up alotta these Finn songs from a record that we had on an old phonograph at home." (1) He has been playing ever since. His musical repertoire embraces Finnish-American, country western, and regional dance tunes, reflecting influence of other local ethnic musics, the media, and the UP environment. Two significant influences were Viola Turpeinen, an accordionist and icon in Finnish-American culture, and Frankie Yankovic, "the Polka King." Because of Viola Turpeinen, Art acquired a piano accordion and learned her style and her songs, which he still plays even today. Art also plays "a pretty good polka," some of which he attributes to Frankie Yankovic. One of Art's specialties is parodies of pop songs in English. The lyrics are UP or Finnish-American specific and often are about locals; they are expressions of regional values and attitudes or Art's assessment of situations. Art is something of a cultural mediator, communicating both Finnish-American and UP culture values and history to outsiders through the medium of his songs.

\r\n\t

\r\n\tArt's musicianship has been acknowledged by many. He received Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship awards in 1991 and 1992 to teach piano accordion and Finnish-American music. He has played at music festivals throughout the Great Lakes region and in Finland, for ethnic dances in the region, at local bars, and has participated in music and cultural conservation workshops. In 1987 he participated in the Smithsonian Institute's American Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C. and the Festival of Michigan Folklife in East Lansing. He has been featured on recordings of traditional music of the Upper Peninsula by James Leary and in the film Tradition Bearers (1983) by Michael Loukinen. In 1990 Art received the prestigious National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. Although retired but still playing, Art says, "After 70 years of music, why quit now!"

With both parents calling and playing at local house parties and square dances, William has spent his life in the Grange, with its music and traditions dear to him. His repertoire includes older, traditional tunes as well as some newer tunes, in keeping with the changing tastes of the audience.

\r\n

\r\nIn the 1970s, the Tag-A-Longs trio was formed in Charlevoix, which included William as a founding member. At that time, the group won the talent competition at the National Grange Convention, and William went on to win numerous talent competitions at State Grange. As the house band for the Barnard Grange, the Tag-A-Longs and "Mr. Music" or "The Music Man," as William is called in Grange circles, continue the tradition of Grange Hall square and round dances. Barnard Grange, one of the largest in the state, is unique in that it is one of the few that still regularly put on old-time square dances. It is more common to have a DJ or more contemporary band play at Grange dances. These dances are not just for the Grange, but also for the whole community.

\r\n

\r\nUnder William's leadership, the group plays a key civic role, engaging in the many voluntary charitable and community service activities for which the Grange is known. The Tag-A-Longs maintain an active schedule of Grange Hall dances and fundraisers, barn dances, nursing home performances, antique tractor shows, fiddlers' jamborees, and local festival appearances.

\r\n

\r\nOne of William's greatest contributions to the perpetuation of Grange music and dance is his encouragement of others. He is instrumental in keeping dance callers and musicians involved in the tradition. Bringing the older and experienced together with the younger generation, he readily steps aside to feature others.

\r\n

\r\nWilliam is well known throughout the region for his dedication to the continuance of Grange music and traditions. His leadership as a prime mover and fine musician and vocalist has helped to make Barnard Grange the center of Grange music and dance in Michigan.","Display":"True","Tradition":["grange hall musician"],"Collections Associator":["A2-33F-2E"],"Image":["A2-373-14A"],"Author":"","Date":"","MTAAP Associator":"","Exhibit Associator":"","Audio":"","Video":""},"A2-369-31":{"kid":"A2-369-31","pid":162,"schemeID":"873","linkers":["A2-368-26","A2-368-CC","A2-368-D5","A2-368-74"],"systimestamp":"2019-11-08T17:45:21-05:00","recordowner":"micahling","Awardee_Name":["Lula Williams"],"Year":"1997 awardee","Awardee_City":["Detroit"],"Awardee_County":["Wayne County"],"Essay":"As a young child, Lula Williams (b. 1925) occasionally helped her mother with her quilting by putting colors together and piecing. However, she only returned to quilting in the early 1980s when her 13-year-old son encouraged her to take a course in it at his school; she remembered her mother's techniques almost immediately and has been quilting ever since.

\r\n

\r\nLula has made more than 120 quilts and won numerous awards. Her work reflects many traditions within her experiences. She is a needleworker keenly interested in the latest techniques and patterns; she is an African American committed to conveying information about her heritage; she is a woman of faith who communicates her beliefs through her quilts; she is an individual proud of being an American. One series of her quilts incorporates African cloth, paying homage to Martin Luther King, Jr. Another series is of red, white, and blue cloth with designs of stars and stripes. A special quilt, her original "I Am" design, depicts the several times Jesus utters "I am" in the Bible as well as the declarations of "I am" by African-American preachers in their sermons. She is perhaps best known for her baby quilts, of which she has made scores as gifts for family and friends.

\r\n

\r\nLula's excellent craftsmanship has won her a number of awards and invitations to participate in shows within the African-American community and beyond. In addition she has taught quilting for a number of years at the Evans Recreation Center on Detroit's northeast side, at the Michigan State Fair Senior Center, and at Detroit's westside Tindal Recreation Center and readily assists those who seek her help. She also has been recognized with awards of Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship grants to teach her skills to other aspiring quilters in her community.

In 1935, Paul began an apprenticeship with Frank Havens in the building of timber-frame barns. The skills and knowledge to build most of our rural vernacular architecture were passed on from generation to generation through such informal apprenticeships. Young men, working with fathers, uncles, or neighbors, learned a skill to be carried into the future to serve the next generation. This chain of learning began to weaken in the nineteenth century and came to a virtual halt in the early twentieth century. Changes in our society, agricultural practices, and technology made the construction of the time-honored timber-frame barns obsolete.

\r\n

\r\nOnly a few remain who apprenticed during the time when the last timber-frame barns were built in the 1930s and who continued in that line of work throughout their lifetime. Paul continues to be a student of barns, knowing that by keeping an open mind he will continue to help refine and improve techniques that might make a difference in restoring or adapting timber-frame structures today. He has brought young people into this line of work and taught them and is delighted at the increasing interest in rural preservation as it draws attention to farm structures, advocates adapting and reusing barns, and keeps them on the landscape.

\r\n

\r\nPaul is especially notable because of his preservationist ethic and his role in the movement to keep timber framing skills and knowledge alive. Throughout his career, he has taught builders and barn owners about timber framing and continues to share his experiences and knowledge with others. As a "student of barns," he refines methods and techniques to preserve and reuse more of the existing timber barns throughout the state. His efforts have helped to call attention to these noble structures. Increasingly owners are encouraged to repair their barns and rural buildings, and young builders and contractors look to him for direction.

\r\n

\r\nFor a lifetime as master timber framer, teacher, and preservationist, Paul plays an exemplary role maintaining the traditional farmstead and rural landscape of Michigan and holds a special place in Michigan architectural history.","Display":"True","Tradition":["timber-frame barn builder and restorer"],"Collections Associator":["A2-33F-2E"],"Image":["A2-373-149"],"Author":"","Date":"","MTAAP Associator":"","Exhibit Associator":"","Audio":"","Video":""},"A2-369-33":{"kid":"A2-369-33","pid":162,"schemeID":"873","linkers":[],"systimestamp":"2019-11-08T17:53:50-05:00","recordowner":"micahling","Awardee_Name":["Bob Summers"],"Year":"1998 awardee","Awardee_City":["Traverse City"],"Awardee_County":["Grand Traverse County"],"Essay":"Bob Summers, born 1938, constructed his first fly-fishing rod at the age of 16. He has since perfected the craft and become known throughout Michigan and other parts of the country as the foremost maker of tonkin cane (bamboo) fly-fishing rods.

\r\n

\r\nBob believes fly fishing "puts you in a state of mind." (1) He began fishing when he was seven years old and owned his first fly rod at the age of ten. Later, he was employed with the Paul Young Company in Detroit, a business known for its tackle and rods. Here he learned his exceptional skill of making bamboo fly-fishing rods. His rods, along with those of others, were featured in the exhibit Caught on the Fly: Fly Fishing Traditions in Michigan at the MSU Museum.

\r\n

\r\nA characteristic that makes Bob's rods unique is that virtually every component is made from scratch, including the case. His materials include cork, metals, and tonkin cane. He has even assembled a variety of metal presses and other mechanical tools to assist him in his creations.

\r\n

\r\nIn 1956, Bob moved to Traverse City and began his own rod-making business. His fly rods are in demand all over the world and are considered collectors' items as well as cherished equipment; these handcrafted objects are so appealing that there is a waiting period of years rather than months when ordered. The name "Bob Summers" is constantly mentioned when the subject of bamboo fly rods is discussed in the fly-fishing community.

\r\n

\r\nBob strives to maintain the importance of the bamboo rod amidst the fiberglass and other synthetic rods. One of his methods is teaching his skill to others. His pupils, many of whom are scattered throughout Michigan, regard him as an "exciting and skilled artist and technician." (2) His efforts to maintain and preserve the tradition of tonkin cane rod making, coupled with his superior skill in crafting it, have earned him recognition as one of Michigan's finest makers of bamboo fly-fishing rods.

She has been described by fellow tribal members as "a sensitive, caring person who sees and responds to the needs of the community." (1) Despite physical limitations, Lois has dedicated her life to the health and education of others within her community, reaching out, whenever possible, to those outside of the tribal community.

\r\n

\r\nA dominant member of the Ojibwa Senior Citizens, she helped the group implement a meal program for senior citizens and raise money for the operation of a private building. Her efforts to recruit tribal elders as bereavement volunteers were also successful.

\r\n

\r\nLois's sensitive persona was a priceless asset to her position at a local hospital nursery. She not only contributed to her family's needs, but also made the Native Americans feel as though they had a friend amidst the hospital staff. Fellow nurses considered her a valuable resource in transcultural issues involving health care.

\r\n

\r\nA storyteller, Lois educates the community about Ojibwa methods of hunting and fishing, food preparation, history, and traditions in her column in Ojibwa News, the tribe's monthly newsletter. She also volunteers a column for the community's monthly health department newsletter; her writings use conventional tribal teaching to address health problems in contemporary society.

\r\n

\r\nLois's activities extend not only to the adults of the community, but to the youth as well. Serving as storyteller in summer youth programs held at her home and donating time to a group home for severely troubled children are just a few of the ways she reaches the younger generation.

Anna relocated to the Lansing area in the late 1940s and is currently on the board of Nokomis Learning Center in Okemos.

\r\n

\r\nAnna learned basketmaking primarily from her parents, Michael and Eliza Jane Peters Neyome; Eliza learned in turn from her mother and grandmother who were also basketmakers. Because the children in the Neyome home grew up watching their parents make baskets, Anna and "all my brothers and sisters all knew how to do basket weaving. And the women that my brothers married, they also learned from my mother." (1)

\r\n

\r\nAnna spends much of her time demonstrating the art of black ash basketweaving. In her teaching, she practices the same techniques and styles used by both her mother and grandmother. Three of her children make baskets, including Marclay who, with Anna, attended the 1997 Southwest Native Basketmakers Gathering in Arizona. For many years, Anna's husband, John, has assisted by pounding the ash and accompanying Anna to basketmaking events.

\r\n

\r\nAnna has worked hard to maintain Native American traditional arts, striving to locate new markets and strengthen the network of communication between artists. She was involved in the formation of the Great Lakes Indian Artists Association and in "Sisters of the Great Lakes," a project of the Nokomis Learning Center. She has been a participant in the Festival of Michigan Folklife, a master artist in the Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship Program, and a primary force in the first Great Lakes Basket and Quillbox Makers Gathering held August 1997, in East Lansing.

In many cultures, worshipers take blessed palm fronds home from the Palm Sunday service. Sometimes the fronds are braided or twisted into crosses, amulets, and other objects and given to family and friends who keep them until the next Palm Sunday.

\r\n

\r\nIn the Wenson family, palm braiding has developed into a treasured tradition. In the 1930s, Katherine Marie Hunzicker Wenson was asked by her church, the Blessed Sacrament Cathedral in Detroit, to braid palm fronds for each of the 10 to 12 celebrants of the Palm Sunday mass. She recruited her son Frederick ("Fritz"), then 13, to help. Until then, Kathrine Wenson had made small items braided from palm such as crosses and boxes for children to take as gifts to teachers and nuns at school. "My mom was never taught what she did with palms," Fritz remarked. "When she was in grade school the nuns taught a class on how to make little crosses with palms but nothing like what mom developed herself." (1)

\r\n

\r\nFritz's mother created large, elaborate floral-like bouquets from palm fronds. With Fritz she braided palm fronds for the archbishop of the greater Detroit Archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church, who carried them in the Palm Sunday procession. It soon became a family tradition for mother and son to compete in providing two separate palms from which the archbishop would choose. When Fritz's was finally chosen, he knew he had achieved greater mastery of the art. After arthritis restricted his mother's activity, Fritz continued the family tradition, eventually teaching his children. He and his son, Tony, who is most interested in braiding the palms, continue the intergenerational rivalry to see whose palm will be chosen by the archbishop. What started as a simple kindness toward the clergy by his mother has evolved to a deeply personal symbol of the Wenson family's commitment to their church and to each other.

The kantele is an ancient instrument in the zither family and regarded as the national instrument of Finland. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Finnish immigrants regarded the kantele as sacred. Tradition recalls its mythic origins, and the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, describes it played by legendary heroes. Although it is doubtful that immigrants brought the kantele with them when they left Finland, some had the knowledge and skills to make it once they arrived in this country. Until the last decades, however, only a limited few had mastered the kantele.

\r\n

\r\nAs a child in Pelkie, Melvin had his first encounter with the kantele through a local Finnish immigrant. Years later, he was one of the first Finnish Americans to study the kantele in Finland. For two years he studied with Ulla Katajavuori, one of the most respected kantele masters of the time. Melvin says, "You can study with someone for a certain period of time and then you need to learn on your own." (1) Melvin proceeded to do this, perfecting his skills and learning new music. After his return to Michigan, he became a music instructor at Suomi College (now Finlandia University), Hancock, where he teaches the large kantele privately and in classes to many enthusiastic Finnish Americans.

\r\n

\r\nMelvin has become a central figure in Finnish-American musical life. He performs at weddings, summer solstice celebrations, house parties, the Baraga County fair, and the Ottawa Sportsman's Club dinners. He plays a variety of songs, some traditional and some that he has arranged or composed for the kantele. For example, he often plays music that second-generation Finnish Americans heard in their childhood: humorous sauna songs, drinking songs, polkas and schottisches, lullabies, and religious pieces.

\r\n

\r\nThe kantele has been a focus of a Finnish-American cultural renaissance in the last decades. Melvin has played a major role in the spread of kantele music and the revival of kantele playing. Many musicians and teachers of Finnish descent have studied under his tutelage.

The club bowls at the Cadieux Cafe, which continues to be a center for Belgian-American gatherings and activities. The Cafe's large sign announces it is the "home of Belgian sports." Belgian (Flemish) feather bowling, pigeon racing, bike clubs, and traditional Belgian food have a strong presence here.

\r\n

\r\nFeather bowling entails rolling a wooden, cheese-shaped ball down the Cadieux's dirt-packed, curved alleys, getting as close as possible to pigeon feathers stuck upright in the dirt on either end. Each night of league play, the club members divide up randomly into teams according to their "class," which indicates their experience. Each team is ideally made up of three players, one from each class. After flipping a coin, the first team typically rolls the first two balls close to the feather, and then rolls the rest of their balls into places that serve as "blocks" to any other balls. The second team's players try to weave their balls in and out between the blocks or knock the blocks out of the way, with the final bowler attempting to gain a better position than the first team. A referee determines the score for each round. Rounds continue until one team reaches ten points. While the bowlers play, spouses socialize and restaurant patrons wander in to watch the action.

\r\n

\r\nFeather bowling and the Cadieux Cafe have come to symbolize Belgian identity for the Belgian-American community. The Cadieux Cafe Feather Bowling Club members' commitment to the traditional sport is a sign that feather bowling captures and expresses familial, ethnic, local, and global connections for Belgian-Americans in the Detroit area.

Bay Port's story is centered on fish and fishing, and one of the key persons in this story has been Henry Engelhard. He was "Mr. Bay Port." His entire life, until his death in 2001, was dedicated to the promotion of Bay Port and Bay Port fish.

\r\n

\r\nIn 1978 Henry and Edna Engelhard established the Bay Port Fish Sandwich Festival to attract visitors and friends to the town. They had been making and selling this very popular sandwich off and on since 1949. When the Bay Port Chamber of Commerce needed a fundraiser to promote Bay Port, Henry saw "the potential for the fish sandwich" with the boatloads of fish brought into the harbor daily.

\r\n

\r\nEvery August, the entire community comes together, presenting Bay Port and its attractions to visitors. The fish sandwich is the prime attraction. Mullet (herring was first used) is dipped in a secret batter, fried crisp, and served on a long bun with ketchup and mustard. Although not traditional, tartar sauce is also available. According to Henry, the fish should overlap the bun and the sandwich should be so large "it takes two hands to hold it." All day, the lines in front of the sandwich stand are long. It is not unusual to sell 12,500 sandwiches to people from as far away as Florida and the northeast.

\r\n

\r\nHenry was the festival's primary inspiration, energy, supporter, and promoter. He wrote many stories regaling the fish sandwiches' power to please and to heal. Through his efforts, the festival has been featured on the Today Show, 20\/20, and in many national magazines and newspapers. In recognition of their contribution to the Fish Sandwich Festival, Henry and Edna (she died in 1992) were honored as "Mr. and Mrs. Bay Port." Henry once said about the festival that it has been "the greatest thing for the town of Bay Port. What makes me happy . . .is we made use of an under-utilized species." (1)

Created by black slaves in America, metered hymns are tunes led by a deacon or preacher with a good voice who defines the tune by chanting the lines of the hymn, which is called lining out. His lines are repeated in harmony by the congregation. The notes were not written but remembered and passed from one generation to the next. Many of these tunes have been lost.

\r\n

\r\nDeacon Likely knew former slaves in his family near Evergreen, Alabama, who taught him metered hymn singing. His grandfather sang them as he farmed his land, and Deacon Likely recalled that the hymns drew others to the side of the road where impromptu church meetings evolved. His mother's tradition was to begin Christmas Day with a metered hymn rather than a holiday carol. By the age 16, Deacon Likely had become a metered hymn singer, too, and sang as he performed his farm chores.

\r\n

\r\nWhen he moved to Detroit, Deacon Likely discovered that in virtually every church at least one person could perform metered hymns. When he joined Hartford Church, his gift was discovered and older deacons often sent new or younger deacons to his home to learn the art of lining out a hymn. Deacon Likely was unique in his ability to remember hymn tunes and to teach them. Because of Deacon Likely, many on the Board of Deacons at Hartford are adept at lining out and combining the right lyric with the correct tune and meter.

\r\n

\r\nFor several years, Deacon Likely participated in the Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship Program as master teacher of several young deacons at Elyton Baptist Church. He also taught new generations of deacons in Pilgrim Baptist Church and instructed, inspired, and trained deacons of the Baptist churches in the Progressive National Baptist Convention to sing and lead metered hymns.","Display":"True","Tradition":["singer, leader, and teacher of lined out metered hymns"],"MTAAP Associator":["A2-368-31","A2-368-3A"],"Collections Associator":["A2-33F-2E"],"Image":["A2-373-3C","A2-373-3D"],"Author":"","Date":"","Exhibit Associator":"","Audio":"","Video":""},"A2-369-3B":{"kid":"A2-369-3B","pid":162,"schemeID":"873","linkers":["A2-368-6A"],"systimestamp":"2017-02-03T15:25:52-05:00","recordowner":"micahling","Awardee_Name":["Irene Vuorenmaa"],"Year":"2000 awardee","Awardee_City":["Ironwood"],"Awardee_County":["Gogebic County"],"Essay":"Ask about rag-rug weaving in Ironwood and chances are you will be directed to Irene Vuorenmaa, a master of this tradition. Born in 1935 in Kortesjarvi, Finland, Irene came to the United States in 1959 on a visit. She met her husband and has lived in Ironwood ever since.

\r\n

\r\nLike many Finnish girls, Irene learned to weave at a young age from her mother. She wove rugs, curtains, bedspreads, and tablecloths. At 15 she was selling her rugs. When she settled in the United States, she resumed weaving on a four-harness loom. In the early years of settlement, Finnish immigrants also wove a variety of textiles on four-harness looms. In a short period of time, however, they were weaving only rag rugs. Their four-harness looms were altered to two, because of the ease and speed this afforded. Today, Irene weaves with both four- and two-harnesses on a loom made by a Finnish immigrant almost 100 years ago. Her favorite pattern is "over the waves" which she learned in Finland.

\r\n

\r\nFor 27 years, Irene worked at a local nursing home. After work, she went home to her loom. "It was peaceful," she said, "to come home and do something else." She gets great pleasure from weaving, and she has helped many weavers get started. Irene's fame spread beyond the western Upper Peninsula when her family was featured in the documentary film Finnish American Lives by Michael Loukinen (1)and when she participated in the 1998 Smithsonian Folklife Festival.

\r\n

\r\nHonored for her masterful weaving of rags, Irene also has a widely known reputation as a keeper of many Finnish traditions. She teaches Finnish folk dances, excels in making traditional Finnish foods, actively participates at the local Finnish cultural center, sings in the Finnish chorus, and volunteers with 4-H youth. Ruth Olson of the Center for the Study of Upper Midwest Culture describes her as an articulate spokesperson for her culture. "Irene deserves . . .recognition not only because of her skill as a rag rug weaver but also because of her many other contributions to the preservation and continuing health of Finnish-American culture in the Upper Peninsula and northern Wisconsin."

Pysanky is a complex process of decorating eggs with the use of wax and colors. Under the supervision of her mother, an immigrant from the eastern Carpathian Mountains, Mary used straight pins to draw her designs. Only later did Mary acquire a stylus, which she taught herself to use, but she frequently still uses straight pins.

\r\n

\r\nConcerned with maintaining family and ethnic traditions, Mary has taught her children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and two daughters-in-law the art of pysanky. "I wanted all my children to be able to decorate eggs." She also goes into the schools to teach local children about pysanky. "I have taught people in the community for decades. Their names are too numerous to recall." (1)

\r\n

\r\nMary was commissioned to decorate an egg with a Michigan theme for an Easter egg display in 1998 in the White House. She applied icons imbued with Christian symbolism that also were characteristic of Michigan: white pine, deer, gulls, and fish. She also added the Mackinac Bridge, and cherries. This egg is now part of the White House permanent collection.

\r\n

\r\nIn Mary's family, pysanky were given as gifts to family and friends. Today Mary decorates eggs for every occasion and continues the tradition of giving pysanky. In 1999, for example, she decorated 24 Christmas eggs for her grandchildren; she gave each child of her church an egg at Easter in 2000; she presented Governor Engler a Michigan egg similar to that decorated for the White House display. Mary often donates eggs for fundraisers.

\r\n

\r\nWhen Mary and her husband, John, moved to Cedarville, they established Torsky's Resort. Although the resort now belongs to her son, Mary still keeps very busy. In addition to pysanky, she maintains her own home, including mowing her lawn, and runs a bed and breakfast; she bakes, cooks, makes wine, and arranges wreaths.

Her work with native peoples included studies of music and dance, based on fieldwork among the Iroquois in New York and Canada, the Central Algonquians (Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Muskouten, Sauk, Fox, Menominee, and Miami) in the Great Lakes region, Pueblo villages in New Mexico, and in Mexico. Her documents contain detailed accounts of dance movements and examination of dance as an expression of culture. Her studies of native dance established what is known today as dance ethnology.

\r\n

\r\nGertrude's incredible work with Michigan's native cultures is made even more valuable by her carefully compiled records on music, ritual, and dance that span four decades (1940s-1980s). These records preserve the cultural context and explanations of events with the voices of many native elders, sounds, diagrams, and films. In addition to numerous books, articles, comments, and reviews, there are field notes, tapes of field music recordings, LP recordings, colored and black-and-white film, photographs, slides, musical and choreographic transcriptions, and texts in sung and spoken native languages with English translations. Among her contributions are the Ethnic Folkways recording Songs and Dances of Great Lake Indians and the 1967 publication Michigan Indian Festivals, complete with photographs, diagrams, and musical transcriptions. A manuscript written with Jane and Fred Ettawageshik in the 1950s is being edited by Frank Ettawageshik for publication.

\r\n

\r\nThroughout her career, Gertrude continued her commitment to careful research and shared her results in ways that would benefit the most people, especially her native collaborators. In her works, interested native peoples can find voices of identified knowledgeable elders as critical resources about their cultural heritage. Gertrude's contributions have led to new, richer ways of understanding art in culture. The disciplines of ethnomusicology, anthropology, dance, and folklore would be poorer without her accomplishments.","Display":"True","Tradition":["documenter of Woodland Indian dance and culture","founder of the discipline of dance ethnology"],"Image":["A2-373-4A","A2-373-4B"],"Author":"","Date":"","MTAAP Associator":"","Collections Associator":"","Exhibit Associator":"","Audio":"","Video":""},"A2-369-3E":{"kid":"A2-369-3E","pid":162,"schemeID":"873","linkers":["A2-368-83"],"systimestamp":"2017-02-03T15:26:41-05:00","recordowner":"micahling","Awardee_Name":["Glen VanAntwerp"],"Year":"2001 awardee","Awardee_City":["Tustin"],"Awardee_County":["Osceola County"],"Essay":"Cedar-fan carving is an old and widespread tradition of using only a simple knife and a single block of cedar wood to create delicate fans. Immigrants from northern Europe first brought the technique to Michigan and other parts of the United States. Some of these immigrants worked as lumberjacks, and it was in the lumber camps, during long winter nights of storytelling and whittling, that the art of fan carving spread and developed.

\r\n

\r\nGlen VanAntwerp's connection with cedar fans begins with this lumber camp era. His great-great-grandfather settled in northern Michigan where, as a young man, he worked as a lumberjack. Later, Glen's grandfather, Elmer, was born in a lumber camp where his father was the foreman and his mother served as cook. As a young man, Elmer learned cedar fan carving from his relatives and other lumberjacks. He passed the skill on and Glen made his first cedar fan at the age of 12 in 1961, instructed by his grandfather, Elmer, and father, Stan.

\r\n

\r\nAbout those early years Glen wrote, "Each piece of wood I worked with was a new mystery. Locked within it were the flaws, colors, and grain patterns that would determine the fan's final appearance. . . [and be a] discovery of the wood's hidden beauty."(1) Now more than 40 years later he still derives great pleasure from his carving and has even developed some variations that the lumberjacks of long ago never dreamed of. Glen makes various types of small birds with outspread wings, fan-tailed peacocks and grouse, flying doves with fan-spread tails, and decorative fans with wooden handles.

\r\n

\r\nGlen lives near Cadillac on property that has been his family's for a century. He gets his white cedar from his own land, using dead or fallen trees and saving living ones for future generations. Some of his favorite wood is old cedar fence post, well seasoned, straight-grained, and hard.

\r\n

\r\nGlen has passed on his fascination for fan carving to his son, Jeremy, and his daughter, Sara, to whom he has taught both the stories and practice of cedar-fan carving. He also has taught numerous workshops around Michigan, demonstrating fan carving to neighbors, school children, and friends and educating them about the art nurtured in Michigan lumber camps. Glen has strengthened, preserved, and promoted this beautiful tradition by generating new interest in it through his instruction and demonstrations.

He has many stories to share about his years of fiddling, one of which is about learning to play. After two lessons, his instructor left. In 1919, Burn Devoe, then 94 years old and one of the best fiddlers in the county, agreed to stay with the family for two days and teach young Goog to play. And play he did. As Goog states, "I've been at it ever since." (1) He even helped feed his family during the Depression by playing at weekly square dances. In his early nineties, he is still an active musician, playing in church and at house parties, jamborees, dances, and community events such as sidewalk days and senior citizens' activities.

\r\n

\r\nGoog is credited as having perpetuated old-time music by sharing tunes he has played for years at old-time square and round dances. Many of his songs are local traditions; others he learned from his father who brought them home from the lumber camps where he worked at the beginning of the twentieth century. "Babes in the Woods," "Memories of Home," and "Silver Stream Waltz" are some of the songs credited to Goog.

\r\n

\r\nGoog has helped many people learn to play the fiddle, but he is especially credited with a lesson on keeping time when playing. "If you don't have timing, you have nothing," Goog often warns. (2)One of his fellow fiddlers claims that Goog can "still crank out a jig or a reel or a waltz with the best of them and still keep the right timing." (3)

\r\n

\r\nA fellow member of the Original Michigan Fiddlers Association stated that Goog "could play until the last dog dies, and then still have energy to play for the funeral. ...If he ever stops playing his music, he will leave a big hole in a lot of peoples' hearts." (4)

Frank vividly remembers the first time he played. "When I was a kid I lived in a neighborhood where there were fiddlers all around. They used to come to our house and bring their fiddles and dulcimers. That was about 1900. I would just sit and stare and watch their fingers. One night when they were playing cards, I picked up one of their fiddles and started to play. I have been playing ever since." (1) He played in homes, ballrooms, churches, community centers, and arenas and led a dance band that played in almost every community in the Lower Peninsula. In his eighties, he recorded one tape, "Fiddlin' Michigan Style," accompanied by Irma on saxophone and daughter Francis Geiger on the piano.

\r\n

\r\nKnown throughout Ionia County as a music teacher, he estimated he taught fiddle playing to more than 1,000 students and to members of his own family. Granddaughter Karlene Johnson has fond memories of Frank and appreciates her family's passion for music, "I remember when my mother used to take grandfather to the Grand Rapids Symphonette. Soon I started taking him, and I joined the group. The one-and-a-half hour drive there and back each week gave me the chance to learn about a very fascinating and special person." (2) Karlene eventually took fiddle lessons from her grandfather, learning some of the many tunes he had mastered in his lifetime. Even into his nineties, Frank was actively playing, sometimes several times a day and performing for others two or three times a week, including with the Senior Neighbors Orchestra at a Grand Rapids senior citizens center.

They are dedicated promoters of traditional regional and ethnic music and dance in central Upper Peninsula. Through their unselfish support of traditional arts, the Tikkanens have strengthened local identity and pride and promoted understanding among diverse groups.

\r\n

\r\nAlthough active with a range of regional groups and traditions, the Tikkanens' primary work is with Finnish Americans. Their list of accomplishments is commendable. By locating and restoring early 78 rpm recordings, they have been instrumental in preserving the music and song of the immigrant generation and introducing legendary artists and their music to today's Finnish Americans and to Finnish nationals in Finland. The Tikkanens also have produced cassette recordings of contemporary local musicians playing traditional music that has great meaning to Finnish Americans. Their efforts were rewarded when the American Folklife Center selected two of their recordings, first a reissue and then one of Oren's original productions, for the center's annual list of the best recordings of traditional music for their given year.

\r\n

\r\nThe Tikkanens augment their dedication to preservation as skilled performers. Often they play backup for older musicians who perform for local events and at annual folk music festivals. As an Upper Peninsula native son, Oren grew up in a context of multicultural music, jokes, stories, and dialect. Using this traditional repertoire, he developed his talents not only as a performer of traditional music but also as a raconteur and an engaging master of ceremonies able to present an extraordinary range of musicians and other performers.

\r\n

\r\nDr. James Leary of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, says about the Tikkanens "that [they] have done so much for so long for so many is indicative of both their love of Finnish American music and of their generosity. It is appropriate that the Michigan Traditional Arts Program publicly recognize Oren and Toni Tikkanen for the longevity and worth of their dedication. They are a cultural treasure." (1)

In addition to being well known for her exemplary quilting, Mary has been a staunch supporter of local history organizations, loaning her quilts for exhibitions and regularly donating quilts to raise funds through raffles and other fundraisers.

\r\n

\r\nMary was born on April 27, 1910 in Austria-Hungary and immigrated with her family first to Kansas City, Kansas and then, in 1920, to Flint. Her mother passed away shortly after coming to Kansas City but other women in her neighborhood there and in Michigan nurtured Mary's early love of sewing, tatting, and other needlework. She made her first quilt in 1956, copying an old one she had found and repaired, and, in the process, became interested in quilting and quilt history.

\r\n

\r\nDuring this period, published materials on quilting were scarce and often hard to find, but Mary diligently wrote others, joined "round robins," subscribed to ephemeral quilting magazines, and became one of the leaders in a network of individuals sharing information. Determined to share her newfound information about quilters with others "because I think that they should have more honor than they have for their work" (1), Mary gave her first public presentation in April 1971 at the YWCA and subsequently spoke to many groups, particularly in the Great Lakes region, on both historical and technical aspects of quilting. Simultaneously, she began entering her own quilts in juried quilt exhibitions, winning top prizes in local and national events for her classic quilts featuring original borders and quilting designs-elements that became Mary's trademark. By the time of the quilting revival of the 1970s, Mary had become a well-known figure in the quilting world.

\r\n

\r\nRecently, individuals and groups across Michigan and the nation donated funds to help the MSU Museum acquired part of her collection--developed over a period of 40 years--of more than 200 quilts plus quilt tops, fabrics, and quilt blocks representative of most quilt styles and periods in American history. This collection, now in public stewardship, will continue Mary's dream of celebrating quilters and educating the public about quilt history.

He is regarded as a virtuoso on the concertina, accordion, violin, mandolin, and guitar, instruments on which he has played old-time dance music for Italians, Finns, Slovenians, and Croatians at house parties and community dances for more than 60 years. According to Oren Tikkanen, he is considered "a one-man Yooper multi-ethnic festival." (Yooper is the term for residents of the Upper Peninsula). It is his mastery, repertoire, and performance style with bones and spoons, however, that is most widely appreciated. Musician Randy Seppala said of Johnny, "He just may be the greatest bones and spoons player in the country. He is certainly a great master, playing with an intensity and technical precision unequaled by anyone I am aware of." (1)

\r\n

\r\nJohnny's preferred instruments are four rib-shaped bones crafted of smooth, curved ebony wood by a Finnish immigrant carpenter. His introduction to the bones began in 1948. Johnny was playing his concertina in a local tavern that a bones and spoon player often frequented, playing to the music of the jukebox for drinks. He also kept time to Johnny's music, using spoons. He showed Johnny how to hold the spoons, but fearing competition, he was not encouraging when Johnny found them awkward. At that time, Johnny happened to find a set of bones, and he also made a set from horse ribs. Thus Johnny began his love for the bones.

\r\n

\r\nAlthough Italian-American, it is not surprising that in this densely Finnish American area of the Upper Peninsula Johnny is well acquainted with Finnish-American music. In the early 1980s he began playing traditional Finnish music with local Finnish American musicians. Consequently, in this region of the country, traditional Finnish American music includes bones and spoons. Johnny explains about himself, "Johnny's bones were made by a Finnish immigrant, so, although he has not Finnish blood in his veins, he does have Finnish bones in his hands." (2)

\r\n

\r\nAs a native and resident of the Keewenaw Peninsula, Johnny, b. 1920, also is a treasure trove of stories, ethnic jokes, knowledge about the history of the area and butterflies. He has always been fascinated with butterflies, and since 1961 he has compiled a large scientific collection of lepidoptera. Whether it is music, butterflies, bugs, musical instrument refinishing projects, or gardening, Johnny continues as master of his lifelong interests.

\r\n

\r\nJohnny passed away on February 1, 2009. Many of his friends spent time with him in the last few days, playing music to ease his final hours.

In the interim, Bea moved to Detroit where she held several jobs, including a position in an aircraft factory during World War II, and she raised a family. In 1958 she purchased her first rug loom, and began recycling old clothes, blankets, sheets, towels, etc., into beautiful, highly coveted rugs for her home, gifts, and occasional sales.<\/span>

\r\n

\r\nBea's technical perfection and use of breathtaking colors were the result of many decades of weaving. Fellow weaver Doris Allen refers to Bea's loom as "the canvas of a great artist. There is no suggestion of randomness in her choice of materials; everything is integrated into a complete picture." (1) With her mother's instructions, occasional reference to books and other weavers, visits to Finland where rag weaving is also highly prized, and her husband, Arnold, who kept her loom in top working order, Bea continued to excel in her art and to attract admiration and praise.<\/span>

\r\n

\r\nShe taught her weaving skills and techniques to apprentices through the Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship Program (1994, 1996, 1998-2000), infecting her apprentices with the love of weaving and reinforcing the tradition in the greater Detroit area. Bea was an active member of FinnWeavers, a group affiliated with the Finnish Center Association in Farmington Hills. She also displayed her work at the national FinnFest, demonstrated weaving at the National Folk Festival, and has received awards from the Michigan League of Handweavers and at the Michigan State Fair. Despite all the attention, Bea continued to give generously of her time to help weavers with their problems and to teach her "tricks of the trade."<\/span>

\r\n

\r\nPaul was born in the Upper Peninsula's L'Anse\/Herman area in 1938, a time when every Finnish home used rag rugs and weaving was a skill in which many took pride. As a child he assisted the weavers in his family by repairing their looms and with preparing rags, warping looms, and tying fringes. He actually began to weave at age 13. As a young man, Paul, who had always been good at carpentry, established his own construction company. Despite his busy life, he always managed to find time to weave. When he retired, he opened a coffee and craft shop, in the backroom of which he setup a weaving studio where he wove on an old, immigrant-made loom and taught others to weave. He now was able to devote himself to weaving. The shop also served as an outlet for the traditional Finnish foods he enjoyed cooking. It became a gathering place for locals where they visited as they drank coffee and ate Finnish coffee bread. On Sundays, he served a special brunch of Finnish specialties. Although the shop is now closed, Paul is still weaving and aspires to making a loom.

\r\n

\r\nPaul's dedication to the preservation of Finnish history and culture extended to the restoration of the Herman Community Hall built in 1901 by Finnish immigrants and for which he donated his time and carpentry skills. His selfless enthusiasm and volunteer efforts for his community include donations of his rag rugs for raffles and various local fundraisers. Paul's devotion to old Finnish traditions endears him to his neighbors and friends.

Born in Minnesota in 1925, Lois and her family moved to Michigan soon after. Lois attended her first house party at age one, began playing fiddle at age nine, and played twin fiddles together with her father for many years thereafter. Her formal music instruction with other teachers lasted for ten years. Steeped in the music tradition of her father and grandfather, however, her dedication to and perpetuation of the old-time Missouri fiddling style has not waned.

\r\n

\r\nAccolades for Lois call attention to her musical ability, her generosity and encouragement to others, and her commitment to fiddling. Stephen Williams, fellow fiddler and director of the Port Huron Museum of Art and History, credits her with inspiring him to become a musician more than 25 years ago. "She showed me the rudiments of bowing and fingering and she gave me her own recordings of tunes played the way her father had played them. When she felt confident that I was serious about this venerable tradition, she handed me her father's instrument and charged me with the awesome responsibility of keeping both the tradition and the fiddle alive." (1)

\r\n

\r\nLois has played for dances through the years with a number of bands. In 1951 she organized her first dance band that played for square dances. She plays at various statewide fiddlers' jamborees, including the one she established in Flushing. In 1978 she organized an old-time band, Shades of Blue, for which she is the lead singer and fiddler. The band plays without a fee at senior centers, schools, churches, care homes, class reunions, round and square dances, community events, festivals, and jamborees in the region. In addition to her dedication to old-time music, Lois plays a key role in the Flushing Area Historical Society and is active in many ways in her community. She continues to have a profound influence on many individuals who all agree, "she is one of a kind."

Marie tribe of Chippewa Indians. Although only in his 50s, he is known as a traditionalist and preserver of traditional skills. He believes he has a responsibility to teach others of his tribe about their heritage and he has devoted himself to teaching family and community members a variety of Ojibwa traditions. Ron makes birch bark containers, antler and bone carvings, knives, cedar and deer hide drums, porcupine quill boxes, beadwork, black ash baskets, fishing nets, and birch bark canoes. He is a storyteller and a fisherman. Although a master of these Ojibwa traditions, Ron is being recognized for maintaining and reinforcing the tradition of birch bark canoe making.

\r\n

\r\nCanoes are important to Ojibwa culture and history and Ron is committed to their perpetuation. Years ago, when Ron first realized he wanted to make canoes, his uncle deemed it impractical for him to make them because "tourists weren't interested in buying them." However, as he watched the masters of this craft die, Ron knew if he didn't learn, there wouldn't be anyone left to teach subsequent generations. He worked with family and tribal members to learn carpentry skills and the gathering and processing of materials, and he talked with elders to "learn bits and pieces." He also studied older canoes and occasionally he turned to books. By 2003 he had made some 12 canoes, about one a year. One canoe was completed with a master artist grant from ArtServe Michigan; another was made with support from the Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship Program. Ron often involves community youth and adults in his canoe-making projects; males do the actual building and women do the sewing. He has also made canoes in schools with students. Many of his canoes go to tribal collections in museums in Michigan.

\r\n

\r\nRon has helped many people in his area gain an appreciation of Native culture, through projects at the Museum of Ojibwa Culture in St. Ignace, Michigan, through the tribe, with his activities with students, and by encouraging other elders to share their skills with young people. His mastery of canoe making is symbolic of his commitment to his heritage.","Date":{"month":"","day":"","year":"2003","era":"CE","prefix":"","suffix":""},"Display":"True","Tradition":["birch bark canoe maker"],"MTAAP Associator":["A2-368-2","A2-368-5B","A2-368-67","A2-368-7A","A2-368-8B","A2-368-98","A2-368-9E","A2-368-AC","A2-368-BC","A2-368-C3","A2-368-D1","A2-368-DB"],"Collections Associator":["A2-33F-2E","A2-33F-35","A2-33F-2F"],"Image":["A2-373-64","A2-373-65","A2-373-66"],"Author":"","Exhibit Associator":"","Audio":"","Video":""},"A2-369-47":{"kid":"A2-369-47","pid":162,"schemeID":"873","linkers":[],"systimestamp":"2016-11-17T12:43:37-05:00","recordowner":"micahling","Awardee_Name":["Laina Marie Lampi"],"Year":"2003 awardee","Awardee_City":["Clawson"],"Awardee_County":["Macomb County"],"Essay":"Laina (Kehus) Lampi (b.1914) is an exceptional rag rug weaver in the Finnish American tradition. As a child growing up in Tapiola, she learned about weaving from her mother, who had learned in Finland; however, it would be many years before Laina began to weave on a regular basis. Like many young females of her generation who left home to seek work in big cities in the 1930s, Laina went to Detroit, where she found employment. Eventually she married and raised a family. Upon her mother's death, she received her mother's precious loom, large, old and immigrant-made, which Laina values highly and on which she has been weaving for forty years. She credits her loom for her ability to make pleasing rugs. "A good rug," she declared, "requires a good loom."(1)

\r\n

\r\nLaina's technical perfection and expert use of colors are also the result of decades of weaving. Like all Finnish American weavers, she is a consummate recycler. Her rags come from old clothing, blankets, sheets, and towels people give her or she finds at flea markets, rummage sales, and resale shops. Recycling these discards into beautiful rugs is her special art. It also is her way "to save the earth." Color is one of the standards she looks for in rugs and her own sense of color is exceptional. Doris Allen, weaver and fellow member of FinnWeavers (Farmington Hills, Michigan), lauds Laina's artistry, "The technical construction [of Laina's rugs] can be achieved by others, if they work at it, but the colors and designs are from an artistic soul . . .Laina has managed to raise the production of rag rugs, conventionally thought of as a utilitarian form, to an art form."(2)

\r\n

\r\nAs a preservationist and proud Finnish American, Laina has consciously taught her skills and knowledge perfected over the years with others in her family who share her enthusiasm. She also has mentored many beginning rag rug weavers. She has displayed her rugs at FinnFest and in the traveling exhibition "A Living Legacy: Finnish American Rag Rugs." She has demonstrated rag weaving and has made presentations about rag rug weaving to other weavers' guilds. "My weaving life," Laina said, "has been very fulfilling." (3)

\r\n

\r\nThe Michigan Heritage Award recognizes Laina Lampi's lifelong dedication to and masterful execution of rag rug weaving.

Dorson (1916-1981) was Distinguished Professor of History and Folklore and Director of the Folklore Institute at Indiana University. He was a remarkable and energetic scholar who, at the time of his death, was the dominant force in the study of folklore. Dr. Dorson’s documentation of Upper Peninsula and southwestern Michigan traditions is his legacy to Michiganders.

\r\n

\r\nIn 1944 Richard Dorson joined the faculty at Michigan State College; in 1957 he left for Indiana University. During his time at Michigan State College, he and his students conducted groundbreaking research in Michigan, documenting everyday life and expression that have since changed or no longer exist. In 1946, Richard Dorson drove the byways of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, sat in hotel lobbies and homes, in barbershops and Grange Halls, in bars and church basements collecting the oral traditions, customs, and beliefs of many of the region’s diverse population. The Upper Peninsula for Richard Dorson was a microcosm of America. In this thinking, he was well ahead of his time. Here he found a truly diverse population, composed of different ethnicities, languages, religions, and occupations. It was a region where the environment, economy, politics, and diverse peoples forged the region’s folklore within the trajectory of American history.

\r\n

\r\nDorson’s research in the Upper Peninsula left a rich record of folklife of a specific region at a specific moment in American history, resulting in a number of articles and Bloodstoppers and Bearwalkers, (1) which has been reprinted many times over the years.

\r\n

\r\nDr. Dorson also conducted important work among African Americans of southwestern Michigan, exploring the intercultural relation of race in regional and national culture. His research resulted in historically and culturally important records, published in articles and books, including Negro Folktales in Michigan (2) andNegro Tales from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Calvin, Michigan. (3)He also documented the folklore of Michigan State College students, thereby questioning the popular assumptions about who are the folk and proving that students and educated classes are also the folk.

\r\n

\r\nOur understanding of American folklore and the cultural history of the Upper Peninsula, in particular, would be infinitely poorer without Richard Dorson’s work. His popular writings forced students and scholars of culture to look closely at Michigan’s cultural inheritance and relate it to their own experience. He brought attention to a region, culture, and people who eluded national attention.

He began accordion lessons at about the age of 4 when his parents recognized his musical potential after hearing him play an accordion given to him by his uncle. His father once took him to a wedding, accordion in tow, and sat him beside a concertina player. Stas played along in perfect time, and it was then that his father invested in a larger accordion.

\r\n

\r\nWhen Stas was 9, he organized his own band and played at neighborhood clubs, dances, and many different Polish social events. In 1945 he graduated from the Detroit Institute of Musical Art as the first student with a major in the accordion. In the 1950s he became the orchestra leader of the Club Polka show on WXYZ and also performed on "Soupy Sales" and "Our Friend Harry." He moved to California in 1966 where he lived and performed professionally for Polish communities and others. He returned to Detroit in 2001 to perform at the gala reception of the exhibition, "Polish Presence in Detroit," at the Detroit Historical Museum, and there he remained.

\r\n

\r\nDuring his more-than-70-year career, Stas taught accordion to many. He also has made a number of recordings. It is, however, the 1960s collection of Polish folk ballads, "Sentimental Journey to Poland," with the Jan Wojnar ensemble that Polish music historian Laurie Gomulka Palazzolo regards as "one of the most perfect recordings ever made." She states, "Stas's work on this recording represents some of the finest musicianship I have ever heard." (1)

\r\n

\r\nIn 2004 he was selected for a Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship award to teach accordion and Polish folk music to Georgiana Leonard.

Initially, they made about 25 a year. Today the Messiah Quilters ship about 700 quilts a year by boxcar to the Lutheran World Relief distribution center and make a number of quilts for local organizations, charities, and fundraisers. As of October, 2003, they had completed 11,233 quilts.

\r\n

\r\nEvery Thursday sixteen to twenty-four individuals, mostly women and some men, meet in Magnuson Hall at the Messiah Lutheran Church. Some participate only in the morning or the afternoon but many stay the entire day. Other members of the group work out of their homes. Each focuses on a specific part of the process: preparing fabric for use; cutting, laying out, or sewing squares; preparing the lining and the back; tying the quilt together; binding edges. More than half the fabric used in the quilt top is recycled cloth; quilts also are often lined and backed with old blankets, flannel sheets, and other large pieces of recycled fabric. The recycled cloth is acquired by donations from members and the community at large or purchased with monetary donations. When cleaning closets or downsizing, for example, local residents bring discarded clothing, sheets, and drapes. Other quilters, who have accumulated more material than they will ever use, donate part of their treasured fabric stash. Messiah Quilters purchase new fabric on-sale and used clothing and fabrics by the bagful at St. Vincent DePaul and at 50% off at the Goodwill Industries.

\r\n

\r\nThe choice of available materials, timeline, and destination of the quilt are factors that determine its appearance and thickness. When it is known that the quilts will be used on the ground, the first concern is to make a sturdy, warm covering. When the quilts are made for a silent auction to raise money, however, the quilts tend to be larger and from new fabrics.

\r\n

\r\nMaking quilts is a work of generosity and goodwill for the Messiah Quilters. It also is a social time where they exchange news and develop friendships. Each afternoon, the quilters take time for coffee and food they bring from their kitchens. The Messiah Quilters are recognized with a 2004 Michigan Heritage Award for their decades of quilt making to help the needy.","Date":{"month":"","day":"","year":"2004","era":"CE","prefix":"","suffix":""},"Display":"True","Tradition":["quilters"],"Image":["A2-373-67","A2-373-68","A2-373-69","A2-373-6A"],"Author":"","MTAAP Associator":"","Collections Associator":"","Exhibit Associator":"","Audio":"","Video":""},"A2-369-4B":{"kid":"A2-369-4B","pid":162,"schemeID":"873","linkers":["A2-368-8E"],"systimestamp":"2017-02-03T15:30:40-05:00","recordowner":"micahling","Awardee_Name":["James Rice"],"Year":"2004 awardee","Awardee_City":["Hudson"],"Awardee_County":["Lenawee County"],"Essay":"James Rice (b. 1928) grew up helping repair saddles and harnesses for his horse-trading uncle. "I could fix what some of the outlaw horses tore up," he boasted. By the age of 16 he had built his first saddle and eventually learned the saddle-making trade from Billy Ecker, a craftsman for the Henry Kellogg buggy and harness shop in Hudson. Decades later, he established his own shop and is still putting his "Jas. Rice" stamp on saddles prized across America for their beauty and durability. Along the way, he has also been a rodeo broncobuster, metal shop class instructor for seventh through ninth graders, singer, barber, and farmer of 76 acres.

\r\n

\r\n"The prime key to being a good saddle maker," says Jim, "is fitting the horse first." (1) Jim's saddles begin with wooden frame, called a "tree" made to fit the horse's shape and the rider's weight and covered with rawhide. The various steps include cutting and stitching together skirting leather and engraving and tooling designs on the leather. The saddles are his design, heavily engraved with intricate shapes and custom designs that he does completely by hand. "I like to put quite a lot of stamping on," said Jim, "I guess my saddles are known for large skirts." (2)

\r\n

\r\nJim fills orders for his handsome saddles from around the country. Some of the more unusual orders have included saddles with a motorcycle and with nudes. One special order was for a miniature saddle for a monkey that was to ride a small horse. Another one for the Lenawee County sheriff featured white pine branches and cones, white tail deer, robins and apple blossoms. He is especially proud of saddles made for a club in Alaska depicting bears and moose. He also made a saddle for President George W. Bush. Jim makes saddles for hardworking ranchers and for pleasure riders, who tend to prefer silver-studded show saddles. He also repairs and restores old saddles and makes belts and gun holsters.

\r\n

\r\nDuring his 50 plus years of saddle making, Jim has taught several others, and in 2003 he was the recipient of a Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship Award. His apprentice, Danielle Cole, has been working with Jim for several years. Enthusiastic about her work, Jim is grooming Danielle to take over the business.

The paj ntaub (meaning "flower cloth") incorporates a variety of patterns, motifs, and needlework techniques, including appliqué, reverse appliqué, and embroidery. Mastery of the techniques and repertoire of designs and motifs usually takes years, and expert craftsmanship is valued within the community.

\r\n

\r\nTo satisfy her father, Ia studied nursing at Sansonk Hospital, Samthong. She married Teng Yang, a Blue Hmong, and soon thereafter the war in Laos, in which the Hmong were allied with U.S. military operations, forced the Yang family to flee their country to Thailand. In 1976, after living at the Ban Vinai refugee camp for one year, the International Institute in Providence, Rhode Island sponsored the family to immigrate to Providence. There she continued to sew and also found work as a translator at the Women and Infant's Hospital. In 1987 she and her family moved to Detroit.

\r\n

\r\nIn the United States Ia Moua Yang continued to make the clothing necessary for Hmong traditional practices. She also began selling her work to individuals outside the Hmong community. Today increasingly fewer Hmong-Americans continue this textile tradition. Ia Moua Yang, however is not only one of the stalwarts in keeping this art alive, she is simply a master at what she does. Because her work is consistently of high quality and craftsmanship, technically well constructed, incorporates quality materials, and reflects innovative design approaches, she has been successful in making a living through her art. She sells her work at many different venues in Michigan, including at the annual Great Lakes Folk Festival, and at major national quilt shows, including those in Vermont, Chicago, and Houston. For this non-Hmong market she is constantly developing new ways of ingeniously incorporating Hmong designs and textile techniques into items that attract new customers.

\r\n

\r\nAt the same time she remains deeply involved in family and Hmong community life and has played leadership roles in the dissemination and continuity of knowledge about paj ntaub and other Hmong traditions. In addition to teaching paj ntaub to her daughters, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren, she has taught others in her community and given workshops to non-Hmong both within Michigan and at the textile events in Vermont and Houston. She also has authored a "how to" handbook that gives both technical and cultural information on paj ntaub. In tribute to Ia Moua Yang, Carolyn Shapiro, her colleague and Michigan Heritage Award nominator stated, "For Ia, weaving and sewing is not just making cloth, it is creating a social fabric. Her care for her craft is the care and nurturing of her people. It is the thread that links them to their ancestors and to each other."(1)

Since then, this small, family-owned company and its staff and crew have continued a tradition of delivering "mail by the pail," goods, and personnel to Great Lakes freighters as they pass through the Port of Detroit. Located on the river just south of the Ambassador Bridge, J.W. Westcott Company's small white and blue building serves as a hub for the maritime community.

\r\n

\r\nDuring shipping season, J.W. Westcott Co. performs a very personalize, round-the-clock service for the shipping industry, supplying anything requested by the companies or the workers' themselves whether it is a new stove for a freighter, groceries for a steward, or a trip to shore. Canadian and American pilots are required to navigate sea-going freighters through the narrows of the Detroit River, and J.W. Westcott delivers them to the "salties" mid-river.

\r\n

\r\nWestcott captains must master the dangerous maneuver of getting their vessel, often the 45-foot J.W. Westcott II, alongside of and maintaining the same speed as a freighter during the mid-river exchange of goods and personnel, then pulling away decisively so that their smaller vessel is not pulled into the wake of the larger freighter.

\r\n

\r\nMany of Westcott's crew has worked there for decades as boat captains, deckhands, and dispatchers. Like other tight-knit occupational groups, they have developed traditional occupational customs, including an array of slang and nautical terminology, work techniques, nicknaming, pranks, radio conversation styles, storytelling and joke telling. In the face of such a dangerous job, humor in the workplace lightens the mood and puts coworkers at ease.

\r\n

\r\nWhile on a delivery in October 2001, the J.W. Westcott II sank in the Detroit River, resulting in the deaths of a Westcott captain and crewman. The accident affected the entire maritime community. The Westcott employees directed and did much of the work to restore the J.W. Westcott II and put it back in operation in time for the next shipping season.

\r\n

\r\nOwner Jim Hogan says of his staff, "the company and its participants have not really gotten rich monetarily but they've gotten rich with experience and time...their experience down here is in some cases priceless because of what they do. And it's a very unique thing that we're involved with. And we touch a lot of lives. We seem to be very important to a lot of people."

\r\n

\r\nThe J.W. Westcott company and staff are recognized with a 2005 Michigan Heritage Award for 100 years of unique service to the Great Lakes maritime community, for the real and symbolic community center the Westcott provides the maritime community, and for its staff's individual skills as master pilots, maritime raconteurs, and knowledgeable maritime tradition-bearers.","Author":"LuAnne Kozma","Date":{"month":"","day":"","year":"2005","era":"CE","prefix":"","suffix":""},"Display":"True","Tradition":["maritime occupational traditions"],"MTAAP Associator":"","Collections Associator":"","Exhibit Associator":"","Image":"","Audio":"","Video":""},"A2-369-4F":{"kid":"A2-369-4F","pid":162,"schemeID":"873","linkers":[],"systimestamp":"2016-11-17T13:13:29-05:00","recordowner":"micahling","Awardee_Name":["Abdul Karim Bader"],"Year":"2006 awardee","Awardee_City":["Farmington Hills"],"Awardee_County":["Oakland County"],"Essay":"Born in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1921, to a family of musicians, Abdul Karim Bader learned to play oud at the age of seven from his father and grandfather and soon thereafter, violin and cello at the conservatory of music in France. As an adult he performed with some of the major artists of the Middle East and also served as music director at various radio stations before becoming Director of Music Programs at Iraqi Radio and Television.

\r\n

\r\nIn the 1970s Karim traveled to the United States to perform for Arab and American audiences. In 1972 he decided to stay. He has since performed traditional and classical Arabic music all over the United States, Europe, Australia, and South America. He often performs with the Dearborn Traditional Ensemble.

\r\n

\r\nMusic is Karim’s profession and hobby, and the oud is his “best friend.” According to Dearborn Traditional Ensemble leader Nadim Dlaikan, the oud is the “key instrument to achieve the sound of true Arabic melodies.” It is often referred to as the “king of all instruments.” Shaped like half a pear with a short fretted neck, the oud has six courses of two strings played with a plectrum. Because of its popularity, many play the oud, but few come close to Karim’s artistry and his knowledge of Arab classical and traditional music. Students of Arab heritage and other Americans seek him as a teacher. In 2005, with support of a Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship award, Karim continued to mentor his student Laith Alattar, passing on his enthusiasm, love, and knowledge of the oud and Arabic music. In the same year, the Arab American Arts Institute honored him with the Golden ‘Ud Award. In recognition of his superb artistry on the oud and his dedication to the perpetuation of this musical art form, Karim is honored with a 2006 Michigan Heritage Award.","Author":"William G.

(1)She received her B.A. in 1920 and M.A. in 1923 from the University of Michigan. In 1923 she joined the English department at what later became Wayne State University while taking graduate courses in folklore at the University of Chicago. This same energy sustained her through her long career.

\r\n

\r\nWith a colleague, Emily Gardner, Ms. James was involved in the settlement-house movement and conducted folklore-collecting projects with students in Detroit. Concurrently, she supervised other student collectors and archived urban, ethnic, and occupational traditions in the Wayne State University Folklore Archive, one of the first folklore archives in the United States, which she helped establish with Ms. Gardner in 1939. For six decades, this archive had been a valuable resource to scholars and students of Detroit cultures and traditions. In 1999 the Wayne State University Folklore Archive was disassembled and the collections dispersed to the Walter Reuther Archives (Wayne State University), the MSU Museum Archives, and the Great Lakes Lighthouse Keepers Association.

\r\n

\r\nMs. James was a pioneer in her interest and recognition of the tremendous wealth and diversity in urban traditions, and through her efforts many traditions in Detroit were recorded on Edison wire recordings and preserved. Although she published very little, she devoted considerable energy and intellect to her students and to her profession. Throughout her career, Ms. James also held offices in the American Folklore Society and the Michigan Folklore Society, and she was elected a Fellow of the American Folklore Society. In 1967, after 45 years of teaching, she retired from Wayne State University.

\r\n

\r\nMs. James's legacy to the residents of Michigan and her colleagues in folklore are her rich folklore collections made in Detroit, collections and publications of her students, and the scholarly endeavors she inspired in those who followed her in the field of folklore study. Upon retirement, she bequeathed funds to the Wayne State University Press to be used in the publication of folklore studies.

During his four-year apprenticeship he volunteered his services whenever cornice or ornamental work was needed and developed a reputation for his expertise in running cornices and making molds of ornamental plaster. After a long and successful career of beautifying buildings with ornamental plaster, Ernie was coaxed from his Florida retirement home in the late 1980s to head up the plaster restoration on the Michigan State Capitol Restoration Project.

\r\n

\r\nThis project was the granddaddy of ornamental plaster projects. The 1879 building, designed by Elijah Myers, had been adorned from top to bottom with elaborate Victorian-era ornamental plaster and decorative paint, but over the years, much of the building's original beauty had been obscured by suspended ceilings and coats of white paint.

\r\n

\r\nOver the course of the restoration project Ernie and his crew made thousands of feet of replacement plaster cornice, some of which was 24" wide. They replaced thousands of square feet of plaster walls, using one-inch-thick, super-strength plaster. Making rubber molds from the few remaining original plaster cartouches left behind after earlier renovations, Ernie and his crew also made hundreds of replacement cartouches for use above the doors and windows.

\r\n

\r\nErnie worked five years restoring plaster at the Capitol, overseeing a crew of 12 men that included his nephew Gerald Vergeson of Lyons, who learned the ornamental plaster trade from his uncle.

\r\n

\r\nErnie’s craftsmanship can also be seen in Michigan at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor, the Michigan Theater in Lansing, the Fairchild Theater on the Michigan State University campus in East Lansing , the Hannah Community Center in East Lansing, and the courthouse in Flint to name a few.

\r\n

\r\nErnie Hawks is recognized with a 2006 Michigan Heritage Award for his mastery and transmission of the art of ornamental architectural plaster.
