Brooklyn, New York group Gigantic Hand recently released a new single. Saint Joan Of Arc is the fourth single in a row from a series of singles that promotes March, a highly anticipated upcoming full-length album set to release in December for Detroit-based record label Down Peninsula Audio. Saint Joan Of Arc reveals dueling female and male vocals that perfectly suit a slightly raw but soothing indie rock sound. Like previous singles, Saint Joan Of Arc vividly demonstrates what we might expect on an upcoming full-length release, which will unquestionably be one of the best indie releases this year.

Still, Gigantic Hand doesn’t stop on indie rock but also explores so many genres along the way. There’s not even the slightest doubt that the group is inspired by nineties rock, grunge, alternative rock, darkwave, and other similar genres. The band took Mark Twain’s statement that Saint Joan Of Arc was his only hero. The song showcases how Joan went from hero for saving France from England’s ownership in 1492. to being a martyr after she was sentenced to burn on a stake. The composition is dark, nearly melancholic, grungy and properly describes the theme. Saint Joan Of Arc is available for listening to on all streaming services.
