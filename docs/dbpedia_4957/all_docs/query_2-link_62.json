Depth to compact subsoil effects on soil properties and barley-potato yields on a loamy soil in New Brunswick. Can. J. Soil Sci. 95: 203-218. An experiment was established to investigate the implications of thickness of soil over compact subsoil on plow layer soil thermal and water regimes and ultimately the yield of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Three depths were considered, 24 cm (shallow), 36 cm (medium) and 60 cm (deep). Results on soil temperature impacts were inconclusive. The shallow treatment water content was most greatly affected by precipitation and had the greatest potential to become saturated then drying out more than the other treatments. The deep treatment did not improve soil temperature and water regimes enough to increase crop yield. The medium depth, which most closely approximated existing local solum development, proved superior to the shallow treatment in terms of crop yield and reduced soil moisture variation, while the deep treatment did not warrant the effort required to create under field conditions. Barley and potato yields from the medium depth were greatest with 20% (significant) and 8% (not significant) more yield, respectively, than from the shallow treatment. The eroded soil profiles common to the New Brunswick potato belt exacerbate soil erosion since an eroded soil has less volume to accept water from a rainfall event, making the soil more prone to erosion, especially if it is true that our weather is changing, with the amplitude of weather shifts becoming greater. Incorporation of subsoil materials into the plow layer of eroded soils due to soil loss may result in further reduction in crop yield.\n\nHaynes, K. M., Preston, M. D., McLaughlin, J. W., Webster, K. and Basiliko, N. 2015. Dissimilar bacterial and fungal decomposer communities across rich to poor fen peatlands exhibit functional redundancy. Can. J. Soil Sci. 95: 219-230. Climatic and environmental changes can lead to shifts in the dominant vegetation communities present in northern peatland ecosystems, including from Sphagnum- to vascular-dominated systems. Such shifts in vegetation result in changes to the chemical quality of carbon substrates for soil microbial decomposers, with leaves and roots deposited in the peat surface and subsurface that potentially decompose faster. This study characterized the bacterial and fungal communities present along a nutrient gradient ranging from rich to poor fen peatlands and assessed the metabolic potential of these communities to mineralize a variety of organic matter substrates of varying chemical complexity using substrate-induced respiration (SIR) assays. Distinct microbial communities existed between rich, intermediate and poor fens, but SIR in each of the three sites exhibited the same pattern of carbon mineralization, providing support for the concept of functional redundancy, at least under standardized in vitro conditions. Preferential mineralization of simple organic substrates in the rich fen and complex compounds in the poor fen was not observed. Similarly, no preference was given to “native” organic matter extracts derived from each fen, with microbial communities opting for the most bioavailable substrate. This study suggests that soil bacteria and fungi might be able to respond relatively rapidly to shifts in vegetation communities and subsequent changes in the quality of carbon substrate additions to peatlands associated with environmental and climatic change.\n\nGuy, A. L., Siciliano, S. D. and Lamb, E. G. 2015. Spiking regional vis-NIR calibration models with local samples to predict soil organic carbon in two High Arctic polar deserts using a vis-NIR probe. Can. J. Soil Sci. 95: 237-249. In situ visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy is a potential solution to the logistic constraints limiting the accuracy and spatial resolution of soil organic carbon (SOC) estimates for Arctic regions. The objective of our study was to develop a calibration model based on field-condition soils for in situ applications to predict SOC in High Arctic polar desert soils from vis-NIR spectra. Soils (n=240) for calibration models were collected from three regional Canadian Arctic sites in 2010 and two local target sites in 2013. Local and regional calibration models were developed using partial least squares regression (PLSR). We assessed whether spiking or spiking and extra-weighting, regional models with calibration samples from local sites improved prediction of the local sites. The local model yielded successful prediction of target sites (R2=0.91) whereas unspiked regional models had poor prediction accuracy (R2=0.07 to 0.36; n=4). Spiking regional models with as few as 12 local samples greatly improved the SOC prediction of target sites; the best spiked models had R2 between 0.69 and 0.86. Extra-weighting spiking subsets in regional models yielded limited improvements in prediction performance. These results suggest that regional vis-NIR calibration models can be successfully used to predict SOC in High Arctic polar desert soils. The in situ application of these calibration models using field-portable instruments in remote areas, relative to traditional laboratory methods, can achieve higher sample sizes and the ability to characterize the spatial variability of SOC.\n\nReynolds, W. D., Drury, C. F., Tan, C. S. and Yang, X. M. 2015. Temporal effects of food waste compost on soil physical quality and productivity. Can. J. Soil Sci. 95: 251-268. The benefits of compost additions on soil organic carbon content and crop productivity are extant in the literature, but detailed studies of compost effects on soil physical quality (SPQ) are limited. The objective of this study was therefore to describe how one-time additions of compost impact the immediate, mid-term and long-term SPQ and crop yields of an agricultural soil. Food waste compost (FWC) was incorporated once into the top 10 cm of a humid-temperate Brookston clay loam soil at rates of 0 (Control), 75 dry t ha-1 (FWC-75), 150 dry t ha-1 (FWC-150) and 300 dry t ha-1 (FWC-300); measurements of SPQ parameters and corn yield were then made annually over the next 11 yr. The SPQ parameters included bulk density (BD), organic carbon content (OC), air capacity (AC), plant-available water capacity (PAWC), relative field capacity (RFC), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (KS), which were obtained from intact (undisturbed) soil core samples. Prior to compost addition, BD, OC, AC, PAWC, RFC and KS were substantially non-optimal, and BD had increased relative to virgin soil by 46%, while OC, AC and PAWC had decreased relative to virgin soil by 60, 56 and 43%, respectively. Improvements in SPQ 1 yr after compost addition were negligible or small for FWC-75 and FWC-150, but FWC-300 generated optimal values for BD, OC, AC, PAWC and RFC. The SPQ parameters degraded with time, but 11 yr after compost addition, OC and AC under FWC-300 were still within their optimal ranges, as well as significantly (P<0.05) greater than the Control values by 65 and 26%, respectively. Soil cracks and biopores apparently induced substantial annual variation in KS, but average KS nevertheless increased with increasing compost addition rate. Corn grain yield varied substantially among years, which was likely due to weather and compost effects; however, 11-yr cumulative yields from the compost treatments were greater than the Control by 2200-6500 kg ha-1.\n\nBekele, A., Roy, J. L. and Young, M. A. 2015. Use of biochar and oxidized lignite for reconstructing functioning agronomic topsoil: Effects on soil properties in a greenhouse study. Can. J. Soil Sci. 95: 269-285. Interest in the use of biochar as soil amendment has grown recently. However, studies evaluating its potential use for reclamation of disturbed agricultural lands are lacking. We studied the effects of amending clay, loam, and sand subsoil substrates with wood biochar pyrolized at 800°C, oxidized lignite (humalite), or labile organic mix (sawdust, wheat straw, and alfalfa; LOM) on soil organic carbon (C), microbial biomass, dry aggregated size distribution and penetration resistance in greenhouse. We also considered the co-application of LOM and biochar or humalite to the subsoil substrates as treatments where C from either biochar or humalite represented a stable form of C. The amount and composition of the mix of organic amendments was determined for each subsoil so that organic C levels of reconstructed topsoil would be equivalent to that of the corresponding native topsoil in the long term. Field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were grown in rotation in four sequential greenhouse studies. Results from soil analysis at the end of study II and study IV showed that subsoils amended with biochar or humalite had higher organic C than those with LOM only, regardless of soil type. Labile organic mix added alone or together with biochar or humalite to subsoil increased microbial biomass and decreased geometric mean diameter of the dry soil aggregates. The effects of biochar or humalite-only amendment on these soil properties were not significant relative to the unamended subsoil substrate. Simultaneous application of biochar or humalite with LOM can potentially be used for topsoil reconstruction and reclamation of disturbed agricultural lands, and to maintain soil quality in the long term. However, long-term field studies are required to ascertain the longevity of the desirable properties reported in this study and to assess effects associated with aging of biochar or humalite in the soil.\n\nDu, Y., Huffman, T., Daneshfar, B., Green, M., Feng, F., Liu, J., Liu, T. and Liu, H. 2015. Improving the spatial resolution and ecostratification of crop yield estimates in Canada. Can. J. Soil Sci. 95: 287-297. Canada's terrestrial ecostratification framework provides nested spatial units for organizing national data related to soils, landforms and land use. In the agricultural domain, the lack of national, uniform crop yield data on the ecostratification framework severely hinders our ability to evaluate the biophysical data with respect to economic and climatic conditions. We developed a national crop yield database at the regional (ecodistrict) level by aggregating individual records of an existing but very broad-level sample-derived yield database according to the ecostratification hierarchy. Issues related to the different sampling frameworks and the need for confidentiality of individual records were resolved in order to generate an ecostratified crop yield dataset at a reasonably detailed spatial scale. Sixty crops were first statistically arranged into 37 agronomically similar crop groups in order to increase class size, and these crop groups were aggregated into increasingly large spatial units until confidentiality was assured. The methodology maintained data quality and confidentiality while producing crop yield estimates at the ecodistrict level. Comparison to independent crop insurance data confirmed that the resulting crop yield data are valid where estimates were derived from data released at the level of an ecodistrict or an ecoregion, but not at the ecoprovince level. Our crop yield estimates offer a reasonably high level of spatial precision while remaining within standard confidentiality constraints."
