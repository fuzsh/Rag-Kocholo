And since they’re made with real ingredients, most of which you probably already have in your kitchen, you can whip them up anytime and feel good about it.\n\nWe stored these in an airtight container in the fridge for a week, and they kept beautifully. I bet you could also freeze them – individually wrapped in parchment paper or plastic wrap, then sealed in a Ziploc bag – and just take a few out as you need them.\n\nNext on my to-do list is making the Honey Graham and Iced Oatmeal flavors. Stay tuned!\n\nPrint"
