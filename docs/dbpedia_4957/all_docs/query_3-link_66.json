        "text": "The global assurance of safe drinking water and basic sanitation has been recognised as a United Nations Millennium Development Goal (Bartram et al., 2005), particularly in light of the pressures of rising urbanisation, agricultural intensification, and climate change (Haddeland et al., 2014; Schewe et al., 2014). Waterborne diseases represent a particular global threat, with zoonotic diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, or leptospirosis resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths each year (Prüss et al., 2002; Prüss-Ustün et al., 2019).\n\nTo control for risks of infection by waterborne diseases, microbial assessments can be conducted. While traditional microbial tests focus on the isolation of specific bacterial indicator organisms through selective media outgrowth in a diagnostic laboratory, this cultivation process is all too often time consuming, infrastructure-dependent and lacks behind in automatisation (Salazar and Sunagawa, 2017; Tringe and Rubin, 2005). Environmental metagenomics, the direct tracing of DNA from environmental samples, constitutes a less organism-tailored, data-driven monitoring alternative. Such approaches have been demonstrated to provide robust measurements of relative taxonomic species composition as well as functional diversity in a variety of environmental contexts (Almeida et al., 2019; Bahram et al., 2018; Tara Oceans coordinators et al., 2015), and overcome enrichment and resolution biases common to culturing (Salazar and Sunagawa, 2017; Tringe and Rubin, 2005). However, they usually depend on expensive stationary equipment, specialised operational training and substantial time lags between fieldwork, sample preparation, raw data generation and access. Combined, there is an increasing demand for freshwater monitoring frameworks that unite the advantages of metagenomic workflows with high cost effectiveness, fast technology deployability, and data transparency (Gardy and Loman, 2018).\n\nIn recent years, these challenges have been revisited with the prospect of mobile DNA analysis. The main driver of this is the ‘portable’ MinION device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), which enables real-time DNA sequencing using nanopores (Jain et al., 2016). Nanopore read lengths can be comparably long, currently up to ~2*106 bases (Payne et al., 2019), which is enabled by continuous electrical sensing of sequential nucleotides along single DNA strands. In connection with a laptop for the translation of raw voltage signal into nucleotides, nanopore sequencing can be used to rapidly monitor long DNA sequences in remote locations. Although there are still common concerns about the technology's base-level accuracy, mobile MinION setups have already been transformative for real-time tracing and rapid data sharing during bacterial and viral pathogen outbreaks (Boykin et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2020; Faria et al., 2018; Faria et al., 2017; Kafetzopoulou et al., 2019; Quick et al., 2015; Quick et al., 2016). In the context of freshwater analysis, a MinION whole-genome shotgun sequencing protocol has recently been leveraged for a comparative study of 11 rivers (Reddington et al., 2020). This report highlights key challenges which emerge in serial monitoring scenarios of a relatively low-input DNA substrate (freshwater), for example large sampling volumes (2–4 l) and small shotgun fragments (mean < 4 kbp). We reasoned that targeted DNA amplification may be a suitable means to bypass these bottlenecks and assess river microbiomes with nanopore sequencing.\n\nHere, we report a simple, cost-effective workflow to assess and monitor microbial freshwater ecosystems with targeted nanopore DNA sequencing. Our benchmarking study involves the design and optimisation of essential experimental steps for multiplexed MinION usage in the context of local environments, together with an evaluation of computational methods for the bacterial classification of nanopore sequencing reads from metagenomic libraries. To showcase the resolution of sequencing-based aquatic monitoring in a spatiotemporal setting, we combine DNA analyses with physicochemical measurements of surface water samples collected at nine locations within a confined ~12 km reach of the River Cam passing through the city of Cambridge (UK) in April, June, and August 2018.\n\nUsing a cost-effective, easily adaptable and scalable framework, we provide the first spatiotemporal nanopore sequencing atlas of bacterial microbiota throughout the course of a river. Our results suggest that this workflow allows for robust assessments of both, the core microbiome of an example fluvial ecosystem and heterogeneous bacterial compositions in the context of supporting physical (temperature, flow rate) and hydrochemical (pH, inorganic solutes) parameters. We show that the technology's current sequencing accuracy of ~92% allows for the designation of significant human pathogen community shifts along rural-to-urban river transitions, as illustrated by downstream increases in the abundance of pathogen candidates.\n\nOur assessment of bioinformatics workflows for taxonomic classification highlights current challenges with error-prone nanopore sequences. A number of recent reports feature bespoke 16S read classification schemes centred around a single software (Acharya et al., 2019; Benítez-Páez et al., 2016; Kerkhof et al., 2017; Nygaard et al., 2020), and others integrated outputs from two methods (Cuscó et al., 2018). Through systematic benchmarking of twelve different classification tools, using matched mock community and river water datasets with respect to the SILVA v.132 reference database, we lay open key differences in terms of these methods' read (mis)classification rates, consensus agreements, speed and memory performance metrics. For example, our results indicate that very fast implementations like Kraken 2 or Centrifuge yield less accurate classifications than slightly slower and more memory-demanding frameworks such as Minimap2 (Figure 2; Figure 2—figure supplement 1).\n\nUsing Minimap2, 16.2% of freshwater-derived sequencing reads were assigned to a bacterial species on average, thereby primarily encouraging automated analyses on the genus (65.6% assigned) or family level (76.6% assigned). As nanopore sequencing quality continues to increase through refined pore chemistries, basecalling algorithms and consensus sequencing workflows (Calus et al., 2018; Karst et al., 2021; Latorre-Pérez et al., 2020; Rang et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2020; Zurek et al., 2020), future bacterial taxonomic classifications are likely to improve and advance opportunities for species discovery.\n\nWe show that nanopore amplicon sequencing data can resolve the core microbiome of a freshwater body, as well as its temporal and spatial fluctuations. Common freshwater bacteria account for the vast majority of taxa in the River Cam; this includes Sphingomonadaceae, which had also been previously found at high abundance in source water from the same river (Rowe et al., 2016). Our findings suggest that the differential abundances of Carnobacteriaceae most strongly contribute to seasonal loadings in the River Cam. Carnobacteriaceae have been previously associated with a range of low-temperature environments (Lawson and Caldwell, 2014), and we found these taxa to be more abundant in colder April samples (mean 11.3°C, vs. 15.8°C in June and 19.1°C in August). This might help to further establish this family as an indicator for bacterial community shifts along with temperature fluctuations, albeit the influence of co-occurring hydrochemical trends such as water hardness, dissolved carbon or flow speed changes should also be noted (Figure 6b–d; Figure 6—figure supplement 1d).\n\nMost routine freshwater surveillance frameworks focus on semi-quantitative diagnostics of only a limited number of target taxa, such as pathogenic Salmonella, Legionella and faecal coliforms (Ramírez-Castillo et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2015), whereas metagenomics approaches can give a complete and detailed overview of environmental microbial diversity. Besides nanopore shotgun-sequencing (Reddington et al., 2020), our proof-of-principle analysis highlights that targeted full-length 16S rRNA gene MinION sequencing is a suitable complement to hydrochemical controls in pinpointing relatively contaminated freshwater sites, some of which in case of the River Cam had been previously highlighted for their pathogen diversity and abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes (Rowe et al., 2017; Rowe et al., 2016). Nanopore amplicon sequencing has here allowed us to reliably distinguish closely related pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species of the common Legionella, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Leptospira genera. For Leptospira bacteria, which are of particular interest to communal stakeholders of the River Cam, we validated nanopore sequencing results through the gold standard qPCR workflow of Public Health England (Supplementary file 5). In order to also study the potential viability and functional implications of sequenced pathogen candidates for public health, we encourage future studies to combine nanopore based freshwater metagenomics with targeted follow-up measurements of living pathogens by established microbiological approaches, including species-specific isolation and subsequent culturing.\n\nA number of experimental intricacies should be addressed towards nanopore freshwater sequencing with our approach, mostly by scrutinising water DNA extraction yields, PCR biases and molar imbalances in barcode multiplexing (Figure 3a; Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–b; Supplementary file 2). Similar to challenges with other organic substrates, microbial raw DNA extraction protocols require careful pre-testing and optimisation towards the physicochemical composition of a given freshwater source, in order to avoid both taxonomic enrichment biases and drop-offs in total yield. One example lies in the optimisation of the filtrate volume – in this study, membrane DNA extraction from 400 mL River Cam water was sufficient to yield valuable insights, while as much as 10,000 mL were used in a previous study of the same river (Rowe et al., 2016). Moreover, potentially dissolved inhibitory compounds for DNA extraction, sample cooling and storage chains should be thoroughly considered for larger and remote river monitoring projects. We witnessed that yield variations may bear negative effects on the molar balance of barcoded nanopore sequencing runs, as illustrated by elevated sample dropouts in June 2018, emphasising the need for highly accurate concentration measurement and scaling when dozens of input DNA sources are pooled. Our study further highlights that MinION (R9.4.1) flow cell throughput can fluctuate by an order of magnitude, altogether causing the exclusion of measurements upon application of a conservative read threshold. We reason that real-time selective nanopore sequencing could serve as a powerful means to improve barcode balances in the context of multiplexed 16S analyses (Loose et al., 2016), albeit such approaches are yet undergoing computational optimisations (Kovaka et al., 2020; Payne et al., 2020).\n\nOur results show that it would already be theoretically feasible to obtain meaningful river microbiota from > 100 barcoded samples on a single nanopore flow cell, thereby enabling water monitoring projects involving large collections at costs below £20 per sample (Supplementary file 6). In line with this, ONT has already released several commercial 96-barcode multiplexing kits for PCR- and non-PCR-based applications, as well as the smaller ‘Flongle’ flow cell with considerably reduced cost as compared to the traditional MinION model. On the other hand, shotgun nanopore sequencing approaches may bypass pitfalls associated with amplicon sequencing, namely taxon-specific primer biases (Frank et al., 2008), 16S rRNA copy number fluctuations between species (Darby et al., 2013) or the omission of functionally relevant sequence elements. In combination with sampling protocol adjustments, shotgun nanopore sequencing could moreover be used for the serial monitoring of eukaryotic microorganisms and viruses in freshwater ecosystems (Reddington et al., 2020).\n\nSince the commercial launch of the MinION in 2015, a wide set of microbial nanopore sequencing applications in the context of rRNA gene (Benítez-Páez et al., 2016; Cuscó et al., 2018; Kerkhof et al., 2017; Nygaard et al., 2020) and shotgun (Leggett et al., 2020; Nicholls et al., 2019; Reddington et al., 2020; Stewart et al., 2019) metagenomics have attracted the interest of a growing user community. Two independent case studies have recently provided decomposition analyses of faecal bacterial pathogens in MinION libraries derived from river and spring waters in Montana, USA (Hamner et al., 2019) and Kathmandu Valley, Nepal (Acharya et al., 2019). Although it is to be expected that short-read metagenomics technology continues to provide valuable environmental insights, as illustrated through global cataloguing efforts of ocean (Tara Oceans coordinators et al., 2015) and wastewater (Global Water Microbiome Consortium et al., 2019) microbiomes, due to their large sizes and fixed costs these traditional platforms remain unfeasible for the monitoring of remote environments – especially in low-resource settings. We reason that the convenience of MinION handling and complementary development of portable DNA purification methods (Boykin et al., 2019; Gowers et al., 2019) will allow for such endeavours to become increasingly accessible to citizens and public health organisations around the world, ultimately democratising the opportunities and benefits of DNA sequencing."
