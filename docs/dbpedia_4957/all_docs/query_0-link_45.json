        "text": "B. Potential for distant site toxicity\n\nAn obvious requirement for any formaldehyde-induced inhalation effects other than those that result from direct contact with the eyes or upper respiratory tract is the necessity for absorption and transport to distant sites. This issue has substantial implications for assessing whether inhaled formaldehyde would be capable of causing leukemia, which requires, at a minimum, that it reaches the blood or bone marrow to initiate this disease. Although there is no detectable increase in endogenous formaldehyde blood concentrations following inhalation exposure to formaldehyde, recent evaluations by both IARC (2009) and NTP (2009) have raised questions concerning this issue as it might pertain to distant site toxicity. Particularly with respect to explaining the biological basis for formaldehyde-induced leukemia, the potential for distant site toxicity (which would be obligatory for this disease) is based on a few publications (i.e., Zhang et al., 2009, 2010) hypothesizing that inhaled formaldehyde can increase endogenous free formaldehyde (i.e., gaseous) levels in the blood, with subsequent distant site toxicity. As a consequence, it is postulated that increased free formaldehyde can lead to adverse effects, either directly on the bone marrow or on circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) or stem cells, leading to myelotoxicity, decreased circulating red and white blood cells (i.e., pancytopenia), and ultimately leukemia. In conjunction with the epidemiology data, the conclusion that inhaled formaldehyde can raise endogenous levels with deleterious consequences to the hematopoietic system played a role in the decisions by both IARC and NTP to elevate formaldehyde from a probable or reasonably anticipated carcinogen to a known human carcinogen.\n\nFollowing inhalation exposure to formaldehyde, the key hypothesis pertaining to formaldehyde-induced leukemia involves absorption and transport of exogenous formaldehyde to the bone marrow, with subsequent myelotoxicity, and/or direct interaction (i.e., mutation) in the circulation with susceptible stem cells, with the “transformed” cells traveling to the bone marrow to initiate the leukemogenic process. In support of this hypotheses, Zhang et al. (2009, 2010) describe how gaseous formaldehyde in the presence of water (from the blood) dissolves and is converted to its hydrated form, methanediol [CH2(OH)2] (also known as methylene glycol) and therefore could potentially reach the bone marrow in this form, i.e., “…methandiol…which can readily penetrate into tissues, may travel to the marrow through the blood where it is in equilibrium with reactive formaldehyde. The formaldehyde, once generated, can react with cellular macromolecules producing toxic injury.” An almost identical statement appears in the IARC's (2009) recent deliberations, “In aqueous solution, formaldehyde is rapidly converted to its diol form, methanediol (formaldehyde hydrate, CH2(OH)2 or methylene glycol), and a dynamic equiblirium with formaldehyde is formed. The concentration of the diol versus that of formaldehyde depends on the precise conditions (temperature, pH, formaldehyde concentration) under which the reaction occurs…. Importantly, methanediol, with a molecular weight of only 48, can readily penetrate into tissues (Fox, 1985). Thus, formaldehyde may reach the marrow through the blood as methanediol, where it equilibrates again to reactive formaldehyde. The formaldehyde, once regenerated, can react with cellular macromolecules producing toxic injury.” In addition, NTP (2009) also describes a similar logic involving methanediol to help explain how a reactive chemical such as formaldehyde can be distributed and undergo metabolism throughout the body, also citing Fox et al. (1985) as well as Matubayasi et al. (2007). The cited basis for methanediol as a way for formaldehyde to be distributed to distant sites is a publication by Fox et al. (1985) on the use of 4% formaldehyde solutions for tissue fixation. At this concentration, formaldehyde rapidly penetrates dead tissues to denature and cross-link proteins, thereby also arresting enzymatic degradation. However, such a comparison, primarily extrapolating an event in non-living tissue at a high concentration of formaldehyde to living tissue, in vivo, at low concentration is suspect. Hypothesizing about the biological activity of formaldehyde based on tissue fixing concentrations of 4% (i.e., 40,000 ppm) to normal endogenous concentrations of 2-3 ppm, which are at least 10,000 times lower, is questionable. The paper by Matubayasi et al. (2007) also has no relevance to biological systems, since it is about the formaldehyde/methanediol equilibrium at varying temperatures and concludes that in hot water (≈200°C), the equilibrium is shifted toward free formaldehyde. Because formaldehyde in its hydrated form (i.e., methanediol) is already present in the blood, it has penetrated every tissue in the body due to its ubiquitous presence.\n\n1. Formaldehyde kinetics\n\nThe hypothesis implying that the formaldehyde-methanediol equilibrium is inexplicably disrupted at distant sites, thereby leading to release of free formaldehyde, which then causes adverse effects illustrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the well-established kinetics of formaldehyde. Gaseous formaldehyde, as a non-hydrated aldehyde, predominates only in the air phase. Whether in the extracellular spaces or within cells, free formaldehyde will be present at extremely low concentrations, since it first reacts reversibly with water to form an acetal (i.e., a more chemically correct designation of the hydrated form than methanediol) and then interacts with glutathione (GSH) to form a thioacetal. The equilibrium constant for the acetal versus free formaldehyde strongly favors the acetal by a factor of approximately 7000. In other words, at physiological temperature and pH, >99.9% of formaldehyde is present as methanediol, with <0.1% as free formaldehyde. Consequently, the assertions by Zhang et al. (2010) and IARC (2009) are not consistent with formaldehyde kinetics, as neither the acetal (methanediol) nor the thioacetal represents ways in which inhaled gaseous formaldehyde could travel through the circulation and reach distant tissues. Consequently, it is unknown (and not explained by Zhang et al., 2009, 2010; IARC, 2009; or NTP, 2009) how this equilibrium would be disrupted either in the circulation or at distant sites to release free formaldehyde to adversely affect blood cells or the bone marrow. Because explanations about how this might occur conflicts with the well-established biological and chemical behavior of formaldehyde, the hypothesized leukemogenic events appear to be unlikely in biological systems.\n\nThere is also another practical aspect of this issue that needs to be addressed. Any explanation of how inhaled formaldehyde might increase endogenous concentrations (e.g., methanediol releasing free formaldehyde at distant sites) would have to overcome a large body of data demonstrating that due to the prodigious metabolic capacity of animals and humans, exogenous formaldehyde quite simply cannot raise endogenous levels. As explained by Heck and Casanova (2004), “An adult man… would absorb 30 μg formaldehyde per minute if the formaldehyde concentration were 2 ppm. Assuming that 93% of the inhaled formaldehyde is eliminated by saturable metabolism in the respiratory tract as calculated for both rats and monkeys… the maximum amount of residual formaldehyde that would be available for distribution to other tissues would be 7%…. If the residual formaldehyde were unmetabolized and distributed to total body water (41L), its maximum concentration after 8 h would be less than 0.001 mM, which is well below the concentration of endogenous formaldehyde in human blood (-0.1 mM). Of course, metabolism in the blood and tissues would greatly reduce the actual concentration of residual formaldehyde in total body water. Therefore, inhaled formaldehyde would not be expected to increase the formaldehyde concentration in the blood in accordance with the empirical results.” The empirical results referenced refer to studies in rats, monkeys, and humans demonstrating that inhaled formaldehyde does not change endogenous concentrations (Casanova et al., 1988; Heck et al., 1985. The above description was confirmed by Franks (2004) who developed a mathematical model for the absorption and metabolism of formaldehyde vapor by humans. This model, which accounted for numerous physiological parameters, including interfacing between air/mucus, mucous/epithelial tissues and blood, the calculations indicated that inhalation of formaldehyde at 1.9 ppm would lead to a predicted increase of 0.00044 mg/L in blood concentrations, which is well below measured endogenous levels. Consequently, based on measurement as well as dosimetry modeling, there is no evidence that inhaled formaldehyde can increase the endogenous levels found in the blood.\n\nA tissue-based pharmacokinetic (PK) model estimated various forms of tissue formaldehyde (i.e., free and formaldehyde acetal [i.e., methanediol]) and tissue glutathione (GSH) in conjunction with a 13-week toxicogenomic study in rats exposed to formaldehyde at 0, 0.7, 2, 6, 10, or 15 ppm for 6 hours/day for 1, 4, or 13 weeks (Andersen et al., 2010). The pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the lower two inhaled formaldehyde concentrations (0.7 and 2 ppm) would result in only minor changes in cellular GSH and formaldehyde acetal. However, at exposures above 4 ppm, formaldehyde acetal increased with a much steeper dose-response, whereas free GSH was significantly reduced. The model was also used to estimate the dose-response of formaldehyde acetal in relation to inhaled formaldehyde accounting for endogenous formaldehyde and showed that exposures in the range of 1-2 ppm would not be sufficient to cause significant increases in tissue formaldehyde compared to background in the normal tissues of the nose. This model is the first to describe background production of formaldehyde by normal physiological processes, the associated GSH status, and increases in tissue formaldehyde acetal that would be expected following inhalation of various formaldehyde concentrations. As noted by Andersen et al. (2010), “Research on [formaldehyde] histopathology, gene expression, and now with PK modeling of endogenous [formaldehyde] is consistent with a threshold for carcinogenicity and tissue responses to this endogenous aldehyde” This PK tissue model further demonstrates the substantial degree to which the kinetics and dose-response characteristics of inhaled formaldehyde can be modeled and understood in biological systems.\n\n2. Stable isotope studies with inhaled 13CD2-formaldehyde\n\nThe unlikelihood of exogenous formaldehyde entering the blood with transport to distant sites is now further supported by a recent study by Lu et al. (2010a) in which male F344 rats were exposed to 10 ppm of the stable isotope 13CD2-formaldehyde for 1 or 5 days (6 hours/day). Following the 1- or 5-day exposures, blood was collected for lymphocyte isolation as well as tissue samples from nasal respiratory epithelium, spleen, thymus, lung, and liver; bone marrow was collected from both femurs. DNA adducts from all tissues were subsequently prepared for analysis. Because of the slight mass differences between DNA adducts derived from exogenous (i.e., 13CD2-formaldehyde) compared to DNA adducts derived from endogenous (i.e., 12C-formaldehyde), the source of form-aldehyde-DNA adducts detected in each tissue could be determined. Whereas formaldehyde-DNA adducts from both endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde were detected in nasal epithelium after either 1 or 5 days of exposure, no 13CD2-formaldehyde-DNA adducts were detected in any tissue distal to the nasal epithelium, including the lung, spleen, liver, thymus, bone marrow, or lymphocytes. As described by the authors, “The absence of exogenous formaldehyde-induced DNA adducts and crosslinks in other tissues supports the conclusion that genotoxic effects of inhaled formaldehyde are implausible at sites remote to the portal-of-entry.” In addition, with respect to the issue concerning methanediol as an explanation for transport of inhaled formaldehyde to distant sites, Lu et al. (2010a) addressed this as well, “Furthermore, by monitoring the transitions that would occur if there was any hydrogen-deuterium exchange, we have demonstrated that neither inhaled formaldehyde, nor methanediol derived from inhaled formaldehyde reaches sites distant to the portal of entry.” These findings, particularly the inability to detect 13CD2 -formaldehyde-DNA adducts in white blood cells or bone marrow, have substantial implications with respect to the likelihood of formaldehyde-induced leukemia as a consequence of either effects on circulating stem or hematopoietic progenitor cells or distant site toxicity.\n\nThe above findings have now been extended to non-human primates. A study by Moeller et al. (2010) determined the presence of endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde in DNA from bone marrow of cynomolgus macaques exposed to 1.9 and 6.1 ppm of 13CD2-formaldehyde for 6 hours a day for 2 consecutive days. In bone marrow, no exogenous adducts were detected, even though ∼10-fold larger amounts of DNA were analyzed to intentionally bias the results toward detecting such adducts. However, endogenous N2hydroxymethyl-dG adducts were present at 17.48±2.61 and 12.43±3.63 adducts/107 dG in bone marrow DNA from the 1.9 and 6.1 ppm exposures, respectively. This study confirms the findings by Lu et al. (2010a) in a non-human primate and further demonstrates that inhaled formaldehyde is not delivered to tissue sites distal to the nasal epithelium. Since additional tissues from numerous sites distant to the point of contact were collected at necropsy, these will be analyzed in a future paper to better characterize the distribution of exogenous and endogenous formaldehyde-DNA adducts in non-human primates following formaldehyde inhalation exposure.\n\nThe substantial understanding of formaldehyde kinetics and toxicogenomics in the upper respiratory tract plays an important supporting role in subsequent discussions of sensory irritation as well as both nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia. This body of data informs both local effects in nasal epithelial tissues as well as the likelihood of formaldehyde delivery to distant sites.\n\nA. Fundamental aspects of odor detection and sensory irritation\n\nThe most common effects from exposure to formaldehyde vapor involve sensory irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat when sufficient concentrations are reached, with eye irritation generally accepted as the most sensitive endpoint. Although the ability of formaldehyde to cause or exacerbate asthma symptoms is also of concern, this is addressed separately as an important related issue of whether children might be more sensitive than adults to formaldehyde-related sensory irritation. With respect to formaldehyde-induced sensory irritation, this phenomenon involves a dose-response continuum in which low levels begin to trigger the sensory nerves, but the rate of removal (i.e., detoxification) of formaldehyde from tissues in the nose and upper airways is sufficient to limit accumulation and prevent tissue damage. As exposure concentrations increase, compensation and repair mechanisms will be progressively overwhelmed with an increasing likelihood of adverse effects. The continuum of effects due to increasing formaldehyde concentrations can be broken down into those associated first with odor detection, followed by sensory irritation and associated upper respiratory tract endpoints when progressing to higher concentrations and effects such as frank tissue damage and nasal tumors, which are discussed later in this review. Consequently, it is important to determine the concentration(s) of formaldehyde that can reliably be associated with causing the symptoms of sensory irritation as distinct from (i.e., unconfounded) odor detection.\n\nAlthough there is a large database in rodent studies characterizing the sensory irritation effects of formaldehyde (e.g., Nielsen et al., 1999; Alarie and Anderson, 1979; Anderson et al., 1979; Kane and Alarie, 1977), these data are not reviewed or relied upon in this evaluation. Although such data provide valuable insights on formaldehyde and potential interactive effects with other irritant chemicals, the documented respiratory differences between rats (obligatory nose breathers) and humans (oronasal breathing) render the findings from such studies of limited relevance. Furthermore, the availability of numerous controlled human studies makes reliance on animal data unnecessary for evaluating this endpoint.\n\nFormaldehyde can be a strongly irritating gas at specific concentrations and also has a distinct, pungent smell. However, odor perception and the threshold for sensory irritation are sometimes not clearly differentiated and generally exist on a concentration gradient, but may overlap, i.e., some individuals may detect the odor before perceiving eye irritation or vice versa. In the case of formaldehyde, however, the progression of responses is clear, with human studies showing that for most individuals, odor perception generally precedes sensory irritation. Importantly, sensory irritation and odor perception are different and distinct physiological phenomena. Odor is the sensation of smell carried by the olfactory nerve (first cranial nerve). Sensory irritation involves stimulation of the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve), and near triggering concentrations is generally considered to be a physiological and not a toxic response in that no tissue damage or cellular injury is involved (Gaffney and Paustenbach, 2007; Paustenbach and Gaffney, 2006; Dalton, 2002, 2003). This is particularly the case for formaldehyde-induced sensory irritation as discussed in this review and does not imply that formaldehyde-induced cytotoxicity does not occur at concentrations in excess of those necessary to trigger the symptoms of sensory irritation (i.e., >2ppm). Sensory irritation encompasses a graded series of responses generally categorized as ranging from slight to moderate to severe. For formaldehyde, eye irritation is generally the most sensitive indicator of exposure and represents the threshold response for sensory irritation. At higher exposure levels, stimulation of the trigeminal nerves in the nasal passages and the upper respiratory tract represents the next step of sensory irritation (i.e., nose and throat irritation) (Paustenbach et al., 1997). This would be followed by frank tissue damage (i.e., cytotoxicity) at sufficient concentrations.\n\nThere are various reports of different odor thresholds (i.e., the minimum level that can be detected), with a typical range of 0.5 to 1 ppm (ATSDR, 1999; US EPA, 2006c). Although some documents list odor thresholds at lower levels, these are likely to be obfuscated by the same accuracy issues (i.e., false positives) as for sensory irritation. For example, a guidance document (US Coast Guard, 2001) notes that the odor threshold for formaldehyde is 0.8 ppm, but also states that persons with sensitive noses can detect it at levels as low as 0.1 ppm. Although it is likely that some highly sensitive individuals can detect the odor of formaldehyde at levels below 0.5 ppm, there are no empirical data (e.g., human volunteer chamber studies) documenting that humans can reliably detect formaldehyde at levels of 0.1 ppm or less. However, it is possible that people with a diminished ability to detect odors could still have symptoms of sensory irritation without detecting the pungent odor of formaldehyde. Finally, it is important to note that olfaction of formaldehyde does not imply that any adverse effects are triggered, including the onset of sensory irritation (Gaffney and Paustenbach, 2007; Paustenbach and Gaffney, 2006; Dalton, 2002, 2003).\n\nMost of the early studies that investigated the irritant properties of formaldehyde did not properly account for the characteristic acrid or pungent odor. The ability of most individuals to detect the odor of formaldehyde is typically more sensitive than the lowest exposure level that produces the symptoms of sensory irritation. Therefore, studies designed to evaluate the irritation threshold must account for the odor of formaldehyde by masking it with an odoriferous but non-irritating substance, such as methylmercaptan, in order for the study results to be valid. Failure to do so raises the likelihood that subjects will confuse the odor with symptoms of sensory irritation (Lang et al., 2008). Without accounting for the confounding effects of odor, some early, largely uncontrolled, studies suggested that sensory irritation from formaldehyde was on the order of less than 0.01 ppm (10 ppb). Those studies did not control for the misinterpretation of odor detection as sensory irritation (Abraham, 2001) or for behavioral sensitization to the odor of formaldehyde (and other highly odoriferous compounds), which confounds the study of other properties of these compounds such as sensory irritation (Shusterman et al., 1988). Properly conducted studies, using appropriate controls, have more accurately determined the ability of humans to detect the odor of formaldehyde. These studies have failed to confirm the ability of even the most sensitive individual to detect exceedingly low concentrations of formaldehyde. For example, ATSDR (2008) lists the lower level of odor detection as 0.5 ppm. This level has been confirmed by a number of human volunteer chamber studies, which have placed significant emphasis on removing the odor bias associated with formaldehyde exposure (Iwasaki and Ishiguro, 1978; Leonardos et al., 1969; Hellman and Small, 1974).\n\nLike the majority of other odoriferous compounds, formaldehyde has an odor threshold that is typically less than its irritant threshold. This has been confirmed by a number of studies that have examined the ability of several groups to detect irritation (e.g., Arts et al., 2008). The conjunctiva is the most sensitive structure in the upper airway, so it is generally used as the test organ. In those studies in which both the detection and irritant levels were evaluated, the detection (odor) was always lower than the irritant level. For example, Noisel et al. (2007) reported an odor detection level of 0.75 ppm, with a minimum irritant level of 1.0 ppm, whereas an US EPA (2005) study reported an odor detection level of 0.5 ppm (consistent with ASTDR), with a minimum irritant level of 1.5 ppm.\n\nD. Exposure-response characterization of formaldehyde-induced sensory irritation\n\nIt has long been appreciated that workplace exposure to sufficient levels of formaldehyde was associated with sensory irritation. However, with regulations in place to protect against such effects, the focus on non-occupational exposures has been more recent. Part of the initial rationale for the study of the possible adverse health effects of formaldehyde from exposure in the indoor residential environment began in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a result of the increased use of urea-formaldehyde foam insulation in homes and the use of formaldehyde-containing glues and adhesives in composite wood panels and particle board used in manufactured housing. This change in practice led to numerous studies all directed at determining the concentrations of formaldehyde at which the symptoms of sensory irritation occurred, with the goal of first understanding exposure-response relationships and then using such data to establish exposure levels that would be protective for the most sensitive members of the population. These studies fall into several broad categories, including workplace, community (i.e., residential), and controlled chamber studies.\n\n1. Occupational and residential exposure studies\n\nWith respect to workplace studies, many (and quite possibly most or all) are confounded to varying degrees by mixed exposures to wood dust, terpenes, and other airborne substances (e.g., Alexandersson and Hedenstierna, 1989); furniture lacquers, textiles, paint, plywood, polyethylene, and chipboard that contained formaldehyde (e.g., Nordman et al., 1985); or particulates, phenol, sodium hydroxide, and carbon monoxide (e.g., Horvath et al., 1988). Similarly, studies investigating pulmonary function or nasal epithelial lesions (i.e., cytotoxicity such as squamous metaplasia or dysplasia) are also often confounded by simultaneous exposure to particulates (and typically other chemicals as well), which may change the dynamics of detoxification and respiratory tract penetration due to surface adsorption/desorption. For example, as noted by ATSDR (1999), “Effect levels associated with formaldehyde-induced changes in pulmonary function variables in workers exposed to airborne formaldehyde concentrations generally less than 1 ppm…are not of sufficient magnitude to be of obvious clinical significance, have not been observed consistently across studies, and may be confounded, in some cases, by the presence of wood dust particulates which may facilitate transport of adsorbed formaldehyde to deeper regions of the respiratory tract compared with low-level exposure to formaldehyde alone.”\n\nEven in the studies in which mild nasal epithelial lesions have been observed in formaldehyde-exposed workers, there are questions concerning potential confounders that make it difficult to attribute reported effects to formaldehyde alone. Examples of such confounded studies include Ballarin et al. (1992)—wood dust, no exposure-response relationship; Boysen et al. (1990)—wood dust exposure for some workers and exposures to >2ppm formaldehyde (not further quantified) for almost a quarter of the cohort; Edling et al. (1988)—smoking, wood dust exposure for some workers, unknown numbers of peak exposures up to 5 ppm and no exposure-response relationship; and Holmstrom et al. (1989)—wood dust, resin exposure, smoking, and lack of exposure-response relationship.\n\nSimilarly, most studies conducted in residential dwellings (including both conventional homes as well as manufactured housing such as trailers and mobile homes) with the goal of assessing potential formaldehyde-related effects on sensory irritation are also typically confounded by co-exposures to active smoking, environmental tobacco smoke, volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), smoke from wood fires, cooking fumes, house dust, pet dander, molds, fungi, etc. These co-exposures make it impossible to conclude with confidence that any results reported are due solely to formaldehyde. In addition, the results of some residential and/or community studies can also be confounded by selection bias (e.g., offers of free testing due to adverse publicity, emotional media stories, etc.), which can be substantially influenced by false-positive results (i.e., reporting of symptoms in the absence of formaldehyde or at concentrations insufficient to elicit symptoms [e.g., Main et al., 1983; Bracken et al., 1985; Kilburn et al., 1985; Imbus et al., 1985; Anderson et al., 1979; Ritchie and Lehnen, 1987]).\n\nA striking example of these issues is illustrated by a study that actually tested whether effects attributed to formaldehyde in a residential setting might be confounded by other exposures and/or psychological factors. Broder et al. (1991) investigated a large group of about 200 control homes and 600 houses that had been insulated with urea formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) and then, due to complaints and government-provided subsidies for UFFI removal, about half of the UFFI houses were remediated to remove the insulation. Each of the houses and occupants were investigated on two occasions separated by an interval of 12 months. In the first survey of the population, prior to remedial work, there was a moderate excess of many signs and symptoms of irritation, including nasal problems, eye, throat discomfort, cough, headache, and dizziness. These symptoms were associated with an exposure-response relationship between formaldehyde levels in the UFFI homes (0.046 ppm), but no such relationship in control homes (0.035 ppm). In the second survey conducted in controls and houses following UFFI removal, there was an appreciable reduction in the reported incidence of irritation symptoms and the disappearance of the exposure-response relationship, even though the remediation efforts had no effect on formaldehyde levels in the remediated homes (0.044 ppm). The authors concluded that the symptoms in the initial survey were not due to formaldehyde alone and that their observations were “…indicative of the complexities that may arise in assessing and understanding health risks…related to chemicals in indoor air”\n\nDespite the problems and issues with these studies, they are still inexplicably relied upon for health-based conclusions concerning formaldehyde levels in indoor air. For example, a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2008) addressed a number of issues pertaining to formaldehyde concentrations in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) trailers. In reaching conclusions about the formaldehyde concentrations that might be associated with symptoms of sensory irritation, none of the studies cited were those involving controlled human exposures. Instead, this report concluded that“… formaldehyde-sensitive persons have reported symptoms at levels around 100 ppb” citing Main and Hogan (1983) and Bender et al. (1983), and that “Additional studies have found health effects at 100 ppb in sensitive persons chronically exposed to formaldehyde” citing Ritchie and Lehnen (1987). It is illustrative to compare the rigor of studies relied upon by CDC to the controlled human exposure studies.\n\nMain and Hogan (1983) involved a symptom survey of 21 subjects who worked in two trailers where formaldehyde levels between 0.12 and 1.6ppm had been measured. Because of this study's design, it is not possible to ascertain whether any reported symptoms were the result of exposure to 0.12 ppm (or any other specific concentration) and “formaldehyde-sensitive persons” are never addressed. The study by Bender et al. (1983) was obviously erroneously cited as evidence that symptoms can occur in formaldehyde-sensitive persons at levels around 100 ppb. This study is one of the earliest controlled human volunteer chamber studies, testing responses to formaldehyde at concentrations of 0.35, 0.56, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.0 ppm; 100 ppb (i.e., 0.1 ppm) was not tested. Severity of response rated above “slight” occurred only at the highest test concentration of 1.0 ppm and, as noted by the authors, “These data agree with other reported studies in which eye irritation occurred between 0.4 and 1.0ppm rather than those which report eye irritation at extremely low levels but where other irritants may have been present”\n\nThe study by Ritchie and Lehnen (1987) was conducted in response to widespread publicity and subsequent offers of free formaldehyde testing. The study involved a survey of approximately 2000 people living in conventional and mobile homes where formaldehyde concentrations were measured in air samples taken from two rooms in each residence. The percentages of subjects with eye irritation, nose/throat irritation, headaches, and skin rash were recorded for homes with formaldehyde concentrations classified as “low” (<0.1ppm), “medium” (0.1 ppm to <0.3 ppm), or “high” (>0.3 ppm). In both conventional and mobile homes with air concentrations >0.3ppm, more than 60% of subjects reported eye irritation, nose/throat irritation, or headache; with air concentrations between 0.1 and 0.3 ppm, respective reporting percentages ranged from 10% to 20% for eye irritation, 15% to 20% for nose/throat irritation, and 20% to 25% for headache. Based on the controlled human exposure studies, the reported responses between 0.1 and 0.3ppm would be difficult to distinguish from false positives (i.e., exposure to Oppm formaldehyde). At concentrations <0.1ppm, less than 10% reported effects for each of these three symptoms. This study has several limitations, including (1) the participants, in order to be eligible for the study, had already complained about symptoms and were a self-selected group with a potential bias; and (2) there is no way to know what the actual formaldehyde exposure levels >0.3ppm might have been because no such data were provided. The most substantial limitation of the study, and the one that raises questions about the reported results as they pertain to potential sensory irritation at formaldehyde levels of <0.1 ppm or between 0.1 and 0.3ppm, is the strong likelihood that some unknown number of the reported effects could have been false positives. In fact, this study appears to validate the documented incidence of 20-30% false positives described below at formaldehyde exposure levels of < 1.0 ppm, with about 10% reporting symptoms at <0.1 ppm and 10-20% reporting symptoms at 0.1-0.3 ppm.\n\nWith respect to studies conducted in residential settings, a NAS (2007) committee expressed skepticism about the use of such studies rather than those conducted under controlled conditions, “One of the largest studies involved nearly 2,000 residents of 397 mobile homes and 494 conventional homes (Ritchie and Lehnen, 1987). Participants were not selected randomly; they responded to a free testing service for formaldehyde, which was offered to individuals by the state of Minnesota when an examining physician made a written request. Thus, those recruited in the study had complained of symptoms thought to be related to airborne formaldehyde exposures” [emphasis added]. The other studies cited by CDC (2008) as the basis for conclusions on sensory irritation at a formaldehyde level of 100 ppb have similar confounding issues.\n\n2.Controlled human exposure chamber studies\n\nWere the above types of studies the only data available (despite their obvious limitations) for deriving a weight of evidence-based concentration that would be protective for even the most sensitive individuals, such data would necessarily have to be relied upon. Fortunately, however, the availability of numerous controlled chamber studies using human volunteers (often including sensitive individuals and asthmatics as well as excluding insensitive individuals such as smokers or non-responders at formaldehyde levels that produced eye irritation in other volunteers) provides a far more appropriate data set for assessing the exposure concentrations of formaldehyde required to elicit the symptoms of sensory irritation, in the absence of confounding by potential co-exposures to any other substances. At least 20 published studies or critical reviews of such studies of respiratory function and/or irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat in human volunteers are available that involve controlled exposure to formaldehyde, generally at concentrations up to 3 ppm or greater (e.g., Andersen, 1979; Andersen and Molhave, 1983; Bender et al., 1983; Day et al., 1984; Gorski et al., 1992; Green, 1987; Krakowiak et al., 1998; Kulle, 1993; Kulle et al., 1987; Lang et al., 2008; Pazdrak et al., 1993; Schachter, 1986, 1987; Weber-Tschopp et al., 1977; Witek, 1987). This large body of data, now relied upon by numerous regulatory and authoritative bodies worldwide, permits a more accurate assessment of formaldehyde concentrations associated or not associated with sensory irritation than workplace or residential studies. These data will be helpful in assessing whether an empirically based exposure concentration protective for sensory irritation would be protective for more serious effects such as cancer and formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors for which mode-of-action data demonstrate a threshold concentration for such effects.\n\nControlled chamber studies expose human volunteers to known concentrations of formaldehyde, with the best of these studies including clean air controls (i.e., 0 ppm formaldehyde), in order to unequivocally determine the air concentrations of formaldehyde that can reliably elicit symptoms of sensory irritation in the absence of any potential confounders. Some of these studies have also masked the odor of formaldehyde in order to eliminate odor alone as the “cause” of symptoms of sensory irritation. In an extensive review, Paustenbach et al. (1997) convened a panel of experts who evaluated approximately 150 studies, 52 of which were human studies with 10 of greatest relevance for establishing a concentration-response relationship for sensory irritation. As discussed in this review, “The panel concluded that for most persons, eye irritation clearly due to formaldehyde does not occur until at least 1.0 ppm. Information from controlled studies involving volunteers indicated that moderate to severe eye, nose, and throat irritation does not occur for most persons until airborne concentrations exceed 2.0-3.O ppm…. Based on the weight of evidence from published studies, the panel found that persons exposed to 0.3 ppm for 4-6h in chamber studies generally reported eye irritation at a rate no different than that observed when persons were exposed to clean air.” This conclusion is notable because all subsequent independent reviews, which incorporate additional controlled human studies performed since Paustenbach (1997), have reached essentially identical conclusions.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Screening Information Data Set (OECD/SIDS, 2002) concluded, “Studies in the literature have reported a variety of responses induced by exposure to gaseous formaldehyde, generally beginning in the range of 0.3 to 0.5ppm for eye irritation, the most sensitive end-point. However, the severity of response at these levels is generally mild, and only a small portion of the population may respond.” Moderate eye, nose, and throat irritation occurs at 2 to 3 ppm. The majority of critical assessments of formaldehyde levels that would be protective for the symptoms of sensory irritation for all individuals, including those with self-reported sensitivity to formaldehyde as well as asthmatics, support a lowest effective irritant concentration of 0.3 ppm ( ).\n\nTable 1\n\nFormaldehyde air concentration (ppm)SourceComment/observation6-15Monticello et al. 1996; Kerns et al. 1983a, b;Chronic inhalation dose range required for the sustained cytotoxicity and regenerative proliferation leading to development of nasal tumors.1.0TNO, 2003; Arts et al., 2006“..… minimal/mild/slight eye irritation starts at levels of 1.0 ppm formaldehyde and higher.”0.9EPA, 2004; Acute exposure guideline level (AEGL)“At 0.35 to 0.9 ppm, the subject's subjective eye irritation responses ranged from none to slight, the same as their responses to clean air.”0.75OSHA, 2006; (Occupational exposure standard) Noisel et al. 2007In effect for many years with no evidence of significant worker complaints of sensory irritation. “The level of 0.75 ppm can be considered as a safe level that allows protecting virtually all workers.”Noisel et al.

False positives in formaldehyde-induced sensory irritation\n\nA crucial distinction between controlled studies and those where responses are simply reported based on ambient exposure levels (whatever they might be) is that it is difficult (if not impossible) to reliably determine whether formaldehyde actually causes irritation at levels below about 1 ppm. This is because when some people are intentionally exposed to air with formaldehyde levels below 1 ppm and some are exposed to clean air (i.e., formaldehyde-free), 20-30% of those exposed to clean air will still report responses of sensory irritation (i.e., false positives) (Bender, 2002; OECD/SIDS, 2002). For example, after reviewing this large body of data, the Australian government (NICNAS, 2006) determined that “…chamber studies also found that some individuals begin to sense irritation from 0.5 ppm (0.6 mg/m3), although the response rate is often similar to that reported in controls. There is limited evidence that some individuals report sensory irritation as low as 0.25 ppm (0.3 mg/m3), however, the data is very unreliable. Therefore, the lowest observed effect level (LOEL) is considered to be 0.5 ppm.” Although there are no data specifically identifying different formaldehyde concentrations below 1 ppm and the associated frequencies of false-positive reports of sensory irritation, it appears reasonable that such reports would be greater at 0.1 ppm than at 0.3 ppm, the consensus level below which sensory irritation is unlikely to occur. This is why, for example, that the residential studies that report unequivocal symptoms of sensory irritation at 0.1 ppm, but lack a clean air control (e.g., Ritchie and Lehnen, 1987; Main and Hogan, 1983), do not provide a credible basis for drawing conclusions concerning airborne concentrations of formaldehyde that might be associated with sensory irritation.\n\nE. Sensory irritation effects in children and other potentially sensitive individuals\n\nAlthough almost all of the data on sensory irritation have been derived from studies in adults, there is limited evidence available to determine whether infants or children are either more or less susceptible to the irritant effects of formaldehyde than adults. Although differences between children and adults have been documented for absorption, metabolism, and excretion of potentially toxic substances (ILSI, 1992), such considerations are less relevant to a sensory irritant such as formaldehyde because there is no appreciable difference in the targets for irritation (i.e., eyes, nose, or throat) between children and adults. As concluded by ATSDR (1999), “Whereas there are numerous studies of adults occupationally exposed to formaldehyde and exposed under acute controlled conditions, data regarding the toxicological properties of formaldehyde in children are limited. Nevertheless, the same type of effects that occur in adults are expected to occur in children…. Symptoms expected to occur in children include eye, nose, and throat irritation from exposure to airborne concentrations between 0.4 and 3 ppm…”\n\nIn an extensive review of upper respiratory tract and eye irritation effects of volatile chemicals by a group of experts, greater susceptibility among children was not mentioned (Doty et al., 2004). In another study by Meininghaus et al. (2003), sensory irritation was reported in school children. The airborne levels of several respiratory irritants were measured (e.g., SO2, ammonia, acetic acid, formic acid, hexanal, butanal, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde). Formaldehyde air concentrations were between 20 and 25μg/m3 (17 and 21 ppb). Interestingly, the reported symptoms (i.e., dry sensation of the eyes, irritation of the upper respiratory tract, headache, and a rough tongue) were initially reported by adults (teachers) and it was only after those reports that several children complained about similar symptoms, suggesting either a higher sensitivity in adults than in children or possibly adult responses influencing children's responses. With respect to this latter issue, the authors concluded that psychological factors (e.g., increased attention from authorities, the presence of “experts” and sampling equipment, and a strong group behavior) may have resulted in individuals paying more attention to health effects related to sensory irritation. Also notable in these studies is that exposure involved a complex mixture of chemicals, which makes it difficult to attribute reported effects to a single chemical.\n\nKrzyzanowski et al. (1990) compared the sensitivity of children and adults to formaldehyde-induced effects on chronic respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function, reporting a greater prevalence of asthma and chronic bronchitis in children whose houses had 60-120 ppb of formaldehyde. Researchers questioned a group of 298 children (ages 6 to 15) and 613 adults using a self-administered respiratory questionnaire and found no significant association between exposures in children and self-reported chronic respiratory symptoms. More than 83% of the subjects in the study lived in homes in which the 2-week average formaldehyde concentrations were less than 40 ppb. The average concentration measured was 26 ppb, with only a few homes exceeding 90 ppb, indicating that the average concentrations appear to have been driven by a few outliers. Prevalence rates of chronic bronchitis or asthma reportedly diagnosed by a physician were significantly higher when residential concentrations of formaldehyde exceeded 60 ppb, especially in the presence of tobacco smoke. Effects on peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs) were measured in children and adults and effects assessed in conjunction with formaldehyde air concentrations of <40 ppb, 40-60 ppb, and > 60 ppb. Whereas effects on PEFR in adults were transient and associated mainly in smokers, effects in children decreased linearly with formaldehyde exposure and were observed at the lowest measured concentrations, with greater effects in children with asthma. However, there was no dose-response relationship between the reported effects and formaldehyde concentrations. Since only formaldehyde and NO2 were measured in the air (with no effects from NO2 observed), the assumption that all effects can be attributed to formaldehyde alone is difficult to substantiate.\n\nIt is well documented (i.e., Garrett et al., 1998, 1999; Rumchev et al., 2002, 2004) that other substances in indoor air (e.g., VOCs and fungal spores) can cause and/or exacerbate respiratory symptoms quite apart from formaldehyde. Consequently, it is likely inappropriate to conclude that the results reported by Krzyzanowski et al. (1990) can be unequivocally attributed to formaldehyde alone in indoor air. Findings of this study (i.e., PEFRs) are questionable in view of the low levels of formaldehyde found in the homes and at odds with controlled studies where formaldehyde was the only variable (e.g., Lang et al., 2009). In addition, as in most studies of this kind, the lack of measurements of allergens or other chemical agents that may have been present in indoor air and possibly contributed to reported symptoms is a major cofounder. Although the authors did report greater changes in PEFR in children than in adults, the use of this measure does not confirm the presence or absence of asthma or bronchitis or that formaldehyde (or something else) was responsible for this finding. This is the only study suggesting differential effects in children versus adults, hardly a convincing basis for concluding that children are more sensitive to formaldehyde. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2010) derived a value of 0.08 ppm (0.125mg/m3) as a residential indoor air level for formaldehyde. In this evaluation, it was concluded that this value is also valid for children “…because there is no indication that children are more susceptible to formaldehyde exposure than adults” Nonetheless, the potential for children's greater sensitivity deserves further research.\n\nThe same holds true for other potentially sensitive populations such as the elderly or infirmed individuals who may spend the majority of their time indoors. Although certain metabolic functions decline with age (e.g., Vestal, 1982; Reaven and Reaven, 1980; Schumacher, 1980; Michielsen and Vande, 2010), thereby possibly influencing metabolism-related responses, these factors are far less likely to contribute to sensory irritation. There do not appear to be empirical data suggesting age-related changes in response to sensory irritants. Moreover, as previously discussed, time spent at a specific formaldehyde concentration does not appreciably influence the severity of the symptoms produced. As noted by NAS (2007), “Individual susceptibility to formaldehyde appears to be difficult to predict, and typically sensitive groups, such as asthmatic individuals, do not appear to be any more sensitive to irritation effects than healthy subjects at exposure concentrations below 3ppm.” That conclusion is supported by BfR (2006), “There is, however, no indication that a higher sensitivity is present for locally acting substances at the portal of entry, in particular when the effect is related to the concentration, as it is the case for formaldehyde.” As further evidence of this, in controlled studies, volunteers who claimed to be sensitive to formaldehyde eye irritation were exposed to levels of 0.35 to 1.0 ppm for 6 minutes. At formaldehyde concentrations of less than 1 ppm, eye irritation responses in sensitive test subjects were no different than with exposure to clean air, whereas at concentrations of 1 ppm, responses ranged from slight to moderate (Bender, 2002).\n\nAnother consideration for potentially sensitive individuals concerns the issue of polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH). For example, individuals with a genetic polymorphism for the slow form of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH2), which is in virtually all tissues, may be more sensitive to the irritant effects of acetaldehyde because of slower removal from upper respiratory tract tissues (Deitrich et al., 2007). This aspect of sensitivity was considered in establishing air levels in submarines for acetaldehyde by the use of an uncertainty factor of 2 (NRC, 2009). However, this situation would not appear to be relevant for formaldehyde, which is principally metabolized by a different aldehyde dehydrogenase (i.e., ADH3), for which polymorphic forms have not been identified.\n\nG. Data from which to derive an indoor air formaldehyde concentration protective for sensory irritation\n\n1. Key studies or evaluations\n\nIn 2007, testing was conducted to determine formaldehyde levels in unoccupied FEMA temporary housing units in order to assess the most effective way to ventilate these units and to identify a health-protective indoor air concentration limit for formaldehyde (ATSDR, 2007b). A target indoor air concentration of 0.3 ppm formaldehyde was selected by ATSDR because this level was “… below the level of concern for sensitive individuals of 369 ug/m3 (0.3ppm).” This empirically derived concentration (0.3 ppm) was taken from ATSDR documents and, as shown in , is the same concentration selected by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS, 2007) (and numerous other entities) as a continuous exposure guidance level (CEGL) for formaldehyde in submarines. As noted in the NAS publication, “Reported symptoms of eye and mucous membrane irritation at that concentration [i.e., 0.3 ppm] were not increased above control conditions in controlled chamber studies.” In establishing the 0.3 ppm value, both ATSDR and NAS relied on extensive human volunteer exposure data (i.e., chamber studies) as the basis for their identical determinations.\n\nThe conclusion that an exposure limit of 0.3 ppm formaldehyde in indoor air is conservative and health protective is fully supported by recent independent evaluations. For example, in an evaluation of the human data on formaldehyde a Dutch review noted that “…it can be concluded that minimal/mild/slight eye irritation starts at levels of 1.0 ppm formaldehyde and higher.” The same review also concluded that nasal and throat irritation start at formaldehyde levels of 2.0 ppm and 3.0 ppm, respectively (TNO Nutrition and Food Research, 2003). In deriving Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGLs), US EPA (2004) selected 0.9 ppm as the AEGL for an 8-hour exposure, noting that “At 0.35 to 0.9ppm, the subjects subjective eye irritation responses ranged from none to slight, the same as their responses to clean air.” As summarized in , authoritative and comprehensive reviews recognize 0.3 ppm as a prudent level of exposure to formaldehyde in indoor air, with most evaluations of the empirical evidence clustering at this value. In fact, based on human chamber studies, 0.3 ppm essentially incorporates an additional “margin of safety” of 3 because 1.0 ppm is the lowest formaldehyde exposure level for eye irritation not confounded by the likelihood of false-positive reports.\n\nIn a comprehensive review of formaldehyde-induced sensory irritation, Arts et al. (2006) evaluated 10 of the controlled human studies and the subjectively measured sensory irritation threshold levels at which effects occurred. On a normalized scale (i.e., response severity index from all studies standardized as 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) in which all available studies were similarly evaluated, mild/slight eye irritation was observed at formaldehyde levels >1 ppm, and respiratory tract irritation at levels >2 ppm. In rating studies in which sensory irritation was sufficiently described to incorporate evaluation by the benchmark dose methodology, “…it was estimated that at a level of 1 ppm, only 9.5 % of healthy volunteers experience ‘moderate’ (i.e., annoying) eye irritation (95% upper confidence limit).” It was also concluded that an important factor modulating the perception of irritation and health symptoms most likely includes the perception of odor intensity, particularly since in several studies the 0 ppm control condition was missing. This is a critical consideration because, as noted by Arts et al. (2006), “In some of the studies measuring subjective irritation in which a 0-ppm control concentration was included, a response percentage of eye irritation of up to about, 20% was found at 0 ppm. Also, nasal and/or throat irritation up to almost 30% was reported in the absence of formaldehyde…therefore, response percentages of about, 20-30%, if at all responses, should be interpreted with caution, especially in those studies in which a 0-ppm control condition is missing.”\n\nSimilarly, Noisel et al. (2007) conducted an assessment of the exposure-response relationships for the incidence of the most sensitive effects related to acute formaldehyde exposure based on a pooled analysis of 11 published controlled human studies (including healthy individuals and asthmatics). Parameters evaluated included concentration range (i.e., 0 to <0.3ppm; 0.3 to <0.75ppm; 0.75 to <1ppm; 1 to <2ppm; 2 to <3ppm;.>3ppm), site of the irritating effect (i.e., eye, nose, or throat), and degree of severity of the effect (baseline [effect in the absence of formaldehyde exposure], mild effects, moderate effects, and severe effects). As concluded by Noisel et al. (2007), “The experimental data show that there was no difference in the proportion of individuals experiencing effects between the control group without occupational exposure and groups exposed to formaldehyde concentrations under 0.75ppm. For this reason, the theoretical percentage of response attributable to formaldehyde exposure was considered to be zero for the moderate effects on the eyes, nose and throat for all the concentrations below 0.75 ppm…. According to our analysis of the defined exposure-response relationship, at concentrations below 0.75ppm, there is thus little probability for formaldehyde-induced irritation to occur…” This analysis was conducted by considering formaldehyde exposure alone and not mixed-exposure situations such as in occupational settings where formaldehyde is used and where other chemical substances (e.g., phenol, sodium hydroxide, etc.) and dusts (e.g., wood or paper dust) may also be present with irritating effects of their own.\n\nThe US EPA (US EPA/NCEA, 2005) conducted a quantitative analysis of controlled human exposure data to derive human health effects criteria for formaldehyde. Response data from six human volunteer studies comprising 250 observations and reported symptoms were categorized into the four numerical descriptors and symptoms: (0) no effect noted or reported; (1) mild signs and symptoms: irritation noticed, but not considered annoying; (2) moderate signs and symptoms: irritation annoying; and (3) severe signs and symptoms: incapacitating. From these data, a number of mathematical models were used to assess responses arriving at a conclusion that “An important advantage of this approach is that all relevant data can be used in the derivation as opposed to a NOAEL for the critical effect. The benefit of doing so allows health risks to be estimated across various exposure levels.” This approach was also endorsed by the US EPA Science Advisory Board, which observed that the process “…makes use of every bit of data available… The underlying premise of the approach is that the severity of the effect, not the specific measurement or outcome incidence, is the information needed for assessing exposure-response relationships for non-cancer endpoints…” This detailed modeling process showed a clear threshold at 0.5 ppm for any symptoms of sensory irritation and an effective concentration at 1.5 ppm for moderate effects.\n\nSome reviews concerning the issue of formaldehyde-induced sensory irritation have commented that the above-described values have been derived for short periods of time or for generally healthy individuals, with the implication that they are somehow inadequate for the general population. This erroneous assumption is based on an interpretation that such values are not sufficiently protective for longer-term exposures or for particularly sensitive individuals. However, formaldehyde-induced observed symptoms of sensory irritation are dependent on the concentration and not on the length of time (i.e., duration) of exposure as well as the fact that many of the controlled studies specifically included people who claimed to be sensitive to formaldehyde. In fact, as noted in ATSDR (2007a), the value of 0.3 ppm was considered specifically because it was below the level of concern for sensitive individuals. Even the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard of 0.75 ppm is protective for sensory irritation for individuals exposed at this level for an 8-hour work shift and there is no concept “built into” this value for a “recovery” period as is often done for other chemicals.\n\nSeveral slightly lower acceptable exposure concentrations for formaldehyde have been established (e.g., SCOEL, 0.2 ppm; BfR, 0.1 ppm; and WHO, 0.08 ppm) and although these are predominantly weight of evidence based, they incorporate an extra “margin of safety” to the derived value based on considerations other than just the concentrations eliciting the symptoms of sensory irritation. For example, the SCOEL value is based on several studies of acknowledged questionable design or reliability (i.e., lack of sham controls or inadequate study documentation). The BfR value of 0.1 ppm is not derived solely based on sensory irritation, but rather incorporates considerations of cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, and the biologically based dose-response model for nasal tumors (none of which are relevant to sensory irritation), even while acknowledging that the epidemiological findings for nasal cancer were not causal. The value established by WHO (0.08 ppm) was based on an experimental study by Lang et al. (2008), which reported conjunctival redness and increased eye blink frequency following a 4-hour exposure of 0.5 ppm (0.63 mg/m3), which was considered as the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). This value was adjusted by an “assessment factor” of 5, which was derived from the standard deviation of nasal pungency (i.e., sensory irritation) thresholds, leading to a value of 0.12mg/m3 (0.09ppm), which was rounded down to 0.1 mg/m3 or 0.08 ppm. This value was also reached based on the concept that there is no indication of accumulation of effects over time following prolonged exposure and that neither increased sensitivity nor sensitization was considered plausible at such concentrations in either adults or children\n\nFinally, OEHHA (Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment; Cal/EPA) and the INDEX project have derived even lower Chronic Reference Exposure Levels (CRELs), with formaldehyde inhalation exposure values of 0.002ppm (2 ppb) and 1μg/m3 (0.815 ppb), respectively. These values were derived by the application of various safety/uncertainty factors to empirically derived data. However, given that each falls close to or even below measured formaldehyde concentrations in normal human breath (i.e., ≈2 ppb) as well as rural air ambient formaldehyde concentrations (i.e., ≈8 ppb), it is unclear how such values should be interpreted in the context of providing realistic public health protection. Importantly, with respect to the value of 0.815 ppb established by OEHHA, a recent (2008) joint communiqué from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), FEMA, and US EPA noted that “Due to the fact that OEHHA determined that the CREL for formaldehyde is less than typical ambient levels, they (i.e., OEHHA) recommended an office concentration level of 23 ppb, based upon the concept of “as low as reasonably achievable.” However, even 23 ppb is far below the empirically derived value of 0.3 ppm (300 ppb) that will be protective even for sensitive individuals.\n\nAnother example of a lower exposure limit is ATSDR's (1999) chronic Minimum Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm (8 ppb). That level was based on an occupational study, instead of controlled studies, in which nasal histopathology was evaluated in one group of workers exposed predominantly to formaldehyde and another group exposed to both formaldehyde and wood dust (Holmstrom et al., 1989). Because the subjects worked “…in a chemical industry in which formaldehyde and products based on formaldehyde were produced as resins” they apparently were not exposed solely to formaldehyde as the only nasal irritant. In addition, workers were exposed to frequent formaldehyde peaks above 1 mg/m3 (≈1 ppm) so that the formaldehyde exposure concentrations associated with mean biopsy scores could be characterized only as >0.5 for nearly 30% of the group. The well-known confounding due to wood dust has already been described. ATSDR determined 0.24ppm to be the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) from this study. An uncertainty factor of 3 was then used to obtain a presumed NOAEL and an uncertainty factor of 10 was applied for human variability (0.24/3 × 10 = 0.008). Such co-exposures and lack of defined exposure concentrations make it questionable that reported effects were due solely to formaldehyde.\n\n2. Derivation of recommended value\n\nAlthough 0.3 ppm represents the best science-based exposure limit for formaldehyde in indoor air, an alternative, even more health-protective approach also can be justified. Based on the substantial amount of data derived from controlled human studies and on numerous reviews of those data, 1.0 ppm is the LOAEL that is unequivocally associated with eye irritation and with substantial scientific certainty that false positives play no confounding role. Using the weight of evidence-based value of 1.0 ppm and dividing by a “certainty factor” of 10 would yield an indoor air concentration limit of 0.1 ppm (100 ppb). This limit is a conservative target level that provides scientifically documentable protection from formaldehyde-induced sensory irritation as well as from odor and annoyance effects for everybody, including sensitive individuals, children, and people with asthma. This value was endorsed by the expert panel assembled by Paustenbach et al. (1997), which stated, “The panel concluded that any occupational or environmental guideline for formaldehyde should be based primarily on controlled studies in humans, since nearly all other studies are compromised by the presence of other contaminants. The panel also concluded that if concentrations of formaldehyde are kept below 0.1 ppm in the indoor environment (where exposures might occur 24h/d) this should prevent irritation in virtually all persons.” Likewise, in a NAS (2008) report prepared for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the issue of deriving an airborne concentration (AC) for formaldehyde for personnel exposed for long durations was critically assessed. As noted in this report,“…a formaldehyde concentration of 0.1 ppm is being identified as a reasonable guideline for long-term exposure that is unlikely to result in any irritant effects, even with sensitive individuals. Instead of relying on one particular study, multiple lines of evidence support this AC as appropriate. This evidence…includes the findings from a number of controlled human studies, evaluations from several comprehensive scientific reviews, community health surveys, and practical NASA experience with formaldehyde in an enclosed environment designed to mimic conditions relevant to spacecraft exposures.”\n\nFinally, a value of 0.1 ppm is also in close agreement with the most recent comprehensive evaluation of formaldehyde in indoor air including a recommended indoor air level by Wolkoff and Nielsen (2010). This evaluation, carried out in the framework of the WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline development (2006-2010), concluded that, “With the eye the most sensitive organ, subjective irritation is reported at 0.3-0.5mg/m3 [0.24-0.5 ppm], which is somewhat higher than reported odour thresholds. Objective effects in the eyes and airways occur around 0.6-1 mg/m3 [0.46-0.8 ppm]. Dose-response relationships between FA and lung function effects have not been found in controlled human exposure studies below 1 mg/m3 [0.8 ppm], and epidemiological associations between FA concentrations and exacerbation of asthma in children and adults are encumbered by complex exposures. Neither experimental nor epidemiological studies point to major differences in susceptibility to FA among children, elderly, and asthmatics…. An air quality guideline of 0.1 mg/m3 (0.08 ppm) is considered protective against both acute and chronic sensory irritation in the airways in the general population assuming a log normal distribution of nasal sensory irritation.” Consequently, based on the weight of evidence from the numerous controlled human studies in which exposure to formaldehyde was the only variable, any derived “safe” concentration of formaldehyde which falls below the range of 0.08-0.1 ppm (80-100 ppb) cannot be justified, since there are no un-confounded empirical data that demonstrate formaldehyde-associated sensory irritation effects below this level.\n\nA. Recent agency reviews of potential formaldehyde carcinogenicity\n\nIn 2006, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) elevated formaldehyde into the category of a “known” human carcinogen based on a conclusion that nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) was etiologically associated with exposure. This was based primarily on the findings from a large 10 -plant study conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) involving more than 25,000 workers by Hauptmann et al. (2004). While expressing concern about a possible association with leukemia based on epidemiology data, IARC (2006) also expressed skepticism about this association because there was no known mechanism to explain how this might occur. Following the most recent formaldehyde meeting, IARC (2009) concluded that the evidence was sufficient to conclude that formaldehyde was also a “known” cause of leukemia. This change in listing presumably was related to data presented during the meeting that appeared to support a hypothesized potential mode of action concerning formaldehyde-induced leukemia. Although IARC's conclusions on leukemia were based substantially on an update of the NCI cohort by Beane Freeman et al. (2009), they were also supported by a misguided interpretation of formaldehyde toxicokinetics and a new study in Chinese workers by Zhang et al. (2010) in which it was reported that formaldehyde was associated with negative effects on blood counts and certain chromosomes in formaldehyde-exposed workers. Relevant aspects of the key epidemiology studies, the Chinese worker study, and mechanistic issues for both NPC and leukemia are discussed.\n\nAn expert panel of the National Toxicology Program (NTP, 2009) concluded that formaldehyde should be listed as a “known human carcinogen” in the upcoming 12th Report on Carcinogens (RoC) for NPC, sinonasal cancer and myeloid leukemia. It should be noted that IARC (2009), based on a review of the same epidemiology data, did not conclude that formaldehyde was “known” to cause sinonasal cancer, which is even rarer than NPC. The decision of the NTP expert panel for NPC and myeloid leukemia was based on essentially the same epidemiology data as relied upon by IARC, the study by Zhang et al. (2010) in Chinese workers, and also included some discussion on possible mechanisms of formaldehyde-induced leukemia. Because of a number of controversial issues pertaining to the proposed listing by NTP, particularly for myeloid leukemia, at the time of this writing, it is not yet known if the 12th RoC, when finalized, will include this endpoint.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA, 2010a) in its draft Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) assessment of formaldehyde concluded that formaldehyde was etiologically associated with NPC, all forms of leukemia (i.e., acute myeloid leukemia [AML], chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], acute lymphoid leukemia [ALL], and chronic lymphoid leukemia [CLL]) and Hodgkin's lymphoma. As with the IARC and NTP decisions, this conclusion was also substantially based on the NCI cohort data (i.e., Beane Freeman et al., 2009), a study by Hauptmann et al. (2009) in embalmers, the Zhang et al. (2010) study in Chinese workers, as well as a meta-analysis of the epidemiology data by Zhang et al. (2009). The IRIS review also concluded that neither animal data nor mode-of-action data were sufficient to support the epidemiology findings for lymphohematopoieitc malignancies. Since all of these studies and issues are discussed in this review, other than for a few specific mechanistic and risk assessment-related issues, the conclusions of the US EPA/IRIS assessment will not be further analyzed.\n\nThe draft EPA formaldehyde IRIS assessment was recently reviewed by a committee of the National Research Council (NRC) (NAS 2011). This review concluded that the assessment failed to support a causal association between formaldehyde and leukemia or other health problems. The NRC committee concluded that EPA's claims that formaldehyde causes leukemia, myeloid leukemia or related hematopoietic cancers are not supported in the EPA/IRIS assessment noting “As with the respiratory tract cancers, the draft IRIS assessment does not provide a clear framework for causal determinations. As a result, the conclusions appear to be based on a subjective view of the overall data, and the absence of a causal framework for these cancers is particularly problematic given the inconsistencies in the epidemiologic data, the weak animal data, and the lack of mechanistic data” In particular, the committee noted that the epidemiologic data were limited by “…uncertainties of exposure assessment, possible confounding by other pollutants, and reliance on mortality data rather than incidence data….”\n\nAlthough EPA postulated a mutagenic mode of action for leukemia and other hematopoietic cancers, the evidence is very weak, particularly as it relates to low, environmental exposures with the NRC committee observing that “Although EPA postulated that formaldehyde could reach the bone marrow either as methanediol or as a byproduct of nonenzymatic reactions with glutathione, numerous studies…have demonstrated that systemic delivery of formaldehyde is highly unlikely at concentrations below those which overwhelm metabolism according to sensitive and selective analytic methods that can differentiate endogenous from exogenous exposures” Additionally, while EPA suggested a mode of action in which hematopoietic cells in the nasal epithelium are affected by inhaled formaldehyde and return to the bone marrow the NRC committee considered this possibility and concluded, “As a result, EPA could only speculate that circulating hematopoietic stem cells that percolate through nasal capillary beds or nasal-associated lymphoid tissues may be the target cells for mutations and clastogenic effects that eventually result in lymphohemotopoietic cancers. Experimental evidence of this mechanism is lacking.”\n\nWith respect to how data were selected and evaluated the committee stated that “EPA should revisit its arguments and include detailed descriptions of the criteria that were used to weigh evidence and assess causality” The report also notes that EPA's draft assessment “provides little discussion about how asthma could be caused or exacerbated by formaldehyde exposure” and that a study relied upon for development of the asthma RfC (i.e., Rumchev et al. 2002) “…most likely suffers from misclassification of infection-associated wheezing in young children as asthma.” On the issue of sensory irritation the NRC committee was critical of EPA for not including the controlled human studies and that “…EPA set aside the chamber and occupational studies too soon in the process.” As for the studies selected and relied upon (the study by Ritchie and Lehnen 1987 was rejected as invalid and “EPA should not have used it”) for establishing the RfC for sensory irritation the committed observed that “…study details…and study weaknesses (such as the limitations of the exposure assessments performed in the residential and occupational epidemiologic studies) were not thoroughly presented or critically evaluated in a consistent manner by EPA” While the committee agreed that respiratory tract cancers were plausible since this is the first site of contact with inhaled formaldehyde they concluded that, “…the draft IRIS assessment does not present a clear framework for causal determinations and presents several conflicting statements that need to be resolved regarding a causal association between formaldehyde and respiratory tract cancers” Finally, the committee was supportive of the biologically based dose response (BBRD) model developed for risk assessment of formaldehyde induced nasal tumors and critical of EPA's development“ of alternative models that yielded the most extreme deviations from the Conolly et al. (2004) low-dose extrapolations” which “produced unrealistically high added risks for humans at concentrations that have been observed in the environment or occupationally exposed workers (100% incidence at concentrations as low as about 0.1-1 ppm).”\n\nB. Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC)\n\n1. Animal data\n\nRat studies showing nasal tumors following chronic exposure to sufficient concentrations of formaldehyde provide support for the hypothetical possibility for the epidemiological findings of NPC (e.g., Kerns et al., 1983a, b; Tobe et al., 1989; Sellakumar et al., 1985; Feron et al., 1989). For example, in what is generally considered to be the definitive study of formaldehyde-induced nasal cancer, rats were exposed by inhalation to formaldehyde at concentrations of 0, 0.7, 2, 6, 10, and 15 ppm for 2 years (Monticello et al., 1990). Nasal tumors occurred only at formaldehyde concentrations of 6 (1%), 10 (22%), and 15 (45%) ppm. Those concentrations are far in excess of tolerable irritant levels for humans and are sufficient to cause cytotoxicity of the rat nasal epithelium, with subsequent regenerative proliferation observed. Exposures at 6 ppm and above for a sufficient duration produce substantial toxicogenomic and histopathological derrangements directly associated with the development of nasal tumors.\n\n2. Mutagenicity data\n\nWith respect to formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors in rats, a key issue is whether early mutations play an etiologic role in this process. Although in vitro studies demonstrate that formaldehyde is mutagenic in a number of test systems (ATSDR, 1999; IARC, 2006), none of these studies have been conducted in whole tissues in the presence of formaldehyde dehydrogenase and other metabolizing enzymes. The lack of such metabolic capability suggests that in vitro studies are unlikely to mimic potential effects in rodents or humans with background endogenous formaldehyde concentrations and substantial detoxification capacity. Consequently, without the ability to metabolize formaldehyde, in vitro mutagenicity data may not provide an adequate basis for determining what role, if any, mutations might have played in the development of formaldehyde-induced rat nasal tumors. It is clearly established that sufficient doses of formaldehyde cause substantial cytotoxicity in nasal epithelial cells, double-stranded DNA breaks, and various DNA adducts that in sufficient quantity can lead to mutations and transformation. Unresolved, however, is whether dose-dependent, sub-cytotoxicity-induced mutations play an early etiologic role in tumor formation or appear only later in the tumorigenic process subsequent to frank cytotoxicity and regenerative proliferation. Consequently, for formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors in rats, it seems reasonable to also assume that if early mutations play an etiological role in the process, DNA repair and associated genes in nasal tissues would be activated at all exposure doses, but this has not been reported.\n\nToxicogenomic data from 21-day (Andersen et al., 2008) and 13-week (Andersen et al., 2010) exposure studies at the same inhalation doses used in the chronic cancer bioassays showed no changes in DNA repair genes at formaldehyde doses of <2ppm. A primary conclusion in the Andersen et al. (2008) paper is that genomic changes, including those suggestive of mutagenic effects, did not temporally precede or occur at lower doses than phenotypic changes in the tissue. These findings are in contrast to several studies by Hester et al. (2003, 2005) that report changes in DNA repair genes following nasal instillation of a single dose of formaldehyde (400 mM). This instilled dose altered more than 3 times as many genes of varying types as compared to the 15ppm inhalation exposure (Andersen et al., 2008), suggesting that the reported finding of effects on DNA repair genes from single high-dose nasal installation studies have limited relevance with respect to demonstrating a role of early mutations in the development of nasal tumors via inhalation.\n\nAnother recent in vivo study suggests that early formaldehyde-induced p53 mutation is unlikely to play a role in tumorigenesis. In this study by Meng et al. (2010), F344 rats were exposed to formaldehyde at concentrations of 0, 0.7, 2, 6, 10, or 15ppm for 13 weeks, with nasal epithelial tissues examined for the presence of one of the p53 mutations that had been detected in the squamous cell carcinomas induced by chronic formaldehyde exposure in a 2-year bioassay (Recio et al., 1992). In addition, because cytotoxicity-induced regenerative cell proliferation is considered a key event in formaldehyde-induced carcinogenesis (McGregor et al., 2006), nasal mucosal cell proliferation was monitored by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Although there was a low spontaneous background level of p53 mutation, this level was not increased by formaldehyde exposure, even at tumorigenic doses. In contrast, BrdU labeling showed the percentage of proliferating cells increased with increasing formaldehyde dose and was significantly increased at 10 and 15ppm compared to controls. These data showing no increase in p53 mutation, but significant changes in regenerative cell proliferation, following 13 weeks of formaldehyde exposure at tumorigenic doses suggest that p53 mutation is a late event not involved in the carcinogenic MOA in formaldehyde-induced carcinogenesis and occurs only after other key events (e.g., DNA-protein crosslinks, cytotoxicity, cell proliferation) have occurred. Although these results do not rule out the possibility that other earlier mutations might play an etiologic role in tumor formation, it is reasonable to expect that such mutations would trigger responses in DNA repair mechanisms if they were present. As shown in the toxicogenomic study by Andersen et al. (2010), the lack of any up-regulation of DNA repair genes at the two lowest formaldehyde concentrations (i.e., 0.7 or 2ppm) suggests that this pathway is not activated at any exposure duration examined, i.e., 1, 4, or 13 weeks.\n\n3. Mode of action for nasal tumors\n\nThe key finding in rat studies is that the sequence of events leading to nasal tumor formation occurs only at formaldehyde doses (i.e., >6ppm) sufficient to produce frank cytotoxicity and regenerative proliferation. This general mode of action has been critically evaluated by McGregor et al. (2006) following US EPA's Guidelines for Cancer Risk Assessment (US EPA, 2005) in conjunction with the methods and approaches established by the International Life Sciences/Risk Sciences Institute (ILSI-RSI) and International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS) (i.e., Cohen et al., 2003, 2004; Meek et al., 2003; Boobis et al., 2006). Using this methodology, McGregor et al. (2006) determined that all of the mode-of-action elements (i.e., cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, and DNA effects) for formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors are highly non-linear and do not occur unless a particular threshold dose (6ppm) has been exceeded. The authors concluded, “From a weight-of-evidence point of view, the hypothesized mode of action for formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors satisfies several criteria, including consistency, concordance of dose-response relationships across all key events, and biological plausibility and coherence of the database. Given the extensive experimental data that addresses and is consistent with the proposed mode of action of formaldehyde in the induction of tumors in the nasal cavity, a high degree of confidence may be ascribed to it.”\n\n4. Biologically based dose-response (BBDR) model\n\nThe extensive database on the MOA for formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors in rodents, in conjunction with the established differences between rodents and humans in upper respiratory tract physiology, has been used as the basis for the development of a biologically based dose-response (BBDR) model (Conolly et al., 2003, 2004). Use of this model greatly minimizes the necessity for relying on many of the default assumptions that have become an integral part of how potential cancer risks from chemical exposures are assessed in a regulatory context.\n\nTo compare potential effects in rats, monkeys, and humans, models were developed using anatomically precise computer reconstructions of the nasal passages that simulate the complex patterns of airflow and tissue uptake of inhaled formaldehyde. Using computational fluid dynamics, the specific doses of inhaled formaldehyde that can reach various regions of the respiratory tract in all three species was predicted and compared. For rats and monkeys, those predictions are consistent with the sites of formaldehyde-induced lesions observed experimentally. In other words, the model can predict where tumors will or will not occur. The combination of experimental data and modeled predictions show a strong relationship between the dose of formaldehyde in tissues of the nose and resulting nasal tumors in rodents.\n\nAs predicted by the cross-species modeling and the flux of formaldehyde into the nasal mucosa leading to the formation of DNA-protein cross-links (DPX), in conjunction with the extensive rodent and primate data on cyto-lethality/regenerative cellular proliferation (CRCP), the model was used to predict potential upper respiratory tract cancer risks in humans. The model was calibrated against respiratory tract cancer incidence data for non-smokers, smokers, and a mixed population of nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. Based on the CRCP rat data, additional risks of respiratory tract cancer were predicted to be negative for formaldehyde exposures up to about 1 ppm for all three cases. The implications of the rat nasal tumor data for humans showed that upper respiratory tract cancer associated with inhaled formaldehyde are de minimis (i.e., 10−6 or less) at relevant exposure levels and that preventing non-cancer effects (i.e., sensory irritation) would be sufficient to protect from potential carcinogenic effects as well.\n\nSome (e.g., Subramaniam et al., 2008; Crump et al., 2008, 2010; Cal EPA, 2005) have taken issue with certain details of the BBDR model (e.g., kinetics of the initiated precursor cell) to derive alternative predictions of greater risks at lower doses of formaldehyde than those predicted by Conolly et al. (2004). However, the wide acceptance of the basis for and the predictions from this model by numerous regulatory and/or authoritative organizations attests to its applicability and utility (e.g., BfR, 2006; US EPA, 2006a, 2006b; Health Canada, 2005; NAS, 2007; NICNAS, 2006; OECD, 2002; WHO, 2010).\n\nA recent publication that questions the utility of all BBDR models due to their inherent uncertainty focuses particular attention on the model developed by Connolly et al. (2004) for formaldehyde. This critique (Crump et al., 2010) raises the issue that “…small changes to assumptions regarding the mathematical form of the dose response assumed for the division rates or death rates of initiated cells—changes too small to meaningfully degrade the correspondence of the model with the underlying data—increased estimates of cancer risk from formaldehyde by several orders of magnitude over those considered to be conservative in the original work.” Although it is recognized that initiated cells represent a small minority of cells in the nasal epithelial tissues, they are still cells (but not cancer cells) and therefore should behave (unless shown otherwise) like cells at low, non-tumorigenic levels of formaldehyde exposure (i.e., <6ppm). However, some consideration must be afforded the vast body of histopathological, cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, and toxicogenomic data extended up to 90 days, all demonstrating clear dose-dependent transitions in the responses of nasal epithelial tissues to graded formaldehyde exposures. The lack of any significant toxicogenomic responses in the nasal epithelium at formaldehyde concentrations of 0.7 ppm following 13 weeks of exposure as reported by Andersen et al. (2010) are difficult to reconcile with assumptions of formaldehyde-induced cellular events related to tumor formation.\n\nIn addition, modeled predictions must also be consistent with the abundant epidemiology findings. For example, as part of the sensitivity analysis of the BBDR model, Crump et al. (2008) derived an alternative version of the model that predicts unrealistically high lifetime cancer risk. By making adjustments to certain model parameters, the model predicts lifetime cancer risks from formaldehyde exposure ranging from 0.01 up to essentially 1 (i.e., everyone gets cancer) for exposures of approximately 0.1 ppm. Not only is this inconsistent with the epidemiological data (i.e., no cases of NPC are reported by Hauptmann et al. [2003] at the lowest peak exposure, >0 to <2ppm, and lack of any cases of NPC in 14,000 chemical workers or 11,000 garment workers occupationally exposed to formaldehyde [i.e., Coggin et al., 2003; Pinkerton et al., 2004]), such risks are also not consistent with numerous rodent tumor studies demonstrating that nasal tumors are not produced following 2 years exposure to <2ppm formaldehyde. Although Crump et al. (2008) noted that they “…have not examined whether the upper end of the range of additional risk is consistent with existing human epidemiology because that is not germane to the point we are making” this assertion makes little biological or practical sense. When a model predicts risks greater than those empirically observed in epidemiology and/or animal studies (now augmented by considerable toxicogenomic data), it is questionable whether such models can play a useful role in informing biologically realistic risk assessments. This is particularly the case since the general MOA for formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors as described by McGregor et al. (2006) and now augmented by considerably more data (e.g., Andersen et al., 2008, 2010) has not been challenged in the literature.\n\nA recent study by Lu et al. (2010b) in F344 rats appears to add further support to the basic concepts of the BBDR model at the molecular level. In this study, both endogenous and exogenous N2-hydroxymethyl-dG (dG) adducts in nasal DNA of rats exposed to 0.7, 2, 5.8, 9.1, or 15.2 ppm 13CD2-formaldehyde for 6 hours were quantified. The data clearly demonstrated that exogenous formaldehyde-DNA adducts form in a highly non-linear fashion, with a 21.7-fold increase in exposure (i.e., 0.7 to 15.2ppm) causing a 286-fold increase in exogenous adducts. The ratio of exogenous to endogenous DNA adducts showed that endogenous DNA adducts dominated at low exposures, comprising more than 99% of all adducts. Endogenous DNA adducts did not demonstrate a similar effect, with levels essentially identical at all exposure concentrations, indicating no effect from exogenous exposures. As noted by Lu et al. (2010b), “… if the number of exogenous adducts formed by a single 6 hour exposure to 0.7ppm [13CD2]-formaldehyde (0.039 ±0.19 adducts/107 dG) is compared with the overall average number of endogenous formaldehyde adducts (4.7± 1.8 adducts/107 dG), that means that only 83 out of 10,000 formaldehyde adducts arise from the 0.7 ppm exposure for 6 hours” If formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors in rodents were formed in a non-threshold manner as a consequence of early mutations, one would not expect the results as reported by Lu et al. (1010b). Instead, it is difficult to envision a scenario in which the 83 exogenously formed formaldehyde DNA dG adducts (which are identical to those formed endogenously) would drive nasal tumorigenesis, whereas the 10,000 endogenous dG adducts play no role in the process.\n\nThe National Research Council (NAS, 2007) endorsed the BBDR risk assessment approach when it developed exposure guidance levels for formaldehyde in the indoor air of submarines (assuming exposure 24 hours per day for several weeks at a time), concluding that this methodology “…more accurately reflects the scientific weight of the evidence for formaldehyde than does EPA's approach.” Similarly, in its latest assessment of formaldehyde, the Australian Department of Health and Aging (NICNAS, 2006) stated that the model is a “…biologically-based, dose-response model that incorporates mechanistic data… It is considered a more reliable estimate of cancer risk than the use of standard default assumptions, due to the incorporation of all available biological data.” Finally, in its review of formaldehyde under its Existing Chemicals program, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2002) issued a Screening Information Data Set (SIDS) Initial Assessment Report that stated, “ The increasing severity of damage in higher concentrations is a function of the concentration. Another way of expressing this result is that formaldehyde toxicity is independent of the total dose (c x t) but that it depends on the dose rate [(c × t)/t=c] or concentration. This can be explained by saturation of detoxification pathways for formaldehyde at high concentrations. Strong non-linearity in the induction of cell proliferation, DNA-protein-crosslinks, cytotoxic effects and carcinogenicity are observed (CIIT, 1999). The observed non-linearity is likely attributable to a large extent to mechanisms present in biological systems to deal with low levels of formaldehyde…Taking into account the extensive information on its mode of action, formaldehyde is not likely to be a potent carcinogen to humans under low exposure conditions” (OECD, 2002).\n\nThe weight of the evidence calls into question the default that serves as the basis for US EPA's current cancer 10−6 risk potency value for formaldehyde (0.08 ppb), which assumes there is no threshold for nasal tumorigenesis and thus no safe level of exposure (IRIS, 1991). The most recent US EPA/IRIS (2010a) evaluation of formaldehyde has lowered the 10−6 risk value to 0.008 ppb (8 ppt). According to US EPA's cancer risk assessment guidelines, the default assumption is meant to be used when there are no data establishing a mode of action inconsistent with low-dose linearity or the absence of a threshold (US EPA, 2005). The amount and consistency of the data that have been developed characterizing the MOA for formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors clearly support departing from a no-threshold default and applying a mode of action-based risk value.\n\nAdditional new data further challenge the regulatory presumption of no threshold for formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors in rodents and derivation of cancer risk values based on extrapolations from either animal or epidemiology data. A recent study by Moeller et al. (2010) determined the presence of endogenous and exogenous adducts in DNA from nasal mucosa and bone marrow of cynomolgus macaques exposed to 1.9 and 6.1 ppm of 13CD2-formaldehyde for 6 hours a day for 2 consecutive days. Both exogenous and endogenous adducts were readily detected and quantified in the nasal tissues of both exposure groups, with an exposure-dependent increase in exogenous adducts observed. In the nasal tissue DNA, exogenous formaldehyde-DNA adducts were present at 0.26 ± 0.04 and 0.41 ± 0.41 adducts/107 dG (N2-hydroxymethyl-dG) following the 1.9 and 6.1 ppm exposures, respectively, whereas endogenous adducts were present in the nasal DNA of all animals, with an average of 2.24 ±0.50 adducts/107 dG. It is unlikely a mechanism would exist in which exogenous formaldehyde-DNA adducts formed following 1.9 or 6.1 ppm exposures, which contribute less than the standard deviation of identical endogenous formaldehyde-DNA adducts, could drive the biology that leads to nasal carcinogenesis in a non-threshold manner.\n\nFinally, the 10−6 cancer risk value of 0.008 ppb (8 ppt) as derived in the most recent US EPA/IRIS (2010a) formaldehyde assessment is well below the upper end of concentrations of formaldehyde measured in human breath (i.e., 1.7 ppb) or associated with air concentrations in rural locations (i.e., 9 ppb), another fact that challenges a presumption that there is no safe level of exposure for formaldehyde. Consequently, it can be concluded that a formaldehyde vapor concentration of 0.1 ppm, which is protective for sensory irritation of the eyes, will also be far below the level that would likely initiate the sequence of events leading to nasal cancer.\n\n5. Toxicogenomic data\n\nThe scientific underpinnings of the BBDR model is further supported by toxicogenomic data that help illuminate some of the key biological events involved in formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors in rodents. Andersen et al. (2008) exposed rats to the same doses (0, 0.7, 2, and 6 ppm) of formaldehyde that had been used to characterize the nasal tumorigenicity threshold in the chronic bioassay (Monticello et al., 1996), 5 days/week for 3 weeks, with interim sacrifices. Nasal epithelium was taken from the same locations at which tumors had developed in rats exposed to 10 and 15 ppm in the chronic bioassay and evaluated by histopathology and microarray analyses. Gene expression fold changes >1.5 or <1.5 and a false discovery rate-corrected p value <.05 were the criteria for determining significance. No genes were significantly altered at 0.7 ppm at any time point, indicating a clear threshold for formaldehyde-induced effects. On day 5, 15 genes were significantly changed at 2 ppm and many more genes were changed at 6 ppm. Most importantly, by day 15 no genes were significantly changed at 2ppm, thereby demonstrating that even at this concentration, nasal cells initially show some minor changes, but after a few days the tissues rapidly adapt and return to a pattern of gene expression identical to 0 and 0.7 ppm. This study provides empirical support that formaldehyde exposure at concentrations less than 2 ppm are incapable of causing tissue damage that could lead to tumor formation.\n\nThe genomic findings of Andersen et al. (2008) provide parallel mechanistic information consistent with histopathological findings at the formaldehyde doses associated with transient and more serious effects on nasal tissues. Most of the genes affected with maximal responses at 2 ppm are thus associated with cell membrane and architecture, or otherwise, external aspects of the cell. None of these genes were statistically affected at the lower inhaled concentrations at day 15. The most sensitive responses (i.e., those apparent at the lowest concentrations) are consistent with actions of formaldehyde on the periphery of"
