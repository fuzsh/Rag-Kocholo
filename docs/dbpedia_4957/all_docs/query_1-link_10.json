The syntheses were accomplished from appropriate allylalcohols and 4-iodobenzoate to afford the aldehydes which were converted to the appropriate 2-amino-4-carbethoxy-5-substituted thiophenes 23-29. Cyclization with chlorformamidine afforded the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines 30-36 which were hydrolyzed and coupled with diethyl-L-glutamate, followed by saponification to give the target compounds 2-8. Compounds 3-6 were potent growth inhibitors (IC50 4.7 to 334 nM) of human tumor cells (KB and IGROV1) that express FRs. In addition, compounds 3-6 inhibited the growth of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that expressed FRs but not the reduced folate carrier (RFC) or proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT). However, the compounds were inactive toward CHO cells that lacked FRs but contained either the RFC or PCFT. By nucleoside and 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide (AICA) protection studies, along with in vitro and in situ enzyme activity assays, the mechanism of antitumor activity was identified as the dual inhibition of glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and, likely, AICA ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The dual inhibitory activity of the active thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates and the FR specificity represent unique mechanistic features for these compounds distinct from all other known antifolates. The potent inhibitory effects of compounds 3-6 toward cells expressing FRs but not PCFT provide direct evidence that cellular uptake of this series of compounds by FRs does not depend on the presence of PCFT and argues that direct coupling between these transporters is not obligatory.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe biological importance of reduced folates derives from their essential roles in one-carbon transfer leading to thymidylate, purine nucleotides, serine, and methionine, and in biological methylation reactions from S-adenosylmethionine.1 Since mammalian cells are unable to synthesize folates de novo, internalization of extracellular folates is essential. Three major folate uptake systems have been described.2 The ubiquitously expressed reduced folate carrier (RFC) is an anion exchanger and is the primary transport mechanism of folates at physiologic pH.3 The folate receptors (FRs) α and β are glycosylphosphoinositol-anchored proteins that transport folates by receptor-mediated endocytosis.4 The proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) is a proton-folate symporter that functions optimally at low pH.5 It has been reported that cellular uptake of (anti)folates by FR involves a functional “coupling” in which (anti)folates bind to surface FRs, followed by internalization and vesicle (endosome) formation, followed by extravesicular export by PCFT.6\n\nAntifolates, typified by methotrexate (MTX), pemetrexed (PMX) and raltitrexed (RTX) ( ) are structurally similar to folic acid and typically bind to folate-dependent enzymes to inhibit folate-dependent pathways.7 MTX continues to be an integral component of the chemotherapeutic arsenal for several cancers including pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, osteogenic sarcoma, lymphoma, and breast cancer.8 RTX is used outside of the US for advanced colorectal cancer.3 PMX was approved in 2004 for pleural mesothelioma in the US,9 and subsequently, as a second line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.10\n\nMTX is a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, whereas PMX and RTX derive their primary cytotoxic effects by inhibiting thymidylate synthase. Lometrexol (LMX) ( ) was introduced in 198511 as a targeted antipurine antifolate. The notion of selectively targeting de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis has roots in early studies of azaserine12 or thiopurines13 and is based on the assumption that depletion of purine nucleotide pools can limit nucleotides for DNA synthesis and repair, while also impacting ATP and GTP stores important for cellular energetics.14 This effect could be even more acute in several cancer cells that lack enzymes involved in purine salvage.15 Although there have been reports that antipurine antifolates such as LMX were cytostatic rather than cytotoxic,16 in other reports, antipurine antifolates were distinctly cytotoxic.17, 18\n\nWhile the aforementioned antifolates can be envisaged to possess limited selectivity for tumor cells over normal proliferative tissues such as bone marrow and gastrointestinal mucosa, interest in the development of antifolates remains particularly high for agents that target high affinity folate receptors (FRs).19 This reflects the restricted patterns of tissue expression for FRs, including the vast majority of ovarian and endometrial cancers for FRα and myeloid leukemias for FRβ.20 There are other factors that account for tumor selectivity of FR-targeted therapies, including the apical localization for FRα in normal epithelia such as renal tubules or choroid plexus where it is inaccessible to the circulation, and synthesis of non-functional FRβ in normal hematopoietic cells.4\n\nAmple literature documents applications of FRs for tumor targeting with folic acid as the targeting agent. For instance, cytotoxins (e.g., mitomycin C), liposome-encapsulated drugs (e.g., doxorubicin), or radionuclides have been conjugated to folic acid for targeting FR-expressing tumors.21-23 There are at least two potential complications of this approach. These include: (i) instability in plasma versus that within tumor cells such that the folate conjugate may be prematurely cleaved and release the cytotoxic agent prior to reaching the tumor, resulting in toxicity to normal cells, thus precluding selectivity; and (ii) the possibility that free folic acid released upon cleavage within the tumor could provide a growth-sustaining nutrient detrimental to tumor inhibition. Another approach involves a targeting ligand which itself is cytotoxic. Unfortunately, most folate-based therapeutics such as classical antifolates (including RTX, PMX, and LMX) that are substrates for FRs are also substrates for the ubiquitously expressed RFC resulting in decreased tumor selectivity with these agents.24 Indeed, the lack of continued clinical development of LMX can be directly traced to the severe myelosuppression encountered in a Phase 1 clinical trial,25 at least partly due to its excellent substrate activity for RFC uptake and polyglutamylation by normal tissues. Although classical antifolates can be transported by PCFT5, the role of this transporter in chemotherapy is still emerging.\n\nClearly, a specific FR-targeted agent that also possesses cytotoxic activity without transport by RFC would circumvent many of the drawbacks of targeting FRs with folic acid-conjugated cytotoxic agents and the lack of selectivity often associated with clinically used antifolates. Indeed, FR selective cytotoxic agents can be envisaged to provide highly selective antitumor agents against tumors expressing FR with little or no host toxicity. Ideally, analogs could be identified that are selective substrates for FRs over RFC. One possibility, 1a, ( ), was reported nearly 30 years ago,26, 27 however, its modest cell growth inhibitory potency and significant toxicity profile limited its further clinical development and led to introduction of RTX.28, 29 More recently, Jackman and colleagues described novel cyclopenta[g]quinazoline antifolates as FR-targeted agents,30,31 which like 1a and RTX are potent inhibitors of human thymidylate synthase. One of these cyclopenta[g]quinazolines was evaluated in mice and showed no systemic toxicity, as reflected in no weight loss or macroscopic signs of toxicity to major organs, consistent with its selective targeting of FRs.\n\nMost recently, we18 described a novel series of 6-substituted classical pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates, differing only in the lengths of the carbon bridge (3- to 6-carbons), characterized by potent and selective substrate activities for FRα and FRβ, and negligible substrate activity for RFC. The intracellular enzyme target of the 6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines was identified as glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFTase), the first folate-dependent reaction in the de novo purine synthesis pathway.\n\nIn this study, we extend this focus to a novel isosteric series of 6-substituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates [compounds 2-8 ( )], with a 2- to 8-carbon bridge between the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine and the benzoyl moiety, respectively. Isosteric replacement of the pyrrolo ring with a thieno ring for this series provides an increase in ring size that more closely approximates the pteridine, 6-6 fused ring system of the natural cofactor. In addition, replacement of the NH of the pyrrole with a S also allows for comparison of the relative importance of a hydrogen bond donor (NH) with a hydrogen bond acceptor (S). Our biological results establish the cytotoxic effects of the active compounds directly reflect potent inhibitory activities against GARFTase and cellular uptake capacities by FRs over RFC and PCFT. From nucleoside protection studies, lesser inhibitory effects of a second enzyme target, most likely 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICARFTase), was strongly implied. The potent cytotoxicity in cells expressing FRs but not PCFT provides direct evidence that cellular uptake of this series of compounds by FRs does not depend on the presence of PCFT and argues that direct coupling between these transporters is not obligatory.\n\nCHEMISTRY\n\nTarget compounds 2-8 were synthesized as shown in . The appropriate allyl alcohols 9-15 were treated with palladium diacetate, ethyl 4-iodobenzoate, LiCl, LiOAc and Bu4NCl in DMF to afford the aldehydes 16-22 (80-85% yield).32 A modified reaction temperature of 80 °C from that reported in the literature improved the yield. Aldehydes 16-22 were then reacted with sulfur, ethyl cyanoactetate and morpholine in EtOH for 24 h at room temperature under Gewald reaction conditions to afford 23-29.33 Cyclization of 23-29 with chlorformamidine hydrochloride afforded the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines 30-36 in 55-80% yield. Hydrolysis of the ethyl esters of 30-36 with 1 N NaOH in ethanol followed by acid workup gave the corresponding acids 37-43. With 2-Cl-4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazine and 4-methylmorpholine as the coupling reagents, acids 37-43 were coupled with diethyl-L-glutamate hydrochloride to afford compounds 44-50 (69-77%). Hydrolysis of 44-50 in 1 N NaOH, followed by acid workup gave target compounds 2-8 in 96-98% yield.\n\nBIOLOGICAL EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION\n\nConfirmation of the lack of PCFT in Chinese hamster ovary sublines and generation of PCFT stable transfectant\n\nWe previously described a panel of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines engineered from RFC- and FR-null MTXRIIOuaR2-4 (R2) cells to express human FRs (α and β; designated RT16 and D4, respectively) or RFC (PC43-10).18 To confirm the lack of PCFT in the hamster sublines, we screened CHO sublines derived from R2 cells by RT-PCR, using PCR primers to regions in hamster PCFT completely homologous to the human PCFT. While PCFT transcripts were detected in RNA from MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 human cells, endogenous PCFT transcripts were not detected in any of the CHO sublines, in spite of 98% identical sequence to human PCFT (100% for the primer binding sites) (Figure 1S, Supplement).\n\nWe used R2 CHO cells as the parental subline for transfection with human PCFT cDNA. Following isolation of a stable clonal subline, R2/PCFT4, cells were assayed for transport and PCFT expression by RT-PCR and results compared to those for R2 cells transfected with empty pCDNA3.1 plasmid (R2/VC) (negative control) (Supplement). While transport of [3H]MTX in R2/VC cells was insignificantly different at pH 5.5 (transport by PCFT is maximal at pH 5.5)5 from that at pH 7.2 (PCFT is essentially inactive at this pH)5 [0.56±0.061 (SEM) and 0.466 ± 0.076 pmol/mg/2 min, respectively; p=0.4130, n=8], transport was markedly elevated in R2/PCFT4 cells [6.96 ± 0.43 pmol/mg/2 min (p=0.0001; n=8) ( ).\n\nIdentification of 6-substituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates as potent growth inhibitors for cells expressing FRs, but not for cells expressing exclusively RFC or PCFT\n\nCompounds 2-8, containing 2- to 8-methylenes in the bridge region, were initially evaluated for their growth inhibitory effects during a 4 day exposure against the series of isogenic CHO sublines expressing the invidual folate transporters including FRα (RT16), FRβ (D4), RFC (PC43-10), or PCFT (R2/PCFT4). Growth inhibitory effects were compared to those for the classical antifolate inhibitors MTX, LMX, PMX, and RTX. For PC43-10 and R2/PCFT4 cells, results were compared to those for R2 or R2/VC cells, respectively, with identical results, whereas FR-effects in RT16 and D4 cells were established from parallel incubations in the presence of excess (200 nM) folic acid which blocked FR-mediated cellular uptake18. An identical series of experiments was performed with RFC-, PCFT-, and FRα-expressing KB and IGROV1 human tumor cells. The FR- binding levels and RFC transport activities for all these models were previously reported.18 The PCFT levels in KB and IGROV1 human solid tumor cell lines are significant and will be reported elsewhere (S. Kugel Desmoulin, Y. Wang, A. Gangjee, and L.H. Matherly manuscript in preparation).\n\nAll of the classical antifolates (MTX, LMX, PMX and RTX) were active against CHO sublines expressing RFC-, PCFT-, or FRs ( ). In RT16 and D4 cells, growth inhibitory effects were abolished by excess folic acid. For KB and IGROV1 cells, folic acid had at most a marginal effect on drug activity since the antifolates could still enter cells via RFC which is not blocked by folic acid.\n\nTable 1\n\nAntifolateRFCPCFTFRαFRβRFC/FRαRFC/FRαPC43-10R2R2/PCFT4R2/VCRT16RT16\n\n(+FA)D4D4\n\n(+FA)KBKB\n\n(+FA)IGROV1IGROV1\n\n(+FA)2>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>10003>1000>1000>1000>100013(3.4)>1000112(12)>100023(5.5)>10004.7(1.9)>10004>1000>1000>1000>10009(2.9)>100020(3.9)>10004.9(1.3)>10005.9(1.9)>10005>1000>1000>1000>100056(9.8)>100056(13)>1000132(23)>100025(1.7)>10006>1000>1000>1000>1000108(17)>1000364(46)>1000310(54)>1000334(59)>10007>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>10008>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000>1000Methotrexate12(1.1)216(8.7)120.5(16.8)>1000114(31)461(62)106(11)211(43)6.0(0.6)20(2.4)21(3.4)22(2.1)Pemetrexed138(13)894(93)13.2(2.4)974.0(18.1)42(9)388(68)60(8)254(78)68(12)327(103)102(25)200(18)Raltitrexed6.3(1.3)>100099.5(11.4)>100015(5)>100022(10)746(138)5.9(2.2)22(5)12.6(3.3)20(4.3)Lometrexol12(2.3)>1000248.0(18.2)>100012(8)188(41)2.6(1.0)275(101)1.2(0.6)31(7)3.1(0.9)16(6)1b11(3.3)>1000>1000>1000277(81)>100052(12)>10005.8(3.5)32(15)5.2(1.7)6.9(1.6)\n\nCompound 2 (2-carbon bridge) was uniformly inactive (IC50 > 1000 nM) in our assays. Compounds 3-6 (3- to 6-carbon bridge) were inhibitors of proliferation for CHO cells expressing either FRα or FRβ, but not with RFC-expressing PC43-10, PCFT-expressing R2/PCFT4 cells, or R2 or R2/VC cells without detectable FR, RFC, or PCFT ( ). The most potent analogs of the series, compounds 3 and 4, with 3- and 4-methylene groups in the bridge region, respectively, showed activities similar to those for the most active classical inhibitors, LMX and RTX, toward FR-expressing cells but were somewhat more active than either PMX or MTX. There was a progressive diminution of the growth inhibitory effects for the 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-methylene analogs (compounds 5 to 8, respectively). Analogous results were obtained with KB and IGROV1 human tumor cells ( ). For compounds 3-6, growth inhibitory effects were abolished with 200 nM folic acid indicating a requirement for FR uptake for these compounds.\n\nSimilar, albeit slightly less potent effects of compounds 3-5 and MTX were detected by colony-forming assays with KB cells over long term (10 day) continuous exposures to drug ( ). For the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates (but not MTX), the effects were completely reversed by an excess of folic acid, establishing a requirement of FRs for transport of the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines. These results establish that compounds 3-5 are cytotoxic toward KB human tumor cells.\n\nProtection from the growth inhibitory effects of thieno[2,3-d]pyridimidine antifolates with nucleosides\n\nTo localize the probable enzyme target(s) for the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine series that results in suppression of cell proliferation, we tested the growth inhibitory effects of compound 4, the most potent of our analogs, against KB cells in the presence of adenosine (60 μM) or thymidine (10 μM). Thymidine (10 μM) did not alter the growth inhibitory effects of compound 4, whereas adenosine (60 μM) was completely protective ( ). This establishes the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway as the primary metabolic target.\n\nSince there are two folate-dependent enzymes in the de novo purine synthesis pathway, GARFTase and AICARFTase, we tested the protection by 5-amino-4-imidazole (AICA) (320 μM), which can be converted to 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), an intermediate metabolite between GARFTase and AICARFTase which circumvents the GARFTase step.18, 34 AICA (320 μM) almost completely protected KB cells against the toxicity of compound 4 at low and medium concentrations (≤ 50 nM), whereas growth was still significantly inhibited at higher concentrations of compound 4 (above 100 nM) ( ) even in the presence of AICA.\n\nThus, the pattern of nucleoside protection indicates a potent inhibition by the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolate 4 on de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis. GARFTase appears to be the major enzyme target leading to growth inhibition of FR-expressing KB cells, although a secondary target, most likely AICARFTase, also seems likely at higher doses of drug. Analogous results were obtained with compound 3. These results suggest a unique mechanistic feature of the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines 3 and 4 distinguishing this series from the pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines reported previously18 which were only GARFTase inhibitors.\n\nMolecular mechanisms of 6-substituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates\n\nThe results of the above experiments strongly indicate that the 6-substituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates 3-8 are (i) substrates for FR-mediated cellular uptake but not for RFC or PCFT ( ), and (ii) inhibitors of de novo purine biosynthesis, reflecting primary inhibition of GARFTase ( ). Additional mechanistic experiments were performed to validate these conclusions.\n\nFor FRs, substrate binding is a good reflection of FR-mediated uptake.24 Accordingly, competition by compounds 2-8 with [3H]folic acid for binding to FRs α and β (in RT16 and D4 cells, respectively) was measured and the results compared to those with the classical antifolates MTX, LMX, and PMX, and the folate cofactor leucovorin (LCV). Cells were washed at pH 3.5 to remove bound folate, then treated with 50 nM [3H]folic acid in the presence of a range of inhibitor concentrations. After additional washing (at neutral pH), binding of [3H]folic acid was measured. Relative affinities were determined over a range of concentrations of unlabeled ligands and were calculated as the inverse molar ratios of unlabeled ligands required to inhibit 50% of [3H]folic acid binding.\n\nUsing relative binding of folic acid set to a value of 1, MTX showed negligible binding (<0.05), whereas LMX showed high (∼0.8) and comparable affinities toward both FRα and β ( ). Similarly, relative binding affinities of compounds 3-8 were high (above 0.8) to both FRα and FRβ. Compound 2 resembled PMX and LCV in its moderate binding affinity for FRα (∼0.25-0.45) and poor binding affinity for FRβ (<0.01). This establishes a clear chain length preference for binding FRα and FRβ.\n\nThe most potent of the 6-substituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine series, compounds 2-6, were tested for their inhibition of GARFTase using an in vitro assay with recombinant mouse GARFTase, which followed the absorbance changes at 295 nm accompanying one-carbon transfer from 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid to β-glycinamideribonucleotide (βGAR), forming 5,8-dideazafolic and formyl GAR (FGAR). summarizes the IC50 values for in vitro GARFTase inhibitions by compounds 2-6, for comparison with those for LMX and PMX. Similar to our cytotoxicity results, compounds 3 and 4 were the most potent of the series, with IC50s less than 10 μM. However, by in vitro assay, compounds 3 and 4 were less inhibitory than was LMX ( ). Compounds 2, 5 and 6, along with PMX, all showed IC50s above 20 μM, the upper limit of the in vitro activity assay ( ).\n\nTable 2\n\nAntifolateIC50In vitro (μM)In situ (nM)2>2032.3 (9.5)38.52 (2.71)13.8 (9.5)45.51 (0.82)13.3 (5.5)5>2023.6 (6.2)6>2026.6 (7.5)Pemetrexed>2030 (7.7)Lometrexol0.78 (0.08)14 (5.6)\n\nTo assess the inhibitory effects of compounds 2-6 in cells, in situ experiments were performed in which KB cells were metabolically labeled with [14C]glycine in the presence of azaserine, and the accumulations of [14C]FGAR were measured following ion exchange fractionation. Again, compounds 3 and 4 showed the lowest IC50s of the series ( ) and were equipotent with LMX but slightly more active than PMX and compounds 2, 5 and 6. While for compounds 3 to 6 (but not compound 2), the results of the in situ GARFTase assays generally paralleled their relative in vitro growth inhibitions ( ), this was less-than-complete and likely further reflects at least a partial effect of the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines at an intracellular target other than GARFTase.\n\nConclusions\n\nTaken together, these results establish that the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines are potent and selective inhibitors of cell proliferation in cells that express FRs α and β, and that, with the exception of compound 2, there is no appreciable difference in affinity for the FR isoforms for these analogs. In contrast, by growth inhibition assays, the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates 2-8 are all exceedingly poor substrates for both RFC and PCFT. Compounds 3 and 4 were consistently the most potent inhibitors of proliferation in cells expressing FRs α and β and this was significantly associated with inhibition of GARFTase. By both in vitro and in situ GARFTase assays, the bridge length with 3- and 4-methylenes is optimal for GARFTase binding and inhibition, analogous to our previous findings with the 6-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates.18 The dramatic differences in inhibition potencies by in situ (nM) versus in vitro (μM) assays of GARFTase ( ) likely reflect increased enzyme affinities by drug polyglutamates within cells. The possibility of a secondary enzyme target, most likely AICARFTase, suggested by our protection studies with AICA and in situ GARFTase assays, raises the intriguing possibility of a dual inhibition at high concentrations of these novel agents. The presence of two molecular targets would likely reduce the acquisition of resistance due to alterations in enzyme affinities for the cytotoxic drugs.\n\nThe thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates 2-8 are unique from all the other classical antifolates evaluated, including pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (PMX), quinazoline (RTX) and pteridine (MTX) antifolates, in that they are neither substrates for RFC nor PCFT. This characteristic results in selective targeting of FR-expressing cells, while exerting no cytotoxic effects toward cells that express these other transporters in the absence of FRs. Given that PCFT has been suggested to function in tandem with FRs in mediating folate uptake,6 our finding of exclusive FR-selective activity in FR-expressing CHO cells that do not express detectable PCFT is of further interest in that they establish that that the presence of PCFT is not obligatory to FR-mediated cellular uptake, at least for the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates described herein.\n\nTo summarize, this report documents our continued efforts to identify novel antifolates with potential selectivity for tumors expressing high affinity FRs over normal cells that express RFC and PCFT. We describe a novel series of 6-substituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates 2-8 that differ in the lengths of the methylene bridge from 2- to 8-carbons. These analogs, like our previous series of 6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates, are excellent substrates for FRs and potently inhibit de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis rather than thymidylate synthesis. Further, as with the pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates, GARFTase appeared to be primary enzyme target for the 6-substituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine analogs, although our results strongly suggested a secondary enzyme target, most likely AICARFTase, may also be important. Thus, unlike the pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines, the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines appear to be dual acting agents and likely inhibit both GARFTase and AICARFTase in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway at higher drug concentrations. In addition, the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines afford structural specificity for transport via FRs and are not stubstrates for RFC or PCFT. Thus, the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines provide a scaffold that allows selectivity of uptake by FRs over RFC and PCFT. This is the only example in the literature of antifolates that afford this exquisite selectivity for cellular uptake by FRs over RFC and PCFT that can be exploited for selective inhibition of tumors that express FRs.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\nAll evaporations were carried out in vacuo with a rotary evaporator. Analytical samples were dried in vacuo (0.2 mmHg) in a CHEM-DRY drying apparatus over P2O5 at 55 °C. Melting points were determined on a MEL-TEMP II melting point apparatus with FLUKE 51 K/J electronic thermometer and are uncorrected. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra for proton (1H NMR) were recorded on a Bruker WH-300 (300 MHz) or a Bruker 400MHz/52 MM (400 MHz) spectrometer. The chemical shift values are expressed in ppm (parts per million) relative to tetramethylsilane as internal standard: s ) singlet, d ) doublet, t ) triplet, q ) quartet, m ) mutiplet, br ) broad singlet. The relative integrals of peak areas agreed with those expected for the assigned structures. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS), using Electron Impact (EI), were recorded on a VG AUTOSPEC (Fisons Instruments) micromass (EBE Geometry) double focusing mass spectrometer. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Whatman Sil G/UV254 silica gel plates with fluorescent indicator, and the spots were visualized under 254 and 366 nm illumination. Proportions of solvents used for TLC are by volume. Column chromatography was performed on a 230-400 mesh silica gel (Fisher, Somerville, NJ) column. Elemental analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc. Norcross, GA. Element compositions are within ±0.4% of the calculated values. Fractional moles of water or organic solvents frequently found in some analytical samples of antifolates could not be prevented despite 24-48 h of drying in vacuo and were confirmed where possible by their presence in the 1H NMR spectra. All solvents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. or from Fisher Scientific and were used as received.\n\nGeneral Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 16-22\n\nTo a 250 mL round bottom flask, fitted with a magnetic stir bar, were placed palladium diacetate (0.269 g, 1.2 mmol), the appropriate allyl alcohol (20 mmol), ethyl 4-iodobenzoate (5.52 g, 20 mmol), LiCl (0.848 g,20 mmol), LiOAc (3.3 g, 50 mmol) and Bu4NCl (11.12 g, 40 mmol) and DMF (40 mL).

Unlabeled folic acid was purchased from the Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Unlabeled MTX and LCV [(6R,S) 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate] were provided by the Drug Development Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD. Both labeled and unlabeled MTX were purified by HPLC prior to use.36 α,β-GAR and coenzyme 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid were provided by Dr. Richard Moran (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). Other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources in the highest available purity.\n\nCell Lines and Assays of Antitumor Drug Activities\n\nRFC-, PCFT, and FRα-null MTXRIIOuaR2-4 (R2) CHO cells were a gift from Dr. Wayne Flintoff (University of Western Ontario)36 and were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), penicillin-streptomycin solution and glutamine at 37°C with 5% CO2.\n\nPC43-10 cells are R2 cells transfected with human RFC.37 RT16 cells are R2 cells transfected with human FRα, and D4 cells are R2 cells transfected with human FRβ. Both RT16 and D4 cells were described in a previous publication.18 The lack of endogenous hamster PCFT in the CHO R2, RT16, and PC43-10 sublines was confirmed by RT-PCR of PCFT transcripts (Supplement) and by transport assay at pH 5.5 and 7.2 with [3H]MTX (see Supplement). R2/PCFT4 cells and R2/VC cells were prepared by transfection with human PCFT cDNA in pCDNA3.1 vector and with empty pCDNA3.1, respectively (below). All the R2 transfected cells (PC43-10, RT16, D4, and R2/PCFT4) were routinely cultured in α-MEM plus 1.5 mg/ml G418. Prior to the cytotoxicity assays (see below), RT16 and D4 cells were cultured in complete folate-free RPMI 1640 (without added folate) for three days.\n\nKB human cervical cancer were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) whereas IGROV1 ovarian carcinoma cells were a gift of Dr. Manohar Ratnam (Medical University of Ohio). Cells were routinely cultured in folate-free RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin solution, 2 mM glutamine at 37°C with 5% CO2. FR and RFC levels in IGROV1 and KB cells were previously reported18. Human PCFT levels were measured by real-time PCR with gene specific primers and the results will be reported elsewhere (S. Kugel Desmoulin, Y. Wang, A. Gangjee, and L.H. Matherly manuscript in preparation).\n\nFor growth inhibition assays, cells (CHO, KB, or IGROV1) were plated in 96 well plates (∼5000 cells/well, total volume of 200 μl medium) with a broad range of antifolate concentrations. The medium was RPMI 1640 (contains 2.3 μM folic acid) with 10% dialyzed serum and antibiotics for experiments with R2 and PC43-10 cells. For RT16, D4, KB, and IGROV1 cells, cells were cultured in folate-free RPMI media with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics supplemented with 2 nM LCV. The requirement for FR-mediated drug uptake in these assays was established in parallel incubation including 200 nM folic acid. For R2/PCFT4 cells, the medium used routine growth inhibition assays was folate-free RPMI 1640 (pH 7.2) containing 25 nM LCV, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For all cell lines, incubations were routinely up to 96 h; metabolically active cells (a measure of cell viability) were assayed with CellTiter-blue Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and fluorescence was measured (590 nm emission, 560 nm excitation) with a Molecular Dynamics fluorescence plate reader. Data were exported from Softmax Pro software to an Excel spreadsheet for analysis and determinations of IC50s, corresponding to the drug concentrations that result in 50% loss of cell growth.\n\nFor some of the in vitro growth inhibition studies, the inhibitory effects of the antifolate inhibitors on de novo thymidylate biosynthesis (i.e., thymidylate synthase) and de novo purine biosynthesis (GARFTase and AICARFTase) were tested by co-incubations with thymidine (10 μM) and adenosine (60 μM), respectively. For de novo purine biosynthesis, additional protection experiments used AICA (320 μM) as a means of distinguishing inhibitory effects at GARFTase from those at AICARFTase.18,34\n\nFor assays of colony formation in the presence of the antifolate drugs, KB cells were harvested in log phase, diluted and 100 cells were plated into 60 mm dishes in folate-free RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 2 nM LCV, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine, in the presence or absence of the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds and MTX (from 1 to 1000 nM). The highest concentrations (1000 nM) of antifolate drugs were also tested in the presence of folic acid (100 μM) to examine the protection effect. The dishes were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 10 days. At the end of the incubations, the dishes were rinsed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), 5% trichloroacetic acid, borate buffer (10 mM, pH 8.8), followed by 30 min incubation in 1% methylene blue in the borate buffer. The dishes were rinsed with borate buffer and colonies were enumerated for calculating percent colony-forming efficiency normalized to control.\n\nFR Binding Assay\n\n[3H]Folic acid binding was used to assess levels of surface FRs.38 Briefly, cells (e.g., RT16 or D4) (∼1.6×106) were rinsed twice with DPBS followed by a quick rinse with an acetate buffer (10 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 3.5) to remove FR-bound folates. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered saline (20 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, pH7.4) (HBS). Cells were incubated in HBS with [3H]folic acid (50 nM, specific activity 0.5 Ci/mmol) in the presence and absence of unlabeled folic acid or antifolate for 15 min at 0°C. The dishes were rinsed three times with ice-cold HBS, after which the cells were solubilized with 0.5 N sodium hydroxide and aliquots measured for radioactivity and protein contents. Protein concentrations were measured with Folin phenol reagent.39 Bound [3H]folic acid was calculated as pmol/mg protein. Relative binding affinities for assorted folate/antifolate substrates were determined as previously described18 and were calculated as the inverse molar ratio of unlabeled ligands required to inhibit [3H]folic acid binding by 50%. By definition, the relative affinity of folic acid is 1.\n\nPCFT-mediated transport transport assay\n\nTo assess PCFT transport activity in R2/PCFT4 and R2/VC cells, transport was assayed at pH 7.2 in HEPES-buffered saline (20 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose) and at pH 5.5 in 4-morphilinopropane sulfonic acid (MES)-buffered saline (20 mM MES, 140mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 2mM MgCl2, and 5 mM glucose) in 2 ml suspension (1.5 × 107 cells total). Uptake of [3H]MTX (0.5 μM) was measured at 37° C for 2 min, then quenched with 10 ml of ice-cold DPBS. Cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS (3x) and solubilized with 0.5 N NaOH. Levels of intracellular radioactivity were expressed as pmol/mg protein, calculated from direct measurements of radioactivity and protein contents of cell homogenates. Protein concentrations were measured with Folin phenol reagent.39\n\nIn vitro GARFT Enzyme Inhibition Assay\n\nPurified recombinant mouse GARFTase enzyme was a gift from Dr. Richard Moran (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA).40 Enzyme activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 37°C using GARFTase (0.75 nM), α,β-GAR (11 μM) and coenzyme 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (10 μM) in HEPES buffer (75 mM, pH 7.5) with or without antifolate inhibitor (10 to 30,000 nM). The absorbance of the reaction product, 5,8-dideazafolic acid, was monitored at 295 nm over the first minute as a measure of the initial rate of enzyme activity. IC50s were calculated as the concentrations of inhibitors that resulted in a 50% decrease in the initial velocity of the GARFTase reaction.\n\nIn situ GARFT Enzyme Inhibition Assay\n\nIncorporation of [14C]glycine into [14C]FGAR as an in situ measure of endogenous GARFTase activity, was described by Beardsley et al.34 as modified by Deng et al.18 for studies with the GARFTase inhibitor LMX. For these experiments, KB cells were seeded in 4 ml complete folate-free RPMI 1640 plus 2 nM LCV in 60 mm dishes at a density of 2×106 cells per dish. On the next day, the medium was replaced with 2 ml fresh complete folate-free RPMI 1640 plus 2 nM LCV (without supplementing glutamine). Azaserine (4 μM final concentration) was added in the presence and absence of the antifolate inhibitors (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 nM). After 30 min, glutamine (final concentration, 2 mM) and [14C]glycine (final specific activity 0.1mCi/L) were added. Incubations were at 37°C for 15 h, at which time cells were washed (one time) with ice-cold folate-free RPMI 1640 plus serum. Cell pellets were dissolved in 2 ml 5% trichloroacetic acid at 0°C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (the cell protein contents in the pellets were measured), and the supernatants were extracted twice with 2 ml of ice-cold ether. The aqueous layer was passed through a 1 cm column of AG1x8 (chloride form), 100-200 mesh (BioRad, Carlsbad, CA), washed with 10 ml of 0.5N formic acid and then 10 ml of 4N formic acid, and finally eluted with eight ml 1N HCl solution. The elutants were collected and determined for radioactivity. The accumulation of radioactive FGAR was calculated as pmol per mg protein over a range of inhibitor concentrations. IC50s were calculated as the concentrations of inhibitors that resulted in a 50% decrease in FGAR synthesis.\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 4.0.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplement\n\nClick here to view.(144K, doc)\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis work was supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, CA125153 (AG) and CA53535 (LHM).
