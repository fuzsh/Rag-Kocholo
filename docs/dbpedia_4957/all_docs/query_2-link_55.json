We’ve been in that position lots of times but we’ve come through some strong tests along the way and I believe we can come through another on Sunday.”\n\nCORNISH PIRATES: Wes Davies; Rhodri McAtee, Mark Ireland, Steve Winn, Nick Jackson; Jonathan Bentley, Gavin Cattle (capt); Carl Rimmer, Rob Elloway, Alan Paver, Laurie McGlone, Ben Gulliver, Chris Morgan, Dave Ward, Blair Cowan.\n\nReplacements: Paul Andrew, Ryan Storer, Mike Myerscough, Sam Betty, Matt Evans, James Doherty, Tom Luke.\n\nMUNSTER: Sean Scanlon (UCC); Danny Barnes (Dolphin), Tom Gleeson (Cork Constitution), Jeremy Manning (Cork Constitution), Simon Zebo (Cork Constitution); Declan Cusack (Thomond), Duncan Williams (Cork Constitution); Dave Kilcoyne (UL Bohemians), Mike Sherry (Garryowen), Stephen Archer (Cork Constitution), Dave Foley (UL Bohemians), Ian Nagle (Cork Constitution), Billy Holland (Cork Constitution), Tommy O’Donnell (UL Bohemians), Peter O’Mahony (Cork Constitution) (capt).\n\nReplacements: Sean Henry (UL Bohemians), AN Other, David O’Callaghan (UCC), Paddy Butler (Shannon), Conor Murray (Garryowen), Mossie Lawlor (Shannon), Ronan O’Mahony (Garryowen)."
