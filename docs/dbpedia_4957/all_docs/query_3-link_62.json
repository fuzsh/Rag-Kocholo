        "text": "Results\n\n1) Biological validation of dorso-ventral patterning mutants as representatives of dorso-entral cell populations in the wild type embryo\n\nTo study the proteomes and the phosphoproteomes of cell populations in the early embryo (Supplementary Fig. 1A), we used mutants in which all cells in the embryo represent only one subset of the cell types present in the wild type embryo. Because we were interested in cell behaviours that affect the first step of gastrulation, which is driven by differences in cell behaviour along the DV axis, we used mutants for genes of the DV patterning pathway. The embryos were derived from mothers mutant for the genes gastrulation defective (gd), Toll (Tl), or Serpin27A (spn27A). These embryos represent dorsal, lateral and ventral cell populations as judged by the expression patterns of D-V fate determining genes (Fig 1A, Fig 1A, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1B). ‘Lateralized’ and ‘dorsalized’ embryos from Tlrm10/Tlrm9 and gd9/gd9 mothers express neither twist nor snail, whereas ventralized embryos from Toll10B/def and spn27Aex/def mothers express twist and snail around their entire circumference in the trunk region (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table 1). In embryos from Tlrm10/Tlrm9 mothers, Sog expression expands dorsally and ventrally, whereas Dpp expression expands ventrally (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table 1). These expression patterns show some variation and are not entirely homogeneous: ventralized embryos often have a gap in snail expression in a small dorsal-anterior domain around the procephalic furrow. In this region, we detected sog expression instead, suggesting ventralized embryos retain a neuroectodermal fate in a restricted area of the embryo (Fig. 1B, sog probe).\n\nBecause we want to use these mutants to identify proteins that reflect or control differential cell behaviour it was important to ascertain that the cells in these mutants recapitulate faithfully the biological qualities of the corresponding cell populations in the wild type embryo [2, 4], specifically of the localisation of the adherens junctions and the cortical actomyosin meshwork. We find that, as in the mesoderm of wildtype embryos, the adherens junctions (as visualised by immunostaining for Armadillo/μ-Catenin; Fig. 1C) relocalize apically in the ventralized mutants, but remain apico-lateral in lateralized and shift slightly more basally in dorsalized mutants, again mirroring the morphology of lateral and dorsal regions of the wildtype embryo (Supplementary Fig. 1A, Fig. 1C). Similarly, the apical actomyosin network, which we characterised in living embryos expressing a fluorescently tagged myosin light chain (sqh-mCherry, Fig. 1E,F) forms a pulsatile apical network in ventralized embryos, whereas myosin accumulates at cell junctions in lateralized embryos, and dorsalized embryos dissolve the loose apical actomyosin of the early blastoderm (Fig. 1E,F).\n\nIn summary, in terms of marker gene expression and cell behaviour, the cells in these mutants resemble the corresponding embryonic cell populations of a wild type embryo, showing that these mutant cell populations are good sources of material to analyse the proteomic and phosphoproteomic composition of the natural cell populations at the onset of gastrulation.\n\n2 ) The proteome and the phosphoproteome of four cell populations during gastrulation\n\nTo study the proteins and the phosphosites that might be relevant for cell behaviour during gastrulation, we focused on a narrow developmental time window for sample collection. We synchronised egg collections and manually collected embryos from wild type and mutant mothers aged for 165-180 minutes after egg deposition at 25°C (Stage 6, Supplementary Fig. 1A,B). We analysed their peptides and phospho-peptides with unbiased label-free quantification (LFQ) and SILAC (Stable Isotope Labelling with Amino acids in Culture [16–18]. Wild type larvae were raised with SILAC yeast as the only source of amino acids, resulting in ∼75% of labelled proteome in the progeny of the emerging female flies (Supplementary Fig. 1C, D). SILAC labelling did not affect the phosphoproteome of wild type embryos, and had only a minor effect on phosphosite intensity distribution, indicating standardisation with Lys 13/6 was a valid approach (Supplementary Fig. 1E).\n\nIn the proteomic analyses, we identified 6111 protein groups (to which, for the sake of simplicity, we will refer simply as proteins) across all genotypes. 5883 of these were detected in wild type embryos (Fig 2A), exceeding the previously reported number of protein groups found in early Drosophila embryogenesis (0-2hs: 4825; 2-4hs: 5064 proteins [15]. A small number (519/6111) were detected in individual or multiple genotypes, but not in all (Fig. 2B). This category included the DV fate determinants Doc1, Snail, Twist and dMyc (Fig. 1A,B). The phosphoproteomic analysis identified 6259 phosphosites distributed over 1847 proteins (Fig. 2C). The percentage of phosphosites detected in subsets but not all genotypes (30%, Fig. 2D) was larger than for the proteome, even though the number of proteins and the number of phosphosites was similar across all genotypes (Fig. 2A,C). 28% of the proteins (1699/6111) and 9% of the phosphosites (573/6259) differed significantly in an ANOVA test across all five populations (wild type and four mutants) (permutation-based FDR < 0.1, s0=0.1).\n\nWe determined the degree of experimental variability by generating correlation matrices both for the proteome and the phosphoproteome. For the proteome, the replicates from the same genotypes clustered together (Fig. 2E). For the phosphoproteome, the first replicate of each genotype was separated from the other two replicates (Fig. 2F). We nevertheless kept all replicates for further analyses because it was impossible to determine the experimental source for this variation.\n\nThe enrichment for proteins or phosphosites in the mutant genotypes over the wild-type ranged from near-zero to 100 fold (Fig. 2G,H). Half of the proteins or phosphosites changed by less than 1.5-fold. The fold-changes for the mesodermal fate determinants Snail (5.4 fold) and Twist (14.6 fold) were the largest among the DV fate determinants (Fig. 2G); fifty-five of the entire set of proteins showed a stronger change versus wildtype than Twist.\n\nTo test if the recovered protein populations represented the cell populations in the embryo, we analysed whether they contained known marker proteins. We first looked for the protein product of the gene that was mutated in each group of embryos. We detected both Toll and Spn27A. In Tlrm9/Tlrm10 embryos, the Tl protein was decreased in abundance and Spn27A was less abundant in embryos derived from spn27Aex/df mothers (Supplementary Fig. 2A).\n\nProteins that are known to be expressed differentially along the DV axis (Fig. 1A) were found with increased abundance in the appropriate genotypes: Snail,Twist, Mdr49, Traf4 and CG4500 in ventralized embryos; pro-neuroectodermal (lateral) factor Sog in lateralized embryos; pro-ectodermal (dorsal) factors, such as Zen, Doc1, Dtg, Net and Egr in dorsalized embryos (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Fig. 2C, D). We also identified phosphosites known to be regulated along the DV axis during gastrulation. This included phosphosites in Toll and three serines phosphorylated by CKII in positions 463, 467 and 468 [19] (Supplementary Fig. 2E). Toll was differentially phosphorylated in lateralized and ventralized embryos in serine-871 (Supplementary Fig. 2B), consistent with reported Tl phosphorylation by Pelle [20]. Phosphosites in proteins associated with the Rho pathway will be discussed below. In summary, the proteomic and phosphoproteomic screen correctly identified known differentially expressed proteins and phosphosites.\n\n3) A linear model for quantitative interpretation of the proteomes\n\nHaving established that each population contained the correct marker proteins, we could now ask which unknown proteins were changed. Our knowledge of the genetics of the dorso-ventral patterning system gives us additional criteria that we can use to analyse the data in a stringent manner. We know that the changes in the protein sets typical for the three populations along the DV axis should change in concert in a well-controlled manner in all of the mutants. Rather than simply looking for individual pair-wise changes, we can, and must, therefore impose this as an additional criterion in determining any potential proteins of interest: each protein must change in a manner that ‘makes sense’ genetically.\n\nThe assumption that each mutant represents a defined region of the embryo makes a simple prediction for the expected outcome of the measurements: the amounts of protein found in each of the mutants, normalised to the area of the embryo the corresponding region occupies, should add up to the amount of protein in the wildtype. For example, the transcription factor Snail is expressed only in the prospective mesoderm (ventral domain) in the wildtype embryo, but along the entire DV axis of ventralized embryos, and it is absent in lateralized and dorsalized embryos (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. 3A). This is also reflected correctly in the proteomes: Snail is absent in the dorsalized and lateralized proteomes, and its level is higher in the proteomes from the ventralized embryos. Thus, Snail shows an ideal behaviour in each of the DV mutant genotypes because it recapitulates the expression of Snail in the corresponding domains of a wild type embryo.\n\nWe developed a ‘linear model’ that is based on this additional genetic criterion as a means to evaluate simultaneously all DV mutant genotypes. We calculated for each protein whether it followed the rule that its level in the mutants should add up to the wildtype level by comparing that sum to its real abundance measured in the wild type embryo. The mesoderm represents approximately 20% of the circumference of the embryo [21] the lateral ectoderm, as defined by the lateral expression domains of genes such as sog, rhomboid or brinker covers 20% of the circumference on each side [11, 22], which leaves 40% for the dorsal side.\n\nTo obtain the theoretical abundance (twt) for each protein we added the mean intensity measurements (normalised, see methods) for each mutant weighted by these values (0.2 for the mesoderm, 0.4 for the lateral ectoderm, 0.4 for the dorsal region): We determined the deviation of the theoretical abundance (twt) from the measured abundance for the wildtype (mwt) as log2 of their ratio: A Log2 value of 0 for the deviation therefore indicates a perfect match between the theoretical calculation and the actual measurement. When we apply this analysis to one of the marker proteins, Snail, we arrive at a deviation value of 0.1 (1.07 in linear scale) in the case of the data set for Toll10B. This shows that for this protein, the mutants represent the regional distribution in the wildtype very well. With the dataset for spn27A, the deviation value for Snail is 1.55 (2.91 in linear scale), which indicates that this mutant genotype over-represents the ventral population, if used with the assumed weightings for the populations\n\nWe tested what ratio of the areas of the embryonic regions would give the best fit of the theoretical sum with the data in the wildtype without any prior assumption about their real area in the embryo. A parameter screen of the entire range of possible values (0 to 1 for each mutant population) yielded good fits for a range of combinations. For the two best, the area for the ventral region was larger than observed in vivo, while the third best was one for which the ventral domain corresponded to the experimentally measured value of 0.2 as did the lateral and dorsal values (Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Fig. 3B,C)]. We therefore chose this set to calculate the values for all proteins.\n\nWe found that the majority of the proteins had a deviation around zero (Fig. 3A). This would in fact be expected for any proteins that are expressed ubiquitously in the wild type and therefore present in equal amounts in all genotypes. Indeed most proteins in the early embryo are deposited by the mother during the production of the egg and are therefore present globally. Their calculated weighted sum would always be the same as the wildtype value. By contrast, this would not necessarily be expected for the proteins that show significant differences between at least two mutant conditions, i.e. the statistically significant subset. Yet, most of these also fall into the range between −0.5 and +0.5, i.e. less than 1.4 fold deviation (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table 5). This shows that the majority of proteins fit the linear model, which in turn indicates that the mutant values are good representations of protein abundance in the corresponding domains of a wild type embryo. The proteins with the most extreme deviations (more than two-fold) did not come from any well-defined class of proteins, but represented a wide range of protein ontologies (Supplementary Fig. 3D, Supplementary Table 12).\n\n4) Hierarchical clustering strategy and emerging regulation categories from the integrated proteomes\n\nTo find the proteins that function in a tissue-specific manner during gastrulation we sorted the proteins into sets that change in concert in all of the mutants in the predicted, ‘correct’ manner, again using the assumptions that underlie this study, i.e. that the changes in the different mutants would be expected to correlate with each other in logical ways, as described above.\n\nRather than focusing only on the proteins that the ANOVA had shown as significantly modulated, we included in this analysis all proteins that were detectable in the wildtype (5883/6111), even if they were undetectable in one or more mutant populations. This allows us to include the important group of proteins that show a ‘perfect’ behaviour, like Twist, Snail or Doc1, in that they are undetectable in the mutants that correspond to the regions in the normal embryo where these genes are not expressed.\n\nWe used hierarchical clustering to identify the sets of proteins that change in the mutants in the same manner. For this analysis, we ignored the quantitative extent of the changes in the mutants versus the wildtype, and only focused on the direction of change. Thus, we assigned a value of −1 to any negative change against wildtype, +1 to any positive change, and 0 for ‘no change’ with a +/-1.4 fold change as a threshold for ‘no change’. ‘Undetectable’ in a mutant implies ‘reduced vs. wildtype’ and therefore scored as −1. For example, Snail is undetectable in D and L and increased in V, and therefore has the values D = −1, L = −1 and V = 1. We did not include in our further steps those proteins that were unchanged in all genotypes (2156/6111) or those that were either upregulated or downregulated versus the wildtype in all mutants (329/6111).\n\nWe clustered the remaining 3398 proteins. Instead of the raw assignments of −1, 0 and +1, we used the Z-scores for each protein. The reason for this is that this method takes into account that value sets that represent similar relative differences between the mutants, for example, 0 −1 −1 vs. 1 −1 −1 or 1, 0, 0 are biologically more similar to each other than the raw values indicate. The z-scores for all of these cases would be 1.1547 −0.5774 −0.5774.\n\nBased on known gene expression patterns across the DV axis one would expect 6 clusters, depending on the proteins’ expression in the wildtype (Fig 3C): ventral (eg. snail), lateral (sog), dorsal (dpp), dorsal and lateral (grh or std), dorsal and ventral (ama) or lateral and ventral (neur). However, in addition to these clusters (marked as 1/D, 2/L, 5/V, 6/DL,/DV and 12/LV in Fig. 3B,C, Supplementary Table 6) the clustering yielded a further 8 clusters (Fig. 3B,C). This results from the surprising difference between the two ventralising genotypes (Fig. 3B,C,E).\n\nMost of the marker proteins above were found in their proper predicted class (Fig. 3D). Among the few allocated to clusters where the two ventral mutants differed in their behaviour, there was no general rule as to which of the two ventral mutants represented the ‘correct’ value. For example, for Heartless and Net, both of which are expressed in the mesoderm and also on the dorsal side of the embryo, one was seen with increased abundance only in serpin27A embryos, the other only in Toll10B embryos (Fig. 3D). Similarly, for genes that are excluded from the mesoderm, i.e. expressed in dorsal and lateral regions, some scored as present in lower abundance in serpin27A (e.g. crb), whereas others were reduced in Toll10B(eg. numb). We will return to the difference between Toll10B and spn27A below.\n\n5) Comparison of RNA and protein expression patterns\n\nProtein levels can be regulated post-translationally, and RNA and protein expression levels do not necessarily correlate strongly during development [23]. However, the regional distribution of proteins in the early Drosophila embryo is thought to be achieved mainly through transcriptional regulation that sets up the patterning of the AP and DV axes of the embryo [24, 25]. We therefore investigated how well the proteomes reflected known dorso-ventral modulation of gene expression.\n\nWe first looked for genes whose RNA expression patterns are reported in BDGP [26–28] in situ, (https://insitu.fruitfly.org/cgi-bin/ex/insitu.pl) to make a comparison between those with ventral expression in this data set and ours. We extracted all those genes that carry the labels ‘mesoderm’, ‘trunk mesoderm’, or ‘head mesoderm’ in BDGP (which are not mutually exclusive). 107 of the resulting set of 109 genes had their proteins detected in our analyses, and 71 had been allocated to one of the DV clusters. 60 were found in clusters that were fully or partially consistent with the reported RNA pattern (Supplementary Table 7). Of the 11 proteins among these 71 that show consistent mesodermal upregulation in both ventralizing mutants (DV cluster 5), all are reported as ventrally expressed in BDGP.\n\nThere is also a database representing an atlas of differential gene expression at single cell resolution for precisely the time window of early gastrulation [29] against which we compared the proteomes to regional RNA expression. Filtering out ubiquitously expressed genes left 8924 differentially expressed genes of which 3086 coded for 3120 proteins in our clustered proteome dataset (Fig. 4B).\n\nWe first sorted these genes according to their expression patterns into the categories used above (D, V, L, DV, DL, LV) by virtue of similarity in their expression to six reference genes (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Fig. 4A-C). In a second step, we excluded those that showed only spurious differences in expression along the DV axis, ending up with 155 genes with clear DV differences forming six DV RNA reference sets (Supplementary Table 8, Supplementary Fig. D, Fig. 4C).\n\nWe then compared our 14 protein clusters against these six RNA reference sets. We asked for each protein which RNA reference set contained its corresponding gene. Theoretically, if both classifications, i.e. the RNA reference set and the proteomes, were perfectly correct, then genes from a protein cluster should be included only in the corresponding RNA reference set. We found that the majority of RNAs had proteins in partially or fully matching clusters of the proteomes (Fig. 4D, Supplementary Fig. 4E). For example, 9 of the 13 proteins (69%) in cluster 5 (ventral-consistent) found their gene in the ‘twist’ similarity reference group (ventral; a perfect match: white in pie charts: Fig. 4D, Supplementary Fig. 4E). The next best matches (e.g. ventral plus lateral, instead of only ventral; a partial match, grey) were often also highly represented: 3 of the 4 remaining cluster 5 proteins found their gene in the ‘neur’ similarity reference group (lateral+ventral).\n\nThus, the majority of proteins had perfect or partial matches with the RNA expression, showing that two independent measurements of regional expression patterns arrive at the same allocation. This confirms in an unbiased manner that the hierarchical clustering successfully sorted the proteomes in the correct manner, further supporting the initial assumption that the mutant populations were representative of specific regions in the embryo.\n\n6) Different effects of the Toll10B and spn27A mutations on dorsal gene expression\n\nThe difference between the results for the Toll10B and spn27A embryos was an unexpected and potentially biologically interesting discovery. We investigated whether the matching of the protein distributions to their RNA expression patterns could give us further biological insights.\n\nWe find that for those clusters in which Toll10B and spn27A agree, a larger proportion of proteins is allocated to the correct RNA reference set than in the clusters in which Toll10B and spn27A differ (Fig. 4D,E, Supplementary Fig. 4E). The V cluster 5, in which Toll10B and spn27A agreed, included not only Snail and Twist but also other genes expressed in the mesoderm (Supplementary Fig. 2B), such as Mdr49 [11], CG4500 [8] and Traf4 [30].\n\nFor the proteins from the ‘ventral inconsistent’ clusters we found that the Toll10B mutant differs from the spn27A mutant in a consistent manner. Proteins classified on the basis of being upregulated in Toll10B (clusters 3, 7, 10 and 13) are often mismatched to genes with an ectodermal expression (dorsal and/or lateral RNA), whereas this does not occur for those classified based on their upregulation in spn27A (clusters 4, 11 and 14, Supplementary Fig. 4E). This means that although the morphological ventralisation and upregulation of ventral genes is strong in Toll10B mutants, the ectopic Toll signalling in the mutant fails to suppress all dorsal markers. This confirms previous suggestions that spn27A mutants retain no or almost no DV polarity whereas Toll10B embryos retain residual polarity [6, 31] and, as we now show, expression of many dorsal-specific proteins. Determining the developmental source of these differences goes beyond the scope of this study, but will warrant further investigation.\n\n7) RNA-protein match versus degree of differential expression\n\nWe wondered whether there were consistent differences between those proteins that matched their RNA and those that did not. For example, a protein with large fold-changes may be more likely to match the correct RNA distribution. Because the clustering assigned proteins only on direction and not on extent of change, clusters also contain proteins with very small differences between the DV populations, even in cases where the RNA is known to show a clear difference (eg. Traf4; Supplementary Fig. 2C).\n\nTo distinguish between strong and weak differential expression, we ranked proteins by comparing them to the protein in each cluster that showed the greatest fold changes in the mutants over wildtype. We calculated the Euclidian distance (ED) between each protein and the protein with the greatest changes in a three-dimensional space where each axis represented fold-changes in one genotype (see methods, Supplementary Table 10). Thus, proteins with the lowest ED scores are those that are closest to the most extreme protein. We then analysed if this score correlated with the degree to which a protein matched the RNA expression of the corresponding gene. We found that proteins from the ‘matching’ groups had ED-scores that were skewed towards smaller values than those with non-matching proteins (Fig. 4F) indicating that proteins with more extreme expression differences (low ED scores) are more likely to match the correct RNA expression pattern.\n\nIn summary, these approaches stratify our results in a useful manner: first, the DV clusters in which the two ventralized mutants behave consistently represent better the RNA expression patterns; second, proteins with strong fold-changes are more likely to represent the distribution of the corresponding RNA.\n\n8) The phosphoproteome of embryonic cell populations during gastrulation\n\nChanges in the abundance of phosphosites may occur for two reasons: either the protein itself varies in abundance, or the protein level is constant, but the protein is differentially phosphorylated. Combinations of these cases are possible, and protein abundance may be affected by phosphorylation itself. Since we know the changes in protein abundance, we can distinguish these cases by comparing the full proteome against the phospho-proteome (with the caveat that, for technical reasons, our measurements were done on parallel experiments rather than on the identical samples).\n\n1765 of the phospho-proteins (96%) we identified were ones that we also found in the proteome, whereas 82 had not been detected in the proteome (Fig. 5A). The match between the proteome and phosphoproteome yielded 6297 pairs of phosphosites and their host proteins across all genotypes. We tested for each differentially phosphorylated site whether its respective protein was up- or down-regulated and made this comparison for each mutant genotype versus the wildtype. For the proteome we applied the same threshold as used above for clustering (+/-1.4 fold change), and for the phosphoproteome we used +/-1.3 fold change (see methods). We found that most of the changes in phosphorylation were in proteins for which the level of the protein itself was unchanged (black and white boxes in Fig. 5B; 67 to 82% of the protein-phosphosite pairs). Among those for which the host protein showed differential abundance, 7 - 13% of their phosphosites changed in the same direction (both protein abundance and phosphorylation up, or both down), and 10 - 19% of their phosphosites changed in the opposite direction.\n\nWe first tested if the phosphoproteomes fitted the ‘linear model’ (i.e. whether the sum of the weighted mutant values corresponded to the measured values in the wildtype). We found that the majority of the phosphosites indeed fitted this model (Fig. 5C, Supplementary Table 5). Among the strongly deviating phosphoproteins, we find a number of kinases with known morphogenetic functions, such as Par-1, SRC42A and nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (awd) have known morphogenetic functions (Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Fig. 3E).\n\nWe clustered the phosphosites using the same procedure as for the proteome (see methods). Thresholding excluded 1234/6259 sites defined as unchanged across all comparisons against wild type. We also excluded those sites that were either upregulated or downregulated versus the wildtype in all mutants (615/6259) and clustered the remaining 3433 phosphosites, again yielding 14 DV clusters (Fig. 5D,H, Supplementary Table 6). The two ventralising mutants now clustered together, and the dorsalized mutant showed the most distinct behaviour (Fig. 5G).\n\n9) Enrichment of cytoskeletal components among differentially phosphorylated proteins\n\nOne aim of this study was to find cellular components that are differentially modified along the DV axis and that are candidates for regulating cell shape. Most likely, these cellular components are regulated by protein complexes or interacting protein networks, as already known for the regulation of actomyosin by the Rho pathway and some components of adherens junctions.\n\nSignalling through the Rho pathway provides an important mechanism involved in morphogenesis. Rho is activated and necessary for cell shape changes in the mesoderm, but we do not know the full set of the components of the pathway that are modulated in the mesoderm or elsewhere along the DV axis. Of 24 proteins associated with Rho signalling, we detected 21 in the wild type and at least one of the mutants (Fig. 5E). Most occurred at similar levels in all genotypes (including the myosin light chain), except Twinstar/Cofilin, Moesin and chickadee/Profilin, which were present in increased abundance in the ectodermal cell populations (clusters D and DL).\n\n14 of the 21 proteins were phosphorylated. The detected sites included the known phosphosites at Threonine-21 and Serine-22 in the myosin light chain, and at Serine-3 in Cofilin/Twinstar (Fig. 5F). Six of the 14 phosphorylated proteins had at least one site that was differentially phosphorylated along the DV axis (Fig. 5F). In addition to Cofilin/Twinstar, the phosphorylation state of both its regulatory kinase LIMK1 and its phosphatase Slingshot (ssh) were modulated in the D and DL clusters. Myosin light chain showed increased phosphorylation at T21 in the DL cluster (Fig. 5E,F), and RhoGEF2 and the myosin phosphatase Mbs were differentially phosphorylated in the DL and D clusters (Fig. 5E). In summary, we detected most of the elements of a well established pathway required for gastrulation and also identified new candidate regulation nodes within the Rho pathway.\n\nTo find such networks, we used a diffusion-based algorithm [32] on each of the DV clusters. The starting weight of each protein was [based on its ED score and deviation from the linear model. Since these scores existed separately for the two ventralizing mutants, we also had to conduct the analyses twice in each case, i.e once for each dataset. We focussed our further analyses only on those proteins that behaved in the same way for the two ventralising genotypes.\n\nOverall, we generated 24 protein networks for the proteome and 24 for the phosphoproteome, i.e. for each of the six DV clusters (D(1), L(2), V(5), DL(6), DV(9) and LV(12)) carried out with four different scores. The significance for each of the 48 networks was tested by comparing the values of the nodes against those obtained in 1000 random networks. Only those nodes with p-values <0.05 were included in the final networks. These networks reflect the global effect of the change in each protein on its network neighbours. To further distil the networks to the ‘active’ signatures we then investigated the local impact of this effect using an ego network analysis (see methods). The ego network analysis extracts for each seed protein those neighbours that are most similar in function and most interconnected to the seed. These nodes represent the foreground for the enrichment analysis of the cellular components, yielding a set of 83 and 87 ontology terms that were enriched for at least one condition in the proteome or phosphoproteome, respectively.\n\nWe concentrated our further analyses only on those ontology terms that were enriched for at least two of the four scores, (ED score or deviation, each for either of the ventralized genotypes for any of the DV clusters; proteome: 63, phosphoproteome: 62 cellular component terms), and used a heatmap to represent them (Fig. 6A,B and Supplementary Fig. 5A,B). The heatmaps illustrate that most of the enriched cellular components in both experiments were associated with DNA and RNA metabolism or the regulation of gene expression, which is not unexpected for this developmental period of dynamic changes in gene expression. In agreement with this, the majority of the enriched proteins and phosphoproteins were characterised as nuclear ontology classes. Because of our interest in morphogenesis we focused on the cellular components that belong to cytoskeletal, cell adhesion and vesicle trafficking categories. In the phosphoproteomes the networks enriched for cytoskeletal components were much more prevalent in the phosphoproteomes (14 of 63) than in the proteomes (3 of 62), with microtubules strongly represented (12 of 14 cellular components), in particular the alpha and beta tubulins and microtubule associated proteins such as the Kinesin Heavy Chain, and centrosomal proteins (Supplementary Table 11). Cytoskeletal proteins are often localised in the cell cortex, and we indeed find this association reflected in the results of the network analysis. The cell cortex is among the enriched components, and among the proteins in this category, we find cytoskeletal elements. For example, networks that include the actin-microtubule crosslinker Shot and the actin polymerase Profilin are enriched in the dorsal cluster; networks that include the apical polarity determinant Stardust or the Hippo pathway component Warts in the dorso-lateral cluster. A phosphoprotein network associated with adherens junctions and zonula adherens one of which contains the junction-actin connectors Canoe and Girdin [33, 34]was enriched in the D cluster (Supplementary Table 11).\n\nIn summary, we can highlight two outcomes of the network propagation analysis. First, most networks, whether derived from the proteomes or the phosphoproteomes, are enriched for cellular components associated with regulation of gene expression (transcription, epigenetic regulation, translation, protein turnover). This is a useful validation of the approach, in that it reflects the main biological process that occurs at this stage of development: giving cells in the body different developmental fates, which is achieved through setting up different gene expression programmes.\n\nSecondly, the cytoskeleton emerges as a major target of regulation, especially in the phosphoproteome, with the most prominent component being the microtubules. This is an interesting target for further exploration in the context of gastrulation and fits well with recent results that microtubules play a role in epithelial morphogenesis [35–38].\n\n10) Functional implications of networks enriched for microtubule components\n\nTo test the biological relevance of these findings, we chose microtubules (MTs) as an example to study functionally in the embryo. Before gastrulation, all cells along the DV axis have two subpopulations of MTs: a disordered apical network of non-centrosomal MTs with short, non-aligned filaments, and an ‘inverted basket’ of basal-lateral MTs originating from the centrosomes and enclosing the nucleus [35, 39] (Fig. 7A). MT dynamics correlate with acetylation (stable MTs) and tyrosination (dynamic MTs) of α-tubulin [40]. We explored in fixed embryos markers for MT dynamics along the DV axis. We detect acetylated α-tubulin only among the basal-lateral MTs (Fig. 7A, Supplementary Fig. 6A, blue arrows) whereas tyrosinated alpha-tubulin is seen in both MT populations (Supplementary Fig. 6A, arrowheads; see also Takeda et al 2018 [35]).\n\nWhen the ventral furrow begins to form, we detect differential acetylation of the basal-lateral MTs along the DV axis. In the ectoderm, MTs become increasingly acetylated but retain their original organization (Fig. 7B, Supplementary Fig. 6A). In constricting mesodermal cells, the basal-lateral MTs become less acetylated as they move basally together with the nuclei (Fig. 7B, cells along dotted line, Supplementary Fig. 6A). MTs in non-constricting mesodermal cells next to the furrow bend in the direction of cell stretching as the apical surfaces of these cells extend towards the constricting mesodermal cells at the ventral midline (Supplementary Fig. 6B, arrow). These MTs are non-acetylated, but partially tyrosinated (Supplementary Fig. 6A, blue arrowhead), and are therefore probably newly polymerized.\n\nWe depolymerised microtubules with colcemid and observed the consequences for cellular dynamics prior to and during epithelial fold formation on the ventral, lateral and dorsal sides of the embryo. To prevent cellularisation defects [41], we injected colcemid when the cellularising front had reached a depth of 15∼20 μm. Less than 1 min after the injection, most apical filamentous structures, astral MTs emanating from the centrosome, and the centrosomes themselves disappeared. MTs associated with the nuclear envelope were retained (Supplementary Fig. 6C,D), consistent with the presence of acetylated MTs in the inverted basket structure, which likely resist depolymerization by colcemid.\n\nIn control embryos, nuclei moved basally for 1∼2 μm in the last ∼20 minutes of cellularisation on all three sides of the embryo. In embryos injected with colcemid, nuclei moved slightly in the opposite direction towards the very apical end of the cell (Fig. 7C-K, Supplementary Movies 1-3).\n\nDuring ventral furrow formation, nuclei moved basally in the constricting cells, creating a large gap between the nucleus and the apical surface of the cell. In colcemid-injected embryos, nuclear positioning was more randomised (Fig. 7C, t0; 7L,7M). Ultimately, the ventral furrow failed to form (Fig. 7C, t0+10’, Supplementary Movie 1).\n\nOn the lateral side of the embryo, a single or a double row of cells initiate the formation of the cephalic furrow through lateral actomyosin contraction [42]. In colcemid-injected embryos, the cephalic furrow forms normally, but with a delay of ∼5 min although nuclei are also apically positioned on the lateral side (Fig. 7F-H, Supplementary Movie 2).\n\nOn the dorsal side, the formation of dorsal folds depends on the remodelling of apical MTs, but not on myosin contractility [2, 35, 43]. All dorsal cells form an apical dome with a characteristic, curved cell apex prior to the initiation of dorsal folds (Fig. 7I, t0-5’, insets), contrasting with the flat apical surfaces of ventral and lateral cells during late cellularization. In colcemid-injected embryos, the apical surfaces of dorsal cells remain flat, supporting the model that MT-dependent force is required for apical dome formation (Fig. 7I, t0-5’, insets). At the onset of dorsal fold formation, the apical dome of the initiating cells descends from the embryo surface as a result of cell shortening, producing a cleft (Fig. 7I, t0+5’). Dome descent does not occur in the colcemid-injected embryos, and dorsal fold formation eventually fails (Fig. 7I, t0+5’, Supplementary Movie 3), supporting the current model that differential microtubule forces underly localised cell shortening, that initiates dorsal fold formation [35, 43]. In sum, depolymerization of MTs reveals distinct functional requirements of MTs in all three types of epithelial folds in the gastrulating embryo.\n\nWe next examined the effect of MT depolymerization on the apical plasma membrane. During ventral furrow formation, the apical membrane of the constricting cells produces numerous membrane blebs that result from a transient detachment of apical membrane from the contracting actin cortex [44]. Colcemid injection yields enlarged membrane blebs in constricting ventral furrow cells (Fig. 7N). Lateral and dorsal cells lack these constriction-dependent blebs. Instead, they accumulate excessive apical membrane, displaying tortuous subapical membrane just prior to the onset of gastrulation (Fig. 7O) [45, 46]. After colcemid injection, we also observed a distinct class of micron-scale membrane blebs in all dorsal cells, not limited to the dorsal fold initiating cells and unrelated to myosin-dependent apical constriction (Fig. 7O). These blebs form during mid to late cellularization, exclude MTs and are stable for minutes. The mechanistic basis of this new class of blebs would require further investigation.\n\nIn sum, as predicted by diffused network analyses, all cell populations use microtubules during gastrulation. Microtubules are required for correct nuclear positioning and cell shape homeostasis. Distinct phenotypic consequences of the apical membrane following colcemid injection suggest differential functionality in the maintenance of membrane-cortex attachment or the dynamics of apical membrane retrieval for MT networks residing on different sides of the embryo.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have presented a large-scale study of regional differences in the proteome of the early Drosophila embryo. We looked at a stage soon after the maternal to zygotic transition in gene expression, namely the onset of morphogenesis. We can compare our results to a previous study on regional differences in the proteome at this stage that used mutants, as we did, to represent different regions of the embryo, and in that regard should be directly comparable. This study was based on 2D gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry, which, while ground-breaking at the time, allowed only a small number (37) of unique proteins to be identified. All of these were also detected in our proteomes.\n\nBecause the differential detection in this study was based on PAGE it was possible to defect different protein isoforms and therefore differences that may be due to phosphorylation. Of the proteins with variable isoforms, we found that 15 were phosphorylated in our own study, of which seven show differences in the mutants, and all of these are consistent with the changes seen in the 2D-PAGE experiment [10].\n\nComparing protein abundance against RNA expression could, in principle, reveal which proteins are post-transcriptionally regulated, but this can only be done if the techniques and approaches are as near-identical as possible, and if the results are technically perfect. Thus, even comparing differential RNA expression data obtained with different methods yields only partially overlapping results. For example, an Affymetrix-based study that again used mutants to represent regions along the DV axis of the embryo [11] identified 23 genes for which the RNA levels were higher in ventralized than in lateralized or dorsalized embryos. Comparing those to the expression patterns determined by single-cell RNA sequencing [29] reveals that five appear to have little or no dorso-ventral modulation, a result that is also confirmed in the BDGP in situ hybridisation database. Those genes previously identified by genetic or functional studies, and known to be involved in mesoderm development (including marker genes like twist, snail, zfh1, htl etc) show up in all studies.\n\nThus, a comparison of our proteome data to reported RNA expression patterns has to be seen with caution. Nevertheless, such comparisons showed good matches for the abundant, well-studied genes and proteins: We detect the proteins for 13 of the 17 genes that are seen as ventrally upregulated genes in both studies [11, 29]. Of those, we see all but four as ventrally upregulated, again including known ventral marker genes.\n\nThese comparisons lead to the question of how to judge which of the differences in protein abundance or regulation are biologically relevant and therefore interesting to follow up with functional studies. Confining the selection to those that are consistent with other studies would defeat the purpose of the experiment. Similarly, choosing the extent of change as a threshold would also exclude proteins we know to play a role in morphogenesis at this stage but which show only very small differences in expression. One example is Traf4 [30], which is active in the mesoderm, but expressed there at low levels, and becomes expressed in the ectoderm as gastrulation begins. In our experiment, it was strongly downregulated in the dorsalized embryo, but showed only sub-threshold upregulation in the ventralized embryos.\n\nTo obtain a better picture of processes or cellular components involved in the functional differentiation of the cell populations, rather than looking at individual genes, we identified networks of functionally related proteins that were enriched among the differentially regulated entities. We would like to highlight here the mechanisms of differential protein degradation, mRNA regulation and microtubule modifications.\n\nA role for protein degradation in creating differential functions along the DV axis has previously been illustrated by the case of the E3-ubiquitin ligase Neuralized (Neur) which is required and upregulated in the prospective mesoderm [47]. The network analysis identified the cullin complex as differentially expressed and differentially regulated. We also find Neur in increased abundance ventrally. Known biological data thus validate the relevance of this network, which may in turn help to identify the as yet unknown targets for Neur in the mesoderm.\n\nAnother mechanism for post-transcriptional gene regulation is the differential translation or degradation of mRNAs along the dorso-ventral axis, and we find an enrichment of P-granule-related networks both in the proteome and the phosphoproteome. These networks are enriched within DV clusters with complete or partial ectodermal fate, i.e. the same clusters that show a strong uncoupling between mRNA and protein abundance. Partial agreement between mRNA and protein spatial distribution is not an exclusive feature of the gastrula: it has also been described for larval tissues derived from the ectoderm and neuroectoderm, where nearly all studied genes show mRNA/protein discordance) [48] (97.5%; N = 200 proteins). Therefore, the uncoupling between mRNA and protein abundance seems to be the rule rather than exception in at least these tissues, highlighting the importance of post-transcriptional regulation on gene expression regulation during development.\n\nThe diffused networks also showed phosphorylation of microtubules as a differentiating mechanism along the dorso-ventral axis during gastrulation, an interesting finding, because in epithelial tissues microtubules are often required for cell shape homeostasis [49] [50]. Morphogenetic cell shape changes in Drosophila for which microtubules are essential include the squamous morphogenesis of the amnioserosa [38] and the invagination of the mesoderm [36] and the salivary placode [37]. Here, we found that dorsal fold formation also requires microtubules. Ventral furrow and dorsal fold formation differ in their dependency on myosin [7], but our results show that both require microtubules for the basal relocalisation of nuclei. This requirement is functionally distinct from the association of microtubules with actomyosin during myosin-dependent tissue folding [36, 37, 51] and instead, may relate to the classic role of microtubules in vectorial trafficking and organelle localisation [52, 53]. One reason why nuclei need to be actively repositioned may be that in their apical location they constitute a physical barrier to the cell’s apical constriction.\n\nThe differential proteomes and phosphoproteomes of the Toll10B and spn27A ventralising mutants\n\nBoth Toll10B and spn27A ventralising mutations produced embryos that recapitulated known biological qualities of the mesoderm along the entire DV axis, such as the expression of ventral fate determinants, or the apical localisation of the adherens junctions. However, these similarities were not fully mirrored in their proteomes. Curiously, the spn27A proteome seemed to be more similar to the dorsalized than to the Toll10B proteome which would indicate that Toll10B embryos are ‘more’ ventral than spn27A embryos. However, most of the mesodermal marker genes (snail, twist, mdr49, wntD, neur) make an exception are more abundant in spn27A embryos. Similarly ectodermal fate markers are more strongly downregulated in spn27A than in Toll10B embryos. Specifically, Toll10B mutants fail to repress the expression of ectodermal genes such as egr, zen and crb.\n\nHow can ventralising mutations that act on the same pathway yield different proteomes? Spn27A is a serine protease inhibitor of the pathway that creates the active form of Spätzle (Spz), the ligand for Toll. Both mutations lead to constitutive activity of Toll, Toll10B through a mutation in the receptor itself [54, 55], spn27A through enabling a homogeneously high level of Spz along the DV axis [31] (rather than a peak on the ventral side). Because Spz is highly abundant it should not be a limiting factor for the activation of Toll [56] [57] (Supplementary Fig. 2A) and loss of Spn27A should enable the full activation of Toll along the embryonic DV axis. Our results indicate that constitutively active Toll does not lead to the same level of signalling as the binding of the ligand to the receptor, and that these different levels lead to unexpected differences in the downstream targets of the signalling pathway.\n\nThe biological significance of deviations from the linear model\n\nThe ‘linear model’ we formulated is based on the assumption that each mutant embryo faithfully represents one defined area of cells along the DV axis of the embryo, and that the full set of cell types in the embryo can therefore be reconstituted as the sum of the mutant cell types - weighted according to the area they occupy in the embryo. This should also be recapitulated for any individual protein expressed in the embryo. We found this to be true not only for the trivial cases of those proteins that occur at equal level in all genotypes, but also for most of the differentially modulated proteins. However, some proteins and phosphosites did not fit the model but showed strong deviations. One explanation could be that in the normal embryo the embryonic regions communicate with each other, and this communication is necessary for the expression or modification of certain proteins. These interactions cannot occur when the fates occur in isolation from each other in the mutants, and therefore some proteins would not be regulated properly and would not fit the model. Thus, wherever an interaction between the cell populations in the embryo is necessary for generating the correct expression or phosphorylation level, the linear model we proposed no longer applies; this means that strong deviations may indicate non-autonomous regulation. We do know some genes whose expression along the DV axis is determined by input from neighbouring regions, such as Sog, Ind and single-minded. We indeed find that one of those proteins, Ind, is an outlier (deviation = 2.6) with higher than predicted expression in the dorsalized and ventralized mutants, consistent with repressive input from these regions in the wildtype.\n\nAnother case of proteins not following the linear model are those that are found either in decreased or increased abundance in all genotypes, a behaviour we observed for a small percentage of proteins and phosphosites, perhaps as part of a general stress response related to the mutant situation. This is illustrated by the most extreme example, TM9SF4, which encodes an immune-related transporter that is present in all mutants at nearly 100-fold higher levels than in the wildtype. However, we did not find that this was a general rule either in the proteomes or in the phosphoproteomes: stress-related categories such as those from the ‘chaperone’ or ‘immune response’ ontology classes represented only a small percentage of proteins and phosphoproteins with the highest deviations (Supplementary Fig. 3D,E).\n\nSupplementary Figure 1.

Absence of a dot indicates the protein was not detected in a particular condition or log2 FC calculation not feasible, absence of error bars in Log2 intensity indicate protein was detected in a single replicate.\n\nDotted line indicates log2 FC = 0, log2 FC = 0.5 (for proteins) or log2 FC = 0.35 (for phosphosites).\n\nSupplementary Figure 3. Proteomic validation of dorso-ventral embryonic cell populations A). The protein-level expression of the transcription factor Snail in DV mutants phenocopies the expression pattern across DV cell populations in wild type embryos. Images (confocal, max-projected) of physical cross-sections from heat-fixed embryos showing Snail (grayscale) antibody signal in wild type, dorsalized (D), lateralized (L) and ventralized embryos (Vtl: Tl10B/def and Vsp: spn27Aex/def). B and C) Outcome of the systematic exploration for the optimal combination of cross-sectional proportions for dorsal (D), lateral (L) and ventral (V) cell populations, with each population being varied in steps of 0.05. On the x axis, the 233 possible combinations are plotted in the order of the proportions assigned to the D population, and the remaining proportion distributed between L and V. Only the values for D are indicated on the axis, see Suppl. Table 6 for the L and V values. The y axis shows the Interquartile Range (IQR) of the distribution of the Log2 Deviations obtained with each possible combination of D, L and V proportions. Calculations were performed independently for the Toll10B/def (B) or spn27Aex/def (C) data. Light blue dots indicate the best combinations with a ventral domain proportion (V = 0.2) that matches the experimentally determined region occupied by the mesoderm. D) Pie charts showing the protein class ontology (http://www.pantherdb.org/) of proteins with the highest absolute deviations (95th percentile). Inset pie chart shows the children ontology terms for the ‘Metabolite interconversion enzyme’ class. E) Pie charts showing the protein class (Panther) ontology of the host proteins for phosphosites with the 5% most extreme absolute deviations (> 95th percentile). The left pie chart shows the children ontology terms for the ‘Metabolite interconversion enzyme’ class.\n\nSupplementary Figure 4. Methodology and supporting data for the comparison between RNA and protein abundance.\n\nA) Methodology for clustering non-ubiquitous genes according to their dorso-ventral RNA expression.\n\nB) Swarm plot showing the distribution of the maximum Pearson spatial correlation values, used for the assignment of non-ubiquitous genes to a particular DV RNA sets. Each dot is a gene. DV RNA sets are mutually exclusive. Bars indicate median and the inter-quartile range (IQR).\n\nC) Number of non-ubiquitous genes allocated to each DV RNA reference set using the Pearson spatial correlation to reference genes (panel B and Fig. 4A).\n\nD) Maximum Pearson correlation values for increasing percentiles within the distributions of each RNA reference set. To assemble the DV RNA reference sets (Fig. 4C), we filtered the genes that at the RNA level displayed the largest variation along the dorso-ventral axis. For this, we selected genes with a maximum Pearson correlation value larger than the 95% percentile (arrow) of the corresponding DV RNA set distribution.\n\nE) Matching of genes in the RNA reference sets with the proteome DV clusters in which the ventralized mutants display a non-consistent behaviour against the wild type (DV clusters 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11, see Fig. 3B,C). Coloured pie charts represent the allocation of genes within each DV cluster to the RNA reference sets (colour code as in Fig. 3C). Grayscale pie charts represent the outcome of the comparison for filtered genes: white: perfect for an exact match, grey: partial, if the RNA reference included the correct match but also another region, black: mismatch, where the protein expression did not overlap with the RNA reference. Values in the centre of pie charts indicate the number of genes compared.\n\nF) Comparison between the identity of genes in the RNA reference sets with DV clusters 13 and 14, (Fig. 3B,C), with proteins that displayed increased abundance in all DV mutants (vs. wild type) with the exception of either of the ventralized genotypes (DLVtl or DLVsp). Coloured pie charts represent the allocation of genes within these DV clusters to the DV RNA reference sets (Blue: dorsal, magenta: lateral, yellow: ventral, cyan: dorsal+lateral, green: dorsal+ventral, pink: lateral+ventral).\n\nSupplementary Figure 5.

Microtubule analyses during gastrulation and calibration of colcemid injections.\n\nA) Image (confocal, max-projected) of a physical cross-section from fixed embryos stained with antibodies against tyrosinated (magenta) and acetylated (green) α-tubulin during ventral furrow formation. Arrow: detection of acetylated α-tubulin specifically in basal-lateral microtubules (inverted basket); blue arrowhead: tyrosinated α-tubulin in sub-apical microtubules; red arrowhead: tyrosinated α-tubulin in basal-lateral microtubules. Insets show acetylated and tyrosinated α-tubulin in stretching and constricting mesodermal cells; arrowheads/arrow in insets show differential acetylation and tyrosination of microtubules in a mesodermal cell undergoing stretching. Scale bar is 50 μm.\n\nB) Images (OMX super-resolution microscope, max-projected) of stretching mesoderm cells (ventral domain) from fixed embryos stained using antibodies against E-cadherin (magenta in top panels; grayscale in middle panels) and α-Tubulin (green in top panels; grayscale in bottom panels). A stretching mesodermal cell (yellow-coloured) was cropped and shown with superficial (left panel) and resliced (to show ‘y-z’ planes) views. The ventral furrow is located to the right of the field of view. Arrow indicates a microtubule in the sub-apical domain that is bent towards the direction of cell stretching (furrow). Scale bar is 10 μm.\n\n(C, D) Time lapse series of microtubules labelled with EMTB-3xEGFP at the levels of the apical cell surface, centrosomes and nuclei (inverted basket) prior to and following water C) or colcemid D) injection. The time gap between pre-injection recording and post-injection t = 0 is ∼2’."
