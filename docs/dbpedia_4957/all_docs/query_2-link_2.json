        "text": "It's a wrap on United Nations Behavioural Science Week 2024! üéâ I was pleased to speak on the High-Level Opening on embedding behavioural science into the work of the UN, noting that in our work as UN Women advancing gender equality we consistently face barriers such as negative gender and social norms, behaviours, and attitudes that perpetuate gender-based discrimination and inequalities. Changing these norms is at the heart of our work. Drawing on experiences from our work to drive changes in gender roles and relations in Nepal to our global convening of the Unstereotype Alliance to eliminate harmful stereotypes in advertising, I shared three insights: üí° Context is paramount. Multiple interconnecting factors shape social norms and human behaviour drivers. Therefore, behavioural change and social norms change should be part of an overall package of interventions. An intervention in one community to change gender norms may not necessarily yield the same results in a neighboring one due to differing contextual factors. üí° Partnerships are critical. Universities and think tanks are oft-cited examples of partnerships in BeSci, but they are not the only ones. Communities and civil society organizations possess a wealth of critical contextual and practice-based knowledge that is indispensable for change. üí° We must guard against projects in BeSci that do more harm than good because they do not consider gender equality from the outset. We should mandate and establish clear criteria for the inclusion of gender equality considerations in all initiatives aimed at achieving behavioural change. üëâ Watch the panel here: https://lnkd.in/g6UaGd8j #behaviouralscience #genderequality #SDG5\n\nEpiscopal Relief & Development work in reducing gender-based violence #GBV takes a multi-pronged approach to social and behavior change #SBC that is rooted around the role of religion and culture and focusing on faith leaders influence in both maintaining the status quo or changing social norms and individual behaviors. Leaders are first mobilized and equipped as agents of change and supported as they speak out, lead SBC dialogues and take action to prevent and respond to GBV. This involves engaging in an experiential learning process with scriptures to cha be their own beliefs prior to committing to eliminating violence against women and girls #EWAG #activism To better facilitate this process, we also use a Facts, Association, Meaning and Action #FAMA process with picture cards that encourages Faith Leaders and community members to reflect, share personal stories and formulate their own ideas and solutions to #VAWG\n\nHere are some practical tips for practioners, researchers, policy makers and donors on conducting feminist research from COFEM's Tip sheet 5 on Feminist approaches to building knowledge and evidence on GBV. üí° Conduct evaluations and document your own practice based learning. (See our Feminist Research Assessment Tool here: https://lnkd.in/dnjmaE9J) üì£ Advocate for and support feminist research on GBV ü§ù Collaborate with local research teams and promote the leadership of female researchers ‚úç Learn about the purposes and principles of feminist research and embed them within all research seeking to build knowledge and evidence about GBV Learn more about feminist approaches to building knowledge and evidence on GBV here: https://lnkd.in/d9zrJDKZ\n\nOn last Friday, 8th of March, everybody talked about women and women‚Äôs rights. I think it‚Äôs great that we have a special day (and men have their own), at the same time all days of the year should be ‚Äúequality days‚Äù, not only one day per year. I have twins ‚Äì a girl and a boy ‚Äì, and I always think when there is a talk about women‚Äôs lower salary or possibilities to be a ‚Äúboss‚Äù in big corporates, why should I say to my daughter in the future that it‚Äôs fine when her brother is owning more or getting more only due to his gender. I encourage everybody to prolong women‚Äôs day for the whole year and rather celebrate humans. Here is the video we created some time ago with different facts where currently girls and women are not in a good position. I hope after some years we have changed the statistics. https://lnkd.in/dM2b9E5z #equality #sustainability #branding"
