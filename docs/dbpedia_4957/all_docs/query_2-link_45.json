        "text": "Glasgow came, they conquered and just like that Munster’s season is over, along with the opportunity to defend their title of URC Champions. Departing players especially Simon Zebo, Antoine Frisch and RG Snyman deserved one last game in Thomond but sport can be cruel. Regrets, they will have quite a few as Munster were masters […]\n\nKnock-out rugby at the end of a long season, especially for those involved in the World Cup and Six Nations is a good time to be pragmatic. Take the points, save energy and reduce risk of injuries. Munster did just that in the second half. Taking their 17-7 lead from half time and adding 2 […]\n\nLast season Munster had to go on the road to Glasgow, Dublin and Cape Town to secure their first silverware since 2011. This season an excellent run of games in 2024 made up for the rocky start to the season as the injury profile improved. With selection headaches to consider and especially opting for an […]\n\nIt’s that time of the season where you would be hopeful of packing away the thermals and rain gear but in Ireland there are no guarantees. However on Saturday the forecast for the 5.15 kick-off confirmed it was tee-shirt weather. Those on the east basked in the sunshine, glad of their shades or caps. There […]\n\nClub socks to the fore for Origins Round made for a colourful sight on another baltic night in Cork with a significant wind chill factor. Some players wore odd socks to reflect their ties to schools and clubs that were instrumental in developing their skills and love of the game. The conditions were also a […]\n\nThe Toulon battlecry prior to kickoff certainly gets the blood pumping and the supporters engaged but it was the warriors from Munster who were celebrating by the final whistle. After absorbing attack after attack before some brilliant counter punching or in many cases kicking they came away with a bonus point try scoring performance to again […]\n\nWe could hear them singing during the warm-up, laying down their marker in the terraces and stands, waving their blue and white flags, letting us know they had travelled in numbers to support their team as they made their debut in the European Cup. Their team responded, putting in a very physical and skilful performance […]\n\nLast week I was surprised to see Thomas Ahern named at #6 in the team but liked the lineout option he provided from the back row. This week it wasn’t such a surprise and I enjoyed seeing him in action as he put in a player of the match performance, scoring two tries and showing […]\n\nA fast paced high scoring game to keep us warm on a chilly, blustery November evening in Cork. Young flyhalf Tony Butler made an early break before putting player of the match Calvin Nash in space. While that attack eventually broke down it was a good early statement of intent for the following 78 minutes! […]\n\nWith 6 of the forwards and Rory Scannell sporting headgear it was more difficult to keep track of who was who at times during the game but it was great to get back to Thomond and to enjoy a positive start to the new season. With the internationals away there was an opportunity for some […]"
