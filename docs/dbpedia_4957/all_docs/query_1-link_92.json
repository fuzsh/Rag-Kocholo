        "text": "sfGFP controlled by inducible araC/pBAD promoter\n\nsfGFP is a bright green monomeric fluorescent protein. In this composite, its expression is regulated by the araC/pBad promoter and by a strong RBS. sfGFP presents a maximum pick of excitation at 485 nm and a maximum pick of emission at 510. sfGFP was engineered from GFP to achieve a faster maturation and a higher stability.\n\nSequence and Features\n\nFunctional Parameters\n\nIn order to test the functionality of this protein under the araC/pBad promoter, the absorbance and the fluorescence spectra were measured after induction with 0.002% arabinose (Figure 1).\n\nThis protein is part of a collection of split proteins developed for BiFC analysis and tested with the CpxR system (BBa_K2387032). These proteins were characterized through multiple experiments using as interacting proteins antiparallel synthetic leucine zippers. The proteins of this collection are the ones found in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Split Proteins. Protein Part Number (Full length) Part Number (Split Protein) mRFP BBa_K2387054 BBa_K2387055 eYFP BBa_K2387003 BBa_K2387065 mVenus BBa_K2387045 BBa_K2387046 sfGFP BBa_K2387047 BBa_K2387048 mCerulean BBa_K2387052 BBa_K2387053\n\nFor comparing our split fluorescent proteins, the first factor we determined was a comparison between the performance of split fluorescent proteins versus the full length versions. For this test, we grew E. coli expressing split and full length fluorescent proteins in M9 minimal medium while measuring at the same time the evolution of fluorescence. The relative fluorescence of the split fluorescent proteins in relation to the full length proteins was calculated comparing the maximum values of fluorescence (Figure 2).\n\nAs can be observed, split mVenus and split sfGFP excel in comparison to the other proteins, showing that the reassembly of the split portions of these proteins is more efficient than for other ones.\n\nAnother parameter we measured to choose the best reporter was the Quantum Yields (QY) of the split fluorescent proteins, which relates the light absorbed and the emitted fluorescence. Therefore, the QY can be used as an estimation for the brightness of the fluorescent proteins. The QY must be calculated in comparison to a reference using the same wavelength for excitation. The full proteins were used as standards for the split proteins, as their QY has already been calculated previously. The calculated QY can be found in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Quantum Yields (QY) calculated for split proteins. Protein QY Full Protein Reference Part Number (Full length) QY Split Protein Part Number (Split) mRFP 0.15 Guido, J, et al. (2006) BBa_K2387054 0.06±0.04 BBa_K2387055 eYFP 0.61 Nagai, T., et al. (2005) BBa_K2387003 0.004±0.027 BBa_K2387065 mVenus 0.57 Nagai, T., et al. (2005) BBa_K2387045 0.61±0.06 BBa_K2387046 sfGFP 0.65 Pédelacq, J., et al. (2004) BBa_K2387047 1.3±0.2 BBa_K2387048 mCerulean 0.62 Rizzo, M. A., et al. (2004) BBa_K2387052 0.51±0.08 BBa_K2387053\n\nAs observed in Table 2, mRFP and eYFP show much lower QY when compared to the full proteins. Both mVenus and mCerulean show QY values similar to those of the full proteins, which indicates that these two proteins are good candidates in terms of brightness. However, the results show that the split sfGFP is even better than the full sfGFP. This may be due to background noise in the absorbance of the full sfGFP, which would alter the results. Nevertheless, although it is likely that splitting sfGFP does not increase the QY, the high value of QY for the split sfGFP show that this split protein can be considered bright.\n\nThe next factor we took into account was the maturation rate of the fluorescent proteins. This rate can be calculated as the half-time, which is the time at which half of the maximum fluorescence is reached. The maturation rates can be found in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Maturation rates determined as t1/2 (min). Protein Full Protein (min) Part Number (Full length) Split Protein (min) Part Number (Split) mRFP 32±1 BBa_K2387054 54±3 BBa_K2387055 eYFP 18±4 BBa_K2387003 19±1 BBa_K2387065 mVenus 41±5 BBa_K2387045 59±8 BBa_K2387046 sfGFP 20.7±0.7 BBa_K2387047 25±7 BBa_K2387048 mCerulean 11.6±0.9 BBa_K2387052 22±4 BBa_K2387053\n\nAccording to the results, eYFP and mCerulean are the fastest ones although the difference with sfGFP is not too big. However, we have already observed that eYFP shows a weak fluorescence intensity, so the time it takes it to reach a detectable fluorescence will be longer than the one for sfGFP and mCerulean.\n\nThe last characteristic we wanted our report to has was thermostability. We tested the evolution of fluorescence for 3 hours at different temperatures: 4°C, 10°C, 20°C (Room Temperature), 30°C, 45°C (possible temperature in tropical regions) and 60°C. The results are shown in Figure 3.\n\nThe graph shows that two of the proteins generate the most fluorescence when incubated at 45°C: mRFP and sfGFP, both in their full-length and split versions However, for mCerulean the full protein and its split version showed different behaviours. While full-length mCerulean matures best at 45°C, its split version shows more fluorescence at 20°C. This difference may be caused by a lower structural stability of the split fragments of mCerulean at higher temperatures.\n\nProtocols\n\nCell lysis\n\n1.
