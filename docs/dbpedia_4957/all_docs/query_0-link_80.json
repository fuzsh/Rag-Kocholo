As recovery turned into vigorous expansion, the emphasis of Federal Reserve policy shifted from facilitating recovery to restraining inflationary developments in the interest of sustainable economic growth. In order to keep expansion of bank credit and money within limits compatible with the increase in production, the Federal Reserve permitted pressure on bank reserve positions to increase gradually, and Federal Reserve Banks raised discount rates four times during the year. In response to these developments, commercial banks limited their credit and deposit expansion. Direct lending by bank and nonbank lenders expanded sharply in 1955, while capital raised by security flotations increased only slightly from the preceding year. Commercial banks increased their business loans by a record amount. In addition, they contributed to the growth in consumer and real estate credit both through direct lending and indirectly by making funds available to nonbank lenders. In order to finance their lending activities, commercial banks liquidated United States Government securities, particularly shortterm issues, and reduced their purchases of State and local government securities. Despite a record loan expansion, the growth in aggregate bank credit and deposits was less in 1955 than a year earlier. Nonbank investors purchased United States Government securities sold by commercial banks and absorbed the increase in outstanding corporate and State and local government securities. They also increased their consumer and mortgage lending. The continuing pressure on commercial bank resources in 1955 was reflected in an increase in bank indebtedness to the Federal Reserve Banks. Indebtedness increased from an average of $150 million in the fourth quarter of 1954 to more than $900 million in the corresponding quarter of 1955. The increase in indebtedness and the decline in holdings of short-term Government securities tended to reduce bank liquidity and to have a moderating effect on further bank loan expansion. Interest rates rose in response to the increase in credit demand and the pressure on bank reserve positions. Short-term rates rose sharply to the highest level in more than 20 years. Long-term rates rose only moderately, and the spread between short-term and long-term rates narrowed to the smallest margin in recent years. During the early weeks of 1956, bank credit and deposits showed larger seasonal declines than during the corresponding period of 1955. Reserve positions of banks tightened somewhat, after some easing in the latter part of December, but interest rates declined from the high level reached near the end of 1955. 97 98 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • FEBRUARY 1956 BANK LOANS AND INVESTMENTS and construction groups. In 1954 a decline in loans to metal manufacturers, public utilities, and sales finance companies had been offset only in part by expansion of loans to other groups. Business loans of commercial banks increased $2 billion in the first half of 1955, compared with declines in the corresponding period of the preceding three years. Seasonal repayments of bank loans by food processors and commodity dealers totaling $1 billion were more than offset by increases in loans to most other groups of businesses. In the second half of the year the increase in business loans totaled about $4 billion as seasonal borrowers added their demands to the continued heavy demands of other groups. A particularly sharp increase in loans to sales finance companies in December was offset in part by a decline in privately placed finance company paper outstanding. Commercial bank loans and investments increased about. $4.5 billion or 3 per cent during 1955. A record loan expansion of $11.6 billion was offset in large part by a decline in bank holdings of United States Government securities, as the table on the following page shows. The growth of total loans and investments was about equal to that in 1953, but less than half as large as in 1954. In 1954 loans had increased only $3 billion, but holdings of United States Government and other securities had increased more than $7 billion. Lending activity. An expansion of more than 20 per cent or $6 billion in business loans accounted for about half of the growth in bank loans in 1955. This expansion, the largest percentagewise since 1950, contrasted with declines in 1953 and 1954. As is shown in the chart, about $1.3 billion of the growth during 1955 was in loans by city banks to sales finance companies, which were borrowing mainly to finance consumers and dealers in consumer durable goods. There was also a substantial increase in bank loans to most other business groups, including the petroleum and chemical industries, public utilities, and the metal, textile, trade BUSINESS LOANS - Bank loans to business declined in the early weeks of 1956 as sales finance companies and seasonal industries repaid bank indebtedness. Indebtedness of metal manufacturers, petroleum and chemical companies, and public utilities continued to expand.

NOTE.—Data exclude interbank loans. Total loans are after, and types of loans before, deductions for valuation reserves. Consumer and other loans are partly estimated for all dates. Details may not add to totals because of rounding. Real estate loans of commercial banks expanded $2.4 billion during 1955. The 13 per cent rate of growth for the year was about the same as in the second half of 1954 and the highest for a full year since 1950. Expansion in 1955 reflected city bank purchases of mortgages on a temporary basis from insurance companies and other nonbank investors as well as direct lending by banks. Late in the year the rate of growth of real estate loans at city banks declined, probably in part as a result of the resale of some mortgages previously acquired from nonbank investors. In addition to lending a large amount to sales finance companies, commercial banks increased their own holdings of consumer loans $2 billion or almost 20 per cent. Such loans had changed little in 1954. The growth of consumer credit in 1955 reflected a large increase in expenditures for consumer durable goods, particularly automobiles, and some easing of credit terms during late 1954 and most of 1955. Expansion of consumer credit slackened late in 1955. Security loans of banks increased less in 1955 than in the preceding year. Credit extended by banks for purchasing or carrying securities had expanded sharply in 1954 and early in 1955 as stock market trading and stock prices increased. In the first four months of 1955 the Board of Governors raised margin requirements for purchasing or carrying listed securities twice, from 50 to 70 per cent. Growth in security loans slackened thereafter. A decline in agricultural loans of banks during 1955 reflected redemption of publicly issued Commodity Credit Corporation certificates of interest. Agricultural production loans at member banks increased about 15 per cent. Investment activity. About two-thirds of the increase in commercial bank loans in 1955 was offset by sales of United States Government securities totaling $7.3 billion. The 10 per cent decline in holdings was the largest for a calendar year since 1946. Bank sales during 1955 were offset by purchases by nonbank investors, as the chart on the following page shows, especially by nonfinancial corporations, individuals, State and local governments, and miscellaneous investors. In 1954, when the publicly held debt increased more than $2 billion, banks had made net purchases of such securities totaling $5.5 billion and nonbank investors and Federal Reserve Banks had reduced their portfolios. About $5.6 billion of the reduction in commercial bank holdings of Government securities during 1955 occurred in the first six months of the year, when the Treasury 100 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • FEBRUARY 1956 CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP OF FEDERAL DEBT Billions of dollors 10 NONBANK INVESTORS -5 • COMMERCIAL BANKS 1955 1953 1954 -10 NOTE.—Excludes holdings by U. S. Govt. investment accounts. Nonbank investors include mutual savings banks. Distribution between bank and nonbank investors for 1955 is preliminary. used a seasonal surplus to retire more than $5 billion of publicly held debt. A further reduction occurred in the second half of the year despite the seasonal increase in the public debt. Banks continued to liquidate Government securities in early 1956. Most of the reduction in bank holdings of Government securities in 1955 was in shortterm issues. Securities maturing within one year, which had been reduced from 45 to 25 per cent of bank portfolios during 1954 as a result largely of Treasury refunding operations, declined to about 15 per cent of their portfolios by the end of 1955. The decrease in bank holdings of short-term securities reduced bank liquidity and thus tended to discourage further bank sales of securities in order to expand loans. Commercial bank holdings of corporate and State and local government securities changed little in 1955. During 1954 banks had made net purchases of tax-exempt State and local government securities totaling nearly $2 billion. Although all classes of banks reduced their security portfolios during 1955, the reduction was particularly great on the part of New York City banks, which lost deposits to reserve city and country banks and also increased their loans proportionately more than other banks. New York central reserve city banks reduced their holdings of United States Government securities almost 30 per cent, compared with an increase of 20 per cent in 1954. Country member banks, which increased their loans by a smaller percentage than city banks, reduced their Government security portfolios less than 5 per cent. New York banks also sold securities other than United States Government securities on balance, while country banks purchased such securities. DEPOSITS AND CURRENCY The rate of growth of deposits and currency declined in 1955 from the rapid rate reached in the second half of 1954, when banks were using available reserve funds to expand holdings of securities. Demand deposits and currency held by consumers and businesses, which together constitute the active part of the money supply, increased $3.2 billion or 2.5 per cent in 1955. The rate of expansion was less than that for 1954 as a whole, as shown in the chart, and only about half the annual rate in the second half of that year, after allowance for usual seasonal developments. The active money supply had also increased about 2.5 per cent in the period of strong credit demand from mid-1952 to mid-1953. In the early weeks of 1956, demand deposits and currency apparently declined about the usual seasonal amount. Demand deposits held by consumers and businesses increased $2.6 billion and currency expanded $0.6 billion during 1955. In 1954 the increase in demand deposits had been greater, but currency holdings of individuals and businesses had declined. 101 BANK CREDIT AND MONEY DEMAND DEPOSITS AND CURRENCY Percentage change for year 10 — INCREASE 1 1 -- 5 with a small increase in 1954. These deposits fluctuated over the year in accordance with the pattern of Treasury receipts and expenditures. FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY AND BANK RESERVE POSITIONS 1 —1 I\" DECREASE -5 1955 1948 1953 NOTE.—Demand deposits are for all banks in the United States and exclude U. S. Govt. and interbank deposits and items in process of collection. Currency excludes bank vault cash. Changes for 1946 and 1947 are partly estimated, and 1955 data are preliminary. While expansion of the active money supply was moderate, an increase in its turnover accompanied the rising level of expenditures. The annual rate of turnover of demand deposits outside New York City rose from 21.1 in the last quarter of 1954 to 22.5 in the last quarter of 1955, an increase of almost 7 per cent. Most of the increase occurred in the first half of the year. Expansion of time and savings deposits in commercial and mutual savings banks and the Postal Savings System in 1955 was $3 billion, only about three-fifths as much as a year earlier. Reduction in the rate of growth was associated in part with a reduced rate of personal saving and increased security purchases by individuals. At commercial banks, savings deposits increased less than half as much as in 1954. Deposits at mutual savings banks expanded almost as much as a year earlier, probably in part because of increases in interest rates paid by banks in some areas. Savings and loan shares rose somewhat more than in 1954. United States Government deposits declined $700 million during 1955, compared Growth of bank credit and deposits was moderated during 1955 through a gradual change of Federal Reserve policy from ease to restraint. This restraint was exercised by conducting open market operations so as to permit credit expansion to exert growing pressure on bank reserve positions and thus make it necessary for banks to borrow to meet some of their reserve needs. In the fourth quarter of 1954 excess reserves less borrowing of member banks at the Reserve Banks averaged $600 million, but by the last quarter of 1955 borrowing exceeded excess reserves by $350 million. In early February 1956 net borrowed reserves were somewhat higher than the fourth quarter average. Open market operations and bank reserve positions. Late in 1954 the Federal Reserve had limited its purchases of United States Government securities in the open market and permitted the seasonal credit and currency expansion to be reflected in slightly less easy reserve positions. Early in 1955 the Federal Reserve reduced its holdings of Government securities by $1.3 billion. These sales were primarily for the purpose of absorbing reserve funds made available by the seasonal decline in currency and in required reserves, as shown in the chart on the following page. In view or the strong credit demand, however, some pressure was exerted on bank reserve positions. Member bank indebtedness to the Federal Reserve Banks, which had averaged about $150 million in the fourth quarter of 1954, 102 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • FEBRUARY 1956 exceeded $400 million in the second quarter of 1955. Excess reserves declined from $750 million to less than $600 million. Reserve city and country banks accounted for most of the borrowing in the second quarter as well as the reduction in excess reserves. The Federal Reserve purchased $1.2 billion of Government securities in the second half of 1955, mainly in July and December. These purchases supplied part of the reserve MEMIER BANK RESERVES AND RELATED ITEMS Billions of dollars 32 30 28 26 24 22 RESERVES 20 18 .BORROWINGS — EXCESS RESERVES 1954 1955 '56 1952 1953 NOTE.—Monthly averages of daily figures. Latest data are for January 1956. Required and excess reserves for January are preliminary. funds needed to meet seasonal increases in currency and required reserves, but pressure on reserve positions increased further during the period. In November member bank borrowing exceeded $1 billion, the largest volume since the spring of 1953. The increase in indebtedness after midyear reflected mainly borrowing by central reserve city banks and reserve city banks. Member bank indebtedness declined during December as Federal Reserve security purchases and an unusually large seasonal increase in Federal Reserve float more than offset seasonal drains on reserves. Money markets continued under pressure, however, as a result of year-end desires for liquidity. Outright purchases of Government securities by the Federal Reserve totaled almost $500 million in late November and December. In late December, as in the same period of most other recent years, the Federal Reserve purchased securities under repurchase agreements with dealers and brokers. Over the year ending in December 1955, the Federal Reserve portfolio of United States Government securities was reduced, but the largest drain on member bank reserves came from the increase in currency in circulation. Required reserves increased somewhat as the effect of an expansion of demand and time deposits held by consumers and businesses was offset only in part by a decline in United States Government deposits and a shift of deposits from banks with higher reserve requirements to those with lower reserve requirements. In January and the first half of February 1956, the Federal Reserve reduced its holdings of Government securities by $1.4 billion. Together with a decline in Federal Reserve float, these sales more than offset the effect of factors supplying reserve funds seasonally. As a result, member bank indebtedness in late January and early February reached its early-December level. Other policy actions. The growing pressure on bank reserve positions in 1955 tended to restrain bank credit and deposit expansion. This effect was reinforced by four increases in Federal Reserve Bank discount rates during the year. In April and May discount rates were raised from \\Vz BANK CREDIT AND MONEY to 13A per cent in all districts. In August and September they were increased to 2lA per cent in a single step in the Cleveland District and in two steps in other districts. A further increase in November brought them to 2Vi per cent, the highest level for more than 20 years. By making borrowing more expensive, the discount rate increases tended to discourage excessive use of the discount privilege by individual member banks. Changes in discount rates also had an important influence on the level of shortterm open market rates and their changes during 1955. In late March the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began to purchase bankers' acceptances on a small scale. These purchases, the first since 1951, were made in recognition of the increased use of bankers' acceptances. The Board of Governors raised margin requirements for purchasing and carrying listed securities from 50 to 60 per cent in early January and to 70 per cent in late April. These actions were taken to help prevent an excessive expansion of stock market credit at a time when stock trading was active and prices were rising rapidly. CREDIT EXPANSION BY NONBANK LENDERS Although the growth of bank credit and money in 1955 was moderate, aggregate credit expansion by all lenders was the largest for a calendar year since the war. Nonbank lenders increased their mortgage and consumer loans sharply. They also acquired a large volume of new security issues of corporations and State and local governments and took over United States Government securities sold by commercial banks. Selected credit uses. The expansion in real estate lending in 1955 absorbed a large share of the funds available for long-term lending 103 and investing. Bank and nonbank lenders together increased their real estate loans by a record $16.7 billion, compared with $12.5 billion in 1954. After expanding at an accelerating rate throughout 1954, mortgage loans continued to increase until the summer of 1955 at about the rate reached in late 1954. A slackening of growth late in 1955 accompanied a decline in housing starts from the exceptionally high level reached earlier. In July 1955 maximum maturities for Federally underwritten loans were reduced and minimum down payments increased, but in January 1956 the 30-year maximum maturity was restored. Aggregate corporate and State and local government security issues for new capital were about 4 percent larger in 1955 than a year earlier. An increase of one-fifth in corporate security issues reflected primarily flotations by sales finance companies. State and local government issues declined about one-eighth from 1954, largely as the result of a reduction in toll road financing. The publicly held United States Government debt—that is, securities held by investors other than Government investment accounts—changed little in 1955, compared with an increase of more than $2 billion in 1954. For the calendar year, cash receipts from the public were less than $1 billion below expenditures, and the Treasury drew down its balances with commercial and Federal Reserve Banks. Security issues for cash were in part for the purpose of offsetting debt repayment due to attrition on issues refunded and to maturities of nonmarketable savings notes. The Treasury redeemed marketable tax anticipation securities in the first half of the year, when it had a seasonal surplus of receipts over expenditures, and issued tax anticipation securities in the second half. 104 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • FEBRUARY 1956 The average maturity of the marketable Federal debt, which had been lengthened from 62 to 67 months in 1954 largely through Treasury refunding operations, changed little in 1955. The effect of the issuance of $2.7 billion of 40-year bonds and several new notes maturing in less than three years was offset by the approach to maturity of outstanding securities together with new issues of short-term securities. Supply of funds. All major groups of lenders increased their mortgage lending in 1955. Savings institutions financed such lending in part by borrowing or by liquidating securities or limiting security purchases. Despite a record inflow of savings, savings and loan associations obtained additional funds by increasing their indebtedness to the Federal home loan banks. Life insurance companies sold United States Government securities and reduced their purchases of other securities, and also obtained temporary financing from commercial banks. Mutual savings banks sold both United States Government and other securities on balance. During 1955 investors other than the major financial institutions absorbed a growing share of the expansion in outstanding corporate and State and local government securities and took over a large volume of United States Government securities from institutional investors, particularly commercial banks. They financed these purchases by drawing on accumulated cash balances as well as current savings. INTEREST RATES Interest rates, which had advanced late in 1954, continued to rise in 1955 in response to the strong demand for credit and the growing pressure on bank reserve positions. The largest increase was in yields on short- term securities, which are particularly responsive to changes in bank reserve positions. At the end of the year, most shortterm rates were at the highest levels in more than 20 years. These rates declined during January 1956 but remained close to or above their mid-195 3 peaks. Yields on long-term securities in late 1955 and early 1956 were only slightly above short-term rates. Yields on short-term Treasury securities, which had increased about Vi percentage point in the second half of 1954, increased about 1 Vi percentage points further during 1955, as shown in the chart.

Long-term U. S. Govt. yields are on long-term VA per cent bonds. Latest data shown are for week ending February 4. half of the year the rise in the Treasury bill rate was limited by strong demand for bills on the part of nonbank investors, particularly nonfinancial corporations and State and local governments. The demand was intensified by maturities of nonmarketable savings notes and seasonal retirements of marketable tax anticipation securities. In the second half of the year bill rates increased BANK CREDIT AND MONEY sharply, however, despite continued nonbank demand, as reserve pressure continued and the Treasury increased its issues of bills and tax anticipation securities. During most of 1955 and early 1956 bill yields generally fluctuated somewhat below the Reserve Bank discount rates. An exception occurred around the year-end, when bill rates exceeded the discount rates for several weeks. The average yield on 90-day Treasury bills was 2.58 per cent in the week ending December 31 and 2.36 per cent in the third week of February, compared with 1.08 per cent at the end of 1954. The peak in 1953 had been 2.29 per cent and the low in 1954 was 0.61 per cent. Yields on intermediate-term Treasury bonds and notes also rose sharply in the first half of 1955 in response to pressure on bank reserve positions, but after midyear they rose less than yields on shorter term securities. Rates on other short-term open market paper, which had remained unchanged or declined slightly in the second half of 1954, followed the increase in yields on short-term Treasury securities closely during 1955. Rate increases totaled more than W2 percentage points on prime commercial paper and on privately placed finance company paper, and about XV\\ percentage points on bankers' acceptances. At the end of 1955 these rates were at new highs for recent years. Acceptance rates declined in January but commercial paper rates remained firm. Yields on long-term securities generally increased about VA percentage point during 1955. Late in 1954 yields on United States Government and State and local government 105 bonds had increased, while yields on corporate bonds had shown little change. After an increase in the first quarter of 1955, longterm yields were generally stable in the second quarter. They increased further after midyear, and, after declining in September and October, rose at the year-end to levels near or above their summer peaks. At these levels long-term yields were about equal to those prevailing in late 1953 and early 1954, but were generally about lA to V2 percentage point below their mid-1953 highs. They have declined in 1956, but have remained above June 1955 levels. During 1955 the spread between the yield on Treasury bills and that on long-term Government bonds declined from more than 1 Vi per cent to less than Vi per cent, the smallest differential in recent years. The more moderate increase in long-term rates reflected the minor role played by long-term securities in bank reserve adjustments, the modest extent of the increase in outstanding longterm securities during the year, and some tendency to meet long-term credit needs through short-term borrowing, as well as the willingness of individuals and miscellaneous investors to increase their purchases of long-term securities at only small increases in yields. Interest rates charged customers by commercial banks and other lenders also increased in 1955. The average rate charged by commercial banks on short-term business loans rose almost Vi per cent. Rates charged by lenders on conventional mortgages also increased and discounts deepened on Federally underwritten mortgages. LARGER TAX RECEIPTS resulting from economic expansion, together with restraint in Federal expenditures, are expected to balance the Federal Budget in the current and 1957 fiscal years. The new Budget estimates a $2.4 billion cash surplus for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1957. An equal cash surplus is now anticipated for the current fiscal year, in contrast with an actual $2.7 billion cash deficit for fiscal year 1955. A small margin of receipts over expenditures is also estimated in the administrative Budget for both 1956 and 1957, the first surpluses since 1951. To help achieve the narrow balance between expected Budget receipts and expenditures, the President recommended against a tax cut during this period of peacetime prosperity. Congressional action is requested to postpone for another year the rate reductions in the corporate income tax and in certain excises scheduled under existing legislation to become effective on April 1, 1956. For fiscal year 1956 the new Budget estimates of both receipts and expenditures are higher than earlier estimates, but a greater increase in receipts has converted the year-ago prospect of a deficit into the current expectation of a surplus. Federal expenditures in fiscal year 1956 are expected to show a slight reduction from 1955, with a drop in national security spending more than offsetting larger nondefense outlays. NOTE.—This article was prepared by William F. Hellmuth, Jr., under the supervision of Donald C. Miller, Chief of the Government Finance Section of the Board's Division of Research and Statistics. For the 1957 fiscal year, however, Federal spending for both defense and other purposes is budgeted to rise, reversing the downward movement which reduced annual expenditures by $10 billion between 1953 and 1956. If tax rates are unchanged, 1957 revenues are expected to rise slightly more than expenditures. The Federal Budget, despite its array of tables and complex accounting procedures, presents the only comprehensive summary of the financial aspects of the President's program. Defense, school construction, foreign aid, agriculture, veterans, and other activities, as well as taxes, are all presented as parts of a total program. Demands of the Administration's program on the resources—financial and real—of the nation are measured in monetary terms by the expenditures and appropriations requested in the Budget. The 1957 Budget indicates that Government expenditures, which rose from 15 per cent of gross national product in fiscal year 1950 to almost 21 per cent in 1953, will be about 16 per cent in 1956. The cash Budget—which shows the overall flow of money between the public and the Government—is probably the best single measure of the impact of Federal financial transactions on the nation's economy. It is also an indicator of the effect of Federal activities on the money market. However, neither the cash Budget alone nor any other single measure reveals fully the effects of Federal operations on the economy. The diverse types of expenditures and receipts do not all have the same impact on economic 106 107 THE 1957 BUDGET developments. The economic system also reacts to Government activities not fully or immediately reflected in the cash Budget, such as large changes—actual or anticipated —in appropriations and Government orders, new tax measures, credit insurance and guaranties, credit and monetary policies, and management of the national debt. The cash surplus or deficit indicates the net impact of the Budget on the economy. A large excess of Federal receipts over payments to the public indicates a contractive tendency of Governmental activities in the economy. A substantial cash deficit, on the other hand, signals a net expansive influence. The ultimate economic effects of Governmental activities depend to a considerable extent upon how surpluses or deficits affect the credit system and upon accompanying monetary and credit policies. The cash Budget, shown in Table 1, reTABLE 1 CASH BUDGET [In billions of dollars] Fiscal year ending June 30— Item 19571 19561 1955 1953 1950 67.8 60.4 9.5 71.5 64.8 .8.9 40.9 36.5 6.7 Receipts from the public, total.. 75.4 Budget receipts 66.3 Trust fund receipts 11.9 Less: Intragovernmental transactions and seigniorage 2 2.8 73.5 64.5 11.6 2.6 2.1 2.2 2.2 Payments to the public, total 72.9 Budget expenditures 65.9 Trust fund expenditures 10.2 Less: Intragovernmental transactions 2.8 Net accrued interest and other transactions 3 .... .3 71.0 64.3 9.6 70.5 64.6 8.5 76.8 74.3 5.3 43.2 39.6 6.9 2.6 2.1 2.2 2.2 .2 .5 .6 1.1 2.4 - 2 . 7 .2 - 4 . 2 -5.3 -9.4 -2.2 Cash surplus, or deficit (—)....

Thus a balanced conventional Budget and a moderate cash surplus expected in fiscal year 1956 and again in 1957, if realized, will tend to be a mildly restraining influence on total monetary demand. The shift from a $2.7 billion cash deficit in the 1955 fiscal year to a $2.4 billion cash surplus this year has been a small contractive factor contributing to economic stability during a period of large and rapid growth in output and business and personal incomes. BUDGET RECEIPTS The most impressive change in the 1957 Budget is the upward revision of the revenue estimates as a result of the unexpectedly large increase in economic activity and income over the past year. Budget receipts for fiscal year 1956, which were officially estimated at $60.0 billion in January 1955 and at $62.1 billion in August 1955, are now expected to reach $64.5 billion, as shown in Table 2. The economic expansion has enlarged the tax base and, with no change in tax rates, the larger base has boosted current estimates of fiscal year 1956 collections of individual income taxes by $1.1 billion and of corporate income taxes by $3.3 billion over year-ago estimates. For the 1957 fiscal year, receipts are projected at an all-time high of $66.3 billion, $1.8 billion above the estimate for 1956 and above the previous 1953 record when income tax rates were higher. Practically all of the increase results from larger personal income tax collections. This assumes that personal income during the 1956 calendar year will be $312.5 billion, slightly above the rate for the fourth quarter of 1955 and 3 per cent above the 1955 total. 108 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • FEBRUARY 1956 APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES TABLE 2 BUDGET RECEIPTS [In billions of dollars] Fiscal year ending June 30— Source 19571 19561 Budget receipts, total Individual income taxes Corporation income and excess profits taxes Excise taxes .

NOTE.—Details may not add to totals because of rounding. Corporate tax collections in fiscal year 1957 are projected as unchanged from the current year, assuming corporate profits in calendar year 1956 equal to last year. The rise in profits from $34.0 billion in 1954 to an estimated $43.0 billion in 1955 is causing corporate tax collections to rise by an estimated $2.0 billion in the current fiscal year. This increase is occurring despite revenue losses from expiration of the excess profit tax, the 1954 tax revisions, and completion of the acceleration of corporate tax payments under the 1950 Mills plan, all of which reduce fiscal year 1956 corporate receipts below those of preceding years. The individual income tax continues as the major source of Budget receipts. After refunds, it is expected to account for 48 per cent of 1957 fiscal year receipts, a record high slightly above recent years and comparable with about 43 per cent in the years just before the Korean conflict. The corporate income tax accounts for about 31 per cent, slightly above the 1949 and 1950 percentages but below the 1953 ratio, when the excess profits tax was in effect. Excise taxes have become relatively less important. Expenditures for Federal activities lag by varying time periods after obligations for them are incurred. For salaries, travel, and similar items, the lag between obligations and expenditures is very short, and over an entire fiscal year obligations and expenditures are approximately equal. For items requiring long periods of planning and production, such as aircraft, ships, highways, and some research projects, however, the time lag between the Government decision to undertake a project, the placing of the order, and completion of the project may be several years. Because of these long-lead times, Congressional authorizations to incur certain types of obligations are made well in advance of the year of expenditure. Accordingly, the trend of new obligational authority and the balances of appropriations carried forward at the end of a fiscal year give an indication of future levels of expenditures, especially for construction and specialized durable goods. The Budget requests new obligational auFEDERAL EXPENDITURES AND AUTHORIZATIONS Billions of dollars 100 1950 1952 1954 1956 NOTE.—Figures are for fiscal years ending June 30. for 1956 and 1957 are estimates. Those THE 1957 BUDGET thority of $66.3 billion for fiscal year 1957, slightly larger than estimated expenditures for the year. This new authority to spend is higher than comparable 1955 and 1956 figures, presented in Table 3. The backlog of unexpended balances, however, will be reduced somewhat by the end of fiscal year 1957 as some appropriations enacted in earlier years will be allowed to lapse. Most of these unexpended balances are for major national security programs. Almost twothirds of estimated 1957 expenditures will be out of new 1957 obligational authority; the rest will be charged to unexpended balances of earlier appropriations. The President's legislative proposals outlined in his State of the Union Message account for $8.5 billion of the new obligational authority and $2.0 billion of estimated expenditures for the 1957 fiscal year. These proposals include both new legislation and extension of existing legislation. MAJOR NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAMS Expenditures for major national security programs are budgeted at $40.4 billion for fiscal year 1957, a rise of $900 million over the current year but still far below the 1953 level. New obligational authority requested is above the 1956 total and approximates the expected level of 1957 spending. Department of Defense. Revisions in military requirements over the last three years result from the changing character of the threat to our security, the end of the Korean War, and the availability of new weapons. Current planning continues to emphasize probable requirements in terms of current defense needs sustainable over a long period of uncertain peace rather than for a specific date of maximum danger. The President also stressed other major policies and concepts underlying our national security pro- 109 grams: the capability to deter a potential aggressor by a combination of immediate retaliatory power and an increasingly effective system of continental defense; and the development of military forces which minimize numbers of men, by means of more effective utilization of personnel and maximum use of new weapons and technology. Expenditures for military functions of the Defense Department, which declined $9 billion from the Korean high during fiscal year 1953 to the current year, are expected to increase almost $1 billion in 1957. These additional costs are due largely to the higher expenditures for maintenance and operation of more air bases and radar sites and of the larger numbers of more complex weapons and equipment. Most other major categories of costs for the Department of Defense will be about unchanged in 1957 from 1956. Personnel costs will remain at about $11 billion a year, with military personnel on active duty approximately stable at about 2.8 million. Major procurement and production expenditures of $11.7 billion for 1957, though down $1.3 billion from 1955 fiscal year, are little changed from the current year. Most interesting perhaps is a shift within the 1957 total to increased spending for guided missiles, to double the 1955 amount. Offsetting reductions occur in procurement expenditures for aircraft, vehicles, and conventional weapons and ammunition. Expenditures for aircraft, at $6.8 billion, though down slightly from 1956, still account for almost three-fifths of all military procurement and more than one-tenth of the total Budget. Expenditures of $1.4 billion for research and development emphasize projects dealing with missiles, continental air defense, and nuclear propulsion for aircraft and ships. Expenditures for reserve components are in- 110 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • FEBRUARY 1956 creased somewhat in the 1957 fiscal year. The relative distribution of Defense Department expenditures among the three services will continue about the same as in the current fiscal year, with the Air Force receiving almost half of the total, the Navy slightly more than a quarter, and the Army about a quarter. The recent distribution reflects the new defense emphasis, technological developments, and procurement needs of the different services. Atomic energy. Expenditures for the development and control of atomic energy in 1957 are estimated at more than $1.9 billion, above the previous high in 1954. Rising outlays for the acquisition and processing of nuclear materials account for the major part of all expenditures. Spending for reactor development—both military and civilian—shows the most rapid rate of in- crease, with the 1957 estimate twice the actual total for 1955. Stockpiling and defense production expan- sion. The current high level of industrial activity—which limits availability of some materials—and the attainment of an increasing number of stockpile objectives have combined to reduce further the estimated net expenditures for this program. Net spending is estimated to decline to less than $400 million in 1957, compared with a high of more than $1.0 billion in 1954, and no new obligational authority is requested for 1957. National stockpile inventories of strategic and critical materials are expected to rise to $6.4 billion on June 30, 1957, toward an ultimate objective of $10.3 billion. Mutual security, military. The Mutual Security Program is a long-range program of military, economic, and technical assistance TABLE 3 BUDGET EXPENDITURES, AUTHORIZATIONS, AND UNEXPENDED BALANCES [In billions of dollars] Fiscal year ending June 30— Item or function 19571 19561 1955 1954 1953 1952 1951 1950 1949 1948 BUDGET EXPENDITURES Total. 65.9 64.3 64.6 67.8 74.3 65.4 44.1 39.6 39.5 33.1 Major national security expenditures,total Defense department, military Atomic energy Stockpiling and defense production expansion 2 Mutual security, military 40.4 35.5 1.9 .4 2.5 39.5 34.6 1.7 .7 2.5 40.6 35.5 1.9 .9 2.3 46.9 40.3 1.9 1.0 3.6 50.4 43.6 1.8 1.0 4.0 44.0 38.9 1.7 1.0 2.4 22.4 19.8 .9 .8 1.0 13.0 11.9 .6 .4 .1 12.9 11.6 .6 .3 .4 11.8 10.9 .5 Expenditures other than major national security, total.

The entire Mutual Security Program for fiscal year 1957 involves requested new obligational authority of $4.9 billion and estimated expenditures of $4.3 billion. Expenditures at this rate would represent little change from 1955 and 1956. However, a backlog of unexpended balances is considered to be necessary to permit orders for future delivery of long-lead-time items. New obligational authority $2.2 billion in excess of that for the current year is recommended in order to maintain future assistance under these programs at the current rate. Of the total amounts for the Mutual Security programs, $2.5 billion of expenditures and $3.0 billion of new obligational authority are for military assistance and are included under major national security. The nonmilitary portion of the program is included under international affairs and finance. The expenditures for military assistance provide military equipment, training, and direct forces support—such as petroleum, uniforms, and military construction. United States' assistance supplements the major efforts of the other free nations to the extent that the combined security of the free world requires military forces beyond the capacity of the other countries. About half of the 1957 program will benefit Korea, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Turkey. NONDEFENSE PROGRAMS Budget estimates for the 1957 fiscal year continue the recent upward trend of expenditures for programs other than major national security, as shown in Table 3. Anticipated spending of $25.5 billion during 1957 for these programs will be $700 million above the current year, $1.6 billion above 1955, and at the highest level since 1950. Spend- ing for these programs, which had accounted for 67 per cent of all Budget expenditures in fiscal year 1950, reached a low of 31 per cent in 1954 and is estimated to rise to 39 per cent of 1956 and 1957 spending. International affairs and finance. Recom- mended expenditures for these activities remain near recent levels. The economic and technical development program calls for net expenditures of $1.8 billion for 1957. The President recommended slightly increased spending for world-wide programs to help solve health, education, and economic problems on a cooperative basis with the less developed countries. In order to assure greater continuity in economic assistance for projects requiring years for planning and completion, the President asked for limited authority to make longer term commitments to be met from future appropriations. Foreign information and exchange activities will expand, supported by a strong Presidential recommendation for a $48 million increase in new obligational authority. Activities to stimulate trade and investment include investment guaranties, direct loans, and guaranties of private loans. Although the Export-Import Bank is expected to expand its commitments under this program, $100 million of net receipts is anticipated in 1957 as a result of increasing use of guaranties of private loans—instead of direct loans by the Bank—and of repayment and sale of outstanding loans. Veterans services and benefits. Estimates of veterans expenditures continue the recent upward trend, though the 1957 figure is still below the 1947 peak. Compensation and pensions to veterans and their dependents are estimated at $2.9 billion in 1957, with about 2.8 million veterans and the survivors of more than 850,000 deceased veterans receiving these payments. Under existing 112 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • FEBRUARY 1956 legislation these direct payments to veterans are expected to increase steadily to perhaps double their present yearly total by the end of this century. Readjustment benefits for education, training, loan guaranties, and unemployment compensation are anticipated to cost $900 million in 1957, almost all for Korean veterans. The Veterans Administration expects that 640,000 new loans totaling more than $7 billion will be guaranteed during the next fiscal year. With the expiration dates approaching on the \"GI Bill\" as it applies to World War II veterans, 7.8 million have received education and 4.5 million have bought homes. Medical care, a third important program for veterans, is allocated $800 million in fiscal year 1957. Labor and welfare. Education, including school construction, is the labor and welfare program with the largest dollar increase for 1957 over 1956. The President, in a special message on January 12, proposed a fiveyear program including Federal grants at an annual rate of $250 million matched with State funds to aid construction in the neediest school districts. Federal purchases of school construction bonds up to $750 million are recommended when such issues cannot be sold in the capital markets at reasonable interest rates. The Budget requests almost $400 million of obligational authority for school construction in 1957 and estimates expenditures at $150 million. Other educational programs are continued at an annual cost of about $250 million. Substantial increases are also forecast in 1957 for public health activities. Expenditures for all labor and welfare activities are budgeted at $3.0 billion for 1957, extending the growth that has been uninterrupted for more than 10 years. Re- quested new obligational authority of $3.4 billion suggests that these expenditures will continue to rise beyond 1957. Four-fifths of this total is for grants to State and local governments for programs they administer. Public assistance, the largest single program, is little changed from recent years, with 1957 expenditures of $1.5 billion for grants to the States for old-age assistance and aid to dependent children, the blind, and the totally disabled. Old-Age and Survivors Insurance—financed through a trust fund outside the regular Budget—now provides an additional $5 billion of benefits a year to more than 6 million persons over 65 years of age and 1.5 million mothers and children. OASI now covers more than nine-tenths of all employed persons, and legislation to cover groups still excluded is recommended. The 1957 appropriation request for the Bureau of the Census, which comes under this general classification, includes about $3 million for a national housing inventory to measure significant changes in the nation's housing supply since 1950 and for a census of comprehensive financial information for the more than 100,000 State and local governments for the first time since 1942. Agriculture and agricultural resources. The Budget includes $400 million of estimated expenditures and $450 million of new obligational authority for the 1957 fiscal year to provide for the new program recommended in the President's special message on agriculture. Most of the funds will go for the soil-bank part of the program, which provides both an acreage reserve— withdrawing from current production land eligible to produce price-supported crops— and a conservation reserve of other land to be planted in grasses or woodland. The Budget also increases tax refunds $60 million to carry out the recommendation that THE 1957 BUDGET farmers be refunded Federal taxes on gasoline used in farm operations off the highways. The estimated cost of these new programs is about equal to the decline anticipated in net expenditures for price supports. Net expenditures for agricultural programs are estimated at $3.4 billion for fiscal year 1957, unchanged from the current year but down $1.0 billion from the record 1955 high. Net expenditures are gross expenditures less applicable receipts, both of which are large and variable in the case of agricultural programs. Net expenditures do not reveal the fact that increasing amounts are expected from loan repayments and from commodity sales; these receipts offset the roughly $9 billion of gross expenditures. Sixty per cent of 1957 gross expenditures for agriculture are expected to go for programs to stabilize farm prices and incomes, principally the price support operations of the Commodity Credit Corporation. Net expenditures of the CCC are estimated at $1.4 billion for 1957, against $2.0 billion in 1956 and the record high of $3.4 billion in 1955. Expenditure estimates for this program are very uncertain, depending necessarily on world-wide economic and political conditions, weather and insects, and farmers' decisions as to planting and intensity of cultivation. The Budget Message notes that the chief beneficiaries of the price support program are the large, highly mechanized farms. In the case of wheat loans, for example, three-fourths of the dollar amounts go to one-third of the borrowers. The Budget estimates assume continuation of some private financing of price support operations. By issuing to banks and other private investors certificates of interest against commodity loans, the CCC obtains funds without recourse to the Treasury and in this way avoids a Budget expendi- 113 ture until the certificates are redeemed. These are not included in the Federal debt subject to the statutory ceiling. If the issuance of certificates contemplated in the 1956 Budget estimates does not take place, net expenditures for agriculture may be $800 million higher than budgeted. Outlays greater than receipts on pricesupported commodities have increased the CCC investment in loans and inventories. CCC investment in supported commodities rose from $3.7 billion on June 30, 1954, to $5.0 billion a year later and is expected to total $6.5 billion at the end of fiscal year 1957. The actual CCC investment on December 31, 1955, was $8.7 billion, over three-fourths of which was in wheat, cotton, and corn. Efforts to find markets at home and abroad for our agricultural surpluses are being increased. Rural electrification and telephones, farm credit, soil and water conservation, and research and other agricultural services are the other four agricultural programs. Each will require expenditures of $200 million in 1957, with spending unchanged to slightly higher compared with 1955 and 1956. Natural resources. Actual and estimated gross expenditures for resource development are very steady at $1.3 billion a year, partly offset by slowly rising receipts. In addition to $270 million of estimated receipts—largely from sale of power by the Tennessee Valley Authority—which are applied against gross expenditures, an additional $500 million obtained from sale of power and from timber and mineral leases on public lands is included in miscellaneous Budget receipts. Water resources development through flood control, reclamation, and multiple purpose projects is responsible for most of the expenditures. New TVA power facilities are expected to be financed largely by reve- 114 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • FEBRUARY 1956 nue bonds, to be authorized by legislation now before the Congress. While most 1957 spending will be for construction on hundreds of water resource projects already under way and for maintenance and operation of existing facilities, small sums totaling $40 million will be used as first payments to start several dozen new projects for which total costs will exceed $1 billion. Small increases in spending are expected for development of forest, mineral, and fish and wildlife resources and for recreation. Commerce and housing. Despite recommendations for increased outlays to inaugurate new programs and to improve road, air, and water transportation facilities, net expenditures are budgeted to decline by $100 million in fiscal year 1957 from 1956 as a result of an estimated $350 million from the proposed increase in postal rates. Receipts chiefly from the Post Office and housing programs will offset the greater part of the expected $6.3 billion of gross expenditures. Spending for highways in 1957 under existing legislation will increase to a new high of more than $800 million, slightly more than in the current year. The Budget makes no provision for the new interstate highway system, but recommends that \"the expanded program be soundly financed so as not to create budget deficits.\" Subsequent to the Budget Message, the President and the Congress appear to have reached general agreement that additional taxes be levied on highway users to finance the new program. The Budget also provides for new measures to aid local areas with persistent unemployment and to initiate an experimental disaster insurance program. Increased appropriations are requested to strengthen every major program for the regulation of commerce and finance. Government activity in the housing field aims to assure continued high levels of residential construction primarily by encouraging private financing through Federal guaranties and insurance. Gross expenditures for housing and community development will remain near $1.4 billion per year. Wide variations in loan repayments and in private refinancing of Government-held mortgages, however, result in Budget figures that vary from $500 million of net repayments in fiscal year 1954 to net expenditures of $200 million in 1955. In both 1956 and 1957 expected receipts almost exactly offset estimated gross expenditures. Small increases in fiscal year 1957 are anticipated for public housing, community development, and college housing programs, but larger net receipts under the management and liquidation functions of Federal National Mortgage Association are expected to hold net expenditures about unchanged from 1956. New credit aids for housing and related programs, primarily loans and guaranties by the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration, are expected to total $15.8 billion, including the unguaranteed portion of veterans loans. This total is 75 per cent of estimated total new commitments of the major Federal credit programs. About 1.4 million mortgage loans on new and existing dwelling units are expected under Federal credit programs during the 1957 fiscal year, a sharp rise over the current level. An equal number of home improvement loans insured by the FHA is anticipated, under additional authority requested to strengthen this program. General government. Due to increased payments to the retirement fund for civilian employees and to anticipated construction of several new legislative and executive office buildings, expenditures for general government will increase somewhat in 1957. 115 THE 1957 BUDGET Interest. Interest payments are expected to increase to $7.1 billion in the new fiscal year, up $200 million over the current year and $600 million over 1955. The higher charges result principally from a rise during calendar year 1955 in the average interest rate on the outstanding Federal debt from 2.29 to 2.49 per cent. DEBT REDUCTION Some net cash repayment of debt and a small reduction in the outstanding national debt is expected in each of the fiscal years 1956 and 1957. The surplus or deficit in the cash Budget combined with changes in the Treasury cash balance determines the amount of cash repayment to, or borrowing from, the public. The surplus or deficit in the administrative Budget adjusted for variations in the Treasury balance controls the net change in the gross outstanding debt. In the current fiscal year the estimated cash surplus of $2.4 billion plus a small reduction in the Treasury cash balance is expected to allow cash repayment of $2.6 billion of debt, as shown in Table 4. This repayment of debt held by investors other than Federal agencies and trust funds contrasts with net cash borrowing of $ 1.8 billion during the 1955 fiscal year and of larger amounts during the two preceding years. Because of the heavy seasonal concentration of tax receipts in the January-June half year, all of the net cash repayment of debt takes place in this period. The seasonal fluctuation in revenues necessitated actual net cash borrowing of $5.3 billion from July through December 1955 and—to meet Budget estimates for the fiscal year—will permit $8.0 billion of cash repayment of debt in the current half of fiscal year 1956. The cash surplus anticipated for fiscal year 1957 will provide the means for cash TABLE 4 THE FEDERAL DEBT: BORROWING, AND OWNERSHIP REPAYMENT, [In billions of dollars] Fiscal year ending June 30— 1956 19571 JulyFull Jan.June Dec. year 1 19561 1955 Net cash surplus ( —), or deficit. - 2 . 4 - 2 . 4 - 9 . 5 7.0 - . 2 + 1.5 - 1 . 7 Change in cash balance Net cash repayment (—), or borrowing 2 5.3 - 2 . 5 - 2 . 6 -8.0 Plus: Noncash borrowing3 1.7 2.5 1.7 3.4 Less: Issuance of Federal agency debt to public .5 .6 .2 Net change in outstanding debt.

The balanced budgets for 1956 and 1957 will accommodate the June 30 debt level each year to the permanent debt ceiling. The seasonal variation in receipts and resulting July-December deficit, however, will repeat itself again in the 1957 fiscal year. To permit the Treasury to meet its heavy temporary borrowing needs during the period of low receipts, continuation of a temporarily higher debt limit is requested for 1957. The outstanding debt is affected by net cash repayment (or borrowing), by noncash debt transactions, and by direct borrowing by a few Federal credit agencies. The accrual of interest on savings bonds and the investment of trust fund net accruals in Treasury securities account mainly for this 116 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • FEBRUARY 1956 noncash borrowing. The noncash borrowing makes the decrease in outstanding debt smaller (or increase larger) than the amount of net cash repayment (or borrowing). The declines in the outstanding debt expected in 1956 and 1957 are the first reductions since fiscal year 1951. Over the last half of the current fiscal year and over fiscal year 1957, the national debt will be reduced $7.0 billion from its December 31, 1955 total of $280.8' billion (including $500 million not subject to the debt ceiling). Over the same eighteen-month period, Government security holdings of Government agencies and trust funds are expected to increase $3.9 billion, which will mean that total Federal debt held by the public will be reduced $10.8 billion. The Federal Government is a major and interdependent sector of the nation's economy. The new Budget illustrates the extent to which an expanding economy affects Federal financial operations, especially receipts. The Budget also suggests the impact of Federal transactions on the economy. If economic growth and at least the present uncertain peace continue, and if severe short-run setbacks are avoided, the expansion of tax receipts automatically accompanying growth of incomes and output will offer a choice of tax reduction, more Governmental services, debt retirement, or a combination of these. A shift from a cash deficit to a cash surplus, if realized, will be a mild contractive influence in the economy, but, to the extent that such a surplus results from expansion in national product and income, it might be considered as a stabilizing factor. In the case of a cash surplus, the Government would no longer be a net borrower of funds. In his Message, the President spelled out the three broad national objectives that his Budget policies are designed to achieve. Attainment of a just and durable peace is the first. In the absence of tangible evidence of agreement by the Soviet leaders on a disarmament plan providing adequate inspection, the President stated, we must continue to strengthen the defense of the United States and our allies. The Administration's policies also aim at greater economic well-being for all the free world through cooperative effort. Expenditures to deter aggression and to promote our international alliances again require the largest portion, 64 per cent, of the 1957 Budget. Spending for this purpose, estimated at $42.4 billion for 1957, is $1.0 billion above the 1956 figure and almost equal to actual spending last year. The Administration's second objective is to sustain our unprecedented domestic prosperity and to encourage conditions in which this prosperity can be more fully shared by agriculture and certain sectors of our industrial economy. Many activities which are desirable for meeting the needs of an expanding population and a complex society \"for years . . . have been postponed because of the overriding needs of war and defense.\" Rising revenues now permit some new and expanded programs for economic growth and well-being. Nondefense domestic expenditures in fiscal year 1957 are estimated to increase by $700 million over 1956 and by larger amounts over recent years. Financial stability, the third goal, will be strengthened by the attainment of a balanced budget in the current situation. The President's Message gives priority to a balanced budget and some modest reduction of our national debt ahead of a tax cut under conditions of high peacetime prosperity. Law Department Administrative interpretations, new regulations, and similar material REGULATION U INTERPRETATION EFFECT OF REGISTRATION OF STOCK SUBSEQUENT TO MAKING OF LOAN The Board recently was asked whether a loan by a bank to enable the borrower to purchase a newly issued stock during the initial over-thecounter trading period prior to the stock becoming registered (listed) on a national securities exchange would be subject to the Board's Regulation U. The Board replied that, until such stock is so registered, the regulation would not be applicable to such a loan. The Board now has been asked what the position of the lending bank would be under the regulation if, after the date on which the stock should become registered, such bank continued to hold a loan of the kind just described. It is assumed that the loan was in an amount greater than the maximum loan value for the collateral specified in the regulation. If the stock should become registered, the loan would then be for the purpose of purchasing or carrying a registered stock, and, if secured directly or indirectly by any stock, would be subject to the regulation as from the date the stock was registered. Under the present regulation, this does not mean that the bank would have to obtain reduction of the loan in order to reduce it to an amount no more than the specified maximum loan value. It does mean, however, that so long as the loan balance exceeded the specified maximum loan value, the bank could not permit any withdrawals or substitutions of collateral that would increase such excess; nor could the bank increase the amount of the loan balance unless there was provided additional collateral having a maximum loan value at least equal to the amount of the increase. In other words, as from the date the stock should become registered, the loan would be subject to the regulation in exactly the same way, for example, as a loan subject to the regulation that became under-margined because of a decline in the current market value of the loan collateral or because of a decrease by the Board in the maximum loan value of the loan collateral. 117 Current Events and Announcements REAPPOINTMENT OF MR.

The original term of office was 10 years, and the five original appointive members had terms of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years, respectively. In 1922 the number of appointive members was increased to six, and in 1933 the term of office was increased to 12 years. The Banking Act of 1935, approved Aug. 23, 1935, changed the name of the Federal Reserve Board to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and provided that the Board should be com- posed of seven appointive members; that the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency should continue to serve as members until February 1, 1936; that the appointive members in office on the date of that Act should continue to serve until February 1, 1936, or until their successors were appointed and had qualified and that thereafter the terms of members should be 14 years and that the designation of Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board should be for a term of four years. 2 Prior to Aug. 23, 1935, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board were known as Governor and Vice Governor, respectively. National Summary of Business Conditions Released for publication February 14 Industrial production, nonagricultural employment, and retail sales in January continued at the record year-end rates, after allowance for seasonal changes. Construction activity declined slightly further. Wholesale prices of industrial commodities edged up further in January and early February and average prices of farm products showed some recovery. Bank credit and deposits declined seasonally. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION The Board's preliminary seasonally adjusted index of industrial production in January remained at the record rate of 144 per cent of the 1947-49 average reached in December. Output of durable goods other than autos was generally maintained, and production of nondurable goods and minerals continued at peak rates. Auto assemblies were curtailed further and in late January and early February were running at a rate of about 140,000 cars per week. Production of major household durable goods was generally maintained in January—at a level about 5 per cent above a year ago. Output of building materials continued at high levels, and activity in producers' equipment lines showed further gains, with truck production up considerably. Steel pro- duction in January and early February reached a record tonnage level and was 99 per cent of 1956 rated capacity. Production of textiles, apparel, and leather products in January apparently remained close to earlier advanced levels, while activity in the chemical, petroleum, and paper industries edged up to new highs. Output of paperboard and petroleum and products in early February continued at advanced levels. CONSTRUCTION The number of private housing units started in January was close to the December seasonally adjusted annual rate of slightly less than 1.2 million. Total value of contract awards continued at an unusually high level for this season and for the three months ending in January was about onesixth above the corresponding period a year earlier. Outlays for new construction, seasonally adjusted, were down slightly further to an annual rate of $41.5 billion.

Average factory hourly earnings continued at the peak level of $1.93; but, owing to widespread reductions in hours of work, weekly pay at factories declined by $1.35 to $78.36, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier. Unemployment increased by 450,000, about the usual rise for this time of year, to 2.9 million. DISTRIBUTION Seasonally adjusted sales at department stores in January and early February were moderately above the advanced level of the preceding three months. With sales at some other outlets also showing increases, seasonally adjusted total retail sales in January were little changed from December, at a rate 6 per cent above a year ago. Dealer sales of new autos declined and were moderately below the record January level of last year and dealer stocks rose further to a new high. COMMODITY PRICES Average prices of industrial commodities edged up slightly further from mid-January to midFebruary.

BANK CREDIT AND RESERVES Total loans and investments at city banks declined between early January and early February. Holdings of U. S. Government securities were reduced by more than $1 billion and loans by more than %Vi billion, reflecting largely reductions in business and security loans. Loan repayments by sales finance companies accounted for a substantial part of the decline in business loans. Loans to businesses with special seasonal needs also declined, while new borrowing by metals manufacturers and other nonseasonal borrowers increased further. In late January and early February, average member bank borrowings from the Federal Reserve increased to almost $900 million and average excess reserves declined to about $500 million. More reserves were absorbed, largely through reductions in System holdings of U. S. Government securities and declines in Reserve Bank float, than were provided, principally through currency inflows and declines in required reserves. SECURITY MARKETS 400 0 vanced levels reached around the turn of the year, but increases were reported for steel and brass mill products, lumber, cotton goods, and petroleum and products. Average prices of farm products also rose and in mid-February were 3 per cent above the mid-December low, reflecting mainly increased prices of hogs and pork accompanying a seasonal decline in marketings. In early February a reduction of 11 per cent in the Federal support level for the 1956 corn crop was announced. Support prices for other feed grains were changed little and those for oilseeds were raised about 5 per cent. A 13 per cent reduction in the support price for wheat had been announced earlier. - 0 800 123 Notwithstanding continued pressure on bank reserves, yields on U. S. Government securities declined generally between mid-January and midFebruary. The largest decline was in the Treasury bill yield. Reflecting steady nonbank demand for bills, the bill yield recently has fluctuated somewhat below the Federal Reserve discount rate. Intermediate-term and long-term yields on Government and other securities were also lower.
