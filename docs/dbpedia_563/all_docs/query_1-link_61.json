        "text": "Harrison Ford was born on July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois, to Dorothy (Nidelman), a radio actress, and Christopher Ford (born John William Ford), an actor turned advertising executive. His father was of Irish and German ancestry, while his maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Minsk, Belarus. Harrison was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (Der Chef (1967), Die Leute von der Shiloh Ranch (1962)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in American Graffiti (1973). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes (1981).\n\nFour years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in Der einzige Zeuge (1985). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in Die Stunde der Patrioten (1992). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in Auf der Flucht (1993). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nFord is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope.\n\nOn March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had suffered engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.\n\nLiam Neeson was born on June 7, 1952 in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, to Katherine (Brown), a cook, and Bernard Neeson, a school caretaker. He was raised in a Catholic household. During his early years, Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, a truck driver, an assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary's Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play \"The Risen People\". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin's Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Excalibur (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role.\n\nThrough the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including Die Bounty (1984), Des Lebens bittere Süße (1984), Die Mission (1986), and Duet for One (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Suspect - Unter Verdacht (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in Der Preis der Gefühle (1988) and High Spirits - Die Geister sind willig! (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in Unter Verdacht (1991) and Ethan Frome (1992), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen's Ehemänner und Ehefrauen (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Schindlers Liste (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor.\n\nAlso in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in \"Anna Christie\", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood's top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode I - Die dunkle Bedrohung (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey - Die Wahrheit über Sex (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in Die Chroniken von Narnia - Der König von Narnia (2005).\n\nNeeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of 96 Hours (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when his wife Natasha Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Kampf der Titanen (2010) and Das A-Team - Der Film (2010), and returned to the action genre with Unknown Identity (2011), The Grey - Unter Wölfen (2011), Battleship (2012) and 96 Hours - Taken 2 (2012), as well as the sequel Zorn der Titanen (2012).\n\nNeeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1999 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996).\n\nActress Josie Davis stars in director Drew Water's hilarious Christmas comedy, Festival of Trees, out this holiday season.Also set to release this year is her role as evil government astrophysicist, Dr Barboux, opposite James Remar, in the comedy Glowzies in which she and Remar were nominated at the Houston Film Festival. The movie premiered at the respected Sitges Film Festival, in Spain. She also has a watchable podcast on You Tube and can be heard on Apple, Spotify etc but you can watch clips from it on her Instagram page - @JosieDavis. Updates for her career are also found there.\n\nA Hollywood, California native, Josie Davis began her career at the age of three years old. She starred in numerous television commercials, and as just a child, she was cast as a series regular, on the hit television show, Charles In Charge, rated number-one in syndication. Josie received three nominations for her performance on the series and also won the respected Youth In Film Award for her role as the adorable, shy and bookish, Sarah Powell.\n\nJosie was the youngest student to study with respected acting teacher from Brooklyn, Paul E Richards, for twenty years until his passing. He had been referred to as Lee Strasberg's \"right hand man.\"\n\nAt the age of twenty four, Davis auditioned in front of Hollywood heavyweights, Martin Landau, Mark Rydell, Shelley Winters, and Barbara Bain. After only one audition Davis was accepted into the legendary Actors Studio as a \"Member with working privileges\", then was made a Lifetime Member after only one callback. Over one thousand actors auditioned, making Davis only one of two actors to be accepted that year.\n\nAfter wanting to focus on film, Academy Award winning director Mark Rydell told Josie even though she wanted to be thought of as a film actor she should be proud to be a new series regular on the last season of the iconic television series, Beverly Hills 90210. After the series ended, legendary Aaron Spelling cast Josie again as a series regular on his next show for NBC called, Titans, until it's final run.\n\nJosie 's additional series credits include: a recurring role on CSI: NY with Gary Sinese, the fan favorite Christmas episode of Two and a Half Men that USA Today called \"A must see\". Comedy King, Chuck Lorre and the ex President of Warner Brothers, Peter Roth, told Davis she should've been nominated for an emmy as Sandy, the multiple personality cook. Lorre said, \"I couldn't imagine anyone else playing that part\". Davis' other television credits include: CSI: Miami, Hawaii Five-O, NCIS, Rules of Engagment with David Spade, The Mentalist, and the list goes on and on. Josie was cast opposite Ed O'Neil and Jennifer Love Hewitt in the television comedy, In the Game, playing a diva sports reporter which guest starred Tom Brady, for ABC.\n\nIn 2011, Martin Landau and Mark Rydell cast Josie in the stage production out of The Actors Studio - David Mamet's Speed the Plow where her performance extremely well-received.\n\nJosie took a break from television to focus on films. First up was Wizardream, playing the British Evil Queen, opposite Malcolm Mc Dowell. Nicolas Cage cast Josie in his directorial debut, Sonny, opposite James Franco with the late Harry Dean Stanton. Josie has played the lead in numerous independent films as well as Lifetime movies, which earned her Lifetime Movie Network's Lifetime Achievement award as well as one for her lead role in Backstabbed, both voted entirely by Lifetime fans.\n\nJosie is writing her Memoir, which will take years to complete. She is involved in a variety of animal charities, but has especially loved her anonymous volunteer work at the South Los Angeles Animal Shelter where she adopted her two cats\n\nSydney Pollack was an Academy Award-winning director, producer, actor, writer and public figure, who directed and produced over 40 films.\n\nSydney Irwin Pollack was born July 1, 1934 in Lafayette, Indiana, USA, to Rebecca (Miller), a homemaker, and David Pollack, a professional boxer turned pharmacist. All of his grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. His parents divorced when he was young. His mother, an alcoholic, died at age 37, when Sydney was 16. He spent his formative years in Indiana, graduating from his HS in 1952, then moved to New York City.\n\nFrom 1952-1954 young Pollack studied acting with Sanford Meisner at The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York. He served two years in the army, and then returned to the Neighborhood Playhouse and taught acting. In 1958, Pollack married his former student Claire Griswold. They had three children. Their son, Steven Pollack, died in a plane crash on November 26, 1993, in Santa Monica, California. Their daughter, Rebecca Pollack, served as vice president of film production at United Artists during the 1990s. Their youngest daughter, Rachel Pollack, was born in 1969.\n\nPollack began his acting career on stage, then made his name as television director in the early 1960s. He made his big screen acting debut in Hinter feindlichen Linien (1962), where he met fellow actor Robert Redford, and the two co-stars established a life-long friendship. Pollack called on his good friend Redford to play opposite Natalie Wood in Dieses Mädchen ist für alle (1966). Pollack and Redford worked together on six more films over the years. His biggest success came with Jenseits von Afrika (1985), starring Robert Redford and Meryl Streep. The movie earned eleven Academy Award nominations in all and seven wins, including Pollack's two Oscars: one for Best Direction and one for Best Picture.\n\nPollack showed his best as a comedy director and actor in Tootsie (1982), where he brought feminist issues to public awareness using his remarkable wit and wisdom, and created a highly entertaining film, which was nominated for ten Academy Awards. Pollack's directing revealed Dustin Hoffman's range and nuanced acting in gender switching from a dominant boyfriend to a nurse in drag, a brilliant collaboration of director and actor that broadened public perception about sex roles. Pollack also made success in producing such films as Der talentierte Mr. Ripley (1999), Der stille Amerikaner (2002) and Unterwegs nach Cold Mountain (2003). Pollack returned to the director's chair in 2004, when he directed Die Dolmetscherin (2005), the first film ever shot on location at the United Nations Headquarters and within the General Assembly in New York City.\n\nIn 2000, Sydney Pollack was honored with the John Huston Award from the Directors Guild of America as a \"defender of artists' rights.\" He died from cancer on May 26, 2008, at his home in the Los Angeles suburb of Pacific Palisades, California.\n\nViacom Chairman Sumner Murray Redstone was the multi-billionaire who was the leading shareholder of media conglomerate Viacom and CBS Corp.\n\nHe was born Sumner Murray Rothstein on May 27, 1923, in Boston, Massachusetts. His father, Michael Rothstein, created National Amusements, a chain of three drive-in theaters, in 1936, after starting out with one drive-in in Valley Stream, New York. In 1940, his family changed their surname to \"Redstone,\" the English translation (\"red stone\") of the Yiddish Rothstein. Sumner attended Harvard College after graduating at the top of his class from the elite Boston Latin School, completing his bachelor of arts degree in three years during World War II, when college years were accelerated so that graduates could serve in the military. Redstone served in the army during World War II, working at the Pentagon decoding Japanese messages. After being demobilized, he remained in Washington and matriculated at Georgetown University Law School before transferring to Harvard Law. After graduating from Harvard Law with an LL.B, he returned to Washington, DC.\n\nAfter working for the U.S. Department of Justice in San Francisco, Redstone went into private practice for several years before eventually returning to his father's National Amusements, which he turned into a major motion picture exhibitor in New England. He first made National Amusements one of the premier drive-in circuits in the country before turning to indoor exhibition. In 1964 National Amusements started building multi-screen theaters, originally called \"twin theaters.\" These developed into the \"multiplexes\" and \"megaplexes\" that made National Amusements one of the top indoor exhibitors in the country, a great repositioning of the company, and a fortuitous one as the drive-in circuit faded away.\n\nRedstone branched out of exhibition, as he believed that controlling the content was the way of the future--though distribution channels constantly change (from movie theaters, to TV, to cable, to videotape, to DVD), content remains constant. With this philosophy he began investing in motion picture production companies, turning a profit on buying, holding and selling shares.\n\nIn 1987 Redstone engineered a hostile takeover of Viacom International by National Amusements. Viacom began as a subsidiary of CBS, syndicating programs for the network. However, when the FCC in 1971 established its now rescinded \"fin-syn\" rule (that television networks could not syndicate programs they produced), Viacom was spun off from CBS. As a separate company Viacom continued to syndicate most of CBS' TV programs but was free to syndicate programs for others. After syndicating programs for cable TV channels, Viacom itself moved into cable and acquired MTV Networks in 1985. It represented a good platform from which to develop a content-distribution behemoth.\n\nAfter winning voting control of Viacom, Redstone engaged in a series of acquisitions to make Viacom one of the top players in the modern media industry. During the 1990s Viacom eventually would own Columbia Pictures, Twentieth-Century Fox, Orion Pictures and Paramount Pictures, making huge profits from the sale of all but Paramount, which would become the motion picture arm of the conglomerate.\n\nParamount Communications, parent of Paramount Pictures, was acquired in 1993. Although criticized initially for paying too much for the company, Redstone helped pay for the acquisition by selling off some of its assets, including Madison Square Garden and its cable TV properties, and Simon & Schuster's educational publishing units. The sale of Paramount Communications' assets made the acquisition substantially profitable.\n\nRedstone then acquired Blockbuster Entertainment, which gave Viacom Aaron Spelling's TV production company and a huge library of films, most of which were absorbed into Paramount Pictures' own library. Blockbuster eventually was spun off into its own independent entity. In 2000 Viacom pulled off arguably its most important acquisition when it acquired its former corporate parent, CBS Corp. In December of 2005 Paramount acquired Dreamworks SKG for an estimated $1.6 billion.\n\nUnder Redstone's management, Viacom has assembled one of the largest and most diversified media conglomerates, covering TV broadcasting, cable TV, radio broadcasting (Infinity Broadcasting), outdoor advertising, music publishing, motion pictures, television production, and its original business of TV syndication (King World Productions, which syndicates Die Oprah Winfrey Show (1986)).\n\nIn 2005 Viacom International was split into two companies, Viacom and CBS Corp. Redstone was chairman of both the new Viacom and of CBS, controlling a majority of both firms. At one point, controlled over 70% of the voting stock of Viacom, which is a subsidiary of National Amusements, his private family-owned company.\n\nNational Amusements, whose president is Sumner's daughter (and probable successor) Shari E. Redstone, also owns a controlling interest (70%) of video-game maker Midway Games. In addition to its controlling interests in Viacom and CBS Corp., National Amusements is an international chain of movie theaters with 1,500 screens operated by the chains Showcase Cinemas, Multiplex Cinemas, KinoStar and Cinema de Lux banners in the U.S., the U.K., South America and Russia. It additionally operates IMAX theaters in the U.S. and Argentina. The firm is also a partner with AMC Theatres in the on-line ticketing firm \"movietickets.com.\"\n\nRedstone's autobiography, \"A Passion To Win\" (co-written by Peter Knobler), was published in 2001 by Viacom's Simon & Schuster subsidiary. In 2006, he was ranked #63 on Forbes magazine's list of the 100 richest people in the world, with an estimated worth of $7.7 billion.\n\nHe died on August 11, 2020, in Los Angeles, at the age of 97.\n\nJohn C. McGinley's path to stardom is a story that reads like a classic Hollywood script. While an understudy in New York in the Circle-In-The-Square production of John Patrick Shanley's \"Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,\" he was spotted by director Oliver Stone and soon after was cast in \"Platoon,\" the first of a long list of collaborations between Stone and McGinley which includes \"Wall Street,\" \"Talk Radio,\" \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"Nixon\" and \"Any Given Sunday.\"\n\nHe stars as the title character in IFC's scripted comedy-horror series, \"Stan Against Evil,\" on which he also serves as a producer. John C. stars as disgruntled former police sheriff 'Stanley Miller,' a sour, aging bulldog who has recently lost his position as head honcho due to an angry outburst at his wife's funeral. When the new sheriff opens his eyes to the plague of angry demons haunting their small New Hampshire town, 'Stan' begrudgingly joins an alliance with her to fight them off.\n\nJohn C.'s deep commitment to independent films has driven him to star in and complete production on three upcoming motion pictures in 2016 alone! James Gunn's \"The Belko Experiment,\" Paul Shoulberg's \"The Good Catholic\" and Richard Dresser's \"Rounding Third.\"\n\nHe is an audience favorite for his hilarious portrayal of 'Dr. Perry Cox' in the Emmy-nominated medical comedy series, \"Scrubs,\" which ended its successful nine season run in 2010.
