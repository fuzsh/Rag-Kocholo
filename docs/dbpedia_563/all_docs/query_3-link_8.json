        "text": "Caroline Wilson: Watson's choice saves AFL from hard call\n\nJoe Daniher says teammate Jobe Watson is still a role model for younger players, after the former Essendon skipper announced he would hand back his Brownlow Medal.\n\nAnd Essendon great Matthew Lloyd said 2012 runners-up Trent Cotchin and Sam Mitchell should not be awarded medals, saying it would be better to leave that place in the history books blank.\n\nWatson won football's highest individual honour in 2012, the year he participated in the club's banned supplements program.\n\nHis right to keep the medal was called into question early in 2016, when the Court of Arbitration for Sport slapped him and 33 other past and current Bombers with a season-long ban.\n\nDays before the AFL commission was due to make a decision on the matter, Watson decided he would give it back.\n\nDaniher was part of a ragtag group of listed players and ring-ins who wore red and black in in 2016 and said he was glad to have the 10 banned players who remained Bombers back training at the club.\n\n\"It's an exciting time, it's been a long time since we've had the group back together,\" he told Triple M on Saturday.\n\nHe praised Watson, saying the 31-year-old, along with other older players including Brent Stanton, Dyson Heppell and Michael Hurley were helping to rebuild a strong culture at Essendon.\n\n\"It's never been a question of Jobe's integrity, or how he goes about being an AFL footballer and role model to the community,\" he said.\n\n\"To have a role model like that, to have as a resource every single day is fantastic for the younger people at the football club.\"\n\nDaniher said that is had been a difficult period for Essendon, but one that the players had all learned from.\n\n\"The mindset the guys are having is just to use it as a growing tool and hopefully moving forward that helps us on field,\" he said.\n\nHe said enjoying football would be easier \"when you've got 10 of your best mates coming back to work\".\n\nLloyd said while he would not begrudge Tiger Cotchin and then-Hawk Mitchell accepting medals after the fact, a decision to award them Brownlows would not accurately reflect the 2012 season.\n\nIn any match where Watson or other players among the banned 34 - including Dustin Fletcher, Cale Hooker or Dyson Heppell - polled votes, a player from another team would have missed out as a result.\n\nLloyd said it would be better to simply leave an asterisk next to the year 2012 wherever Brownlow medal winners were recorded.\n\nBut he said Watson should be allowed to hang on the W. S. Crichton Medal he won for being Essendon's best and fairest in the same year, because within the club the players were on a level playing field."
