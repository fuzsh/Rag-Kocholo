Escorts\n\nwill be available from the time it\n\nbecomes dark outside until 12:30\n\nam. The cut-off time for walks will\n\nbe extended 30 minutes later than\n\nin the past to respond to the ru-\n\nmors that unreported rapes have\n\noccurred behind Joyncr Library\n\nJ J J\n\nwhich closes at 12:00 am.\n\nAlso, unlike past years, Jones\n\nhas appointed two co-directors,\n\nBarbara Froio and Ami Banncr-\n\nA 20 year eatiing institution in Greenville sucumbs to progress.\n\nThe building is to be flattened, and coondos will take its place.\n\n(Photo TOM WALTERS)\n\nThe price of parking climbs\n\nman, as opposed to a director and\n\nassistant director.\n\n\"I thought that would make it\n\neasier on both of them because it\n\nwas defined what the director\n\nand assistant director did. But the\n\ndirector alwaysended up with the\n\nbrunt of the work; I just made\n\nthem co-directors and split the\n\nsalary that would have been given\n\nto the assistant director and the\n\ndirector fifty-fifty said Jones.\n\nAnother departure from the\n\npast which Jones strongly empha-\n\nsizes is the fact that this will be the\n\nfirst year that Tirate Walk has had\n\nfemale directors. Jones said,\n\n\"Females are the one who are\n\ngoing to use it so I feel that a girl\n\nwould know what kind of walk-\n\ners she would like to have or what\n\nwe could do to make the program\n\nbetter so it would be more attrac-\n\ntive to other females\n\nIn addition to the co-directors,\n\nJones has selected Mandy Mar-\n\nlowe to serve as the seeretarv\n\ntreasurer of Tirate Walk. Trcs-\n\nently, no funds have been appro-\n\npiated to pay for this position, but\n\nJones intends to request money\n\nfor this purpose. Not onlv will\n\nMariow have traditional duties\n\nsuch as keeping track of money,\n\nbut she will also be responsible tor\n\nrecordii-k information such as:\n\nhow many walks were taken each\n\nnight, points of departuredesti-\n\nnation, and suggestions for im-\n\nprovement. Jones went on to say\n\nthat this is a crucial position for\n\nstatistical purposes.\n\nAs for the walkers and the op-\n\nerators, they will be on a strictly\n\nvoluntary basis. Larry Murphy,\n\nSGA president and the most re-\n\ncent director of Tirate Walk, feels\n\nthat there is a possibility that Ti-\n\nrate Walk will encounter opposi-\n\ntion if it is heavily funded.\n\nEle said \"Troblcms come when\n\nthe girls don't use it. Last year we\n\nhad plenty of walkers, plenty of\n\noperators, it just was not being\n\nused Murphy, who is also in\n\nsupport of using volunteers said\n\nthat many honor societies require\n\nthat their members provide vol-\n\nunteer services.\n\nIn the past, Murphy estimates\n\nthat they usually had 10 to 15\n\noperators and 20 to 25 walkers.\n\nThe walkers are always screened\n\nto ensure the safety of the callers,\n\nand all volunteers work shifts of\n\ntwo to three hours.\n\nThe way that the program\n\nworks is that they have a central\n\nstation which receives phone\n\ncalls. The operators contact the\n\nwalker which is closest to the\n\ncaller. Usually, the waiting period\n\nfor the caller docs not exceed 10 to\n\n15 minutes because the walkers\n\narc strategically stationed on Col-\n\nlege Hill, West Campus, Central\n\nCampus, etc.\n\nOne of the major problems fac-\n\ning the staff and organizers of\n\nTirate Walk is where the central\n\nstation of operation will be lo-\n\ncated. In the past, Mendcnhall has\n\nbeen used, but Murphy said, \"it\n\nmight be in the Erwin Building.\n\nWith the reconstruction of Men-\n\ndcnhall, we are jamming three or\n\nfour people into an office An-\n\nother idea mentioned by Jones is\n\n\"We are thinking about having\n\ntwo locations, one out of Mendcn-\n\nhall and one out of the library\n\nitself Jones said, \"A lot of times\n\npeople just forget that it exists\n\nunless they see it sitting right\n\nthere. It would be more accessible\n\nto people if it was right there. I'm\n\nnot sure exactly how that would\n\nwork\n\nEven though the plans for Tirate\n\nWalk are still incomplete, the SGA\n\n(and SRA) are getting an earlier\n\nstart than did last fall. Jones has\n\nalready selected two co-directors.\n\nThe program, like last year, is\n\nscheduled to begin in October,\n\nbut Jones said, \"AI don't want to\n\nstart Tirate Walk when it's still\n\nkind of up in the air. I want every-\n\nthing to be planned and organ-\n\nized. So, my goal date to start\n\noperation is October 1. I think\n\neverything should be set to go by\n\nthen\n\nDuring the SGA elections last\n\nspring, Tirate Walk and its recent\n\nfailure was a major campaign is-\n\nsue. Both Murphy and Jones in-\n\ncluded its reinstatement as part of\n\ntheir campaign platform.\n\nWhen questioned on why Ti-\n\nrate Walk folded last semester,\n\nMurphy commented, \"I resigned\n\nat the end of fall ? and it never\n\nstarted back up, the SGA vice-\n\npresident is in charge of it, it's one\n\nof his duties\n\nJones answered a similar ques-\n\ntion saying, \"The director had to\n\nstep down and another qualified\n\ndirector was never found so\n\nthings kept going downhill and\n\norganization got really badit is\n\nalways the vice-president of Stu-\n\ndent Government's job to ensure\n\nthat it is in working order.\n\nSee PIRATE, page 2\n\nSince the long distance service is not in operation yet, dormotory students are forced to find other\n\nmeans to call home.

Reserved\n\nparking prices went from $120 to\n\n$150and temporary parking priv-\n\niledges will increase also.\n\nThe increase according to\n\nClifton Moore, Vice Chancellor of\n\nBusiness Affairs is to provide\n\nmoney to pay back intereset on a\n\nloan tor the development ot 950\n\nnew spaces.\n\n\"We hope to raise around\n\n$183,000 this year with the in-\n\ncreased price.

An appointment system is\n\nin affect to eliminate the time it\n\ntakes students to see a physician or\n\nhealth care provider.\n\nDirector of Nursing at the SHS\n\nDianne Marshburn said, \"We (the\n\nSHS) initiated the appointment\n\nsystem in the Fall of 1987. We feel\n\nas though it is important to make\n\nthe students aware ot the appoint-\n\nment system since it is a fairly new\n\npractice According to Ms.\n\nMarshburn there are several ad-\n\nvantages to the appointment sys-\n\ntem.\n\n\"Because so many students are\n\nworking jobs, as well as trying to\n\ngo to school full-time, the appoint-\n\nment system allows us to work\n\naround their schedule she said.\n\n\"Some other advantages are the\n\ndecrease in the students waiting\n\ntime; which physician the student\n\nwould prefer; and what time of\n\nT\n\nday the student would like to\n\ncome. So, they have an opportu-\n\nnity to have an input into their\n\nhealth care, she said.\n\nA small sample study of 290\n\nvisitors to the SHS was done by a\n\nclass in the ECU School of\n\nBuisness. It shows that the visitor\n\nwaited 9.08 minutes after making\n\nan appointment compared to\n\nwaiting 28.03 by walking in.\n\nEven with making an appoint-\n\nment the survey shows that the\n\nstudent usually has to wait a short\n\nperiod of time.\n\n'They (the students) do have to\n\nwait a little while, because one\n\nstudent might have a problem that\n\nrequires more time than antici-\n\npated, which conflicts with the\n\nnext persons appointment. But,\n\nwe try to keep it within a few\n\nminutes of the scheduled appoint-\n\nment said Ms. Marshburn.\n\nEven though appointments can\n\nbe made at the infirmary, students\n\nstill have the option of walking in\n\nwithout an appointment.\n\n'The SHS still uses the other\n\nsystem which we call the walk in\n\nSee APPOINTMENTS, page 2\n\nt\n\nT IE EAST CAROLINIAN\n\nAUGUST 23, 1988\n\nCar crashes kill eight\n\n(AD?

Reagan had\n\ndone his homework, Powell declared. In fact, Re-\n\nagan had just headed off with a thick briefing book.\n\nIt was a pathetic moment. Pathetic that the White\n\nHouse should feel it necessary to claim that the\n\nleader of the free world had read a briefing book\n\nbefore confronting his superpoer rival. Even more\n\npathetic, though, was that surely almost no one\n\nbelieved it. Reagan may have toddled away with\n\nthat briefing book, but who thinks he even made it\n\nthrough the executive summary?\n\nMost pathetic of all is that neither the need to assert\n\nthe president's mastery of the issues, nor this\n\nassertion's inherent implausibility, caused the sligh-\n\nest stir. We've grown completely used to the idea\n\nthat the nation's chief executive doesn't exercise his\n\nbrain very much. Imagine anyone bothering to claim\n\npublicly that Margaret Thatcher was prepared for a\n\nmeeting of any sort. And imagine anyone doubting\n\nBut the past 12 years hae seen a reversal in\n\nconventional notions about brains as they relate to\n\nthe presidency. First came Jimmy Carter to give\n\nintelligence a bad name. Then came Ronald Reagan\n\nto elevate thickheadedness into some kind of mysti-\n\ncal power.\n\nCarter's appeitite for options papers and his ob-\n\nsession with detail (the infamous tennis court sched-\n\nule) were seen as one reason for his failed presi-\n\ndency. Reagan's \"success meanwhile, was attrib-\n\nuted partly to a supposed clarity of vision achieved\n\nby not trying to keep too many things in his head at\n\nonce, and not adding any new ingredients to the\n\nstew after about 1964. Three years ago, when\n\nReagan's reputation was at its apogee, an active\n\nintelligence was widely considered not merely\n\nunnecessary to great leadership but very likely a\n\nhandicap.\n\nWith Reagan's decline, maybe this is changing.\n\nOne thing I find appealing about Michael Dukakis is\n\nobviously smart. Or, to avoid an argument aobut\n\ngenes, let's just say he'samanof great mental energy\n\nand intellectual curiosity. George Bush doesn't radi-\n\nate Reagan's sublime sense that the computers are\n\ndown.\n\nBut he doesn't give the impression of operating\n\nwith extra RAM, either. Yes, what a president thinks\n\nis more important than how much he thinks. Yet\n\nsurely brains are an advantage in leading the coun-\n\ntry.\n\nBut is the perception of brainpower an advantage\n\nin winning the election? It shouldn't be hard to\n\nconvince the voters that intelligence is a desirable\n\nquality in the person who'll have his finger on the\n\nbutton, his hand on the throttle of the economy, his\n\nbackside planted across the table from Gorbachev,\n\nand suchlike metaphors. But there are two perils.\n\nOne is the Carter analogy. Mike Dukakis, as every\n\nprofile informs us, once took a book on Swedish land\n\nuse planning to read on the beach. That raised the\n\nspecter of a humorless bureaucrat who lacks human-\n\nity and can't see the forest for the trees. Too much\n\n\"management not enough \"vision etc. But the\n\nDukakis people have done a pretty good job of\n\nturning this one into an endearing foible. Good old\n\nDuke, earnestly plugging away on Swedish land use .\n\nplanning while the rest of us play volleyball.\n\nThe second peril is the somewhat phony anti-\n\nelitism that has gripped the strategists of both par-\n\nties. Democrats are portraying George Bush as a\n\ndesiccated artistorcrat; Republicans want to portray\n\nDukakis as what used to be called a \"pointy-headed\n\nliberal In this atmoshphere, any attempt to make a\n\nvirtue of the fact that Dukakis is the more (shall we\n\nsay) mentally alert of the cwo is likely to play right\n\ninto the hands of the enthusiastic young dema-\n\ngogues who are running the Bush campaign.\n\nNo figure even remotely resembling the original\n\npointy-headed liberal, Adlai Stevenson, could be\n\nnominated for president by either party today. Sen.\n\nPaul Simon had his moment during the primaries,\n\nbut thaf s because he managed to create a persona\n\nartfully combining the professional demeanor of a\n\nStevenson with a down-home, straight-talk carica-\n\nture of Harry Truman. On the Republican side, even\n\nformer football star Jack Kemp was considered too\n\nerudite because he kept talking about the gold stan-\n\ndard.\n\nIt was not always thus. John F. Kennedy put a great\n\nemphasis on appearing brainier than he really was.\n\nWhen the Kennedy imageers contrasted their man's\n\n\"vigor\" with the lethargy of the Eisenhower years,\n\nintellect was part of the package, right along with\n\nglamor, athleticism and youth.\n\nLBJ and Nixon were both traumatized by intellec-\n\ntual insecurities, and certainly made no issue of their\n\nintelligence, although it was formidable. In Nixon's\n\ncase, his detractors probably respected his brain-\n\npower more than his admirers did; intelligence took\n\non a negative spin with adjectives like \"crafty\" But\n\nas recently as 1976, when Carter defeated Gerald\n\nFord ? the man who allegedly couldn't walk and\n\nchew gum at the same time ? mental capacity was\n\nheld to be a plus, not a minus, in running for presi-\n\ndent.\n\nMaybe Dukakis can figure out a way to make\n\nbrains a political asset once more.

Campaigning in\n\nTexas, Bush explained that the American Civil Lib-\n\nerties Union is \"pretty far out in left field\" and does\n\nnot reflect \"Texas values Campaigning in Ken-\n\ntucky, he declared that the ACLU \"is not exactly in\n\nthe mainstream of Kentucky politics\" because it is\n\ncomposed of \"liberals\" who ge criminals off on\n\ntechnicalities.\n\nI wonder if Bush would apply this analysis to the\n\nACLU's latest cause: Oliver North. The organiza-\n\ntion has filed a brief arguing that criminal charges\n\nagainst North and his Iran-Contra colleagues should\n\nbe dropped. Reason: North's Fifth Amendment\n\nright against self-incrimination v. as hopelessly\n\ncompromised when he was forced to testify against\n\nhis will in Congressional hearings a year ago. Bush\n\nhas eager to wrap himself in North's popularity,\n\nwhen convenient. Is this one of the loopholes, and is\n\nOllie one of the criminals, Bush is referring to?\n\nIn order ot prevent North, John Poindextcr and\n\nAlbert Hakim from pleading the Fifth Amendment\n\nand refusing to testify at last year's hearings, Con-\n\ngress gave them what is called \"use immunity\n\nThat means nothing they said could be used in any\n\nfuture prosecution. The alternative is called \"trans-\n\nactional immunity meaning that you can't be\n\nprosecuted at all for any crime you testify about.\n\nUse immunity in federal prosecutions is author-\n\nized by the \"Omnibus Crime Control and Safe\n\nStreets Act of 1968 That act, a conservative rcponse\n\nto the turmoil of the 1960s, was supposed to correct\n\na grab bag of exactly the sort of liberal excesses Bush\n\ncomplains of. Use immunity was intended as a way\n\nto get a criminal's testimony against his colleagues\n\nwithout having to let him go free.\n\nIran-contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh\n\nand his sta H went to enormous lenghts to assure that\n\ntheir prosecution does not use any \"immunized\"\n\ntestimony. They put \"under seal\" all the evidence\n\nthey had accumulated before North ct al testified, to\n\nprove it's not tainted. They kept detailed records of\n\nhow they acquired each new piece of evidence.\n\nDuring the testimony itself, they stopped reading\n\nthe newspaper and watching TV.\n\nNorth's lawyers and the ACLU argue that in a case\n\nso widely publicized that it has become \"part of\n\nAmerican folklore such steps are insufficient.\n\nDespite their best efforts, prosecutors can't possibly\n\nhave avoided exposure to what North and the others\n\nsaid, and can't possibly prove that this didn't afert\n\nany decision they made. Nor czn they prove that\n\nwitnesses and jurors weren't affected.\n\nWalsh argues that what prosecutors, witnesses\n\nand jurors may incidentlly have learned is irrele-\n\nvant. What matters is what they use. In all criminal\n\ncases, witnesses are sworn to testify only from per-\n\nsonal knowledge, and this one's no different. As for\n\njurors (although Walsh didn't put it this way),\n\nthere's never a shortage in America of people amaz-\n\ningly ignorant of the most important public affairs.\n\nDistrict Judge Gerhardt Gesell ruled for Walsh,\n\nthough he said the questions could be reviewed\n\nagain after any conviction. For myself, I'm glad I'm\n\nnot a judge because I just can't decide.\n\nIt's certainly clear that whatever tiny advantage\n\nthe prosecutors may have gained from the testimony\n\nis far outweighed by the disadvantage of all the\n\nknots they tied themselves into while trying to avoid\n\nbeing influenced.\n\nBut the point for Ollie North fans like George Bush\n\nto keep in mind is that this dispute is over presuma-\n\nbly accurate and presumably incriminating infor-\n\nmation. That's what the Fifth Amendment protects.\n\nAn American criminal trial is Is: a venue of truth-\n\nseeking than it is an elaborate game in which the\n\ntruth is only one consideration.\n\nAnd the game is never more elaborate than when\n\nin the hands of someone like North's lawyer, Brenda\n\nSullivan. The Fifth Amendment question alone has\n\nalready generated a foot of documents. And this is\n\nonlv one of many promising avenues of delay and\n\nobfiiscation defense lawyers are pursuing.\n\nSullivan's mentor, Edward Bennett Williams, once\n\nremarked puckishly that the right to a speedy trial is\n\nthe least-exercised right in the Constitution.\n\nNo other country in the world would give Oliver\n\nNorth so many opportunities to \"get off on techni-\n\ncalities\" that have nothing to do with whether he\n\nbroke the law. If the North prosecution is thrown out\n\non Fifth Amendment grounds, people like me will\n\nfind it terribly frustrating that the Constitution\n\nshould rescue someone who clearly holds its values\n\nin contempt.\n\nBut we will also recognize that it is one of the\n\nglories of America that it allows such things to\n\nhappen. And we'll recognize that the American\n\nCivil Liberties Union is helping to protect that glory.\n\nEven if we think that in this case or some other the\n\nACLU goes too far, we're glad to have it around\n\nbecause we know that zealots keep the rest of us\n\nhonest.\n\nGeorge Bush, by contrast, would like us to believe\n\nthat there is something urTcxan, un-Kcntuckyan -\n\nyou. know what he's trying to say - downright un-\n\nAmerican about the zealous, even excessive, con-\n\ncern for individual rights.\n\nGen. Assembly\n\nvotes on bill\n\nThis week, the N.C. General\n\nAssembly is expected to vote on a\n\n$160 million education spending\n\nbill which includes land acquis-\n\ntion and renovations line items\n\nfor ECU.\n\n\"We are still working on the\n\nbill in the House and i t hasn' t been\n\nfinalized said Rep. Ed Warren,\n\nD-Pitt County on the education\n\nspending pact. In the bill in the\n\nstate house, Warren said ECU is\n\nexpected to be the beneficiary of\n\n$500,000 request for land acquis-\n\ntions and of a $3.5 million request\n\nfor renovations to Memorial\n\nGym.\n\nWarren, the chairman of the\n\nAppropriations Base Budget\n\nCommittee on Education, said\n\nappropriations for a new library\n\nto replace Joyncr library are not\n\nyet in the planning stages.\n\nThe appropriation for land\n\nacquistion will provide for new\n\navenues for growth of the ECU\n\ncampus. With ECU enrollment\n\nincreasing each year in the recent\n\npast, the land purchased with the\n\nappropriation will remedy con-\n\ncerns of not enough space.\n\nThe possibility of renovations\n\non the 31 year-old Memorial Gym\n\ncomes eight months after the SG A\n\nsigned a resolution calling for the\n\nneed of improvements in ECU's\n\nrecreations. The renovations to\n\nMemorial will compliment the\n\nnew recreation facility which is\n\nstill in the planning stages.\n\nIn addition to the two appro-\n\npriations, Warren said the pact is\n\nexpected to include a $50,000\n\ngrant to the ECU Geology Depart-\n\nment.\n\nThe spending bill reaches the\n\nfloor one week after the legisla-\n\ntors passed a supplemental pact\n\nwhich included $100.9 million in\n\noperating expenses for ECU.\n\n\"I Should've Bought From\"\n\nV.A.

Lloyd Bentsen,\n\nhave not come under attack. Oth-\n\nerwise, Dukakis has kept to his\n\nown campaign themes and today\n\nwas visiting northeastern Massa-\n\nchusetts, a region he often cites\n\nwhen discussing his record of\n\neconomic development.\n\nBush had a speech scheduled to\n\na Veterans of Foreign Wars con-\n\nvention in Chicago.\n\nBush was clearly unhappy Sun-\n\nday with the intense scrutiny of\n\nQuayle's background and with\n\nDemocratic criticism of his own\n\ndecision-making. He said he's\n\nsticking with Quayle, with 'no\n\nhesitancy but that the Indiana\n\nsenator needs time \"to get his act\n\ntogether\" before campaigning on\n\nhis own.\n\nBush, who conducted joint\n\nappearances with Quayle in the\n\nMidwest over the weekend, said\n\nQuayle will begin campaigning\n\nalone \"as soon as he can get\n\nsquared away\" with a staff and a\n\nschedule of appearances.\n\nThroughout their appearances\n\nin Indiana and Ohio, questions\n\ncontinued to be raised about the\n\ncircumstances of Quayle's enlist-\n\nment in the Guard at the height of\n\nthe Vietnam War in 1969. He was\n\n22 then, and described himself at\n\nthe time as a supporter of the war.\n\nQuayle has said that before his\n\nstudent deferment from the draft\n\nexpired, he discussed with his\n\nfamily his desire to join the\n\nGuard. A former top newspaper\n\nemployee of the family said he\n\ninterceded with the Guard on\n\nQuayle's behalf.\n\nQuestions also are being re-\n\nleased about Quayle's law school ?\n\nadmission. The Cleveland Plain\n\nDealer reported Sunday that\n\nQuayle did not meet the academic\n\nrequirements of Indian Univer-\n\nsity law school but got in anyway\n\nafter meeting with the admissions\n\ndean, a Republican judge in a city\n\nwhere Quayle's family owned the\n\nlocal newspaper.\n\nThe Plain Dealer quoted\n\nQuayle's father, James C. Quayle,\n\nas saying his son met with the\n\ndean after being initially rejected\n\nby the law school. \"He talked his\n\nway in the elder Quayle said.\n\nBush dismissed questions\n\nabout the law school admission\n\nby saying \"I don't see that there's\n\nan enormous demand from the\n\npublic to learn this guy's high\n\nschool grades\n\nSenate Minority Leader Bob\n\nDole, R-Kan appearing yn NBC-\n\nTV's \"Meet the Press said Bush\n\ncampaign chairman James A.\n\nBaker III had told him that he\n\nbelieved the military issue was\n\n\"pretty much behind them But\n\nDole said his own opinion is that\n\n\"it's going to last awhile\n\nDemocrats were quick to chal-\n\nlenge Bush's decision-making\n\nability.\n\n\"Why did George Bush pick\n\nDaniel Quayle?

Others promise jobs for hus-\n\nbands and wives.\n\nSome lure their big fish with\n\nperks such as additional research\n\nassistants or help in finding a new\n\nhome.\n\nThe reasons for such aggressive\n\napproaches are many.\n\nGillian Cell, dean of the College\n\nof Arts and Sciences at the Univcr-\n\nsity of North Carolina at Chapel\n\nHilhattributed the keener compe-\n\ntition for professors to a drop in\n\nthe number of students pursuing\n\ndoctoral degrees, a trend she said\n\nstarted in the early 1970s when\n\ncollege teaching jobs were scarce.\n\nOthers attribute the scholar-\n\nchase to the fact that many of the\n\nnation's professors are nearing\n\nretirement age. Future-minded\n\nschools are hiring now so as not to\n\nbe caught short in the coming\n\ndecade.\n\nPerhaps most compelling, pro-\n\nfessors with national reputations\n\nare seen as magnets for top gradu-\n\nate students and lucrative re-\n\nsearch grants. Both boost a\n\nschool's reputation and, at least in\n\ntheory, produce higher-quality\n\nclassroom teaching.\n\nYet since 1980, faculty salaries\n\nat UNC-CH and N.C. State Uni-\n\nversity have fallen behind those\n\noffered by major research cam-\n\npuses in many other states, re-\n\nsearch shows.\n\nIn 1980, the American Associa-\n\ntion of University Professors'\n\nannual salary study ranked UNC-\n\nCH in the top tier of major re-\n\nsearch universities.\n\nSince then, it has fallen to the\n\nassociation's second tier.\n\nDuring the 1986-87 school year,\n\nthe average salary for a full pro-\n\nfessor was $52,800 at NCSU and\n\n$53,200 at UNC-CH - roughly\n\n$4,000 and $6,000 less than the\n\naverage professor's pay at Duke\n\nand the University of Virginia.\n\nThis summer, North Carolina\n\nlegislators approved an average\n\npay raise for UNC system faculty\n\nof 4.5 percent, of which 2.5 percent\n\nis to be awarded according to\n\nmerit.\n\nThaf s not enough, say educa-\n\ntors.\n\n\"How much merit can you give\n\nwhen you have 2.5 percent?\"\n\nasked Lawrence Gilbert, chair-\n\nman of the biology department at\n\nUNC-CH. \"At a private institu-\n\ntion they can always find the\n\nmoney\n\nGREENVILLE RECREATION AND\n\nPARKS DEPARTMENT\n\nSOCCER COACHES NEEDED\n\nThe Greenville Recreation and Parks Department is\n\nrecruiting for 10-14 part-time soccer coaches for the fall\n\nsemester program.

Rubino said that he will\n\nkeep most of the appliances, but\n\nthe Bakkers' furniture is just not\n\nhis taste.\n\n\"This house just eats furniture\n\nRubino said in reference to its\n\nsheer size. He has bought some of\n\nhis own furnishings and moved\n\nothers around, but can't seemed\n\nto fill the rooms.\n\nThe dining room now has three\n\ndining tables. Rubino will get rid\n\nof them and replace them with\n\none larger table, which may have\n\nto be custom made.\n\nThe decorators will soon be\n\nknocking out walls, icaring up\n\ncarpet and paneling and creating\n\nthe relaxed atmosphere Rubino\n\nwants.\n\n\"1 looked at the house and it was\n\njust what I wanted he said. \"1 am\n\ngoing to make it into a very up-\n\nbeat California look\n\nThe iiving room is huge, but\n\ndark. Rubino hopes to brighten it\n\nby removing some of the brick on\n\none wall and perhaps even doing\n\naway with some or all of the pan-\n\ncling.\n\nAs part of a tour of the house,\n\nRubino notes the secret room built\n\nin the basement. Hidden behind a\n\nbookcase, the narrow room is\n\ncrudely built with shelves and\n\nmetal door to the outside.\n\nAn exercise room decorated\n\nwith silver carpet and wallpaper\n\nwill be made into a game room.\n\nRubino will bring in his pool table\n\nand a video game belonging to the\n\nBakkers.\n\nOutside the game room is what\n\nRubino calls the family room. It\n\nhas extensive ceiling lighting,\n\nwhich makes Rubino speculate it\n\nwas once used as a studio for\n\ntaping.\n\nA small room, which was once\n\nfilled with plants, could require\n\nthe most work. A lcakly roof\n\ncaused some structural damage,\n\nbut once all repairs are made, it\n\nwill be \"a room right out of Casa-\n\nblanca Rubino wants it to in-\n\nclude wicker furniture and have a\n\nSouth Seas motif.\n\nBesides the damage from the\n\nleaky roof, the fact that the house\n\nhas been vacant for a year is evi-\n\ndent elsewhere. The paint on the\n\npool has chipped, the grounds are\n\novergrow a and the patio furni-\n\nture left outside has decayed.\n\nA fishing pole sits on the patio\n\nbut Rubino said it is not his.\n\n\"I like to fish at a good restau-\n\nrant he said with a chuckle.\n\nSecluded behind trees is a two-\n\nstory playhouse.
