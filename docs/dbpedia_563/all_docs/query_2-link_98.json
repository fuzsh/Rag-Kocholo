        "text": "In a 10-part series, BBC broadcaster Barry Davies recalls the most memorable Olympic moments of his 44 years on air from the Games.\n\nThis moment gave us the first gold medal for a sport and the first gold medal for a big, big nation in the shape of Indonesia.\n\nBadminton was introduced to the Olympic Games at Barcelona 1992 and, having come over from the gymnastics for the women's singles final, I had very little time to warm up.\n\nSitting next to me was Craig Reedie, my co-commentator that day and a man who had played a huge role in getting badminton into the Games.\n\nI had no badminton qualifications. I had played a little, like most people I suppose, but never for a club or in any competition. An interview in 1978 with Gillian Gilks, who was then the world number one, had earned me a trip to cover badminton at that year's Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, and I found myself doing the commentary from then on.\n\nBut in Craig I had an expert alongside me, a former badminton association president and now one of our representatives on the International Olympic Committee.\n\nBy the time I sat down, he was already around 30% hyper. He wanted badminton's debut to be successful and in front of us we had a brilliant player, the 5ft 3in Indonesian star Susi Susanti, who looked to be on her way to a great victory.\n\nAs the match went on, his excitement grew and grew. I wanted him to remove himself from the passion to a degree and tell us more about why Susanti was beating her Korean opponent.\n\nCraig has since claimed that I slipped him a piece of paper with the phrase, \"Tactics, you [bleep]!\" written on it. I don't recall adding that last word, but I do recall suggesting that he could do with not being quite so emotionally involved.\n\nIn the end, though, I became as involved as him. Everybody did. Susanti won Indonesia's first-ever Olympic gold medal and that moment produced such a reaction, both inside the venue and in Indonesia."
