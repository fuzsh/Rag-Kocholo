        "text": "Pawe≈Ç Jankowski, Country Manager of Endava in Poland, in an interview with IBStech talked about the company's development plans, the current situation in the IT market, his new position and planned projects ü§ùüèª He points out that the current situation in the IT market has been changed by the pandemic, remote work and the modifications that have been made to recruitment. The challenges associated with this have led to greater meticulousness, efficiency and a much higher quality of service. What's important, the company focuses on the development of its employees, because it is built on their knowledge and skills. Endava has only been on the Polish market for a year, but has already managed to organise several interesting events for the DEV community, such as Connect IT in Gda≈Ñsk. These and other initiatives are also supported by us so that the IT market can continue to develop dynamically. Read more about the strategy and challenges in Pawe≈Ç Jankowski's new position ‚§µÔ∏è\n\nIt's been just over six months since starting Avega UK from scratch along with Coral Bidel and the journey has been enlightening. Here are some key lessons learned along the way: - Patience is key. It's a skill set that not everyone possesses (including me), but it's necessary for success. - You don't know what you don't know. Leverage the skills of others or hire experts to help guide you through tricky processes. - Hire well, particularly in smaller offices. Getting it right on day one and hiring culture setters can be a blessing (thank you Mariam Al Khurashi and Farhana Khan) - Kindness goes a long way. It's been heartening to receive advice and support from so many smart people. - People like people. Winning some early clients has reinforced the importance of building strong relationships in your career. We're always open to learning more and happy to share our journey with anyone starting on their own. #avegauk #avega #corporateservices #fundadministration\n\nOutsourcing has evolved, and it's time to debunk the old myths of inadequate work conditions and subpar communication. At Centris, we're proud to showcase a modern approach to nearshore outsourcing right in Monterrey ‚Äî so close to the United States, our BD Specialist, Brian Kirk jokes, \"If they were any closer, they would be in the United States!\" üåü Why Monterrey?

Want to be a part of it? üìà Last year was an amazing year for the HelmsBriscoe London & SE UK Team. Our teams year on year production increased by a huge 78% and that is testament to all 17 associates we have throughout the region. Individually, Anke Wallace was the UK&I Top Producer, Tarannum Banatwalla & Emma Falsey won ‚ÄòEMEA Best Newcomer‚Äô and ‚òÄÔ∏èSi√¢n Duncan won ‚ÄòEMEA Associate of the Year‚Äô in our recent EMEA Awards, so massive congratulations to them. We also grew quite a bit with 7 new people joining us at various times throughout the year. We have a great comradery throughout the team and the support everyone gives each other is fantastic to see and essential to individual and team success. üåç We also saw some people move to other countries, so transfer teams, which is another one of the great benefits of our model. If you move, your business can move with you. We have no geographical restrictions for where your clients are based or where they book making the world your oyster. I‚Äôm sure this will be music to the ears of all people in sales who are often limited by geography. I suppose this is partly a congratulations and well done to all in the existing team but also hopefully shows you that if you live anywhere in South East UK this can work for you. It can give you the flexibility you may be looking for, the adaptability moving forward that allows you to balance your priorities and the financial renumeration you need. Importantly, it can also give you the support and sense of belonging and value we all need. üè® So, if you are thinking about making a move into venue sourcing or looking at a more flexible model of working and if you still have doubts and wonder if this can work for you and would like to join a team of successful associates then please just message me directly. I can send you more detail and we can have a chat. You can also just enter your details using the link below. https://lnkd.in/eE6Bj2yP Alternatively, if you don‚Äôt want to take my word for it just reach out to one of the team and ask them directly. #iamHB #whyHB #HBLondon #HBUKI #venuesourcing #venuefinding #meetingprocurement #jointheteam #success #successes #teamsuccess #indvidualsuccess #award #awards #awardwinners #joinourteam #unlimitedearnings #London #hertfordshire #hampshire #berkshire #essex #sussex #kent #remotework #workfromhome #newopportunities #recruitment #eventprofs #eventprofsuk #eventsales #hotelsales #hotelprofs #hotelprofsuk"
