        "text": "The U.S. men's basketball team will be aiming for a fifth straight Olympic gold medal in Paris, and the roster, which was announced in April, is arguably the most star-studded one in years.\n\nHeadlining the team are four players (LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid) who have combined to win eight NBA MVP awards. Eleven of the 12 players were selected as All-Stars during the 2023-24 season.\n\nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr will lead the U.S. men's team in Paris.\n\nBam Adebayo\n\nForward/Center\n\nMiami Heat\n\nAfter playing at the Tokyo Games, the three-time NBA All-Star returns to the roster as a strong defensive presence down low for Team USA. After four straight years of being named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team, Adebayo garnered his inaugural First Team selection this past season. The 26-year-old was also a finalist for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.\n\nDevin Booker\n\nGuard\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nBooker, 27, is a four-time NBA All-Star and headed to his second straight Olympics. One of the NBA's top scorers, he was sixth in the league with 27.1 points per game this past season. Three of the six highest scoring games of Booker's career came in 2024, including a 62-point output against the Indiana Pacers in January.\n\nStephen Curry\n\nGuard\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nCurry has accomplished almost everything throughout his 15 seasons in the NBA. He's a four-time NBA champion, two-time league MVP, 10-time All-Star selection, and the NBA's all-time leader in three-pointers by a wide margin. One of the few things missing from Curry's resume is an Olympic gold medal, and at 36 years old, he'll finally have a chance to get that when he joins Team USA for the first time in Paris.\n\nAnthony Davis\n\nForward/Center\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nDavis last played at the Olympics in 2012, when he was named to the U.S. team as a 19-year-old. Ahead of his second Olympic appearance at Paris 2024, Davis averaged 24.7 points, a career-high 12.6 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks this past season with the Lakers. He also was named to his ninth All-Star team and his third All-NBA Defensive First Team.\n\nKevin Durant\n\nForward\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nAfter helping Team USA win gold at each of the last three Olympics, Durant arguably has become the face of the U.S. men's team. He led the team in scoring (20.6 points per game) during the Tokyo Olympics and was named tournament MVP. In the process, he also became the all-time leading Olympic scorer for the U.S. men. Durant, 35, is a 14-time NBA All-Star, two-time NBA champion, and two-time league MVP. He was fifth in the league in scoring (27.1 points per game) during this past season.\n\nAnthony Edwards\n\nGuard\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nOne of the NBA's top rising stars, Edwards will make his Olympic debut in Paris. The 22-year-old is coming off a breakout season in which he averaged 25.9 points per game, earned his second straight All-Star selection, and led the Timberwolves to the Western Conference Finals for the first time in 20 years. He played for USA Basketball at the 2023 World Cup and was the team's leading scorer.\n\nJoel Embiid\n\nCenter\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nOne of the biggest stories of this Olympic cycle for USA Basketball was the addition of Embiid to the national team pool. Although the 30-year-old was also eligible to represent France and Cameroon in international competition, he committed to the U.S. last October. Because of injuries, the seven-time All-Star and 2023 NBA MVP played in fewer than half of his team's games this past season, but his 34.7 points per game would have made him the league's scoring leader if he had played enough games to be eligible for the honor.\n\nTyrese Haliburton\n\nGuard\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nHaliburton, 24, is set to make his Olympic debut for Team USA. The Pacers guard led the NBA with 10.9 assists per game this past season, was named to his second straight All-Star team, and helped take his team to the Eastern Conference Finals. Like Edwards, he was a member of the 2023 World Cup team.\n\nJrue Holiday\n\nGuard\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nAfter winning gold with Team USA in Tokyo, the 33-year-old is back for his second Olympics and will be coming off a deep playoff run after helping the Celtics win the NBA Finals. Holiday is a two-time All-Star but has made his mark with strong defense â€” he's been named to the NBA All-Defensive First or Second Team in six of the last seven seasons. At the Tokyo Games, Holiday led the U.S. team in assists (3.8) and steals (1.7) per game and was also third in scoring (11.8 points per game).\n\nLeBron James\n\nForward\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nThe NBA's biggest star is returning to USA Basketball for the first time since 2012. James played in three Olympics (2004, 2008, 2012) early in his career and has already accrued two gold medals and one bronze from those Games. At 39 years old, the Paris Games could mark his final Olympic appearance. A legend on the court, James has won four NBA titles and four MVP awards, and he has been named to the All-Star team in 20 of his 21 seasons in the league.\n\nJayson Tatum\n\nForward\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nAfter taking the Celtics to an NBA title, Tatum's next goal will be to get Team USA an Olympic gold medal. The 26-year-old averaged 26.9 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.9 assists this season, leading him to a fifth straight All-Star selection and third-straight All-NBA First Team selection. Making his Olympic debut at the Tokyo Games, Tatum was the team's second-highest scorer with 15.2 points per game.\n\nDerrick White\n\nGuard\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nA late addition to the roster, White was named to the squad after Kawhi Leonard withdrew from Team USA on July 10. After winning an NBA title with the Celtics, the 30-year-old guard will now fill a valuable defensive role for the Olympic team. He averaged 15.2 points, 5.2 assists, 1.2 blocks and 1.0 steals per game during the regular season and was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.\n\nOne of the greatest dynasties in Olympic history, the U.S. women's basketball team has won seven gold medals in a row and will be heavily favored to make it eight straight in Paris.\n\nThe roster has plenty of veteran experience, led by five-time Olympian Diana Taurasi. Three players have won WNBA MVP awards (Taurasi, Breanna Stewart, A'ja Wilson).\n\nThe team will be led by Minnesota Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve.\n\nAll stats mentioned are accurate as of June 10.\n\nNapheesa Collier\n\nForward\n\nMinnesota Lynx\n\nCollier has previously won gold with USA Basketball at the Tokyo Olympics and the 2014 Youth Olympics. One year after earning her third All-Star selection and inaugural All-WNBA First Team selection, the 27-year-old is off to a massive start in 2024. The Lynx star is currently in the top four in the league in points (21.4), rebounds (11.4) and steals (2.2) per game.\n\nKahleah Copper\n\nGuard/Forward\n\nPhoenix Mercury\n\nAfter three All-Star seasons in Chicago, Copper has had a hot start in Phoenix. The 29-year-old is currently the WNBA's third-leading scorer with 24.0 points per game, a mark that would shatter her career high if she's able to keep up the pace. Copper won a WNBA title with the Sky in 2021 and was named Finals MVP.\n\nChelsea Gray\n\nGuard\n\nLas Vegas Aces\n\nGray, 31, has been a key part of the Aces' back-to-back titles, but her health is one of the biggest question marks surrounding this Olympic roster. The point guard sustained a foot injury during last year's WNBA Finals and has yet to return to action. Gray is a five-time All-Star and was a member of the U.S. team that won gold in Tokyo.\n\nBrittney Griner\n\nCenter\n\nPhoenix Mercury\n\nGriner, 33, is one of the most experienced players on the roster, having played with Team USA at the last two Olympics. She was a key part of the last Olympic title, as she scored 30 points in the final against Japan and tied for the team lead with 16.5 points per game. The nine-time WNBA All-Star recently returned from a toe fracture that she sustained during the preseason.\n\nSabrina Ionescu\n\nGuard\n\nNew York Liberty\n\nOne of the top three-point shooters in women's basketball, Ionescu will be playing at her first Olympics. The 26-year-old led the WNBA last year with 3.6 three-pointers made per game while also shooting 44.8% from beyond the arc. Her prolific shooting even led to her facing off against Stephen Curry in a special three-point contest during this year's NBA All-Star festivities. Ionescu has been a WNBA All-Star selection in each of the last two seasons.\n\nJewell Loyd\n\nGuard\n\nSeattle Storm\n\nLoyd, 30, is a two-time WNBA champion, five-time All-Star, and member of the Tokyo Olympic squad. She's coming off a season in which she led the league in scoring (24.7 points per game) and is near the top of the ranks in that category once again this season.\n\nKelsey Plum\n\nGuard\n\nLas Vegas Aces\n\nPlum is one of two players on this roster who made their Olympic debut as a member of the women's 3x3 team in Tokyo. She's also one of four players from the Las Vegas Aces. After back-to-back All-Star seasons that ended in WNBA titles, the 29-year-old will bring her stellar three-point shooting to the Olympic 5-on-5 team for the first time.\n\nBreanna Stewart\n\nForward\n\nNew York Liberty\n\nStewart will play on her third Olympic team in Paris. After being named the tournament MVP at the Tokyo Games (15.0 points, 10.0 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 1.5 blocks, 1.0 steals per game), she'll remain one of Team USA's most important players. Last year, in her first season with the Liberty, Stewart took her team to the WNBA Finals and won her second league MVP award. In addition to her two Olympic gold medals, Stewart's resume also includes three FIBA World Cup golds, two WNBA championships and four NCAA championships."
