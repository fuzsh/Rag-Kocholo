        "text": "HONOUR TO DUNDEE VOLUNTEERS.\n\nENTHUSIASTIC SCENES.\n\nEnthusiastic was the large gathering which met in the Drill Hall last night to do honour to the volunteers of the Black Watch who responded to the call for service in South Africa. Long before the appointed hour over three thousand spectators had assembled, and, as the men marched into the hall to the tune of “The Bonnets of Bonnie Dundee”, cheer upon cheer was sent up. Lord Provost and Mrs Hunter were heartily cheered as they entered. They were accompanied by Sir Thomas Thornton, LL.D.; Bailies Stevenson, Doig, Robertson, and Crichton; Councillors Barrie, High, Longair, and Martin; Mr G.W. Baxter, LL.D.; the Rev. Dr Colin Campbell, Rev. Dr Hugh George Watt, Colonels Hill and Smith, Mr William Thornton, Mr George Watt, &c. Lord Provost Hunter called upon Sir Thomas Thornton to read the minute of Council conferring the freedom, after which he addressed the gathering.\n\nA LARGE CONTINGENT.\n\nThe Lord Provost said they were met there that night for the fourth time since the war began to do honour to those of their fellow-citizens who, at the call of their country, had offered their services in South Africa, there to assist in upholding the supremacy of the Empire. (Applause). After referring to the enthusiastic response made on previous occasions, his Lordship said it was somewhat remarkable, and a cause for pride and admiration, that, after the first burst of enthusiasm, when the glamour was somewhat worn off, to find 63 men in their local corps ready to join their countrymen in an effort to bring peace in South Africa. They were proud to see that the contingent they tonight were to send off was the largest they had met to do honour to. (Applause). They felt proud of their volunteers, proud of what they had done in connection with the war, of their zeal, bravery, and the endurance they displayed. As had been done on three former occasions, the Magistrates and Town Council, with, he was sure, the hearty concurrence of the citizens, resolved to honour and show their appreciation of the motive actuating those who had volunteered for active service by conferring on them the freedom of the city, and placing their names on the burgess roll. (Applause). They felt confident that the present contingent would discharge their duties faithfully and well, and maintain the good name of those who had gone before them, and reflect credit on the city and on the Battalion to which they belonged. (Applause).\n\nA PROUD POSITION.\n\nTheir district stood in the foremost position relative to the number of the population as having sent the largest number of men to the front. Doubtless this was to be accounted for by the fact that this was the home, the centre, and to a large extent the recruiting ground of the grand old regiment, the 42nd – (applause) – a regiment which earned renown and undying glory on many a field – (applause) – a regiment which had been a source of attraction to so many of the sons of Scotland – a regiment which had been led by many gallant officers, whose names would live in the history of their country. (Applause). No district had suffered more than their own through the war, and they felt sure that the outcome of all the sacrifices that had been made by the country would be the means of establishing justice, liberty, and equal rights to all their fellow-subjects in South Africa. (Applause).\n\nThe Lord Provost then called on Sir Thomas Thornton to read the burgess ticket, and the men stepped forward and received the ticket at the hands of the Lord Provost. As each man came forward he was loudly cheered. Sir Thomas Thornton mentioned the melancholy fact that Colour-Sergeant-Instructor SWAN, who had received the honour in absentia, had died four days after it had been decided to confer the honour, but intimated that the parchment would be handed to his relatives.\n\nThe Battalions together send forward 63 men, including 7 who are at present on active service.\n\nColonel Hill and Colonel Smith thanked the Magistrates and Council on behalf of their respective Battalions for the honour that had been done to them.\n\nThe Scotsman, 22nd February 1902"
