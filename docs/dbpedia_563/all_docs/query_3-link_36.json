        "text": "DISTINGUISED ALUMNI OF THE YEAR\n\nLexi Mestas\n\nClass of 2012\n\nLexi was born on September 13, 1993, in Gulfport, MS. Growing up on the Mississippi Gulf Coast made a lasting impact on Lexi throughout her life.\n\nLexi was exuberant, hilarious, ambitious, bold, opinionated, truthful, and generous from the time she was tiny – qualities her family celebrated through every season of her life.\n\nAs a child, Lexi enjoyed reading, soccer, and food, which influenced her adult life as a lifelong competitor, teacher, and food enthusiast. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a 13-year-old Lexi and much of her family moved to Mobile, Alabama. In Mobile, she attended St. Paul's Episcopal School, where she made many lifelong friends, led her peers as junior and senior class president, and began dating her soulmate, David Martin Mayhall. While at St. Paul's, Lexi earned more service hours than any St. Paul's student to date and was awarded the Headmaster's award upon graduation for the student who best exhibits the spirit of St. Paul's and brings honor to the school.\n\nShe attributed the kindness of others to her family after Katrina to her passion toward service to others.\n\nLexi and David Martin attended Loyola University New Orleans, and they were married in New Orleans in the spring of 2016, during their senior year. Lexi majored in political science with a minor in Middle East Peace Studies. She earned high academic honors while working full time and making time to work with the homeless and teach English to new immigrants to New Orleans. Lexi and David Martin studied abroad in India for most of their junior year. David Martin's marriage proposal to Lexi was a fitting end to a semester abroad that proved to be a defining time in their lives and relationship. While traveling across the subcontinent, Lexi fell in love with Indian culture and reconnected with her childhood love for cooking. She was an avid fan of Anthony Bourdain, realizing the power of food in bringing people together. This informed her educational path as she studied food policy and food insecurity in Rome, Italy as a graduate student.\n\nIn 2016, Lexi pursued a Master's Degree in Sustainable Food Studies at the American University in Rome. While in Rome, Lexi made lifelong friends and learned from experts in sustainable food systems, which guided her career when returning to the states. Her master's thesis and field study were conducted in her beloved New Orleans and focused on food injustice. Lexi established deep friendships and traveled throughout Europe during her time in graduate school, arguably living more in her short life than many of those her senior.\n\nAfter Lexi graduated from AUR in 2017, she and David Martin moved to Philadelphia. She began her postgraduate career applying her learnings from AUR directly in one of the country's most underserved communities, Camden, New Jersey. As a FoodCorps service member and later as the county supervisor of Rutger University's SNAP-Education program, Lexi taught children and adults practical ways to eat healthily, even while on government benefits. Ever entrepreneurial, Lexi devised innovative ways to assist the community, including a partnership with Google's Virtual Reality team and writing her own e-cookbook.\n\nOn February 15, 2021, Lexi was diagnosed with low-grade serous ovarian cancer. A rare subtype of ovarian cancer, low-grade serous disproportionately impacts younger women and is usually caught at a late stage.\n\nAfter her diagnosis, Lexi leveraged her social media platform to inform thousands of the symptoms and signs of low-grade serous ovarian cancer. She raised not only awareness but nearly $100,000 in donations toward research to expand treatment options for these patients, met with congressional representatives, and was interviewed for multiple podcasts. Nonprofits dedicated to low-grade serous like STAAR and Cure Our Ovarian Cancer recognized Lexi's passion and sought her social media savvy and fundraising prowess. Lexi's activism was on display for the whole world when her beautiful face was shown on a billboard in Times Square honoring World Ovarian Cancer Day. Adopting Valentino (“Val”), an 11-year-old pit bull/terrier, was a bright spot in an otherwise challenging year.\n\nAfter finishing chemotherapy, Lexi and David Martin moved back to Mobile, Alabama to be closer to family and spend more quality time on their beloved Gulf Coast. While in Mobile, Lexi continued to fundraise and be a source of strength for other ovarian cancer patients. She received care from low-grade serous expert Dr. David Gershenson in Houston, Texas, at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Lexi was feeling better. She returned to full-time work for Visit Mobile, decorated her and David Martin's beautiful midtown home, spent time at Fowl River with her in-laws, attended best friends' weddings, and participated in a camp for young adults with cancer in sunny Hawaii, where she learned to surf and got a tattoo showcasing a nickname one oncologist gave her: “Firecracker.”\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Lexi and David Martin felt ready to move to New York City, which had long been a goal for the young couple. They moved into an apartment in the East Village and jumped into NYC's bustling culture. Lexi quickly became a Broadway enthusiast and soaked up the city's diverse food scene. All the while, Lexi continued to fundraise and support other patients with comfort and clarity. She received care at Memorial Sloan Kettering, a renowned cancer hospital in Manhattan's Upper East Side.\n\nShortly after arriving in New York, Lexi's cancer began causing complications in her lungs, abdomen, and legs. She received highly attentive care from a team of doctors at MSK, led by Dr. Ying Liu. Ultimately, these complications compounded and disrupted Lexi's breathing and blood flow to the heart, which led to her passing in the early morning of June 4, 2023.\n\nLexi was a loving wife, a thoughtful and engaged daughter, a devoted sister, and a doting aunt. She is survived by her husband, David Martin Mayhall (Class of 2012), her parents, Pete and Lisa Mestas, her sisters, Heather Duffy, Liana Mestas (Class of 2008), Raven Mestas (Class of 2015), Rachel Mestas (Sterling), and Alina Christen, her maternal grandparents, Robert and Joy Dean, and paternal grandmother, Clarissa Avila Moore.\n\nDISTINGUISED ALUMNI IN THE ARTS\n\nJeni Herrera-Mullar\n\nClass of 2001\n\nJeni Herrera-Mullar was a member and valedictorian of the Class of 2001 at St. Paul's Episcopal School. She pursued her undergraduate education at the University of Iowa as a Presidential scholar and music scholarship recipient, where she majored in violin performance. After completing her sophomore year, she transferred to the University of Memphis to continue her music studies as a scholarship recipient under Professor Timothy Shiu. During her college years, she achieved significant milestones, winning the University of Iowa Chamber Music competition and becoming a finalist in the University of Memphis Concerto Competition. She graduated summa cum laude as the valedictorian of the College of Fine Arts in 2005 and then moved to Baltimore, MD, to study with Violaine Melancon at the Peabody Conservatory. There, she earned a Master's degree in violin performance and pedagogy, followed by a Doctorate of Musical Arts in 2011.\n\nIn 2006, Jeni was selected as the sole recipient of the Peabody Preparatory Pedagogy Internship under Rebecca Henry. Subsequently, she became a faculty member of the Preparatory Institute in 2007, where she taught hundreds of violin students over eight years. During this period, Jeni also contributed to the community as a teacher with BRIDGES, an inner-city strings program, and developed a curriculum for group violin classes at the Odyssey School, which catered to children with dyslexia. Her passion for music extended to her involvement in various regional orchestras, including the Maryland Symphony, the Howard County Concert Orchestra, the Lancaster Symphony, and the York Symphony. She was a prominent advocate for contemporary music, regularly performing with Baltimore's Evolution Contemporary Music Series.\n\nIn 2009, Jeni assumed the role of an adjunct professor of violin and viola at York College of PA, a position she still holds. Her accomplishments include solo performances and guest appearances with multiple ensembles, such as the Mobile Youth Symphony, the York College Wind Ensemble, Garth Newel Music Center, and the Five Seasons Chamber Music festival. She is featured on albums with the Memphis Baroque Ensemble and singer-songwriter Cameron Blake. Jeni continues to be an active participant with the York Symphony and is a founding and current member of the York College Piano Trio, now known as the York Chamber Players.\n\nReflecting on her time at St. Paul's, Jeni said, “Eighth grade was a transformative time for me at St. Paul's. I think we all go through a little uncertainty during middle school, and this was the year Holly Compton called to ask me if I'd like to join a new chamber music class she was starting. I vividly remembered early lessons with Ms. Compton in the closet of Ms. Bailey's 1st-grade classroom. I'd continued to take private violin lessons for years with various teachers, and I was a member of the Youth Symphony, but never had the opportunity to play chamber music regularly at school. It was during this year that everything started for me. I fell in love with chamber music, and I made some of my closest friends as part of this program. My confidence as a musician soared, too. Getting to play almost daily in this class was incredible. Ms. Compton did an amazing job finding performance opportunities for us in those early years and challenging us. I'll never forget performing Vivaldi on the stage of Carnegie Hall my senior year. My five years in this program no doubt influenced my decision to study music in college and graduate school. To this day, chamber music holds a special place in my heart.”\n\nJeni also holds a Master's degree in Genetic Counseling from the University of Maryland Medical School and has been a board-certified genetic counselor since 2013. She credits her introduction to genetic counseling to Mr. Mutchnick's AP Biology course at St. Paul's. Currently, Jeni serves as a Principal Clinical Scientist for Ambry Genetics, where she researches genes associated with hereditary cancers. She reflects on the impact of her music education on her career, saying, “So much of what I have learned about being a performer and teacher – the discipline required, the attention to detail, the ability to accept criticism and change/better oneself, and especially the need for excellent time management – translates to all aspects of my life and has helped me succeed even as I pursued a second career path. Music is and will always be a central part of my life, and I am so lucky to have found two vocations that I can practice simultaneously.”\n\nJeni currently resides in Parkton, MD, with her husband Jason, their two sons Julian and Nicholas, and their dog Ruggles. When she's not making music, Jeni enjoys outdoor activities such as camping, running, hiking, and traveling with her family.\n\nDISTINGUISHED ALUMNI SERVICE AWARD\n\nJustine Herlihy Bixler\n\nClass of 2007\n\nJustine Herlihy Bixler was born and raised in Mobile and has a deep passion for the city of her birth.
