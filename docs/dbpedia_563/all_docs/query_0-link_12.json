To challenge misconceptions, we curated findings with strong evidence base.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe reviewed studies with more than 2,000 participants or meta-analyses from five or more studies or 2,000 or more participants. We excluded meta-analyses that did not assess publication bias, except for meta-analyses of prevalence. For network meta-analyses we required comparison adjusted funnel plots. We excluded treatment studies with waiting-list or treatment as usual controls. From this literature, we extracted evidence-based assertions about the disorder.\n\nResults:\n\nWe generated 208 empirically supported statements about ADHD. The status of the included statements as empirically supported is approved by 80 authors from 27 countries and 6 continents. The contents of the manuscript are endorsed by 403 people who have read this document and agree with its contents.\n\nConclusions:\n\nMany findings in ADHD are supported by meta-analysis. These allow for firm statements about the nature, course, outcome causes, and treatments for disorders that are useful for reducing misconceptions and stigma.\n\nKeywords: ADHD, diagnosis, treatment, course, outcome, genetics, brain\n\nIntroduction\n\nNearly two decades ago, an international team of scientists published the first International Consensus Statement on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Barkley, 2002). They sought to present the wealth of scientific data attesting to the validity of ADHD as a mental disorder and to correct misconceptions about the disorder that stigmatized affected people, reduced the credibility of health care providers, and prevented or delayed treatment of individuals challenged by the disorder (DosReis et al., 2010; Horton-Salway, 2013; McLeod et al., 2007; Mueller et al., 2012).\n\nThis paper updates the International Consensus Statement by cataloging important scientific discoveries from the last 20 years. We do not intend to present an encyclopedia of ADHD or guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. The latter can be found in the references cited. Our aim is to provide current and accurate information about ADHD supported by a substantial and rigorous body of evidence.\n\nMethods\n\nWe identified evidence-based statements about ADHD through expert scrutiny of published high quality meta-analyses and very large studies. Expert scrutiny was provided by a project Steering Committee (Supplemental Table 1) which included representatives from the following professional groups dedicated to research and clinical care of ADHD: The World Federation of ADHD, EUropean NETwork for Hyperkinetic DIsorderS (Eunethydis), the American Professional Society of ADHD and Related Disorders, the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance, the Asian Federation of ADHD, the Latin American League of ADHD, the Australian ADHD Professionals Association, the Israeli Society of ADHD, the Saudi ADHD Society, Neurodevelopmental Disorders Across Lifespan section of the European Psychiatric Association, the ADHD Guidelines Group of the Association of Medical Scientific Societies in Germany, the ADHD Network of European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, the Chinese Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the ADHD Section of the World Psychiatric Association.\n\nFor large cohort studies, we searched PubMed with these search criteria: ADHD [tiab] AND (nationwide [tiab] OR national [tiab] OR register [tiab] OR registry [tiab]) NOT review [Publication Type] NOT meta-analysis [Publication Type]. For meta-analyses, we searched PubMed with these search criteria: ADHD [All Fields] AND (meta-analysis [Title] OR meta-analysis [Title] OR meta-analytic [Title] OR systematic review [Title]). We excluded meta-analyses that did not assess publication bias, except for meta-analyses of prevalence. For network meta-analyses we required that comparison adjusted funnel plots be presented. For treatment studies, we excluded results of meta-analyses including comparisons of treatments with waiting-list or treatment as usual controls.\n\nApart from statements about the history of ADHD and its diagnostic criteria, we required each evidence-based statement to be supported by meta-analyses or by large registry studies with more than 2,000 participants. We required meta-analyses to report data from five or more studies or 2,000 or more participants.\n\nWe describe the magnitude of effect size findings using standard criteria as follows: standardized mean difference: small = 0.20, medium = 0.50, large = 0.80; correlation coefficient: small = 0.10, medium = 0.24, large = 0.37 (Ellis, 2010; Rosenthal and Rosnow, 1984). “Moderate” is used as a synonym for “medium,” and “strong” for “large.” A “small” effect is generally difficult to observe in an individual but may be very important for public health if it concerns a common exposure that affects many children. A “medium” effect is expected to be noticeable to a careful observer (Cohen, 1988). A “large” effect is generally relevant to clinical practice at the level of the individual.\n\nIf a topic is not included in this document, it does not mean the topic is unimportant; rather, it means the evidence found was insufficient to allow firm conclusions. This could be because there were insufficient studies of quality, because no attempt was made to assess publication bias, or because the data available did not support the claims made. After the document was completed, we invited additional colleagues to join as signatories to indicate their support of the document. In what follows, we use the term “evidence-based” to refer to evidence that meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria we used in our literature search. We recognize that other criteria could be applied, such as requiring the absence of severe heterogeneity in meta-analyses or increasing the numbers of research participants.\n\nOverview of Results\n\nOur search strategy generated 208 empirically supported statements about ADHD. For details, see the PRISMA diagram in Supplemental Figure 1. The status of the included statements as empirically supported has been approved by the 80 authors from 27 countries and 6 continents (Supplemental Figure 2). It has been endorsed by 403 people who have read this document and agree with its contents (Supplemental Table 2). summarizes our findings along with the item numbers that support each statement. A limitation of this consensus statement is that we do not report well-established research findings for which meta-analyses or very large studies do not exist. The absence of such a study, is not always an indication of knowledge of absence of an effect.\n\nTable 1:\n\nFindingsItemsThe syndrome we now call ADHD has been described in the medical literature since 1775.1 – 13When made by a licensed clinician, the diagnosis of ADHD is well-defined and valid at all ages, even in the presence of other psychiatric disorders, which is common.14–19ADHD is more common in males and occurs in 5.9% of youth and 2.5% of adults. It has been found in studies from Europe, Scandinavia, Australia, Asia, the Middle East, South America, and North America.20–25ADHD is rarely caused by a single genetic or environmental risk factor but most cases of ADHD are caused by the combined effects of many genetic and environmental risks each having a very small effect.26–62People with ADHD often show impaired performance on psychological tests of brain functioning, but these tests cannot be used to diagnose ADHD.63–70Neuroimaging studies find small differences in the structure and functioning of the brain between people with and without ADHD. These differences cannot be used to diagnose ADHD.71–77People with ADHD are at increased risk for obesity, asthma, allergies, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep problems, psoriasis, epilepsy, sexually transmitted infections, abnormalities of the eye, immune disorders, and metabolic disorders.78–100People with ADHD are at increased risk for low quality of life, substance use disorders, accidental injuries, educational underachievement, unemployment, gambling, teenage pregnancy, difficulties socializing, delinquency, suicide, and premature death.101–136Studies of economic burden show that ADHD costs society hundreds of billions of dollars each year, worldwide.137–147Regulatory agencies around the world have determined that several medications are safe and effective for reducing the symptoms of ADHD as shown by randomized controlled clinical trials.148–157Treatment with ADHD medications reduces accidental injuries, traumatic brain injury, substance abuse, cigarette smoking, educational underachievement, bone fractures, sexually transmitted infections, depression, suicide, criminal activity and teenage pregnancy.158–177The adverse effects of medications for ADHD are typically mild and can be addressed by changing the dose or the medication.178–188The stimulant medications for ADHD are more effective than non-stimulant medications but are also more likely to be diverted, misused, and abused.189–194Non-medication treatments for ADHD are less effective than medication treatments for ADHD symptoms, but are frequently useful to help problems that remain after medication has been optimized.195–208\n\nA Brief History: ADHD is not a New Disorder\n\nThe concept of ADHD has a long history, starting with clinical reports from European countries. The clinical significance of the signs and symptoms of the disorder has been recognized for over two centuries. Although these early reports did not use the term “ADHD”, they described children who showed the symptoms and impairments we now recognize as ADHD. For a detailed history see (Lange et al., 2010; Taylor, 2011; Weikard, 1799). Here are highlights from the early history of ADHD:\n\n1775: Melchior Adam Weikard, a German physician, wrote the first textbook description of a disorder with the hallmarks of ADHD.\n\n1798: Alexander Crichton from the Royal College of Physicians (United Kingdom) described a similar disorder in a medical textbook (Palmer and Finger, 2001).\n\n1845: Heinrich Hoffmann, who later became head of the first psychiatric hospital in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, described hyperactivity and attention deficits in a children’s book which documented ADHD-like behaviors and their associated impairments (Hoffmann, 1990).\n\n1887–1901: Désiré-Magloire Bourneville, Charles Boulanger, Georges Paul-Boncour, and Jean Philippe described an equivalent of ADHD in French medical and educational writings (Martinez-Badia and Martinez-Raga, 2015).\n\n1902: George Still, a physician in the United Kingdom, wrote the first description of the disorder in a scientific journal (Still, 1902a; Still, 1902b, c).\n\n1907: Augusto Vidal Perera wrote the first Spanish compendium of child psychiatry. He described the impact of inattention and hyperactivity among schoolchildren (Vidal Perera, 1907).\n\n1917: the Spanish neurologist and psychiatrist Gonzalo Rodriguez-Lafora described symptoms of ADHD in children and said they were probably caused by a brain disorder with genetic origins (Lafora, 1917).\n\n1932: Franz Kramer and Hans Pollnow, from Germany, described an ADHD-like syndrome and coined the term “hyperkinetic disorder”, which was later adopted as a term by the World Health Organization (Kramer and Pollnow, 1932; Neumarker, 2005).\n\n1937: Charles Bradley, from the USA, discovered that an amphetamine medication reduced ADHD-like symptoms (Bradley, 1937).\n\n1940s: ADHD-like symptoms in children described as “minimal brain dysfunction”.\n\n1956–1958: First hint in follow-up study of the persistence of minimal brain dysfunction-related behaviors into adulthood (Morris et al., 1956; O’Neal and Robins, 1958)\n\n1960s: U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved methylphenidate (Ritalin) for behavioral disorders in children.\n\n1970s to today: Diagnostic criteria for ADHD evolved based on research showing that the diagnosis predicts treatment response, clinical course, and family history of the disorder.\n\nHow is ADHD diagnosed?\n\nADHD can only be diagnosed by a licensed clinician who interviews the parent or caregiver and/or patient to document criteria for the disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Chinese Society of Psychiatry, 2001; Faraone et al., 2015; Feldman and Reiff, 2014; Pearl et al., 2001; Stein, 2008; World Health Organization, 2018). It cannot be diagnosed by rating scales alone, neuropsychological tests, or methods for imaging the brain.\n\nThe diagnosis of ADHD has been criticized as being subjective because it is not based on a biological test. This criticism is unfounded. ADHD meets standard criteria for validity of a mental disorder established by Robins and Guze (Faraone, 2005; 1970). The disorder is considered valid because: 1) well-trained professionals in a variety of settings and cultures agree on its presence or absence using well-defined criteria and 2) the diagnosis is useful for predicting a) additional problems the patient may have (e.g., difficulties learning in school); b) future patient outcomes (e.g., risk for future drug abuse); c) response to treatment (e.g., medications and psychological treatments); and d) features that indicate a consistent set of causes for the disorder (e.g., findings from genetics or brain imaging) (Faraone, 2005). Professional associations have endorsed and published guidelines for diagnosing ADHD (Alliance, 2011; Banaschewski T, 2018; Bolea-Alamanac et al., 2014; Crunelle et al., 2018; Flisher, 2013; Graham et al., 2011; Kooij et al., 2019; National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2018; National Institute for Health Care and Excellence, 2018; Pliszka, 2007; Schoeman and Liebenberg, 2017; Seixas et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2004; Wolraich et al., 2011).\n\nThe main features of the diagnosis are:\n\nThe diagnosis requires: 1) the presence of developmentally inappropriate levels of hyperactive-impulsive and/or inattentive symptoms for at least 6 months; 2) symptoms occurring in different settings (e.g., home and school); 3) symptoms that cause impairments in living; 4) some of the symptoms and impairments first occurred in early to mid-childhood; and 4) no other disorder better explains the symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; World Health Organization, 2018; Yi and Jing, 2015).\n\nThe clinical presentation of ADHD can be described as primarily inattentive, primarily hyperactive-impulsive, or combined, depending on the nature of their symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Meta-analyses indicate that inattention is more strongly associated with academic impairment, low self-esteem, negative occupational outcomes and lower overall adaptive functioning. Hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are associated with peer rejection, aggression, risky driving behaviors and accidental injuries. Patterns of associated disorders also differ between the dimensions (Willcutt et al., 2012).\n\nADHD impairs the functioning of highly intelligent people, so the disorder can be diagnosed in this group. A population-based birth cohort study of over 5,700 children found no significant differences among children with high, average, or low IQ and ADHD in median age at which ADHD criteria were met, rates of learning disorders, psychiatric disorders, and substance abuse, and rates of stimulant treatment (Katusic et al., 2011; Rommelse et al., 2017).\n\nIn adolescence and young adulthood, many individuals with a history of childhood ADHD continue to be impaired by the disorder, although they often show reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity while retaining symptoms of inattention (Faraone et al., 2006).\n\nMany large epidemiologic and clinical studies show that ADHD often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, especially depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, eating disorders, and substance use disorders (Bernardi et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2018c; Groenman et al., 2017; Nazar et al., 2016; Solberg et al., 2018; Tung et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2019). Their presence does not rule out a diagnosis of ADHD.\n\nA meta-analysis comprising 25 studies with over eight million participants found that children and adolescents who are relatively younger than their classmates are more likely to have been diagnosed with ADHD (Caye et al., 2020)\n\nHow Common is ADHD?\n\nADHD occurs throughout the developed and developing world and is more common in males compared with females. It has not become more common over the past three decades although due to increased recognition by clinicians, the disorder is more likely to be diagnosed today than in prior decades.\n\nA meta-analysis of 19 studies with over 55,000 participants found that 5.9% of youths meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD (Willcutt, 2012). Another meta-analysis, with 135 studies and about a quarter of a million youths, found no significant differences in prevalence between North America and Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and Oceania (Polanczyk et al., 2014).\n\nThe latter meta-analysis found no increase in the prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents over the past three decades (Polanczyk et al., 2014). Although the prevalence of ADHD has not changed in this time period, large studies from the US and Sweden indicate that ADHD is more likely to have been diagnosed in recent years, which reflects changes in administrative and clinical practices (Rydell et al., 2018; Song et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018).\n\nA meta-analysis of six studies with over 5,300 participants estimated the prevalence of ADHD in adulthood to be 2.5% (Simon et al., 2009). A meta-analysis of 20 studies encompassing 13 countries and seven regions/metropolitan areas, involving more than 26,000 participants, estimated that 2.8% of adults meet criteria for ADHD (Fayyad et al., 2017). The lower prevalence in adults compared with youth is consistent with a meta-analysis of 21 studies with over 1,600 participants showing that only about one in six youths with ADHD still meet full diagnostic criteria for ADHD at age 25, and about half show signs of residual impairment (Faraone et al., 2006).\n\nA meta-analysis of nine studies with a total of over 32,000 older adults found a prevalence of 2.2% based on ADHD rating scales, dropping to 1.5% when limited to persons at least fifty years old. Yet a meta-analysis of seven studies with over 11.7 million participants based on ADHD clinical diagnoses, performed by the same team, reported a prevalence of only 0.2% for persons at least fifty years old. A third meta-analysis performed by the same researchers, of four studies with over 9.2 million participants, found an ADHD treatment rate of only 0.02% among persons at least fifty years old (Dobrosavljevic et al., 2020).\n\nA meta-analysis of 19 studies encompassing over 150,000 U.S. Black youths under 18 years old reported an ADHD prevalence rate of 14 percent. The authors concluded, “Black individuals are at higher risk for ADHD diagnoses than the general US population. These results highlight a need to increase ADHD assessment and monitoring among Black individuals from different social backgrounds” (Cénat et al., 2020).\n\nADHD is more common in males. A meta-analysis of parent ratings of symptoms in 29 studies with over 42,000 participants, and teacher ratings in 24 studies with over 56,000 participants, found a roughly two-to-one male/female ratio in youth (Willcutt, 2012).\n\nWhat causes ADHD?\n\nFor most people with ADHD, many genetic and environmental risk factors accumulate to cause the disorder (Faraone et al., 2015). The environmental risks for ADHD exert their effects very early in life, during the fetal or early postnatal period. In rare cases, however, ADHD-like symptoms can be caused by extreme deprivation early in life (Kennedy et al., 2016), a single genetic abnormality (Faraone and Larsson, 2018), or traumatic brain injury early in life (Stojanovski et al., 2019). These findings are helpful to understand the causes of ADHD but are not useful for diagnosing the disorder. The associations between aspects of the environment and the onset of ADHD have attained a very high level of evidential support. Some have strong evidence for a causal role but, for most, the possibility remains that these associations are due to correlated genetic and environmental effects. For this reason, we refer to features of the pre- and post-natal environments that increase risk for ADHD as correlates, rather than causes. The genetic and environmental risks described below are not necessarily specific to ADHD.\n\nGenetic Causes of ADHD\n\nA review of 37 twin studies from the United States, Europe, Scandinavia, and Australia found that genes and their interaction with the environment must play a substantial role in causing ADHD (Faraone and Larsson, 2018; Larsson et al., 2014a; Pettersson et al., 2019).\n\nIn a genomewide study, an international team analyzed DNA from over 20,000 people with ADHD and over 35,000 without ADHD from the United States, Europe, Scandinavia, China, and Australia. They identified many genetic risk variants, each having a small effect on the risk for the disorder (Demontis et al., 2019). This study confirmed a polygenic cause for most cases of ADHD, meaning that many genetic variants, each having a very small effect, combine to increase risk for the disorder. The polygenic risk for ADHD is associated with general psychopathology (Brikell et al., 2020) and several psychiatric disorders (Lee PH, 2019).\n\nAdditional genes have been implicated by meta-analyses, but their status as risk genes remains uncertain until validated in a genomewide study. These genes are ANKK1 (Pan et al., 2015) DAT1 (Grunblatt et al., 2019b), LRP5 and LRP6 (Grunblatt et al., 2019a), SNAP25 (Liu et al., 2017b), ADGRL3 (Bruxel et al., 2020) DRD4 and BAIAP2 (Bonvicini et al., 2020; Bonvicini et al., 2016).\n\nThe polygenic risk for ADHD predicts ADHD symptoms in the population suggesting that the genetic causes of ADHD as a disorder, also influence lower levels of ADHD symptoms in the population (Demontis et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2019).\n\nIn the population, those with a high polygenic risk for ADHD are more likely to have been diagnosed with ADHD (Li, 2019), anxiety or depression (Martin et al., 2018).\n\nADHD can also be the result of rare single gene defects (Faraone and Larsson, 2018) or abnormalities of the chromosomes (Cederlof et al., 2014). When the DNA of 8,000+ children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or ADHD and 5,000 controls was analyzed, those with ASD and those with ADHD had an increased rate of rare genetic mutations compared with controls (Satterstrom et al., 2019).\n\nFamily, twin, and DNA studies show that genetic and environmental influences are partially shared between ADHD and many other psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, conduct disorder, eating disorders, and substance use disorders) and with somatic disorders (e.g. migraine and obesity) (Demontis et al., 2019) (Faraone and Larsson, 2018) (Ghirardi et al., 2018) (Lee et al., 2019) (Lee et al., 2013) (Anttila et al., 2018; Tylee et al., 2018) (van Hulzen et al., 2017) (Vink and Schellekens, 2018) (Brikell et al., 2018) (Chen et al., 2019a) (Yao et al., 2019). However, there is also a unique genetic risk for ADHD. Evidence of shared genetic and environmental risks among disorders suggest that these disorders also share a pathophysiology in the biological pathways that dysregulate neurodevelopment and create brain variations leading to disorder onset.\n\nVery large studies of families suggest that ADHD shares genetic or familial causes with autoimmune diseases (Li et al., 2019), hypospadias (Butwicka et al., 2015), and intellectual disability (Faraone and Larsson, 2018).\n\nEnvironmental Correlates of ADHD: Exposure to Toxicants\n\nA pair of meta-analyses found small correlations between lead burden and inattention symptoms (27 studies, over 9,300 youths) and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms (23 studies, over 7,800 youths) (Goodlad et al., 2013). A more recent meta-analysis of 14 studies with over 17,000 children reported that higher blood lead levels were associated with quadrupled odds of ADHD (Nilsen and Tulve, 2020). A study of over 2,500 youths from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, found that those with blood lead levels in the top third were 2.3 times more likely to have ADHD compared with those in the bottom third (Froehlich et al., 2009). A similar study, with over 4,700 youths from the same national survey, found that those with blood lead levels in the highest fifth were four times more likely to have ADHD compared with those in the bottom fifth (Braun et al., 2006).\n\nThree meta-analyses with over twenty studies covering more than three million persons have found prenatal exposure to maternal smoking associated with a greater than 50% increase in incidence of ADHD (Huang et al., 2017) (Dong et al., 2018; Nilsen and Tulve, 2020). Although this association has also been seen in large population studies (Joelsson et al., 2016; Obel et al., 2016; Skoglund et al., 2014), it disappears after adjusting for family history of ADHD which indicates that the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and ADHD is due to familial or genetic factors that increase the risk for both smoking and ADHD.\n\nA meta-analysis of nine studies spanning three continents and over 100,000 participants found that childhood exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke was associated with a 60% greater likelihood of ADHD. It was unclear to what extent the association was causal versus due to confounders (Huang et al., 2020).\n\nIn a meta-analysis of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with 219 participants, artificial food dyes were associated with a small increase in hyperactivity in children (Schab and Trinh, 2004). Another meta-analysis, covering 20 studies with a combined total of 794 individuals, found a very small increase in ADHD symptoms, but only when rated by parents, not by teachers or other observers (Nigg et al., 2012).\n\nIn a Taiwanese study of over 10,000 births, maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was associated with a 33% greater likelihood of ADHD in their children (Chen et al., 2019b). Another study, examining 113,000 offspring from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and the Norwegian Patient Registry, including 2,246 with ADHD, found a dose-response relationship between maternal prenatal use of acetaminophen and ADHD (Ystrom et al., 2017).\n\nA nationwide study using the Danish national registers looked at 913,000 children born between 1997 and 2011. Prenatal exposure to the anti-epileptic drug valproate was associated with a 50% greater risk of ADHD. No associations were found for other anti-epileptic drugs (Christensen et al., 2019).\n\nIn a Norwegian registry study, 297 children with ADHD and 553 controls were randomly sampled from an eligible population of over 24,000. Children of mothers in the highest quintile of phthalate metabolite levels were three times more likely to have had ADHD as children compared with those in the bottom quintile, after adjusting for confounders, such as maternal age at delivery, sex of the child, maternal education, marital status, and prenatal maternal smoking (Engel et al., 2018).\n\nOrganophosphate pesticides are potent neurotoxins. In a sample of 1,139 children from the U.S. population, a tenfold increase in the organophosphate metabolite dimethyl alkylphosphate (DMAP) was associated with 55% increase in the probability of having ADHD. Children with detectable levels of the most-commonly detected DMAP metabolite were twice as likely to have ADHD compared with those with undetectable levels (Bouchard et al., 2010).\n\nA meta-analysis found no significant effect of three classes of air pollutants –particulate matter (six studies, over 51,000 persons) and nitrogen oxides (five studies, over 51,000 persons) (Zhang et al., 2020b). A Taiwan-wide longitudinal cohort study geolinking over 16,000 mother-infant pairs to levels of air pollutants found no association between small particulate matter levels, sulphur dioxide levels, or nitrogen dioxide levels during gestation and ADHD diagnoses in the first eight years of their offsprings’ lives. It did find a 25 percent greater odds for having ADHD with exposures to nitric oxide, a common traffic pollutant (Shih et al., 2020).\n\nA nationwide cohort study used the South Korean national health insurance registry to identify all 7,200 hospital admissions of adolescents with a primary diagnosis of ADHD from 2013 to 2015, and daily readings of three air pollutants from 318 monitoring stations distributed across the country over the same period. It found that spikes in nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter were associated, respectively, with 47%, 27%, and 12% increases in ADHD related hospital admissions in succeeding days. There were no significant differences between male and female adolescents, or between older and younger adolescents (Park et al., 2020).\n\nA meta-analysis of nine European population studies encompassing 4,826 mother-child pairs examined the relationship between exposure to Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) via breast milk in infancy and development of ADHD. No associations were found with ADHD in offspring (Forns et al., 2020).\n\nA meta-analysis of seven studies encompassing a total of over 25,000 participants from six countries on three continents found no evidence of an association between sugar consumption and ADHD in youth (Farsad-Naeimi et al., 2020)\n\nEnvironmental Correlates of ADHD: Nutrient Deficiencies\n\nA pair of meta-analyses found no difference in serum iron levels in youths with ADHD (six studies, 617 participants) but small-to-moderate reductions in serum ferritin, a protein that stores iron (ten studies, over 2,100 participants) (Wang et al., 2017). Another pair of meta-analyses likewise found no difference in serum iron levels (six studies, over 1,700 participants) but small-to-moderate reductions in serum ferritin (12 studies, over 6,000 participants) (Tseng et al., 2018).\n\nA meta-analysis of nine studies and 586 people found moderately lower overall blood levels of omega-3 PUFAs in ADHD than non-ADHD youth (Hawkey and Nigg, 2014).\n\nA nationwide population-based case-control study using the Finnish national registers compared 1,067 patients with ADHD born between 1998 and 1999 with 1,067 matched controls. Lower maternal vitamin D levels were associated with a roughly 50% greater likelihood of ADHD in their children (Sucksdorff et al., 2019).\n\nEnvironmental Correlates of ADHD: Events During Pregnancy and Birth\n\nA meta-analysis of twelve studies with over 6,000 participants found a threefold increase in the rate of ADHD among very/extremely preterm or very/extremely low birth weight babies (Franz et al., 2018). Another meta-analysis, combining 85 studies with a total of over 4.6 million births, found a small-to-moderate correlation between low birth weight and ADHD (Momany et al., 2018). A Swedish national register study of 1.2 million children found a stepwise increase in the likelihood of ADHD with increasing prematurity. Results were not due to having an ADHD relative or socioeconomic stress (Lindstrom et al., 2011). Similar results were reported from the Finnish national registers when comparing over 10,000 people with ADHD with over 38,000 controls (Sucksdorff et al., 2015).\n\nA meta-analysis of six studies combining 1.4 million people found that children whose mothers had hypertensive disorders during pregnancy had a 25% increase in the rate of ADHD (Maher et al., 2018).\n\nA nationwide population-based cohort study using Swedish registers and covering more than two million children, 115,000 of them with ADHD, found that maternal preeclampsia during pregnancy is associated with a 15% greater subsequent likelihood of ADHD in offspring, rising to over 40% when the fetus is small for gestational age and exposed to preeclampsia. This pattern in families showed that it is not due to genetic or other family influences (Maher et al., 2020).\n\nTwo meta-analyses, one with seven studies with over 28,000 participants and another with three studies and over 1.4 million participants, found that children of obese mothers were roughly 60% more likely to develop ADHD (Jenabi et al., 2019; Sanchez et al., 2018). A study of over 80,000 mother-child pairs participating in the Danish National Birth Cohort reported an almost 50% elevated risk of ADHD in children of obese mothers and a doubled risk in children of severely obese mothers (Andersen et al., 2018).\n\nA meta-analysis of two large cohort studies with a combined total of over 3.1 million persons found a slight but significant association between maternal hyperthyroidism during pregnancy and ADHD in offspring. A second meta-analysis of four cohort studies encompassing over 3.4 million participants likewise found a slight but significant association between maternal hypothyroidism and ADHD in offspring. No attempt was made to assess the role of confounders (Ge et al., 2020).\n\nA nationwide cohort study using Danish national registers examined over a million births, comparing offspring of mothers with a single prior miscarriage and mothers with more than one prior miscarriage with mothers with no history of miscarriage. It found that after adjusting for a wide range of possible confounders which turned out to have little effect, children of mothers with a single prior miscarriage were 9% more likely to develop ADHD than those of mothers without any miscarriage. Children of mothers with two or more prior miscarriages were 22% more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. This upward exposure-response trend was statistically significant (Wang et al., 2020).\n\nEnvironmental Correlates of ADHD: Deprivation, Stress, Infection, Poverty and Trauma\n\nA Taiwan-wide longitudinal cohort study based on the country’s universal coverage National Health Insurance Research Database compared over 14,000 enterovirus patients (ER71) with an equal number of controls matched by age and sex. After further adjusting for paternal occupation and urbanization level of residence it found the enterovirus patients were 25 percent more likely to subsequently be diagnosed with ADHD (Tseng et al., 2020).\n\nA nationwide population-based cohort study using Danish registers compared over 29,000 children born to women who lost a close relative during pregnancy with a million other children in the same cohort and found that boys born to these women were twice as likely to have ADHD (Li et al., 2010).\n\nA U.S. population-based study of over 14,000 participants in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health found that after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and familial risk factors for child maltreatment, ADHD inattentive type was associated with having been exposed to sexual abuse and physical neglect (Ouyang et al., 2008).\n\nA nationwide population-based cohort study of over 18,000 children from the South Korean National Health Insurance database found that lower levels of family income were associated with increased rates of ADHD (Choi et al., 2017). A Swedish study of over 800,000 people reported similar results even after adjusting for shared familial/genetic risk factors in families (Larsson et al., 2014b).\n\nA Danish national register longitudinal cohort study of a million people found that Rutter’s indicators of adversity were predictive of ADHD. Out-of-home care was strongly predictive; low social class, paternal criminality, maternal mental disorder, and severe marital discord were moderately predictive. Large family size had no effect (Ostergaard et al., 2016).\n\nA countrywide population study using Danish national registers looked at over 630,000 youths and found dose-response relationships between lower parental educational attainment, parental unemployment, and parental relative poverty and higher risk of ADHD in offspring. Combinations of social disadvantages had cumulative risks. For instance, parental relative income poverty plus completion of no more than compulsory education plus unemployment was associated with a roughly five percent higher risk of ADHD in their offspring (Keilow et al., 2020).\n\nA Swedish national register cohort study of over 540,000 people found a dose-response relationship between cumulative indicators of adversity in the family and ADHD. A death in the family increased the subsequent likelihood of ADHD by 60%. Substantial parental substance abuse, criminality, or psychiatric disorder each more than doubled the likelihood as did residential instability and household public assistance (Bjorkenstam et al., 2018).\n\nIn a sample of 4,122 U.S. youths with ADHD from the 2016 U.S. National Survey of Children’s Health, greater family cohesion and community support decreased the risk for moderate to severe ADHD (Duh-Leong et al., 2020).\n\nWhat Have We Learned from Studying the Brains of People with ADHD?\n\nThere are two broad classes of research findings about the brains of people with ADHD. The first comes from studies of the performance of patients on psychological tests that study mental processes. The second comes from methods that directly examine brain structure or function with neuroimaging scans. Although many of these studies have found differences between groups of people who are and are not diagnosed with ADHD, the differences are typically small and do not dramatically differ between people with ADHD and those with other disorders. They are, therefore, not useful for diagnosing the disorder (Thome et al., 2012). These differences are not caused by drug treatment and, for some patients, diminish or change as patients grow out of the disorder.\n\nPerformance Deficits in Psychological Processes\n\nA meta-analysis of 137 studies with over 9,400 participants of all ages found ADHD to be associated with moderately lower IQ and reading scores and larger decreases in spelling and arithmetic scores (Frazier et al., 2004). Another meta-analysis, spanning 21 studies with over 1,900 adults, concluded that ADHD-associated IQ deficits were small and not clinically meaningful (Bridgett and Walker, 2006).\n\nA series of meta-analyses found that people with ADHD had small to moderate difficulties with abstract problem solving and working memory (12 studies, 952 persons), focused attention (22 studies, 1,493 persons), sustained attention (13 studies, 963 persons), and verbal memory (8 studies, 546 persons) (Schoechlin and Engel, 2005). Another meta-analysis, with 11 studies with 829 participants, reported people with ADHD were moderately more prone to cognitive errors known as “rule violations” (Patros et al., 2019).\n\nTwo meta-analyses, one with 21 studies and over 3,900 participants, the other with 15 studies with over a thousand participants, found that those diagnosed with ADHD have a moderate tendency to favor small immediate rewards over large delayed rewards (Jackson and MacKillop, 2016; Marx et al., 2018).\n\nA meta-analysis of 37 studies with more than 2,300 participants found a small-to-moderate association between ADHD and risky decision-making (Dekkers et al., 2016). Another meta-analysis, combining 22 studies with 3,850 children and adolescents, found those with ADHD exhibited moderately greater impulsive decision-making overall on delay discounting and delay of gratification tasks (Patros et al., 2016).\n\nA recent meta-meta-analysis included 34 meta-analyses of neurocognitive profiles in ADHD (all ages) concerning 12 neurocognitive domains. Those with ADHD had moderate impairments in multiple domains (working memory, reaction time variability, response inhibition, intelligence/achievement, planning/organization). Effects were larger in children and adolescents than in adults (Pievsky and McGrath, 2018).\n\nA meta-analysis of 49 studies and over 8,200 children and adolescents found moderate impairments in working memory in those with ADHD. These deficits declined with age (Ramos et al., 2020).\n\nAmong youths with ADHD, a series of meta-analyses found no significant sex differences in either total ADHD symptoms (15, studies, over 3,400 youths), inattention symptoms (26 studies, over 5,900 youths), or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms (24 studies, over 4,900 youths) (Loyer Carbonneau et al., 2020).\n\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with preschoolers found that cognitive training led to moderate improvement in working memory (23 studies, over 2,000 participants) and small-to-moderate improvement in inhibitory control (26 studies, over 2,200 participants) (Pauli-Pott et al., 2020).\n\nDifferences in the Brain Found by Neuroimaging Studies\n\nAn analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 36 cohorts with a total of over 4,100 participants found slightly reduced total cortical surface area in children with ADHD. The same team found some subcortical regions of the brain were smaller in children with ADHD, mainly in frontal, cingulate and temporal regions with some reductions in cortical thickness in temporal regions. The same team found some subcortical regions of the brain, i.e., basal ganglia, amygdala, hippocampus and intracranial volumes were smaller in children with ADHD in 23 cohorts of 3,242 participants. The differences seen in children were not seen in adolescents or adults (Hoogman et al., 2017; Hoogman et al., 2019). All of the differences observed were small to very small and subtle.\n\nComparative meta-analyses show that structural grey matter volume reductions in basal ganglia and insula are disorder-specific relative to OCD in 30 data sets with 1,870 participants (Norman et al., 2016) while medial frontal reductions were specific to ASD in 66 data sets with 3,610 participants (Lukito et al., 2020). An analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 48 cohorts with a total of over 12,000 participants showed that ADHD participants had smaller hippocampus volume relative to OCD which was related to IQ differences and smaller intracranial volume relative to ASD and OCD patients (Boedhoe et al., 2020). The functional under-activations in right inferior frontal cortex and basal ganglia during tasks of cognitive control were disorder-specific relative to OCD in 1,870 participants (Norman et al., 2016), while the inferior frontal dysfunction was specific relative to autism in 3,610 participants (Lukito et al., 2020).\n\nA meta-analysis of ten diffusion tensor imaging studies with 947 participants found that the most consistent white matter differences between those with and without ADHD were located in the splenium of the corpus callosum extending to the right cingulum, the right sagittal stratum, and left tapetum, suggesting problems with the connections between the two hemispheres in posterior parieto-temporal attention regions and in long-range fronto-posterior association tracts (connecting inferior frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital regions) involved in attention and perception (Chen et al., 2016).\n\nA meta-analysis of 21 functional MRI studies with 607 participants found that those with ADHD showed consistent and replicable under-activation in typical regions of inhibitory control such as right inferior frontal cortex, supplementary motor area and the basal ganglia relative to typically developing individuals (Hart et al., 2013). The inferior frontal under-activation findings were replicated in two further fMRI meta-analyses of inhibitory control with 33 datasets/1,161 participants, and 42 datasets/2,005 participants, respectively (Lukito et al., 2020; Norman et al., 2016). Another meta-analysis including 130 fMRI studies with 1,914 participants found no convergence except for aberrant function in basal ganglia for neutral fMRI tasks and inferior frontal under-function in males only (Samea et al., 2019).\n\nA meta-analysis of nine studies with over 1,250 research participants found that elevations in the theta/beta on the electroencephalogram cannot be considered a reliable diagnostic measure for ADHD although it may have prognostic value in some patients (Arns et al., 2013).\n\nA meta-analysis of six studies with 148 participants examined mismatch negativity, which assesses the integrity of auditory sensory memory and involuntary attention switching. It reported that ADHD children had small-to-moderate reductions in mismatch negativity amplitude compared with healthy controls (Cheng et al., 2016).\n\nMeta-analyses and systematic reviews showed that the medications used to treat ADHD are not associated with observed deficits in brain structure (Hoogman et al., 2017; Hoogman et al., 2019; Lukito et al., 2020; Norman et al., 2016; Spencer et al., 2013), but with improved brain function, most prominently in inferior frontal and striatal regions (Hart et al., 2013; Lukito et al., 2020; Norman et al., 2016; Rubia et al., 2014; Spencer et al., 2013).\n\nWhat kinds of Non-Psychiatric Medical Problems Commonly Occur among People with ADHD?\n\nA relatively new area of research into ADHD is examining what types of medical problems are more common than expected among people with ADHD. As you read this section, keep in mind that not all people with ADHD will suffer from all, or even only one, of these disorders.\n\nObesity\n\nA Swedish national register study of over 2.5 million people found ADHD patients had a threefold greater risk of obesity relative to their non-ADHD siblings and cousins. It also found a familial co-aggregation of ADHD and clinical obesity, the strength of which varied directly with the degree of genetic relatedness (Chen et al., 2018c).\n\nA meta-analysis found that compared with typically developing people, children and adolescents with unmedicated ADHD were about 20% more likely to be overweight or obese (15 studies, over 400,000 participants), and adults with unmedicated ADHD almost 50% more likely to be overweight or obese (9 studies, over 45,000 participants) (Nigg et al., 2016). Meta-analyses of twelve studies with over 180,000 participants found that people with unmedicated ADHD were about 40% more likely to be obese, whereas those who were medicated were indistinguishable from typically developing people (Cortese et al., 2016b).\n\nAllergies and Asthma\n\nA Swedish national register study of over 1.5 million people found that those with asthma were 45% more likely to have ADHD even after adjustment for relevant variables (Cortese et al., 2018b). A cohort study of almost a million births using the Danish national registers found that children born to asthmatic mothers were 40% more likely to develop ADHD (Liu et al., 2019b).\n\nIn a meta-analysis of six longitudinal studies with over 50,000 participants, those with asthma or atopic eczema were a third more likely to have ADHD than controls. A meta-analysis of three studies with over 48,000 participants found that those with allergic rhinitis were about 50% more likely to have ADHD (van der Schans et al., 2017).\n\nDiabetes Mellitus:\n\nA retrospective analysis of over 650,000 children and adolescents in German diagnosis and prescription databases found ADHD was 40% more likely to be diagnosed among children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) (Kapellen et al., 2016).\n\nA German multi-center registry study of over 56,000 children and adolescents found that those with both ADHD and T1DM suffered twice as often from diabetic ketoacidosis compared with diabetic patients without ADHD. They also found significant differences in HbA1c, and concluded, “Pediatric patients with ADHD and T1DM showed poor metabolic control compared with T1DM patients without ADHD” (Hilgard et al., 2017).\n\nA longitudinal study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database enrolled over 35,000 patients with ADHD and over 70,000 age- and sex-matched controls. Adolescents and young adults with ADHD were about three times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (Chen et al., 2018b).\n\nA cohort study using multiple Swedish national registers looked at over 1.6 million adults aged 50 to 64 years. Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 70% greater among adults with ADHD (Chen et al., 2018c).\n\nA meta-analysis found that maternal pre-existing type 1 diabetes was associated with a small increased risk of ADHD in offspring (4 studies, over five million people). So was paternal pre-existing type 1 diabetes (3 studies, 4.7 million people), and maternal pre-existing type 2 diabetes (2 studies, 2.6 million people) (Zeng et al., 2019). A Swedish study looked at all 15,615 children born after their parents were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. After controlling for confounders, it found that these children had a 30% greater chance of being diagnosed with ADHD (Ji et al., 2018).\n\nOther Somatic Disorders:\n\nA meta-analysis of 18 studies with more than 2,500 children and adolescents found a moderate association between sleep-disordered breathing and ADHD (Sedky et al., 2014).\n\nA meta-analysis of sleep in adults with ADHD found no significant differences with normally developing adults, as measured by polysomnography. In four studies with 178 participants, sleep onset latency, stage 1 sleep, stage 2 sleep, slow wave sleep, REM, and sleep efficiency were all comparable. Same with total sleep time (3 studies, 130 persons), and with REM latency and wake after sleep onset (3 studies, 121 persons). As measured by actigraphy, there were no significant differences for time in bed and actual wake time (3 studies, 159 persons), true sleep (4 studies, 222 persons). However, sleep onset latency was much greater for those with ADHD, and sleep efficiency was moderately lower (4 studies, 222 persons). Nevertheless, subjective evaluations by those with ADHD reported moderately greater difficulty in falling asleep (8 studies, over 1,700 persons), moderately greater frequency of night awakenings and moderately lesser likelihood of being rested at wake-up (5 studies, over 1,100 persons), and moderately worse sleep quality (5 studies, over 800 persons)(Lugo et al., 2020).\n\nIn a Norwegian national registry study of over 1.2 million males and over 1.2 million females, males with ADHD were 30% more likely to be diagnosed with psoriasis, and women with ADHD more than 50% more likely to be diagnosed with psoriasis, than normally developing controls (Hegvik et al., 2018).\n\nA Taiwan nationwide population cohort study of over 8,000 people with ADHD and 32,000 matched controls explored associations with autoimmune diseases. It reported that those with ADHD had well over twice the prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and autoimmune thyroid disease, and over 50% greater likelihood of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis (Chen et al., 2017a).\n\nA population-based cohort study of over 900,000 Danish children found that epilepsy was associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk for ADHD (Bertelsen et al., 2016). Another population-based cohort study, of over 12,000 Taiwanese, reported that epilepsy was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk for ADHD. Conversely, a linked cohort study of over 18,000 Taiwanese found ADHD was associated with a fourfold increase in epilepsy (Chou et al., 2013).\n\nA countrywide registry study of 1.9 million Swedes reported that those with epilepsy were three and a half times more likely to have ADHD. The risk of having ADHD was 85% greater if the person’s mother had epilepsy, 50–60% greater if the father or a brother or sister did, 15% greater for cousins. Genetics explained 40% of the variance, with non-shared environmental factors explaining another 50% (Brikell et al., 2018).\n\nA longitudinal study using the Taiwan Health Insurance Research Database compared almost 18,000 adolescents and young adults with ADHD with over 70,000 age- and sex-matched controls. Those with ADHD were over three times more likely to develop sexually transmitted infections, after adjusting for demographic data, other psychiatric disorders, and ADHD medications (Chen et al., 2018a).\n\nA Danish national register cohort study of 1.1 million people found that hospitalization for serious infections was associated with a subsequent doubling in the rate of ADHD diagnosis. Among those treated with anti-infective agents, the risk of subsequent diagnosis with ADHD was halved (Kohler-Forsberg et al., 2019).\n\nA Danish national register study of almost a million people found that children with autoimmune disease were 24% more likely to develop ADHD. Maternal autoimmune disease was associated with a 12% greater likelihood of ADHD in their offspring. Paternal autoimmune disease was not associated with any significant effect (Nielsen et al., 2017).\n\nUsing Taiwan’s nationwide population-based dataset, over 116,000 children with ADHD were compared with the same number of randomly selected children without ADHD. Those with ADHD were much more likely to have significant abnormalities of the eye: almost 90% more likely to have amblyopia (“lazy eye”), over 80% more likely to have astigmatism, and twice as likely to have heterotropia, in which the eyes diverge at rest (Ho et al., 2020). A study using the same database matched 6,817 youths diagnosed with amblyopia to over 27,000 age- and sex-matched controls. Those in the amblyopia group had 1.8 times the risk of developing ADHD (Su et al., 2019).\n\nIn a study of over 2.5 million German youth, those with ADHD were nine times more likely to have metabolic disorders, five times more likely to develop viral pneumonia, four times more likely to have white blood cell disorders, three times more likely to have kidney failure, high blood pressure, or be obese, two and a half times more likely to have type 2 diabetes or migraines, twice as likely to have asthma or atopic dermatitis, and 50% more likely to have glaucoma (Akmatov et al., 2019). A Brazilian population-based study including 5,671 children found those with migraine about four times more likely to have ADHD (Arruda et al., 2020).\n\nA study of over 59,000 boys diagnosed with ADHD and over 52,000 healthy boys in Taiwan reported that those in the ADHD group were twice as likely to develop testicular dysfunction (Wang et al., 2019).\n\nA nationwide population cohort study using the Swedish national registers compared over 19,000 children with a diagnosis of biopsy-verified celiac disease with over 95,000 matched child controls. It found a subsequent 29% increased risk of ADHD in the celiac patients, rising to 39% when restricting to adult diagnoses of ADHD. However, when comparing 13,000 children diagnosed with celiac disease to their 18,000 non-celiac siblings, the increases became nonsignificant, suggesting the increases were primarily attributable to confounders (Lebwohl et al., 2020).\n\nA Swedish nationwide study using national registers examined medical records of all individuals aged 18 to 64 years who were residing in Sweden during 2013 and identified 41,840 who filled at least one prescription for ADHD medicines. Young adults with ADHD were four times more likely to have somatic co-prescriptions and fifteen times more likely to have psychotropic co-prescriptions than normally developing controls. For middle-aged adults (30–49) the odds were six and 21 times greater, respectively, and for older adults, seven and 18 times greater. Respiratory medications (primarily for allergies reactions and asthma) were the most likely to be dispensed for somatic purposes, followed by alimentary tract and metabolic medications (most frequently proton pump inhibitors indicated for gastric/duodenal ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease), then cardiovascular system medications (primarily for hypertension and arrhythmias) (Zhang et al., 2020a).\n\nWhat is the Impact of ADHD on Patients and Families?\n\nADHD is a disorder associated with serious distress and/or impairments in living. Although, as documented below, many severe adverse outcomes have been associated with ADHD, the typical patient does not experience all, or even most, of these problems. Many patients live enjoyable and productive lives, especially if they receive treatment.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nA meta-analysis of seven studies with over 5,000 youths and their parents reported large impairments in the quality of life of youths with ADHD relative to typically developing peers, regardless of whether evaluated by the youths themselves or by their parents. Physical functioning was only moderately impaired, but emotional functioning and social functioning was strongly impaired. School functioning was strongly impaired. As youths with ADHD grew older, their quality of life compared with typically developing peers grew worse in physical, emotional, and school domains. (Lee et al., 2016).\n\nA meta-analysis of 17 studies encompassing 647 families (over 2,300 participants) evaluated the quality of life of parents whose children had ADHD relative to parents with typically developing children. Parents of the former reported a moderate deficit in quality of life relative to parents of the latter (Dey et al., 2019).\n\nEmotional and Social Impairment\n\nA study of over 8,600 youths from the US National Health Interview Survey found that those with ADHD were six times as likely to have a high level of emotional, conduct, and peer problems, and nine times as likely to manifest a high level of impairment including interference with home life, friendships, classroom learning, and leisure activities (Strine et al., 2006).\n\nA meta-analysis of 22 studies with over 21,000 participants found that youth with ADHD were strongly impaired in the ability to modulate their reactivity to novel or stressful events (Graziano and Garcia, 2016). Another meta-analysis, combining twelve studies with over 1,900 participants, found that adults with ADHD had very elevated levels of emotional dysregulation compared with normally developing controls (Beheshti et al., 2020).\n\nA meta-analysis found that children with ADHD had medium-to-large impairments in socializing with peers as measured by rejection/likability, popularity, and friendships (61 studies, over 24,000 children). They also had moderate impairments in social skills such as sharing, cooperating, turn-taking, reciprocity (68 studies, over 148,000 children), and social-information processing, such as recognizing social cues, identifying problems, generating solutions, and avoiding biases (23 studies, over 3,750 children) (Ros and Graziano, 2018).\n\nA study of over 53,000 U.S. children from the National Survey of Children’s Health found that those with ADHD were 2.4 times as likely to engage in bullying (Montes and Halterman, 2007). A more recent study of some 64,000 children using the same database confirmed this finding, reporting that those with ADHD were 2.8 times more likely to engage in bullying (Benedict et al., 2015).\n\nAccidental Injuries\n\nA nationwide cohort study of over 50,000 youths with ADHD and an equal number of age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched controls drawn from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database reported that having ADHD was associated with a more than three-quarters greater likelihood of burn injury. For those under six years old, the risk was doubled. For youths between six and seventeen years old, the increase in risk was about 70 percent. There were no significant differences between boys and girls (Yeh et al., 2020).\n\nA meta-analysis of 32 studies covering more than four million people found that those with ADHD had a 40 to 50% greater risk of accidental physical injuries (Ruiz-Goikoetxea et al., 2018a).\n\nA Swedish national registers study followed 17,408 individuals with ADHD from 2006 to 2009 and found that patients with ADHD had an almost 50% greater risk of serious transport accidents (Chang et al., 2014b).\n\nA U.S. study of over 8,000 high school and collegiate athletes (predominantly male football players) found that those with ADHD were three times as likely to have had three or more reported concussions (Nelson et al., 2016).\n\nA meta-analysis of 16 studies encompassing over 175,000 people estimated that controlling for mileage driven, those with ADHD were 23% more likely to be involved in vehicular crashes (Vaa, 2014).\n\nA retrospective cohort study of over 18,000 New Jersey drivers found that the crash risk for those with ADHD was a third greater than for those without (Curry et al., 2017).\n\nA meta-analysis of five studies, comprising over three thousand patients with minor traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and over nine thousand controls found that those with mTBI were twice as likely to have ADHD than those without mTBI (Adeyemo et al., 2014).\n\nPremature Death and Suicide\n\nA Danish study of almost two million people found ADHD is associated with a small risk for premature death, mostly due to accidents. When ADHD was accompanied by other psychiatric and substance use disorder, the chances of premature death increased (Dalsgaard et al., 2015b).\n\nA cohort study of more than 2.2 million Taiwanese found no increased risk of death from natural-causes associated with ADHD. But people with ADHD had twice the rate of suicide, twice the rate of death by homicide, and a 30% greater rate of death from unintentional injury (Chen et al., 2019c).\n\nUsing nationwide registers in Denmark, a cohort study of 2.9 million people reported a fourfold higher rate of suicide attempts and deaths in patients with ADHD. The risk was over tenfold in those with ADHD plus another psychiatric diagnosis (Fitzgerald et al., 2019).\n\nA meta-analysis found that persons with ADHD attempted suicide at twice the rate of typically developing people (six studies, over 65,000 persons), had over three times the rate of suicidal ideation (23 studies, over 70,000 persons), and over six times the rate of completed suicide (four studies, over 130,000 persons) (Septier et al., 2019).\n\nA Taiwanese study of over 20,000 adolescents and young adults with ADHD and over 61,000 age- and sex-matched non-ADHD individuals found that those with ADHD were almost four times as likely to attempt suicide, and over six times as likely to repeat suicide attempts. Methylphenidate or atomoxetine treatment did not increase the risk of suicide attempts or repeated suicide attempts. Long-term methylphenidate treatment was associated with a lower risk for repeated suicide attempts among men (Huang et al., 2018).\n\nIn a prospective cohort study of more than 2.6 million Swedes, adults with ADHD had a small increase in premature death, mostly due to accidents and suicide. There was no significant association for children with ADHD (Sun et al., 2019b).\n\nCrime and Delinquency\n\nA study of the Danish population using nationwide registers found that, compared with other youth, those diagnosed with ADHD were more than twice as likely to be convicted of criminal offenses and were three times as likely to be incarcerated. After adjusting for other risk factors, those with ADHD were 60% more likely to have been convicted of a crime, and 70% more likely to have been incarcerated (Mohr-Jensen et al., "
