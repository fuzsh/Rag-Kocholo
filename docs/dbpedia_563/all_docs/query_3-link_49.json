        "text": "Forbes grew up in wealthy circumstances. He later studied at Princeton University in the US state of New Jersey. He then served in the US Army and took part in World War II. From 1949 he was politically active in New Jersey and was a member of the Senate from 1951 to 1959. In 1954 his father died and from that time on his son ran the media company together with his brother Bruce Charles Forbes. When he died in 1964, he ran the business alone. Malcolm Forbes made Forbes magazine one of the most successful papers on the international media market. He increased the number of buyers from 100,000 to around 750,000.\n\nThe publisher achieved the increase in sales and thus popularity of the magazine, which has its headquarters on Fifth Avenue in New York City, with rankings of the richest people in the world. They became the most popular topic rankings. Forbes has also been publishing its magazine on the German market since 1989. Over time, he also created rankings on other topics such as the list of the world's most successful companies or the list of the 13 highest-earning dead people. Since 2004, the magazine has published an annual ranking of the most powerful women in the world. With the rankings, the paper not only serves the curiosity of its readers, but they are also the basis for recognized indicators of the measured content. Forbes has thus surpassed its biggest competitor, Fortune Magazine.\n\nForbes' other publications include Nation's Heritage Magazine and Egg, a journal for art lovers. Outside of his business activities, Malcolm Forbes particularly attracted attention for his luxurious lifestyle. In doing so, he shaped the public image of the typical representative of capitalism, which he also maintained. The entrepreneur and multimillionaire spent around two million dollars on his last birthday party, to which he invited around 1,000 guests to Tangier. This penchant for lavish luxury further increased the popularity of his magazine. Forbes was considered a fanatical motorcycle lover and rider. He organized an annual \"Friendship Tours\" in which countless Harley-Davidson riders took part.\n\nOne of his extravagant hobbies was ballooning. The publisher's possessions alone in the form of real estate, paintings and luxury cars as well as his magazines were valued at around one billion US dollars during his lifetime.\n\nMalcolm Forbes died of a heart attack in New Jersey on February 24, 1990.\n\nFrank Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants Natalina Della (Garaventa), from Northern Italy, and Saverio Antonino Martino Sinatra, a Sicilian boxer, fireman, and bar owner. Growing up on the gritty streets of Hoboken made Sinatra determined to work hard to get ahead. Starting out as a saloon singer in musty little dives (he carried his own P.A. system), he eventually got work as a band singer, first with The Hoboken Four, then with Harry James and then Tommy Dorsey. With the help of George Evans (Sinatra's genius press agent), his image was shaped into that of a street thug and punk who was saved by his first wife, Nancy Barbato Sinatra. In 1942 he started his solo career, instantly finding fame as the king of the bobbysoxers--the young women and girls who were his fans--and becoming the most popular singer of the era among teenage music fans. About that time his film career was also starting in earnest, and after appearances in a few small films, he struck box-office gold with a lead role in Urlaub in Hollywood (1945) with Gene Kelly, a Best Picture nominee at the 1946 Academy Awards. Sinatra was awarded a special Oscar for his part in a short film that spoke out against intolerance, The House I Live In (1945). His career on a high, Sinatra went from strength to strength on record, stage and screen, peaking in 1949, once again with Gene Kelly, in the MGM musical Das ist New York (1949) and Spiel zu dritt (1949). A controversial public affair with screen siren Ava Gardner broke up his marriage to Nancy Barbato Sinatra and did his career little good, and his record sales dwindled. He continued to act, although in lesser films such as Zu allem entschlossen (1952), and a vocal cord hemorrhage all but ended his career. He fought back, though, finally securing a role he desperately wanted--Maggio in Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). He won an Oscar for best supporting actor and followed this with a scintillating performance as a cold-blooded assassin hired to kill the US President in Der Attentäter (1954). Arguably a career-best performance--garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor--was his role as a pathetic heroin addict in the powerful drama Der Mann mit dem goldenen Arm (1955).\n\nKnown as \"One-Take Charlie\" for his approach to acting that strove for spontaneity and energy, rather than perfection, Sinatra was an instinctive actor who was best at playing parts that mirrored his own personality. He continued to give strong and memorable performances in such films as Schwere Jungen, leichte Mädchen (1955), Schicksalsmelodie (1957) and Verdammt sind sie alle (1958). In the late 1950s and 1960s Sinatra became somewhat prolific as a producer, turning out such films as Eine Nummer zu groß (1959), Die siegreichen Drei (1962) and the very successful Sieben gegen Chicago (1964). Lighter roles alongside \"Rat Pack\" buddies Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. were lucrative, especially the famed Frankie und seine Spießgesellen (1960). On the other hand, he alternated such projects with much more serious offerings, such as Botschafter der Angst (1962), regarded by many critics as Sinatra's finest picture. He made his directorial debut with the World War II picture Der Lohn der Mutigen (1965), which was the first Japanese/American co-production. That same year Colonel von Ryans Expreß (1965) was a box office sensation. In 1967 Sinatra returned to familiar territory in Sidney J. Furie's Der Mann am Draht (1967), once again playing as assassin in his only film to be shot in the U.K. and Germany. That same year he starred as a private investigator in Der Schnüffler (1967), a role he reprised in the sequel, Die Lady in Zement (1968). He also starred with Lee Remick in Der Detektiv (1968), a film daring for its time with its theme of murders involving rich and powerful homosexual men, and it was a major box-office success.\n\nAfter appearing in the poorly received comic western Dirty Dingus, der scharfe Bandit (1970), Sinatra didn't act again for seven years, returning with a made-for-TV cops-and-mob-guys thriller Das Cherry-Street-Fiasko (1977), which he also produced. Based on the novel by William Rosenberg, this fable of fed-up cops turning vigilante against the mob boasted a stellar cast and was a ratings success. Sinatra returned to the big screen in Die erste Todsünde (1980), once again playing a New York detective, in a moving and understated performance that was a fitting coda to his career as a leading man. He made one more appearance on the big screen with a cameo in Auf dem Highway ist wieder die Hölle los (1984) and a final acting performance in Magnum (1980), in 1987, as a retired police detective seeking vengeance on the killers of his granddaughter, in an episode entitled Laura (1987).\n\nBruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born September 23, 1949 in Long Branch, New Jersey, USA. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, worked as a bus driver, and was of Irish and Dutch ancestry. His mother, Adele Ann (Zerilli), worked as a legal secretary, and was of Italian descent. He has an older sister, Virginia, and a younger sister Pamela Springsteen. Bruce was raised as a Catholic. He was inspired to take up music when he, at the age of seven, saw Elvis Presley on Toast of the Town (1948). When he was thirteen he bought his first guitar for 18 dollars. His mother took out a loan when Bruce was 16 and bought him a Kent guitar for 60 dollars.\n\nIn 1965, he became the lead guitarist in the band \"The Castiles\", he would later become lead singer in the band. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township, New Jersey. From 1969 to 1971 he performed with Steven Van Zandt, Danny Federici and Vini \"Mad Dog\" Lopez in a band called \"Child\", that was renamed later to \"Steel Mill\" when guitarist Robbin Thompson joined the band.\n\nIn 1972, he signed a record deal with Columbia Records and released his debut album, \"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\", with his New Jersey-based colleagues, who would later be called \"The E Street Band\", In January, 1973. The album had critical success and so did their second album, \"The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle\", released in September, 1973, but had little commercial success. In 1975, after more than 14 month of recording, their third album was released, \"Born to Run\", which had both critical and commercial success for Springsteen and the band.\n\nIn 1977, he returned to the studio, after a two-year legal battle with former manager Mike Appel, and produced the album, \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\", released in 1978 and became a turning point musically for his career. In 1980 came the release of \"The River\", the album sold well and he followed up with the album \"Nebraska\" which had critical success but had little commercial success. Springsteen came back with a bang with the release of the album \"Born in the U.S.A.\" in 1984, which sold 15 million copies in the U.S. alone and had seven top ten singles. It became one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nAfter the huge success of the \"Born in the U.S.A.\" album he released a more calm and sedate album in 1987, \"Tunnel of Love\", which included songs about love lost and the challenges of love, after the break-up with first wife, Julianne Phillips. The albums released in 1992, \"Lucky Town\" and \"Human Touch\" were also popular, Human Touch being the most popular of the two, hitting the number one spot of the best-selling albums in the UK. In 1994 he won an academy award for the song \"Streets of Philadelphia\" featured in the film Philadelphia (1993).\n\nIn 1995, he released the album \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\", which was mostly a solo guitar album and was inspired by \"Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass,\" a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Dale Maharidge. After being apart from the E Street Band for several years they reunited with a successful tour which ended in Madison Square Garden in New York in the year 2000. In 2002 he released the first studio album with the full band in over 18 years, \"The Rising\", and it became a critical and commercial success. In 2005 he released his third folk album (after \"Nebraska\" and \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\"), \"Devils & Dust\" It was followed by \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions\" in 2006 and \"Magic\" in 2007. His 16th album will be released on January 27, 2009 and is called \"Working on a Dream\".\n\nHe married for the first time at the age of 35 to actress Julianne Phillips. The marriage helped boost her acting career, but his traveling took it's toll on the marriage and the final blow came when she found out his affair with the American singer/songwriter/guitarist Patti Scialfa. Their marriage ended in 1989. He then married Patti Scialfa on June 8th, 1991, They had lived together since the separation between him and his first wife and they had a child before they married. They have three children together: Evan James Springsteen (born July 25, 1990), Jessica Rae (born December 30, 1991) and Sam Ryan Springsteen (born January 5, 1994).\n\nLong acknowledged as one of the best \"straight men\" in the business, Bud Abbott was born William Alexander Abbott in Reading, Pennsylvania to Rae (Fisher) and Harry Abbott, who had both worked for the Barnum and Bailey Circus. When Bud was three his family moved to Asbury Park, New Jersey, which he later, erroneously, listed as his place of birth. He himself worked in carnivals while still a child and dropped out of school in 1909. He worked as assistant treasurer for the Casino Theater in Brooklyn, then as treasurer and/or manager of various theaters around the country. He worked as the straight man to such vaudeville and burlesque comics as Harry Steepe and Harry Evanson while managing the National Theater in Detroit. In 1931 while cashiering at the Brooklyn theater, he substituted for comic Lou Costello's ill straight-man. The two clicked almost immediately and formed their famous comedy team. Throughout the 1930s they worked burlesque, minstrel shows, vaudeville and movie houses. In 1938 they got national exposure through the Kate Smith radio show \"The Kate Smith Hour\", and signed with Universal Pictures the next year. They made their film debut in One Night in the Tropics (1940), and, while the team wasn't the film's stars, it made money for Universal and they got good enough notices to convince Universal to give them their own picture. Their first starring film, Buck Privates (1941), with The Andrews Sisters, grossed what was then a company-record $10 million (on a $180,000 budget) and they were on their way to stardom and a long run as the most popular comedy team in America. In 1942 they topped a poll of Hollywood stars. They had their own radio show (ABC, 1941-6, NBC, 1946-9) and TV show (The Abbott and Costello Show (1952)). After the war their careers stalled and the box-office takes for their films started slipping. However, they made a big comeback in Abbott und Costello treffen Frankenstein (1948), which raked in huge profits and even got the team good notices from critics who normally wouldn't even review their films. The movie's success convinced Universal to embark on a series of films in which the team met various monsters or found themselves in exotic locations. Their film career eventually petered out and the team split up in 1957. Costello embarked on a series of TV appearances and even made a film, without Abbott, called Die 9-Meter-Braut (1959), but it was a flop. He received good notices after a dramatic performance in an episode of Wagon Train (1957) and was in discussion to star in a biography of famed New York City mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, a project Costello had been trying to get off the ground for years, when he died. Both Abbott and Costello had major tax problems with the Internal Revenue Service and wound up virtually broke. Abbott started over with a new partner, Candy Candido, in the 1960s and set off on a national tour, including Las Vegas, but the act failed. In 1966 he voiced his character in a cartoon version of their television show. His health deteriorated badly in the late 1960s, he had always suffered from epilepsy, and he died in 1974.\n\n\"There are no second acts in American lives,\" wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald, who himself went from being the high priest of the Jazz Age to a down-and-out alcoholic within the space of 20 years, but not before giving the world several literary masterpieces, the most famous of which is \"The Great Gatsby\" (1924).\n\nHe was born in 1896 to a mother who spoiled him shamelessly, leading him to grow up an especially self-possessed young man. While he was obsessed by the image of Princeton University, he flunked out, less interested in Latin and trigonometry than bathtub gin and \"bright young things\". The brightest was an unconventional young lady from Montgomery, Alabama named Zelda Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald invoked the jealousy of numerous local boys, some of whom had even begun a fraternity in Zelda's honor, by snagging her shortly before the publication of his first novel, \"This Side of Paradise\". The novel was a huge success, and Fitzgerald suddenly found himself the most highly-paid writer in America.\n\nDuring the mid-to-late '20s the Fitzgeralds lived in Europe among many American expatriates including Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway and Thornton Wilder. He wrote what is considered his greatest masterpiece, \"The Great Gatsby\", while living in Paris. It was at the end of this period (1924-30) that his marriage to the highly strung, demanding and mentally unstable Zelda began to unravel. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia and spent much of the rest of her life in a variety of mental institutions. Fitzgerald turned more and more to alcohol. In 1930 a major crisis came when Zelda had a series of psychotic attacks, beginning a descent into madness and schizophrenia from which she would never recover. Much of Fitzgerald's income would now be dedicated to keeping his wife in mental hospitals. Emotionally and creatively wrung out, he wrote \"Tender is The Night\" (1934), the story of Dick Diver and his schizophrenic wife Nicole, that shows the pain that he felt himself. In the mid-30s Fitzgerald had a breakdown of his own. He had become a clinical alcoholic, something he would detail in his famous \"The Crack-Up\" series of essays.\n\nWith Zelda institutionalized on the East Coast, it was Hollywood that proved to be Fitzgerald's salvation. Although he had little success in writing for films, which he had attempted several times previously, he was paid well and gained a new professional standing. His experiences there inspired \"The Last Tycoon\", his last--and unfinished--novel which some believe might have been his greatest of all. Fitzgerald died at the home of his mistress, writer Sheilah Graham, of a heart attack in 1940, believing himself to be a failed and broken man. He never knew that he would one day be considered one of the finest writers of the 20th century.\n\nJon Bon Jovi, was born John Francis Bongiovi, Jr. On March 2, 1962, in Perth Amboy, New Jersey to parents John Francis Bongiovi, Sr. and Carol Sharkey.\n\nFamily: Jon's mother, Carol Sharkey, was a former model and one of the first Playboy Bunnies. She met Bon Jovi's father after she enlisted in the United States Marines. John was already in the Marines when they met.\n\nBon Jovi has two brothers, Anthony and Matthew. Bon Jovi has four children, and is married to Dorothea Hurley (1989-present).\n\nKnown best as a singer-songwriter, in 1983 he was the founder and frontman of a band that bears his name. Bon Jovi is also known as a record producer, actor and philanthropist.\n\nMusic Career: Bon Jovi's music career started in June of 1982 after he was turned down by several record labels, including Atlantic Records and Mercury (Polygram) for the song \"Runaway\" which he recorded with a studio band named \"The Allstars.\"\n\nAfter being turned down he visited New York City's major market rock station WAPP, also known as \"The Apple\" at 103.5FM. WAPP included the song on a compilation of local talent and it became in instant hit.\n\nIn 1983 he signed with Mercury Records to promote \"Runaway\" and had to form a new band. Jon Bon Jovi became David Bryan, Alec John Such, bassist, Tico Torres, drummer, and his neighbor, Dave Sabo at lead guitar. Sabo played only a few local shows before he left to form the group Skid Row with Rachel Bolan. Sabo was soon replaced with Richie Sambora.\n\nAfter \"Runaway\" became a worldwide hit, Bon Jovi wanted a name for the band. He wanted to call themselves Johnny Electric. But Richard Fischer, employed then by Doc McGhee, suggested that Bon Jovi follow the norm where many bands were naming their groups by the lead or frontman' name, such as, Van Halen, Dokken, Bryan Adams, Alice Cooper (70's), so Bon Jovi became the name of the band.\n\nThe band's breakout album, \"Slippery When Wet,\" was their third studio album released in 1986. It became the band's best-selling album, selling more than 28 million worldwide, according to a Jan. 29, 2008 issue of the Daily Telegraph.\n\nBon Jovi's next album, \"New Jersey,\" not only shared the same success as \"Slippery When Wet,\" the album had five top-10 hits on Billboard's Hot-100. No other album or artist ever produced as many top-10 hits, and as of this writing (September 4, 2016) this record still stands. And two of the top-10 hits, \"Bad Medicine\" and \"I'll Be There For You\" topped the charts at number one, according to Bon Jovi's Biography on the Billboard website.\n\nThe band then went on an 18-month international tour, and when they finished, the band went on a hiatus.\n\nHiatus and Young Guns II: During the hiatus, Bon Jovi was hired to write the soundtrack for the movie \"Young Guns II.\" During this time actor Emilio Estevez approached Bon Jovi and asked if he could use \"Wanted, Dead or Alive\" as the title song for the movie.\n\nBon Jovi balked at the idea, saying he didn't think that song was the proper song, so he quickly wrote \"Blaze of Glory.\"\n\nAs the story goes, Kiefer Sutherland in an interview for UNCUT magazine said; \"When Jon (Bon Jovi) joined the team for Young Guns II, we were all eating hamburgers in a diner and Jon was scribbling on this napkin for, say, six minutes. He declared he'd written 'Blaze of Glory', which of course then went through the roof in the States. He later gave Emilio Estevez the napkin. We were munching burgers while he wrote a No. 1 song... Made us feel stupid.\"\n\nAfterwards, Bon Jovi played the song in a New Mexico desert for Estevez and John Fusco. This was the first time Bon Jovi played the song and heard by anyone. When the co-producers heard the song in a trailer, it was a no-brainer. It became the theme song for \"Young Guns II.\"\n\n\"Young Guns II,\" which was released in 1990 named which Bon Jovi made into his next album \"Blaze of Glory.\" This was Bon Jovi's first solo album as the other band members were off doing other things during the hiatus.\n\nThe movie's budget was $20 million and went on to earn $44 million. Two hits came from this album, \"Blaze of Glory\" and Miracle.\" Bon Jovi earned several Grammy and Oscar nominations.\n\nWhile he wrote a song or two for a couple of shows before this, this was his first and only project where he wrote every song for a movie's soundtrack. He did go on to write songs for other movies, and many of the group's songs were used in a variety of TV series.\n\nBack Together (Kind Of): During the years from their first hit \"Runaway\" in 1982, the group has released 12 studio albums and Bon Jovi recorded two solo albums and a number of singles. Worldwide, his band has sold more than 130 albums, ranking them among the top of the best sellers.\n\nBut the band isn't sitting around and resting. In 2015 there were rumors of a planned new album to be released sometime in 2016.\n\nRumors used to spread like wildfires, but today, the Internet allows them to travel at the speed of light. Talk about a new album for 2016 was confirmed by a consultant, and another world tour would follow.\n\nOn September 30, 2015, Bon Jovi said during a press conference confirming the new album, its title will be \"This House Is Not For Sale.\" He further said that the album is about the group's integrity.\n\n\"Integrity matters and we're at a place in our career where we don't have anything left to prove,\" Bon Jovi said.\n\nHowever, the new album is the first one without creative input from Richie Sambora, who left the group in 2013.\n\nOn Bon Jovi's Facebook page, a post announced that the new album, \"This House Is Not For Sale\" was released on August 27, 2016\n\nActing Career: He started acting in the 1990's starring in minor roles in movies such as \"U-571,\" and \"Moonlight and Valentino,\" and as Helen Hunt's husband in the movie \"Pay It Forward\" starring Kevin Spacey. He also appeared on several TV shows such as \"Sex and the City\" and \"Ally McBeal.\"\n\nAccolades: In 2009, Bon Jovi was inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nBon Jovi has also made appearances on some prestigious lists:\n\nIn 1996, he was named one of the \"50 Most Beautiful People In The World\" By People Magazine.\n\nIn 2000, the same magazine named him the \"Sexiest Rock Star.\"\n\nAlso in 2000 VH1 placed him on its \"100 Sexiest Artists.\"\n\nIn 2012 was ranked 50th in Billboard's magazine's \"Power 100,\" a ranking of \"The Most Powerful and Influential People In The Music Business.\"\n\n-In 2012, Hit Parader ranked Bon Jovi 31st in the \"Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists.\"\n\nPhilanthropy: In addition, Bon Jovi was the one of the founders and majority owners of the Arena Football League team Philadelphia Soul. He is the founder of The Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation which was founded in 2006 and exists to combat issues that force families and individuals into economic despair. He also campaigned for Al Gore in the 2000 Presidential election, John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential election, and Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential election. In 2010, President Barack Obama named Bon Jovi to the White House Council for Community Solutions. He was also awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities from Monmouth University in 2001.\n\nThis handsome, eloquent and highly charismatic actor became one of the foremost interpreters of Eugene O'Neill's plays and one of the most treasured names in song during the first half of the twentieth century. He also courted disdain and public controversy for most of his career as a staunch Cold War-era advocate for human rights, as well as his very vocal support for Joseph Stalin and the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. While the backlash of his civil rights activities and left-wing ideology left him embittered and practically ruined his career, he remains today a durable symbol of racial pride and consciousness.\n\nBorn in Princeton, New Jersey, on April 9, 1898, Paul LeRoy Bustill Robeson and his four siblings (William, Benjamin, Reeve, Marian) lost their mother, a schoolteacher, in a fire while quite young (Paul was only six). Paul's father, a humble Presbyterian minister and former slave, raised the family singlehandedly and the young, impressionable boy grew up singing spirituals in his father's church. Paul was a natural athlete and the tall (6'3\"), strapping high school fullback had no trouble earning a scholarship to prestigious Rutgers University in 1915 at age 17 -- becoming only the third member of his race to be admitted at the time. He excelled in football, baseball, basketball, and track and field, graduating as a four-letter man. He was also the holder of a Phi Beta Kappa key in his junior year and was a selected member of their honorary society, Cap and Skull. Moreover, he was the class valedictorian and in his speech was already preaching idealism.\n\nPaul subsequently played professional football to earn money while attending Columbia University's law school, and also took part in amateur dramatics. During this time he met and married Eslanda Cardozo Goode in 1921. She eventually became his personal assistant. Despite the fact that he was admitted to the New York bar, Paul's future as an actor was destined and he never did practice law. His wife persuaded him to play a role in \"Simon the Cyrenian\" at the Harlem YMCA in 1921. This was followed by his Broadway debut the following year in the short-lived play \"Taboo\", a drama set in Africa, which also went to London. As a result, he was asked to join the Provincetown Players, a Greenwich Village theater group that included in its membership playwright Eugene O'Neill. O'Neill personally asked Paul to star in his plays \"All God's Chillun Got Wings\" and \"The Emperor Jones\" in 1924. The reaction from both critics and audiences alike was electrifying...an actor was born.\n\nIn 1925 Paul delivered his first singing recital and also made his film debut starring in Body and Soul (1925), a rather murky melodrama that nevertheless was ahead of its time in its depictions of black characters. Although Robeson played a scurrilous, corrupt clergyman who takes advantage of his own people, his dynamic personality managed to shine through. Radio and recordings helped spread his name across foreign waters. His resonant bass was a major highlight in the London production of \"Show Boat\" particularly with his powerful rendition of \"Ol' Man River.\" He remained in London to play the role of Shakespeare's \"Othello\" in 1930 (at the time no U.S. company would hire him), and was again significant in a highly controversial production. Paul caused a slight stir by co-starring opposite a white actress, Peggy Ashcroft, who played Desdemona. Around this time Paul starred in the landmark British film Borderline (1930), a silent film that dealt strongly with racial themes, and then returned to the stage in the O'Neill play \"The Hairy Ape\" in 1931. The following year he appeared in a Broadway revival of \"Show Boat\" again as Joe. In the same production, the noted chanteuse Helen Morgan repeated her original 1927 performance as the half-caste role of Julie, but the white actress Tess Gardella played the role of Queenie in her customary blackface opposite Robeson.\n\nRobeson spent most of his time singing and performing in England throughout the 1930s. He also was given the opportunity to recapture two of his greatest stage successes on film: The Emperor Jones (1933) and Show Boat (1936). In Britain he continued to film sporadically with Bosambo (1935), Song of Freedom (1936), King Solomon's Mines (1937), Jericho (1937) and The Proud Valley (1940) in important roles that resisted demeaning stereotypes.\n\nDuring the 1930s he also gravitated strongly towards economics and politics with a burgeoning interest in social activism. In 1934 he made the first of several trips to the Soviet Union and outwardly extolled the Soviet way of life and his belief that it lacked racial bias, despite the Holodomor and the later Rootless Cosmopolitan Campaign. He was a popular figure in Wales where he became personally involved in their civil rights affairs, notably the Welsh miners. Developing a marked leftist ideology, he continued to criticize the blatant discrimination he found so prevalent in America.\n\nThe 1940s was a mixture of performance triumphs and poignant, political upheavals. While his title run in the musical drama \"John Henry\" (1940), was short-lived, he earned widespread acclaim for his Broadway \"Othello\" in 1943 opposite José Ferrer as Iago and Uta Hagen as Desdemona. By this time, however, Robeson was being reviled by much of white America for his outspoken civil rights speeches against segregation and lynchings, particularly in the South. A founder of the Progressive Party, an independent political party, his outdoor concerts sometimes ignited violence and he was now a full-blown target for \"Red Menace\" agitators. In 1946 he denied under oath being a member of the Communist Party, but steadfastly refused to refute the accusations under subsequent probes. As a result, his passport was withdrawn and he became engaged in legal battles for nearly a decade in order to retrieve it. Adding fuel to the fire was his only son's (Paul Jr.) marriage to a white woman in 1949 and his being awarded the Stalin Peace Prize in 1952 (he was unable to receive it until 1958 when his passport was returned to him).\n\nEssentially blacklisted, tainted press statements continued to hound him. He began performing less and less in America. Despite his growing scorn towards America, he never gave up his American citizenship although the anguish of it all led to a couple of suicide attempts, nervous breakdowns and a dependency on drugs. Europe was a different story. The people continued to hold him in high regard as an artist/concertist above reproach. He had a command of about 20 languages and wound up giving his last acting performance in \"Othello\" on foreign shores -- at Stratford-on-Avon in 1959.\n\nWhile still performing in the 1960s, his health suddenly took a turn for the worse and he finally returned to the United States in 1963. His poet/wife Eslanda Robeson died of cancer two years later. Paul remained in poor health for pretty much the rest of his life. His last years were spent in Harlem in near-total isolation, denying all interviews and public correspondence, although he was honored for speaking out against apartheid in South Africa in 1978.\n\nPaul died at age 77 of complications from a stroke. Among his many honors: he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995; he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998; was honored with a postage stamp during the \"Black Heritage\" series; and both a Cultural Center at Penn State University and a high school in Brooklyn bear his name. In 1995 his autobiography \"Here I Stand\" was published in England in 1958; his son, Paul Robeson Jr., also chronicled a book about his father, \"Undiscovered Paul Robeson: An Artist's Journey\" in 2001."
