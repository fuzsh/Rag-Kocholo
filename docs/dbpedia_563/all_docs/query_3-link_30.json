Stein, FRGS\n\nAuthor of Discovering the North-West Passage: The Four-Year Arctic Odyssey of H.M.S. Investigator and the McClure Expedition.\n\nTo reproduce or distribute, contact him: eloasis@earthlink.net\n\nObverse side, full size\n\nReverse side, full size\n\nThe Challenger Medal, natural size.\n\nClick on image for larger view.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMy intention is to provide anyone who seeks it, useful information regarding the medal commemorating the 1872-76 worldwide voyage of HMS Challenger, which (in hindsight) celebrates the beginning of the modern science of oceanography. The author would be pleased to receive any additional information about the Challenger Medal, and in particular, be made aware of other existing examples of this medal. Please contact me at eloasis@earthlink.net.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\"The objects of the Expedition have been fully and faithfully carried out. We always kept in view that to explore the conditions of the deep sea was the primary object of our mission, and throughout the voyage we took every possible opportunity of making a deep-sea observation. Between our departure from Sheerness on December 7th, 1872, and our arrival at Spithead on May 24th, 1876, we traversed a distance of 68,890 nautical miles, and at intervals as nearly uniform as possible we established 362 observing stations.\"\n\nProfessor Sir Charles Wyville Thomson\n\nBut the work of the Challenger Expedition had only just begun. A group of specialists, men learned in their own subjects, would spend years describing and drawing the specimens that filled storehouses and laboratories. Then, the daunting task of publishing the results fell for the most part on the shoulders of John Murray. For the authors of the Challenger Reports, they \"...received nothing more than a copy of the publication and a small honorarium to cover their expenses. In further appreciation it was resolved that a Challenger medal be struck (sic). The Treasury refused to pay for it and John Murray had the medal designed and executed at his own expense and himself sent replicas to those who had shared in the expedition or in the preparation of the Report. He himself was honoured by the Royal Society when he was admitted Fellow in 1896. Official commendation by the Government was deferred until 1898, when the Queen conferred to John Murray the rank of KCB [Knight Commander, The Most Honourable Order of the Bath] in recognition of his outstanding contributions to science.\" 1\n\nContemporary writings in the journal Nature stated the medal, \"...is being presented by Dr. John Murray to the naval officers of the expedition, the contributors of memoirs to the report[s] on the scientific results of the expedition, and to members of the civilian scientific staff, as a souvenir of Challenger work.\"2 There were instances where medals were issued to individuals who fell outside this scope. One person concerned was Laurence Pullar. He had an engineering and business background, was a man of wealth, and took a broad view of public service. Pullar was also a life-long friend of Murray, and a Fellow of both the Royal Society and Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nNUMISMATIC DETAILS OF THE CHALLENGER MEDAL 3\n\nObverse: Commemorates the voyage. In the center is a head and shoulders left-facing profile of the Roman goddess of wisdom and war, Minerva (in one of her many roles). Next to her is the image of an owl, her sacred bird (which is why wisdom is associated with owls). 4 These figures are superimosed upon a globe with lines of latitude and longitude. I know of at least one example of the medal with only the lines of longitude on the globe. 5 Partially encircling Athena and the owl is what appears to be an evergreen laurel branch; to the Greeks and Romans the laurel symbolised acquired immortality, both in battle as well as in the arts. 6 The whole is bordered by water, indicating the Expedition's round-the-world voyage. Figures from the sea include the Roman god of the sea, Neptune, who is grasping what appears to be a bottom sampler trawl in his right hand (disclosing treasures from the deep). He cradles his trident in the left hand. A stylized dolphin is close by, and two mermaids support a long ribbon, which carefuly conceals their charms. The ribbon bears the words: VOYAGE OF H.M.S CHALLENGER/1872-76. (Fig. 1) All images courtesy of St. Columba's Hospice, Challenger Lodge, Edinburgh.\n\nReverse: Commemorates work on the Challenger Reports. The central figure is a standing armored knight, throwing the gauntlet from his right hand into the sea (presumably to Neptune), whose trident appears above the waves - this being the crest of H.M.S. Challenger. The trident is partially wrapped in a long ribbon, which extends the entire circumference of the reverse. The ribbon bears the wording: REPORT ON THE SCIENTIFIC RESULTS OF THE CHALLENGER EXPEDITION 1886.95. (Fig. 2)\n\nSize: 75 mm ( 3 inches ).\n\nMetal: bronze (possibly also manufactured in silver, and though I have never seen an example in this metal, one example supposedly exists, and Brown states the medal was manufactured in silver). 7\n\nDesigner and Sculptor: William S. Black (an Edinburgh artist who actively exhibited between 1881-97) and William Birnie Rhind, RSA (1853-1933/an Edinburgh sculptor). 8\n\nHow manufactured: Cast.\n\nManufacturer: Unknown maker in Paris.\n\nNaming: Recipient's first name and surname are engraved on the edge at six o'clock,\n\nin sans serif capital letters. Sometimes, only the first and middle initials are engraved.\n\nNumber Cast: Unknown.\n\nNumber Issued: The List of Recipients of the Challenger Medal., 120 medals\n\nwere issued. Below, the List reveals the totals of issued medals from Aug. 29, 1895\n\nthrough Feb. 15, 1897.\n\n\"Up till Aug. 29. [1895]\n\n95 medal have been despatched (as per list)\n\n4 without names (1 to Mr. Irvine Smith - Aug. 27.95)\n\n1 \" \" taken to Holland by Mr.(sic) Murray\n\n1 engraved Monteith [this is struck through]\n\n100\n\nThe medal was issued from the Challenger Office, Edinburgh, in a fitted hinged\n\ncase, which has \"James Crichton & Co., 47 George St., Edinburgh\" printed on the white\n\nfabric of the inside lid. It comes with a simple handwritten document noting the\n\nrecipient's name, and that it is a souvenir of Challenger work. 9 (Fig. 3) Several medals\n\nwere hand delivered by Dr. Murray, but the majority of them were sent by post.\n\nHandwritten note, Alexander Buchan Medal\n\nClick on image for larger view.\n\nCHALLENGER MEDAL ROLL\n\nAssembling a complete medal roll presents various challenges. Laurence Pullar's award is but one example, as he did not (as far as I am aware) fit the criteria for the award, and yet he received a medal. Two other problems derive from the article in Nature. These writings state that Murray was presenting medals \"...to the naval officers of the expedition, the contributors of memoirs to the report[s] on the scientific results of the expedition, and to members of the civilian scientific staff, as a souvenir of Challenger work.\" Firstly, there are nine individuals included in Walter Crane's Challenger Expedition Reports. Portraits of the Contributors, Reproduced from the Photographs Presented by Them to John Murray, etc. (1897), who do not appear on the List of Recipients of the Challenger Medal, and there seems no apparent reasons for their omissions. The second problem is whether or not \"contributors\" included their assistants; perhaps in some cases the answer was yes, but in others no. Frederick Gordon Pearcey had one foot in each of the two worlds, as he was a Domestic 3rd Class in the Royal Navy, and an Assistant to the Naturalists onboard. His shipmate, Writer Richard Wyatt, must have significantly helped in the recording of data, and was thus rewarded with the medal. One recipient was a certain \"Miss Sclater\", who was quite likely Philip L. Sclater's daughter, but this cannot be confirmed. I cannot find links with the Expedition or subsequent scientific work among several individuals at the end of the Roll, but more research and time will undoubtedly unmask their roles. Please note that naval ranks shown are those existing at the time of the Expedition.\n\nCONTRIBUTORS TO THE REPORTS.\n\nThere was a conscious decision to invite the world's premier specialists to conduct the investigations and write the various Challenger Reports. This was done at the vigorous insistence of J. J. Thomson, who experienced considerable pressure to give a more prominent role to British scientists.\n\nOTHER RECIPIENTS\n\nNAME\n\nSPECIALTIES\n\nAND/OR POSITIONS\n\nNOTES\n\n103)\n\nANDERSON, W.

Named \"LAURENCE PULLAR\". FRSE (1903) and FRGS; LLD, University of Edinburgh (1926) in recognition of his generosity in the promotion of scientific research. Pullar was a life-long friend of Sir John Murray, and this association drew him into his interest in scientific research. With Pullar's financial aid, a steam yacht was built and equipped for oceanographical work near the shores of Scottish sea-lochs, which enabled Murray to carry on these investigations for several years. This is but one example of Pullar's financial assistance toward the advancement of science. It is claimed in some writings that Murray did not tolerate the red tape of government, and when the Treasury became stubborn, he spent his own money to bring out volumes of the Report.13 It would seem possible that Pullar also put money toward the publishing, and perhaps as a result of these financial contributions, was given a Challenger Medal by Murray. To date, however, the author has not uncovered any direct link between Pullar, the Challenger Expedition or the Reports.\n\n113)\n\nRICHARDS, George Henry, (1820-1896)\n\nRear Admiral\n\nFRS (1866); CB (Civil/1871); Knighted (1877); KCB (1886); Arctic 1818-55 Medal (Commander/HMS Assistance/1852-54). Richards had an extensive background as a surveying officer, and in 1864, was appointed Hydrographer of the Navy. He retired from the RN in January 1874, and in December of that year, served on a committee to plan the Arctic Expedition of 1875. Richards appears in the group photograph of the Royal Society's scientific party onboard the Challenger (December 1872)\n\n114)\n\nTHE ROYAL SOCIETY\n\nMedal known.

The Marine Biological Station at Millport was established on the Isle of Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde, in the spring of 1885. The Report relates that Turbyne \"worked for over 13 years under Dr. Murray's instructions (including 10 years consecutively)\", conducting practical investigations \"while matters strictly scientific were undertaken and prepared for press by men with a scientific training.\" The above would explain the award of the Challenger Medal. At some point, Turbyne live aboard The Ark, a lighter converted into a floating laboratory by Murray. The Ark marked the establishment of the Marine Station at Millport, the oldest in Scotland. Turbyne evidently went to work for the Fisheries Department of Cape Colony in 1898, and died as a result of a gun accident in East London, South Africa, on 15 July 1905.\n\n119)\n\nWEIR, Mrs. Amelia\n\n?\n\nSent \"C/O James Murray, Supt. Can. Pac. Rl [Canadian Pacific Railroad], Winnipeg, Manitoba'. Acknowledged in the Challenger Reports for her assistance.\n\n120)\n\nOne unengraved medal\n\nTaken to Holland by Dr. Murray.\n\nAddendum\n\nBelow are individuals who do not appear on the List of Recipients of the Challenger Medal, but who were evidently in every way entitled to the award, whether through participation in the voyage or having contributed to the Reports. Though it is possible that medals were not issued to some of these men due to their deaths, Busk, Carpenter and Huxley are a few examples of posthumously awarded medals. Perhaps some families could not be traced? As for the naval officers/warrant officers, excepting Commander Lloyd, it is possible that the other RN men had left the Service and could not be traced. But this again does not offer a certain answer to the question of why these men do not appear on the List.\n\nROYAL NAVY\n\nRANKS\n\nNOTES\n\n1)\n\nCOX, Richard\n\nBoatswain\n\nIn charge of stores.\n\n2)\n\nCROSBIE, Alexander\n\nStaff Surgeon\n\n3)\n\nFERGUSON, James H.\n\nChief Engineer\n\nIn charge of engines.\n\n4)\n\nHARSTON, Henry Cuthbert Eagles\n\nSub-Lieutenant\n\n(1852-76)\n\nSon of an RN Captain.

In 1886, he put forth a plan to send two ships on a major Antarctic expedition. Although it was never put into action, eight years later, the RGS used his ideas to promote the British National Antarctic Expedition.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nActg. - Acting\n\nAOU - American Ornithologists' Union\n\nAsst. - Assistant\n\nCB - Companion of the Order of the Bath\n\nCIE - Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire\n\nCmdr. - Commander\n\nCMZS - Charter Member Zoological Society (?)\n\nCVO - Commander Victorian Order\n\nDSO - Distinguished Service Order\n\nEngr. - Engineer\n\nFGS - Fellow of the Geological Society\n\nFLS - Fellow of the Linnean Society\n\nFRCSI - Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\n\nFRGS - Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society\n\nFRMS - Fellow of the Royal Meteorlogical Society\n\nFRS - Fellow of the Royal Society\n\nFRSE - Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh\n\nFRSSL&E - Fellow of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh\n\nFZS - Fellow of the Zoological Society of London\n\nGSC - Geographic Society of Chicago\n\nHon. - Honorary\n\nIGS - India General Service Medal 1854-95\n\nIRGS - Imperial Russian Geographical Society\n\nKCB - Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath\n\nKCMG- Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George\n\nLLD - Legum Doctor (Doctor of Law)\n\nMB - Bachelor of Medicine\n\nMID - Mentioned in Despatches\n\nMRCS- Member of the Royal College of Surgeons\n\nMRIA - Member Royal Irish Academy\n\nRHS - Royal Humane Society\n\nRN - Royal Navy\n\nRNVR - Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve\n\nRS - Royal Society (London)\n\nRSA - Royal Society of Arts\n\nRSE - Royal Society of Edinburgh\n\nRSGS - The Royal Scottish Geographical Society\n\nRSNWS - The Royal Society of New South Wales\n\nSAGS - Swedish Anthropological & Geographical Society\n\nVPPS - Vice President of the Palaeontographical Society\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nDr. Robert Gibson Alloo\n\nMs. Clara Anderson\n\nDr. David C.

The Club held monthly meetings from October to June, and was extremely active for two decades, but this activity gradually lessened. The regular communication helped X Club members to gather their efforts on behalf of science against what they felt to be the obstructionist activities and ideas of conservative scientists, certain theologians, and non-scientific society figures. Members at the birth of the X Club were: George Busk (1807- 86), Joseph D. Hooker (1817-1911), Herbert Spencer (1820-1923), John Tyndall (1820-93), Edward Frankland (1825-99), Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-95), Thomas Archer Hirst (1830-92) and John Lubbock (1834-1913). William Spottiswoode (1825-83) became the ninth member of the Club at its second meeting. Much of the discussion at the meetings focused on the affairs of the Royal Society. By 1864, all were Fellows of the Royal Society, except Spencer who, due to principle and possible resentment, flatly refused to agree to his being nominated. The X Club exerted important influence in the Royal Society, in the British Association, in various other scholarly societies, in the Royal Institution, and in the publishing of scientific works."
