In America they had begun to lay rail roads and run steam trains. They were talking about running steam boats across the Atlantic. Prof. MORSE and others were talking about the probability of constructing electric telegraphs, although it was nearly fifteen years before he completed and operated his first line. All these topics were familiar to the people of Great Britain, and all new ideas were rapidly followed up for both nations were of the same language and civil institutions. The laboring and middle classes became infatuated with the idea of the right to vote as they had in the United States. At that time there was a property qualification in Britain. To have the right of suffrage a citizen must be a property holder to so large an extent that all the middle classes were deprived of the privilege. At about this date, 1830, there was organized a secret society called the \"Chartists,\" which rapidly spread all over the kingdom. These Chartists claimed that under the great charter signed by King John in 1215, every citizen had the right to vote at all elections of members of the House of Commons. By the year 1840 there were lodges of Chartists in all the cities and towns of the kingdom, and the society published a small weekly paper called \"The Chartist Circular.\" The society about that time had prepared an immense petition, addressed to the government, containing a personal appeal to Queen Victoria, asking and demanding universal suffrage, throughout the kingdom, as it was then enjoyed by the common people of the United States of America. This petition bore over two million signatures. When this petition was presented in the Parliament, it frightened the government as badly as the \"gunpowder plot\" of Guy FAWKES had done two hundred years before. Parliament immediately passed an act declaring it treason for any person to hold membership in the society of the Chartists and ordering the arrest and immediate trial of all officers of the society everywhere. Queen Victoria, who feared a \"reign of terror\" and a wholesale slaughter of many innocent persons, postponed the signing of the law from time to time. But the passage of the law had been published and no one could tell how soon the Queen might be persuaded to attach her signature and set the prosecutions in motion. In the spring of 1843, Uncle Robert, father's youngest brother, who was working in a machine shop in the city of Glasgow and who had made himself active among the Chartists, quietly quit work and took passage to America, following some friends to Pittsburgh, Pa., where he immediately secured good employment and found the demand for labor strong and wages better than in Scotland. Father had been secretary of the society in Dundee, where he had worked ever since before his marriage, and he felt very uneasy under the circumstances. The letters he received from his brother in Pittsburg induced him to get out of the kingdom but he could not get up the resolution, or the money probably, till the spring of 1846. Early in April, 1846, he and his family started from Dundee, by rail to Glasgow, and went aboard the sailing vessel \"The Three Bells\" at the Glasgow pier, on Thursday, April 16 (1846). The voyage was a tedious one and they did not reach New York till May 30th. They then went as directly as possible to Pittsburg, and father found good employment in the shops in Alleghany City where he lived and worked till he lost his health. At the time we started for America Margret was five years old and I was the baby in my mother's arms. Early in the year 1848 father was compelled to give up work, from a softening of the large bone of his left limb. The doctors called it \"white swelling.\" For almost five years he was a great sufferer, and his illness resulted in the amputation of his limb in May 1852. In the meantime through the charity and kindnesses of many friends and relatives, he and his family had removed from Pennsylvania to LaPorte Co, Indiana, where he and mother bought a small farm of eighty acres of wild land, four and a half miles southeast of LaPorte city, the Co seat. Here they both toiled hard through many years of poverty and distress. With the help of numerous friends father set up a country blacksmith shop, in which he did his first job of work on Feb. 19, 1853. He was an excellent workman and always had all the work he could do as long as he was able to work at all. They improved their little wild acreage and it became and beautiful and comfortable home and here they both lived the rest of their lives. Their mortal ashes repose in the beautiful little churchyard of Salem Chapel, in a spot chosen by father several years before his death. They sleep side by side, surrounded by many of their neighbors with whom they enjoyed years of harmony and peace during the painful decline of their mortal pilgrimage. \"Safe they rest the green turf under, Sighing breeze, or music's breath, Winter's wind or summer's thunder, Cannot break their sleep of death!\"\n\nA Coincidence from CRICHTON by William Seaman CRICHTON. My Uncle James Crichton came to America in the spring of 1851. He, his wife and eight children embarked at Glasgow about the first of April, and arrived at LaPorte late in May. On comparing notes they found that they had come across the Atlantic on the same vessel, \"The Three Bells\" that had brought us across seven years before. This was the same old vessel that afterwards effected a noted rescue of a passenger ship in distress, saving all on board. On this last occasion she was under the command of Captain CREIGHTON. This officer heard the signals of distress and went to the rescue. But he did not reach the wreck until dark and the sea was running so high he could do nothing. He put out lights and signaled: \"Keep up your hearts, I'll stand by you till the morning.\" The winds fell towards morning and as soon as day broke the work of rescue was begun, and not a life was lost. Some evangelist wrote a hymn suggested by the occurrence, \"I'll stand by you till the morning.\"\n\nINTERVIEW/ARTIFACTS RECORDS\n\nEND OF RESEARCH RECORD\n\nSource: Betty JENSEN; CRICHTON by W.S.

Dear Mrs. Boise: Please forgive me for taking so long in responding to your lovely letter. My husband and I are painting our apartment and your letter got buried under masses of boxes and dropcloths. We definitely are related, and the key is your first cousin, John CRICHTON of AAAA. Now I've forgotten exactly how John is related to my branch of the family, but he explained it to me five years ago, when, for some reason, I interviewed him. It's a fairly complicated and somewhat distant connection, but a real one all the same. Of course, all of our roots go back to Scotland, right? I was in Scotland last spring and visited the CRICHTON Castle, south of Edinburgh, and found that our family basically ruled Scotland throughout the 15th and part of the 16th century. My branch of the family came to this country around the turn-of-the-century, and they settled in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, slightly east of Pittsburgh. As they had been in the old country, they were coal miners. There were eight brothers and three sisters...Andrew, Clarendon, Harry, Robert, Kyle, Margaret, Sarah...I forget the others at the moment. Their father was William. My grandfather was the youngest, Kyle. He developed tuberculosis, and his siblings chipped in and sent him to a sanitorium in New Mexico to recover. There, he married my grandmother, Mae COLLIER, a nurse from Atlanta, and he became a writer. In the meantime, his brothers began salting away money and bit by bit they amassed enough to purchase controlling interest in the mine in which they worked. This led to the purchase of another mine, and then another and another. From the lowest tiers of the hills of Johnstown, they rose to the top, living in a series of huge Victorian houses at the very top of the city. Throughout the 1930's and 40's on into the 50's they were a very powerful, massive family. They were intensely competitive and intensely loyal. My grandfather became a well-known Communist in the 1930's, whereas his brothers, now mine-owners, were ardent Capitalists. But though they fiercely argued, they were equally fiercely loyal to each other. Sadly, all the brothers died young. I don't think one lived past 65. They all died of heart attacks - something my father ascribes to the radical change in their diet (too many steaks, eggs, rich foods), and to their driven lives. The second generation took over the mines for a while, but as you know, coal mines are depleted fairly quickly and in addition, in the 1950's and 60's, coal ceased being such an important resource. So this generation eventually sold off the mines. Many remain tangentially involved (as consultants, etc.), and many others still live in Johnstown. Those who didn't become involved with coal in some way seem to have turned to writing or publishing. My grandfather, Kyle, besides writing a lot for such left-wing magazines as The New Masses, was a highly successful journalist for Colliers Magazine, the Saturday Evening Post, and Life. He also wrote a wide range of books varying from the first biography of the Marx Brothers to a history of New Mexico. He had two sons and a daughter. My Uncle Andy was one of the founding editors of Sports Illustrated and is now the editor of a chain of local magazines in the suburbs of New York. My father, Robert, is the author of \"The Great Imposter\" (which became a Tony CURTIS movie), \"The Secret of Santa Vittoria\" (which also became a movie), and \"The Camerons\" (1972) which was loosely based on his family in Scotland, just before they came to this country. My father's cousin Jean CRICHTON is the head of Associated Press Radio in New Jersey. Another cousin is editor of a trade newspaper called Energy News. My sister, Jennifer, who is only 23, is a budding young fiction writer, and I have been making a decent living as a freelance journalist for the past six or seven years. Physically, we all look alike. We are very tall (my brother Rob is the tallest at 6'7\"), blondish, and slightly squinty-eyed. It was incredible to travel to Scotland and find hundreds of people who looked like us! And over there, they automatically pronounce the name correctly. I married a man named Guy MARTIN three years ago, but found I was much too attached to the family name to give it up. MARTIN just seemed too bland in comparison. Besides which, CRICHTON is becoming quite a well-known name for writers (Michael has certainly helped that), and any advantage seems worth taking. As for where all the CRICHTONs are now, a few great-aunts live in Florida now. My father's cousin, known as Nashville Bob, started a chain of Tennessee CRICHTONs. And many have moved to New York City. In fact there are about 12 of us within ten blocks of each other. Four moved to Colorado. One has an auto dealership in the Virgin Islands. We are everywhere! I will keep asking my cousins about your branch, and if I ever find out where the connection lies, I will certainly tell you. Thank you so much for writing. How exciting to find other CRICHTONs--especially a Western branch! And how pleasing it is to find people actually read the articles in those flight magazines. Sincerely Yours, Sarah CRICHTON\n\nNewspaper Notes. The Silver State, Deer Lodge, MT. 2 Jul 1942. ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL. Mrs. W. S.

A few years ago he went into business for himself and was known as a very capable man in his calling.

The long and persistent illness to which he was subjected brought him and his relatives much sympathy and the patient and heroic struggle he made won him admiration. Besides his wife he leaves a widowed mother and two sisters, the Misses Rose and Emma BARTOS. Mrs. BARTOS, formerly Miss May CRICHTON was county superintendent of schools in this county for a number of years and has been active in connection with women's political organizations.

CRICHTON's booklet: Johnathan [sic] Henderson CRICHTON. Jonathan Henderson CRICHTON was a soldier by instinct. Uniformity in dress and movement had a charm which he could not resist. When barely of sufficient age he enlisted in Company \"C\" Nebraska State Guard, in which he served three years. During which he attained, by promotion, the rank of first lieutenant in his company. In June, 1913 he resigned his commission in the State Guard and enlisted as a private in the 27th Co., 4th regiment, U.S.M.C., for a term of four years. At the expiration of his term he was with his regiment in active service on the Island of San Domingo. The world war was then on, and no transportation could be had to the states, he thus continued in the service till early in October, when he was honorably discharged. When he was sworn into the service in the Marine corps, he gave his name as John Henderson and his service record is under that name. He was known among his associates as Jack CRICHTON. He never gave any explanation of this change of name, it was his own voluntary act. When he entered the Marine corps he already was a well drilled soldier, and he devoted himself unreservedly to qualification. He qualified as expert cook in the galleys. On the range he qualified as sharp-shooter and also as expert rifleman, and received the decorations and rewards due to both qualifications. In the selective draft made early in the summer of '18 he was drafted for service. In the meantime he and Miss Lyda McLAIN had been married, but he didn't seek exemption from service on that or any other pretext. About 110 drafted men had assembled at Sterling for transportation. Among all these he was the only man who had any experience in military matters. He was put in command of the contingent, by the draft commission, and ordered to report it to the commandant at Ft. McAllister, Cal. He entrained at Sterling, Oct. 24th and arrived at the fort Sunday evening the 27th, without a mishap of any kind or a man missing. The following day, Oct. 28th, he was stricken with influenza. It was with great difficulty, and only by the help of comrades and officers, that he was able to complete his own enlistment. He was carried to the hospital Tuesday morning, Oct. 29th. On the following Tuesday morning, Nov. 5th, at 9:30, he died. He was a faithful and efficient soldier. During his long service of over four years in the Marine corps he was never in the guard house, nor ever even reprimanded for disobedience of orders. Until his final illness he had never been on the sick list a single day. His record as a soldier is perfect and without a blemish. \"On Fame's eternal camping ground/His low green tent is spread,/Where Freedom guards, with solemn round,/The bivouac of the dead.\" John CRICHTON and Miss Lyda McLAIN were married at Sterling, Colo., Aug. 12, 1918, by the Rev. E. Payne, pastor of the Baptist church. To them was born: John Henderson, March 4, 1919.\n\nObituary. Sterling South Platte Sentinel, 13-15 Nov 1918. Military Funeral for John CRICHTON Is Conducted Today. The military funeral of John CRICHTON, who died November 5th at Fort McArthur, San Pedro, California, was held Tuesday at 10:30 o'clock and interment took place in the Sterling cemetery. A squad of the local national guards were in charge of the service. Rev. M. Gatewood MILLIGAN gave a short discourse, after which the guard quartette sang \"Nearer My God, to Thee\". Bugler LITTLER then sounded taps and the squad fired the customer three volleys over their departed comrade.

He joined the Advertising Age staff in Chicago in 1941 and was transferred to Washington, DC. In 1942, he entered military service as a lieutenant j.g. in the Navy. In 1946, he returned to the Advertising Age in New York in the editorial office. He was named executive editor in 1949 and on 1 Jan 1958, became editor. He was named president elect of American Association of Advertising Agencies (Four A's) in October of 1961 and officially became president on 15 Jan 1962. He was a director of numerous organizations, and member of the American Marketing Association, the National Press Club and The Norwalk (CT) Yacht Club.\n\nObituary: Advertising Age (2 Jan 1978). John CRICHTON dead at 58; headed Four A's since '62. New York - John H. CRICHTON, 58, president of the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies for the past 15 years, collapsed and died at his desk in the Pan Am building here on Tuesday, Dec. 27. Death was attributed to a heart attack. Mr. CRICHTON arrived at his office shortly before 9 a.m., having enjoyed a long Christmas weekend, chatted with some associates, took a cigaret, removed his hat and coat and asked for coffee. he then busied himself with mail that had been placed on his desk. Minutes later, he was found unconscious. His associates struggled frantically and without success to revive him, as did a police emergency squad that was quickly summoned. A memorial service was held last Friday morning at the New Canaan, Conn., Presbyterian Church, followed by a private burial service. The CRICHTON family asked that those wishing to memorialize Mr. CRICHTON send contributions to the A.A.A.A. Educational Foundation, Inc., a Four A's activity that was a main source of pride for Mr. CRICHTON and the membership. Considered to be in rugged good health, the trim, 6-ft., 5-in. Four A's leader enjoyed swimming as his exercise and was said to have passed an insurance physical only a month ago. One shocked associate, stating that he knew of no health problem where Mr. CRICHTON was concerned, added, \"But he never complained, so even if he wasn't feeling well, we wouldn't have known.\" After taking over as Four A's president officially on Jan. 15, 1962, when he resigned as editor of Advertising Age, Mr. CRICHTON went on in his quiet style to enunciate clear positions for advertising agencies on the issues that concerned them. He pressed agencies to create more job opportunities for young people so that the talent pipelines would always be full and the practice of \"pirating\" talent would cease. He brought Four A's members, early on, into an awareness of the need to bring more blacks and other minorities into the agency business at all levels. As for clients, he called for them to make certain, among other things, that their agencies always had adequate information. Back in the 1960's, Mr. CRICHTON spoke of the future of the agency business and noted that while slight changes would occur from time to time, the basic need - service - would never change. His obsession with service to the 433 Four A's member agencies representing 75% of U.S. agency billings was but one of the qualities his associates spoke about following his death. Knowing that agencies expected service from the Four A's office because they were being pressured by clients to provide service, Mr. CRICHTON was described as a leader who regarded every call for assistance an important one. \"Prayer meetings\" they called those staff meetings at which he would exhort aides to redouble their efforts. Mr. CRICHTON, as can be expected from the head of the nation's leading advertising agency organization, was an uncompromising advocate of independent, full-service agencies. Mr. CRICHTON also was remembered as a leader who couldn't say no, accepting speaking engagements and then putting his newspaper reporter training to use, writing his own speeches. Aides at the Four A's, as did his former newspaper staff associates, would express awe at the way \"copy\" would roll smoothly from his typewriter. He was next scheduled to speak before the Traffic Audit Bureau conference in Key Biscayne, Fla., on Jan. 26. \"This place reflects his style,\" said Harry PASTER, vp and a CRICHTON aide, who will mark his 30th anniversary at the Four A's early in 1978. \"It's a well-oiled machine; the work will go on, but we'll miss John terribly.\" The Four A's president was described as a basically shy, but warm person who was, most of al, \"a very, very private person.\" \"I didn't know hw had a grandchild until recently,\" said another associate who saw him daily. When problems arose, it was recalled, Mr. CRICHTON would light up his pipe and summon an aide or two to his office to talk over the situation. \"There's trouble in River City,\" he might begin, and then proceed to outline the problem and work out an approach to it. \"He was just tremendous; a man of great character. We were all so very, very fond of him,\" Mr. PASTER said. John Henderson CRICHTON was born in Padroni, Colo., on March 4, 1919. He received a degree from the University of Missouri journalism school in 1940 and served briefly as a newspaper reporter in Colorado and Montana. Then the 22-year-old newsman and his wife, the former Zula MILLER, moved to Chicago where he took a job in the promotion department of LaSalle Steel Co. He joined the Advertising Age staff in Chicago in 1941 and was subsequently assigned to AA's Washington office. After leaving in 1942 for wartime service as a lieutenant (j.g.) with the Navy, he returned in 1946, this time to the Ad Age New York editorial office. He was named executive editor in 1949 and on Jan. 1, 1958, became editor, succeeding Sidney R. BERNSTEIN, who advanced to editorial director. After being named president elect of the Four A's in October, 1961, Mr. CRICHTON, who had never worked for an advertising agency, officially became president on Jan. 15, 1962, succeeding Frederic R. GAMBLE, who retired after 33 years in that post. A resident of New Canaan, Conn., Mr. CRICHTON was a director of the Advertising Research Foundation, the Traffic Audit Bureau, Advertising Council, the National Center for Voluntary Action, served on the advisory committee of the U.S. Council of the International Chamber of Commerce, on the communications committee of the Chamber of Commerce of the U.S., on the advisory council of Hampshire College, and was a member of the American Marketing Assn., the National Press Club, and the Norwalk (Conn.) Yacht Club. Two sons, Michael and Douglas Christopher, and two daughters, Catherine and Kimberly, and Mrs. CRICHTON survive. Michael CRICHTON, a doctor who turned to writing (\"The Andromeda Strain,\" \"Five Patients,\" \"The Terminal Man,\" \"The Great Train Robbery,\" \"Eaters of the Dead\"), also is a motion picture screenwriter and director.\n\nAdvertising Age, 2 Jan 1978. Agency execs hail CRICHTON's leadership. New York - Heartfelt comments abut John H. CRICHTON's service to the advertising business and his personal qualities began arriving at American Assn. of Advertising Agencies' offices here within hours of his death on Dec. 27. Almost all who expressed their feelings about the late Four A's president used words such as \"inspirational,\" \"integrity,\" \"warmth\" and \"intellect\" to describe the leadership talents that Mr. CRICHTON displayed during his 15-year tenure at the Four A's. Among comments from agency executives: Ed NEY, new chairman of the Four A's and chairman and chief executive officer at Young & Rubicam, said, \"My own belief about John - which I know is shared by many - is that he was a man of enormous integrity and credibility. he has been a great leader of the Four A's - there could be no more superb an industry representative - and a great gentlemen, as well as a fine, rare, delightful human being.\" Thomas K. MYERS, a Four A's director and chairman of Norman, Craig 7 KRUMMEL, said: \"John's leadership of the Four A's was highly dedicated and effective. His personal contribution to our industry's professional practices and standards is unequaled.\" Four A's director Franklin E. SCHAFFER, chairman of Doremus & Co., said, \"No one has served our business with greater intelligence, foresight and moderation. He will be remembered and missed for years to come.\" John PINGEL, president of Ross Roy, In., Detroit, said, \"It is a tremendous loss, both personally and to the advertising industry.\" Richard D. O'CONNOR, president of Campbell-Ewald Co., and a member of the Four A's government relations committee: \"I don't know anyone who knew more about the advertising agency business than John CRICHTON. He was a real professional in every respect.\" David STASHOWER, president of Lang, Fisher, Stashower, Cleveland, said, \"We won't be able to measure the magnitude of the loss of John for some time. He had such grace and composure, and was so articulate in a very demanding role. He had all the attributes that all advertising people have, and lots that most of us don't have. He saw his function as one of making other people prominent and, in so doing, he became the preeminent professional of us all.\" Four A's board member Tom RANDOLPH, vp-general manager at Foote, Cone & Belding/Honig, San Francisco: \"John CRICHTON was a most articulate voice in getting our story across to this country's legislators and helped give them a better understanding of the nature of the business we're in.\" Victor G. BLOEDE, chairman of Benton & Bowles and onetime chairman of the Four A's, noted that \"John CRICHTON was an altogether remarkable man. He was a business philosopher, an inspirational leader, a gifted writer and the most articulate spokesman our industry ever had. Charles PEEBLER, chairman-president of Bozell & Jacobs International quoted philosopher Lao-tzu: \"...'It is a good leader who talks little. When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will all say, we did this ourselves.' John's leadership will be missed, for now we'll have to do it ourselves.\" John WARWICK, chairman, Warwick, Welsh & Miller, commented that: Mr. CRICHTON provided a \"stability factor to our industry unmatched by any other individual in the last 15 years. he did more to improve and strengthen our business than anyone I can recall.\" Eugene KRUMMEL, chairman, McCann-Erickson, noted, \"John CRICHTON, in his person, epitomized the dedication all of us at our best have toward the advertising profession, as well as the contribution at its very best we make to business, to the consumer and to society.\" Tomas B. ADAMS, chairman of Campbell-Ewald, Detroit, and a former Four A's chairman, said, \"If you ever use the word noble to describe a man, he was the noblest I knew. He was a man of integrity who kept the business well directed to worthy objectives. He worked with hundreds of chiefs and was able to keep them all quite well satisfied.\" Don JOHNSTON, chairman-chief executive officer, J. Walter Thompson Co., said,: \"John CRICHTON will be missed because he was such a special person. John gave dignity to the office, and the position of president of the Four A's and the Four A's itself has grown in stature because of him.\" Tom DILLON, chairman, BBDO, said: \"because he did not publicize his own activities, few probably realize what this dedicated man contributed. Quiet, modest, calm and intellectually objective, he had a perspective which was unique. He not only understood advertising, but he had a broad grasp of public policy. Under him the Four A's grew from a mere trade association to a source respected by both government and industry. Because of his newspaper background, he clearly understood the inescapable independence of freedom of the press upon advertising. I think it was his dedication to the former that provided his dedication to the latter.\" Donald B. MILLER, chairman of Rumrill-Hoyt, said, \"When a history of the advertising business is written, John CRICHTON will be listed among the giants. He was a statesman in our business. And, as such, was able to further the understanding of advertising among the governmental bodies. He promoted educational grants that benefited not only their recipients but the industry as well. He was a key factor in developing a self-regulatory body for advertising...He was one of a kind. Doubtless we'll find an outstanding successor, but we'll never find a replacement.\" Al SEAMAN, president, SSC&B, called Mr. CRICHTON \"truly a rare individual. I choose the word individual because he was always totally John CRICHTON. More than almost anyone else I have known, John combined a broad and searching intellect with the discipline of strict moral standards. If your thinking was fairly close to John's, you couldn't be far wrong.\" Robert CHRISTIANSEN of Cramer-Krasselt Co., Milwaukee, said that Mr. CRICHTON's death \"is a stunning blow to the advertising fraternity. John CRICHTON was first and foremost a statesman,\" Mr. CHRISTIANSEN said, \"and an industry leader beyond equal.\" William AISTON of Clinton E. Frank Inc., Chicago, echoed the \"statesman\" description of Mr. CRICHTON, adding that \"he had an overview of the industry and the ability and perspective to articulate the broad issues.\" Richard CHRISTIAN, Marsteller chairman and past chairman of the Four A's, said, \"John CRICHTON was a tower of strength to the advertising industry in general and to advertising agencies in particular. He was a true business statesman and philosopher who understood how advertising works. No one I know of could match John CRICHTON's ability in defining and distilling the advertising industry's problems and opportunities. His skill in developing and suggesting short and long-range solutions to problems was superb.\" Robert E. JACOBY, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Ted Bates & Co., said: \"All of us at Bates consider the loss of John CRICHTON to be a great tragedy for the advertising industry and the business community at large. He was a man of towering integrity and intellect and will be sorely missed.\" Anthony C. CHEVINS, president of Cunningham & Walsh, said Mr. CRICHTON was \"a very gifted and unusual man who was often underestimated by those who did not know him well because of his calm. almost detached manner. He had a rare combination of patience, wit and intelligence...He was a fine human being, a man of integrity, a true friend.\"\n\nAdvertising Age, 2 Jan 1978. Editorial Viewpoint. Giant of a man. John CRICHTON was a giant of a man. Physically he towered over most of us. You looked up at a 45-degree angle when you talked with him. There was a special mirth in his eyes and a chuckle in his voice as he picked his words, almost lovingly, to drive home some point. Our senior editors at Advertising Age have reason to know he was a giant in other respects. A graduate of the journalism school at the University of Missouri, he was one of us in our Chicago office in those far off days when we were the underdog \"new kid on the block\" among marketing publications. He was our man in Washington in the early years of World War II. After the war he returned to manage our New York office and to become editor of Ad Age. It was something of a shock to us, and to many leaders of the ad business when he was invited to become president of American Assn. of Advertising Agencies. After all, he had never been in the ad business. What he knew, he knew only as a reporter and editor. But the qualities of intellect and leadership which made him so valuable to us impressed Marion HARPER, Jr. and Norman STROUSE, who had a decisive influence in the selection. He became convinced that this was a role where his impact on the growth of the industry could be more direct. In subsequent years, a wall necessarily existed between John and his former colleagues; and we differed - sharply - on many occasions. But we followed, with admiration, the improved effectiveness of the Four A's. In journalism, he despised mediocrity and at the Four A's he battled incessantly against parochialism. He had firm vision of what he considered right and good. For those who fell short, he was a stern taskmaster. These have been years when advertising has been called to account as never before. In John CRICHTON, the Four A's had a president who was an honest-to-goodness scholar, not only of the business, but of the world around us. He was first among those who insisted that challenges be met honestly, realistically and in the context of higher public interest. His was a great talent given generously and unpretentiously for the benefit of the marketing profession and our American society.\n\nAdvertising Age, 2 Jan 1978. Many pay tribute to John CRICHTON. New York - The impact of John CRICHTON's leadership role in advertising was highlighted by the many comments from people in and associated with advertising, following Mr. CRICHTON's death Dec. 27. Esther PETERSON, assistant to President CARTER, said: \"From the beginning of my work in consumerism, I have known John CRICHTON, as a representative of the advertising business. He brought reason and civility to the conference table, and helped all of us find our way through the tangles of misunderstanding. He enabled me to understand the importance of advertising and its great potential. he had a way of sifting out differences so they could be examined in terms of high principle. Much that has been accomplished in recent years would have been impossible without him.\" Robert KEIM, president, Advertising Council: \"He stood tall among us and will always remain so in our hearts as we continue the work that he endowed so magnificently.\" Peter W. ALLPORT, president, Assn. of National Advertisers, said, \"In his years with the Four A's, and during his years with Advertising Age as well, John provided all of us with a keen and imaginative perspective on advertising needs. And he was a good ambassador: When he spoke for us, advertising could 'stand tall'.\" Roger D. RICE, president, Television Bureau of Advertising, said, \"both broadcaster and advertising agency have lost a friend. And advertising has lost a professional.\" Charles S. MILL, president, American Business Press, said: \"He was a great business publication editor who became a leader of the advertising world. He brought a high sense of integrity to his world and ours.\" \"I was greatly honored to have him as a close friend and as a business associate,\" noted Stephen E. KELLY, president, Magazine Publishers Assn. \"He was a man of great intellect, dignity and integrity. We of the magazine business will sorely miss him, but the great work he's done will continue on.\" Ed ROLL, president of the Advertising Research Foundation of which Mr. CRICHTON was a founder, said: \"John was a loyal and involved member of our board. The professionalism he represented as a leader of the Four A's, as well as his humanity, have been and always will be an inspiration to me and to the industry.\" Mr. CRICHTON's successor will serve on the 27-member board of ARF. David J. CLEARY, Jr., senior vp and group publisher of Crain Communications, publisher of Advertising Age, said, \"The advertising business has lost its most articulate spokesman. John CRICHTON was a brilliant man who performed his life's tasks with diligence and integrity. He was a true student of the business he represented so well.

Born in Colorado, she graduated from Northwestern University in Chicago with a degree in Music in 1940. Her love of music infused every aspect of her rich, long life. Later that year she married her childhood sweetheart, John Henderson CRICHTON, an advertising man. Mr. CRICHTON, then President of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, died in 1977. A gifted pianist, she tirelessly advocated for creative arts education in public schools and the improvement of libraries. She served as a Trustee of the Bryant Library in Roslyn, Long Island, and a Board member of the New Canaan Library; appropriate for a lifelong bibliophile. In her sixties she became an enthusiastic volunteer teacher of English as a second language and worked to reduce adult illiteracy. She was always dashing off to a lecture or a study group. A resident of New Canaan, Connecticut for more than fifty years, she served as an Elder of the First Presbyterian Church. She and Georges Brigham, a technical consultant and the founder and chairman of the APL Group, were joyously married there on December 6, 1997. She is survived by her sister, Mrs. Jean SAYRE; her husband, Georges BRIGHAM; three children, Kimberly, Douglas and Catherine CRICHTON; five grandchildren and two great-grandsons. Her eldest son, the author Michael CRICHTON, died in 2008. Her birthday this year, April 24, 2011, is Easter Sunday. Peace. A memorial service will be held for Zula CRICHTON-BRIGHAM on Saturday, March 26, at the First Presbyterian Church of New Canaan, at 2:00 p.m., followed by a reception at Bliss House.

CBS. Best-Selling Author Michael CRICHTON Dies. Best-selling author and filmaker Michael CRICHTON died unexpectedly in Los Angeles Tuesday, after a courageous and private battle against cancer, according to a statement released by his family. He was 66. CRICHTON is best known as the author of \"Jurassic Park\" and the creator of \"ER.\" His most recent novel, \"Next,\" about genetics and law, was published in December 2006. \"While the world knew him as a great storyteller that challenged our preconceived notions about the world around us - and entertained us while doing so - his wife Sherri, daughter Taylor, family and friends knew Michael CRICHTON as a devoted husband, loving father and generous friend who inspired each of us to strive to see the wonders of our world through new eyes, the statement said. \"He did this with a wry sense of humour that those who were privileged to know him personally will never forget. Through his books, Michael CRICHTON served as an inspiration to students of all ages, challenged scientists in many fields, and illuminated the mysteries of the world in a way we could all understand. He will be profoundly missed by those whose lives he touched, but he leaves behind the greatest gifts of a thirst for knowledge, the desire to understand, and the wisdom to use our minds to better our world,\" the statement added. Born in Chicago, Oct. 23, 1942, CRICHTON graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College, received his MD from Harvard Medical School, and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, researching public policy with Jacob BRONOWSKI. He has taught courses in anthropology at Cambridge University and writing at MIT. CRICHTON's 2004 bestseller, \"State of Fear,\" acknowledged the world was growing warmer, but challenged extreme anthropogenic warming scenarios. CRICHTON's first bestseller, The Andromeda Strain, was published while he was still a medical student. He later worked full time on film and writing. One of the most popular writers in the world, his books have been translated into thirty-six languages, and thirteen have been made into films. CRICHTON won an Emmy, a Peabody, and a Writer's Guild of America Award for \"ER.\" In 2002, a newly-discovered ankylosaur was named for him: Crichtonsaurus bohlini. A private funeral service is expected, but no further details will be released to the public.\n\nObituary. Times Online, 5 Nov 2008. Patrick FOSTER, Media Correspondent. Michael CRICHTON, the bestselling author behind the fictional world of Jurassic Park, died today at the age of 66 after a battle with cancer that he hid from the public eye. CRICHTON, author of more than a dozen best-selling novels and creator of the medical drama series, ER, died in Los Angeles, a statement from his family, posted on the writer's website, said. Describing his fight with cancer as \"courageous and private,\" the statement said: \"While the world knew him as a great storyteller that challenged our preconceived notions about the world around us - and entertained us while doing so - his family and friends knew Michael CRICHTON as a devoted husband, loving father and generous friend who inspired each of us to strive to see the wonders of our world through new eyes. He did this with a wry sense of humour that those who were privileged to know him personally will never forget.\" The son of a journalist, CRICHTON was born in 1942 in Chicago, Illinois, but grew up in New York state. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University before tutoring at Cambridge University in anthropology and later registering at Harvard Medical School. During his medical training, he began to secretly write novels, writing under a pseudonym, but was eventually outed after A Case of Need, which he wrote using the alias Jeffery Hudson, won the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Allan Poe Award, in 1968. CRICHTON, whose books have sold more than 150 million copies worldwide, was heavily influenced by his scientific training, and often conjured up visions of dystopian worlds that bore the brunt of botched attempts at scientific advancement. His first bestseller, The Andromeda Strain, which speculated upon the devastating effects of an extraterrestrial micro-organism infecting the human race, was published while he was still a medical student. Thirteen of his books were turned into films, including Jurassic Park, which told of recreating dinosaurs via DNA of the beasts contained in blood within preserved mosquitoes. The film, directed by Steven SPIELBERG and released in 1993, took nearly $1 billion worldwide, and in 2002 CRICHTON had a newly-discovered ankylosaur named for him: Crichtonsaurus bohlini. On the small screen he was the creator of ER, the American hospital drama in which George CLOONEY shot to fame. The project was originally set to be a film., also directed by SPIELBERG, who put it on ice in order to make Jurassic Park. CRICHTON won an Emmy, a Peabody, and a Writer's Guild of America Award for the programme. He also had an interest in computers, and Westworld, another of his films, was the first movie to utilise computer-generated special effects, in 1973. His passion for the technique in film production led him to being awarded Technical Achievement Academy Award in 1995. Physically a dominant figure, at 6ft 9in, he found an unlikely ally in President BUSH, with whom he shared a skeptical view of global warming. His 2004 novel, State of Fear, was condemned by environmentalists, but CRICHTON maintained that his conclusions were misrepresented. CRICHTON had a turbulent lovelife, marrying five times, four of which ended in divorce. His daughter, Taylor, is from his fourth wife, Anne-Marie MARTIN, with whom he wrote the 1996 film, Twister. At the time of his death, he was married to Sherri ALEXANDER, a 45-year-old actress. The family statement added: \"Through his books, Michael CRICHTON served as an inspiration to students of all ages, challenged scientists in many fields, and illuminated the mysteries of the world in a way we could all understand. He will be profoundly missed by those whose lives he touched, but he leaves behind the greatest gifts of a thirst for knowledge, the desire to understand, and the wisdom to use our minds to better our world.\" CRICHTON's family said that he would have a private funeral , and requested that their privacy be respected.\n\nSource: Zula CRICHTON, New Canaan, CT; Dale and Deborah Morrow\n\nBack to Jonathan Henderson Back to Top Back to Family Chronicles\n\n12.7a2__Kimberly CRICHTON\n\nb. 22 Jul 1945, Ft.
