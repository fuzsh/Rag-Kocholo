        "text": "I had the absolute pleasure of participating in the first Alumni webinar with The Switch, where we delved into the possibilities offered by universities and apprenticeships. Representing Queen Mary University of London, I shared insights on several key topics: ‚úàÔ∏è Global opportunities: Drawing from my experience as a medical student with two international placements in Malta and various scholarships, including those in Brazil, I discussed how these experiences have enriched my academic journey and post-graduation prospects ü´Ç Student support: Super important to know and use the university's support services, as a means of aiding academic progress ‚öΩÔ∏è Societies and student groups: Highlighting the importance of extracurricular activities, it‚Äôs very important to maintain passions outside of academia; the skills developed through these ans the experiences gained are just as vital üìö Ways to learn: I described the different ways courses are taught at university and how these styles overlap. Additionally that the way in which a programme is taught is an important factor to consider when choosing a university/course/programme ‚ú® Making the choice: I touched upon the variety of factors that influence one‚Äôs decision-making process, such as location, programme content, assessment formats, career prospects, and more. These different variables hold different values between individuals It was a pleasure addressing student questions during the webinar, and I look forward to further opportunities to engage in such discussions! If you have any questions about university, medical school, or higher education in general, feel free to drop me a message ü©µ #outreach #university #alumni #wideningparticipation #academia #studentlife"
