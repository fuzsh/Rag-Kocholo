        "text": "Marc MacMillan, a four-year letterman for the Ole Miss baseball team during the 1990s, has spent four seasons as a volunteer assistant coach at Ole Miss, as well as two as the director of operations.\n\nAlong with serving as the team's first base coach, MacMillan works with the outfielders, assists in coaching the hitters and oversaw base running starting in 2018—a season that saw the Rebels finish fourth in the SEC in stolen bases, increasing their total from 38 in 2017 to 66 in 2018. The Rebels upped the ante in 2019, tying a program record with 93 stolen bases, a mark set during the 2014 run to the College World Series.\n\nIn four seasons, Ole Miss outfielders have recorded 51 assists under MacMillan's watch. During the 2017 campaign, he converted Thomas Dillard and Will Golsan into starting outfielders. Dillard came to campus as a highly-touted freshman catcher, and Golsan spent his first two seasons as a starter on the right side of the Ole Miss infield. MacMillan also helped Ryan Olenek make a comfortable move from the corner outfield positions to center field, where he showcased more of his athleticism and speed. Olenek and Golsan led the Rebels with five outfield assists apiece.\n\nGolsan was superb as the starting center fielder for Ole Miss in 2018. He made numerous spectacular plays while anchoring the Rebel outfield, making just two errors all season. Golsan also hit .304 and was named to the SEC and NCAA Oxford Regional All-Tournament teams. The Senior CLASS Award Candidate wrapped up a tremendous career as a Rebel and was selected in the 26th round by the Colorado Rockies in the 2018 MLB Draft.\n\nOlenek turned in an incredible 2018 campaign as well. As the team's starting right fielder, Olenek hit a team-best .350 en route to first-team All-SEC honors. He finished the season as the toughest player to strike out in the conference, much thanks to a 23-game hitting streak—the second-longest in the SEC during the 2018 season and tied for the third-longest in program history. Under MacMillan's tutelage, Olenek was also named a C Spire Ferriss Trophy Finalist and was drafted in the 17th round by the San Francisco Giants but elected to return for his senior season.\n\nIn 2019, MacMillan helped to convert another infielder, Anthony Servideo, into an outstanding defensive outfielder. The athletic middle infielder transitioned quickly under MacMillan's guidance, starting a total of 40 games in the outfield as a sophomore, making numerous spectacular plays along the way, including a team-high four outfield assists. At season's end, Thomas Dillard was selected out of the Rebel outfield in the fifth round of the 2019 MLB Draft, becoming the fifth outfielder drafted under MacMillan's watch. Injuries also forced one of MacMillan's young prospects to be thrust into action early. Freshman Josh Hall impressed as he earned nine starts in the outfield and was 10-of-11 stealing bases along the way.\n\nMacMillan's coaching made an immediate impact in his first season directing the outfielders. Ole Miss outfielders tallied 17 assists during the 2016 season, just one off the school record of 18 set in 2014. Of the 17 assists, 10 were outs at home to prevent runs from scoring. Center fielder J.B. Woodman, a second team All-American, led the way with nine assists. Under MacMillan's guidance, Woodman earned a spot on the SEC All-Defense team before being selected in the second round of the Major League Baseball Draft by the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nPrior to being promoted to a coaching role, MacMillan spent two seasons as the Rebels’ director of operations. In that role, he was responsible for the daily operations of the program including planning team travel/meals, working with the program’s budget, dealing with equipment orders and acting as one of the program’s liaisons to other members of the athletic department. MacMillan also directed the Diamond Girls, a group of female Ole Miss students who serve as the ambassadors for Ole Miss Baseball and assist in gameday operations, the Ernie LaBarge Bullpen Club and community service events throughout Lafayette County.\n\nBefore returning to Ole Miss, MacMillan was the associate head coach at the University of Arkansas - Pine Bluff. He spent three years at UAPB, working with the pitchers, infielders and base runners, while also coordinating the program’s recruiting efforts plus strength and conditioning programs.\n\nIn 2013, MacMillan coached a pitching staff that led the conference in ERA, helping lead UAPB to the program’s first SWAC Tournament appearance since the 2009 season. His recruiting classes stretched from coast-to-coast and aided UAPB’s back-to-back Western Division titles in 2014 and 2015. MacMillan’s recruits included Jordan Sechler, a 19th round draft pick of the 2013 MLB Draft by the Atlanta Braves; Isias Alcantar, 2013 SWAC Player of the Year, first and second team All-SWAC selection, and 2014 34th round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Rays; Andre Davis, first team All-SWAC selection and 2015 7th round draft pick of the Kansas City Royals; and Kevin Walsh, first team All-SWAC and 2015 MLB 21st round draft pick of the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nPrior to his time at UAPB, MacMillan served as the recruiting coordinator and pitching coach at the University of Arkansas - Monticello for the 2010 season. Before his coaching stint at UAM, MacMillan served as the head coach at Crichton College. He also served as an associate scout for the Seattle Mariners and as head coach at Memphis University School.\n\nMacMillan played for the Rebels from 1993-96 where he was a utility player under head coach and All-American Donnie Kessinger. He was a part of the 1995 NCAA Regional team that won 40 games and fell to Florida State in the Regional Championship game with a berth in the College World Series on the line."
