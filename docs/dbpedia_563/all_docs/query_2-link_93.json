        "text": "Barry Sanders, former star running back for Oklahoma State and the Detroit Lions, will receive the PwC Doak Walker Legends Award, the PwC SMU Athletic Forum announced Thursday.\n\nThe award was created in 1998 to honor former running backs that excelled at the collegiate level and went on to distinguish themselves as leaders in their communities.\n\nSanders will accept his trophy at the Doak Walker Award banquet on Feb. 19 in Dallas. Sanders joins an impressive list of past recipients:\n\nBo Jackson (2014), Floyd Little (2013), Jim Brown (2012), Tommy McDonald (2011), Jim Taylor (2010), Eric Dickerson and Craig James (2009), Calvin Hill (2008), Marcus Allen (2007), Walter Payton (2006), Jim Swink (2005), John David Crow (2004), Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis (2003), Earl Campbell (2002), Tony Dorsett (2001), Pete Dawkins (2000), Archie Griffin (1999), and Gale Sayers (1998).\n\nDuring his lone season as the starting running back in 1988, Sanders was an All-American and winner of the Heisman Trophy in what is widely considered the greatest individual season in college football history.\n\nSanders set 34 NCAA records, including 2,628 yards rushing and 37 touchdowns, records that still stand to this day. He rushed for more than 200 yards in the final six games of his career and eclipsed 300 yards three times in that span, giving him four 300+-yard games during the season.\n\nSanders was the third overall pick in the 1989 NFL Draft and proceeded to win the Offensive Rookie of the Year award that year as he rushed for 1,470 yards and 14 touchdowns. In his second season, he won his first of four NFL rushing titles. Sanders' greatest NFL season came in 1997 when he tallied 2,053 yards, becoming just the third player at the time to amass at least 2,000 yards rushing.\n\nSanders retired following the 1999 season as the second-leading rusher in NFL history and currently sits third on the all-time list.\n\nSanders is a member of the College and Pro Football Halls of Fame and appeared in 10 Pro Bowls, as well as six times being voted first-team All-Pro and four times second-team All-Pro.\n\n\"Barry Sanders' NCAA single-season rushing record may be one of the greatest college accomplishments of our day and his NFL career was just as prolific,\" said Scott Moore, PwC North Texas Managing Partner. \"We honor Barry, not only as a phenomenal athlete, but also as an individual who believes in the importance of education and providing opportunities to underprivileged children.\"\n\nDoak Walker epitomized leadership, sportsmanship, and academic and athletic achievement during his outstanding career at SMU.\n\nWalker was a three-time All-America choice who won the Heisman Trophy as a junior in 1948, was a first round draft pick of the Detroit Lions, led the team to NFL championships in 1952 and 1953, and was chosen All-Pro four times. Walker is a member of both the College and Pro Football Halls of Fame.\n\nAbout the PwC SMU Athletic Forum\n\nHonoring the legends of sports for 26 years, the PwC SMU Athletic Forum celebrates outstanding success in athletics. Based in Dallas, the series features major figures from a variety of sports. The PwC SMU Athletic Forum includes four luncheons and the prestigious Doak Walker Award Presentation Banquet."
