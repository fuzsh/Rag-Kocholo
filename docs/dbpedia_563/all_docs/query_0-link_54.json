And she who\n\nlives there, who is she? How has she changed\n\nsince 1910? 1940 or 1960? What are her questions?\n\nHow does she find the answers? And most\n\nimportant, why has she continued to come to\n\nAgnes Scott since 1890? The essence . . . the\n\nspirit . . . the magic what is it that makes\n\nAgnes Scott a special place? That makes her a\n\nspecial woman? The 1971-72 series of Alumnae\n\nQuarterlies will focus on Agnes Scott College\n\nher position in a changing world, her influence\n\nand what she has meant to alumnae, the life and\n\ntimes of the contemporary Agnes Scott student,\n\nthe value of her rare brand of education.\n\nWhy bother? Because it is time for us to\n\nbecome aware of our responsibilities as alumnae\n\nfor support and concern. Because Agnes Scott\n\nis worth it.\n\nFirst, lets look at Agnes Scotfs position in the\n\ncurrent, kaleidoscopic world. Dean Julia Gary\n\nanswers some blunt questions in a speech\n\ndelivered to an Agnes Scott Alumnae Club and\n\nadapted for us:\n\nWhether we like it or not, we must face\n\nthe fact that higher education in the United\n\nStates is in a state of crisis. It is believed\n\nby many authorities that this state of crisis\n\nwill persist at least through the 1970's. In\n\nmid-summer of 1971, it was estimated that\n\nthere were 400,000 empty spaces in American\n\ncolleges and universities and that at least\n\n20,000 of these spaces would remain empty\n\nwhen colleges opened in the fall. In a recent\n\nreport issued by the Association of American\n\nColleges, it is predicted that fifty percent of\n\nall private accredited four-year institutions\n\nwill be closed in ten years. The same report\n\nstates that over sixty percent of the private\n\ninstitutions in the United States had operating\n\ndeficits in the 1970-71 fiscal year. These deficits\n\nranged from $2,000 to $4,000,000.\n\nMany institutions, especially private colleges,\n\nreport sharp declines in enrollment and\n\npredict that this will continue. Some very\n\nrespectable colleges are attempting to recruit\n\nnew students from the waiting lists of the\n\nmore fortunate institutions; others have re-\n\nquested lists of students who have been\n\nexcluded for academic reasons, with the hope\n\nthat these students may be attracted to their\n\ncollege.\n\nWhile many colleges and universities are\n\nbeing forced to cut faculty and to increase\n\nclass size as an economy measure, the market\n\nis flooded with competent and well-trained\n\nyoung scholars, ready to assume teaching\n\npositions. At contract time last spring, many\n\ncolleges voluntarily froze salaries, some even\n\ncut salaries before the current wage price\n\nfreeze.\n\nPrivate colleges have been forced to raise\n\ntheir fees, increasing the demands for\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\nThe Magic\n\n{Continued)\n\nscholarships to meet the tuition rise and to\n\nease family financial burdens produced\n\nbecause of national economic trends.\n\nAt the same time, there is the stark realiza-\n\ntion that some of the top students in the\n\n1971 high school graduation classes simply\n\nhave decided not to attend college at the\n\npresent time.\n\nAgnes Scott College is not immune to all\n\nof these trends. It would be easy for us to be\n\ndiscouraged, depressed, pessimistic. This is\n\nnot, however, the climate on the Agnes Scott\n\ncampus. Agnes Scott is so very much more\n\nfortunate than many colleges that she\n\ncan accept the crisis as a challenge to best\n\nefforts.\n\nA number of circumstances make it possible\n\nfor this college to accept the crisis as a\n\nchallenge rather than as impending doom.\n\nOne of the most notable among these is the\n\nvery wise handling of the college's invested\n\nfunds. A second reason is surely the fact that\n\nour enrollment of 673 is down only about 25\n\nfrom the usual 700. Increased alumnae giving,\n\nas recognized by the award from U. S. Steel\n\nfor sustained giving to the annual fund, is an\n\nadditional contributing factor. As a result of\n\nthese financial considerations, Agnes Scott\n\noperated in the black for the 1970-71 session\n\nand is not predicting an operating deficit for\n\nthe current fiscal year. Last, but by no\n\nmeans least, is the splendid spirit of coopera-\n\ntion among faculty and administration and the\n\nevident loyalty of the alumnae.\n\nWe cannot, indeed we must not, become\n\ncomplacent. The scholarship budget, already\n\nup to $236,000 in 1971-72 from $200,000 in\n\n1970-71, will, in all probability, have to be\n\nincreased further. Because Agnes Scott is a\n\nsmall college, demanding academic excellence,\n\nthere is a spiraling need for visiting scholars,\n\nspecial lecturers, and seminars led by noted\n\nauthorities. There is a marked rise in the\n\ncost of plant maintenance, due in part to an\n\nunexpected increase in federally enforced un-\n\nemployment benefits and an anticipated rise\n\nin the minimum wage. There is a growing need\n\nfor new physical facilities on the campus, a\n\nstudent union and a gymnasium among them.\n\nWe must continue to give modest increases\n\nin faculty salaries, an item to which President\n\nAlston has always given top priority. Especial-\n\nly on the part of our new and younger\n\nfaculty, there is a desire for increased\n\nfinancial support of faculty research.\n\nWhat are we doing to meet the challenge?\n\nOne of the most obvious commitments is to\n\nan increase in the scope and type of recruit-\n\nment efforts. The addition of an assistant\n\nto the Director of Admissions gives a total\n\nof three young women who will spend a\n\ngreat portion of their time traveling to\n\nsecondary schools, both private and public,\n\nand to junior colleges to acquaint students\n\nand counselors with Agnes Scott. In addition,\n\nthe Alumnae Office in cooperation with the\n\nAdmissions Office, is now launching a program\n\ninvolving selected alumnae more actively in\n\nthe recruitment process.\n\nThe recent appointment of a committee on\n\npublications is an attempt to improve\n\nthe public image of the college. This com-\n\nmittee will review all printed material,\n\nbrochures, and pamphlets which go to\n\nprospective students, schools, alumnae, and\n\nfriends of the college, and will plan for the\n\nproduction of slides and film strips.\n\nNewly inaugurated flexibility in admission\n\nrequirements allows the substitution of the\n\nAmerican College Testing Program for the\n\nmore traditional College Entrance Examination\n\nBoard tests. Certain exceptionally well qualified\n\nfreshmen are now being accepted on early\n\nadmission, a program whereby a student comes\n\nto Agnes Scott before completing her\n\nhigh school work. The recent inauguration\n\nof joint enrollment programs for high school\n\nstudents in the Atlanta area will allow students\n\nto be enrolled in both Agnes Scott and a\n\npublic high school, earning college credit and\n\nreceiving a high school diploma at the end of\n\nthe session.\n\nAn intensive study of curriculum and degree\n\nrequirements now underway is an attempt to\n\nmake the educational experience in the 1970's\n\nas meaningful to present students as the ex-\n\nperience was to alumnae five, twenty-five or\n\nfifty years ago.\n\nAnd so they speak, these alumnae of Agnes Scott.\n\nFrom 7976, 7940, 7962, and 1971, they speak of\n\nwhat she has meant to them, what she stands for,\n\nwhat the educational experience is all about\n\n(he Magic.\n\nMary Ellen Harvey Newton '76, civic leader,\n\ncommunity worker, loyal supporter of Agnes Scott,\n\nlooks backward fifty-five years:\n\nFrom Agnes Scott-My Passport for Life\n\nBy MARY ELLEN HARVEY NEWTON '16\n\nThere are certain qualifications that have to\n\nbe met to be granted a passport. When these\n\nqualifications are met and the passport is\n\ngranted, the owner can travel far away, go\n\nplaces, and do things. My passport from Agnes\n\nScott has brought me great satisfaction; it has\n\ngiven me many privileges; however, it has\n\nmade me shoulder many responsibilities. In\n\nearning this Agnes Scott passport I was taught\n\nto learn, to live and to love.\n\nAs a member of the Class of 1916 I was\n\npresent at the twenty-fifth, the fiftieth and the\n\nseventy-fifth anniversary of the College.\n\nPerish the thought of my attending the one\n\nhundredth, but who knows? I have known\n\nall three presidents of Agnes Scott. Each one\n\nof these men has influenced my thinking and\n\nmy activities.\n\nIn 1916 few women went to college. Most\n\nof my friends were married after graduating\n\nfrom high school. My parents said \"We will\n\nsend her off to school; that will put off mar-\n\nriage for a while.\" I was very young and imma-\n\nture but not immature enough to want to\n\ngo to a finishing school. One of my high\n\nschool teachers had been to Wellesley. She\n\npreached \"going to college\" to a group of us,\n\nand made us see the wisdom of seeking a real\n\neducation. My life had been one of gaiety,\n\nsinging, dancing, and playing.\n\nWhen I entered college, this dancing, sing-\n\ning and playing had to be tempered by\n\nstudying, not studying just a little but studying\n\nhard. This I had to do if I made the grade at\n\nAgnes Scott. One day one of my professors\n\nsaid to me \"I think you waste a lot of time.\n\nCan't you organize your time?\" I learned the\n\nart of not wasting time, of planning my study-\n\ning, my activities, and my leisure hours. I have\n\ncontinued to organize throughout my life\n\nwhether it be a meetng or a party. I learned\n\nto organize at Agnes Scott.\n\nGerman was my major subject. It was\n\ndifficult. In learning German I found the full\n\nmeaning of mental discipline. The mind must\n\nbe disciplined; it must be managed; it must\n\nbe trained to think, to act, to work out the\n\nproblems of living. Little is this realized by a\n\ncollege student. To the student, studying is\n\ndone to learn a specific subject. Seldom does\n\nshe know about the long-term training being\n\ngained by hard study.\n\nToday I take great pleasure in learning.\n\nThere is an insatiable desire to know about\n\nmany things, both old and new. This longing\n\nfor knowledge came from study at College.\n\nI love new ideas, new developments of old\n\nideas. I find great pleasure in reviewing worth-\n\nwhile things already learned. Memory is a\n\nreal treasure. It is satisfactory to pull German\n\nwords and phrases out of my memory, German\n\nthat I learned more than fifty-six years ago.\n\nI enjoyed speaking the German that I remem-\n\nbered on German ships, where the waiters and\n\nsome passengers knew little English. How their\n\nfaces would light up when an American came\n\nout with some German phrase or a bit of long\n\nremembered German verse. It has also been\n\nsatisfactory, with the help of one who knows\n\nmore Latin than I, to translate a motto on a\n\nfamily coat of arms. The most fun of all\n\nis to pull out of the past some French\n\nexpressions and to chatter about a Latin phrase\n\n\"Gaudeamus igitur semper\" with a much-loved\n\ngranddaughter.\n\nMore than being taught to learn, Agnes Scott\n\ntaught me how to live maybe this is a strange\n\ncommentary but at Agnes Scott I learned\n\nhow to live not by studying but by doing.\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\nMy Passport for Life\n\nBeing president of a student organization gave\n\nexcellent training. We learned how to preside\n\nat a meeting, how to handle the order of busi-\n\nness, how to make up committees, how to\n\nchoose chairmen, above all, how to work with\n\npeople. The jobs had to be done. The right\n\npeople had to be found to do the specific\n\npieces of work. If possible, everybody must be\n\nmade important. In Red Cross activities,\n\npatriotic organizations, parent and teacher\n\ngroups, and church groups, many times I\n\nhave said \"Thank you\" to Agnes Scott for\n\ntraining that came to me through extra-cur-\n\nricular activities. Unknowingly, I was learning\n\nmany things; especially was I learning how to\n\norganize and how to work with people.\n\nAgnes Scott taught me the lesson of listening\n\nto others, and it taught me to think clearly.\n\nIn working with people, we feel they want to\n\nbe heard. A good listener may become a good\n\nfriend. Being able to listen keeps a member\n\non any board. Listening gives time to crystalize\n\nthinking.\n\nWorking in Blackfriars, the newly organized\n\ndramatic society, taught me many lessons.\n\nThrough experiences in acting and speaking,\n\nwe learned to appear before the public without\n\nhaving \"shaking knees.\" We learned to sense\n\nthe feeling of an audience, whether they liked\n\nus or not. It is interesting to watch an audience\n\nfor its reaction. Maybe that audience is not\n\nbeing held and we change our tactics to renew\n\nthe audience's attention. I was armed with\n\nthese things when I became a teacher and\n\nlater when I made many talks for the Red Cross,\n\nand when I served on the Decatur City School\n\nBoard. I spoke to many different groups, to\n\nmany types of people, both white and black,\n\nand I always went back thankfully to my Agnes\n\nScott training.\n\nHOASC was founded my senior year.\n\nThis organization was made up of those who\n\nhad given unselfish service to Agnes Scott.\n\nLater HOASC became Mortar Board. When\n\none of my daughters was initiated into that\n\norganization, I had the privilege of joining\n\nwith her. Now I have a granddaughter, Class\n\nof 1970, who is also a member of Mortar\n\nBoard.\n\n(Continued)\n\nMary Ellen Harvey Newton '16 and her husband Henry\n\nEdgar Newton in June, 1971 , shortly before their golden\n\nwedding anniversary\n\nService played a great part in the life at\n\nAgnes Scott. In learning to serve our alma\n\nmater, we learned to serve our community.\n\nIn 1916 the YWCA was a potent factor at\n\nAgnes Scott. Students practiced Christian\n\nFellowship and made an effort to carry it to\n\nothers. Through the YWCA I began to work\n\nwith a group at the Settlement House of\n\nFulton Bag and Cotton Mill. Because it was\n\nlocated far away from Agnes Scott, we traveled\n\non the street car for part of our journey and\n\nthen walked many blocks to our destination.\n\nWhen we got off the streetcar we were always\n\nmet by a group from Emory. Miss Hopkins had\n\nbeen assured that these were \"fine young\n\ngentlemen\" who escorted us through the\n\ndilapidated mill village and through a long\n\nand dark underpass. For the first time in my\n\nlife I learned to know, to love, and to work\n\nwith mill people and the underprivileged. This\n\nexperience led me after graduation to work\n\nwith the underprivileged in North Montgomery,\n\nwhere there were factories of different kinds.\n\nI also helped direct Girl's Club at the YWCA.\n\nAt Agnes Scott I learned to love those who\n\nneeded love.\n\nAgnes Scott also taught me to love the Lord.\n\nThere was a strong religious influence; it was\n\nsort of atmospheric. At Agnes Scott I was\n\ntaught to give God's message. I remember the\n\nfirst Vespers that I ever led. The worship\n\nservice for that particular time was based on\n\nthe Biblical passage \"Judge not lest ye be\n\njudged Ask and it shall be given unto you,\n\nseek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be\n\nopened unto you.\" When we came from the\n\nChapel after Vespers, we trooped through\n\nthe hall of Main Building, passing Dr. Gaines'\n\noffice where he always stood in the door,\n\nbowing to each girl as she passed. That evening\n\nhe stopped me, commenting that he enjoyed\n\nVespers. However, he began to shake his head\n\ncovered with white, white hair and he said\n\n\"But you misquoted; look up that passage and\n\nquote it right.\" I had misquoted; I had said\n\n\"lest ye be not judged.\" Often I have thought\n\nof his words, \"Quote right.\" Those two words\n\nare full of meaning. That passage then as now\n\nis often uppermost in my mind \"I was asking;\n\nI was seeking; I was knocking.\" I am still\n\ndoing these things.\n\nThe Agnes Scott passport was granted to me.\n\nWithout it, I could not have gone as far. It\n\nhas taken me places and has enabled me to\n\naccomplish many things. The best thing Agnes\n\nScott did for me was to take me into\n\nmatrimony. My husband, now of fifty years,\n\nwould not have looked at me a second time\n\nhad I not been to Agnes Scott. I believe my\n\nhusband and a distant cousin of his have more\n\nAgnes Scott alumnae kin than any other men.\n\nThere have been cousins, aunts, sisters,\n\ndaughters and wives since the very beginning\n\nof Agnes Scott til 1970.\n\nSo Agnes Scott is dear to me and Agnes\n\nScott has motivated me through my long life.\n\nI cherish my Agnes Scott passport that has\n\nled me to learn, to live, and to love.\n\nScholar, writer, teacher, Eleanor Hutchens '40,\n\nspeaks from her combined experiences as a student,\n\na professor, and an alumna of Agnes Scott:\n\nGood Fences Make Good Colleges\n\nBy ELEANOR N. HUTCHENS '40\n\nWhen in the mid-1930's I began to look\n\nfor a college, my ambition in life was simple:\n\nto learn a lot. My nature was essentially ac-\n\nquisitive. At home I was known as such a\n\nmiser that once when a godparent gave me a\n\npresent my mother, who loved to spend, said,\n\n\"Poor little five-dollar bill! It'll never see the\n\nlight of day again.\" I was known also as\n\nsuch a bookworm that if the telephone inter-\n\nrupted my reading I would sleepwalk to it,\n\nanswer it, say, \"Yes, just a minute,\" and\n\nsomnambulate back to my book not only\n\nwithout notifying the person called but without\n\nremembering that there had been a call.\n\nWhen I came across a poem I coveted, I\n\nmemorized it and said it over and over to\n\nmyself. One year I said all of The Rubaiyat of\n\nOmar Khayyam in the dark every night after\n\nI went to bed; another year it was Gray's\n\nElegy. They were squirreled away with all the\n\nmoney I had ever gotten hold of.\n\nIn high school, English was my least favorite\n\nsubject because it was so easy. I thought it\n\nought not to be taught in school, any more\n\nthan breathing was. This must also have\n\nbeen the view of the school authorities, who\n\nemployed teachers of biology or Spanish and\n\nassigned them English classes in addition. What\n\nI liked was Latin, which I had longed for\n\never since I had found out there was such a\n\ndifficult mystery and which was taught by a\n\nspirited young woman from Bellbuckle,\n\nTennessee, a former day student at the Webb\n\nSchool for boys, where Latin was queen of the\n\nsciences. Then there was chemistry, which\n\nwas also good and hard; I would major in\n\nit at college because there was money in it.\n\nAmerican history and French crackled briskly\n\nalong under a humorous Agnes Scott graduate\n\nwho told me she thought I would like her\n\nalma mater because it was hard.\n\nNobody in my family knew anything about\n\nAgnes Scott; my mother and grandmother\n\nhad gone to boarding schools in Virginia,\n\nwhich therefore seemed the natural place to\n\nseek education. I wrote off for many\n\ncatalogues and read them earnestly as they\n\ncame. One day I opened the one from Agnes\n\nScott; an electrifying phrase jumped up from\n\nthe page into my head, and from that moment\n\nI never considered another college. \"High\n\nintellectual attainment\" that was what I was\n\nafter.\n\nThe discomforts and restrictions of Agnes\n\nScott in the 1930's combined those of the\n\nmonastery and the military camp, and I\n\ngloried in them. The only opulent, inviting\n\nplace was the new library, which had the most\n\nimpressive architecture, the brightest colors,\n\nand the most comfortable chairs on campus.\n\nOtherwise, all was what my reading about\n\nboys' boarding schools of the nineteenth\n\ncentury had prepared me to expect. I could\n\nnot understand the murmurings of my fellow\n\nstudents who wished the rigidities away;\n\nthey were part of the adventure. I expected\n\ncollege to conform not to my tastes but to\n\nsome stern Spartan standard far above con-\n\nvenience or even rationality. My delight in\n\nthe realization of this bookish dream had\n\nthe paradoxical effect of drawing me away\n\nfrom books themselves and into the life\n\naround me. A large part of my pleasure in the\n\nexperience of college was in its Gilbertian un-\n\nreason in daily affairs, a bracing atmosphere\n\nthat inspired me to a permanently prankish\n\nattitude that I have since recognized in novels\n\nabout undergraduate life at Oxford in the\n\nBeerbohm days beyond recall. I saw students,\n\nfaculty, and administration as engaged in\n\nan endless delightful charade whose central\n\nvalue was the comic, all the actors comedians\n\neither conscious or unconscious. One sought\n\none's friends among the conscious in order\n\nto laugh at the unconscious arrogantly, no\n\ndoubt, but in my case educational because I\n\nwas enjoying human character for the first\n\ntime.\n\nOne's first idea of an institution rarely\n\nsurvives long acquaintance with it. From\n\na distance it is a symbol, the incarnation of\n\nsome principle that perhaps belongs more\n\nto one's own imagination than to the thing it-\n\nself. From inside, it appears rather as a\n\nsystem, a pattern of persons and procedures\n\nin which the original conception may be\n\nobscured or even mocked.\n\nThe remarkable thing was that my idea of\n\nAgnes Scott as a temple of the mind did not\n\nsuffer in the least. Early in freshman\n\nEnglish, we were assigned an essay on why\n\nwe came to Agnes Scott. At ten on the\n\nnight before my eight-o'clock class, as I was\n\nwriting the climactic scene where, after many\n\ncatalogues on bathing in the Gulf and nestling\n\nin the Blue Ridge mountains, I had encoun-\n\ntered \"high intellectual attainment\" as I was\n\neagerly recounting this epiphany, the dormitory\n\nlights went out. Right on schedule. That was\n\nthe way the college made sure we got our\n\nsleep. The next morning I added a hasty\n\nconclusion and handed in my paper. My\n\ninstructor noted its bobtailed state, of course,\n\nand taxed me with it in theme conference. I\n\ntold her I had stopped writing because the\n\nlights had gone out. She rightly refused to\n\naccept this explanation as an excuse; I\n\nshould have started earlier. I don't think either\n\nof us noticed any incongruity between\n\nmy (and Agnes Scott's) blazing idealism and the\n\npolicy that doused the lights just as my\n\nheated pen was giving words to our faith.\n\nBut was it incongruity? Oxford and Cambridge\n\nhad ludicrous rules, some dating from\n\nmonastic times; maybe cerebration flourishes\n\namid them. Certainly such rules hone the sense\n\nof humor; as a teacher I don't hope ever\n\nagain to have the equal of Agnes Scott students\n\nfor that keenness. Nothing funny, however\n\nsubtle, is lost on an Agnes Scott class\n\nbeyond the sophomore year, and I think\n\nthe reason is that a relatively closed society\n\ngenerates laughter in those it restricts, as\n\nlong as they believe in their reasons for being\n\ninside.\n\nPerhaps the intellect too needs walls to\n\npush against. \"The university,\" says John\n\nDonne, \"is a paradise, rivers of knowledge\n\nare there, arts and sciences flow from thence.\n\nCounsel tables are horti conclusi (as it is said\n\nin the Canticles), gardens that are walled in,\n\nand they are fontes signati, wells that are sealed\n\nup; bottomless depths of unsearchable\n\ncounsels there.\" He is distinguishing between\n\ntwo kinds of earthly gardens before going on\n\nto recommend a divine one, but I strongly\n\nsuspect that the arts and sciences, and their\n\nprofessors, flourish most richly in the hortus\n\nconclusus. \"Be wise, / Ye Presidents and\n\nDeans!\" cries Wordsworth, inveighing against\n\ncompulsory chapel at Cambridge because\n\nstudent reluctance made a mockery of it; yet\n\nthere is the long roll of Cambridge poets and\n\nscientists, not to mention divines. \"I was\n\nthe Dreamer, they the Dream,\" he recalls,\n\nthinking of all the strange people and\n\nbuildings he saw through the eyes of a\n\ncountry boy. I think it very likely that college\n\nought to be as different from ordinary life as\n\npossible, and if quaintness and compulsory\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\nGood Fences\n\n(Continued)\n\nchapel help to seal the well, so be it.\n\nBy this I do not mean that the old rules\n\nought to be reinstated. I hope I'll never fall\n\ninto the particular imbecility of thinking every-\n\nthing should stay just as it was when I was\n\ntwenty; this is one of the fatuities of old age\n\nthat liberal education should protect us\n\nfrom. I mean something quite different: that\n\nthere should be such a thing as an academic\n\nsubculture, set off from the machinery of\n\nbreadwinning and social pressure, like an\n\nenclosed park in a city. Its differences from\n\nthe life outside ought to be created partially\n\nbut not mainly by the students, who after all\n\ncome to it with only outside experience\n\nto draw upon. (Hence, when left to pick\n\nvisiting speakers, they choose headliners and\n\ntelevision personalities who have already\n\nsaid their say through the mass media and\n\nhave nothing new to bring to the campus.)\n\nMainly, the faculty should create the dif-\n\nferences, by setting many difficult tasks the\n\nultimate aims of which the students can\n\nglimpse only dimly and which they must\n\ntherefore perform largely on faith, laughing at\n\nthe apparently pointless rigor the while. Of\n\ncourse the faculty must be as confident as\n\nconstant reassessment can make it that all\n\nthis labor really is the best that can be assigned\n\nfor the liberating of the mind and spirit, but\n\nbeyond introducing the student to the idea of\n\nliberal education and dropping a few\n\nremarks about the bodies of learning most\n\nlikely to bring it about when properly investi-\n\ngated, attempts to explain to students why the\n\nbachelor's degree is constituted as it is at any\n\ngiven college are, I think, not only useless\n\nbut, in current jargon, counterproductive.\n\nLet the student choose his college and proceed\n\non faith, ridiculing and protesting as he goes,\n\nbut stopping short of rupturing the bonds of\n\ntrust that identify his college as the particular\n\ninstitution it is.\n\nI attained no intellectual heights in\n\ncollege; the whole experience was too\n\nintoxicating for me to do much besides enjoy\n\nit; but I think I did see what high intellectual\n\nattainment was for instance, that it was much\n\nmore than acquisition, that its essentials could\n\nnot be amassed in just the way five-dollar\n\nbills could and what it demanded. The level\n\nat which English was taught at Agnes Scott\n\nshowed me that it was at least as respectable\n\nan academic subject as chemistry. Most\n\nimportant were the people who taught\n\nEnglish. I sat in their classes looking\n\nskeptical and making up parodic verses, but\n\nthey were winning all the time. Could they have\n\nbeen the extraordinary beings they were if\n\nAgnes Scott had been a more open society?\n\nI doubt it honestly and seriously. Fragrances\n\nare most intense in the hortus conclusus.\n\nI have never become disillusioned about\n\nAgnes Scott. With the stubbornness of the\n\nGeorgia mule, she has refused to budge on any\n\nquestion until she saw fit; and while she does\n\neventually move when the wisdom of change\n\nbecomes clear, her history has been, in\n\ncurricular matters, one of staying on the\n\ntrack and watching many other institutions\n\nmake costly detours costly, that is, to the\n\nstudents who were the subjects of their\n\nexperiments from which they have returned,\n\nchastened, to the main road. In money matters\n\ntoo: many a powerful university is in deep\n\ntrouble today because it accepted federal\n\nfinancing of an expansion it cannot now main-\n\ntain, while Agnes Scott, having in her\n\nbackward way refused the lure, remains on\n\nfirm ground, drawing her support as always\n\nfrom her own alumnae and from others who\n\nbelieve in her.\n\nTo my original vision of Agnes Scott has\n\nbeen added, through the years, a deep respect\n\nfor the courage it takes to be such a place:\n\nto be truly a liberal arts college, to be a\n\ncollege for women, to be difficult, to wall\n\nin those things that serve its aims and wall out\n\nthose that don't, and never to pretend that\n\none is the same as the other. Such courage\n\ndraws people who have the nerve to risk its\n\nhardships for its peculiar rewards, and I think\n\nthis is why the people I have known at\n\nAgnes Scott in the course of 35 years seem to\n\nme (I can say it in these pages) a distinctly\n\nsuperior breed.\n\nLinda Lentz Woods '62, presently a popular\n\nprofessor of English at Agnes Scott, shares with us\n\nthe speech she gave to the 1970 freshman\n\nclass during orientation:\n\nClass of 74- Why Are You Here?\n\nBy LINDA LENTZ WOODS '62\n\nHey, I'm glad to see you. I'm here tonight\n\nwith a modest, limited topic one that can be\n\nwrapped up easily in the fifteen minutes\n\nor so that we have: the aims of a liberal arts\n\ncollege, or more particularly the aims of Agnes\n\nScott as a liberal arts college. I'm not\n\ncomplaining mind you, in spite of my sarcasm.\n\nI'm grateful for the chance to talk with you\n\nabout this topic which might be the source\n\nof many subsequent misunderstandings\n\nconcerning what you expect from Agnes Scott\n\nand she of you. So I'm here and I'd like\n\nto begin by wondering why you're here here\n\nat this college and what you feel is to be\n\ngained for you and the universe in the process\n\nof the next four years.\n\nThere are, of course, all sorts of good reasons\n\nwhy you may have chosen Agnes Scott\n\nCollege as there are why she chose you.\n\nYou may have been attracted to the Atlanta\n\narea, certainly not the worst of reasons,\n\nbecause it seems a sophisticated metropolitan\n\nenvironment, offering opportunities for cultural\n\ninvolvement, professional sports, good\n\nshopping, beautiful trees dogwoods and\n\nredbuds and magnolias and, so say some,\n\navailable young men. Perhaps in your decision\n\nyou were influenced by a loving relative, who\n\ncame here once and recalls a community of\n\nmutual concern and caring; she may have\n\nspoken of personal relationships more\n\nmeaningful and open than those possible even\n\nin the now unfashionable sororities of larger\n\ninstitutions. Or, a friend who's here now may\n\nhave given you the good word about the\n\nrelaxed social policies; or your friendly\n\nPresbyterian minister, who has not heard\n\nabout the relaxed social policies, may have\n\nsought to see you in a wholesome, spiritual\n\nenvironment. Or a boy friend, perhaps a\n\npromising engineer sporting football tickets,\n\nlured you; or your guidance counselor in high\n\nschool may have urged Agnes Scott upon\n\nyou, because the odds are you are considered\n\na very competent student and Agnes Scott\n\nsustains a fine reputation as an institution with\n\na demanding, challenging, and solid academic\n\nprogram. Agnes Scott's size may well have\n\nbeen a deciding factor: the impressive\n\nstudent/teacher ratio or your trust that in a\n\nsmall college you might retain the dignity of\n\nbeing an individual and perhaps that even\n\nwith your voice or your dramatic ability you\n\ncould sing in the glee club or act in a college\n\nproduction. Or you may have been aware that\n\nAgnes Scott is, relatively speaking, a bargain in\n\nhigher education, with a lower tuition than\n\nsimilar private, quality colleges. In this era of\n\nwomen's struggles for identity and quality, you\n\nmay have had an appreciation for the special\n\nopportunities of a woman's college for\n\ninstance, the fact that our students have a\n\nchance to develop their full leadership\n\npotential by holding the student offices that\n\nusually go to men in a coeducational situation;\n\nyou may have been reassured to note that\n\nwomen are prominent among the faculty and\n\nadministration of Agnes Scott not relegated\n\nsolely to the least desirable positions.\n\nNow I'm not shooting down these reasons\n\nany of them. These and others like them are\n\nof course important, and we choose any\n\ncollege for a combination of reasons never\n\none alone. And still we may leave our decision\n\npretty much up to intuition and circumstance.\n\nWhat I'm hoping is, that before you have\n\nbeen here long or at least before you leave\n\nyou'll have a fairly well formulated notion\n\nof the kind of academic institution that Agnes\n\nScott College purports to be, that you'll have\n\nan understanding of the program of study that\n\nit offers, and a respect for the degree that\n\nwill be given you upon the completion of that\n\nprogram Bachelor of Arts.\n\nClass of 74\n\n(Continued)\n\nNo doubt you can come up right now with\n\na decent definition of what is meant in\n\neducation by the term liberal arts. The central\n\nidea has been, of course, from its very origins,\n\nthat a liberal education is liberating: that\n\nlearning in all areas of general knowledge\n\nfrees man from the bonds of fear, looses him\n\nfrom ignorance, superstition, prejudice, and\n\nintolerance shackles which enslave the\n\nunenlightened. Developing the student's\n\nintellectual capacities, training the mind to\n\nthink through the disciplines of literature,\n\nphilosophy, science, math even putting all\n\ncontent and information aside is sufficient\n\njustification to many for the liberal arts\n\neducation. But we come down from lofty\n\nacademic disciplines to an essentially\n\npragmatic principle: men or women who have\n\ncreative and critical intellects \"disciplined\n\nminds capable of logical analysis and fruitful\n\nimagination\" will be those, it is hoped and\n\nbelieved, who can improve the state of human\n\naffairs in time to come. What seems like\n\nlearning for the sheer sake of learning (a value,\n\nin my view, in and of itself) bears practical\n\nfruit; only when endowed with a knowledge\n\nand understanding of the world in which he\n\nlives can man become truly human.\n\nBoth aspects of the definition are old yet\n\nstill very much with us here on this campus.\n\nSo wrote Seneca, the ancient Roman\n\nphilosopher: \"There is only one liberal study\n\nthat which gives a man his liberty.\" Sometime\n\nlater, in 1960, President Alston wrote in a\n\nstatement of Agnes Scott's purpose \"that the\n\ntype of education offered at Agnes Scott is\n\npredicated upon the conviction that a mind\n\ntrained to think is essential if life is to be\n\nunfettered, rich and free. ... As a liberal arts\n\ncollege, Agnes Scott tries to place at the\n\ndisposal of the student some of the\n\naccumulated wealth of the ages, all the while\n\nattempting to guide the effort to acquire a\n\nworking knowledge of the clues and the tools\n\nessential to an appreciation of the intellectual\n\nand spiritual treasures that so many are\n\nneglecting.\"\n\nUsed to be we'd plow through essays in\n\nFreshman English on the meaning of the liberal\n\narts education. You'll be spared that. Perhaps\n\nwe still should for if anything, the subject has\n\nonly gotten more muddled and complicated\n\nin recent years. In an age where some reputable\n\nuniversities are coming up somehow with\n\nDoctor of Philosophy degrees in office\n\nmanagement, forestry, architecture, and mental\n\nhealth, there's obviously a good bit of\n\nconfusion. We're all quite aware that traditional\n\nassumptions about the liberal arts and\n\neducation as well as about a lot of things\n\nare being shaken in 1970 by full-blown\n\nhurricanes of change. I'd like to touch briefly\n\nand I'm afraid with much over-simplification\n\non four long-standing American assumptions\n\nabout the aims of the liberal arts college,\n\nglance at the challenges being hurled at these\n\nassumptions, and maybe in the process suggest\n\nwhat I feel are Agnes Scott's ambitions for\n\nyour education.\n\nThese four will overlap considerably, but the\n\nfirst point has to do with our long held ideas\n\nof college as a way of life. Originally, the idea\n\nbehind the university was the desire to form\n\na community of scholars: together for mutual\n\nadvantage and enlightenment, the older\n\npresumably guiding the younger, but very\n\nmuch in the employ. According to Frederick\n\nRudolph in his history of the American college\n\nand university, the notion of a community of\n\nscholars became transcribed in American\n\neducation early in quite paternalistic terms,\n\nperhaps in large measure because of the\n\nresidential character of American schools.\n\nAmericans held that all of college was a\n\nlearning process that certainly the student\n\ncould learn as much about life from his fellow\n\nstudents in dorm sessions as he could in the\n\nclassroom. And just in case he learned too\n\nmuch in these informal sessions, the deans\n\nand the faculty and the housemasters would\n\nbe ready to keep him (or her) in tow.\n\nHence the whole view of the American college\n\nas functioning in loco parentis assuming the\n\nresponsibilities of parenthood for its students.\n\nThe good name of the college had to be\n\nprotected and concerned parents had to be\n\nreassured of the well being of their children.\n\nNow in an age when young people are\n\npresumed more mature than formerly, when\n\nthe number of students in many universities is\n\ntoo vast to permit close monitoring anyway,\n\nwhen many large urban schools are losing their\n\nresidential character as students demand\n\nflexibility and variety in their living\n\narrangements, most institutions are rather\n\nrelievedly relinquishing their paternalistic\n\nfunctions. Colleges and universities, including\n\nAgnes Scott, turned decisions about the hours\n\nhe keeps, the food he eats, the friends he\n\nmakes, the time he studies where he goes,\n\nwhat he does, and who with back to the\n\nstudents. Fine, you say. Time, you say. And I\n\nsay too. But there is still something potentially\n\nmarvelous remaining about this whole\n\nbusiness of college as a way of life and at a\n\nsmall, chiefly residential college like Agnes\n\nScott, which has an unusually stable faculty,\n\nwe have an opportunity to approximate that\n\nold idea of being a community of scholars.\n\nSure, we expect each other to hold to certain\n\nunderstandable standards of behavior, taste,\n\nand self-respect but more than that, much\n\nmore than that, we should demand of each\n\nother intellectual stimulation, a lively life of\n\nthe mind. If we don't yet have it within us, in\n\nthe highly concentrated intellectual\n\nenvironment of a small campus with its\n\nrelentless program of lecturers and performers,\n\nsymposiums and emphasis days, we can surely\n\nget it. And if we can't get all we need here,\n\nwe still have ready access to the larger world\n\nwhich brings me to the second assumption\n\nabout the traditional American liberal arts\n\nprogram its sometime isolationism.\n\nThe isolation of the American liberal arts\n\ncollege was quite purposeful and quite literal\n\nat first. I mentioned the appeal of Atlanta's\n\ntrees no joke. Natural beauty was a prime\n\nconsideration in the placement of early\n\ncolleges. Beautiful scenery was considered\n\nstill is uplifting; and it was felt that\n\nundergraduates of all people surely needed\n\nmoral elevation. For instance, Henry Ward\n\nBeecher once said of the scenery of Amherst\n\n\"that it was a liberal education merely to be in\n\nits presence for four years.\" We could make\n\nsuch an observation about the monumental\n\ndogwood outside of Gaines. Another main\n\nreason for secluding students on remote\n\ncampuses was more devious: the idea was to\n\nkeep the student from the contamination of\n\nthe town or the city, and hopefully, to keep\n\nhim busy about the task of getting educated.\n\nAs one near poet put it, the risk is that \"the\n\nyoung men will sometimes get their ship\n\nlaunched before the keel is laid.\" For this\n\nreason, our neighbor institution, the University\n\nof Georgia, was built deep in the woods on a\n\nlittle hilltop that the founders called Athens.\n\nBack in 1801, the demoralizing effects of the\n\nautomobile were not as yet anticipated.\n\nQuite apart from the actual physical\n\nseparation from the wicked city that many\n\ndesired for the liberal arts college in this\n\ncountry, was the symbolic retreat behind the\n\nso-called ivy walls and up the so-called ivory\n\ntower hence the absurd overstatement that\n\ncollege is preparation for life but somehow\n\nnot a real part of life itself. There are some\n\nvery good arguments, however, for a temporary\n\nretreat from the materialistic concerns of the\n\nworkaday world and a place for some honest\n\nacknowledgements that it is the unusual\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\nClass of '74\n\n(Continued)\n\nstudent who can submit herself to a rigorous\n\nacademic program and reform the world\n\nsimultaneously. So we come to the current\n\ndebate between the activists and the studious\n\nthe participants and the non-participants\n\nthose who say the urgency of world conditions\n\ndemands immediate action on your part no\n\ntime for the books! and those who argue that\n\nbooks are the only hope of reason and\n\nmastering them is the first step.\n\nAgnes Scott, as you probably already realize,\n\ntends toward the conservative position in this\n\ndebate; and it seems to me the only really\n\nsane position for a small liberal arts college to\n\nhave if the life of the mind in its explorations\n\nis going to be preserved in America\n\nanywhere. We've got to find out who we are,\n\nwhere we've been, where we're going, before\n\nwe're much good to anyone. Joseph Campbell\n\nin The Hero of a Thousand Faces explains the\n\nnecessity of this seemingly selfish stage:\n\nFrom the standpoint of the way of duty,\n\nanyone in exile from the community is a\n\nnothing. From the other point of view,\n\nhowever, this exile is the first step of the\n\nquest. Each carries within himself the all;\n\ntherefore it may be sought and discovered\n\nwithin. . . . This is the stage of Narcissus\n\nlooking into the pool, of the Buddha sitting\n\ncontemplative under the tree, but it is not\n\nthe ultimate goal; it is a requisite step,\n\nbut not the end. The aim is not to see, but\n\nto realize that one is, that essence; then one\n\nis free to wander as that essence in the\n\nworld. Furthermore: the world too is of\n\nthat essence. The essence of oneself and\n\nthe essence of the world: these two are one.\n\nHence separateness, withdrawal, is no\n\nlonger necessary. . . . Centered in this\n\nhub-point, the question of selfishness of\n\naltruism disappears. The individual has lost\n\nhimself in the law and been reborn in\n\nidentity with the whole meaning of the\n\nuniverse. For Him, by Him, the world was\n\nmade. \"O Mohammed,\" Cod said, \"hadst\n\nthou not been, I would not have created\n\nthe sky.\"\n\nTo suggest this position is not to say that\n\nindividual activists would not be respected\n\nand encouraged here. It's only to say rather\n\nsimply that there are a great many things to be\n\nlearned from books, it takes some time to learn\n\nthem, and you'll be of more ultimate use to\n\nsociety anyway when you're better educated.\n\nThomas Carlyle argued this point beautifully:\n\n\"What is all knowledge too but recorded\n\nexperience, and a product of history; of which,\n\ntherefore, reasoning and belief, no less than\n\naction and passion, are essential materials?\"\n\nThough college must of necessity be a\n\nselfish time, of course balance, as always, is\n\ndesirable. Getting too far embedded in oneself\n\nis sick and stifling; outside interests are\n\nrestorative. It's ridiculous to be ignorant of\n\nthe present even as one pursues the past.\n\nIt's shortsighted to fail to exercise one's\n\npolitical rights and responsibilities. It's\n\nfoolish to ignore the larger community around\n\nthe college to deprive yourself of an\n\nopportunity to apply your lessons in the field:\n\nworking with the underprivileged, campaign-\n\ning vigorously, observing the government at\n\nwork. And in my view it's just plain dumb if\n\nyou miss out on all the cultural opportunities\n\nprovided by the larger Atlanta environment.\n\nAn evening at the symphony nourishes a dried\n\nup soul. Don't shrivel up in Decatur!\n\nStudents, as we've noted, find it difficult\n\nto engage in disciplined and demanding\n\nstudy and agitate and demonstrate at the same\n\ntime, and this is at least one of the many\n\nreasons why the traditional liberal arts\n\ncurriculum has been under fire. Another is\n\nthat studies in the humanities, pure sciences,\n\nand social sciences just don't meet every-\n\nbody's need and almost everybody is going\n\nto college. This brings us to a consideration of\n\nthe liberal arts curriculum and the divisive\n\nquestion of its relevance. Admittedly, some\n\naspects of the curriculum have been restruc-\n\ntured to fit the times and others need\n\nupdating. But before you or I get uptight\n\nbecause Agnes Scott College does not have\n\nsome of the same course offerings as the\n\nMuseum Art School or Georgia Tech or the\n\nFashion Institute, best consider her commit-\n\nment to what is probably the highest calling in\n\neducation humanizing her students. It's\n\nnever the number of courses a place offers\n\nthat can get rinky-dink and absurd; it's the\n\nquality of the ones provided. The aim here\n\nis for students to build a broad, solid base of\n\nknowledge before extreme specialization is\n\nencouraged; although many of our students\n\ngo on to graduate training, we do not conceive\n\nof ourselves as a pre-professional institution:\n\nthe preparation our students get should\n\ndo more than equip them for an occupation\n\nit should help them live life. We need some\n\npeople in the world who can pull a few\n\nthings together and we need them\n\ndesperately!\n\nAs to the usefulness, the \"relevance\" of\n\nthe liberal arts curriculum, let me quote\n\nCharles Frankel and his book Education and\n\nthe Barricades:\n\n\"Relevance\" in the university cannot\n\nmean that everything the university does\n\nshould be morally \"engage\" in some\n\nway or other, or \"contemporary\" or\n\n\"useful\". To learn detachment, to learn\n\nto recognize the limits and ambiguities\n\nof one's ideals, is a purpose of education.\n\nTo take people out of their own time\n\nand place, and out of a demeaning and\n\nignorant preoccupation with themselves,\n\nis another purpose. And to learn the\n\nuses of the useless is a third. The purely\n\nspeculative, the purely historical, the\n\npurely esthetic, enlarge the mind and\n\nintensify the consciousness. And besides,\n\nin the pursuit of learning, no one knows\n\nwhat will be useful, even in the practical,\n\nbread-and-butter sense of the term. . . .\n\nAn intellectual education is not a process\n\nof meeting needs, either the individual's\n\nor society's. It is a process of transforming\n\nneeds, both the individual's and society's.\n\nAnd Dr. Alston on the same subject:\n\nWe undertake to offer a liberal arts\n\ntraining that touches life vitally and deter-\n\nminatively. We are convinced that, so\n\nfar from being visionary, vague, and un-\n\nrelated to life, a liberal arts education\n\nought to fit young people to live with\n\nthemselves; it ought to contribute to\n\nmarriage, to vocational success, and to\n\ngood citizenship; it ought to help with\n\nthe highest level of adjustment the\n\nrelationship of man with God.\n\nDr. Alston's statement concerning the\n\neffect a liberal arts education has on man's\n\nspiritual well-being serves as a bridge to the\n\nlast point I wish to make about the aims of the\n\nliberal arts education as they are embraced by\n\nAgnes Scott. If Truth is the goal of learning\n\nand to engage in the search for Truth\n\nis the opportunity extended by the liberal arts\n\ncollege, the intimate relationship between the\n\nknowledge that you acquire and your moral\n\nsensitivity or responsibility is obvious; I'll\n\nsimply underscore it once again. Growth in\n\nknowledge is best accompanied by commit-\n\nment to high purpose. The cultivation of\n\nintellectual and moral virtues remains the\n\nfundamental task of a liberal arts education.\n\nI'm not talking just now about the narrow\n\nsectarian interests that directly inspired the\n\nfounding of countless of our finest liberal arts\n\ninstitutions but about a basic assumption\n\nconcerning their best products. Milton put\n\nit all together this way: \"Liberal learning\n\nseeks to produce men [and women] inflamed\n\nwith the study of learning and the\n\nadmiration of virtue; stirred up with high\n\nhopes of living to be brave men and worthy\n\npatriots, dear to God, and famous to all ages.\"\n\nThat's you I hope. Good luck.\n\nGrace Granville (G.G.) Sydnor '71, graduate student\n\nat Rice University and our youngest contributor,\n\nlooks back to the not-so-distant past:\n\nThe Value of Self\n\nBy G. G. SYDNOR 71\n\nAt the end of four years, more remains of\n\na class at Agnes Scott than waste baskets\n\nstuffed with tattered costumes that once did\n\nhonor to the class mascot. The outfits\n\nuniformly green, red, yellow, or blue,\n\ndepending on the year appear from every\n\nimaginable hiding place during the room\n\ncleaning panic of graduation week and briefly\n\nbecome as familiar a sight in the halls as\n\nsuitcases during Christmas exams. A surprising\n\nnumber of seniors become sentimental over\n\nthese glorified gym suits; the reason dates\n\nback to freshman year, when the new class,\n\ndeluded into believing that their mascot's\n\nidentity can be kept a secret from the sopho-\n\nmores, works together to accomplish the\n\nmiracle: maintaining the secret. These Black\n\nCat costumes identify the individual as a\n\nmember of a group, and at the same time\n\nprovide the first means of contributing as an\n\nindividual to class and school projects.\n\nThe scope of involvement at Agnes Scott\n\nwidens from the Mardi Gras atmosphere of\n\nBlack Cat to all phases of academic and\n\nextra-curricular activities. Individual endeavors\n\nin both areas contribute to the person's\n\nas well as to the college's background of\n\nexperience; in this way and others, the\n\nindividual is of genuine importance to Agnes\n\nScott College, accounting for the special\n\ncharacter that remains after seniors have left\n\nmascots and mortarboards to their successors.\n\nAcademic involvement at Agnes Scott takes\n\nin everything from the annual interior\n\ndecorating event, occurring each April Fools'\n\nDay in the Dean of the Faculty's office, to\n\nwriting an independent study; with such a\n\nwide offering of ways to get involved\n\nacademically, it is not surprising that this\n\narea demands most of the student's time.\n\nMost students enter Agnes Scott well aware\n\nof the college's academic reputation and the\n\nimplications for themselves that this high\n\nstanding holds. Changes have taken place\n\nin the curriculum: for instance, group\n\nrequirements may now be filled anytime\n\nduring the four years, rather than during the\n\nfreshman and sophomore years only. Another\n\npopular offering has been the college's\n\nsummer study abroad program, which in its\n\nfirst two years has taken students and\n\nfaculty members to Great Britain and to\n\nMarburg, Germany. With its people, busi-\n\nnesses, social agencies, and cultural events,\n\nAtlanta complements the liberal arts curriculum\n\nat Agnes Scott by providing examples of\n\ntheory put into practice. Even though the\n\ncollege has branched out literally into the\n\nworld, intellectual curiosity keeps its center\n\non campus. Although directed readings and\n\nsenior seminars represent two ways of contrib-\n\nuting an original thought to the academic\n\nworld, this same opportunity appears daily in\n\nclasses and in preparation for them. Small\n\nclasses, most of which are geared for active\n\nstudent participation, and understanding\n\ninstructors encourage the exchange of ideas.\n\nA faculty interested more in teaching than\n\nin publishing dedicates itself unselfishly to the\n\nstudents, frequently going beyond the call\n\nof duty in such varied ways as sponsoring\n\norganizations on campus and entertaining\n\nstudents in their homes. From the faculty and\n\nadministration, the outstanding expression of\n\ntrust in the individual student has been the\n\nestablishment and continuation of self-\n\nscheduled examinations. This privilege, more\n\nthan anything else, has made each student\n\naware of her own integrity and of her\n\nimportance to the rest of the academic\n\ncommunity in maintaining the highest standard\n\nof conduct, for without total cooperation,\n\nthe honor system could not work.\n\nAn individual realizes her importance to\n\nthe college in other ways as important in\n\nthemselves as maintaining an academic\n\nsystem, and extra-curricular activities provide\n\nsuch a means. Again the college's small\n\nsize encourages everyone who wants to\n\nparticipate to do so; the campus is still a\n\nvery friendly place, and getting to know\n\nmembers of all classes is no problem.\n\nFriendships made at Agnes Scott are among\n\nthe most valuable and permanent things that\n\na student carries away with her. If Atlanta\n\nserves as an extension of the classroom, it\n\nalso serves as a playground. Concerts,\n\ntheatres, restaurants, and athletic events are\n\nfavorite places to go with friends and dates.\n\nOpportunities for service are everywhere, on\n\nand off campus; children's homes, remedial\n\ntutoring, and literacy projects give everyone\n\nthe chance to get off campus and to help\n\nthe community. On campus, a recent\n\ninnovation that has given everyone the\n\nchance to seek her own choice of an elected\n\noffice is the petition, by which a candidate\n\nmay request in writing to have her name\n\nentered on the ballot. At Agnes Scott, students\n\njoin organizations and help with projects out\n\nof a real interest in what is being done,\n\nrather than from a desire to weight a per-\n\nmanent record file or to appear in the winning\n\nnumber of pictures in the yearbook. Individual\n\ninitiative is encouraged and developed, for\n\nbuck-passing is hard to do successfully\n\namong a small group of people, especially\n\nwhen most of them are already busy. Whether\n\nthe student or the college gains more from\n\nextra-curricular activities is an open question.\n\nWorking with a class project, writing for\n\none of the campus publications, and serving\n\nin student government are three of the ways\n\nin which an individual develops her own\n\nsense of accomplishment and leadership, at\n\nthe same time improving life in and around\n\nthe Agnes Scott campus.\n\nThe individual is the most important part\n\nof Agnes Scott College, and the school's\n\nrecognition of this accounts for the feeling of\n\nfriendliness, trust, and openness among\n\nall levels there. In addition to the friendships\n\nand education that a student gains at Agnes\n\nScott, she also acquires a sense of her own\n\nvalue, to herself and to others. This belief,\n\ngained from all sorts of experiences at the\n\ncollege, is passed along to others there, who\n\nin turn do the same; it is this belief in the\n\nvalue of each individual that continues to be\n\na part of Agnes Scott's specialness long after\n\na student has left the college and has carried\n\naway her own special memories.\n\nJ\\\n\nFrank Manley, Pro-\n\nlessor of English\n\nEmory University\n\n*& ^* \\*\n\nLouis L. Martz\n\nDouglas Tracy Smith\n\nProfessor ol English\n\nand American Litera-\n\nture Yale University\n\nPatricia C. Pinka, As-\n\nsistant Professor of\n\nEnglish Agnes Scott\n\nCollege\n\nQuatercentenar\\\n\nCelebration of tli\n\nBirth of\n\nJohn Donne\n\nOn February 24-25, 1972, Agnes\n\nScott College is inaugurating the\n\nJames Ross McCain Lecture Series\n\nwith a two-day celebration of the\n\n400th anniversary of John Donne's\n\nbirth. The lecturers invited for this\n\noccasion are Professor Louis L.\n\nMartz of Yale University, Professor\n\nFrank Manley of Emory University,\n\nand Professor Patricia G. Pinka of\n\nAgnes Scott College.\n\nIt is particularly appropriate that\n\nthis college honor John Donne in this\n\nway, for courses in his poetry have\n\nalways had a significant place in\n\nthe English curriculum. For many\n\nyears, one of the most popular\n\ncourses in the college, and one that\n\nno student felt she could afford\n\nto miss, was English 360, Mr. Hayes'\n\ncourse in Milton and Donne.\n\nHelen Gardner could say that Donne\n\nis the \"greatest love-poet\" in the\n\nEnglish language and that in his\n\npoems one \"can find almost any\n\nand every mood of man in love\n\nwith woman,\" but George Hayes\n\ncould read the poems with such\n\npassion and interpret their moods\n\nwith such discrimination and insight\n\nthat his students would know for\n\nthemselves Donne's supreme power\n\nas a poet of love. When Mr. Hayes\n\nretired in 1967, Mrs. Patricia G.\n\nPinka joined the English faculty at\n\nAgnes Scott to teach the 17th century\n\ncourses in the department. Mrs. Pinka\n\nhad done her graduate work at the\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh and had\n\nrecently completed her dissertation,\n\n\"Voices in Donne's Songs and\n\nSonnets.\" In the two years she has\n\nbeen in the English department\n\nMrs. Pinka has continued to make\n\nthe study of Donne and his\n\ncontemporaries a special favorite\n\nwith the students presently at\n\nthe college.\n\nIt is fitting, too, that the scholars\n\nwho will come together for this\n\ncelebration include men of such\n\nacademic distinction as Professor\n\nLouis Martz and Professor Frank\n\nManley. Louis Martz has done some\n\nof the most significant recent\n\nscholarship on Donne. His book,\n\nThe Poetry of Meditation, is a\n\nseminal study. In it Professor Martz\n\ndemonstrates the relationship\n\nbetween the Ignatian meditation\n\nand a substantial portion of 17th\n\ncentury poetry. He shows, for\n\nexample, that the illusion of a\n\ndramatic confrontation which Donne\n\ncreates grows from the meditative\n\npractice of imagining vividly the\n\nscene of an event to be pondered,\n\nthe famous composition of place in\n\nIgnatian meditation. Frank Manley\n\nhas published the definitive edition\n\nof The Anniversaries and has\n\nilluminated the reading of these\n\ncomplex and strangely unified\n\npoems.\n\nPresident Wallace M. Alston and\n\nthe members of the department of\n\nEnglish believe that there is no\n\nbetter way to initiate the James\n\nRoss McCain Lecture Series than\n\nby a program of this quality.\n\nYears ago, when Dr. McCain stepped\n\ndown from the presidency of Agnes\n\nScott, President Sara Blanding of\n\nVassar said,\n\nThroughout the nation Agnes\n\nScott enjoys an enviable repu-\n\ntation for having maintained\n\nduring its long history under\n\nDr. McCain's leadership the\n\nmost excellent standards of\n\nscholarship and achievement.\n\nThe Donne Quatercentenary Cele-\n\nbration honors this devotion to\n\nacademic achievement which Dr.\n\nMcCain built into this college; it\n\nalso promises that this devotion\n\nwill continue.\n\nWe invite you to join us on\n\nFebruary 24-25.\n\nMargaret W.

Mollie and Jim Turpin\n\n3m to be doing just that.\n\nWhen Mollie married Jim Turpin,\n\ni was a sociology major at Agnes\n\natt and he was a medical student\n\nEmory. After many years of hard\n\n>rk, they settled in California\n\njst because they wanted some\n\nventure.\" But the real adventure\n\nne later. Nine years ago, Jim gave\n\nhis successful private practice to\n\ngin work on a dream. That dream\n\ncame Project Concern which is a\n\nn-profit, non-governmental,\n\nlependent program designed to\n\nal the sick and help the poor.\n\n)ject Concern has now become\n\nernational with clinics in Hong\n\nng, Mexico, Vietnam, New Mexico,\n\nd recently Alpine, Tennessee,\n\n:p in Appalachia.\n\nim was not alone, however, in his\n\n:ams or his labor. Not only did\n\nsllie help write letters to friends\n\ntheir Christmas card list in\n\nier to gain support for the\n\nbryonic program, but when Proj-\n\nConcern was formally established\n\n1962, she sailed with Jim and their\n\nr children to Hong Kong to work\n\nhis side. During the two years\n\nspent in Hong Kong, living and\n\nisting on one of the two floating\n\nnics in Hong Kong Harbor with\n\nausands of refugees, she worked\n\nthe squalid, over-crowded Walled\n\nty of Kowloon and at Project\n\nincern's clinic in the Jordan Valley\n\nong the many squatter shacks\n\nthe hillsides of Kowloon.\n\nIn 1964, Mollie and Jim established\n\nDrs. Mollie and Jim Turpin\n\na small hospital in a war-torn South\n\nVietnamese hamlet, DaMpao, 150\n\nmiles northeast of Saigon. This new\n\nprogram was designed to provide\n\nmedical relief and to train the\n\nVietnamese to be medically self-\n\nsufficient.\n\nHowever, these activities along\n\nwith the care and feeding of four\n\nchildren and a husband, were not\n\nenough for Mollie Turpin. \"Feeling\n\ninadequate,\" she returned in\n\nSeptember, 1964, to the United\n\nStates to begin pre-medical training\n\nat California Western University in\n\nSan Diego. Seven years later, after\n\nmedical school at Women's College\n\nof Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and\n\nan internship at University Hospital\n\nin San Diego, she again joined the\n\nstaff of Project Concern this time\n\nas a Medical Doctor.\n\nWith the candor which charac-\n\nterizes this pretty, deceptively\n\ndelicate-looking blonde, Mollie\n\nexplained that medical school was\n\n\"hard at first\" but she knew she\n\nwould have to work hard. Also,\n\nMollie believes that women have\n\nattributes which make them\n\nespecially suited to the medical\n\nprofession intuition and the\n\nability to empathize.\n\nDrs. Mollie and Jim Turpin have\n\nnot finished. In June, 1968, Project\n\nConcern began its first program in\n\nthe United States. It soon moved to\n\nAlpine, Tennessee and serves many\n\nsmall, poverty-stricken communities\n\nin North Central Tennessee. Before\n\nProject Concern came, the area had\n\nnot had a doctor or a dentist for\n\nsixty-three years. The next program\n\nis planned for the town of Mercedes,\n\nin the southern tip of Texas. The\n\nclinic there will serve migrant workers\n\nin South Texas' Rio Grande Valley.\n\nObviously, the Turpins have not\n\nfinished; they have only started.\n\nBecause they believe that \"buildings\n\nand fine activities are not religion,\"\n\nthey have dedicated their lives \"to\n\nthe sick whom nobody else would\n\nhelp.\" And as Mollie says, \"It is\n\nso much fun . . . let's get on\n\nwith it.\"\n\nThe Agnes Scott Annual Fund 1970-71\n\nAlumnae, take a bow.

Decatur. Ca. Second class oostaee Daid at Decatur. Ceoreia 30030\n\nhe Magic Continues, or What's It All About\n\nAt the risk of aligning myself with the\n\nestablishment and alas admitting that I am\n\nover 30, I have a few very old-fashioned ideas to\n\nsuggest. These ideas are concerned with loyalty-\n\nloyalty to excellence of standards and integrity\n\nof purpose and even to yourself. What's it all\n\nabout? Agnes Scott, of course.\n\nFor the Fall issue, we asked four alumnae to\n\nverbalize their feelings about the College, about\n\nwhat was unique at ASC the Magic, if you will.\n\nWe published these essays not only because they\n\nwere excellent but also because we believe it is\n\ntime to consider again the assets of our College,\n\ntime to redefine the quality of academic\n\nexcellence, the benefits of discipline, the freedom\n\nfrom gimmicks and the opportunity to become\n\nwhatever one is capable of in a community which\n\nhonors truth and curiosity. If Agnes Scott is not\n\nmade up of these things, then there is no reason\n\nto waste our time. If she is, it is time to think.\n\nThis article is not a plea for money whatever\n\nyou may have thought so far. Although the need\n\nfor financial support is great, I believe that there\n\nis something even more important awareness,\n\nloyalty, even enthusiasm for something in which\n\nwe all have a vested interest. If I sound\n\nsentimental and \"apple-pieish\" it's because I\n\nhave only just realized that I have an obligation\n\nto do something for the kind of education I\n\nbelieve in.\n\nRecently, I attended a conference held by the\n\nAmerican Alumni Council, lust when I was\n\nwishing that I were eating an ice cream at Disney\n\nWorld, a young alumni director took the stand and\n\nsaid \"Your school is only as good as the degree of\n\nparticipation of your alumnae.\" Although I'm\n\nstill not sure whether or not I agree completely\n\nwith his statement, my immediate reaction was\n\none of resentment Agnes Scott is much better\n\nthan her small percentage of participation and\n\nthen guilt. Up until the time that 1 began working\n\nat the College, I never really gave much thought\n\nto loyalty. Oh, I always intended to send that\n\n$1000, as soon as I made my fortune (or found\n\nthat millionaire). I even gave my small check-\n\nprobably more for income tax purposes than\n\nanything else. And as a teacher, I had encouraged\n\na few good students to consider attending Agnes\n\nscott, when they asked. But I never really thought\n\nabout loyalty or the obligation to give my time or,\n\nleaven forbid, a committment.\n\nFor, you see, not only is it true that a student's\n\ntuition does not begin to pay for her education,\n\nbut the service one contributes while she is a\n\nstudent is not enough. We cannot walk away,\n\nsaying \"Well, that phase of my life is over.\" In\n\nfact, one can never disassociate oneself from that\n\nplace which helped mold her. For every student\n\nwho has grown, developed, realized something\n\nvery exciting about forgive me life, there\n\nexists an implicit committment to support\n\nwhatever forces allowed her to become what she\n\nis. The tangible forms this committment should\n\ntake are as various as the numbers of graduates.\n\nBut the committment must exist. For some, it\n\nwill be financial support; for others a willingness\n\nto participate actively in continuing programs of\n\nthe College and the Alumnae Association. For\n\nothers it will be a conscious effort to seek out and\n\nencourage qualified students to attend Agnes\n\nScott. And for still others, perhaps it will be only\n\nthe awareness of the needs and/or\n\naccomplishments of the College. But for all those\n\nwho gained something here and can be honest,\n\nit is a necessity.\n\nThe importance of this committment lies\n\ndeeper than the need to help Agnes Scott\n\nmaintain her standards. I believe it is somehow\n\nrelated to the need for education in a world which\n\nsometimes seems to be confused, at best, and\n\nsplitting apart, at the worst. If education of the\n\nwhole person is one answer to a questioning\n\nculture, it is even more essential when\n\ncommittment and involvement are \"out,\" when\n\nmost say \"It's not my place to judge,\" when\n\n\"doing ones own thing\" seems more important\n\nthan the growth of the community, any\n\ncommunity. At a time when liberal, conservatives,\n\nright-wingers, militants, doves and hawks cannot\n\nagree on any absolutes, we are still not old-\n\nfashioned to praise education. And because the\n\nvalidity of the liberal arts curriculum especially\n\nis being questioned, we have the added\n\nobligation to defend a type of education that\n\nmade us what we are. Unless the magic of Agnes\n\nScott and all the others like her continues,\n\nsomething important about us dies too. And that\n\nbrings it down to a rather personal problem,\n\ndoesn't it?\n\nIf I had to wait ten years to discover my\n\nnegligence, maybe you have had to have some\n\ntime too. But it is now time to reasses our own\n\nuniqueness and ask why, ask to whom we are\n\nobligated. And I think that's what it's all about.\n\nC. Bowen 62\n\nTheN\n\nAS OTHERS SEE THEM\n\nBy Bertie Bond 53\n\nIn the 70's students are shoe-less,\n\nIn the 60's they were shod.\n\n1970 girls are bra-less,\n\nIn the 60's they were bra-d.\n\nWhat are Agnes Scott students like today?\n\nHow do they compare with students say ten\n\nyears ago? Let's take the most obvious answer\n\nfirst they look different. Their hair is long; their\n\nskirts are short, or dragging the ground. Actually,\n\nthey rarely wear skirts at all; it's pants most of\n\nthe time. And a good many of them have a\n\ndistinct aversion to shoes, except for boots during\n\nthe winter quarter. Ten years ago, they all wore\n\nloafers and white socks, with the socks up so that\n\nthey practically touched the hems of their skirts.\n\nIn my day, the white socks were rolled down, so\n\nthat one looked as if she had been in an accident\n\nin which both ankles had been broken and were\n\nheavily bandaged. You think students look funny\n\nnow? Today, the age of the natural, casual look\n\nis with us, and our students reflect the trend. It\n\nwould be strange if they did not.\n\nIn the 70's tradition has faded,\n\nOnce it made the students sing.\n\nNow the campus scene is different,\n\nEverybody does her thing.\n\nCollege traditions are less a part of the life\n\nof the campus today. Many of you will remember,\n\nfor example, the activities which involved seniors\n\nLittle Girls' Day, book burning, class day\n\nwith the daisy chain these are no more. We\n\ndo still have Investiture and Commencement.\n\nChapel survives by the hardest. Formal and semi-\n\nformal dances, of course, disappeared several\n\nyears ago, and this winter the Atlanta Rhythm and\n\nBrass Works will perform at a wear-anything-you-\n\nlike gathering. We are fortunate; we could have\n\nbeen entertained by a group called Huckleberry\n\nMud Flap, or by Quicksilver Messenger Service,\n\nor Black and Blue.\n\nStudents seem to be less interested in\n\n\"togetherness.\" I am not sure this is really true,\n\nbut they give this impression. There is certainly\n\nless participation in campus activities. They no\n\nlonger gather in the Hub to sing or play bridge,\n\nor come out to watch the hockey games, or want\n\nto spend two days with each other on a student\n\ngovernment retreat. And yet, hockey still exists,\n\nand the students who play it love it. We have had\n\nno dance for the past year or so, and this year\n\nit is back. Students got together to festoon Dr.\n\nMcNair's office for his birthday. It seems to me\n\nthat they have not been having as much fun as\n\nthey once had, that they lack a spontaneous\n\nspirit, and I wonder if they don't miss it.\n\nIn the 70's students have freedom,\n\nOnce the rules seemed without end.\n\nLate time limits no longer plague them,\n\nLess restriction is the trend.\n\nAgnes Scott students today have a great deal\n\n(continued on page 4)\n\n3reed\n\nAS THEY SEE THEMSELVES\n\nBy Sharon Jones 72\n\nDuring fall examinations, when I was first asked\n\no write an article on \"The 'New Breed' of\n\nitudents at Agnes Scott,\" I looked around the\n\nlining hall at my colleagues who were in the\n\nnidst of some serious studying and who were\n\ntudiously avoiding any conversation on exams\n\nllready taken, and I wondered, \"Are we really\n\no different from the Agnes Scott students of\n\nive or ten years ago? If so, is this difference\n\n>ne of gradually evolving external conditions,\n\n>r one of noticeable change in our internal\n\nlttitudes, or perhaps a combination of both?\"\n\n\\ surface examination of our activities reveals\n\nhat Scott students are not that much of a \"new\n\nDreed\"; after all, we still struggle through finals,\n\nnade easier by an unbelievably improved exam\n\nDrocedure, we still attend classes, although in\n\ni much more relaxed atmosphere, we still appear\n\nn Gaines for convocation, admittedly sometimes\n\n/vith a slight degree of hesitation, we still enjoy\n\n3lack Cat and hub parties with an exuberance\n\nind enthusiasm whose origin, in our more tired\n\nmoments, is somewhat difficult to imagine, and\n\nsomehow, after approximately four years, we\n\nitill do manage to graduate. And yet, beneath\n\n:his surface of the traditional \"Scottie,\" there\n\nJoes seem to be a slightly \"new breed\" of\n\nstudent, not so different from its \"parent\"\n\nDredecessors as to be completely distinguishable,\n\nDut a very interesting and multi-colored hybrid\n\nesulting from a cross between a continually\n\n:hanging environment and a restatement of\n\nnental and social attitudes, producing, for the\n\nnost part, a healthy and vibrant variety of Agnes\n\nScott students.\n\nWhen she first comes to Scott, the young\n\n/voman of eighteen already appears to exhibit\n\nsome of the early distinguishing markings of the\n\nfully mature student specimen, the \"whole\n\nwoman,\" if you will, who finally emerges clad in\n\nalack, clutching her purple and white diploma.\n\nIncreasingly, however, that hard-earned piece\n\naf paper is not seen as a liberating license for\n\nunlimited operation in the world, for many\n\n*\\gnes Scott students, even as freshmen, consider\n\nthemselves to be fully operative participants in\n\ntheir community, city, national, and world\n\nsocieties.\n\nAs a \"tired old senior,\" who could so easily\n\nbecome preoccupied and complacent, I note\n\nwith interest the fresh alertness, the willingness\n\nto question, the social awareness, and the general\n\nbreadth of experience demonstrated by Scott\n\nfreshmen, qualities which I am sure I possessed\n\nonly in a limited degree my first year. In the\n\nlast few years, Agnes Scott students have arrived\n\nat college with a broader base of knowledge, a\n\nknowledge covering not just the strictly academic\n\nsubjects, but also including more experience in\n\nwhat may be termed \"life\" study. More and more,\n\nthe young women who come to Agnes Scott give\n\nof themselves to volunteer organizations, to\n\n(continued on page 5)\n\nBERTIE BOND (continued)\n\nmore freedom than did their predecessors. The\n\nrules which told them how often they should go\n\nout, what they should wear on and off campus,\n\nand when they should come in, for the most part,\n\nno longer exist. They were appropriate in their\n\ntime. The days of whether to sign out on a pink\n\nslip or a white slip, of the dress policy, of hearing\n\nthe train whistle and knowing it would be across\n\nthe track and keep you from making it to the\n\nDean's Office before late time limit are gone\n\nforever. Changes have come about gradually,\n\nnot through student protests, or threats, or the\n\noccupying of the President's Office, but through\n\nreasoned discussions among students, faculty,\n\nand administrators who listen to and respect\n\neach other. There are still some regulations for\n\nexample, students are not to drink on campus,\n\nor use drugs, or entertain men in their rooms\n\nbut, in my opinion, the atmosphere today is more\n\nconducive to learning than it was in the early\n\n60's when students spent a great deal of their time\n\nand energy complaining about the rules.\n\nAcademically, as well as socially, students want\n\nmore freedom. They feel that under our present\n\nsystem of courses and calendar, they are too\n\nburdened with busy work to be creative or to\n\nenjoy learning. Yet, they have a sense of the\n\nvalue of a liberal arts education, and they have\n\nnot pushed for gadget courses, or a so-called\n\nrelevant curriculum, or an easier program.\n\nI think that each alumna of Agnes Scott can\n\ntake pride in the fact that our students in their\n\nquest for more personal freedom have conducted\n\nthemselves with dignity and good sense during\n\nan era in which many college campuses have\n\nbeen torn apart by turmoil and unrest.\n\nIn the 70's students are with it,\n\nThey are not naive or meek.\n\nThere is no great alienation,\n\nBut they want their chance to speak.\n\nToday's college woman is much more\n\nexperienced than she was ten years ago. She has\n\ntraveled and read and been involved in all kinds\n\nof community activities, work opportunities, and\n\ncreative experiences. She thinks she is very\n\nmature and sometimes she is. She has certainly\n\nseen and done more than the students who came\n\nbefore her. In some cases, she has rarely been\n\ntold \"no,\" and she does not like it when she hears\n\nit or thinks she doesn't. She has very definite\n\nideas about how the College should be run, and\n\nshe has no hesitation about expressing them\n\nOften, her concern about her education is\n\nvery genuine. Today she is being given the\n\nopportunity to serve on faculty committees,\n\nto express her suggestions about the curriculum,\n\nto meet and talk with prospective faculty\n\nmembers when they come for interviews, to be\n\ninvolved actively in the current institutional\n\nself-study. Many students are taking these\n\nresponsibilities seriously and are making a\n\nconstructive contribution to the life of the\n\nCollege.\n\nIn the 70's I am older,\n\nMiddle-aged spread and hair turned gray.\n\nAnd I've learned Scott students are special\n\nYesterday, and still today.\n\nThis has been a difficult article for me to write\n\nbecause, I think, it is never easy to interpret\n\nanother generation. As I read what I have written,\n\nI realize it is full of contrasts. Is there a new\n\nbreed of students? I do not know. Perhaps the\n\nreason for this is that I have an opportunity to\n\nwork on a college campus where I can know\n\nstudents as individuals. Certainly, there are\n\nobvious differences one can see today in\n\nappearance, in interests, in attitudes. Some of\n\nthe current students are difficult to live with;\n\nso were some students ten years ago, and when\n\nI was in school, and, I would imagine, all the\n\nway back to the Institute. Of course, there are\n\nproblems on college campuses today. But I\n\nbelieve that if you could know our students\n\npersonally, you would like and be proud of\n\na great many of them.\n\nSHARON JONES (continued)\n\n/arious causes which they deem worthy of their\n\nittention, and to interests outside of academe\n\nvhich serve as a means of self-betterment and/\n\n>r self-enjoyment. The \"new breed of Scottie\"\n\nees herself as not just a student, but as an\n\nncreasingly functional entity in society.\n\nThis very breadth of knowledge and experience,\n\nlowever, which appears to be so beneficial in\n\nhe preceeding paragraphs, also contains the\n\njossi bi I ity of a certain deficiency or weakness\n\nn the new variety of the Agnes Scott student,\n\nnd in today's students in general. Perhaps\n\nbecause we enjoy such a broadening base of\n\nnowledge, we sometimes lack a sense of\n\niirection, a definite purpose. A kind of\n\nnental sprawl sets in, an extensive but\n\nncontrolled development of the mind's real\n\n;state whose horizontal immensity inhibits, and\n\nit times completely prohibits, the careful,\n\nJisciplined construction of a depth of\n\njnderstanding or a height of inspiration,\n\nlonsequently, there does seem to be a slight\n\niecline in the seriousness of an entirely\n\nicademic pursuit, the in depth understanding,\n\nand a decline in strictly scholastic motivation.,\n\nhe spark of creative inspiration.\n\nBut is the so-called \"decline\" altogether\n\negrettable; should academics be solely for\n\nacademics' sake? On the student government\n\nDulletinboard in the mailroom, there is currently\n\na cartoon of a man, garbed in cap and gown, with\n\nlis face buried in a book, hastening onward, but\n\nobviously completely unable to see where he is\n\noing. The title of this little cartoon is \"Academic\n\nPursuit.\" The new breed of Agnes Scott student\n\neems to desire a greater degree of practicality\n\nn the courses she selects, and this desire is\n\nreflected in the popularity of the teacher\n\neducation program, the acquisition of the\n\negislative internship program, the tutoring\n\nsessions in several psychology courses, the\n\nrequest for field-work credit in sociology, and\n\nven in the decline in the graduate school\n\noption as an immediate post-graduation interest.\n\nWe must be careful, however, that our search for\n\ngreater personal value and practicality does not\n\ndeviate into a running after that much hackneyed\n\nand meaningless term \"relevancy.\" I believe that\n\npractical experience and a liberal arts curriculum\n\ncan be coexistant, and it is our responsibility to\n\nfind and maintain the proper proportion between\n\nthe two, a carefully poised balance which will\n\nprovide the maximum benefit to the individual.\n\nIndeed, one of the distinguishing attributes of\n\nthe new variety of Agnes Scott student is her\n\nindividuality, and so, in a way, it is almost a\n\ncontradiction to speak of a \"new breed\" of\n\nstudent, a term which in itself implies a certain\n\nintra-species similarity. Scott students now come\n\nfrom more varying backgrounds, with more\n\ndivergent interest, than five or ten years ago,\n\nand therefore, I do not believe that anyone can\n\nbe labeled as a typical \"Scottie.\" A casual\n\nstudy by an outside observer would not reveal\n\nwhether any particular student is an intellectual,\n\na student government politician, a social activist\n\n(or butterfly), an athletic wonder, or a Phi Beta\n\nKappa candidate. The variable \"new breed\" is\n\nable to combine any number of these roles, or\n\nconversely, if she so chooses, to assume none\n\nof them. Thus, because of our individualization,\n\nas a friend of mine has remarked, there are no\n\n\"status symbols\" as such in the Agnes Scott\n\ncommunity, and certainly no undue, reverential\n\nawe (good griefl) for any of our student leaders\n\nor scholars, just because they happen to be\n\nleaders or scholars. This fact alone seems to be\n\nindicative of a healthy and productive attitude\n\namong the students at Scott.\n\nDuring the past few years, when many\n\ncolleges and universities were in the midst of\n\ngreat turmoil, Agnes Scott managed to maintain\n\nan atmosphere of relative calm and reason. Some\n\npeople said that this untroubled atmosphere was\n\nonly an indication of acute apathy. But beneath\n\nthe surface, and in a quiet, unpretentious way,\n\nan enormous amount of constructive change\n\noccurred and most of this change was student-\n\ninitiated and student-executed. At a time when we\n\nwere supposed to be so \"apathetic,\" student\n\ngovernment was reorganized to form a more\n\neffective and responsive system, the highly\n\nsuccessful self-scheduling exam procedure was\n\nestablished and maintained, and the social\n\nrules were reduced to a set of non-negotionables,\n\na relaxation which allowed us the freedom to\n\nfurther our growth as individuals.\n\nSo this is the \"new breed\" of students at\n\nAgnes Scott. All that remains now for us to do,\n\nis to work on our imperfections.\n\nAtlanta: A Nice Place to Visit\n\nAnd I'm Glad I Live Here\n\nObjectively speaking, much tor\n\nwhich Agnes Scott is praised is also\n\nfound at most other women's\n\ncolleges. An excellent faculty, a\n\nstrong liberal arts program, a small\n\nteacher-student ratio, stimulating\n\nlecture series and cultural events,\n\nand a close college community\n\ncharacterize all-women schools\n\nacross the country. However, Agnes\n\nScott has one advantage which only\n\none other woman's college can claim\n\nAtlanta, a kaledescopic city of\n\nendless fascination. The possibilities\n\nfor the college student to find some\n\nplace new to explore are\n\ninnumberable in this exciting\n\nmetropolitan city, often labeled a\n\nclassroom and playground for Agnes\n\nScott.\n\nIn the area of the arts, the\n\nAtlanta"
