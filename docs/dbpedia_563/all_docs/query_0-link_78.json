It's been edited and expanded a bit to provide more of a transition. Examples to illustrate your points are encouraged but not required.\n\nQuestion 9:\n\nCharacters —>Diversity in Books\n\nHow important are character descriptions to you? With a description are you able to actually visualize the character? If there is no description do the characters remain faceless to you?\n\nIf not given clear description otherwise, do you tend to imagine characters who look more or less like yourself re: skin color, ethnicity…etc.?\n\nWhat about gender? If pronouns were neutral, what would your default be?\n\nWhat about when you are reading literatures other than your native lit? Say you are reading Italian, Japanese, or Nigerian literature? Are you visualizing the characters differently?\n\nIs it important to you that there are characters who look like yourself? Is it harder to identify with characters who don’t look like yourself?\n\nBeyond the visual, is it important to you that characters in books are also representative in other ways (i.e. religion, location, economic status…)\n\nDo you hold the authors responsible for including that diversity in their books or the publishers for their choices as to what to publish? Or, is it on all us, the readers, to find diversity by our reading choices? And do you consider those questions differently if regarding children’s or YA lit?\n\n3Cancellato\n\nModificato: Feb 21, 2020, 12:20 am\n\nInteresting question. The protagonist is always me. I may have shape shifted to another age, time period, socio-economic class, gender or ethnicity, but whatever happens to the protagonist happens to me, and I feel as they do if the writing is any good Depending on the writer, I might share the protagonist's experience more or less intensely. I have greatly enjoyed or been moved by being the following:\n\nGenley Ai from Left Hand of Darkness\n\nLady Murasaki The Diary of Lady Murasaki\n\nAnne Elliott Persuasion\n\nTherese Belivet The Price of Salt\n\nTom Ripley The Talented Mr. Ripley\n\nJoe Pitt Already Dead\n\nGeorge and Lenny Of Mice and Men\n\nBirdie Lee Caucasia\n\nI suppose reading is, for me, primarily an exercise in empathy and imagination. Publishers have an obligation to present a wide variety of characters to readers to feed that imagination and empathy.\n\nStories should be as diverse as they need to be. Not the author's job to fill a quota.\n\nI don't have different opinions about children and YA books.\n\n4thorold\n\nFeb 21, 2020, 3:54 am\n\nQ9:\n\nI don’t think I’m a very visual reader: the “mental picture” I establish of a character can go on quite happily without me agonising about the hair-colour the author forgot to specify, I don’t have to make a string of imaginary phone-calls to Wardrobe to figure out what sort of shirt an eighteenth-century character would be wearing. And indeed, if you asked me whether it’s ever mentioned what colour Mr Darcy’s eyes are, I would have to go and look it up: visual details don’t necessarily stick in my mind.\n\nI think I do fill in missing details on the basis of plausibility some of the time, at least. There’s an Ali Smith novel where one character is “I” and the other “you” and no gender-specific terms are ever used for either: I didn’t notice this explicitly until almost the end of the book, I’d just been taking it for granted that the narrator of an Ali Smith novel and her lover would both be women...\n\nProtagonists that look like me — no, not really. In fact, that would be more likely to make me avoid the book than read it. A lot of the fun of reading is to get an imaginative insight into lives quite different from your own. That doesn’t mean that you actually get to experience what it’s really like to live in a different social or historical setting, have a different gender and sexuality, or whatever, but it at least gives you a better feel for what it might be like than you had before.\n\nBut that’s basically the typical grown-up model of reading-for-enjoyment. On the other hand, kids use storytelling to help build models of the world they’re growing up in, and for them it really matters that at least some of the books they read have people “who look like them” in them, and show them finding a good path in the world. Obviously, they should also be reading books with characters who look like the other kids n the class/the kids from the school down the road, etc. And they shouldn’t be treated as idiots: not all books need to be didactic/contemporary/full of good role-models. Just as long as there are enough of the other sort in the school library to give a bit of encouragement during the less pleasant bits of growing up.\n\nSimilarly, there’s an important place in adult reading for books that deal fictionally with situations we’re facing in our own lives: it’s good to be reminded you’re not the first to be going through this horror. And I’ve got shelves and shelves of 80s and 90s LGBT/AIDS fiction to prove it...\n\n5LadyoftheLodge\n\nModificato: Feb 21, 2020, 11:54 am\n\nQ9\n\nI like some character descriptions, but not minute details. I do not need to know the brand of clothing the character is wearing all the time, or the detailed account of their breakfast or jewelry. To me, those are a distraction or serve as filler, and I skip over them. I can imagine the characters myself, without needing a movie script.\n\nI usually imagine myself as the protagonist, whether descriptions are provided or not. I mentally morph myself to fit the character. I usually imagine the protagonist as female, unless specified as male. I read a lot of cozy mysteries, and many of the sleuths are female. I do not usually think about the other characteristics, such as religion, location, etc, as being important to whether I read the book or not, unless I am selecting a book for a challenge.\n\nI think reading should be for enjoyment as well as learning. I do not need to read for grad school or faculty development any more, so I read whatever I want. I think the reader needs to choose what diversity they want in the books. It is not up to the publisher to try to meet the needs of readers. On the other hand (and there is always another hand, according to Tevye), diverse kinds of literature offer many choices to readers. Example: Once I had a migraine headache on my way home from a conference. I read The Lightning Thief during the flight to keep my mind off the headache as I flew home. I picked the book up at the airport book store. I really find it offensive when people are critical of what others are reading. I used to read a lot of romance novels, and other teachers would criticize me for \"reading that trash.\" I had to hide my book in my book bag.\n\nBooks for kids and YA should provide opportunities for them to learn about people who differ from themselves. However, kids also need to find reading material that mirrors themselves, as a security kind of thing and an enticement for reluctant readers. When I taught middle school, my study hall students would read Garfield and joke books until they fell apart, and then they would read the sections that fell apart. I just wanted them to develop a love of reading, outside of the usual literary cannon, and I always had a box of different kinds of books in my classroom. Another teacher and I ran a book club, and we often let the kids suggest the books we would read. The best courses I had in library school were the children and YA literature and library services courses.\n\n6sallypursell\n\nFeb 21, 2020, 12:35 pm\n\nThis is a group of difficult questions. I don't think I have a default position on the identity/description of protagonists. I don't picture them or their surroundings. I don't need to know about their clothes, and I would forget them if I knew. I believe I may start with myself in that place, but I'm not necessarily female or old when I do.\n\nI do think I have more trouble with characters less like myself, but I have always assumed that people all work quite a bit like me. I have a little trouble remembering how children think--it has been along time, and I wasn't very \"childlike\" even as a child. (I was generally shunned for it.) I have the hardest time with people who have a negative view of things and especially of other people, but I don't mostly worry about looks or appearances of houses or clothing. In fact, I sometimes think I am too abstract about it--later comments may miss their marks or plot points of minor importance may go right past me if they involve things like appearances.\n\nIt may be wrong of me, but as I am not involved in publishing I hold no one accountable for diversity. If I were a publisher I might think it was worth some effort as a matter of ethics, but I think it comes out in the wash and circumstance will somewhat take care of itself. I do not seek wide diversity in reading, I think that is because I feel we are all so alike interiorly. I am well aware that some writers are disadvantaged by reason of race or gender, but I don't feel a personal responsibility to engage in this problem. I'm not sure why, because I think it is very important.\n\nI think people are too judgmental about reading. I feel I read a lot of trivial things, like paranormal romance, but in my youth I read all the tough stuff. I was a terrific fan of Beowulf when I was 8 or 10, and Morte D'Arthur a little later. In my teens I tackled the Russians, including Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Solzhenitsyn by my late teens, and a lot of the \"classic\" writers. I have always read YA, the trivial, and the difficult, although I have had a few very trying years, and I am not reading much that is difficult now. The pain is just too painful. I don't want to spend my time appreciating pain; I have a chronic pain condition and recently had serious spinal surgery due to acute spinal changes. I have pain of my own, and a lifetime of dealing with my own and others' pain (as a nurse) has made me oversensitive, I think.\n\nI feel similarly about YA literature. Kids need both stuff to stretch their ability to identify with others, and proof that they are themselves like others, and quite acceptable as they are. All that can be addressed in literature, and adults can and should have a role as providing possibilities. I have a little problem with when children should be exposed to the morbid and the abnormal, especially the perverse, but in general I believe they should be able to read almost everything--but they need a person on whom they can bounce their impressions. I hate it that some years kids get a bath in literature about the Holocaust. It is so important that they read and imagine it, to an extent, but light-hearted and enchanted are very important, too. There needs to be humor and magic in their thoughts, too. The most important thing is to have the habit of reading, including reading for pleasure and mirth.\n\n7dypaloh\n\nFeb 21, 2020, 1:30 pm\n\nCharacter Description:\n\nIn an interview, William Faulkner claimed that “all Tolstoy said about Anna Karenina was that she was beautiful and could see in the dark like a cat.” No idea if that’s all Tolstoy said but Corncob makes a good point.\n\nWithout a description, I might put someone's face to the character.\n\nGender, Pronouns Neutral:\n\nI don’t remember having read something where an important character’s gender wasn’t clear. Sometimes a name doesn’t signal gender. If it’s not important to the author to specify, I’m just going to roll with it.\n\nNon-Native Literary Characters:\n\nNo question I’d “visualize” characters in Japanese or Nigerian literatures differently, unless I were told the Japanese person was “Nigerian-Japanese” or the Nigerian were described as “Japanese-Nigerian.”\n\nCharacters That Look Like Me:\n\nImpossible to know. My appearance is so fantastically and breathtakingly amazing that no character ever could look like me. Honest!\n\nRepresentative in Other Ways (Religion, etc.):\n\nSometimes that is important to why I pick up a book.\n\nAuthor Responsibility for Diversity:\n\nI hold Publishers responsible.\n\n8RidgewayGirl\n\nModificato: Feb 21, 2020, 2:00 pm\n\nQ9:\n\nI have opinions. Let me attempt at organizing them.\n\nChildren's lit: I have been involved with a children's literacy non-profit since its inception and so have learned along with the other people involved about this issue even as we attempted to do something. At the most basic level, in order for a child to move from being read to, to reading independently, they must have books in which the main character or characters looks like them. Not just the sidekick. Not the guest appearance in a series, but the protagonist. This is still something publishing is failing at, although there have been significant steps forward in the past decades. Finding the quantity of suitable books we need takes effort because there are not enough of them. And too often books that feature a black or brown protagonist emphasize worthiness or struggle. Kids want books that are fun and need fun books in order to learn that reading is fun.\n\nAs to the responsibility of publishing to actively seek to publish diverse books, that reflect the diversity of the world we live in, yes they do have a responsibility -- one that they might do quite a bit better at were they to hire a diverse staff. And that means the current system of needing to do a few years of unpaid (or low paid) internship in order to get a foot in the door is unsustainable. Yearly reports of diversity within publishing show stagnation. It's hard to break away from the comfortable, but unless they find a way to do so, readers end up with books that are alike and of lower quality than we might otherwise get to enjoy.\n\nIs the reader responsible for reading diversely? Yes and no. We read for different reasons and many, many people read relax and don't want to find themselves challenged by their entertainment. And there's nothing wrong with that! If you like romance novels or novels with spies and explosions, go enjoy those things. And I think that serious readers who look down on popular fiction are perhaps missing out. A little escapism is useful.\n\nBut we are responsible for stretching ourselves. And if you hesitate to pick up a novel where the protagonist is different in a way that makes you uncomfortable, it's not a bad idea to examine why that is. And to listen to communities when they say that a book or an author or a line of books is doing them harm. I am extremely prone to jumping to defensiveness when my choices are questioned, so I do understand that reaction, but as purposeful readers, we have to constantly examine our choices and engage with the world. Enjoying problematic books is fine (we all do!), but we need to be willing to understand how and why a book or an author is problematic and engage with that as part of the whole.\n\nAs for the first part of your question, the book that challenged me most on this issue was Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie. I highly recommend it.\n\n9Cancellato\n\nFeb 21, 2020, 9:57 pm\n\n>8 RidgewayGirl: Thank you for this thoughtful post.\n\n10jjmcgaffey\n\nFeb 22, 2020, 2:28 am\n\nI don't tend to visualize characters in any concrete way; I do recall a couple times when I've been surprised at a late description, which indicates to me that I tend to see an undescribed character as white (like me). Not sure about gender - I may even default to male (for an active character), although I'm female.\n\nA recent book (by Leslie Fish - I forget the title of the book) had an aggressively non-gendered character. They start out discussing their wife, which made me default to male - but then there was something about long hair, which made me wonder. They are never addressed by name or pronoun - it's all first person - and having finished the book, I still have no idea what gender they were or were supposed to be (what Leslie thought they were).\n\nIf culture visibly differs in the story, I can generally visualize the character as fitting that culture (as far as my visualization goes). If it's, say, an SF story by a Nigerian author, and the setting is generic SF, I'll tend to visualize the characters as white unless they're explicitly described otherwise.\n\nIt's not really important that the characters look like me - which is partly because most of them do, anyway. White, I mean - and in real life I act more like a male than a female, so male characters are close enough (what they do is mostly what I'd do, given similar skills). But a character from another ethnicity...isn't particularly different. It's the actions and the thoughts behind it that are important. I have a hard time identifying with manipulators or people who have given up - whether they're white or Asian or...or non-humans, or whatever. People who try, and try to help others - that's me, or at least my ideals.\n\nAgain, I'm pretty much majority. So no, it's not important to me that people in the books are like me - though it does delight me when an asexual character shows up. What's important to me is that the character is representative of what they are. If there's a Muslim character - that's described as being an important part of their life/personality/character - then they should be thinking about the five daily prayers and the direction of Mecca and so on. If there's a character that's described as X, who then does not demonstrate any of the characteristics of X (the guys-in-drag version of the Strong Female Character is an extremely annoying example), that seriously bothers me.\n\nThere are two abysses in diversity. One is, every character is white/male/able-bodied/hetero/American (or at least Western) - that's a serious limitation on possible viewpoints. The other is, every book must include one \"diverse\" character, who stands in for every other person in that category - the Smurfette syndrome, where there were the smart Smurf and the noisy Smurf and the leader Smurf and the girl Smurf...yeah, and what else is she?\n\nSo I delight in authors who can produce real characters - full, rounded, complex people - who have as part of their characteristics some of the \"diverse\" checkboxes. An author who grimly includes one non-hetero/non-ablebodied/non-white person per book...yeah, not so much.\n\nWhich is to say, I don't think any author (or publisher) should have those diversity checkboxes in mind. Write _characters_, and write them beyond the majority characteristics. Publishers need to look at more diverse authors, because if every author fits that majority template, it will only be the exceptional authors who can write beyond it; if the author is, say, a black female, her outlook - her template - is going to be different from that of a white male and she's likely to be able to write beyond the majority template. But publishers should not publish an author _because_ she's a black female, but because she's writing good books (with non-majority characters, yay, bonus). Quotas make for bad product, in just about anything.\n\nAll of this is somewhat more important for kids, because they're forming the opinions that are going to guide them through their lives. So yeah, characters like them, and yeah, characters _not_ like them (especially if the child fits the majority template, or close to it). Empathy and seeing different ways of seeing things. But it's also far more important for the kids books _not_ to have the check-off \"diverse\" character. They need to be good books, with rich, complex characters, not a list of single-facet puppets (and especially not ones who \"overcome their handicap\" to be more like the majority template). I find way too many kids books that have Exciting! Adventures! but the plot doesn't really make sense and the characters are wooden puppets, changing how they act/speak/think from chapter to chapter (or paragraph to paragraph) to suit what the author needs them to do to advance this bit of the plot...ugh. There are adult books like that, which I dislike just as much (too much of monthly romances - but not all), but it's even more important for kids books.\n\n11dchaikin\n\nModificato: Feb 22, 2020, 2:34 pm\n\n>3 nohrt4me2: \"The protagonist is always me.\" - that's a really interesting assertion, especially in this context.\n\nI spend a lot reading effort trying to adapt to the author and what's important to them, and trying to put my own expectations somewhere else. Not that I do this successfully, it's a big struggle for me - hence the effort. Also, it's easier with older books than ones. But I suspect I'll answer coming from this perspective.\n\n...\n\nmy brain visualizes characters without my knowledge. When the physical aspects of a character are described, it always requires me to modify my predefined character. So, I guess these descriptions by the author are optional to me, I'll fill in the blanks. (All my characters are paper thin. No clue why. I forget to add any flesh or volume. Whenever I see a dramatization of a novel, my first thought is along the lines of: \"this character is wrong, they have way too much volume.\" Keep in mind, I'm evaluating movie stars and whatnot, good looking healthy people)\n\n...\n\nI don't think much about default gender. Hasn't come up much that I've noticed. I do think about race. In Toni Morrison's Paradise her opening line is something like, \"They killed the white girl first.\" I had picked the \"white\" girl early one and read the whole book that way. But, I was wrong. Morrison never tells which is the white girl. I constructed it myself through my own, apparently racist, connotations. That opened my eyes on assumptions.\n\n...\n\nSince I generate characters unconsciously, I can't say for sure how I handle various ethnicities. I clearly make assumptions, but I don't know what they are. Usually, the book comes to undermine my assumptions, if it's any good. The truth is, I shouldn't be making any.\n\n...\n\nCharacters don't need to look like or specifically different from me. I always look for points of commonality, but visual isn't one I think much about.\n\n...\n\nCharacters should undermine ethnic, or gender or other assumptions, always. These assumptions are always wrong. People are all different.\n\n...\n\nAuthors should write what they know. They should push themselves to understand other people, but if they start writing about characters types they don't know, they're going to drift into stereotypes.\n\n...\n\nPublisher's responsibility is more tricky. Ethically they should be driving to expand diversity...I think always. They should be looking for authors who can cover new ground, or have new talents. Still they should favor talent first. But, also, publishers aren't working for free. They work in a money society, they get paid and they have to justify that salary. Those two needs - ethical and $$ value - are not compatible. The value will always win.\n\nAs readers, our responsibility is also tricky. For one, just being a reader is a nice thing, and really alleviates other responsibilities. Ideally we should push ourselves to read more diversity from more cultures and perspectives. And we should do what we can to nudge publishers to put focus on the talented authors that do this (or are this). With books, we are ultimately the source of the \"value\", through purchase. So, we have some potential power. But also we should read what we value ourselves. Not everyone wants to rearrange their head every time they pick up a book.\n\n...\n\ngreat series of questions!\n\n12avaland\n\nFeb 22, 2020, 4:50 pm\n\nWow, some great responses, and everyone is so honest. I find myself nodding my head in agreement here and there.\n\nI agree with nohrt4me's statement that reading fiction is for me \"primarily an exercise in empathy and imagination.\"\n\n------------------\n\nI like a bit of description for the characters. Physical appearance can give a character, well, character. Those adjectives, depending what and how used can draw a picture, set up expectations, tap into preconceived notions, elicit sympathy or encourage solidarity. Conversely, a lack of description can perhaps make a story less visual, maybe a bit frustrating, but possibly more open and liberating without those expectations and preconceived ideas. That said, I'm happy to have characters that look different from myself.\n\nI'm not sure I have any definitive answers about the way I see characters beyond the what is given by the author. I do visualize some characters if given enough. I assume my default visualization with regards to race, when no description is given, is white because I've been told it is by current culture. I'm accepting of that, it makes perfect sense. Did anyone tell me Pollyanna, Pippi Longstocking, Tom Swift or the March sisters were white when I was young? Well, yes, the cover illustrations did. With regards to gender, I'm not sure I have a default anymore. I can't be sure now but chances are 50/50 that my default as a child was male, maybe well into adolescence. I'll have to think about that more.\n\nI suppose I have generic defaults for various countries & ethnicities which come into play. I visualized the characters in O'Brien's Girl set in Northern Nigeria as black, unless told otherwise.\n\nLast year I read and enjoyed Ayesha at Last, a sort of Muslim Pride & Prejudice. Nearly all— the characters were Canadian Muslims, 1st & 2nd generation. Did I visualize them white, no I did not. As it happens I pictured Ayesha as the actress Mindy Kaling - it's just who came to mind when her character was introduced and I couldn't shake it.\n\nI visualized the transgendered character Ry Shelley in Frankissstein as described (I also learned a lot from that character).\n\nI visualized all the characters in Leila a dystopia set in India as natives of the country. I'm reading the Memory Police by Yoko Ozawa now and I seem to be visualizing all the characters as Japanese. I think these are hazy visualizations based on what images are already stored in my head, because as we all know there is infinite variety within any category.\n\nAnd there were the blue women in Joan Slonczewski's SF A Door into Ocean. I pictured them as blue women :-)\n\n-----\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with RidgewayGirl regarding children's lit and also our responsibility to stretch ourselves.\n\n13markon\n\nFeb 23, 2020, 2:24 pm\n\nBeen trying to figure out my response and noticing places where I agree with those who've responded already.\n\nI do like a little physical description, but am happy to fill it in from setting, dialog, location, action as I read. I suspect having grown up as a white cis female that my default is the same unless it's expliciity stated otherwise, or there are obvious cues otherwise. (It may have been male growing up, I first became aware of how many books I read were written by men and about men in college.)\n\nI like what >3 nohrt4me2: said about reading being about empathy and imagination. I also look for commonalities in character or motivation in stories I read, even if culture or location are different from what I experience.\n\nI also identify with >11 dchaikin:, that my brain visualizes characters without my knowledge. Something in the text may challenge and shift that visualiztion. '\n\nI haven't read Toni Morrison's Paradise, but I find auther techniques like the one mentioned here - about not identifying which woman was the white woman -enlightening and intriguing. Ann Leckie's Ancillary trilogy was challenging in that respect; the culture she wrote about used her as the default pronoun, but the protagonist was not male or female. (Although I never was able to think of her as not female.)\n\nHaving said that, what I primarily look for is, as >10 jjmcgaffey: says, \"I delight in authors who can produce real characters - full, rounded, complex people\"\n\nAs far as who is responsible for diversity in books - in my opinion, it is primarily publishers, as they choose which authors to publish. Authors can write across gender and culture lines, and bravo to those who do it well. But if you're going to write about someone different from you, it takes research and imagination to do it well.\n\nUs readers? Well, we're already privileged in being readers, and having time to read for pleasure. I hope we'll take some time to stretch ourselves, but as Sally says, sometimes you need to escape or just have fun.\n\nKids & YA literature? I think it's even more important that diversity is reflected in this literature, as children are learning what the world is like in part from the books they read, and need to see characters like themselves. It was particularly interesting to see >8 RidgewayGirl: statement that kids need to see a protagonist that looks like them.\n\nOn a side note, I'm involved in culling damaged/outdated books from our children's collection at work, and noticed in looking through our books on families that the oldest ones (15-20 years) seemed to have only white heterosexual families in them. It's interesting to see how things change over time. I think it's much easier to create a picture book collection that is diverse than it would have been when I was a child. I think we still lag behind in chapter books and easy readers (for kids just learning to read.)\n\nThanks for this set of questions, and for everyone's thoughtful responses!\n\n14lilisin\n\nFeb 28, 2020, 3:29 am\n\nI'm so happy that everyone was so inspired by the questions and am amazed by the very thorough answers!\n\nAs the creator of these questions I thought I'd explain the process of thinking that led me to want to ask these questions of myself and others.\n\nI'm a big follower of Booktube, a community within Youtube where people discuss their love of reading. They post book hauls, and monthly TBR piles and wrapups, participate in community readathons and vlog about that experience. It's a fun little community with a lot of variety in Booktubers. While the majority is mostly YA focused as these teenagers were the first to start filming (many are now in their young 20s) their reading experiences, it has since branched into Booktubers who focus on thrillers, or classics, or contemporary literature, or a mixture of it all.\n\nAlthough I am not a YA reader at all, I follow quite a few YA readers on Youtube as their enthusiasm for books is infectious and they have fun friendly personalities to listen to. I have a few favorites whom I love listening to while washing the dishes or folding laundry.\n\nIn any case, the YA crowd, following trends in other media and in general American society has a whole, has recently gotten into this strong idealism of wanting/needing more diversity in their books (and in Booktube in general). They want to see non-white POC main characters, and fat representation, and LGBT representation, and non-able-bodies representation.\n\nAll worthy things of course but this activism has spread and almost gotten to a point where it seems a book can't have literary merit if it doesn't focus on POC-LGBTQ+-non-abled character(s) and so this made me think about characters in general. Basically, character descriptions.\n\nIt made me wonder, when I read, whether or not I default to white characters. But after careful consideration I realized that characters remain faceless to me no matter what country they are from, or what race they could be. If I read a contemporary book that isn't about a topic where explicitly stating race is important, and you were to ask me what the main character looked like and what race they were I couldn't tell you.\n\nIf I could describe it the image in my head sort of looks alienesque with long limbs, elongated head, almost flattened. The figures I imagine are more feminine in their softer details but there is no protruding chest. The characters in my head never have clothes but are not naked. But really I don't even often imagine this at all. Sometimes it looks more like a first person shooter game where I am holding the video game controls.\n\nI wouldn't automatically think they were white though. Because books to me (at least those trying to delve into the deeper human condition) should be universal in theme and applicable to all race and gender. Even if the book itself is set in a certain country or culture or within a certain race, reading the book I will obviously acknowledge the fact that oh hey, this book that takes place in Japan is probably going to have Asian Japanese main characters. But still the characters themselves will remain faceless as there is a human condition being discussed.\n\nI think a lot of this Booktube generation has also started to confused diversity in books with reading diversely. Reading books from other countries is something I highly recommend but if you are reading a Japanese book because you feel like you need to read more books from Persons of Color, then I feel like you're not understanding the concept you're trying to argue for.\n\nBecause reading a book about a Japanese person in Japan, is like reading a book about a White person in Finland, or a Black person in Ethiopia. These people are the majority in these countries and thus these books don't have diversity in their books. Here, you should be reading books that talk about the human condition that a person of any country should find means to relate to. And to truly read about diversity one would need to read about a Latin American in the US, a Black person in Japan, an Asian person in the Republic of Congo.\n\nSo I think it is both important to read diversity and to read diversely. Reading diversely becomes the responsibility of the reader while reading about diversity becomes the responsibility of the publishing industry as they control what goes out into the market.\n\nIn any case, that was my thought process. Again I thoroughly enjoyed reading everyone's answers.\n\n15Cancellato\n\nFeb 28, 2020, 12:00 pm\n\nI confess I felt a bit uncomfortable sharing this answer. That tells me that how we respond to reading is awfully personal and self-revealing. While I liked thinking about the questions and felt my answers offered some insights for me personally, my discomfort after the fact with sharing has also opened some insights about my limits in participating here.\n\n16AnnieMod\n\nFeb 28, 2020, 12:46 pm\n\n9.\n\nHow important are character descriptions to you? With a description are you able to actually visualize the character? If there is no description do the characters remain faceless to you?\n\nI like to have physical descriptions in general (at least tell me if someone is 5'5'' or 6'6'') but beyond the basics, most descriptions are lost to me. I do not really think in images so someone's green eyes or crooked nose does not make a difference in how I see the characters. Which is why I rarely have issues with casting choices when something is filmed - whatever the actor looks like is what becomes my mental image and that's it. I had been known to read some books almost to the end before my brain process the race of a character (even when they are clearly marked) - unless there is a reason for me to know that, it simply does not register. Same with gender in some cases...\n\nI do tend to consider everyone white unless mentioned otherwise. It is partially because of what I am but also partially because until a few decades ago, that was a fair assumption and I tend to read a lot of older novels.\n\nGenders are complicated. The first two languages I started reading it have their adjectives and verb forms gendered. So pulling a non-gendered story is extremely hard. As a result, I did not even realize that this can be a problem at all - a character was either female or male -- there was no middle ground. English changed that a bit - now you can have long passages without mentioning a pronoun or by using a gender-neutral one. So when one is not mentioned, I just... don't assume. I think of the character as they until we learn what they are (very useful when the character turns out to be a robot or a dog for example).\n\nMost of the literature I read when I was growing up was in translation so I do not think of characters differently than if it was Bulgarian (mostly anyway - with Bulgarian characters I tend to inject a lot of features and thoughts that are not written - based on subtle cultural clues and what I do know). I would switch the default race if I am reading a Chinese novel or a Nigerian one but... for the most part, unless the author name is obviously non-white, I don't even check that...\n\nYears ago (think middle school), I had some ideas about writing so I even created my own character (she is what I cannot be in a lot of ways). These days, if a book (or a TV show) impresses me enough, I would construct stories in my head which explore the world that was built, injecting her (with a changed background). It is like fan fiction that never gets written. It is my form of day dreaming -- and sometimes because I know I can do that, I am not bothered by the lack of women in a novel (I know it does not make sense but...). Because of having that though, I don't have issues not identifying with a character. I rarely do actually - even when they can be me, my brain separates us.\n\nI like diversity. I think we need diversity. BUT... I also think that a lot of people are swinging all the way to the other side - old white men had won all the awards and had been published almost exclusively - so let's start boycotting them. Or let's decide to read books only because they are written by women or by non-white writers. I read for the stories. I do not care who wrote them if I like the story and I don't think that anyone is owed an award or a publication or whatever just because of their skin color or physical attributes or country of birth. Of course, we are all subjective so things don't always end up black and white... but I wish we as a society would stop obsessing about how the author looks like and start obsessing about their craft.\n\nSame applies to characters - you don't make your detective a midget Native-American with an wooden leg just to be diverse - you make them whatever the story needs them to be. Some stories make sense with only male characters. Some make sense with only a single race ones (being it white or not - if you set the story in Bulgaria for example, especially on a small village, adding a non-white, non-Roma character does not make sense for the most part - with a few exceptions of course). And I really hate authors who write minority and non-male characters as if they were white/male but just with a different description. Each story needs its own characters - and they do not always need to cover all races and all religions and what's not.\n\nAs for who is responsible - it is complicated. It is both - but I also think that we may be trying to over-correct again. Publishers seem to be always screamed at when they keep signing the next white writer or when the ratios in their lists is wrong - so some of them just make sure the ratios are correct, regardless of books quality. Which does not mean that a lot of what is produced by white writers is not drivel - bad (and good) writing is not a feature of one race or gender. In a perfect world, we would not care who the author is and what they are -- but we do not live in a perfect world. So choices need to be made and it ends up in a no-win situation - if someone wants to write a story which has virtually no diversity of any type, chances are that they won't be able to sell it - so they inject a character who do not belong. Or they try to publish anyway and get crucified for its lack of diversity.\n\nChildren's and YA literature is a bit different because it has two goals - entertainment and teaching the kids about the world. As such, there should be choices - but there is still space for stories that show that not every group of five needs to follow a specific pattern of types and that diversity is not all about having one of each in every situation (which is where some books ends up - almost like check-boxes being checked). Should every kid has a book that has a character that could be them? Absolutely. Should the kid read only books where the main character looks like them? Not at all - variety goes both ways.\n\nI hope that the publishing industry will self-correct and get back to \"stories are important\" and get away from \"the message is more important\". But we seem to be sliding more and more in the other direction... And yes - I do know that if I were not white, I may have a different opinion. But I am a Eastern European girl who immigrated to the States - and I do not believe that a Bulgarian author has the right to be published in English just because they are Bulgarian. So... there is that.\n\n17markon\n\nFeb 28, 2020, 1:35 pm\n\n>14 lilisin: Thank you again for this question.

I also struggle sometimes with my personal limits - wanting to be authentic, but not wanting to overshare.\n\n>16 AnnieMod: I share your dislike of stories that have a different race dropped in to check a diversity box.\n\nAnd it is a complictated situation.\n\nI wish it was a simple case of publishers seeking out and publishing the best writing they can find. I think there are other factors involved as well.\n\nAccess to education (quality of public education in the US varies widely), having/making time to read and write (and still pay the bills and clean the house, etc.) and understaning how publishing works and having access to editors/publishers . . .\n\nThis stuff isn't all something publishers can fix. Or something there is a quick and easy fix for. I do think it benefits us all when there are good books available from a broad range of the cultures represented in the US.\n\n18markon\n\nModificato: Feb 28, 2020, 1:50 pm\n\nOn another note, I think it's interesting that we have a variety of visualization-while-reading styles. I hadn't reallly thought about it before, although I do remember wonderingin my early twenties about how we can know what someone else perceives visually except through visual descriptions or their reproduction of something they see in some visual medium.\n\nA quick google search found some interesting-to-me articles from Book Riot, Tor, The Guardian and a study being run at the University of Exeter.\n\nApparently there are a variety of visualization and imagination skills possibly related to our neurological wiring.\n\n19Cancellato\n\nFeb 28, 2020, 2:52 pm\n\n>18 markon: Thank you!

With a description are you able to actually visualize the character? If there is no description do the characters remain faceless to you?\n\nI like character description but I find that those descriptions only stay with me as I read as a kind of guideline to the character's appearance. I mostly take in and remember the impression that the author is trying to convey about the character via the description. If there is no specific character description, I generally let the context of the story create a picture in my mind's eye, but I don't create a specific picture, more a sort of shifting chimera.\n\nIf not given clear description otherwise, do you tend to imagine characters who look more or less like yourself re: skin color, ethnicity…etc.?\n\nNo. See above\n\nWhat about gender? If pronouns were neutral, what would your default be?\n\nHmmmm. Male, I guess, though, again, context would fill this in.\n\nWhat about when you are reading literatures other than your native lit? Say you are reading Italian, Japanese, or Nigerian literature? Are you visualizing the characters differently?\n\nCertainly. Back to the context point again.\n\nIs it important to you that there are characters who look like yourself? Is it harder to identify with characters who don’t look like yourself?\n\nNo and no. Part of the fun of reading fiction is picturing new people and places. I have to shave four or five times a week and also occasionally have the misadventure of looking at recent photos of myself. I know what I look like already.\n\nBeyond the visual, is it important to you that characters in books are also representative in other ways (i.e. religion, location, economic status…)\n\nWell, it's important that the writing and storytelling be good. It's better if I'm reading outside my own common experiences (although within what I already see as universal human nature). Though, on the other hand, sometimes it's quite thrilling to be drawn into a world I already recognize. That's one of the reasons I love Philip Roth's work so much.\n\nA) Do you hold the authors responsible for including that diversity in their books or the publishers for their choices as to what to publish? B) Or, is it on all us, the readers, to find diversity by our reading choices? C) And do you consider those questions differently if regarding children’s or YA lit?\n\nA) Authors, no. I hold authors responsible for good storytelling and good writing. I do hold them responsible for authenticity but I don't mind authors trying to imagine people/world's outside their own direct knowledge. They just have to do it well and with integrity. Publishers, yes. I think they should try to reflect a multiplicity of voices and perspective in their offerings.\n\nB) Yes. If diversity is important to you, it's on you to do your own searching. Happily, these days it's getting easier to engage is such a search successfully\n\nC) I don't read YA very often, but if I were trying to create a reading list for a young adult, I would definitely try to create a diverse list as part of that young person's education and entrance into the wide, wide world of people and perspectives and cultures.\n\n28AlisonY\n\nMar 1, 2020, 5:43 pm\n\nVery interesting responses to date.

Johnson's novel Christie Malry's own double entry (Opening of Ch. VI):\n\nAn attempt should be made to characterise Christie’s appearance. I do so with diffidence, in the knowledge that such physical descriptions are rarely of value in a novel. It is one of the limitations; and there are so many others. Many readers, I should not be surprised to learn if appropriate evidence were capable of being researched, do not read such descriptions at all, but skip to the next dialogue or more readily assimilable section. Again, I have often read and heard said, many readers apparently prefer to imagine the characters for themselves. That is what draws them to the novel, that it stimulates their imagination! Imagining my characters, indeed! Investing them with characteristics quite unknown to me, or even at variance with such description as I have given! Making Christie fair when I might have him dark, for an instance, a girl when I have shown he is a man? What writer can compete with the reader’s imagination!\n\nChristie is therefore an average shape, height, weight, build, and colour. Make him what you will: probably in the image of yourself. You are allowed complete freedom in the matter of warts and moles, particularly; as long as he has at least one of either.\n\n44RidgewayGirl\n\nMar 5, 2020, 12:17 pm\n\nQuestion 10:\n\nReader 1: A humorous novel: Cold Comfort Farm by Stella Gibbons. This book is a joy - reminiscent of Wodehouse, just better.\n\nReader 2: A history that’s engaging but not too dense: Fashion Victims: Pleasures and Perils of Dress in the 19th Century by Alison Matthews David. A gorgeously illustrated book that will have high appeal to those among us who like beautiful clothing and grotesque injuries.\n\nReader 3: An unusual mystery or crime novel: Three Bags Full by Leonie Swann - a mystery where the sleuth is a sheep, trying to discover who murdered her shepherd.\n\nReader 4: A really good biography or memoir: The Giant of the French Revolution: Danton, A Life by David Lawday. Lawday's biography is so clear in laying out the factions and order of events of the Revolution and so empathetic in his portrayal of a complex historical figure.\n\nReader 5: A nonfiction or fiction book about or set in WWII: This is probably the most expected choice, but Suite Française by Irene Némirovsky.\n\nReader 6: A science fiction book for someone who has not read science fiction before: I'm not a reader of science fiction, but I was delighted and astonished by Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie.\n\nReader 7: A trilogy or series one can lose oneself in: I'm going to be boring and predictable again and suggest Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Quartet.\n\nReader 8: A book capable of transporting you elsewhere: The Many Deaths of the Firefly Brothers by Thomas Mullen transports the reader into the Hoovervilles and bank robbers of the Great Depression.\n\nReader 9: A volume of short stories or essays: Her Body and Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado.\n\nReader 10: A book about religion/s, or a novel where religion figures into the story: The Book of Strange New Things by Michel Faber.\n\n45thorold\n\nMar 5, 2020, 12:59 pm\n\n>44 RidgewayGirl: reminiscent of Wodehouse, just better.\n\nAaaargh! Heresy! :-)\n\nMuch as I love Cold comfort farm, I don't think it should be compared to Wodehouse. Both brilliant, but in quite different ways. Gibbons managed to be funny and outrageous enough to get away with a rather creaky and overcomplicated plot once (none of her other books seems to have that touch); Wodehouse was a pro who never really managed to be outrageous, but he put together immaculately crafted plots with weirdly funny language time after time (about a hundred times, in fact...).\n\nBut CCF is wonderfully quotable, I remember how it became a cult thing during part of my student days (\"There've always been Starkadders at....\")\n\n>37 lilisin: I don't think The roads to Sata is a novel, but I enjoyed it very much!\n\nInteresting that no-one's mentioned Alexander McCall Smith yet — I'd rate him as one of the best humorous writers of our time, especially his Edinburgh stories.\n\n46dchaikin\n\nMar 5, 2020, 1:52 pm\n\n>44 RidgewayGirl: noting the book on Danton by Lawday\n\n47avaland\n\nMar 5, 2020, 4:56 pm\n\n>44 RidgewayGirl: We just watched the adaptation of Cold Comfort Farm the other night (for the the umpteenth time).

Is the reading of these older books any different if you are aware of the problematic features or nature of the book, or is it okay to just read through and ignore the problematic stuff? Do you think we are more forgiving with regards to classics? If an older book has won a prestigious literary prize, should we assume that there will always be worth in reading it despite problematic content? Are there some books once highly praised that are just not worth reading anymore? Can you share some examples of older books you have read or tried to read that that you had problems with?\n\nETA: What about children reading older children's books with problematic content?\n\n49AnnieMod\n\nMar 5, 2020, 6:43 pm\n\nQuestion 11: Problems with Reading Older Book\n\n\"Worth reading\" is one of those terms that always make me answer with \"worth to whom\"? I read a lot of Victorian novels (and non-English novels from the same period or older) and lately I had been working through quite a lot of SF and crime/mystery novels from the 1930s-1960s (yes, I know - long period). A lot of them have elements which will make me throw the book away if it was in a new novel set in the nowadays. But knowing when it was written and having the story and characters behave appropriately for the period make it work.\n\nPlus... when we stop reading the books with the problematic contents, we stop thinking about the problems. Which will allow them to crop back (not that most of them had really disappeared...). Part of reading is understanding the cultural and moral norms and background of the period the book is written in and the period it is written about. Reading books allows you to explore those times (and sometimes abhorrent practices) in a safe environment and seeing it outside of the 2 lines in a history textbook. I do not expect the good guys to always win and I definitely do not expect to agree with the author or his characters.\n\nNon-fiction is slightly different. Most of the old stuff there is problematic not just because of the offensive contents but also because of the dated scholarship. Not all of it - some of the major research studies for the Tudors are from the middle of the last century for example. But I am more likely to just stay away from authors I strongly disagree with - I am open to opinions but there are lines I would not cross (and there is a difference between opinion and lunacy) :)\n\nAs for awards and prizes and praised books -- I tend to look at these a lot more critically than I used to. I know that some of them just clash with my idea of what a good book is -- so I look at the lists occasionally but I generally ignore them. Most of them are for modern non-genre fiction -- what the world likes and what I do differ a bit it seems like so... I just ignore the awards. And that is valid both for modern times and for any old award...\n\nIf anything, I am more annoyed with books seemingly set in the past but having the heroes (and especially the heroines) behaving as if they were born in the 21st century and having all the questionable parts of the era scrubbed clean and removed or muted.\n\n50Cancellato\n\nMar 5, 2020, 8:20 pm\n\nI cannot stand Herland by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. A world full of eugenically engineered caucasian heterosexual women with suppressed sex drives governed by a central committee of control freaks.\n\nThat said, it's worth reading if only as a measure of how feminist thinking has changed over time.\n\nI like what >49 AnnieMod: said: \"When we stop reading the books with the problematic contents, we stop thinking about the problems. Which will allow them to crop back (not that most of them had really disappeared...)\"\n\n51wandering_star\n\nMar 5, 2020, 10:07 pm\n\n>49 AnnieMod:, >50 nohrt4me2: I was going to pick out that quote too. I think it's important to learn the historical lesson that what is perceived as acceptable changes over time, because it encourages us to think about our own beliefs and assumptions, and wonder what we do now that will seem crazy in the future. I don't really like attempts to hide that away (like airbrushing the cigar from photos of Churchill). And when there is controversy* about whether to keep a statue, for example, I think it would be best to keep the statue but add something which makes people think about the past, and what we choose to commemorate, and what that says about us. (I have heard about this happening somewhere, I think in Australia or New Zealand, but my google skills have failed me).\n\n*I don't mean that statues should never be replaced. But if two groups of people disagree about whether a statue should stay up, why not use that as an opportunity to think about modern society?\n\nIn terms of the content itself, I am always startled by the anti-semitism in early C20 novels - you often find a passing remark which is completely extraneous to the plot - which I suppose is a sign of just how pervasive it was in the society.\n\nBut in terms of continuing to read and appreciate a book, I think there's a difference between an outdated attitude being expressed through one comment or scene, and that attitude showing through in the plot, or continuously through the descriptions of the characters.\n\nI tend to stop reading books if they are very 'male gaze' but I find recently written books can be as bad at this as the mid-C20 examples. Earlier work doesn't seem to be like this.\n\n52lilisin\n\nMar 5, 2020, 10:07 pm\n\n>45 thorold:\n\nThat's true! I had forgotten about the word \"novel\". But The Roads to Sata was such a smooth read and with so many funny bits it seemed fitting to add!\n\nThe only way to add humor + novel would be for me to recommend Victor Hugo's The Last Day of a Condemned Man but that is very much DARK humor. Not exactly a giggle on the bus kind of read but definitely a dry haughty laugh at the absurdity of a situation kind of read.\n\n54thorold\n\nModificato: Mar 6, 2020, 5:44 am\n\nQ11: Yes, I think >49 AnnieMod: has almost killed the discussion on that one: we have to go on reading old books, with an awareness of the times they were written in. If we don't, it turns into Brave new world or Fahrenheit 451 — which both also count as old books, by now!\n\nA couple of months ago I saw the exhibition \"Foute boeken\" (\"incorrect books\") at the Meermanno Museum here in The Hague (https://www.meermanno.nl - it ran up to the end of February). They picked out an astonishing variety of books that for one reason or another we would have a problem with — colonialist missionary literature; children's books featuring comic characters who are negative racial stereotypes; books about conversion of Jews to Christianity; medical/anthropological textbooks full of dehumanising photos of naked non-white women; hideous racist propaganda from the thirties and from the German occupation; careers books showing boys growing up to be doctors, managers and engineers and girls becoming housewives, nurses and shop-assistants; seventies paperbacks (many of them by Jan Wolkers) with gratuitous naked women on the covers; and much more, right up to current schoolbooks published by Saudi or US religious organisations for use in developing countries. (And upstairs they had a complementary exhibition of \"banned books\" of the 17th century, featuring people like Spinoza....)\n\nVery interesting, in a lot of different ways, but especially because of the way it showed you a lot more of the iceberg than you normally get to look at. We generally only come across those items that we still have a good reason to look at, because they have some value apart from being \"wrong\", we forget what huge quantities of books there were that don't qualify for the \"controversial classic\" label, and which just echoed the attitudes of the time in a commercially-attractive way without any obvious added value for our own times. Thankfully there are librarians who take on the unpleasant job of preserving at least a sizeable fraction of that ephemeral junk so that we can study it if we want to.\n\nIt did make me wonder a bit (as I think it was meant to) about the whole idea of a \"negative\" exhibition. You couldn't help thinking about the Nazis and their shows of \"Entartete Kunst\" (\"degenerate art\"), in which visitors had to walk past a display of stuff they were meant to disapprove of. However, even though many of the exhibits were absolutely repulsive, there were also others that I couldn't help finding charming, despite knowing how wrong they were. Especially all those picture books with the naughty little black boy...\n\nBefore seeing that show, I would probably have answered the question with \"no, I'll read anything\". I read a lot of old books that have negative stuff in them (about race, gender, sexuality, religion, politics or whatever) that is more or less incidental to the main purpose of the book, and I think I'm grown-up enough to deal with that. My reading is unconsciously influenced by the ideology of the 21st century that I'm living in, of course, but I can be consciously aware of what I know of the ideology of the period the book was written in.\n\nBut now it's obvious to me that there's also a lot out there that no sensible person would want or need to read, except for the purpose of research (that was a Dutch exhibition, but mutatis mutandis the same must apply to the English-language space). So there are limits, but I wouldn't like to say exactly where they are...\n\n(You can see some images from the exhibition here, even if you can't read Dutch: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5857a11cbebafb3c0ffd0a05/t/5db308de4deaf7...\n\n55avaland\n\nModificato: Mar 6, 2020, 5:39 am\n\nThought I'd throw this 2011 opinion piece from the NY Times on Uncle Tom's Cabin (the #2 bestselling book of the 19th century in the US—after the Bible).\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/opinion/14Reynolds.html\n\nand two response letters:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/opinion/lweb21uncletom.html\n\n56japaul22\n\nMar 6, 2020, 8:44 am\n\nQuestion 11\n\nYes! I read a lot of classics and this is a constant problem. Off the top of my head, these books were problematic for me because of the inherent prejudices they contained.\n\nA Passage to India by E.M. Forster\n\n\"golden age\" mysteries by Josephine Tey\n\nGone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell\n\nEvelyn Waugh\n\nMany of these (and more I can't put my finger on right now) are British authors writing during a time when there simply was a perspective that white, English speakers were better than and more advanced than everyone else. They also contain many off hand derogatory references to Jewish people and black people. I think the scope of the book can affect this for me. If it's a big book with many themes and ideas and the racism is a small part of it, I can more easily see the big picture of the book and compartmentalize the rest - not accepting it, but adding it to my \"knowledge bank\" of how pervasive those sentiments were in that culture (this happens to me with Trollope sometimes who I've read extensively and is one of my favorite authors). I also am aware that there are likely plenty of books that I love now that 50 years down the road will be viewed as narrow-minded in some way or other that I might not see now.\n\nGone with the Wind is a huge issue for me. I LOVE that book - the characters, the romance, the dramatic setting - but it is hugely racist and perpetuates this idea that is still wrongly held in way to many American's minds that slaves were treated as part of the family and that many were \"better off\" as slaves or would have chosen to remain slaves if they could. I can read it knowing that that is absolutely false but knowing there are large pockets of people who STILL believe that has definitely colored by love of that book. I'm considering a reread of this on audiobook soon, and this will be something I ponder constantly if I reread it.\n\n57thorold\n\nMar 6, 2020, 9:06 am\n\n>56 japaul22: I think Forster would have been rather upset at the suggestion that he thought \"white, English speakers were better than and more advanced than everyone else\" — from his point of view he was writing a book that pilloried exactly the sort of people who had opinions like that. It's only from our perspective a hundred years on that we start to see his portrayal of some of the Indian characters as rather more patronising than he would have wanted. I don't think he's really any more patronising to Doctor Aziz than he is to Leonard Bast in Howards End — there's far more class prejudice in Forster than there is racism.\n\n58avaland\n\nMar 6, 2020, 10:15 am\n\n>56 japaul22: This occurred to me in the previous question when I answered the question asking for a recommendation for a series one could get lost in. And I thought about Scott's Raj Quartet. I haven't read it since the 80s. I remember thinking it was kind of edgy back then. How would it read now, I wonder? (I'm unlikely to re-read it; too many other books I haven't read.\n\n59rocketjk\n\nMar 6, 2020, 10:39 am\n\nI enjoy reading older history very much for the \"double-story\" that one can get. First is the historians relating of the history at hand and second is the information that one gets about the attitudes prevelent at the time of the book's writing by the attitudes the historian reveals in his or her writing. Not long ago I read a long, in-depth biography of Andrew Jackson which won a Pulitzer Prize for Biography when it was published in the 1930s. Not only did the author go out of his way to assure us that Jackson's slaves were well treated, he took the time (the author, this is) to offer us a whole-hearted defense of slavery. Again, that book won a Pulitzer. So I not only learned a lot about Jackson and his era (filtering out, as best I could, the hagiography aspect of the work), but I also learned a lot about the racial attitudes that a well-respected historian felt comfortable including in his works.\n\nIn fiction, certainly many novels hold at least a trace of the prejudices likely to be inherent in the culture being written about and written by (i.e., the author). Offhand examples I can, as others have said, compartmentalize. When the author is purposefully trying to show us what he or she perceives to be the bad aspects of his/her subjects (\"look how lazy the so and so's are\" \"look how the watchamacallems love their money\"), that's when I find the book unsavory and may set it aside if I don't feel like I'm somehow being educated about the prejudice(s) at hand in terms of time and place in a worthwhile manner.\n\n60avaland\n\nMar 6, 2020, 11:02 am\n\nI'm going to add afterthought to that question....\n\n61cindydavid4\n\nMar 6, 2020, 11:24 am\n\nsorry accidentally unstarred this thread so i am behind\n\n9. I am a visual learner, and have a vividly imagined film playing in my head as I read, So the characters are sort of flat, but I imagine me as the character/narrator, and vier whatever that character is doing, who she interacts with, what he is seeing through that movie in my head. I might notice race, gender, disabilities and such but until the plot demands I pay attention I am apt to keep that in the background and still keep myself as the unseen narrator/character.\n\nSometimes I can hear a particular actor when I read; if they ever make a movie of Doc he must be played by Tom Hanks!\n\nAs an aside, growing up I really didn't pay much attention to who the author was, and often would be reading assuming it was a certain gender then be very surprised when I found it was different. .Am always impressed by authors who can write outside themselves and sometimes cringe when its really really obvious that they can't.\n\nI like some descriptions, but a pet peeve is a decription that is repeated ad nausum (yes yes, she has large blue eyes, got it, carry on) I love the description of Miss Havisham in Great Expectations. You get the background (jilted bride) and then the way the house is all set up for the wedding after many decades (cake and all) and then to the character herself. I see every part of that still in my mind )\n\nOne problem with that is going to an adaptation, and what I see is not the same as whats in my head. Lots of times its ok, other times it makes the movie hard to watch. (this years Little Women was so perfect in that so much came right from the book, and yet watching it did not bother me when it strayed, in fact I rather liked most of what I saw)\n\nRe diversity - I taught children with special needs for most of my adult life, and found it frustrating not to find realistic, complex characters in books for children who were the same. The stereotypes and myths that were perpetuated and still exist. fortunately t has changed considerably since I started in the 80s, there are so many wonderful fiction and non fiction reads that children and YA can enjoy and relate to. I think it is important for children to have that connection while at the same time give them opportunities to read books with characters different from themselves.\n\nOne of my favorite books as a child was The Five Chinese Brothers. I had it on my bookshelf at school till a teacher told me how much it hurt her as a child, and how children bullied her over it. I was sorry, and I removed the book but I think you could make those five brothers any race or nationality and the story would still work. There are problems with lots of older books, but I think they can be used with some adult guidance (either teacher or parent)\n\ngads this is long! sorry bout that but once I started thinking about diversity my mind went a bit wild. Would be interested in comments tho.\n\n62AnnieMod\n\nMar 6, 2020, 1:04 pm\n\n>51 wandering_star: I don't mean that statues should never be replaced. But if two groups of people disagree about whether a statue should stay up, why not use that as an opportunity to think about modern society?\n\nYeah and replacing just because they were set there from the previous regime (previous generation/whatever) erases history. When communism fell in Bulgaria, the new rulers decided that the best way to distance themselves from the old regime was to destroy anything created by it. It did not matter if it was good or bad - if it was created during the regime, it had to go. Statues, monuments, factories, the novels and the poetry written from the \"communist writers\" (not the propaganda ones - these were weak to start with... some people convinced themselves that if the writer is a communist, everything they write is tainted), the educational system - you name it, it had to go. Some things survived as shells and some monuments survived just because they were dealing with older periods (even if they were created during communism) but the attempt to erase history was there - and noone was shy about it - some of the big platforms people were elected on were \"let's erase the last 45 years\". Yes - some things had to go. But not on the scale it happened.\n\nI have a similar vibe from the South here in the States. Yes - a lot of the statues are offensive but they were built because people thought that they make sense. Leave them in place, add a second one next to them to balance it, add explanations and use them to teach why they are wrong always sounded a better way to deal with them. On the other hand with the current society climate, that will probably backfire anyway. Damned if you, damned if you don't.\n\nErasing history and forgetting it are bad. Germany could have chosen that path after WWII and chose a different one - and if there was one country that really wanted to forget and erase what was done in its name last century, that was it. And yet, that lesson never took elsewhere.\n\nOK... end of rant. Sorry about that :)\n\n>54 thorold:\n\nI wish I could have seen that exhibit. Comics especially tended to be really tied to stereotypes (easier to write for children this way I guess) - I had been reading the very first Golden Age comics on the DC side and some are cringe-worthy in that regard...\n\n>56 japaul22:\n\nThat is interesting. That list does not trigger such a reaction from me - if anything, I actually find them less problematic than some other stuff I had read. I wonder how much of it is how I grew up (outside of the English cannon) and the fact that for me, these are stories and not part of my history. The Golden Age mysteries and Gone with the Wind especially - I expect them to have the racial and class-based stereotypes so I just... read through them. But then Uncle Tom's Cabin and Gone with the Wind were some of the first books I ever read about African slavery -- long before it was covered in my history lessons or I was aware just how close to nowadays it ended - slavery in my part of the world had been something in the pre-Medieval periods (we've had other problems in the area...)\n\n63bragan\n\nModificato: Mar 9, 2020, 12:25 pm\n\nWow, am I behind on this thread. Lots and lots of interesting discussion here! Guess I'll chime in with my own two cents on on these last three questions.\n\nQuestion 9:\n\nI don't think I really have anything particularly good or useful to add to the discussions about diversity in books here. But I will say that the question about visualizing characters, and the answers to it, fascinate me in this weird sort of way. Because I myself have almost zero visual imagination whatsoever, to the extent that for a good chunk of my life I took it for granted that when people used phrases like \"the mind's eye\" or \"picturing it in my mind\" or \"well, there's an image!\" they meant them entirely metaphorically. Because that's how I meant them when I used them. I mean, who actually imagines seeing pictures in their head, right? I have since learned that this kind of assumption is very common with people who don't mentally visualize things, and that that moment when you realize other people aren't actually kidding about that whole \"mind's eye\" thing is pretty much always mindblowing for everybody who experiences it.\n\nAnyway, yeah. I don't visualize characters at all. I do sometimes (but not always) imagine distinctive voices for them. I may have a vague sense of what they ought to look like, whether they're fat or thin, that sort of thing (which, yes, may -- or may not -- include race and usually d"
