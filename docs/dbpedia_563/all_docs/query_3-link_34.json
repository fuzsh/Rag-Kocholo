        "text": "Never been to a SABR convention before? You’re missing out! Here are some highlights from our previous gatherings. Click on a link below to scroll down.\n\n1970s | 1980s | 1990s | 2000s | 2010s | 2020s\n\nSABR 1: Cooperstown, New York\n\nAugust 10, 1971\n\nNational Baseball Hall of Fame Library\n\nIn a meeting organized by L. Robert Davids, 16 interested “statistorians” gathered to form the Society for American Baseball Research on the second floor of the National Baseball Hall of Fame Library one day after the Induction Ceremony was held for Satchel Paige, the first Negro Leaguer elected, and eight other Veterans Committee selections, along with the Hall of Fame Game between the Cleveland Indians and Chicago Cubs.\n\nLearn more: Profiles of SABR’s founding members, “The Cooperstown 16”, including audio and video interviews\n\nSABR 2: Washington, D.C.\n\nJune 23-24, 1972\n\nCentral Quality Motel (Arlington, Virginia)\n\nFeatured speaker: Chuck Hinton\n\nBallgames: Orioles 3, Tigers 1 (Game 1); Tigers 2, Orioles 1 (Game 2)\n\nThirty-three members attended SABR’s second annual meeting — including four of the founders: Bob Davids, Paul Frisz, Cliff Kachline and Bob McConnell — despite massive flooding that weekend because of Hurricane Agnes. Recently retired MLB outfielder Chuck Hinton spoke about his job as Howard University baseball coach and hitting a home run off knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm. Films on the 1971 World Series and relief pitchers were also shown.\n\nSABR 3: Chicago, Illinois\n\nJune 22-24, 1973\n\nSheraton-Chicago Hotel\n\nFeatured speakers: Bob Elson, Dave Malarcher\n\nBallgame: A’s 14, White Sox 3\n\nTwenty-six members attended the third annual meeting at the Sheraton-Chicago Hotel on Michigan Avenue. Featured speakers were Bob Elson, longtime broadcaster who later received the Hall of Fame’s Ford C. Frick Award; and Negro Leaguer Dave Malarcher, who managed the Chicago American Giants to five pennants. Ballgame at Comiskey Park on Saturday night included “Welcome SABR members” message on the scoreboard.\n\nSABR 4: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nJune 22-24, 1974\n\nHoliday Inn\n\nFeatured speakers: Fred Lieb, Gene Kelley, Ted Page\n\nBallgame: Phillies 5, Mets 2 (Game 1); Phillies 8, Mets 5 (Game 2)\n\nForty members and guests attended the fourth meeting. Guest speakers included Phillies/Reds announcer Gene Kelley, Negro Leaguer Ted Page, and sports writer Fred Lieb — who founder Bob Davids often credited with legitimizing the Society in baseball circles. The Negro Leagues Committee also organized a meeting at the hotel with a dozen former players, including Hall of Famer Judy Johnson. Dick Cramer, who helped organize the convention, and Pete Palmer formed a new research committee on statistical analysis that would revolutionize the game.\n\nSABR 5: Boston, Massachusetts\n\nJuly 11-13, 1975\n\nChildren’s Inn\n\nKeynote speaker: Joe Dugan\n\nBallgame: Red Sox 10, Rangers 4\n\nSixty-four members attended the fifth convention, organized by SABR’s first Treasurer, Eric Simonsen. Guest speaker was Jumpin’ Joe Dugan, who regaled the audience with stories of Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Lefty Grove and former Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs. SABR members were guests of the Red Sox at Fenway Park on Saturday night, as Luis Tiant subdued the Rangers despite two rain delays. SABR established a permanent address for the first time in Cooperstown, New York.\n\nSABR 6: Chicago, Illinois\n\nJune 25-27, 1976\n\nHoward Johnson Motor Lodge\n\nKeynote speaker: Lew Fonseca\n\nBallgame: Mets 10, Cubs 2\n\nForty-five members attended the sixth convention — the second held in the Windy City — at the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge on Lake Shore Drive. Guest speaker was Lew Fonseca, the 1929 American League batting champion and former White Sox manager. Chicago Sun-Times sports writer Eddie Gold showed old highlight films of the Cubs and sports writer Jim Enright spoke at the Friday session. Former Pirates and White Sox infielder Tony Piet also spoke. John Milner’s grand slam off Bill Bonham keyed a six-run fourth inning as Jerry Koosman and the Mets cruised to a victory on Saturday afternoon at Wrigley Field. Free tickets were provided to SABR members, courtesy of the Arthur Meyerhoff Associates advertising agency.\n\nSABR 7: Columbus, Ohio\n\nJune 24-26, 1977\n\nHoliday Inn Downtown\n\nFeatured speaker: Johnny Bucha\n\nBallgame: Columbus Clippers 5, Tidewater Tides 4\n\nThe first convention held in a minor league city, which coincided with the 100th anniversary of Columbus’ first entry in the professional ranks with the Buckeyes of the International Association, was attended by 74 SABR members. Guest speaker at the Friday night “welcoming social” was former Cardinals/Tigers catcher Johnny Bucha, who was a mink farmer in Pennsylvania at the time. Future SABR President Kit Crissey organized a reunion that drew 24 former players — including Johnny Lipon, George Sisler Jr., Jim Fridley, Dick Hoover and Roy Hughes. Some of them later participated in an old-timers’ game umpired by SABR members Al Payson, Troy Soos and Tom Zamorski at the newly refurbished Franklin County Stadium, the first minor league park to have Astroturf.\n\nSABR 8: Paramus, New Jersey\n\nJuly 28-30, 1978\n\nParamus Parkway Holiday Inn\n\nKeynote speaker: Tony Lupien\n\nBallgame: Yankees 7, Twins 3\n\nThe eighth annual convention, attended by 81 members, was highlighted by the release of SABR’s groundbreaking Minor League Baseball Stars, the first major compilation of seasonal and career records for players, teams and leagues at that level. Bob Hoie and Ray Nemec spearheaded the effort to get the book ready for publication. Guest speaker was Tony Lupien, the longtime Dartmouth College coach who played with the Red Sox and Phillies during World War II; he gave a “scholarly discourse on player organizations, personnel management and the pension plan.” Kit Cressey organized another players panel, which included Jack Martin, Hinkey Haines, Charlie Hargreaves and Russ Van Atta. An old-timers’ game, narrated by Mel Allen, preceded the Saturday afternoon game at Yankee Stadium. But, as Bob Davids reported, “DiMaggio, Mantle, Maris, Ford and Berra all took a back seat when (the recently fired) Billy Martin came on the field to the announcement that he would be back as Manager in 1980.”\n\nSABR 9: St. Louis, Missouri\n\nJune 29-July 1, 1979\n\nLennox Hotel\n\nKeynote speaker: Mike Shannon\n\nBallgame: Phillies 6, Cardinals 4\n\nFor the first time, more than one hundred attendees — 115 to be exact, including 78 members — showed up for the annual convention, thanks in part to the promotion of off-site activities around the city for spouses and children of SABR members. Former Cardinals World Series hero Mike Shannon, already a seven-year veteran of their broadcast team, was the keynote speaker at the banquet. Negro Leagues great James “Cool Papa” Bell became the first of many Hall of Fame inductees to speak at a SABR convention. Former players Andy High of the “Gas House Gang” Cardinals and Buddy Blattner also spoke, along with longtime SABR member Bob Broeg, a St. Louis sports writing legend. At Busch Stadium, SABR members saw Del Unser hit a dramatic game-tying home run with two outs in the ninth as the Phillies won in extra innings.\n\nAudio: Listen to Cool Papa Bell, Andy High, and Buddy Blattner’s talks at the 1979 SABR Convention (courtesy of Cleveland Public Library)\n\nSABR 10: Los Angeles, California\n\nJuly 11-13, 1980\n\nTravelodge Hotel at Los Angeles International Airport\n\nKeynote speaker: Roy Smalley Jr.\n\nBallgame: A’s 5, Angels 4\n\nAttendance for the 10th annual convention, the first one held on the West Coast, was 85, with 62 of them being active SABR members. Former National League shortstop Roy Smalley Jr. fielded questions about his son, All-Star infielder Roy Smalley III, and his brother-in-law, longtime manager Gene Mauch. A Friday players panel included 1930 Braves rookie sensation Wally Berger; Negro Leagues catcher Quincy Trouppe; Bert Shepard, who lost a leg in World War II and returned to pitch; and American League umpire Joseph Rue. SABR members saw another old-timers’ game, this time at the “Big A” in Anaheim, marking the Angels’ 20th season in the American League. Eleven research presentations were delivered, including one on statistical support in broadcasting by longtime Dodgers statistican Allan Roth, later to be namesake of SABR’s Los Angeles chapter. Meanwhile that summer, in Lawrence, Kansas, Bill James coined the phrase “sabermetrics” to describe the study of statistical analysis in baseball.\n\nRead more: A look back at SABR 10 in Los Angeles\n\nSABR 11: Toronto, Ontario\n\nJuly 24-26, 1981\n\nUniversity of Toronto, Erindale campus\n\nKeynote speaker: None (panel presentation)\n\nBallgame: None (MLB labor dispute)\n\nThe first convention held outside the United States drew another record attendance of 147, including 97 members. Preparations for the convention were hampered by the MLB players’ strike and the Canada Post labor dispute, but organizers Bill Humber and Dave Crichton were still able to mail all correspondence to SABR members during business trips to New York. Hall of Famer Early Wynn, then a Blue Jays broadcaster, also canceled his scheduled banquet appearance at the last minute, so the keynote speech became a panel discussion that included former major leaguers Goody Rosen, Phil Marchildon, Roy Hughes and Reno Bertoia. Former Negro Leaguers Gene Benson, Buddy Burbage, Jeep McLain and Sy Morton were joined by novelist John Craig for another panel. Convention attendees were saddened by the May 29 death of SABR member John Tattersall, “the national authority on home runs hit in the majors.” Tattersall’s research on home runs was continued by Bob McConnell and, later, David Vincent. SABR’s Tattersall-McConnell Home Run Encyclopedia has been licensed to Baseball-Reference.com and is publicly available there.\n\nRead more: John Thorn explains why he became a SABR member at the 1981 convention — and why you should be, too.\n\nRelated link: Read John Thorn’s review of SABR 11 in The Sporting News (August 8, 1981)\n\nSABR 12: Baltimore, Maryland\n\nJune 25-27, 1982\n\nTowson State University\n\nKeynote speaker: Sparky Anderson\n\nBallgame: Orioles 4, Tigers 1\n\nA lively convention saw another explosion in attendance, this time to 227 (including 151 members), “by far the biggest event the Society has participated in during its 11 years,” as Bob Davids reported. Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell delivered the invocation at the Saturday banquet and then introduced the main speaker, manager Sparky Anderson, who offered “a testimonial of his … good fortune of going from a .218 hitter to a World Champion manager.” Rex Barney, former Dodgers pitcher and longtime Orioles public-address announcer, also spoke; Dick Beverage, Bob Bluthardt, Dutch Doyle, Cappy Gagnon and Ron Liebman delivered impromptu presentations, while Bill James held a Q&A session. The Friday night panel included former Rangers manager Billy Hunter, SABR member Roy Hughes and Towson State star Al Rubeling. The Orioles generously provided 200 free tickets to Saturday night’s game — No. 24 in Cal Ripken Jr.’s record-setting streak.\n\nRead more: A look back at SABR 12 in 1982\n\nSABR 13: Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nJuly 15-17, 1983\n\nMashuda Hall, Marquette University\n\nKeynote speaker: Hal Goodenough\n\nBallgame: Brewers 5, Twins 0\n\nHal Goodenough, a boyhood teammate of Mickey Cochrane and former member of the Braves’ front office, was the guest speaker for the 13th annual convention, which set another record with 262 attendees (including 205 members). It was the third straight convention held on a college campus facility. The players panel consisted of Ken Keltner (also a SABR member), Andy Pafko, Mike Hegan, Fabian Gaffke, umpire Stan Landes and Negro Leaguers Lester Lockett and Ted “Double Duty” Radcliffe. A “traditional Milwaukee” tailgate party was held before the Saturday night game, which featured a Moose Haas three-hit shutout over the Twins.\n\nSABR 14: Providence, Rhode Island\n\nJuly 6-8, 1984\n\nBrown University\n\nKeynote speaker: Lou Gorman\n\nBallgame: Pawtucket Red Sox 7-3 and 4-2 over Rochester Red Wings (doubleheader); 1884 vintage game\n\nThe 14th convention, which drew another record crowd of 350 (including 230-plus members), was held in Providence to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the 1884 World Series between the Providence Grays and the New York Metropolitans. A symposium on that season was led by Joe Lawler, Dick Waldbauer, Fred Ivor-Campbell, John Husman (great-grandson of John Lee Richmond) and Fred Stinson. Lou Gorman, a Providence native then in his first year as general manager of the Boston Red Sox, was the banquet speaker. The player panel consisted of Clem Labine, Dave Stenhouse, Tony Lupien and Pawtucket Red Sox owner Ben Mondor, who generously offered McCoy Stadium as the venue for SABR’s re-enactment of the 1884 World Series between games of an International League doubleheader. A workshop on writing and publishing was led by Linda Levin and James A. Peterson. The 1884 “vintage game” (right), featuring replica uniforms produced by the Textiles Department at the University of Rhode Island, was delayed by rain and the five innings had to be split up (three innings before the first PawSox game and two-and-a-half before the second PawSox game). The SABR “Mets” got revenge on their real-life World Series defeat by beating the SABR “Grays,” 4-3. But, as Rich “Dixie” Tourangeau recalled, “with all the greatest SABR minds either in the stands or on the field, not one had thought to record a box score of the game … an unforgettable oversight.” This year was the first SABR convention with its own journal, a series of nearly three dozen articles from the Providence Journal from 1875 to 1885 documenting the history of major-league baseball in the city.\n\nRead more: Rich “Dixie” Tourangeau shares his memories of SABR 14 vintage game\n\nRead more: Download a PDF of Days of Greatness, the SABR 14 convention journal\n\nSABR 15: Oakland, California\n\nJuly 11-14, 1985\n\nHyatt Regency\n\nKeynote speaker: Roy Eisenhardt\n\nBallgame: A’s 11, Brewers 2\n\nSABR’s return to the West Coast saw an attendance of 293 for the 15th annual convention. Oakland A’s president Roy Eisenhardt was the featured speaker at the banquet. The Friday player panel consisted of Philadelphia A’s all-star Sam Chapman, ex-major leaguer Earl Robinson and longtime Oakland Oaks catcher Bill Raimondi. A Saturday presentation by sports writer Leonard Koppett was followed by a sabermetrics panel discussion with Bill James, Allan Roth and Pete Palmer. On Sunday, members saw the A’s defeat the Brewers with SABR providing trivia questions for the Oakland Coliseum scoreboard. Bob McConnell, one of SABR’s 16 founding members, won the inaugural Bob Davids Award, SABR’s highest honor.\n\nRead more: Learn more about SABR 15 in this Sports Illustrated article by Austin Murphy from April 28, 1986\n\nSABR 16: Chicago, Illinois\n\nJuly 17-20, 1986\n\nLoyola University, Lakeshore campus\n\nKeynote speaker: Bill Gleason\n\nBallgame: Cubs 11, Giants 6\n\nThe SABR convention’s popularity continued to grow, as a record 479 members and guests attended SABR 16 in Chicago. It was the last national convention held at a college campus using dormitory rooms and cafeteria dining. Bill Gleason, the longtime Chicago Sun-Times columnist, was the banquet speaker on Saturday night following a sweltering ballgame at Wrigley Field in 96-degree heat. Rich Topp reports: “Roland Hemond was willing to give us 500 free tickets to the White Sox game, but a survey of the membership wanted to see the Cubs. So we took a tour of Comiskey Park and Roland gave us 500 free batting helmets instead. The Cubs wouldn’t do tours. So we got ’em back by taking our helmets to the Cubs game. When Harry Caray led the singing in the seventh inning, the TV camera scanned the area of SABR members and we all wore helmets with ‘SOX’ on them.” Chico Carrasquel, John Klippstein, Rich Nye, Ted “Double Duty” Radcliffe (right, shown with Mark Kanter), Marv Rotblatt and Nelson Potter made up the player panel. Local chapter members also put out a 56-page special publication called Baseball in Chicago, with articles celebrating the 80th anniversary of the Cubs-White Sox World Series of 1906. Joe Simenic, another one of the “Cooperstown 16”, won the second Bob Davids Award.\n\nPhoto gallery: View a collection of photos from SABR 16 courtesy of Mark Kanter\n\nRead more: Download a PDF of Baseball in Chicago, the SABR 16 convention journal\n\nSABR 17: Washington, D.C.\n\nJune 26-29, 1987\n\nCrystal City Marriott (Arlington, Virginia)\n\nKeynote speaker: John Steadman\n\nBallgame: National Old-Timers’ Baseball Classic, RFK Stadium\n\nThe 17th annual convention set an attendance record of 631 that wouldn’t be topped for 15 years. The convention featured more than 15 hours of research presentations, a player panel headlined by Milt Pappas, tours of Baltimore’s Memorial Stadium (the Orioles were out of town) and the Babe Ruth birthplace. The premiere of Eddie Frierson’s award-winning one-man show Matty, written and performed by the longtime SABR member from California (right), was delivered at SABR 17. Longtime Baltimore sports writer John Steadman delivered the banquet speech. SABR members also got front-row seats for the sixth annual old-timers’ game, which featured the newest members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, Catfish Hunter and Billy Williams. Frierson, dressed as Christy Mathewson, pitched batting practice to Joe DiMaggio and Hank Aaron, among others.\n\nPhoto gallery: View a collection of photos from SABR 17 courtesy of Mark Kanter\n\nSABR 18: Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nJuly 7-10, 1988\n\nHoliday Inn Metrodome\n\nKeynote speaker: Andy MacPhail\n\nBallgame: Brewers 5, Twins 4\n\nAndy MacPhail, the young general manager of the Twins, delivered the keynote address to a crowd of 340 members and guests in Minneapolis. Minor league home run legend Joe Hauser was a special guest speaker. Actor Peter Thoemke performed “Casey at the Bat” at the convention opening, while the players panel consisted of former AL Rookie of the Year John Castino, original Twin Julio Becquer, two-sport star Howie Schultz and Negro Leaguer Collins Jones. More than 30 research presentations were given, including “The Ebbets Field Diamond Jubilee” by Ron Gabriel, “The 30-30 Club” by Cappy Gagnon and “The Great Minneapolis-St. Paul Baseball Rivalry” by Stew Thornley.\n\nRead more: A look back at SABR 18 in Minneapolis\n\nSABR 19: Albany, New York\n\nJune 23-26, 1989\n\nKeynote speaker: Bobby Brown\n\nBallgame: Albany Yankees 4, Eastern League All-Stars 3\n\nSABR’s most tumultous national convention welcomed 524 members and guests.

At a wild business meeting, Holway motioned to unseat the entire board (it failed) and withdrew his name as a candidate for president. Rich Topp, nominated from the floor, was elected in a close vote.\n\nRead more: Download a PDF of Empire State of Baseball, the SABR 19 convention journal\n\nSABR 20: Cleveland, Ohio\n\nJuly 27-29, 1990\n\nSheraton Cleveland City Centre\n\nKeynote speaker: Sam McDowell\n\nBallgame: Yankees 8, Indians 5 (Game 1); Yankees 4, Indians 3 (Game 2)\n\nSABR’s 20th convention saw 481 members and guests, as 1960 Indians fireballer “Sudden” Sam McDowell was the awards banquet speaker and Hall of Famer Bob Feller headlined a player panel during his first convention in Cleveland.
