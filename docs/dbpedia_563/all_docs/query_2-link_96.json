        "text": "Team USA has been off to a great start in the 2024 Olympics, winning every game so far. The team is anchored by an aging but still dominant LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant‘s Olympic shooting, and the electric highlights of Anthony Edwards. However, one player was expected to be more dominant than he’s been so far. Joel Embiid is supposed to be the US’ anchor in the paint, swatting shots and bullying opposing centers. Despite Embiid’s resume, however, Anthony Davis has been significantly outplaying him. The 7’1″ big man has struggled with foul trouble and opposing matchups, leading to him even being benched in some games. Embiid’s lackluster Olympic performance has been drawing criticism, including from Mr. Charles Barkley.\n\nNBA Hall of Famer Rips Embiid’s Olympic Performance\n\nEmbiid’s performance in the Olympics hasn’t been much to write home about. Matched up against Serbia and NBA rival Nikola Jokic, Embiid had…four points. Two go along with that, he also had two rebounds, three fouls, and two turnovers. The next game, against South Sudan, he received a DNP (coach’s choice). Steve Kerr explained that the US wanted to match up well against the speed of South Sudan, and Embiid was not the ideal choice for that matchup. He fared better against Puerto Rico, scoring 15 points. However, he only grabbed three rebounds (a 7’1″ center should have more) and had three turnovers.\n\nAs a whole, Embiid isn’t a great fit with Team USA’s game and play style. The team tries to play fast, and there’s a lot of off-ball moving and action, just like with Kerr’s championship-winning Warriors teams. However, Embiid is slow and operates best when he has the ball in the post. It’s how things run in Philly, and the adjustment has been difficult for Embiid.\n\nBarkley’s Criticism\n\nThe comments came from an interview that Barkley did on Paul George‘s podcast, Podcast P. When speaking about Embiid’s Olympic performance he had the following to say:\n\n“I hope this is a wakeup for Joel, this Olympic experience. He has not played well, and I’m hoping he’s like, ‘yo man, I got to get in better shape.’ Me personally, I think that’s one of the reasons he’s always injured. I don’t think he’s in good enough shape.”\n\nHe followed that up by saying Embiid needs to take more responsibility, and that if he doesn’t get healthy and in better shape, and the 76ers don’t win a championship or go deep in the playoffs, it’ll be his fault.\n\nThat piece of criticism does make sense. Embiid has played with some very talented teams during his time with the 76ers. He had Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons in 2019, James Harden and Tyrese Maxey these past few, and good supporting role players and three-point shooters to space the floor. The one constant on all the 76ers teams that haven’t made it out of the first round is Embiid, and his health has been a struggle since he came into the league.\n\nThe other thing Barkley pointed out is how the league has changed. The NBA as a whole is guard-dominant, faster-paced, and reliant on shooting. Giants like Embiid that dominated in other decades can still dominate today…but differently. Shooting is much more important than it used to be. Ironically, Embiid’s game should be suited better for the playoffs: all the games slow down and are mostly played in the half-court. Yet, Embiid still has yet to make it out of the second round.\n\nSlight Hypocrisy\n\nBarkley won an Olympic gold medal in 1992, so he does know what he’s talking about. At the same time, it seems hypocritical for Barkley of all people to criticize Embiid about his weight and being in shape. Barkley may have had fewer injuries throughout his career, but this is the man who had a pizza delivery guy show up to one of his games before tip-off; the man who didn’t want the 76ers to draft him because he thought they wouldn’t pay him enough, and gained 30 pounds in two days; and the man who ate pizza during morning practices on a stationary bike, yelling at his running teammates and telling them they weren’t working hard enough."
