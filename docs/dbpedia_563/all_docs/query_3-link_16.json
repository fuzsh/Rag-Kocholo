        "text": "Ex-Essendon player and current Survivor star David Zaharakis is selling the Lower Plenty house where 170 people attended his 30th birthday.\n\nThe four-bedroom home at 127 Bonds Rd features an indoor basketball and squash court, theatre room, a bar in the billiards room and pool.\n\nRELATED: Fraser Lack talks about his villain role in upcoming season\n\nAFL champ Wayne Carey tackles real estate gig for old rival\n\nGreat Gatsby-like Lower Plenty Deco house joined by glass gem\n\nFIRST HOME\n\nI lived in Diamond Creek, as my first move out of my family home.\n\nThat was another great entertaining house with an amazing street presence.\n\nI bought it purely because of the entertaining aspect.\n\nIt was a four-bedroom modern house, with open-plan living, a theatre room, spa, outdoor entertaining space with projector. I had many, many parties over the years.\n\nCURRENT HOME\n\nI love how quiet the place is. It is an oasis to come home to.\n\nThe house sits around 100m from the street, with the back decking facing the trees of the nearby golf course, it is a perfect combination of quiet and serene living. I love the privacy.\n\nThe house has character, with remnants of the original build still featured post a massive renovation.\n\nI love the split level into a lounge room, boasting a fireplace perfect for Melbourne winters. However, I cannot go past the pool table room overlooking the basketball court.\n\nI love the entertaining aspect of the home, it is an entertainer’s paradise.\n\nI had my 30th at this house and there were roughly 170 people present throughout the night. Parties around the pool are perfect when the back yard and pool lights are lit up at night.\n\nI’ve had a huge house-warming party, my 30th birthday, Grand Final days, Melbourne Cup, Christmas Day, NYE, Survivor premiere – you name the event and I’ve probably had a party at my house because of it.\n\nI had my 200th AFL game post-match celebrations at my house in 2019. That was a very late one.\n\nA few other occasions I had the team over for recovery in the pool with a barbecue, after a big Saturday morning training session.\n\nAlso, various dinners over the years with teammates.\n\nI’ve had some Survivor co-stars come visit and stay but I cannot name them at this point, that might spoil the show.\n\nDREAM HOME\n\nThis is a difficult one to answer.\n\nI’m someone who loves to travel and wants to own property in all different parts of the world – you can dream big, right?\n\nA house in the Greek islands would be amazing.\n\nA little French village at the bottom of the Alps.\n\nIn Norway, where you can live amongst snow all year round.\n\nA house on an island in South-East Asia.\n\nOr a place in Boulder, Colorado at the base of the Rockies. One of my favourite places in the world to visit.\n\nIf any of those houses had a space for entertaining – that’s all I need.\n\nZaharakis’ house is for sale with $3.8m-$4.1m asking range.\n\nExpressions of interest close at 5pm on February 21.\n\nMorrison Kleeman Eltham, Greensborough and Doreen director Craig Parker has the listing.\n\nSign up to the Herald Sun Weekly Real Estate Update.
