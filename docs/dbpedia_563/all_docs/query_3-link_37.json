        "text": "Research on South African marine biology and biodiversity commenced during the colonial years in the 17th century. Infrastructure grew rapidly with an increase in the European settler population allowing for the establishment in 1825 of the first museum in sub-Saharan Africa, the South African Museum. The European settlers of South Africa included naturalists and taxonomists from Britain and Europe, who came to study the local biota. European colonialism, therefore, brought upon a new era of scientific discoveries, for example by conducting large marine surveys along the South African coastline, and bringing considerable scientific expertise to the region. In addition to the large collections assembled by various scientific cruises such as the HMS Challenger and RV Meiring Naudé, systematic research was carried out in order to understand biodiversity and distribution patterns along the South African coast. These studies, however, were focussed mainly on fish, molluscs and crustaceans, and certain benthic marine invertebrates, such as sponges and bryozoans, were neglected. Consequently, taxonomic studies on the South African Bryozoa are, in part, outdated and fragmentary with spatial and temporal gaps in our biodiversity knowledge. The first published account of South African bryozoan was that of Hincks (1880), but majority of description of species were provided by George Busk using specimens in the British Museum and Challenger collections. Most of the South African collections were taken back to Europe and lodged at various European museums, including the Natural History Museum, London. The sensitive issue surrounding repatriation of collections belonging to South Africa is debatable. Assigning European names to South African specimens were very common and synonymies still need to be resolved. Florence et al. (2007) estimated that, to date, over 270 valid bryozoan species have been recorded in South African waters, but temporal and spatial gaps in our biodiversity knowledge may yield several new species and records. Over 1,500 bryozoan samples, the majority from south coast collections stored at SAMC, have remained undetermined. Therefore, valuable historical and recent data “locked” in museum collections have the potential to aid in understanding marine benthic diversity and biogeography of the marine realm around South Africa."
