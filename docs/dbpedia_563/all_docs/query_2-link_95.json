        "text": "Michael Vaughan has led the tributes to Graham Thorpe after the former England batter’s passing at the age of 55.\n\nThorpe spent more than a decade as a middle-order stalwart of England’s Test side, scoring 16 hundreds and averaging nearly 45 in exactly 100 Tests.\n\nOne of England’s most reliable batters in a relatively lean period, Thorpe scored hundreds in all conditions against a number of high-quality attacks, and memorably steered his side to victory in the dark in Karachi in 2000 to end Pakistan’s 34-match unbeaten run at home.\n\nHe concluded his career just prior to 2005 Ashes as the emergence of Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen left him on the outside loking in, recording his final Test ton under Vaughan’s captaincy against South Africa in December 2004.\n\n“RIP Thorpey,” Vaughan wrote on X as he paid tribute to his former teammate. “Thanks for all the advice throughout my career, you were a great player and a brilliant teammate. You have gone far too young but you leave as an England cricket legend… Thoughts with all who knew Thorpey and to all the family xxx.”\n\nFormer England all-rounder Ronnie Irani said he was “heartbroken” by the news. “Me, like many others who were fortunate to know Thorpey, will be heartbroken today,” Irani said on X. “A genuine fun loving friend who with Phil Tufnell on my first England Tour took me in as a buddy. We had incredible times together and my love will never fade away. Great batsman too.”\n\nAfter concluding his time as a player, Thorpe moved into coaching, guiding England’s batters during two separate stints with the national side and was exceptionally popular with the playing group.\n\nCurrent England opener Ben Duckett, and fellow left-hander, wrote on X: “Heartbreaking to see Thorpey has passed away. He was one of my heroes growing up and I was fortunate to work with him.\n\n“My thoughts go out to all of his friends and family during this tough time.”\n\nMen’s Test captain Ben Stokes, meanwhile, posted four heart emojis alongside a photo of him wearing a shirt bearing Thorpe’s name and England cap number.\n\nStokes wore the shirt for the toss against New Zealand at Lord’s after Thorpe fell ill in 2022.\n\nFormer Sri Lanka and Surrey batter Kumar Sangakkara added on X: “Rest in Peace Thorpey. Great man and legend. Thoughts with his family, loved ones and friends. Gone far too early.”"
