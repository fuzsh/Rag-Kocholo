        "text": "EnLink Midstream founder, chairman and CEO Barry Davis is retiring and turning over the reins of the Fortune 500 company to a former executive of pipeline giant Kinder Morgan.\n\nDavis, who grew the Dallas-based energy firm from pre-tax earnings of $15 million in 2002 to a projected $1.2 billion this year, will step down from the top job next week when Jesse Arenivas becomes chief executive of the company. He’ll continue in an advisory role until Aug. 31.\n\nDavis led EnLink Midstream’s predecessor, Crosstex Energy, from its founding in 1996 through its 2014 multibillion-dollar merger with the midstream business of Devon Energy Corp., the deal that created EnLink.\n\n“Building EnLink and serving as its CEO has been one of the great accomplishments of my life,” Davis said in a statement. EnLink’s revenue topped $6.6 billion last year, marking a 72% increase from 2020.\n\nHe had stepped aside previously as CEO but returned to the role in 2019 during the oil and gas industry’s downturn.\n\nArenivas joins EnLink after about 20 years at Kinder Morgan, where he helped the Houston-based company grow as a transporter of carbon dioxide capture in North America. He led its CO2 segment for seven years and became leader of Kinder Morgan’s energy transition ventures team early last year.\n\nPursuing CO2 capture and sequestration opportunities is a key part of EnLink’s future strategy.\n\n“Jesse is the kind of visionary leader who will undoubtedly enable the EnLink team to realize our ‘Future of Midstream’ vision,” Davis said.\n\nArenivas holds a bachelor’s degree in finance from the University of Texas Permian Basin and is a certified public accountant.\n\nEnLink described Davis’ retirement as part of a succession plan. He’ll be replaced as board chairman by Leldon Echols, who has served on the board since 2008.\n\nEnLink operates more than 11,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines from resource-rich regions like the Permian Basin to market hubs, where the commodities are sold. Its core operating regions are Oklahoma, the Permian Basin, Louisiana and North Texas."
