        "text": "Wake-up call??\n\n7/30/2024\n\nWhat a surreal month of U.S. election season bombshells. Going into the first debate, I never would have predicted that President Joe Biden would subsequently drop out of the 2024 presidential race and put the possibility of America's first woman President back on the table. I'm also still alarmed by how close of a call that assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump was, and appalled at the politicians trying to milk votes out of it. Instead of warping it into a photo op and making T-shirts, this should be a serious wake-up call to de-escalate the partisan politics--not stoke more election violence full steam ahead.\n\nIncidentally, I scrolled through TMZ to get the full scoop on the shooting because I don't need my news curated and editorialized by pundits and partisans. All of the doom spiralling on the news and the Internet is what led me to cut a lot of that out of my life--the equivalent of me ripping anxiety away from my mind console, if you will. I've also been trying not to think about my mortality now that I'm retired, as I think back to each relative whose body and/or mind deteriorated and can't help wondering which of these fates will befall me.\n\nSometimes I wish NoPixel awarded Oscars for outstanding acting performances, because I'd contend that the ICU argument between Allie and Rue over their six months worth of beef (provoked by Lane's overdose) would at least deserve a nomination. I still don't understand Allie's side of the argument, but it was refreshing how each of their points seemed different without any repetition.\n\nI also tip my hat to the City Council RP and the interesting conflict RP that Mayor Maximilian Thoroughbred and his wife spread around. With Chief Justice Alan Crane now retired and the City Council now dissolved, I made a special effort to archive all six months of their legislative work in the NoPixel wiki. Admittedly, I saw some karma in how his RP got shut down much like he and Senator Davis denied RP to people not named Andi.\n\nI'm glad Buddha made that comment against shooters, as I blame that and lootboxing for the rampant toxicity on NoPixel nowadays. In contrast, I've only seen the Raiders MC shoot down two total people their entire time in the city--and the rarity of that made those two shootings feel that much more shocking and dramatic (kind of like how big a deal it was whenever The Stable shot PD). I particularly like how much thought the Raiders MC put into their lore and ceremonies, and how seriously they take RP. The only ingredient missing is the dumb luck that made The Stable so riveting to watch, e.g., the perfect archnemesis in Det. Hardcastle, The Stable accidentally ruining Lang's coke run, Kirk accidentally interrupting his own police raid, and Lang ocean dumping Dante after weeks of him ignoring Nancy's warnings that his crown vic looked like an undercover police car.\n\nWatched movie: \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" (2024) in IMAX with Laser\n\nA prequel with some decent suspense sequences and tense moments where the camera focused on things that made noise. But I started getting bored when the plot shifted toward making the hospice patient happy. I also lowered my rating because of my disbelief that a cat would behave so impeccably. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"Kinds of Kindness\" (2024) in Laser\n\nThree brutal satires directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, two of which spoke to the hardened cynic in me, i.e., the story about the micromanaging boss controlling the guy's career, and the story about the splintering marriage. I don't know what the point of that third story was. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"MaXXXine\" (2024)\n\nTi West's sequel to \"X\" where adult star Maxine Minx gets cast in a horror movie in 1985 Hollywood. I liked the whole grindhouse feel of the film, and how it depicted the salacious underbelly of 1980s rather than just the usual pop culture themes and synthesizer music. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Despicable Me 4\" (2024) in 3D\n\nI hate cockroaches and have Minion fatigue, so Gru pretty much carried the movie for me. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"Longlegs\" (2024)\n\nReminiscent of Silence of the Lambs but with a more neurodivergent FBI agent (played by Maika Monroe) and a wackier Buffalo Bill (played by Nicolas Cage). I found both characters oddly mesmerizing. Rating: 7\n\nWatched movie: \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" (2024) in 3D\n\nDeadpool's the perfect superhero for this whole MCU multiverse era with his penchant for meta commentary and roasting of second-rate characters. Unfortunately, I never acquired a taste for his fourth wall breaks and sexual jokes. Stay during and after the credits. Rating: 6\n\nThe end of the Big Three?\n\n6/30/2024\n\nWith Roger Federer retired from tennis, a 37-year-old Rafael Nadal losing in the first round of French Open for first time (after coming into this tournament with a 112-3 win-loss record), and a 37-year-old Novak Djokovic withdrawing from the French Open to undergo knee surgery, are we witnessing the end of the Big Three? If so, Djokovic leads with 24 Grand Slam singles titles (including a record 10 Australian Open titles), Nadal follows with 22 Grand Slam singles titles (including a record 14 French Open titles), and Federer finished with 20 Grand Slam singles titles (including a record 8 Wimbledon titles and a joint-record of 5 US Open titles). Admittedly, Nadal got a really unlucky first round draw against the winner of the previous clay court tournament, Alexander Zverev.\n\nI was excited to read that Suzanne Collins is writing another Hunger Games prequel novel, \"Sunrise on the Reaping\", that will be adapted into a new movie. I've always wanted a film about Haymitch's Hunger Games, a Quarter Quell that had reaped double the number of tributes.\n\nI've been enjoying this latest NoPixel storyline where the devs smiled upon (?) the Raiders MC with two Chumash turfs in a city starved for them, forcing them to RP with a lot of different gangs jockeying for the second turf. By pure coincidence, the Raiders MC, ADMC, The Hidden, Hades, and undercover police investigators all happened to converge at Chumash Pier for a climactic finale to the storyline. It felt like a NoPixel event akin to Sanguine Isle that spread a lot of great RP to a whole variety of gang members and police officers. I was also surprised to read actual informed opinions about it on the Internet, even the ones I disagreed with (like viewers expecting Lane to conform to the same gang politics as ADMC, whose high command made multiple enemies all over the city).\n\nAlthough it was amazing to see Lane finally meet ADMC leader Barry in an unexpected and combative confrontation six months in the making, I cringed at his unintelligible lecture on how the Raiders MC should manage their own turf. I've been disappointed by how openly condescending he, Irish, and Shang have been toward the newer, smaller gangs in 4.0 and how quick they've been to threaten and shoot rather than listen (I also knew it was only a matter of time before the ADMC lost Andi just like they lost Nancy). Given the lack of train tickets in ADMC, maybe they should keep an open mind to a relationship-based group like the Raiders MC where all eight of their members earned prio. Hint: they didn't earn prio by how many police they shot (zero), how many gangs they clapped (they've only had one gunfight this entire year), or even how skilled they are at crime (I recently saw their Road Captain Maxx starting a postmortem with Lane while people were still being actively chased). They also don't blood members out for honest correctable mistakes--I'd be willing to bet that blurting too much to the police in the Raiders MC wouldn't even get a fine. I keep thinking of that DS9 episode where the Jem'Hadar leader executed his own second-in-command for picking a fight with Worf--then watched in disbelief as Sisko sent Worf to his room.\n\nI'm still dismayed that the Raiders MC Nomad Taylor just left them without hearing their side of the story to be closer to the ADMC VP Irish, who has a long history of neglecting all of his friends. What an opp. Then there's Lane's best friend Allie, who leaks private info about her (like Lane losing her weapons license) to Raiders MC enemy Shang--the ADMC high command who broke Allie's heart and shot Lane in the head for confronting him about it. Does the Allie character really not see why Lane's friends would be angry with her?\n\nWatched movie: \"The Watchers\" (2024)\n\nA slow folk horror movie written and directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan and produced by her father, M. Night Shyamalan. I don't know how faithfully this film adapted the novel, but I saw a lot of missed opportunities to make the movie more interesting, e.g., exploring the ethics of biodiversity, devoting more screen time to Dakota Fanning's cartography of the forest, and making her sleuth the mystery of the watching creatures and the display case bunker herself rather than just having the answers spoon-fed to her. I did like the part with the video logs. But I also felt like the CGI killed any mystique the watching creatures could have had. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"Lola rennt\" (1998) a.k.a. \"Run Lola Run\" (1999)\n\nI don't want to call director Tom Tykwer a one-hit wonder, but man--everything he made after this tour de force of a movie just struck me as forgettable. Incidentally, I've never seen any other film in history use split-screen better than this one. I also never get tired of re-watching this movie. This time around, I noticed a pivotal moment that must have slipped my mind before: the blind woman changing the outcome of third act. That seems to corroborate my personal theory that the third act is about divine intervention. Rating: 9\n\nWatched movie: \"Omoide no Marnie\" (2014) a.k.a. \"When Marnie Was There\" (2015)\n\nA pretty slow Studio Ghibli movie that finally picked up by the end. I almost wanted to double-check the translation of \"fat pig\" in the dubbed version I watched, because I struggled not to turn on the protagonist after she said that to someone who was just trying to be nice to her. Also, this didn't affect my rating of the film--but I hated how I kept mistaking Anna's hair clip for an anime sweat drop. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Inside Out 2\" (2024) in 3D\n\nI love these ambitious, thought-provoking Pixar movies that try to tackle challenging concepts, e.g., identity crises and defence mechanisms. I enjoyed trying to read into what the film was conveying, from certain emotions forming alliances (like sadness and embarrassment teaming up to make Riley feel shame?) to the consequences of picking and choosing which memories to repress (does that hinder Riley from learning from her mistakes and cause her belief system to become more radicalized?). The scene that resonated most with me: Riley going crazy from anxiety freezing up with a death grip on the console, which to me is what OCD feels like. I also identified with my childhood emotions like joy, sadness, and fear going MIA from my brain when I reached a certain age. Stay after the credits. Rating: 8\n\nWatched movie: \"Bad Boys: Ride or Die\" (2024) in PRIME\n\nSurprisingly good fourth installment that in my opinion, turned the plot weaknesses from the previous movie into strengths for this one. Specifically, they made Captain Howard's death into an emotional arc and made the drug cartel assassin Armando cool without losing his edge. Rating: 6\n\nCompletion bias\n\n4/26/2024\n\nWelp, NBC cancelled the \"Quantum Leap\" revival after two seasons. Disappointing as I was looking forward to the variety of storylines the writers could innovate for two-person leaps. The original series had a couple of episodes with two leapers that that I really liked.\n\nRemind me to never live in L.A. I drove about 15 minutes to the Netflix theater there, and waited in traffic for about an hour and 40 minutes just to get back to my hotel. All to screen a movie that I wasn't really thrilled about: the second installment of Rebel Moon. I forgot to mention a personal cinephile rule that's hard for me to explain, where I feel a compulsion to watch every film in a franchise once I've gotten the momentum. That's why I screened the Omen prequel even though I didn't expect to like it (it actually turned out better than I expected), why I'm going to watch the recently announced Blair Witch revival (even though I tend to hate Blumhouse horror flicks), and why I'm going to subject myself to a third Rebel Moon installment if they ever make one.\n\nI have other habits when I attend movie screenings. I hate it when the ticket taker rips off too much of my ticket stub, so I always try to print my ticket from a kiosk so I can crease and partially tear the perforated line beforehand. I also mentally note the kiosks that print the best-looking tickets. Then I wear earplugs inside of the auditorium to help drown out the loud noise and talking patrons, a practice dating back to that miserable experience I had when the \"Insidious\" title card hurt my ears.\n\nCool first laundromat heist from the Raiders MC on NoPixel where the robber with the loot ran into a crowd of five other identically-disguised accomplices--then shuffled themselves around in a kind of shell game (I always liked it when The Stable teased and built up to big event heists like this rather than just spamming them). I've also enjoyed their antagonistic rivalry with the Mayor of the city, and would consider it a cool storyline if he built enough nerve to push legislation that outlaws MCs. I feel like the Raiders MC have a lot of storyline possibilities if grinding is burning them out, e.g., colluding with the Mayor's many enemies, political lobbying, building up to special event heists or gun trafficking, business RP against the lumber company, exploring tensions with their clown neighbors.\n\nSpeaking of the clowns, they went from chaos characters to creating quite possibly the best RP storyline in NoPixel 4.0 thus far--all from finding the discarded ID of a well-connected person named Ray Mond. Her acceptance into the \"New Clown Order\" led to all these new Shakespearean storylines like a love triangle, enemies dueling each other in \"Clown Risk\", and an exiled clown betraying his own friends to exact revenge on her--culminating in an epic knife fight between them.\n\nWatched movie: \"Late Night with the Devil\" (2024)\n\nAn overrated found footage horror film, IMHO, about a 1970s talk show episode disrupted by a demonically possessed guest. I tend to turn on movies when the narrative becomes unreliable, i.e., I can't trust anymore what's real or not. The less authentic the found footage feels, e.g., too much CGI or rubber reality, the less I like it. Rating: 4\n\nWatched movie: \"Imaginary\" (2024)\n\nI'm getting sick enough of these PG-13 Blumhouse horror movies where I might stop watching them. This one tried in vain to make a teddy bear scary, and felt so tame to me that I'm thinking the filmmakers could have gotten away with a PG rating instead. I didn't even bother trying to comprehend the illogical plot. Rating: 3\n\nWatched movie: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" (2024) in 4DX & 3D\n\nAn extremely contrived albeit decently fun MonsterVerse installment (I found that lanky Skar King and the kid ape particularly entertaining). IMHO, the writers wasted too much time trying to make a hopelessly illogical plot make sense. Also--I don't wanna say that Kong got soft, but seeing scenes such as Kong seeking dental care and saving an enemy ape's life made me feel like I was watching a human being rather than a fearsome ape. Heh, his fight with Godzilla reminded me of that \"They Live\" fight scene where Roddy Piper tried to put the glasses on Keith David. 4DX side note: That voyage to Hollow Earth shook my seat rather violently. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"The Pianist\" (2002)\n\nI finally got to screen this Palme d'Or winner in a theater. Although I wasn't prepared for this biopic about a Holocaust survivor to be so graphically violent, I'd much rather a historical movie be brutally honest than sugarcoated. It makes more sense to me now why both director Roman Polanski and lead actor Adrien Brody pulled upsets over the other Oscar nominees (and even less sense to me now why this film lost the Best Picture Oscar to \"Chicago\"). My one criticism about the movie: that it gave the least praiseworthy of all of the pianist's allies (in my opinion) his own epilogue cards--but didn't reveal the fates of any of those other good people. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Monkey Man\" (2024) in Dolby Cinema\n\nGiven that Dev Patel directed, co-wrote, co-produced, and starred in his own Indian action movie, it was hard for me not to stigmatize it as a vanity project--especially when he lionized himself to look strong, righteous, and attractive to the ladies. It also bugged me that the bad guys didn't just shoot him, and that even the religious figures championed violence and cruelty. I did like some interesting moments here and there, e.g., Dev leaping into the window, always picking the smaller weapon, and punching the villain's punch. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"The First Omen\" (2024) in Dolby Cinema\n\nDisconcerting prequel about how Damien was born and ended up under the care of Gregory Peck (and how that one priest knew so much)--a story which personally I didn't find very interesting. I was more interested in why this movie ended in a cliffhanger given that the original film already has three sequels. If this movie was trying to say that the jackal remains in Damien's mother's grave were actually from his father (?), then do the filmmakers have future movie plans for his mother and twin sister? All in all, I liked the whole look of this film and its cast--but disliked the harebrained character deaths and the villains' lack of logic. Side note: I easily guessed the first twist, but not the second one. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"Civil War\" (2024) in IMAX\n\nI found this Alex Garland film kinda shallow, and was disappointed by the lack of rhetoric in it (it even glossed over why both California and Texas would want to secede from the U.S.!). However, I liked the \"Nightcrawler\" approach to it where the main photojournalists--obsessed with snapping good pictures--seemed completely dissociated from the atrocities they were witnessing. That was probably the scariest part for me: the reflection of how desensitized I myself have become to current events. I also identified with the journalist who gave up on the politispeak, saying the words might as well be random. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Rebel Moon â Part Two: The Scargiver\" (2024)\n\nSame rating as Part One because it was like watching the same movie over again. Though this time it almost felt like Zack Snyder was satirizing himself, e.g., having shots of characters vigorously harvesting grain in operatic slow motion. Also, it's probably easy to guess which parts of the film I found lame. Rating: 5\n\nAs written\n\n3/23/2024\n\nCongratulations to Christopher Nolan on winning the Academy Award for Best Director for \"Oppenheimer\"--IMHO the greatest director of my generation. All of my Oscar predictions were right except for Best Actress, and I couldn't help but to scapegoat Scorsese for not giving Lily Gladstone more screen time in \"Killers of the Flower Moon\".\n\nIn honor of Christopher Nolan's Oscar win, I ranked all of his films again from my favorite to my least favorite:\n\n\"Inception\" (2010) (My rating: 10)\n\n\"Memento\" (2001) (My rating: 9)\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" (2023) (My rating: 9)\n\n\"Insomnia\" (2002) (My rating: 9)\n\n\"Tenet\" (2020) (My rating: 8)\n\n\"Interstellar\" (2014) (My rating: 8)\n\n\"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012) (My rating: 8)\n\n\"Batman Begins\" (2005) (My rating: 8)\n\n\"The Prestige\" (2006) (My rating: 8)\n\n\"Dunkirk\" (2017) (My rating: 7)\n\n\"Following\" (1998) (My rating: 7)\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" (2008) (My rating: 6)\n\nI read rumors that for Nolan's next film, he might adapt that British TV series \"The Prisoner\". I'm curious how Nolan interprets that show, and how surrealist such a movie would be.\n\nOn NoPixel, I just can't wrap my head around the thought process of a prospect who recently got removed from the Raiders MC. First his crush on a club member got out and embarrassed her, which I feel like could happen to anybody. Then he immediately slept with a hangaround, which still didn't faze me because he came clean about it and it only broke a soft rule that half the club had already broken. But once the club passed a definitive rule against it--after the President had explicitly censured him for it and for keeping secrets from High Command--imagine my shock to see him sleeping with the hangaround's alt character and again keeping it secret from High Command. I don't know if he was trying to be cute since the alt character wasn't in the club, but why even push his luck when he was already on such thin ice. And he got removed from the club offstream, so I don't know what else happened that I didn't see.\n\nAnyway, I personally think banning relationships in a gang is a good idea--especially when a member gets together with their gang leader, and the perception of \"special treatment\" comes into play whether true or not. I don't know how their last remaining hangaround Aubrey is going to fare in the current Raiders MC recruitment process though, where all of their club rules--and everyone's personal dealbreakers--are kept secret from her.\n\nWatched movie: \"Dune: Part Two\" (2024) in IMAX 70mm\n\nBravo to Denis Villeneuve for figuring out the secret to adapting the \"Dune\" novel: film big cinematic scenes, splice out the exposition, and just rely on cool shots and screen presence to communicate who the brightest and most perceptive characters are. Rating: 7\n\nWatched movie: \"Kung Fu Panda 4\" (2024) in 3D\n\nFunny DreamWorks Animation movie with a lot of hilarious comedic moments like the Awkwafina fox wiping Po's spittle off her face after his \"not a dream\" and the Bryan Cranston panda spitting out teeth instead of mahjong tiles. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Shin seiki Evangelion GekijÃ´-ban: Air/Magokoro wo, kimi ni\" (1997) a.k.a. \"The End of Evangelion\" (2002)\n\nThe darkest, most hardcore of the three Neon Genesis Evangelion anime endings--and bar none the best of them all, IMHO. I remember I couldn't stop thinking about this movie the first time I had watched it. This was my first time screening it in a theater and I think my first time watching the official subtitled version (I noticed some interesting translations). I particularly loved how brightly some of the beloved characters burned in their final blazes of glory. Although I still think it gets weaker in the second half and wish they had deleted a couple of scenes, I'd still put this masterpiece up there as one the greatest animated films ever created. Rating: 9\n\nWatched movie: \"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire\" (2024) in RPX\n\nForgettable sequel that reunited the main Ghostbusters from the past three films but didn't do much with them. I found the ghosts boring, and wasn't amused by the characters who were being dumb. Stay during the credits. Rating: 4\n\nForecast\n\n2/26/2024\n\nThe wind and rainstorms got so bad in the Bay Area that a gigantic tree fell by my apartment complex, blocking all of the lanes of the road and taking out the power in my apartment. But it's so great not having to drive to work in the rain or worrying about floods around that campus anymore. I can just sleep in. I think I've become too spoiled at this point in my life to ever entertaining working again.\n\nWelp, I added my first entry to my \"worst of 2024\" list: watching the San Francisco 49ers come up short (again) against the Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nI enjoyed the second season of this new \"Quantum Leap\" revival. They reinvented one of my favorite story arcs from the old series, \"Trilogy\", where the time traveller keeps leaping forward into their star-crossed lover's lifetime. I also got really depressed by the end of the story arc though, just like when I watched that Time Traveler's Wife movie. It's cool to me that they made Beth Calavicci a recurring character. I'm also hoping that a future season answers what ever became of Alia and Sam Beckett's daughter.\n\nNow that the Screen Actors Guild Awards and Producers Guild Awards have gone out, I can announce my final Oscar predictions for 2023:\n\nBest picture: \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest director: Christopher Nolan, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest actor: Cillian Murphy, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest actress: Lily Gladstone, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nBest supporting actor: Robert Downey Jr., \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nBest supporting actress: Da'Vine Joy Randolph, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nIn NoPixel, my forecasts came true for the Raiders MC so much quicker than I had anticipated. I knew Mason and Manon weren't ready for the ranks they started with. I knew Maxx was overqualified for her position. I knew Wade would best understand putting the club before personal feelings. Lane actually exceeded my expectations and corrected every problem area I spotted in the club, even the ones that I had identified as potential blind spots (like splurging club money and giving too many second chances). The one anomaly in my predictions was Allie. Although I didn't know her previous character that well, I never expected to share Mason's perception that she was acting like an opp. I'm also dismayed that to this day, the ADMC can't let go of Mason's joke about Irish being weird even after Mason's apology. I see too many NoPixel characters resorting to force because they lack the imagination, charisma, foresight, or humility to resolve conflict any other way. I also can't believe all the unchecked lootboxing I've been seeing from the big Twitch streamers.\n\nI haven't been watching the new Mayor Maximilian Thoroughbred, but I've been reading the legislation being passed--and I feel like his one-child adoption policy is one of the best laws to ever come out of a NoPixel mayoral term. To me, adoption was one of the dumbest viral trends in Los Santos--second only to loan agents getting rich off predatory loans that were inexplicably funded by the government. Looks like the power is getting to his head though.\n\nI've been telling myself to move on to NoPixel 4.0, and to forget all of the things that I can't fix in the NoPixel 3.0 wikis. Most notably, the 3.0 wikis for Nancy's story arcs and companies have an entire year missing from them because they fell into neglect after I agreed to let a spokesperson from that community gatekeep them from me. Even if I still wanted to contribute, I can't now because I don't remember what Nancy did in 2023. I also hate a bullet point in the Angels 3.0 wiki that brags that they see themselves responsible for The Stable disbanding. It's a false claim, but a true statement because I indeed had to listen to three Angels in particular and a toxic honorary member gloat about it ad nauseam. Ironically, the streamer for the honorary member got cancelled and went on to leak two of their private conversations in real-life--now all three streamers are banned from NoPixel, and the Angels appear to be inactive as a result.\n\nWatched movie: \"Argylle\" (2024) in IMAX\n\nA twisty Matthew Vaughn spy film where in my opinion, the spies kept throwing. I found the plot holes so pronounced, e.g., the spies' carefree actions and the stuff with the cat, that I became convinced that the filmmakers included them on purpose to ensure that audiences didn't take the movie seriously. Admittedly, it resulted in some cinematically interesting scenes. Stay during the credits. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Madame Web\" (2024) in IMAX with Laser\n\nAnother second-rate superhero movie in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). I went in with an open mind because I generally like the premise of a character who can see into the future, but this film struck me as slow, boring, and shallow. As a testament to how shallow the movie was, the title character never had to make any hard choices about which future to pick--even when faced with a hard choice about which future to pick! I also groaned internally when I picked up on the breadcrumbs sprinkled throughout the movie, but then got really confused why they didn't lead to any kind of reveal. Did the filmmakers foresee audiences hating on the twist? Rating: 4\n\nOppie\n\n1/24/2024\n\nI finished tabulating the music video results for 2023.\n\nWWE Raw is going to stream exclusively on Netflix beginning in January 2025. Which isn't nearly incentive enough for me to resubscribe to Netflix unless they exclusively stream the Royal Rumble there. Which incidentally, I'll be watching live this Saturday to see if The Rock appears to set up a WrestleMania main event with Roman Reigns. I also saw a tease that 70-year-old Hulk Hogan might enter the Royal Rumble Match, which naturally I'm skeptic about.\n\nMy latest target for resubscribing to Netflix? Before spoiler teasers start coming out for the final season of \"Stranger Things\". Or if Netflix streams a movie I really want to see that isn't playing in theaters.\n\nSpeaking of...I updated my personal cinephile rules:\n\nI have to see a movie in a theater unless it's streaming only. If possible, I always try to see it in the format the director intended (such as 70mm and/or IMAX) unless it's the headache-inducing HFR (High Frame Rate).\n\nI try to watch every Best Picture Oscar nominee before they're officially announced. I also watch every film that won the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film, the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, the Palme d'Or, or the Sundance Film Festival award winner for U.S. Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic.\n\nI generally separate the art from the artist, and will also never walk out of a movie no matter how offensive (admittedly only one movie has ever tempted me).\n\nAs a side note, I save my ticket stubs and type them into the metadata of my movie reviews. I don't really know why, given that I almost never go back and look at them.\n\nIt's cool that I can now watch the Oscar nominations live without messing up my sleep schedule. I couldn't help but notice that a couple of the \"Barbie\" women got snubbed. Here's how I rated the 2023 Best Picture nominees from favorite to least favorite:\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" (My rating: 9)\n\n\"anatomy of a fall\" (My rating: 7)\n\n\"Poor Things\" (My rating: 6)\n\n\"American Fiction\" (My rating: 6)\n\n\"The Zone of Interest\" (My rating: 6)\n\n\"Barbie\" (My rating: 6)\n\n\"The Holdovers\" (My rating: 6)\n\n\"Maestro\" (My rating: 6)\n\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" (My rating: 6)\n\n\"Past Lives\" (My rating: 5)\n\nTo my pleasant surprise in NoPixel 4.0, Lane managed to identify all of the problem spots and bad habits in the Raiders MC and nipped them in the bud. I forget that her previous character Bunny was in the thick of all that internal conflict that broke up The Stable. For instance, the leadership in The Stable never had the courage to punish the problem people (like the serial muggers) due to their friendships within the group. And by the end of The Stable's run, the members were doing and saying whatever they pleased without any care for how their actions hurt the rest of the group. I did notice an overall recurring pattern in NoPixel 3.0 where gangs got bored spamming heists and became inactive, so I think the Raiders MC will benefit from having an experienced RP storyteller as their leader rather than leaders who rely on crime mechanics to give their group something to do.\n\nI'm also glad Lane decided that relationships with other groups like the Lost MC and former BBMC are important--even if they're inevitably doomed to fail at some point. In hindsight, The Stable's best storylines came from interacting with other groups, i.e., Mick hacking for the BBMC in exchange for borrowing Barry's practice laptop, The Stable Heads ruining the first coke run of Nancy's Cerberus boss Lang, The Stable receiving vital intel from the BBMC about the big meth run after they had dropped out of their partnership on it, The Stable's final climactic meth run with Hardcastle and the Street Crimes Unit closing in on their warehouse, and The Stable rescuing Mick from The Highwayman.\n\nI'm closely watching whether any NoPixel 3.0 history repeats itself for NoPixel 4.0. In particular, the streamers who played Bunny and Nancy appear to be taking their new characters in a whole new direction. I'm already seeing other 4.0 characters fall into the same old habits of the streamers who play them.\n\nWatched movie: \"Night Swim\" (2024) in Dolby Cinema\n\nWas this PG-13 horror movie about a family's haunted swimming pool doomed to fail? I say yes. Rating: 3\n\nThe end of NoPixel 3.0\n\n12/19/2023\n\nSometimes I look up words that I see or hear on the Internet, such as \"glazing\" (for when someone is sucking up to someone) or \"virtue signalling\" (for when someone publicly states a moral opinion to make themselves look like a good person). Recently I researched what \"pick-me\" means, and read that it's a girl who is willing to do anything for male approval (or other external validation). Given its derogatory nature, I can't foresee myself ever using the word.\n\nBut let's just say I looked it up during a recent NoPixel storyline where Bunny snubbed all of her closest friends--and almost died of a \"broken heart\"--because she tried to get a womanizer named Edgar to literally pick her. Which admittedly, resulted in what I considered the best finale storyline in all of NoPixel 3.0 (even though two of the main streamers involved didn't stream it for some reason)--and gave both her husband Hardcastle and best friend Nancy some of their best RP in a long time (I actually found it fitting that the Nancy character ended NoPixel 3.0 losing Bunny as a friend). However, I'm hoping to never have to watch this type of cringe marriage arc again where one spouse wants polyamory while the other wants monogamy--especially when one of the streamers kept giggling at RP that wasn't a laughing matter. I'm excited for this new Raiders MC storyline in NoPixel 4.0 where Itsjustasummerjob plays a gang leader instead of a pacifist civilian, and Kate gets to play with friends again without worrying about the optics on Nancy.\n\nIn other NoPixel news: after Mayor Maximillian Angel spent his whole term atop a high horse about how Mayors should minimize government spending (for an economy already inflated and about to be reset), how unethical the hospital was for having G-Wagons and big bonuses, how music artists were making too much in royalties, and how he should respect DoJ Chief Justice Crane's authority, the Department of Justice ended up impeaching Max anyway (for helping to cultivate marijuana for an art project). I'm glad that that the Twitch streamer who plays Max was such a good sport about it. I've never seen a Mayor of Los Santos so opposed to playing the political game.\n\nI'm curious how long the Angels can survive without their leader Claire, whom I saw as the glue that kept that gang alive. On the plus side, it'll probably help the individual members to become less cliquey. I feel like it's no coincidence that the approachable streamers from the former Stable have prio while the three biggest detractors of the group ended up permanently banned.\n\nWatched movie: \"The Marvels\" (2023) in 3D\n\nA lively \"Captain Marvel\" sequel wherein anytime two of the three Marvels superheroes use their light-based powers simultaneously, they swap places with each other. I mainly liked how the Carol Danvers character tormented herself with unsolvable galactic problems, even gaining widespread notoriety like Ender Wiggin. I didn't care so much for the more farcical parts, e.g., the comic relief family, the singing kingdom, and the herding of cats. Definitely stay during the credits. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes\" (2023) in IMAX with Laser\n\nA stirring prequel about the 10th Hunger Games wherein young mentor Coriolanus Snow catches feelings for his folk songstress tribute from District 12. Macabre as The Hunger Games are, I always consider them the most entertaining part of each installment. It also interested me watching for the red flags in Snow, and judging the exact moment when he became an irredeemable villain (I actually ended up condoning a lot of his choices). I found Viola Davis' head gamemaker character interesting too. Although I nearly lowered my rating because I found the conclusion weird and anticlimactic, I kept my mind open to the possibility that Suzanne Collins has more story to tell. Rating: 7\n\nWatched movie: \"Wish\" (2023) in 3D\n\nDecent musical from Walt Disney Animation Studios about an aspiring apprentice's ideological disagreement with her king, a sorcerer who decides which wishes in his kingdom to grant. I found the wishes rather unimaginative, so I could only assume that the people limited themselves to wishes that the king's powers could actually accomplish. But even then, I saw people wasting their wishes on personal dreams that they could conceivably accomplish themselves if they worked hard enough at it. The best part of the movie for me: the rousing musical number where the protagonists rallied themselves into committing treason against the king. Stay after the credits. Rating: 7\n\nWatched movie: \"Maestro\" (2023)\n\nA slow biopic of composer Leonard Bernstein and his wife Felicia Montealegre, directed by Bradley Cooper. I got pretty bored of all of the polite conversation, and welcomed the handful of scenes where they finally laid bare their true feelings (or in one instance, outed their truth with the longest pregnant pause of all time). Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Thanksgiving\" (2023)\n\nI'd easily consider this Eli Roth slasher film the best feature-length movie to come out of those phony trailers from \"Grindhouse\". I particularly liked the opening Black Friday riot and that the serial killer had principles. Side note: I actually guessed the killer correctly. Stay after the credits. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Next Goal Wins\" (2023)\n\nOccasionally amusing, occasionally bad Taika Waititi film about the American Samoa national soccer team and their Dutch-American coach (Michael Fassbender), when they tried to qualify for the FIFA World Cup despite being at the bottom of the rankings. Maybe it was just me, but I felt like the storyline about the first transgender player ever to compete in a World Cup game was handled insensitively. Stay after the credits. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"Gojira -1.0\" a.k.a. \"Godzilla Minus One\" (2023) in 4DX\n\nProbably the only kaiju movie I've ever seen where the human drama was actually good. It was also interesting to see how post-WW II Japan could stand any kind of chance against Godzilla and its atomic heat ray with such pitiful armaments at their disposal. I noticed that I like the giant monsters such as Godzilla and King Kong better when they don't care about human life, e.g., indiscriminately stepping on or swatting humans. 4DX side note: I felt like a bull rider hanging onto the motion seat, and worried I might get seasick if the ocean scenes continued. Rating: 8\n\nWatched movie: \"Silent Night\" (2023)\n\nVexing John Woo film wherein the absence of dialogue probably helped the movie given all of the dumb things I witnessed in it, e.g., the mute protagonist inexplicably rushing into flying bullets without cover, enemies just running in front of his gun (and somehow missing every shot at him) like mindless video game NPCs that have no regard for their own lives, and the glorification of violence to solve problems with even the police detective getting in on it. Rating: 4\n\nWatched movie: \"Kimitachi wa dÃ´ ikiru ka\" a.k.a. \"The Boy and the Heron\" (2023) in RPX\n\nA slow and confusing Hayao Miyazaki film. Other than the talking gray heron, I found all of the characters boring. Good animation though. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Dream Scenario\" (2023)\n\nBiting social commentary on cancel culture wherein a professor played by Nicolas Cage inexplicably appears in people's dreams; then gets persecuted when the dreams turn into nightmares. The movie started out amusing, but then got pretty awkward and dark IMHO. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Poor Things\" (2023)\n\nCerebral, perverse, and totally bonkers--everything I've come to expect from a Yorgos Lanthimos film. I found the melodramatic Mark Ruffalo character hilarious. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Eileen\" (2023)\n\nA psychological thriller (co-starring Thomasin McKenzie and Anne Hathaway) with nary anything thrilling in it. I found the pulse-pounding trailer much better than the actual movie. Rating: 5\n\nLame duck\n\n11/10/2023\n\nMy favorite thing about retirement might be sleeping in every day, especially through the cold mornings.\n\nI received my fifth Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot on November 1, leading to a night of body chills, aches, and fever dreams.\n\nThe actors' strike finally ended after about four months, so I'm wondering whether we'll have a four-month movie drought next year? I thought the film releases would be more spread out this year as a result, but I still see a lot of new movies incoming.\n\nWas cool watching Twitch streamer Boogie reminisce about the screencaps I accumulated on Xavier's wiki. Xavier's life in NoPixel 3.0 has been like a movie.\n\nNot much going on in NoPixel 3.0. I have many thoughts about the new gentlemanly Mayor of Los Santos, Maximillian Angel. I like his conflict resolution skills and his \"MitchCon 2023\" event in the Cerberus Arena. But what's the point of assuming a leadership position if he's not going to fight for his constituents, just fixates on what he shouldn't do, and just defers everything to Chief Justice Crane. The people of Los Santos elected HIM to govern and decide the budget, not Crane or the DoJ. I also have trouble listening to Max judge other people's ethics when he's in league with Lang and still works for and reports to the Cerberus megacorporation--visibly sharing their partiality against Nexus Pharmaceuticals, Simone Memorial Hospital, and the Cohens. In fact, that's what originally turned me against both the Lang and Eve characters--the hypocrisy of them smearing the reputations of people who aren't anywhere near as bad as them. The latest example: Eve smearing Trooper Suarez to Max but omitting how she and her photographer tried to rip him off. Also--regarding the previous five Mayors whom I chronicled the administrations of, Mickey is the only one whom I thought should have been impeached. He actually embezzled millions of State dollars, and burned out the Deputy Mayors who couldn't even get him to pay out budgets.\n\nI'd find it interesting if Mayor Max ever investigated Board of Director Bunny, who ironically has probably been more falsely accused of embezzlement than anyone else in the city. I actually racked my brain about what would go on her character wiki's \"Crimes\" tab: accomplice to drug trafficking as The Stable's warehouse owner, accessory after the fact for lying to the police about a murdered assistant district attoney, and theft of box trucks for her bee business. That's all I can think of. On a side note, I found it noteworthy that her streamer planned to make the character less anti-violent in 4.0 to open up more RP. But to me, Bunny's moral code in such a corrupt city is what made this character so unique and interesting. I also liked how she never broke character and always valued human life, as opposed to the players who would just clown around and shoot each other down. I also feel like the city has too many bullies and cringeworthy people who \"g check\". In particular, I instantly lose respect for the NoPixel characters who target and bully innocent people, e.g., hunting the innocent loved ones of enemies (which notably, some Cerberus executives have been guilty of).\n\nWatched movie: \"anatomie d'une chute\" a.k.a. \"anatomy of a fall\" (2023)\n\nIntriguing albeit long Palme d'Or winner wherein a visually impaired boy's mother faces prosecution for the murder of his father. Too much focus on motive, if you ask me, when in my mind the entire case hinged upon whether the forensic evidence could prove that the fall was murder rather than an accident or suicide. Special props to the acting by Sandra HÃ¼ller. Rating: 7\n\nWatched movie: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" (2023) in IMAX with Laser\n\nA nearly three-and-a-half hour Scorsese film that in my opinion, gave too much screen time to undeserving lowlife characters and not enough screen time to the most interesting ones, e.g., the Osage wife (in denial?) played by Lily Gladstone. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"The Killer\" (2023)\n\nCool David Fincher film from Netflix that focused on an assassin's anticipatory precautions against potential mistakes--in a line of work full of variables, distractions, and occupational hazards. He reminded me of myself when I drive defensively, scanning the road for potential dangers. I also liked his vigilance against bending any of his rules, despite the temptations to. Rating: 7\n\nWatched movie: \"The Holdovers\" (2023)\n\nTypical dry-humored Alexander Payne film wherein a curmudgeonly boarding school teacher (Paul Giamatti) and a lunch lady supervise an insolent student over Christmas break. Rating: 6\n\nThe pinnacle of NoPixel\n\n9/15/2023\n\nTo my alarm, the hotel I frequent in Santa Maria wound up charging me an extra three nights after I had dropped off my key card--claiming that I had asked the night receptionist to extend my stay from two nights to five nights. The first receptionist I called said she couldn't do anything about it, but fortunately the second receptionist knew me well enough to give me a refund. It made me speculate whether a scammer had impersonated me to get a free hotel stay, or alternatively--whether the front desk talked to someone who looked like me and mistakenly extended my stay instead of theirs.\n\nI've still been procrastinating on my resubscription to Netflix. I reasoned that next year might be the best time if the Hollywood strikes prevent new movies from coming out.\n\nMad respect to all of the NoPixel role players and devs involved in the whole Sanguine Isle invasion, especially the enemies of the State willing to serve 30 real-life prison days for treason. They all made their mark in a historic server event akin to the Alamo that will easily be remembered more than any assets and/or properties they hoarded. The whole war and fallout from it inspired a renaissance of storylines for the Department of Justice, the medics, the \"enemies of the State\", the war correspondent, and the current Mayor of Los Santos. In particular, my favorite story arc started near the end of the war when the Senator Davis and Director Knight--under the pretense of humanitarian aid--sent a combat medic into a bunker with C4 in a failed attempt to blow up the last of the enemy holdouts. Consequently--despite impressive leadership in taking down the city's most wanted terrorist--the Senator, Director, and Commissioner were all treated as war criminals when they returned home rather than war heroes.\n\nInterestingly, the combat medic claimed she was under duress because the Director had threatened one of the dissenting soldiers with a gun--but on the VOD, she clearly agreed to plant the bomb and even told the Senator, \"Yup, I'm willing to do it,\" before the dissenting soldier even confronted them. So it might be a case of the character deciding she had moral convictions only after seeing people's outrage over it. However, the Senator never mentioned it was a one-way suicide mission through a locked gate--so it's misleading for him to imply that she understood the risks when she volunteered. A very fascinating storyline that unfortunately, will probably peter out anticlimactically because the Senator claimed political immunity and disappeared (I'm really not a fan of RP'ers using their clout on the server to play \"untouchable\" characters). I also don't like how chummy the Chief Justice is with the Senator and certain Mayors--it gives such an appearance of partiality when he wants the DoJ to investigate the Mayors he doesn't like.\n\nI had a lot of different thoughts about BBMC Prime Minister Barry's dismay that Nancy, a friend of his gang for over two years, seemed indifferent to the notion of Cerberus buying his used car dealership. My first thought was how little Barry knew about her, given that a BBMC prospect understood more about her relationship to her boss Lang, i.e., the plane ride loyalty test, from one conversation better than Barry ever has in his entire time of knowing her. Another thought I had was if this is how badly that the BBMC leadership understands people's perspectives, it's no wonder they have such a revolving door of members and alliances. Finally, I thought about how both Nancy and Bunny compartmentalize their business and personal feelings, e.g., not being afraid to snub or fire friends from their companies and their open-mindedness to working with enemies if their businesses call for it. I've seen Nancy fire one of her dearest friends for displeasing Cerberus, so it makes sense to me that she wouldn't help a friend's business if she felt that they deserved to lose it for committing treason (granted, she could have given Barry a heads up first) and becoming radicalized. I'm actually more confused why Nancy ever helped the BBMC in the first place, given how easily they turned on Wolfe, The Stable, and other loyal BBMC members during the time that she's known them.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm curious to see how the BBMC would react to Lang's mind games given his similarities to Dundee (Lang's reckless actions hurt Nancy and Eve much like Dundee's reckless actions used to hurt the BBMC). Currently, Lang doesn't even know the BBMC and thinks their leader is named \"Collins\". And just like Dundee, the more information Lang finds out, the more ideas he's likely to brainstorm to weaponize it against them.\n\nWatched movie: \"The Equalizer 3\" (2023) in IMAX with Laser\n\nReminded me of one of those bloody samurai films where the rÅnin protects the simple peasants from villanous gangs. I liked the first part of the movie where Robert McCall's cold-blooded massacre went awry and the Italian townspeople helped him heal mentally and physically. But from there, I felt like the film just devolved into mind-numbing violence and cruelty. It also felt like a plot hole how little the police did in the entire movie. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"The Nun II\" (2023) in IMAX\n\nI feel like the Valak demon has gotten stale--this is the third Conjuring installment to focus on it. It also got repetitive watching the same horror trope over and over again, i.e., where a character wanders off to investigate a strange noise. Admittedly, the magazine stand scene impressed me. Stay during the credits. Rating: 4\n\nEvery day is a vacation day now\n\n8/27/2023\n\nI think going forward, I'm going to stop volunteering the news that I retired. I found I've had no meaningful answers to the people asking what I do nowadays--considering that I mostly just spend my time watching movies and Twitch (and writing wiki articles). Admittedly, it's cool that I can just drive anywhere I want without taking any vacation days. I also find that I now prefer weekdays over weekends and holidays because of the crowds.\n\nIn NoPixel news, Mayor Hardcastle successfully finished his term without getting impeached and by Chief Justice Crane's own admission, Hardcastle never actually broke any Los Santos laws in office. With the exception of Crane's inaccurate take that Hardcastle just paid State money to his friends as a way to taunt the DoJ for losing his PD job, Crane did piece a lot together--including Hardcastle's big but legal bonuses to himself and past Mayors (Crane didn't even fully grasp how rich Hardcastle made his wife's hospital and his Deputy Mayor's Cerberus businesses). But the way I saw it, it wasn't much different from real-life elected officials aiding the causes of the supporters and campaign donors who put them into office. I'm still confused why Crane thinks he has any kind of say over how a Mayor balances the city's budget--and why Crane even cares given how the NoPixel co-owner himself also spent State money generously while playing Mayor Lang. Not only did the streamer who plays the top Senator condone it, he himself has been trying to scam 10 million dollars in funeral services from the new Mayor Andi Jones. Heck, Andi gladly accepted 24 million dollars from Mayor Hardcastle and as Mayor herself, bought the police a Caracara 4x4 from her own brother's business. I'm basically just disappointed that Andi cared enough about Crane's personal opinion to have weekly budget reviews with him--especially given that she only won by 10 votes and now has bleaker re-election chances going down this path. Granted, it does make sense going forward that they permanently nerf State spending in case some madman wins and just empties out the State account.\n\nUntil this point, I had found Andi's mayorship promising, i.e., hiring top Deputy Mayors from the previous two administrations, conceiving the Municipal Worker, and reviving Parks & Rec. I mostly just disagreed with her attempts to micromanage the police and her perception that she could spot the bad state grant applicants, given that three of the most egregious ones were contestants at her own Shark Tank event.\n\nWatched movie: \"Meg 2: The Trench\" (2023) in 3D\n\nWhy did I watch this movie. Rating: 4\n\nWatched movie: \"Talk to Me\" (2023)\n\nMessed up horror flick where teenage partygoers trifle with an embalmed (?) hand to temporarily invite rotting ghosts into their bodies. Which I found painfully irresponsible and gross to watch. So if this movie was a social commentary on the stupidity of teenagers and drug use, the filmmakers succeeded. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"Blue Beetle\" (2023) in RPX\n\nAnother asinine DC superhero movie with cringeworthy attempts at drama and humor. Stay during and after the credits. Rating: 4\n\nWatched movie: \"Past Lives\" (2023)\n\nAn awkward albeit affecting Oscar contender about a married New York writer's reunion with her childhood sweetheart from Korea. That American husband was a good sport about it. Rating: 5\n\nBarbenheimer\n\n8/6/2023\n\nIt was cool to see the theaters so packed for the \"Barbenheimer\" movie event, with a lot of the \"Barbie\" patrons sporting pink clothes. I read that the viral social media meme \"Barbenheimer\", which inspired patrons to see these both of these contrasting films over the weekend, was so successful that movies studios might turn this into a new marketing strategy going forward. I even heard recommendations of screening both of movies as a double feature--but that would have been too long for me to sit through.\n\nWelp, the USWNT ended their skid of three straight World Cup ties with a penalty kick shootout elimination in the round of 16, after being just one penalty shot away from defeating Sweden. I had the misfortune of watching the debacle live. It reminded me of that one Wimbledon final where Roger Federer just needed one ace at double match point to win his ninth title and blew it. Though that one wrenched my gut more because it was a final. The way this USWNT was looking, I would've been surprised if they even made it through their bracket.\n\nI've been watching less and less NoPixel characters, with Xavier being the only criminal left that I still watch regularly. I mostly just like the crimes he takes seriously, from his crowning Death Race achievement to two of the most police-heavy meth runs I've ever seen him drive getaway for. When the Angels spam and troll heists to the point where Xavier is just eavesdropping on Alex in a cafe during a big meth run, it makes me miss Xavier's solo days as a professional S+ hacker or his Stable days where the crew role-played stakes and actually feared getting caught by the police.\n\nGiven how tired I've gotten of SBS (where characters just clown around) and NVL (where characters don't seem to care about life and death), I've mostly just been watching serious role players like Cerberus and the Mayor's Office. I still don't get what Gulag Gang and The Mandem think they'll gain from gangbanging against a character as poisonous and demagogical as Lang, who only gets pettier from being attacked. Pogs and temporary street cred? Not to mention--what would stop him as the server co-owner or the NoPixel staff from nerfing or deprioritizing gangs in the server who shoot too much instead of role-playing? Personally, I still think it's a conflict of interest for NoPixel devs, admins, and owners to role-play characters in the city (which is why I like the idea of removing characters' admin menus). Case in point: a Senator on the server making decisions that benefit his own alt character, e.g., the San Andreas Gaming Commission.\n\nBut back to the current Cerberus storyline, I feel like the violent attacks have only succeeded in unifying them and giving them content (like I think Lang's boredom was more of a threat to Cerberus than anything else). I would argue that GG did much more damage to Lang by befriending Speedy and Yeager. The Simones also managed to divide Cerberus with Nick's texts to Eve and Nancy's protection of Bunny (causing Lang to fold to Nancy and alienate both Harry and Yeager--it's also the only time I ever remember Nancy considering leaving Cerberus). So if you ask me, the best stratagem for playing the game of NoPixel is winning as many hearts and minds as possible. Because if you win enough hearts and minds, you can--hypothetically--run away with a mayoral election and legally bankroll your wife's hospital, your friend's arena, all or your allies' businesses, and/or all of your enemies' enemies.\n\nIn other news, it looks like Mayor Hardcastle might be burnt out on politics because of all the haters, hypocrites, and self-important budget hawks that suddenly came out of the grass during his term. Which is a shame, considering how much I was looking forward to what he had originally planned. I think the funniest thing to me about his whole mayorship was Cerberus' perception that Andi Jones would be the more favorable Mayor to them. I'm certain that even if Hardcastle still had beef with Brian, Hardcastle still would have rubber-stamped any appointee that AEGIS wanted on their board. I'm also convinced that Cerberus could have gotten what they wanted (including the medical licenses) had they simply asked Hardcastle, Bunny, or Nancy nicely. I look forward to seeing what happens if Andi wins the upcoming mayoral election, and whether she just keeps Cerberus at arm's length. With Brian's history of incomplete projects, it might even be better for AEGIS for the Mayor--who has the mandate of the voters--to appoint a non-Cerberus loyalist whom the public and DoJ trusts. Otherwise, AEGIS could just go down in history as another FIB whose authority was never recognized.\n\nOn the surface, it looked really bad for Mayor Hardcastle that the two highest officials in the DoJ, Senator Sean Davis and Chief Judge Alan Crane, asked Brian to investigate Hardcastle for possible articles of impeachment. But to me, that meant Hardcastle buying the two G-Wagons for the hospital and paying his wife Bunny state money to decorate the cop bar wasn't egregious enough to attempt impeachment right away. The way I see it, a police investigation into these two \"red flags\" would have only found exculpatory evidence. Admittedly, I clearly remember cringing back when I first saw Hardcastle buy the second G-Wagon for the hospital (after he put the first one in Bunny's name) and award a second state grant to his own cop bar (for Bunny to get paid for the interior decorating). Personally to avoid any red flags, I would have had the hospital budget for the two G-Wagons themselves and had Pond pay Bunny through Olympus Interiors. But I don't blame him for getting careless, given all of the State money that the past two Mayors embezzled with complete impunity. It seems completely whimsical what the DoJ decides to look at--I still remember when they investigated Mayor Bunny's 1.35 million dollars to TheraPD (which I assume led to a dead-end because the police Commissioner himself transferred the money), but completely overlooked Bunny's state grant to her own record label.\n\nI also wonder whether both Crane and Senior Judge Nathaniel Greyson would have had to recuse themselves because of how they both investigated the Mayor's business grants. My one major concern was Senator Davis, who clearly showed bias toward Hardcastle's guilt and made a lot of prejudicial statements about him with Crane. I figure Hardcastle covered his bases transferring the cop bar storefront to Pond and reclaiming his armored mayoral car back from the police (I also noticed that Bunny transferred the two G-Wagons out of her name). I didn't watch how he handled the \"Shark Tank\" spending though, because it would have looked bad if his or Bunny's investments were funded by the State (I do remember him saying that all of the Shark Tank contestants he funded applied through the state grants though). All in all, this is why I find NoPixel so interesting to watch--what other video game puts a player in this unique scenario where they have to govern a city under the specter of impeachment.\n\nWatched movie: \"Barbie\" (2023) in Dolby Cinema\n\nI actually liked the escapist dance numbers the best. Although I found the biting social commentary about men and women thought-provoking (particularly the portrayal of Ken's torment), I also got really depressed from it. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Oppenheimer\" (2023) in IMAX 70mm\n\nAlthough I wasn't impressed with how Christopher Nolan directed this talkfest of a movie (to me, the nuclear explosion was the only scene worth seeing in IMAX 70mm), I was highly impressed with how well he wrote the screenplay. The profound matters of life and death debated in this film--from the rationalizations of weaponizing physics to the final line of dialogue--blew my mind. I also liked the whole dichotomy between importance vs. self-importance. Granted, some parts of the movie felt pretentious to me, but I appreciated that the film never struck me as preachy. Rating: 9\n\nEvery day is a holiday now\n\n7/15/2023\n\nUh-oh. I'm already seeing studios halting production due to the actors' strike. Combined with the writers' strike, who knows how this will affect movie release dates.\n\nI'm still trying to get used to retirement life. I still can't shake the dread that I have a deadline due, even though I no longer have to worry about deadlines or any kind of work obligations. I still don't miss anything about IBM, other than the free air-conditioning during this heat wave.\n\nIn NoPixel news, the Mayor Hardcastle administration's RP has been popping off so much that I've been struggling to keep the wikis up-to-date. For instance, I spent hours authoring a \"Shark Tank\" event wiki. The Cohens may have unintentionally become two of the most powerful people in the city--and Nancy's managed to maintain her same relationship with Cerberus by feeding them some \"glitter\" a la \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\". It's also been interesting watching Hardcastle's mayorship get secretly investigated by his opps, given his extensive background in police investigations and his wife Bunny's extensive history of thwarting every investigation and audit ever thrown at her.\n\nI've enjoyed chronicling the Mayors on NoPixel, and love how the politics in the city have pitted about half of them against the other half. I first started watching from Mayor Sabith \"Bunny\" Cohen, whose state grant program revolutionized how the Mayor's Office incentivizes small businesses; and whose Parks & Rec revival sparked a renaissance of events in the city. Then Mayor Mickey revolutionized the legislative power of the Mayor's Office, and incentivized music artistry in the city with his royalties act. For Mayor Lang, I considered the prohibition of state-funded loans his signature achivement (followed by his increase of EMS and doctor wages). I think AEGIS could have gained legitimacy had he staffed it with the most qualified experts in the city rather than Cerberus loyalists who just want to weaponize it against their enemies (and refuse to show transparency). Looking back, I feel like the past Mayors fell off in their second terms--so I agree with Hardcastle's decision to end after one term. I'm still waiting to see how much Cerberus pieces together, as it's become clear to me that they don't understand how Bunny and Hardcastle operate nearly as well as Nancy does. Like I've been watching Bunny for nearly two years, and still get caught off guard by what she's capable of.\n\nNot gonna lie, Cerberus RP has been numbing my brain lately. Like I can't believe how toxic Eve's stream has become, unless the character has always been like that and I just never realized. And if Cerberus ever took Nancy on another plane ride, I wouldn't blame her if she chose to jump out of it. Instead of role-playing with the people that they need to resolve their conflicts with, i.e., the Simone Memorial Hospital, the Mayor's Office, and The Guild, Cerberus would rather just isolate themselves from the rest of the RP community, share uninformed toxic opinions, think of adding more responsibility to a woefully underqualified AEGIS (like that would solve anything), and resort to blowing up the city's hospital to make up for their shortcomings in dealmaking. The Lang character, in particular, hangs out with the same clique of guys every day and willingly exposes other people's secrets (like benches and plans)--and instead of innovating anything constructive for the city, has just been innovativing new ways to alienate Nancy, Eve, and The Guild. I think my main irritation is the fans who still think that Lang, the biggest terrorist in the city, has any kind of moral authority to judge Cerberus' enemies (which have grown considerably).\n\nIn other NoPixel news, I'm impressed that they've started permanently banning streamers that were complicit in Randy's reign of terror. I wonder how many other streamers are sweating now.\n\nWatched movie: \"Asteroid City\" (2023)\n\nPossibly the flattest, most convoluted Wes Anderson film I've ever seen. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" (2023) in IMAX with Laser\n\nBoring Indiana Jones installment wherein I just wanted to fast-forward to what Archimedes' Dial actually did. Rating: 4\n\nWatched movie: \"Insidious: The Red Door\" (2023)\n\nDisappointingly boring considering how long I waited for a sequel to continue the second film. I did think the ending redeemed the movie. Stay after the credits. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" (2023) in IMAX with Laser\n\nWas it my imagination, or did this IMF movie feel more like a Tom Cruise vanity project than the previous installments? Like what was with all the W rizz and the gratuitous running. Overall, I found the film decently entertaining except for some problems I had with the plot, e.g., the lazy \"fridging\" trope and contrived scenes such as the intelligence briefing where the officials flawlessly finished each others' sentences. Rating: 5\n\nLife after IBM\n\n6/23/2023\n\nSuch a surreal feeling to walk away from the IBM Silicon Valley Lab, where I worked at for the past 24 years, knowing that I'm never going to see it again. And then to be sitting here inside of my apartment, with nothing to work on and no office to drive to. It's definitely going to take some getting used to.\n\nI found it interesting that every IBM co-worker I told about my retirement congratulated me, except for one guy who just replied, \"I see\".\n\nI'm keeping myself busy with web surfing and Twitch watching. I'm convinced that a lot of comments on the Internet are from kids. No way that grown-ups could've written some of the dumb things I've read. So many myopic comments from NoPixel fans, in particular, who can't imagine how big of a universe exists outside of their streamer's purview. For instance, fans of Cerberus and Chang Gang might be shocked by how little the rest of the city thinks about them. Furthermore, a lot of NoPixel comments sound like they were written by people who still believe that pro-wrestling is real. Like I saw R.U.S.T. comments advocating war against Lang, one of the city's pettiest and most protected characters played by a streamer who basically runs NoPixel now. And by \"protected\", I mean the pro-wresting definition wherein he only \"buries\" his rivals rather than \"putting them over\". I've also noticed how easily this character discarded many of his closest alliances like Bane, Yeager, Bucky, Cassie, and Ray. Which is why I'm relieved that Mayor Hardcastle never got a meeting with Lang, because I see no upside to interacting with him. It took just three wrong words from ex-Cerberus CEO Cassie for Lang to give up on her and forget everything she ever did for the company. This goes to why Cerberus reminds me of \"The Devil Wears Prada\"--it's completely worth working there to build a distinguished career, but shouldn't be mistaken for a \"family\" where people can be trusted to have each other's backs and remain friends once they leave the company.\n\nEx-police detective Hardcastle's mayoral campaign--and the suspenseful announcement of the results--might easily be my favorite NoPixel storyline of the year. It incorporated all of his past lore, from placing trust in the two Stable members he once investigated (Bunny and Nancy) to his PD career ending over the dongle to getting campaign backing from the Yokai leader he investigated. To be honest, I was completely proven wrong about Hardcastle's longevity with polyamorous Bunny and his early election chances (back when he first started floating the run). But once I saw who he started canvassing, I immediately began to chronicle his mayoral campaign in the wiki fully expecting him to win. Granted, I began second-guessing whether he'd get enough PD turnout and non-hedging votes, but when I peeked on the other campaigns I just couldn't see the math working out for them. It's BS to me that Bunny felt like she had to recuse herself from her own husband's administration (and mad at the characters and toxic chatters who precipitated that decision), especially given that people like Lang still perceive her as the \"shadow Mayor\" whether she's a Deputy Mayor or not. But then I realized what a smart play it was, given that Deputy Mayor Nancy would now have plausible deniability if ever asked by Lang to spy on her and Hardcastle. I noticed that people still can't wrap their heads around why a populist character like Bunny--who wants transparency, her voice to be heard, her text messages to be responded to, and the freedom to have any friends she wants--never really fit into a patriarchy like Cerberus where the employees have to be careful about their every word and keep losing their allies and friends because of Lang.\n\nIt's crazy to me how ByThyBeard went from potentially shelving Hardcastle to skyrocketing him into quite possibly the best role play of his life as the Mayor of Los Santos. He basically has an entire blank canvas of possibility and virtually unlimited money to throw at anything or anyone he wants, from an armored mayoral car with front-mounted machine guns on it to granting whatever hospital budget that Bunny desires. I'm still confused why Hardcastle considered it a foregone conclusion that Andi would beat him in the next mayoral election, when his winning vote total surpassed both of her winning vote totals. Admittedly, serving as a Deputy Mayor (possibly with Bunny?) in a mayoral administration with Andi's clout does sound like a unique opportunity to do a lot more good for the city.\n\nI see that the walking red flag that Lizzie hung out with finally got exposed--I never understood people's praise of his \"role play\". I won't be surprised to see a few more permanent bans, but I think the most rotten apples are gone now.\n\nWatched movie: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" (2023) in RPX\n\nGod tier animation from Sony Pictures Animation; easily some of the best animation I've ever seen. In particular, the opening scenes with Spider-Gwen evoked such potent emotion. I also thought highly of the multiverse premise that all Spideys are predestined to suffer heartbreaking bereavement. Rating: 9\n\nWatched movie: \"Elemental\" (2023) in 3D\n\nA vibrant Pixar outing highlighted by the fire woman's vivid emoting. Granted, I almost lowered my rating because her watery love interest annoyed me so much. I also found the movie's exploration of societal issues like prejudice, interracial dating, segregation, and housing discrimination somewhat shallow--but it was a kids movie, so I don't blame them for \"watering down\" the adult themes. Side note: that fire woman's father kept reminding me of my own dad. Rating: 7\n\nWatched movie: \"The Flash\" (2023) in RPX\n\nBruce Wayne's spaghetti analogy summed up this movie pretty well. What a hot asinine mess. Stay after the credits. Rating: 4\n\n\"One last ride\"\n\n5/29/2023\n\nI formally resigned from IBM. My last day is June 22, 2023. Although I wasn't a fan of how bad the micromanagement had gotten by the end of my career, I am appreciative of my 24 years with the company and have no hard feelings (even though the neurotic in me wishes it was 25 years). Who knows, maybe I'll return some day. I'll see how bored I get in the next few months to decide whether I ever want to work again.\n\nMy new full-time hobby is wiki authoring. I enjoy writing for them, and was pleased to see a tweet of appreciation from another NoPixel streamer whom I maintained a wiki page for.\n\nI think out of all of the slang words I've heard on NoPixel recently, \"opps\" might be my favorite. I've heard it used for enemies but more interestingly, for \"friends\" who aren't really friends and have hidden agendas. I still get surprised from time to time when I see a NoPixel character acting like someone's best friend forever, then wandering in their stream and realizing they're actually an opp.\n\nI'm impressed by \"Hardcastle\" Sexton Cohen's mayoral campaign so far, and haven't seen any other candidates to fear yet. As a former police lieutenant, he's able to canvass voting blocs that other mayoral candidates would have trouble with, like the PD departments and the DOJ. Add in his wife Bunny's supporters, and I think he has a real shot. Granted, it was hard to tell who his opps were among the voters he met with. Like I never would have guessed some of the people who betrayed Bunny, from the nicest-seeming people joining a hunting party against her to the backstabber she was trying to convince to run against Mickey. I'm mostly just dreading the possibility of Lang's involvement (and his penchant for making uninformed decisions). Because on a whim, he could make Hardcastle into a storyline and/or flip Nancy against him. To this day, I'm still annoyed by all of the storylines Lang created about Bunny without even bothering to call or text her about any of them.\n\nI'm interested in seeing how NoPixel changes as a result of Buddha running it, as I liked his most recent announcement against drama baiting and toxic behavior. While I thought Koil did a good job running the server, I always felt he had blind spots and favoritism toward toxic streamers who kept breaking the rules and clearly couldn't role-play.\n\nPersonally, I've never been a fan of whitelisting gangs and top heists either. I believe in making storyline \"ingredients\" attainable for everyone and letting them cook. Admittedly, I like Buddha's recent vision of \"pushing boundaries\" because I do think the role play gets stale when people cling onto what they have on the server or always hang out with the same cliques. As for his other announcement about NoPixel devs, I didn't really understand the implication--does it mean no more \"pocket devs\"?\n\nSpeaking of cliques, I'm really impressed by how well Claire leads her gang the Angels. They still wake up in the city regularly, prioritize loyalty to their gang over personal ambitions, make use of their meth lab, have five red laptop hackers, and actually have each other's and Hydra's backs. It made me realize why they succeeded where The Stable failed. (On a side note, I was surprised to find out they never had a bench back when they sold guns to The Stable.) Granted, it took months of me watching the Angels--and seeing how Claire and the other gang members looked out for Xavier--before I finally got over my bad first impression of them. Even to this day, I still find it disgusting when they proudly claim credit for standing with Randy of all people against The Stable.\n\nWatched movie: \"Hypnotic\" (2023)\n\nI think Robert Rodriguez should just stick to directing rather than trying to write plots. The movie started out decently with the weaponized hypnosis premise reminiscent of \"Scanners\". But by the end of the film, it felt more like a dime-store \"Inception\". Stay during the credits. Rating: 4\n\nWatched movie: \"Fast X\" (2023) in D-BOX\n\nThe laziest Fast & Furious plot yet, IMHO, which basically just assigned a fight scene to each character--and because this franchise has so many characters now, that didn't leave room for much else. Stay during the credits. Rating: 5\n\nIt's a Good Life\n\n5/8/2023\n\nI think my favorite proverb of all-time came from Sun Tzu: \"If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.\" That's come true in my lifetime so many times (metaphorically, of course) for everything from bad neighbors to bad co-workers. I recently came across another quote I liked: \"If I speak...\" for situations where someone prefers not to speak on because they don't want to get in trouble. The meme came from a viral post-game interview where football coach Jose Mourinho wanted to criticize a referee, but held back because \"If I speak I'm in big trouble, and I don't want to be in big trouble.\" Similarly, I've often seen situations that remind me of that Twilight Zone episode where the town has to keep telling a godlike kid what he wants to hear or else he could banish them to the \"cornfield\". But I think my favorite meme of all-time might be the cartoon dog that's sitting in the burning room and says, \"This is fine.\"\n\nDespite the scandals and the streamers leaving NoPixel, I still consider myself a proponent of the server. I see it as an evolving artistic canvas where people can create their own stories, designs, and music. Like where else would you see an event where the police have to escort the Mayor through the city as he tows a massive space shuttle? Or an arena layout where people could run their own WrestleMania-level event if they wanted? To me, abandoning NoPixel to a less experienced GTA server environment isn't the answer--rather, the people on NoPixel need to keep fighting to make it better for everyone. And the NoPixel staff need to stay the course and continue dumping out the garbage.\n\nI do still have one lingering question about the Deputy Mayor who got banned for sexually harassing women with the help of some clout his dev friend gave him: what kind of oversight and/or ethical guidelines does NoPixel have for the developers and admins role-playing on it? Like what's to stop an admin from say, taking a manufacturing bench away from a gang he doesn't get along with anymore and locking it on his own private island? Or more importantly, what's to stop the server owner himself from breaking his own server rules?\n\nStorywise, I'm over that Mayor Lang vs. Nick Simone arc and am hoping that Hardcastle's run for Mayor doesn't revive it (I still call him \"Hardcastle\" even though he changed his last name to Cohen). Those smear campaigns in Los Santos have stooped to such ugly lows--I still remember when Bunny expected to still be friends with Ramee before they campaigned against each other. Funny thing is, Ramee's gang leader Mr. K might be the best opponent for Hardcastle given how many enemies the CG umbrella have bullied and how reluctant Cerberus would be to get involved in such an election.\n\nAfter Lang demagogued the harmful mob mentality against \"Simone sympathizers\"--including AEGIS trying to take over the hospital and Lang leaking private personal texts obtained through torture--how do Cerberus employees still not see why people would view the company negatively? For instance, just because the Simone Memorial Hospital doctors sided with a dev character who created lots of role-play for them, doesn't make them his lovers and disciples. (Side note: props to Dr. Dahlia Fey for calling Mayor Lang, defusing the Twatter beef, and persuading him to increase the EMS and doctor pay for the hospital.) Admittedly, I did sour on the Nick character when he didn't own up to the airstrike (accidentally firing the first missile didn't excuse it in my mind) and fled the city to avoid the consequences for it.\n\nWatched movie: \"Suzume no tojimari\" (2022) a.k.a. \"Suzume\" (2023)\n\nAnother impressively animated Makoto Shinkai film, though I feel like his screenwriting has gotten cornier and harder to follow (and more eyebrow-raising). I was ok with the walking chair and taking cat, but my brain had trouble processing the notion that earthquakes are actually caused by giant ghost worms shooting out of doors to the afterlife. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"Evil Dead Rise\" (2023)\n\nBasically just a gorier retread of \"The Evil Dead\" with an apartment instead of a cabin, elevator cables instead of trees, a drill bit instead of a pencil, and a locked door instead of a locked cellar. Rating: 4\n\nWatched movie: \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" (2023) in 3D\n\nI consider it a testament to James Gunn's talents that he can turn such disturbing subject matter into a fun, operatic tearjerker. Stay during and after the credits. Rating: 7\n\nNot even useful as paperweights\n\n3/6/2023\n\nIn preparation for my office move, I discarded stacks and stacks of redundant software manuals that no one's ever going to read again. Even the IBM web sites I maintained and wrote documentation for are long gone, leading me to reflect on what I accomplished in my tech writing career and the whole meaning of life.\n\nI can cross off the Days Inn by Wyndham Santa Maria from my list of preferred hotel replacements for the Radisson. My room had no desk or convenient power outlet for my laptop; the shower rained water from a ceiling shower head; and the walls were so thin that I could hear my next-door neighbors' stupid conversations in the middle of the night and the morning noise of housekeeping carts rolling over cracks outside. But the main dealbreaker: the absence of \"do not disturb\" signs. I returned to see housekeeping cleaning my room with the door wide open, with my precious work laptop charging in plain sight where anyone could steal it.\n\nHmmm...I saw a couple of surprises at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, but I'm staying the course. My final Oscar predictions for 2022:\n\nBest picture: \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\"\n\nBest director: Daniels, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\"\n\nBest actor: Brendan Fraser, \"The Whale\"\n\nBest actress: Cate Blanchett, \"TÃ¡r\"\n\nBest supporting actor: Ke Huy Quan, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\"\n\nBest supporting actress: Angela Bassett, \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\"\n\nIn NoPixel news, congratulations to Sabith \"Bunny\" Cohen on finally getting her own mayoral portrait inside of City Hall. Given that I always considered her more of a populist mayor, they hung the portrait in the exact place I pictured it going: near the voting booths outside of the locked mayor's office. It was a rewarding payoff, as this has been the character's MacGuffin for several months and the main reason why she played it so safe as mayor. This also goes to show the storytelling importance of giving characters a dream to progress toward, whether it's Kirk owning a meth lab or Xavier getting out of debt.\n\nThe mayoral portrait also confirmed my cynicism that good work does not speak for itself in NoPixel. Just like Mayor Lang's portrait, someone had to pay real dollars to commission it and ask the right person behind-the-scenes to hang it up. It wasn't automatically awarded out of some time-honored tradition. I suspect prio in NoPixel works the same way--I think to get noticed, the characters have to connect with as many influential NoPixel players as possible (especially admins and developers). I'm convinced this was how Bunny first got gold prio and an appearance on the NoPixel loading screen. (Also when I look back, my favorite Itsjustasummerjob role play has always been when she left her comfort zone of relationship RP, e.g., confronting Richard about the morality of The Stable, the police interrogation over Lizzie's murder of ADA Malcador, the mayoral campaign, and the intellectual conversation with Sloane about how to improve civilian life.) I could be wrong though, as I'm still struggling to reconcile some of the NoPixel prio reductions. I've seen purposeless roleplayers who just hang out with their clique keep gold prio, while pillars of the NoPixel community have gotten snubbed. One possible theory of mine based upon the available data: the voting might be skewed toward characters who role-play well with the police community.\n\nSome streamers recently got permanently banned from NoPixel, proving in hindsight that my bad gut feelings about them were right. I still see red flags on other streamers on that server, too--particularly in how they treat women--and wouldn't be surprised if they're the next ones cancelled. This is why I don't buy the excuse that streamers' habitually scummy behavior should just be condoned as \"in character\" role play.\n\nWatched movie: \"The Outwaters\" (2023)\n\nGory, waytoodank \"found footage\" of four campers who went missing in the Mojave Desert. I found the third and final memory card vexing rather than scary. The constant jump cuts and illogical surrealism (was the cameraman getting transported around or was the camera filming rubber realities?) ruined my immersion. Stay after the credits. Rating: 2\n\nAt least I have my health\n\n2/20/2023\n\nThis year sucks. At least during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I enjoyed a couple of vacations in Las Vegas, streamed a lot of movies and TV, and ate healthier. This year I feel underappreciated at work, paid $803 for a hospital visit where they found nothing wrong with me, am losing my office because IBM wants to construct yet another new design center there, and am now planning to boycott my favorite hotel (once I use up my Radisson Rewards points) in Santa Maria because they cancelled my reservation without notice. Granted, they were absolutely right in that I mistakenly checked in a day late and they needed my room for a sold-out Saturday. But they didn't do anything to make it up to me, arguably their best customer. I guess they'd rather be in the right and lose thousands of my dollars in future business. Admittedly, their prices have become less and less reasonable lately--and this incident gave me the excuse I needed to stay somewhere cheaper.\n\nIn other news, I found the WWE Royal Rumble matches this year decent. So cool getting to watch the show for free on Peacock.\n\nI read that AMC Theatres is planning an initiative called Sightline, which will raise ticket prices on the \"preferred\" seats in the middle of the auditoriums. Although I can reserve the \"preferred\" seats for free because of my AMC Stubs A-List membership, I don't like the initiative because it encourages patrons to buy \"value\" seats in the front row (which distracts me from the screen).\n\nInteresting shake-up on NoPixel where the staff lowered something like 90% of everybody's prio, which I imagine hurt a lot of streamers' pride and might backfire if too many of them leave the city. It got me to thinking about which characters in the city I would consider \"essential\". I'd have to start with the devs, admins, and active founders of NoPixel; followed by pillars of the community who enable the most role play for others; followed by the most nontoxic and entertaining personalities. Needless to say, I've seen a lot of snubs and surprises so far.\n\nOther than that, not much going on in NoPixel except for some heart-tugging moments where characters realized the value of friendship over personal gain. Cases in point:\n\nFelix spending his unused millions of dollars to pay off his long-time friend Xavier's debt.\n\nKirk's GSF friend Brick splitting Mike Block's bounty with him.\n\nNancy sharing her bench fireworks and flares with Sooty.\n\nKirk apologizing to Nancy and making up with her.\n\nNancy's friends coming together to avenge VFT shooting her down.\n\nNancy--who by her own admission, always picks her boss Lang over anyone else--lamenting about friends leaving her.\n\nI also enjoyed watching Lang bringing Nancy and Eve into his inner circle, vindicating Nancy's fateful choice to pick him over her Stable friends. Although I'm forever a Stable fan, I think it's undeniable that Nancy's best role play has always been with Lang.\n\nI found it sad that Hardcastle got fired by two of the lamest PD commanders on the entire NoPixel police force. Hopefully he doesn't have the same problem as me regarding a lack of retirement plans. I do foresee his character getting a lot more interesting now.\n\nWatched movie: \"Knock at the Cabin\" (2023) in Dolby Cinema\n\nSomeone explain to me what the point of this M. Night Shyamalan film was, and what the point of the original novel was (which according to my Internet research, had a much different ending). Rating: 4\n\nWatched movie: \"Marlowe\" (2023)\n\nBasically like \"The Big Sleep\" where I had trouble following the dialogue, didn't get the humor, and didn't care much for the case. Liam Neeson was okay as the private eye Philip Marlowe, but he's no Humphrey Bogart. Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" (2023) in 3D\n\nA mildly entertaining spectacle that I found big on CGI and small on plot. It confused me why the superheroes couldn't keep enlarging themselves to swat every threat they met in the Quantum Realm. Stay during and after the credits. Rating: 6\n\nRest in Peace\n\n11/28/2022\n\nI'm finally free from \"The Walking Dead\" after sitting through that whole series finale where they basically opened more storylines than they concluded. I'm planning to watch zero of those spin-offs.\n\nThe discount Regal Edwards Santa Maria 10 theatre closed. Sadge.\n\nTo my amusement, someone in Twitch streamer Boogie's chat commented that whoever does Xavier Valentine's NoPixel wiki is \"insane\". Thanks. They also recommended reading my article about Xavier's legendary S+ boost of a McLaren 720S, which took place during my favorite Boogie stream of all time. Lately though, I've been weighing a new contender for favorite Boogie stream of all time: an emotional, glorious stream where he wound up hitting the hardest bank in Los Santos with three of the city's most prominent criminal leaders--who scrambled around completing hack after hack until it came time to spam the hardest bank hack in the entire city: the final vault door. And just before that vault door timer ran out, Xavier was the one to clutch the hack. It's like his whole life led up to this one gigantic vault room full of riches.\n\nI tried to dissect whether the third hacker, Marty, could have secretly one-shot the final vault door before Xavier's final attempt--but Marty wasn't streaming. He said he didn't care about money and just left Xavier and Claire alone to hack the final vault door at the risk of a timed shutdown. Marty also stated that the vault would have locked down had Xavier failed that last attempt--a credible claim because in Marty's subsequent vault heist, I watched him fail so many hacks that he almost lost two red laptops in a row. Either way, Xavier successfully completed the hardest bank hack in the city for his first time ever.\n\nIt was cool seeing Claire finally inviting Xavier into the Angels gang (I still remember their first interaction where to my disappointment, Xavier had barely spoke to her), allowing him to now wake up at \"Casa de la Angel\" and use their cars. Was also cool to have Angels editors visit Xavier's wiki (I plan to metaguard all of those impressive secrets the Angels showed him). I'm finally getting to know the Angels better than just their gun deals and that time they believed Randy and hopped onto his anti-Stable bandwagon.\n\nI didn't realize Randy was still mentally scarred by that argument last year where the Bandito Boys warned him against cooking meth in the casino hotel. He got triggered again when he found out the Angels recruited The Stable's former hacker Xavier (even though he had nothing to do with any of it). My theory is that because Randy never caught the Bandio Boys, he never got closure and was forced to settle for smear tactics against The Stable name. But we all saw how badly Ramee's smear campaign backfired against Bunny's victorious mayoral run.\n\nI get kinda sad nowadays listening to the phone conversations between ex-Stable members Xavier, Kirk, and Nancy--now that they're in separate gangs and seem to be drifting farther and farther apart. Especially now that Kirk is beefing with two of Nancy's gangs. Bravo to the scene where Kirk stood up for his true friend Wolfe (while BBMC leader Barry couldn't even remember Wolfe's last name) in the same mineshaft where the BBMC blooded Wolfe out. At the ease in which the BBMC bloods out even their most loyal of members, how long before it's Nancy or Collin standing there.\n\nWatched movie: \"The Woman King\" (2022)\n\nDecent historical epic about a real-life 1800's female army in Africa. Just as I suspected, a bunch of the movie was fictionalized to make its depressing slave trade premise more Hollywood. Stay during the credits. Rating: 6\n\nWatched movie: \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" (2022)\n\nThis Martin McDonagh film started out funny when the Irish villager (Colin Farrell) couldn't reconcile why his best friend (Brendan Gleeson) suddenly cut ties with him. But then it got too dark for me to enjoy. :P Rating: 5\n\nWatched movie: \"Glass Onion\" (2022)\n\nA Knives Out Mystery featuring another fun, subversive whodunit by Rian Johnson. I like how all of the twists and turns in these Benoit Blanc detective mysteries make the solution impossible to predict. Like the killer could be anyone from the person you least suspect to the person you most suspect. Or the killer could just be whoever is the most laughable. All in all, I would've rated the movie higher had it not destroyed the Mona Lisa for laughs. Rating: 7\n\nWatched movie: \"Strange World\" (2022) in 3D\n\nI found the spores and fungus in this Walt Disney Animation Studios movie ugly to look at, and was really fighting boredom until the ethical issues and twists stimulated my interest. Rating: 6\n\nVariant boost\n\n11/14/2022\n\nI received my fourth Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine (the bivalent booster dose) on November 4. The next morning, I felt chills and dull nerve pain.\n\nArt imitates life...\"Twatter\" (NoPixel's version of Twitter) began selling a blue checkmark to its users for $8000. It's hilarious satire because the Twatter accounts in NoPixel are permanently tied to the characters' names--making every twat authentic and the blue checkmark totally useless.\n\nTurn up Boogie's Twitch streams on NoPixel. I recently enjoyed a milestone S+ car boost where a shocking PD helicopter hot drop made him lose his composure on the hacks--but he still clutched it out. So add yet another S+ boost to his impressive resume of never blowing a car engine from failed hacks. Crazy how the police could just land their helicopter and cuff Xavier's boost car driver like that. Luckily, Xavier was able to pick up a replacement driver who could eventually clutch a getaway in their smoking car. Afterward, Xavier spoke with his long-time friend Kirk on the phone knowing that the Angels disapprove of their association (due to that casino hotel scandal that got Xavier's friend Abner permanently banned from NoPixel). I'm intrigued to see what happens next and whether the Angels will eventually ask Xavier to move to their gang app from Yokai (a prerequisite for defending their turf). Admittedly, I don't recall ever seeing Xavier this happy in a group before--The Stable was fun, but weighed down by secrecy, inhibitions, and dysfunction.\n\nThe Angels' gang leader Claire hit the nail square on the head when she reflected that sooner or later, gang members have to pick their gang over their friendships. If you ask me, that's what really killed The Stable--their reluctance to prioritize their group over friendships, business connections, and self-interests. Which I wouldn't call a bad thing, given that every single Stable member (except Abner) earned prio on their own merits rather than through their association with The Stable. I'm more inclined to say that gang mentality (both in NoPixel and in real-life) is the actual problem, not The Stable.\n\nCan't say I was thrilled to find out that Lang wants to run for Mayor. I already got fed up with mayoral corruption from incumbent Mayor Mickey, when he cared more about embezzling millions and millions of state funded dollars than paying budgets on time. Probably zero chance Lang would use this civilian position to help civilians, who have been giving up on the city because of their difficulties getting in. I liked Itsjustasummerjob's takes on \"content mayors\" and \"nothing mattering anymore\". The notion of a \"Talking NoPixel\" type stream where pundit(s) share insight about current NoPixel events intrigues me.\n\nWatched movie: \"Heojil kyolshim\" a.k.a. \"Decision to Leave\" (2022)\n\nProvocative Oscar entry from South Korea by the director of \"Oldboy\", where a detective becomes obsessed with an alluring murder suspect. Which got me to thinking: how messed up would it be if your soulmate turned out to be a murderer? Rating: 7\n\nWatched movie: \"TÃ¡r\" (2022)\n\nBravo to Todd Field for writing and directing such a masterfully nuanced film that when I looked up how true the scandal was afterward, I got confused to find out that Cate Blanchett had been portraying a fictional conductor that entire time. Just give Cate Blanchett the Oscar now. Rating: 7\n\nWatched movie: \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" (2022) in 3D\n\nStill hard to believe that Chadwick Boseman passed away, but props to director Ryan Coogler for making the returning cast members look cool and fierce. Rousing music by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson as well. Definitely stay during the credits. Rating: 7\n\nThe night is darkest just before the dawn\n\n11/3/2022\n\nWelp, I spoke to soon about the survival of two years worth of TV highlights on my HDD/DVD recorder. I took it in for another repair because none of the video inputs were working, and this time all of my recordings got deleted. Oh well, it's not like I go back and re-watch any of the recordings anyway.\n\nNot much going on right now in NoPixel. A lot of characters either stopped streaming or lack a storyline. I've mostly just been watching Xavier's quest to join the Angels--one of the few gangs left with a sense of humor--whose leader Claire claims to have broken up The Stable (I guess trying to take credit for breaking up The Stable has become a meme at this point). From what I've seen, Lexi seems like the only Angel who actually knew The Stable well enough to have an informed opinion about them. I would be interested to know Xavier's reason for \"mentally leaving\" The Stable--I don't think he's ever stated why.\n\nI'm curious how long Sabith \"Bunny\" Cohen's streamer will stay away from NoPixel on maternity leave given how quickly other people like Jeffy and Charlie returned. Hopefully she'll forget that weird idea she floated about writing her character off in a fatal, offscreen car accident. That would rival Poochie's death in \"The Simpsons\". Admittedly, civilians have it rough in NoP"
