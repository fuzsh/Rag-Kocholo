        "text": "Guidelines & Descriptions\n\nUndergraduate students of the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering who achieve scholastic excellence are eligible for scholarships, prizes, bursaries, medals and honours that have been established through the University, its alumni associations, governments, commercial organizations, and other benefactors to encourage and honour outstanding achievement.\n\nThe awards are listed alphabetically in four sections: OSOTF Admission Scholarships/Awards and non-OSOTF Admission Scholarships for students entering their first year in the Faculty, and OSOTF In-Course Scholarships/Awards and non-OSOTF In-Course Scholarships and Grants.\n\nThe National Scholarship Program\n\nUniversity of Toronto National Scholarships are awarded to Canadian secondary school students who demonstrate superior academic performance, original and creative thought, and exceptional achievement in a broad context.\n\nNational Scholars are students who not only excel in academic pursuits but also have an enthusiasm for intellectual exploration and involvement in the life of their school and community. The National Scholarship is available to Canadian citizens, Permanent Residents and protected persons currently in their final year of Canadian secondary school or first-year CEGEP who meet the criteria above.\n\nEach Canadian secondary school is invited to nominate one student on the basis of this criteria to receive a University of Toronto National Book Award. These students, and others who identify themselves as meeting the National Scholarship criteria, are invited to enter the National Scholarship Competition. Information is sent to secondary schools in the early fall; the National Scholarship application is available online and the deadline is in October of the student's graduating year.\n\n25 students are normally selected as finalists, with approximately 15 being selected as National Scholars (winners) and the remaining finalists being designated as Arbor Scholars. National scholars receive a scholarship that covers tuition, incidental, and residence fees for up to four years of undergraduate study. Arbor Scholars receive an award valued at $7,500 in the first year and $1,500 per year for three additional years of undergraduate study. Additional information is available online.\n\nUniversity of Toronto Scholars Program\n\nThe University of Toronto Scholars Program recognizes outstanding students at admission and on an ongoing basis. There are over 800 admission awards, valued at $10,000 each, which may be held in conjunction with admission awards students may receive from their college/faculty. Outstanding students are automatically considered for these awards.\n\nAwards under the University of Toronto Scholars Program are not renewable. Outstanding students, however, may be eligible for consideration for University of Toronto (in-course) Scholarships at the end of the first, second and third year of their programs. There are approximately 100 scholarships at each level. These in-course awards are worth $1,500 each and are tenable with other in-course scholarships.\n\nPresident's Scholars of Excellence Program\n\nApproximately 120 of the most highly-qualified students who apply to first-year of direct entry undergraduate studies will be distinguished as President’s Scholars of Excellence. This distinction includes a $15,000 entrance scholarship in first year.\n\nAdditional features may be offered by the admitting faculty, which will be communicated in the student's admission letter. Outstanding domestic and international secondary school students are automatically considered for these scholarships. The scholarship is tenable only in the faculty that makes the offer.\n\nPayment of the award is conditional on full-time registration at the University in the fall of the year the award is granted.\n\nLester B. Pearson International Scholarship Program\n\nIntroduced in September 2016, the Lester B. Pearson International Scholarship recognizes international students who demonstrate exceptional academic achievement and creativity and who are recognized as leaders within their schools. A special emphasis is placed on the impact the student has had on the life of their school and community, and their future potential to contribute positively to the global community.\n\nThis is U of T's most prestigious and competitive scholarship for international students. Each year, approximately 37 students are named Lester B. Pearson Scholars. The value of the scholarship covers tuition, incidental fees, books, and living expenses for four years of undergraduate study. Recipients also have access to enriched programs and services. Eligible international students must be nominated by their home school; nominees must subsequently submit their application for the scholarship by the yearly deadline.\n\nThe University's Commitment\n\nThe University's Policy on Student Financial Support states that students should have access to the resources required to meet their financial needs as calculated by the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP), with modifications if necessary. The commitment is based on the assumption that Canadian citizens/Permanent Residents/protected persons (recognized convention refugees) will first access the government aid for which they are eligible.\n\nUniversity of Toronto Advanced Planning for Students (UTAPS) funding is assessed based on OSAP, as it provides a uniform, verified method of assessing student need. The University will ensure unmet needs are met for full-time students (in both terms of an academic year) who are assessed by OSAP as requiring maximum assistance and whose assessed needs are not fully covered by government aid. Full-time students receiving funding from other provincial/territorial government loans and grants or Band funding/community sponsorship are also eligible for consideration.\n\nUniversity of Toronto Advanced Planning for Students (UTAPS)\n\nUTAPS is the University of Toronto’s largest need-based support program and covers the financial gap between a student’s actual education costs and the costs recognized by their provincial/territorial government student aid program. All students who wish to be considered for a UTAPS grant must submit an application through the Need Navigator.\n\nThe University Registrar's Office website has additional information as well as instructions on how to submit an application. First-year applicants should submit an application in March so they can be considered for need-based admission awards.\n\nGovernment Financial Aid\n\nThe Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) provides need-based financial assistance to Ontario residents who are Canadian citizens, Permanent Residents, or protected persons (recognized convention refugees).\n\nStudents in a course load of 60% or greater (40% for students with a confirmed disability) are considered for both federal and provincial non-repayable grants and interest-free student loans (while they're in full-time studies) to assist with educational and living expenses.\n\nOSAP applications are typically available in the Spring through the OSAP website. Students from other Canadian provinces and territories should apply for government student aid through their home province.\n\nUniversity of Toronto Work-Study Program\n\nThis program is funded by the University of Toronto and provides on-campus part-time employment to eligible students. Information and applications are available from the Career Centre.\n\nFinancial Aid for Students with Disabilities\n\nNon-repayable grants are available through the Ontario Bursary for Students with Disabilities (BSWD) and the Canada Student Grant for Services and Equipment - Students with Disabilities (CSG-DSE), to help with disability-related educational services and/or equipment for students with a permanent, persistent or prolonged disability. Information and online applications are available from University Registrar's Office and Accessibility Services.\n\nPart-Time Studies\n\nBoth the governments of Ontario and Canada offer funding for part-time students enrolled in course loads of less than 60% or less than 40% for students with a documented disability through the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP). Further information on the combination of grants and/or loan that students may be eligible to receive through OSAP for Part-Time Students is available on the OSAP website.\n\nThe Noah Meltz Grant program helps undergraduate students in certificate, degree, diploma programs, including Academic Bridging Program, pursue their University of Toronto studies on a part-time basis. Eligible students receive a non-repayable grant for tuition cost up to two credits during the fall/winter session and up to one credit during the summer session. The grant also includes a set amount for books, transportation to and from classes and, if applicable, child care. Further information and an online application are available through the University Registrar's Office website.\n\nInternational Students\n\nInternational students entering Canada or currently in Canada on student authorization are not eligible for government assistance and must ensure they have sufficient funds to cover all probable expenses. Such students cannot depend on gaining part-time employment in Canada to help pay for their studies. In addition, as a publicly funded institution, the University of Toronto is not able to offer direct financial aid to international students. You should look to your home country for financial aid programs.\n\nAdmission Scholarships\n\nPlease see the \"OSOTF\" and \"Non-OSOTF\" Admission Scholarships sections later in this Chapter for details.\n\nIn-Course Scholarships & Bursaries\n\nScholarships, prizes, bursaries and loans available to students in attendance in the Faculty are listed in this Chapter. Where it is necessary to apply for an award, details of how to apply are included. In all other cases, the award is made on the recommendation of the Faculty Council and no application is necessary.\n\nDean's Honours List\n\nIn 1983, Faculty Council instituted the Dean’s Honours List to give special recognition to every student who demonstrated academic excellence in an individual session. The requirements for qualifying for the Dean’s Honours List are outlined in the Academic Regulations section of the Academic Calendar.\n\nThe list is posted prominently for a limited time in a place designated by the Faculty for this purpose. Students can request to opt out of being displayed on the published list by submitting the online request form at the end of each term. The lists for successive sessions are compiled in a permanent record maintained in the Office of the Registrar.\n\nGeneral Terms & Conditions of Awards\n\nScholarships, prizes and medals granted in recognition of academic proficiency are awarded at the end of the Winter Term, and candidates are ranked on the basis of their achievements in the Winter and Fall Sessions previously completed.\n\nTo be eligible for any scholarship or award granted solely on academic standing, a student must normally have completed not less than the full course load (normally 5.0 credits) within the two sessions upon which the award is based. A student whose program in these two sessions contains repeated courses will only be eligible if the aggregate of new courses is equal to or greater than the full course load (normally 5.0 credits).\n\nScholarships, medals, and prizes based solely upon academic standing will be awarded only to students who have achieved honours in the work upon which the award is granted unless otherwise specified in the terms of the award. If the award is based on a single course or on part of the work of the session, the candidate must obtain unconditional pass standing in the work of the session, but not necessarily honours standing, unless the terms of the award so specify.\n\nA candidate will not normally be permitted to hold more than one award in a session unless the statute of each of the awards concerned or the Calendar specifies otherwise.\n\nTuition and residence fees are the first charge against awards. After the deduction of the applicable charges, any balance remaining will be paid to the recipient in November. Payment will be made only if the candidate is in regular attendance in the Faculty and, if the Calendar so specifies, in the program in which the award is established or granted.\n\nMedals, after they have been suitably engraved, will be given without delay to the winners.\n\nAwards granted to members of graduating classes, other than awards for graduate study and research, will be paid in one installment as soon as possible after the granting of the awards.\n\nThe Governing Council may, on the recommendation of the Faculty, permit a candidate to whom an award has been granted to postpone attendance in the Faculty for one year. Further postponement may be permitted on application.\n\nNote: The value of an endowed scholarship or prize is dependent on the actual income of the fund; it is possible that the value of certain scholarships and prizes at the time of payment may be greater or less than the amount stated in the Calendar.\n\nIn those cases where the amount of the award is not payable from income earned on an endowed fund, payment will be dependent on the receipt of the amount of the annual award from the donor.\n\nOntario Student Opportunity Trust Fund (OSOTF) Awards\n\nIn the case of all OSOTF awards, eligible candidates must be Ontario residents and they must demonstrate financial need. For the purpose of OSOTF awards, an Ontario resident is either a Canadian citizen or a Permanent Resident of Canada who has lived in Ontario for twelve consecutive months prior to starting a post-secondary program. Financial need is most easily demonstrated with receipt of OSAP for the current year; other examples of financial need may be considered. For OSOTF Admission Awards, it is crucial that applicants for admission Submit an application in March in order to demonstrate financial need.\n\nOSOTF Admission Scholarships\n\nFernando V.
