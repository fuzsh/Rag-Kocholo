        "text": "NCPR is made possible by\n\nYour Donations\n\nListeners' Favorite Books of the 20th Century\n\nAfter two programs (January 1999 and January 2000), during which we took your suggestions for the \"best of th e century\" booklist, here it is. While a few 19th century titles have slipped in here and there, this is essentially a tribute to 20th literature. Plenty of titles�from the light and frothy to the much weightier�to keep you busy until, well, at least the next century.\n\nSome authors were mentioned repeatedly for a variety of titles: E.B.White, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Solzhenitzyn, Pratchett, Kingsolver, Orwell, Faulkner, Cather, Woolf. Other authors were favored for a single title or series: C.S. Lewis (the Narnia series), Asimov (the Foundation series), Kundera (The Unbearable Lightness of Being), J.K. Rowling (the Harry Potter series), Tolkien (the trilogy and The Hobbit), Morrison (Beloved), Paton (Cry the Beloved Country), Remarque (All Quiet on the Western Front), Marquez (A Hundred Years of Solitude), Nabokov (Lolita), Achebe (Things Fall Apart), Kerouac (On the Road).\n\nThe unequivocal \"winners\" of the century, cited by so many of you, are: John Steinbeck�s The Grapes of Wrath and Harper Lee�s To Kill a Mockingbird. It�s been years since I read either of these, though I remembering loving both when I read them as a teenager. In light of their staying power with so many of you, perhaps it�s time for me to revisit them.\n\nThanks to all of you for sharing your literary loves so enthusiastically.\n\nEllen\n\nMARTHA FOLEY, NCPR News Director\n\nCollected Essays, E.B. White\n\nStuart Little, E.B. White\n\nFoundation (series), Isaac Asimov\n\nRICHARD HUNT (NCPR Guest Host)\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee (Pulitzer 1961)\n\nGospel, Wilton Barnhardt\n\nA Confederacy of Dunces, John Kennedy Toole (Pulitzer 1981)\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck (Pulitzer 1940)\n\nCannery Row, John Steinbeck\n\nA Fine Balance, Rohinton Mistry\n\nBonfire of the Vanities, Tom Wolfe\n\nWinesburg, Ohio, Sherwood Anderson\n\nAdmiral of the Ocean Sea, Samuel Eliot Morison\n\nThe Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, Oscar Hijuelos (Pulitzer 1990)\n\nThe Dork of Cork, Chet Raymo\n\nMartin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer, Steven Milhauser (Pulitzer 1997)\n\nGiants in the Earth: A Saga of the Prairie, O.E. Rolvaag\n\nCry the Beloved Country, Alan Paton\n\nJohn Marshall: Definer of a Nation, Jean Edward Smith\n\nA Very Long Engagement, Sebastian Japrisot\n\nCorelli�s Mandolin, Louis De Bernieres\n\nThe Catcher is a Spy: The Moe Berg Story, Nicholas Dawidoff\n\nIndependent People, Halldor Laxness\n\nThe Path Between the Seas, David McCullough\n\nThe Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, Anne Fadiman\n\nThe Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera\n\nPalace Walk, Naguib Mahfouz\n\nThe Citadel, A.J. Cronin\n\nEinstein�s Dreams, Alan Lightman\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front, Erich Maria Remarque\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway\n\nAmsterdam, Ian McEwan\n\nPlus anything by novelists Jane Hamilton, Bret Lott\n\nJACKIE SAUTER (NCPR Program Director)\n\nA Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Nobel Prize winning author). THE Latin American novel, that beautifully sums up the political and cultural history of a continent, a fine example of magical realism, great storytelling, and gorgeous writing.\n\nComplete Short Stories, Flannery O�Connor. A breathtaking body of work by a Southern woman who had an important impact on 20th century American fiction. She died way too young, at age 39.\n\nCatch 22, Joseph Heller. The quintessential modern, ironic novel that everyone should read at least once, preferably in early adulthood.\n\nBeloved, Toni Morrison (Pulitzer). A gorgeously written and important novel about the impact of slavery on individuals and on our culture.\n\nThe Cairo Trilogy: Palace Walk; Palace of Desire; Sugar Street, Naguib Mahfouz (Nobel Prize winning author). Wonderful storytelling from a master of letters.\n\nRUSS JACOBY (NCPR Evening Host)\n\nA Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, William L. Shirer\n\nThe Civil War: A Narrative, Shelby Foote (3 vols)\n\nOn the Road, Jack Kerouac\n\nA Farewell to Arms, Ernest Hemingway\n\nThe Second World War, Winston Churchill (5 vols)\n\nTobacco Road, Erskine Caldwell\n\nRabble in Arms, Kenneth Roberts\n\nThe Naked and the Dead, Norman Mailer\n\nThe Call of the Wild, Jack London\n\nDONNA WILLIAMSON (NCPR Board Member)\n\nHow Reading Changed My Life, Anna Quindlen. It is a small book, but let me know that there are others out there just like me. Nothing has sustained me over time like my love of reading�for information, for pleasure, for the pure music of language in the right hands�and I met a book loving friend when I read her descriptions of reading experiences.\n\nBiblioholism: The Literary Addiction, Tom Rabe. A hoot. He discusses everything from the varieties of the \"disease\" and the history of various strains to how a biblioholic packs and how they read in various places.\n\nBookworms: Great Writers and Readers Celebrate Reading, Laura Furman and Elinore Standard, editors. A collection of voices about the reading experience.\n\nThe Most Wonderful Books: Writers on Discovering the Pleasure of Reading, Michael Dorris and Emilie Buchwald, eds.\n\nEx Libris, Anne Fadiman.\n\nA Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes and the Eternal Passion for Books, Basbanes.\n\nBOB MARSHALL, Burlington, VT\n\nOn the Road, Jack Kerouac. This is my pick for book of the century. I first read it in 1957 and about every 10 years or so, reread it. I also loved Kerouac�s first book, The Town and The City, the ending being an introduction to the BEAT GENERATION.\n\nKATE WHALEN, Potsdam, NY (high school junior)\n\nAngela�s Ashes, Frank McCourt\n\nThe Little Prince, Antoine de Saint-Exupery\n\nThe Phantom Tollbooth, Norton Juster\n\nThe 13 Clocks, James Thurber\n\nMatilda, Roald Dahl\n\nThe Westing Game, Ellen Raskin\n\nHarry Potter (series), J.K. Rowling\n\nThe Moorchild, Eloise McCraw\n\nThe Master Puppeteer, Katherine Paterson\n\nThe Midwife�s Apprentice/Catherine, Called Birdy, Karen Cushman\n\nThe Giver, Lois Lowry\n\nPlus, a vote for these authors� works: Erma Bombeck, Dave Barry, David Eddings (fantasy), J.R.R. Tolkien, Lloyd Alexander (the Black Cauldron series especially), Bruce Coville, P.G. Wodehouse, Agatha Christie, John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway.\n\nHEIDI KRETSER, Paul Smith�s (Adirondack Communities and Conservation Program)\n\nThe Hobbit (et al), J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nSand County Almanac, Aldo Leopold\n\nSilent Spring, Rachel Carson\n\nEast of Eden, John Steinbeck\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo�s Nest, Ken Kesey\n\nA Prayer for Owen Meany, John Irving\n\nPlus, a vote for authors Barbara Kingsolver and Milan Kundera\n\nDIAHANN NADEAU, Sutton, Quebec\n\nImmortality/The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera.\n\nThe Great Gatsby/Tender is the Night, F.S. Fitzgerald. In my opinion, he towers above his contemporaries in American fiction; neither Hemingway nor Steinbeck nor anyone else writing at that time wrote as beautifully and poignantly as Fitzgerald.\n\nLolita, V.Nabokov. He is my favorite writer of this century; I love all his material. I agree with the caller who suggested he was the best writer working in the English language. He is an amazing stylist.\n\nThe Master and Margarita, Mikhail Bulgakov. This is an early Soviet writer with a wicked satirical ability; some of his short works are brilliant. This is a longer book, imaginative, filled with fascinating ideas and characters. Just pure pleasure to read.\n\nPortrait of a Marriage, Nigel Nicholson. An incredible work of non-fiction about the author�s parents, Harold N. and Vita Sackville-West. He uses material from Vita�s diaries which reveals her passionately intense love affair with Violet Trefusis. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.\n\nThe White Hotel/Swallow, D.M. Thomas. Both novels are unusual, the first about a patient of Freud�s whose dreams anticipate the Holocaust, and the second about a storytelling Olympics set in Finland. Wonderful imagination at work in both.\n\nAppointment in Samarra, John O�Hara. A novella that is exquisitely precise in its account of the downfall of an upper middle class man. No word is wasted, and the ending is as inevitable as the sunset. The best from a very fine American writer who has been unustifiably ignored for decades.\n\nRunning in the Family/The English Patient, Michael Ondaatje. The first is his marvelous memoir of growing up in Ceylon (Sri Lanka); his family makes great material for a book, though living with them could not have been too easy.\n\nBETSY FOLWELL & TOM WARRINGTON, Blue Mountain Lake\n\nPeterson�s Field Guides\n\nKAREN DAWSON, Burlington\n\nMagic Mountain, Thomas Mann\n\nMan Without Qualities, Robert Musil\n\nThe Master and Margarita, Mikhail Bulgakov\n\nCancer Ward, Alexander Solzhenitsyn\n\nDr. Zhivago, Boris Pasternak\n\nThings Fall Apart, Chinua Achebe\n\nThe Last Gentleman, Walker Percy\n\nThe Crossing, Cormac McCarthy\n\nA People�s History of the United States, Howard Zinn\n\nPoetry, Language, Thought, Martin Heidegger\n\nThe Hedgehog and the Fox, Isaiah Berlin\n\nArt as Experience, John Dewey\n\nThe Art Spirit, Robert Henri\n\nThe Political Unconscious, Fredric Jameson\n\nSUE WILSON, Ogdensburg\n\nWatership Down, Richard Adams\n\nThe Stand, Stephen King\n\nJonathan Livingston Seagull, Richard Bach\n\nJane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte\n\nROSALIE SMITH, Massena\n\nEndurance: Shackleton�s Legendary Antarctic Expedition, Caroline Alexander\n\nThe River Midnight, Lilian Nattel\n\nI Heard the Owl Call My Name, M. Craven\n\nJILL RUBIO, Potsdam\n\nLiteracy (via mandatory school attendance and a modern Western economy) greatly expanded in the 20th century, and books written for young readers have had a wide impact, and an emotional appeal to many. So much that we love to share these books with our kids as soon as they�re old enough to appreciate them. Here are some of my favorites:\n\nAnne of Green Gables (series), Lucy Maud Montgomery\n\nChronicles of Narnia (series), C.S. Lewis\n\nThe Hobbit/Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nThe Secret Garden/A Little Princess, Frances Hodgson Burnett\n\nWinnie the Pooh collection, A.A. Milne\n\nIn the Night Kitchen/Where the Wild Things Are etc., Maurice Sendak. (As much for the literary content as for his artwork!)\n\nMy favorite grownup books of the century include:\n\nThe Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Tom Wolfe\n\nDr. Zhivago, Boris Pasternak\n\nThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, La Leche League. A pioneering book which helped millions of women to nurse their babies, despite the trend of artificial feeding which ws so in vogue after WWII.\n\nNo Ordinary Time, Doris Kearns Goodwin (Pulitzer)\n\nTHE BELLINGER FAMILY, Ogdensburg\n\nJake, age 10:\n\nDinotopia/The World Beneath, James Gurney\n\nThe Dragons are Singing, Jack Prelutsky\n\nHarry Potter (series), J.K.

Pratchett is the best I know for humor and humanity, and unlikely characters mixing into psychological Rube Goldberg machines that grind out--are--solutions somehow a perfect fit for the predicaments in question. (Chris also highly recommends audio versions of some selected material, including the Recorded Books� release of 184, Charing Cross Road by Helene Hanff, and the Penguin Audiobook collection of English poetry from the Elizabethans to the early 20th century.)\n\nLINDA UPPER\n\nAuthors Nevil Schute and Erich Maria Remarque\n\nNANCY KNOX, Burlington\n\nAnimal Dreams, Barbara Kingsolver\n\nThe Hobbit/Fellowship of the Ring Trilogy, J.R.R.

Set my world on its ear, opened me up to future readings that treated women more profoundly (e.g., The Bell Jar, Slouching Toward Bethlehem, The Awakening).\n\nBeneath the Underdog, Charles Mingus\n\nMusic of the Common Tongue, Christopher Small. In terms of my life as someone who talks and writes about African-American music, no book has been as important. It�s gives the best description of black music in the U.S. that I know.\n\nThe Jazz Text, Charles Nanry\n\nThe Soul of Black Folk, W.E.B. DuBois\n\nMy Life in the Bush of Ghosts, Amos Tutuola. The book that led me to understand that folks from different places really DO see the world differently.\n\nThe Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler.

No, it really isn�t about sex.\n\n(Don is one of the few people I know who still uses a manual typewriter.

Had he not, included in his list would have been works by Lenin, Einstein, Keynes, Hitler, and Crick and Watson.\n\nShooting an Elephant and Other Essays, George Orwell. Some of the best writing of one of the century�s best writers. Wonderfully clear and delightfully free of cant.\n\nGood-bye to All That, Robert Graves. A stark and honest account of the experience of war, written by a most unusual warrior. Witty and sobering by turns. A model autobiography.\n\nSurvival, Evasion and Escape (FM 21-76). This Department of Army field Manual is a browser�s delight. Good advice for every occasion and contingency.\n\nOld Glory, Jonathan Raban. The author takes a small boat down the Mississippi. A droll and acerbic tour of America�s heartland of darkness.\n\nThe American Language, H.L. Mencken. Not the last word, of course, but a good beginning . Proof that a book can be both scholarly and readable.\n\nCollected Poems, Philip Larkin. My candidate for the voice of the twentieth century -- romantic and lacerating, a sort of cannibal Candide. Larkin�s poems are truth distilled to a bitter, intoxicating liquor. Not for the squeamish. Not for children. You�ve been warned.\n\nAmerican Visions, Robert Hughes. A history of visual art in America, from the first years of European settlement to the present day, by a man who is an engaging mix of historian, critic and polemicist.\n\nCollected Speeches, Winston S. Churchill. The English language in its finest hour. Churchill up on his hind legs, bullying, entreating, persuading and inspiring. His robust and resonant words are far from the boneless and denatured idiom of today�s political speech as it is possible to get.\n\nScoop, Evelyn Waugh. Written 1937, this hilarious send-up of contemporary journalism rings just as true today as it did then.\n\nThe American Way of Death, Jessica Mitford\n\nTHE GILBORN FAMILY, Blue Mountain Lake\n\nAlice:\n\nThe Dollmaker, Harriet Arno\n\nThe Shipping News, Annie Proulx\n\nA Thousand Acres, Jane Smiley\n\nDinner at the Homesick Restaurant, Ann Tyler\n\nCat�s Eye, Margaret Atwood\n\nFamily Pictures, Sue Miller\n\nThe Sunlight Dialogues, John Gardner\n\nPortrait of a Lady, Henry James\n\nTender is the Night, F.

White and Edith Wharton\n\nELLEN ROCCO, NCPR manager/Readers & Writers host\n\nOkay, I�ve admired your choices and tip my hat to all of you who bit the bullet and narrowed down those lists. How cruel of me to ask that of you. Well, I guess I must submit my list to the axe, too. Here�s what I�ve done: rather than try to pick the \"best\" books of the century (seems a bit presumptuous anyway), I�ve picked the ones that changed my life or world view at the time I read them.\n\nTom Sawyer and EVERYTHING else written by Mark Twain. I know, I know, Twain did most of his writing in the 19th century, but I read everything by him, including the last books, and that�s why he�s on my list. I can still remember the gray Sunday when I was about 10 or 11 years old, bored, and looking for something to do, and my mother suggested Tom Sawyer. My parents owned the complete works of Twain, and from Tom Sawyer I moved on to all the subsequent volumes. I loved Twain, but I also loved immersing myself in a single author�s voice. It began a habit I have had ever since of reading everything I can get my hands on by authors whose initial work I enjoy. I followed Twain with Steinbeck, Hemingway, Dos Passos and so on. But Tom Sawyer started it all for me.\n\nCry the Beloved Country, Alan Paton. Shocked as I was by this story of apartheid, the parallels between South Africa and the South of my own country were glaring and set the stage for my youthful involvement in the civil rights movement.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, William Shirer. I read this shortly after its publication in the early �60s. I had read several personal and harrowing accounts of holocaust survival and holocaust death. This comprehensive history somehow made it all real, horrifyingly real.\n\nInvisible Man, Ralph Ellison. Whether you were a black man in white America, a Jew in Nazi Germany, or outside the circle of any society�s power and dominant culture, Ellison reached inside the experience and made the reader squirm.\n\nThe Golden Notebook, Doris Lessing. While others were reading the widely popular feminist theorists of the �60s and early �70s, I discovered Lessing�and myself.\n\nThe Sotweed Factor, John Barth. This book taught me that I could love difficult writing. Barth pulled me in and wouldn�t let go. (Soon after, I read Thomas Mann�s Magic Mountain and loved that too.)\n\nFire in the Lake, Francis Fitzgerald. Written in the mid-�60s, this book did for my understanding of the Vietnam War what Shirer did for my understanding of WWII.\n\nSophie�s Choice, William Styron. After all the books I read about the Holocaust, after all the conversations with survivors and their children, after getting to a point where I thought I�d heard it all, along comes this one. Talk about direct hits to the solar plexus.\n\nA Prayer for Owen Meany, John Irving. The heart and spirituality in this book touched me in a place that is beyond words. (I�ve liked virtually everything Irving has written, but the one book I never read is, yup, The World According to Garp.)\n\nA Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Aside from being one of the most beautiful and haunting books of the century, this book began a journey for me through the literature of so many incredible authors who hail from places far beyond the boundaries of North American and Western Europe; Marquez inspired me to explore.\n\nSo, that�s ten books. But, oh no, what about the poets? The poets who I would sound like if only I could sing: T.S. Eliot, Ginsberg, Lorca, Willie Dixon, Bob Dylan, Ferlinghetti, DiPrima�so many more than ten."
