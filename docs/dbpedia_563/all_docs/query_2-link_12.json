        "text": "The National Wrestling Hall of Fame has announced that Wisconsin head wrestling coach Barry Davis is the recipient of the 2007 Distinguished Member award. Former Wisconsin wrestler and head coach Russ Hellickson, along with three-time national champion Lee Kemp, have also earned this award.\n\n'I feel very honored to receive this award,' said Davis. 'To be recognized by the National Wrestling Hall of Fame is something special'\n\nAccording to the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, a Distinguished Member is a wrestler who has achieved extraordinary success in national and/or international competition, a coach who has demonstrated great leadership in the profession and has compiled an outstanding record, a contributor whose long-term activities have substantially enhanced the development and advancement of the sport, or any combination of the above qualifications.\n\nAs a collegian at the University of Iowa, Davis was the winningest wrestler at the winningest program at the university level. Davis graduated in 1985 with a career record of 162-9-1 (.945). He still holds school records for wins in a season (46 in 1982) and career (162) and is fourth in career winning percentage.\n\nDavis dominated the Big Ten, becoming one of only nine wrestlers in history to win four league titles. The teams he competed on at Iowa were equally dominant, winning Big Ten championships in each of Davis' four years. The 1983 Iowa team had an unprecedented nine Big Ten titlists. After his senior season, Davis was honored as the Big Ten's Athlete of the Year, one of only two wrestlers to win the prestigious award.\n\nOn the national level, Davis was a four-time All-American and a three-time NCAA champion. After placing seventh as a freshman, Davis won national titles in 1982, 1983 and 1985. Iowa won NCAA team titles all four years that Davis competed. Following the 1985 NCAA Championships, Davis was named Outstanding Wrestler of the Tournament.\n\nTaking a year off from collegiate competition paid off for the senior-to-be when he earned a silver medal (125.5 pounds) at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Davis was also a member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic team that competed in Seoul, South Korea. He attempted to make his third Olympic team in 1992 but was eliminated at the U.S. Trials. Davis was also runner-up at the 1987 World Championships after winning the Olympic Sports Festival.\n\nA 1985 graduate of the University of Iowa, Davis began his coaching career as a graduate assistant to legendary head coach Dan Gable from 1986'87. Davis was an assistant coach at Iowa from 1988'92, helping guide the Hawkeyes to four top-six finishes, including NCAA championships in 1991 and 1992. He coached current UW assistant coach Bart Chelesvig from 1987'92 and Donny Pritzlaff from 1998-2001."
