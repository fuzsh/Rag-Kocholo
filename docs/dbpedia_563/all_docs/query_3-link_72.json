        "text": "More about James Low\n\nFormerly 2129, Black Watch\n\nJames Low D.C.M. 2129 Black Watch\n\nDUNDEE BLACK WATCH SOLDIER\n\nIS AWARDED THE D.C.M.\n\nPrivate James Low, Black Watch, 23 Wolseley Street, will receive the welcome news to-day that he has been awarded the D.C.M.\n\nPrivate Low, who was wounded in the recent fighting, is at present lying in hospital in London, and letters intimating that he has been honoured have been received from officers of the battalion.\n\nCaptain W. S. Robertson says :―“I want congratulate you most warmly on your D.C.M., and the work you did to win it. Everyone is glad about it. I am very proud of No. 8, which had four men mentioned―yourself, Corporal Adam (who has got the Military Medal), Lance-Corporals Myles and Adam. The two last-mentioned have not been awarded anything so far, but they still may.”\n\nPrivate Low, who is 26 years of age, was a moulder in Wallace Foundry when war broke out, but he at once joined Dundee’s Own, and has seen a lot of service. He took part in the battles of Festubert, Loos, and Neuve Chapelle. He was wounded at the first engagement mentioned, but had returned to the firing line. Private Low is a son of the late Mr George Low, music seller, Crichton Street.\n\nDundee Courier 3rd July 1916\n\n2129 Pte. J. Low, 4/5th Bn., R. Highrs., T.F. (LG 27 July 1916).\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry during a successful raid on the enemy’s trenches. As leading bayonet man he was first into their trench and showed great dash and bravery, accounting for four of the enemy. When he reached the block he bombed till he was wounded in the arm and other places.\n\nLondon Gazette\n\nDUNDEE D.C.M. FIRST MAN IN ENEMY TRENCH.\n\nPrivate James Low, 4/5th Black Watch, who has been awarded the D.C.M. for conspicuous gallantry in connection with a raid on an enemy trench, is a married man of 26 years of age, and his home is at 10 Clepington Street, Dundee.\n\nPrivate Low was the first man to enter the enemy trench in this raid. He has seen a lot of service in this war, having been engaged in several of the big engagements. He was previously wounded on 9th May of last year. In connection with the raid where his bravery has gained him this honour, Private Low was one of four members of a platoon who were all recommended for recognition.\n\nPrivate Low has brother, Sergeant George Low, Gordon Highlanders, who is a prisoner of war.\n\nDundee Courier 28th July 1916\n\nPrivate James Low, D.C.M., Black Watch, was the recipient of a gold watch from friends in the Greenmarket, Dundee, yesterday.\n\nPrivate Low is an “old boy” of the market, and the stallholders, who are justly proud of their lads, took the opportunity of showing their appreciation of the honour conferred upon them. This is the second occasion upon which one of their number has gained this distinction, the other recipient being Sergeant John T. M’Quire, H.L.I.\n\nA large crowd assembled in the market to witness the ceremony. Lord Dean of Guild Dickie, who presided, said they were met to do honour to one who had been connected with the market for many years.\n\nMr J. C. Robertson said they all felt greatly the bravery of our soldiers at the front. Some had opportunities that others did not, but all believed that the whole of them were animated with the one spirit and the one aim―to obtain a victory, not only for ourselves and our colleagues in France, but for all the nations of the world. The presentation to Private Low might have been done before, but the D.C.M. was not without damage, the soldier being wounded in both legs. He was sure they all wished him good luck and a safe return from France.\n\nThe watch bore the inscription :―“Presented to Private James Low, D.C.M., by friends in the Greenmarket, 6th October, 1916.”\n\nPrivate Low said :―I am a rotten speaker. I would give ten quid to get out of this. I must thank the people of the Greenmarket for their kindness. I feel more nervous now than the whole time I was in France. I hope I am spared to come back and wear the watch, which I will keep in memory of the old friends in the Market. It is only when you are away that you know your friends.\n\nOn the call of Mr James Walker, markets superintendent, the Lord Dean and Mr Robertson were thanked."
