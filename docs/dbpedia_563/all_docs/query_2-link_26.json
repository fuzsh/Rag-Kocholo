        "text": "Rider University baseball coach Dr. Barry Davis is hosting a leadership seminar featuring three of the most notable student-athletes to ever compete at the Lawrenceville-based school.\n\nFormer NBA standout Jason Thompson, Seattle Mariners pitcher Nick Margevicius and Olympian Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian will take part in a panel discussion that will touch on their paths to the professional level and obstacles they encountered.\n\n“I am inclined to offer the opportunity to our student-athletes to dive deeply into becoming elite,” said Davis, who is about to begin his 19th year as coach and has led the baseball team to three NCAA regional appearances. “Elite requires vision, a personal mastery plan, and action. Our guests are some of the best to wear a Rider uniform.”\n\nThe event will take place on Wednesday, Jan. 25 at 6:30 p.m. at the Bart Luedeke Student Center and is open to the campus community.\n\nThompson starred for the men’s basketball team from 2004-08 and was selected 12th overall by the Sacramento Kings in the 2008 NBA Draft. He finished his college career ranked third in program history with 2,040 points and went on to play in a franchise-record 541 games for the Kings over seven seasons.\n\nMargevicius pitched three seasons at Rider before he was taken by the San Diego Padres in the seventh round of the 2017 MLB Draft. The southpaw made his big league debut for the Padres in 2019 and has appeared in 32 games for San Diego and Seattle. He spent last season with the Mariners’ Triple-A affiliate in Tacoma.\n\nFenlator-Victorian was a track & field athlete in the shot put, discus and hammer before she switched to the ice where she has competed for both the United States and Jamaica in bobsled at the Winter Olympics.\n\n“All three arrived as winners and departed as serial winners,” Davis said. “If you want to be the best, associated with the best. Nick, Jason and Jazmine check those boxes.”"
