        "text": "THE PRESENTATION CEREMONY.\n\nThe ceremony of Saturday last, the presentation\n\nof the Soudan war medals to the members of the\n\nContingent, attracted a large body of spectators to\n\nthe Agricultural Society's grounds at Moore Park.\n\nA canvas awning was spread tor the accommodation\n\nof the vice-regal party and the numerous throng of\n\nofficials, ladies, and invited guests who had the privi-\n\nlege of entrance to the enclosure ; a privilege which\n\nwas evidently fully appreciated, for every seat was\n\noccupied far in advance of the contract time for the\n\nbeginning of business. With a punctuality which\n\nhas alreadymade many friends for Lord Carrington, his\n\narrival on the ground was announced shortly after 3\n\no'clock by the music of the bands in the distance, and\n\nshortly afterward his Excellency, in the uniform of\n\ncolonel of tie Sydney Lancers, dismounted in front\n\nof the dais, in company with Major-General Richard\n\nson, Colonel Roberts, the members of the vice-regal\n\nBuite, and a number of other officers. After a brief\n\nacknowledgment of the presence of some of the\n\neading colonists in the front rank of spectators, the\n\nbusiness of the day was initiated, and the names of\n\nthe claimants for Soudan honors called out. As each\n\nman answered to his name, he stepped forward, re\n\nceived his medal and a, cordial shake of the hand from\n\nthe first gentleman in the colony,' and retired\n\nwith speed to make way for the throng- yet to come.\n\nOne hero with a grievance took the trouble to\n\nappear before his Excellency for no other apparent\n\nreason but to decline the proffered decoration. He\n\nwas summarily disposed of by a courteous intimation\n\nto ' move on,' and without, alas ! the opportunity\n\nof placing on Record his objections to the only dis\n\ntinguishing mark of her Majesty's approval he will,\n\nperhaps, ever have the opportunity of attaining.- At\n\nthe conclusion of the presentation, his Excellency\n\nand Lady Carrington passed down the line on horse\n\nback, the band playing the National Anthem, and\n\nher ladyship then remained on horseback until the\n\nconclusion of the ceremony, when she accompanied\n\nher husband (the new colonel of the Sydney Lancers)\n\noff the ground at the head of his regiment.\n\nAmong the large number behind or near the Go\n\nvernor's dais were Sir John Robertson, Colonial\n\nSecretary, Mr. J. H. Young, Minister of Education;\n\nMr. G. B. Simpson, Attorney-General; Sir John Hay,\n\nPresident of the Legislative Council, and Sir Alfred\n\nStephen, Mr. W. B. Daliey, and Mr. F. M.\n\nDarley, Ms.L.C. ; Mr. E. Barton (Speaker of\n\nthe Legislative Assembly), and Sir Patrick\n\nJennings, and Messrs. Dibbs, G. H. Reid, Copeland,\n\nTarrant, Judd, Bull, R. B. Smith, Cass, Lloyd, Wil\n\nkinson, M8.L.A. ; Sir E. Strickland, Mr. R. B.\n\nSheridan, M.L.A., Queensland; Mr. John Young\n\nMayor of Sydney), Alderman T. Playfair, Messrs. F.\n\nA. Wright, H. E. Cohen, E. Fosbery (Inspector\n\nGeneral of Police), Commander Taylor, Lieutenants\n\nSmith and Thomas, of the Wolverene : Griffin (.Ame\n\nrican Consul), Critchett Walker, L. J. Harnett, J. J.\n\nCalvert, J. A. Hogue, Cnraow, F. E. Rogers,\n\nW. W. Stephen, C.Kahlo, Alderman Withers, H. E.\n\nAllen, E. Lee, andDu Faur. The ladies furnished a\n\nvery numerous contingent, and added to the pic\n\nturesque scene by the lively and diversified colors of\n\ntheir dresses. In addition to those in the inner\n\ncircle, a mass of people ranged themselves compactly\n\nround the fence, and there could not have been much\n\nless than 20,000 persons on the ground altogether.\n\nOf these the military numbered altogether 2573, of all\n\narms and ranks. The Governor, Lord Carrington, on\n\nhis arrival on the ground was received by Major\n\nGeneral Richardson and staff, and conducted to the\n\ndais. His Excellency was accompanied by Captain\n\nCuthill and a detachment of lancers. Captain Bun\n\nbury, E.A., Major Fenrose, R.E., Major Taunton,\n\nColonel Roberts, Major Mackenzie, Colonel Bingham,\n\nCaptain Milward, and Lord Bertie, Captain Gas\n\ncoigne, Captain Terry, and Captain Leigh (aidesde\n\ncamp).

In some cases no response was made,\n\nand the medal was laid aside, and may be claimed at\n\nthe Brigade Office. Father Collingridge was repre\n\nsented by his neice, Miss Maud Collingridge, and the\n\nlate Gunner Cockburn by his widow. At the close of\n\nthe presentation ceremony his Excellency addressed\n\nthe men as follows : —\n\n' Major-General Richardson, Officers, NonCommis\n\nsioned officers, and men of the Soudan Contin\n\ngent, —\n\nIt is just twelve months— twelve months yesterday —\n\nsince the offer of this country to send a body of Australian\n\ntroops to aid the Empire in Egypt was made to England.\n\nThat offer was dispatched on Thursday, February 12 of\n\nlast year ; and the following Sunday, twelve months ago\n\nto-morrow, that offer was received by the Imperial Govern\n\nment with thanks and pride.\n\nYour action touched the heart of the British people. It\n\ndid this under a feeling- of warm attachment ana loyalty to\n\nthe British Empire, in the midst of a great and almost\n\nuniversal public sorrow for the loss of one of the\n\nmost chivalrous Englishmen, mho ever breathed the\n\nbreath of JLife; and your proceedings were -watched\n\nin England with an interest which can alone be\n\nunderstood by those who witnessed it. On the\n\nContinent of Europe it was felt that the Empire,\n\nhowever distant its portions, was a mighty Union, anima\n\nted with the same noble purposes, and thrilling with the\n\nsame national emotions ; and -while this -was felt through\n\nout Continental Europe, the news of your action was\n\nreceived with admiration and sympathy by that great\n\nAmerican people who have so wondrously increased the\n\nrenown of our race.\n\nYou took your place, for the ftrst time in history, as\n\ncolonists armed in the service of the Empire on distant\n\nbattle-fields. In the eloquent language of our Chief\n\nJustice, you became the ' companions in arms of those\n\nfamous warriors who have fought and conquered on every\n\nland and on every sea.'\n\nEvery British soldier will rejoice that you. who have\n\nproved your readiness to serve and to die, should have re\n\nturnedsafe to your families and friends ; and I am proud to\n\nthink that an officer of my personal staff, unconnected with\n\nthe Contingent, stands by me to-day, who, after sharing the\n\nbattles and hardships of Sir Herbert Steward's march\n\nthrough the desert, went up with Sir Charles Wilson to the\n\ngates of Khartoum.\n\nI congratulate yon, General Richardson, on having been\n\npresented with the Companionship of the Order of the\n\nBath — the first officer in any of the military forces of the\n\ncolony who has ever -won this distinction.\n\nSoldiers of the Contingent, I have had the honor, as the\n\nrepresentative of her Most Gracious Majesty, to\n\npresent to each of you the medal which you have\n\nwon by your service to your Queen and country.\n\nNo honor which our Sovereign can bestow upon\n\na subject is greater than that which expresses\n\nat the same time the gratitude of the nation and the\n\nheroism of the recipient. In whatever paths of life you,\n\nwho today are decorated with this distinction, may here\n\nafter walk, however high or humble your station or em\n\nployment, you will be always entitled to the reverence and\n\nsympathy of every man who respects courage, loves his\n\ncountry, and honors his Queen.\n\nAfter some hearty cheering the whole force on the\n\nground marched past in the following order : — The\n\nGeneral Staff, the Contingent, the Permanent Artil\n\nlery portion leading-, the Sydney Lancers, the Illa\n\nwarra. Light Horse, the Camden Light Horse, the\n\nPermanent Artillery, the Volunteer Artillery, the\n\nTorpedo Corps, the Enginners, the Newington Cadet\n\nCorps, 1st Regiment Volunteer Infantry, 2nd Begi\n\nment Volunteer Infantry, the Reserve Corps, the\n\nVolunteer Naval Infantry, and the Naval Brigade.\n\nThe march past was not so steady as it might have\n\nbeen, but this may to some extent be accounted for\n\nby the fact that many of the men had probably been"
