        "text": "MARIO SCELBA\n\nThe Iron Sicilian\n\nThere are many factors that determined the outbreak of the Second Italian Civil War in 1948. First, Italy had suffered greatly during the Second World War. Much of its cities and infrastructure had been reduced to ruins, and entire families had been torn apart by the first civil war.\n\nFrance's annexation of the Aosta Valley had only strengthened the communist and neo-fascist groups active in the country, both eager to exploit national humiliation and popular anger to control the government.\n\nFinally, Italy had had the misfortune of having Mario Scelba as the new Prime Minister. Yet, at the time of his rise to power there was much hope in the young politician.\n\nScelba had been Alcide De Gasperi's right-hand man for years, becoming one of the founders of the Christian Democrats, and many considered him a hero for his support to various opposition groups, active during the Fascist government.\n\nFor this reason, Scelba was unanimously elected new leader of the DC after De Gasperi had been executed by the fascists in 1943.\n\nIn the first three years of his government, Scelba achieved many important results , including the abolition of the Savoyard monarchy and the full reintegration of the peninsula into the western political and diplomatic world.\n\nFurthermore, in the immediate post-war period, the new Prime Minister initiated both the slow and inexorable regrowth of the Italian economy, and the first reconstruction works.\n\nAfter more than twenty years of fascist dictatorship and two years of civil war, it therefore seemed that the worst was over for Italy. Unfortunately, this peace was only apparent.\n\nDespite the efforts of Rome and the Allies to stabilize the political situation, Italy was still deeply divided. Many communist partisans had simply refused to lay down their weapons, forming various paramilitary groups hostile to the government, and some right-wing political groups still wanted to restore the old fascist regime.\n\nScelba's flaw that worsened the situation to the point of no return was the very reason he was appointed head of the DC: his staunch opposition to communism. The young Prime Minister was apparently obsessed with the idea that the PCI and its allies represented a serious threat to Italy.\n\nFor this reason, Scelba had tried to exclude the PCI from the first National Liberation Committee, and had expelled Togliatti's party from the government in 1946.\n\nHis paranoia, however, only increased after the expulsion of Palmiro Togliatti and other leftist politicians. The outbreak of civil wars in China and Greece convinced the Prime Minister that all leftist parties had as their sole objective the overthrow of the established order and the creation of a dictatorship similar to the fascist one.\n\nIn Scelba's eyes, every single problem that that afflicted Italy was Togliatti's fault. Strikes by workers in the industrial regions and by peasants in the South, the formation of neo-fascist groups, and even the economic problems of the First Republic were part of the communist plan to discredit his government.\n\nFor this reason, Scelba sought to strengthen security inside the Italian republic. Under his rule, not only were the funds and the number of recruits destined for the police force increased, but many suspected communists and socialists were also dismissed outright from political institutions and the army.\n\nScelba's anti-communist paranoia was so strong that between 1947 and 1948 the Prime Minister prevented any investigation into the attacks by criminal groups against strikers and trade unionists active in South Italy. Scelba probably had no connection to these attacks, but he feared that admitting the political reasons behind these acts of violence would have increased the popularity of the PCI.\n\nParadoxically, it was precisely the measures adopted by Scelba that weakened his government and strengthened his political opponents. Scelba's inability or refusal to stop the violence against trade unionists and peasants in the South seriously compromised the popularity of the DC, to such an extent that some areas of southern Italy abandoned the party in favor of the PCI, the PSI or the new Front National of Giorgio Almirante and Alfredo Covelli.\n\nMany of the expelled soldiers became part of the various left-wing or right-wing paramilitary groups, active in the peninsula after the war. The open hostility of the government against anyone considered a leftist subversive also prompted Pietro Nenni and Giuseppe Saragat to ally with Togliatti to form the Fronte Nazionale Popolare (Popular Democratic Front).\n\nNot only did Scelba's paranoia unite all of his left-wing opponents, but it also irreversibly divided the DC. In 1947, Giovanni Gronchi and a fairly large number of parliamentarians abandoned the DC to found Democrazia Popolare (Popular Democracy), stating that Scelba’s anti-comunist obsession was destroying the legacy of De Gasperi.\n\nInternal tension reached its peak during the 1948 election. Togliatti and his allies were convinced that Scelba wanted to kill them, the Prime Minister feared that the Vatican too had been infiltrated by the communists, and Almirante accused both groups of being dangerous spies in the employ of Moscow and/or Washington.\n\nThe poll results were of particular concern to Scelba. While the DC was still the leading party in the South, much of Central and Northern Italy had started to prefer the DP and the FNP. Worse, even in South Italy the DC was losing precious votes to the neo-fascists/monarchists of the FN.\n\nEven if the exact number could not be calculated, the DC was in danger of losing a large number of parliamentary seats after the election. In Scelba's eyes, the risk of an electoral victory of the National Popular Front was high.\n\nIn the end, Scelba's fears were not realized, as the DC remained the leading party in Italy. Unfortunately, Scelba also discovered that his party no longer had the number of seats in the Senate and Chamber needed to govern.\n\nIndeed, none of the parties had won the number of seats required for the formation of a government. Less than two years after the birth of the First Republic, Italy was facing its first constitutional crisis.\n\nAlmost as a prelude to the subsequent conflict, the period between April and June 1948 is commonly known as \"The Months of Lead\", due to the massive violence that engulfed Italian cities.\n\nIn these two months, Italy found itself without a government, while Scelba and Togliatti both tried to convince the DP, now the third party in Italy, to ally with the DC or the FNP. At the same time, supporters of the DC and the FNP clashed with each other and with the police in the streets of the peninsula.\n\nIn the end, Togliatti became both the latest casualty of the Months of Lead and the first victim of the new civil war. On 14 July 1948 Antonio Pallante, a supporter of the overthrown monarchy, shot and killed the leader of the PCI.\n\nHow this assassination led to the outbreak of a new civil war depends on which version of events one decides to believe. According to the PCI and its allies, Togliatti's body was still warm as Scelba imposed martial law and ordered the arrest of the FNP leadership.\n\nOn the contrary, Scelba's supporters claim that the leaders of the FNP had already fled to Bologna well before Scelba knew of Togliatti's death. According to this version, Scelba would have imposed a state of emergency only because the FNP had declared war on his government, after forming the Second National Liberation Committee.\n\nIn any case, the Second Civil War became inevitable on July 4, 1948, when the troops stationed in Emilia Romagna refused orders from Rome, and swore allegiance to the government of Bologna.\n\nIn some ways, it is striking how the conflict in Italy mirrored in many aspects the civil wars in China and Greece. In all three cases, the Nationalist government was soon forced to retreat in the face of the advancing Communists/Socialists, due to its internal divisions and poor training of its troops.\n\nThe DP's decision to join the FNP in January 1949 determined the victory of Bologna. After this event, the main industrial cities of Northern Italy, including Milan, Trieste and Venice, fell into the hands of the SCLN.\n\nDespite the huge economic and military aid from NATO, Scelba's troops thus ended up clashing with a better armed and organized army.\n\nRome was abandoned by Scelba and his government on 23 May 1951 and Naples, the last capital of the First Republic in mainland Italy, fell after three days of intense fighting on 10 September of the following year.\n\nScelba was ,however, far from any fight at the time. The Prime Minister had loaded what was left of his government onto a plane bound for his native Sicily two days before the start of the siege.\n\nSince most of the Italian fleet had sunk or sided with his government, Scelba counted on turning Sicily and Sardinia into safe havens from which to plan an eventual reconquest of mainland Italy.\n\nScelba's latest plan was only half successful: although the two islands still host the government of the First Italian Republic, Scelba never arrived in Sicily.\n\nIndeed, his plane exploded somewhere over the Strait of Messina about an hour after takeoff, killing all the passengers. It is still unclear whether it was a simple accident or whether Scelba was killed by his enemies or former allies.\n\nIn any case, his death had no particular consequences on the conclusion of the civil war. Even if Bologna had no way to invade Sicily and Sardinia, the military government, that had suceeded Scelba, could not in any way reverse the tide of the conflict.\n\nThanks to the mediation of the Yugoslav and French governments, a sort of ceasefire was signed by both sides in early 1953. As in China and Greece, the country's mainland came under the total control of the communist forces and their allies. Instead, the government that had opposed them had to take refuge on an island, under the constant protection of NATO.\n\nAlthough neither Bologna nor Cagliari were willing to diplomatically recognize each other's rule, both were forced to accept this new status quo as they could not continue fighting.\n\nThus began a new era of the history of Italy.\n\nGIUSEPPE DI VITTORIO\n\nThe Trade Unionist\n\nAccording to legend, Beria was executed in 1949 because Stalin was convinced that the NKVD file on Giuseppe Di Vittorio had been falsified. Although this story is clearly false, it confirms in any case the atypicity of Di Vittorio compared to the other members of the PCI.\n\nTo begin with, Di Vittorio did not come from a working-class family in the North, but from a family of Apulian labourers. Despite being one of the founding members of the PCI, De Vittorio also did not share Togliatti's admiration for Stalin at all.\n\nDuring the fascist dictatorship, in fact, Di Vittorio had refused to follow Togliatti and the rest of the PCI in exile in Moscow, preferring to stay in Paris. During his stay in France, Di Vittorio had proposed for the first time the creation of a common front between the socialists and the communists, breaking away from the official position of the Comintern.\n\nDi Vittorio's political rise began thanks to the Nazi invasion of France. In 1941, Vicky authorities arrested the Italian exile and deported him to Italy, where he was sentenced to more than twenty years in prison for his opposition to the fascist regime and support for Republicans during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nBarely three years later, the fascist regime had been overthrown, Di Vittorio was free and the First Civil War had begun. The new conflict thus led to the rebirth of the CGIL in 1944, when Di Vittorio persuaded the communist, socialist and Catholic trade unionists to create a common front against the Salo regime.\n\nParadoxically, the return of democracy in Italy made Vittorio even more combative and distrustful of the government in Rome. Elected parliamentarian in 1946, Di Vittorio became famous for his frequent interventions in Parliament against Scelba's anti-leftist rhetoric, and his apparent indifference to the violence and poverty in South Italy.\n\nThe chaos of those years greatly increased Di Vittorio's political influence. The CGIL became the largest trade union in Italy, responsible for the numerous strikes that blocked the peninsula between 1946 and 1948.\n\nDi Vittorio's real fortune was being in Bologna during the assassination of Togliatti. When the news of the death of the PCI leader spread, his collaborators and other FNP leaders were more concerned with escaping from Rome than reacting to what happened.\n\nUnlike them, Di Vittorio was safe in the city, which many considered the inofficial capital of Italian communism. On the evening of June 14, 1948, the communist channels of the Italian radio started broadcasting Di Vittorio’s first speech in favor of the armed insurrection against Scelba.\n\nWhen Saragat, Pietro Secchia and the other members of the FNP arrived in Bologna a few days later, Di Vittorio had already established the Second National Liberation Committee, and appointed the first commanders of the new Italian People's Army. At that point, his election as the new leader of the FNP was inevitable.\n\nAccording to Italian propaganda, his skills as a mediator were fundamental in securing the victory of Bologna. It was Di Vittorio who persuaded the DP to side with the SCLN, and the contacts of the CGIL allowed the various armed insurrections, which conquered much of Northern Italy between 1949 and 1950.\n\nOn September 10, 1952, what remained of the army of the First Republic either surrendered, or hurried to flee to Sicily and Sardinia. After four years of war, most of the EPI and Central Italy were loyal more to Di Vittorio than to the rest of the FNP.\n\nDi Vittorio was then the new leader of mainland Italy. It was not a particularly enviable position at that time.\n\nThe new conflict had devastated Italy once again, destroying most of its cities, and many areas in the South were controlled by gangs of brigands. Rome was also isolated internationally, as President MacArthur and other Western leaders refused to open any diplomatic contact with the new Italian government.\n\nIn addition, many of Di Vittorio's old allies were turning against him. Many of them had learned what had happened in those years in Czechoslovakia, where the communist government had purged many of its old allies.\n\nThe socialist and DP militias had stopped collaborating with Bologna, and were ready to start a third civil war if necessary.\n\nThere was in fact strong pressure from the Soviets and the more extreme members of the PCI on Di Vittorio to get rid of “the internal enemies of the revolution”. But the leader of the CGIL surprised many, agreeing to meet the other leaders of the FNP in neutral Venice, to discuss the future of Italy.\n\nDi Vittorio, in fact, had noticed that, in addition to the Socialists and other Czechoslovak political opponents, the Soviets had eliminated any communist, not completely loyal to Moscow. If accepting a compromise with the rest of the FNP was going to save him from becoming a Russian puppet or dying under mysterious circumstances, Di Vittorio was ready to cut a deal.\n\nThe Historic Compromise of February 13, 1953 laid the foundations of the Second Italian Republic. Di Vittorio and his cabinet (now called the Politburo) were recognized as the highest political authority, but all initiatives of the new Prime Minister had to be approved by Parliament.\n\nThe model of the CGIL was then applied to the whole of mainland Italy: the socialists and the communists divided among themselves the control of the new institutions and the government of the various Italian regions. The first action of the new Parliament was to vote unanimously for the ban and dissolution of the DC in the new state.\n\nDespite the particular political structure and seemingly neutral name, it quickly became clear that the Second Republic was a communist country. The first Plan of the Five Years envisaged, in fact, the almost total abolition of private property in mainland Italy.\n\nThe factories and agricultural fields in each Italian region came under the control of the Regional Councils for Economic Development, whose members were chosen by the governor of the region but answered directly to the Minister of Economy.\n\nDi Vittorio also concentrated the economy of the Second Republic towards the industrialization and reclamation of many Italian territories. Convinced that Italy should have been as independent as possible, the new Prime Minister's Five-Year Plan focused mainly on certain sectors, such as wheat cultivation and weapons production.\n\nThe CGIL became an unofficial government organization. The other trade unions were banned, and every worker in Italy had to register with the CGIL if they hoped to advance their careers.\n\nOn the other hand, the Second Republic was notable for its ambiguous and difficoult relationship with the Kremlin. Di Martino distrusted the Soviets, but mainland Italy desperately needed economic aid.\n\nItaly's fate improved in April 1953 when Stalin, finally proving ha had an heart, died from a stroke. Nikolai Bulganin, eager to consolidate his new position of General Secretary as quickly as possible, agreed to help Rome only in exchange for the opening of Italian ports to the Soviet fleet, rather than Rome's accession to the Stalingrad Alliance.\n\nAnd of course the Second Republic agreed to unquestionably follow Moscow’s foreign policy. Between 1953 and 1956, Italian propaganda completely adopted both the Kremlin's anti-Western and anti-American rhetoric, and Moscow's official line regarding the purges against Bulganin's political rivals.\n\nFor this reason, Di Vittorio made a single trip outside mainland Italy during his rule. In 1955, the Prime Minister traveled to Israel, as Bulganin believed that the visit would further strengthen the new alliance between Moscow and Tel Aviv.\n\nHowever, relations between Moscow and Rome fell into crisis in 1956, following the Soviet suppression of the Bulgarian Uprising. While many communist newspapers in Europe and the rest of the world praised the Soviet military intervention, L'Unità supported in part the cause of the rioters.\n\nEven if the Italian newspaper did not support the anti-communist cause of the Bulgarian rebels, the anonymous author of the article nevertheless denounced Georgi Dimitrov's incompetence and corruption as the main cause of the uprising. In addition, Moscow’s armed intervention was criticized as contrary to Marx’s ideals, and detrimental to the stability of European communist regimes.\n\nAlthough hardly anyone read that article outside the Second Republic, the Soviet ambassador to Italy immediately requested a meeting with the Prime Minister. Neither the Soviets nor the Second Republic have any records of the conversation between Di Vittorio and the ambassador, but it certainly had no positive outcome.\n\nA few days later, Moscow suddenly announced that interest rates for loans to the Second Republic had been raised.\n\nWorse still, the Kremlin reminded the ambassador of the Second Republic that many Italian soldiers, who had participated in the invasion of Russia in 1941, were still prisoners in the Siberian gulags. Although the Kremlin had agreed to have them repatriated, the agreement could be interrupted at any time.\n\nThe 1956 diplomatic crisis was eventually won by Moscow. L’Unità retracted the article, and Enzo Tortora, its possible author, was fired.\n\nHowever, the disproportionate Soviet reaction had important consequences for the domestic policy of the Second Republic. Suddenly, a large part of the population of the peninsula shared Di Vittorio’s distrust of Moscow.\n\nIn the last year of his government, Di Vittorio began purging various Stalinists and other pro-Soviet communists from the government, and began to take an interest in foreign policy, starting to send weapons to the forces of Hossein Fatemi during the Iranian Civil War.\n\nDi Vittorio’s last political action was the signing of the Treaty of Eternal Friendship with the Republic of San Martino on 9 September 1957, recognising the independence of the city state in exchange for its continued neutrality.\n\nObviously the effects of the treaty were insignificant, but Italian propaganda still claims that it demonstrated Rome’s complete independence from Moscow.\n\nPerhaps for this reason, many conspiracy theorists believe that Di Vittorio did not die of a heart attack, but was poisoned by Moscow two months after the signing of the treaty. Obviously these conspiracy theories tend to ignore that Di Vittorio had long suffered from heart problems, and that his designated successor was even more anti-Soviet than he was.\n\nDi Vittorio is still a controversial figure both in continental Italy and abroad. His admirers praised his conduct before and after the Second Civil War, particularly his decision to preserve Italian democracy, and his social reforms, such as the legalization of abortion and divorce.\n\nHis detractors, on the contrary, consider him a common dictator. The foundation of the Ministry of Ideological Integrity caused the arrest and exclusion of many politicians and ordinary citizens, accused of having collaborated with Scelba or simply having sympathies for \"capitalist fascism\". In fact, it is not possible to justify in any way the arrest of Gronchi, the suspected death of Saragat, or the decades-long exclusion of the DP from the political life of Mainland Italy.\n\nMany, moreover, point precisely to Di Vittorio’s economic and social policies as the cause of the violence and misfortunes that struck the Second Republic in the following decade, including the tragic end of his successor.\n\nIn any case, Di Vittorio is still considered one of the most important figures of the twentieth century, whose face decorates posters and T-shirts around the world."
