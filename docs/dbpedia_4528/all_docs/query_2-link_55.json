        "text": "S Forces - What were the origins of these units? How did they operate? What was the composition of these units and how successful were they in their task? The first part of this series explained how the Germans developed their intelligence frontline collection units. This article covers how the western allies copied the German example under the name 'S Force' during their North African campaign. While some problems were identified, the system proved successful enough for the allies to continue with similar collection units in Italy and to develop this form of intelligence collection even further in preparation for the military campaign in NW Europe. During the Second World War the use of intelligence was a vital factor in the victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany. The intelligence itself was collected from a variety of sources. One of these was, of course, ULTRA-the intercepted and decrypted messages from the German ENIGMA machines. Unfortunately, when the Allies advanced through Europe they gradually lost much of the advantage gained through ULTRA, as the German forces resorted more often to the use of land-lines for their communications. The Allies had, therefore, to rely more upon intelligence gathered by their advancing forces. To obtain this intelligence they created intelligence collection units which they called S Forces in Italy and T Forces in France and Germany. As the war progressed, the role of these units altered to reflect changing priorities, with more emphasis being placed by the Allies on the acquisition not only of technical intelligence useful for gauging the Axis powers war potential, but also to discover industrial secrets which the Allies regarded as part of their legitimate war reparations.\n\nThe last of three articles on frontline intelligence gathering during WW2 in Europe. This article covers the development and use of T Forces and their evolution into FIAT. To obtain intelligence the Allies created intelligence collection units which they called S Forces in Italy and T Forces in France and Germany. As the war progressed, the role of these units altered to reflect changing priorities, with more emphasis being placed by the Allies on the acquisition not only of technical intelligence useful for gauging the Axis powers war potential, but also to discover industrial secrets which the Allies regarded as part of their legitimate war reparations T Forces were used by the Allies to secure intelligence targets for operational intelligence, counter intelligence, counter sabotage, the capture of secret weapons, securing of industrial processes and the seizure of vital raw materials.\n\nThis pdf edition of my e-book (latest revision 14.4 of August 2024 - please check p16 for details of the latest changes) looks at the creation and development of the intelligence units known as Special Counter Intelligence Units (SCIUs or SCI Units, formerly called SI(b) Units in North Africa and Italy). Created by Section V (Counter Espionage) of MI6/SIS, these units were responsible for the dissemination and usage by the Allied military of ISOS, the decrypted intelligence gained from intercepted Abwehr and Sicherheitsdienst signals. They also helped in the identification, capture, interrogation and turning of enemy agents, for deception and penetration operations against the enemy's intelligence services. This book provides the background to these sections and the involvement of other allied intelligence agencies, as well as providing various case histories. It also looks at the recruitment of Kim Philby into MI6 and later MI6(V), and the confusion in the many works describing this event. Some of the latest amendments look at the times when Philby should have been vetted by MI6; discrepancies in the stories told by Philby and his close friends; the change in attitude by MI5 regarding MI6(V); the access to ISOS allowed to various US intelligence agencies by MI6(V); the contributions made by Polish codebreakers in Vichy France and Britain; and some further details on casework in Italy. This updated edition of my original e-book includes the content of my article on \"MI6 Section V in WW2 (Revised 2020)\", and in order to include the revisions most effectively, I have changed the order of some of the e-book's original format. I have also provided some additional examples of casework, so we might see how the home section operated and co-operated with other agencies, as well as the casework of the SCI Units. I would encourage readers to contact me with any comments, criticisms and/or additional information on the e-book's contents.\n\nThe Comité International d'Information et d'Action Sociale (CIAS) was an international anti-communist network and an integral part of the organised postwar global anti-communist movement. This movement consisted of most diverse organisations. Some – weaker ones - confined their operations on the fight against communism inside their respective country's borders, others – stronger ones, as CIAS - reached further, operating on an international, continental, in singular cases even on a global level. They will be the primary issue of this paper on anti-communist networks. //// //// //// Therefore, CIAS will be presented, analysed and compared with the other two major anti-communist networks, the 亞洲人民反共聯盟 or Asian Peoples Anti-Communist League (APACL) and the Confederatión Interamericana de la Defensa del Continente (CIADC). As CIAS operated on all continents, a short overview on most of its European and non-European operations will be given. Furthermore, as this paper deals with CIAS's operations during 'peaceful coexistence' and 'détente', it will focus on the timeframe between 1957 and 1965, a period in which cadres of the West German anti-communist organisation Volksbund für Frieden und Freiheit (VFF) dominated the network. Therefore, the question in how far the West German cadres were able to influence the networks development and policy will be an issue as well.\n\nUnconventional crises have gained the upper hand in today's international security environment. The numbers of Special Operations Forces (SOF) that most Western militaries have at their disposal do deal with these types of crises are limited, therefore increasingly regular troops are used to fill the gap. This article applies theory on differentiation and integration to offer an organizational perspective on the security and safety risks of the new reality of converging military task domains. History has shown that the misuse of conventional or unconventional forces may result in failing security strategies and, at the same time, may seriously jeopardize the lives of the soldiers actively involved in a mission. The article makes clear that establishing integrating units, taking a middle position between SOF and regular forces, could be beneficial. Yet, real progress depends on two additional measures. First, countries need to improve their strategic-political knowledge base on the ins and outs of unconventional warfare through liaison positions and standing committees, in order to task the proper military units for deployment. Second, specialized training programs and facilities have to be developed to serve as an organizational coordination mechanisms to better incorporate basic unconventional warfare practices into the operational repertoire of a large proportion of regular forces."
