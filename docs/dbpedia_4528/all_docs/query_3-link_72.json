        "text": "Politics is one of the most crucial aspects of human civilization and it has been a tool to control human life and society since time immemorial. The statecraft a statesman employs in governing a state is a delicate tool and should be used wisely. A nation’s economy, society, politics and the rest are largely dependent on the statecraft employed in governing the state. This research paper is an analysis of one such statecraft envisioned by the Italian diplomat and political thinker Niccolò Machiavelli.\n\nThis revisionist paper seeks to place the controversial but popular Machiavellism in its historical perspective. Based on a careful reading of his writings, most importantly, his Il Principe, this study reassesses the implicit and explicit connotation of his arguments in his counsel to the rulers. Far from being a notorious upholder of the principle “means justifying ends” the author of this infamous booklet emerges as genuine nationalist and a supporter of a strong, pragmatic, and cautious but shrewd ruler who is neither a heedless militant and avaricious predator against his neighbors nor an upholder of dysfunctional morality and nonviolence. Standing squarely between his medieval forbears and the leading thinkers of the Early Renaissance, Niccolò Machiavelli appears as one of the most influential heralds of modern political thought.\n\nThis paper suggests that the trajectory that Machiavelli's concept of the state took by later political thinkers, active in reshaping the character of the political order they were working with, fundamentally shaped and altered the direction of the political development of Early Modern Europe. Looking at how later thinkers used Machiavelli's concept and reframed it in their given political traditions and contexts often leads to how the concept evolved over time. This paper argues that there was a clear arch of how Machiavelli's concept of the state was reformulated and repackaged by key legal and political thinkers such as Gentili, Bodin, Grotius, and finally Hobbes. Their reformation of Machiavelli's state fundamentally altered the concept radically from what Machiavelli coined as an outcome of the given prince's new modes and orders to Hobbes's depersonalized Leviathan.\n\nThis article examines Machiavelli’s image of humanity. It argues against the prevailing views that characterize it either as pessimistic or optimistic and defends the thesis that the Florentine has a realist image of humanity. Machiavelli is a psychological egoist who conceives of man as a being whose actions are motivated by his drives, appetites, and passions, which lead him often to immoral behavior. Man’s main drives are “ambition” (ambizione) and “avarice” (avarizia). This article also investigates Machiavelli’s concept of nature and shows that, for him, the constancy of human nature is the central premise that makes the scientific analysis of politics possible. Despite the fact that human drives and capabilities are the same at all times, good laws, military training, and religion allow man to be changed and educated toward “virtue” (virtù). To make such changes in man, however, presupposes a good legal and political order. Machiavelli justifies the state because of its capacity to reshape human nature and to improve man. The state is not only a coercive power but a moral institution. This leads to the conclusion that Machiavelli does not separate politics from morality as most scholars claim.\n\nThe Italian city-state system occupies a special place in the canon of orthodox international relations. For, as Martin Wight says, ‘it was among the Italian powers that feudal relationships first disappeared and the efficient, self-sufficient secular state was evolved, and the Italian powers invented the diplomatic system’. And of course this was not all they invented. In addition to the earliest modern discourse of Realpolitik (‘Machiavelli’, Carr tells us, ‘is the first important political realist’), it is in the Italian city-states that we find the first routine use of double-entry book-keeping, of publicly traded state debt, of marine insurance, of sophisticated instruments of credit (such as the bill of exchange), of commercial and banking firms coordinating branch activity across the continent, and so on. Here, too, the citizen militias gave way earliest to the mercenary armies that would later characterize European Absolutism; and within the town walls, a population given ov...\n\nConfusion verging on chaos aptly describes Italian politics between any two points in time. That being said, the amount of outright violence, political backstabbing and social upheaval Machiavelli had to put up with - as a successful bureaucrat and diplomat first (1498-1512), and later as a disgraced citizen (1512-27) is, with few if any exceptions, virtually unmatched in the history of Italian philosophy. At any rate, it is conspicuous enough to put him in a league of his own (among political thinkers). All the more so since, in Machiavelli's own words, his claim to originality rested on a return to the things themselves and the 'real truth' they convey through experience, as opposed to the traditional proclivity towards speculation regarding 'imaginary things', most notably by portraying fanciful characters and devising political regimes that can only exist on paper. Indeed, philosophers had long been lecturing- either in flawless syllogistic fashion or in vivid rhetorical style - both rulers and subjects on how they should behave and interact. However, they had taken little notice of how they actually go about their business. Alternatively, what does unbiased, direct observation of the present and extensive, informed reading of the past teach us about the ways of the world?\n\nThe article explains the meaning of the concept “reason of state” and charts its development between the sixteenth and the seventeenth century. Scholars have traditionally concentrated on the debate raised by Machiavelli’s acceptance of the necessity of evil and the Christian response to Machiavelli put forward by Giovanni Botero. This entry also considers the use of the concept in texts directly connected to diplomatic experience, where “reason of state” does not appear as tainted with unethical meaning. Moreover, the entry establishes direct connections between the concept of “reason of state” and those of “political prudence” and “interest of state.” Following transformation of the concept of “interest,” this became the ethical alternative to “reason of state.”"
