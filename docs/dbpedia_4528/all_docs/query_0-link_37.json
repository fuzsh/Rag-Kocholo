These were the ‘years of lead,’ in which hundreds perished in a synthetic war in the streets of Europe. NATO commander General Lyman Lemnitzer ordered serial attacks on French president Charles de Gaulle. Sacked from the Pentagon by John F. Kennedy for rank insubordination, then exiled to Europe, Lemnitzer reaped revenge in Dallas. The secret armies forged bonds with organized crime and neo-fascists. NATO-backed coups struck down governments in Greece and Turkey; the island state of Cyprus was sundered amid bitter genocide. Urban guerrillas like the Red Brigades and Baader-Meinhof Gang were cunningly manipulated. Italy gained a deep-state government, the ultra-secret P2 pseudo-Masonic lodge founded by former Blackshirts. Swedish PM Olof Palme and Italian ex-PM Aldo Moro were assassinated. Pope John Paul II was shot by Turkish gangsters who had regular work as Gladio guns for hire. In 2009 a Gladio copy-cat outfit codenamed Ergenekon came to light in Turkey. The shootings in Norway in July 2011, and in Belgium, France and Italy in 2012, all bore the classic stripe of Gladio false-flag operations.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAuthor’s Preface\n\nIntroduction: Lambs to the Slaughter\n\nI.

He had filed a report with his superiors which openly contradicted the official narrative compiled by the British authorities to explain the 7/7 London Transport bombings. Tony Farrell’s allotted task was to assess the degree of risk posed by terrorism. Starting with a clean sheet, he worked to the electrifying conclusion that the London attacks were - in all probability - staged by the secret state. Furthermore, he dismissed the danger posed by Islamic extremists as virtually non-existent. Despite rigorous carpeting by his bosses, pleas, arm-twisting and threats, Farrell refused to budge. He was convinced the story of suicide bombers responsible for London’s day of infamy was a concoction of ‘monstrous lies.’ The sole purpose of the carnage on 7th July 2005 was to terrify the population to such an extent that the United Kingdom could be moved closer to a state of regimented tyranny.\n\nAs this book will explain, we have been here before. In the 1970s and ‘80s, the spectre of officially orchestrated terror stalked the European landscape. Gladio was the name of the Italian branch of the secret Guerrilla armies that NATO established to ‘stay behind’ in the event of a Russian invasion. Every NATO state, and some that were not, had such a secretive force. As the prospect of an attack from the East receded, so did fear of the Soviets. To preserve the myth of the Red Peril, these secret, or ‘sleeping,’ soldiers were released in a wave of synthetic violence against innocent European citizens. It lasted two decades, the years remembered by Italians as the anni di piombo - the years of lead.\n\nThe modern-day manufactured ‘war on terror’ comes from the same stable of synthetic violence. With the communist bogey exhausted, we are told of an insidious new peril in our midst: the fearful prospect of minarets and Sharia law marching across the European landscape, destroying Christian civilization. But for fear to work in a tangible form, as was discovered in the years of lead, we must have the visible impact of terror all around us. That is where we are now.\n\nNow, the author’s special thanks to those who have brought five years’ work to the printed page: foremost to my wife, Diana, for her brilliant efforts in assembling the work and her constructive aid and criticism, always when it was needed. Special words for Giulio Piovesan, for his many splendid insights, and to Jeffrey Simmons of London for his unflagging encouragement. And not least my publisher, John-Paul Leonard, unrelenting symbol of independent investigative publishing. Finally, I shall certainly miss Gordon Logan’s startling e-mails.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nLambs to the Slaughter\n\n----------\n\n‘The deep state refers to a parallel secret government, organized by the intelligence and security apparatus, financed by drugs, and engaging in illicit violence, to protect the status and interests of the military against threats from intellectuals, religious groups, and occasionally the constitutional government.’\n\n- Professor Peter Dale Scott\n\n----------\n\nAn entire post-war generation grew up in Europe and North America in the shadow of a war that seemed never to end. The spy novels that date from this period of perpetual uncertainty, notably John le Carré’s fantastically rich plots, gave rise to its own counter-culture. Why were we fighting this enormous game of shadow boxing on our respective sides of the Iron Curtain? Le Carré wrote about strange men of the shadows - often rather sad individuals hatched in the English public school system - essentially unhinged freaks, which is very largely the nature of spies. The James Bond movies, freely adapted from Ian Fleming’s novels, turned the Great Game to hot pursuit conducted in the name of cherchez la femme. In retrospect they now seem enormously silly. One could not even describe it as an intelligence war to gain an accurate picture of the other side’s capabilities. At a time in the ‘60s when the Soviets were supposed to possess a massive missile superiority over the United States, we now know that they had exactly four rockets, of doubtful range.\n\nWhen Nikita Khrushchev made his epic foray to the United States in 1959 for the famous summit with President Richard Nixon, he flew in a largely unproven new model of Tupolev long distance jet. It took off on an educated guess by the flight crew that it carried sufficient fuel to complete the flight. The manufacturers and the Politburo held so much faith in this magnificent example of Soviet enterprise that a line of trawlers stretched across the Atlantic, to fish the General Secretary and his companions from the icy waters should anything go amiss. The Russians were bluffing. This was the essence of the Cold War. The two potential combatants, the Soviets and the western camp led by the United States, used up a great deal of bellicose language, but kept their swords sheathed. If there had never been such a thing as the Cold War, we might have been spared Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. And, for that matter Leonid Brezhnev and the bumbling clown Nikita Khrushchev.\n\nWe were told that we were ‘fighting’ for the ultimate truths and freedoms represented by western democracy. If we at any moment dropped our guard, then the Soviet menace, coiled and ready to spring, would strike. Only the ceaseless vigilance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation spared us from the monstrous and tyrannical Soviet Empire. It was taken for granted by millions that the atomic mushroom cloud was tinged a bright hue of red.\n\nBut there is a quite different version.\n\nAt the peak of Cold War paranoia in the late 1960s, NATO unsheathed its weapons on the very people it was chartered to protect. The sole motive was the preservation of a massive war machine, which in a world governed by common sense, would have gone to the scrapheap: the very essence of swords beaten into ploughshares. Instead, NATO lurched into a guerrilla war against ordinary Europeans going about their daily lives, a psychological campaign of brutal, synthetic violence. Europeans were terrorised by NATO’s secret soldiers and their underworld allies. This is the story of Gladio, NATO’s secret army that really did go to war in Europe. The battle cry was the enemy within, the phantom Red Menace gnawing at the entrails of the western democratic system. The Alliance for Peace and Progress became a distorted and cruel reflection of its high and lofty constitution. The NATO axis of domestic terror hinged on the military-industrial complex controlled by the Pentagon, the cultivated revival of neofascism, and hired hands drawn from the Mafia criminal underworld.\n\nDuring World War Two, the Allies prepared for the possibility of a German victory by creating so-called ‘stay behind’ guerrilla warfare units. They were intended to menace enemy supply routes in each of the occupied countries, working with local partisans to blow up bridges and generally harass troop movements. The challenge called for highly trained volunteers, skilled in handling explosives and accustomed to living rough among the local populations. Their tasks would extend to espionage and reconnaissance conducted in tricky and dangerous environments. The model was the British Special Operations Executive, or SOE, a top-secret guerrilla-commando force established in 1940. It was the brainchild of Winston Churchill, who characteristically issued the command ‘set Europe ablaze!’\n\nChurchill seems to have copied the idea from the Dutch-speaking Afrikaner rebels known as the Boers, who were fighting the British in South Africa at the close of the 19th century. The young Churchill reported on the war for London newspapers, and came away very impressed by the Boers’ highly successful hit-and-run sabotage tactics. These succeeded brilliantly in tying down the much larger but cumbersome and slow-moving British occupation forces. Only a few select insiders knew that the SOE units existed, but those who did were inclined to call them ‘Churchill’s secret army.’ The name and the idea stuck, to be adopted in due course by NATO.\n\nAfter the Allied victory of 1945, these units were not disbanded. On the contrary, they were strengthened and expanded in almost every European country, with the direct aid and encouragement of the United States. The task was now to deploy the same wartime guerrilla and espionage tactics against Soviet invaders. Each country had a code name for its clandestine sleeping soldiers. In Italy it was Gladio, from the two-edged sword that gladiators once carried to the Coliseum. After NATO was established in April 1949, the secret armies gradually came under the direct control of the new military alliance. NATO carefully established departments of clandestine warfare, which managed the secret armies and allocated their tasks. In each NATO country only a few close, trustworthy intimates were permitted to know of their existence. As each secret unit was eventually exposed or dragged reluctantly to the daylight, the striking generic name ‘Gladio’ came to be applied to all of them.\n\nThe possibility of a Soviet attack on Western Europe seemed real enough to warrant preparations of an extremely secretive nature. Arms dumps were scattered around each NATO country, to which the Gladiators could have recourse once war broke out. Secret lairs in caves, deep forests, cemeteries, basements of government offices, freight yards of country railway stations, or abandoned fortifications dating from WW2, were filled with abundant supplies of munitions and explosives, including in some instances chemical weapons. The anticipated invasion failed to materialise, but the enormous infrastructure created to nourish and support the secret armies was now seen as another kind of investment for the future. This was expressly political. Gladio was to turn against the people. Banking on herd behaviour, the orchestrators hoped the resulting panic and revulsion would send voters flocking to the welcoming arms of safe Right-wing governments. The Alliance for Peace and Progress was now enmeshed with forces of darkness.\n\nMimicking vintage anarchist techniques lifted, virtually intact, from the 19th century, and copied by the secret warfare arm of NATO, bands of secret soldiers and their cohorts were ordered to shoot, bomb, maim and kill their own citizens. It was the new age of the scapegoat. The United States forbade any sovereign European state to seat communist ministers in government. All movements of the Left fell under suspicion as cloaks for Moscow - even the milk-and-water British socialist variety. In Turkey, bizarrely, the logic was wrenched inside out. Secular movements in thrall to Kemal Atatürk’s long shadow joined with the army, both driven by imaginary fears in a struggle to prevent resurgent Islamic forces from seizing a keystone of the Alliance. Turkey’s dirty war on its own people cost some 5,600 lives, one prime minister his head and the destruction of the few struggling shoots of democracy in that unpromising climate.\n\nUnfortunate Italians were selected as the main brunt of a campaign of deadly violence that stretched over the better part of two decades. They shudder when they recall the ‘years of lead’ - the anni di piombo. They remember the smoking ruins of Bologna railway station one summer day in 1980. On the morning of 2nd August, 85 Italians eagerly setting off for their annual vacations were blown up by a huge bomb placed in the main station waiting room. It was air-conditioned, unusually for Italy, and crowded in the heat; which the perpetrators callously calculated would maximize casualties. Two hundred passengers and railway staff were injured. A train waiting to depart was completely wrecked, and a large part of the station collapsed. A pair of English sweethearts fresh with graduate laurels was among the victims. The government rushed to claim the device was planted by the Brigate Rosse - the Red Brigades, Italy’s legendary band of self-proclaimed urban revolutionaries. Almost within hours, the truth emerged, subsequently confirmed by the courts. The atrocity at Bologna was conceived in the bowels of the Italian Deep State, in short by the Italian government itself. The attack was carried out by secret intelligence services with the aid of their associates in the murky world of resurgent Italian neofascism - and the secret army code-named Gladio. Giuseppe Valerio Fioravanti, a former child actor in the Italian cinema, was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the outrage. Fioravanti was among the founders of the neofascist Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (NAR), which could be traced to a series of terrorist attacks.\n\nBologna was intended to convince Italians their country was under siege by sinister revolutionary forces working in their midst, acting on instructions from Moscow. Francesco Cossiga, the Right-wing Christian Democrat premier who so hurriedly denounced the Red Brigades, was in a rather compromising position. Cossiga was among the godfathers at the founding of the Gladio secret army in Italy. Later he was himself among the commanders of Gladio, as Minister of the Interior, embracing public order, the police and security. In that position, he had known for many years of the secret state’s links with violent terrorist organisations, including NAR. Just over two years earlier, in May 1978, Cossiga was among the council of Christian Democrat elders who coldly sentenced their kidnapped former colleague, ex-premier Aldo Moro, to death. Moro was another victim of the black-on-red war of deceptions. This gentle and conciliatory figure died because he was the father of the ‘historic compromise,’ his long gestating plan to bring the communists in from the Italian political wilderness. The project ran full counter to the NATO imperial mission. So he was seized and murdered by a criminal gang acting on secret orders from the highest levels in the Italian state. This conflict of interest studded the connections between Italian neofascism and the so-called respectable Christian Democrats throughout the anni di piombo.[1]\n\nOn 18th October 1980, two months after the Bologna station bombing, Cossiga resigned. He was replaced by the weak caretaker premier Arnaldo Forlani, another member of the Christian Democrat hierarchy who knew precisely where real responsibility lay for the massacre.\n\nThere was another name invented by strategists for this fabricated looking-glass war, which went on for nearly two decades against imaginary Soviet infiltrators. It was the ‘Strategy of Tension.’ Italy was the home of the largest and most powerful communist party to be found anywhere in Europe.[2] The United States entertained nightmares that communists might win power in a country deemed an essential rampart of European defences against the Soviet Union. The communist party was thus to be destroyed and along with it, much of the fabric of frail Italian democracy. The stunted sapling which is modern Italy today is a notional, weakened apology for a democratic nation. In such a climate the Bilderberg/ Trilateral Commission/ EU coup of November 2011 was accomplished with ease. For Italians, this is their legacy from the years of lead.\n\nThe sound of bullets, screams, the whumpf of great explosions, shattering glass, the scream of emergency vehicles, fell cross Europe. Bombs planted in a prominent city bank, in railway stations and trains, and in beer tents overflowing with jolly drinkers. Snipers fired at will into squares heaving with crowds of peaceful demonstrators, or supermarkets as weekend shoppers queued to pay for their groceries. A slaughter of the innocents. To meet its own political ends, the United States fostered the mirage of communist subversion of the European continent. In so doing it worked through the CIA and secret war departments of every NATO country, and ruthlessly milked and nourished latent forces of fascism left over from WW2. The extreme Right once more flooded the European mainstream political spectrum, corroding and polluting existing structures and cultures. In time, the slipstream sucked in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which became dependencies of NATO, the emerging global military colossus.\n\nA military pact ostensibly grounded on the principle of common deterrence, but turning instead to aggressive belligerence, was foreseen with astonishing clarity by the American political and social visionary James Burnham. His seminal work The Struggle for the World appeared in 1947. In this he glimpsed an American empire exercising ‘decisive world control,’ and a US-sponsored European Federation, with the Marshall Plan as the warm-up act. The English-speaking powers and the Euro federation would eventually fuse as a Universal State, with the United States occupying the central role of ‘semi-barbarian, unifying power.’ For easy consumption the arrangement would be sugar-coated as ‘the policy of democratic world order,’ an early insight of the emerging mercantile-military globalism we recognise all around us today. Burnham viewed this splendid project favourably. His pulse quickened at the sound of war drums. He imagined a planetary NATO, the prospect of ‘winged soldiers, air cavalry, able to raid two thousand miles behind the lines tonight and be gone before the defence arrives tomorrow.’ In short, the promised land of perpetual war.(N1)\n\nBurnham grass-hoppered across the American political landscape, from his friendship with Leon Trotsky, thence to his own brand of American Marxism, a brief sabbatical as a mild anti-war socialist, before he flowered as a full-blown neocon. He was an important source of inspiration for George Orwell and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell, fearing the stain of plagiarism, characteristically wrote a sarcastic essay denouncing him. Burnham is the true godfather of war ad infinitum and the American imperium rex. He deserves to be a revered icon in the annals of the North Atlantic Council.\n\nThe Strategy of Tension functioned at three basic levels. The guerrilla war fought in the streets formed a classic demonstration of synthetic terrorism. It was intended to stiffen loyalties in those countries considered at the greatest risk of falling under the sway of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe second level, the political front, involved NATO-inspired conspiracies to evict democratically elected governments and replace them with more pliable puppet regimes. Two governments were toppled in this fashion in Turkey. Greeks awoke one bright spring morning in 1967 to find the cradle of democracy under the heel of a trio of sadistic junior army officers. They seized power using a NATO blueprint code-named Prometheus, designed to forestall a communist take-over. All the officers were members of the local Gladio offshoot called Sheepskin. Thus Fascism was replanted on European soil, even as it wilted in Spain and Portugal. Cyprus was forcibly ruptured as a unitary state, at the price of bitter ethnic pogroms between Turkish and Greek Cypriots. NATO planners convinced themselves that Archbishop Makarios, the island state’s deeply conservative priest-president, was the emerging Castro of the Mediterranean. In Italy, an aristocratic wartime naval hero, famous for his exploits with midget submarines and daring frogmen, staged an abortive Gladio-sponsored coup just before Christmas 1970. A second putsch was scheduled for 1981, betrayed when all the secret plans were suddenly exposed at the last moment. The plotters belonged to Italy’s parallel clandestine government, a quasi-Masonic lodge called Propaganda Due (infamously recorded in history as P2). The grand master of P2 was Licio Gelli, a serial conspirator and prominent acolyte of Benito Mussolini, the pre-war Italian dictator. His sole aim was the restoration of Italian fascism. To this end he assembled a host of Italy’s senior politicians, businessmen, journalists, military and police officers, born-again fascists and creatures from the criminal underworld. This virtual alternative state formed an integral part of the Gladio structure.\n\nThe third level required assassination of figures deemed obstructive to NATO’s aims. Thus high political leaders were culled: in Italy, ex-premier Aldo Moro, and in Sweden the prime minister Olof Palme. We later examine their fates in detail. In Turkey, the briefly reigning Adnan Menderes was lynched by the military high command on 17th September 1961, together with two cabinet colleagues. The executions followed a NATO and US-supported putsch. Menderes was thought to be flirting with a more Islamist form of republic, but we encounter radically different explanations in a moment.\n\nThe venerable Greek politician Georgios Papandreou (Sr.), who had the temerity to stand up to the bullying of President Lyndon Johnson over US plans to dismember Cyprus, was all but assassinated. Imprisoned under house arrest by the military junta in 1967, he was denied some of the essential life-supporting medicines necessary for his heart condition. President Charles de Gaulle of France was the target of repeated assassination attempts by renegade secret army guerrillas and their criminal cohorts acting on NATO orders. In revenge, the furious general ordered the alliance to close down its central command headquarters located near Paris, and then to quit French soil entirely. De Gaulle restored full sovereignty over French forces to the government in Paris. Effectively, France abandoned NATO. The Cypriot president Mikhail Makarios III had a narrow escape from Gladio units who invaded the island in 1974 with orders to kill him. The attack on Pope John Paul II in May 1981 was an audacious example of false-flag tactics designed to divert attention from an intended fascist putsch in Rome. The failed shooting offered the added bonus of doubling as a perfect opportunity to discredit the Soviet Union.\n\nOther political weapons were extraordinarily sophisticated. In the UK of the mid 1970s, MI5, working in close affiliation with NATO and the CIA, achieved the ‘soft assassination’ of the moderate socialist prime minister, Harold Wilson. He was the target of destabilisation techniques on the specious grounds that he was in secret league with the Kremlin (See chapter XI: Frolics in the Forest: A Very British Coup). In this very odd interlude of British history, extreme Right-wing forces came close to staging a coup d’état. A senior member of the Royal Family, Earl Mountbatten, was sounded out by the plotters, but failed to take the bait. (This strange business, and the circumstances of Mountbatten’s death at the hands of Irish Republican terrorists, is explored in Chapter XX, The Strange Tale of Two Earls.)\n\nFollowing Wilson’s abrupt fall on 16th March 1976, British big business allied with agents provocateurs - planted in the trades unions by the secret services - to invoke the infamous 1978-79 ‘Winter of Discontent.’ Garbage choked the streets, practically every public service spluttered out. Britons were invited to see that their main enemy was the very socialism that had given them the National Health Service, medicines that everyone could afford, and free education for all - the full panoply of the cradle-to-the-grave welfare state. This final sabotage of the Labour government culminated in the election victory which catapulted the dependable US ally Margaret Thatcher to power. Her first actions sacrificed the long-standing cross-party commitments to welfarism in favour of the rising gods of the free market, privatization and crude competition in all forms of public services. Her famous stock market ‘Big Bang’ deregulation exercise in 1986 introduced the corrosive forces of rampant corporatism at the expense of old fashioned, outmoded manufacturing. People who actually make things, as distinct from providing so-called services, became a redundant species. The ruined landscape lies exposed for all to see in Britain today.\n\nIn Belgium, paedophiles linked to espionage services and the country’s secret deep state were enlisted to undermine the state and blackmail prominent citizens. The techniques and the gross depravity of the abuse suggest an overhang from the CIA’s horrific mind-bending experiments known as the MK-Ultra program, conducted in the 1960s and ‘70s.\n\nCopycat violence and murders marked the rash of Marxist urban guerrillas who appeared in Germany, Italy, Turkey and Greece. These were branded as Soviet-manipulated Fifth Columns, burrowing away at the foundations of democracy. A crop of radical subversive movements - led by disgruntled intellectuals, students and other disaffected members of the young post-war generation - began to express angry frustration with soulless and exploitative capitalist militarism. In the United States the outcome was Bob Dylan and Flower Power; in Europe, the ‘armed struggle.’ Today we remember these times through names such as Germany’s legendary Baader-Meinhof Red Army Faction, Britain’s anarcho-Marxist Angry Brigades and Italy’s Red Brigades. In Greece the terrorist band November 17 was to remain in business, so to speak, for almost 30 years, a peculiar story of eluding detection in such a small country. This was only possible with full sanction at the highest levels of the Greek state (see Chapter VIII). N17 took its name from an especially infamous date in Greek history. On that day in 1973, twenty-four demonstrators were gunned down when military police panicked during an anti-Junta demonstration at the Athens Polytechnic. The band were gleefully dubbed the ‘false teeth guerrillas’ by the Greek media when the ringleaders were finally rounded up, or more plausibly offered up for sacrifice, as the new century began.\n\nA common stripe ran through all the urban revolutionary forces that arose in Europe. They were riddled with double agents planted by the secret intelligence services to provoke takeaway terror to order.\n\nThe architect of these tactics was an elusive and extremely dangerous Frenchman called Yves Guérin-Sérac. In a black sense, the man was a genius. A small and wiry figure, he was a decorated veteran of the French colonial wars in Indo-China and Algeria. He was in thrall to his personal vision of a Christian-Fascist New World Order. He was also the intellectual mentor of Gladio terrorism. He wrote the basic training and propaganda manuals which can be fairly described as the Gladio order of battle. He devised the ‘steering’ of urban revolutionaries by planting interlopers. These could in turn incite acts of terror. They could also uncover plots that were then ‘just allowed to happen.’ When we analyse all the European terrorism committed during the Cold War, it appears that many atrocities were in fact intercepted by the authorities well in advance. They sat on their hands and looked the other way. In the subsequent disorder, they appeared as statues of calm. The bullet and the bomb were foremost intended to destroy the existing political order and fix the blame on the communists. Here is an extract describing the strategy, picked out in Guérin-Sérac’s typically cold, emotionless prose.\n\n\"Two forms of terrorism can provoke such a situation [breakdown of the state]: blind terrorism (committing massacres indiscriminately which cause a large number of victims), and selective terrorism (eliminate chosen persons)...\n\nThis destruction of the state must be carried out under the cover of ‘communist activities.’ Popular opinion must be polarized... that we are the only instrument capable of saving the nation.\"\n\nBut from whom precisely? There was no popular will for a communist uprising anywhere in Europe, least of all in devoutly Catholic Italy. Guérin-Sérac understood that perfectly well. Despite its well-organised communist mass, Italy was out of bounds to a Leftish revolution. His real target was the western liberal and tolerant model of democracy. Thus new meaning is bestowed on the old proverb warning that supping with the devil calls for a long spoon. Stefano Delle Chiaie, a prominent Italian neofascist and close confederate of Guérin-Sérac, admitted that all his acts were foremost intended to destabilise the liberal state. He mentioned very little about the communists. All the prominent European dictators of the 20th century - Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, Spain’s General Francisco Franco and António de Oliveira Salazar of Portugal - made the extinction of the vacuous, bourgeois state their leading priority.\n\nThe communists had become an increasingly vexing problem in Italy. They were deploying their increasing strength to demand a position in the mainstream consensus. In a wider sense, beyond Italy, this was known as the period of ‘Euro-communism,’ summarised as defanged communism with a smiling face. The charismatic young Italian communist leader, Enrico Berlinguer, offended Moscow by striking out independently with a new European brand of modern, updated communism. Berlinguer was a child of two momentous events that shook the communist world, the Hungarian Revolution in the autumn of 1956 and the Prague Spring twelve years later. The brutal crushing of popular uprisings in both countries by troops drawn from NATO’s alter ego, the Warsaw Pact, seared the spirit of the essentially humanist communist cause all over Europe. Berlinguer’s response was to invoke the phrase that later became such a favourite with British politicians of the Right: namely, ‘back to basics.’\n\nTo the NATO command’s entire satisfaction, the Italian Communist Party was ultimately destroyed by Guérin-Sérac’s classic infiltration ruse. As we noted, the kidnap and murder of the former Italian premier Aldo Moro in 1978 was attributed to the urban Marxist guerrillas calling themselves the Brigate Rosse. His death clearly belonged with Guérin-Sérac’s dictum of ‘selective terrorism (eliminate chosen persons).’ Portrayed as allied to the Brigate Rosse, the communist party never recovered. But the prize was even greater in transforming the culture of Italian politics. The burgeoning spirit of Eurocommunism, the banner flown by Enrico Berlinguer, perished with Aldo Moro. Here was one resounding victory for the Strategy of Tension.\n\nThe lesson that we learn is this. NATO’s commitment to post-war Europe did not include the preservation and nourishment of genuinely deep-rooted democracy, despite all the cross-my-heart pretensions of that nature. After WW2, the United States industrially harvested unreconstructed fascists in Germany, Belgium, Italy, France, Austria, Greece and Turkey. This was part of the imperial mission to join Europe and the United States in a combination of global power. In such a picture, ‘bourgeois liberal democracy’ - in Europe, the United States, or anywhere else - is a hindrance that has no place whatsoever.\n\nThe Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes was hanged on the orders of a military kangaroo court in 1961, because he threatened to choke the highly profitable contraband trails passing through Turkey. These were in part controlled and organised by the CIA and their confederates in the Turkish Mafia, the powerful army high command, the rogue Turkish state secret service MIT, and violent Far Right mercenaries. Menderes’ counterfeit leanings to an Islamic republic were a confection manufactured by US intelligence. The murder of Olof Palme, the Swedish premier, in Stockholm on 28th February 1986, was only peripherally connected to the theme of anti-communism. Often described as the ‘Swedish JFK,’ Palme was cut down because he obstructed US geopolitical interests. These notably featured the Iran-Iraq war. The US at first promoted the war, then took positions on both sides. Palme was the UN umpire trying to stop this pointless bloodshed. He compounded his sins by his firm attachment to the cause of Palestinian sovereignty. His star pupil, Social Democrat premier-in-waiting Anna Lindh, was savagely murdered in a Stockholm supermarket on 11th September 2003. She had also adopted the Palestinian cause, and openly turned against the US-inspired war on terror.\n\nThroughout these pages we shall read of the intricate involvement of the Vatican with the machinations of Gladio, organised crime and resurgent neofascism. The extraordinary events that led up to the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II on 13th May 1981 belong to this category (St. Petersgate, Chapter XII). One of the memorable episodes dating from this time is the image of Roberto Calvi, the suave Italian financier known as God’s Banker, dangling from a noose beneath Blackfriars Bridge across the River Thames in London. The Vatican’s internal bank, the Institute of Religious Works (Istituto per le Opere di Religione, IOR) had been effectively hi-jacked by criminal interests holding strong affinities with the Italian and American Mafia, the Italian secret state and the Gladio sleeping soldiers. This was to cost Calvi his life in a spectactular fashion.\n\nMichele Sindona was the brains behind the Sicilian-born Carlo Gambino’s US money laundering networks, and a leading figure in P2 as well. He wormed his way into virtual control of the Vatican’s secretive heavenly bank, thanks to the unworldly Pope Paul VI, who sincerely believed this son of a Sicilian farm hand was some kind of gifted accountant. In terms of purely down-to-earth practicalities, the IOR was the perfect priest-hole to conceal the profits of the contraband industry. After the usual cut for himself and the Holy Father’s good works, Sindona, the wizard working the levers behind the curtain, used these sacred chutes to shuttle millions of dollars to fund death squads propping up venal US-backed Latino dictators. Their brave exploits in the Argentine ‘Dirty War’ of the mid 1970s included the so-called ‘shrimp cocktail,’ the grim description of naked, semi-drugged victims hurled to their deaths from helicopters flapping over gray Atlantic waves. The last comforting words victims often heard were murmured by chaplains of a messianic sect of Christian Fascists, known to inspire some of Gladio’s high princes of terrorism (notably the Frenchman Yves Guérin-Sérac), incanting the virtues of ‘sorting the wheat from the chaff.’\n\nThe Vatican State was in the thick of laundering money pouring from all directions: the Sicilian-American Mafia, mysterious shelf companies hiding the illegal activities of secret services, powerful mainstream banks with deeds to conceal - with the proceeds calmly skimmed by Pope John Paul II. The Vatican’s profit, so to speak, lubricated his sacred duty of buying the freedom of East European Catholics, most prominently those in his own Polish homeland. This is the extraordinary story of the Vatican, the Kremlin and the Red Gold, which appears for the first time in these pages. It is no exaggeration to state that the Holy See has always been a holy ghost within the structure of NATO, even to the extent of hosting its own Gladio unit, drawn from the Swiss Guard, the Pontiff’s personal protection squad, and the private Vatican police. From a miniature kingdom only three times or so larger than New York’s Grand Central Station, the Pope of the day exercises temporal authority on the scale of a great power. One crowned head of the CIA, Bill Colby, famously remarked that the global intelligence services maintained by the Vatican left his own modest efforts entirely in the shade.\n\nThe attempt on the Pope’s life was promoted by western intelligence as a headline-grabbing KGB-Bulgarian conspiracy, for which there was not one shred of hard supporting evidence. Mehmet Ali Ağca, the gunman convicted of shooting the Pope, was a well-known Turkish criminal connected to Gladio and the CIA’s narcotics chains. Behind the scenes nearly all the key players in the St. Petersgate drama were drawn from the Turkish Mafia, with the exception of two prominent figures associated with known CIA assassination programmes. Both were in Rome that day. Ağca’s companion in St. Peter’s Square was Abdullah Çatlı, a senior Turkish gangster holding an official 007 licence to kill. He travelled on a diplomatic passport, containing a note that he was allowed to carry guns. Both Ağca and Çatlı belonged to the Gray Wolves, a Right-wing paramilitary organisation, known for fits of wild howling when they gathered en masse. The Gray Wolves formed an essential element of the Turkish Gladio structure known as Counter-Guerrilla. The German investigative writer Jürgen Roth has stated that killers such as Çatlı and Ağca were allowed to roam Europe without hindrance by the authorities, whatever the pretensions of Interpol to the contrary.\n\nÇatlı’s fabulous career as gangster, mercenary, government agent provocateur and Gladio contract killer came to a sudden end on 3rd November 1996, in what became known as the Susurluk Incident. He died in a car crash in the undistinguished small town of that name in western Anatolia. The Mercedes he was driving in some haste smashed into the back of a heavy truck. He died instantly, along with his girl friend, an attractive fashion mannequin called Gonca Us. A third body pulled from the wreckage was that of Hüseyin Kocadağ, the former deputy chief of the Istanbul gendarmerie. He was also closely connected to Counter-Guerrilla, the Turkish Gladio, and frequently given ultra-secret assignments for the special operations department of the national police force. Sedat Bucak, a powerful Kurdish clan leader, whose men were armed by the state to fight against separatist violence, survived with little more than a broken leg and a fractured skull. As investigators got to work, it emerged that Çatlı possessed a clutch of eight national identity cards, each with a different alias. These included documents made out in the name of Mehmet Ozkay, the same alias that Mehmet Ali Ağca often used on his travels. He also held two Turkish diplomatic passports which had been approved by none other than the interior minister Mehmet Agar, who was also a high True Path party official. One of these stated that he was permitted to travel while carrying firearms.\n\nThe Susurluk Incident struck Turkey with all the force of Watergate in Richard Nixon’s America. It brought to light for the first time the existence of a deep state organisation with links to organised crime, the police and secret intelligence services and the NATO Gladio organisation. The lady prime minister, Tansu Çiller, resigned but she expressed no regrets that her government had been caught out consorting with subversive forces. The secret state closed ranks. No prosecutions followed from the ensuing investigation, for one very good reason. Between them the dead and injured at Susurluk represented the ‘Mafia-Gladio’ coalition responsible for waging a dirty war on the minority Kurdish nationalist community. This is one of the oldest running sores in the history of modern Turkey, and from present events we see that the Kurdish struggle for self-determination is far from resolved, to this day. What Susurluk told the world was that many so-called Kurdish attacks on prominent symbols of the Turkish state were in fact performed by the Mafia-Gladio alliance, on the orders of the derin devlet (deep state). In short, false-flag synthetic violence. But the real explosive force behind Susurluk was the revelation that Çatlı was a long-time contract killer, reporting to the highest offices of the state. Small surprise then that one of the most infamous gunmen in the Gladio story received a send-off with such pomp and circumstance it might have been a full-blown state funeral.[3]\n\nThe Susurluk affair also served to expose the wiring of the narcotics chains winding across Turkey and the many hands vigorously competing for a piece of the action. The scramble included, in no particular order, the CIA, the Turkish state intelligence agency MIT, the Gray Wolves, the Counter-Guerrilla Gladio outfit, Kurdish secessionists, the national and border police, and the Mafia of course - not to mention the government itself, which was short of revenues after the loss of export markets in the Iran-Iraq war. Yet there was plenty for all - the racket was said to be worth £3 millions an hour. One of these trails wound its way through the secretive Soviet bloc state of Bulgaria, with the full knowledge and complicity of western intelligence at the highest levels. The role of the hugely criminalised Bulgarian state as effectively a fiefdom of Gladio and side actor in the Strategy of Tension is revealed, for the first time, in Chapter IX.\n\nThe appointment of the much-decorated General Lyman Lemnitzer as supreme commander of all NATO forces in Europe in 1963 brought one of the US Army’s most committed enthusiasts for black warfare into the highest seat of power within the Alliance. The Pentagonian chief of staff had recently been rudely sacked and effectively exiled by President John F. Kennedy, on justifiable grounds of rank insubordination. With Lemnitzer’s arrival, gli anni di piombo erupted with a vengeance. Lemnitzer’s colossal ego had permitted him to coldly propose a scheme to JFK calling for Mafia hoodlums to shoot Americans walking about the streets and then blame Cuban subversives (the Northwoods Plot, chapter III). A looking-glass war fought on European soil with identical methods and similar alliances came quite naturally to such a twisted mind. Lemnitzer could quietly nod when Trotsky spoke of combining all available means to meet the desired ends. In good time he reaped revenge on the man he despised as a closet communist, a president he demeaned as ‘with no military experience - some kind of patrol boat captain.’ Kennedy revealed his fatal weakness, in Lemnitzer’s arid gaze, by bowing to the Soviets in the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.\n\nLemnitzer was among the chief architects of the Strategy of Tension, and brought with him a wealth of experience gained from earlier commands in Southeast Asia. There and later in the Pentagon he was under the spell of the immensely unorthodox air force colonel (later general) Edward Lansdale. His speciality lay in bizarre voodoo-like schemes of psy-war and false-flag operations. Lansdale was likely the inspiration for the manic Northwoods conspiracy. The probability that both men were arms linked in Dallas on 22nd November 1963 is also explored in detail (again, chapter III). It was no accidental coincidence between Lemnitzer’s fascination for Lansdale’s eclectic methods and the morbid orders that went out to Gladio units under NATO command to kill innocent citizens quietly going about their lives. This was the selfsame blueprint Lemnitzer had proposed to the appalled John F. Kennedy to justify invading Cuba.\n\nLemnitzer was a seminal figure in other ways. NATO was of course a rib cut from the American Adam, an offshoot of Pentagonia, but at least until Lemnitzer’s time there was some mood of a coalition with a common righteous cause. An alliance constructed on the basis of mutual defence, drawing on the ideas of Niccolò Machiavelli concerning well-organised but non-aggressive deterrence, is not without just cause. Lemnitzer changed all that to a zealous crusade pursued in the ruthless interests of the United States. He saw no moral hazards or ambiguity because America had, after all, saved (conquered) Europe, and was thus entitled to claim rightful homage by droit du seigneur. Henceforth European states must select governments conforming to the American imperial mission, or the consequences could be painful. Lemnitzer’s poisoned chalice handed down to the current generation is an alliance without a cause, a penfold of obedient sheep who bray hosannas at every motion from the gods of war in Washington. However, as this book was preparing for press, NATO’s Libyan war raised issues with blind obedience to the imperial writ by Turkey, Italy’s Berlusconi government and peripherally, Germany.\n\nSo far we have pursued the theme which suggests that the Gladio secret armies were the main agent in manufacturing synthetic terrorism, in order to ward off the latent appeal of communism to the European masses. Thanks to Yves Guérin-Sérac, we see that NATO happily dramatised a non-existent threat of Soviet subversion. This is an opportune moment to introduce some famous words uttered by the American president, former general of the army and D-Day invasion commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Here is the legendary tablet of stone that the great national monument handed down (somewhat belatedly) to the American people on 17th January 1961, his last day in office.\n\n\"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.\"\n\nA war machine without wars to fight or even prospective enemies is a contradiction in terms. Yet these were the discomfiting circumstances in which NATO now found itself when the Berlin Wall collapsed, followed by the entire Soviet order. Shortly before his death in 1946, the great economist and new-world-order progenitor John Maynard Keynes expressed the gloomy view that post-war America might find it difficult to sustain lasting economic prosperity without maintaining a war machine in full working order. The late Professor Seymour Melman of Colombia University described the US war machine and all its components including NATO as ‘permanent war socialism.’[4] Matters had been moving in the direction of Eisenhower’s valedictory warning since 1947. In July that year, the National Security Act established a permanent military hierarchy in the form of the imperial high command - the Joint Chiefs of Staff - as an emerging parallel government. For good measure, America was blessed with its first peacetime espionage organisation, the Central Intelligence Agency. It would become the personal praetorian guard of every future president. At the stroke of his pen President Harry Truman invented the Cold War.\n\nOver time, the military-industrial-complex metastasized to the sprawling military-security-industrial-media complex that we see today, driven by the manufactured fear of Islamic terrorism. The Cold War agenda, which supposedly crumbled along with the Berlin Wall, we find resurrected in all its dreary, sterile imbecility. At the University of California, Dr. William Robinson, Professor of Sociology and Global Studies, has been thinking about the ‘hysterical global scape-goating and criminalization of Muslims,’ which at heart is precisely what the illusory war on terror is all about. He sees it as deliberately orchestrated by the emerging fascist-minded World Corporate Order composed of big business, the financial élites and the ravenous military-industrial complex. They play on escalating world tensions arising from global poverty, swelling populations and the finite limits of food, oil and minerals. In other words, the manufacture of synthetic fear, exactly like the original Gladio Strategy of Tension, refreshed and revived to drive people everywhere into submitting before a global security system, and to relentless draconian restraints on their individual lives and privacies. Professor Robinson believes forces already loosed in the US will not be easily extinguished: ‘A neofascist insurgency is quite apparent in the United States.....[America] cannot be characterized at this time as fascist. Nonetheless, all of the conditions and the processes are present and percolating, and the social and political forces behind such a project are mobilizing rapidly.’ The Canadian-born Professor Peter Dale Scott drives the stake a little harder. For him, the political system of the United States exhibits a deceivingly democratic and legal appearance on the surface, but in reality is now little different from any other dictatorial regime in the world.\n\nTake all the elements of waging perpetual war. A rash of so-called humanitarian interventions underpin and drive forward the massive capacity of the NATO/US war machine. Endless cycles of destruction and re-building, and indulgence in gratuitous waste. $20 billion a year simply to chill US army tents in Afghanistan; almost $7 billion earmarked for the ‘reconstruction’ of Iraq vanished altogether. Meanwhile public infrastructure crumbles, schools and hospitals across the US and in the UK are in decay. What is left is the Orwellian Nineteen Eighty-Four total war economy - all in the service of the criminalization of Islam described by Dr. Robinson.\n\nThe communist menace having inconveniently evaporated, the frustrated conquistadores wheeled around to attack the Balkans, unpicking the work of ages by destroying Yugoslavia, one of the few practical fruits surviving the post-WW1 Versailles peace conference. NATO’s first real war (leaving aside the shadow assault on Cyprus) was conducted without a shred of legality, since no attack had been suffered by any member state to justify invoking the kernel Article 5 solidarity clause.\n\nAs a humanitarian intervention, it fell distinctly short of advance billing. Clumsy meddling with ancient accommodations and loyalties along the fault lines of two combative world religions sparked grisly racial pogroms and genocide, which are not yet exhausted. The spectacle of NATO warplanes raining bombs on non-combatants and Chinese diplomats (eerily paralleled by the bombing of North Korea’s embassy in the Libyan campaign) trashed illusions of a sober and benign Alliance for Peace - yet this was unerringly close to James Burnham’s futuristic eye. All the characteristics of Gladio and the Strategy of Tension were laid bare once again. Chapter XIX - Appointment at Račak - displays these tactics in full play in one tragic episode in the hotly disputed enclave of Kosovo in January 1999. All through the Big Push to tame the Balkans, NATO hitched up with the mainstream corporate media to hosepipe public opinion with distorted accounts of the glorious crusade, soaked with stories of horrific atrocities performed by Serbian monsters and their cronies. For sure nobody was playing paintball in this squalid scrap. The calamities that befell former Yugoslavia and its ethnic divides guaranteed horrors on both sides. Until however a Dutch academic named Cees Wiebes came up with the incontrovertible facts in 2002, nothing was admitted on the Alliance side of calumnies performed by their imported Mujahedeen fighters. Bloodied in struggles against the Russian forces in their Afghan homeland, they were let loose by the Pentagon on the selfsame communities the NATO avenging angel was supposed to defend.\n\nThis is the inconvenient truth concerning Al Qaeda, remnant of the CIA’s made-to-measure Afghan resistance movement (its name means literally ‘The Platform’ in Arabic). Honed and hardened in the epic and ultimately victorious struggle with the Russians, these same fighters were transferred to the Balkans to tip the balance towards Muslim forces. As a strategy this was certain to guarantee friction with other NATO powers such as the Greeks, who smiled favorably on the Serbs. The presence of Afghan guerrillas and Iranian specialists and arms, with the direct connivance of the United States, defied a string of UN resolutions. The West’s hear-no-evil, see-no-evil media barons conspired to suppress the Dutch study because these revelations, coming on the heels of 9/11 twenty months before, raised serious questions concerning the casus belli of the war on terror.\n\nFor five years, Professor Cees Wiebes, of Amsterdam University and senior analyst at the Office of the National Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism (NCTB) in the Netherlands, was allowed complete freedom to mine Dutch military and secret service files. His devastating report, which he turned into a book, undermined all the arguments for sending Dutch troops to the Balkans.[5] The government instantly collapsed. In one of the few published comments to appear in the UK corporate media, Professor Richard Aldrich, the noted British expert in peace and international security studies at Warwick University, explained to Guardian readers on 22nd May 2002:\n\n\"It includes remarkable material on covert operations, signals interception, human agents and double-crossing by dozens of agencies in one of dirtiest wars of the new world disorder. Now we have the full story of the secret alliance between the Pentagon and radical Islamist groups from the Middle East designed to assist the Bosnian Muslims - some of the same groups that the Pentagon is now fighting in the war against terrorism.\"\n\nThe late Richard Holbrooke - Washington’s chief point man in the Balkans - described these accommodations as a ‘necessary pact with the devil.’ Subsequently despatched as US special envoy to the Afghan snake pit, it seems the devil may have followed hot on his footsteps. Reports speak of curious material shipments reaching Taliban insurgents, designed to prolong the conflict and justify a long-term NATO stake in the country. The finger of suspicion points to so-called security contractors, including one owned by the Afghan president’s warlord brother, who were paid tens of millions of dollars by NATO and the CIA to escort convoys of essential supplies to the troops. When they are not busily bribing Taliban commanders, or selling them fuel and other supplies, favoured pastimes include staging fake attacks to dramatise instability, and false-flag attacks against competitors who get in their way. ‘One way or another,’ an exasperated NATO official informed a correspondent from the AllGov open source site, ‘we are funding both sides in this conflict.’ The only security element is the safe conduct of dope convoys heading for the NATO-EU principality of Kosovo, centrifugal pump for nearly all heroin reaching European streets. The chief entrepreneur is the great freedom fighter and prize Pentagonian princeling, pocket state Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi. The Balkan campaign was to find a sequel in Libya, NATO’s desert war of 2011. The alliance was compelled to admit the presence of Al Qaeda fighters in the ranks of their Libyan rebels - another convenient ‘pact with the devil.’ The Alliance abandoned all pretence of respect for formal protocols to attack Libya. There had been of course no attack by Libya on any NATO member state that would justify an action, so the ruse was adopted of yet another humanitarian intervention authorized by the UN Security Council. The original no-fly-zone patrols supposed to clear the skies of Gaddafi’s jet fighters soon gave way to a full-scale bombing campaign. The most modern state in the Arab world was bombed back to the stone age. The precedent thus established, the real business began of looting resources deemed crucial to the West: Libyan oil, the country’s massive hoard of cash and bullion and (not least in these parched desert wastes) water. It was NATO’s third war of aggression: first the Balkans, then Afghanistan, and now North Africa.\n\nDr. William Robinson dates the emergence of fascism in the United States to the militarist posture of the George H. W. Bush years, although others - including myself - prefer a steady evolutionary process that began much earlier with the creation of the CIA in 1947. From the outset, the so-called intelligence-gathering agency bore the distinctive features of a lawless, state-within-a-state mercenary organisation. The truly Gothic presidency of Richard Nixon, then Reagan’s semi-detached watch, the respective turns of Bush the Elder, Bill Clinton and then Bush Junior, witnessed the accelerating extinction of American democracy.\n\nThe same drift is evident everywhere that one looks within the Atlantic Alliance. Under Nicholas Sarkozy, France clearly owed more to Vichy’s Marshal Philippe Pétain of WW2 than Charles de Gaulle. Silvio Berlusconi and his Northern League separatist consort Umberto Bossi eventually pushed Italy to the brink - and over, into the underworld beneath the veneer of democracy. In November 2011 the globalist EU-Bilderberg-sponsored coup d’état collapsed Berlusconi’s government like a pack of cards. Psychologically, the moment was finely judged. Italians had sickened of the gaffe-prone premier’s sexual peccadilloes and bruising encounters with the courts. The incoming techno-government headed by the free-market economist Mario Monti, rector of an expensive private university in Milan, effectively suspended parliamentary rule ‘for the duration of the emergency.’ The excuse was presented that Italy’s problem of public debt had blossomed to such an extent that it threatened the euro currency. Early in January, Professor Monti himself made the rather astonishing admission that there had not been a euro crisis, and that Italy’s problems were purely ‘systemic.’ A similar coup occurred in Greece at exactly the same time. Another economist, Professor Loukas Papademos, formed a coalition government that provoked uproar by including four members of the extreme Right Popular Orthodox Rally party. Its leadership views the former Greek military junta with benign approval.\n\nBoth Monti and Papademos are loaded with New World Order credentials. Monti is associated with the Bilderberg club and chairs the European branch of the Trilateral Commission. Among his other garlands he advises the board of Goldman Sachs. The speed with which he assembled a government of technocrats suggests well-laid plans. Was it any co-incidence that Sig. Monti was an Italian representative at the Bilderberg conclave in St. Moritz in June that year? Papademos is the central banker par excellence: Boston Federal Reserve economist, Bank of Greece governor, European Central Bank vice president. He has been a Trilateral member for twelve years. Greece clung to a fragment of democracy, the pretence of politicians still pulling the levers. But the government was chosen by Papademos and decided in Brussels and Frankfurt, and along the underground corridors of the secretive Bilderberg Club, just like Italy’s.\n\nThe affairs of backwater Hungary rarely disturb the international commentariat. So it passed unnoticed that Prime Minister Viktor Orban - ‘The Great Viktator’ to his detractors - was allowed to impose full-blown press censorship and the creeping evolution of a one-party state. Orban is a glowing Bilderberg alumnus whose ruthless rape of democracy - ‘the Second Hungarian Rising’ - was timed with brute cheek to mark the start of Hungary’s six-month presidency of the European Union on 1st January 2011. He attracted the warm approval of fellow Bilderberger Herman van Rompuy, then the Belgian president of the EU governing council (who strangely resembles one of the goblin clerks in the Potterland wizard bank). Van Rompuy instantly shot off to Budapest to shake the splendid Viktator’s hand. On 1st January 2012, a new constitution came into force which effectively ended the country’s twenty year flirtation with democracy."
