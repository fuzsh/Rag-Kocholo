        "text": "Still rattled by WWII and fearful of a Soviet invasion, the CIA rolled out a top-secret operation across Europe in the 1950s at the start of the Cold War. âStay-behind networksâ of underground militia were to be secretly trained in sabotage and supplied with weapons and radios to prepare for war.\n\nâThese nets had to be coordinated with NATOâs plans, their radios had to be hooked to a future exile location, and the specialized equipment had to be secured from the CIA and secretly cached in snowy hideouts for later use,â William Colby, the CIA's former director, wrote in his autobiography Honorable Men.\n\nColby was in charge of building Scandinaviaâs stay-behind nets, a tricky operation since Sweden and Finland werenât NATO members - a position both countries would reconsider decades later after Vladimir Putin and Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Colby pushed ahead regardless. If the CIA needed to, the Agency would either go it alone or use 'unofficial' local help to avoid protests from Soviet diplomats and Scandinavians who hoped neutrality would let them slip through WWIII unharmed, he said.\n\nâI was instructed to limit access to information about what I was doing to the smallest possible coterie of the most reliable people in Washington, in NATO, and in Scandinavia,â Colby recalled.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nSabotage plans in Ukraine, the Baltics, and Britain\n\nThe CIAâs Scandinavian op was just a small part of a much bolder plan to arm thousands of resistance fighters in Europe. The wide-ranging, top-secret mission - involving NATO, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and many other countries and spy agencies - later became known as Operation Gladio after Italyâs stay-behind net was exposed. Scandinavia, it seemed, was just the start.\n\nâThe activity in Europe was just as vigorous,â Colby said. âFor example, the CIA clandestinely supported the development of an anti-Communist resistance movement in the Ukraine, and occasionally - by parachute or PT [patrol torpedo] boat - delivered agents to the Baltic countries. A major effort to break Albania out of the Curtain by stirring up a revolt against the Communist regime there was underway.â\n\nâ\n\nBritish stay-behindsâ\n\nBritain was well ahead of many countries as it had been training secret stay-behind armies since at least WWII.\n\nStill rattled by WWII and fearful of a Soviet invasion, the CIA rolled out a top-secret operation across Europe in the 1950s at the start of the Cold War. âStay-behind networksâ of underground militia were to be secretly trained in sabotage and supplied with weapons and radios to prepare for war.\n\nâThese nets had to be coordinated with NATOâs plans, their radios had to be hooked to a future exile location, and the specialized equipment had to be secured from the CIA and secretly cached in snowy hideouts for later use,â William Colby, the CIA's former director, wrote in his autobiography Honorable Men.\n\nColby was in charge of building Scandinaviaâs stay-behind nets, a tricky operation since Sweden and Finland werenât NATO members - a position both countries would reconsider decades later after Vladimir Putin and Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

Now 94, Welch recalled their secret underground bunker on the outskirts of town and plans to disrupt invaders by blowing up fuel and ammunition dumps, railways, airfields, aircraft, vehicles - anything to slow down the advance. In the event of an invasion, unit members who evaded Nazi capture had a life expectancy of two weeks, the extent of their food rations.\n\nAfter WWII, Britain trained Italian militants responsible for the Operation Gladio stay-behind nets at a UK military base and visited Italy soon afterward in 1974, according to a senior Italian military intelligence official, General Gerardo Serravalle, who testified before a parliamentary committee in Rome in 1990.\n\nDocuments shown to the committee revealed that in the 1970s British and French officials involved in the network also visited a training base in Germany which was built with US money.\n\nGovernments in exile\n\nâThe CIA envisioned the stay-behind nets operating on home turf while European governments were set up in exile with communication via radio, the Agencyâs William Colby wrote in his autobiography.\n\nSwiss spymaster Albert Bachmann illustrated how that plan might work in practice when it was discovered that he planned to move gold out of Switzerland to prepare for a Swiss government-in-exile in Ireland.\n\nDipping into government funds, Bachmann bought Corkâs 200-acre Liss Ard Estate, deeming it an ideal location for the Swiss government to operate should there be an invasion or nuclear war.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nSwiss spymaster Albert Bachmann\n\nBachmann was also in charge of Switzerlandâs Projekt-26, an illegal paramilitary program that trained a guerilla-style force who operated in 40 Swiss regions under Bachmannâs command. The Swiss militants were exposed in 1990 and described by Schweizer Illustrierte magazine as: âThe secret army of the EMD spies: 2,000 men and women, trained in planting bombs and silent killing.\"\n\nEMD stood for EidgenÃ¶ssisches MilitÃ¤rdepartement - the federal military department - and the Swiss Parliament soon set up a commission that confirmed P-26âs existence.\n\nâ\n\nOperation Gladioâs day of reckoning?\n\nVarious parliamentary inquiries were called. Outrage was expressed. Secret armies were disbanded. But was it all for public show?\n\nThe leader of Swedenâs covert army, Otto Hallberg, was arrested and charged with promoting terrorism. Hallberg predicted - quite rightly - that higher authorities would prevent any detailed investigation or court action as âno Swedish official wanted news to surface concerning the extent to which the Swedish government remained under the direct sway of the CIA and NATO,â according to Paul L. Williams' book Operation Gladio.â\n\nAn investigation into Albert Bachmannâs illegal P-26 saboteurs concluded that Switzerlandâs militias had intense ties to British agents: âIt is alarming that the British services knew more about P-26 than the Swiss government did,\" investigators wrote at the time. Bachmann went quietly however. He retired to Cork, Ireland where he ran a horse-riding school.\n\nSince then, Swiss archive records about P-26 have mysteriously vanished."
