According to him,\n\nDulles, the first chief of the CIA, worked out the original plan to build\n\nsecret anti-communist guerilla forces across Europe when he was based in\n\nSwitzerland at the end of the second world war. Dulles, Sir Stewart Menzies\n\n(SIS) and the Belgian Premier Paul Henri Spaak codified the plan in a\n\nsecret pact sometime between 1949 and 1952 under the umbrella of the\n\nClandestine Co-ordinating Committee at the Supreme Headquarters Allied\n\nPowers Europe, (SHAPE), which became Nato. \"There was a division of labour\n\nbetween the British and the US,\" he continued, \"with Britain taking\n\nresponsibility for the operation in France, Belgium, Holland, Portugal and\n\nNorway and the Americans looking after Sweden, Finland and the rest of\n\nEurope\" (Searchlight, January 1991)\n\n1951 Formation of Clandestine Planning Committee\n\n\"In 1951, said the newspaper [Die Welt], Allied intelligence agencies and\n\neach participating nation - Germany, Italy and France being among the first\n\n- agreed to set up a Committee for planning to oversee the network\"\n\n(Associated Press, 13/11/90)\n\n1955-58 CIA control of Italian secret services\n\n\"Former defence minister Paulo Taviani [told Magistrate Casson during his\n\n1990 investigation] that during his time in office (1955-1958), the Italian\n\nsecret services were bossed and financed by the boys in Via Veneto' - ie\n\nthe CIA agents in the US Embassy in the heart of Rome. (William Scobie,\n\nObserver, 18/11/90)\n\n1956 General Giovanni de Lorenzo appointed head of Sifar\n\n\"De Lorenzo was...appointed head of the secret services (Sifar) in 1956 by\n\nPresident Granchi, he stayed on as head of Sifar after he was made\n\ncommander of the carabinieri in 1962.\" (Stuart Christie, \"Stefano de\n\nChiaie\", Anarchy/Refract, 1984)\n\n1956 Formation of Gladio\n\n\"US documents declassified in the 1970's show that General Giovanni de\n\nLorenzo, the chief of Sifar (Italian Military Intelligence), joined the US\n\nin the 1950's in preparing a plan against a Communist takeover, but did not\n\ninform his own government. According to a document released by Mr\n\nAndreotti last month the CIA and Sifar sketched a plan in November 1956,\n\ncodenamed Gladio, to form a force of 1000 men capable of guerilla warfare\n\nand espionage. A training base was set-up in Sardinia and 139 weapons and\n\nammunition dumps were hidden in Northern Italy.\" (Wolfgang Achtner, Sunday\n\nIndependent, 11/11/90)\n\n\"Andreotti ... has admitted to parliament that a covert intelligence\n\nservice was set-up forty years ago, with the help of the CIA and British\n\nagents to combat Soviet subversion or aggression. Although no elected\n\nrepresentatives save Prime Ministers were told of its existence, it still\n\nexists.\" (Wolfgang Achtner, Sunday Independent, 11/11/90)\n\n\"The network, run by secret-services of Nato members, was apparently set-up\n\nin the 1950's at US instigation to create a guerrilla resistance\n\norganisation in the event of a Soviet invasion or communist takeover in\n\nNato countries.\" (John Palmer, Guardian, 10/11/90)\n\n\"General sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley, a former commander-in-chief of Nato\n\nforces in northern Europe said...that a covert intelligence service was set\n\nup in Italy with the help of British agents and the CIA - which also partly\n\nfunded it.
