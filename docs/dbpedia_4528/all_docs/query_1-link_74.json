        "text": "Stay-behind Organisations in Europe\n\nThe Cold War started immediately at the end of WWII and would last until the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989. During this period of great tension between East and West, most European countries developed an underground army of secretly trained agents that would stay-behind in the event of an invasion by the Russians. The task of the stay-behind organisations was to pass important information to the government(s) in exile and to carry out sabotage activities. For communication between the agents and their government (in exile), but also between agents themselves, it was necessary to have radio equipment that could be used for long-distance communication. The equipment had to be small so that it could easily be hidden. In many cases the equipment was stored for many years in secret storage facilities (caches), often undergound.\n\nIn the early years, morse code (CW) was used as the main operating mode, and operators had to be trained in that 'language'. Furthermore, the operator needed in-depth technical knowledge of antennas and the (complex) operation of the receivers and transmitters of the era. It will not come as a surprise that many operators were in fact radio amateurs (hams). Rumour has it that, in the 1970s, the Russians assembled longs lists of European radio hams that would be eliminated in case western Europe was invaded.\n\nBetween the start of the Cold War and the early 1980s, each European country developed its own stay-behind operation, each using a wide variety of radio equipment. In fact it is often not clear when a radio set was used for the the Diplomatic Wireless Service (DWS), for espionage activities, for Special Forces (SF), or for use by stay-behind armies. Some of the popular radio sets are listed on this page, but other spy sets may have been used for stay-behind purposes as well.\n\nThis included some non-NATO countries as well [1]. It was also decided that the equipment should no longer use morse codes but digital data signals, protected by serious cryptography. The equipment had to be fully automatic, so that it could be operated by a non-technical user.\n\nThe project was given the codename HARPOON and in late 1980, the order was granted to AEG Telefunken in Ulm (Germany). In 1985 the highly adaptive HF radio set was ready for use and the Field Station became known as the FS-5000 [6]. The complete system was designated SY-5000. In the Netherlands a secret stay-behind organisation was formed just after WWII had ended. For many years, this organisation was known as O&I (OperatiÃ«n en Inlichtingen: Operations and Intelligence). Although its name was changed a number of times, it is often called Gladio by the public.\n\nO&I was operational from 1946 right until the end in 1992 when it was dismantled by the Dutch Government. During this time, the network consisted of 100 to 200 agents that were trained in a variety of skills and were able to operate a range of clandestine radio sets. According to several investigations, the Netherlands was the only country that had a completely automonous stay-behind organisation. It was not controlled by NATO, MI6 or the CIA.\n\nMore about the Dutch stay behind organisation O&I"
