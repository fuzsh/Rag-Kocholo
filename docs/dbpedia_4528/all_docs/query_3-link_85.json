        "text": "Final Fantasy XV chapter-by-chapter lore exposition and development, part 3\n\n• Part 2 | Final Fantasy XV script menu | Part 4 • • Compiled by Glenn Morrow\n\nCHAPTER 11 – In the Dark\n\nIgnis’s resolve forces a reconciliation between Noctis and Gladiolus and restores harmony to the group. With renewed vigor, the four friends reboard the train and head for Tenebrae, home of the late Lady Lunafreya.\n\n—\n\n(first scene of chapter)\n\n[Noct and Ignis sit at a table in the dining car of the train]\n\nIgnis: Feels good to ride the rails.\n\nNoct: Sure does.\n\nIgnis: Eager to drive once we’re in Gralea?\n\nNoct: If they’ll let me.\n\nIgnis: We’re fortunate to have the Regalia at all. We owe the first secretary our thanks.\n\nNoct: She’d get more thanks if she gave us a discount.\n\nIgnis: Those transceivers are top-notch. I recall when the Hydraean raged— In the midst of the empire’s retreat, one conspicuous craft remained behind: the chancellor’s. The last thing I remember seeing was his ship, heading for the altar. I fell unconscious…and was powerless to stop him.\n\nNoct: I’m just glad you’re alive.\n\n[Noct makes a startled sound and leans into the aisle slightly to look past Ignis]\n\nIgnis: Is someone else there?\n\nNoct: Gladio—he just came back. Where did he go anyway?\n\nIgnis: On a brief reconnaissance. Something caught my ear.\n\n[Gladio walks up to their table]\n\nGladio: Hey captain, mission complete.\n\nIgnis: Splendid.\n\nNoct: So what “caught your ear”?\n\nIgnis: Rumors of longer nights.\n\nGladio: They’ve been growing longer, day by day.\n\nIgnis: There was talk of it back in Lucis, but recent days have shown an unseasonably sharp change. Should this trend continue, before long…\n\nNoct: There won’t be daylight.\n\nGladio: Well, it’s not out of the question. The empire’s already slain half of the Six. No wonder the whole world’s in disarray.\n\nNoct: I…guess.\n\nIgnis: And longer nights mean more daemons.\n\nGladio: Seen that with our own eyes.\n\nIgnis: I happened to overhear a fellow passenger discussing this very same phenomenon.\n\nGladio: So he sent yours truly to seek ’em out.\n\nNoct: Nice police work.\n\nGladio: Well, don’t wanna keep ’em waiting.\n\nIgnis: No, we don’t. Back in a moment.\n\nNoct: Sure.\n\n[Noct sits in silence for a moment looking out the window; as the train begins to pass a snowy mountain range covered in mist, Prompto comes running by, then tries to stop and slips when he realizes he’s passing Noctis]\n\nPrompto: Whoa! There you are, buddy! Did you see this? It’s unreal!\n\nNoct: Yeah. Never seen anything like it. Doesn’t make any sense.\n\n[Noct looks around the dining car and suddenly realizes that no one else is moving; everything is blanketed in grey and everyone is frozen in place; Prompto is missing; Noctis stands]\n\nNoctis: What’s going on?\n\n[Noctis suddenly hears Ardyn’s voice behind him]\n\nArdyn: It’s a real mystery.\n\n[Noct turns to find Ardyn standing in the dining car]\n\nArdyn: I’m not liking that snow cloud. Kind of gives me the chills. Like, who comes up with this stuff? I couldn’t dream something like this if I tried. It’s a wondrous world.\n\nNoctis: The hell are you doing here!?\n\n[Noctis springs to punch Ardyn in the face, but he dodges]\n\nArdyn: Whoa, what’s going on!? Easy there, buddy. Didn’t see that coming. You alright?\n\n[Noct conjures a sword and swings it at Ardyn, who steps back just out of range]\n\nNoctis: Shut up!\n\nArdyn: Be careful there! Wait—is this for real?\n\n[“Ardyn” begins to run away; Noctis pursues him into the cabin car; Ardyn runs into one of the cabins and shuts the door; Noctis jerks the door open]\n\nNoctis: Show yourself!\n\n[Suddenly, Ardyn leaves over from behind Noctis]\n\nArdyn: Uh…Noct?\n\n[Noctis swings around with his fist, hitting nothing but air; Ardyn has vanished again]\n\nNoctis: That son of a bitch…\n\n[Noctis runs to the next car, where he sees Ardyn backing away]\n\nArdyn: C’mon, Noct. You’re scaring me! Seriously, man, cut it out!\n\n[Ardyn passes to the next car, where Noctis continues to doggedly pursue him]\n\nArdyn: It’s not safe. Plus, you’re causing a scene. Quit playing around, okay?\n\n[Noctis catches up to him and conjures a sword once again, which he immediately takes swing with, attempting to bisect Ardyn horizontally]\n\nNoctis: You think this is funny!?\n\n[Ardyn ducks the blade, then quickly scrambles to his feet, and runs toward the next car]\n\nArdyn: Dude, are you seriously trying to kill me!?\n\n[Noctis follows him into the space between these two cars]\n\nNoctis: Why wouldn’t I!? I’ve got you now.\n\n[Ardyn is barely able to stand, so out of breath is he; he’s holding one hand out, trying to convince Noctis to stop]\n\nNoctis: What’re you after, following me around this whole time? It’s all YOUR fault—\n\n[Noctis puts his elbow against Ardyn’s neck and shoves him against the door to the next car]\n\nArdyn: What are you talking about? Do you really mean that, Noct?\n\n[A prompt appears to select either “Yeah” or “Maybe”]\n\n—\n\n—\n\nYeah\n\nNoctis: Of course I do! You can’t talk your way out of this!\n\nArdyn: You won’t even let me! Noct, please. Can’t we talk for a sec?\n\nNoctis: Never.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nMaybe\n\nNoctis: What—are you saying it’s not?\n\nArdyn: Yes! What good would it do me to hurt you!?\n\nNoctis: Who cares!?\n\nArdyn: Noct, please. Can’t we talk for a sec?\n\nNoctis: Never.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n[Suddenly, Noctis is thrown violently to the floor as the train’s brakes bring it to a screeching halt]\n\n[Note: The reason “Ardyn” is talking like Prompto throughout this scene is because the person Noct sees as Ardyn actually is Prompto; Ardyn is using his powers to swap appearances with Prompto, which continues into the next scene where Noctis thinks he’s now talking to Prompto but is actually speaking with Ardyn]\n\n—\n\nEusciello\n\nThe deserts of the western continent have long been littered with imperial armories and outposts. The slaying of the Glacian, however, gave birth to a paradoxical phenomenon: snow fields and sand dunes coexisting mere miles apart. Noctis and his friends would be wise to flee this treacherous terrain posthaste.\n\n—\n\n[Noct comes to on the floor with “Prompto” awakening him]\n\nPrompto: Noct! Are you okay?\n\nNoctis: No. Where’s Ardyn?\n\nPrompto: Wait—he’s here? If he is, that would explain all this weird stuff happening. I bet he’s behind the train stopping. Ignis and Gladio went up to inspect the engine room. I say the two of us go check out the rear.\n\nNoctis: Yeah.\n\n[Not runs back the way he had come while in pursuit of “Ardyn”; in the car before the cabin car, the train suddenly shakes and windows shatter all around; Noctis falls to the floor, but quickly gets back up]\n\nPrompto: Did they bomb us!? Noct, we have to protect the people!\n\n[Noctis runs onward into the cabin car, where a magitek trooper jumps through the glass and pursues several people; the civilians run past “Prompto” and Noctis]\n\nPrompto: Head to the next car!\n\nNoctis: Leave these guys to us!\n\n[Noctis destroys the magitek trooper]\n\nPrompto: So much for a safe ride. More of ’em might be on board. Let’s check the rear!\n\nNoctis: We need to get the train moving again.\n\nPrompto: I’m sure Ignis and Gladio will come up with something.\n\nNoctis: Hope so. Let’s go.\n\n[Noctis runs onward, moving through the dining car]\n\nPrompto: How bad do you think it is? Hope nobody got hurt.\n\n[Noctis continues on through another cabin car, where the glass all shatters as yet another violent shake rocks the train; when he reaches the car past the passenger car after that, he’s thrown back by an explosion that takes out the side of the car;\n\nNoctis: It blew up!\n\nPrompto: Man, the MTs can self-destruct.\n\n[A multitude of magitek troopers are visible through the twisted wreckage; they’re either firing upon the train or trying to reach it]\n\nNoctis: We can’t let them inside.\n\nPrompto: Well then! We take the fight to them!\n\nImperial shock troopers are attempting to blow up the train.\n\nTake them down before they get too close.\n\nIf the train takes too much damage, the game is over.\n\n[Noctis and Prompto head outside through the hole created when the side of the train car was blown open; visible in the distance is a massive pyramid-shaped flying fortress; many smaller imperial drop ships are emerging from the fortress and flying toward the train]\n\nPrompto: That thing’s huge! We’ve got company!\n\nNoctis: Sure do.\n\nPrompto: Let the party begin!\n\n[“Prompto” and Noctis begin dismantling the magitek troopers]\n\nNoctis: It’s us against an army…\n\nPrompto: What’re the odds we’ll win?\n\n(as the two continue fighting their way through the advancing horde)\n\nNoctis: There’s just too many of ’em.\n\nPrompto: Oh, the fun never ends!\n\n[After the two destroy a great number of the magitek troopers, a number of imperial tanks in the area begin firing on the train]\n\nPrompto: Looks like they’ve rolled out the big guns!\n\nNoctis: Prompto, stay back!\n\nAn imperial tank has also begun firing on the train.\n\nPoint-warp to the tank and destroy it before it shoots.\n\nIf the train takes too much damage, the game is over.\n\n[Noctis point-warps to one of the tanks, rips open a hatch leading to some explosive cylinders, conjures a sword, shoves it through the cylinders, then point-warps to the safety of a water tower as the tank explodes; meanwhile, the train has begun moving again; Prompto’s voice rings out]\n\nPrompto: C’mon, we’re leaving!\n\n[“Prompto” is back on board the train; Noctis point-warps to the top of the train]\n\nPrompto: Look—they’re hot on our tail! They’re gonna blow us to bits!\n\nNoctis: Not if we blow ’em up first!\n\n[Noctis takes out two more magitek troopers that had gotten on board]\n\nPrompto: How’s that now?\n\nNoctis: Shoot ’em.\n\nPrompto: Oh, now there’s an idea.\n\nImperial assault crafts have also begun firing on the train.\n\nPoint-warp to the ships and destroy them.\n\n[Noctis point-warps to the inside of one of the ships, where he begins hacking the magitek troopers to bits]\n\nNoctis: Every single one of ’em’s a bomber!\n\nOnce inside, force the shock troopers to self-destruct, or use the turret to take down the four assault crafts. If the train takes too much damage, the game is over.\n\n(after taking out the four ships carrying shock troops)\n\nNoctis: That’ll do it! Better head back down.\n\n[Down below, on top of the train, stand “Ardyn” and “Prompto,” the former holding one of the latter’s own guns on him; Prompto’s hands appear to be up; Noct point-warps down to the train near them]\n\nNoctis: Prompto!\n\n[Noct takes a swing at the gun “Ardyn” is holding, knocking it to the roof of the train, and then another swing at “Ardyn,” causing him to fall backward off the train; at this point, Noctis becomes able to see that it is Prompto who is falling; so horrified is Noctis at the realization, he doesn’t even look behind him to see Ardyn standing there, holding up one of Prompto’s guns]\n\nArdyn: How long were you in the dark?\n\n[Noctis turns to look at Ardyn but is left completely open to the blow to the back of his head that Ardyn administers with the butt of Prompto’s gun; Noct falls to the roof of the train, unconscious]\n\n—\n\nCHAPTER 12 – End of Days\n\nArdyn uses a stitch in time to switch appearances with PRompto, and tricks Noct into hurting his closest friend. Nevertheless, a king pushes ever onward, accepting the consequences, and never looking back.\n\n—\n\n[Noctis comes to, still laying on the roof of the train]\n\nNoctis: Dammit.\n\n[He pulls out his cell phone and calls Ignis]\n\nIgnis: What’s wrong?\n\nNoctis: Ignis, you’ve gotta stop this thing! Prompto fell off the train. I pushed him—I mean, Ardyn made me. I don’t know where he is, but we can’t leave him!\n\nIgnis: Stay calm, Noct. I’m as concerned for Prompto as you are, but stopping the train would endanger everyone onboard. We’d be sitting ducks for the daemons.\n\nNoctis: What do we do!?\n\nIgnis: First, we drop the passengers off at Tenebrae. We’ll be arriving shortly.\n\nNoctis: What about Prompto!?\n\nArdyn: Given the chancellor’s involvement, it’s probable he’s no longer where we left him. In any case, he may try to contact us. Let us wait and hope for now.\n\n[The train begins going through a mountain tunnel]\n\nIgnis: Can you make your way here? Gladio is with me.\n\nNoctis: Are the two of you okay at least?\n\nIgnis: Yes.\n\nNoctis: Okay, on my way. I’ll be there as soon as I take care of these stowaways!\n\n[The walls and ceiling of the tunnel are crawling with daemons, many of which begin converging on Noctis]\n\nNoctis: And things just got worse.\n\n[Noctis fights through daemon after daemon as he makes his way toward the front car of the train]\n\nNoctis: Where do they keep coming from?\n\n[Noctis reaches the front car and realizes it’s no longer broad daylight; night has begun to fall suddenly and swiftly beyond the end of the tunnel; however, the air also begins to fill with the crystals of light that accompany the appearance of a summoned god]\n\nNoctis: What!? No light at the end of the tunnel!?\n\n[Noctis takes notice of many large spider-like daemons hanging from the ceiling ahead of the train]\n\nNoctis: What in the world…?\n\n[The daemons drop onto the train, which emerges into the rapidly disappearing daylight; the train is being swarmed as it reaches Tenebrae; Fenestala Manor looms in the distance, but Noctis is about to face a potentially overwhelming horde; suddenly, Leviathan emerges from the valley below and begins unleashing its water coil copies at the daemons, knocking them loose and shattering even more windows; a water cyclone the sea god has kicked up sucks in the daemons as they are knocked off the train; having saved the train, the great serpent departs, but is at that moment Noctis realizes Fenestala Manor is burning]\n\n—\n\n[Having arrived at Tenebrae, Noct sits on the train platform along with the many other beleaguered passengers; Gladio and Ignis stand beside him; from behind Noct, he suddenly hears a familiar voice]\n\nAranea: Well, look who’s here.\n\nNoctis: Aranea. Guess we’ve got you to thank for this mess?\n\nAranea: More to it than meets the eye. You wanna know who to thank? Come with me.\n\n[Slowly, Noct gets to his feet]\n\nNoct: Can’t wait to hear this.\n\n—\n\n[Noct and his two remaining companions walk along behind Aranea toward some imperial drop ships]\n\nAranea: What did you do to your eyes?\n\nIgnis: Oh, uh… Just a flesh wound.\n\nAranea: Can you see?\n\nIgnis: I’m…afraid not.\n\nAranea: Wow. That sucks. It’s a cruel world.\n\n[Aranea suddenly stops and looks at them]\n\nAranea: Uh, wasn’t there one more of you guys?\n\nNoctis: Yeah…there was.\n\nGladiolus: We…lost track of him.\n\nAranea: Is he dead?\n\nNoct: I…I don’t know.\n\nAranea: Then quit moping, keep hoping.\n\n[Aranea resumes walking]\n\nAranea: And in the meantime, handle what’s at hand.\n\nGladiolus: So if it’s not you we thank…\n\nAranea: Thank the daemons, pawns of the imperial army.\n\nGladiolus: The army that you fight for.\n\nAranea: Fought for. My men and I are in the search and rescue business now.\n\nIgnis: You mentioned being part of the relief effort. We have a favor to ask.\n\nAranea: Ask away.\n\nIgnis: In light of what you’ve told us, we can’t allow the other passengers to continue on.\n\nAranea: Sure, leave ’em to me…but, who’s gonna drive the train?\n\nGladiolus: Now that you mention it, yeah. You know anyone?\n\nAranea: I do. In fact, I know two.\n\n[Aranea walks the trio up to two other familiar faces]\n\nAranea: Your new engineers. Biggs and Wedge. No need to worry—they can take a lickin’.\n\nBiggs: Only if we have to. What’s all this about?\n\nAranea: Driving a train. To Gralea.\n\nBiggs: That all?\n\nAranea: Well, who would you have me ask?\n\nBiggs: You got us there.\n\nWedge: We’ll do it.\n\nGladiolus: Hey, really appreciate you going out of your way.\n\nAranea: Yeah. No sweat.\n\n—\n\n(speaking with Biggs)\n\nNoctis: Hey, thanks for the lift.\n\nBiggs: We’re happy to help. Can’t say the climate will be as cooperative, though. Y’know?\n\nWedge: Right. ‘Specially the gorge.\n\nBiggs: The place is freezin’! Makes sense, what with the ice goddess’s cold corpse lyin’ around. It’s a rather long ride, so I suggest you bundle up before we ship out. By the way, I bumped into a woman from the manor, used to serve House Fleuret. Must’ve gone off looking for ya. Said she had something important to discuss.\n\nNoctis: With me? Guess I oughta find her, then.\n\n—\n\n(upon locating the woman from Tenebrae Manor whom Biggs mentioned)\n\nMaria: My word… Is that you, Prince Noctis?\n\nNoctis: Uh, yeah…have we?\n\nMaria: Oh, blessed be the Stars. Just look at what a fine young man you’ve grown into. I am Maria, a retainer in service to House Fleuret. I doubt you’ll remember me after these long years.\n\nNoctis: I…uh…can’t say I do.\n\nMaria: Don’t worry. Who I am is of little import—in light of what I wish to discuss. Lady Lunafreya risked everything to spirit the Ring of the Lucii away from the Citadel. Did she deliver it to you?\n\n[Noctis is silent for a moment]\n\nNoctis: Yeah.\n\nMaria: Stars above! My fears have been assuaged. Lord Ravus, too, will be overjoyed to hear this news.\n\nNoctis: “Ravus, too?”\n\n[Maria nods; the scene transitions to a flashback in Altissia of Lunafreya having difficulty sitting up straight in her chair due to the toll her toil is taking on her; Ravus’s hands appear on her shoulders to help right her; she’s trying to catch her breath; she opens her palm to look at the Ring of the Lucii; her hand is shaking; Ravus sees the ring and takes a step back]\n\nLunafreya: I beg of you…please…see the ring to Noctis on my behalf.\n\n[Ravus turns and takes a few steps away]\n\nLunafreya: Already…my flesh has begun to fail me.\n\nRavus: No, I cannot accept it.\n\n[Lunafreya’s expression turns to surprise, then frustration; a tear falls down her face]\n\nRavus: By your hand it must be done.\n\n[Ravus turns back to face her]\n\nRavus: To deliver the ring and inspire the king is your calling. You mustn’t fall.\n\nLunafreya: But…I lack the strength to go on…\n\n[Ravus kneels in front of her, and takes her hands into his own]\n\nRavus: Find it, Lunafreya. You have the will. Go to Noctis. Show him the truth of your heart.\n\n[The scene transitions back to the present]\n\nMaria: I understand you will go hence to the imperial capital.\n\nNoctis: Yeah.\n\nMaria: Lord Ravus has King Regis’s glaive in his safekeeping, and it was his wish to return it to you, my Prince. Though I imagine it will not be easy for you to find each other.\n\nNoctis: I’ll get it from him somehow.\n\nMaria: I pray it shall be so.\n\n—\n\n(as Noctis returns to the train platform)\n\n[A young girl comes running up to him]\n\nGirl: Prince Noctis!\n\nNoctis: Yeah?\n\nGirl: Prince Noctis, were—were you excited to marry Lady Lunafreya? Because she was really excited to marry you! She looked so excited the day her dress arrived! She really loved you, Prince Noctis.\n\nNoctis: I… Thank you.\n\n[The scene transitions to a flashback of Lunafreya talking with Gentiana in Fenestala Manor]\n\nGentiana: At first, the father had mourned the fate of his chosen son. Yet in Tenebrae, the two found solace. It was not the Oracle who assuaged their fears. But the girl…she holds…the true power.\n\nLunafreya: I have little to offer a king, other than the voice afforded the Oracle. Nevertheless…\n\n[Luna turns to look at the wedding dress]\n\nLunafreya: And—I’m afraid he might find this foolish… But…to be together with Noctis again, even if only for a short while… It…would mean the world to me.\n\n[Luna turns back to Gentiana]\n\nLunafreya: I do not seek to guide him, merely to stand beside him.\n\n[Gentiana smiles and nods; the scene transitions back to the present]\n\nGirl: Lady Lunafreya worried she was burdening you with the wedding. That’s not true, is it?\n\nNoctis: No, not at all.\n\n—\n\n(speaking to Biggs on the train platform)\n\nBiggs: Ready to depart. Just swapped out the damaged cars for some new ones. Give one of us a holler when you’re ready to shove off, then.\n\nWedge: Dining car’s open. If you need a break.\n\n—\n\n(speaking with Biggs again)\n\nBiggs: Shall we shove off, then?\n\n[A prompt appears asking “Depart for Gralea?”; the player can select either “Yes” or “No”]\n\n(if the player selects “No”)\n\nWedge: Fine. We’ll wait.\n\n(when the player selects “Yes”)\n\nWedge: Climb aboard.\n\n[The scene briefly fades to black; when it fades back in, Aranea is standing in front of Noct, Ignis and Gladio]\n\nAranea: Don’t worry about the civilians. They’re in my good hands. Can’t say the same for you. Watch yourselves in the capital.\n\nIgnis: We will.\n\nNoctis: Thanks, Aranea. We’ll see you around.\n\n[Gladio and Ignis turn and board the train; Noct turns and begins to follow, then stops, looking up as he takes notice of snow beginning to fall]\n\nNoct: It’s…snowing.\n\nGladiolus: Get your ass on board.\n\nNoctis: Yes, sir.\n\n[He, too, boards the train]\n\n—\n\nGhorovas Rift\n\nA frozen ravine where the fallen Shiva lies, a solitary railroad carved through its unforgiving snowscape. With Biggs and Wedge driving, the train makes its slow and steady way toward the imperial capital.\n\n—\n\n[The three remaining Chocobros are sitting in the dining car, Ignis and Gladio at a table, Noctis at the bar by himself; Biggs addresses them over the loudspeaker]\n\nBiggs: Oi! Uh—attention all passengers! We’re on our way to our final destination in the imperial capital. Enjoy the ride. I’ll be in touch if anything comes up.\n\n[Biggs ceases his address]\n\nGladiolus: Look at all that snow. No wonder it’s so cold in here.\n\nIgnis: We must be approaching the Glacian’s cadaver.\n\nGladiolus: Won’t be a blessing if all we got’s a body.\n\nIgnis: Let us hope we pass through the gorge without incident.\n\nGladiolus: It’s what’s after the gorge I’m worried about.\n\n[Noctis stands]\n\n[A notification appears saying “Noctis is free to roam about until the train arrives.”]\n\n—\n\n[Before long, Noctis’s cell phone rings]\n\nNoctis: Who could this be?\n\n[He answers]\n\nNoctis: Hey, what’s up?\n\n[He listens]\n\nNoctis: Okay. Thanks for letting us know.\n\n[Note by Glenn Morrow: If Noctis is in the dining car with Ignis and Gladio when the train arrives at the next story beat, he doesn’t receive the phone call]\n\n—\n\n[The locomotive begins barreling through large chunks of ice that have formed over the tracks, causing the front of the train to start icing up; the train’s brakes bring it screeching to a halt]\n\nGladiolus: I wonder what it could be this time.\n\n[Biggs addresses them over the loudspeaker once more]\n\nBiggs: Attention, eh!\n\nNoctis: Yeah?\n\nBiggs: You may have noticed we’ve stopped. As for the cause… Outside, ya think?\n\nNoctis: We’ll take a look.\n\n[Noctis begins to head outside]\n\nBiggs: Oh. Well.\n\nGladiolus: Hope it’s just a quick snow-shoveling job.\n\nIgnis: Indeed.\n\n[Gladio and Ignis follow after Noct; outside, Noct has his arms wrapped around himself]\n\nNoctis: It’s freezing!\n\nGladiolus: Better keep moving to stay warm.\n\nIgnis: The Glacian did this.\n\nNoctis: I think I can see her.\n\n[Indeed, Shiva’s lifeless face can be seen in the snow beyond the tracks]\n\nGladiolus: It’s a shame. She’s lying dead. Damn, it’s cold!\n\nNoctis: Let’s clean up out here, warm up in there.\n\nGladiolus: Better make this snappy.\n\n[Suddenly, they’re attacked by several daemons; after disposing of the creatures, Noct stands outside the train trying to catch his breath; from the doorway to get back onboard, Gladio is leaning out and calls to him]\n\nGladio: Hey, Noct! You’d better get in here. Something’s not right.\n\n[Gladio goes back inside]\n\nGladio: C’mon, Iggy.\n\n[Noctis begins to follow them inside; just as he’s about to walk up the steps to get inside, he sees Ardyn walk past him, already inside the train]\n\nNoctis: No way.\n\n[Noctis runs inside]\n\nNoct: You! Hold it! That son of a bitch.\n\n[Noct follows Ardyn into the train car where Gladiolus and Ignis were headed to find the car filled with mist and cold air]\n\nNoctis: What the hell?\n\n[Making his way into the next car, Noctis opens the door to be buffeted by snow and cold winds; he can make out Ardyn’s silhouette at the other end of the car; wrapping his arms around himself, Noctis struggles through each step to keep advancing]\n\nNoctis: Stop! Stop, dammit! Where is he? Where’s Prompto?\n\nArdyn: Oh, there you are! I’m worried about your friends. They’ve fallen and they can’t get up. Why not lend them a hand?\n\n[Noctis manages to get a few feet from Ardyn. Beyond him, Noctis can see Ignis and Gladio on the floor being covered in ice]\n\nArdyn: A coldness that can only be hers.\n\n[Noctis falls to his knees; as his vision begins to blur, he takes notice of a woman in the doorway past Ignis and Gladio; it’s Gentiana; Ardyn turns and realizes she’s there as well; his expression momentarily becomes one of surprise, then nonchalance; Gentiana begins walking toward them]\n\nArdyn: Ahh, the face you wore the day you—\n\n[Gentiana touches her pointer finger to her lips, then touches Ardyn’s lips with it, instantly turning his entire body to ice; she then walks up to Noctis]\n\nGentiana: Let it now be done…as promised to the Oracle.\n\n[Gentiana gestures widely with her arms and floats into the air before being obscured by a flash of blue and white light; as the light fades, the form of Shiva has taken Gentiana’s place]\n\n——\n\n(original version of this scene, as depicted prior to the Version 1.16 update of September 29, 2017)\n\nNoctis: Gentiana—it’s you. You’re the Glacian. Wha—\n\nGentiana: O King of Kings, restore Light unto the world.\n\n[She raises her hands and conjures Lunafreya’s trident; she hands it to Noctis; he leans forward and grasps it; the two are enveloped in another flash of light; a flashback of Lunafreya and Ravus in the field of sylleblossoms at Tenebrae is now shown; her back is to him]\n\nRavus: Sister, cease this madness. That boy will never be King.\n\nLunafreya: Noctis is chosen. It is ordained. You of all people should know.\n\nRavus: I know that you are throwing your life away!\n\n[Lunafreya turns and shouts back at her brother]\n\nLunafreya: That may be! But…it’s my choice. If only…\n\n[Lunafreya begins to cry]\n\nLunafreya: If only I could…hear his voice once more… If we could laugh together as we did as children…\n\n[She grips her hands together and continues to cry as the flashback ends, fading back to Noctis on the train in the present; Gentiana is gone, as is the blizzard that was enveloping the train car]\n\nTrident of the Oracle x 1\n\nMark of the Glacian x 1\n\n[Noctis walks up to the frozen Ardyn, conjures the Trident of the Oracle, and shatters the imperial chancellor’s frozen body with Lunafreya’s weapon]\n\nNoctis: Damn you.\n\n[Noct then loses his balance and stumbles to his downed friends]\n\nNoct: Hey. Wake up.\n\n[They begin to stir]\n\nGladiolus: The hell happened?\n\nNoctis: Yeah. I saw the Glacian. It’s okay, she’s gone now. You guys check on our drivers.\n\nGladiolus: Got it.\n\n[Gladio turns to Ignis and places his hand on his shoulder]\n\nGladiolus: You good?\n\nIgnis: Yes, I’m fine. Let’s go.\n\n[Noctis remains on the floor as they leave; after they’ve left, he begins to see the spectral image of sylleblossom petals floating past his feet; as his eyes move up, he sees first her feet, then a spectral image of Lunafreya herself]\n\nNoctis: Luna.\n\n[Noct slowly rises to his feet and reaches out to Luna; she smiles at him; just as he’s about to touch her, she vanishes; Noctis falls forward; as he sits back up, the last of the sylleblossom petals floats into his open palm; he clenches his fist around it and begins to cry]\n\nNoctis: It’s so hard. Guess it was hard for you, too. I’m sorry I couldn’t be there for you.\n\n——\n\n——\n\n(updated version of this scene, as depicted in the Version 1.16 update of September 29, 2017)\n\nNoctis: Gentiana—it’s you. You’re the Glacian.\n\nShiva: Tales of the past and hopes for the future are manifest in the King of Kings. The Frostbearer’s blessing shall be his.\n\n[A prompt asking “What should I ask her?” appears; the player can select “Ask about tales of the past,” “Ask about hopes for the future” or “Nothing”]\n\n—\n\n—\n\nAsk about tales of the past\n\n[The scene briefly fades to black, then transitions to the cover of the Cosmogony]\n\nShiva: The Six have safeguarded this star since time immemorial—each of a different mind, but united by this common purpose.\n\n[The scene transitions to an image of Shiva freezing some humans to death in a blizzard]\n\nShiva: The gods’ protection extends to all creatures here below—even to the mortals created in their image. They are feeble creatures leading fragile lives and clinging to foolish fancies. The Frostbearer scorns these visions of “hope” which melt like snow in the sun’s light.\n\n[The scene transitions to an image of Ifrit lighting a fire in front of a gathering of humans]\n\nShiva: Yet the Pyreburner admires their strength of will. For their reverence, he grants unto them his flame, and the world of man flourishes.\n\n[The scene transitions to an image of Ifrit and Shiva floating in the sky locked in a loving embrace]\n\nShiva: His benevolence warms the heart of the Frostbearer.\n\n[The scene transitions to an image of the lofty spires of a technologically advanced human settlement; an airship is flying across the sky in the image]\n\nShiva: It is not long, however, before some among those men ascend to new heights of hubris. The people of Solheim spurn the gods who blessed them—the gods they once worshipped.\n\n[The scene transitions to an image of an enraged Ifrit casting fire down upon fleeing humans]\n\nShiva: The ungrateful mortals incur the wrath of the Pyreburner. He seeks to raze the very civilization his flames once helped build.\n\n[The scene transitions back to Shiva speaking to Noctis]\n\nShiva: But the Six are sworn to defend the star and all its inhabitants from harm—and, at times, from one another.\n\n[The scene transitions to an image of the other five gods confronting Ifrit; a number of other divine entities are also present for the battle, some seemingly allied with Ifrit]\n\nShiva: The flames of war surge as Solheim fends off the Pyreburner’s fire. The gods’ pleas for peace fall on deaf ears, and the battle rages on. When the smoke clears, the world of man is in ruins, their star left scarred for time eternal. Wearied from war, the Six seek solace in slumber.\n\n[The scene fades to black as Shiva continues to speak]\n\nShiva: This tale of our shared past is entrusted to the King of Kings…\n\n[The scene fades back in on Shiva and Noctis]\n\nShiva: …that he may see it to its conclusion.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nAsk about hopes for the future\n\n[The scene briefly fades to black, then transitions to an image of Ifrit rising to his feet at the Rock of Ravatogh; parts of his body are glowing with deformity]\n\nShiva: In the days that follow the war, while the Six are still asleep, the Pyreburner is sought by a man who draws him away from the Light.\n\n[The scene transitions to an image of Shiva swarmed by imperial dreadnaughts and drop ships]\n\nShiva: His peril is sensed by the Frostbearer. She rushes to his aid, only to be felled by the foreign hordes.\n\n[The scene transitions to daemons flying over Gralea as explosions rock the city]\n\nShiva: Those masses are now one with the darkness—darkness that, before long, will swallow the Six and the star they protect.\n\n[The scene fades to black as Shiva continues to speak]\n\nShiva: This star’s fate no longer rests in the hands of the gods. It sits on the shoulders of the Chosen.\n\n[The scene fades back in on Shiva and Noctis]\n\nShiva: Deliver this world from darkness—and grant my love release.\n\nNoctis: I promise I will.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nAsk nothing\n\n[The dialogue picks up with Shiva’s next line below]\n\n—\n\n—\n\nShiva: The Oracle is no longer of this world, but her thoughts remain—and they must be known.\n\n[A prompt appears to select either “Ask about Luna’s thoughts” or “Receive her blessing”]\n\n—\n\n—\n\nAsk about Luna’s thoughts\n\n[The scene briefly fades to black, then transitions to footage from the FFXV “Dawn” trailer of five-year-old Noctis in his father’s arms]\n\nShiva: When the boy begins his existence on this star, the girl is met by the High Messenger.\n\n[The scene transitions to an image of eight-year-old Noctis and 12-year-old Luna looking at their notebook together]\n\nShiva: It is ordained that she will work with him to return the Light. The girl reaffirms that promise.\n\n[The scene transitions to an image of Gentiana conversing with 12-year-old Luna]\n\nShiva: The High Messenger is moved by the girl’s determination, her heart warmed by the girl’s benevolence. Her faith in mankind is restored once more.\n\n[A flashback of Lunafreya and Ravus in the field of sylleblossoms at Tenebrae is now shown; her back is to him]\n\nRavus: Sister, cease this madness. That boy will never be King.\n\nLunafreya: Noctis is chosen. It is ordained. You of all people should know.\n\nRavus: I know that you are throwing your life away!\n\n[Lunafreya turns and shouts back at her brother]\n\nLunafreya: That may be! But…it’s my choice. If only…\n\n[Lunafreya begins to cry]\n\nLunafreya: If only I could…hear his voice once more… If we could laugh together as we did as children…\n\n[She grips her hands together and continues to cry]\n\nLunafreya: If we could…live out our days together as we once dreamed…\n\n[Gentiana suddenly addresses her]\n\nGentiana: Wherefore does the lady weep?\n\nLunafreya: Forgive me. I vowed to only cry where prying eyes cannot see the tears in mine.\n\n[The camera pans to show Gentiana standing before Luna]\n\nGentiana: Yet others need not hide their grief. Is she so different from them?\n\n[Lunafreya shakes her head]\n\nLunafreya: No… She is no different at all. She wants exactly what they do: to be with the one she loves. But want though she may, it is not to be.\n\n[Gentiana walks up to her]\n\nGentiana: The lady’s thoughts have been heard. The love she bears the king shall never fade—and, in time, her feelings shall be known unto him.\n\n[Gentiana wipes away a tear from Luna’s left eye as she says the last few words of the previous line; Luna cries more]\n\nLunafreya: Gentiana…\n\nGentiana: And if the words are not spoken from her lips, then the Messengers shall see that they are heard. The gods’ favor and the lady’s love shall be with him evermore.\n\n[Gentiana smiles at her, then takes Luna’s hand with one of her own and places her other on Luna’s upturned palm]\n\nGentiana: Thus it is promised between the Oracle and her familiar.\n\n[Luna composes herself and takes hold of Gentiana’s hands with both of her own]\n\nLunafreya: I am undeserving of your kindness… Thank you.\n\n[Luna smiles at her; Gentiana smiles back and a single tear streaks down Gentiana’s cheek; the scene transitions back to Shiva and Noctis]\n\n—\n\n—\n\nReceive her blessing\n\n[The dialogue picks up with Shiva’s next line below]\n\n—\n\n—\n\n——\n\nShiva: And so the promise is fulfilled. As her words go with him, so shall my blessing.\n\n[She raises her hands and conjures Lunafreya’s trident; she hands it to Noctis; he leans forward and grasps it]\n\nNoctis: Yeah… Thanks.\n\nShiva: O King of Kings, restore the Light unto this world.\n\n[The two are enveloped in a flash of light; several glimpses are shown of eight-year-old Noctis and 12-year-old Lunafreya, then of her recent departure from Eos as an adult]\n\nLunafreya: Farewell, dear Noctis.\n\n[The scene fades to white for a moment before fading back to Noctis on the train in the present; Shiva is gone, as is the blizzard that was enveloping the train car; Luna’s trident is still in Noctis’s hand, but it quickly dissipates]\n\nNoctis: Luna… I’m sorry… I’m sorry I couldn’t be there for you. Not even when you needed me most.\n\n[He begins to cry]\n\nNoctis: There was so much you wanted to say. So much I wanted to say… And now I’ll never have the chance. I’m so sorry…\n\n[He then notices the sudden light emanating from spectral sylleblossom petals as they float down toward him; Noct slowly rises to his knees as his eyes move up, seeing first her feet, then a spectral image of Lunafreya herself; she smiles at him; he reaches out to touch her, but just as he’s about to, she vanishes; Noctis falls forward; the last of the sylleblossom petals floats into his open palm; he lifts himself back to his knees; he closes his hand around it, pulls his hand to his chest and begins to cry once more; in another brief flash of white, Noct briefly flashbacks to when he and Lunafreya were together as children again]\n\nNoctis: I won’t let you down.\n\nLunafreya: I know you won’t.\n\n[With another brief flash, Noct is back in the present]\n\nNoctis: Luna… You and I will be together again someday. I promise.\n\n[Noctis rises back to his feet and brushes away his tears]\n\nTrident of the Oracle x 1\n\nMark of the Glacian x 1\n\n[Noctis walks up to the frozen Ardyn, conjures the Trident of the Oracle, and shatters the imperial chancellor’s frozen body with Lunafreya’s weapon]\n\nNoctis: What’re you looking at?\n\n[Noct then loses his balance and stumbles to his downed friends]\n\nNoct: Hey. Wake up.\n\n[They begin to stir]\n\nGladiolus: The hell happened?\n\nNoctis: Yeah. I saw the Glacian. It’s okay, she’s gone now. You guys check on our drivers.\n\nGladiolus: Got it.\n\n[Gladio turns to Ignis and places his hand on his shoulder]\n\nGladiolus: You good?\n\nIgnis: Yes, I’m fine. Let’s go.\n\n[Noctis remains on the floor for a moment as they leave before the scene briefly fades to black; when it fades back in, Noct is standing once again; now back on his feet, he makes his way through the next train car, where he realizes he’s not alone; he turns to find Ardyn standing a few feet away]\n\nArdyn: I feel I’ve earned the right to call you Noct. For a moment I felt death’s chill wind, such is the might of the gods. But then, I remembered I’m immortal. Such is my blessing and curse. Your attack hurt me, nevertheless…\n\n[He suddenly scowls fiercely at Noct, and his voice becomes something of a growl]\n\nArdyn: My feelings at least.\n\n[He’s quite for a moment]\n\nArdyn: And after all the memories we’ve shared. Remember this?\n\n[Ardyn raises one of Prompto’s guns, pointing it at Noctis]\n\nArdyn: Ah, I should have asked if you remember him. Truly a blast from the past, nay?\n\n[Ardyn casually walks up to Noctis and places the side of the gun against Noctis’s chest; Noct tries to grab it, but Ardyn pulls it away and turns away]\n\nArdyn: Ah, ah, ah! You mustn’t take what’s not yours.\n\nNoctis: Where is he!?\n\nArdyn: “He”?\n\n[Ardyn turns back to face Noct]\n\nArdyn: The little gunman’s a short shot away.\n\n[Ardyn raises his finger and points]\n\nNoctis: Where?\n\nArdyn: Where else but Gralea, the seat of the empire? I’m sure he’ll be delighted to see you. And you might even find your Crystal. With all these daemons about, you could certainly use it.\n\n[Ardyn walks past Noctis, deliberately pushing past him as he does so, then comes to a stop]\n\nArdyn: Off you go, then. I wouldn’t want to keep you from your friend.\n\n[Ardyn raises his rand hand, in which he is holding a small device; he presses a button on the device with his thumb, then leaves without another word; Noctis stares after Ardyn, gritting his teeth]\n\n—\n\nCHAPTER 13 – Redemption\n\nHaving stolen Noctis’s country, Crystal, and cherished companions, Ardyn waits implacably in Gralea.\n\n—\n\n(first scene of chapter)\n\n[Noctis, Ignis and Gladio are sitting in the dining car of the train as it heads for Gralea]\n\nIgnis: We should be drawing close to Gralea.\n\nNoctis: Yeah.\n\nGladiolus: I can’t imagine what it’ll be like.\n\nNoctis: Swarming with daemons, but you knew that.\n\nGladiolus: Don’t remind me.\n\nIgnis: Once we arrive, we’ll make for the Keep.\n\nNoctis: The Keep?\n\nIgnis: Zegnautus. An imperial megafortress said to be impregnable.\n\nNoctis: With Prompto and the Crystal inside it.\n\nGladiolus: What goes in, must come out.\n\n[The three are silent for a moment]\n\nGladiolus: So, are we buying this story that the Crystal can purge daemons?\n\nIgnis: The proof is in the purging, but it does stand to reason. We’ve observed that as the nights have grown longer, the daemon hordes have grown stronger. If they are in fact averse to the Crystal’s Light, it could save not only Lucis, but the world.\n\nNoctis: We’ll find out once we take it back.\n\n[Suddenly, the train comes screeching to a halt]\n\nGladiolus: The hell?\n\nIgnis: What is it?\n\nGladiolus: My guess? Something to sidetrack us.\n\n[The three get up and move into the cabin car; as they walk past the series of large windows here, they all suddenly crack and the train car shakes]\n\nGladiolus: What now?\n\n[Biggs speaks to the three over the loudspeaker]\n\nBiggs: City’s trying to keep us out…with the daemons.\n\n[Small imp-like daemons, called snaga, begin swarming across the windows]\n\nGladiolus: Whoa-whoa.\n\n[Biggs speaks over the loudspeaker again]\n\nBiggs: Gotta run! Don’t worry about us.\n\n[One of the daemons busts through the glass and lands in front of Noctis and the others; he holds out his hand to tell Gladiolus to move back, then attempts to conjure a weapon into his hand]\n\nNoctis: Let’s get to work…\n\n[Noctis looks at his hand, confused]\n\nGladiolus: What’s wrong?\n\nNoctis: The weapons…they’re stuck!\n\nGladiolus: Get back!\n\n[Gladiolus pulls Noctis away from the now charging daemon and kicks it in the face]\n\nIgnis: Run!\n\n[As Ignis retreats, Gladio pats Noct’s shoulder]\n\nGladiolus: C’mon, move it!\n\n[The following notification appears:\n\n“Ardyn has stripped Noctis of his weapons.\n\nFlee to the freight car at the back of the train.\n\nThe ability to call Umbra is also unavailable.”]\n\n—\n\n(as the three make their way through the train, pursued by the daemons)\n\nIgnis: Only a matter of time before we run out of room to run!\n\nNoctis: Got a better idea?\n\nIgnis: We trade the train for the Regalia!\n\nGladiolus: C’mon!\n\nNoctis: On my way!\n\nIgnis: Noct! The freight car!\n\nNoctis: Keep moving!\n\n[The trio make it to the Regalia; Noct gets into the driver’s seat while Gladio gets in the passenger’s seat and Ignis in the back]\n\nNoctis: Strap in.\n\nGladiolus: Gun it!\n\n[Noct drives the Regalia out of the freight car and out onto the train tracks; an automated message then rings out]\n\nAnnouncement: Threat upgraded. Activating level 4 security measures. Sealing all gates.\n\n[The following notification appears:\n\n“The city’s defense system has begun sealing all entrances.\n\nMake it into Gralea before the gate closes!\n\nR2 Accelerate\n\nL2 Brake/Reverse”]\n\nGladio: Put the pedal to the metal!\n\nNoct: That’s the idea!\n\nGladio: Don’t crash!\n\nNoct: Thanks for the tip.\n\nIgnis: Where are we now!?\n\nNoct: inside a tunnel—on the train tracks!\n\nGladio: Don’t slow down, or they’ll catch us up!\n\nNoct: Going as fast as I can—hang on!\n\n[Noct drives the car through the tunnel and onto a tracks bridge in the city proper; as the royal retinue races down the bridge, an artillery shell suddenly strikes near the car, causing a small explosion]\n\nIgnis: What was that!?\n\nNoct: They’re trying to blow us off the tracks.\n\n[Artillery continues striking around the Regalia]\n\nGladio: One clean hit and it’s over.\n\nIgnis: It’ll take a bit more than that to stop His Majesty’s trusty steed.\n\n[The artillery strikes begin hitting their mark; an imperial drop ship can then be seen falling out of the sky]\n\nGladio: Dodging one thing to run into another.\n\nIgnis: The Regalia can take the punishment. Just focus on your driving.\n\n[More artillery strikes the Regalia; the vehicle is now on fire]\n\nNoct: You can do it, girl. You can get through this.\n\n[As the Regalia closes in on the gate, several more strikes land directly on the car]\n\nGladio: It’s closing! Floor it!\n\nNoct: C’mon, old girl…\n\n[Just as the Regalia makes it through the rapidly closing gate, another strike lands square on the royal contraption, briefly engulfing it in flame; Noct brings the car to a screeching halt on the other side of the gate near the debris of a train car that stretches across the width of the bridge, one end propped up above the tracks; the Regalia now sits sizzling on the tracks, all its windows shattered; it has taken its final run]\n\nGladio: That’s all she’s got.\n\nNoct: It’ll do.\n\n[Noct, Ignis and Gladio get out of the car and begin to walk away; Noct turns to look back at the car with a somber expression, recalling a memory from childhood of his father stepping out of the car and embracing him]\n\nNoct: Dad… Thanks for everything.\n\n[After a moment, Gladiolus speaks up]\n\nGladio: Are we seriously marching into the capital empty-handed?\n\nIgnis: And with no assurances the Crystal can beat back the daemon hordes.\n\nGladio: Guess we’ll find out the hard way. No turning back now, right?\n\n—\n\n(as the trio make their way toward the wreckage of the train car that sits propped across the bridge)\n\nGladio: This thing could come down at any time…\n\nIgnis: Let’s be quick.\n\nNoct: C’mon, this way.\n\n[Noctis makes his way under the wreckage, but before Gladio and Ignis can follow, the train car collapses, separating the latter two from their charge]\n\nNoct: Hey! Ignis! Gladio!\n\n[Ardyn begins broadcasting his voice to Noctis]\n\nArdyn: Look at you. All by your lonesome.\n\nNoctis: You again. You know, for an imperial chancellor, you are one sick son of a bitch.\n\n—\n\n(as Noct makes his way through the wreckage of another train car)\n\n[Daemons begin emerging and attempting to swarm Noctis]\n\nNoctis: Daemons…\n\n[Noct addresses Ardyn]\n\nNoctis: The hell do you want? Leave me alone! This is getting out of hand.\n\n[Noct manges to make it into a now derelict building where he stops to catch his breath; after a moment, he drops to one knee, reaches into his pocket and pulls out something clenched in his fist; he slowly opens his palm to reveal the Ring of the Lucii; Noct’s hands begin to shake as he stares at it and he grunts rapidly, as though wracked with pain; continuing to shake and grunt, he unsteadily slides the ring onto his finger, roaring in pain and his eyes briefly glowing red as he succeeds in this struggle; catching his breath once again, Noctis stares at the ring of his ancestors, flexes his hand, and rises from his knees]\n\nNoctis: The time has come.\n\n[A notification appears saying “Harbored within the Ring of the Lucii, arcana encompasses three powerful spells. The first of these is Death, which drains a foe’s life force to restore your own.”]\n\n—\n\n[A snaga falls from above, lands in front of Noctis, and comes at him]\n\nNoct: How did they get in here?\n\n—\n\n[After killing the snaga and making his forward, Noctis gets a good look at an illuminated cylindrical structure connected to the bottom of the floating Zegnautus Keep]\n\nNoct: Looks like it’s connected below. Might be my ticket to the top.\n\n—\n\n[In this area are doors Noctis can’t immediately get through]\n\n(when trying)\n\nNoctis: No go.\n\n—\n\n(alternate reaction to Noct unsuccessfully trying to open one of these doors)\n\nNoctis: Maybe another.\n\n—\n\n[Noct finds a generator in the area; activating unlocks one of the doors that wouldn’t open; a notification appears saying “Find switches to power up doors and elevators in order to continue on to Zegnautus Keep, where the Crystal is being held.”]\n\n(when trying the newly powered-up door)\n\nNoctis: Nice.\n\n—\n\n(upon locating and entering a dormitory in one of the buildings in the area)\n\n[A notification appears saying “Save manually at dormitories located throughout Gralea and Zegnautus Keep.”]\n\nNoct: Should be safe to rest here.\n\n—\n\n[While making his way across the rooftop of one of the abandoned buildings, Noct is attacked by four snaga at once, prompting the reveal of the second arcana spell; a notification appears saying “A spell of the arcana, Alterna consigns entire hordes of enemies to the void at the cost of all MP.”]\n\n—\n\n(as Noct operates a control panel that opens the door to the building containing the elevator that will allow him access to he Keep)\n\nNoctis: That’s the way to the elevator taken care of.\n\n—\n\n[As Noctis makes for the Keep, the third arcana spell makes itself known; a notification appears saying “A spell of the arcana, Holy counters with a blast of sacred light when evading, making it effective against melee enemies.”]\n\n—\n\n(as Noctis reaches the building housing the elevator leading up to Zegnautus Keep)\n\nNoctis: Dead quiet. Where did everybody go?\n\n—\n\n[When Noct approaches the elevator, its doors open, revealing more daemons]\n\nNoctis: Not these bastards again.\n\n—\n\n(upon killing the daemons and entering the elevator)\n\n[The doors close and the elevator begins to ascend toward Zegnautus Keep above]\n\nNoct: This whole city gives me the chills.\n\n—\n\n(as Noctis steps out of the elevator into Zegnautus Keep)\n\nNoct: Too quiet for comfort.\n\n[Ardyn broadcasts his voice to Noctis once again]\n\nArdyn: How does it feel to be powerless? Can’t help your friends if you can’t help yourself.\n\nNoctis: Gotta hurry and find them. Wherever they are.\n\n—\n\n(as Noct continues making his way through the halls of the Keep)\n\nArdyn: Can’t you simply taste the air of foreboding?\n\n—\n\n[When rounding one corner, Ardyn can be seen at the other end of the hall walking away from a downed magitek trooper that suddenly stands, taking a zombie-like posture]\n\nRogue axemen patrol along a set route.\n\nHiding from rogue axemen allows you to avoid conflict and recover MP.\n\nNoctis: These don’t look like typical MTs.\n\n—\n\n(upon being discovered by one of the rogue axemen)\n\nNoctis cannot operate doors and devices while the enemy is aware of his presence. End the state of conflict by taking out all hostiles or simply leaving the area.\n\nArdyn: Must be tiring, having to run all the time.\n\n—\n\n(after Noctis uses an arcana spell on a rogue axeman)\n\nArdyn: That magic is a royal disappointment.\n\n—\n\n[As Noct walks past a gated-off hallway, one of the zombie-like magitek troopers suddenly reaches through the bars and grabs him; he manages to break the MT’s group and it falls backward on the floor in a disheveled heap]\n\nNoctis: Something different about them—something off.\n\n—\n\n[Checking a lounge area, Noctis finds an empty uniform laying on the floor with a cardkey]\n\nNoctis: Missed some streaker running around here?\n\nSecurity Card x 1\n\n—\n\n[Now possessing the cardkey, Noct is able to open a door at the opposite end of the hallway leading to the lounge; while walking across the bridge this door blocked access to, Ardyn can be heard laughing]\n\nArdyn: It’s all coming along swimmingly, isn’t it?\n\n—\n\n(while navigating the halls)\n\nNoctis: Can’t afford to get spun around.\n\n—\n\n[As Noct rounds a corner after making the statement above, he sees what appears to be Prompto run down the hall in the opposite direction]\n\nNoctis: Hey, Prompto! Wait!\n\n—\n\n[In one of the Keep’s rooms, Noct finds a machine that upgrades one’s security clearance]\n\nNoctis: What have we here? “Clearance level”? Nice.\n\n(upon using the machine)\n\nCard security clearance raised to level 2.\n\n[An automated message rings out]\n\nAnnouncement: Security clearance raised to level 2. Access to level 2 zones authorized.\n\n—\n\n[Making his way down more hallways he can now access, Noct continues catching sight of what appears to be Prompto going the other way]\n\nArdyn: Poor Prompto must be feeling the heat right about now.\n\n—\n\n[Very soon after Ardyn’s comment, Noct comes to a gated-off room with what appears to be Prompto sitting slumped over in a chair inside]\n\nNoctis: Dammit! It won’t budge!\n\n—\n\n[Making his way to a nearby storage room, Noctis finds a narrow passageway leading into the room where Prompto appears to be; Noctis begins squeezing his way through; while doing so, he hears Prompto’s voice]\n\nPrompto: Noct! Help me!\n\n[Noctis makes it into the other room and is immediately beset by an uttu daemon and two rogue axemen]\n\nNoctis: Get out of my way!\n\n[After killing his attackers, Noct squeezes between some stacked crates to find “Prompto”; when he touches him, however, Ardyn’s illusion is lifted, and “Prompto” is revealed to be a dead magitek trooper, which falls out of the chair]\n\nNoct: Another trick! Back to square one…\n\n—\n\n[In the same room, Noct is able to update his security card]\n\nCard security clearance raised to level 3.\n\n[An automated message rings out]\n\nAnnouncement: Security clearance raised to level 3. Access to level 3 zones authorized.\n\n[As Noctis proceeds, Ardyn’s voice returns to taunt him once more]\n\nArdyn: That’s one of my personal favorites. You should have seen the look on your face. You’d best hurry. Next time, it might really be your friend.\n\n[Note: The audio here has Ardyn say “Oh, you should have seen the look on your face” for that line]\n\n—\n\n(as Noctis continues navigating the halls)\n\nArdyn: Are you certain it wasn’t the real thing? Wouldn’t want to make a mistake.\n\n—\n\n(as Noct comes to a locked door in another hallway)\n\nArdyn: Oh, it’s just so unfair!\n\n[Ardyn chuckles]\n\n—\n\n[Noct takes an elevator to an upper level and proceeds across a bridge leading to Zegnautus Keep’s central elevator]\n\nArdyn: Your heart’s desire, so close now. Soon it will be within your grasp. I suggest you take the central elevator. It will take you to your goal.\n\nNoctis: Aren’t you helpful now.\n\n—\n\n(while walking across a nearby catwalk to a control panel)\n\nNoctis: Don’t look down, don’t look down.\n\n—\n\n(when trying to operate the panel)\n\nYou do not have a suitable keycard.\n\nNoctis: Gotta find a way to make it move.\n\n—\n\n[Coming to two large slightly ajar blast doors, Noctis sees a cargo area on the other side; an enormous gargantuan daemon walks by within]\n\nSearch for the keycard to operate the central elevator.\n\n—\n\n[Within the cargo area, Noctis locates the Generator Keycard at a desk]\n\nNoctis: All keyed up.\n\n—\n\n[Making it back to the central elevator area, Noctis uses the Generator Keycard to restore power to the elevator; as Noctis then begins to walk back across the catwalk from the generator panel to the platform the elevator rests on, Ardyn broadcasts his voice again]\n\nArdyn: The higher you climb… …the further you fall.\n\n[A gargantua daemon suddenly lands on the platform, just beyond the end of the catwalk]\n\nNoct: The hell?\n\n[The gargantua raises its sword; Noct begins to retreat back across the catwalk, but the daemon brings its sword down, shattering the catwalk and sending Noct into the depths of the Keep]\n\n—\n\nZegnautus Keep\n\nThe height of imperial might, this flying megafortress houses the Crystal of Lucis in its uppermost level. Yet for all its imposing vastness, it appears utterly devoid of human presence.\n\n—\n\n[Noctis comes to laying on his back at the bottom of the Keep’s central shaft, surrounded by debris and the bodies of human imperial troopers; he slowly gets to his feet; as he takes a few steps, Noct comes upon Ravus’s body, unceremoniously left here at the bottom level of Zegnautus Keep; as rumored, the last of the Oracle’s bloodline is indeed deceased, his severed magitek arm still clinging to the haft of King Regis’s glaive; the blade stands impaled in the floor beside Ravus’s corpse; Noctis gazes at Luna’s brother in silent sadness; after a moment, he reaches out toward the haft of his father’s sword; at his touch, Ravus’s severed arm falls to land on the first son of Tenebrae’s chest; Noct pulls his hand back from the weapon, taking a moment to first kneel beside Ravus and look upon his face a final time; finally, Noctis stands, takes grasp of his father’s royal arm, and pulls it free]\n\nSword of the Father x 1\n\n—\n\n(when examining Ravus’s body)\n\nNoctis: Rest easy. Your work is done.\n\n—\n\n[As Noctis begins to walk out of the room across the narrow catwalk that serves as the only way out, a magitek trooper sprawled out on the floor of the catwalk rises to attack Noctis]\n\nNoct: Well Dad, let’s see what your sword can do.\n\nNoctis can now wield Regis’s sword in combat.\n\nTogether with the Ring of the Lucii, it affords him a better chance of survival while his other abilities remain sealed.\n\n[As Noctis leaves the room, Ardyn can be heard laughing]\n\n—\n\n(as Noct makes his way through the next room and into the next hallway)\n\nArdyn: Can’t you simply taste the air of foreboding?\n\n—\n\n(further down the same hallway)\n\nArdyn: Did you hear that? There’s something out there…\n\n—\n\n[Shortly after Ardyn’s ominous notice, the walls around Noctis begin spraying a green mist]\n\nNoct: What’s this smoke?\n\n[Suddenly, Noct begins coughing and falls to one knee]\n\nNoctis: Where’s it coming from?\n\n—\n\n[If Noct tries to go from here down a hallway to the right, he will begin coughing, as it is being sprayed full of the green mist]\n\nNoctis: No can do.\n\n—\n\n(making his way instead in the opposite direction down the hallway)\n\nArdyn: A-ha! Well, you can’t say I didn’t warn you.\n\n—\n\n(continuing onward)\n\nNoctis: Getting thicker by the second. Need to stop it.\n\nThe poison gas reduces Noctis’s HP.\n\nWatch his health as you search for a way to clear the air.\n\n—\n\n[Noct manages to locate a room with giant fans; operating the nearby control panel, he activates the fans, causing the poison gas to be sucked out of the area]\n\nNoct: It’s clearing… That was close.\n\n[He’s then attacked by two snaga daemons]\n\n—\n\n(after killing the daemons)\n\nArdyn: Oh, you’re such a tease.\n\n—\n\n[As Noct makes his way further, he comes to a storage room with yet another machine for updating security cards]\n\nCard security clearance raised to level 4.\n\n[An automated message rings out]\n\nAnnouncement: Security clearance raised to level 4. Access to level 4 zones authorized.\n\n—\n\n[Continuing onward, Noct fights his way through a room of several rogue axemen and shock trooper magitek troopers]\n\nArdyn: You really are helpless without your friends babysitting you.\n\n—\n\n(as Noct leaves this room and makes his way across a bridge)\n\nArdyn: I have grave doubts about your friends.\n\n—\n\n[Soon thereafter, Noctis opens the door to a room with an elevator]\n\nArdyn: Tragedy could strike at any moment.\n\n[Noct presses the button to call for the elevator; while he is waiting for it to arrive, a large bat-like daemon called “Foras” descends behind and begins attacking him]\n\nWait while the elevator descends.\n\nNoct: Whatever the hell that is, I don’t think I want to mess with it.\n\n(after surviving against Foras long enough)\n\nThe elevator has arrived.\n\nNoctis: I’ll take a rain check.\n\n[Noctis uses the opportunity to escape; however, the Foras daemon will continue stalking him through the halls of the Keep]\n\n—\n\n[As Noctis gets off the elevator and begins making his way through the next hall before him, the lights go out]\n\nNoctis: Power must’ve gone out. First keys, now power. What next?\n\n—\n\n[While Noctis navigates these dimly lit halls, Ardyn broadcasts his voice again]\n\nArdyn: What was that noise? Is it scary being on your lonesome?\n\n—\n\n[Noctis soon finds a power breaker and flips its switch, restoring some light to the area]\n\nNoct: Ain’t much, but it’s better than nothing.\n\n—\n\n[The Foras daemon begins manifesting in the halls of this area and attacking Noct]\n\nArdyn: I love surprises! Oh, you’ll fall for anything.\n\n—\n\n[Going up a staircase to another level, the lights begin to flicker]\n\nNoct: You serious!?\n\n—\n\n[Noctis must find yet another breaker, which he locates in a room with four magitek troopers resting within modules in the walls; he flips the switch, restoring some power]\n\nNoctis: Ain’t much, but it’s better than nothing.\n\n[He is then immediately attacked by two of the magitek troopers; and in the halls outside, Noct will again be beset by the Foras daemon]\n\n—\n\n[With power restored to the area, Noctis is able to take a nearby elevator up to the lab area of the Keep; as he begins making his way through the labs, Ardyn’s voice is once again broadcast to Noct]\n\nArdyn: The empire made considerable inroads into the science of daemons. Well, after I showed them the way, of course. We’d managed to make daemons…right here.\n\nNoctis: Make?\n\n—\n\n[Noct soon locates a room full of control panels and learns how to navigate this area]\n\nDifferent combinations of active circuits unlock specific sets of doors. To proceed, locate the keycard for each panel and activate the right combination.\n\n—\n\n(as Noct continues making his way through the labs, fighting magitek troopers and daemons along the way)\n\nArdyn: Ever wonder where daemons come from? Once upon a time, they were children of nature—beasts and men. Aw, and you’ve killed so many.\n\n—\n\n(as Noct continues on)\n\nArdyn: The infantry units you callously dub “MTs” all began as babes in this very facility. Imprinted with serial codes and incubated until they were strong enough to fight. What a pity. Innocent souls fated to suffer…at the hands of a foreign king. Well, not so “MT” after all, are they?\n\n—\n\n(as Noct continues progressing through the lab areas, he comes across and reads the West Gralea Quarantine Report)\n\nWest Gralea Quarantine Report\n\nIncluding cases around the village, the number of missing now stands at 1,657. Early reports from the MRF attribute the disappearance to an infectious disease, and investigations continue as regards a potential connection to the daemon outbreak. At the time of writing, the quarantining of West Gralea is complete, and other sections remain infection free.\n\nNoctis: A “vanishing sickness.” Huh.\n\n—\n\n[Within the same room as the report, Noct is attacked by several snaga daemons before he can make his way through a door into the next hallway]\n\n(after defeating the daemons and entering the hallway)\n\nArdyn: Oho! Well done, my boy.\n\n[Ardyn’s laughter echoes through the area]\n\n—\n\n(as Noct leaves the hallway and enters a lounge area)\n\nArdyn: The most fascinating tidbit about your dear Prompto…\n\nNoctis: What—?\n\nArdyn: Turns out he’s not empty either. He’s got quite the “skeleton in his closet.”\n\n—\n\n[Noct comes across and reads the Magitek Research Facility Damage Report in this lounge area]\n\nMagitek Research Facility Damage Report\n\nFollowing their outbreak in the north and west, daemons have swept through the MRF, causing extensive damage to equipment. Control was subsequently lost over unprogrammed MTs, and strategies are being deliberated on the collection of rogue units. 125 patients undergoing testing at the facility have vanished in a manner reminiscent of the first disappearances.\n\nNoctis: All the patients up and disappeared? That makes no sense.\n\n—\n\n[Noct soon locates another machine for updating security cards]\n\nCard security clearance raised to level 5.\n\n[An automated message rings out]\n\nAnnouncement: Security clearance raised to level 5. Access to level 5 zones authorized.\n\n—\n\n[Noctis is now able to enter an enormous open area with a wide, round platform at its center; a round, ornate single-room structure sits at the middle of this platform; along the walls of the large open space are countless small-paneled metal doors that make the walls resemble rows of lockers]\n\nNoctis: The hell is this place? What’re they keeping inside?\n\n[Affixed to the ceiling above the structure in the middle of the room is a large apparatus emitting red electricity]\n\nNoctis: Not sure what that is, but I got a hunch it’s bad. Don’t like it one bit.\n\n—\n\n(upon approaching the door of the structure in the center of this place)\n\nNoctis: Bet there’s something here. Which means it’s locked. And if there’s a lock, there’s a key.\n\n—\n\n[On the back of the structure, Noct finds a control panel with a switch; when he flips the switch, the platform begins rising]\n\nNoctis: Wasn’t expecting that. Things are lookin’ up.\n\n[Ardyn interjects]\n\nArdyn: How will this story end, I wonder.\n\n[An automated message rings out]\n\nAnnouncement: Intruder alert. Mobilizing dormant magitek infantry.\n\n[A swarm of magitek troopers begin leaping out of the panels along the walls]\n\nNoctis: What the—!? Wait… Is that what’s waiting inside? Even more of ’em!\n\n(as Noct battles the incoming magitek troopers, Ardyn taunts him further)\n\nArdyn: Where are your friends? You don’t think they ran off without you?\n\n[Note: the audio for this line has Ardyn pause and gasp mockingly after he says “think”]\n\nArdyn: You still haven’t found Gladio? Only a matter of time before Ignis bumbles into a trap. You must feel very much alone right now.\n\n—\n\n(after the battle, Noct follows a catwalk leading away from the central platform and locates another machine that upgrades one’s security clearance]\n\nCard security clearance raised to level 6.\n\n[An automated message rings out]\n\nAnnouncement: Security clearance raised to level 6. Access to level 6 zones authorized.\n\n[Noct is then immediately beset once more by magitek troopers]\n\n(as the battle wears on)\n\nArdyn: Your buddies have bright lives ahead of them. Don’t take it personally if they choose their own over yours.\n\n—\n\n[After defeating the second wave of magitek troopers, Noct is confronted by a wraith daemon and more magitek troopers]\n\nNoctis: No time, no time!\n\n(as the battle wears on)\n\nArdyn: Not so tough without your borrowed toys, are you?\n\n(after the battle continues a bit longer)\n\nArdyn: You really are helpless without your friends babysitting you.\n\n[After the battle continues a little while longer, Ardyn’s laughter rings out]\n\n[The imperial chancellor’s taunting continues as the battle goes on]\n\nArdyn: Where does it hurt? You can tell me.\n\n—\n\n[Once the wraith and all the magitek troopers have been destroyed, Noct is able to pass through a door into a new hallway, where Ardyn’s laughter is soon heard; from here, Noct enters a room filled with control panels; on the other side of this room is the entrance to a hallway littered with the bodies of magitek troopers]\n\n(as Noct enters the hallway)\n\nArdyn: In case there was any doubt: it’s a trap.\n\n[Translucent, electrified doors close at either end of the hallway and begin closing in on Noctis; the magitek troopers also rise and begin attacking]\n\nNoctis: Didn’t see that coming!\n\nArdyn: A little pain never hurt anyone. On you go. Hurry. While you dawdle, people are dying.\n\nNoctis: I’ve really gone and done it now.\n\n[Ignis’s voice suddenly calls out from the other end of the hallway in the direction Noct had been going]\n\nIgnis: Noct? Is that you?\n\nGladiolus: Hey! Noct! Can you hear us?\n\nNoctis: Ignis, Gladio!\n\nIgnis: Where are you?\n\n[Gladio is able to see through the doors at the other end of the hallway and take stock of Noctis’s situation; the doors have almost finished closing in on him now]\n\nGladiolus: Noct’s in trouble!\n\nIgnis: Gladio! There ought to be a kill switch nearby—find it!\n\nGladiolus: How do you know that?\n\nIgnis: I believe it’s the reason we were brought here.\n\n[Gladio finds the switch and is able to open the doors for Noctis; he leaps into the room with them and lets himself fall backward on the floor]\n\nGladio: That was close.\n\nNoct: The hell’d you get here?\n\n[Gladio holds out his hand to Noct]\n\nGladio: You’re welcome?\n\nNoct: Thanks.\n\n[Noct takes Gladio’s hand, and Gladio pulls him to his feet]\n\nIgnis: After we were separated, we received “help”—from the usual suspect.\n\nGladio: That bastard’s playing with us. But at least we’re together.\n\nIgnis: All but one of us.\n\nArdyn: Reunited with your retainers at last. How very touching. Must be a fine feeling, having friends. Look how happy you are! I pray you find your dear Prompto soon.\n\n—\n\n(as Noct, Ignis and Gladio discover Prompto in his prison cell shortly after reuniting with one another)\n\n[They free Prompto from the device he was being restrained to, and he falls to the floor; Noctis bends down to help him; Prompto has multiple bruises across his body; seemingly, he has undergone some degree of torture]\n\nGladio: Hey, you alright?\n\nIgnis: Are you hurt? Do you need help?\n\nPrompto: I’m fine. Thank you, Noct.\n\n[Prompto manages to sit upright]\n\nPrompto: Tell me. Were you worried about me?\n\n[A prompt appears to select either “Yeah” or “Not really”]\n\n—\n\n—\n\nYeah\n\nNoct: Of course I was. What kind of question is that?\n\nPrompto: Of course. That’s why you came, like I believed you would.\n\nNoctis: Prompto…\n\nPrompto: That’s why I told myself I couldn’t die. Not until I could see you and hear you tell me I’m not a fake—that I’m the real me.\n\nNoctis: I’m sorry.\n\nPrompto: Don’t be. Everything’s alright now.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nNot really\n\nNoct: No. Why would I be?\n\nPrompto: Don’t tell me you still think that I’m Ardyn.\n\nNoct: It’s not like that. I knew the real you wouldn’t kick the bucket so easily.\n\nPrompto: I couldn’t—at least not until I got to lay a guilt trip on you in person.\n\n[Prompto gets to his feet; Noctis stands as well]\n\nNoct: Yeah.\n\nPrompto: The thought of that alone gave me the will to survive.\n\nNoct: I’m sorry.\n\nPrompto: Don’t be. Everything’s alright now.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n(as the Chocobros make their way back toward the central area of this level of Zegnautus Keep after rescuing Prompto)\n\nIgnis: Noct, do you hear that?\n\nNoctis: Hear what?\n\nIgnis: I’ve heard this sound before—on the train, just before your weapons failed you. It’s nearby, and it may hold the key to restoring your power.\n\n—\n\n(as the four of them make their way across the catwalk leading to the central area of this level of the Keep)\n\nIgnis: It’s here.\n\n[Noctis stops at the large closed metal doors in the center of the enormous room]\n\nNoctis: This thing?\n\n[Noctis places his hand against the doors]\n\nNoctis: Door’s locked.\n\nIgnis: It’s coming from within. Is there no way through?\n\nPrompto: There’s a way.\n\n[The others look at him; Prompto hesitantly steps up to the door’s scanner and raises the back of his right wrist to it; the doors slide open; Prompto resumes speaking, staring off into the room, unable to make eye contact with the others]\n\nPrompto: So, MTs… They’ve got those codeprints…just like I do.\n\nNoctis: Do they? Never looked.\n\nPrompto: Yeah… So, as it turns out…I’m one of them. Not exactly something I could tell people growing up in Lucis.\n\n[Prompto is fighting back tears, but continues speaking]\n\nPrompto: Still… You guys are like…the only friends I’ve ever known. I just hope that things can stay the way they were.\n\nNoctis: Whatever. Who cares where you were born?\n\nIgnis: I don’t see you turning against us. Not now, or ever.\n\nPrompto: Thanks, guys. Still…I can’t change where I came from. What I am.\n\nNoctis: Since when does where you come from matter to you? You never once treated me as a prince.\n\n[Noct playfully punches Prompto’s shoulder]\n\nGladiolus: He’s got you there.\n\nIgnis: Never so much as a “Highness.”\n\nNoct: We’re done here. C’mon, crown citizen.\n\n[Gladio steps over to Ignis to help guide him into the room; he gives Prompto’s shoulder a friendly smack as they walk past]\n\nGladiolus: You’re one of us, right?\n\n[Ignis stops and turns back toward Prompto over his shoulder]\n\nIgnis: Unless you’d rather not be.\n\n[Prompto smiles, nods, and follows them]\n\n—\n\n[Inside the room Prompto opened, they find the emperor’s abandoned clothing laying upon the throne; he, too, has become a daemon; they also find a large bank of computers, the cause of Noctis’s lost powers; Noctis rams his father’s sword through the machines]\n\nPrompto: So…did it work?\n\nIgnis: With the device down and out, Noct’s power should be up and running.\n\nGladiolus: Go on, try it.\n\nNoctis: Alright. Moment of truth.\n\n[Noctis holds out his hand and conjures a sword; Prompto claps in celebration]\n\nGladiolus: We’re back, baby.\n\nNoctis: Let’s roll.\n\nWith all his powers restored, Noctis can once again travel to the past by calling Umbra at dormitories.\n\n—\n\n(as the fully reunited and re-empowered Chocobros leave the emperor’s throne room)\n\n[The gargantua daemon that caused Noct’s earlier fall suddenly lands on the platform in front of them; it’s quickly joined by other daemons, who begin manifesting]\n\nNoctis: Not you again.\n\nPrompto: New friend?\n\nGladio: You really need to pick ’em better.\n\n—\n\n(as the bros battle Noctis’s “new friend” and the other daemons)\n\nPrompto: Iggy! Can you see again?\n\nIgnis: ‘Fraid not, but that doesn’t mean I can’t fight.\n\nPrompto: Well, just don’t overdo it, okay?\n\n—\n\n(after defeating Noctis’s “new friend” and the other daemons)\n\nPrompto: I see you decided to rock the ring.\n\nNoctis: Had to. No weapons, no friends, no choice, really. Y’know, somebody here’s got to fight to rescue the Crystal… …not to mention rescue all of your asses.\n\nGladiolus: Spoken like a true king. About time.\n\nIgnis: The ring represents a great burden, but you don’t bear it alone.\n\nNoctis: You can say that again. Especially now that you all have your weapons back.\n\n—\n\n(beginning another battle after the four friends are reunited)\n\nGladiolus: Keep an eye on Iggy.\n\nPrompto: I’ll keep both on him!\n\nGladiolus: That’ll do.\n\n—\n\n(during another battle after the four friends are reunited)\n\nGladiolus: You really can hold your own.\n\nIgnis: At the very least, I must try.\n\n—\n\n(as the four friends make their way through the Keep)\n\nIgnis: Hopefully Biggs and Wedge both made it to safety.\n\nPrompto: Who and who?\n\nGladio: Our train drivers.\n\nNoctis: And soldiers. They can fend for themselves.\n\n—\n\n(as the four friends make their way through the Keep)\n\nPrompto: So, where’d you guys park the Regalia?\n\nGladiolus: Outside. Though “park” ain’t the right word.\n\nIgnis: She’s broken down, alas.\n\nNoctis: Took one for us, saved our lives.\n\n—\n\n(as the four continue making their way through the Keep)\n\nIgnis: Now then, the Crystal.\n\nGladio: I’m guessing the way is locked.\n\nPrompto: Well, I guess it’s a good thing somebody has keys to the whole fortress.\n\nNoctis: You’re no better than a burglar.\n\nPrompto: Aren’t I?\n\n—\n\n(when the four are confronted by the Foras daemon)\n\n???: The ring… It’s mine…\n\nIgnis: Truly be…the emperor?\n\nGladio: Does seem kinda keen on the ring.\n\nPrompto: So we fight him?\n\nNoctis: We take mercy.\n\n—\n\n(when the Foras daemon is killed)\n\nIedolas: The empire shall span…all the lands… By the Crystal’s Light…we shall flourish… I shall arise…as ruler…of the world!\n\n—\n\n(as the royal retinue makes their way through the hangar area)\n\nGladio: One helluva hangar.\n\nPrompto: Look at all this space.\n\nNoctis: So, the central elevator’s through here.\n\nGladio: And out of the loading bay.\n\n[The large doors at the other end of the hangar begin opening]\n\nArdyn: Your Majesty, your precious Crystal awaits you. To liven things up I thought I’d take you on a stroll down memory lane. Of course, memories decay with time.\n\n[Ravus’s body walks through the doors, now grotesque and daemonic, transformed into a monster]\n\nRavus: Kill me… End it…\n\nGladiolus: Is that Ravus?\n\nPrompto: Or what’s left of him…\n\nNoctis: Dammit…\n\n—\n\n(when Ravus’s body has been defeated)\n\nGladiolus: A sorry end for the high commander—for anyone. He was a man with hopes and dreams.\n\n[Ravus’s body begins to discorporate]\n\nPrompto: It’s horrible.\n\nIgnis: What kind of fiend makes daemons of men?\n\n[Ravus’s body finishes discorporating and is gone; Noct looks sadly at the floor where his body had been]\n\nGladio: Look alive—company!\n\n[The room suddenly fills with daemons; they begin to attack]\n\n(after the battle goes on for a moment)\n\nGladio: We’re getting nowhere!\n\nPrompto: And they just keep coming!\n\nIgnis: Noct, you must go alone.\n\nNoctis: What?\n\nIgnis: If you can obtain the Crystal’s power, we may yet turn the tide. Elsewise, we are all like to perish here.\n\nGladio: Iggy’s right. It’s our only chance.\n\nNoctis: But what about you?\n\nPrompto: We’ll manage somehow! Just get moving!\n\n[Ardyn broadcasts his voice to Noctis]\n\nArdyn: You could still get to the Crystal…if you went on your own. Your friends will have to stay behind.\n\n—\n\n[The elevator to the loading bay comes up to this level for Noct; he takes it down to the loading bay and begins running for the elevator on the other side]\n\n[An automated message rings out]\n\nAnnouncement: Hangar gate closing Please stand clear.\n\n[The gate to the elevator begins to close]\n\nArdyn: You’d better think fast. I don’t envy you your decision.\n\n[Noctis continues to run as daemons begin manifesting and pursue him]\n\nNoctis: So this is the way to the Crystal?\n\nArdyn: Betraying your friends for the greater good—the mark of a monarch! Step forth, Your Majesty!\n\n—\n\n(as Noct makes it through the hangar gate)\n\nArdyn: If you wish to obtain the Crystal’s power, you must be prepared to lose all else.\n\n[Noct stops and looks back, seeing his friends absolutely swarmed by daemons, but fighting on; he turns to face the elevator, allowing the hangar gate to close behind him, separating him from his friends once again; he runs toward the final elevator]\n\nAnnouncement: Gate closed.\n\nNoctis: Don’t die on me.\n\n—\n\n(after Noctis enters the elevator and it begins to rise)\n\nArdyn: Do you suppose your dear friends are still alive? Those who died for you—do you ever wonder what went through their minds? Can you even recall their final words?\n\nNoctis: I’ll come back for you all. I swear.\n\n—\n\n(as Noctis exits the elevator and races down the final hall leading to the Crystal)\n\nNoctis: How far’s this go? The Crystal had better be here. Everyone’s counting on it…counting on me.\n\n[Noctis runs into the room housing the Crystal; Ardyn broadcasts his voice to him once more]\n\nArdyn: Your journey is over, Noct.\n\n[Noctis stands before the Crystal and holds his hand out to it]\n\nNoctis: Please… Help me stop the daemons.\n\n[Suddenly, the Crystal becomes very bright and seizes Noctis’s hand; it begins to slowly pull him inside itself; as Noctis struggles in futility to get free, Ardyn swaggers into the room]\n\nArdyn: Unharmed by the Light. The Chosen King, indeed. Allow me to regale you with a tale. In an age long past, an incurable scourge ravaged mankind. A tiny menace that twisted men into monsters, the likes of which you’ve seen. In Lucis lived a savior who could cure the afflicted. His body would come to host myriad daemons, that countless lives be spared. But a jealous king, one not yet chosen by the Crystal, ostracized and demonized this healer of the people. Making a true monster of him. I gave you my name earlier, but you should know that it was not the name given to me at birth. Ardyn Lucis Caelum is my proper name. You’ll never guess whose name Izunia was. Noct, killing you as a mortal will bring me scant satisfaction. Claim the Crystal’s power. Arise as its champion. Only once the Crystal and King are no more…can I know redemption. Come back soon. I shall keep your friends company until you are ready.\n\n[Note by Glenn Morrow: In the original Japanese script for what Ardyn says here, he reveals that the one named Izunia who betrayed him not only made a pariah of him, but also either executed him personally or caused his execution. The line that became “But a jealous king, one not yet chosen by the Crystal, ostracized and demonized this healer of the people” in the official English localization was が、まだクリスタルに選ばれていなかった王は\n\nその 人々を救える 唯一の男を殺してしまった in Japanese.\n\nA more direct translation of this would be “However, a king not yet chosen by the Crystal killed that only man who could save the people.”]\n\n[After Noctis has been completely pulled into the Crystal, Prompto, Ignis and Gladiolus arrive, but are unable to do anything to help him; Ardyn turns to them, gestures nonchalantly at the Crystal and begins to walk away; Gladiolus swings his sword through Ardyn’s head, releasing a puff of dark smoke from where the blade strikes; Ardyn falls back a little, but maintains his balance and holds onto his hat to keep it from falling off his head; he then continues walking away; Prompto shoots Ardyn in the back before he can take more than a couple of steps, releasing another puff of dark smoke and hurling his body onto the floor; Ardyn’s hat rolls away and lays still for several seconds before Ardyn’s hand suddenly reaches down to collect it and place it back on his head; once more unharmed, Ardyn is again standing; he smiles at Ignis, revealing corrupted daemonic features as he does so, but they go unnoticed since Ignis is blind; Ardyn walks away, leaving Noctis’s closest friends unharmed but devastated]\n\nBelieving this sacred stone would purge the world of daemons, Noctis reached out to it, only to be pulled inside.\n\n—\n\n[Noctis finds himself floating in an ethereal void resembling the Lifestream from Final Fantasy VII; he floats down into the palm of an enormous humanoid figure clad in dragon-like armor]\n\nBahamut: Gather strength, O Chosen. The fate of this world falls to the King of Kings, His Providence consecrated in the divine Light of the Crystal. So it is ordained—the revelation of Bahamut.\n\nWhat is this place?\n\nThe heart of the Crystal, wherein lies the soul of the star, and it is in this place that the King will gain the power to fulfill his calling. By the covenants awakened, the Six have seen the coming of the prophesied hour—a time when the Crystal shall have shed the entirety of its Light unto the ring. Only then, once the sacred ring is replete, can the True King complete his ascension. And only by the True King’s hand can the immortal Accursed be banished and the Light restored to this world.\n\nWhere are my friends?\n\nBahamut: They stand against the darkness and abide in hope, sustained by faith unfaltering that their King shall arise and bring deliverance.\n\nWho is “the Accursed”?\n\nBahamut: A man cursed with life eternal, whose immortality stems from the selfsame scourge that wrought the daemons. One so impure of body and soul was deemed unworthy of the Crystal’s Light, and forbidden to ascend. His mind twisted by spite and bent on revenge, the Usuper came to bring darkness down upon our world. Only the True King, chosen by the Crystal and guarded by his forebears, can end the Accursed’s madness.\n\nWhat is “Providence”?\n\nBahamut: It is the sole means to ending the immortal Accursed. A power greater than even that of the Six, purifying all by the Light of the Crystal and the glaives of rulers past. Only at the throne can the Chosen receive it, and only at the cost of a life: his own. The King of Kings shall be granted the power to banish the darkness, but the blood price must be paid. To cast out the Usurper and usher in dawn’s light will cost the life of the Chosen. Many sacrificed all for the King; so must the King sacrifice himself for all.\n\n[Bahamut suddenly pulls his hand away and Noctis descends into the ether]\n\nBahamut: Now enter into Reflection, that the Light of Providence shine within.\n\n[Note by Glenn Morrow: When Bahamut explains that the Lifestream-esque place Noctis finds himself in is “The heart of the Crystal, wherein lies the soul of the star,” what he refers to as “the star” is 星 (i.e. hoshi) in Japanese; the word used for celestial bodies in general. It can mean “star,” but can also refer to planets — and, indeed, is not only what everyone in FFVII refers to that game’s planet by, but also what FFXV’s Lore Guide from the game’s opening tutorial explains the word to mean in this game.\n\nIn the Japanese version of FFXV, the segment of the Lore Guide entitled “The Six and the Oracle” ends with an additional line that says ちなみに、これらの話題でいう「星」は「世界」の意です — “By the way, ‘star’ in these topics means ‘world.'” This either became “star” in the official English localization due to an error in translation or, as is more likely, a deliberate choice on the part of the localization to give some linguistic flair to the game’s dialogue.\n\nClick here for a screenshot or here for a video showing this segment of the Lore Guide in the Japanese version, and for further reference, this is Bahamut’s line above in Japanese: 聖石の中 星の魂が宿そところ]\n\n[Additional note by Glenn Morrow: When Bahamut describes Ardyn with “One so impure of body and soul was deemed unworthy of the Crystal’s Light, and forbidden to ascend,” by “ascend” he means “become king.” This turn of phrasing for the English localization, while elegant, is confusing, coming as it does right after “A man cursed with life eternal, whose immortality stems from the selfsame scourge that wrought the daemons.”\n\nThe reasonable implication to take from “deemed unworthy of the Crystal’s light, and forbidden to ascend” is that it ties directly to Ardyn becoming “cursed with life eternal.” In other words, that Ardyn cannot die and “ascend” because he became “one so impure of body and soul” that the Crystal rejects his soul returning to itself, the soul of the planet.\n\nThis understanding, while the reasonable conclusion to draw, is an unfortunate misunderstanding encouraged by the wording chosen here for the localization. What Bahamut actually says in Japanese is その汚れた身体を聖石に拒まれ王位に就くことなく葬られた愚かな男. A more direct translation of this would be “A foolish man who was rejected by the Holy Stone for that unclean body and was buried without ascending to the throne.”\n\nArdyn’s immortality, meanwhile, is a result of the Starscourge itself rather than due to the Crystal’s rejection of him for absorbing the Starscourge.]\n\n[The screen briefly fades to black before revealing Noctis floating about in a meditative position; as he recalls memories from throughout his journey and from his childhood, the white light in the Ring of the Lucii on his hand grows ever brighter before briefly engulfing the whole screen]\n\nBahamut: The Light waxes full. Go forth to the kingdom, where the Usurper awaits. Reclaim the throne, and fulfill the calling of the True King.\n\n[When the screen fades back in to reveal Noctis, he has disheveled facial hair and his youthful features have hardened; he’s sitting inside a small stone structure and appears to slowly become aware of his surroundings as the white light emanating from the Ring of the Lucii fades\n\nAngelgard\n\nStone Prison\n\n[Noctis slowly rises to his feet and walks down a short series of steps to a beach outside where he finds Umbra waiting for him, a note in the dog’s mouth]\n\nNoctis: Umbra…\n\n[Noctis takes the note from Umbra and reads it]\n\nNoctis: “Be waiting…in Hammerhead.”\n\n—\n\nChapter 13, Verse 2: For King and Comrade\n\nZegnautus Keep\n\nAt long last, the group infiltrates the imperial capital of Gralea, only to lose their king behind enemy lines. Gladiolus and Ignis storm Zegnautus Keep in pursuit of Noctis.\n\n—\n\n[As the chapter begins, Gladio is pulling Ignis up to stand beside him on top of the train car that collapsed and separated them from Noctis]\n\nGladiolus: Going up.\n\n[Gladio places Ignis’s cane back in his hand once they’re both on top of the wreckage]\n\nIgnis: Is there a way forward?\n\nGladiolus: There’s a way, but I don’t see us going forward without facing off with the daemons.\n\nIgnis: But now Noct is facing them alone. There must be some way we can help him.\n\n[Ardyn’s voice suddenly rings out]\n\nArdyn: Perhaps I could be of service.\n\n[Ardyn saunters out of the wreckage of another train car]\n\nGladio: What are you doing here?\n\nArdyn: Why, I come bearing gifts.\n\n[Ardyn snaps his fingers; as he does so, Gladio’s sword materializes in his hand and a dagger materializes in Ignis’s]\n\nGladio: The hell?\n\nArdyn: See? Gifts! Now, I believe a “thank you” is in order.\n\nGladio: For what—another one of your stupid tricks?\n\nArdyn: Here I am, helping for a change, but I can see I’m not wanted.\n\n[Ardyn gestures a farewell, turns, and walks away]\n\nIgnis: I’m loath to trust him.\n\nGladio: Same…but at this point, we need all the help we can get.\n\n[He looks at his sword for a moment before dispelling it; Ignis and Gladio begin to make their way down on the other side of the wrecked train car]\n\n—\n\n(as the duo makes their way through the train wreckage in the area)\n\nIgnis: I ought to have been more cautious. If anything were to happen to Noct, I…\n\nGladio: Can’t move forward if you’re always looking backward. Quit thinking about what you could’ve done then and start thinking about what you can do now.\n\nIgnis: You’re right. What’s done is done.\n\n—\n\n(after encountering their first wave of daemons and killing them)\n\nGladio: So if we can conjure our weapons again, does that mean Noct can, too?\n\nIgnis: I have a feeling the chancellor isn’t so generous.\n\nGladio: How come?\n\nIgnis: He may have feigned friendship, but he’s proven a foe before. We’d best be careful.\n\n—\n\n(as Gladio and Ignis enter Zegnautus Keep)\n\nIgnis: It’s dead silent.\n\nGladio: More like undead silent. Place is crawling with daemons.\n\n—\n\n[While they make their way through the Keep, Ardyn broadcasts his voice to Ignis and Gladio]\n\nArdyn: Right this way, gentlemen.\n\nIgnis: Proceed with caution.\n\n—\n\n(as the two make their way in the direction Ardyn intends)\n\nArdyn: Keep going… A little closer… Yes, that’s a good boy.\n\n[A wall suddenly begins to slide open; Gladio holds his hand up to halt Ignis]\n\nGladio: Hold up.\n\nIgnis: What is it?\n\nGladio: Found some kinda secret passage.\n\nIgnis: Lead here by our “guide”\n\nGladio: Long as it’s a step in the right direction, I’ll take it.\n\nIgnis: Where are we now?\n\nGladio: Whatever it is, it’s a mess. Watch your step.\n\n—\n\n(as Gladio and Ignis enter a control room)\n\nGladiolus: Hey, Iggy. Think we might’ve found the control room. Got lotsa…monitors and stuff.\n\nIgnis: Which may help us monitor the rest of the keep. Does anything look operable?\n\n[Gladio begins examining a control panel]\n\nGladiolus: I’m more of a low-tech kinda guy, but I’ll see what I can do. What have we here? Huh. Looks like they wiped everything.\n\nIgnis: All of it?\n\nGladiolus: Yep. Wait—I’ve got something. There’s one surveillance tape they forgot to erase—almost like they wanted us to see it.\n\nIgnis: Then we’d best have a look. Whatever’s on that tape may help us locate Noct and Prompto.\n\n[Gladiolus plays the tape; a static-filled screen appears]\n\nIedolas: What of the Hydraean’s power? What of my precious ring?\n\n[The picture on the tape comes into focus; Ravus stands before the emperor in the throne room, King Regis’s sword in hand; dark energy like that which rises when the daemons appear is rising off the emperor’s hands]\n\nRavus: By the hand of the Oracle, they are with the King now—their rightful owner. And someday soon, he shall use them to purge our star of its scourge.\n\nIedolas: But the Crystal is mine… I am the one True King!\n\nRavus: Nay, it is Noctis and none other.\n\n[Note by Glenn Morrow: When Ravus says “And someday soon, he shall use them to purge our star of its scourge,” this line is a callback to earlier in the English localization when Lunafreya said “Only the true king, anointed by the Crystal, can purge our star of its scourge” — and as gone over there, what she referred to as “our star” there actually means the planet Eos.\n\nFor the Japanese version of this line from Ravus, all he actually says is “As the True King, he will certainly cleanse this world of its darkness.” Here is the line in Japanese for further reference: いずれ真の王として必ずや世の闇を晴らしましょう]\n\n[Daemons begin coalescing behind Ravus; he turns his head slightly, taking notice of them]\n\nRavus: Certainly not a puppet of the darkness and the daemons it has borne.\n\nIedolas: You are the puppet…and you must die.\n\n[The daemons begin to attack Ravus; he skillfully begins fending them off, wielding Regis’s sword; a sudden blast of daemonic energy hits him from behind, though, pushing him out of the throne room and toward a railing; a second blast descends on him, but he is able to deflect it with the sword; a third blast, however, hits him squarely in the chest and launches him over the railing into the depths of the Keep; the picture on the tape descends into static again briefly before regaining focus, now with Ravus once more; he’s pulling himself to his feet, holding to a railing and using King Regis’s sword for support; he can barely stand; suddenly, what appears to be Noctis walks into the room; Ravus turns to him]\n\nRavus: At last you have arrived, Noctis. The gods have shown you their favor. As Blood of the Oracle, I present you your father’s glaive.\n\n[Ravus holds the haft of the sword out to him, gripping it with his magitek arm]\n\nRavus: Now go forth, my king. Shine your light unto the world.\n\n[The one who appears to be Noctis begins to reach for the haft of the sword, then suddenly conjures a red-bladed facsimile of the Sword of the Father; he swings the sword at Ravus, cutting off his magitek arm just below the shoulder and seemingly injuring him elsewhere as well; Ravus takes a few clumsy steps forward, then collapses onto his back, dead; “Noctis” leans down and picks up the Sword of the Father, Ravus’s severed arm still gripping it, then carries it over beside of Ravus’s body; he shoves the blade into the ground, leaving it standing over Ravus]\n\nNoctis: Spare me your sycophancy. I’ve indulged your false heroism for far too long.\n\n[“Noctis” kneels down over Ravus’s body and begins speaking with his real voice: Ardyn’s]\n\nArdyn: You tried to save the world in my stead, but it wasn’t enough. The Crystal chose me—not you.\n\n[Now appearing as himself again, Ardyn stands and places his hat on his head before reaching into his coat and pulling out the letters Ravus had written to Lunafreya, discovered by Noctis in Chapter 13; Ardyn dismissively tosses the papers on Ravus’s body, then begins walking out of the room]\n\nArdyn: Rejection hurts, doesn’t it?\n\n[Note: The audio here has Ardyn say, “Aw, rejection hurts, doesn’t it?”]\n\n[The picture on the tape reverts to static; the scene reverts to Ignis and Gladio]\n\nIgnis: Was that Noct?\n\nGladiolus: No. Just that scumbag chancellor posing as him.\n\nIgnis: It sounded like Ravus tried to return His Majesty’s sword.\n\nGladiolus: Yeah. Guess he finally got over his grudge. Even called Noct “[his] king.”\n\n[The two are silent for a moment]\n\nGladiolus: Let’s move. If that’s what he did to Ravus, there’s no telling what he’ll do to Noct.\n\n—\n\n(as Ignis and Gladio enter the control room where the Crystal is displayed on the monitors)\n\nGladiolus: Hey, there it is.\n\nIgnis: What is it?\n\nGladiolus: The Crystal—right here on the screen.\n\nIgnis: Then we’re close. Do you see any sort of control panel?\n\n[Gladio examines the control panel]\n\nIgnis: If it’s anything like the Citadel, there should be a barrier barring access.\n\nGladiolus: Then we un-bar it. You just tell me what to do.\n\nIgnis: Right.\n\n[Gladio begins to touch some of the instruments; the screen briefly fades to black; when it fades back in, Gladio is stepping back from the control panel, having just entered a command; he looks at the monitors in anticipation; the barrier blocking access to the Crystal turns off; suddenly, the foot of a daemon lands heavily on the floor behind Ignis and Gladio; they turn to face the creature; it’s the Foras daemon from Chapter 13]\n\n???: Thieves cannot escape the hand of justice. The Crystal is mine… Never shall I lose my grip! The Crystal, the Light, the power… All of it… Mine!\n\n[As the daemon shouts that last word, the emperor’s face is briefly superimposed over that of the creature; the daemon roars, preparing to attack; Ignis and Gladio conjure their weapons and fight back; after sustaining enough damage, the daemon growls, folds its wings over itself and vanishes in a puff of dark smoke; Gladiolus is breathing heavily]\n\nIgnis: I can’t hear it anymore. Is it dead?\n\nGladiolus: Not yet—thing just disappeared. Ain’t never seen one that talked like that before.\n\nIgnis: Nor one so fixated on the Crystal.\n\nGladiolus: I thought Aranea said the daemons were afraid of the Crystal.\n\nIgnis: It may be like moths to a flame—or it may be one of the empire’s “alternative facts.”\n\nGladiolus: Whichever it is, that monster’s still on the loose.\n\nIgnis: And we need to find it before it finds Noct and Prompto.\n\n—\n\n(as Gladio and Ignis make their way past a hallway, a door at the other end slides open)\n\nGladio: If that son of a bitch even—\n\nIgnis: Wait. Can’t you hear that?\n\nGladio: Hear what?\n\nIgnis: Noct’s voice. I heard it clear as day. This way—follow me!\n\n[Ignis quickly sets out down the hall]\n\nGladio: Hey, wait up!\n\n[Gladio takes off after him]\n\n—\n\nCHAPTER 14 – Homecoming\n\nNoctis leaves his prison to find himself on Angelgard. His father’s ship is moored at shore, none the worse for wear. It now carries him back to Galdin Quay—back to his kingdom.\n\n—\n\n(as Noctis drives the boat toward Galdin Quay)\n\nNoctis: Man… How long was I out?\n\n—\n\n(upon arrival at the dock)\n\n[Noct and Umbra stand on the dock; even from here, Noct can already see that Galdin Quay is deserted and in shambles]\n\nNoctis: Where’d everybody go?\n\n[As Noctis takes a few steps forward, daemons begin pouring out of the main venue at Galdin Quay and rush the dock]\n\nNoctis: Daemons everywhere. The hell happened?\n\n—\n\n(after Noct makes his way through the debris of the main venue at Galdin Quay to the boardwalk that leads to shore)\n\nNoctis: Hope everyone’s okay.\n\n—\n\n(upon making it to the main highway)\n\n[Umbra begins barking]\n\nNoct: What is it, boy? Something’s coming.\n\n[After a few seconds, a truck pulls into view around the bend and approaches]\n\nNoct: A truck?\n\n[The vehicle pulls over and comes to a stop when it reaches Noct; he walks up to the driver’s side door; the driver is a young man]\n\n???: Uh…\n\nNoct: Yeah?\n\nTalcott: It’s me, Talcott. My grandpa served the Amicitia family?\n\nNoct: Talcott?\n\nTalcott: Yeah.\n\nNoct: No way.\n\nTalcott: Yes way. Welcome back, Your Majesty.\n\n[Talcott smiles; the scene transitions to inside the truck; Noctis and Umbra are now Talcott’s passengers; Talcott is on the phone]\n\nTalcott: Yes, sir, that’s right. Hm? Just a second.\n\n[Note: The audio here has Talcott say “Yes, sir, that’s—that’s right. Hm? Oh. Just a second.”]\n\n[Talcott hands the phone to Noct]\n\nTalcott: Said he wants to have a word with you?\n\nNoct: He can have it in person.\n\n[Talcott puts the phone back up to his own ear]\n\nTalcott: He said you can have it in person. Okay. We should be there shortly, sir.\n\n[Talcott begins to drive them all to Hammerhead; along the way, they pass a number of daemons prowling the land]\n\nTalcott: Wow. I can’t tell you how good it is to see you again.\n\nNoct: Yeah. You sure look different, though.\n\nTalcott: You think so? Guess I’ve grown some these ten years.\n\nNoctis: Ten years?\n\nTalcott: The guys must be pinching themselves right now.\n\nNoct: Where are they anyway?\n\nTalcott: Lestallum, more often than not, but they take a lot of trips to Hammerhead.\n\nNoct: For…?\n\nTalcott: For Miss Cindy—y’know, back at the garage. She’s a tough one, but when she needs a little extra muscle out on the road, she gives ’em a call.\n\nNoct: Huh.\n\nTalcott: Ah—speaking of which, the guys said they’re near Hammerhead right now, so we’ll be meeting them there. Y’know, ever since you disappeared, Your Majesty, it’s been nothing but nighttime nonstop. Lestallum still has light—thanks to the power plant—so just about everyone’s taken refuge there.\n\nNoct: Only there?\n\nTalcott: Everywhere else’s been abandoned. Daemons moved in, forcing the people to move out. People still swing by the garage at Hammerhead from time to time, but it usually isn’t for repairs. These days, it’s less of a service station and more of a “slayer station”—a base for daemon-hunting. The garage’s still open, though…one of the few places that is.\n\nNoct: So, um…Cid. Is he still alive and kicking?\n\nTalcott: He’s kicking alright, just not as hard as before. He hasn’t really been himself lately. At lesat, not since he moved out to Lestallum. Someone suggested he move the garage there, too… …but old man Cid wasn’t having it. He called it “a big, fat chocobo turd of an idea.” Said it just wouldn’t be the same anywhere else.\n\nNoct: That sounds like Cid alright.\n\nTalcott: Miss Cindy said she didn’t mind either way, so the garage will probably stay put for a while. And without any tinkering to do, Ignig’s gourmet seafood is about all Cid has left to look forward to. With all the daemons prowling around, more folk were getting hurt…or worse. So Iris talked the marshal into taking out the daemons themselves. “Iris the Daemon Slayer,” they call her. Gladio and the others, they lend ’em a hand whenever they can. Prompto spends most of his time hunting around Hammerhead. He tries to impress Miss Cindy…but she’s already married to her work.\n\nNoct: And Ignis?\n\nTalcott: He hunts, too. We tried to stop him, but he wouldn’t listen. He said, if anything, he’s more used to the darkness than we are.\n\nNoct: Never did get his vision back…\n\nTalcott: I’m afraid not. But, that being said, he gets by pretty well on his own. Gladio and Prompto usually hunt on their own as well. It isn’t often you see the three of them together nowadays. They still work as a team every once in a while, but each has his own set of tasks to keep him busy.\n\nNoct: Is that so?\n\nTalcott: We’ve arrived, Your Majesty. Everyone’ll be so happy to see you. Don’t worry—I won’t be going anywhere. If you have any other questions, please don’t hesitate "
