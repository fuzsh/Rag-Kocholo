OPERATION GLADIO

ITALY

1947 Origins of Gladio

"As early as 1947, the United States was constructing a clandestine network

in Northern Italy to act in the event of a communist insurrection or

electoral victory." (Wolfgang Achtner, Sunday Independent, 11/11/90)

"Though the Stay Behind operation was officially started only in 1952, "the

whole exercise had been in existence for a long time, in fact ever since

it was born in the head of Allen Dulles," said the ex-Nato source who has

access to files in several West European nations. According to him,

Dulles, the first chief of the CIA, worked out the original plan to build

secret anti-communist guerilla forces across Europe when he was based in

Switzerland at the end of the second world war. Dulles, Sir Stewart Menzies

(SIS) and the Belgian Premier Paul Henri Spaak codified the plan in a

secret pact sometime between 1949 and 1952 under the umbrella of the

Clandestine Co-ordinating Committee at the Supreme Headquarters Allied

Powers Europe, (SHAPE), which became Nato. "There was a division of labour

between the British and the US," he continued, "with Britain taking

responsibility for the operation in France, Belgium, Holland, Portugal and

Norway and the Americans looking after Sweden, Finland and the rest of

Europe" (Searchlight, January 1991)

1951 Formation of Clandestine Planning Committee

"In 1951, said the newspaper [Die Welt], Allied intelligence agencies and

each participating nation - Germany, Italy and France being among the first

- agreed to set up a Committee for planning to oversee the network"

(Associated Press, 13/11/90)

1955-58 CIA control of Italian secret services

"Former defence minister Paulo Taviani [told Magistrate Casson during his

1990 investigation] that during his time in office (1955-1958), the Italian

secret services were bossed and financed by the boys in Via Veneto' - ie

the CIA agents in the US Embassy in the heart of Rome. (William Scobie,

Observer, 18/11/90)

1956 General Giovanni de Lorenzo appointed head of Sifar

"De Lorenzo was...appointed head of the secret services (Sifar) in 1956 by

President Granchi, he stayed on as head of Sifar after he was made

commander of the carabinieri in 1962." (Stuart Christie, "Stefano de

Chiaie", Anarchy/Refract, 1984)

1956 Formation of Gladio

"US documents declassified in the 1970's show that General Giovanni de

Lorenzo, the chief of Sifar (Italian Military Intelligence), joined the US

in the 1950's in preparing a plan against a Communist takeover, but did not

inform his own government. According to a document released by Mr

Andreotti last month the CIA and Sifar sketched a plan in November 1956,

codenamed Gladio, to form a force of 1000 men capable of guerilla warfare

and espionage. A training base was set-up in Sardinia and 139 weapons and

ammunition dumps were hidden in Northern Italy." (Wolfgang Achtner, Sunday

Independent, 11/11/90)

"Andreotti ... has admitted to parliament that a covert intelligence

service was set-up forty years ago, with the help of the CIA and British

agents to combat Soviet subversion or aggression. Although no elected

representatives save Prime Ministers were told of its existence, it still

exists." (Wolfgang Achtner, Sunday Independent, 11/11/90)

"The network, run by secret-services of Nato members, was apparently set-up

in the 1950's at US instigation to create a guerrilla resistance

organisation in the event of a Soviet invasion or communist takeover in

Nato countries." (John Palmer, Guardian, 10/11/90)

"General sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley, a former commander-in-chief of Nato

forces in northern Europe said...that a covert intelligence service was set

up in Italy with the help of British agents and the CIA - which also partly

funded it. The Italian branch of the network wa
