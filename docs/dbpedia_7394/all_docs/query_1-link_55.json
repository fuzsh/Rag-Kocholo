        "text": "David Lee Chaum (born 1955) is an American computer scientist and cryptographer. He is known as a pioneer in cryptography and privacy-preserving technologies, and widely recognized as the inventor of digital cash. His 1982 dissertation \"Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups\" is the first known proposal for a blockchain protocol. Complete with the code to implement the protocol, Chaum's dissertation proposed all but one element of the blockchain later detailed in the Bitcoin whitepaper. He is also known for developing ecash, an electronic cash application that aims to preserve a userâ€™s anonymity, and inventing many cryptographic protocols like the blind signature and mix networks. In 1995 his company DigiCash, an electronic money corporation, created the first digital currency with eCash. His 1981 paper, \"Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms\", laid the groundwork for the field of anonymous communications research.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti was an Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer; he epitomised the Renaissance Man. Although he is often characterized as an \"architect\" exclusively, as James Beck has observed, \"to single out one of Leon Battista's 'fields' over others as somehow functionally independent and self-sufficient is of no help at all to any effort to characterize Alberti's extensive explorations in the fine arts.\" Alberti's life was described in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects."
