        "text": "See also: Category:Cryptographers for an exhaustive list.\n\nPre twentieth century[]\n\nAl-Kindi, 9th century Arabic polymath and originator of frequency analysis\n\nCharles Babbage, UK, 19th century mathematician who, about the time of the Crimean War, secretly developed an effective attack against polyalphabetic substitution ciphers.\n\nLeone Battista Alberti, polymath/universal genius, inventor of polyalphabetic substitution (more specifically, the Alberti cipher), and what may have been the first mechanical encryption aid.\n\nGiovanni Battista della Porta, author of a seminal work on cryptanalysis.\n\nÉtienne Bazeries, French, military, considered one of the greatest natural cryptanalysts. Best known for developing the \"Bazeries Cylinder\" and his influential 1901 text Les Chiffres secrets dévoilés (\"Secret ciphers unveiled\").\n\nJulius Caesar, Roman general/politician, has the Caesar cipher is named after him, and a lost work on cryptography by Probus (probably Valerius Probus) is claimed to have covered his use of military cryptography in some detail. It is likely that he did not invent the cipher named after him, as other substitution ciphers were in use well before his time.\n\nFriedrich Kasiski, author of the first published attack on the Vigenère cipher, now known as the Kasiski test.\n\nAuguste Kerckhoffs, known for contributing cipher design principles.\n\nJohannes Trithemius, mystic and first to describe tableaux (tables) for use in polyalphabetic substitution. Wrote an early work on steganography and cryptography generally.\n\nPhilips van Marnix, lord of Sint-Aldegonde, deciphered Spanish messages for William the Silent during the Dutch revolt against the Spanish.\n\nSir Charles Wheatstone, inventor of the so-called Playfair cipher and general polymath.\n\nWorld War I and World War II Wartime Cryptographers[]\n\nLambros D.

Mitchell, U.S. National Security Agency cryptologists who defected to the Soviet Union in 1960\n\nLeo Marks, UK, SOE cryptography director, author and playwright\n\nGeorges Painvin, broke the ADFGVX cipher during the First World War\n\nMarian Rejewski, Poland, Biuro Szyfrów, a Polish mathematician and cryptologist who, in 1932, solved the Enigma machine with plugboard, the main cipher device then in use by Germany.\n\nJohn Joseph Rochefort, US, made major contributions to the break into JN-25 after the attack on Pearl Harbor\n\nFrank Rowlett, US, SIS, leader of the team that broke Purple\n\nJerzy Różycki, Poland, Biuro Szyfrów, helped break German Enigma ciphers\n\nLuigi Sacco, Italy, Italian General and author of the Manual of Cryptography\n\nLaurance Safford, US, chief cryptographer for the US Navy for 2 decades+, including World War II\n\nAbraham Sinkov, US, SIS\n\nJohn Tiltman, Brigadier, UK, GC&CS, Bletchley Park, GCHQ, NSA. Extraordinary length and range of cryptographic service\n\nAlan Mathison Turing, UK, Bletchley Park, chief cryptographer Bletchley Park, pioneering logician, and renowned computer scientist, and pioneer\n\nWilliam Thomas Tutte, UK, Bletchley Park, broke Lorenz SZ 40/42 encryption machine (codenamed Tunny) using theory carried out using the Colossus computer\n\nGordon Welchman, UK, head of Bletchley Park's Hut Six (German Army and Air Force cipher decryption).\n\nHerbert Yardley, US, MI8, author \"The American Black Chamber\", worked in China as a cryptographer and briefly in Canada\n\nHenryk Zygalski, Poland, Biuro Szyfrów, helped break German Enigma ciphers\n\nOther pre-computer[]\n\nRosario Candela, US, Architect and notable amateur cryptologist who authored books and taught classes on the subject to civilians at Hunter College.\n\nElizebeth Friedman, US, Coast Guard and US Treasury Department cryptographer.\n\nClaude Elwood Shannon, US, founder of information theory, proved the one-time pad to be unbreakable.\n\nModern[]\n\nSee also: Category:Modern cryptographers for an exhaustive list.\n\nSymmetric-key algorithm inventors[]\n\nRoss Anderson, UK, University of Cambridge, co-inventor of the Serpent cipher.\n\nPaulo S.
