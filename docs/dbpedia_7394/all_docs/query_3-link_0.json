        "text": "American cryptographer\n\nTaher Elgamal[a] (Arabic: طاهر الجمل) (born 18 August 1955) is an Egyptian cryptographer and entrepreneur. He has served as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Security at Salesforce since 2013.[1] Prior to that, he was the founder and CEO of Securify and the director of engineering at RSA Security. From 1995 to 1998, he was the chief scientist at Netscape Communications. He has been described as the \"father of SSL\" for the work he did in computer security while working at Netscape, which helped in establishing a private and secure communications on the Internet.[2]\n\nElgamal's 1985 paper entitled \"A Public Key Cryptosystem and A Signature Scheme Based on Discrete Logarithms\" proposed the design of the ElGamal discrete log cryptosystem and of the ElGamal signature scheme.[3] The latter scheme became the basis for Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) adopted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the Digital Signature Standard (DSS).\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to an article on Medium,[4] Elgamal's first love was mathematics. Although he came to the United States to pursue a PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, he said that \"cryptography was the most beautiful use of math he'd ever seen\".\n\nElgamal earned a BSc from Cairo University in 1977, and MS and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 1981 and 1984, respectively. Martin Hellman was his dissertation advisor.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nElgamal joined the technical staff at HP Labs in 1984. He served as chief scientist at Netscape Communications from 1995 to 1998,[6] where he was a driving force behind Secure Sockets Layer.[7] He also was the director of engineering at RSA Security Inc.[8] before founding Securify in 1998 and becoming its chief executive officer. According to an interview with Elgamal,[9] when Securify was acquired by Kroll-O'Gara,[10] he became the president of its information security group. After helping Securify spin out from Kroll-O'Gara,[11] Taher served as the company's chief technology officer (CTO) from 2001 to 2004.[12] In late 2008, Securify was acquired by Secure Computing[13] and is now part of McAfee.[14] In October 2006, he joined Tumbleweed Communications as a CTO.[15] Tumbleweed was acquired in 2008 by Axway Inc. Elgamal is now a CTO for security at Salesforce.com.[4][16]\n\nEntrepreneurial ventures\n\n[edit]\n\nElgamal is a co-founder of NokNok Labs[17] and InfoSec Global.[citation needed] He serves as a director of Vindicia, Inc.,[18] which provides online payment services, Zix Corporation, which provides email encryption services, and Bay Dynamics.[19] He has served as an adviser to Cyphort, Bitglass, Onset Ventures, Glenbrook Partners, PGP corporation, Arcot Systems, Finjan, Actiance, Symplified, and Zetta. He served as Chief Security Officer of Axway, Inc. He is vice chairman of SecureMisr.\n\nExecutive roles\n\n[edit]\n\nElgamal has also held executive roles at technology and security companies, including\n\nCTO of Security at Salesforce.com from 2013 to 2023,[20]\n\nCSO at Axway, Inc. from 2008 to 2011,\n\nCTO at Tumbleweed Communications from 2006 to 2008,\n\nCTO at Securify, Inc. from 2001 to 2004,\n\nCEO and President of Securify, Inc. from 1998 to 2001 and,\n\nChief Scientist of Netscape Communications from 1995 to 1998.[8]\n\nRecognition\n\n[edit]\n\nElgamal is a recipient of the RSA Conference 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award,[8] and he is recognized as the \"father of SSL,\"[2] the Internet security standard Secure Sockets Layer.\n\nElgamal and Paul Kocher were jointly awarded the 2019 Marconi Prize for \"their development of SSL/TLS and other contributions to the security of communications\".[21]\n\nElection to the National Academy of Engineering, 2022, for contributions to cryptography, e-commerce, and protocols for secure internet transactions.[22]\n\nPublications\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a scholar, Elgamal published 4 articles:\n\nT. ElGamal, \"A subexponential-time algorithm for computing discrete logarithms over GF(p2)\", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 473–481, 1985.[23]\n\nT. Elgamal, \"A public key cryptosystem and a signature scheme based on discrete logarithms\", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 469–472, Jul. 1985.[3]\n\nT. ElGamal, \"On Computing Logarithms Over Finite Fields\", in Advances in Cryptology – CRYPTO ’85 Proceedings, 1986, pp. 396–402.[24]\n\nT. Elgamal, \"The new predicaments of security practitioners\", Computer Fraud & Security, vol. 2009, no. 11, pp. 12–14, Nov. 2009.[25]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
