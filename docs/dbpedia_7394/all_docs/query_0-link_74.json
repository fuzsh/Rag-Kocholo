        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThis is a list of cryptographers. Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries.\n\nPre twentieth century\n\n[edit]\n\nAl-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi: wrote a (now lost) book on cryptography titled the \"Book of Cryptographic Messages\".\n\nAl-Kindi, 9th century Arabic polymath and originator of frequency analysis.\n\nAthanasius Kircher, attempts to decipher crypted messages\n\nAugustus the Younger, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, wrote a standard book on cryptography\n\nIbn Wahshiyya: published several cipher alphabets that were used to encrypt magic formulas.[1]\n\nJohn Dee, wrote an occult book, which in fact was a cover for crypted text\n\nIbn 'Adlan: 13th-century cryptographer who made important contributions on the sample size of the frequency analysis.\n\nDuke of Mantua Francesco I Gonzaga is the one who used the earliest example of homophonic Substitution cipher in early 1400s.[2][3]\n\nIbn al-Durayhim: gave detailed descriptions of eight cipher systems that discussed substitution ciphers, leading to the earliest suggestion of a \"tableau\" of the kind that two centuries later became known as the \"Vigenère table\".\n\nAhmad al-Qalqashandi: Author of Subh al-a 'sha, a fourteen volume encyclopedia in Arabic, which included a section on cryptology. The list of ciphers in this work included both substitution and transposition, and for the first time, a cipher with multiple substitutions for each plaintext letter.\n\nCharles Babbage, UK, 19th century mathematician who, about the time of the Crimean War, secretly developed an effective attack against polyalphabetic substitution ciphers.\n\nLeone Battista Alberti, polymath/universal genius, inventor of polyalphabetic substitution (more specifically, the Alberti cipher), and what may have been the first mechanical encryption aid.\n\nGiovanni Battista della Porta, author of a seminal work on cryptanalysis.\n\nÉtienne Bazeries, French, military, considered one of the greatest natural cryptanalysts.
