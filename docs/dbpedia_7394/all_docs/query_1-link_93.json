The two keys are mathematically related, and if it is possible to make one of the keys public and still maintain the algorithm security, then the system is called public-key. The most used public-key ciphers, the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm, the RSA algorithm, the ElGamal algorithm, and Diffie-Hellman, are discussed in this chapter.\n\nComplete Chapter List\n\nSearch this Book:\n\nReset"
