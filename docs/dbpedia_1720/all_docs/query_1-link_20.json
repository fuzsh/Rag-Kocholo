        "text": "The grave situation in Peshawar recently prompted Baba Gurpal Singh, a community representative tracing his lineage to Guru Harkrishan Sahib and a member of the NWFP minorities commission, to highlight the community’s plight in a meeting with the Pakistani Army Corps Commander Peshawar -Lieutenant General Sardar Hassan Azhar Hayat. The fact that the Sikh community had to vocalize their struggle so publicly underscores the severity of their predicament and the imperative for government action. Exclusive WSN Report.\n\nIn Peshawar, the historic heartland of the Sikh community, a crisis looms as the Sikh population dwindles and vital religious sites deteriorate. The Sikh community, with roots deeply embedded in Peshawar’s cultural tapestry and those who have sought refuge from other parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan, are calling upon the government to address the severe challenges they face.\n\nSecurity concerns have compelled over 100 Sikh families to migrate from Peshawar to Punjab, reducing the community’s number from an estimated 20,000 before 2015 to merely 2,000 today. This mass displacement speaks to the urgent need for intervention.\n\nGurdwaras, the epicenter of the Sikh faith, stand in disrepair. The Gurdwara Bhai Joga Singh, a three-century-old sanctuary established by Hari Singh Nalwa, the legendary general of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, has suffered structural damage since the 2005 earthquake. Its damaged dome and cracked walls threaten not only the historical site but also the surrounding residential areas. Despite repeated appeals to the authorities, the community’s calls for restoration have been met with silence.\n\nGurdwara Bhai Biba Singh in Hashtnagri, converted into a school post-partition and then into a vocational training center, now lies abandoned due to its dilapidated state. Even after its return to the Sikh community in 2016, disputes and governmental delays have hindered its reconstruction.\n\nInfrastructure woes extend beyond the Gurdwaras. The road leading to the cremation site near Attock Bridge is in a state of disrepair, complicating the community’s funerary rites. Moreover, concerns have been raised over the safety of the proposed new cremation site in Mera Kachori, prompting requests for relocation.\n\nThis story is not just about neglected infrastructure; it’s about preserving the dignity and heritage of a community integral to Peshawar’s diverse mosaic. It’s time for the government to heed their calls before these living monuments to history are lost forever."
