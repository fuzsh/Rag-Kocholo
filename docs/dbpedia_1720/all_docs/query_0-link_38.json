        "text": "It is largely underage girls who are ‘converting’.\n\nThe recent cases of Jagjit Kaur and Simran Kumari have gained media attention but they are not the only victims of the State Policies gone wrong. Pakistan in violation of Minority rights is a phenomenon that needs to be understood.\n\nOVER the years, the laws applicable to the rights of religious minorities in Pakistan have shifted from being neutral to blatantly discriminatory — from electoral laws, family laws, law on evidence, Hudood laws, redistribution of income through Zakat and Ushr, trust and evacuee property laws, domicile and nationality, to offences against religion.\n\nThe discrimination against women belonging to religious minority groups is worse; they become victims of rape, abduction, forced marriage and forced conversion. That it is largely underage girls who are ‘converting’ to Islam speaks volumes of the vulnerability of the converts, and the motivation of those behind the conversion.\n\nTwice the Sindh government attempted to outlaw forced conversions and marriages, including laying guidelines for the court process in the Protection of Minorities Bill, placing an age limit of 18 years upon conversions and enabling better due process. In 2016, the bill was unanimously passed by the Sindh Assembly, but religious parties objected to an age limit for conversions, and threatened to besiege the assembly if the bill received approval of the governor, who then refused to sign the bill into law.\n\nIn 2019, a revised version was introduced, but religious parties protested once again. A sit-in was organised by Pir Mian Abdul Khaliq (Mian Mithu), a political and religious leader and a central character in many cases of forced conversions of underage Hindu girls in Sindh. He and his group claim the girls are not forced, but fall in love with Muslim men and convert willingly. In March 2019, nearly 2,000 Hindus staged a sit-in to demand justice for two sisters, Reena and Raveena, who they claimed were forcibly converted and married. The Islamabad High Court ruled the girls had willingly converted and married the men. Herein lies the contention. While there are a large number of cases of forced conversions and marriages, there are also cases where vulnerable young women are preyed upon by influential men who entice them to convert and marry. To what extent can the law differentiate coercion from peaceful persuasion, and could enticement without the threat of violence become punishable?\n\nPakistan is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states that the right to freedom of religion includes the right to change one’s religion and that no one shall be subject to coercion to change their religion. The European Court of Human Rights has given some guidance regarding the distinction between permissible religious persuasion, on the one hand, and coercion on the other.\n\nAccording to case law, exploiting a position of power to entice vulnerable people or subordinates to convert amounts to coercion, which should be outlawed. The fact that the default legal system in Pakistan is discriminatory, particularly towards women from religious minorities, coupled with the clout and resources of those preying upon them, implies coercion and urgently requires positive legislation to safeguard vulnerable citizens.\n\nFurther, once the women convert, there is no going back, as apostasy would mean a death sentence. In many cases, women are also told that their families are ‘kafirs’ and they cannot meet them. This impedes their access to justice as they remain in the clutches of powerful men. No one hears from these women directly after they ‘elope’. Reena and Raveena’s parents are right to question why they suddenly decided to marry men who already had wives and children.\n\nThe Peoples Commission for Minorities’ Rights and the Centre for Social Justice compiled the data of 156 incidents of forced conversions which took place between 2013 and 2019. A vast majority of the girls are minors, with numerous cases of girls as young as 12 years old. Religious groups oppose a minimum age for conversion or marriage on the basis that this is not sanctioned by Islam. Since Sindh has outlawed the marriage of girls under 18, underage girls are taken to Punjab in some cases, where they are married.\n\nSexual intercourse with a girl below the age of 16 is statutory rape and carries a death sentence, or a minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment. There is no defence. Yet in some cases, the production of a conversion certificate and a nikahnama influences law enforcement to pardon the abductors.\n\nPakistan has failed to comply with its international obligations to protect non-Muslim women and girls from exploitation by powerful groups and criminal elements. Even worse is the psychological impact on families of minorities who worry when their daughters venture out, and the culture of intolerance that is promoted when leaders like Mian Mithu celebrate another ‘conversion’ and marriage as a victory for the Muslim faith in the local community. It sends a chilling message to our most vulnerable people — that their girls are not safe.\n\nA Christian man charged with blasphemy for making a theological argument on Facebook that Muslims deemed insulting toward the Islamic prophet Muhammad is now facing a potential death sentence for the post.\n\nThe London-based Centre for Legal Aid, Assistance and Settlement, an interdenominational aid agency serving persecuted Christians in Muslim-majority Pakistan, says that Sohail Masih in the Nowshera Virkan in Punjab province was arrested on Aug. 5.\n\nFollowing a protest by a crowd of enraged Muslims who heard about Masih’s comment online, police officially charged Masih under sections 295-A and 295-C of the Pakistani Penal Code.\n\nSection 295-C prohibits the use of derogatory remarks toward Islam or Muhammad and makes violations punishable by death. It is the same charge leveled against Christian mother Asia Bibi, who was sentenced to death and spent over a decade in prison before her acquittal in 2018.\n\n“This is not the first case of its kind, and several Christians like Imran Nadeem, Nabeel Masih and Patras, Kaleem and Qamar David [died in Jail] have been charged with blasphemy for sharing or having blasphemous contents either on their phone or on their computers,” CLAAS-UK Director Nasir Saeed said in a statement.\n\n“It is difficult to prevent the abuse of social media platforms like WhatsApp when others can easily harass Christians and ‘plant evidence’ on them,” he added. “An example: if someone shares blasphemous content to a Christian’s page, this could result in blasphemy charges against the Christian, even if the Christian did not directly interact with the content.”\n\nAccording to the Union of Catholic Asia News, Masih’s Facebook comment stems from a discussion online about the Islamic sacrifice tradition of Eid-al-Adha, which took place on July 30-31.\n\n“It is not possible that the blood of goats and bulls can wash away sins,” Masih was quoted as writing in a post. “The incident or Miraj [an Islamic belief that Muhammad ascended to Heaven to talk with the prophets] is based on a lie.”\n\nIsra and Miraj is observed annually to honor the Islamic prophet’s nighttime journey from Mecca to a faraway mosque and Muslims’ belief that he ascended to Heaven and was shown Hell.\n\nA local mosque worship leader named Allama Muhammad Abdul Sattar filed a criminal report against Masih.\n\n“The culprit shared the post with two people. They visited my madrasa and showed it,” Sattar was quoted as claiming. “Masih mocked the Miraj incident and the sacrifice which is a principle of Islam. Muslims were extremely hurt.”\n\nThe Punjab Assembly recently passed the Tahaafuz-e-Buniyaad-Islam bill that prohibits the publication of objectionable material.\n\n“It is a very worrying situation as the misuse of the blasphemy law continues to rise and instead of taking steps to stop its misuse, the government continues to pass legislation which makes the existing law more stringent,” Saeed added.\n\nCLAAS-UK reports that local Christians in the area are “scared.” In the past, there has been societal backlash toward Christian communities in Pakistan after blasphemy allegations.\n\nThe organization pointed to past “mayhem” in communities like Gojra, Sanglalhill and Joseph colony where “infuriated masses” attacked and burned several houses and churches as well as killed several people.\n\nPolice officers were deployed to protect the Christian community in Nowshera Virkan after the accusation against Masih, according to CLAAS-UK.\n\nKhalid Shehzad, a Catholic member of the National Lobbying Delegation, told UCA News that meetings were held by locals of the area to “avoid any clash.” However, Shehzad said the “pressure kept mounting” from the radical hardline Islamic organization Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan.\n\nAfter the Pakistan Supreme Court acquitted Bibi in the fall of 2018, TLP organized nationwide protests in opposition to Bibi being freed from the death penalty for blasphemy.\n\n“Their activists outnumber the police, who succumb to pressure and register blasphemy cases,” Shehzad explained. “The victim spends his whole life on trial. Semi-literate pastors teach hate.”\n\nSaeed said that enraged radicals in Pakistan have taken “the law into their own hands” in the past.\n\n“[M]any have begun to believe that killing a blasphemer is their religious duty, as we have recently seen with a man being shot dead in a Peshawar courtroom, with the killer being hailed a hero of Islam,” Saeed stressed.\n\nIn 2014, a Christian couple was burnt to death inside of a brick kiln by an enraged Muslim mob after they were falsely accused of ripping pages out of a Quran.\n\n“In the past, we have seen that uncontrolled masses have attacked the police station, taken the person into police custody and burned him alive in front of the police station,” Saeed added. “But hardly anyone has been brought to justice. Such inaction from the government encourages people to take the law into their own hands and decide the fate of the alleged blasphemer there and then.”\n\nPakistan is ranked as the fifth-worst country in the world when it comes to Christian persecution on Open Doors USA’s 2020 World Watch List.\n\nAt the U.S. State Department’s 2019 Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom last July, Pakistani rights activist Shaan Taseer said that there are as many as 200 people jailed in Pakistan on blasphemy charges.\n\nAt the same function, U.S. National Security Council Senior Director for South and Central Asia Lisa Curtis explained that there are more people imprisoned for blasphemy in Pakistan than in all other countries combined.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that blasphemy laws are not a problem elsewhere.\n\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom on Tuesday condemned the death sentence handed to a 22-year-old Nigerian singer by a Sharia court in Kano state Nigeria. The singer, Yahaya Sharif-Aminu, was accused of insulting Muhammad in a song.\n\nThe past few months have seen much intimidation and threats meted out to the Sikhs in different parts of Pakistan. Sikh girls have been kidnapped and converted and attempts were made to convert a gurdwara. Ironically, this is happening at a time when the Pakistan government has put in an extra effort to woo the Sikhs and invite them across the border from India to the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara.\n\nIn the latest threat, locals in Lahore have threatened to convert Gurdwara Shaheedi Asthan at the busy Naulakha Bazaar into a mosque. A video shows Lahore resident Suhail Butt Attari trying to mobilize people to convert the historic shrine into Masjid Shahid Ganj. The gurdwara has history behind it. It was built to commemorate the sacrifice of Bhai Taru Singh who had stood up to the Mughal rulers against forced conversion.\n\nThe issue has not gone unnoticed in India. Leaders and political parties cutting across party lines have condemned the incident.\n\nMinistry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “A strong protest was lodged with the Pakistan High Commission today on the reported incident whereby Gurdwara Shahidi Asthan, site of martyrdom of Bhai Taru Singh ji at Naulakha Bazaar in Lahore, Pakistan has been claimed as the place of Masjid Shahid Ganj and attempts are being made to convert it to a mosque.”\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh too criticized this attack on the religious rights of the Pakistani Sikhs. In a tweet, he said: “Strongly condemn attempts being made to convert holy Gurdwara Sri Shahidi Asthan in Lahore, site of martyrdom of Bhai Taru Singh Ji, into mosque. Urge @DrSJaishankar to convey Punjab’s concerns in strongest terms to Pakistan to safeguard all Sikh places of reverence.”\n\nFeeling unsafe in Pakistan over denial of rights, thousands of Sikhs and Hindus migrate to India every year. Soon after coming to power, the BJP government had expedited the process of giving visas to Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Owing to denial of minority rights in some neighboring countries, the Indian government had announced that all such persecuted minorities to be provided fast-track Indian citizenship.\n\nHowever, persecution of minorities continues in India’s western neighbor. As recently as January 2020, concerns about the security of Sikhs had been raised when a mob of nearly 400 angry people chanting anti-Sikh slogans had attacked Gurdwara Nankana Sahib near Lahore.\n\nSimilarly, in March 2017, the Sikhs had lodged protests over not being included as a religion in the national census form. After protests and petitioning the country’s courts, the minority group was added as a separate religion in the census. However, when the census was released a couple of years later, Pakistan did not release the data for its minorities, sparking fears that their numbers have reduced owing due to conversions and a steady exodus.\n\nAn anti-minority atmosphere pervades the entire country and is highly toxic. Radesh Singh Tony, a well-known Sikh leader who had been at the forefront of taking up cudgels for minority rights, fled Peshawar for Lahore after he was threatened by armed men. He was not just a Sikh leader but also a local councillor.\n\nFacing threats to his life, Tony made an appeal on Twitter to Sikhs outside Pakistan to help him and his family move out of the country. Later he deleted his account. He also made a video, speaking out about assassination threats to his family.\n\nOne such tweet reads: “I am getting assassination threats from Pak hardliners. The life of my family is in danger Living in Pakistan is very dangerous for my family ?? please please extend me help/refuge any further delay would cause serious troubles for my family @mssirsa @amnesty @hrw @Gulalai_Ismail”\n\nTony was lucky that he escaped. Another prominent Sikh leader Charnjit Singh was shot dead by motorcycle-riding gunmen in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018. He had been working on inter-faith harmony and was a known critic of the Taliban.\n\nComing back to Gurdwara Shaheedi Asthan, conversion threats to minority shrines is not a new phenomenon.\n\nSomething similar had happened in 2016 when the local government in Peshawar carried out an auction of a portion of a historic gurdwara-Bhai Biba Singh. Following the successful auction, the government then asked the local police in 2018 to take possession of the auctioned part of the historic site and hand it over to the individual who had been given control. But after the Sikh community launched a vigorous litigation, which lasted a few years, the Peshawar High Court ordered the Pakistan government to stay the auction.\n\nWhat these incidents prove is that survival of minorities and their heritage in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is a daily struggle. While the Sikhs, Hindus, Ahmadiyas and Christians wage a daily battle to live another day, their cultural and religious heritage is steadily obliterated even as Pakistan lectures the world on upholding human rights in other countries.\n\nDiaspora is understood as a community living in foreign territories that retains a degree of historical, economic or political linkages to its co-ethnics/religionists in the parent state. Kashmiri Diaspora and the unrest in Kashmir create a bizarre synergy, which is generally overlooked in scholarly perspectives. A historical approach to diaspora roles can be understood by India’s efforts to fight against British by mobilising diaspora communities. Trends of external support to anti India movements by diasporic communities have considerably risen lowing the end of Cold War politics, as major powers have considerably reduced their involvement in insurgent activities taking place in foreign lands. Theoretically and practically, the support of such geographically and sociologically distant populations is found to increase the longevity and fortitude of self-determination movements.\n\nKashmiri Diaspora support to create anti India movements is usually extended in the form of political lobbying, fund-raising, foreign remittances and assistance to locals in fleeing the parent state for settling abroad.\n\nKashmiri diaspora is a spatially scattered and ideologically diverse community. It consists of three different groups: Kashmiri Muslims, Kashmiri Pandits and Mirpuri Muslims. A considerable number of Kashmiri Muslims have migrated from Jammu and Kashmir to the Pakistan Administered Kashmir since 1947 partition, however, a large-scale migration was experienced following the 1965 India-Pakistan war. An overwhelming majority of Kashmiri diaspora consists of Mirpuri Kashmiris who migrated from Pakistan to different western states (predominantly the UK) during the 1990s, resulting from internal displacements caused by the construction of Mangla Dam. Kashmiri Pandits are said to have migrated from Kashmir post-1989 Kashmir Insurgency resulting into mass exodus of Pandits from the valley.\n\nMirpuri Muslims, belonging to the Pakistan Administered Kashmir, form the largest chunk of Kashmiri diaspora abroad. Kashmiri Muslims and Kashmiri Pandits, coming from the Indian-held Kashmir, constitute smaller proportions of the Kashmiri diaspora. A major proportion of the Kashmiri diaspora is settled in the United Kingdom (UK). Other than UK, the Kashmiri diaspora is also located in the United States, Canada and Australia.\n\nKashmiri diaspora’s first tangible association was in Birmingham in 1977 which led to the formation of Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). The JKLF traced its root to Kashmir and was/is anti india group. Diasporic activism was concentrated in the UK and remained monopolised by the JKLF until the 1990s. It is no news that JKLF is the same party that was headed by Yasin Malik and I need not remind you the activities his party was engaged in. The JKLF played a major role in turning Kashmir into hell in 90s. Currently, the JKLF is headquartered in Luton, England. However, it has lost much relevance due to leadership crisis and factionalism. But it is not something that we should ignore, the funds are still generated and reach out to Kashmir from England. We shouldn’t be complacent just because Yasin Malik is lodged in a jail.\n\nThe most prominent Kashmiri diasporic organisations pursuing the anti India policies include Jammu Kashmir National Awami Party and United Kashmir People’s National Party.\n\nWhile Kashmiri diaspora was already active, the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in August last year, has given them a renewed vigour. Kashmiri diaspora has taken to different platforms, registering its protest outside the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York and the UN office at Geneva. Most recently, the Indian Republic Day was marked protests across different cities of the USA, UK, and Canada. It should be noted that Kashmiri Diaspora enjoys good relations with pro Khalistan factions of Indian Diaspora and both use each other as and when required to instigate sentiments in India and Kashmir.\n\nFollowing the revocation of Article 370, the mainstream and social media have become key platforms that allow Kashmiri diaspora to reach global audiences. Attributing to strict lockdown in Kashmir, the international and regional media outlets turned to Kashmiri diaspora to gain information about Kashmiris under lockdown. Different social networking websites like Twitter and Instagram have also been employed to propagate hate against India. Post 5 August 2019, social media movements like the “Red Dot Movement,” “Red for Kashmir” and “Bleed for Kashmir” accelerated and became social media trends.\n\nKashmiri diaspora has relied on soft tactics+ Funding through dozens of NGO’s that open up in Kashmir for deploying the hate against India. The mobilisation of Kashmiri diaspora has played a key role in defining the global false narrative of Kashmir issue. The issue has been internationalised like never before, which comes to the credit of the Kashmiri diaspora apart from Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts as well as the ISI’s cunning tactics.\n\nA reception in honour of Tehreek-e-Kashmir TeK (UK) Raja Fahim Kayani was hosted in Pakistan’s Kashmir by Bajwa, Fahim who was on his two-day visit to POK to express the solidarity with the people of Our side of Kashmir.\n\nIn the reception, the installed president of Azad Jammu & Kashmir Supreme Court Bar association said “We welcome you and your team working round the clock in UK but it is also necessary to provide the printed material to the world human rights organisations and other institutions to update them about the mass human rights violations in IOJ&K.”\n\nFahim in this meeting revealed, “Our party in the UK and Europe chapter decided to stage anti-India protests and in this connection we approached the diaspora aimed to motivate them to come out on roads in London and in different countries of Europe.”\n\nKayani went on to say that besides the anti-India protests “we approached members of the British Parliament to speak on the issue and we succeeded” in it. “Dozens of MPs wrote to the British government to take notice of the human rights violations in IOK.”\n\nJammu and Kashmir Salvation Movement (JKSM) Chairman and senior Hurriyat leader Altaf Ahmad Bhat referred the TeK UK as the only voice of voiceless Kashmiris at the international level by saying: “We are indebted to TeK UK and its President Kayani who devoted his whole life for the Kashmir cause is the real hero of Kashmiris’ right to self-determination movement at the international level.”\n\nAltaf Ahmad Bhat said, “The diaspora is even ready to spend their own money for the Kashmir freedom struggle and that must be encouraged.”\n\nLater in April this year, Tehreek-e-Kashmir TeK UK organized an International Tele Conference to address the present situation in Kashmir.\n\nAltaf Ahmad Bhat, senior Hurriyat leader and president Jammu and Kashmir Salvation Movement (JKSM) addressing the conference from Islamabad urged the Human Rights organizations to play their respective role in Kashmir.\n\nPresident of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Sardar Masood Khan said that people of Kashmir are ruthlessly being killed by Indian Army in fake encounters. World should take notice of the genocide of Kashmiris and help to release thousands of Kashmiris languishing in different jails in India. Modi government is not taking any notice of the orders issued by the United Nations for the safety of prisoners during the coronavirus pandemic which is unfortunate.\n\nFurther peddling lies to innocent Kashmiris and world Shadow Minister Afzal Khan MP said that in occupied Kashmir one doctor is for four thousand people and one ventilator is available for 17 thousand people which shows how medical staff is ill equipped in Kashmir to tackle the Covid-19. Moreover, one Indian soldier is on 10 Kashmiris while medical facilities are unsatisfactory and If Covid-19 spreads fastly in IOJ&K the people will die there like cattle.\n\nShaista Safi a human rights activist from Kashmir said that Covid-19 lock down is being used by Indian establishment to change the demography of Kashmir and silent the media. “People are still waiting to get Covid-19 test kits and testing speed has deliberately been kept slow in IOJ&K than the rest of India,” Safi added. Shaista and her likes are few who are creating the anti india narrative that is propagated by the journalists in Kashmir and then the liberal lobby in Delhi. These Diasporic communities are well aware that india is divided and that nationalism is the death of Ghazwa-e-Hind, but their hopes like Pakistan’s rest on the liberal front and the elements within India. A fine example is that of Tony Ashai who spits venom against India and hoped to Rahul Gandhi to be the PM for a free Kashmir. The two have met as well. Tony however is irrelevant to most Kashmiris as he is considered an opportunist who would build homes over the graves of Kashmiris. Tony also enjoys good relations with Shahrukh Khan & Gauri Khan, but that doesn’t imply or state anything else other than the influence these lie promoters and hate mongers enjoy and use against us.\n\nI think the road ahead lies in blocking the Diasporic content in India like we have done with the Sikh Diaspora websites that instigate or propagate hate. There are many websites like Free Kashmir Org that collect donations to promote hate and social media movements against India. The last thing that india can do is to rest and underestimate the Diaspora and its role in keeping Kashmir burning"
