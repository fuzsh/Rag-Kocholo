Away from public glare, these are decaying in caskets.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh's relics have been kept in a dingy room inside Qila Mubarak, which is already on the verge of collapse. These include a cloak given to Baba Triloka; manuscript (Bani), handwritten script of the guru; comb with hair and turban given to Syed Pir Budhu Shah of Sadhaura after the Battle of Bhangani in appreciation of his loyal services and three swords with inscriptions in Punjabi.\n\nThe medals (see box) have been kept in a museum inside Patiala's Sheesh Mahal. These are inaccessible to tourists for the past several years for reasons best known to the authorities concerned. The museum also has a rare collection of chandeliers, which lie defunct, weaponry and photography.\n\nDelay in release of funds and political unwillingness are said to be the main reasons behind the neglect.\n\nBuilt in 1845, the Sheesh Mahal itself also lies in a dilapidated condition. Several walls and a wooden bridge are on the verge of collapse. A portion of the building is in the possession of the Cultural and Tourism Department. The department officials, it has been learnt, allegedly connived with each together to lock a portion the building a few years ago in the name of repair, never to open it again.\n\nMalvinder Singh, scion of Patiala's royal family, said: \"The Sheesh Mahal has visuals depicting the poetry of Keshav, Surdass and Bihari, which are a treat for anybody's eyes. There are paintings that relate with the Hindu and Sikh mythology. These are timeless and the government should take steps to protect them.\"\n\nThe Art and Medal Gallery inside the Sheesh Mahal, which is out of bound for visitors and an outer view of the Sheesh Mahal. (Pictures left)\n\nHarpreet Mohinder Singh Rosha, a member of NGO 'Patiala Our Pride', said: \"The over 3,000 medals collected by the Maharajas of Patiala lie locked inside the medal gallery. The government must explore options to put them on display.\"\n\nBesides these belongings, there are other historic buildings that have been lying in a shambles.\n\nThe Bahadurgarh Fort, located on the Rajpura road, is currently in the possession of Punjab Police, which trains its commandos there. The fort was the outermost point of Patiala and it is said that a tunnel connected it with Qila Mubarak (where the royal family stayed), which would facilitate their exit in case of any emergency.\n\nThe fort walls as well as its interiors are in a bad shape.\n\nRoyal scion Raninder Singh said, \"The Punjab Government should stop selling buildings in Patiala and manage facilitate finances for the maintenance of all historical buildings.\"\n\nPrincipal Secretary (Cultural Affairs) SS Channy said, “An amount of Rs 44 crore had been earmarked for three buildings in Patiala. Of this, Rs 32 crore was for Qila Mubarak, Rs 8 crore for Sheesh Mahal and Rs 4 crore for Bahadurgarh Fort. We will start work soon after the initial project reports are submitted.\"\n\nAsked why the tenth Guru's belongings lied locked in a room inside Qila Muabarak, Channy said he was seeking an appointment from the Chief Minister and only then he could shift them to Virasat-E-Khalsa museum in Anandpur Sahib.\n\nOn delayed work and non-release of funds for the projects in Patiala, Channy said he was new in the department and could not comment on the issue.\n\nRare foreign medals in Sheesh Mahal's gallery\n\nOrder of the Garter' (1348): Studded with diamonds, it is known as the world's oldest historically documented order of chivalry and was founded by King Edward of England\n\nOrder of the Thistle' (1687): It is another order which has been restricted to only 16 men in history\n\nThe Order of the White Elephant': It bears the figures of elephants — it drew inspiration from Buddhist Jataka tales\n\nVictoria Cross: The gallery has five such medals made from canons seized in Crimean war; these replaced the Order of the Garter in 1856\n\nThe Order of the Holy Ghost' (1579); 'Legion of Honour' by Napoleon; 'The Iron Cross', instituted by Prussia for the first time in the war against Napoleon in 1813; a medal containing 14 bars that was awarded to an Artillery driver G.

Of this, Rs 32 crore was for Qila Mubarak, Rs 8 crore for Sheesh Mahal and Rs 4 crore for Bahadurgarh Fort. We will start work soon after the initial project reports are submitted\n\n— SS Channy, Financial Commissioner, Cultural Affairs\n\nAman Sood, Tribune News Service, Patiala, February 11\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSikhs fear part of centuries-old Gurdwara may be demolished\n\nStock photo of Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Pakistan.\n\nThe renovation work on the centuries-old Gurdwara Bhai Biba Singh is nearing completion, but two parts of the building which constitute the musafir khana (lodging for pilgrims) and langar khana (free meal centre) have not been restored, enraging Sikhs who had been waiting for the reopening since long.\n\nWork at Biba Singh started in January 2012. It was initiated by the chairman of the Evacuee Trust Property Board, with a budget of around Rs5.5 million. Biba Singh, within the walled city, is one of the two gurdwaras in the city and has not been used for worship since partition.\n\nDecades of negligence and lack of interest in preserving the gurdwara has done considerable damage to the buildings. The roof of the langar khana has collapsed, while the musafir khanatoo is in a deplorable state. However, under the renovation project, only the main hall used for worship has been renovated, which was in a far better condition.\n\nThe Evacuee Trust Board is now claiming that the langar khana is in fact a Hindu temple established in the premises of the gurdwara and it can therefore not be handed over to the Sikhs.\n\n“The gurdwara building is being restored and two Sikh religious leaders, including a sewadar will be provided for the building and will be paid by the trust,” said Isfaq, a trust board official. “The trust will also maintain the building.” The schedule for making the gurdwara open for worship will be decided by the Sikhs and the trust, he told The Express Tribune.\n\nSikh elder Baba Amarjit Singh, however, said: “Those people who have a thorough knowledge of the Sikh religion and religious buildings would tell you that the two-storey building is amusafir khana and the small beautiful building in front of the main worship hall is indeed alangar khana and not a Hindu temple.”\n\nHe added the gurdwara was established at the time of the 10th Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh, who died in 1708, making this structure at least 300 years old.\n\nUntil 2005, it housed a vocational training centre for girls, which was shifted to a new building following an earthquake. The historical site was declared dangerous and on the verge of collapse.\n\nThere are reports that the land of langar khana was auctioned in the 1996, after which Sikhs protested and the demolition of the building was postponed. Despite repeated attempts, the Minister for Hajj and Auqaf was not available for comment.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 17th, 2013.\n\n↧\n\nExperts state costs of Qila Mubarak rennovation\n\nExpert team visits Qila Mubarak, says Rs 200 cr needed for renovation\n\nFesocoes in need of urgent restoration in the Qila Mubarak\n\nThe 250th foundation year of the historic Qila Mubarak has brought in some good news for the admirers of the fort that has been lying in a shambles due to poor maintenance.\n\nA three-member team of foreign experts today visited Qila Mubarak, the only fort built by a Sikh ruler. They said though the monument was in a dilapidated state, it could still be saved.\n\nWhile discussing methods to save the building from further damage, they said an amount of Rs 200 crore was required for restoration work.\n\nScion of Patiala’s royal family Malvinder Singh accompanied the visiting team, which works under the name Icofort and is associated with the UNESCO.\n\nThe team comprised Dave Bassett (representative of the Fortress Study Group of UK to the international fortress council), Margaret Urquhart (architect and conservation and UK based expert on fortresses and their upkeep) and another restoration expert Hans Smith.\n\nTribune News Service, Patiala, February 22\n\n↧\n\nManuscripts on display at National Museum of Pakistan.\n\nHandwritten Guru Granth Sahib on display at National Museum of Pakistan\n\nOver 50 highly rare and old manuscripts are put on display at a special exhibition inaugurated at the National Museum of Pakistan.\n\nThe exhibition of manuscripts titled “Tasawwuf and Interfaith” organised by the Sindh culture department and the International Peace Committee for Interfaith Harmony will continue till Feb 26.\n\nOne of the 50 manuscripts on display is over 1,000 years old, said to be the oldest one that the museum has, and another one is around 800 years old while the rest are three to four hundred years old.\n\nThe manuscripts include various holy books of different religions, including Islam, Hinduism, Christianity and Sikhism.The manuscripts of the Quran, the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible and the Guru Granth Sahib are on display among other exhibits.The manuscripts of Shah Jo Risalo and texts on Tasawwuf are on display as well.One manuscript was of the Bhagavad Gita with translations in Sanskrit, Persian and Urdu. Another rare book on display was a translation of the Bible and commentary on it by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan.\n\nEarlier, a seminar was held where speakers pointed out that the Indian subcontinent in general and Sindh in particular was the land of love and peace where people of different religions had been living in harmony for the past many centuries.However, over the past few decades, extremism had made inroads into society and intolerance had spread, they added.\n\nThey stressed the need for organising such seminars and workshops so that the message of love, peaceful coexistence and harmony could be spread.They said that efforts should be made to make the country like one the Quaid-i-Azam had envisioned.They said that all religions gave the message of love and peace. But it were only a few misguided souls who misused the name of religion to get their short-term gains and if saner elements of society joined hands and made concerted efforts, society could once again become like it had been earlier where everybody lived in peace and harmony.\n\nThe speakers included Bishop Sadiq Danial, former MPA Michael Javed, Mohammad Ali Manjhi, Aijaz Chajhro, former city government councillor Mangla Sharma, Sardar Ramesh Singh, Mohammad Shah Bokhari, Dr Idrees Ahmed, Nasir Jehangir and others.\n\nSindh Culture Minister Sassui Palijo had been invited as the chief guest at the seminar and to inaugurate the exhibition, but she could not make it owing to other pressing engagements outside the city, said museum chief Mr Bokhari. —\n\nFebruary 22, 2013\n\nKARACHI:, Text by Salman Peerzada/ Photos by Shameen Khan/Dawn.com and Alisia Pek/www.Dawn.com\n\n↧\n\nOp Bluestar memorial nears completion\n\nThe work on the Operation Bluestar Memorial, coming up at the Golden Temple Complex, is fast nearing completion. It may take the final shape even before its deadline of June 6, the anniversary of the Army operation.\n\nBeing constructed near Akal Takht, the memorial’s construction work is almost 80 per cent complete. The Damdami Taksal, which is carrying out the work, claims it will be completed before June 6. Its foundation stone was laid on June 6 last year.\n\nThe memorial is coming up in the form of a gurdwara where Sri Guru Granth Sahib will be installed. The memorial building is octagonal in shape and has doors in three directions. The area of the memorial complex is 60x65 feet, out of which the building has been constructed on 31x31 feet area.\n\nThe memorial’s height has been kept two feet shorter than the adjacent Gurdwara Thara Sahib building to maintain the status of a gurdwara. A dome has not been built atop the memorial as Gurdwara Thara Sahib too doesn’t have it, though the building has been built on the pattern of other buildings in the Golden Temple Complex so that it looks a part of it.\n\nDamdami Taksal chief Baba Harnam Singh Khalsa said the construction part is almost over and white marble had been put on the inner and the outer walls of the memorial. “Currently, the artwork on the marble is underway and soon, precious stones will be engraved on them.”\n\nThe Damdami Taksal has brought special marble from Alwar, which Rajasthani firms usually import from countries like Iran, Afghanistan and Germany. The artisans have come from Agra and Makrana. The designs being made on the marble are identical to that of the Golden Temple and Akal Takht so that there is uniformity in appearance.\n\nA special ceiling has been made so that the voice doesn’t echo inside the building. He said the history of various attacks on the Golden Temple in the past will be engraved on a stone, which will be put up there so as to acquaint the devotees.\n\nPerneet Singh, Tribune News Service\n\nAmritsar, March 7\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nBangla Sahib Gurdwara: Sikh shrine that was once a haveli\n\nDelhi’s list of tourist attractions is incomplete without the mention of Bangla Sahib Gurdwara. Located on Baba Kharak Singh Marg, near Connaught Place, this prominent Sikh shrine is alive with visitors and tourists all the year round. The name — Bangla Sahib — hardly matters to the\n\ndevout, but a general visitor is curious about its origin. This was originally Jaisinghpura Palace, a haveli of the Jaipur kings. It was in 1664 that Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber (Jaipur) hosted Guru Hari Krishan — the boy prophet who became the eighth Sikh Guru in 1661.\n\n“It was a typical haveli and a bangla (an enclosure especially made for special guests) was erected for the guru. The place of guruji sangat (where he addressed the devotees) is now the takht sahib (decorated platform on which Guru Granth Sahib is kept),” says Gyani Kuldeep Singh of the gurdwara.\n\nThe guru stayed for about 8-10 months at a time of cholera and chicken pox epidemics. “He sat with his feet dipped in a small pond of water, which people — both Hindus and Muslims — partook and was saved. It is still there next to the shrine,” Singh said.\n\nAfter Independence, the place saw rapid changes. An artificial pond was added. Beautiful golden filigree work adorning the sanctum sanctorum were also put in place.\n\nNivedita Khandekar, Hindustan Times\n\nNew Delhi, March 17, 2013\n\n↧\n\nRare Panjabi manuscripts discovered by UK heritage group.\n\nA number of Sikh and Hindu Gurmukhi Manuscripts have been discovered in a Russian Library.\n\nAdi Guru Granth Sahib ji, f. 1, showing the Jap ji Sahib, a similar manuscript is at the Oriental Institute Library, Russia.\n\nResearchers at Panjab Cultural Association (PCA) in the UK have recently discovered around 100 Gurmukhi Manuscripts at the Oriental Institute in St Petersburg.\n\nThe manuscripts were originally cataloged in Russian by G.A.

This was surprising for it was constructed around the year 1830 and was then fully 160 years old. The marble plaque on the façade, fixed by some thoughtful British civil servant after the annexation of Punjab read, “Summer residence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, AD 1830-1837”.\n\nInspired by European architecture, the house was unlike a traditional vernacular residence. It had verandas on two sides with rooms on the remaining two and a central atrium. The side rooms and the verandas had lower roofs while that of the central foyer’s was higher. The rafters, door and window frames and every other timber fixture were first class teak.\n\nThe house sat on the east bank of the Chenab River, just outside Rasulnagar (Gujranwala district), right by the ancient ferry where a young Ranjit Singh had deprived the Afghans of the Zamzama that now sits outside Lahore Museum. Here, long after he had defeated the Afghans and put an end to their predatory raids, the Maharaja would have reposed with his customary glass of strong drink, watching the brown waters of the Chenab roll past forever and ever.\n\nThis house became part of my book Gujranwala: The Glory That Was (1992). It also featured in one of the episodes of my PTV documentary series “Nagri, nagri ghoom musafir” produced during 1998-1999. I returned to the house a number of times thereafter when I was pressing for it to be taken over by the district administration to turn it into a library or a museum so that it may be preserved forever.\n\nBut we, the people of Pakistan, have no connection with the dharti. We have severed the umbilical that would bond us with the motherland to give us a sense of belonging and pride. Without the connection, we drift aimlessly in a wasteland harbouring vague and false notions of Arab or Central Asiatic ancestry. The disconnect is so strong that nothing that belongs to this land turns us on. We simply do not care.\n\nLast August, I returned to Rasulnagar again to digitally preserve Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s house. What I beheld left me in tears. The house that had withstood every vagary of nature until about 2004, was a ruined hulk. The roof was gone; every single door, window and ventilator removed. What was once the interior of the house was now a pile of debris.\n\nUntil 2004, the house stood in open fields. But this time round, there was next to the historical building, a semi-permanent house inhabited by what seemed to be a family of gypsies. They had plastered the walls of the Maharaja’s house with cow dung patties. No one seemed to know who had laid low this historic building. Neither the gypsies nor the men minding the nearby tube well. In fact, one man even ventured that the building had been in that state since the time of his ancestors!\n\nThough I do not know who to blame for the crime, I know the teak fixtures of the building now adorn the house of some well-connected thug. When he or his men started to dismantle this historic building which should have been part of the national heritage, the DCO and his minions simply looked away. No one bothered as it went down bit by bit.\n\nRasulnagar is historically a very interesting place because it sat on a busy ford. An elderly ferryman once told me that until well into the 1950s, there used to be fully 100 boats catering to the back and forth traffic. Moreover, this was the very place where Ranjit Singh, just 19-year-old and leading a small force, had routed a much larger Afghan army to bring their periodic raids to an end.\n\nThis also is the place where the Sikhs under Sher Singh Atariwala, 15,000-strong, fought a desperate battle against the British in November 1848. The British prevailed, the Sikhs withdrew to the west of the river to fight and lose their final battle two months later at Chillianwala.\n\nAll this — and more — makes Rasulnagar a tourist destination for the history buff. But we do not belong to this land, so what do we do with our heritage? We destroy it.\n\nThe Express Tribune, March 9th, 2013.\n\nBy Salman Rashid\n\nThe writer is author, most recently, of The Apricot Road to Yarkand (Sang-e-Meel, 2011) and a member of the Royal Geographical Society salman.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHolla Mohalla 2013 in pictures.\n\nThe SIKH NUGGET presents the annual round up of the Holla Mohalla Celebrations for 2013.\n\nNihangs show their Tent pegging Skills at Anandpur Sahib.\n\nBoys perform Gatka during a holy procession near Keshgarh Sahib Gurdwara.\n\n‘Panj pyaras’ lead Nagar kirtan at Anandpur Sahib\n\nA Sikh boy practice his Archery Skills at Anandpur Sahib\n\nA magnificent display of horse riding and martial art skills by thousands of Nihangs marked the last day of the six-day historic Hola Mohalla festival at Anandpur Sahib.

So I decided to pick a location which was least visited by foreigners and the media in general. I contemplated in repeating the success of my last film with a subject that was primarily similar to the theme of my last film.\n\nSo after months of planning we decided to visit Myanmar or Burma as it was known earlier, having finally obtained our visas we travelled to Myanmar with a crew of 6 from India and Thailand arriving in the capital city of Yangon, formerly known as Rangoon. This has been a country totally isolated from the rest of the world. Only a few years ago there was mass unrest against four decades of military rule adverse to any political change. The military regime controlled the country with an iron fist and its democratic leader of the opposition party Aung San Suu Kyi is the chairperson of the National League for Democracy (NLD) in Burma. In the 1990 general election, the NLD won 59% of the national votes and 81% of the seats in Parliament. She had however, already been detained under house arrest before the elections. She remained under house arrest in Burma for almost 15 of the 21 years from 20 July 1989 until her most recent release on 13 November 2010 becoming one of the world's most prominent political prisoners.\n\nMy objective of being in Myanmar was to meet up with the Indian Sikh community who have been living here since the 1880’s when the British had annexed Upper Burma in 1885 to the British Indian Empire. The deposed Burmese King Thibaw was later exiled to India where he later died in 1916. Our first glimpse of this amazing place was finding just how clean and pollution free this city was compared to cities in the neighbouring countries. Our guide Chotu Ram, a Burmese Sikh who resembled more of a Chinese looking man wearing traditional Burmese attire greeted us at our hotel and wasted no time in taking us to one of Myanmar’s leading attractions – the famous 2500 year old historical Shwe Dagon Pagoda.\n\nThis was the site where thousands of anti-government protestors would converge to hold their mass rallies against the military junta back in 2007. Foreigners are restricted in entering this scared site but our determined Sikh guide managed to obtain permission to enter this heritage site and we managed to film inside the temple complex comprising of numerous adjoining Buddhist temples with their carved innate design made out of gold, it surely was an awesome experience for us.\n\nBurmese Gurdwara(r)\n\nDespite the heat the walk around the marble floor was unbearable but we persevered and continued as the views every few yards were just amazing. The following day we headed to the main Sikh temple or gurdwara built in 1897 by the Sikhs employed in the British Indian army. There are apparently four Sikh temples in Yangon but the one we visited was the oldest, although much smaller in size to the one visited in Afghanistan this one had recently been refurbished by the local Sikh community at a considerable cost. Here the Sikh community are thriving unlike in Afghanistan where they are struggling for survival. I was somewhat relieved that this minority community residing in a tolerant Buddhist nation are revered by the locals who mingle amongst the Sikhs in such cordial manners.\n\nHere the Sikhs are a success, although small in numbers yet most prominent in the field of transport, trade and commerce. Young Sikh children all maintain the tradition of retaining their long hair unlike in the western world where a majority of Sikhs have become clean shaven adapting themselves of becoming the so called modern Sikhs. The Sikh temple hold Punjabi classes each day for four hours for the children who are all well versed in Punjabi yet speak mainly in Burmese amongst themselves. We were given a most gracious welcome by the members of the Sikh community, whose appearances are far from the usual looking Sikhs we have back in London or India. Their features are somewhat oriental looking, with their turbans tied up in a round fashion and not pointed at the front as was mine. The striking feature of their attire is that all the Sikh males wear a lungi or dhoti, it’s the national dress of the Burmese I guess as everyone wears it. It is quite odd to see six foot tall Sikhs compared to the local Burmese males who are so much smaller in height all wearing lunghis with their dark complexions. The Sikh women all wear the traditional Burmese dress made out of Silk or cotton seldom did I witness any women wearing a colourful bright Punjabi suit as they do back in India or England.\n\nI recall from history that the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was exiled here by the British after the infamous rebellion back in 1857. I was eager to visit his shrine and to retrace the historical journey to his last resting place not far from our hotel. The attendant was very kind to translate some of the poetry that the Mughal Emperor had written while in exile and even took us to the tomb where he laid buried. He lifted the Silk sheet from the tomb which revealed the original structure of the tomb built by the British, it was a surreal moment. Apparently the attendant told me that his ancestors had served the Mughal Emperor since his arrival in 1857, his son would take over the care of the shrine after his death. After a few days in Yangon we took the overnight bus to Mandalay the former historical capital of Upper Burma. The journey took 10 hours but to our amazement the bus was very comfortable like being on the National Express in England. This was the place where the British conquered the country in 1885 after the 3rd Anglo-Burmese war ended. The city is laid out on a grid system marked with a huge fortress in the centre which is square in plan and surrounded by water on all four sides.\n\nShrine of Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar\n\nEach side of the fort is about three kilometres long and every 400 years is a watchtower in the shape of a small pagoda which is quite impressive. Inside the fort is the Royal palace where King Thibaw resided before his exile to India in 1886. Not much of the historical artefacts or treasures exist from that period, having filmed inside the palace we were disappointed with the emptiness of the palace although a huge statue of King Thibaw was present with his queen Supayalat. However, we headed to Mandalay Hill overlooking the city having inspiring views of the fort. We met the Sikhs of Mandalay where they mainly reside in the locality of Theyeze adjacent to the Sikh temple. Several Sikh families live here amongst the local Burmese, many running small businesses and shops. Our host in Mandalay was Mr Sukhdev Singh, a resident of Yangon who was visiting his family and is also the President of the religious council of Sikhs of Myanmar. As my camera crew had become tired of consuming rice since our arrival I urged my host whether ‘roti’ or ‘chappatis’ could be available, to our delight he had already arranged lunch at the home of a local Sikh family.\n\nOur last day in Mandalay was completed by a visit to the historical Irrawaddy River which bisects the country from north to south. We managed to arrange a local boat which took us far out to the river where with my host Mr Sukhdev Singh we took a nostalgic trip back to the 1940’s when during WW2 the Japanese Army had advanced into Burma from Malaya. As we know thousands of Indians had enlisted into the British Indian Army and had fought Japanese soldiers in the jungles of this hostile region. In 1942 Sikh soldiers from the 7th Indian Army Division fought Japanese soldiers from advancing into the Indian territory of Kohima along the Irrawaddy River where many lost their lives. It was a poignant moment for me and members of my camera crew talking about those dark moments of WW2. Those who perished were Sikh soldiers barely in their twenties but they withstood the Japanese onslaught and saved the British Indian Empire from humiliation and defeat.\n\nI expected Myanmar to be a country like India or Bangladesh, full of chaos and red tape but how wrong I was my overall view of this stunning country is that it is far developed as I initially imagined. It’s a striking country full of golden pagodas and palm trees, people are so cordial and the hospitality of the Sikh community made our visit indeed so comfortable, it makes me proud knowing they are accepted with respect as the Burmese Sikhs of Myanmar.

The birth place of their holy prophet, Baba Guru Nanak. There are relics of Sikhism all around as Baba had spent the early part of his life in this town situated in the middle of Rachna Doab. Each of these relics later became a place of worship and a pilgrimage point.\n\nThe young Nanak’s father gave him 20 rupees to start a business of his own but he instead donated it to the poor and the hungry; and to avoid the admonishment from his father, hid under a collection of vann bushes which latter became Gurudawar Tamboo Sahab. Tamboo in Punjabi means a protective roof-like cover.\n\nI stayed under the same cover on my second night out with my friend Kalyan Singh who is a lecturer of Punjabi at the Government College, Gujranwala. Punjabi is sacred to Sikhs as it is the language of their holy book, Granth Sahab. But the lingua franca of the 200 plus Sikh families here is Pashto as almost all of them have migrated from tribal areas and Pakhtunkhwa. Nankana Sahab is their last hope. They are trying to take refuge under this tamboo of which barely a piece is left.\n\nSpending some time with them, I realised that all of their time references are very different from the rest of us, and that is a sorry tale in itself. If you ask some to narrate his or her life story, it will go like this, “After the 1971 Indo-Pak war, my sister’s family migrated from Peshawar, at the demolishing of the Babri mosque in 1992, many of the brothers also quit and my parents finally moved out after the 9/11.”\n\nSadly, they are not yet short of new time markers of the same kind. I met Sher Singh here who migrated from Dera Bugti some five years ago, after the armed conflict there made it impossible for them to survive.\n\nThis tiny community living under the shadow of the walls of Gurudwaras faces grave problems. Gurudwaras are sacred for Sikhs but for the most Muslims of Nankana, they are real estate, profitable plots of land. There are businesses and residences settled all over the occupied land and the promotion of religious intolerance makes simple business sense for these occupants.\n\nNo politician is ready to take up the issue. The Sikh votes are too few and the community too insecure and vulnerable to take any political sides. Their depoliticisation is enhanced by their disenfranchisement which is a result of the difficulties that they face in getting an identity card.\n\nThere are some legal complications related to their migration from tribal areas; they themselves do not enjoy the status equivalent to that of fully settled areas. But most of the time, it is the ‘cautious’ attitude of the officers that makes simple services like securing a B form, that makes your children legal citizens, from the local office of NADRA a life time of effort. Nobody wants to take risks or, to be blunt, no officer wants to be quizzed by the intelligence agencies, when it is so much easier to just shoo away a non-Muslim.\n\nKalyan Singh who is pursuing his doctorate at tge Punjab University had bruises on his hands and face the day I met him. He told me that while in a government office today, he was shoved and pushed to the ground by a stranger for nothing. “It happens many a times, people misbehave with us in public for the fun of it,” he told me with a grim face. I am afraid that some must do it for a sawab as well.\n\nAnd if you think that I am being a cynic, I have concrete evidence to prove you wrong.\n\nA massive mosque is under construction just next to Gurudwara Janam Asthan. Its minaret is so tall that it could not be constructed the way minarets of most mosques are. So, it has a special design that enables the maulanas to snarl at this minuscule community from the heights of their hateful selves. The mosque is designed to dwarf the Gurudwara. A further element of insult, that is cast in concrete is that the prayer compound of the mosque is constructed on an unusually high platform, that is higher than the highest point of the prayer hall of the Gurudwara. So that the Muslims can remain a floor above. Does that make them nearer to God?\n\nThe eateries in the entire bazaar that is frequented by the local Sikhs either plainly refuse to serve them or have separate cups and glasses for them. Kalyan Singh who has spent almost his entire here can even tell you which rehri wala will serve him and which won’t.\n\nThe more debilitating of their problems are again about the documentation of their citizenship status. There are cases when a child was not able to sit for their matriculation the matric exam for want of a B form.\n\nThe two glasses in front are reserved for Sikhs while the cups are for Muslims.\n\nMost Sikh children study in a school that is set up especially by their community but they admit children of other faiths as well. It is headed by a Muslim educationist and the teachers are Muslims too. The school teaches the subject of Islamiyat to all children as no alternative to this subject exists in the government prescribed syllabi.\n\nJust when I was struggling to invent hope in this hopeless environment, I found it. A tale of two friends – may it blossom for ever. Meet Mahnoor and Balvinder Kaur:\n\nMy account will not be complete unless I share with you a shred of the past that I found at the foot rest of Gurudwara Tamboo Sahab. A meek indication of what it used to be in the good old times. I am not sharing with you the recording of the talk I had with him, just to avoid some unwarranted reactions.\n\nHe called himself a dervish who has come to pay a tribute to Baba Guru Nanak and was not ready to differentiate on the basis that Baba was not a Muslim. “He was an Allah-wala of a very high stature. That’s all I know,” he concluded.\n\n↧\n\nHe wants to promote Sikh culture, heritage through his art\n\nCity-based paper artist Gurpreet Singh, creating art from varied items, moulding paper into exciting and interesting pieces of art for 11 years, has a whooping 13 international and seven national records to his credit.\n\nThe artist, an interior designer by profession, is probably among very few specialised paper artists in Punjab. He has created a miniature replica of the Golden Temple, Taj Mahal and the White House among others and has recently created a replica of the Great Wall of China to commemorate the May Day.\n\n“It was a significant landmark and I wanted to commemorate the amount of labour put into constructing it,” said the artist.\n\nThis is not the first piece of perfection from the 31-year-old artist. Gurpreet’s earlier works include miniature models of Nankana Sahib, the smallest turban weighing seven grams and other symbols of Sikh heritage.\n\n“My aim is to promote the culture and heritage of Sikhism through my art. I have displayed my work at various art exhibitions and festivals across the country and my works have been appreciated,” he says.\n\nHe feels that more should be done to promote the art. “There are some 115-odd paper artists in the world and most are from South Asia. The famous Chinese paper art is all about cutting the paper into various patterns but a lot of Indian artists specialise in creating things out of paper. This should be encouraged,” he says.\n\nFor his miniature version of the Golden Temple, Gurpreet has installed it with lights and live gurbani. “I am playing with the idea of putting electronic Gurbani and lightings so as to give it an authentic appeal,” he says. He wishes to display the replica at the upcoming museum inside the Darbar Saheb premises.\n\nTribune News service, Amritsar, May 3\n\n↧"
