Before this, we had only two gurdwaras in Peshawar, Gurdwara Johgan Shah in Saddar and another in RA Bazaar. The gurdwara in RA Bazaar mostly remain closed as security forces are deployed there,” Pakistan Sikh Community (PSC) Chairperson Radesh Singh Tony told The Express Tribune.\n\nEven though many parts of Pakistan including Punjab and Sindh had a thriving Sikh population before 1947, a majority of them migrated to the Indian side following the partition."
