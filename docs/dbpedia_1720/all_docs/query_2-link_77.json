        "text": "Guardian of Sikh pride\n\nBut Harsimrat is more than the sum of her surnames. As she showed in her powerful speech in the Lok Sabha in 2009, she can be impassioned about the status of victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and also get enraged by cartoons lampooning politicians in school textbook.\n\nIn particular, she has set herself up as a guardian of Sikh pride, trying hard not to alienate the conventional voter – she always wears salwar kameez and covers her head with a dupatta. The story goes that when former prime minister Manmohan Singh invited her to meet former US president Barack Obama in 2010, she wore a silk sari, which caused Harsimrat’s fans to rant about her having betrayed her Punjabi heritage.\n\nFor Harsimrat, tradition is everything. “The benchmark of my politics is that my father-in-law should not be ashamed of me. People should not say Badal sahib ki daughter-in-law and shake their heads,” she had said during an interview with India Today. Not surprisingly, back home in her constituency Bathinda, she is known as Biba (the good girl). Let’s just call her the 4B (Bahu, Biwi, Beti and Behen) Biba.\n\nYet, Harsimrat was brought up in the liberal environment of Delhi, going to Loreto School and then studying textile design at South Delhi Polytechnic for Women. When she was married to Sukhbir Singh Badal in 1991, the understanding was that he would not enter politics. Within two years of their marriage, he promptly did so. Harsimrat laughs at this now. “I remember saying to myself: ‘You idiot. You married a politician’s son. What else did you think would happen?’ she said in an interview to India Today.\n\nAlso read: Modi sticks with Harsimrat Kaur Badal, picks her over husband Sukhbir\n\nPolitical plunge & success\n\nHaving raised three children in relative anonymity as a mostly single mother, while her husband hurled himself into full-time politics, she was persuaded by her family to stand as the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate from Bathinda when challenged to name a family member by current chief minister Amarinder Singh. She defeated his son, Raninder Singh, and then won again in 2014. This year, she had a tough contest against two-time Congress MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Punjab Ekta Party chief Sukhpal Singh Khaira.\n\nClearly, the people of Bathinda know what’s good for them. In the last 10 years, according to India Today, she has transformed what was once “the dusty ‘back of beyond’, among Punjab’s backward areas, and shunned as a “punishment posting”. Bathinda, it said in 2014, “is suddenly peeking at new possibilities with multiplexes and a maze of flyovers and underbridges”. The constituency has a 200-bed Max Super Speciality Hospital, set up in 2011, a public RO system for filtered drinking water in all 652 villages, a Guru Gobind Singh Refinery set up by HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited (HMEL) at Phulokhari village, and a Vedanta thermal power plant at Banawala village.\n\nA member of what NewsX anchor Priya Sahgal calls the Daughters and Wives (DAWs) club in Parliament (which includes her friends NCP’s Supriya Sule and DMK’s Kanimozhi), Harsimrat has nevertheless made women’s issues her particular cause. Says Sahgal, the author of The Contenders: Who Will Lead India Tomorrow, where she has profiled Harsimrat as well, calling her ‘The Firebrand from Punjab’: “It was she who convinced her father-in-law to recruit women in the Punjab police force, and again persuaded her husband to organise kabaddi matches for women as well as men, and argued against the disparity in prize money, Rs 2 crore for men and Rs 50,000 for women.”\n\nShe had some perks as the ‘First Daughter-in-Law’ too. Snarky commentators point to the April 2013 issue of the state information department magazine, Advance, which put her on the cover, with an accompanying article written by then state media adviser, Harcharan Singh Bains, describing her as “fragile yet focused” and “Princess Diana and Mother Teresa’s spirit reborn as one”.\n\nPolitics is personal\n\nHer politics is personal, rather than ideological. Her strong sentiments on the 1984 riots stem from her own experience of hiding in the family’s servant quarters as a young college girl along with her two brothers and then 85-year-old grandfather. Her anger against textbooks comes from what her children had to study.\n\nShe is feisty and outspoken, which is quite a contrast to her taciturn husband, who will be joining her in the Lok Sabha this time, having won from Firozpur.\n\nThey may no longer have the state at their beck and call as they did when “Daddy” was in power, but they will certainly be the Capital’s power couple to watch. And with their penchant of throwing big parties for friends and media, offering the best cuisine from their state and a round or two of gidda (a traditional Punjabi dance which she loves as seen here), they will no doubt be on top of the popularity charts.\n\nHarsimrat will have to show the same skills of making friends and influencing people when it comes to her passion project – making the lives of Indian farmers better.\n\nAlso read: Why is Harsimrat Kaur Badal so angry?\n\nShe has started the annual World Food India event, a success in terms of grabbing eyeballs as well as investment proposals. She has also established a NABARD fund and got food processing units classified as an agricultural lending under the priority sector. Some of the other key initiatives of the food processing ministry include the Operation Greens scheme to fix prices of tomatoes, onions and potatoes, getting 17 Mega Food Parks operational and fast-tracking approvals for cold chains.\n\nShe has spoken at length on how India is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world, yet only 3 per cent of it is processed, and as much as 18 per cent of it is wasted. In 2016, she managed to get 100 per cent FDI in trading of food products manufactured and produced in the country, which the Swadeshi Jagran Manch is bitterly opposed to.\n\nBut she considers it her biggest achievement, pointing out how it will boost employment, cut wastage and control food inflation.\n\nIn 2012, she said: “My father-in-law rarely speaks, my husband is conservative, and I can’t stop talking”.\n\nShe will have to do more than that now. But given the diplomatic skills she has displayed, keeping her cool when the Maharashtra government decided to appropriate the right to appoint the president of the managing committee of Takht Hazur Sahib and when negotiations over the Lok Sabha seats between the BJP and her party became intense, she should be fine.\n\nThe author is a senior journalist.
