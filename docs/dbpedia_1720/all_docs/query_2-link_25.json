        "text": "From Heartbreak to Triumph: Sardarji's Inspiring Journey of Resilience and Renewal at 75 When his wife passed away in 1999, he was heartbroken and realized just how dependent he had been on her. Manjeet had managed everything— the house, the kids, and even ran the publishing business alongside him. He often wondered how she had done it all. After she was gone, he found himself in complete disarray, and the company they built together fell apart. He felt like giving up on life in his 50s. He spiraled into depression and began overeating, wasting his life away on the couch. He felt worthless, as if he had no reason to carry on, and was ashamed of being pitied by others, including his own children. He hadn’t left his home in years and didn’t even know who his neighbors were. Somewhere along the way, he had lost himself. But his children wouldn't let him stay down. They urged him to take one step, any step, towards living again. So, after 30 years, in his 60s, he went for a jog. He was unfit—his breath gave way, and his body ached afterward. Yet, for the first time in a long while, he had something to look forward to. Every evening, he found himself excited to put on his running shoes. He set small goals, like completing 2 kilometers without stopping. He even participated in a 1500-meter marathon in the senior citizen category. Though he thought he’d win, he placed 5th, but that was the turning point. Determined to do better, he began waking up at 5 AM, pushing himself to run. Within a year, he was running 15-20 kilometers in one go. He then enrolled in a 10-kilometer marathon where he ran alongside people half his age. When they said, \"Uncle, it’s inspiring that you’re even participating,\" he replied, \"Participating? I’m here to win!\" As he ran, he thought of Manjeet, wanting to win for her—and he did, placing 1st. At 66, he joined a gym. Though youngsters looked at him as if he should have been enjoying his retirement, he felt like he had a new lease on life. From 5 to 8 AM, he trained, worked with his kids on a new business, and then returned to the gym from 7 to 10 PM. He even set a record at his gym by completing 584 pushups. The gym owner told him, \"Sir, we’re making you our brand ambassador,\" and he was ecstatic. Now, at 75, he is fitter than ever and runs a clothing company with his sons. Every day, he looks at Manjeet’s picture, hoping she’s proud of him. Every day, he strives to be strong like her. \"Look, Manjeet,\" he thinks, \"I didn’t give up, even when I hit rock bottom.\"\n\n5-Year-Old Sikh Boy Becomes Youngest Asian to Conquer Mount Kilimanjaro, Raising the Nishan Sahib at Africa’s Highest Peak At just five years old, Teghbir Singh, a proud young Sikh from Ropar, Punjab, has achieved a remarkable milestone by becoming the youngest Asian Sikh to scale Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa. He now joins Serbian Ognjen Zivkovic as the youngest in the world to conquer this towering challenge. Teghbir, a 1st grade student at Shiwalik Public School, embarked on this spiritual and physical journey on August 18, reaching the summit on August 23. Despite facing temperatures plunging to -10°C and the challenges of altitude sickness, Teghbir's resilience and faith guided him to the top. Under the guidance of his coach, Bikramjit Singh Ghuman, his training focused on strengthening his cardiovascular health and increasing his lung capacity, essential for coping with the high altitudes. This achievement is even more significant, reflecting the strength and spirit of Sikhi, as Teghbir carried with him the teachings of Guru Nanak on this journey. His father, Sukhinderdeep Singh, who accompanied him along with a dedicated crew, emphasized how their faith provided strength during the trek. His mother, Dr. Manpreet Kaur, ensured that Teghbir maintained a strict diet to sustain his physical stamina, all while holding firm to their Sikh values. Teghbir’s ascent to the peak is not only a personal triumph but also a testament to the enduring spirit of the Sikh community, demonstrating that with faith, discipline, and courage, even the youngest among us can achieve the extraordinary. The family is set to return to India on August 30, with the Nishan Sahib proudly held high, symbolizing this incredible achievement."
