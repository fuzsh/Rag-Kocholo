        "text": "Senator Chuck Schumer of New York joins the gathering and shares his views on how Sikh community has always been an integral part of the American society\n\nOur Bureau\n\nNew York NY\n\nTurban Day was celebrated this year on May 6 at Times Square, as an expression of Sikh faith and commitment to serve humanity. The purpose of organizing this event every year is to bring awareness among all citizens about Turban and its value in Sikh faith.\n\n“Considering the unfortunate discrimination and hate crimes faced by Sikhs who wear or tie turbans, we believe that it is more important than ever to break down barriers between different communities. This event represents a unique opportunity to tackle these issues and unite people in the spirit of respect and education,” said a statement from the organizers of the event.\n\nTurban Day at Times Square is organized by Turban Day Inc. and is the largest turban tying event in the world. “We have been running this event since 2016 and have tied more than 20,000 turbans over the years with the goals of educating more people. We firmly believe that knowledge and understanding are the most effective tools for combatting discrimination and building bridges between communities,” the organizers said.\n\n“The turban is an integral part of Sikh identity and has been worn by Sikhs for centuries. It not only represents the core values of our faith, but also signifies the responsibility to protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their background, race, or religion. By participating in Turban Day, people who might not know can learn more about the importance of the Sikh turban.”\n\nTo support this event and Sikh community in the US, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York took to the stage and shared his views on how Sikh community has always been an integral part of the American society. “We love the Sikh community, and it is a beautiful community. We welcome you as New Yorker’s and as Americans,” the Senator said.\n\n“You work hard, you believe in family, you have a great faith, and you help build and create our great community,” the Senator said mentioning about passing the Asian Anti Hate crime bill to prosecute any action of hate, bigotry, and violence. He showed his solidarity to the Sikh community by wearing the Turban and shook a leg to famous Punjabi music.\n\nBesides tying more than 2,000 colorful turbans on any fellow human coming from any background, skin color, religion and status, there were multiple artists from the Sikh community showcasing their culture and heritage.\n\nYoung musicians from the Sikh Symphony California performed 31 ragas in 13 different taals (beats) using multiple Indian classical string instruments such as sitar, rabab, taus and tabla. Musician Biba Singh performed some popular numbers and multiple artists performed Bhangra and folk dance Gidda bringing attendees together to dance and enjoy music.\n\nFamous Bollywood artist Manmeet Singh(actor/writer/director) had a message for everyone. “For a Sikh the turban represents love, hard work and humility. When seen from away, for anyone in distress it indicates that they can come to a Sikh and seek help and support and no matter what the situation is they will be assisted,” he said."
