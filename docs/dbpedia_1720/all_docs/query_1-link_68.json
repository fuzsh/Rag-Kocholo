        "text": "#didyouknow Mandanas have graced walls and floors of Indian homes since time immemorial. A visual folk art form from the states of #rajasthan and #madhyapradesh , it is considered to be one of the oldest surviving folk art forms. As you would know, the art form has been shared between the womenfolk through generations. In Rajasthan, Mandana art is predominantly found east of the Aravallis in districts such as #bharatpur, #bundi, #jaipur , #alwar , Hadoti, #tonk, #bhilwara and Sawai-Madhopur. Coming to the traditional materials used in #mandana all are sourced from natural resources. The colour scheme found in Mandana is mostly red and white, though artists such as Vidya Soni take the artistic leap to create new versions. #red is made from ‚ÄúGeru Mitti‚Äù and #white is made from ‚Äú Khadiya‚Äù or ‚ÄúKhariya Mitti‚Äù. Chalk, lime or white clay are also seen as other sources for making white colour as well. The red colour is obtained by mixing cow dung, yellow mud or ‚ÄúPeeli mitti‚Äù and Geru or ‚ÄúHimrich‚Äù. It is said that the white in a #mandana represents purity whereas red is supposed to represent fertility. Another important aspect that forms part of creating a traditional #mandana is that is made with the hand. Walls and floors are prepped and mandanas are drawn fully with hands. Though, in today‚Äôs urban settings, traditional Mandanas have declined drastically they still live on in smaller villages but are hard to locate.\n\nRecently I came across this post on Sambalpuri #Saree. But unlike everyone else, I had a different point of view, While Radhika Gupta had beautifully shared her thoughts inspiring handloom or #ikat saree brand, I realized that people who are even selling sarees had no clue of its #origin and originality (i realized by reading comments on post), Many people may argue that they are just #marketing or #selling the #craft #products online, why do they know details? The reason being crafts are not an ordinary product category, it falls under cultural products and geographical indication (#GI) Government of #India has been very stringent on the point of origin, so that required credit can go back to the practicing community and cluster, Before selling, it is important to establish a right product transparency, so that weavers, #weaving these products can get due #credits, The irony is it has been successfully marketed as Sambalpuri Ikat instead of Bargarh Ikat. It is surprising to note, that these sarees are still made in and around Bargarh by 25,000 #weavers across various #villages (Bargarh is a small town near Sambalpur), And of course, some truth about the Bargarh cluster: - 70-80% are #women weavers supporting their farmer husbands, or parents for extra income - 30% of the weavers approach the trader for #funds, which is a debt trap - 65% of the weavers don‚Äôt know where their products are finally sold - 30% of weavers have tried to sell their product directly to end customers, but have failed - Only 10% of the products are sold directly to the #customers - Only 10% have had some #designer or #design access - Majority of the selling through #traders at Local Haat, Balijori Haat etc - Tie & Dye is the most common #training that weavers aspire, whereas they are using naphthol dyes etc that are banned - Only 15% use FB, WhatsApp, and YouTube with others no technological support It is the only weaving cluster in the country with maximum awards (45 National Awards, 52-State Awards, two Sant Kabir Awards and two Padma Shri honors). As Craft #Conscious #Society we should look at ‚ÄòPoint of Origin‚Äô and 'Geographical Indications' very seriously, Because that would bring the untold #stories of such #rare #heritage, #culture and #craftsperson These sarees hold special value because of the temple borders, which makes it 'Mystical #Textile Heritage' from #Orissa, Inspired from Jaganath Puri Temple it brings good omen and god's blessings to the wearer, when they are draped with these mystical weaves (don‚Äôt know how many people know this, at least weavers weave with such a belief). Besides building e-commerce platform, #brands or retail in #Handloom, we must give 'due credits' to the weavers who has been weaving these 'rare heritage' for generations. In any case in absence of money and credit most of these artisans are leaving or will leave eventually, let‚Äôs realize this before it is too late!\n\nThreads of Culture Malati,a housewife from a village name Bataspur, seated on a chair, and thinks how to increase his business as a weaver. Last 7 months she didn't earn sufficient amount for her livelihood. Main challange is, ‚úîÔ∏è The prevalence of machine made goods has lured many weavers away many weaving techniques. ‚úîÔ∏èAnother challenge is fast changing fashion and design preference. Most of the weavers work at home in village and rural areas. ‚úîÔ∏èFew of them have formal training in the design and marketing products but this can only fulfill the demand for the urban centres. ‚úîÔ∏èFor Global Market they need to more training and professionalism. Opportunity Indian weaver have, ‚û°Ô∏è The current interest in handmader and sustainable products there is renewed hope for weavers. ‚û°Ô∏è Today several Indian fashion designers and international fashion houses are showing interest in Indian handicrafts and handloom practices. ‚û°Ô∏è Most important point us the advent of e- commerce, weavers have easy access to whole new market, information and connectivity. ‚û°Ô∏è Indian Handloom products are a living testimony of exemplary artisanship, showcasing culture and civilization of India. As a rich in culture and heritage, we have a good opportunity, but not every country have this. Examples , Pashmina (Kashmir), Phulkari (Punjab),Chikankari (Uttar Pradesh), Muga silk(Assam), Ikkat(Telangana), Kancheepuram Saree (Tamilnadu), Mysore silk(Karnataka), Paithani (Maharashtra), Bandhani (Gujrat) etc. Some Indian brands in international market like, Fabindia, Biba, Mufti, Raymond etc. But most of the Indian celebrity buy from foreign fashion brand like Gucci,Zara, Parada etc. If these Indian celebrity use our Indian Handloom products, then this is a huge promotion in Global Market. And we should thnik about this. Indian Handloom sectors plays an important role in our economy, providing employment next to agriculture. But also handloom products have its own identity of different state or region. #linkdin #Indianhandloom #ghostwriting\n\nDo you want an art piece on your desk with a tradition of 4,000 years? Dhokra Shilpkala is an ancient craft that originates from the tribal communities of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Odisha. üìñA common belief is that the word \"Dhokra\" is derived from the Dhokra Damar tribes. They‚Äôve been known to be the traditional metal-smiths of Central India. ‚öíÔ∏èMaking a Dhokra piece involves an intricate process of metal casting, using the lost-wax technique. Artisans make patterns and designs in beeswax and then encase them in the clay mold. They melt away the wax. What‚Äôs left is a mold in which molten metal is poured. This results in beautiful artifacts. From figurines to functional items, various artifacts can be made using this technique. üé≠This ancient technique is not just about art; it's about preserving a cultural legacy. It's about celebrating our heritage and ensuring that these beautiful traditions continue to thrive in the modern world. üßëüíºLooking for a meaningful art piece to look at between work breaks?

It is here that Toda embroidery emerged as a distinct cultural practice. ü™° This beautiful embroidery work on shawls worn by both genders is called ‚Äòputhkuli‚Äô. The red-and-black embroidery work is executed on a white fabric base depicting a variety of motifs inspired from their former pastoral lifestyle and the surrounding environment. The puthkulis are still worn by the Todas on important rites of passage, festivals or community events, and are highly valued. Nowadays most Toda families, being landowners, have taken to agriculture and maintain large plantations growing a variety of different crops. Due to being financially well-off, few Todas are motivated to take up embroidery work as a full-time business. Initiatives have been made by NGOs to ‚Äòtrain‚Äô and ‚Äòhelp‚Äô the Todas in commercialising their craft‚Äîthe women are introduced to new designs, and embroidery work is done on a new range of products which has no relevance to Toda culture. Cooperative societies are set up which attempt to mass produce the embroidery work to cater to the tourism market. The Todas feel that new motifs taught by NGOs are not authentic and that the copying of their motifs has resulted in a loss of exclusivity of their craft. To protect their intellectual property, the embroidery work was listed as a geographically tagged product and is protected under the Geographical Indications of Goods Act (GI Act) 1999 of the Government of India.
