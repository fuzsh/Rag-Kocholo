My grandfather Chanan Singh Ahluwalia was part of Indian Army. My great grandfather Khajan Singh Ahluwalia had served British Army during 30’s. I feel that serving for nation as army men is in our blood!”\n\nRaman’s story is quite inspirational for all the young international students who come to Australia to pursue their dreams.\n\nHe is a turban wearing Sikh who came to Australia on a student visa and have done study course in hospitality management.\n\n“My first few years in Australia was a great struggle! I remember the tough days when I had small scale jobs as a cook, a security supervisor and even I drove taxi and buses for few years” said Raman.\n\nTalking about his passion for Army, he mentioned, “I am trying to follow footprints of my ancestors and try to do something for my country and community.”\n\nWhile talking about his appearance and religious beliefs, he said, “the diversity is one of the key strengths of the Australian Army and I am proud to be part of it.”\n\n“With dignity, my appearance as a “Sikh” also reminds me of the extra responsibilities that come my way. I am here to follow the footsteps of great Sikh soldiers who fought for noble causes with bravery and honesty.”\n\n“I want to serve my country, and at the same time I have a deep down desire to remain true to my faith. In this regard, I am very thankful to Australian Army who helped me join forces with my full on appearance, with beard and turban!”\n\n“I am immensely proud of my Army uniform as it gives me a sense of belonging – my uniform and my badge name as ‘Singh’ gives me an immense pleasure that I can’t describe.”\n\nRaman also told SBS Punjabi why it is particularly important for Sikhs to serve in the military or police service.\n\n“Sikhism has a long history of saint-soldier tradition. I was greatly influenced by my granddad who used to teach me that we can’t have peace without justice. Moreover, I feel our religious and cultural values are directly in line with military values.”\n\n“Serving the nation and to have a sense of belonging when there are so many issues of ‘mistaken identity’ is quite crucial for me at a personal level. I always wished to be a front runner with my service, commitment and dignity.”\n\n“My move to join Australian Army has earned me a lot of respect in friends, family and local community. And I will try to hold the flag high” said Raman in a telephonic conversation with SBS Radio’s Punjabi program.\n\nBorn and raised in Mukatsar Sahib, Punjab, Raman always had a passion for Army.\n\n“My ancestors were proud army servicemen.

Sporting a message saying, ‘DC has the nation’s highest rate of food insecurity among children. Twenty five percent of our veterans experience food insecurity. Our Mission: Combat Hunger. Serve Humanity’, the truck plies on the road distributing free hot meals to the needy.\n\nSpeaking to The Indian Express over the phone, Sonny Kakar, 46, the man behind the idea says, “It was originally the wish of my 74-year old father Devinder Kakar to do something for the homeless. We left India years ago. I was just five when my family shifted to US from Delhi. Sikhism teaches us to not let anyone sleep hungry and serve langar. My ancestors were from Rawalpindi (now in Pakistan). My father was the happiest man on the earth the day we inaugurated this truck and he saw poor having a hearty meal.”\n\nWorking with a cyber security firm in US, Kakar explains the concept saying, “Initially, we have spent $75,000 (Rs 50.35 lakh approx) on this truck. It has an in-built kitchen and a window from where meals are served. We are serving 250 meals a day on an average currently. The plan is to increase it to 50,000 a day. Also, we are targeting 20 such trucks in US by 2020 to combat hunger. Apart from the homeless, truck is also plying in areas comprising deprived senior citizens, orphans and ex-servicemen.”\n\nKakar also acknowledges the help that has poured in from local Sikh community in the US. “My friends – Gurpal Bhullar, Anu Kaur, Rubin Paul Singh – have helped me at every step in starting this free-meal service,” he said.\n\nSpeaking about the menu it offers, Kakar said that the truck though serves pure vegetarian meal but its not Indian. “Since people we are serving are mostly American, we have to go by their taste. Italian pasta and Mexican tortillas are served generally. On several occasions, we also serve cookies, ice creams while cheese, eggs and potatoes are served for breakfast. On the occasion of Baisakhi, we dished out cheese quesadilla; chips, salsa and guacamole; mandarin, ice cream and red sauce pasta,” said Carol Barbosa Jeliazkov, a Brazilian, working with group.\n\nSource- Indianexpress.com\n\nAn orange and navy blue truck seen plying on the streets of Washington DC in US these days has emerged as a source of hope for the homeless and the poor.\n\nStarted by a Sikh, the truck, which famously goes by the name ‘Seva Truck’, takes its inspiration from the popular ‘langar’ (community kitchens).

While the 17% may not seem like a huge disparity, reducing that would create the world of difference.\n\nThe Sikhs have over 150 years of history in America, yet they are never featured in entertainment business, commercial advertising, or in today’s fashion. However, what they do receive is constant scrutiny for their turbans from people who automatically assume their article of faith as a symbol of terror—which is sheer ignorance.\n\nOne such brand that is blurring the lines of ethnicity and religion in their models is Eidos Napoli. It is an Italian luxury brand which focuses on making classy yet comfortable clothing for men and just that. One of their models for New York Fashion Week was Sahaj Anand—a proud American Sikh who will start Emory University this fall. Sahaj told me, “Most people who asked me to model [previously] wanted me to remove my turban and show my hair.” When asked how his experience was different this time, he stated that it was great since Eidos Napoli “wanted [him] to keep [his] articles of faith intact.” Not only did this make him feel comfortable, but it proved to him that he did not have to compromise his beliefs to follow his dreams.\n\nIf an Italian brand can do this, why can’t more American brands?\n\nSource- www.theodysseyonline.com\n\nOver 80 percent of models that were hired for New York’s Fashion Week were white, whereas they make up 63 percent of the American population.

Satguru Sri Guru Amar Das Ji Maharaj, being very pleased, one day said to them, ‘You have obtained full knowledge of my religion, and you may now return to your own country to preach there the true Name and lead souls to salvation.’\n\nThey represented, ‘O true king, our beloved Guru Ji, the inhabitants of our country are followers of Jogis who split their ears. The Jogis deceive them by incanta­tions and spells, and consequently the people know nothing of devotion, the Guru’s hymns, or divine knowledge. They worship cemeteries and cremation grounds, are averse from true religion, and none but the true Guru himself can save them.\n\nSatguru Sri Guru Amar Das Ji Maharaj replied,’ Go utter Waheguru, teach every one you meet the virtues of the True name, and put people on the Guru’s way.’\n\nPhiria and Katara again repre­sented: ‘Such is the power of the Jogis, that simple men like us may not withstand them. Without the special power of the Guru how can the True name be proclaimed among such persons?’\n\nSatguru Sri Guru Amar Das Ji Maharaj replied, ‘The Creator will be with you ; your word-shall penetrate their hearts; and their impious efforts shall not prevail against you. From the sleep of ignorance men shall awake to divine knowledge Grant them the gift of the Name, cause them to utter Waheguru and walk in the path shown by the Guru.’\n\nHaving received these commands and their beloved Guru Ji’s blessing, and meditated on the Immortal Being in their hearts, Phiria and Katara returned to their own country. On arriving there they proceeded to a Jogis’ monastery. The Jogis, on seeing their face; beaming with the light shed on them by Satguru Sri Guru Amar Das Ji Maharaj, fled like deer on seeing a tiger.\n\nPhiria and Katara then converted the monastery into a temple. People assembled in crowds, and asked where these very mighty men had come, who had dared violate the sanc­tuary of Gorakhnath, and before whom the priests of the Jogis had fled. A crowd of people came to create a disturbance, but, on hearing Phiria and Katara sing the Guru’s hymns, their hard hearts so melted that they sought the Sikhs’ protection, and with all due ceremonies embraced the Sikh religion, and began to worship the one immortal Akal Purakh.
