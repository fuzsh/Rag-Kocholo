        "text": "Global Sikh Council leader Dr Kanwaljit Kaur from London visited Pakistan last month as part of a delegation for the first International Sikh Convention in Lahore. She availed the opportunity to meet the ETPB Board that manages Sikh shrines with PSGPC, to apprise them of Sikh concerns regarding the preservation of Sikh heritage in Pakistan.\n\nLADY SINGH KANWALJIT KAUR and the Heritage Committee Incharge of the Global Sikh Council -Yashpal Singh met the officials of the Evacuee Trust Property Board officials Muhammad Tariq and Imran Khan and discussed ways and mechanisms for preservation of our heritage for future generations. The ETPB Board, also known as the Aukaf Board along with the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee manages various Gurdwaras and historical sites of the Sikhs in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\nThe GSC delegation sought the support of the ETPB officials in taking personal interest to resolve the land dispute of Gurdwara Biba Sahib in Peshawar, as some unscrupulous elements have claimed ownership of the Gurdwara land and the Sikhs of Peshawar are keen that their rightful due is given to them. Kanwaljit Kaur told the officials that “an early resolution of the situation there will ensure more cordiality between the two communities, which have been strained for some time.”\n\nGSC Heritage Committee in-charge Yashpal Singh requested the Aukaf Board, to share information with the Global Sikh Council and other Diaspora bodies regarding the opening, renovation and maintenance of Gurdwaras and Sikh institutions in Pakistan in order that such information is widely circulated and misinformation is curtailed.\n\nSpeaking to the World Sikh News, Kanwaljit Kaur said, “The Global Sikh Council has been made an advisory member of the ETPB Board. We have offered support from the GSC to the ETPB Board and hope to work closely with them in the future.”"
