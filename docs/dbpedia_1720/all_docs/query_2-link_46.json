        "text": "Abstract\n\nPakistan has a diverse variety of monumental buildings which includes mosques, tombs, shrines and Gurdwaras. Every year, thousands of Sikh pilgrims are attracted to their Gudrwaras to satisfy their religion which is located mostly in southern Punjab, Pakistan. These monumental Gurduwars reflect the Sikh culture and heritage in terms of religious tourist margins. These historical assets have firm potential that could serve for tourism development, conservation and preservation of these and thus moving toward sustainable solutions. The objective of this research is to analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of Sikh religious tourism in Pakistan. The research methodology adopted for this research was qualitative and data was collected through formal interviews of officials of the Evaccu Trust Property Board (ETPB), Government of Pakistan. The results showed that Southern Punjab, Pakistan has a strong potential for religious tourism and if promoted can help in the socio-economic development of a country.\n\nKey Words\n\nReligious Tourism, Gurdwaras,Â Â Darbar Sahib, Punja Sahib, Rorri Sahib, Janam Asthan\n\nIntroduction\n\nReligious tourism is actually visiting attractions in a city of religious importance. It is a particular form of activity that is completely and strongly motivated by religion. (2022).Â It can be defined as an activity specifically oriented towards a religious culture with the help of a definite eco-cultural environment and activities such as worship, research and visits carried out by religious followers and tourists. Religious tourism has undergone continuous development and expansion in the modern tourism industry. About 40 per cent of the world's tourism revenue is generated from religious tourism, and Pakistan has just begun to develop this market with enormous potential. Religious tourism is an important reason of income source and means of\n\nemployment in the country.\n\nPakistan is a country endowed with many tourist attractions, especially religious ones. (Alaverdov & Bari, 2022) It houses several cultural heritage sites associated with Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism. The major holiest sites of Sikhism are located in the Southern Punjab of Pakistan and are considered the most important sites to be visited by Sikh pilgrims. These cities of Pakistan host religious centres not only have a cultural landscape but also promotes industrial and trade activities in the form of marketing and local business. (Kalim, Majeed Khan & Syed, 2022).Â Millions of touristsâ visit these religious sites from Pakistan and abroad. Â The Sikh community is attracted yearly to perform their religious obligations worldwide. Among many other sacred sites of Sikhism, the Gurdwaras of Nankana Sahib, Narowal and Hasanabdal are a great fascination for Sikhs. (\"Religion: why faith is becoming more and more popular\", 2022). The international visitor visiting Pakistan are then attracted to the natural splendour of Northern areas and other holiest places of diverse religions like Sufis Shrines and other historical sites.Â\n\nPakistan has a significant potential for religious tourism with a number of historic sites. But, due to a lack of policy framework, their perspective is not yet fully realized. The objective of this research is to analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of religious tourism in Pakistan and suggest more standards in the development of this sector so as to make a significant contribution to the tourism market.\n\nResearch Methodology\n\nThe research has been carried out through a set of descriptive approaches to explore the importance of Sikh Gurduwaras in Pakistan. The literature review was carried out through reconnaissance surveys, interviews of concerned officials and analysis of journal articles. The research also analyses the statistical data of visitors attracted to these holy setups indicating their tourist potential. The SWOT analysis was done to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of Sikh religious tourism in Pakistan.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nReligious tourism is important as it is done to\n\nfulfil religious compulsions and commitments. The general essence of religious tourism denotes travelling with the prime motive of undergoing religious deeds. Religion and tourism are interlinked with each other as both have similar effects on the specific area like, the products they bring such as traditions, culture, art and architecture. (Singh, 2019)\n\nReligious tourism can be depicted initially in Islam, Christianity and Jews as their pioneer form of tourism were in the form of visiting pilgrimages visiting such as Mecca and Jerusalem respectively. They have always been one of the leading factors to set an example for others to travel. In history, religious tourism was in the form of spreading the word of religion to different parts of the world and for this purpose, people travelled far across. This resulted in spreading knowledge areas as well as economic growth.\n\nPakistan has renowned religious tourism sites of Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Buddhism. Among these, the major holiest sites of Sikhism lie in the Southern Punjab area of the country. People of the Sikh community visit these cities to satisfy their religious commitments. About four hundred and eighty inbound locations have been identified by Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC), specifically encompassing the religious tourism potential of Pakistan, where one hundred and six are of historical significance, one hundred and twenty religions, and twenty-six religions and history. (BeBe Sumra & Alam, 2022) (Table1).\n\nConclusions\n\nPakistan has diverse sets of religious tourism assets in the form of prominent Sikh heritage and religious sites. The only point is to understand their importance at the community and government level to the extent that they should be uplifted to enhance their inbuilt tourism potential. Every year, the Sikh pilgrimages visiting Pakistan to perform their required religious obligations are facilitated with the best possible amenities at the local level. The SWOT analysis shows that Pakistan has a huge potential for religious tourism with a number of Sikh Gurdwaras sites located in Southern, Punjab, Pakistan. But, their perspective is not yet fully understood due to planning gaps and policy frameworks. To advance tourism, wide extending mindfulness campaign at the national level is required. Promotion of tourism industry by public awareness campaign and provision of five-star hotel accommodation required within the cities of important Gurdwaras accommodating the social, religious and dietary needs of guests. The mandatorily required facilities for the pilgrims such as hotels should be constructed within close proximity of the major Gurdwaras. Other than that the market areas in close proximity to the Gurdwaras should be promoted to benefit the local economy. Initially, the Pakistani policymakers should work out the possibility of arranging joint approach planning by the Sikh community and the Pakistani concerned authorities. A secure and relaxing environment should be provided for Sikh travellers, breaking the fear and political pressures between Pakistan and India. The cultural essence of the area is to be heightened and promoted. Thus both the conservation of built and unbuilt heritage is required to be restored and preserved. Conservation of historic towns of religious importance should be done at appropriate times and conditions rather than destroying and waiting for the monument to vanish from the scene."
