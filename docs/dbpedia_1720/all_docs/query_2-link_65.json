Biba\".\n\nDrive 70 km north of Bathinda and you have Sukhwinder Singh \"Danny\" as the Congress candidate from Faridkot.\n\nReach Ludhiana, the industrial hub of Punjab, and Congress (AICC) spokesman Manish Tiwari - a.k.a. Nitu to family - will be trying hard to queer the Akali pitch.\n\nEnter Anandpur Sahib, the town where the Khalsa was born, and Congress' Ravneet Singh \"Bittu\" will tell you how Maharaja Sahib (as Amarinder is known) and Rahul have been benevolent by backing his candidature from this holy city. The 25-year-old Bittu, incidentally, is the grandson of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh.\n\nAmong sitting Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) in Punjab, there is a Lov Kumar \"Goldy\" (Garhshankar), \"Kaka\" Randeep Singh (Nabha) and Harminder Singh \"Jassi\" (Bathinda). Another legislator, Sukhpal Singh (Ferozepur) is better known to people as \"Nannu\".\n\nA former Akali MLA, Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon of Faridkot is \"Kiki\" to his friends from Chandigarh. Punjab’s transport minister is known as \"Master\" Mohan Lal, since he was a teacher earlier.\n\nWhat’s in a nickname?\n\nPlenty, if you ask a Punjab politician.\n\nMarch 28, 2009"
