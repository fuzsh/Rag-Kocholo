        "text": "PESHAWAR: Indian-origin British historian and author Bobby Singh Bansal, who is considered as an authority on Sikh heritage in Pakistan, has claimed that 90 per cent of the Sikh heritage sites are located in the country, mostly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, as he underlined their potential to promote religious tourism.\n\nSpeaking at a guest talk titled 'From Kartarpur to Khyber Pass' at the Victoria Memorial Hall of Peshawar Museum on Friday, the UK-born historian took the audience to an interesting journey through a historic landscape dotted with Sikh era monuments, forts, battlefields, shrines, tombs, gurdwaras and havelies.\n\nThe KP province, which has the maximum number of such sites, has the potential to attract the Sikh community from across the globe.\n\nThe 'Jamrud Fort' in Khyber district is a \"goldmine\" for attracting Sikh tourists because of the tomb of Nalwa there, he said.\n\n\"He is one of the most revered personalities among the Sikhs and people from the community would want to visit his tomb.\n\nThe love and association for Hari Singh Nalwa by Sikh community could be gauged from the fact that my own car number plate carry his name,\" Bansal said.\n\nIf Pakistan allows Sikh diaspora to visit the cremation site and tomb of Nalwa, the community members from across the globe will rush to the site, he said.\n\n\"These places should be on Sikh tourist map of KP. This topic is of particular interest to the Sikh diaspora from around the world who would like to travel to KP and be part of organised tours to be able to view this shared heritage,\" he said at the lecture organised by the KP Directorate of Archeology.\n\nBansal, who is also the director of the Sikh Heritage Foundation UK, narrated his experiences of visiting the KP province since the1980s and the subsequent research, which led him to visit and document all the Sikh monuments in KP from 2007 to 2019.\n\nBansal is the man behind Maharaja Ranjit Singh's life-size statue that was unveiled at the Mai Jindan Haveli in the Lahore Fort on the occasion of 180th death anniversary of the legendary Sikh ruler in June."
