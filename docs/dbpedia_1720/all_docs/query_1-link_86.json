        "text": "According to \"Tababat-a- Nasheeri\", in 799 Hizri, Khokharwa Rajputs embraced Hinduism and under the command of Raja Anand Pal fought against Mahmud Ghazni with 3000 army men. They supported Malik Khusro of Jammu against Mahmud Ghazni. They started spreading towards Kabul, Kandhar and Macedonia. According to History of India by Baldev Raj, in 1215 Khokhars were harassing Altamash. In 1226 Altamash defeated Rajputs. When in 1227 Changez Khan dominated Jallaudin from Ghazni, he moved towards Lahore and met with resistance from khokhars but they could not succeed. According to book \"Punjab Castes\"- Budan pal and Veer Narain got killed during the take over of Rajputs from Punjab and Gwalior. During the period of 1240 to 1250 Khokhars kept on challenging Mugals and kept their presence felt. According to Taribh-a-Mubarikshahi Shekhar Khokhar occupied Lahore in 1394. Mugal king Himann sent Sikander Shah to defeat Khokhars. When Tuman left Hindustan the killed Shekhar Khokhars . Muslim invaders started forcing them towards Jammu and finally they started at Bharatpur in Rajasthan where they founded the state of Bhartgarh. Raja Budan Pal had to marry a woman from other caste as advocated by the wise men of that time to fulfill his desire to get a heir. So he married Chander Kanta, daughter of Bansidhar, a carpenter. Boy named Punpal took birth. In this way family tree kept on descending. Raja Sultan along with his son Sada and Grandson Sidhu settled at Tuklani, they all were followers of Sakhi-Server, a Muslim pir whose dera is there in Afghanistan.. There has been five Bhai families upon whom title of Bhai has been conferred. These are Bhai Bhagtu family , Bhai Behlo family. Pandit Bhai Ganga Ram family, Bhai Daroli family and Bhai Roop Chand family. When Raja Sada's son Sidhu married Bibi Surti of Vada Ghar near Daroli, on the day of marriage 16th Jyeth 1670 she had a chance to meet Guru Hargobind ji, as her father Bhai Aqal was a disciple of Guru Ramdas ji and Arjan Dev ji. She begged for sikhi for her husband who was along with his family worshiper of Sakhi-Server. Guru Hargobind ji blessed her and professed that a boy would take birth, who will be honored by all. A very beautiful boy was born on 3- Baisakh and the 6th guru himself named him \"Roop chand' . Father Sidhu and son Roop Chand were superintending the harvesting of the crop .It was a very hot day .They had a goat skin water container hung from a branch in the shade of the nearby tree. The water was exceptionally cool and sweet. Both moved with devotion, dedicated the water as offering to the Guru and refrained from drinking it. The heat grew more intense and their thirst more aggravated, till they almost swooned by exhaustion. But neither father nor son would touch any drop of the water. On the other hand Guru Hargobindji by his omniscience was aware of the distress which both were suffering on account of the deep devotion to him . Guru ji travelled 32 miles on horse back despite the heat of the day and reached both of them and drank their water to his fill according to their wish - sharing it with his devoted disciples.\n\nIn token of his appreciation of their love and devotion to Him , Guruji gave them his robe, sword and horse .To this day there stands on the spot the JAND tree to commemorate this historic event. With deep reverence, Sidhu and Roop Chand placed the sword and robe on their heads and led the horse to their home by a rope, for they considered these presents too sacred for their personal use. Observing this, the Guru was greatly touched by their devotion and respect for him. He blessed them with a remark that their word would be more potent than sword and that they need not use the weapon but should keep it in trust for the Guru's descendants to claim. He also remarked that Sikhs will follow their example and keep a miniature sword on their heads; since then, the present custom of keeping a small Kirpan in the Sikh's hairs. Guru laid the foundation of Village Bhai Roopa on the 16th Baisakh,1687 Bikra mi (1630 A.D.) naming it after Bhai Roop Chand. In august 1631 Guru Hargobind Sahib ji , with 3000 warriors again visited Bhai Roopa and stayed there for three months. The Guru in recognition of devotion , honoured Roop Chand with The title of \"Bhai\" (own brother) and put him in charge of the spiritual welfare of the new region of Malwa and the country south of Sutlej. With his own hands Guru Ji made Bhai Roop Chand the MASAND of the area and put on his forehead the TILAK, (saffron mark of leadership) and gave a KARCHHA, a long spoon , asking him to run LANGAR to feed the poor and the needy. This KARCHHA is a symbol of veneration for the family. The Guru also remarked that even fresh cut wood would burn like dry wood in the Langar fire. This can be seen even now at Dyalpura Bhai village at any time. In Feb. 1644 Guru Hargobind Sahib ji died and Bhai Roop Chand Ji participated in all the ceremonies which were held at Kiratpur sahib..After that in 1652 Guru Har-Rai ji stayed with his uncle Sai Dass at Daroli then proceeded towards Bhai Roopa village. Kala Sidhu was a devout pupil of Bhai Roop Chand. He along with his nephews Phool and Sandli pleaded for food from the Guru. Due to mediation of Bhai Roop Chandji Guruji professed that their (Phool & Sandli) horses will drink water between Jamuna and Satluj and true to the Guru's word, the Phoolkian family came in to being which later sprang up as the princely states of Patiala, Nabha, Jind etc. During the times of the9th Guru Teg Bahadur ji, in Feb 1665, Bhai Roop Chand ji and his two sons Dharam Chand and Param chand were mostly in His company. Bhai Roop Chandji remained in service of Mata Gujri ji at Patna and both sons went to Assam along with Guruji. Dharam chand ji was instrumental in diffusing enmity amongst the Assam Rajas. Guru Teg Bahadur ji called Sahibzada (Guru Gobind Rai) along with his family members who came from Patna, Kashi, Audia, Hardwar, Ambala, Lakhnor etc.and Bhai Roopa family, Bhai Behlo, Daroli families on knowing this also came to meet Guruji. Though Guru Gobind Singh ji was of very tender age, he was married to Bibi Jeeto ji at Guru ka Lahore. Guru Teg Bahadurji decided that Bhai Roop Chand will perform the marriage ceremony. So this legendary service was showered upon Bhai Sahib and He performed the marriage ceremony. After martyrdom of sahibzadas at Sirhind Guruji came to Malwa at village Deena and stayed in Desoo carpenter's house. Here Bhai Roop Chand's sons brought the attire and the arms which the6th Guru had presented to them and had promised to take them back in his10th term.10th Master Guru Gobind Singh, on seeing those things became very happy and further presented them with his personal kirpan (Gatra Kirpan). Guruji said that as long as they honoured these things their power will remain intact. Here elder two sons Dharam Chand and Param Chand along with other family members were offered to the Guru. They served Guru Gobind Singh ji till end up to Nanded. Even Param Singh died in Nanded. The whole family got baptized at Damdama sahib from Guru Gobind Singh ji\n\nGuru Gobind Singh ji explained the meaning of Guru Granth Sahib to 48 of his close (HAZURI) disciples. Above two along with Bhai Binod, Baba Deep Singh ji, Bhai Dan Singh, Bhai Hardas Singh (grand father of Jassa Singh Ramgarhia), Bhai Mani Singh, Bhai Kehar Singh etc. listened to Guruji at Talwandi Sabo.\n\nOne time Guru Gobind Singh ji tested Bhai Dharam Singh ji and Bhai Param Singh ji.Guru Ji sent them back saying that their services has been acknowledged .Bhai Roop Singh got enraged on seeing them back and scolded them for leaving the Guru alone. He ordered both of them to go back to Guruji and if Guru Ji was satisfied with them then they had to bring His signed letter. Both complying the order of their father reached Nanded (A.P.) again and met Guruji . Guru Ji felt happy over the devotion of Bhai Roop Singh and his sons and gave them His personal Pothi with signature on that plus one handkerchief, small knife and showered His divine blessings on them. Darshan of these articles can be observed on Sangrand of every month at village Bagrian near Nabha. Bhai Jhujhar Singh is the scion of the family. Great Guru Gobind Singh Ji went to Nanded where Baba Banda Bahadur came into the Guru's fold. He was sent to Punjab to teach lesson to the tyrants. Banda wrote letters to various Sikh sardars to send troops to join him. A similar letter was sent to Bhai Roopa's family and in response to that Bhai Dharam Singh ji and Bhai Karam Singh joined Banda Bahadur and took part in the battle against Sirhind. Bhai Dharm Singh ji was commander of the Malwa army. Fateh Singh of Bathinda and Dan Singh Brar also fought along with them. By this time LANGAR SEWA had spread to many villages apart from Bhai Roopa village. Bhai Roop Singh sahib had seven sons Bhai Dharm Singh ji, Bhai Param Singh ji, Bhai Karam Singh ji, Bhai Mahanand, Bhai Sadanand, Bhai Surtia and Bhai Sukhia ji., out of whom he ordered Bhai Dharm Singh ji to populate a new village which he found and called it Dialpura then village Bagrian was populated near Nabha. Bhai Param Singh's and Surtia's descendents live in Bhai Roopa village. Mahanand's descendents live in Kotha guru, Rawalheri and Lakhnor villages. Bhai Sukhia's descendents live in Samadh Bhai village where Bhai Roop singh ji was cremated. Bhai Karam Singh ji's family lives in Syriawala, Thathi, Kalyan and Tolawala. Baba Guddar Singh ji grandson of Bhai Dharm Singh ji and Nawab Kapoor Singh baptized Baba Ala Singh (Founder of Patiala state).Gajpat Rai (Nana of Maharaja Ranjit Singh) was devout pupil of Baba ji. He made one fort for Babaji at Dialpura Bhai village. He got a son by blessing of Babaji. Mai Rajji prayed that even if they should be deprived of their own share of children the Raja must be blessed with an off-spring. And the prayer was answered. \"His Holiness\" Bhai Sahib Bhai Arjan Singh Ji was an exemplary Sikh. He baptised 500 persons (a big number at that times) in a single day, a sort of record at that time. Bhai Ardaman Singh ji (above) served as an ardent descendent of Bhai Roop Singh ji and presently Bhai Sahib Bhai Ashok Singh ji a very visionary and learned personality who is respected by all. Bhai Hardayal Singh Ji was a learned personality who is aslo respected by all. Bhai sahib Bhai Jujjahar Singh ji is scion of the family, his now the current Bhai Sahib of bagrian and serving panth from Bagrian. Bhai Gurchet Singh ji possesses very rare and valuable relics (read 6th june AJIT paper) belongings to various gurus and serving at Bhai Roopa village. Bhai Jiwanjot Singh ji descendant of Bhai Karam singh is looking after LANGAR at Siryawala .The Bhai Roopa family possesses a bundle of HUKAMNAMAS, Royal warrants from Gurus in which, besides asking for men, money and war materials, the Guru acknowledged Bhai Roopa's family as his own family. The family also possesses a chariot, RABAB and KHADAWAN (wooden shoe) of Guru Arjan Devji, One KHADAWAN of Mata Gangaji, some paintings of Guru Sahib's times including one of Guru Gobind Singhji's childhood. One hand written Guru Granth Sahib ji, One Karchha, Qatar, many hand written Pothies, Cot which was used to bestow 'BHAI TITLE' , Original top cloth of RATH (chariot). One personal Pothi signed by Guru Gobind Singh Ji, GATRE WALI KIRPAN, RUMAL (handkerchief), LOH (Round Steel plate to cook roti) ,one GARWA,one seat of Camel, one Gager, Parat(to knead flour), one old chowki And LOH at Syriawala.\n\nThe story of the CHARIOT (rath) is as follows:- Khuda Bakhsh, a Kashmiri carpenter, prayed for a son and promised one chariot to be offered to the 4th guru sahib. His wish was granted and he worked extensively for a long time and made one and offered it to Guru Ramdas ji at Amritsar. Then Guru Arjan dev ji took possession of it and on the same Rath Mata Gangaji went to Baba BUDDA ji for blessing of a son. The same rath was used by Guru Hargobind sahib ji and then by Guru HarRai Sahib.When Ram Rai son of Guru Har Rai ji was sent by the 7th guru to clarify the meaning of Sloka \"Miti musalman ki pede pai ghumiar\" to the then Mogul emperor Aurangjeb then Ram Rai himself changed the text to \"Miti beiman ke pede pai ghumiar\". On this he was debarred from guruship. He settled at Dehradun where he was given land by the emperor. He had this chariot on which he used to travel to Delhi etc. According to legend Ram Rai used to fly this chariot as he had supernatural powers. So chariot became famous as the \"flying chariot\". On request from Mata Punjab Kaur wife of Ram Rai ji, this was brought by Bhai Gian Singh from Dehradun for safe keeping. Darshan of this chariot can be done at Village Bhai Roopa on any day. In total 101 articles given to various members of the family on different occasions are in possession with various members of the family.\n\nHouse of Bagrian\n\nThe house of Bagrian is situated on Malerkotla Nabha Road in Malerkotla District. The Bhai Sahibs of Bagrian had originally descended from the branch of Khokharwa Rajputs of Marwar, in Rajashthan. Of Bhai Roop Chand Ji's sons Bhai Dharam Singh was succeeded. House of Bagrian are the descendants of Bhai Dharam Singh Ji. As ordained by his father Bhai Roop Chand Ji, Bhai Dharam Singh leave all the property to his brothers and bring only the gifts and relics of tenth guru Gobind Singh ji with him, where he was living. Bhai Dharam Singh was died in 1717 AD and he was succeeded by his son Bhai Dayal Singh. Bhai Dayal Singh took the relics and gifts of Guru's, which was bestowed to Bhai Roop Chand and Bhai Dharam Singh and set up a new village Dilyalpura Bhai Ka. Here at Diyalpua Bhai Dayal Singh establish a new Langar like at Bhai Rupa Village. At that time two houses of Malwa were famous among the others, One was Ale Ka the house of Maharaja Ala Singh and One was Diyale Ka the house of Bhai Dayal Singh. Of Bhai Dayal Singh Ji sons Bhai Guddar Singh was succeeded the estate. Bhai Guddar Singh ji was particularly known for his god-fearing apirit and philanthropism. He travelled to far off places, to preach the gospel of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. It is related of Gajpat Singh, first Raja of Jind, that, having no children, he came to confide his troubles to his friend, Guddar Singh. After thinking it over, the Bhai pronounced in the matter as follows: This is indeed a misfortune; for you of all men should have offspring. In my fate it is written that I shall have children, as it is in yours that you shall have none ; but I will gladly transfer to you this portion of my good fortune if my wife will give consent.” His wife, the good Mai Raji, willingly agreed, whereupon Godar Singh performed certain rites over the Raja, who returned home with the Bhai’s” luck ”, and due time became the father of several sons and daughters. One of the latter, Raj Kaur, was eventually the wife of the celebrated Sardar Mahan Singh Sukarchakia and the mother of the still more celebrated Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Later on, in 1754, it fell to Godar Singh’s lot to have to entertain -Adina Beg and Sadik Beg, Governors of the Delhi Emperor, and so well pleased were they with the hospitality that they procured for him the jagir rights of the Bagarian village in which Bhai Arjan Singh now lives. He soon after founded the villages of Diwala and Kalahar in Ludhiana, Ghingrali and Vahra in Faridkot, and Vandran and Talwandi in Ferozepore. In 1763 his old friend. Raja Gajpat Singh of Jind, presented him with six villages in the Karal and Panipat districts, which he had just overrun; but he had to surrender them again shortly after, as the Raja was rapidly beaten back -within the proper limits of his State. However, in those days land had not the value it now has, and to receive a present of a deserted village, with all the conditions attached of revenue payments, was often regarded by the donor more as a misfortune than a blessing. The next member of the family to acquire property was Bhai Mohar Singh, who early in the last century was given two villages by the Jind Raja, one by Sardar Hari Singh Khana, and one by the Sardar of Ladwa. In 1807 Maharaja Ranjit Singh honored him with a visit at Bagarian on the occasion of his second invasion of the Cis-Sutlej districts. Mohar Singh acted up to the family reputation for hospitality, and received the villages of Sadhowala and Sujana in jagir from the Sikh Chief as a grant-in-aid towards the expenses of the langar. The Maharaja also presented him with five hundred maunds of salt, promising that this article should be in future supplied to the kitchen, without charge, from the stores of the royal palace. Raja Fateh Singh Ahluwalia, of Kapruthala, who was with Ranjit Singh on this expedition, also presented Mohar Singh with a village named Gangrali. Mohar Singh died in 1820, leaving the property to his nephew, Bahadur Singh, a minor, whom he adopted. The family affairs were, looked after by his widow, Mai Gauhran, who was fortunately a clever woman; for the growing power of the Bhais had begun to excite the envy of Raja Karam Singh of Patiala, who by way of exercising authority as suzerain, established a Tahsil and a Thana at Bagarian. For this unjustifiable trespass he was at once reported by the widow to Captain Murray, Political Agent, who requested the Raja to withdraw his posts. This order was duly complied with, but Karam Singh sat uneasy under, the rebuke, and soon after he found means of setting Bahadur Singh against Mai Gauhran, from whom he demanded the surrender of his patrimony. But the widow appealed, again successfully, to Captain Murry, and she was allowed to hold the estates in life-tenure, it being considered certain that Bahadur Singh, if his own master, would fall an easy prey to his Patiala neighbor’s. When, however, Mai Gauhran died in 1838 and the property was taken over by Bahadur Singh, it was found he was perfectly able to look after his own interests, as he fully proved in more than one victorious tussle with Maharaja Karam Singh. On one occasion, in 1840, under cover of active loyalty towards the British Government, the Maharaja sent one of his colonels, Mansa Singh, to seize all the camels he could find in Bagarian for use in connection with the Afghan campaign. The Colonel had not driven the camels very far before he was overtaken by Bahadur Singh, captured and led back in triumph to Bagarian. Karam Singh, enraged at this act of insolent insubordination on the part of one whom he desired to treat as a vassal, sent a portion of his troops, including a solitary gun, to effect the Colonel’s release, and level the Bagarian village with, the ground. But the ever-watchful chiefs of Jind and Nabha and MalerKotla, who had no desire to see Patiala grow larger on a frivolous pretext, sent armies of observation” to that neighborhood, and Karam Singh withdrew his forces, re non effecta, Bahadur Singh had next to assert himself against the Baja of Faridkot, who, in 1840, seized the village of Talwandi, founded by Bhai Godar Singh, holding it with his horsemen, and building a mud wall around so as to convert it into a fort. But this time Bahadur Singh used the weapons of diplomacy, and complained to Sir George Clerk, who had just relieved Colonel Wade in charge of the British relations with the Punjab. The Raja was made to retire after pulling down the walls he had so hastily put up in token of possession. Bhai Bahadur Singh was the first of his house who had the honour of receiving a seat in the Governor-General’s Darbar. On his death, in 184 7 , seven of the jagir villages were resumed, and his son, Sampuran Singh, was confirmed in possession of one-fourth of Mauza Vandu (Ferozepore), half of Mahalan Kalahar and Ismailpur, and the whole of Shahjahanpur, Umarpura, Thriki, Gangrali, Taharwal, Talwandi and Bagarian; also in two-thirds of Ranta, Diwala and Kishangarh. Bhai Bhadur Singh has two sons Bhai Sampuran Singh, who, succeeded the bagrian Estate and Bhai Mula Singh, who, was the younger son of Bhai Sahib Bhai Bahadur Singh and Mai Dharam Kaur. Bhai Mula Singh was born in 1842 at Bagrian House. After demise of his father Bhai Mula Singh look after the maintenance of Estate at Bagrian. Soon after he became the ‘Rais of Bagrian’ and served as Magistrate at Rawalpindi at that time. Bhai Mula Singh was married to Biba Sahib Kaur of Ambala and has five son’s named as Bhai Bir Singh, Bhai Bhagwan Singh, Bhai Deva Singh, who, later became the Mandi Officer at Peshawar ilaqa., Bhai Mehar Singh & Bhai Beant Singh both of them were died in very young age at Bagrian.\n\nBhai Sahib Bhai Saumuran Singh, During the Mutiny, behaved loyally, remaining under the orders of the Deputy Commissioner of Ludhiana with a small body of horse and foot, maintained at his personal cost. For this service a year’s revenue was remitted to him, and the commutation charge in lieu of service was reduced to one anna per rupee. In 1860 he was made an Honorary Magistrate and Civil Judge in the Jhajjar ilaqa. He died two years later, and was succeeded in the estates by his son, Bhai Narayan Singh, born in 1848. Bhai Narayan Singh was invested with the powers of a Magistrate and Civil Judge in Bagarian. His influence extended all over the Malwa country and most of the Phulkians used to take the pahul at his hands. Sir Henry Davies, Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, styled him an excellent example to the rising generation of the Sikh aristocracy; and a Deputy Commissioner, who had ample opportunity of judging, put him down as one of the most loyal and enlightened Raises of the Ludhiana district. He was a Viceregal Darbari. He died in 1889, and was succeeded in his estates by his adopted son, Bhai Arjun Singh. Bhai Arjun Singh is well educated, and knows English, Persian and Gurmukhi. Like his predecessors he is regarded as the Guru of the Phulkian Chiefs and of the Malwa Sikhs. In his time he has given pahul to the Maharajas of Jind, Nahha, Faridkot and Kalsia and to numerous other Sikh chiefs and raises of the Punjab. He has established schools and maintains two langars wherein some 200 people are fed daily. During the Great War he rendered invaluable help to Government, by making extensive tours into the countryside of the Ludhiana and the Ferozepore districts and of the States of Patiala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot and Kalsia, in furtherance of recruitment. During two such tours he baptized 25,000 persons, sometimes baptizing as many as 500 a day. Bhai Arjun Singh offered about 200 men from among his own relatives, retainers and tenants as recruits, and of these 142 were actually accepted by the army. Moreover, he subscribed Rs. 40,000 to the War Loan -and other War funds and did active work on several committees organized for the furtherance of that campaign. The Bhai Sahib’s work was, indeed, considered so invaluable by the authorities that he was paid a personal visit at Bagarian by the then Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in 1919. In the course of his speech in the Darbar Hall there His Honour said, “The Bagarian family has always held wide influence among the Sikhs of the Province since its connection with the 5th Guru and your family has given proof of the Sikh spirit and of devoted loyalty to the British Raj, and in this War your influence has been most invaluable. The Sikhs have supplied over 100,000 soldiers to the Indian Forces and it is very creditable that several thousands of these were baptized by you. It is in recognition of these services, of which I have personal knowledge, that I have come to Bagarian to-day”. The Viceroy also visited him in the same year and spoke highly of his services to the Empire. The Cominander-in-Chief visited him in 1929, and, of course, the ruling Princes of the Cis-Sutlej States, including even the Nawab of Malerkotla, frequently go to him to receive his spiritual blessings. As recently as 1935 the Bhai Sahib baptized about 23,000 Sikhs of Malwa. The Bhai Sahib holds the titles of Sardar Bahadur and O.B.E., having also been the recipient of a sword of honour and several other distinctions. He is a Provincial Darbari and an Honorary Magistrate and a Civil Judge. He has been President of the Chief Khalsa Diwan, of the Central Khalsa Diwan, and of the Khalsa Religious Committee, and has served as a member of the Khalsa College Managing Committee, and of the Shromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and of many other Panthic organizations.

He has fine mansions at Simla and Solan Sardar Bahadur Bhai Arjun Singh had three sons, two of whom 'Were graduates.
