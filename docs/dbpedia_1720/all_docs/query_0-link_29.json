        "text": "The science of Nath Yoga and its ideology of dvaitavada according to which the world is shaped and sustained by the principle of dualities (the Shiva-Shakti principle), enters into a dialogue with the tenets of advaitvada in Guru Nanak's dialogue with the Siddhas – in the Siddha Goshti. The Siddha Goshti is one of Guru Nanak's longer poetic compositions believed to have been written in his late years. Written in the form of a question answer session, the interaction according to scholarship is the consolidated sumtotal of a series of such interactions that the Guru must have had during his numerous travels. In light of the 21 st century engagement with the assimilative lifestyles, yoga, health and meditation, the Siddha Goshti acquires a new relevance, a new significance. Guru Nanak delineates in it, the dynamics of god realization through Naam-Simran-yoga, he expands on the virtues of the simple life-Sahaj marga, and enumerates upon the significance of faith, surrender and meditation in the life of a Gurmukh. Keeping the Siddha Goshti in the centre, my paper endeavours to understand the relevance of Guru Nanak's spiritual dynamics and the hermeneutics that underlies his stress upon the practise of 'Naam Simran yoga.' The Siddha Goshti is one of Guru Nanak's longer poetic compositions believed to have been written in his late years. Written in verse in the interactive format of a question answer session, the Goshti according to scholarship is the consolidated sum total of a series of interactions that the Guru must have had during his numerous travels – udasis-across the Indian subcontinent. In the course of the Goshti, Guru Nanak debunks the tediousness and egocentrism of the approach of the Siddhas to god realization, and puts forth a treatise on the dynamics of the sahaja marga-simple path to god realization through Naam-Simran-yoga. He expands on the virtues of living in simran (remembrance), and cultivating god consciousness, for the humble householder who is much embroiled by demands of survival, sustenance, and duties towards family and society. For such a one Guru Nanak upholds the simple sahaja marga, he lays emphasis upon the significance of faith, surrender and meditation in the life of a Gurmukh and charts in the Siddha Goshti the dynamics of the inner journey that will eventually take the faithful to the Guru's dwaara (threshold).Thus the Siddha Goshti is a religious treatise where Guru Nanak lays down with meticulous detail the dynamics of the inner path and at the same time, critiques the Siddhas and their undesired obsession with psychic powers and self promotion. Following closely in the footsteps of Sant Kabir, Guru Nanak championed to unshackle god from the prison house of ritual, blind faith and religious dogma. Although born a Hindu he distanced himself very early in his life, from the bind of religion and attacked in the same breath both Hinduism and Islam for their oppressive hierarchical tendencies. The Mullahs and the Brahmins both were attacked equally for abusing religious privilege and misleading the common folk.\n\nThis book is on the life-story of a Siddha Yogi from Natha tradition. This is the first of the books by him - Vibhakar Lele, {Swami Yogeshwarananda}, a well-educated Yogi in his own right, published as ‘Autobiography of A Natha Siddha Yogi – Travails of A Mystique`’.

It is secular. Everyone who is on the way to Godhood, even if on the first leg of the journey, will learn a lot from this book, irrespective of his religion. It will help one to understand what the saints of every religion had experienced from their initiation to the ultimate state. It is the Oriental Wisdom in its truest form and practical demonstration. Its basis is the secret knowledge that the Indian Yogis hold close to their hearts. The scholars of the oriental disciplines will also learn a lot from it. It explains many a phenomenon of Yoga with actual experiences and their explanation, including those of the mysterious Kundalini. It is a must read for all interested in the mysteries of Yoga and Kundalini which the Siddha Yogis rarely reveal to all. The author is from the tradition of the Siddha Yogis from the Natha sect lineage of Saint Dnyaneshwar. He has revealed in this book many secrets of Yoga with experiences on the Path to which he has been privy. His book is useful also to the Shaktipata and other Kriya-yoga followers and also those who lack adequate guidance form their Gurus/peers. Secondly, it contains an important section on the Yoga and the philosophy of Gita as expounded by the great Maharashtrian Saint Dnyaneshwar. It contains an overall review for the beginners from the Yogic perspective and an all-too-important commentary on the mysterious Kundalini. Science has never explained fully the real basis of life as we know it. Overall, it will satisfy all the craving for the mysterious and the unknown that is never even scraped by the modern science. It also gives an understanding of the riddle of the Universe and Life which stands alternatively explained in most cogent terms by the Yogis and Indian philosophers. The readers may please have a look into the book and decide its value for themselves. It is a book worth keeping and preserving for a lifetime and to be passed down the generations for real wisdom of ‘Who We Are’ and ‘How We achieve the Kingdom that belongs to us’: The Nirvana, the Moksha, the Salvation or whatever one prefers to call it, ‘the Heavens’ and ‘the Godhood’ et al.

Those who are curious about Yogic experiences will have their curiosity fully satisfied. Others who are having such experiences themselves will, no doubt, be happy to find clues and explanation to their mysterious experiences. The author would be happy if it be so. *** 2.
