        "text": "The Single Desi: 20 Questions for Biba Singh\n\nBiba Singh combines two worlds – medicine and music. Yes, this Punjabi pop singer is also a doctor! The daughter of a physician, Biba, who lives in New York, has been singing since the age of 7, and first started out singing shabad in the gurudwara. She has two albums of popular music and is hugely popular. Here she talks to Monica Marwah for the Single Desi blog on pop music, careers, and the single life…\n\nI love talking with other desi single women who create and inspire. Biba Singh is a smart, beautiful and successful single desi. She is a huge inspiration for single women everywhere. She has a passion for singing. Biba also has a compassionate heart that has led her into the field of medicine. She is amazingly accomplished and fiercely independent. Talking to Biba has been an eye opener and has deepened my understanding of the life journey of other first generation desis.\n\nBiba Singh – Living in India/America\n\n1. What is your ethnic background and how did that influence you personally and professionally?\n\nMy ethnic background is Indian and I was born and raised in New York, but my parents are originally from Punjab. I have visited India very frequently and my culture and roots have greatly influenced me in many ways both professionally and personally. I believe that my work ethic and belief system originated from my ethnic background and has made me who I am today.\n\n2. Did you have any traditions in your family growing up?\n\nYes I grew up with lots of traditions and this was my favorite thing! We celebrate everything, from all the Indian holidays including Diwali, Holi, Rakhsha Bandan, to the American holidays including Christmas, Easter, Halloween, etc. Usually on any Indian holiday or birthday, my mom gets up and makes Prasad for the family. We all go into our prayer room and I amalways the “Designated singer”. So would start singing kirtan/bhajan and after the prayers were done, then we would proceed to party or celebrate the holiday. I love the festive atmosphere in my home and am very fortunate for this.\n\n3. Was it hard growing up in the United States and keeping a close contact with your ethnic roots? Did you ever go through an identity crisis when you weren’t sure what culture would work for you?\n\nYes I do think that it is difficult growing up in the United States being raised my Indian immigrant parents and being first generation. I do believe that the only reason I was able to have such a close connection with my ethnic roots is due to my mother and father, and especially my mother. She really made effort to make sure that my siblings and I would learn the culture, language and traditions. However, there was difficulty and a struggle at times, especially when I was in high school and wanted to do the normal things that “American” children would do, such as going to a high school dance, or “hanging out” with friends, but my parents would be strict about this. During those times, I used to struggle with the Indian vs. American culture, but overall, I really feel strongly connected to being an Indian and the culture, and am so glad that I was raised the way I was, because I was able to have the best of both worlds in the end.\n\nBiba – The Singing Doctor\n\n4. When did you realize you wanted to sing professionally?\n\nI never really knew I would ever sing professionally. I started singing at the age of 7 and never stopped. I remember just standing in the stairway of my home and pretending to hold a fake mike and sing loudly, imagining that I was on stage and millions were watching me. I used to have big dreams and never imagined that slowly they would start coming true.\n\n5. Do you have any favorite songs that you like to sing or hum, when you are by yourself, during quiet times, and are not performing?\n\nFavorite songs, oh my gosh! So many! Well I usually end up just singing or humming any of the newest Bollywood songs I hear around. My favorite songs that I hum at times are the\n\nDDLJ tunes, as I grew up with that movie and songs, and without even realizing it, sometimes I’m just singing them aloud.\n\n6. Who are your musical aspirations and why?\n\nBecause music is so vast and there are so many styles, it would be unfair to say that I have one musical aspiration. I think I have many role models and people that I look up to and admire.\n\nI try to learn from everyone. I love Richa Sharma and Jaspinder Narula and often try to learn from their styles of singing. My personal role models have been Bappi lahiri, Mika and Daler Mehndi who have helped me in this industry. I also just love Nusrat fateh Ali khan and his music.\n\n7. Do you have any albums that you are working on?\n\nI have already released two albums, 1. BIBA by Worldwide Records, and 2. BIBA FOR YOU by Hamara Music. Recently I have recorded 5 new songs and am planning to release each one\n\nas a single. I have already completed two music videos for the new songs.\n\n8. How do you approach composing a song and where do the ideas come from?\n\nThe ideas in a song come from different things. It could be a feeling I’m feeling, or a situation I’m in. Sometimes it is just random and comes from the heart.\n\n9. Do you give messages in your songs? If so, what are they?\n\nYes, some of my songs do have messages. Especially my most recent song Kaisi Majboori which has a very touching music video as well. This song describes the struggle of a romantic relationship and how sometimes there is love but strife at the same time. The music video also represents this theme. The other song that gives a message is Aja nachle, and this song is one that just makes me happy when I sing it. The music video also represents the same, to “just be happy and dance, sing and enjoy life.”\n\n10. Name an artist you would like to collaborate with in the future.\n\nThere are many artists that I would love to collaborate with in the future. If I had to pick one person, I guess I would say Rahat Fateh Ali khan, as his songs are so melodious and beautiful.\n\n11. You have an interesting story; you are a doctor as well as a singer. How do you find time to pursue both passions and what motivated you to keep your day job while trying your hand in music?\n\nYes, many find my story inspiring and I’m grateful for that. Being a doctor and a singer is not an easy task, but what I always tell people is that sometimes when you love to do something you make time for it and prioritize.\n\n12. What is your ultimate goal in this industry?\n\nMy ultimate goal is to make a name for myself. To be known for my voice and effort, and eventually sing for a cause and help others along the way. To be a source of motivation for other people and spread love and positivity.\n\nBiba Singh’s Words of Wisdom\n\n13. If you could write a letter to your 15-year-old self, giving her advice on what to expect from life, what would you say?\n\nThat’s a great question, if I could write a letter to myself at age 15, the advice I would give about life is: Life is difficult, and things will not come easy. Just have faith and continue to work hard and stay motivated. Those who work hard and stay positive will succeed. Keep your family and loved ones near you and don’t ever give up or lose faith in God.\n\n14. Many years from now, when you look back on your life, what do you think is likely to have mattered to you the most?\n\nYears from now and looking back, what I hope matters to me the most are the experiences I have had. I hope that I can say that I lived a life filled with happiness, and made many friends along the way. I hope that I am someone that others inspire to look up to and that I can do something good for society.\n\n15. What is most important to you at the end of the day?\n\nAt the end of the day, the most important thing to me is my family and loved ones. I think without loved ones and good relationships in life, one is alone. No matter how much success, money and fame you can have, if your loved ones are not there to share it with you, then what is the point?\n\nBiba on Dating and Relating:\n\n16. Since you are so smart and successful, is it harder to meet the men of your caliber?\n\nRegarding men, yes it is never easy finding the right man. I find that especially being in two careers and having alot of inspirations and goals, it takes someone understanding to connect with you. Deep down inside, I do believe that our soul mate is out there, and it is a matter of time that you meet the “one”.\n\n17. What kind of man are you looking for?\n\nThe ideal man to me is someone who loves me unconditionally and has similar dreams or can share goals and dreams with me and is very understanding and supportive.\n\n18. What would you do and where would you go ideally on a first date?\n\nMy ideal first date is a tough question to answer. I think that there is no “ideal” first date, because sometimes the simplest and sweetest thing can make an ideal date. It really depends on how the person makes you feel and treats you, rather than the exact place or setting.\n\n19. Who is your perfect crush and why?\n\nMy perfect crush, wow, I am not sure…. I don’t really know who I would say is my perfect crush, so I guess I will have to get back on that one 🙂\n\n20. Complete the Sentence: My idea of marriage is_______________\n\nMy idea of marriage is unconditional love, compromise and partnership.\n\nThanks for the interview Biba! It was a pleasure!\n\nxoxo\n\nMonica Marwah\n\n(Monica Marwah is a 30-something single school psychologist who enjoys living life to the fullest.
