We are so excited to present our May-June issue featuring some delightful articles — making it a perfect companion for summer reading. One the cover is the stunning Global BC broadcaster, Neetu Garcha. The beauty-with-brains recently started her new role as anchor of the weekend Global News Hour at 6pm. The issue features an exclusive interview with bollywood singer and Canadian Jonita Gandhi. Another interesting news is that the University of Calgary is soon slated to launch the nation’s first-of-its-kind Sikh Studies program. The issue also includes an exclusive interview with the new Consul General of India in Vancouver, Mr. Manish. He talks about his role, his goals for the consulate, and shares how India is dealing with the Covid-19 crisis."
