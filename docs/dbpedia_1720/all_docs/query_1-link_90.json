        "text": "ou,re line of thinking is if some physical body is cloned...the same soul then occupies both bodies?. Interesting...\n\nDo God supply one more soul to the human made clone with blank previous life karma accounts?\n\nPhysical death....would be good to learn what you think might happen to you after death based in your reading of gurbani.\n\nWho am I to guess? On one hand we admit he is Inaccessible, unapproachable, with countless celestial realms, but on other hand claim to know what happens after physical death by fabricating karma philosophy, pun paap philosphy, hell, heaven and we keep on claiming to know 'what happens after death' as we have access to His office by using secondary sources\n\nMy reference to 3 dimensions comes from the directive given by guru ji...Guru ji tells us...'you fools stop looking on the inside...god is within you'.\n\nI am not able to grasp your three dimension theory. Can you elborate\n\nJapji ji. I will reply properly on monday.\n\nIn my opinion being unapproachable and inaccessible means we cannot just walk towards Him and find him all by ourselves...his hand is needed...hence why guru ji walks a hundred steps towards you as you take one step towards him. Hence where our love and surrendering to his power takes place.\n\nI am not asking you to guess about what happens when you physically due. But this leads to my other question.\n\nDo you believe you can see him, hear him, all his countless realms and creation...the secrets of life and creation and everything beyond....all whilst alive in your physical body.. without the need to wait until death?\n\nTo me that is what guru ji said I can do...and the first step is to stop looking on the outside and start looking within. That one step is followed by guru ji keeping his end of the deal and taking a hundred steps towards you.\n\nWould be good to hear you thoughts on my question. God bless\n\nDo God supply one more soul to the human made clone with blank previous life karma accounts?\n\nWho am I to guess?

Can you elborate\n\nJapji ji,\n\nto help me understand you better, it would be interesting to have your opinion on this following question...\n\nDo you believe you can see Him, hear Him, all His countless realms and creation...the secrets of life and creation and everything beyond....all whilst alive in your physical body.. without the need to wait until death?\n\nthank you ji\n\ngod bless\n\nDo you believe you can see Him, hear Him, all His countless realms and creation...the secrets of life and creation and everything beyond....all whilst alive in your physical body.. without the need to wait until death?\n\nWhen guru sahibs says, 'ਮੈ ਪੇਖਿਓ ਰੀ ਊਚਾ ਮੋਹਨੁ ਸਭ ਤੇ ਊਚਾ ॥ ਆਨ ਨ ਸਮਸਰਿ ਕੋਊ ਲਾਗੈ ਢੂਢਿ ਰਹੇ ਹਮ ਮੂਚਾ ॥੧॥ ਰਹਾਉ ॥ He does not mean he is claiming to have seen God but is telling God residing within me is highest of all (upper than sidh, peer sur and nath) and jeo mandir ko thameh thaman - His divine intellect is support of my manh thus I can relish and be virtuous like Him. He is balhari kudrat vasia - He resides through His laws of nature and laws of nature is the will of God.\n\nWhen guru sahibs says, 'ਮੈ ਪੇਖਿਓ ਰੀ ਊਚਾ ਮੋਹਨੁ ਸਭ ਤੇ ਊਚਾ ॥ ਆਨ ਨ ਸਮਸਰਿ ਕੋਊ ਲਾਗੈ ਢੂਢਿ ਰਹੇ ਹਮ ਮੂਚਾ ॥੧॥ ਰਹਾਉ ॥ He does not mean he is claiming to have seen God but is telling God residing within me is highest of all (upper than sidh, peer sur and nath) and jeo mandir ko thameh thaman - His divine intellect is support of my manh thus I can relish and be virtuous like Him. He is balhari kudrat vasia - He resides through His laws of nature and laws of nature is the will of God.\n\nthank you ji for the reply.\n\ni agree with you wholeheartedly with regards to aligning our mind with Gurmat and Waheguru's qualities and letting them flourish in our daily actions in life. This has to be a priority in our lives.\n\nmy extension to your response is that i believe/know that we have the capacity to see the light of god and hear Waheguru Ji's Shabad within us whilst we are alive in the physical body in the present moment. if we put our dyann and focus into this..Guru Ji will surely come and take our hand.\n\nGod Bless Ji.\n\nmy extension to your response is that i believe/know that we have the capacity to see the light of god and hear Waheguru Ji's Shabad within us whilst we are alive in the physical body in the present moment. if we put our dyann and focus into this..Guru Ji will surely come and take our hand.\n\nHe has no light, He is representing himself through laws of nature and that is it. All these deras and other magician are bluffing innocents and enjoying in posh cars..\n\nHe has no light, He is representing himself through laws of nature and that is it.

But of course you are entitled to not believe me...or question these experiences\n\ni am talking from my own first hand experience, not from what anyone else has said...\n\nit is very difficult to deny ones own experience...it is very personal and profound. But of course you are entitled to not believe me...or question these experiences\n\nIf I am not wrong, are you confirming having seen the light and as such have seen the god.\n\nJap ji,\n\nHave see and heard many things which has thrown all rational thinking out the window.\n\nHave I reached home? Something inside tells me I still have a way to go.\n\nMy own observation concerning my own deeds and thought tells me I am still very much tormented by the 5 thieves albeit a lot less than in the past.\n\nWhat I have seen and heard however is enough to never ever again cast doubt on anything I read in gurbani...\n\nThis is why it is currently 4:30am and the world sleeps whilst I spend a little time with sangat (you)...some contemplation on gurbani...listening to some fantastic shbad kirtan...(recommend listening to some Biba arvindpal kaur) and then a timeless silent moment with my beloved...\n\nOne must not stop once the compass is set. This opportunity may never arise again.\n\nGod bless ji"
