        "text": "Charanjit Singh Channi\n\nIndian leader Charanjit Singh Channi was the sixteenth CM of Punjab. Currently, he is India's National Congressperson. He served as leader of the party in the Punjab Legislative Council and Minister of Technical Education and Training in the 2nd Amarinder Singh Cabinet. On March 1, 1963, Charanjit Singh Channi was born.\n\nEarly Life\n\nIn the Punjabi town of Makrauna Kalan, Channi grew in his early days. He attended Khalsa Senior Secondary School in Kharar. Currently, Channi holds an MBA degree from PTU Jalandhar as well as a law degree from Panjab University. He did PhD in Political Science from Punjab University, Chandigarh. The appointment of his father, Harsa Singh, to the local panchayat sparked Mr Channi's political ambitions.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nHe is a member of the Sikh Dalit group. He was chosen to lead the Kharar municipality committee in 2002 and has never looked back. After capturing his first MLA election as an independent candidate from Chamkaur Sahib, he was appointed for two more periods as a Congress member. He led the Punjab Legislative Party for 2 years (2015 to 2016).\n\nChief Minister of Punjab\n\nAs the previous CM, Amrinder Singh, gave his resignation, in September 2021, Mr Channi was appointed as Chief Minister of Punjab. He was the first Dalit (Scheduled Caste) Sikh who became the Chief Minister of Punjab. Columnists claimed that Congress' selection of Channi as Singh's replacement might have been influenced by Punjab's huge Dalit community and efforts through other groups to appeal to them. On September 20, with Amrinder Singh's council members, Channi, along with the new fifteen ministers, took the pledge.\n\nHe announced a few policies after reaching the office. On September 21, Channi pledged to take steps in an irreverence case and declared that he would cancel the electrical costs for water works plans and repair communications. On September 23, he announced that formerly leased \"Class D\" government employment would now be normalized. Channi opened the Dastan-e-Shahadat theme park near Chamkaur Sahib in November 2021.\n\nThe Punjab State Commission for General Category was established with Channi's approval on December 24, 2021. Channi began a free bus service for students on December 30, 2021.\n\nOn January 5, 2022, when Prime Minister was travelling through the Hussainiwala National Martyrs Memorial in the Firozpur region, PM's march was delayed for at least 20 minutes on the flyover due to a protesting farmer's blockade of the Moga-Firozpur route close to the distant town of Piarenana. Channi said he would chant the Mahamrityunjaya Prayer for the PM's protection, but he denied any security failures. In February 2022, he said that Prime Minister took revenge for not taking off his helicopter from Chand?garh.\n\nChanni was named the Congress Chief Ministry nominee for the 2022 Punjab Assembly polls at the end of the legislative assembly session. Another candidate for the Chief Minister was Navjot Singh Sidhu. For the campaign in Punjab for election, members made the slogan \"Saada Channi Saada CM,\" and in February 2022 official song was launched, \"Channi Krda Masle Hal\" by Surmandeep Mansa.\n\nChanni also participated in the 2022's Punjab Legislative Assembly elections from Chamkaur Sahib and Bhadaur legislative assembly seats but lost both seats to the opponent of the Aam Aadmi Party. Channi sent his resignation letter to the Governor on March 11, 2022, and met Bhagwant Mann (now Chief Minister of Punjab) on March 21, 2022.\n\nControversies\n\nWhen he was inducted from the cabinet of the Punjab government in 2017, his astrologer said he should construct a road in the park outside his house to improve his career in politics. Still, the road was put down by the Authorities for illegal construction. At the same time, he took a ride on an elephant on his lawn, as his astrologer said, for a better political career.\n\nHis video on social media got viral in 2018, in which he was tossing a coin for a post for which two candidates are fought. Based on this video, he was attracted to the controversies for his behaviour for the prestigious post in politics. The members of BJP and Shiromani Akali Dal indicated him for his behaviour. Later, he cleared that both candidates were eligible for the post. Channi further said the candidates themselves asked him to toss the coin that he accepted positively.\n\nIn 2018, Channi's name came for the recommendation of an IAS officer transfer. For this, he came into controversy. The report says that he didn't like the Officer at all.\n\nChanni was blamed by Aam Aadmi Party's member Sukhpal Khaira for an illegal sand mining case, but later, Channi cleared that he was not involved in such cases. He further said that the photos shown by Khaira were clicked in Public Function. He further included that his family was also not involved in this illegal mining case.\n\nIn May 2021, under the movement of #MeToo by the Punjab Women Commission, one of the cases of 2018 was reopened. In that case, Charanjit Singh Channi was blamed for sending inappropriate messages to an IAS officer Kavita Singh.\n\nFamily\n\nCharanjit Singh Channi married Dr Kamaljit Singh. The duo has two sons, Navjit Singh (who did his law degree from PEC University) and Rhythmjit Singh. Channi's father, Mr Harsa Singh elected for the Sarpanch when Channi didn't even start his political career. His mother, late Ajmer Kaur, was a housewife. He has siblings named Manmohan Singh (retired chief engineer), Dr Manohar Singh (specialist in medical for Punjab government), Sukhwant Singh (a budding leader), and one of his sisters named Surinder Kaur.\n\nFacts about Charanjit Singh Channi\n\nOn 20th September 2021, Charanjit Singh Channi was appointed as the Chief Minister of Punjab.
