        "text": "There's no doubt that with the popularity of smartphones that can manage virtually every aspect of our lives, the trend in technology is to get more and more \"connectivity\" into smaller and smaller packages.\n\nSimultaneously, wrist watches have become a lesson in technological redundancy for many people. Ask a friend for the time of day and they're just as likely to glance at their smartphone as they are to look at an actual wrist-bound timepiece. The newest wave of smart watches aims to change all that\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmart watches are digital watches that do more – a lot more – that your old analog time tracking device. We're not talking about that once-amazing calculator watch that you had in elementary school. These are full-fledged digital tools.\n\nSmart watches can run apps and play back all sorts of digital media, like audio tracks or radio streamed to Bluetooth headphones. Many of these watches have touchscreens, which allow you to access functions like a calculator, thermometer, compass and more.\n\nMost of the current iterations of smart watches aren't wholly standalone devices, simply because they lack an Internet connection. So many of the watches are designed to link directly with other devices that do have Internet connectivity, namely your smartphone.\n\nJust as with your smartphone, Internet access enables a smart watch with whole world of potential capabilities, like message notifications, GPS navigation and calendar synchronization. And of course, a Bluetooth connection to your phone means the watch can help you place calls or send and receive messages.\n\nSome smart watches are made specifically for athletics purposes, letting you track your lap times, distance and route. They may work in tandem with accessories such as a heart rate monitor or cadence sensor. There are specialty smart watches built especially for sailing enthusiasts, helping them track variables such as speed, wind direction and wind speed.\n\nTo many people, these newfangled watches might look like a brand new technology. The truth, however, is that smart watches have been lurking on the fringes of gadgetry for a long time. The very first may have been Microsoft's UC-2000, a digital watch released in 1984 that could be programmed in BASIC via its keypad. In 2002, Microsoft introduced a technology called Smart Personal Object Technology, or SPOT, designed to add new purpose to everyday objects by integrating so-called smart software. Watches built around SPOT were discontinued in in 2008, but the idea of the smart watch lived on.\n\nMany people think that it's finally time to usher the digital wizardry of smart watches into the mainstream. Keep reading and you'll find out why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmart watches aren't going to sneak up on anyone. Digital watches with built-in computer functions have been around since the 1970s. But most of these watches had comparatively primitive capabilities.\n\nWell-known brands such as Seiko, Pulsar and Casio have all produced watches with some digital capabilities. They could store bits of information, crunch numbers and even let you play some basic games. Swatch, Fossil and Microsoft all followed with their own versions, none of which really made an impact on consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of functionality, current smart watches generally don't do anything particularly groundbreaking. They simply shrink many of your smartphone's features into a form factor that you can wear on your wrist. But with miniaturized technology advancing at high speed, some people think watches are ready for the masses.\n\nAnalysts at NextMarket Insights see a huge potential for smart watches. They anticipate sales going from a relatively paltry 14 million in 2014 to a whopping 373 million before the end of 2020 [source: NextMarket].\n\nMany companies, including some corporate heavyweights, are hoping that smart watches will mean big profits. Samsung, Sony, Qualcomm, Motorola, Nissan, Adidas and Timex already sell versions of smart watches. Blackberry, Toshiba and LG want to be in the mix, too, and as of 2013, there are loud rumors that both Google and Apple intend to crash the smart watch party as soon as possible.\n\nOther numbers may be telling as to the direction of smart watch sales. NextMarket anticipates that about half of all smart watch sales will run Google's Android operating system [source: NextMarket]. For anyone even vaguely familiar with Android's current domination in the smartphone market, it's easy to see why Google could be an odds-on favorite to rule your wrist.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. To date, smart watches haven't created much buzz with buyers. There are some powerful products out there, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are already dozens of smart watches for sale. Here are a few of the most–talked-about versions.\n\nThe Sony SmartWatch 2 features a 1.6-inch (4-centimeter) square touchscreen face in a body that's 0.3 inches (7.6 millimeters) thick. The touchscreen recognizes typical gestural commands, including swipe and pinch, and you can display a digital or analog-ish clock face by default. It's water resistant and has NFC capabilities, in addition to Bluetooth. In a nod to the importance of looks, Sony lets you substitute any 24-millimeter (0.94-inch) watchband for the rubberized factory model. It comes with a USB port for data transfer and charging, and under moderate use, the battery lasts about four days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SW2 is designed to pair with a number of Sony smartphones through Bluetooth. Once paired, you'll be able to use the watch to reject or mute phone calls, receive a call (if you have a compatible headset), control music playback, and check Facebook, Twitter and text messages. Because SmartWatch 2 is an Android device, you can download many apps from the Google Play store and run them on your watch. Sony indicates that there are around 200 apps specifically designed for SmartWatch. As of late 2013, it retailed for about $200.\n\nA startup company called Pebble makes one of the best-selling smart watches as of late 2013. The $150 Pebble watch actually backs away from attempting to duplicate your smartphone's functions. Instead, it does a few things very well, and in a package that's more stylish than most other models. For example, you can choose from hundreds of watch faces to change the look of the watch with just a press. Pebble is 2 inches (5 centimeters) long, 1.4 inches (3.6 centimeters) wide and 0.4 inches (10.2 millimeters) thick.\n\nIt features an ARM Cortex-M3 processor and a 3D accelerometer, which is helpful when using the watch in tandem with an athletics-minded app like RunKeeper on your phone. It's also waterproof and boasts weeklong battery life. Instead of using a power-sucking touchscreen LCD display, it has a monochrome e-paper screen like the ones you see on digital book readers. That means you'll have to navigate menus using side-mounted buttons.\n\nPebble works with both Android and iPhone operating systems. Once paired to your smartphone through Bluetooth 4.0, the Pebble displays message text and allows you to control music playback. The maker promises that many more features are forthcoming.\n\nSamsung's $300 Galaxy Gear is loaded with features, including 4GB memory, voice command input, a 1.9 megapixel camera (for both video and stills), voice memo, pedometer and speaker. It has a 1.6-inch (4.1-centimeter) display, and is nearly half and inch (about 1.3 centimeters) thick. It's designed to work seamlessly with apps such as Runtastic and RunKeeper. Samsung also includes a version of Evernote that's been tweaked to work best with their watch, so that you can easily pair photos and voice notes in a rush.\n\nGoophone, a company perhaps best known for selling counterfeit iPhones, is taking the smart watches seriously. The Goophone Smart Watch is a wholly independent device; that is, it actually has built-in antennas so that you can use it to make calls sans your smartphone. A 2G version costs $250, while the higher-speed 3G variant is $300. It's equipped with a 1.5-inch (3.8-centimeter) screen, a 1.2GHz processor, 512MB of RAM and a 2-megapixel camera. It is truly a smartphone crammed into a wrist-mounted body. It runs on an older version of the Android operating system, which means that it won't work with many newer apps.\n\nWhile some models are better than others, it's clear that even industry titans are still struggling to make successful smart watches. On the next page you'll see why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmart watches haven't exploded in popularity for various reasons. The technological hurdles are high. And the fashion faux pas are, well, unforgivable.\n\nLet's start with the tech side. Because human wrists are only so big, wrist watches must be extremely compact. In turn, this means the display must be small. That means a populace accustomed to ridiculously oversized smartphone screens must learn to use a substantially smaller interface on a smart watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also means that software developers must find intuitive graphical interfaces that fit a watch's limited display area. As programmers who create smartphone apps can attest, this challenge can make or break a product.\n\nBattery life is another notable design challenge. Current battery technology will only power a glowing smart watch with myriad functions for a few hours. After that, it's back to the charger.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the fashion aspect of smart watches. Like it or not, a watch is a fashion item, and it reflects directly on your ability to dress yourself properly in the morning. Most manufacturers are still struggling to combine features and fashion in ways that don't shriek \"geek.\" The designs tend to be clunky, obnoxiously large and likely to clash with any wardrobe that rises above casual. A smart watch at a black tie affair? Let the chortling begin.\n\nGiven manufacturers' struggles in perfecting smart watches, it's worth wondering why people would want them so badly, anyway. One reason is that smartphones are so demanding of our attention. Everywhere you go, you see people grasping and staring into their phones, as if they were the window to their soul (and perhaps they are).\n\nA gadget that's more passive and less obtrusive -- such as a watch -- could potentially change the way we interact with personal gadgets. Rather than constantly occupying one or both sets of fingers, a watch can simply rest on your person. The right watch, then, might help you reclaim some of the mental territory that's been overrun by the smartphone army.\n\nAdvertisement"
