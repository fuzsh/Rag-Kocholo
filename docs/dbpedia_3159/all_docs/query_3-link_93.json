        "text": "Tech support scammers want you to believe you have a serious problem with your computer, like a virus. They want you to pay for tech support services you don't need, to fix a problem that doesn’t exist. They often ask you to pay by wiring money, putting money on a gift card, prepaid card, or cash reload card, or using cryptocurrency or a money transfer app because they know those types of payments can be hard to reverse.\n\nSpotting and Avoiding Tech Support Scams\n\nTech support scammers use many different tactics to trick people. Spotting these tactics will help you avoid falling for the scam.\n\nPhone calls\n\nTech support scammers often call and pretend to be a computer technician from a well-known company. They say they’ve found a problem with your computer. They typically ask you to give them remote access to your computer and then pretend to run a diagnostic test. Then they try to make you pay to fix a problem that doesn’t exist. Listen to an FTC undercover call with a tech support scammer.\n\nIf you get a phone call you didn’t expect from someone who says there’s a problem with your computer, hang up.\n\nPop-up warnings\n\nTech support scammers may try to trick you with a pop-up window that appears on your computer screen. It might look like an error message from your operating system or antivirus software, and it might use logos from trusted companies or websites. The message in the window warns you about a security issue on your computer and tells you to call a phone number to get help.\n\nIf you get this kind of pop-up window on your computer, don’t call the number. Real security warnings and messages will never ask you to call a phone number.\n\nOnline ads and listings in search results pages\n\nTech support scammers try to get their websites to show up in online search results for tech support. Or they might run their own ads online. The scammers are hoping you’ll call the phone number to get help.\n\nIf you’re looking for tech support, go to a company you know and trust.\n\nTwo Things To Know To Avoid a Tech Support Scam\n\n1. Legitimate tech companies won’t contact you by phone, email, or text message to tell you there’s a problem with your computer.\n\n2. Security pop-up warnings from real tech companies will never ask you to call a phone number or click on a link.\n\nWhat To Do if You Think There’s a Problem With Your Computer\n\nIf you think there may be a problem with your computer, update your computer’s security software and run a scan.\n\nIf you need help fixing a problem, go to someone you know and trust. Many software companies offer support online or by phone. Stores that sell computer equipment also offer technical support in person.\n\nWhat To Do if You Were Scammed\n\nIf you paid a tech support scammer with a credit or debit card, you may be able to stop the transaction. Contact your credit card company or bank right away. Tell them what happened and ask if they can reverse the charges.\n\nIf you paid a tech support scammer with a gift card, contact the company that issued the card right away. Tell them you paid a scammer with the gift card and ask if they can refund your money.\n\nIf you gave a scammer remote access to your computer, update your computer’s security software. Then run a scan and delete anything it identifies as a problem.\n\nIf you gave your username and password to a tech support scammer, change your password right away. If you use the same password for other accounts or sites, change it there, too. Create a new password that is strong.\n\nAvoid Tech Support Refund Scams\n\nIf someone calls to offer you a refund for tech support services you paid for, it’s likely a fake refund scam. How does the scam work? The caller will ask if you were happy with the services you got. If you say, “No,” they’ll offer you a refund. In another variation, the caller says the company is giving out refunds because it’s going out of business. No matter their story, they’re not giving refunds. They’re trying to steal more of your money. Don’t give them your bank account, credit card, or other payment information.\n\nReporting Tech Support Scams\n\nIf a tech support scammer contacts you, report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.\n\nWhen you report a scam, the FTC uses the information to build cases against scammers. Are you skeptical that reporting scams will make a difference? Watch this video to learn how your story helps the FTC stop scammers.\n\nNow that you know how to recognize a tech support scam, share what you learned with someone you know. You might help them avoid a tech support scam.\n\nImage\n\nOur Anatomy of an Imposter Scam blog series breaks down how to recognize, avoid, and report business and government imposter scams."
