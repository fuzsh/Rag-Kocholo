        "meta_description": "Learning is a natural human activity that is shaped by personal experiences, cognitive awareness, personal bias, opinions, cultural background, and environment. Learning has been defined as a stable and persistent change in what a person knows and can do. Learning is formed through an individual’s interactions, including the conveyance of knowledge and skills from others and experiences. So, learning is a personalized experience that allows one to expand their knowledge, perspective, skills, and understanding. Therefore, personalized learning models can help to meet individual needs and goals. Furthermore, to personalize the learning experience, technology integration can play a crucial role. This paper provides a review of the recent research literature on personalized learning as technology is changing how learning can be effectively personalized. The emphasis is on the terms used to characterize learning as those can suggest a framework for personalized and will eventually be used in meta-analyses of research on personalized learning, which is beyond the scope of this paper.",

        "text": "Personalized learning has been a topic of research for a long time. However, around 2008, personalized learning started to draw more attention and take on a transformed meaning as seen in Fig. 1. However, we believe the variety of terms that have been used for personalized learning seems to be an obstacle to the progress of personalized learning theories and research. Although there exists an abundance of the resources/studies on personalized learning, not having a readily agreed-upon term of personalized learning might be the obstacle in research progress on personalized learning. In response to this need, this paper is focused on analyzing the terms that have been used for personalized learning. A distinctly personalized learning approach can help the educational researchers to build up research on previous data, instead of trying to start new research from scratch each time. This paper will present a research-based framework for personalized learning and discuss future research directions, issues, and challenges through an in-depth analysis of the definitions and terms used for personalized learning.\n\nPersonalized learning has existed for hundreds of years in the form of apprenticeship and mentoring. As educational technologies began to mature in the last half of the previous century, personalized learning took the form of intelligent tutoring systems. In this century, big data and learning analytics are poised to transform personalized learning once again. Learning has been characterized as a stable and persistent change in what a person knows and can do (Spector, 2015). Personalized learning is a complex activity approach that is the product of self-organization (Chatti, 2010; Miliband, 2006) or learning and customized instruction that considers individual needs and goals. Personalized learning can be an efficient approach that can increase motivation, engagement and understanding (Pontual Falcão, e Peres, Sales de Morais and da Silva Oliveira, 2018), maximizing learner satisfaction, learning efficiency, and learning effectiveness (Gómez, Zervas, Sampson and Fabregat, 2014). However, while such personalized learning is now possible, it remains as one of the biggest challenges in modern educational systems. In this paper a review of progress in personalized learning using current technologies is provided. The emphasis is on the characteristics of personalized learning that need to be taken into consideration to have a well-developed concept of personalized learning.\n\nWe started with the definition of personalized learning suggested by Spector (2014, 2018) and others that are discussed below, which requires a digital learning environment to be classified as a personalized learning environment to be adaptive to individual knowledge, experience and interests and to be effective and efficient in supporting and promoting desired learning outcomes. These characteristics are those which are typically discussed in the research community although we found it challenging to find a sufficient number of published cases that reported effect sizes and details of the sample in order to conduct a formal meta-analysis. Lacking those cases suggests that personalized learning in the digital era is still in its infancy. As a result, we conducted a more informal albeit systematic review of published research on personalized learning.\n\nFurthermore, we, along with many educational technologists, believe an efficient personalized learning approach can increase learners’ motivation and engagement in learning activities so that improved learning results. While that outcome now seems achievable, it remains a largely unrealized opportunity according to this research review. Truong (2016) stated that providing the same content to students with different qualifications and personal traits and having different interests and needs is not considered adequate anymore when learning can now be personalized. Miliband (2006, as cited in Lee, Huh, Lin and Reigeluth, 2018) promoted personalized learning to be the solution to tailoring the learning according to individuals’ needs and prior experience so as to allow everyone to reach their maximum potential through customized instruction (Hsieh and Chen, 2016; Lin, Yeh, Hung and Chang, 2013).The customized instruction that includes what is taught, how it is taught, and the pace at which it is taught. This allows learning to meet individual needs, interests and circumstances which can be quite diverse (Brusilovsky and Peylo, 2003; Liu and Yu, 2011). Furthermore, FitzGerald et al. (2018) pointed out the personalization of learning is now a recurring trend across government agencies, popular media, conferences, research papers, and technological innovations.\n\nPersonalized learning is in demand (Huang, Liang, Su and Chen, 2012) due to new technologies involving big data and learning analytics. It should be tailored to and continuously modified to an individual learner’s conditions, abilities, preferences, background knowledge, interests, and goals and adaptable to the learner’s evolving skills and knowledge (Sampson, Karagiannidis and Kinshuk, 2002; Sharples, 2000). Today’s personalized learning theories are inspired by educational philosophy from the progressive era in the previous century, especially John Dewey’s (1915, 1998) emphasis on experiential, learner-centered learning, social learning, extension of the curriculum, and fitting for a changing world. McCombs and Whisler (1997; as cited in Lee et al., 2018) claimed that a learner-centered environment develops as it considers learners’ unique characteristics using the best knowledge of teaching and learning which are available. Furthermore, Lockspeiser and Kaul (2016) claimed that individualized learning is a tool to facilitate learner-centered education. FitzGerald et al. (2018) pointed out that personalization is a crucial topic of current interest in technology-oriented learning design and discussion for government policymakers, but less so in educational research. This might be a good explanation of disunity of personalized learning approaches.\n\nOn the other hand, Niknam and Thulasiraman (2020) argued that educational society has been interested in having a personalized learning system that adjusts the pedagogy, curriculum, and learning environment for learners to meet their learning needs and preferences. A personalized learning system can adapt itself when providing learning support to different learners to defeat the weakness of one-size-fits-all approaches in technology-enabled learning systems. The goal is to have a learning system that can dynamically adapt itself based on a learner’s characteristics and needs to provide personalized learning. Human one-on-one tutors can do this and now it is possible for digital systems to do so as well. Schmid and Petko (2019) pointed out that a look at international research literature shows that personalized learning is a multilayered construct with numerous definitions and various forms of implementation. Which supports our claim that one of the most critical problems with personalized learning is, there is no readily agreed-upon meaning of the phrase ‘personalized learning’. Schmid and Petko (2019) supported this claim by stating that a clearly defined concept of personalized learning is still lacking; instead, it serves as an umbrella term for educational strategies that try to do justice to the individual’s abilities, knowledge, and learning needs of each student. Spector (2013) claimed that there would be more robust information to support personalized learning as technology develops. So many different terms have been used in the replacement of ‘personalized learning’. Researchers could not locate a systematic literature review on personalized learning terms that review the terms that have been used for personalized learning, and it is important to address this need. Therefore, this review was done to close that gap and respond to the need for a unified, personalized learning term. As a result, personalized learning definitions and the terms that have been used interchangeably, such as adaptive learning, individualized instruction, and customized learning are analyzed in this paper. These terms were chosen because they have been most used in the education field (Reisman, 2014). In the next several sections, each term will be defined, and their relationship with personalized learning will be discussed. The analysis of these terms guided the systematic review of the research literature that follows.\n\nAdaptive learning\n\nMost educators recognize the advantages of adaptive learning, but evidence-based research stays limited as adaptive learning is still evolving (Liu, McKelroy, Corliss and Carrigan, 2017). Adaptive learning is one of the terms that has been used interchangeably with personalized learning. The adaptive learning system is built on principles that have been around for a very long time dating back to the era of apprenticeship training and human tutoring. However, many other labels such as individualized instruction, self-paced instruction, and personalized instruction were used interchangeably while trying to produce the most suitable sequence of learning units for each learner (Garcia-Cabot, De-Marcos and Garcia-Lopez, 2015; Reisman, 2014). While early forms of adaptive learning (e.g., apprenticeship training and human tutoring) only dealt with one or a very small number of learners, the current interest is using adaptive learning for large numbers of learners, which is why there is such interest in big data and learning analytics.\n\nFor instance, adaptive learning has been interchangeably used by Yang, Hwang and Yang (2013) in their study that focused on the development of adaptive learning by considering students’ preferences (Dwivedi and Bharadwaj, 2013) and characteristics, including learning styles (Çakıroğlu, 2014; Klašnja-Milićević, Vesin, Ivanović and Budimac, 2011) and cognitive styles (Lo, Chan and Yeh, 2012) which concluded to be effective. Wang and Liao (2011) defined adaptive learning as a developed system (Lu, Chang, Kinshuk, Huang and Chen, 2014) to accommodate a variety of individual differences (Scheiter et al., 2019; Wang & Liao, 2011) such as gender, learning motivation, cognitive type, and learning style to determine optimal adaptive learning experience that accommodates a variety of individual differences (Afini Normadhi et al., 2019) to remove barriers of time and location. Griff and Matter (2013) discussed that adaptive learning is also referred to as computer-based learning, adaptive educational hypermedia, and intelligent tutoring. Furthermore, Hooshyar, Ahmad, Yousefi, Yusop and Horng (2015) used personalized and adaptive learning to explain the importance of the Intelligent Tutoring System (Aeiad and Meziane, 2019) for implementing one-to-one personalized and adaptive teaching. “Although the terms ‘personalized learning’ and ‘adaptive learning’ are different, they are often used interchangeably in various studies” (Aroyo et al., 2006; Göbel et al., 2010; Gómez et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2013, as cited in Xie, Chu, Hwang and Wang, 2019, p.2).\n\nBased on this review, adaptive learning systems are defined as those that are computerized learning systems that adapt learning content, presentation styles, or learning paths based on individual students’ profiles, learning status, or human factors (Chen, Liu and Chang, 2006; Tseng et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2013).\n\nIndividualized instruction\n\nIndividualized instruction is one of the terms that are often used to talk about the specific needs and goals of individuals to be addressed during instruction. U.S. Department of Education (2010) defined personalized learning as involving customizing the learning pace to individual learners (individualization), tailoring instructional methods (differentiation), and personalizing learning content. This notion has evolved from one-on-one human tutoring. It is not agreed upon whether individualization is a component of personalized learning or another term that can be used in place of personalized learning. The review results show that instead of being a component, individualized instruction has been used as a replacement term for personalized learning and is a product of personalized learning. Chatti, Jarke and Specht (2010) and Chou, Lai, Chao, Lan and Chen (2015) had used both terms without defining/explaining how they relate to each other. Bahçeci and Gürol (2016) created a portal that offers individualized learning content based on the individual’s level of cognitive knowledge. Bahçeci and Gürol (2016) stated that education should be done by recognizing the individual differences of the students such as students learning styles (Çakıroğlu, 2014; Klašnja-Milićević et al., 2011) and characteristics. The researchers observed that Bahçeci and Gürol (2016) used individualized learning and personalized learning interchangeably without pointing out that they were doing so.\n\nAlso, most individualized learning studies have used individualized instruction to refer to IEP (individualized educational plans) for students with disabilities to accommodate their needs and goals. Even though individualized instruction is suggested as an approach that individualize material to improve the learning experience for students with learning disabilities, it can benefit all students (Barrio et al., 2017; Ko, Chiang, Lin and Chen, 2011). Personalized learning considers students’ interests, needs, readiness, and motivation and adapts to their progress by situating the learner at the center of the learning process. Individualized learning allows for individualization of learning based on the learner’s unique needs (Cavanagh, 2014; Lockspeiser & Kaul, 2016). While a learner-centered paradigm of education has influenced personalized learning, the current teacher-student ratios in school systems seem to be an obstacle to make learning experiences personalized for individual students without technology (Lee et al., 2018), with the exception of the requirement for IEPs in many school districts. We follow the definition offered by the U.S. Department of Education and note that individualized learning in school systems requires significant technology support, such as big data and learning analytics.\n\nCustomized learning\n\nWhile Lee et al. (2018) suggested a learner-centered system that supports diverse needs and development of individual learners’ potentials. This system develops customized instructional methods and learning content for individual learners with unique characteristics and interests. Lee et al. (2018) suggested that learner-centered learning and personalized learning are blended and considered together. Lee et al. (2018) defined a personalized learning plan (PLP) that refers to a customized instructional plan (Somyürek, 2015) that considers individual differences and needs, characteristics, interests, and academic mastery. The PLP includes the notions of individualization, differentiation, and personalization that allows learning to be personally relevant, engaging, appropriate to the learners’ capabilities, and respectful of individual differences, making learning useful and motivational.\n\nThe review of those three terms reveals a great deal of overlap with an emphasis on the need to use technology to support such efforts. This study reviews definitions of personalized learning terms used in research papers from 2010 to 2020 by systematically reviewing the literature to compare the similarities and differences in definitions of each of these terms. The hope is to synthesize the terms used for personalized learning so the researchers can analyze and go through the research in the field and conduct meta-analyses and syntheses of the research literature. Also, analyzing the definitions of the term ‘personalized learning’, ‘adaptive learning’, ‘individualized instruction’, and ‘customized learning’ that have been used can help to develop a unified definition for personalized learning that can lead a framework. The framework can help with having a common understanding of personalized learning rather than a collection of loosely defined systems. A unified description of personalized learning and analyzing the studies related to personalized learning can help consolidate findings and suggest new areas to explore.\n\nOur idea of personalized learning rests on the foundation that humans learn through experience and by constructing knowledge. Constructivism claims that learners’ acquired knowledge and understanding, determine learning ability and that knowledge acquisition is a process of construction according to individuals’ experience (Ormrod, 2011). Personalized learning is influenced by a learner’s prior experiences, backgrounds, interests, needs, goals, and motivation. Moreover, it is accomplished via meaningful interactions in individual learners’ lives. Furthermore, no conscious effort is needed to be actively learning while engaged in everyday life (Kinshuk, 2012) although reflection and mega-cognition can promote learning.\n\nAdaptive instruction, blended instruction, differentiation, customized instruction, individualized learning, adaptive learning, proactive supports, real-world connections, and applications are hallmarks of good personalized learning. In general, personalized-learning models seek to adapt to the pace of learning and the instructional strategies, content and activities being used to fit best each learner’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Personalized learning is about giving students some control over their learning (Benhamdi, Babouri and Chiky, 2017; Jung, Kim, Yoon, Park and Oakley, 2019; Tomberg, Laanpere, Ley and Normak, 2013), differentiating instruction for each learner, and providing real-time individualized feedback to teachers and learners (Nedungadi and Raman, 2012), which is all effortlessly blended throughout the learning activity. Putting a framework together can help with a practical personalized learning model for all. The model can be developed and evolved as technology develops and we learn more about human learning and machine learning.\n\nThe idea of personalized learning rests on the foundation that humans learn through experience and by constructing knowledge. It is heavily influenced by a learner’s prior experiences and is accomplished via language and social interaction. Personalized learning is not the only way to think about teaching and learning. Moreover, learning will and should take many different forms. Proper instruction, blended instruction, differentiation, proactive supports, real-world connections, and applications are hallmarks of good, sound personalized learning. In general, personalized-learning models seek to adapt to the pace of learning and the instructional strategies, content and activities being used to fit best each learner’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Personalized learning is about giving students control over their learning, differentiating instruction for each child, and providing real-time feedback. Putting a framework together can help with practical personalized learning for all and can be developed as it faces challenges. The framework can help with having a structured common-sense personalized learning instead of a learning system that is being interpreted differently. In conjunction with a well-designed curriculum, instructional practice plays a crucial role in how children learn.\n\nMost of the current personalized learning models/ideas are built on technology integration. For example, while Chen, Lee and Chen (2005) proposed a personalized system that provides learning paths (Nabizadeh, Gonçalves, Gama, Jorge and Rafsanjani, 2020) that can be adapted to various levels of difficulty of course materials (Zou and Xie, 2018) and various abilities of learners (p. 239). Klašnja-Milićević et al. (2011) stated that personalized learning occurs when e-learning systems make deliberate efforts to design educational experiences (Flores, Ari, Inan and Arslan-Ari, 2012) that fit the needs, goals, talents, motivations, and interests of their learners (p. 885). The term of needs is not specified to clarify what needs of the learner need to be considered for robust personalized learning. Considering the needs of the learner is one of the most common components used in personalized learning. However, only a few studies clarify what needs are mentioned to be considered, such as emotional needs, social needs, learning needs, knowledge needs, etc. Even if we agree on a unified definition with each component commonly agreed on, we need to ensure that each component is well defined.\n\nIn the past decades, many methods and systems have been proposed to accommodate students’ needs by proposing learning environments that consider personal factors. Learning styles (Çakıroğlu, 2014; Klašnja-Milićević et al., 2011; Latham, Crockett and McLean, 2014) have been among the broadly chosen components in previous studies as a reference for adapting learning. For example, George and Lal (2019) argued that personalized learning is meant to incorporate a learner’s varied attributes, including learning style, knowledge level on a subject, preferences, and learner’s prior knowledge while they discussed adaptive learning is adapting content according to learner’s choice and pace. Chen, Huang, Shih and Chang (2016) brought up the gender component to personalized learning. Furthermore, Atkinson (2006) found that there was a significant difference in learning achievement between male and female students, and among students who used different learning styles (Çakıroğlu, 2014; Klašnja-Milićević et al., 2011; Latham et al., 2014).\n\nOur findings revealed that individualized instruction mostly focuses on special education students or students are limited in way compared to their peers. These students have IEPs (individualized educational plans) mandated by the state to be followed to ensure the schools are accommodating these students’ needs. One goal could be to create IEPs for all learners.\n\nMoreover, it seems in education industry terms are quite varied, but when it comes to academia, it is mostly adaptive learning and personalized learning being used interchangeably Rastegarmoghadam and Ziarati (2017); however, mostly adaptive learning is being used when it is technology-enhanced learning. Adaptivity is typically referring to content being adjusted according to prior knowledge (Huang and Shiu, 2012), while personalized learning is being used for more broad adjustments according to different needs, interests, and goals of individuals.\n\nAnother finding is that adaptive learning is the most used term follows personalized learning. Individualized learning and customized learning, even though they are being used by cooperative, they are not commonly used in research. As shown in Table 4, we have found 56 papers met the minimum quality criteria and were examined in detail; 33 of them use personalized learning, 17 adaptive learning, three individualized instruction, and three customized learning.\n\nHowever, it seems that also the lack of a commonly identified personalized learning approach is an obstacle. This might be due to the nature of technology involvement; due to the rapid development increase in technology that makes personalized learning an evolving approach. That is fine if we all can agree that it should evolve as technology improves, and we learn more about humans and how human-machine interaction can improve the learning process.\n\nBesides, another obstacle is the researchers and policymakers should show the same interest to personalized learning so the demand and research can align. Educators fear that machines will take over the teaching job if they allow technology to be used for teaching. Kinshuk, Huang, Sampson and Chen (2013) argued that the benefits of technology in education caught the interest of researchers, governments, and funding agencies. Computer systems were funded to help students in the learning process, consequently decreasing teachers’ workload. As a result, educational technology research was able to study advanced issues such as intelligent tutoring, simulations, advanced learning management systems, automatic assessment systems, and adaptive systems. Some educators believe that since technology involves big budgets, the interest of policymakers is not due to the interest of improving learning experience (Troussas, Krouska and Sgouropoulou, 2020); their interest is due to the monetary benefit they gain from increased use of technology in education. In addition, Kinshuk et al. (2013) pointed out that practitioners in education could not take advantage of all that research at an equally fast pace, and the implementation lagged severely behind. Researchers need to keep up with the demand of personalized learning. The alignment will help to ensure the practices policy makers discuss are research based efficient approaches that will increase efficiency of learning/teaching.\n\nThe progress of the research in personalized learning shows that by technological improvement, personalized learning becomes more embedded with technology and taking advantage of the benefits technology can offer. Some of these advantages are gathering data of learners’ emotions by using bio-trackers, which might bring up some privacy concerns."
