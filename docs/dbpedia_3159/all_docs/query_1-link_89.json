        "text": "The way technologies are blooming, sooner the world will be ruled by a plethora of gadgets and devices.\n\nDo you agree?\n\nLook around you! I am sure; you will…\n\nBelonging to a tech millennial, we all are the tech-savvy generation who want digitization and plug-and-play anything and everything at every moment. This is the reason each new technology gets an overwhelming response and adoption from our generation. One of such technology is “Wearable” about which the tech world is buzzing around. They convert your objects into plug-and-play gadgets!\n\nWell, I guess you must have a thorough idea about what wearable technology is all about, or maybe you are one of the users of it.\n\nUmmm… Still, let’s start by sharing a basic idea about it.\n\nWearable technology is a group of technology devices that can be worn by users to track various personal activities. On the other hand, few of the wearable tech gadgets contain small motion sensors that sync the data of wearable devices with your smartphone.\n\nHere, you might think about the possibilities of how wearable devices disrupt your personal space.\n\nAm I right?\n\nYes, wearable technology has been deemed as a game-changer strategy for tech leaders, as it has assertively started showing its presence in our day-to-day lives. See how wearables will reshape the world around you by making it better and smarter.\n\n7 Next-Generation Wearable Technologies\n\n1. Apple Vision Pro\n\nApple Vision Pro is a wearable headset that will feature \"extended reality\" (XR) technology, which allows users to leave the boundaries of their screens by utilizing capabilities similar to augmented reality. It offers an immersive canvas that features all the iOS apps that normal Apple consumers have grown to appreciate.\n\nThrough the power of Vision OS, Apple's newest operating system, users can take notes, FaceTime, arrange documents, create images, and text their connections. A brand-new framework called VisionOS offers a complete toolchain for creating expansive spatial experiences in augmented or extended reality.\n\nThe experiences offered by the gadget are made possible by an incredible amount of state-of-the-art hardware and software components. The aluminum alloy frame has several internal cameras and sensors, and a Light Seal keeps stray light beams out of the user's line of sight. Presenting realistic visuals and reading your motions and facial expressions with the aid of cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms trains the system in real time. A micro-OLED display technology, raytracing, and innovative dual-chip design are a few other patented innovations contributing to the outstanding user experience.\n\n2. Google Glass\n\nGoogle Glass is a pioneer in the wearable industry. It is the perfect example of wearable technology as well! Google Glass displays information in a hands-free format. Users can interact with the Internet through natural voice command and language.\n\nOnce you wear this glass, you will have all world’s knowledge in front of your eyesight. It is possible by accessing the Google Search into a small LCD screen near to your eyes. The display is controlled by the touch and voice on the frame. Furthermore, Google Glass allows users to surf the internet, make a call, as well as click, share and record whatever you see.\n\n3. Smartwatches\n\nOne of the most trending wearable gadgets of this time. Smartwatch simply brings your smartphone at your wrist. It allows you to download and access various applications into it just like your phone. It enables users to receive important notifications at their wrists, run native apps, track exercise over GPS, search internet with the voice, develop custom apps specifically for the watch as per personal use, and much more.\n\n4. Wristbands\n\nIf you are a fitness freak, then wearable devices called ‘fitness trackers’ help you in tracking your daily workouts. Furthermore, these trackers are a blessing for anyone having a serious health issue that has to be monitored continuously.\n\nFitness tracker helps you in checking your health progress and making effective fitness goals by allowing you to monitor your heartbeat rate, calorie consumption, oxygen level, blood sugar level, skin temperature, nutrient intake, sleep cycle, and much more. Gym enthusiasts and athletes are increasingly using fitness trackers to check out daily updates about their health and fitness.\n\nWristbands also facilitate users with remote health monitoring solutions. It saves an exorbitant amount of money and time for in-person health monitoring through the doctor. In another way, wearable technologies enable patients to diagnose their health issues quickly and keep a close watch on their health condition.\n\n5. Interactive Clothes\n\nThe health sensors can be covered into the t-shirts and inner wear as well! It also helps users to monitor their fitness and health parameters remotely. Sometimes, it works as a lifesaving partner for aged people and users who are suffering from acute or chronic deceases by catering them an alarm system during any medical emergency.\n\n6. GPS Shoes\n\nGPS system is the blessing for hikers, hunters or riders who frequently walk around weird and unknown places. Until the time, they used to check the proper navigation by accessing the GPS app on their smartphones. But now there are GPS shoes are in the market. You can connect the shoes with your smartphone via Bluetooth.\n\nNow, you can get all direction notifications from the shoes. No need to look into your cell now and then to check the GPS navigation. For an instance; if you need to take a right turn as per the GPS app, the shoes will give you a mild vibration in your right leg.\n\n7. Fin Ring\n\nOver to you\n\nFin ring offers an innovative gesture to the users to control the smart devices. Users need to connect the fin ring with Bluetooth. It helps you in controlling any smart device by moving the thumb over the other fingers. You can also switch from one smart device to another by tapping on the finger while wearing a fin ring on the thumb.\n\nThese are only a few currently trending technologies. More innovative and outstanding wearable technologies are on the way. Adopt the latest wearable devices and gadgets, as they are driving positive change in your life by making the required information available to you in real time.\n\nStay tuned with Intuz to have each update about the upcoming wearable technologies."
