        "text": "Time is of the essence\n\nWhen a public safety crisis occurs, time is of the essence. The faster and more effectively first responders can assess and get to an incident, the more likely they will be able to save lives and minimize damage. Incomplete information can cause delays and jeopardize the safety of both citizens and first responders.\n\nFor fire, ambulance and police forces, delay can quite literally be the difference between life and death. Fortunately, recent developments in smart technology can substantially reduce the time it takes for first responders and other emergency personnel to respond to and resolve public safety incidents. See how communities are already using smart technology to keep their citizens safe.\n\nSo, what exactly does smart technology mean in the context of law enforcement and public safety? At its simplest, smart technology provides first responders with information they otherwise would not have - information that lets them know what they’re facing, how to most effectively approach a situation and which responses will lead to the best outcomes. Beyond responding to crimes happening in real time, the introduction of analytics and insights opens the possibilities to predict and even prevent crimes.\n\nTechnology has long been used in public safety. We’re all familiar with traffic and security cameras, GPS trackers, and various other sensors on our streets and in our public spaces. Smart technology brings data from all of these sources together, adds new data sources such as cloud-based law enforcement databases and social media, and leverages artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics and internet of things (IoT) technology to make the relevant information available to first responders in real time.\n\nFor example, a smart technology system might integrate real-time data from multiple systems such as 911 computer-aided dispatch, license plate readers and gunshot sensors. The data can be immediately presented visually in 3-D to help law enforcement respond to an incident quickly and effectively.\n\nUnfortunately, those who seek to do harm are now using new and more sophisticated technology, including social media, to accelerate their agendas. Our first responders need equivalent or better technology to thwart bad actors and be better prepared to intervene more quickly and successfully when the bad actors attack.\n\nFor example, first responders often arrive at the scene of a crime in progress with very limited information. They may know an approximate location but have no details such as the building, floor, room, number of actors, or number and condition of victims. This lack of clarity could lead to an inappropriate, ineffective or out-of-scale response to the situation.\n\nHowever, with smart technology, dispatchers can track calls, determine the quickest route to an incident, control traffic signals to prevent interruption along the route, and provide additional critical data analysis that gives first responders detailed information before they arrive. This information can help first responders make the right decisions and take the right actions from the outset, improving the chances of a better outcome for all.\n\nHere are a few examples of how smart technology can make a difference:\n\nVideo monitoring and analysis can help identify and weed out known mischief makers at major public events.\n\nGeofencing can quickly cordon off an area to help law enforcement capture perpetrators as well as warn people away from dangerous situations.\n\nShot detectors can automatically move cameras in the direction of the sound of a gunshot to aid first responders in getting to an incident more quickly and in the right location.\n\nAnalyses of historical crime data from record management systems, social media and other sources can also help law enforcement agencies predict and prevent crimes.\n\nEnabling proactive law enforcement\n\nSmart technology helps public agencies of all kinds be proactive rather than reactive. From object and intrusion detection to facial recognition to geofencing, smart technology offers valuable tools that can help keep people safe and improve their quality of life in the most efficient manner, without adding personnel while balancing the needs of personal privacy against public safety concerns.\n\nFor example, consider the case of a package on a train platform. Did someone leave it there with the intent to do harm, or did a very busy person drop the package without noticing or put it down to rest for a moment and then forget it? Video analytics can help to identify what happened while protecting the privacy of individuals using public trains by masking faces and even body type, size and any other identifiable information. However, if public safety is concerned, authorized personnel with encrypted access can identify the person quickly and take proactive steps.\n\nIn the case of an intruder in a sensitive area, a geofence can be put in place electronically. It can immediately detect anyone who should not be in that area, and then inform law enforcement that an unauthorized person is in a controlled area — so that law enforcement can respond quickly.\n\nIn smart cities, IoT, AI, data analytics and 5G networks all work together to help improve public safety. When video analytics are added to this mix of smart technologies, the quality and quantity of insights increases even further. Understanding what’s taking place on our streets no longer involves hours and hours of manual video analysis or an extensive analytics staff. Instead, video data is like any other data, amenable to instantaneous collection and analysis and useful for creating alerts, solving crimes and improving citizens’ quality of life.\n\nToday’s smart technology is not only useful in emergency situations — it can also provide an additional layer of protection on an ongoing basis. For example, in urban areas, smart technology that includes video analytics and visualization capabilities can help manage traffic flows, ensure that vital services are functioning properly, and quickly find people or vehicles of interest. With advanced analytics, areas subject to crime at certain times of the day or year can also be identified. As a result, patrols can be adjusted to check for signs of criminal activity and help prevent crimes.\n\nAs this technology advances, partnerships between the public and private sectors involving video collection and data sharing and analysis are helping to keep people safer.\n\nGet started with smart technology in three easy steps\n\nTo reap the full benefits of smart technology, law enforcement, governments, and local communities must work together. Law enforcement personnel and other first responders are on the front lines, working to prevent dangerous situations and intervening to save lives and property when there is an incident. Institutions and municipalities play an important role in providing a better quality of life in general and a safer environment for their citizens.\n\nIn addition, the federal government has significant funding streams that can be directed or redirected so that they are available to finance smart technology for local use. When all three entities work together, funds can be best directed to where they are most needed.\n\nWhether your organization is a law enforcement agency, a city government, or a federal agency, bringing the benefits of smart technology to your constituents involves three high-level steps:\n\nStart by learning about the capabilities that smart technology offers. Collaborating with other law enforcement departments and associations is an excellent way to better understand this technology and the difference it can make to your agency and community.\n\nEvaluate any specific issues your agency is experiencing so you can identify which smart technologies would be most appropriate for you. Each agency and municipality will have issues in common with others as well as some unique challenges. It’s important to choose the best technology for your agency’s needs.\n\nEducate your agency about the smart technologies that can make your community safer while stretching your budget dollars through increased efficiency.\n\nWhen you’re ready to begin your smart technology journey, you can either start small and focus on your priority areas or adopt a complete smart technology system. Smart technology is scalable so that it can grow with you as your community grows, and flexible enough to meet any need or budget. And, if you have more needs than your finances can cover, there are federal funding sources available to help you achieve your smart technology goals.\n\nAt Hitachi, we are committed to collaborative relationships with customers that drive innovation while powering good to make a better world. Together, we develop technology solutions that benefit all stakeholders and improve the lives of citizens in communities around the world through smart city development."
