        "text": "Homes can be adapted to make daily life easier for people living with dementia and their carers. This includes using different types of equipment and improving the design and layout of the home.\n\nUsing equipment and making adaptations at home\n\nSave this information\n\nAs a person’s dementia progresses, they may find everyday tasks harder without the support of other people. For example:\n\nthey might forget where an item is usually kept\n\nthey might try to use objects or tools in the wrong way\n\nthey may forget how to complete certain activities, like making a cup of tea or getting dressed.\n\nThis can make living in their own home more challenging.\n\nHowever, changes can be made to a person’s home to make it easier, safer and more comfortable. This can help them go about their daily routine with less assistance for as long as possible.\n\nHow can equipment help people with dementia?\n\nEquipment doesn’t have to be expensive or complicated to be helpful. Even small, everyday items have been found to make a positive difference to people with dementia living in their own homes.\n\nFor example, products designed to help older people live well can also be very useful for people with dementia. These include mobility aids and equipment for maintaining continence. There are also many products designed specifically to address the needs of people with dementia, such as memory aids.\n\nIt is usually a good idea for the person to start using any new equipment as early as possible, so that they can get used to it being part of their daily routine.\n\nAssistive technology\n\nElectronic items that are designed to help people with cognitive or memory problems are classed as ‘assistive technology’. These can help people with dementia remain active, independent and safe.\n\nRead more\n\nHow can the layout of the home be improved for people with dementia?\n\nAs well as using equipment, making changes to the layout of areas around the home can be helpful for people with dementia. This includes:\n\nrearranging furniture and fittings in a way that makes them easy to access and use\n\ninstalling wide doors for wheelchairs or specially designed shower and toilet facilities\n\nkeeping surfaces and floors clear and uncluttered to reduce confusion and help prevent trips and falls\n\nputting signs on doors and cupboards to make it easier for the person to find their way around the home\n\nhaving good lighting can help keep the person safe (for example, lights that come on automatically may help prevent falls if the person gets out of bed and walks about at night)\n\ndraughtproofing and using more efficient heating.\n\nHow can the design of a home be improved for people with dementia?\n\nProblematic patterns and surfaces\n\nCertain patterns and surfaces cause problems for some people with dementia, who find it hard to understand what they are seeing. For example:\n\npatterned carpets can be mistaken for uneven ground\n\ndark mats can be confused for holes in the floor\n\nshiny surfaces and mirrors can also be confusing as someone may not realise that what they are seeing is a reflection\n\nRemoving these types of surfaces and patterns will help to make the home safer and easier to get around for someone with dementia.\n\nHelpful contrasting colours\n\nMarking out the edges of steps can be helpful for people with dementia. In the same way, using contrasting colours makes items around the house easier to locate, identify and use. This could include:\n\ntoilet seats in a colour that contrasts with the toilet bowl and the floor\n\nlight switches in a different colour to the wall\n\nhandrails, taps and towels that contrast with the rest of the bathroom\n\nhandles on doors, cupboards and drawers in a colour which stands out\n\ncutlery, crockery and tablecloths in a different colour to the table and the food.\n\nInformation Tag: Information.\n\nMaking your home dementia friendly\n\nRead a booklet about practical ways to make your home more dementia friendly.\n\nRead more\n\nHow can outside space be improved for people with dementia?\n\nEnjoying fresh air and spending time outside can improve the wellbeing of people with dementia. Gardens can help a person to do this in a safe and familiar environment.\n\nIn this way, gardens can help to contribute to a better quality of life for some people with dementia. However, the design and layout of gardens can affect how suitable they are for people with dementia.\n\nWays of improving them include:\n\nmaking the garden easier to get around by using a path which is free of obstacles and uneven surfaces\n\ninstalling ramps and handrails to help the person move around the garden\n\nputting in a raised flower or vegetable bed if a person has difficulty reaching down to work in the garden\n\nhaving sturdy garden chairs for the person to sit and look around the garden\n\nAll garden furniture, such as chairs and tables, will be easier to see and identify if it’s a different colour to its surroundings.\n\nTo help make the seating area more relaxing for people with dementia, garden ornaments and colourful plants could be set up and planted nearby. Wind chimes and small water features can also have a calming effect for a person with dementia.\n\nWhat to consider when adapting the home for people with dementia\n\nNot everything included in this page will be of use to everyone, but it can help to know what is available.\n\nDecisions about equipment and layout should be made with the consent of the person with dementia where possible, especially if the changes might restrict their freedom.\n\nAny changes must be based on the person’s individual circumstances and needs and must be made with their best interests in mind.\n\nEveryone with dementia experiences the condition differently, and what may be useful for one person may not be appropriate for another.\n\nAs dementia progresses, the support that the person needs will change. They may need to be reminded how certain equipment works or become unable to use it.\n\nEquipment will not be the answer to every problem, and there may be times when changing the way that something is done works better for the person with dementia. For example, someone who has difficulties sitting in the bath may find it easier to have a shower in a standing position with appropriate support.\n\nA piece of equipment may help the person to be safer and more independent, but they may still need assistance.\n\nIf adaptations are made to the home, these should also be regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain helpful.\n\nThink about who will be paying for adaptations and improvements – and what might be available for free. The extent of the work will usually determine who will cover the cost.\n\nThink this page could be useful to someone? Share it:\n\nPrevious Section\n\nPrevious\n\nYou are on the first page"
