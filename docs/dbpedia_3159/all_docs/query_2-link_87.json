        "text": "On any normal day, you might buckle your seatbelt, get cash from an ATM, or check the news on your cellphone. Chances are, these things feel unremarkable—but it wasn’t so long ago that they each would have been utterly unthinkable. Thanks to more than six and a half decades of remarkable scientific and technological innovation, 2022 looks very little like 1954. From Velcro to virtual reality, LEDs to Facebook, these are the 69 most life-changing and famous inventions of our time.\n\n💡 Want more blasts from the past (or news on future tech)? Join Pop Mech Pro!\n\nIn 1945, Raytheon’s Percy Spencer stands in front of a magnetron (the power tube of radar) and feels a candy bar start to melt in his pocket: He is intrigued. When he places popcorn kernels in front of the magnetron, the kernels explode all over the lab. Ten years later Spencer patents a “radar range” that cooks with high-frequency radio waves; that same year, the Tappan Stove Co. introduces the first home microwave model.\n\nPLUS: Scientists Are Testing a Mind-Blowing Time Theory in a Nuclear Reactor\n\nIBM releases the first computer hard disk drive, the 2,000-pound-plus, refrigerator-size IBM 305 RAMAC, which introduces magnetic disk storage. Up until then, files were either kept on spools of magnetic tape or on good old-fashioned paper, with no way to jump right to the record you wanted to pull up. With the RAMAC, a mechanical arm would retrieve data by storing data at a particular magnetic orientation. This technology goes on to be used (at a smaller size) in laptops and computer servers everywhere.\n\nIvan Sutherland—The Father of Computer Graphics—revolutionized 3D computer modeling and simulation when he created the Sketchpad program. As the earliest iteration of a computer-aided design (CAD) program, Sketchpad pioneered the use of geometric constraints (fixing the length of a line or an angle between two segments). It was also one of the first programs to use a graphical user interface, as opposed to a text-based one—if you’re reading this on a computer without knowing a single line of code, you can thank Sutherland and Sketchpad.\n\nPLUS: This Inmate Used Solitary Confinement to Learn Math. Now He's Solving the World's Hardest Equations\n\nEveryone agrees that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a brilliant invention—but no one agrees on who invented it. The physical effect that MRIs rely on—nuclear magnetic resonance—earns various scientists Nobel Prizes for physics in 1944 and 1952. Many believe that Raymond Damadian establishes the machine’s medical merit in 1973, when he first uses magnetic resonance to discern healthy tissue from cancer. Yet, in 2003, the Nobel Prize for medicine goes to Peter Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield for their “seminal discoveries.” The topic of who is the worthiest candidate remains hotly debated."
