It’s the single most accepted certification Mark in the United States. From appliances, smart devices and furniture to home construction material and fire and carbon monoxide detectors, the UL Mark is a symbol of trusted safety and performance.\n\nThe UL safety Mark means a product has been certified to meet scientific safety, quality or security standards. We also continue to check products months and years after testing to make sure they still meet the requirements. Look for UL safety Marks on product packaging, the product itself or within product details when shopping online.\n\nAlthough there are many variations of our safety certification Marks, they typically look like one of the following:\n\nThe Enhanced UL Certification Mark is used on some of the most innovative products being sold today. Look for it on hoverboards, pre-lit holiday decorations and smoke alarms meeting the latest safety requirements. The promotional badge may appear on the products, packaging and promotions in conjunction with the Enhanced UL Certification Mark.\n\nOur Listed Mark appears on furnaces and heaters, fuses, electrical panel boards, fire extinguishers and thousands of other products.\n\nThe UL Classified Mark commonly appears on products that have been evaluated for a specific hazard or for performance under specific conditions.\n\nThe ULC Mark appears on many types of products, including building materials and fire protection and suppression products.\n\nThe UL Recognized Component Mark is used on components that are part of a larger UL Certified product or system."
