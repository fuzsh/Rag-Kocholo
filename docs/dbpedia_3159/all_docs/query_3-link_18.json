        "text": "laptop computer, portable personal computer that features a screen, touch pad, and alphanumeric keyboard.\n\nLaptops usually have a clamshell design, in which the screen is located on the interior of the upper lid and the keyboard is located on the interior of the lower lid. Laptop screens are protected when users close their lids. Batteries power the machines during mobile use and are recharged via alternating current (AC) power chargers. Like desktop computers, modern laptops possess such input/output (I/O) components as keyboards, point devices (e.g., touch pads), and speakers. Data storage amount, memory capacity, and processor speed depend on the model and user configuration.\n\nLaptops have many advantages over desktop computers. Laptops’ portability and battery make productivity possible nearly anywhere, especially as almost all laptops possess Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and the ability to connect to cellular networks. Laptops are also far more power efficient than desktop computers. However, laptops still cannot reach the performance levels of desktops, making the latter more desirable for resource-intensive activities—for example, playing the most advanced computer games. Additionally, desktop computers allow users to swap out the processor, RAM, and hard drive when they need replacing. The way that laptops are designed means that, unlike desktop computers, they are rarely upgradeable.\n\nAmerican computer scientist Alan Kay is credited with first prototyping a laptop. In 1968 Kay designed a portable computer he called the Dynabook, which he envisioned as a child-friendly device weighing no more than two pounds. Ten prototypes of the Dynabook, renamed the Xerox Notetaker, were created at Xerox PARC in Palo Alto, California, in 1978, but the product never went into production. Even so, Kay’s vision greatly influenced later designs.\n\nThe first true laptop to make it to market, the Osborne 1, hit shelves in April 1981. Created by Adam Osborne, the computer featured a 12.7-centimetre (5-inch) screen and weighed 11.1 kilograms (24.5 pounds). However, the machine still required an AC outlet for power. Epson’s HX-20 and Grid Systems Corporation’s Grid Compass both debuted in the early 1980s. The Grid Compass, designed by British industrial designer Bill Moggridge, was so expensive that only the U.S. military and NASA could afford it. Nevertheless, the computer revolutionized the industry with its design: the Compass was a “computer in a briefcase,” with its keyboard and display built into its flip-up lid. This clamshell-style configuration soon became the industry standard among laptops.\n\nOther major technology companies entered the market in the 1980s, each releasing a new experiment. In 1983 Radio Shack brought the Japanese TRS-80 Model 100 to the United States; it was one of the first computers with a liquid crystal display (LCD). Commodore followed in 1984 with its 9.1-kilogram (20-pound) Commodore SX-64, the first portable computer to offer colour. The Gavilan SC debuted that year as well, notable for being the first computer marketed as a “laptop.” In 1986 IBM released the PC Convertible, the first laptop to weigh less than 6.8 kilograms (15 pounds). Other historic releases included 1988’s Compaq SLT/286, the first battery-powered laptop with VGA graphics and an internal hard drive, and 1989’s NEC Ultra-Lite, the first notebook-style (lightweight) laptop.\n\nApple got into the game relatively late, releasing its Mac Portable in 1989. This computer sold poorly, but the company’s second effort, in 1991, the PowerBook, was more than a financial success—it was another laptop-design milestone. Its original features included a trackball for navigation and palm rests. Within a few years, additional models of the PowerBook introduced the touch pad, the 256-colour display, and the built-in Ethernet networking port.\n\nNew technological advances in the 1990s continued to increase the laptop’s utility and popularity. Enhancements included lighter, more efficient batteries; the Intel 386 processor, specially built to power laptops; active matrix display technology, which replaced inferior cathode-ray tube and liquid crystal displays; thinner, higher-capacity hard disk drives; and internal modems and ports. Sales consequently skyrocketed. In 1995 global laptop sales reached 10 million for the first time. In 2000 sales reached 28.5 million. By the early 2000s, laptop sales were earning more revenue than desktops.\n\nIn the 21st century, laptop manufacturers introduced not only new laptop models but also new laptop types. One experimental new form was the netbook, a small and inexpensive notebook intended to run only Web applications. The first netbooks were created for developing nations as part of the One Laptop Per Child program. However, the first netbook widely marketed to the general public was the 2007 Asus Eee PC 700. The netbook may have had a future, but the subsequent rise of smartphones and tablets rendered it obsolete by the mid-2010s. Netbooks evolved into such computers as the Chromebook, first introduced in 2011, which runs on the Google ChromeOS operating system.\n\nA longer-lasting form of the laptop is the “ultra notebook” or “ultrabook”—an ultra-thin, lightweight laptop that still compares favorably with older laptops in terms of battery life, performance, and features. The first example was Apple’s MacBook Air, billed at its release in 2008 as “the world’s thinnest laptop,” with a thickness of just 1.9 centimetres (0.75 inch). Part of the reason for the MacBook Air’s slimness was that it possessed a compact solid-state disk (SSD) instead of the traditional hard-disk drive (HDD). In addition to reducing the laptop’s size, the SSD had other benefits: it was faster than the HDD, more power-efficient, and since it lacked any moving parts, it was much more durable. Almost all laptops eventually made the switch to an SSD.\n\nLaptops remain the most popular computers on the market. Laptops have outsold both desktop computers and tablets since 2018."
