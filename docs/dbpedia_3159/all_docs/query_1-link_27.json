        "meta_description": "Despite a growing ecosystem of devices, software, and services for the home, there hasn’t been explosive growth in the smart-home market. Aside from some technophiles, consumers still struggle to see how smart-home products or services will be relevant to them in their daily lives, let alone understand all the technology upgrade cycles and platform and integration options. New Accenture research finds that to help smart-home technology get more mainstream, companies need to rethink their product design and marketing. This means understanding smart-home customers’ needs and behaviors, as well as employing a few best practices to make them comfortable with bringing tech into the home.",
