        "text": "An Introduction to IT\n\nIn a modern context, the term ‘IT’ is commonly used to describe computers and networks within a business environment. It refers to their applications in: generating, manipulating, storing, regaining, transmitting, handling, exchanging, studying and securing all data or information in an electronic format. IT is also used as an umbrella term to cover: television, telecommunication equipment, software, e-commerce and the internet.\n\nWhen thinking about IT you need to consider IT supportwithin both your personal and private life. Especially when it comes to the increasingly sophisticated level of cyber crime we see every day. This is so that when you are surfing the web on your computer or receiving an email, your personal and business data is kept safe. IT support also covers technical problems you may come across, ensuing you are using the most up to date software and finding the best tools possible to effectively complete tasks.\n\nHumanity has been manipulating, storing, and communicating information since the early Sumerians pioneered the written word in ancient Mesopotamia, circa 3000 BC. The term IT did not appear until the mid-20th century however when an influx of early office technology appeared. The term was first published in the 1958 Harvard Business Review when authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas C. Whisler said “the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it Information Technology.”\n\nTimeline of important IT milestones\n\nAlthough this section could go as far back as 2400 BC with the production of the first known calculator (abacus) in Babylonia, it will focus on the information technology boom in recent centuries.\n\nThe first mechanical computer device was conceptualised and invented by English mechanical engineer and polymath Charles Babbage in the early 19th century. Called the ‘Difference Engine,’ it was originally created to aid in navigational calculations. Often referred to as the ‘Father of the Computer’, Babbage came up with the more general ‘Analytical Engine’ in 1833 which could be used in fields other than navigation. Funding constraints meant that Babbage died without seeing his machine completed, however his son Henry completed a much simpler version of the machine in 1888, which was successfully demonstrated to the public in 1906.\n\nEarly computers were not developed until the mid 1900s, when a more compact analogue electromechanical computer, that used trigonometry, was installed on a submarine to solve a problem with firing torpedoes at moving targets.\n\nThe Z2, the first electromechanical digital computer, invented by Engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, used electric switches to drive, and relays to perform calculations. Devices like the Z2 had very low operating speeds and were eventually succeeded by faster all electric machines, such as the first fully automatic 1941 Z3, also created by Zuse.\n\nColossus, a set of computers created between 1943 – 1945, are widely recognised as the world’s first programmable electronic digital computers. Popularised by its use during World War II Colossus were used in intercepting and deciphering encrypted German communications from the Enigma machine. English computer scientist, mathematician, and theoretical biologist Alan Turing conceptualised modern computers in his 1936 seminal paper ‘On Computable Numbers’, whereby programmable instructions are stored in the memory of a machine.\n\nAnother early programmable computer was the Manchester Mark 1 developed by the Victoria University of Manchester. Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn, and Geoff Tootill began working on the machine in August of 1948, but the first operational version of the computer was not available for use until 1949. The Manchester Mark 1 caused controversy when British media outlets referred to it as an electronic brain, which provoked a long-running debate with the department of Neurosurgery at Manchester University. They asked whether an electronic computer could ever be truly creative.\n\nIt was not until 1951 when electrical engineering company Ferranti International plc created the Ferranti Mark 1; that the world’s first general-purpose computer was commercially available. Also called the Manchester Electronic Computer, the Ferranti Mark 1 was first utilised by the Victoria University of Manchester.\n\nThe first computer used in processing commercial business applications was developed by the Lyons Tea Corporation to increase business output in 1951 – Leo I.\n\nA brief timeline of some other important events is listed below:\n\n1835 – Morse Code invented by Samuel Morse\n\n1838 – Electric Telegraph invented by Charles Wheatstone and Samuel Morse\n\n1843 – Typewriter invented by Charles Thurber\n\n1877 – Microphone invented by Emile Berliner\n\n1888 – Hertz produces radio waves\n\n1893 – Wireless communication invented by Nikola Tesla\n\n1895 – Radio signals invented by Guglielmo Marconi\n\n1898 – Remote control invented by Nikola Tesla\n\n1907 – Radio amplifier invented by Lee DeForest\n\n1919 – James Smathers develops the first electric typewriter\n\n1923 – Electronic Television invented by Philo Farnsworth\n\n1933 – FM radio is patented by inventor Edwin H.
