The resources address many different aspects of:\n\n'Electronic business', e-business or eBusiness. This is a useful general term for the conduct of business with the assistance of telecommunications and telecommunications-based tools. It encompasses a vast array of categories.\n\nElectronic commerce, EC, e-commerce or eCommerce. This refers to support services for trading in goods and services. It encompasses inter-organisational e-mail; directories; trading support systems for commodities, products, customised products and custom-built goods and services; ordering and logistic support systems; settlement support systems; and management information and statistical reporting systems.\n\nThe resources in this segment of the site can be accessed in the following ways, most useful first:\n\nStarter Resources, here\n\nThe Topic-Based Index of my papers on eBusiness themes, up-to-date at 31 December 2023, below\n\nThe What's New Page (because the indexes are never fully up-to-date), here\n\nThe Chronological Index of my papers on eBusiness themes, here\n\nThe Search Facility, in the button at the top-right-hand side of the page\n\nA chronological index of Presentations is here\n\nAnnotated Bibliography of eBusiness Papers\n\nWhat's Busy?

Underlying Theories\n\nHere is a statement of the definitions I use for key EC terms.\n\nHere is my exposition of strategic information systems theory (1992-94).\n\nThis is supplemented by an assessment of strategic theory in low-competitive contexts (1996).\n\nWith Gillian Dempsey, I summarised the economics of innovation in the information industries (2004).\n\nI introduced the concept of Supra-Organisational Systems (1988), to provide a collective term for a set of system topographies.\n\nMost classes of supra-organisational system are discussed in the IS literature. One that is not, however, is one that I introduced in Extra-Organisational Systems: A Challenge to the Software Engineering Paradigm (1992).\n\n2. Strategic and Policy Aspects\n\n2.1 National Strategy\n\nHere are some very early proposals for information infrastructure as a basis for the information economy and information society:\n\nVision for a Networked Nation: The Public Interest in Network Services (with Tom Worthington, 1994)\n\nInformation Infrastructure for The Networked Nation (1994)\n\nThe Strategic Significance of National Information Infrastructure (1995)\n\nSubmission Regarding NOIE's Preliminary Statement: 'Towards an Australian Strategy for the Information Economy' (1998)\n\nKey Features of Effective I.T.

The primary exposition is in 'Risks Inherent in the Digital Surveillance Economy: A Research Agenda' (2019).\n\nMy papers on the topic are indexed on another page.\n\n2.4 Intellectual Property (Copyright, Patents)\n\nA major area of concern during the digital era is the stultifying effect of outdated intellectual property laws and practices, and of dinosaur publishing companies desperately trying to sustain outmoded practices and business models.\n\nMy major papers in this area are:\n\nFreedom of Information?

A 'new' phase then emerged, dressed in the marketing term 'cloud computing'. To underline its close similarity to predecessors, I prefer to call it 'cloudsourcing'. The key difference is that the cheapest form of processor is once again sufficiently powerful to run more than one application at a time – and hence the term 'server' has reverted to its original use to refer to software rather than hardware – and the applications that organisations depend can now (in principle at least) be run on any compatible machine, anywhere – for which the marketing buzz-phrase 'server virtualisation' has been created. There are potential benefits; and a lot of risks to be managed.\n\n'Cloud Computing: Managing for Benefits and Managing the Risks' Executive Report (8,000 words) Cutter Consortium (2010)\n\nUser Requirements for Cloud Computing Architecture (2010)\n\nMobilising for a (Mostly) Mobile Future, Executive Report (11,000 words) Cutter Consortium (2010)\n\nComputing Clouds on the Horizon?

The term 'social media' gradually emerged to encompass all of the new field. And the business imperative of 'monetising' market-share progressively saw the designs become more exploitative.\n\nMy early contributions, 2004-10, considered social media mainly from the consumer and privacy perspectives.
