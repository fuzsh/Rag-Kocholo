        "text": "About\n\nSince 2004, the President of the United States and Congress have declared the month of October to be Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a dedicated month for the public and private sectors to work together to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity.\n\nOver the years it has grown into a collaborative effort between government and industry to enhance cybersecurity awareness, encourage actions by the public to reduce online risk and generate discussion on cyber threats on a national and global scale. October 2024 marks the 21st Cybersecurity Awareness Month.\n\nSecure Our World\n\nStarting in 2023 with the launch of CISA’s cybersecurity awareness program, Secure Our World will also be the enduring theme for all future Cybersecurity Awareness Months. This theme recognizes the importance of taking daily action to reduce risks when online and connected to devices. Organizations can use the Secure Our World theme when planning for the 2024 and future Cybersecurity Awareness Month campaigns.\n\nBelow are the simple actions we should all take not only during October, but every day throughout the year to stay safe online.\n\nLet’s work together to build a safer digital world. We can increase our online safety through four simple actions, and whether at home, work or school, these tips make us more secure when connected. Take time to discuss them with family, friends, employees and your community so we can all become safer online!\n\nSpeaker Request Deadline\n\nIf you would like to request a CISA speaker for your Cybersecurity Awareness Month event, please fill out the CISA Speaker Request Form and then email it as an attachment to CISA.Speakers@cisa.dhs.govno later than August 30, 2024.\n\nBecome a Cybersecurity Awareness Month Partner!\n\nPartnering with CISA for Cybersecurity Awareness Month is a great way for us to work together and share the importance of reducing risks when we are online or using devices connected to the internet. As a partner, your organization will receive free resources to help it create its own campaign and promote participation in Cybersecurity Awareness Month by employees, customers, the public, friends and family.
