        "text": "HubSpot’s marketing automation software is designed to help you generate leads and automate marketing to drive growth. It offers the tools you need to increase revenue through high-quality leads, save time and resources, and measure and optimize campaigns — all on one powerful, easy-to-use platform. Marketing Hub is available in three editions — Starter, Professional, and Enterprise — with select functionality in our free tools.\n\nPricing\n\nFor new customers after March 5, 2024, Marketing Hub is priced per seat at the Starter edition, and starts at a base price for the Professional and Enterprise editions. For existing customers, the pricing model for your subscription(s) won’t be affected at this time, and you’ll stay on your current pricing model unless and until we contact you. Pricing also varies based on the number and type of contacts in your database.\n\nAs a reminder, customers after Oct. 21, 2020 will automatically have access to Marketing Hub - Marketing Contacts pricing as part of their subscription. Pre-existing customers may still have access to legacy contacts pricing until they migrate to the new Marketing Hub - Marketing Contacts pricing.\n\nTypes of Contacts:\n\nMarketing Contacts: Marketing contacts can be sent marketing emails and be targeted with ads manually or with automation if it’s included in your subscription.\n\nNon-Marketing Contacts: Non-marketing contacts cannot be sent marketing emails and cannot be targeted with ads.\n\nYou can designate contacts as marketing contacts at any time, and your changes will take effect immediately. You can also designate contacts as non-marketing contacts at any time. However, those changes will take effect only at the start of the following month or your contract renewal date — whichever comes first — and your contact tier pricing cannot be downgraded until your contract renewal date. If you exceed your marketing contacts tier at any time, you will be billed immediately. The fee for marketing contacts is a blended rate based on the number of contacts purchased and the applicable rates.\n\nHelpful Definitions\n\nA \"content type\" is a website, blog, landing page, email, or knowledge base.\n\nAn \"object\" is a single contact, company, deal, ticket, product, notes, one-to-one email, live chat, meeting, or task.\n\nA \"session\" means interaction with your website by a single visitor in a single session.\n\nAn \"engagement\" is a note, meeting, task, or email (one-off sales and marketing emails).\n\nSeat Types\n\nA “seat” is the manner and level of access your users have to the subscription services. We offer different types of seats based on which subscription services you purchase.\n\nCore Seats: A “Core Seat” for our paid subscription service provides a user with access to the features and tools in the subscription services they purchase, including Marketing Hub, Content Hub, Operations Hub, Sales Hub, and Service Hub subscriptions. Core Seats are available to Starter, Professional, and Enterprise customers; some Core Seats are included with the purchase of other Professional and Enterprise subscription services, as indicated in the pricing tables. Customers with Starter, Professional or Enterprise subscription services may purchase additional Core Seats at any time.\n\nCore Seats (Starter): Core Seats (Starter) can be used to access any of your purchased Starter subscription services, including Marketing Hub Starter, Content Hub Starter, Operations Hub Starter, Sales Hub Starter, and Services Hub Starter subscriptions, as further described in this Product and Services Catalog. Customers with Starter subscription services may purchase additional Core Seats (Starter) at any time.\n\nCore Seats (Professional): Core Seats (Professional) can be used to access your purchased subscription services in Marketing Hub Professional, Content Hub Professional, and Operations Hub Professional subscriptions. Customers with Sales Hub Professional and Service Hub Professional subscriptions may access some functionality of those products with a Core Seat (Professional); however, full Sales Hub Professional and Service Hub Professional functionality is only accessible with a Sales Professional Seat or Service Professional Seat, respectively. Customers with Professional subscription services may purchase additional Core Seats (Professional) at any time.\n\nCore Seats (Enterprise): Core Seats (Enterprise) can be used to access your purchased Marketing Hub Enterprise, Content Hub Enterprise, and Operations Hub Enterprise subscriptions. Customers with Sales Hub Enterprise and Service Hub Enterprise subscriptions may access some functionality of those products with a Core Seat (Enterprise); however, full Sales Hub Enterprise and Service Hub Enterprise functionality is only accessible with a Sales Enterprise Seat or Service Enterprise Seat, respectively. Customers with Enterprise subscription services may purchase additional Core Seats (Enterprise) at any time.\n\nSales Seats: A “Sales Seat” provides a user with access to Sales Hub and access to use features for Sales Hub Professional and Sales Hub Enterprise. Sales Seat functionality also includes Core Seat access to your purchased Marketing Hub, Content Hub, and Operations Hub subscription(s), including any other features purchased and included in your subscription services. Customers with Professional and Enterprise subscription services may purchase additional Sales Seats at any time. Starter customers can access Sales Hub with Core Seat (Starter), as detailed in the Core Seat (Starter) description above.\n\nService Seats: A “Service Seat” provides a user with access to Service Hub and access to use advanced features for Professional and Enterprise subscription editions. Service Seat functionality also includes Core Seat access to your purchased Marketing Hub, Content Hub, and Operations Hub subscription(s), including any other features purchased and included in your subscription services. Customers with Professional and Enterprise subscription services may purchase additional Service Seats at any time. Starter customers can access Service Hub with Core Seat (Starter), as detailed in the Core Seat (Starter) description above.\n\nView-Only Seats: A “View-Only Seat” allows a user to view the subscription services without making any changes to their account. Users with View-Only Seats may view records, dashboards, and other customer data; this includes viewing and filtering reports, but not saving reports. Users with View-Only Seats do not have the ability to create, publish, edit, or delete information in their account. Therefore, View-Only Seats cannot be used by your admin or super admin users. View-Only Seats are exclusively available to Starter, Professional, and Enterprise customers at no additional cost and are unlimited.\n\nMixed-Tier Customers: If you have a mix of Starter, Professional, and/or Enterprise subscription services, all Core Seats will have the highest level of access and features across your purchased subscription services and will be priced based on the highest level of your subscription services. For example, if a customer has Marking Hub Enterprise and Content Hub Professional, all Core Seats will have access to Enterprise-level features for Marketing Hub, Professional-level features for Content Hub, and the highest level of access to all other purchased subscription services features; all Core Seats will be priced at the Enterprise price point.\n\nPartner Seats: If you work with a HubSpot Solutions Partner, you may add “Partner Seats” at no additional cost to you. You agree to grant or confirm a Partner Seat exclusively for HubSpot Solutions Partners you’re actively working with and who need this access to perform services in your subscription services; HubSpot will confirm, deny, or remove Partner Seats in our sole, reasonable discretion. You will notify us promptly of any unauthorized use of Partner Seats by following the instructions at https://help.hubspot.com. You can learn more about our Solutions Partners in the HubSpot Solutions Directory at https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/solutions. Partner Seats are available to both HubSpot Solutions Providers and HubSpot Solution Partners.\n\nFor information on how to manage users in seats or decrease the number of any seat type added to your HubSpot account, please review the “HubSpot Seats” section of the Product Specific Terms, as well as the HubSpot user permissions knowledge base article.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIf I subscribe to Marketing Hub and use HubSpot's free tools, what's my technical contact limit in the HubSpot contacts database?\n\nWe will honor the higher limit and the tools run off of the same underlying database. That means if you subscribe to Marketing Hub and HubSpot's free tools, you could have up to 15 million objects, and contacts count as an ‘object’ in the HubSpot contacts database. If you purchase CRM Contact Record Limit Increase, you can increase your contacts database up to a maximum of 50 million contact object records. Remember that if you use HubSpot's free tools with Marketing Hub, the contacts you add to your contacts database end up in both places and could affect your contact tier pricing.\n\nDo I have to pay for contacts?\n\nYes, if you subscribe to Marketing Hub. While there’s no charge for contacts you add to the free contacts database, if you subscribe to Marketing Hub - Marketing Contacts, you will be charged for marketing contacts as part of your fee for that product, even if they are added to the free contacts database. You will not be charged for non-marketing contacts. If you subscribe to legacy Marketing Hub, please visit this page for details.\n\nWhere can I find more information about what these API limits mean?\n\nYou can find more information about our APIs and the limits that apply to them through our API Documentation, including our API Usage Guidelines.\n\nAre there any separate email sending fees?\n\nNo. Your email send limit is based on the number of contacts you purchase. For Marketing Hub - Marketing Contacts Starter, your email send limit is 5 times per contact per calendar month; for Marketing Hub - Marketing Contacts Professional, your email send limit is 10 times your contact tier per calendar month; and for Marketing Hub - Marketing Contacts Enterprise, your email send limit is 20 times your contact tier per calendar month. Email send limits for legacy Marketing Hub customers are described on this page. If you need to send even more than that, you can purchase the Dedicated IP Add-On for unlimited email sends.\n\nIf I purchase two products that include the same features, does that mean the limits are additive? For example, if I subscribe to Sales Hub Professional and Service Hub Professional, which each include up to 3,000 minutes of calling per account per month, do I get up to 6,000 minutes of calling per account per month?\n\nNo. Limits are not additive across Hubs. So, in cases where a HubSpot account has more than one paid Hub with shared features, the upper limits listed in the tables above still apply. This means in the example of the calling feature in Sales Hub Professional and Service Hub Professional, the limit would be an aggregate of 3,000 minutes of calling per account per month. (Exceptions to this, which are additive, are: i) primary subdomains provided per content type, as we describe in the ‘Technical Limits’ above, and ii) audiences and ad spend if purchasing units of the Ads Add-On.)\n\nIf I subscribe to Marketing and/or Service Hub and use HubSpot's WhatsApp integration, how am I billed for additional conversations after I reach the 1,000 free conversations limit?\n\nWhatsApp defines four types of conversations (collectively “WhatsApp Conversations”). There are three business-initiated conversation categories (all of which require customer opt-in) and one user-initiated category:\n\nUtility conversations (business-initiated): Utility conversations facilitate a specific, agreed-upon request or transaction, or update a customer about an ongoing transaction. These may include transaction confirmations, transaction updates, and/or post-purchase notifications.\n\nAuthentication conversations (business-initiated): Authentication conversations enable you to authenticate users with one-time passcodes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges).\n\nMarketing conversations (business-initiated): Marketing conversations include promotions or offers, informational updates, or invitations for customers to respond or take action.\n\nService conversations (user-initiated): Service conversations help you resolve customer inquiries.\n\nEach of these types of WhatsApp Conversations count toward your consumption. Once you reach your consumption limit, Marketing and Service Hub Professional and Enterprise customers can purchase an add-on; Starter customers may elect to upgrade to a higher edition.\n\nI’m subscribed to Marketing and/or Service Hub and want to use the SMS functionality. How are “message segments” counted in the add-ons and limit increases for SMS?\n\nAccording to Twilio, which provides the underlying functionality for HubSpot’s SMS tool, when you send an SMS message containing more than 160 characters, the message is split into smaller messages for transmission. Large messages are split into 153-character \"segments\" and sent individually, then re-assembled by the recipient’s device. The effective character limit per segment is 153 rather than 160, because a data header must be included with each segment to ensure correct re-assembly.\n\nFor example, a 161-character message will be sent as two messages: one with 153 characters and a second with eight characters.\n\nIf you include non-GSM-7 characters, such as emojis, those messages will be sent using the UCS-2 encoding. Messages containing one or more UCS-2 characters can only contain up to 70 characters in a single, non-segmented message. UCS-2 messages of more than 70 characters will be split into 67-character segments.\n\nYou can view the number of message segments you have consumed in your SMS settings at any time."
