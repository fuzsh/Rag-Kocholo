        "text": "Smart locker systems are more about the software than the hardware. Although hardware plays a big role, smart locker technology is incomplete without data and insights on usage and security. Our intelligent locker services are an excellent option for workers who need to give staff a secure place to store personal items, need to reduce device loss and would like to utilise click and collect. All of this is supported with real-time analytics and reports so you can make data-led decisions.\n\nBut what is a smart locker exactly, and how do they work? Keep reading for answers to these questions and more!\n\nSmart lockers are storage containers that use Internet of Things (IoT) technology to connect to the internet and provide people with a convenient way to store their belongings or to protect assets in factory and warehouse environments. The ultimate purpose of smart lockers is the usage of smart locker software. These smart locker systems are especially popular in offices, warehouses, retail chains, accounting firms, solicitor’s offices, and public service headquarters. Two main advantages include keeping items safe and secure, but more so, for the administrators gathering insightful data on usage and security via the provided software by these smart locker solutions.\n\nHere are some hardware components of smart locker systems:\n\n• Storage compartment: This must be sturdy enough to stand up not only to regular use but to abuse from package thieves and vandals. It must also be easily accessible to regular users and protect the valuable items stored inside.\n\n• Authentication panel: Smart locker technology can integrate with your existing keycard or fobs, becoming an extension of your business\n\n• Locking mechanism: The lock will only open after authentication. Some smart locks companies have the authentication method (usually a swiper) built in, while others are connected to the control centre and only open when they receive and verify authorization.\n\n• Connectivity modules: Connectivity modules connect your smart locker to your network. Connectivity modules can also connect with smart apps for customer convenience.\n\n• Charging ports: Charging ports let users charge mobile electronic devices like laptops, Chromebooks, tablets, and phones while they are being stored.\n\nLocker management software is the central software that manages the entire smart locker system. The software is the interface between the smart locker and your system. A smart locker sends its information to the location management software, which processes that information and acts accordingly.\n\nWith locker management software, administrators can:\n\n– Monitor locker usage in real-time to see how lockers are used throughout the day and to determine who accessed a locker at a particular time.\n\n– Set access permissions for lockers to protect sensitive or confidential information or ensure new team members have a locker from day one.\n\n– View transaction logs to spot the most and least used lockers and rearrange office space accordingly.\n\n– Use data uploaded from smart lockers to generate reports for insights and compliance.\n\nDifferent types of locker management software include:\n\n• User interface software: helps locker users engage with the smart locker.\n\n• Asset tracking software: for managing tools, inventory, and other assets.\n\n• Alert and notification system: for emergencies or notification of certain events.\n\n• Integration modules: to connect the locker to the network.\n\n• Data security and encryption: to protect sensitive information.\n\nClick and collect lockers make it easier for customers to pick up their orders. You can use Locker Analytics to get a better grasp on how your lockers are used every day. Businesses can also deploy an internal click and collect to deliver parcels within their organisation and keep track of when the recipient picks them up. Your users can collect from eLocker’s secure locker system via 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) by tapping their card and asset on the lock to both check-in and check-out.\n\nEmergency service officers like police officers, firefighters and paramedics require access to both personal and shared items. Smart lockers have been particularly useful for officers to get new radios at unsociable hours, helping them to have all the right tools to stay protected. Smart locker technology provides public service members with an added measure of security for these items via our digital access Smart Staff Lockers. Additionally, evidence lockers at policing headquarters can be better tracked with smart locker software such as our Device Management Lockers, as opposed to manual input into online documents or paper notebooks.\n\nRetailers can streamline the customer’s shopping experience with smart locker solutions. Retail lockers and Click and Collect Lockers give customers a contactless pickup option. Smart lockers do the tracking for you, taking care of inventory management becomes much easier. The easier it is for your customers to get their items from your storefront, the more digital orders they are likely to place. Plus, you are able to add custom upsells to the pick-up browser, helping you to get even further value.\n\nThere are many benefits of using smart locker systems. Here are just a few:\n\nConvenience\n\nWith smart locker systems, staff can easily store and retrieve belongings with digital access – these technology lockers are used via a smartcard or smartphones ending the frustration of lost keys and sticky locks.\n\nData Collection\n\nSmart locker management software allows administrators to access insights that would otherwise be unavailable. How often are your lockers in use? Who has accessed the lockers in recent months? eLocker software allows administrators to keep track of usage data for better security and management.\n\nEfficiency\n\nSmart locker technology helps save up to 94% of locker management time by automating management workflows and allowing you to quickly and easily allocate staff lockers. They can also self-allocate using a Hot Locker System. It also saves administrative time, money and resources that would otherwise be spent finding and redistributing lost keys or reporting missing belongings.\n\nSecurity\n\nIntelligent locker services provide an extra layer of security for belongings. If there is a situation where items are missing, you can easily log into the online system to view when the locker was last accessed and by whom. eLocker provides features like live locker logs, a full audit trail and keyless entry which traditional storage solutions just can’t provide.\n\nIn summary, intelligent locker solutions can help your business by providing a secure and convenient way for employees to store their belongings which is fully automated and fully secure. With smart locker technology, employees can quickly and easily access their belongings without having to fumble around with keys or combination codes.\n\nAdditionally, intelligent locker solutions can help your business save money on space. By tracking which employees have accessed the locker and when you can easily identify unused lockers in the system. This makes it easy to reduce the number of lockers you have in the office and optimise your space. Smart locker solutions are more about the software than the lockers themselves. Access to data on usage and time stamps are invaluable insights for theft prevention and workflow optimisation.\n\nFinally, smart locker systems provide a secure way to store valuable or confidential items. With keyless entry and tamper-proof locks, you can rest assured that your items are safe and secure. Here’s how you can upgrade to smart lockers.\n\nLockers are an office must. Employees need a place to secure their valuables and save desk space. But outdated, labour-intensive manual locker management costs businesses lots of money every year.
