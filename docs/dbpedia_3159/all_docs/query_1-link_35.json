        "text": "Got a smartphone? How about a TV that connects to the internet? Maybe even a thermostat you can control from an app? If you have any one of these items, it puts you into the category of owning an Internet of Things (IoT) device.\n\nIoT devices aren’t just used by consumers. They’re also transforming industries like logistics, retail, energy, IT infrastructure and autonomous vehicles. As a result, the number of IoT devices is expected to surpass 29.4 billion by 2030.\n\nWhat Are IoT Devices?\n\nIoT devices are hardware that connect wirelessly to the internet or a local network hub. These remotely controlled devices have the ability to transmit and receive data from other devices. Some everyday examples include a smart car, smart doorbell or even a smart refrigerator. Through IoT devices, ordinary objects become tools that provide information.\n\nMore on IoT Security11 Ways Companies Can Ensure Data Security for IoT Devices\n\nHow Do IoT Devices Work?\n\nMany IoT devices gather information via their sensors and then use software to analyze it and determine what decisions to make based on the data.\n\nThese devices usually connect to a central server to get more information. They also compare and transmit data to public websites and services to collect data, as well as connect to a messaging server that can email, text or call. IoT devices can also connect to other IoT devices via the same wireless network to instruct them on what to do.\n\nAlthough IoT devices can make tasks easier, more convenient or expand the capabilities of the task, these devices can also pose a security and safety threat if they are hacked or compromised.\n\nMore on IoT22 Internet-of-Things (IoT) Companies You Should Know\n\n23 Top IoT Devices\n\nConsumer\n\nSmart Speaker\n\nAmazon’s Echo Dot is a voice-controlled smart speaker with the help of Amazon Alexa support.
