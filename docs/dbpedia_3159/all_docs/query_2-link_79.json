        "text": "AAAI Conference and Symposium Proceedings\n\nThe AAAI Library contains a number of high-quality proceedings in the field of artificial intelligence. Included in the AAAI Member’s Library are proceedings of the AAAI National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, the Innovative Application of Artificial Intelligence Conference, the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Conference, the AI Planning Systems Conference, the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference, and the Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, among others.\n\nThe AAAI Archives include proceedings that were previously published by AAAI but are not currently considered active AAAI publications.\n\nHCOMP is aimed at promoting the scientific exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing among researchers, engineers, and practitioners across a spectrum of disciplines. The conference was created by researchers from diverse fields to serve as a key focal point and scholarly venue for the review and presentation of the highest quality work on principles, studies, and applications of human computation. The meeting seeks and embraces work on human computation and crowdsourcing in multiple fields, including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence, economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. The conference promotes the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers, but also engineers and practitioners, to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice.\n\nAIES is convened each year by program co-chairs from Computer Science, Law and Policy, the Social Sciences, Ethics and Philosophy. The goal is to encourage talented scholars in these and related fields to submit their best work related to morality, law, policy, psychology, the other social sciences, and AI.\n\nSponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence offers case studies of deployed applications with measurable benefits whose value depends on the use of AI technology. In addition, many conferences supplement these case studies with papers and invited talks that address emerging areas of AI technology or applications. IAAI was an independent conference during its early years. Recently, it has been organized as an independent program within the National Conference, with schedules coordinated to allow attendees to move freely between IAAI and National Conference sessions. Most years IAAI and the National Conference papers are published in a joint proceedings.\n\nThe EAAI Symposium series is usually held in conjunction with the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The papers from all Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence Symposia (EAAI) after 2016 are included in the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence Proceedings.\n\nHeuristic search and other forms of combinatorial search optimization are very active areas of research in artificial intelligence, robotics, planning, and other areas of computer science. The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is meant to bring researchers in such areas together to exchange ideas and crossfertilize the field. SoCS is a forum for researchers and submissions in all fields that use combinatorial search, including artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, metareasoning, operations research, navigation, and bioinformatics. The symposium also welcomes submissions presenting real-world applications of heuristic search.\n\nThe aim of the AI and Manufacturing workshops is to bring together experts and practitioners in both artificial intelligence and manufacturing, and bridge the gaps between problem and solution perspectives. The specific focus of the workshops is to build greater mutual understanding of important research challenges and technological potential in this field, break down the cultural barriers that currently exist between these two disciplines, and foster future interaction and collaboration with these two communities toward the realization of intelligent manufacturing systems.\n\nThe ISMB conference series provided a general forum for disseminating the latest developments in bioinformatics. ISMB was a multidisciplinary conference that brought together scientists from computer science, mathematics, molecular biology and statistics. Its scope included the development and application of advanced computational methods for biological problems.\n\nThe International Conference on AI Planning and Scheduling evolved into the premier forum for researchers and practitioners in planning and scheduling. During the span of these conferences, artificial intelligence planning and scheduling emerged as technologies critical to production management, space systems, the Internet, and military applications. The conference was held every two years. It has now been superceded by the ICAPS conference.\n\nThe European Conference on Planning (ECP) was an archival forum for new research in the field of automated planning and scheduling. ECP conferences were held from 1991 to 2002. It has now been superceded by the ICAPS conference.\n\nFLAIRS was founded in 1987 to promote and advance artificial intelligence research within the state of Florida, fostering interaction between researchers at colleges, universities, and industry. Since 1990, FLAIRS conferences have been broadened to include participants and papers from across North America and the world.\n\nISSN 2334-0762 (online) | ISSN 2334-0754 (print)\n\nThe HCI-Aero conferences on HCI applications in aerospace originated in Toulouse, France. They have been held biannually since 1986, and has alternated between Europe and North American since 1998. The 2002 conference, held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. The conference was held in cooperation with ACM’s Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI).\n\nComputer technology is leading to sweeping changes in how we can reason about groups in diverse cultures. These developments are inherently cross-disciplinary. They blend the behavioral and social sciences—fields such as political science, psychology, journalism, anthropology, and sociology—with technological fields such as computer science, computational linguistics, game theory, and operations research. There is a need to bring these cultures together to help forge a common understanding of principles, techniques, and application areas. That is the purpose of this conference.\n\nThe Conference on Multi-Agent Systems is a joint effort of the North American distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) community, the Japanese multi-agent and cooperative computing (MACC) community, and the European modeling autonomous agents in a multi-agent world (MAAMAW) community. This conference was initiated as a result of the growing recognition of the importance of multi-agent systems and architectures to fundamental issues in computer science and to the development of commercial network applications.\n\nSponsored by the American Association for Artificial Intelligence\n\nAdvances in data gathering, storage, and distribution technologies have far outpaced our advances in techniques for helping humans analyze, understand, and digest this information. This has led to an all-too-common data glut situation creating a strong need and a valuable opportunity for extracting knowledge from databases. Both researchers and application developers have been responding to that need. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining are areas of common interest to researchers in machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, intelligent databases, knowledge acquisition, data visualization, high performance computing, and expert systems. KDD applications have been developed for astronomy, biology, finance, insurance, marketing, medicine, and many other fields. The papers in these proceedings focus on such problems.\n\nThe MAICS conference is a relatively small regional conference that traditionally accepts papers from all areas of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, including computational linguistics, logic and automated reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, and philosophy of mind. Graduate students and junior faculty are especially encouraged to submit papers. The broad range of possible topics together with the fact that usually only about 20 to 30 submitted papers are accepted, which are mixed with presentations by well-known scientists, make the MAICS conference a very special event that has served as a first time presentation opportunity for many graduate students and has even attracted international participants."
