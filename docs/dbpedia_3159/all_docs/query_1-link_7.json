        "text": "Are we living in the future or just a very strange past?\n\nOriginally published by Joe Thompson on Hodinkee.\n\nIn November 1997, I wrote a column called “Calling Dick Tracy: Your Watch is Nearly Ready.” (It appeared in American Time, a watch trade magazine.) With the quartz-watch revolution nearly 30 years old, I noted that “a new generation of sophisticated quartz timepieces is beginning to make quartz technology interesting again.”"
