Even up to this day, African-Americans have been the subject of many struggles. In narrating these realities, documentary films have shone a light on the experiences of the African-American community.

History of black documentary

The rich history of Black American documentary films can be traced back to the early 20th century. African-Americans began to use moving pictures to document their lives as soon as the technology became available in the early 20th century.

Black photographers like Addison Scurlock, Peter P. Jones, Jennie Louise Touissant Welcome, Ernest Touissant Welcome, and Arthur Laidler Macbeth used their photographic expertise to become some of the world's first documentary filmmakers.

In 1910 political leader and Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) founder Booker T. Washington commissioned filmmaker George W. Broome and the National Negro Business League to document Tuskegee's history.

Early works

Broome‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Day at the Tuskegee‚Äù is considered as the first African-American documentary. The film opened at Carnegie Hall in New York City and was the first to reveal the documentary's political potential.

Before the advent of World War I several African-American film companies were established which produced silent films and documentaries. These films were screened in theaters, churches and schools.

Early black documentaries attempt to challenge the rising number of racist films by showcasing the impressive achievements and noteworthy activities of the African-American community.

Dawn of Truth (1915) by photographer and filmmaker Peter P. Jones combined a series of Jone‚Äôs shorts into one of the earliest historical survey documentaries.

Most of the early African-American documentaries were newsreels and short subjects that because of poor archiving have deteriorated or completely lost.

1920s and the rise of Hollywood

In the 1920 with the establishment of Hollywood and the studio system the cost of making movies and creating documentaries became more expensive and less accessible yet filmmakers like Edward Lewis, William Alexander, and Carlton Moss continued working.

Edward Lewis, a photographer and filmmaker created several documentary shorts ‚ÄúLife in Harlem‚Äù which was released in 1936.

William Alexander founded the All America Newsreel Company and created the documentary A Call To Duty (1946) which focused on Black Americans serving in the military. Many of these documentaries would document an important segment of Black History.

World War II

During World War II filmmakers created documentaries that delved on African-Americans in the military. One of these films is "The Negro Soldier" in 1944 created by Carlton Moss, which was commissioned by the American War Department.
