Plan a visit to parks that honor and preserve African American heritage, attend an event, or simply learn about the heartbeat of American history that is African American history. A special NPS film, \"Twenty & Odd,\" explores the legacy of more than 400 years of the African American experience. You can also explore the many ways that the dedicated professionals of the National Park Service work to preserve and protect these sites and aid communities outside our park boundaries.\n\nCover Caption: History Class, Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee Alabama\n\nPhoto description: B&W photo of teacher standing in front of classroom of students with writing on blackboard\n\nCredit: Library of Congress; photo taken by Frances Benjamin Johnston (1864-1952)"
