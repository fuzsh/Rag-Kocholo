        "text": "Historically, Black movies have played an invaluable role in reflecting the richness and depth of African-American heritage. Most films that have spanned the past few decades have been considered Black if their storylines are rooted in the experiences that align with the Black existence. Notable Black directors on this list who understand the nuances of the Black experience have also harnessed the skill of translating their insights into well-refined stories. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nTop Black Movies\n\nFrom era-defining classic Black movies like Do the Right Thing, crafted by the brilliance of Spike Lee in the late ‘80s, to poignant contemporary Black history movies like 12 Years a Slave by Steve McQueen, Black directors continue to show the value of telling Black stories authentically. Movies on this list like Black Panther — the highest grossing Black film of all time — have served as cultural resets that have entertained, stunned, delighted, and provoked thought. They have proven to be more more than just movies; they are theatrical heirlooms that capture the complexities, joys, struggles, triumphs and essence of Blackness. Here is a genre-spanning list of the most iconic Black films of all time.\n\n25. Do the Right Thing (1989)\n\nSpike Lee’s Do the Right Thing was set against the backdrop of Brooklyn, New York, a borough that has frequently been referenced in the entertainment world for its “hard knock life” aura. The film, which features renowned cast members, including Lee himself and veteran actor Samuel L. Jackson, delves into the racial tensions among residents as they navigate everyday life in Brooklyn. Lee carefully explores complex themes of prejudice, police brutality and societal expectations. Upon its release, the film received widespread recognition for its bold storytelling and social commentary.\n\nDo the Right Thing was released in the summer of 1989, a period in history that was defined by an acute awareness of discussions around police brutality and racial profiling. The best places to watch Do the Right Thing are Peacock, YouTube TV and Apple TV.\n\n24. 12 Years a Slave (2013)\n\nMovies about slavery and the migration of African slaves are often difficult to digest because of the long-running traumas associated with the history. Instead of following the status quo of retelling Black historical dramas, Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave provided a stark, painfully poignant re-imagination of the deep-rooted traumas that slaves endured at the hands of their owners. Notably, the tragic story of Solomon Northup's enslavement and the grueling years he endured to regain his freedom paints a vivid picture of the brutality of the antebellum South for slaves at the time. With stellar performances from Lupita Nyong'o, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and a host of other talented actors, the storytelling in this film was intentionally created to evoke emotion, and it did just that. he film would win a bevy of prestigious awards, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, which Nyong'o snagged. Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Paramount + all carry the film for streaming.\n\n23. Boyz n the Hood (1991)\n\nThe movie Boyz n the Hood is often compared to Do the Right Thing, but this spin took a West Coast approach to showcase life in one of the rough and gritty backdrops of the challenging and racially charged neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles. The film follows the stories of three main characters, Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut), and Doughboy (Ice Cube), whose stories form the focal point of the movie’s storyline. The movie explores themes of faith, gang culture, gentrification, friendship and the complexity of race. Other notable stars featured in this movie are Larry Fishburne, Nia Long, Angela Bassett and Regina King. In a memorable quote from the movie that particularly stands out and captures the essence of the film, Furious (Fishburne) asks Tre and Ricky: “Why do you think there's a liquor store on every corner? The same reason there's a gun store on every corner. They want us to kill ourselves.”\n\nThe film received rave reviews, and at only 23, Singleton became the youngest person and the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in 1992 for Best Director for his honest depiction of the nuances of race and class highlighted in the movie. The film was so important to pop culture that in 2002, it was selected by the Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry because of its powerful storytelling and gripping themes. The film is available on streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and AppleTV.\n\n22. Set It Off (1996)\n\nHistorically, Black women have endured complex realities in society, and through the lens of four main characters, Set It Off acted as a time capsule that captured a fraction of what Black women navigate in their day-to-day lived experiences. The action film’s impact was underscored by the carefully selected cast, who breathed life into their characters in a way that has made their characters continually referenced in pop culture almost three decades later. With Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox and Kimberly Elise, the movie offered powerful performances of women pushed to the breaking point under society’s often unrealistic expectations, especially directed toward Black women. The film, shot in Los Angeles, showcases how far four women were willing to go to escape a life of struggle and poverty. ​​Commercially, the film was a raving success and grossed over $41 million, even though its budget was significantly less at $9 million. The movie is available for streaming on Tubi, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n21. Moonlight (2016)\n\nWith themes of identity, love, and resilience taking center stage, Moonlight pushed the envelope of conventional storytelling through the life of Chiron, played by Alex Hibbert as a child, Ashton Sanders as a teenager, and Trevante Rhodes as an adult. The storyline follows a young Black man whose narrative unfolds in three critical stages of a man’s life growing up in Miami. The film, which is somewhat compartmentalized by Chiron’s three life stages, explores themes of self-discovery, queerness and Black identity. Notably, it explores the idea of masculinity and what it looks like to be Black, queer and confused. That is exactly the position that Chiron takes as he grapples with his worldview and environment. The film won three Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay. Based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, this deeply intimate movie explores multiple themes simultaneously. Moonlight is available on streaming services such as Hulu, YouTube TV, and Apple TV.\n\n20. Black Panther (2018)\n\nAs a cinematic milestone, Black Panther broke certain boundaries and redefined the superhero genre for comic fans. Previously, superhero films had only been imagined as primarily caucasian, with the occasional Black actor making a guest experience, but Black Panther offered something more intriguing: an unabashed celebration of African culture and ample representation of Black superheroes. Ryan Coogler's vision and the ensemble cast made it an even more groundbreaking reality. With riveting performances from talented actors like the late Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong’o, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira, Michael B. Jordan and a host of others, the movie was bound to be groundbreaking at its core. The movie was especially successful due to its timing, because it arrived on the heels of growing conversations around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. This allowed viewers to view the action film outside the lens of static stereotypes. The movie grossed a staggering $1.3 billion upon its release, becoming the highest-grossing movie featuring Black actors. The sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, was also commercially successful, proving that the formula for the original movie worked well. Movie lovers can stream the film on Disney+, Vudu and Hulu.\n\n19. Barbershop (2002)\n\nChicago is a city that has produced a lot of entertainment’s sharpest minds, and the windy city served as the fictional setting for Barbershop, a film that pays homage to the Black community and conversation. Historically, barbershops across vast America’s urban neighborhoods have been presented as the perfect spots for social culture and Black dialogue, and Tim Story used this key detail to hone the Barbershop storyline. With a stellar ensemble cast led by Ice Cube, the movie skillfully blended multiple genres, particularly comedy and drama, and hinges on themes of family, identity, legacy, loyalty, community, and friendship. This movie is currently streaming on RokuTV, Hulu, and AppleTV.\n\n18. Poetic Justice (1993)\n\nJohn Singleton’s Poetic Justice is not just a film, it is a cultural touchstone that has set trends in movies, fashion and culture. While Janet Jackson’s box braids became a central element of the movie, her on-screen chemistry with the late Tupac Shakur gave the film the added critical acclaim it has come to embody. Again, Singleton proved that he could work his magic into a storyline by exploring and brilliantly capturing nuances of African-American life in an honest, vulnerable and memorable way. The film follows the two main characters, Jackson (who plays Justice, a poet navigating the tragic loss of her boyfriend) and a postal worker (Shakur), whom she eventually develops an acquired taste for. Both characters represent the depth, complexity and authenticity of human nature, and together, they help viewers navigate themes of loss, racism and the pursuit of dreams, all while celebrating the resilience of the human spirit. Poetic Justice is available for streaming on platforms like Google Play TV, AppleTV, and Vudu.\n\n17. Coming to America (1988)\n\nIn the history of romantic comedies, Coming to America ranks high as one of the genre's best. The film follows the hilarious journey of Prince Akeem Joffer, played by Eddie Murphy, an African royal looking for true love. To accomplish this mission, he travels from the fictional Zamunda to Queens, New York, in an unexpected plot twist. The movie marked one of the pinnacles in Murphy's career, and his charismatic performance, coupled with the film's clever storytelling, contributed to the project’s worldwide box office total of over $288 million. The hilarious cultural commentary resonated with critics and audiences, some of whom were familiar with the nuances of immigration and life in a new country. The film was nominated for two Oscars and had an impressive lineup of actors, including Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones, Garcelle Beauvais, Samuel L. Jackson and Cuba Gooding Jr. Coming to America is available for streaming on SlingTV, YouTube and AppleTV\n\n16. Waiting to Exhale (1995)\n\nForest Whitaker’s Waiting to Exhale saw him wearing his feature film directorial debut, and was based on Terry McMillan's critically-acclaimed novel. The movie is one of the few on this list which delves into the intricacies of Black womanhood and the complexities, ebbs and flows of love, relationships and career. The film was well-received and got a lot of reviews for its excellent acting and realistic portrayal of Black women’s issues. Featured stars in the movie included Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine. This movie is available on Vudu, Amazon Prime and Hulu.\n\n15. The Color Purple (1985)\n\nKnown for his poignant stories and sharp acting, Steven Spielberg created a Black classic with 11-time Academy Award-nominated, The Color Purple. The 1985 movie is considered one of the most iconic Black movie of all time. The story is one of empowerment and captures a vulnerable and impoverished Black woman’s four-decade journey to self-empowerment and freedom from abuse. The movie was based on Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, and brought to life by the powerful acting of Whoopi Goldberg, who plays the main character, Celie. One of the most memorable lines from the movie is Oprah Winfrey’s character, Sophie, who belts out the line:\n\n“All my life I had to fight. I had to fight my daddy. I had to fight my uncles. I had to fight my brothers. A girl child ain't safe in a family of men, but I ain't never thought I'd have to fight in my own house!”\n\n14. Dreamgirls (2006)\n\nBill Condon’s 2006 musical drama followed the meteoric the rise of a Detroit-based 1960s girl group, The Dreamettes, played by Deena (Beyoncé Knowles-Carter) Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose). The musical highlights the deeply personal and professional challenges, rejections and complications that they faced on their journey to fame and fortune. The film, which was released on December 15, 2006, earned Hudson an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2007. Dreamgirls is available on Paramount+, Vudu and Showtime.\n\n13. Django Unchained (2012)\n\nKnown for his stark and dark storytelling, Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained did not stray to far from his usual themes, but dug a bit deeper. In Django Unchained, the renowned director retold the story of a freed slave who becomes a bounty hunter on a mission to help his wife regain her freedom from a cruel plantation owner. The movie did well at the box office, grossing a total of $426 million worldwide against a production budget of $100 million, and winning two Academy Awards.

Jackson as Stephen, Kerry Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft and Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie, the brutal Candyland plantation owner in Mississippi.

The movie also chronicles Mamie Till’s fight for justice for her son. It is a painfully riveting story that is brought to life with actors like Jaylyn Hall (who plays Emmett Till), Danielle Deadwyler (who plays Mamie Till) and Whoopi Goldberg (who played Alma Carthan). In several poignant ways, Till highlights the gut-wrenching relationship that often exists between Black mothers and their sons, and the heightened worry of raising a male child against the backdrop of systemic racism and police brutality. Till is availabe for streaming on MGM+, Philo and SlingTV.\n\n11. Creed II (2018)\n\nThe modern-day spin on Creed reimagined the iconic Rocky franchise with a new perspective, specifically angled towards ushering in a new generation to the world of boxing.

Even more riveting was the suave incorporation of comedy into an issue that is widely perceived as sensitive and trauma-filled. BlacKkKlansman is currently streaming on AppleTV, Hulu and Vudu.\n\n7.
