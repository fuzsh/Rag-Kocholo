        "text": "Growing up in Denver, Holly Square was the only place I remember being warned not to go. The square’s Holly Shopping Center was the sacred home of Denver’s first Bloods gang. But, despite a dearth of public reporting about it, the Holly was also legendary in the Black community for its activism. The connection between these seemingly disparate elements ultimately drove me to spend seven years reporting and writing a multigenerational story that explores the relationship between activism and street violence, from the Black Power movement to current day. The book was published in 2021 and, like the documentary, its “explosive” findings (Axios) of the targeting of a prominent activist set off a yearlong #battlefortruth as key people in Denver attempted to derail the project by spreading falsehoods about it. More on that soon….\n\nBut back in 2013, I was living in Brooklyn when a story in the New York Times caught my eye—about a shooting in Holly Square involving a well-known activist, Terrance Roberts. A third-generation resident of his historic neighborhood, Terrance now faced life in prison after firing five shots at a young gang member he worked with, during his own peace rally.\n\nThe damage was significant. Not only was the young gang member paralyzed, but Terrance—himself a former gang member—had been working on a federal anti-gang effort that aimed to reduce gun and gang violence in his community. Now, violence was on the rise again, as were tensions over a high-profile redevelopment of Holly Square that Terrance had become the face of.\n\nI managed to reach Terrance, who was out on bond and facing attempted murder charges. He agreed to meet me. He was an oversized presence, bursting with opinions on everything from slavery to hip hop to law enforcement’s use of gang informants to divide Black communities. All of it seemed to come back to the Holly. “I love the Holly,” he told me. “I’ve been shot for the Holly. It created my whole character.”\n\nTerrance had a theory about the day of the peace rally that wasn’t represented in any of the voluminous media coverage of the case. He believed he had been attacked by gang members working for law enforcement—because of his activism. Others I connected with in the community shared this perspective. “I knew [Terrance] was in danger the day he started marching,” one well-known clergyman told me. “The day he started speaking up, he was in danger.”\n\nI was determined to find out what had happened that day but as I continued reporting, events that illuminated the answers to those questions and others began happening in front of me. I asked and was granted approval to begin filming, and I moved back to Denver.\n\nFor the next eight years, I dug for key documents, and worked to gain the trust of members of the community who believed it was imperative that the truth about what happened that day, and for decades before it, be told. I carefully assembled a team of African American producers and filmmakers from both in and out of Colorado to make sure we made this sensitive film with the extra care and sensitivity to the community in which it takes place. Many people risked their lives to see this film get made, myself among them.\n\nTo me, THE HOLLY is an intimate portrait of one man’s struggle to escape his past and to help solve a mystery that could save him from a life behind bars. But it is also a story of how connections between powerful funders, elected officials, developers, law enforcement—and street gangs—can determine the future of a community. What we captured on camera also raises troubling questions about the conduct of informants, the use of active gang members in undercover operations as well as in “anti-gang” work, and about the connection between gentrification and violence.\n\nViolence in America’s most vulnerable communities is rising, as are threats and attacks against activists. I hope this film can shine a light on some of the unreported challenges facing these communities and the activists working in them.\n\nJulian Rubinstein\n\nDirector\n\nRubinstein is a journalist, documentary filmmaker and educator.
