        "text": "Even up to this day, African-Americans have been the subject of many struggles. In narrating these realities, documentary films have shone a light on the experiences of the African-American community.\n\nHistory of black documentary\n\nThe rich history of Black American documentary films can be traced back to the early 20th century. African-Americans began to use moving pictures to document their lives as soon as the technology became available in the early 20th century.\n\nBlack photographers like Addison Scurlock, Peter P. Jones, Jennie Louise Touissant Welcome, Ernest Touissant Welcome, and Arthur Laidler Macbeth used their photographic expertise to become some of the world's first documentary filmmakers.\n\nIn 1910 political leader and Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) founder Booker T. Washington commissioned filmmaker George W. Broome and the National Negro Business League to document Tuskegee's history.\n\nEarly works\n\nBroome‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Day at the Tuskegee‚Äù is considered as the first African-American documentary. The film opened at Carnegie Hall in New York City and was the first to reveal the documentary's political potential.\n\nBefore the advent of World War I several African-American film companies were established which produced silent films and documentaries. These films were screened in theaters, churches and schools.\n\nEarly black documentaries attempt to challenge the rising number of racist films by showcasing the impressive achievements and noteworthy activities of the African-American community.\n\nDawn of Truth (1915) by photographer and filmmaker Peter P. Jones combined a series of Jone‚Äôs shorts into one of the earliest historical survey documentaries.\n\nMost of the early African-American documentaries were newsreels and short subjects that because of poor archiving have deteriorated or completely lost.\n\n1920s and the rise of Hollywood\n\nIn the 1920 with the establishment of Hollywood and the studio system the cost of making movies and creating documentaries became more expensive and less accessible yet filmmakers like Edward Lewis, William Alexander, and Carlton Moss continued working.\n\nEdward Lewis, a photographer and filmmaker created several documentary shorts ‚ÄúLife in Harlem‚Äù which was released in 1936.\n\nWilliam Alexander founded the All America Newsreel Company and created the documentary A Call To Duty (1946) which focused on Black Americans serving in the military. Many of these documentaries would document an important segment of Black History.\n\nWorld War II\n\nDuring World War II filmmakers created documentaries that delved on African-Americans in the military. One of these films is \"The Negro Soldier\" in 1944 created by Carlton Moss, which was commissioned by the American War Department.\n\nüëâ Watch The Negro Soldier on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy The Negro Soldier as DVD on Amazon\n\n1960s documentary activism\n\nAt first many of the black documentary filmmakers would struggle in anonymity and isolation. Their films depicting their lives alongside a splice of black history would not be that well known.\n\nIn the 60s with the civil rights movement films were used as a tool to effect societal change particularly uniting the black community.\n\nAmong the noted documentaries include the ‚ÄúFive Cities of June‚Äù released in 1963. This documentary was created by Bruce Herschensohn. It was an Academy Award nominated work. The film details the events of June 1963 in five cities. This included the event in Tuscaloosa, Alabama where the racial integration at the University of Alabama.\n\nüëâ Watch Five Cities of June Amazon Prime\n\n1970s Black Power Movement\n\nThe Black Power movement‚Äôs emphasis on preserving Black History which coincided with the rise of the Black independent film movement resulted in the production of an unprecedented number of African-American documentaries.\n\nAmong these films include Malcolm X (1972) which is based on the 1965 book ‚ÄúThe Autobiography of Malcolm X.‚Äù Another acclaimed documentary is the Academy Award-nominated ‚ÄúJack Johnson‚Äù (1970). which details the life of celebrated boxer Jack Johnson.\n\nAnother widely acclaimed documentary is ‚ÄúKing: A Filmed Documentary‚Ä¶ Montgomery to Memphis‚Äù about civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. It was nominated for best documentary feature in the Academy Award.

More and more African-American filmmakers produced documentaries featuring a myriad of topics.\n\nIn recent years the number of African-American women and gay filmmakers have grown in number and so are films which address gender and sexuality. These filmmakers are continuously making personal, essay and experimental documentaries.\n\nAmong these documentaries included Marlon Riggs's Tongues Untied (1989) and Isaac Julien's Looking for Langston (1989).\n\nThe advancement of digital video technology has made producing documentaries more accessible.
