        "text": "Every February, the United States acknowledges the history and achievements of African Americans with Black History Month.\n\nThe Des Plaines Public Library plays its part in this annual observance by featuring Black History Month displays containing media from and about Black artists on both the third and fourth floor.\n\nHere is a brief overview of how this month-long observance came to be and explain this year’s theme as decided by the ASALH.\n\nA curated list of books, films, and music related to the theme is included, as well.\n\nWhy was February chosen as Black History Month?\n\nIn 1926, historian and journalist Dr. Carter G. Woodson declared the second week of February as “Negro History Week.”\n\nWoodson chose this particular week in order to honor two Americans who played a prominent role in the advancement of African American people: Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglas, whose birthdays are respectively the 12th and 14th of February.\n\nThe shift from being only a week-long observance to one that lasted the whole month prominently began in the 60s, a decade in which Black educators and students across the country used their influence to bring greater awareness to Black history.\n\nTheir collective efforts would prove fruitful when, in 1975, President Gerald Ford officially recognized February as Black History Month.\n\nYou can read the full origins of Black History Month on the ASALH’s official website.\n\nWhat is the ASALH?\n\nASALH stands for the Association for the Study of African-American Life and History.\n\nAccording to their website, the ASALH was established by Dr. Carter G. Woodson on September 9, 1915 in order to help teach the public about Black history.\n\nEvery February, the ASALH decides on a new theme for Black History Month in order to explore a new facet of African American culture.\n\n2024’s Black History Theme is African Americans and the Arts\n\nThis year, the ASALH announced that the theme of 2024’s Black History Month will be African Americans and the Arts.\n\nAs part of the announcement, the ASALH highlighted a number of artistic forms and cultural movements in which African American influence was and is prominent, including the Black Renaissance of the 20s and 30s, music such as jazz and hip-hop, and even a contemporary subgenre of speculative fiction called Afrofuturism.\n\nIf you want to experience the many rich and diverse forms Black art can take, please consider checking out any of the following recommended media listed below.\n\nWant More?\n\nMake sure to check out the Black History Month displays on your next visit to the library\n\nExplore all the online Black History Month resources and streaming content available in DPPL's online collections.\n\nRead what we have recommended in years past HERE, HERE, and HERE."
