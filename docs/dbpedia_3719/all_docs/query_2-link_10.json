        "text": "From Hallie Quinn Brown, Charlene Carruthers, Angela Davis, Pauli Murray, to Bayard Rustin, Barbara Smith, and William Still, learn more about these historic heroes with the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\nMuse to renowned painter Théodore Géricault, learn more about one of the most famous Black models of the 19th-century with the Getty Museum.\n\nA preeminent and underrecognized figure of 20th-century American art, celebrate Rowe and learn more about how she uses her practice as a radical act of self-expression, and liberation for a Black woman artist living and working in the American South.\n\nActive from 1501 until the 1860s, or over 360 years, the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade affected the lives of an estimated 12.5 million Africans who were forced from their homes and transported across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas.\n\nRegardless of how they were preserved, each story is essential to connecting to and understanding their journey.\n\nThe design of this space is intended to encourage you to remember, reckon with, and reflect upon the past while understanding that it is our duty to our ancestors to reclaim the future.\n\nThe Tide Tribute is sacred ground, a tribute to the many enslaved Africans who did not survive the journey across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nMillions of enslaved men, women, and children were transported to and from these ports on slave ships. Enslaved Africans were viewed as cargo, tools to be taken and sold to the highest bidder.\n\nTo maximize their profits, enslavers would often pack their prisoners as tightly as possible. Beneath the water, these figures represent the thousands of enslaved whose forced journey brought them to the shores of Gadsden’s Wharf.\n\nDesigned to mirror the rising and falling of the tide, the tribute pool’s water levels fill and drain at different times of the day. These are the same tides that carried the ships full of captured Africans onto this land as they were brought onto the shore for processing.\n\nOutlined in a one-dimensional display of bricks on the ground, the storage house tells the story of how enslaved Africans who arrived at Gadsden’s Wharf were viewed and treated. To their oppressors, these individuals were livestock, or animals looked upon as an asset.\n\nHistorical records show that during a particularly cold winter season in the early 1800s, over 700 enslaved Africans perished in this storage house from the severe weather conditions waiting to be sold.\n\nAnd finally, to the outside of the first granite wall, is an inscription on the outside. An excerpt from the Maya Angelou poem, “Still I Rise.” “Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. I am the dream and hope of the slave. I rise. I rise. I rise.”\n\nA popular practice in Charleston during the period of enslavement was for enslaved craftsmen to wear these badges when they were loaned out to other enslavers or individuals who required their skills.\n\nAt the exit of the sweetgrass field, are the Water Drop Teardrop Planters. These beautiful installations are filled with brush and grasses native to the Lowcountry.\n\nThis work was created in 1982, a particularly important moment in the career of Jean-Michel Basquiat, after his discovery as an artist, and before his period of maximum productivity.\n\nMost of the pictorial surface is taken up by a chaotic jumble of scrawls, words, numbers, symbols, and colors. Humor, irony, and primitivism define this forceful, representative painting. The resulting effect is that of a crowd of shouting, echoing, responding voices. The repetitions, variations, cross-outs, and spelling mistakes are reminiscent of graffiti.\n\nThe title of the painting comes from a phrase written over the head of a red pig which, although surrounded by countless inscriptions, splashes of color, cross-outs, and elementary signs, dominates the composition like a totemic image.\n\n'Man from Naples' was inspired by his visit to Italy in 1982 and reflects the artist’s feelings of resentment toward his wealthy Italian patron, whom he scornfully refers to as a “pork merchant” and other unflattering epithets.\n\nDance is more than the pirouette of a ballet dancer and the fast-footed rhythm of tap. Each movement has a history, each angle wordlessly expresses an emotion, and a whole story can be embodied in a single step. In honor of Black History Month, Google Arts & Culture takes a look at top dance companies and individuals who use their talents to create a moving commentary on the black experience.\n\nThe stories being told by these dancers and choreographers uphold the fact that black dance doesn’t stand independently of black history, but rather wordlessly expresses the narrative of a people through movements, productions, and an individual’s career. Their work raises social issues with their choreography, strengthens community through their programming, and uses history as a source of inspiration.\n\nThe performances created by these dancers are connected to the most iconic places, people, and events in history; with them you can explore themes spanning activism, women’s rights, LGBT intersectionality, and iconic literature and art."
