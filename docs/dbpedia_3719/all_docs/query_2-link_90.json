        "text": "What is the inspiration for the \"Twenty & Odd\" film?\n\nMathew John, director and executive producer: In 2011, I was an intern for the National Capital Region and was given an assignment to film the excavation of the L'Hermitage slave village at Monocacy National Battlefield in Frederick, Maryland. My focus was to capture the HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) interns performing the archaeological dig under the leadership of project manager, Joy Beasley. As I filmed the group sifting through the dirt, I remember feeling such profound sadness. Sadness because the memories of 90 or more enslaved individuals had been relegated to just buried remnants. The history of the site and that moment weighed on me, but as the voice of my favorite artist blared through my headphones and I tuned into the lives of the archaeological team, the inspiration appeared. \"Twenty & Odd\" was inspired by African American people and it is simply meant to be, and will always be, about the beauty of the African American experience.\n\nChristian Bacon, producer: Our inspiration was the lack of appropriate acknowledgment surrounding the horrific experiences of our ancestors coupled with the lack of appropriate language around the ever-present implications of said trauma.\n\nWhy is this film important to you?\n\nChristian Bacon: This film gave me an opportunity to highlight my creativity while paying respects and homage to the people that came before me. I have always been extremely passionate about Black history and I was super excited to be a part of a team of individuals that were as passionate about creating art as me. I believe more often than not, Black history is sensationalized and the voices of Black people are muted for white audiences, but this film is different and expresses pain, joy and triumph in a relevant way.\n\nRidasian Moore, producer: This film is an opportunity to highlight and represent African Americans in a way that prior to now they have not been. This film tells the story of African Americans in parks in an authentic way, one that resonates with the culture and across generations. We finally have a film that celebrates who we are versus highlighting the hardships of our journey in America. We invite African Americans and all Americans to come learn about their history, experience their legacy, and share their stories with NPS and the world.\n\nSubria Spencer, producer: \"Twenty & Odd\" is more than just a film to me. It is the start of hopefully a new wave of storytelling in the National Park Service. A wave that invites the storytellers, those with the first-hand or generational experiences, to share their story. As Mathew has said before, the National Park Service is a platform or stage that helps to elevate the voices of communities. Through \"Twenty & Odd\", we amplify the beauty of Black people and Black history. We shed light on the fact that our history is American history and there must be no distinction between the two. \"Twenty & Odd\" is essentially the foundation and hopefully a framework to be used by under-highlighted communities in the future. That is the ultimate goal.\n\nWhat is one of the most meaningful moments you experienced during the production of the film?\n\nChristian Bacon: The most meaningful moment for me took place at Fort Monroe. Our ability to really connect with each other in such a vulnerable and emotional place, physically and emotionally, was overwhelming but so necessary.\n\nKayla Hall, producer: I don’t think that I can pinpoint one specific moment, but having the opportunity to help design the sets and develop the wardrobe for the cast was truly special. Everything in \"Twenty & Odd\" was intentional. Every item you see in the frame, the placement of people, the facial expressions -- it was all planned out. Our focus was to ensure that the true beauty of Black people would be visibly seen in every shot, so I kept this in mind when helping to think about what the shots should look like. Acquiring all of the props we needed proved to be a bit of a challenge, but our team made it work!\n\nRidasian Moore: The most meaningful moments for me were having my toddler, Iam, at African Burial Ground National Monument in New York. It was great to be doing something I am passionate about and involving him in a learning experience that shows him the history of African Americans building the foundation of our country. Also, this was a moment in which we realized how heavy the responsibility of telling our ancestors' story really is, and how important it is to continue to capture and share their stories… our stories.\n\nAnd finally, our conversations and meetings with our stakeholders and other NPS employees, in the Washington, D.C. office and in the field were also extremely special. The guidance and support we received from leaders like George McDonald, Sara Newman, Sonya Coakley, Dr. Turkiya Lowe, Reginald Chapple, Enimini Ekong, Steve Hargrave, Judy Forte, Maggie Tyler, and others was crucial. Their belief in our vision, and their support and advocacy of our efforts is really what got \"Twenty & Odd\" across the finish line. That type of leadership is necessary to advocate for diversity, create opportunities, and ensure burgeoning talent have a “seat at the table.” After our trip to the African Burial Ground, we had a very candid conversation with our stakeholders about self-care and mental health. I knew then that not only did they support the film, they also supported the team. As an employee or intern, knowing that you are valued is a beacon of light to keep pushing forward.\n\nSubria Spencer: The most memorable moment for me was when I called my grandmother in California to hear about her reaction to the film. Thankfully, Ridasian recorded this conversation because it is one that will stick with me forever.\n\nThrough overflowing tears, my grandmother shared that she was in awe and so blown away by the piece we had created. She explained that many of the highlighted experiences and dark moments in history did not feel that long ago to her and she recalls watching the horrific events of Bloody Sunday on the news. She also recounted her sentiments when she visited the Edmund Pettus bridge and the chills she felt seeing it featured in the film. As we ended the conversation, she expressed an overwhelming sense of joy and hope for our generation as we hold on to our history, but continue to press forward and show the beauty and brilliance of our culture.\n\nHow did you select the national parks and locations featured in the film?\n\nChristian Bacon: The national parks each feature significant elements of Black history. The southeastern portion of the U.S. holds so much joy and so much pain. We wanted to film in places that were culturally significant. While national parks are all over the country, we wanted to focus on the few that currently tell vibrant stories that directly relate to the experiences of our forefathers and foremothers.\n\nSubria Spencer: Let me start by saying that this entire project was built on strategic action. In fact, “Intentional, Strategic and Black” is a mantra that we developed because we understood that we had limited resources, a short timeframe to film, and a number of sites to choose from.\n\nThankfully, we garnered the support from National Park Service Chief Historian Dr. Turkiya Lowe. She provided a thorough list of sites that held African American significance for us to research and choose from. Through great deliberation, we determined the most cost effective and feasible travel schedule that would allow us to highlight the most sites.\n\nWhile many of the sites have been highlighted throughout history, many people don't know the connection between the sites and the National Park Service. In fact, we found that much of the public and our volunteer cast members were unaware of that very connection. For example, our first shoot began at Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park and featured five men in suits. A few of them shared that they had grown up in Atlanta and even lived in an adjacent neighborhood, but never knew that Dr. King's birth home was a National Park Service site. In that moment, I think we realized the true power of what \"Twenty & Odd\" could do and would do for ordinary people.\n\nWhy was it important to show people in parks?\n\nChristian Bacon: Representation matters! Showing people that they belong in these spaces is important. Allowing individuals to see a representation of themselves makes them more likely to engage in these parks. Seeing billboards and videos of people that don’t share your experience can make the idea daunting and mentally inaccessible.\n\nRidasian Moore: This was a crucial element of the film because this was our opportunity to really highlight the parks and the rich history they preserve along with the adventures that await you when you visit. Unfortunately, African Americans are not represented in spaces like national parks due to an unrealistic belief that we are not “into nature” or do not have an interest in learning about U.S. history -- which is false. The key here for us was to recreate moments that African Americans cherish in a universally relatable way in parks and sites that are accessible and offer an immersive learning and recreational experiences.\n\nSubria Spencer: I invite you to take a moment, close your eyes and think of a time when you have had to visualize yourself in a new space. This could be a workplace, a school, or even a restaurant in your own community. Are you able to immediately form a connection in your mind to someone or something that brings you comfort and allows you to imagine yourself participating in activities or simply existing in a new environment?\n\nSeeing a lack of Black people and people of color in national parks does not help these communities visualize themselves in these spaces. The reality is that there is a complicated and troubled past as it relates to nature and the outdoors for many marginalized communities. Our society, at certain points in history, have even encouraged active exclusion of individuals in national park spaces.\n\nFortunately, we have a wealth of diverse communities with unique experiences that can be celebrated through parks now. We have an opportunity to find the gaps and take action. We must understand that showing people in parks and becoming intentional about diverse representation not only helps to quell unwarranted societal stereotypes, but it also allows those very communities to confront their own history and find ways to heal.\n\nRepresentation inspires imagination, creativity, and a sense of belonging. Individuals become empowered and motivated to act when they see themselves in the process and ultimately, we want everyone to be able to establish lifelong connections to parks. It honestly brings me joy to imagine black and brown faces watching \"Twenty & Odd\" and feeling a sense of pride in seeing people that look like them take up space in a real way.\n\nWhat do you hope people will do after seeing this film?\n\nKayla Diallo, producer: My hope is that Black people will view this film and be inspired to explore the parks and other historical sites around them. The African American experience is essential to the story of America, but if our stories aren’t told in an accurate way, they begin to fade into the background. The NPS prides itself on being America’s storyteller, yet many people do not see themselves represented in these spaces. I hope this film motivates the NPS to continue to cultivate opportunities where young creatives can explore the history around them and create projects centered around communities of color.\n\nRidasian Moore: I hope that this film inspires another generation of interns, thinkers, and innovators to continue to push the wheel forward in how we engage with national parks both in a visitor capacity as well as within the NPS workforce. I hope more young African Americans apply for positions within the NPS and implement actionable change via programs, policies, videos, etc. It is so important that we have diversity when it comes to making decisions for the larger NPS audience. I believe it will ultimately lead to racial equity within the workforce, communications strategies, and programs, in addition to meeting the NPS goal of engaging with new audiences.\n\nSubria Spencer: It is important to note that our creative team was not made up of filmmakers and we did not have extensive knowledge about the development process. However, we possessed something that was truly powerful and essential to the project. We brought our shared experiences and individual stories to the table. I hope that \"Twenty & Odd\" reminds people that they too have stories and experiences worth sharing. I hope that people feel motivated to get out and find a park that connects to them.\n\nWhy is the companion guide an important element of this film?\n\nRhea Warren, producer: On its own, \"Twenty & Odd\" is powerful. The audio and visuals tie together a powerful story of African American beauty and the legacy tied to the national parks. The companion guide allows viewers to delve deeper into why park sites were chosen, what certain lines of Dr. Maya Angelou's poem represent to us, what historical moments were highlighted, and how all these elements tie together. After watching the video, then reading the guide, and then watching the video again, viewers can fully understand the entirety of the depths of \"Twenty & Odd\".\n\nRidasian Moore: We knew that a four minute and twenty-five second film could not express everything that we wished to share. The companion guide was one of the critical deliverables that we needed to create to offer viewers greater insight into our creative process. Rhea Warren was instrumental in the development of this key piece which is essential for understanding the symbolism, cultural traditions, expressions, and the actor selection for each scene. This guide expounds upon themes weaved into the story such as family, fatherhood, sexuality, outdoor recreation, and more.\n\nWhat do you personally love about national parks?\n\nRidasian Moore: I love the serendipitous adventures and knowledge that you gain in parks. We have all had our history and civics classes, and heard stories of great leaders; however, being in the places where history has happened brings a special element of understanding and personalizes the stories we are taught.\n\nSubria Spencer: Let me be honest. I knew very little about national parks before beginning my career with the National Park Service.\n\nI had heard of the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone, but I never realized their connection to the larger system or that there were other more accessible parks closer to my community. I would say that this is a reality for many individuals. However, since working at the National Park Service, I have come to realize that national parks are truly special gems that are waiting to be explored. Not only do they offer the rich history of America, but they also serve as a health resource for all.\n\nWhen you visit a national park, you can tap into every aspect of health from emotional, physical, mental, spiritual, and even environmental. I love that I have the opportunity as a communications specialist within the National Park Service Office of Public Health to engage diverse communities in parks and help show how parks can positively impact their health too."
