        "text": "Black History Month 2024 Theme\n\nSince 1976, every American president has designated February as Black History Month and endorsed a specific theme.\n\nThe Black History Month 2024 theme, “African Americans and the Arts,” explores the key influence African Americans have had in the fields of “visual and performing arts, literature, fashion, folklore, language, film, music, architecture, culinary and other forms of cultural expression.”\n\nIn celebrating the rich history of African Americans and the Arts, Prevent Child Abuse America puts into the national spotlight the abundance of the past and the present with an eye towards what the remaining twenty-first century has in store. This year, PCA America highlights Art for Change, welcoming you to explore the purpose and the impact of black art across the nation.\n\nThe role of fathers is unique and has great impact on children’s lives. Read here from our current board member, Dr. Clinton Boyd Jr., and former fellow of zerotothree as he honors BHM by speaking up on black fatherhood.\n\nOrigins of Black History Month\n\nBlack History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by African Americans and a time for recognizing their central role in U.S. history. Also known as African American History Month, this observance begins in 1915, half a century after the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States.\n\nThat September, the Harvard-trained historian Carter G. Woodson and the prominent minister Jesse E. Moorland founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH), an organization dedicated to researching and promoting achievements by Black Americans and other peoples of African descent.\n\nBy the late 1960s, thanks in part to the civil rights movement and a growing awareness of Black identity, “Negro History Week” had evolved into Black History Month on many college campuses.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford officially recognized Black History Month in 1976, calling upon the public to “seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.”\n\nBlack History Month is a time to honor the contributions and legacy of African Americans across U.S. history and society—from activists and civil rights pioneers such as Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Rosa Parks to leaders in industry, politics, science, culture and more.\n\nSupporting families to support children!\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nEducator Resources | National Civil Rights Museum\n\nBLACK HISTORY THEMES – ASALH – The Founders of Black History Month\n\nBlack History Month | Smithsonian Institution (si.edu)\n\nCelebrating Black History Month | ZERO TO THREE\n\nWhat is the cause of racial disparity in child welfare? – Child Welfare Monitor\n\nShare on Social\n\nTake action and make your voice heard this year as we honor and celebrate African American artists through their crafts.
