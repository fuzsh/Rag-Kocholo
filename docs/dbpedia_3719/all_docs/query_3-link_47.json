        "text": "RIZE is a beautiful and moving documentary about new urban dance styles that offer young people a positive and healthy alternative to gang involvement, drugs or a life of crime. Originating in Los Angeles’ notorious South Central neighborhoods, this movement crosses ethnic lines and is gaining in popularity. Most surprisingly of all, many of the dancers are Christians who openly credit God and praise Him for introducing this new art form to them. The movie uses Christian songs, portrays Christians in a positive light, and shows godly young people using dance to draw troubled youth away from violent and self-destructive lifestyles. RIZE does contain some mild obscenities and racial slurs (mostly heard as lyrics in two of the dance songs), some sexually-suggestive dancing, and quite a bit of upper male nudity, but the movie is tremendously inspiring and encouraging about the positive impact these new dance forms are having on broken families and troubled communities.\n\nThe movie opens with the disclaimer that no footage has been sped up in any way. Later, Director David LaChapelle wisely slows the dance scenes down so that viewers can appreciate the complexity and beauty of this rapid and aggressive art form. RIZE credits local resident and neighborhood hero Tommy the Clown as the originator of this dance style, aptly nicknamed “Clowning.” Tommy is shown at birthday parties and family gatherings, entertaining all ages with balloon animals, illusions and, of course, dance.\n\nTommy the Clown encourages his party audiences (children and adults) and captivated neighbors to join in the dance as his speakers blast hip-hop music from the back of his little clown car. In the mid-1990s, when Tommy first came up with Clowning, he began recruiting talented young people to dance with him and bring smiles to the happy crowds. Soon, other Clowning groups formed and some even splintered off with their own dance style called “Krumping.” Today, there are more than 50 Clowning and Krumping dance groups committed to giving young people a safe and positive outlet amidst their tragic surroundings.\n\nRIZE rises to inspirational heights when it shows the 5th annual competition between the various dance groups. Thousands are thrilled at this exciting event and watch as Tommy’s team (Clowners) takes on a group of talented Krumpers in this riveting “Battle Zone.” Though some teams and dancers are declared winners, it seems that all of the young people involved are genuine winners in the daily struggle for their souls. The dancers and their families repeatedly emphasize the value of living godly lives and gang-free.\n\nMOVIEGUIDE® readers should understand that the marketing of this documentary does not match the predominant message or content. In publicity materials, the new dance styles are described as “borne of oppression” and a possible “reaction to the Rodney King riots.” In fact, however, Clowning and Krumping are positive alternatives to the hip hop lifestyle. In RIZE, young people renounce the “bling” lifestyle (materialism and wealth usually associated with gangs) and credit God with saving them through their involvement with this new movement. They are shown helping others, mentoring abandoned and neglected children, and even “Krumping for Christ.”\n\nRIZE dramatically weaves in gospel hymns (“Seek Ye the Lord” and “Amazing Grace”) and godly songs (“O Happy Day” and “Ghetto Gospel”). Christians are shown praying, worshipping and encouraging one another. RIZE has some mature content, but its hopeful themes and strong Christian messages should attract people everywhere."
