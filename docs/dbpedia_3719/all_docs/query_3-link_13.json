Taking advantage of unprecedented access, this documentary film brings to first light a revolutionary form of artistic expression borne from oppression.\n\nThe aggressive and visually stunning dance modernizes moves indigenous to African tribal rituals and features mind-blowing, athletic movement sped up to impossible speeds. “Rize” tracks the fascinating evolution of the dance: we meet Tommy Johnson (Tommy the Clown), who first created the style as a response to the 1992 Rodney King riots and named it Clowning, as well as the kids who developed the movement into what they now call Krumping. The kids use dance as an alternative to gangs and hustling.\n\n21h00, Small Auditorium\n\nLiberia: an Uncivil War [I]\n\nJonathan Stack\n\n102’ USA 2004\n\nIn Liberia, the summer of 2003 was pure insanity: two armies are in the final battle of a fifteen-year civil war, holding the capital under siege while thousands die from mortar shells launched from afar. As the soldiers, mostly teenagers, fight a bloody urban battle, the nation prays that American forces show up to put an end to the violence. Liberia, a country founded by freed American slaves, has a long intertwined history with America. The film presents the complex layers of the conflict and focuses attention on the moral failure of the U.S. to respond to a growing humanitarian crisis.\n\n21h00 Large Auditorium\n\nMermaids [CI]\n\nDina Campos Lopes\n\n70’ Portugal 2005\n\nInvited by Portuguese organizations, Rebecca Gomperts launches pro-choice intervention action in Portugal. Managing director of the organization Women on Waves, this abortion activist heads on with her polemic actions, these cross national frontiers and question a pre-established structure of intervention in public life. The “Abortion Boat”, as it is known by the media, rescues from international maritime laws the possibility to transport a gynecological clinic, fully equipped, to women that otherwise have to turn to illegal abortion. Once in international waters the boat is under the laws of the flag's origin country – The Netherlands, after visiting Ireland and Poland the boat sails to Portuguese waters.\n\n23h00 Small Auditorium\n\nMassaker [I]\n\nMonika Borgmann, Lokman Slim, Hermann Theissen\n\n98’ Germany 2004\n\nTwenty years later after the massacre of Sabra and Shatila during the Lebanese civil war, the directors set out to discover what drives “normal” people to carry out such excessive acts of violence and atrocities. Is it war that made murderers of them? Six of the militiamen involved are interviewed: six perpetrators, each with his own character and life story but who obeying commands and of their own free will jointly participated in the massacre. The restricted area where the interview is held represents an austerely radical choice that casts the figures in ghostly roles. “Massaker” is neither a parody of a trial nor an attempt at psychotherapy. Rather, it can be understood as a psycho-political analysis.\n\n23h00, Large Auditorium\n\nCell Stories [CI]\n\nEd Lachman\n\n10’ USA 2004\n\nThis is the first documentary to be entirely shot with the video function of a cell phone. Four ultra-short films in which people tell tall tales about their cell phones. The image is divided into six segments that chop up the narrator and visualise the story.\n\nFollowing Sean [CI]\n\nRalph Arlyck\n\n88’ USA 2004\n\nFilmmaker Ralph Arlyck first met Sean while living as a graduate student in San Francisco's Haight Ashbury neighborhood at the height of the 1960s. The city was awash with the trappings of America's cultural revolution-the San Francisco State University campus flooded with cops in riot gear, the Haight filled with drifters and idealists, and, on the third floor of Arlyck's building, a comeone-come-all crashpad apartment. It was from this top floor commune that the precocious 4-year-old Sean would occasionally wander downstairs to visit and talk-and one day Arlyck turned on his camera. Thirty years, three generations, and a lifetime later, Arlyck has returned to San Francisco in search of who the adult Sean may have become.\n\n[top]\n\nSunday 16\n\n14h30, Small Auditorium\n\nWednesday [R]\n\nVictor Kossakovski\n\n93’ Russia 1997\n\nWednesday, July 19th, 1961. It is summertime and the newspapers are filled with the usual articles. The world is deeply embedded in the Cold War. Fifty-one girls and fifty boys are born in Leningrad on this day. One of them is filmmaker Viktor Kossakovsky. St. Petersburg, 1995. The city carries the name of its founder once again. This small detail registers the enormous political changes that have occurred since those 101 children were born. What ever happened to them? How have their lives evolved since July 19, 1961? Does this date bind them to a shared destiny, or will they have nothing in common at all? Setting out with nothing but these questions and a camera, Kossakovsky undertakes the massive challenge of locating the 100 other people who share his birth date.\n\n14h30, Large Auditorium\n\nSrebrenica: a Cry from the Grave [HE]\n\nLeslie Woodhead\n\n104’ United Kingdom 1999\n\nSrebrenica, Bosnia, the world's first United Nations Safe Area, was the site of the worst case of genocide in Europe since World War II. In July 1995, the Bosnian Serb army staged a brutal takeover of the small, intimate spa town and its surrounding region. Over a period\n\nof five days, the Bosnian Serb soldiers separated Muslim families and systematically murdered over 7,000 men and boys in fields, schools, and warehouses.\n\n16h30, Small Auditorium\n\nThe Pipeline Next Door [I]\n\nNino Kirtadzé\n\n90’ France 2005\n\nThe little village of Sakiré is witnessing the most feverish days it has ever seen. A giant pipeline built by British Petroleum will soon cut right through this haven of peace, this oasis of clean air, this Caucasian paradise... This film is a human comedy with a universal dimension, a modern fairy tale, intertwining in a unique way a local reality with a global dimension. It is a parable for globalization: in any other country, small communities attached to their roots and customs could experience the same thing if they were confronted with decisions coming from powerful and distant countries...\n\n16h30, Large Auditorium\n\nShape of the Moon [CI]\n\nLeonard Retel Helmrich\n\n92’ The Neetherlands 2004\n\nShape of the Moon follows one Indonesian family navigating their country's myriad partitions: between urban and rural, Muslim and Christian, old world and new. Catholic widow Rumidja provides the film's anchor, as she struggles to overcome the chaos and poverty of urban Jakarta, and attempts to adapt to her son's recent conversion to Islam. With Jakarta growing ever more violent, and some of its citizens increasingly fundamentalist, Rumidja dreams of escaping to her native Central Java, but knows that its villages offer little hope for her or her small granddaughter.\n\n18h30, Small Auditorium\n\nFrom the East [HE]\n\nChantal Ackerman\n\n107’ France 1993\n\nWithout dialogue or commentary, Chantal Akerman has created a revelatory “documentary bordering upon fiction” in which her camera traverses the places, people, and landscapes encountered on a voyage begun in late summer in East Germany, heading across Poland, eventually ending in deep winter in Moscow. In an attempt to capture, “while there is still time,” the look of countries in throes a great change, “D'Est” takes us through a world of crumbling symbols where individuals continue to struggle for survival.\n\n18h30, Large Auditorium\n\nThe Light of Ria Formosa [P]\n\nJoão Botelho\n\n52’ Portugal 2005\n\nMeandering among the Milreu Roman ruins, amid the remains of magnificent mosaics, a mother (played by actress Susana Borges) teaches her son the ways of life and braces him for a journey drawing on the advice of “stoic” Seneca – a man who was so wise and ascetic that the mad despot Nero, to whom Seneca was counsellor, distressed by the extent of his knowledge and insouciance, “ordered” him to commit suicide. “Reading breeds intelligence…” The same holds true for seeing and listening. Thus, we follow mother and son, alone or together, on a journey over a stretch of land, estuary and sea, over a supposedly “protected” (?) area a little over 40 kms long, a unique, vibrant and striking lagoon system where light has centre stage. “That fleshly light that quivers and stirs like the wings of a cicada”, as Raul Brandão put it, that tangible light which is the origin of all life and all thought, as I would put it.\n\nJoão Botelho\n\n21h00 Small Auditorium\n\nBeckett’s Prisoners [I]\n\nMichka Saal\n\n90’ France 2005\n\nThe story of an encounter between two worlds that never meet. A world of poetry and freedom, and a world of darkness where freedom is unknown. This true story starts in a maximum security prison in Sweden where a young actor decides to direct Samuel Beckett's “Waiting for Godot”, with five inmates in the main roles. The rehearsals and acting are of a unique authenticity: Beckett himself is so moved by the truth in their work, that he gives away the rights for his play. Then a contagious madness carries everybody away: the prison's manager is first to think that the prisoners should perform in a live theatre and pleads for the permission to a public premiere to Swedish authorities. For the first time in prison's history, five prisoners travel out of their maximum security jail, to perform outside in the free world, in Göteburg Theatre.\n\n21h00, Large Auditorium\n\nFiat Lux [P]\n\nLuís Alves de Matos\n\n16’ Portugal 2005\n\nIn a place near Tondela, a small community waited nearly 25 years for the electricity. Five years later they finally got it.\n\nPortrait [P]\n\nCarlos Ruiz Carmona\n\n83’ Portugal/Spain 2004\n\nFamily photographs, memories, landscapes and scenes from the everyday life constitute the portrait of an attitude and a way of life. The portrait of a generation where marriage was “until death do us apart”, and a time of misery and oppression marked by the inheritance of the Spanish Civil War. The portrait of man and woman, father, mother and son, their worries, dreams, disappointments, experiences and feelings. The portrait of identity, origin, memory and a life like a puzzle to solve. Sometimes a confusing portrait, almost blurred, like memories. A portrait where facial expressions question the past, present and future, on the debate of life itself. We go round and round again but questions remain: who are we and why are we like this?\n\n23h00, Small Auditorium\n\nBread Day [R]\n\nSergei Dvortsevoi\n\n53‘ Russia 1998\n\n80 km from St Petersburg lies the near-abandoned workers’ settlement where only a handful of elderly people remains. Food is delivered to the people once a week.

Some time in the 1960's, in the heart of Africa, a new animal was introduced into Lake Victoria as a little scientific experiment. The Nile Perch, a voracious predator, extinguished almost the entire stock of the native fish species. However, the new fish multiplied so fast, that its white fillets are today exported all around the world. Huge hulking ex-Soviet cargo planes come daily to collect the latest catch in exchange for their southbound cargo… Kalashnikovs and ammunitions for the uncounted wars in the dark center of the continent. This booming multinational industry of fish and weapons has created an ungodly globalized alliance on the shores of the world's biggest tropical lake.\n\n[top]\n\nMonday 17\n\n11h00, Small Auditorium\n\nOccupation: Dreamland [I]\n\nGarrett Scott, Ian Olds\n\n78’ USA 2005\n\nOccupation: Dreamland is a melancholic portrait of a squad of the US Army's 82nd Airborne deployed in the doomed Iraqi city of Falluja during the winter of 2004. A collective study of the squad unfolds as they cope with an environment of low-intensity conflict and confusion creeping steadily towards catastrophe. Through the squad's activities Occupation: Dreamland provides a vital glimpse into the last days of Falluja before a final series of assaults began in the spring of 2004 that effectively destroyed the city. The result is a revealing, sometimes surprising look at Army life, operations and the complexity of American war in the 21st century.\n\n14h30, Small Auditorium\n\nThe Bridge [HE]\n\nde Ileana Stanculescu\n\n75’ Romenia 2004\n\nAn old bridge between a Romanian and a Ukrainian town is being rebuild with the financial support of the European Union. The bridge over the Tisza river was destroyed during the Second World War and the river became the border between Romania and the Soviet Union. This border separated for almost fifty years members of the same families, friends and neighbours. The reconstruction of the bridge is now ready, but nobody is allowed to cross it. One of the reasons for that is the enlargement of the E.U. Romania wants to become an E.U. member in 2007 and has to secure its borders to the Ukraine.\n\n16h30, Small Auditorium\n\nMeet Me in the Rothko Room [CI]\n\nRob John\n\n18’ United Kingdom 2004\n\nFilmed over five days in the Tate Modern, this film primarily acts as a social commentary, offering the viewer a chance to observe the observing. The addition of narrative through an eclectic range of characters and the Tate Modern's own audio act together to bring the paintings and the life of Mark Rothko alive to both familiar and non familiar audiences. Finally the voice of the director works throughout the piece to add a personal element, taking the audience on a journey of discovery.\n\nBy the Ways (A Journey with William Eggleston) [CI]\n\nVincent Gérard and Cédric Laty\n\n90’ France 2005\n\nA journey with William Eggleston.

For the last 40 years, Eggleston photographs this arid land, which pretends to be making History. A visionary?\n\nThe photographer, playing his own role, skirts around the revelation of his character. In this way his persistent silence defies each truth revealed.

At 8pm, the news on every TV station present to the country what would become the famous “arrastão”: a massive crime, hundreds of black robbers sweep the beach in broad day light, in Portugal's National Day.

The code name for the police raid is “Operation Spring”, it was the largest police operation launched since 1945. In all, some 100 Africans were arrested. The media claimed that thanks to the help of the first “great bugging operation”, the authorities managed to arrest the bosses of an international Nigerian drug ring. In the years to follow what evolves out of this are the largest criminal proceedings directed against Africans in Austria. Almost everyone accused is eventually convicted. The total sentence amounts to several hundred years of imprisonment.

Until then, millions of local residents will have been relocated, because hundreds of towns and large areas of land will be under water – as well as countless natural monuments and historically important places in the Three Gorges area, including Fengjie, a town that gained fame as the hometown of Li Bai, one of the most important poets in Chinese history.

The rural districts of Lozère, Ardèche and Haute-Loire, located among the low-lying mountains at the center of France, are traditionally known for agriculture. Today however, spurred by the establishment of the European Union, the region's family farms are increasingly being converted into luxury country homes, while the country's agricultural industry has largely been monopolized by large conglomerates. The new young farmers who wish to settle down in these areas are continuously confronted with bureaucratic and financial hardships. In Profils Paysans: le Quotidien, Raymond Depardon pays tribute to the farming men and women who in the face of changing times persist in maintaining a way of life that would otherwise be forgotten.\n\n16h30, Small Auditorium\n\nTime Indefinite [RM]\n\nRoss McElwee\n\n114’ USA 1993\n\nTakes up where Sherman's March left off.

This work of art presented at São Paulo Biennal of Arts in 2004, was the first collaboration between the Portuguese artists Rui Chafes (sculptor) and Vera Mantero (choreographer and dancer). The result is a huge iron sculpture where the dancer performs a mysterious play, suspended in the air, with paintings all over her naked body. How did these artists work together, how did the idea develop, how was the installation at the Oscar Niemeyer pavillion in Brazil, how is to be in the backstage of such an event?\n\nSkin to Stone [P]\n\nPedro Sena Nunes\n\n40’ Portugal 2005\n\nThe green mountains tried to escape from the flames that scorched the earth. Through the thick air, a breeze led us to a new venture: to explore the Panasqueira Mines, abandoned fifteen years ago, and to set it within the life of the miner community. We came across a deserted village, watched over by one or two remaining inhabitants who followed in our footsteps. We went 450 metres down the dark pits to come closer to the miners. We heard stories and danced around with them. A new work came to life, one that sunk beneath the skin.\n\n21h00, Large Auditorium\n\nEmergency, Towns at Night [CI]\n\nPierre Maillis-Laval\n\n53’ France 2004\n\nThe medical emergency rescue teams fight to keep at all costs “the breath of life”.

Today, as the second Intifada is raging, the Palestinians are constantly humiliated by the Israeli army… Exhausted, these people voice their anger and despair – just as the Hebrews did with the Romans or Samson with the Philistines.

The film is based on the work of the most influential and controversial philosopher of the 20th century, Martin Heidegger, who swore allegiance to the National Socialists in 1933. By marrying a vast philosophical narrative with an epic voyage up Europe's greatest waterway, the film invites the viewer to unravel the extraordinary past and future of 'the West.'\n\n14h30, Small Auditorium\n\nThe Box [CI]\n\nEva Stefani\n\n11’ Greece 2004\n\nAn elderly woman falls in love with a television newscaster.

It's also the only place left for the forsaken inhabitants of the surrounding tower blocks to meet, a shelter where they can get together and exchange. By filming time going by, on their faces, on their destiny, this chronicle shows the importance of such a place, a small store in the middle of the project, where in spite of difficulties and poverty, people still share user-friendliness, laughter, human warmth.\n\n16h30, Small Auditorium\n\nMahaleo [SE]\n\nRaymond Rajaonarivelo, Cesar Paes and Marie-Clémence Paes\n\n98’ France/Madagascar 2005\n\nIn Malagasy, “Mahaleo” means free, independent. Mahaleo's voices and music have accompanied the people of Madagascar ever since the collapse of the colonial regime. Yet, even after 30 years of success, the group's seven musicians still keep their distance from the world of show-business, and remain deeply committed to helping their country's development; their professions range from surgeon to farmer, physician to sociologist and member of parliament. Accompanied by the group's rhythmic melodies, the film follows the singers through their daily lives, giving us a glimpse of the far-reaching social and economic problems of the Malagasy people.\n\n18h30, Large Auditorium\n\nWanting [P]\n\nCláudia Varejão\n\n20’ Portugal 2005\n\nIn the turbulence of the city life we sometimes forget or underestimate things that we want, absences that hold us, delay or even hurt us. In this documentary film, around one hundred inhabitants from the area of Lisbon are asked to write on a small blackboard what are they missing the most. There are answers from people of different social backgrounds, different ages, several activities that end up making an intimate portrait of the contemporary Portuguese society.\n\nBubbles - 40 Years in Pursuit of Everything [P]\n\nHelena Lopes and Paulo Nuno Lopes\n\n60’ Portugal 2005\n\nHelena and Paulo spent ten years asking people if they were happy. They interviewed American students at an elite university and Nepalese shepherds who said the earth was flat. They talked to Buddhist monks in pursuit of enlightenment in India, Portuguese women in the hinterland stuck to the mores of olden days, and fishermen who mocked destiny braving hazardous breakers on the country's northern coast. Then Paulo returned to the States to do a PhD on happiness. There they met four undergraduate students who made a point of reinventing life everyday, which made them think about what they had been doing all these years. So Paulo and Helena took a journey back in time and tried to rid themselves of all the wrong ideas life had taught them - in the pursuit of enlightenment, creativity and fun.\n\n21h00, Large Auditorium\n\nMoonshine [CI]\n\nEugen Schlegel, Sebastian Heinzel\n\n12’ Germany 2004\n\nSomewhere in a remote village in Belarus lives Babushka Vera.

They represent the final generation of a people after more than a thousand years of life in the village. For the moment, life goes on. Very soon, it will finally come to an end. The inhabitants and the painter Pello Azketa share something: things have begun to disappear befor their eyes. The director returns to her origins and witnesses this evaporation.\n\n23h00, Small Auditorium\n\nBroadway, Black Sea [R]\n\nVitali Manskij\n\n79’ Russia/Germany 2002\n\nRefugees from the Caucasian republics, Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Russians, meet on the shore of the Black Sea: they work as shop keepers, life guards, karaoke singers, or just enjoy their holidays. It all happens at a place called Broadway, which is no-where to be found on a map, not even the most detailed ones. The temporary inhabitants of Broadway construct a whole world en miniature, consisting of small carts, tents or booths parked in close, haphazard rows. The scenery, which is put up for a few weeks during the summer, bubbles with life – and in no way corresponds with ordinary daily life in Russia.\n\n[top]\n\nFriday 21\n\n11h00, Small Auditorium\n\n2 Eyes Open [CI]\n\nMateo Willis\n\n5’ United Kingdom 2005\n\nWhat really happens at a movie premier of a superstar. A crowd of people gather and jostle for position as they wait for the star and the spectacle gathers a cross-section of personalities into a whirlpool of watching. TV cameras are poised, security is on high alert and fans push for a better view. Almost unnoticed the star slips into view and quickly becomes the focus of a gaggling array of cameras, hands and screams. Everyone's attention is riveted. Or almost everyone. A body is dragged from the crowd, limp and ominous.\n\nAgbar [CI]\n\nVeronique Goel\n\n10’ Switzerland 2005\n\nThis is the story, in three parts, of the Agbar Tower designed by Jean Nouvel in Barcelona. This 144 meterhigh building, consisting of a circular glass and metal facade, was newly inaugurated. What better statement about such an oeuvre dominating the urban landscape than filming it to assess its impact? Véronique Goël's standpoint is radical and minimalist. She decides on four long fixed shots, which diminish its looming presence by merging it into the dense urban landscape.\n\nBullets in the Hood: a Bed-Stuy Story [CI]\n\nTerrence Fisher, Daniel Howard\n\n22’ USA 2004\n\nWhen young Stansbury was fatally shot by a Housing cop on the roof of a Brooklin Bed-Stuy apartment building, family and friends looked for ways to handle their grief. While some suggested, “the cops are expecting us to riot”, Stansbury's closest friend Terrence Fisher took a different view.

Emperor penguins in their thousands abandon the deep blue security of their ocean home and clamber onto the frozen ice to begin their long journey into a region so bleak, so extreme, it supports no other wildlife at this time of year. In single file, the penguins march blinded by blizzards, buffeted by gale force winds. Resolute, indomitable, driven by the overpowering urge to reproduce, to assure the survival of the species.\n\n14h30, Large Auditorium\n\nSergei Eisenstein: Autobiography [R]\n\nOleg Kovalov\n\n90’ Russia 1996\n\nThe film is dedicated to the centenary of filmmaking and the centenary of Sergei Eisenstein and is based on Eisenstein's memoirs. The plot of the film is a long voyage abroad, which Eisenstein started in 1929. We see transformed episodes from films of Eisenstein and his contemporaries, as well as rare archival shots of Eisenstein himself. We hear only Eisenstein's reminiscences, which are sometimes very personal. All this reflects the inner world of the great film director during the tragic years of two Russian revolutions and the Stalin terror. Events and personalities shown in the film underline the special place of Sergei Eisenstein in the culture of the 20th century.\n\n16h30, Small Auditorium\n\nSix O’Clock News [RM]\n\nRoss McElwee\n\n90’ USA 1996\n\nThe filmmaker drives across America obsessively recording with his VCR catastrophic stories from local television news in the various communities he visits.

Three years after that verdict had been passed, the President of Russia commuted the son’s death sentence to life imprisonment. Hope appeared for mother and son. Once a year the mother was permitted to visit the son in prison. But people grow old. The mother retired and her pension is now barely enough to live on. She scraped together all her saving and travelled to where her son was being held. For the last time...For the mother it is a second death sentence...On top of everything , a new law has been passed which means that the State too has deprived her of the chance to see her son again...\n\nLife in Peace [R]\n\nAntoine Cattin and Pavel Kostomarov\n\n45’ Russia 2004\n\nThe war has been going on in Chechnya since December 11th, 1994.

In an episodic journey from North to South five directors, from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, present their view and vision of nation, identity and Europe. By placing their personal cinematographic imprint on multifaceted portraits of their home countries, they open up a broad space for encounters with the strangers next door. A journey through landscapes and mentalities, and an area which is vanishing and at the same time undergoing a rebirth – a serious, absurd, magical, funny and poetic crash course on new old neighbours.\n\n18h30, Large Auditorium\n\nEavesdropping [P]\n\nConstantino Martins and Nuno Lisboa\n\n22’ Portugal 2005\n\nIn a telephone box in Portugal, Brazilian emigrants come to repeat the same gesture of connection between the two sides of the Atlantic.

This film tells the story of Russian avant-garde art after the revolution of 1917. It is an account of the fate of Nikolai Punin, the theoretician of the avant-garde, who for a long time was head of the department of the latest tendencies in the Russian Museum. It was due to his efforts that the works of avant-garde artists such as Kasimir Malevich, Pavel Filonov and Vladimir Tatlin survived Stalin's repressions in the storerooms of the museum.\n\nThe House on the Island [R]\n\nAlexander Krivonos\n\n26’ Russia 1995\n\nSt. Petersburg is located on forty two islands. One of the biggest is Vasilyevsky Island. Artists liked to lodge on this island long since. Any St Petersburg cityscape can be taken and framed. That is what makes it so easy for an artist to find a “good view” in St. Petersburg. But the tip or Spit of Vasilyevsky Island is a favourite place with artists. Three generations of St. Petersburg artist's family (Proshkiny) have reproduced St. Petersburg on their canvases over all those years – as if they were afraid that this city might disappear. They depicted the city, completed it by the power of their imagination…\n\n21h00, Large Auditorium\n\nBosnia Diaries [HE]\n\nJoaquim Sapinho\n\n82’ Portugal 2005\n\n“I went to Bosnia after the war ended, in 1996, when the Dayton Peace Accord was being implemented.

A subjective, autobiographical meditation on the allure of cigarettes and their troubling legacy for the state of North Carolina. It's about loss and preservation, addiction and denial. And it's about filmmaking - homemovie, documentary, and fiction filmmaking. “Bright Leaves” explores the notion of legacy – what one generation passes down to the next – and how this can be a particularly complicated topic when the legacy under discussion is a Southern one and is tied to tobacco.\n\n[top]\n\nSaturday 22\n\n14h30, Large Auditorium\n\nA Decent Factory [I]\n\nThomas Balmés\n\n79’ France 2004\n\nIs it possible to make profit and be ethical?

The film follows what happens when a puritan Nordic person with no historical experience of colonialism is facing the realities of globalisation through her own work.\n\n16h30, Large Auditorium\n\nThe Russell Tribunal [SE]\n\nStaffan Lamm\n\n10’ Sweden 2003\n\nStockholm, 1967. The Russell tribunal, with participants like Jean-Paul Sartre, investigates US war crimes in Vietnam. Victims of the war are called to witness. Today, from a distance of more than 35 years, the director reflects over his old footage from the tribunal, a material that has never been shown before.\n\nThe Burnt Theatre [SE]\n\nRithy Pahn\n\n85’ France 2005\n\nCambodia is a land of broken dreams. There is no more cinema, no more theatre, no more playhouses. The traditional performing arts are becoming extinct, wiped out by television. But there are still artists. Trustees of a tradition which they cannot hand down for lack of institutions, financial backing and places to perform, they are doomed to live in poverty or else perform ethnic entertainments for tourists. The idea at the heart of this film is to gather a group of actors around a project that exemplifies the reality we live in: something inside us – dignity, identity – is rotting to shreds. We are in the process of losing our memory.\n\n18h30, Small Auditorium\n\nAlone [R]\n\nDimitri Kabakov\n\n48’ Russia 1999\n\nEvery day, at the same time, an elderly lady with a hump and a cart boards the same train. She leaves the train at a far away station and starts her journey through the woods. Ana Diomina is as old as the Century. As we follow Ana Diomina through the icy streets, her story and that of 20th Century Russia unfold. They both share the history of loyalty and betrayal. A husband, officer in the Red Army, suddenly arrested during the times of Stalin, a fifteen year search for this man through the prison system; a brief encounter with the Tsarina as a small child in 1915; her own incarceration for four months in 1944 – these are only a few of the remarkable events which we discover as we travel though history with this woman so full of spiritual strength.\n\n18h30, Large Auditorium\n\nThe Three Rooms of Melancholia [SE]\n\nPirjo Honkasalo\n\n106’ Finland 2004\n\n“The 3 Rooms of Melancholia” depicts the vulnerability of a child's mind. The main characters of the film are the 9 to 14-years-old boys at Kronstadt Cadet Academy, a woman called Hadizhat Gataeva who saves the children from the ruins of Chechnya and the children living across the border in the Ingushetia refugee camp. The setting is the everlasting Chechen war.\n\n21h30, Grande Auditório\n\nGrizzly Man\n\n[Awards announcement: closing ceremony]\n\nWerner Herzog\n\n103’ USA 2005\n\n“Grizzly Man” explores the life and gruesome death of amateur grizzly bear expert and wildlife preservationist Timothy Treadwell. The film is a powerful cautionary tale about modern man's relationship to wild nature as it follows Treadwell's journeys to Alaska, where he lived among the grizzlies and grew to love them. Treadwell's crusade to defend the grizzlies tragically ended when he-and his girlfriend-were attacked and killed by a rogue grizzly in October 2003.\n\n[top]\n\nSunday 23\n\n16h30, Large Auditorium\n\nAWARDED MOVIES 1\n\n18h30, Large Auditorium\n\nAWARDED MOVIES 2\n\n21h00, Large Auditorium\n\nAWARDED MOVIES 3\n\n[top]\n\nEveryday, from 16 to 23 from 11h00 to 20h00, Galeria de exposições da Culturgest\n\nGallery 2\n\nContinuous Video projections, of works which complete two sections of the program and of a pedagogical initiative of “doclisboa 2005”, are being shown in 3 different rooms in the exhibition gallery of Culturgest.

People are walking along, by the seaside. The older people stop, look at the waves, then walk away. Nobody goes past now. All that remains is the sea and the waves breaking on the beach. Indistinct shapes on a beach in winter. A group of dogs. A love story. Ducks noisily cross the frame in one direction, then the other. A pond. Nighttime. Frogs. A chorus of sounds. Then, the storm. And finally, dawn.\n\n[top]\n\nParallel events\n\nWednesday 19\n\n11h00, Large Auditorium\n\nMasterclass with Alexander Krivonos [SE]\n\nAlexander Krivonos is the director of two movies presented in the post-Soviet Russian documentary section, The house on the island and Russian Avantgarde.
