        "text": "Matt Rize CBD was built on the belief everyone should have a right to high quality hemp-derived CBD products.\n\nJessi and Matt Rize have been making 20:1 CBD capsules for over 5 years. It has been their mission to provide the masses with safe and easy access to hemp-derived CBD products, education on cannabinoids, and unfiltered consumer testimonials.\n\nIn 1998, Matt Rize read about Prop. 215 opening the door for the medical industry, and that was it for him... By 2001, he drove from New Jersey to California, moving thousands of miles, leaving his friends, family, and home, to dedicate his life to changing standards and pushing for quality over quantity.\n\nMatt Rize's great grandparents grew hemp, the patriotic thing to do back then. His grandma grew weed for his grandpa when he had cancer. His mom grew weed for fun like a hippy. And he's been growing since 1998, including lessons from Mom and Grandma. It's a fam thing.\n\nA handful of years ago, @matt__rize got a message from an IG account (@jerrybucket) about a baby with cancer who needed help.\n\nHe never imagined it would become a full-length documentary called Waldo on Weed, which premiered in the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival and is now available to watch free with Amazon Prime.\n\nWe don’t want to give away the story, but will say it has a happy ending.\n\nCancer patients have a special place in Matt Rize's heart, which is why he started making CBD products in 2012. Still, he never imagined he would positively impact so many people’s lives....\n\nThank you for all the support."
