        "text": "The rise of the “spiritual but not religious” designation has led to a decline of millennial participation in mainline religious traditions with many questioning the relevance, mission, and overall purpose of organized religion in the 21st century.\n\nAccording to the 2015 Religious Landscape Survey by the Pew Research Center, American millennials born between the years 1981 and 1996 are less religious than older Americans. The study affirms that millennials are less likely to ascribe to traditional forms of religious observance, but remain religious in their own right. They are finding and creating new spaces to have different kinds of conversations that are not offered in traditional religious contexts.\n\nAbout gOD-Talk\n\ngOD-Talk is a groundbreaking project led by the Center for the Study of African American Religious Life in association with the Pew Research Center which seeks to:\n\nUncover how millennials interact with religion and the transformative nature of community, the internet, and space.\n\nAmplify leading millennial voices including activists, entertainers, entrepreneurs, athletes, academicians, religious leaders, and politicians by creating a space for their experiences to be shared and documented.\n\nCreate an opportunity for religious organizations and leaders, researchers, and engaged citizens to better understand the dynamic ways Black millennials engage with religion.\n\nBy using a lower case \"g\" for the word \"gOD' we are highlighting the ways in which this project will \"transgress\" traditional boundaries and literal designations of that which is considered scared.\n\ngOD-Talk: Reimaging Faith in the 21st century\n\ngOD-Talk is the culmination project of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History & Culture Center for the Study of African American Religious Life, in association with the Pew Research Center, five-year study of Black Millennials. The featured length film explores the lives of seven Black Millennials—Atheist, Buddhist, Christians, Muslim, Ifa, and Spiritualist—and the challenges and discoveries with faith and spirituality.\n\nAccording to the 2021 “Faith Among Black Americans Survey” conducted by the Pew Research Center, American millennials—persons born between the years 1981 and 1996—are less religious than older Americans. While millennials are less likely to ascribe to traditional forms of religious observance, the study maintains that they remain religious, nonetheless. With the rise of the “spiritual but not religious” designation has come the overall decline of participation in mainline religious traditions for Americans. While the decline in Black religious communities has not been as drastic as White communities, there are still lingering questions concerning the relevance, mission, and overall purpose of organized religion in the 21st century for Black American Millennials.\n\nFrom issues pertaining to gender and sexuality, abuse and trauma, hip-hop culture and music, gentrification, race and racism, patriarchy, and more, the film explores a rising phenomenon of religious and spiritual shifts among the largest generation and one of the most influential demographics in the U.S, Black Millennials.\n\ngOD-Talk Documentary Film Tour\n\nJan. 20, 2 p.m. - 5 p.m.: Winston-Salem, NC\n\nWake Forest School of Divinity, Triad Cultural Arts, Forsyth County Public Library and 1LOVE Festival screening, reception and talk-back\n\nTickets\n\nJan. 26, 4:30 p.m. - 9 p.m.: Cleveland, OH\n\nCase Western University and East Mt.
