        "text": "If the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police officers has taught this nation one thing, it's that it's not enough to not be racist right now; it's important to be anti-racist. And in addition to protesting, donating, and contacting politicians, American citizens can also do the work by educating themselves. A simple place to start? Pressing play. Movies, documentaries, and TV series about Black lives in the United States can be a crucial tool for understanding this country's racist foundationâ€”and its pervasive effect on society, culture, economy, the criminal justice system, and beyond.\n\nTo help, we've gathered 18 of the best movies, documentaries, and TV shows relevant to the Black Live Matters movement, all currently streaming on Netflix, Hulu, and beyond. This is a moment in which personal commitment can make palpable change, and you can start here."
