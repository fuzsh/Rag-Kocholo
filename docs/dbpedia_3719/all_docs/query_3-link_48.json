        "text": "This film is called Mad Hot Ballroom it is a fun-filled movie because there are lots of commotion going on, people from other schools are competing and it was like an emotional roller-coaster. Numerous schools attend the dance competition in New York. They have to do the CHA CHA, MERENGUE, SWING, RUMBA and many other Spanish dances. They battle each other in order to win the competition and take home the ultimate trophy. Mad Hot Ballroom does not only concentrate on the dance but also on the students personal lives. The adults are also as passionate as the schoolchildren. So it is school-wide. I think that the movie is a great movie to watch with a family. I think people will enjoy this film. I really enjoyed it!!!!!!!!\n\nPrint this review"
