It’s not enough to be non-racist – true allies of the Black Lives Matter movement must be anti-racist. This means calling out racism at every level, engaging in political action and educating ourselves on Black history, to better understand the fight that Black activists have been battling for centuries.\n\nThere is no excuse not to take these steps, and with an abundance of free time granted to many of us due to the coronavirus pandemic lockdown, there’s never been a more appropriate time to sit down and put the work in.\n\nThis is not to say that the work has to be gruelling – in fact, with the resources available to us online, the experience can be as eye-opening as it is enjoyable.\n\nFilm fanatic Amar Sall has taken this one step further, by curating a list of 100 films, television shows and documentaries easily accessible online directed by and/or starring Black faces telling Black stories.\n\nHe says, “This watchlist consists of content that I have been discovering and watching that I believe are worth sharing. I know I won’t be able to cover every voice, but just being able to raise awareness of the significance and breadth of work done by Black storytellers is the goal, and to share this resource with others.”\n\nHe continues, “I strive to continue to educate myself through the lens of Black filmmaking, there is still so much more to be seen and heard and this is by no means a finished list. Let’s help share these stories.”\n\nThe following list contains content that can be easily located with a quick internet search. They can also be found on some of the more mainstream and speciality streaming sites including: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, MUBI, BFI Player, Hulu, BBC iPlayer and the Criterion Collection/Channel.\n\nRead Amar’s list below, or click here to see his full document.\n\n12 Years a Slave\n\nThis harrowing biographical period-drama directed by Steve McQueen is an adaptation of the 1853 slave memoir of the same name by Solomon Northup.
