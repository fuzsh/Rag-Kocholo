        "text": "Before the beginning of Rize, David LaChappelle's nonfiction document of South central street dancing, a title card appears to inform the audience that none of the footage that follows was sped up. When I read this, I laughed off the admonition, thinking it was for rubes and otherwise uninitiated viewers who weren't familiar with the ins and outs of hip-hop moves.\n\nBut when the film ended, I honestly found myself questioning whether LaChappelle kept to his word and presented his subjects in the same lethargic 24 frames per second that Batman wipes out a phalanx of foot soldiers or George Romero's zombies inevitably consume all life in their path. And that, if nothing else, is the reason the documentary is one of the best pictures of 2005. That said, however, there are a host of other reasons - including reason itself - that Rize triumphs long after the last dance has ended.\n\nLaChappelle is one of the most successful photographers and music video directors in the world, and prior to this film would rank high on my list of success stories most in need of rank failure. But Rize is a triumph from every angle: capturing the lives of several groups of inner city youths as they exercise their creativity, avoid the trappings of crime and street violence, and literally invent a new art form, LaChappelle has accomplished a rare feat in the world of film - namely, to presage in a very real way the development a vital new art form.\n\nOpening with the colored (no pun intended) history of South Central Los Angeles, which played host to the Watts riots in the 1965 and the Rodney King riots in 1992, LaChappelle gives a brief history of the area before squaring his camera on Tommy the Clown, the man responsible for giving a name to this unconventional and unprecedented new form of dance. Juxtaposed against footage of the fast and furious moves of his disciples and descendants, Tommy explains that the dancing began after the King riots, almost by accident, and quickly developed into several splinter art forms, including the more-or-less self-explanatory 'stripper dance,' and then later, 'clowning' and 'krumping,' the latest iterations of this untapped artistic expression.\n\nThe film features an abundance of dance footage, which in a fictional context or without benefit of cultural background would feel excessive. But LaChappelle's celebratory approach to the material, which follows several groups of dancers as they reveal their philosophical manifestos, relishes the social and political underpinnings that make their movements not mere choreographic wonders, but almost unwitting expressions of rage, frustration and liberation.\n\nThe dancing adopts proportions larger than the set of circumstances from which it came- and which will no doubt be shared by many of the film's most dedicated audiences- and achieves a certain, human poetry; viewers will find themselves not just bouncing to the beats of the music, but vibrating with excitement at the prospect that these people endured some of the worst conditions available in America and triumphed, resoundingly, to significant personal and professional success.\n\nThere have been other films about dancing, about competitions and about defeating seemingly insurmountable odds. But the key difference between that film and Rize is that there are no tangible victories for LaChappelle's subjects. The film doesn't culminate in a cathartic victory that validates their efforts, but witnesses the transcendence of these individuals over the adversity of their upbringing and a much more ambiguous triumph over the destructive pressures of their environment.\n\nUltimately, the purpose of LaChappelle's documentary is to capture the physical prospect, much less the cultural concept of moving faster than is conventionally expected; but as a movie, Rize is designed to decelerate the action to a discernible pace. The dancers featured in the film have been seen as 'slow', in one way or another, for their entire lives - even by themselves - and it's a triumphant realization for them as well as us that they can achieve more than the sum of their adverse experiences would traditionally presuppose. And that's because this is the first dance documentary I can remember that spends less time explaining how the subjects make their magical moves, and instead focuses on a far more important question- namely why they do.\n\nScore: 9 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nShot on digital video, Rize is presented in a full frame (1.33:1) format preserving the original theatrical aspect ratio. With the exception of a few sequences in which director LaChapelle employs filters and other lighting techniques to create different moods, most of the material is pretty raw - which means that occasional over- and under-saturation occurs due to natural lighting sources. The disc preserves this perfectly, which is a good thing - I've always argued the DV docs alway look better on the small screen and this one is no exception.\n\nThat said, viewers with widescreen televisions be warned: the disc is not anamorphic, evidently intentionally, so you're going to have that \"vertical letterboxing\" problem. But better that than to lose any of the remarkable, vibrant action on screen.\n\nScore: 9 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nThe Rize DVD offers two audio options: English Dolby Digital 5.1 and English 2.0 Surround Sound. If you need a disc that will give your subwoofer a workout, look no further: the bottom end of this audio mix, mostly manufactured via the movie's soundtrack, bumps as violently as the dancers krump. This, however, is a good thing because an essential part of the participants' dancing experience is audience involvement, and you'll be hard-pressed not to start shaking along once the soundtrack, filled with songs like Dizzee Rascal's \"Fix Up, Look Sharp\" start their military-cadences rhythms.\n\nMeanwhile dialogue is virtually the only other sound that demands any attention, and it is well-reproduced in your center channel, ensuring that you not only can hear the music that they dance to, but the words that inspire tham as well.\n\nAdditionally, English and Spanish subtitles are available for the hearing impaired.\n\nScore: 9 out of 10\n\nExtras and Packaging\n\nRize comes packaged in a standard Amray case featuring a paper insert and cardboard slipcase which duplicate plot details, bonus content and technical information.\n\nThe single-disc release features the following extras:\n\nDVD introduction with cast and director David LaChapelle\n\nCommentary by director\n\nFilmmaking insight with director and director of photography\n\nNew dancer interviews with the director\n\nTribeca Film Festival Q&A with the cast\n\nDavid LaChapelle photo gallery\n\nDance moves\n\nExtended dances\n\nDeleted scenes\n\nTrailers\n\nIf you are a diehard fan either of this film or krumping, this disc is a treasure trove; after all, these aren't mere performers of the fledgling dance but its inventors. That said, much of this material is at least somewhat superfluous, starting with the introduction, which sounds like an acceptance speech at the Grammys where each member of a band takes time to thank God, Allah, their lawyer and of course the fans for supportiung them through all of the tough times on the road to success. In other words skip this.\n\nThe \"filmmaking insight\" portion reiterates material that LaChapelle addresses in the audio commentary, including his depiction of their low-budget shooting style, and offers some advice for aspiring filmmakers (this includes chestnuts like \"don't worry about lighting, just go for a feeling\"). At the same time, because of the explosion of DV filmmakers in recent years this information may be valuable, albeit only to folks hoping to make their own \"Rize\" to success (har, har).\n\nIn addition to these descriptions of the filmmaking process, LaChapelle does a great job illustrating the differences between himself and his subjects in the rest of the commentary track - not merely by detailing his own initial experiences meeting and interviewing each of them, but via recollections about scenes he shot and other incidents he witnessed in their community. He also provides some understated cultural commentary in this material about the enforced economic divisions in Los Angeles and the social conditions in which this dance movement not only became their artistic outlet, but their reaction to the poverty and adversity witnessed on a daily basis.\n\nThe dance footage, meanwhile, is still terrific, and in expanded form offers additional, breathtaking images for the audience to watch. The \"dance moves\" sequences, however, are almost instructional in their description and deconstruction of individual moves, which quite honestly seem no more physically feasible after they've been broken down. But if you're inspired to try \"krumping\" yourself after watching the movie, this is probably the best place to start.\n\nOtherwise, the deleted scenes are mostly extraneous material shot but wisely excised from the final film. These scenes include a full rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" (partially captured in the film), as well as a few sequences in which Dragon buys different kinds of cheese to make lasagna. But for a single-disc DVD (which one expects will be the only one ever released), this is a terrifically well-assembled disc.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10"
