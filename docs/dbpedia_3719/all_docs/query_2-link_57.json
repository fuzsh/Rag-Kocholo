Learn from a Local Black Historian or Speaker\n\nMaybe your company’s budget doesn’t allow you to hire a renowned author like Ibram X. Kendi to speak to your team. But, your company could hire a local historian to talk about how African Americans have impacted the history and culture of your surroundings. Similarly, you could virtually host a Black author to speak about their work.\n\nBe sure to plan enough time for a Q&A session and even an internal debrief so your team has an opportunity to start a dialogue and learn more.\n\nTo get started, search Penguin Random House’s directory of Black History Month Speakers.\n\n5. Explore Your Local Black History Museum\n\nGive your team the nostalgic feeling of a social studies or history field trip – with a virtual visit to a museum!\n\nThe AAAM (Association of African American Museums) maintains a directory of museums devoted to African American history throughout the U.S. Find one near you and explore their virtual tours and lectures with your team. You’ll learn something new while taking a fun virtual field trip together.\n\nOr, take a look at the virtual programming offered by the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture.\n\nExplore the Association of African American Museums directory for more ideas.\n\n6. Support a Black-Owned Food Delivery Company For Your Employees\n\nFor teams in Atlanta, Baltimore, Detroit, and Philadelphia, try out Black and Mobile, the first Black-owned food delivery service in the country to exclusively deliver for Black-owned restaurants.\n\nYou can order food for your employees directly, or give them a gift card so they can enjoy a delicious meal during their down time. For Black History Month celebration ideas like this one, start an email or Slack thread for everyone to share which restaurant and dish they chose!\n\nBuy a Black and Mobile gift card here.\n\n7. Treat Employees to Lunch from a Black-Owned Restaurant\n\nReward your employees for their hard work while also supporting a local Black-owned restaurant. As a bonus, you may just introduce your team to their new favorite lunch spot. If your team is working remotely or spread across geographic areas, you can order delivery to each person’s home or offer a gift card.\n\nAlternatively, you could host a physically distant lunch pick-up at the office. Or, you could even plan a company picnic for everyone to enjoy their food together outdoors. Visit eatblackowned.com to find a restaurant near you.\n\n8. Plan a Virtual Watch Party with Your Team\n\nVirtual watch parties are easier than ever to plan.

Volunteer With a Black-Led Nonprofit\n\nVolunteering with your team is a great way to boost employee engagement while supporting a worthy cause. And, it’s easier than you might think to find a Black-led nonprofit that aligns with your employees’ interests.\n\nFor instance, organizations like Black Girls Code and 100 Black Men of America engage volunteers and mentors across the United States through in-person and virtual service.\n\nTo gain company wide buy-in from your employees, ask them to share their favorite Black-led or social justice nonprofits. Then, encourage your employees to spend a designated amount of work time volunteering with one of these causes during Black History Month. Moreover, you can plan a group volunteer day to turn this into a team building activity.\n\nCheck out this CharityNavigator list of Black-founded charities uplifting the Black community to get started.\n\n11. Share Black History Moments & Milestones\n\nAfrican American leaders, thinkers, and inventors have made incredible impacts on all of our personal lives. As a result, there are no shortage of Black historical figures to learn about and celebrate.\n\nThis year, ask your employees to take turns sharing one important Black history moment each day during the month of February on Slack or via email. For sports fans, that might be Hank Aaron becoming the all-time home run king. On the other hand, a tech junkie might choose to share about Philip Emeagwali’s invention of the world’s first supercomputer. This is a great Black History Month corporate idea because it gets everyone engaged in a simple way.\n\nLearn more from The Oprah Magazine’s list of 15 influential African American inventors to remember this Black History Month and beyond.\n\n12. Play Black History Month Trivia\n\nWith this activity, you can help your team learn more about Black history in a fun, exciting way. To play, prepare your list of trivia questions and answers. To keep everyone engaged, include questions on a variety of topics. For example: technology, sports, literature, film, music, art, comic books, and more.\n\nBe sure to pause your game along the way for further discussion and learning. Remember, the goal is to connect and grow together, not fly through all the questions quickly. To add more fun, consider awarding the winners with a gift card to a local Black-owned business.\n\nGet inspiration from this list of 20 Black History Month trivia questions.\n\n13. Amplify Black Voices\n\nUse your company’s social media channels, e-newsletter, and other communications to promote the words and ideas of Black thinkers. This can be as simple as searching for, following, and sharing (with credit!) the social media posts of Black experts in your industry.\n\nWhile you’re at it, take a look at which accounts you’re following on your own personal social media feed. Remember to make an effort to diversify your own news feed as well. Consider following accounts that represent a variety of races, sexual orientations, gender identities, ages, abilities, and walks of life.\n\n14. Sponsor a Local Black-Led Festival in Your City\n\nSponsoring a local Black-led event is a win-win. That’s because your company will likely receive publicity in your community while also supporting a worthy cause.\n\nTake a look at your town’s 2024 events calendar for events like Taste of Soul in Atlanta, the American Black Film Festival in Miami Beach, and the Black Arts Festival in Milwaukee.\n\nStart by searching for your city on Soul of America’s National Calendar of Events. While 2024 dates are forthcoming at the time of publication, keep an eye on this calendar for updates!\n\n15. Support Black Employees’ Energy, Boundaries, and Privacy\n\nDuring Black History Month, some workplaces want to do something special to recognize or support their Black employees. For example, you may see companies highlighting the work and achievements of Black employees in social media posts or other materials. However, this can create a situation where employees feel singled out or tokenized.\n\nInstead, respect employees’ privacy by focusing on the collective learning and impact your entire team can make, rather than singling out individuals based on their race.\n\nAdditionally, if you are forming a diversity committee or Black History Month Committee, make sure that participation is by choice and that time spent on these activities are on-the-clock. In other words, avoid asking employees to contribute unpaid time and energy toward equity focused initiatives.\n\n16. Begin a Virtual Book Club\n\nBook clubs are notorious for fizzling out after the initial excitement has worn off – but when done right, they can provide an enriching, meaningful, and fun experience for your employees.\n\nConsider skipping the ongoing commitment and instead host a one-time Virtual Book Club for Black History Month. For virtual ideas like this, employees who are interested can gather virtually to chat about their takeaways, learn from each other, and relax with favorite snacks or libations.\n\nGet started with this list of popular Black History Month books from Goodreads.\n\n17. Celebrate African Americans and the Arts\n\nEach year, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) designates a theme for Black History Month. For 2024, the theme is “African Americans and the Arts.”\n\nASALH shares, “In the fields of visual and performing arts, literature, fashion, folklore, language, film, music, architecture, culinary and other forms of cultural expression, the African American influence has been paramount. African American artists have used art to preserve history and community memory as well as for empowerment.”\n\nLearn more about this year’s theme of African Americans and the Arts here. Engaging ways to celebrate this theme: book a unique virtual program that celebrates Black artists’ influence on Street Art and Music throughout history.\n\n18. Listen to the 1619 Podcast\n\nCreated by The New York Times, “1619” is an audio series that explores “how slavery has transformed America, connecting past and present through the oldest form of storytelling. While the series is now a few years old, it’s still a timely and compelling listen.\n\nIf a book club (idea #16 above) feels too time consuming for your team, try a podcast club instead! Since many people enjoy listening to a podcast while multitasking, this can help allow more employees to participate in your DEI activities.\n\nListen to the The New York Times’ 1619 Podcast here.\n\n19. Pay Dues for African-American Professional Organizations\n\nThere are Black and African American affiliation groups for just about every industry. For example, there’s the American Association of Blacks in Energy, Blacks in Technology, ColorComm (for women of color in Communications), National Association of Black Accountants, and many others.\n\nThis February, consider allocating funds toward your employees’ dues in these and other professional associations and sharing the news with your team. Investing in your people is a tangible way to show your commitment to your team. Plus, you’ll be investing in worthwhile organizations that help employees learn and grow while cultivating the next generation of talent.\n\nExplore a list of African American professional organizations from Monster.com.\n\n20. Engage with and Promote Black Heritage on Social Media\n\nAs you take meaningful action to honor Black History Month, this is also a great time to share about the occasion on your company’s external communications. You can utilize your business’s e-newsletters, social media posts, website, and other materials to celebrate important occasions.\n\nWhat to share on social media about Black History Month:\n\nPost quotes from inspirational leaders (see idea #27 below)\n\nPromote Black-owned businesses and restaurants you’ve enjoyed purchasing from\n\nEducate audiences with Black History Month facts and trivia\n\nInform followers about Black-led nonprofits your company supports\n\nShare what internal actions your company is taking to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion\n\nGet started with this list of 35 Impactful Black Creators to Follow on Social Media by social media management software company Later.\n\n21. Learn About Local Black History\n\nThis Black History Month, spend time learning about Black history in your company’s area. For instance, are there any Black leaders in the Civil Rights movement who grew up in your area? Does your community have a history of redlining to disenfranchise Black voters? Are there Historically Black Colleges & Universities in your area that your company could become involved with or recruit from?\n\nIf your team is spread across the globe, turn this into a collaborative activity by asking everyone to share what they learned about their own geographic area.\n\nIt’s important to note that delving into this history can be a sobering and even triggering experience. Consider bringing in an external expert or DEI consultant to help guide the conversation (see idea #30 below).\n\n22. Host a Virtual Lunch & Learn Series\n\nEach week during Black History Month, consider hosting a Lunch & Learn session for your employees to delve deeper into Black History. You can choose a discussion topic for each week ahead of time and ask everyone to come prepared with one or two facts to share with the group.\n\nSome Black History Month lunch & learn topics could include:\n\nBlack history in outer space exploration\n\nHow Southern American food was shaped by Black history\n\nThe art and culture of The Harlem Renaissance\n\nRecord-breaking Black athletes in history\n\nBlack inventors and ingenuity\n\n23. Host a Virtual Poetry Reading Featuring Work from Black Authors\n\nSet aside some time for a thought-provoking and engaging session with your team: a poetry reading.
