        "text": "Juneteenth celebrates the end of slavery in America. It is also an opportunity to reflect on the history and contributions of African Americans. Learning about the struggles and triumphs of Black Americans can help put the holiday in context. Movies can be an engaging and educational way for children to learn more while also building empathy and understanding. Here are some movies to get you started.\n\nHidden Figures (2016)\n\nThis inspiring film tells the true story of three African American women mathematicians—Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson—who worked at NASA and played crucial roles in the early years of the U.S. space program. Hidden Figures not only highlights the brilliance and perseverance of these women but also addresses themes of overcoming racial and gender barriers. It’s a powerful way for kids to see how determination and intelligence can change the world.\n\nSelma (2014)\n\nThis historical drama depicts the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders. While Selma is best suited for older children due to its intense themes, it provides a compelling look at the civil rights movement and the fight for voting rights. It’s a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made for equality.\n\n13th (2016)\n\nDirected by Ava DuVernay, this documentary explores the history of racial inequality in the United States, particularly focusing on the nation’s prisons and the criminalization of African Americans. 13th is suitable for older children and teens (and a must-see for adults). It provides a thorough and impactful examination of systemic racism and its roots in American history. The film encourages critical thinking about justice and equality.\n\nRoots (1977)\n\nThis groundbreaking miniseries follows several generations of an African American family, beginning with Kunta Kinte’s enslavement and tracing their struggles and triumphs over the decades. Roots is a comprehensive and deeply personal look at African American history from the time of slavery onwards. It’s a powerful narrative that can help kids understand the long-lasting impact of slavery.\n\nHarriet (2019)\n\nThis biographical film chronicles the life of Harriet Tubman and her incredible journey from escaping slavery to becoming a leading abolitionist who helped free many others via the Underground Railroad. Harriet is an inspirational story of courage, bravery, and the fight for freedom. It’s a great way for kids to learn about one of America’s greatest heroes.\n\nWatching these movies can be a meaningful way for children to learn about the history and significance of the African American experience while helping to create a foundation for understanding that can lead to deeper discussion and understanding. You may wish to use these films as a starting point for important conversations and reflections this Juneteenth and throughout the year.\n\nMore Resources:\n\nLearn some tips for talking to your kids about Juneteenth.\n\nExplore more recommended reading about Black history for kids.\n\nLearn more about Black American History with our Read and Watch List for Adults"
