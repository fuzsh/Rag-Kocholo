        "text": "In 2020, the country faced another serious reckoning of racial and economic disparity, and despite what any given day’s trending topics may be, it’s a reckoning that’s here to stay. Today is the perfect time to stay on track when it comes to expanding your knowledge and educating yourself. Black history is American history and should be important to all races.\n\nThankfully, there’s a huge selection of documentaries that delve into Black history and tell necessary, often overlooked stories. Whether you want to learn about the origins of the school-to-prison pipeline, the stories behind well-known Black athletes and artists, the impact of colorism and racist legislation, or other topics that detail the experiences many in Black America face, there’s likely a documentary for you.\n\nAnd the best part? Most of them are available on accessible streaming platforms like Netflix and YouTube. Here’s a list of 30 Black history documentaries that can both educate and remind you how we got here.\n\nIs That Black Enough For You?!? (2022)\n\nPart documentary/part personal essay, this movie from film critic and Harvard lecturer Elvis Mitchell dives into the world of cinema and how the contributions of African Americans are often overlooked (an glaring problem since the very start of the movie industry). It includes the perspectives of mega Hollywood stars like Zendaya, Samuel L. Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, and Laurence Fishburne.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nSoul of a Nation Presents: Screen Queens Rising (2022)\n\nAnother great doc for cinema lovers to watch, this new release explores how Black actresses were long overlooked in Hollywood and the advancements they've made in recent years to become some of the most sought-after talent in America. It's hosted by ABC News journalists Linsey Davis and Deborah Roberts, so you're guaranteed top-notch reporting.\n\nSummer of Soul (2021)\n\nThis doc from musician Questlove (his directorial debut!) showcases the Harlem Cultural Festival that took place in the summer of 1969, just 100 miles south of Woodstock, and takes a look at its music as part of the historical record. Plus you'll get to see performances by amazing Black artists like Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, and Sly & the Family Stone. Once you watch it, you'll understand why it immediately won awards when it premiered at Sundance.\n\nBlack Panthers (1968)\n\nThis short doc might be 55 years old, but it's as important as ever. It's about a protest held by the Black Panther Party (which, if you're somehow not familiar, was formed with the goal of challenging misconduct and excessive force used by the Oakland Police Department). At the protest, they advocated for the freedom of Huey P. Newton, one of the party's founders who was convicted of manslaughter following the death of a police officer. It touches on deeply complex systemic issues that are unfortunately still relevant today.\n\nMarian Anderson: The Whole World in Her Hands (2022)\n\nWe should all really be talking about Marian Anderson. The singer not only broke past tons of barriers in her career (she was the first Black woman to perform at the Metropolitan Opera), but she also spent much of her life advocating for civil rights. She worked as a delegate to the U.N., was a Goodwill Ambassador for the U.S. Department of State, and sang at the original March on Washington. Bonus: she also earned a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award AND was given the first-ever Presidential Medal of Freedom. Talk about an impressive resume!\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nBillie (2019)\n\nBillie Holiday is one of the most iconic American musicians, having massive influence over the evolution of both jazz and pop. This documentary focuses on a series of audio-recorded interviews from the '70s that were meant to be used for a book on Holiday that was sadly never completed after the author died in 1978. The interviews are with the singer's friends, family, and major musicians like Count Basie and Sylvia Syms.\n\nLet The World See (2022)\n\nThis is a three-part docuseries, so you'll want to clear some time in your schedule, but let me tell ya, it's worth it. It tells the story of the powerful Mamie Till-Mobley, a Chicago mother who became an influential activist and public speaker after her 14-year-old son, Emmett Till, was murdered by two brothers after a white woman accused him of whistling at her.\n\nSlavery by Another Name (2012)\n\nSome Americans still believe slavery ended with the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation, but this documentary challenges that view by delving into the stories of thousands of African Americans who were pulled back into forced labor after the fact. It’s an eye-opening watch that spotlights some of the many ways slavery continued for decades after its alleged “abolition.”\n\nL.A. 92 (2017)\n\nTwenty-five years after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, this National Geographic documentary dug into the upheaval that came after a jury acquitted four LAPD officers charged in the beating of Rodney King. It uses rarely seen archival footage to tell the story of the brutal attack, trial, and the several-days-long riots that followed. It includes statements from President George H. W. Bush, then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton, two of the acquitted officers, and of course King himself.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nThe Trials of Muhammad Ali (2013)\n\nMuhammad Ali is one of the greatest boxers of all time, but there’s much more to his story than that. This documentary explores parts of his life outside the boxing ring, including how Ali’s refusal to serve in the Vietnam War because of his religious beliefs left him looking at a five-year prison sentence and ended with a boxing ban and his titles stripped away.\n\nWho Killed Malcolm X? (2020)\n\nIn 1965, Muslim minister and human rights activist Malcolm X was assassinated as he was preparing to address the Organization of Afro-American Unity in New York City. Two men were arrested and convicted with the murder, but this docuseries digs into the unknown elements around Malcolm X’s murder. In fact, it did so much digging that the release of the series prompted a new review of the poorly handled case and eventually led to the exoneration of the two men.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nWhat Happened, Miss Simone? (2015)\n\nNina Simone was not only a legendary singer but also a powerful civil rights activist. This documentary takes you through her life from a rising singing talent to how she took issue with racial injustices in her music to when she moved to Liberia after the music industry punished her for using her voice. You’ll get to see previously unreleased footage of Simone as well as interviews with her family and friends.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nMore Than a Month (2012)\n\nIn this documentary, filmmaker Shukree Hassan Tilghman asks the question: Is it time to end Black History Month? He travels all around the country to speak with people and get their views while humorously exploring the history of the month. Not only is it the shortest and coldest month of the year but, as Tilghman gets into, designating one singular month for Black history risks separating it from American history as a whole.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nHigh on the Hog: How African American Cuisine Transformed America (2021)\n\nFood writer Stephen Satterfield hosts this four-episode Netflix miniseries, which is based on the book by renowned cookbook author and historian Jessica B. Harris. Satterfield unpacks the layered history of how America’s most beloved dishes—from cornbread and okra to baked mac and cheese—stem from Black culture. He highlights and credits the historical figures who introduced these meals and then dives into some of the techniques that make the foods what we know and love today.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nGood Hair (2009)\n\nThis documentary examines the beauty of Black hair. Comedian Chris Rock leads the film, starting off with trying to answer his daughter’s heartbreaking question: “Daddy, why don’t I have good hair?” Chris investigates the full gamut of Black hair, how it impacts daily life, and the booming industry it created. From visiting local hair salons and epic hair shows to traveling to India to see the origins of the weave business, the comedian explores serious themes with humor, empathy, and relatability. Celebrities like Kerry Washington, Raven Symoné, and the late Maya Angelou also share personal stories in interviews.\n\nThe Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 (2011)\n\nIf you watch only one film from this list, make it this one (but please, watch more). Shot during the ’60s and ’70s, this Sundance Film Festival winner is the brainchild of Swedish filmmakers who came to the United States to capture the anti-war and Black Power movement, which was being mischaracterized as a terrorist wave by white leaders. The footage sat for nearly 30 years before being compiled into this documentary about the Black culture and style that ignited social change in an oppressive landscape. A plethora of contemporary interviews from notable Black artists, historians, and activists accompany the original footage.\n\nHomecoming: A Film by Beyoncé (2019)\n\nOkay, so this one isn’t historical per se, but hear us out. Queen Bey used her 2018 Coachella (ahem, Beychella) headline set to expose a mostly-white audience to the exhilarating beauty, jubilation, and complete wonder that is the HBCU homecoming experience. From the marching band, to the majorette dancers and their uniforms, to the nod to Black Greek life and stepping, Beyoncé took viewers all the way to school—all while making her Black fanbase feel seen, celebrated, and honored. The film is very much a documentary, interlacing the historic performance (Bey was the first Black woman to ever headline Coachella) with compelling behind-the-scenes footage of the prep it took to make the show the glory that it was, as well as intimate personal details around Beyonce’s often private life.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nThey’ve Gotta Have Us (2018)\n\nDive into the history of Black Hollywood and how Hollywood was influenced by Black artists, both in front of and behind the lens. This three-episode docuseries features iconic Black entertainers of the past and present, from Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier (who was the first Black man to win the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1964 and recently passed away in 2022) to Whoopi Goldberg, Debbie Allen, Ruth E. Carter, and John Boyega. They share moving stories of trailblazing, passing the torch, and taking their space in an often unwelcoming industry.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nThe Loving Story (2011)\n\nThe story of Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple in Virginia who traveled to D.C. to get married only to face a massive legal battle and jail time when they returned home, was a romance that had widespread impact. The American Civil Liberties Union took on the Lovings' case, and it went all the way to the Supreme Court. Their victory marked a turning point, and 16 states overturned bans on interracial marriage in response—all because of one sweet, unassuming couple. (If you want a fictional take on this story instead, check out Loving (2016) starring Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton.)\n\nI Am Not Your Negro (2018)\n\nInterest in Raoul Peck’s Oscar-nominated documentary that explores James Baldwin’s unfinished work definitely spiked in June 2020. But that just goes to show how Baldwin’s words and how he remembers figures from the Civil Rights Movement (including Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Medgar Evers) are very important. This documentary underlines the connection between the Civil Rights Movement and Black Lives Matter.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nEthnic Notions (1987)\n\nYou’ll need a library card to stream this documentary, but it’s absolutely worth it. Marlon Riggs’s Ethnic Notions tracks the history of anti-Black stereotypes in popular culture, particularly in cartoons, and how these harmful depictions have evolved from the antebellum period through the 1980s. We’ve all been shown coded racist imagery since birth, and we still see variations in film and TV tropes today. If you’ve ever been told that a popular film is racist and you didn’t think it was a big deal, this is the doc for you.\n\nFreedom Riders (2010)\n\nIf you need proof that protests work and young people can make a difference, look no further than the story of the Freedom Riders, who pushed back against Jim Crow laws in the American South in 1961. This group of hundreds of activists included the late Representative John Lewis and brought an unprecedented amount of attention to segregation and troubles on the homefront at a time when national attention had turned overseas.\n\n13th (2016)\n\nThe 13th amendment legally ended slavery in the United States back in 1865, and Netflix’s 13th, named after that amendment, delves into why slavery never really ended and was essentially just replaced with mass incarceration. Directed by filmmaker Ava DuVernay, the film puts the country’s history of racial inequality on full display through the lens of the nation’s prisons, which are disproportionately filled with Black Americans.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nDark Girls (2011)\n\nDark Girls explores the biases against those with darker Black skin tones. This doc, which was nominated for a 2011 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Documentary, is filled with interviews from children, award-winning actresses, and Black female comedians who have experienced this bias firsthand. An equally powerful follow-up documentary, Dark Girls 2, goes even deeper on the prejudices that dark-skinned women face culturally and globally.\n\nWhen They See Us (2019)\n\nOkay, this technically falls more into the “biopic” category because it’s a fictionalization of real events, but we’re putting it here anyway. Another Ava DuVernay creation, this Netflix series illustrates the story of the Exonerated Five—formerly known as the Central Park Five—both artfully and powerfully. This four-part limited series tells the story of how the five men, four whom are Black and one whom is Latino, were falsely accused of and prosecuted for raping and assaulting a woman in Central Park. The series serves as a reminder of how badly the justice system has failed people of color (and continues to do so).\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nFaubourg Tremé: The Untold Story of Black New Orleans (2008)\n\nFaubourg Tremé is one of the oldest Black neighborhoods in America, and it served as a birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement. This documentary tells the story of that neighborhood through interviews that explore its legacy. People who want to learn about Black History, civil rights, and sociology need to add this to their watch list.\n\nThe Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson (2017)\n\nDirected by award-winning documentarian David France, this Netflix film investigates the 1992 death of drag queen, activist, and trailblazer Marsha P. Johnson. Although her death was initially ruled a suicide, many believe she was murdered. The fight for LGBTQ+ equality is far from over, and this documentary will remind you of the many challenges those with intersectional identities face.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nStep (2017)\n\nThis documentary takes you through the senior year of an all-girls step team in Baltimore as they try to become first-generation college students. With obstacles and social unrest in their path, the teens strive to succeed in dance. Viewers will find themselves emotional and touched by this celebration of Black girlhood and coming of age.\n\nThrough a Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People (2014)\n\nWhat would the story of Black history look like in America if we actually got to see photos that have been suppressed, lost, or forgotten? Through a Lens Darkly poses that question and, by using powerful pictures you’ve probably never seen before, explores photography’s role in shaping who is and is not reflected in our history books. While you watch, you’ll reflect on how important photography is in telling stories, but also how it’s tied to racism and what it would mean to capture Blackness in all its glory.\n\nSTREAM IT\n\nTeach Us All (2017)\n\nThis Netflix film is all about the current state of the U.S. education system and why schools still feel so segregated despite Brown v. Board of Education. Also acting as a social campaign, the film emphasizes the need for collective action to rectify the educational disparities between American children. It’ll make you think about how far we’ve actually come (or…not) in the decades since Brown v. Board of Education and where we go from here."
