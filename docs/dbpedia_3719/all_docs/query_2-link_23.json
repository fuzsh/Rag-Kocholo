        "text": "Who is Carter G. Woodson?\n\nKnown as the “Father of Black History,” he was an author and historian who helped found Black History Month.\n\nWoodson was born in 1875 near New Canton, Virginia. As a young boy he decided he would pursue a college education, even if school often came second to working on his family’s farm.\n\nWoodson later worked as a coal miner while pursuing studies on the side. He went on to be a teacher and school principal before earning his Bachelors degree from the University of Chicago. In 1912, he received his Ph.D. from Harvard University. It was that same year when he helped form the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH).\n\nWoodson urged civic organizations and schools to promote the achievements of Black researchers and to devote time to studying Black history. In February of 1926 he announced Negro History Week. Schools and communities answered the call with large convivial gatherings and from then on ASALH would establish an annual theme, providing study materials and information to participating organizations.\n\nBy the 1960s, the week of study Woodson had first envisioned had turned into Black History Month celebrations each February and ASALH continues to provide education and guidance for each year’s celebrations."
