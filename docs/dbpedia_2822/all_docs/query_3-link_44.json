        "text": "On SCHELL: articles—\n\n\"The Golden Look\" (cover story), in Time (New York), 30 December 1957.\n\nCurrent Biography 1961 , New York, 1961.\n\nSpelman, F., \"The Explosive Schell Family,\" in Show (Hollywood), January 1963.\n\nStars (Mariembourg), Autumn 1994.\n\n* * *\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Maria Schell dazzled rows of moviegoers in Europe and Great Britain with a series of extraordinarily moving performances. German audiences, who were especially enamored of her intense portrayals of unjustly suffering women, voted Schell their favorite actress in 1951, 1952, 1954, 1955, and 1956. Critical tongues likewise wagged approbation, frequently citing Schell's instinctual talent as an actress, the emotional range of her acting, and her goldstruck beauty. Recognizing that her presence in a film could help assure its commercial and often critical success, filmmakers throughout Europe cast Schell in nearly 25 films before 1960. Her role as a central character would also cancel the need for dubbing as Schell spoke five languages.\n\nAfter her critical successes in Die letzte Brücke and Gervaise , MGM acknowledged Schell's abilities and the healthy box-office receipts of her films by inviting her to appear in The Brothers Karamazov as Grushenka, a coveted role for which Marilyn Monroe had originally been considered. Schell's arrival in Hollywood provoked both enthusiastic speculations on her becoming the newest international screen star, and favorable comparisons with Ingrid Bergman who had captured Hollywood in the 1940s. But, a brief series of miscastings, including her performance as Grushenka, revealed the potential weakness of box-office casting and soured Schell's three years in Hollywood. The miscastings only highlighted her shortcomings and misused her strengths. As Grushenka, Schell reduced the complexity of Dostoevsky's character to a frustrating ambiguity, replete with a nervous giggle. For MGM's remake of Cimarron , Schell undermined the role of Sabra Cavet through a number of inexplicable acts such as repeatedly flashing the famous Schell smile while in childbirth."
