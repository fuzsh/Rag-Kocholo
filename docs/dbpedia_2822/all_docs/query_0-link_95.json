        "text": "Well hello again!!! I would just like to thank all my readers for taking the time out of their busy day and reading my blog! So in my last couple of weeks in Austria I was able to travel around Europe with my fellow exchange student, we went to 7 different countries in only 2 and a half weeks! I was able to go to Germany, Belgium, France, Andorra, Spain, Monaco and Italy!\n\nMy trip started off in Linz, Austria where after an eight hour bus ride we arrived in Cologne, Germany. Germany was really cool and the massive Cologne Dom is just amazing to say the least. It is so massive it was hard to get the whole thing in just one shot! We only spent one night in Germany and then the next day we were off to Belgium.\n\nHere I am with my fellow exchanger Joel at the Cologne Dom\n\nIn Belgium we were able to go to two cities Brussels and Brugge. While we were in Brussels it rained so much but even though it was raining it was still beautiful! As well Brugge was absolutely amazing and it really does live up to its nickname of the Venice of the north. Out of those two cities I would have to say that Brugge was my favourite because it was so interesting and beautiful, but don’t get me wrong Brussels is still beautiful.\n\nWhen in Belgium you must treat yourself to the countries cuisine so it was Belgium Waffles all around.\n\nIn Brussels, one of the most famous statues…a little boy peeing.\n\nSo now I will show you a little taste of Brugge.\n\nSo moving right along, next stop France! Our first stop was Paris. I had already been there once before but it was nice to see it again. Also while we were in France we went to Toulouse, Eze and Avignon. While we were in Avignon I ran into a fellow exchange student that was from my district back in Canada and was on exchange in Denmark! It was so nice to see her again. France was really nice and I would have to say that southern France is my favourite.\n\nHere is a quick glance at my time in Paris.\n\nHere I am with my friend Gen.\n\nHere I am with my friend Lauren\n\nAnd now a photo from Toulouse\n\nNow moving right along to Avignon.\n\nReunited with my friend from Canada that went on exchange in Denmark.\n\nEze, located in southern France.\n\nWell I guess that is enough photos of France, haha. The next place that I want to show you is Andorra. This small country is very unique and medieval looking and is definitely one of my favourites. Unfortunately it was raining that day and I didn’t get a lot of photos.\n\nNow moving along to my favourite place on this whole entire trip, Barcelona. This city was so unbelievable and amazing! It is hard to put into words this incredible city so I will let my pictures tell the story.\n\nAnother place we went to was Monaco. It was also amazingly beautiful and I would very much like to go back. We only had an afternoon there but I enjoyed ever moment that I was there. And there were a lot of nice cars there and well I know where I am going to look for a husband haha just kidding.\n\nWell the final country we visited was Italy and we hit most of the major cities in Italy. We went to Florence, Cinque Terre,Pisa, Lucca, Venice and Jesolo. It was very beautiful! Again it is hard to put into words so I will let my pictures do the talking.\n\nSo I will start with one of the coolest places Italy, Cinque Terre\n\nPictures of Pisa.\n\nIt was raining so hard in Lucca that we had to sit in the bus for ten minutes because we couldn't even outside it was raining so hard! But the picture below is taken after the rain storm.\n\nFlorence!\n\nVenice!\n\nGondola ride!\n\nWell that was my little tour of Europe. I had so much fun and all I can say is that time went to quickly.\n\nWelcome back to my adventure! It has been a while since I last posted and that was due to the fact that I was off travelling around Europe, but that is not what this blog post is about (that one will come later), this one is about what I was up to before Euro Tour.\n\nI last left off with the Rotary Conference so I will begin again from there. So I had just moved into my fourth families home, which is located on the main square of my town! So I literally lived in down town Voelkermarkt hahah. They had three kids, the youngest Pauli (12), Antonia (15) and Hemma who just turned 18. The dad is a dentist and the mother helps out in his office which is connected to the house. They were really nice and it was fun staying with them even though it was only for a little while. They took me to a hockey game and that made me feel right at home because what Canadian doesn`t like hockey haha. And just in case you were wondering, yes we did win that game and the team Klagenfurt KAC went on to win the Austrian league beating the Vienna Capitals in the finals. I wish I could have stayed longer with them, but unfortunately the mother became ill and it became to stressful with four kids so I switched host families once again.\n\nAnother awesome thing that happened during the spring was I went and visited the girl that went on exchange in my district back home in Canada in Vienna. It was definitely weird seeing her again because the last time I saw her was when we were in Canada and she was staying over at my house and now I was doing the exact same thing except at her house! On the Friday I took the train to Vienna and 3 hours later I was there! She is part of an organization that is like scouts and on that Friday they were having a fundraiser to pay for their trip to Scotland, so I tagged along. It was a party and it had a black light room where you put on special paint that glows in the dark! So you can guess where I was most of the night haha. I literally got paint everywhere! So that was really fun and I made a lot of new friends. The next day we went shopping! When in Vienna you have to go shopping on the Mariahilfer Strasse, it is the shopping street in Vienna. We spent most of the day there since this was my third time there in Vienna and we just wanted to hang out like old times. We later went and saw a movie and one of the local theatres. The next day I had to say goodbye but it was really nice seeing her again.\n\nHere is a picture of us\n\nIt was not a sad ride home in the train because I was not alone, because I picked my brother up to come visit me for a week. It was really weird to see him! The first thing he said to me was not “hello” but rather “your hair is longer” haha. He stayed with me in Voelkermarkt for 5 relaxing days. While he was here I showed him around my small town as well as my favourite coffee shop. He even went with me to my school and went to an English class with me! It was nice to see him again and I am really looking forward to seeing him again when I return to Canada.\n\nHere is a photo of us when we went on our 2 hour long walk around Voelkermarkt.\n\nThe next big adventure I did was I went and visited one of my exchange friends who lives up in Linz, Austria and is from Australia. When we get together it is really funny because we compare our English because even though we both speak English it is very different from one another. I think we argued for over an hour on how to say the word “basil” and while I say “ketchup” she says “tomato sauce” haha it was really funny. Also her host family was really excited to meet me because I am from Canada and their daughter a few years ago was on exchange in Canada near where I live! They had even been to my home town in Canada, which was crazy! I only stayed for a weekend, but on the Saturday they took me to the Czech Republic! We went to a medieval town that was absolutely breath taking! We spent the day there just walking around the city and we also had a coffee in the sunshine! It was nice to see her again\n\nHere I am in Krumlow (city in the Czech Republic) with Gen and her host sister.\n\nHey looks it’s a bear in Europe!\n\nThe train ride back to Voelkermarkt was unique to say the least. First off my bus was late getting to the train station so I missed the train I wanted to take but I didn’t realize that I had, so I hopped onto the wrong train (but luckily it was headed to the right place) with the wrong ticket so I had to pay again, oops. Then, because I had to switch trains in Salzburg, and the train I was on was running late, I watched the train that I would be switching on to leave the station just as I arrived! So I sat in the train station for 2 hours enjoying a cup of coffee and reading my book. Shit happens and what can you do, right haha. Also as I was waiting I got a phone call from my YEO (person that is in-charge of the exchange students in Voelkermarkt) saying that when I get back we have to talk. I was so nervous, that I had done something wrong, but as it turned out my host mother had become ill and it would be too stressful to have 4 kids so I was switching host families, yet again. So I arrived on a Monday and I switched families the Thursday.\n\nMy new family is so nice! Though I am only with them for a short period of time, I am really happy that I switched. They have two kids, Pauli who is 11 and Anna who just turned 5! Pauli is always asking me to play volleyball and soccer and sometimes I let him win haha. My host dad is part of the police force and my host mother is the head nurse at the hospital in Klagenfurt. While I have been here I was able to take an amazing job shadowing experience with my host mom. I was able to follow her around the hospital for a day! I was in the operating room, wearing those lovely green scrubs (which are extremely comfortable might I add) and everything! I was able to watch several surgeries, including one where they took out the plastic implant that was working as a guy’s shoulder and replace it! It was amazing! I would never have gotten such an amazing opportunity back in Canada. It was definitely worth waking up at 5:00am on a Saturday haha.\n\nOn the Sunday after I arrived in my new host family I went to Venice, Italy! I went to Italy with my first host mom and the other exchange student Celeste. Venice is beautiful to say the least! If you ever get a chance go to Venice for a day and just get lost in the city.\n\nHere I am with Celeste.\n\nSo that’s all for now folks, so stay tuned for my next post all about my Euro Tour that I just went on! Till then I hope you have an amazing day.\n\nSo it may seem that I have forgotten about my blog, but that is not true, I have just been extremely busy! I last left off with my adventure to Kitzbühel, and what an adventure that was, and now I will pick up with where I left off with the introduction of my third host family. In my third family there were three kids Leo (16), Vinzenz (18) and Valentin (20), oh and don’t forget my host parents Christina and Christian. They live just outside of the city where I am stationed at this year in a place called Griffin, it is very beautiful there and it was only a 10 minute bus ride to school! My host parents own some land which consists of forests which they cut and then sell the wood to the mills and that is how they make their living. I was only with them for one month but for that one month we all became very close friends.\n\nHere I am with Leo enjoying the nice spring air.\n\nHere is a picture of the castle ruins that are in Griffin and if you have been reading my blog you will remember I visited them back in the fall.\n\nHere is my other host brother Vinzenz with their dog Justin.\n\nDuring March all the exchange students got together for one whole week of skiing in Schladming, Austria. During this week we got to meet the exchange students that arrived in January that are staying till December. In my program there are terms for exchange students ones that are already there when you get to your country are called “oldies” and then you are called a “newbie”, so in Schladming it was the first time that we as oldies got to meet our newbies and it was a little sad because being an oldie means that your exchange year is half way over! But it was really fun meeting new people and learning how to ski. Since where I live there are no newbies so I adopted one, her name is Genevieve and she comes from Australia! Of course I pick a newbie that lives at the opposite end of Austria than I do but why not right! I was in the intermediate skiing group as I have just learned how to ski, and I really hope to keep up my skiing when I return to my home country. Not only did we go skiing but for one afternoon we went sledding down a 7km sledding track! It was so much fun because you have a bunch of exchange students who don’t know how to drive these sleds going down a ski hill at a fairly good pace and it was not a straight track by any means, there was even a tunnel! I went twice, once by myself and then another time with my newbie Genevieve and it was so much fun! And believe it or not but it was actually easier to drive these sleds with two people rather than one! We even went over jumps and even got some air! It was so much fun! But after 6 days of skiing it was nice to sleep in my own bed again.\n\nHere I am in the white and black ski jacket with two newbies Genevieve and Maggie getting ready to go down the sledding track.\n\nHere we are again at the bottom of the track ALIVE haha.\n\nMy newbie and myself\n\nSo a week after ski camp there was a Rotary conference that most of the exchange students went to including me. It was just outside of Graz, Austria in a place called Leibnitz. I was lucky enough to get driven to the conference by two of my Rotarians, who while we were driving to the conference asked me “So what do you think of Austrian boys?” And I simply didn’t have an answer haha. But they were super nice and extremely fun. It was really great to see the exchange students again even though there were only about 50 or so out of 100 exchange students there. After we got dressed up we walked uphill to the conference were we to make an appearance. When we arrived we made a flag parade into the conference room not alphabetically but geographically so guess who got to go first into the meeting room, ME! I was nervous that I thought I would fall or trip but you will be disappointed to know that I did not. While we were there several exchange students showed off their amazing talents such as singing and dancing in a talent show. After leaving the Rotarians to eat we rejoined them to sit and chat with them, while a band played some light jazz. One of my Rotarians is a dancing instructor and use to compete in ballroom dancing competitions, and he decided it would be a good thing to start up the dance floor. He first grabbed a girl from Brazil who during the talent show, showed off her ability to move her hips and they danced. He then decided it was a good idea to dance with me even though I had no idea what I was doing I just went with the flow and it actually appeared to the audience that I knew what I was doing! It was so much fun actually! The next day I got picked up by the same Rotarians again but one (not the dancer) had some business to do in the city so I went with the other Rotarian (the dancer to a coffee shop) , and during the four hours we spent there we did not only drink coffee but he taught me how to dance! Only in Austria do you learn how to do the quick step, disco fox, mamba and the waltz in a coffee shop! After my dance lesson all three of us drove back and in was nice to sleep in my own bed once again.\n\nMy fellow British Columbian exchange student!\n\nSo that’s it for now folks, sorry for the long wait but I just have been so busy it’s crazy!\n\nSo stay tuned for the next installment that I promise will be soon! Have a wonderful day and talk to you soon.\n\nSo as you have noticed I have not updated my blog in an extremely long time….oops. So to make it up to you guys I have decided to tell you about my amazing adventure skiing in one of the most famous places to ski in the whole wide world, Kitzbühel.\n\nKitzbühel is a small but widely known skiing town located in the province of Tyrol, really close to Innsbruck, and it is home to one of the toughest downhill races for the World Cup of skiing. So on the morning of February 12th I hopped onto a train by myself going to Kitzbühel to stay for two days there with my first host family. I manage to score a compartment all to myself and just started settling down when I heard English being spoken outside in the hallway, so what do I do but stick my head out because its not everyday you hear English being spoken. There was four elderly ladies and one man all in their late 60’s looking for a place to sit talking to each other from opposite ends of the hallway, and being the helpful Canadian that I am I asked if they needed help and they said that they were fine and that my English was very good, and being my mothers daughter I couldn’t help but reply and say that’s because I am Canadian haha. Being all by myself I offered to share my compartment and they were very glad about that. They were from North Carolina and Philadelphia here on holidays cross-country skiing in Italy and Austria. The whole train ride was filled with their many stories of adventure and they even gave me cookies haha, it was very enjoyable and I was sad when I had to leave to switch trains. And when I arrived in the skiing town I was greeted by my first host mom with a big hug, then we picked up my host sister and her friend from the ski school. After dinner my host mom and I went for a walk through “down town” Kitzbühel, and here is a shot of the street.\n\nOh and look what I found, that’s right they even have a Louis Vuitton in Kitzbühel.\n\nA funny thing happened on our little walk about, when we decided to stop for a coffee to warm us up we went into a coffee shop and my host mom started ordering in German but then the waitress was like and I quote “Sorry I only speak English” I was like what just happened here haha.\n\nSo the next day I had my first day of skiing lessons! I was put into a group of 10 people who ranged in ages from 26 to 55 and they were all from the United Kingdom and they spoke not a lick of German, and even my ski instructor was from the United Kingdom! It was really fun and we all laughed at each other and it was just plain fun and don’t get me wrong we learned how to ski. The next day I woke up slightly sore but ready for round two of skiing. I met up with the group at the ski school ready for another day with the beginner group, but I was met with a lovely surprise that I was being moved up to the intermediate group along with another girl named Shelly (she is from Ireland and has a wicked accent). Again I was in an all English speaking group of five people including myself and the instructor who was also from the United Kingdom. Here is a picture of Shelly and me riding the gondola up to go skiing.\n\nAnd here is a shot also from the gondola of Kitzbühel.\n\nIt was the perfect skiing conditions on that particular Thursday, the sun was shining and the snow was fantastic and the view was just unbelievable.\n\nI had a lot of fun again and learned so much, I even went down a black run and for all those non-skiers out there a black run is the hardest possible run you can do on a mountain.\n\nHere is another shot of me and my skiing buddy Shelly.\n\nMy awesome intermediate group!\n\nOh look at the beautiful skiing day.\n\nAnd lastly here is a photo of me at the starting gate to the world famous downhill ski race.\n\nHope you enjoyed my little adventure in Kitzbühel and stay tuned for my next adventure.\n\nWell hello again! I can’t believe it is already February, like how did that happen! So I guess I should tell you what I have been up to lately, so find a comfy chair and grab a cup of tea (or coffee whatever you prefer) and get ready for another tale of adventure from Savannah. So I last left off right before New Years, so I believe it would be a good idea to pick up where I left off haha. For New Years I decided to spend it with my host family and experience New Years Austrian style, with family. We had a small campfire in the back yard and listened to the many fireworks that went off like every five minutes, at some points there were so many it sounded like I was in a war zone! All in all New Years was good and it was a great way to bring in 2013 with family. And like back in North America, Christmas holidays end and it is back to school and well life. So I returned to school and the week after I returned Celeste (the other exchange student in my town) and myself were interviewed by the newspaper here in my State of Carinthia. I was very nervous about being interviewed and leading up to the interview my heart was pounding and again I thought I might have another heart attack haha. But the interviewer was super nice and when Celeste and I could not find words in German about what we were trying to say she helped us out, which was super nice of her. And interesting thing here in Austria is that even though with the internet and news from all over the world at the touch of your hand everyone here still reads the newspaper. So now I guess my secret cover is blown and the entire state of Carinthia now knows who I am, in fact just the other day a person came up to me and said that he saw me in the newspaper. Here is the link to my interview and to those people who can’t speak German I am sorry that you won’t be really able to understand it.\n\nhttp://www.kleinezeitung.at/kaernten/voelkermarkt/3223420/kanada-usa-gegen-suedkaernten-getauscht.story\n\nAlso another exciting event that happened was my host dad had his birthday! And for his birthday my host brother, sister, dad and myself went sledding! And we did not just go on those plastic sleds that we as North Americans have become accustomed to but on actual wooden sleds! And not only did we go sledding but we went at night on an actual course for sledding with a tunnel and everything! I thought I would be able to drive it after having ridden on many plastic sleds but as it turns out it is harder than it looks and these sleds really fly once you start down the hill. I remember going down the hill and then seeing a sharp corner thinking “ oh god I am going to die” but alas I am still alive and what an adrenaline rush that was! It was amazing and really fun andI really recommend that everyone give it a try. After almost nearly dieing we went for dinner and that was also very enjoyable as well haha. So that was January in a nut shell.\n\nHere is a picture of what one of these sleds looks like.\n\nSo that was January, stay tuned for February with more adventures including my trip to Kitzbühel, Austria for skiing. Hope you have a wonderful day!\n\nHello and welcome back to my wild adventure. So I thought I would do a post about how they celebrate Christmas here because it is very different from the way we celebrate (or the way my family celebrates anyways) in Canada as well as tell you about the rest of December. So i guess I will start off with how they celebrate here, so buckle down and get ready for some good old culture lessons haha. First off here they celebrate on the 24th of December in the evening (so I got presents a little earlier than normal YES haha) and they don’t have a Santa Claus like we do in North America but rather a Christkind which is like an angel that brings gifts to the children in the evening. Like many families here, this holiday is a very traditional one and on the 24th we had a lovely home cooked meal and my host brother Maxi the one that lives in Graz came up for the holidays as well and we all enjoyed a lovely fish dinner, no turkey or ham like in North America. After dinner there was a bell that went off to symbolize that the Christkind had come and that we were allowed to enter the living room where we had the Christmas tree. Instead of diving in and a free for all to open presents we went into the living room and sang a few Christmas carols as well as listened to my very talented host sister Paula play the piano for us, she has only been playing for two years and she is already really good, it’s crazy! As well as my host mom read a Christmas story for us (of course it was in German if you were wondering) and then we were allowed to open presents. The way that we opened presents here is the youngest (which was Paula) opened one present and then the next youngest (which was me) opened one present and then it kept going on like this until the oldest person in the room opened their present and then we started again with the youngest again. My host family knows me so well that, they knew how much I love salami here that they actually bought me a whole roll of salami for myself which took about a month to eat by the way. After all the presents were opened the adults had a drink and we sat around talking and enjoying each others company, in the remaining candle light from the Christmas tree. Oops I forgot to tell you that they actually put candles on the Christmas trees here no waisting electricity, real life candles! It was really a great Christmas and my first one away from home and my family and it just made me appreciate them even more and realize all the small things they do to make Christmas, well Christmas. Here Christmas is more about family and getting together with people and it was a fresh change to the very commercialized Christmas that you experience in North America, and it is definitely something I want to take back to Canada with me. So now that you know a little about Christmas here in Austria I will continue on with my adventure. As in Canada, I had two lovely weeks off from school, YES haha. During the break you will never guess what I did! I learned how to ski! That’s right I am Canadian and I didn’t know how to ski before I came to Austria! In Austria everyone knows how to ski and most everyone knows how to also snowboard, so why not learn here, I only had to fly half way around the world to learn but why not. I borrowed a ski jacket from my first host brother, ski pants from my second host brother and skies, poles and boots from my first host sister and went to the ski hill that was literally 20 minutes away from my house here called the Petzen. The Petzen actually borders both Austria and Slovenia so you have both countries skiing on this hill! My ski instructor was super nice and she spoke not only German and Slovenian she also spoke English very well. And after only three skiing lessons I went with my host mom, Paula and Maxis dad’s family that were up for the holidays skiing. We went to a ski resort near another city in Carinthia (the province I live in) called Villach. I went down the “bunny hill” once and then my host mom allowed me to go out onto the bigger runs, she said I was very good and a quick learner and that my mom should be really proud of me! I really like skiing and I can’t wait to ski back in Canada too. So that’s what I did in the end of December. Oh wait I forgot about one thing! During the holidays I went to a dinner with my family and we got all dressed up in traditional Austrian clothing, so I got to wear what is called a dirndl again! We ate a lot, and there was dancing and music and it just was an amazing time. So now there you have it, what I did in the end of December haha.\n\nHere is the Christmas tree and yes those are actual candles!\n\nHere is my host sister Paula playing the piano and in the background is my host brother Maxi.\n\nOh that’s right we made ornaments and that one is mine.\n\nHere I am with my host mom and we are wearing what are called dirndl.\n\nOh no look out here I come!\n\nStay tuned for what I did in January of 2013!\n\nWell good morning/good evening or whenever you are reading this. So as you can guess I went to Salzburg. From the 14th through till the 16th I went to Salzburg with all the other inbounds in Austria. I left on the train with two other exchange students and as we continued on our journey to Salzburg we ran into more exchange students and by the end we had a whole booth full of us excited and ready for another adventure. We arrived and managed to find the hostel with only one hiccup, we went down the wrong street the first time we tried to access the hostel but in the end we made it there alive and ready to see all the other exchange students again. When we got there, there were many hugs and stories of what we had been up to the past month or so. We were not alone on this adventure there were other exchange students who are spending their exchange year in Croatia were there for the weekend with us and they will also be joining us on the Euro tour which is in the end of May. In this group there were two other Canadians and one of them was actually from my province back in Canada! It is really funny that you travel half way around the world and you wind up meeting someone who is basically your neighbour! So the next day as a group of over 100 exchange students we headed off to the big fortress that rests atop of a mountain in Salzburg called the Hohensalzburg. Our hostel was not in the centre of the city so we had to take a bus to the centre of the city, and as you can imagine trying to put all the exchange students onto an already crowed city bus was just not going to work haha. In the end we managed to get everyone to the city centre in two buses, so thats not that bad and the fact that we only lost the leader once on the trek to the fortress, but we made it there alive so I guess we did not bad at all haha. Once we climbed the mountain to the top the view was breath taking and I had one of those moments were I was like I am actually in Austria! We spent the morning at the fortress and then we went for lunch at a Chinese restaurant, I think that the head guy who is in charge of these weekends really likes Chinese food because whenever we get together we always get Chinese food. After stuffing our faces we had the afternoon mostly off, so with some of my friends we went exploring the city. We went to the Mirabell palace which is know for its amazing gardens, but as it was winter the flowers were not there but it was still amazingly beautiful place to go for a nice winter walk. Afterwards my little group of friends and I went to a little coffee shop to warm up and to get out of the rain. As I said before that we had the afternoon “mostly” off, well all the exchange students that arrived in August like me had to wright a German test to see if we had learned enough German to stay in the country. Going into the test I thought I might have a heart attack at any moment because I was so nervous because my whole year depended on me passing this one test and I am not the greatest test taker, but alas I am sitting here in my room in Austria writing this so I guess I didn’t fail the test, YES!!! Anyways back to Salzburg, so after the test we went out to a big restaurant where we had a lovely dinner and basically a Christmas carol competition. Each country got to go up as a group and sing a Christmas carol, the Canadian group got to sing Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer and we did not that bad for only being 8 people, we were very loud and slightly off key haha. All the other groups sang and the “oldies” the group of exchange students who came here in January of last year sang a goodbye song because it would be the last time we would see them again. Even though the evening had a slight hit of sadness with the oldies leaving and all but over all it was a hilarious evening and the food was delicious. So the next day I hopped onto a train again and went home knowing that I would see Salzburg again because I was coming back on Monday with my class. Yep that’s right I left Salzburg and then I went back again the next day haha. So my class 6A and just so luck would have it the other exchange student’s (Celeste) class 7A went to Salzburg and we toured around the Salzburg. We went to the Dom which is a huge cathedral that is of Baroque style and is amazing and definitely a sight to behold. We also went to Mozart’s house, which is where Mozart lived and is like a mini museum to him and his family. We also went to what is called a Weihnachtsmarkt which translated is a Christmas market, that they have all over Austria in most towns and in all major cities like Salzburg. At these markets the sell little Christmas gifts like handmade wooden toys, scarves, ornaments and even baked goods. For lunch we were on our own and as luck would have it the group that I was chilling with went to the same Chinese restaurant that I had eaten at during the weekend, good thing they had good food or else it wouldn’t have been as funny as it was haha. It was a fun day full of laughs and when the day finally came to an end I could finally say good-bye to Salzburg but I promise you that I will be back because it is such an amazing city. Guess what it’s picture time!!!\n\nHere is the view from the top of the fortress over looking the city and the big building that looks really old well that’s the Dom.\n\nThis picture was actually taken during the weekend when I past by it, not knowing that I would go into it on the following Monday. Oh and by the way its Mozart’s house if you didn’t know what it was.\n\nThese next two photos are of the fortress from the Mirabell palace gardens.\n\nHere is the table I was sitting at with all the wonderful exchange students at the evening of singing Christmas carols.\n\nHere I am with two of my fellow classmates, on the left is Maria and on the right is Christina.\n\nAnd lastly here is a photo of the Christmas market that I talked about early, its not the greatest picture but I am no photographer by any means.\n\nSo there you have it folks, my Salzburg adventures! I had fun and I will definitely go back when I get the chance. So I hope you have a great rest of your day and when you get the chance go out and have your own little adventures.\n\nWell hello everyone! So first off I want to start off with a discovery I have made, I actually have another host brother named Max that lives in Graz which is the second biggest city in Austria. So as the snow falls we enter the month of December, and on the 8th of December it marked my fourth month in Austria, isn’t that just crazy!!!! As usual school continues as it usually does, with class after class and coffee in between haha. On the 7th of December a special event happened in my small community of Voelkermarkt, the Coca Cola truck came to town. The Coca Cola truck is an event that brings Christmas spirit to your town and it is like a miny Christmas parade with singing and dancing elves and angels and of course Christmas music blaring. Oh I forgot to mention that Santa was even there for the event as well! It was really fun singing along with the Christmas carols and hanging out with Celeste and my new Austrian friend Sebastian. After going to the Coca Cola truck Celeste along with my host family went to see Maximilian Schell speak about his career as an actor. Because my host dad Igor is actually really good friends with Maximilian we went to dinner with him and he was really nice and super funny. Here is a link to those who have no idea who he is.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_Schell\n\nOn the 8th there was a Krampus run! Now you’re probably like what is a Krampus and why are they running, well hold onto your hats and get out your notebook because I am about to teach you some Austrian culture. First off lets start off with some background information, the exact origin of the Krampus is unknown. It is assumed that he arose during the Middle Ages when the church promoted religious preaching theatre. Krampus was called the devil and accompanied Nikolaus (or in English St. Nicolas) on December 5th and 6th. Together Nikolaus and Krampus listed people’s bad actions and preached morality. Over time the tradition split off from the church until it was banned during the Inquisition under the threat of the death penalty. It was forbidden to dress up as the devil, but in isolated mountain villages the tradition survived until it spread again after the Inquisition. Krampus punish the bad children while Nikolaus rewards the good children. In special Krampus runs they gather in groups wearing realistic looking masks and costumes and scare the people who show up to these runs, including little children. During these runs the Krampus hit people, yes that’s right they hit people, but not the little kids they simply pat them on the head. In my personal opinion they are very scary and it is a good idea that you go with someone. I went with Celeste and her host brother Pauli as well as Sebastian. The Krampus were really scary and one even pulled down the gate that separated the crowd from them and came right into the crowd were I was standing!!! Luckily I didn’t not get hit! Even though this tradition is very scary it is definitely unique which is a change from back home. Well that was just the beginning of December stay tuned for the next instalments about both my Salzburg trips and the days leading up till Christmas.\n\nSo here is a picture from the Coca Cola truck. These people were singing Christmas carols.\n\nOne of the many dancing Christmas related objects at the Coca Cola Truck.\n\nThe following pictures are of some Krampus.\n\nAren’t the Krampus just lovely looking haha. Stay tuned for the next addition of my adventures with Days in Salzburg.\n\nWell hello again! Time is just flying by here, it feels like just yesterday I was hopping onto a plane to fly to Austria but now I am already on my second host family! This is crazy!!!! I was sad to leave my old host family but I was really excited to live with my new family the Pucker, theyare super nice and amazing to say the least. My host mom’s name is Bärbel and my host dad’s name is Igor and they have two children Paula who is 14 and is my host sister and technically I have a host brother and his name is Julius, but right now he is living in Canada because he is also on exchange. The Pucker have one dog named Carmel and three cats, and their one cat really likes me and her name is Hexe which means witch in German. See when you read my blog you learn a little German as well hahah. The Pucker only speak German to me so that is fantastic and I feel like I will learn a lot of German from them, so that is amazing! So now that you are up to speed with my host family situation let’s get to the “and more” part of this post hahaha. Last Friday night I went to go see Skyfall (the new and totally awesome James Bond movie) in the Kino (movie theatre in German) and that was fun. The Kino was really big and inside the theatre it had a bar and everything, and the seating inside the actual viewing place was very spacious and comfortable. And now you are probably wondering did I see the movie in German or in English, and I am happy to announce that yes I did see the movie in German and I could even understand it….well some what haha. Then on Saturday night I went to a ball in the capital of the province I am living (which is Carinthia) in the city of Klangenfurt which is like a 30 minute drive from new house. The balls here are to celebrate the grading class and this ball had two parts to it, the one part is where there was seating and a dance floor for the older styles of dancing and a second part for a disco. I danced and had a lot of fun! Then on Sunday I went to my first English riding lesson with my third host family and Celeste the other exchange student here. It was really fun and it felt great getting back on a horse even though I am use to Western riding style rather than English. Unfortunately I don’t have any pictures for this post but next time I promise to have some!!! Till then hope you have a wonderful day!\n\nSo as you have noticed I am very, very far behind in my blog…..oops sorry! So as you can guess by the tittle I went to Germany and the Czech Republic!!! From the 31st of October (Halloween) till November 3rd I was with the inbounds in Austria traveling around Europe hahaa. So on the train ride to Linz, Austria where we were all meeting up I ran into two girls who actually new another exchange student that is also in Austria that I am really close friends with and it made me realize how small the world is hahah. I love train rides you always meet people who are so interesting!!! So we get to Linz and then we are off to Prague!!! It was a long drive but it was so beautiful in the fall sunshine! So we get to Prague in the evening and then we have a city tour on foot, which was nice to get out and walk finally. So here is a little bit of info about Prague:\n\n-it is part of the European Union\n\n-they do not use the Euro as currency but the Czech crown (which is really cool looking)\n\n-it is very old\n\n-in Czech Prague is spelt Praha\n\n-and it is the capital and largest city in the Czech Republic\n\nSo now thaqt you know a little bit about Prague or Praha I will continue the tale of my adventure. So as a group we basically ran through they old part of the city because we had no time and we were running out of daylight, but Prague looked beautiful in the night time too. If I could back to Prague I would in a heart beat because it is so beautiful!! So after having dinner we went to a hostel for the night. The next morning we woke up bright and early and got back on the bus after breakfast and we headed off to Dresden! So guess you probably what to know a little bit about Dresden now so here is goes\n\n-it is located in Germany\n\n-in the WW2 it was heavily bombed and basically was destroyed because of that\n\n-it is still beautiful and full of awesome old buildings\n\nIn Dresden we had an on bus tour, and it was not very good unfortunately. The tour guide had a very soothing and relaxing voice that put everyone asleep, I really tried to stay awake because Dresden is really cool but like the rest of the bus I fell asleep. After the 2 hour bus tour or as I have come to call it a nap we got to get off the bus and walk around the city centre which was really amazing!!!! We weren’t staying the night in Dresden so it was back on the bus and off to Berlin we went. Again we arrived in the evening so it was to the hostel we went. The next morning we had another bus tour that was 10x better than the one in Dresden. Oops I forgot to mention some info about Berlin earlier so here it is\n\n-it is located in Germany\n\n-it is the capital of Germany\n\n-largest city in Germany\n\n-it is fairly inexspensive to live there because when they rebuilt Berlin they made it more spread out allowing for more houses compared to other European cities\n\nSo now back to my adventure! Berlin is really cool and it has this vibe to it that can only be explained if you go there and trust me I wasn’t the only one to say that there is just a really cool feeling to Berlin. After the tour we had part of the afternoon off so with a group of friends we went to the most popular street in Berlin, the shopping street and went people watching haha. We watched this amazing street performance where they were doing flips and break dancing and a whole bunch of really cool tricks. We spent the night again in Berlin and then in the morning we woke up extremely early to get back on the bus and drove back to Linz. The 8 hour bus ride was filed with napping, people reciting poems, listening to music and hanging out with the other amazing exchange students! So that was my trip so sorry for the delay.\n\nHere is a picture of the really big and beautiful church in Prague.\n\nAnother shot of the beautiful church!!\n\nPrague in the night.\n\nPrague :)\n\nMy future ride.\n\nDresden!!!\n\nCarley and myself in Dresden.\n\nA cool wall in Dresden.\n\nBerlin baby haha.\n\nMy fellow exchange students :)\n\nAwesome shot of the gate way.\n\nThe Berlin Wall.\n\nMore art on the Berlin Wall.\n\nBerlin again.\n\nAgain sorry for being slightly late!!!! So watch out for my next instalment which sure be coming up very soon!"
