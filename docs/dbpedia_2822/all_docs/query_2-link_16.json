        "text": "Actress Maria Schell died of pneumonia April 26 in the Austrian province Kaernten. She was 79.\n\nThe sister of director/thesp Maximilian Schell, she was an icon of 1950s German cinema and made occasional appearances in Hollywood productions.\n\nBorn in Vienna, she became a Swiss citizen when her family relocated to Switzerland. Withno prior acting experience, she was discovered at 16 and appeared in some minor productions. Her career received a boost with German pic “Angel with a Trumpet” in 1948, which two years later was adapted for an English-lingo remake also starring Schell.\n\nIn German post-war cinema, Schell was one of the busiest and most popular actresses. In her numerous pics, she was often cast as a vulnerable young woman exposed to tragic circumstances, and she was nicknamed “seelchen” (little soul).\n\nIn 1954, she won the Cannes actress award for Helmut Kautner’s “The Last Bridge,” her ticket to Hollywood, and appeared in “The Brothers Karamazov” and alongside Gary Cooper in “The Hanging Tree”\n\nFrom the early 1960s onwards, she withdrew from the big screen in favor of TV and theater roles. Her last international appearance was in 1978 in “Superman,” and she continued appearing on German TV until 1996. When her brother Maximilian released biopic “My Sister Maria” in 2002, she attended the premiere in a wheelchair.\n\nShe is survived by a son and a daughter."
