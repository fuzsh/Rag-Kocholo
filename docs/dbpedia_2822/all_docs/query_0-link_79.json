        "text": "Time to look at Austrian stamps for 2021. I like this time of year; many post offices announce coming year’s stamp. 8 stamps will be released by Österreichischen Post covering topics ranging from architects, cars, trains, and art:\n\nThe Frankfurt Kitchen\n\nTrains & cars\n\nOld Masters on stamps\n\nNature\n\nOld stamps\n\nSpring flowers\n\nArchitecture\n\nlots of great postcards\n\nI’m experimenting with creating lists of upcoming releases that can be updated with photos and details throughout the year. I haven’t settled on a format, hence the varying styles in the previous articles on coming Canadian, USA and Australian stamps. I’m leaning towards the layout on this article because it’s clean and easy to update. Sometime in January, I’ll create a new index titled – Year Issues – 2021 and link to all the various pages. Not sure how many I’ll manage to setup, it’s not easy finding the info and translating some of the details. It can be a bit of a slog.\n\nToday’s offering, as you can see by the title is Austria 2021. When possible, I’ll include extra information about the stamps and captures of the day of issue cancels. Although the topics and titles have been released, many of the designs have not been. Bookmark the page if you are interested in Austrian stamps and come back each month to see updated details.\n\nPlease note I’m depending on Google Translate so some of the English translations may not be 100% correct. If you find an error in my translations, please post a comment and I’ll correct it. Your help would be appreciated in ensuring accuracy.\n\nUpdates\n\nMarch 7, 2021\n\nNew images and details added to Jan and Feb stamps. Uploaded the March issues to date. I’ve expanded the list to include yearly series releases and postcards. I’m still sorting through the various series and will keep uploading details as I stumble across it. Lots of new details on designers past stamps.\n\nI commend Österreichischen Post for their beautiful cancels. The level of detail is breathtaking. If you’re a cancel hound, I’d recommend taking a look at collecting Austrian stamps. The variety and attention to artistry in each is pure delight. Might have to take up a new area to collect.\n\nMarch 20, 2021\n\nBegan adding postcard releases from the year. Austria issues some great ones, along with postcard booklets. I’m still sorting through the information and will continue to list new details as I get it.\n\nAustrian stamps for 2021 Jan\n\nMargarete Schütte-Lihotzky\n\n1 stamp, 2 FDC, cancel, information (treatise) sheet, sheets of 10, non-philatelic B&W print of single stamp & sheet, special-issue stamp set\n\nDesigner: David Gruber\n\nThis stamp celebrates the life of Schütte-Lihotzky, the first woman to work successfully as an architect in Austria. Her ground-breaking Frankfurt kitchen designed rationalised kitchens to make them more efficient.\n\nAll of us benefiting from a modern, well designed kitchen should thank Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky. Schütte-Lihotzky was the architect behind what became known as the Frankfurt Kitchen, the forerunner to modern kitchen designs. She was an extraordinary person that would take far too long to write about in this short space. You can read more about here Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky – Wikipedia\n\nRelease date: Jan 20, 2021\n\nPullman Graf & Stift SP 8 Pullman\n\n1 stamp, FDC, special cancel, information (treatise) sheet, non-philatelic B&W print\n\nDesigner: David Gruber.\n\nThis little stamp will appeal to collectors of automobiles, especially classic, prewar ones. Also designed by David Gruber, the 1930 Pullman car stamp will be issued the same day as the Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky stamp. The First Day cancel will be worth getting on its own.\n\nRelease date: Jan 20, 2021\n\nSummer 2021\n\n2 Vending machine stamps\n\nRelease date: Jan. 8, 2021\n\nAustrian stamps for 2021 Feb stamps\n\nGoing, going, gone!\n\nSeries: Famous attractions\n\n6 postcards, 6 stamps\n\nRelease date: Feb. 1, 2021\n\nGreetings from Staycation\n\nPostcard booklet – 4 postcards, 5 stamps\n\nRelease date: Feb. 1, 2021\n\nTravels through Germany\n\npacket of 20 stamps\n\nRelease date: Feb. 1, 2021\n\nSights in Austria #1\n\nSeeschloss Ort – Upper Austria\n\nCathedral of Gurk – Carinthia, Schloss\n\nFreundsberg – Tirol\n\nStrudlhofstiege – Vienna\n\n4 stamps, 1 souvenir sheet\n\nRelease date: Feb 1, 2021\n\nFamous Towers\n\npacket of 20 stamps\n\nRelease date: Feb. 1, 2021\n\nHeimische Tierwelt\n\nSeries: Austrian animal kingdom\n\nwood bee\n\nblower\n\ngrey goose\n\nblind snail\n\n4 stamps, souvenir sheet\n\nRelease date: Feb. 2, 2021\n\nWESTbahn | railways\n\n1 stamp, FDC, special cancel, information (treatise) sheet, non-philatelic B&W print\n\nWESTbahn operates eight six-car, low-floor KISS 1- and KISS 2-type 4010 series electric multiple-unit trains made by the Swiss manufacturer Stadler Rail AG.

Before he became a student in Rembrandt’s workshop, he learned glass painting from his father. The painting shown here, made in the Baroque period shortly before 1660, demonstrates what Gerard Dou became famous for: Meticulous, detailed depictions, everyday subjects and dark scenes. The only light source is usually a candle or lantern, which strongly characterizes the atmospheric images and makes them perfect Christmas motifs.\n\nThis panel painting was executed on oak wood and is quite small, with a size of 25.5 by 21 centimeters. It belongs to the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, where two other works by Gerard Duo can be admired. Already during his lifetime his works achieved top prices. He is therefore one of the highest paid painters in Holland of the Golden Age.\n\nCommemorative stamp Girl at Window with Lantern – PostAG\n\nDesigner: Regina Simon\n\nArtist: Gerard Dou\n\nRelease date: November 26, 2021\n\nChristmas – St. Joseph with Child Jesus, St. Stephen’s Cathedral, Vienna\n\n1 stamp, cancel\n\nThe painting is on the altar of St. Joseph in St. Stephen’s Cathedral in Vienna.\n\nDesigner: Karin Klier\n\nRelease date: November 26, 2021\n\nStop Climate Change\n\n2 stamps on souvenir sheet, cancel\n\nDesigner: David Gruber\n\nRelease date: December 6, 2021\n\nAustria’s Natural Treasures #4\n\n4 stamps on a souvenir sheet\n\nGesäuse, Styria\n\nKirschgarten, Burgenland\n\nWolfsklamm, Tyrol;\n\nSchneeberg, Lower Austria\n\nRelease date:\n\nChristmas – Nativity Scene\n\n1 stamp\n\nRelease date:\n\nMultilateral Christmas 2021\n\n1 stamp\n\nThis is a joint issue with Liechtenstein, Austria, Switzerland and Germany\n\nRelease date:\n\nAustrian stamp, Covid 2020 & a sense of humour\n\nCOFFEE SUBSCRIPTIONS:\n\nEnjoying the content?\n\nOR\n\nCheck out the Patreon tiers & perks: Become a Patron!\n\nInstant Coffee $2 a month\n\nEspresso Shot $5 month\n\nEspresso & Stamps $10 per month\n\nDeluxe Mocha & Box of Stamps tier – $25 per month."
