        "text": "Life\n\nBorn in Copăceni, Bălţi County, in what is now the Republic of Moldova, Păunescu spent his childhood in Bârca, Dolj County. He did his secondary studies at Carol I High School in Craiova.\n\nPăunescu studied philology at the University of Bucharest and became a writer and journalist. He was an influential public figure for Romanian youth throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Though he was criticised for writing flattering poems about Nicolae Ceauşescu, Păunescu remained popular in Romania, where he appeared on television several times a week.\n\nAs posthumously summarized by newspaper România Liberă, Păunescu \"is still viewed as a hero by the man in the street\" although \"intellectuals continue to question his integrity and the literary value of his work\".\n\nFlacăra and Cenaclul Flacăra\n\nA member of the Union of Communist Youth between 1966 and 1968, and, between 1968 and 1989, of the Romanian Communist Party, Păunescu gained control over a major weekly publication, Flacăra and became the producer and host of the only itinerant folk and pop show in the country, Cenaclul Flacăra, founded in 1973.\n\nPolitical career\n\nAfter 1989 Păunescu pursued a political career, aligning himself with socialism and then social-democratic political parties.\n\nIn 1996, he ran in the Romanian presidential election but received only 87,163 votes (0.69%). He was a senator from 1992 to 2008, representing Dolj County (1992–2004) and then Hunedoara County (2004–2008), first of the Socialist Labour Party, and later of the Social Democratic Party of Romania. He received the most votes in his district at the 2008 election, but failed to win a seat after the votes were redistributed pursuant to the MMP system used.\n\nDeath\n\nAged 67, Păunescu was hospitalized on 26 October 2010 in the intensive care unit of the Floreasca Emergency Hospital in Bucharest, with problems of more vital organs caused by pulmonary edema. Păunescu had subsequent renal, liver and heart failure. He was declared dead at 7.15 AM, on 5 November 2010. Survived by his wife and three children, Păunescu was posthumously thanked by Romania's president Traian Băsescu who in saluting him mentioned only his contributions to art.\n\nBooks\n\nUltrasentimente (1965)\n\nMieii primi (1966)\n\nFântâna somnambulă (1968)\n\nCărțile poștale ale morții (1970)\n\nAventurile extraordinare ale lui Hap și Pap (1970)\n\nViata de exceptii (1971)\n\nSub semnul întrebării (1971)\n\nIstoria unei secunde (1971)\n\nLumea ca lume (1973)\n\nRepetabila povară (1974)\n\nPământul deocamdată (1976)\n\nPoezii de până azi (1978)\n\nSub semnul întrebării (1979)\n\nManifest pentru sănătatea pământului (1980)\n\nIubiți-vă pe tunuri (1981)\n\nDe la Bârca la Viena și înapoi (1981)\n\nRezervația de zimbri (1982)\n\nTotuși iubirea (1983)\n\nManifest pentru mileniul trei (1984)\n\nManifest pentru mileniul trei (1986)\n\nLocuri comune (1986)\n\nViața mea e un roman (1987)\n\nÎntr-adevăr (1988)\n\nSunt un om liber (1989)\n\nPoezii cenzurate (1990)\n\nRomaniada (1993–1994)\n\nBieți lampagii (1993–1994)\n\nNoaptea marii beții (1993–1994)\n\nFront fără învingători (1995)\n\nInfracțiunea de a fi (1996)\n\nTragedia națională (1997)\n\nDeromânizarea României (1998)\n\nCartea Cărților de Poezie (1999)\n\nMeserie mizarabilă, sufletul (2000)\n\nMăștile însîngerate (2001)\n\nNemuritor la zidul morții (2001)\n\nPână la capăt (2002)\n\nLiber să sufăr (2003)\n\nDin doi în doi (2003)\n\nEminamente (2003)\n\nCartea Cărților de Poezie (2003)\n\nLogica avalanșei (2005)\n\nAntiprimăvara (2005)\n\nNinsoarea de adio (2005)\n\nUn om pe niște scări (2006)\n\nDe mamă și de foaie verde (2006)\n\nCopaci fără pădure (2006)\n\nVagabonzi pe plaiul mioritic (2007)\n\nRugă pentru părinți (2007)\n\nÎncă viu (2008)"
