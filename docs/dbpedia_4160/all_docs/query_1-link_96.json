        "text": "The 1996 Romanian presidential elections represented the end of the transition to democracy in post-revolutionary Romania, because for the first time, the elections were won by an opposition candidate. The 1996 elections were the third ones, after the Revolution of 1989. During the six years the parties perfected a range of communication techniques so that besides print, television began to play an increasingly role thanks to the appearance of private stations, voters could compare and an incipient form of political culture was materializing. Also, the political spectrum was much more diversified than 1990 or 1992. Therefore, in 1996 the attention is drawn by those candidates who stand out, like Adrian Păunescu, Gheorghe Funar and C.V. Tudor. The three are representing parties which supported the government formed in 1992, but later adopted a political platform which aimed to mobilize those dissatisfied with the living standards, ethnic issues and the lack of authority. Despite declaring their attachment for principles like democracy or the rule of law, a few program elements, speeches and public appearances reveals a different image regarding their political vision."
