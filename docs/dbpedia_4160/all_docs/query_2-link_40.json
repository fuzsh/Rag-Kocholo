        "text": "\"Remember CENACLUL FLACARA - Adrian Paunescu\" is a show made to delight the hearts of lovers of folk music and true poetry, a journey through time designed to recreate the unique atmosphere of the most powerful young and non-conformist cultural movement in Eastern Europe (and not only ), who conquered millions of fans in Romania between 1973 and 1985.\n\nBanned before 1989 by the Romanian authorities for promoting freedom, culture and unfettered thinking, through music, lyrics and dialogue, opposing the censorship and dogmas of the totalitarian era, CENACLUL \"FLACARA\" produced an unprecedented phenomenon, managing to fill entire stadiums from all over Romania, generating shows of record duration, which sometimes lasted as long as ten hours.\n\nIn the first 12 years of activity, 1,615 events took place, with over six million spectators.\n\nAfter the re-establishment, between 1990 and 2010, more than 1,000 performances took place, and after 2010, hundreds of \"Remember CENACLUL FLACARA - Adrian Paunescu\" events took place all over Romania, but also abroad, with hundreds of thousands of participants. CENACLUL \"FLACARA\" was a cultural phenomenon that took place between 1973 and 1985 led by the poet Adrian Paunescu - by unleashing the creative energies of those times, from the poetry composed by Adrian Paunescu himself to the lines recited from the poems of established poets, from the music timidly sung by anonymous debutants, who went on stage for the first time, and even the well-known songs of already established bands or soloists.\n\nCENACLUL \"FLACARA delighted the audience with music starting from popular songs to classical, folk and rock music.\n\nStefan Hrusca, Nicu Alifantis, Mircea Baniciu, Mircea Vintila, Tudor Gheorghe, Vasile Seicaru, Ducu Bertzi, Vali Sterian, Dan Andrei Aldea, Dumitru Farcasu launched or consolidated their careers on the CENACLU stage led by the late poet Adrian Paunescu. . Maria Nagy, Gheorghe Gheorghiu, Mircea Rusu, Andrei Paunescu and many others. The concert halls and stadiums all over the country proved to be insufficient for the multitude of people of all ages, who wanted to take part in this phenomenon, fans of the \"FLACARA\" CENACLU from their youth, prominent representatives of the \"generation in jeans \", or young people who wanted to live what their parents and grandparents enjoyed in the old days, keeping fabulous memories, which they share today with their descendants.\n\nIn the past, the shows gathered thousands of young people. Today, CENACLUL \"FLACARA\" goes on: CENACLUL's generation and the following generations, united through poetry and music, succeed in reviving the spirit of this true phenomenon. The Cenacl performances brought together folk artists and great writers, actors and directors: Nichita Stanescu, Marin Sorescu, Florian Pittis, Amza Pellea, Radu Beligan, Florin Piersic and Stefan Iordache.\n\nAndrei Paunescu returned to Sala Palatului with Remember Cenaclul Flacara - Adrian Paunescu.\n\n45 years after the establishment of the \"FLACARA\" CENACLU, 75 years after the birth of Adrian Paunescu and 100 years after the Great Union, many members of the \"FLACARA\" CENACLU met again for an exceptional event of music, poetry and dialogue, \"Remember CENACLUL FLACARA - Adrian Paunescu\", at the PALACE HALL in BUCHAREST, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2018, 7 PM - event supported by \"COMPUTERLAND ROMANIA\". Thousands of Bucharesters experienced special moments on Saturday night, which reminded them of the music they used to listen to in their youth.\n\nThe artists who were part of the Flacara Cenacl held a concert that evoked the memory of the one who initiated the Cenacl, the poet Adrian Paunescu. The show brought back to the attention of the public, especially among the young people of another time, those who still keep the nostalgia of the spirit of the generation in jeans, the artistic creation of the greatest phenomenon of living culture that appeared in Romania: CENACLUL \"FLACARA\".\n\nThe stage and the audience sang together until late at night, and the event had a special emotional charge, including for the young people who came to the concert in impressive numbers. It was an event of generations, of deep thoughts, of agreements in full harmony with the verse and the word spoken out of dedication and faith in the values ​​of the Romanian nation, which through music, poetry and dialogue, created a show dedicated to the past, the present and the future at the same time.\n\nIt is a baton that the generations of the first events of the \"FLACARA\" CENACLE pass on to the new generations, who, with pride and respect, take it up to carry it on with enthusiasm and pass it on to them.\n\nTime, as if, went backwards when the room, full of young people, sang, in one voice, the texts that far surpassed their age, texts with an extraordinary poetic-emotional charge, almost incomprehensible for the young generation. The palpable need of young people for lyricism, the Romanian language, inner beauty and openness to another form of manifestation was felt. \"The cenacle was like a factory for making songs.\n\nThere were years of revolt and live performances, and that's why I went. We all walked around in jeans from morning to night, we slept in jeans, we were still in jeans on stage\" - Vasile Seicaru. And yet, folk music has a future, it is a kind of living music, it has not entered a cone of shadow, and the old troubadours still fill performance halls to the brim, because they received the recognition of the public, of YOUNG PEOPLE.\n\nIt is in our power to bring them all, together, towards the great culture: the young people of one era and the young people of another era.\n\n\"Anyway, despite the suffering, humiliation and scheduled death, I'm lucky, I'm an anthological case, I'm spoiled. Survive. And I write. And I forgive. And I love And I hope. And it seems to me that I could take it, anytime, all over again.\" Adrian Paunescu - \"Free to suffer\"."
