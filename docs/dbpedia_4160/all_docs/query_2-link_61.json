        "text": "BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Adrian Paunescu, Romania's most famous poet — a\n\nman who praised the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu yet remained popular among\n\nRomanians — has died at the age of 67.\n\nThe Floreasca Emergency Hospital in Bucharest said Paunescu died Friday\n\nmorning from multiple organ failure. His last poem was written Oct. 31 from\n\nhis hospital bed.\n\nPaunescu, physically huge and a prolific writer, was larger-than-life\n\ncharacter who appeared on television several times a week.\n\nDuring the communist era, he wrote flattering poems about Ceausescu. Critics\n\nsaid the poems contributed to the dictator's personality cult.\n\nStill, Paunescu's sentimental verse struck a chord with many Romanians.\n\nDozens of mourners began gathering at his house in Bucharest as news of his\n\ndeath spread. They lit candles and left flowers and Romanian flags. Paunescu\n\nwill lie in state later Friday for mourners to pay their respects.\n\nRomanian President Traian Basescu sent condolences, thanking Paunescu for\n\nhelping a generation of young artists but not mentioning his involvement in\n\npolitics. There was an outpouring of sorrow from cultural and political\n\nfigures, as well.\n\nDuring the anti-communist revolt in 1989, in which more than 1,000 people\n\nwere killed, it was reported that Paunescu tried to seek refuge at the U.S.\n\nEmbassy to escape angry protesters. It was not clear whether he was unable\n\nto get in or decided to abandon his efforts.\n\nHe was best known for his poetry about love and death — and even football.\n\nHis verse could be at time mawkish and melancholy, which suited the Romanian\n\npsyche.\n\nPaunescu was born in 1943 in the Soviet Union, in what is now Moldova, and\n\nmoved to Romania as a child. His father was a political prisoner under\n\ncommunism in Romania , which initially led to Paunescu having problems\n\ngetting into university."
