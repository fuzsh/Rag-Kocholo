The question of reunification is recurrent in the public sphere of the two countries, often as a speculation, both as a goal and a danger. Though historically Romanian support for unification was high, a March 2022 survey following the Russian invasion of Ukraine indicated that only 11% of Romania's population supports an immediate union, while over 42% think it is not the right moment.",

However, support in Moldova for reunification has increased significantly, with polls asking \"if a referendum took place next Sunday regarding the unification of the Republic of Moldova and Romania, would you vote for or against the unification?\" rising from approximately 20% to 44% support from 2015 to 2022. Support for unification with Romania is much lower in Transnistria and Gagauzia than in the rest of Moldova."
