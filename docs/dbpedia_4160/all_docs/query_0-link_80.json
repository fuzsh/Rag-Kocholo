        "text": "This chapter deals with spiritual life in the Stone Age, briefly in the Upper Paleolithic period, in more detail in the Neolithic and Eneolithic. The chapter deals with some paintings and engravings from caves, such as the engraving of a mysterious creature with part of the human body part of the animal body from the cave of Les Combarelles (France). This engraving could prove a belief in the unity of man and animal. The important grave of a shaman, the sorcerer from Brno, Francouzská Street was mentioned, which included, among other things, a puppet of a man from ivory. Some unique ceramic statuettes of animals from the locality Dolní Věstonice and Pavlov (South Moravia) were intentionally damaged. The parts of these statuettes could be used in hunting rituals. So called command staffs have a number of explanations. Their use as drumsticks for ritual drums cannot be excluded. The hole against the handle could be used to \"banish the evil forces\". It is a epoch of religious ideas that can be classified as animism, animatism and demonism. These religious ideas survive to the Neolithic, when these religious wayif thinking evolve into a period of prototheism. Remarkable is a small ritual vessel in the shape of a goat but with a human face. Numerous ceramic anthropomorphic statuettes and images on vessels of the Linear Pottery culture were described (Vedrovice), and especially the female statues of the Moravian - East-Austrian group of Painted Pottery culture from Moravia, which were anonymously depicted as idols of the cult of fruitfullness and fertility. Anthropomorphic vessels could also be used for rituals. Described is a vessel depicting a woman with miniature containers in hands from the settlement Těšetice-Kyjovice, where the rondel was excavated. Kernos and pseudokernos (Střelice, Hluboké Mašůvky, Moravia etc.) could also be used for rituals. Interestingly, there is evidence of the use of masks in religious ceremonies (eg Liubcova, Banat; Uivar, Romania). Significant is the discovery of a simple rondel as a multifunctional gathering place at Prašník, Piešťany District (south-west Slovakia). Between the entrances facing the cardinal points, there are three large features (4 x 3 = 12) in each quadrant along the inner edge of the ditch. Four are also seasons. What are the 12 great features (12 months or something else)? The Eneolithic is characterized by the transformation of Neolithic prototheism into the earliest period of polytheism. Some statuettes were made including details such as clothing or body ornaments. It is possible that they already depict goddesses, priestesses (eg Vesnus of Hluboké Mašůvky) and priests or chiefs. There are also very rich graves of chiefs with copper pectorals (Štramberk-Kotouč, Moravia; Velvary, Bohemia) and tiaras (Vörs, Hungary). 56 Rituális tevékenység az újkőkorban és a rézkorban Szlovákia területén célra, különleges alkalmak során használták. Sámánok alkalomszerűen használhatták a föld alatti rejtett helyeket. Talán olyan szertartásokat végeztek itt, amelyet nem szántak az egész közösségnek. A szikla-vagy földhasadékok és a barlangok nem csak szimbolikus, de valóságos átjárók a föld alatti világba, és mint ilyen, szakralizált hellyé vált (Pavlů-Zápotocká 2007, 61). A természet ciklusainak misztikumát tükrözték a bonyolult rítusok, melynek során véres és vértelen áldozatot ajánlottak fel a természeti isteneknek. Feltételezhető, hogy az indoeurópai mitológia, mágia és vallás eredete a neolitikumban gyökerezik. Ez volt az időszaka sok isten születésének és halálának. Hamarosan megformálódott a gondolata a Magna Mater típusú, földanya és termékenység istennőknek. A rézkorban a \"szent hit\" fokozatosan átváltozik egy korai politeizmusba (sokistenhitbe), és a menny-föld és alvilág hármassága kezd kikristályosodni. A vegetatív típusú természeti istenek tiszteletére ren-dezett szertartásokat talán rendszeresen megtartották a természet újjászületésekor vagy a mezőgazda-sági munkák kezdésekor tavasszal. A rondellákban talán az égitestek megfigyelésével határozták meg a szertartások időpontját (. Ezeknek a szertartásoknak fontos szereplői voltak a sámánok. A modern gondolkodás számára a bemutatott rituális tevékenységek példái talán különösek és kegyet-lenek, de ezek mélyen gyökereznek az őskori emberek gondolatvilágában és visszatükrözik a társadalom-ról és az őket körülvevő világról alkotott gondolataikat.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to explain totems and their roles in the lives of the Persians. The method used for gathering data was based on field research and library reference. Totemism is one of the main forms of the preliminary religions that manifested itself in the development of human mind and belief. The ancient man used to enjoy the language of nature, and he responded to the world through his dreams or totems. The ancient man knew that he was beyond human being. For instance, he believed that his ancestor was an animal that could die and then return to the life once again. In its old form, the human societies used to worship the animal’s dead body or a plant that manifested that society’s nature of existence. This is what anthropology intended to discuss throughout history. A totem is a sacred object or symbol that represents a group of people or a clan. In the Iranian culture and mythology, the evidence of totemism is present. Thus, such signs appeared in the epics of the nat...\n\nWe now have a series of early Neolithic sites in central and south- east Turkey, north and west Syria, Israel and Jordan that have produced fascinating imagery, enigmatic sculptures, monumental architecture and much evidence of elaborate ritual behaviours: and we also have a great deal of new research in the fi elds of cognitive and evolutionary psychology. My concern has been to bring some of these new cognitive and co- evolutionary ideas into contact with the new archaeological material (Watkins 2004a , 2004b , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 , 2010a , 2010b , 2012 , 2015 ; Sterelny & Watkins 2015 ). In particular, I want to explore how the impressive displays of symbolism and ritual performance that emerged as part of this great social transformation functioned in the context of the new, large, permanent communities that created them. I shall argue that the extraordinary levels of symbolism in architecture, artefacts and ritual functioned in the service of the construction and sustenance of a new and extraordinary kind of community and identity. (In Ritual, Play and Belief in Early Human Societies, eds. C. Renfrew, I. Morley & M. Boyd Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.)\n\nThe aim of this paper is to discuss the meaning of 'special burials' to contribute to our understanding of prehistoric burial rite and concepts of the afterlife. Especially an omnipresent model explaining deviant burials with fearing and banishing the dead, Totenangst and Totenbann, serves as starting ground of the thoughts presented. Consulting only the conspicuous aberrant feature means to assume with tacit understanding that the archaeological record depicts a general rule of rather simplified behavior. That there are many reasons for possible infringements of the norm, that sometimes even 'the norm' needs to be questioned, is demonstrated with a number of examples and with the help of ethnographic analogies. It can hardly be negated, that there are indeed sometimes burials which stand out by their unique and most remarkable way of how the deceased were treated. The role of amulets in burial ritual is also analyzed in the course of this study. Within several graves, even those emptied some time after the burial, a number of objects were found. Especially the heart- and crescent-shaped pendants, a find group rather common and widely spread in the Early and Middle Bronze Age attracts our attention. Recognizing them as stylized anthropomorphic depictions and linking them to contemporary idols and figurines emphasizes their supposed significance in cultic activity, particularly an apotropaic role. The frequent appearance of these pendants in hoards does not only underline this cultic interpretation (recognizing at least some of these hoards as offerings through which the objects are entrusted to a numinous sphere as well) but also draws another close line between burials and depositions and the related concepts behind both.\n\nThe Necropolis of Chirnogi-Suvita Iorgulescu (Calarasi county) was located on the high terrace of the Danube and was investigated by Done Serbanescu (in 1989) by means of the archaeological excavations carried out for the construction of the Danube-Bucharest Channel. For this study, we analysed the archaeological assemblage preserved in the Museum of Gumelnita civilization from Oltenita (Calarasi county) coming from 10 graves, out of a total of 58, which are attributed to the Gumelnita culture (the second half of the 5 th millennium BC). The personal adornments are mainly bracelets made of Spondylus valve (16 specimens) which appear in most of the graves, along with an equal number of perforated plates made of Sus scrofa canine, this time the pieces being grouped into two graves. The funeral inventory is complemented by small cylindrical, tubular or biconvex beads, made of various raw materials: Spondylus valve, bone, malachite, coop-er and green slate. At the technical level, attention is drawn towards the technological transformation scheme of the raw material, which is extremely uniform for the two main categories of ornaments. Also, the analysed pieces showed different degrees of use-wear, demonstrating on the one hand that they were worn before the deposition in graves, and on the other that the accumulation of these items took place over time."
