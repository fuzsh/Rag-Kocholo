        "meta_description": "A valid e-vignette for the correct toll-rate category is mandatory for all motor vehicles with a maximum permissible weight of up to 3500 kilograms when entering a toll road. This means that the e-vignette must be paid for before you enter the motorway or expressway. You can easily buy an e-vignette from the comfort of your living room in our online shop in a quick and simple way. E-vignettes can also be purchased at Dars points of sale, DarsGo services, or at authorised dealers.",

        "text": "Bank transfer (only for registered customers):\n\nPurchase with a quotation\n\nand bank transfer\n\nRegistered customers have an option to buy one or more e-vignettes with a quotation and bank transfer payment. The customer will receive a quotation containing complete payment information by email.\n\nImmediately valid e-vignettes cannot be purchased with a quotation. The earliest possible start date of the e-vignette validity in this case is four working days from the quotation date, since the e-vignette only becomes valid when Dars receives the payment in its transaction account and links it to the quotation. In this case, the e-vignette becomes valid on the date selected by the customer in the purchase process. The customer has access to the invoice and proof of the e-vignette purchase through the user account in the online shop.\n\nThe quotation validity period is given in the quotation. If the quotation is not paid in time, it is cancelled and any payments received after the quotation expires will be returned to the customer’s bank account, minus the refund processing costs. Refund processing costs are provided in the DARS price list.\n\nMake sure you enter a correct reference number and the payment amount when paying with a bank transfer. If you provide an incorrect reference number, your payment may not be linked to your quotation in time and your e-vignettes will not be created. Your e-vignettes will also not be created if you enter an incorrect payment amount.\n\n1. Enter the CORRECT country of registration and the registration number of the vehicle for which you are buying an e-vignette.\n\nPlease carefully check all the entered information again before confirming the purchase. If the information is incorrect and does not match the vehicle registration number, the toll will not be paid, which is an offence under the Road Tolling Act, with an imposed fine of 300 EUR.\n\n2. Select the CORRECT toll-rate category for the vehicle for which you are buying an e-vignette.\n\nIf you buy an e-vignette for the wrong toll-rate category, the toll will not be paid, which is an offence under the Road Tolling Act, with an imposed fine of 300 EUR. If you are not sure about the toll class of your vehicle, use the tool for determining the vehicle toll class or check the list of measured vehicles."
