        "text": "Round 1 of the Invited Celebrity Classic teed off from Las Colinas Country Club in Irving today where 78 PGA Tour professionals played alongside 40 celebrities that included former Cowboys Tony Romo, Emmitt Smith and DeMarcus Ware, former Rangers Ivan “Pudge” Rodriguez and Derek Holland, former Stars goalie Marty Turco, and a number of other Hall of Fame sports names like Albert Pujols, Greg Maddux, Joe Carter and more.\n\nThe Classic is an officially sanctioned PGA and Charles Schwab Cup event that features a prize purse of $2.2 million, among the largest pro purses outside of the major championships, as well as a $500,000 celebrity prize purse. The format of the tournament has the Tour professionals playing 54 holes of stroke play and the celebs using Modified Stableford scoring, where the highest point total wins.\n\nTennis player Mardy Fish (37 points) and former LPGA pro Annika Sorenstam (35) sit in the top two spots after Day 1, with a gaggle of players that includes former pitcher John Smoltz tied for third.\n\nTony Romo, the tournament’s defending champion paired up with former Masters champ Vijay Singh, sits in a tie for seventh at 33 points with another former pitcher, Derek Lowe. The next local celeb would be Marty Turco, tied at 18th with 27 points.\n\n“I hit the ball pretty good,” Romo said after his round. “Three-putted way too many times. ... It’s probably the fastest greens — the course is in great condition and you just don’t play on greens like this consistently at this time of the year right now around here. Feel like it took a little while for me to get the pace down. But I hit a lot of greens, hitting the ball well, I think it’s gonna be a good weekend.\n\nUnfortunately, clear at the bottom of the celeb list, sits Cowboys Ring of Honor member DeMarcus Ware, who would’ve finished dead last if not for another player’s withdrawal. Just ahead of Ware in 38th place sits Derek Holland, and in 37th is blue-collar comedian Larry the Cable Guy. So at least Ware and Holland can have a few laughs, if the cellar-dwellers are grouped together for Round 2.\n\nSee the full Celebrity Classic leaderboard here.\n\nTwitter: @SportsDayDFW\n\nFor more sports coverage from The Dallas Morning News, click here."
