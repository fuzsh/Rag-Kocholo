        "text": "Dear Friends,\n\nImagine this: You are the one of the top-10 players in tennis, and the country knows your name and worships you. Your game has never been better, and you are getting complimented by everyone on your skills. People think you have what it takes to be a champion. In addition, you have a beautiful wife who is there for you, supporting your dream career. To an outsider, your life is seemingly perfect, but on the inside… your life is a nightmare that you are wishing to wake up from.\n\nThis is the story of Mardy Fish, one of America’s most skilled and talented professional tennis players. In 2012 he suddenly walked away from the U.S. Open, and from his professional tennis career in general. Why did he walk away? Mardy Fish, like millions of others, suffered greatly from anxiety. His anxiety, resulting in panic attacks that would even occur on the tennis court, caused him to find his only comfort in the fact that he could stop playing tennis and go home, where he was able to work on his mental health exclusively.\n\nFish’s anxiety stemmed from some heart problems he had. Although they were corrected by a procedure, the fear remained in his mind and prevented him from being able to go through his normal tasks. Due to his anxiety, his career was put on hold. To this day he only plays a game of tennis now and again, which is incredibly different than the tournaments that he used dedicate himself to. Fish is quoted on ESPN as saying “If I never had any mental issues, there’s no doubt in my mind that I’d still be playing.”\n\nhttps://crackbillionair.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/usa-tennis-blake-and-fish-dropping-like-stones/\n\nDespite his distance from the tennis world and the struggle that Fish has gone through, reading his story was able to inspire me and make me feel that he has gained far more than he has lost. He is able to live as an example of somebody who suffers from anxiety and panic attacks for people who might not understand that they can truly happen to anyone. Instead of staying in the shadows of his career, he is using his experiences to tell a story to the world about the power of anxiety. Anxiety is not something small that is easy to overcome. It is something strong enough to consume a tennis hero’s body and rip away his career. It creeps into every corner of your life and consumes all that you have worked for. Still, I argue that this is not a completely sad story.\n\nIn his interviews, Fish goes onto explain the power of therapy, medication, and relaxation techniques. After walking away from the U.S. Open in 2012 and struggling, due to panic attacks, to even return home with his wife, he spent three months in his house, afraid of going out due to the frequency of his attacks. It was then that he spent a lot of time seeing psychiatrist, talking through his fears and anxieties. He also was given medication to soothe his internal demons, which is a common treatment for anxiety and panic disorders. In addition, he began using golf as an outlet for his stress, giving himself a way to relax and naturally calm his anxieties.\n\nI think it is incredibly important for someone like Mardy Fish to speak out about anxiety and panic disorder and to show the world that something like that can happen to anyone, even a world-class athlete. In addition, it is inspirational that he was able to speak about the help and treatment that he has received. As a person who struggles with anxiety, reading about Fish’s life helped to remind me that there is help out there for everyone. If I ever get to a state where I need more help from a doctor, there is help available and I should never feel ashamed to do so. I encourage all of you out there who are struggling with this issue or anything similar to look at your situation, think about what could be better, and go out there and give yourself the gift of receiving help to get your life where you want it to be. Talk to your parents or other loved ones or friends to get help seeing a therapist or a doctor (see my previous post all about opening up to parents). Read my blog or other resources to give you tips on different activities that can help you to de-stress and control your anxiety, in the same way that golf works for Mardy Fish. Most importantly, remember that no matter what you are going through, there is always going to be someone out there going through something similar. There is always going to be someone who can understand every detail of your problems without even knowing what is causing them. I hope that you will take that, and, when you feel ready, share your own story to help spread the world about these issues and to make people feel less alone. Write in the comments, in the forums, on social media, on your own blog. Talk to friends, coworkers, family members, strangers! Make art, write poetry, write a book, sing a song. Do what Fish has done, and help to spread the word about the horrible monster that is anxiety.\n\nI am here for you, and this is a safe place.\n\nErica"
