He went out into the streets of Water ford and Dublin proclaiming his confidence. The underwriters, the insurers of the galley, were not slow to profit by the talkative ness of the garrulous captain. They claimed that he had constituted sufficient doubt to exempt them from paying compensation under this condition of uncertainty. The Law loomed large. But one Mr. 'Thompson, representative of the underwriters, more fearful of legal avarice than of parting with the more limited compensation, pleaded for arbitration. The parties agreed and a meeting was called. Six men representing the shippers and six the underwriters, with an independent chairman, met in solemn conclave. The case was heard before them. It proved a triumph for Messrs. Ferris, Twigg & Cash, for as a result of the judgment the insurance was paid in full. The experience of arbitration thus gained was to stand them good stead at a later and more important day All these activities were to have their being under the title \"The Ouzel Galley Society.\" This Society first saw the light in 1705, with Tracy*, as reward of loyalty, its first captain.\n\n*The names of the first two Captains of the Society are ascertained from W. H. G. Kingston who states in his preface that the log was owned by Captain Massey whose greatgrandfather had been in the mercantile service. It was then ascertained that this was the actual Massey spoken of in his book as captain of the galley. If his name is correct then it maybe considered as fairly certain that Captain Tracy's name is also correct. It may be well to note that the names Tracy and Massey were unlikely names for an English writer to have given to two Irish seamen if they were not those of actual people.\n\nThe Ouzel Galley, Old Dublin Society, Special Issue Vol.3, no.2, p. 9,11,20\n\nThe Missing Ship or The Log of the \"Ouzel\" Galley: William Henry Giles Kingston (1814-1880) [Online Book]\n\n1749 Secretaries of State: State Papers Foreign, France SP 78\n\nPetition for release of Susanna Tracy.

In 1790, in response to John Hobsons challenge to the return of John Egan, the House of Commons ordered a new election in which Egan (who ran contrary of the dukes interest) was successfully returned: HIP, ii, 3445.\n\nJohn Towell, John Courtney, and Daniel Tracy were deemed guilty of gross contempt by the House of Commons arising out of the inquiry into the contested election petition in respect of the borough of Tallagh, because, in the case of Towell and Courtney, they not only failed to respond to the summons to attend to give evidence to the committee appointed to determine the petition, but also evaded the efforts of the serjeant at arms to capture them. Daniel Tracy, who attended the committee hearings for several days before absenting himself without permission, likewise evaded the serjeant at arms: Commons Journal, xiv. 389.\n\nKelly, James & Lyons, Mary Ann (2014) The Proclamations Of Ireland 16601820.

Death deprived the community of three or four members in little more than the space of a year. As might be expected, with such little help in school, the children were not up to the standard required by the results' programme, which came into operation in or about this time. The Mother Prioress who had charge of the community at this period was M. Clare Treacy (sister to the three Fathers Treacy, late of this diocese), a person of great prudence and foresight ; she wisely determined on seeking subjects more capable of school work. After fervent prayer she succeeded in a short time in getting postulants who were both classified teachers and most desirous of entering the Carmelite Order.

Patrick Tracy, of the diocese of Waterford, Ireland, died recently, aged seventy-three years. He was ordained in 1837, and up to 1848 was connected with the parish of Trinity Without, Waterford, as a zealous and devoted missionary curate. He took an active and earnest interest in the 1848 movement, and was intimately associated with the late General T. F. Meagher, on which occasion, fortunately, his great influence over the masses saved that city from a sanguinary conflict, as the rescue of Meagher on the morning of his arrest was fully determined. In other parishes of the diocese he was distinguished for his zeal and charities, and had been a hard-working priest for nearly fifty years.\n\n[Thomas Francis Meaghers arrest] With the assistance, however, of the Rev. Mr. Tracy, who sat upon the box of the chaise, some order was restored, and the harness replaced.

(I believe) Father Tracy. The men came to him, Tracy did not. On his asking them to march, they said they could not without Father Tracy s advice and consent. Too late then to look for it, or to muster the club-men. Meagher not encouraged to wait. This Tracy, I afterwards understood, was the Byrne of Waterford Primum Mobile and chief adviser of the clubs, though not personally presiding over any club himself.

Smith refers to it as \"Pilltown, not long since the estate of the Walshes\". The house is labelled Pilltown House on the 25-inch map of the 1890s. It is no longer extant. Tracy is noted as the owner of over 450 acres in county Waterford in the 1870s. A substantial mill, valued at £39, in the same townland was being leased by Peter Moore Fisher [X129800]. It was included in the sale of Fisher property in the Landed Estates Court in November 1865. The mill appears to have fallen into disuse by the end of the nineteenth century though the ruins remain.\n\nhttp://landedestates.nuigalway.ie:8080/LandedEstates/jsp/property-show.jsp?id=4371\n\nDaisybank House, Cheekpoint, Faithlegg, Waterford\n\nIn 1848, Patrick Tracy was leasing this property from the Power estate when it was valued at over £18.

(By Michael Cavanagh)...November 9th 1861... As our little party of Irish-Americans were preparing to start from the Shelboume Hotel, on this loving mission, it was unexpectedly reinforced by another exiled pilgrim- Mr. Kelly, a native of Waterford, but for many years a resident of Manchester. Having signified his intention of forming a delegation of one from his expatriated countrymen in Manchester, he had been furnished with a letter of introduction to me by a dearly beloved townsrnan of mine, the Rev. John Tracey, who felt confident that it would ensure the bearer a cordial reception. It not only fulfilled its object so far, but caused were old acquaintances, linked together by the mutual friendship we entertained for the patriot priest. When I left my old home, twelve years before, John Tracy was one of a band of Cappoquin boys, studying at the celebrated school of Melleray, several of whom have since become distinguished ornaments of the Irish missionary church celebrated alike for their efiiciency and zeal in propagating the faith in foreign lands, and for their loving devotion to their own dear isle My dear friend, Father John Tracy, with a happier fate than any, died whilst on a visit to the home of his boyhood, and is blessed with a grave in front of the altar where he served Mass years before, and where the prayers of his people are surer to be perpetually offered up for his pure spirits eternal repose\n\n17 September 1864 (N) O'Brien Monument Committee\n\n...Rev.

Tracy, at Heaton Norris, to present him with an address of affection expressing their regret at the separation, and wishing him happiness and success in the new mission to which he has been recently appointed by the Bishop. Accompanying the address was a purse of gold.

In 1867, after a most dubious trial, they were executed for their part in a successful ambush to free two Irish-American Fenian leaders Thomas Kelly and Timothy Deasy leaders from a prison van in which a policeman was shot dead. The Fenian leaders were not only freed but also spirited out of the country to New York, despite a £300 reward for their capture, about six times the average annual salary. Among those who helped Kelly escape were a Dr Kelly of Oxford Road and a Fr Tracy, evidence that Fenian sympathies were not just the preserve of the low Irish as the English press depicted the working-class Irish. Thomas Kelly on the run in the Cheetham Hill area, where he escaped from the police by changing clothes with a Father Tracey, before being taken to Liverpool by a Fenian who drove for a wine and spirit merchant. Concealed among the cases of wine he was delivered into friendly hands who assisted him to board a ship.\n\n1851 Return of Sums allocated by Treasury for Promotion of Arterial Drainage\n\nDaniel Tracey, Decies within Drum Waterford, £92/5/4\n\n1851 Census Extracts - Waterford\n\n27 Market St.\n\nEgan or Ryan, Robert, 26, nm.\n\nTreacy, Johanna, 48, mother, widow, Tipperary\n\nGough, Ellen, Servant\n\n1851\n\n86 on map, John Treacy & Honora Cleary, Ballyduffe East [Kilmeadan Waterford?], 0a/1r/10p, £1.0.0 rent, £2.5.0 valuation, from year to year, determinable every 29th September\n\n1854 Sessional Papers\n\n31 Dec 1851 Teachers\n\nWaterford\n\nM.
