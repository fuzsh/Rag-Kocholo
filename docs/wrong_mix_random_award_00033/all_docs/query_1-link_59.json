        "text": "Mardy Fish used to like it when his heart beat fast. It meant he was working hard. It meant\n\nhe was suffering—the kind of suffering that had always been a key ingredient in his\n\ntennis success and had made him the seventh-ranked player in the world as recently\n\nas last summer. In fact, in the past, as the temperature got higher, the air thicker,\n\nand the overall conditions more grueling, Fish, a central Florida native, believed\n\nhis chances of winning increased. That’s why he’s always loved playing in Washington\n\nin the dead of summer, as he will again ten days from now at the Citi Open (formerly\n\nthe Legg Mason Tennis Classic). “Playing in that kind of heat is not just about being\n\nfit,” says Fish. “It’s about convincing yourself you like it more than the other guy,\n\nand pushing your body farther than you think it will go.”\n\nBut this winter, Fish’s body pushed back. And it wasn’t an elbow or a knee, as it\n\nso often is for tennis players. It was his heart. The very organ sportswriters had\n\ncited for years as Fish’s most valuable weapon was betraying him.\n\nIt started in February, while Fish, 30, was playing for the United States Davis Cup\n\nteam in Switzerland. He awoke in the middle of the night with his heart beating upward\n\nof 170 beats per minute. He banged on the door of his trainer’s hotel room seeking\n\nguidance. His trainer had none. Fish would win a five-set match the following day\n\nas the US defeated Roger Federer’s Swiss squad, but he was too freaked out to celebrate.\n\nHe flew home to Los Angeles, and the episodes continued. He became so frightened by\n\nthe periodic and unexplained palpitations that he eventually became unwilling to sleep\n\nanywhere except in his own bed. This is a problem for a peripatetic pro tennis player.\n\nFish was eventually diagnosed with a heart arrhythmia. In March he underwent a procedure\n\nknown as a cardiac catheter ablation to correct it. Doctors, guided by x-rays and\n\nMRIs, threaded a wire through a vein in Fish’s groin up to his heart, where they located\n\nand cauterized the source area of the rogue electrical impulse.\n\nIf it sounds scary, I assure you it is. I had the same procedure last February.\n\nThe arrhythmia that affected me is known as atrial fibrillation (a-fib, for short).\n\nLike Mardy’s, occasionally and without warning my heart would start to flutter. There\n\nwas no pain involved. In fact, doctors assured me the condition itself was not life-threatening.\n\nIt is, however, extremely disconcerting. During an a-fib episode, blood flow to one’s\n\nlungs, brain, and other vital organs can be reduced by as much as 30 percent. A person\n\nin such a state might get winded from walking up a single flight of stairs, as I did\n\nin the WUSA newsroom one night in 2009—the night I discovered something was wrong.\n\nI took a pass on the sportscast that night and drove with one of our producers to\n\nGeorgetown Hospital. A simple EKG revealed the arrhythmia. They explained this was\n\nlikely not the first time I had experienced an episode (they sometimes resolve themselves\n\nwithout medical intervention), and that it would most certainly not be the last. They\n\ntried to restore my normal rhythm that night with a series of drugs, but when none\n\nworked, they opted to perform a cardioversion. That is to say, they shocked me. (I\n\nassume someone said “Clear” before zapping me with the paddles, but I was unconscious\n\nat the time. Cardioversion is not something you want to be awake for.)\n\nFor the next two years, I experienced a-fib episodes periodically. There is no medical\n\nexplanation for why they occur. There is no genetic mapping that explains why some\n\npeople’s hearts generate these occasional rogue electrical currents. One thing doctors\n\ndo know is that in people who have the condition, episodes can be triggered by excessive\n\nalcohol, caffeine, and stress. I began to limit the first two of those from my life,\n\nbut given my line of work, there wasn’t much I could do about the third.\n\nThe same went for Fish.\n\nI found a regimen of drugs that limited the frequency of the a-fib episodes, but,\n\nas predicted by my doctors, I slowly developed a resistance to those drugs, and the\n\nfrequency of the episodes increased again. That’s when the catheter ablation became\n\nthe only choice.\n\nMy surgeons at Washington Hospital Center read me the statistics they are legally\n\nobliged to convey. They are the same ones Mardy Fish undoubtedly heard as he was preparing\n\nfor the procedure—that cardiac catheter ablations have a one percent mortality rate.\n\nWhat?\n\nThey assured me these statistics included all outcomes on a national level, including\n\nfar less sophisticated hospitals, far less experienced doctors, and far older and\n\nsicker patients. Okay, but still, are you telling me one in a hundred who have this\n\nthing . . . eat it? I inquired if there were any other remedies that were—how shall\n\nwe say—less deadly. I considered just continuing to live with the condition. Heck,\n\nI can deal with 70 percent of my normal blood flow. It beats the crap out of zero\n\npercent.\n\nOf course, 70 percent of normal blood flow doesn’t cut it when you’re a professional\n\nathlete, and so assuming Mardy Fish wanted to continue being one, he had no real choice.\n\nFish had the ablation in March, and with due respect to the good people on Wall Street,\n\nthis millionaire was quite happy to be part of the 99 percent.\n\nFish returned to the tennis court at Wimbledon last month, where he reached the fourth\n\nround. He says he is still nervous about the condition coming back. Cardiac ablations\n\nare only 75 to 80 percent effective on the first go-around. Depending upon how things\n\nproceed, he may yet need another one. The procedure itself is less than 20 years old,\n\nand much of the long-range data is still being compiled.\n\nHere’s what I told Mardy when we compared notes last month: that I am now 18 months\n\nremoved from my ablation, and the arrhythmia has never returned. Not once. I take\n\nno drugs and I see no doctors for it (other than an annual visit to a cardiologist,\n\nwhich, for a guy in his forties, isn’t such a bad idea, regardless of your cardiac\n\nhistory.) He sounded encouraged by this report, though still understandably apprehensive.\n\nSo if you go to the Citi Open in Rock Creek Park the week after next and the top-seeded\n\nFish happens to lose a match he was expected to win, perhaps you will resist the urge\n\nto question his heart. He’ll be questioning it plenty on his own."
