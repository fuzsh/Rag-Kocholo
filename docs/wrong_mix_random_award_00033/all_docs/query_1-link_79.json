        "text": "When Mardy Fish approached the net for the last post-match handshake of his professional career Wednesday, his opponent, Feliciano Lopez, quietly told him: “You deserved to win. You were the better player.’’\n\nThat, unfortunately, did Fish no good, because the Louis Armstrong Stadium scoreboard read this in Lopez’s favor: 2-6, 6-3, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3.\n\n“He deserved to win,’’ Lopez said later. “He was serving for the match. I was one game away from being in the showers.’’\n\nNow Fish — who announced at the beginning of the summer the US Open would be the final tournament of his career — was heading for the showers for one final time, unable to capitalize on being one set up and serving for the match at 5-4 in the fourth to carry his remarkable story into the third round.\n\nFish’s career — repeatedly interrupted by both physical and psychological issues — is over, but it is over on his terms. At 33, he’s the same age as the man who defeated him Wednesday and as Serena Williams, who won her second-round match Wednesday on her attempted march to a Grand Slam.\n\n“My body gave out,’’ Fish said, referring to leg cramps that debilitated him in the fifth and final set, “and that’s why I’m stopping.’’\n\nThe end was perfectly fitting in that the 3 hours and 11 minutes on Armstrong against Lopez represented a microcosm of Fish’s career:\n\nThere was promise.\n\nThere was drama.\n\nThere was an injury.\n\nThere was a failure to break through when opportunity presented itself.\n\nAnd in the end, Fish fell short.\n\nIt is cruel to rain on a man’s career on the day it ends, and that is not the intention here. But if we’re being honest, Fish’s career cannot be described as one that completely fulfilled its potential.\n\nThe high-water moment was becoming the top-ranked American player in 2011, when he elevated to No. 7 in world rankings.\n\nBut, playing in an era when American men’s tennis was not exactly striking fear into the rest of the world, being the top-ranked American men’s tennis player was — and still is — somewhat like being labeled the best middle reliever in the Mets’ bullpen.\n\nFish never had a sniff of a Grand Slam title. He won six times in his career, but his record in tournament finals was 6-14.\n\nMost admirable about Fish was the way he has fought an anxiety disorder that afflicted him when he reached his peak as a player.\n\nThe low point for him came at the 2012 US Open when he was scheduled to play Roger Federer in the third round and could not bring himself to walk onto the court, withdrawing for what was described at the time as “health reasons.’’\n\nOnce Fish went from an off-the-radar player to one on the rise in the rankings, panic attacks began to rule his life.\n\n“Expectations changed and pressure was a lot higher and a lot more on myself and from others,’’ Fish said. “That was the position that I wanted to be in — the top American, top 10 in the world and sort of a marked man. It was too much for me to handle.’’\n\nSince he got help, Fish has become open about his anxiety disorder and determined to let his story help others.\n\nFish’s first-round win Monday marked his first US Open match since he withdrew from that Federer match three years ago. Even in disappointing defeat, there was a sense of accomplishment by merely playing in one more US Open.\n\nAs Lopez stated so honestly, Fish should have won Wednesday’s match. Fish was serving for the match leading 5-4 in the fourth set and lost that service game at love.\n\n“I figured that was my opportunity,’’ Fish said. “[I] didn’t pick a great time to play the worst game I played all day. Once that had sort of came and gone, I knew I was sort of in trouble because of the way my legs felt. [But] I wasn’t quitting. You would have had to carry me off the court.’’\n\nOn July 22, Fish sent out this message on his Twitter account: “My schedule this summer will be Atlanta, Cincinnati, and I will finish my career at the US Open. ‪#lastride’’\n\nThat #lastride came to an abrupt and perhaps premature end Wednesday. But Fish left the grounds for the final time as a player feeling the emotions of one final hashtag: #satisfied."
