        "text": "SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Nev. — Former tennis player Mardy Fish birdied nine of his final 13 holes Saturday to take a seven-point lead into the final round of the American Century Championship celebrity golf tournament. Fish, the 2020 champion, had a 34-point round at Edgewood Tahoe under the modified Stableford scoring system to reach 57. Players receive a point for par, three for birdie and six for eagle and two points are deducted for double bogey or worse. NHL player Joe Pavelski was second after a 29-point day. Carolina Panthers receiver Adam Thielen — the first-round leader, a one point ahead of Fish — was third at 45 after scoring 21 points. Charles Barkley was tied for 52nd with three points after a zero-point day."
