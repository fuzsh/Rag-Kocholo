I am dependent on many, and I want to acknowledge some of those shoulders on which I stood while preparing this book. It is likely that when the ﬁrst major league pitch was thrown, a scribe was present to chronicle the event and chart the result on a card. Those chronicles and scorecards form the basis of our journey into baseball history. And the moment the scribes discovered that the public deeply cared about the lives of those with the skill “to urge the ﬂying ball,” as the poet Gray put it, Sporting Life, National Police Gazette and ultimately Sporting News arrived to provide a weekly compilation of the news, opinion and gossip the public craved. These weeklies contain many a nugget for the researcher, and I am grateful to the Society for American Baseball Research for making them available. Baseball research entered a new era in 1955 when S.C. Thompson and Hy Turkin compiled the ﬁrst baseball encyclopedia. This attempt to create a record for every man who ever played major league baseball became the basis for a host of constantly updated and emended encyclopedias available in print and online today. Any foray into baseball history or research invariably begins with one or more of these encyclopedias. I believe\n\nthat my own computer “falls open” to BaseballReference.com. At times the giants on whose shoulders we stand are our contemporaries who have taken a long step ahead of us. Most of us are members of and greatly indebted to the Society for American Baseball Research. While working on this book, I didn’t get far into any day without consulting the publications of fellow members. In particular, I am indebted to the work of the Biographical Research Committee. Their “ﬁnd of the month” gives substance to players who were previously only a last name. It is one thing to know that a man named Jones played in a major league game in 1884; it is quite another matter to know his ﬁrst name, a date and place of birth and of death. It is still another step forward when we see a photograph of him. And for this we are all indebted to the work of the SABR Pictorial Committee. In a special way, I want to acknowledge a debt of gratitude to fellow SABR members who stepped in when I was most in need of photos. Mark Fimoff and T. Scott Brandon generously shared their photos of the 1884 players. Without their assistance, this book would have a much smaller visual presence. And even though I am now only an emeritus, Mayville State University continues to provide technical support and assistance, and I am grateful for that.\n\nv\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nTable of Contents Acknowledgments Preface\n\nv\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\n3\n\n9\n\nAppendix I: Performance of Players by League and Team 177\n\nAppendix II: Birth and Mortality Summary\n\nBibliography Index\n\nvii\n\n229 231\n\n224\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPreface Like its predecessor, Major League Baseball Players of 1916, this book focuses on a single season — the expansion 1884 season. It is a biographical dictionary of the 637 men who played on one of the National League, American Association or Union Association teams in that season. Fourteen of those men — players such as Cap Anson, Old Hoss Radbourn, King Kelly and Dan Brouthers— enjoyed stellar careers which resulted in their being enshrined in baseball’s Hall of Fame. But also performing in 1884 were players named “Murphy,” “Smith,” “Jones,” and “Scott,” players without ﬁrst names and whose last names may even be bogus. Such a disparity of roles is typical, for the fabric of major league baseball has always contained dominant threads of bold color and length. But the basic fabric is woven from many smaller, shorter threads with very little splash. The pitcher who struck out “Mighty Casey” is unnamed, and Casey himself would not have become the focus of the drama without the contributions of Jimmy Boyle, whose single caused “the wonderment of all,” and of the “much despised” Flynn, who “tore the cover off the ball.” Because I prefer to study that whole fabric of major league baseball, my models are those biographical dictionaries that are least selective of subjects. In that regard, the standard is Baseball Players of the 1950s by Richard Marazzi and Len Fiorito, which includes a biographical sketch of every one of the 1,560 men who played during that decade. At some point in the future the standard will surely be the mammoth Biography Project by members of the Society for American Baseball Research. The goal of the Biography Project is nothing less than to present “high quality journal-length biographies of every player who ever played in the major leagues.” At the moment this project has just passed 1,300 of the more than 17,000 biographies planned. As I was in the ﬁnal stages of researching and writing this work, McFarland published The Com-\n\nplete New York Clipper Baseball Biographies (CNYCBB), compiled by Jean-Pierre Caillault. The two studies have much in common. Both are essentially biographical dictionaries of 19th-century baseball players. CNYCBB has 800 biographical sketches, each 200 or more words in length, illustrated by woodcuts. This book has 637 biographical sketches, each upward of 200 words in length, some illustrated by photographs. But the differences are signiﬁcant. First, CNYCBB is selective. Its subjects appeared in the New York Clipper over a period of more than 40 years (1859 –1903). Those subjects tend to be players the editors thought would interest New York readers (no Pete Browning, Charlie Ferguson or Will White). Only 192 players appear in both this book and CNYCBB. Second, except for an occasional obituary, CNYCBB focuses on the careers of active baseball ﬁgures, providing a wealth of detail about their major league careers to the time of writing as well as their minor league and amateur associations. This work provides a perspective on careers long ﬁnished and players’ lives beyond baseball. In truth, the two works tend to complement rather than compete with each other. I began researching with most of the same tools that I had used for my previous book. In the beginning, at least, I still had the ProQuest Historical Newspaper collection, giving me access to the 19th-century issues of New York Times, Washington Post, Chicago Daily Tribune, and Boston Globe—as well as Los Angeles Times, Atlanta Constitution and National Police Gazette. For obituaries, I still had available Sporting News and DeadballEra.com, in addition to Bill Lee’s Baseball Necrology. My primary sources for baseball records continued to be Total Baseball and BaseballReference.com. The SABR Baseball Encyclopedia was the source for the pictorial record of each player. However it would not have been possible to research this biographical dictionary without new\n\n1\n\nPreface resources. An indexed version of the U.S. Federal Census has become available through Ancestry. com. Census data provides information about nationalities, family relationships, occupations and residences— information especially valuable in working with the lesser known players. The LA Foundation has continued to expand the issues of Sporting Life, now available to researchers through SABR. Sporting Life is a chatty source of news, opinion and gossip about athletes— especially baseball players. Available issues cover the late 1880s and early 1890s—a time when many the 1884 players were leaving the majors, moving into other baseball positions and other occupations. And ﬁnally, since some of the 1884 players are still missing, the SABR Biographical Committee Newsletter provides information about efforts and successes in locating those players. The choice of 1884 as a focal year was not a random one, as it was baseball’s ﬁrst big expansion season. I entered this study in disbelief that a relatively small nation, as the United States was then, could increase its major leagues by 75 percent in a single season. Where were so many additional players to come from? Through this biographical dictionary, I hoped to show the source of these players. The introductory chapter sets forth the problems that expansion created in 1884—in terms of geography, population and baseball history. An appendix summarizes the birth and mortality data contained in the biographies. Not surprisingly, it ﬁnds that the players tended to be young, Eastern, urban and Irish. And despite what seems to be a high mortality rate among young players from infectious diseases, accidents, suicides, and alcohol-related causes, the life expectancy for the players as a group was average for the time. But through the study, I quickly discovered that transition in baseball was more than an 1884 phenomenon. The men who played in that season were a part of the evolution and development of baseball over a period of more than 40 years. The 19th century saw baseball undergo profound changes both on and off the ﬁeld. When Joe Start ﬁnished third in hitting in the amateur National Association in 1862, pitchers threw underhand from 45 feet, batters could deﬁne their own strike zones, eight and two was a full count, and not even catchers wore gloves. Well before the American League emerged as a rival major league in 1901, the pitching distance was lengthened to 60' 6\", the mound had appeared, three and two\n\n2 was a full count, and all ﬁelders were wearing gloves. Off the ﬁeld changes were even more pronounced: over the same period the status of organized baseball changed from amateur to professional; from club based to league based; from local to national. The control of the game passed from the players to the owners. The structure changed from one league, to two leagues, to three leagues, back to two leagues, again to three leagues, again back to two leagues, and to one league before ﬁnally settling on two. The players of 1884 were a part of all these manifestations; between 1871 and 1912, they played on 110 clubs in six major leagues. So in another appendix, I try to show the part the men of 1884 played in the development of baseball by charting the contributions of each player to each club for which he played. My own baseball experience is in the nature of a wannabe. As a result I am far more interested in major league baseball as the embodiment of a dream rather than as a sport or business. Like most in the stands, I watch those on the ﬁeld, wondering what routes brought them here and where they will go from here. All have a talent denied to most of us; all have sacriﬁced more than most of us can imagine. For some their piece of the dream will carry them to Cooperstown; for others the dream will end after their cup of coffee. So the limits of my study are those lives—speciﬁcally the lives of those who played major league baseball in its formative years. Our knowledge of many of those lives is incomplete. What we know of some others is not pretty, but that may well have been the way life was in the 1880s. One thing I learned from my research is that baseball cards predated major league baseball. The ﬁrst set of baseball cards were issued by Peck and Snyder in 1868, one year before Harry Wright began paying the Cincinnati Red Stockings and three years before the formation of the National Association of Professional Baseball Players. The appearance of baseball cards, team photographs, and composites at that early date conﬁrms that our interest as fans in knowing our heroes as intimately as possible has a very long standing. The more famous Old Judge baseball cards date from 1887. We are fortunate that the Library of Congress has made so many of these available so we can see how the heroes of another century appeared. I have included a number of those in this study.\n\nIntroduction Even after a century and a quarter, the 1884 major league baseball season continues to fascinate us. Perhaps it is because the Providence Grays won the ﬁrst ever World Series that season in a three-game sweep of the original New York Mets. Perhaps it is the pitching performance of Charles “Old Hoss” Radbourn or the home run record of Ned Williamson. Surely some of the cause is the presence of the Union Association. Despite Bill James’ persuasive argument in The New Bill James Historical Abstract that the UA has dubious claim to major league status, it is nevertheless a presence in the record books and thus in baseball lore. The 1884 season brought major league baseball’s ﬁrst attempt to expand to three leagues. In 1881 there had been one major league with eight teams. In 1883 there were 16 major league teams in two leagues— eight each in the seven-year-old National League and the two-year-old American Association. By the start of play in 1884 there were 28 teams— eight in the NL, 12 in the expanded AA, and eight in the brand spanking new Union Association. Before the end of the season, the total number of major league teams had reached 34 as franchises moved or were added. In 1881 there were 121 major league players; in 1883 there were 261; in 1884 there were 637. When the American League added two teams in 1961 and the National League added two in 1962, many were concerned that adding 100 major league positions—a 25 percent increase — would dilute the quality of play. Today we are apt to be stunned by the magnitude of the 1884 expansion — 244 percent over 1883 and 426 percent over 1881— but hardly surprised by the results. By today’s standard the United States was a small country in 1884. The U.S. federal census for 1880 lists a population of just over ﬁfty million; that of 1890 shows it nearing 63 million. So in 1884 the population would have been about onesixth of today’s ﬁgure. Geographically the country\n\nwas even smaller. Of the twenty cities with populations of more than 100,000, only San Francisco and New Orleans were located outside the Northeast Quadrant, an area generally bounded by the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, the Atlantic Ocean and the Canadian border. The centers of population and the difﬁculties of travel kept major league baseball pretty much within this quadrant for another three quarters of a century. (As late as 1924 the University of Pennsylvania football team needed three days to travel to the West Coast to play the University of California.) Earlier attempts to locate National Association clubs in “western” cities such as Peoria and Keokuk were not successful — at least partially due to higher travel costs. Later, in 1876, Philadelphia and New York City clubs in the National League found travel costs into the West more than they could afford. Kansas City, targeted for expansion by ﬁve different leagues, was not a successful major league city until air travel made it just another stop on the way to the West Coast. Of the twenty largest cities in the United States, only San Francisco (9th), New Orleans (10th), and the New York City suburbs of Newark (15th) and Jersey City (17th) were not represented by a major league team in 1884. The National League had clubs in eight—New York City (1st), Philadelphia (2nd), Chicago (4th), Boston (5th), Cleveland (11th), Buffalo (13th), Detroit (18th), and Providence (20th). The American Association had clubs in nine of the twenty — New York City, Philadelphia, Brooklyn (3rd), St. Louis (6th), Baltimore (7th), Cincinnati (8th), Pittsburgh (12th), Washington (14th), and Louisville (16th). Three smaller Midwestern cities— Indianapolis (24th), Columbus (33rd) and Toledo (35th)—ﬁlled out the league. When the Washington franchise folded, Richmond (25th) replaced it. The established leagues competed for fans only in the two largest cities. But where was a third league to stake out territory?\n\n3\n\nIntroduction When the Union Association opened shop in 1884, it found itself competing for fans in almost every city. The Philadelphia Keystones went head to head with both the NL Quakers and the AA Athletics. The Chicago Browns and Boston Reds competed with the NL White Stockings and Beaneaters. The St. Louis Maroons, Baltimore Monumentals, Cincinnati Outlaw Reds, and Washington Unions competed for fans with the AA Brown Stockings, Orioles, Red Stockings, and Nationals. When the Chicago franchise shifted to Pittsburgh, it began competition with the AA Alleghenys. Only Altoona among the starting ﬁeld and replacement clubs in Kansas City, Wilmington, St. Paul and Milwaukee had entire towns to themselves. While there are no ofﬁcial attendance ﬁgures for the UA, in an Internet article entitled “That’s Baseball,” Donald Dewey and Nicholas Acocella show that for Altoona “the average home attendance for 17 games was only slightly more than 1000,” with a low of 200. They also argue that in Baltimore theMonumentals were “no match for the Orioles.” Wilmington’s story is even more compelling. The Quicksteps forfeited a home game, refusing to play before empty stands. Marshall Wright points out that “Boston, Cincinnati and Chicago all lost at least $5,000 each (115).” Wright also notes that the UA’s founder and president, Henry Lucas, “lost upwards of $100,000 of his own money, which was used to keep the league aﬂoat” (115). Were there enough players of major league caliber to support 28 clubs? Strong franchises in both of the established leagues ﬁelded teams with minimal player turnover. The National League had ﬁve clubs with winning records— Providence, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago and New York. These clubs used 86 players, an average of 17.2 per club. The American Association had seven clubs with winning records— New York, Columbus, Louisville, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Baltimore and Philadelphia. These clubs had 132 players, an average of 18.9 per club. The four most stable Union Association clubs—St. Louis, Cincinnati, Baltimore, and Boston—used 106 players, an average of 26.5 per club. The higher turnover of players suggests that even the better UA clubs were having trouble attracting solid day-to-day players. But the struggle to ﬁnd passable major league players is best viewed from the bottom teams. The Philadelphia Quakers, the least stable NL club, used 31 players in the course of the season. The Indianapolis Hoosiers, the least stable AA club, had 35 players. By contrast, the Washington\n\n4 Unions used 52 players, and Kansas City Cowboys had 50 in a partial season. Related to high turnover is the issue of short-term players. Of the 637 players active in the majors in 1884, 197 played only in that season. In both the NL and AA one-year players made up 20 percent of the total (34 of 167 and 59 of 294, respectively); in the UA that ﬁgure was 35 percent (121 of 343). Again, these ﬁgures suggest that the UA was being forced to rely on fringe players to ﬁll out rosters. Of the 197 one-year players, 34 appeared in only one game. The most famous of these was a spectator named Murphy — no ﬁrst name — who came out of the stands to play when the Boston Reds needed a catcher for the day. Probably more typical is Peter Morris, whose case was researched by SABR’s Peter Morris. Morris, a shortstop for the Chicago Reserves, was picked up by the Washington Unions to play one game against the Chicago Browns. This was one of ten such one-game pickups by Washington that season, and it suggests that bottom tier UA clubs were at times having difﬁculty even in putting lineups on the ﬁeld.\n\nThe 1884 Season In the NL, teams with “name” players did not play up to expectations. From the perspective of 2010, it is easy to say that Buffalo should have easily won the 1884 pennant. The players who will win one for Detroit in 1887 — Dan Brouthers, Hardy Richardson, Deacon White, Jim O’Rourke and Jack Rowe — are all here and in the prime of their careers. O’Rourke hit .347, Brouthers .327, White .325, Rowe .315 and Richardson .301, giving the Bisons a team .262 batting average. Pitcher James “Pud” Galvin had career highs of 46 wins, 12 shutouts, 369 strikeouts, and a 1.99 ERA. Brouthers, O’Rourke and Galvin will all end up in the Hall of Fame — where White should be. The Bisons had the third highest ﬁelding percentage in the NL — which is exactly where they ﬁnished —191⁄2 games behind Providence. Chicago also should have won easily. Playing in White Stocking Park with a left ﬁeld fence only 180 feet away, they were the Bash Brothers of the majors in 1884, hitting 142 home runs—103 more than their closest competitor. Portly third baseman Ned Williamson set a major league record with 27 homers, a record that stood until 1919. Second baseman Fred Pfeffer (25), outﬁelder Abner Dalrymple (22) and ﬁrst baseman Adrian\n\n5 “Cap” Anson (21) gave the White Sox a sweep of the ﬁrst four places. Mike “King” Kelly ﬁnished sixth with 13 homers. Kelly (.354), Anson (.335), George Gore (.318) and Dalrymple (.317) helped the club to a league-leading .281 batting average as well. Larry Corcoran won 35 games, and rookie John Clarkson, a future Hall of Famer, went 10 – 3. Still, a team ERA over three and the NL’s worst ﬁelding percentage dropped the White Stockings into a tie for fourth place, 22 games behind Providence. Much also could be said for the pennant chances of the New York Gothams, a team that lined up with four future Hall of Fame members on the ﬁeld. Mickey Welch smiled 39 times during the season, with 62 complete games and 345 strikeouts. Roger Connor hit .317; Buck Ewing a respectable .277, and Monte Ward, still making the transition from pitcher to position player, only .253. However, with a lineup that appears to have been pulled from a hat each day — Ewing played seven different positions, Mike Dorgan six, Ward and Connor three each — the Gothams ﬁelded only at an .895 clip and ended up tied with the White Stockings for fourth place. The bottom three NL teams were never in pennant contention. Sixth-place Philadelphia had one remarkable player; twenty-one-year-old rookie Charlie Ferguson pitched 99 wins in only four seasons. Cleveland’s pitching star, Scottish-born Jim McCormick, who led the NL in ERA in 1883, jumped ship to the Cincinnati Outlaw Reds in mid-season, to lead the Union Association in ERA. Shortstop Ned Hanlon, who would go on to a Hall of Fame career managing Baltimore and Brooklyn, and rookie pitcher Pretzels Getzein (1.95 ERA) were not enough to keep Detroit from the cellar. Past all these teams swept defending champion Boston. Without a single Hall of Fame candidate on the team, the Beaneaters kept a solid lineup in place, leading the league in ﬁelding. Third baseman Ezra Sutton hit .346 and led the league in hits. Charlie Bufﬁnton had a career year, posting 48 wins and striking out 417. Fire-balling Jim Whitney added 23 wins and a 2.09 ERA. The Beaneaters had ten wins more than they had in their 1883 pennant winner, but still ﬁnished 101⁄2 games behind Providence. In 1884 the Providence Grays won the National League pennant for the second time in six years. Like Boston, the Grays had a solid lineup, but few stars. Only outﬁelder Paul Hines hit over .300 on a team that hit only .241, and they ﬁnished second\n\nIntroduction to Boston in ﬁelding. The difference was Charley Radbourn, who had the most phenomenal pitching season ever. Working 678.2 innings, he won 59 games with 441 strikeouts and a 1.38 ERA. When Charley Sweeney (17 wins, 1.55 ERA) jumped to the St. Louis Maroons in late July, Radbourn became a one-man pitching staff for more than a month, winning 20 consecutive games. Even with the 50-foot pitching distance of the time, 73 complete games (in a 114 game schedule) is remarkable. In a three-game series “for the championship of the United States,” Providence defeated the American Association New York Metropolitans 6 –0, 3 –1 and 12–2. Radbourn pitched all three games for the Grays; Fellow Hall of Fame member Tim Keefe pitched the ﬁrst two games for the Mets. American Association batting champion Dave Orr (a career .342 hitter) hit .354 to lead the original New York Metropolitans to their only pennant in 1884. The “Dude,” Tom Esterbrook, hit a career high .314 for the champions. Keefe (37–17) and mate Jack Lynch (37–15) combined for 74 of the Mets’ 75 victories in route to a 61⁄2 game margin over Columbus. Only eight games separated the next six teams in the standings. Without a regular above .276, the light-hitting Columbus Buckeyes won 69 games. A stable lineup (six regulars with more than 99 games) and solid ﬁelding (.908 percentage) helped the Columbus cause. Pitcher Ed “Cannon Ball” Morris had 34 wins with a 2.18 ERA — second lowest in the league. Louisville’s Guy Hecker had an 1884 season to rival that of Radbourn. The big right-hander led the AA with 72 complete games, 670 innings, 52 victories, 385 strikeouts and a 1.80 ERA. Not surprisingly, Louisville had the lowest team ERA in the league. The original Louisville Slugger Pete Browning, a career .341 hitter, hit .336 in 1884. The Eclipse ﬁelded .912, highest in the AA, but ﬁnished 71⁄2 games behind the Mets. First baseman and manager Charles Comiskey, who later made the Hall of Fame as an executive, led the St. Louis Browns to a fourth-place ﬁnish, only half game behind Louisville and a game behind second-place Columbus. The Browns’ heavenly twins— Dave Foutz (15 –6) and Bob Caruthers (7–2)—who combined for a 22–8 record, debuted in 1884. Ultimately they would combine for 365 wins as pitchers and 1948 base hits as position players. The Cincinnati Red Stockings played two more\n\nIntroduction games than the Browns, so their 68–41 record lost on percentage points to the Browns’ 67–40. Second baseman Bid McPhee was one of the few American Association players later to be named to the Hall of Fame. Teammate Long John Reilly led the AA with 11 homers and ﬁnished second in batting with a .339 average; bespectacled pitcher Will White won 34 games. The slick-ﬁelding Red Stockings, with Pop Corkhill leading AA outﬁelders in percentage, were second in team ﬁelding. Without a regular hitting over .270, and a team average of only .233, Baltimore still managed 63 wins, good for sixth place. It helped that Canadian Bob Emslie (32 wins) and 21-year-old Hardie Henderson (27 wins) led the pitching staff to a 2.71 ERA. Led by Harry Stovey’s .326 average and 10 homers, the heavy hitting Philadelphia Athletics ﬁnished seventh, just 21⁄2 games behind Baltimore. With six regulars over .270, the team batted .267. Bobby Mathews, who, as a 19-year-old pitching for Fort Wayne, won the ﬁrst major league game ever played in 1871, added 30 more to his victory totals in 1884. The rest of the American Association teams lost more games than they won. Eighth-place Toledo featured the ﬁrst and last black major league players— Fleet and Welday Walker — before Jackie Robinson. Irish-born Tony Mullane led the AA with seven shutouts, amassing 36 of his career 284 victories in 1884. The Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers and the Richmond Virginians (which replaced Washington on August 5), both with six regulars hitting below .250, ﬁnished ninth and tenth. Dodger pitchers yielded 3.79 earned runs per game, better than the 4.52 given up by Richmond pitchers. Only Ed Swartwood (.288) hit above .250 for the 11th place Pittsburgh Alleghenys, and only Jack Nagle (3.73) had an ERA below 4.0. Larry McKeon was a 41game loser for 12th place Indianapolis. Before folding, the Washington franchise featured ﬁve regulars hitting below .200, leading to an overall .200 batting average and a .190 winning percentage. No team ever dominated a league as the St. Louis Maroons did the Union Association. Playing at a .832 pace, they won 25 more games than runner-up Cincinnati. Second-baseman Fred Dunlap, a career .292 hitter, hit .412; “Buttercup” Dickerson hit .365, 81 points above his career average. Billy Taylor won 25 of his career 50 victories before leaving the club in August; Charley Sweeney won 24 of his career 64 games\n\n6 after joining the club in July. Henry Boyle, who never again enjoyed a winning season in the majors, went 15–3 with a 1.74 ERA. The pitching staff combined for a 1.96 ERA. The best ﬁelding team in the UA, the Maroons had four position leaders— Dunlap at second base, Dave Rowe in centerﬁeld, George Baker at catcher, and Sweeney at pitcher. The Outlaw Reds won 69 games, eleven more than third place Baltimore. Outﬁelder and pitcher Dick Burns hit .306 and won 23 games, two fewer than the veteran George Bradley. But the pitching story was the big Scot Jim McCormick, who won 21 games and led the UA with a 1.54 ERA after jumping from Cleveland in mid-season. Of Baltimore’s 58 wins, 40 came from another Sweeney—Bill—who led the UA with 538 innings pitched. Only in his second season, Sweeney never pitched again, leaving the majors with 49 wins. Outﬁelder Emmett Seery hit .311 on a Monumentals’ team that hit .245. The 1884 season also debuted Hall of Fame outﬁelder Tommy McCarthy. The 21-year-old pitched and played outﬁeld for his hometown Boston Reds, going 0 –7 and .215. Pitching star Frederick Lander “Dupee” Shaw had 21 wins with a 1.77 ERA after coming from Detroit in midseason. He led the staff to a 2.70 ERA, helping the Reds to a fourth-place ﬁnish among teams that completed the season. Harry Moore, a one-year phenom outﬁelder, who hit .336 before disappearing entirely from baseball (and from public records), led Washington to a 47–65 record. Moore and second baseman Tom Evers were the only Washington players to appear in as many as 100 games. None of the remaining UA teams played a complete season. Except for Milwaukee, these teams ranged from mediocre to downright awful. Before passing into oblivion in September, the Chicago Browns had morphed into the Pittsburgh Stogies, being mediocre in two cities. First baseman Jumbo Schoeneck hit .306 and led the UA in ﬁelding. Hugh “One Arm” Daily struck out 483 batters (including 14 with Washington), 8.68 per game, a major league record that stood until 1960 when Sandy Koufax averaged 10.13. Before closing shop in August, the Philadelphia Keystones combined the worst ﬁelding percentage in the majors (.841) with one of the higher ERA’s (4.63). After hitting .364 for the Keystones, outﬁelder Buster Hoover ﬁnished the season with the NL Quakers, for whom he hit .190. Altoona won only six of 25 games before disbanding in June. Their replace-\n\n7 ment, Kansas City, need 79 games to win 16, an even lower percentage. Among the replacement teams, Milwaukee won eight of 12 games after joining the UA in September. Ed Cushman allowed only four runs in four starts with two shutouts. St. Paul hit only .180 in compiling a 2–6 record. Wilmington hit even worse — .175 — and needed 18 games to win two.\n\nIntroduction In January 1885 the National League admitted the St. Louis Maroons to membership, replacing Cleveland. This move brought the Union Association saga to a close. Also in January the American Association reorganized into an eight-team league, eliminating Richmond, Columbus, Indianapolis, and Toledo.

He played four games with the\n\nPittsburgh Alleghenys early in 1884 and ﬁnished that season with the Washington Unions. As a regular inﬁelder with the Cleveland Blues in 1888, Alberts hit .206. In 1891 he played twelve games for the Milwaukee Brewers. Alberts played, managed and umpired in the minors. In 1896 Sporting Life describes him as “boss lemon-ade peddler at the St. Joseph [MO] grounds.” In 1908 he was groundskeeper at Bartlesville, OK. In 1909 he was described as a deputy sheriff “doing a collection business.” Born to German parents in Reading, PA, Alberts appears in the 1910 census as a resident of Topeka, KS, working as a baseball manager. He later worked for the Clara Exploration and Development Company, mining near Alice, ID. Contacting pneumonia, he died in Idaho Springs, CO, on May 7, 1912, at age 52.

Used primarily as a catcher, he ﬁelded .895, the average for the league. Alexander, who later managed St. Joseph of the Western League, was a lifelong resident of Pana, a small town in south central Illinois. In censuses for 1900, 1920 and 1930 he is variously described as the proprietor of a butcher shop and a retail meat merchant.

A native of Painesville, OH, Andrews had attended Western Reserve College prior to entering professional baseball. He played brieﬂy for the Indianapolis Hoosiers in 1889, the Brooklyn Wonders in 1890 and the Cincinnati Kellys in 1891 before leaving the playing ranks. Listed by Sporting Life as a stenographer in 1891, Andrews was a National League umpire in 1895 and 1898-99. He then moved to South Florida in 1898 and was involved in a number of real estate developments. The 1910 census lists him as a fruit grower (Sporting Life says pineapples), and the 1920 census shows him as a retail salesman for mineral water. He also gained fame as a writer of yachting literature. Andrews died at West Palm Beach on August 12,\n\nWally Andrews, a Philadelphia native, had two trials with Louisville.

His delivery was described as “slow with very little curve.” Andrus left the majors with one victory and a .293 batting average. In 1889 he was described as an “incorporator” of the Chicago Baseball Club, and an 1895 note in the Chicago Daily Tribune described him as an employee of A.G. Spalding in Chicago.

In that ﬁrst NL season he hit .300 and led the NL third basemen in ﬁelding. On August 25, 1877, he and Joe Blong were named by gamblers as “willing partners” in a St. Louis loss and as a result was “eased” out of the league. In 1882 he returned to the majors with the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, whom he managed in 1883. Released in 1884, he played for and managed the Union Association Pittsburgh Stogies, ﬁnishing that season with the Baltimore Monumentals; thus, he became the ﬁrst of the four-league players. Battin made a 29-game return to the majors in 1890 with Syracuse. In ten seasons— six in the NL or American Association — he hit .218. He later played and umpired in the minors for a number of years.

A native of Batavia, IL, Briggs appears in the censuses for 1900 and 1910 as residing there. In 1900 he is listed as a machinist, living with his father. In 1910 he has his “own income” and is living with a cousin. Briggs died in March 10, 1920, in Seattle at age 59.

In 1897 Sporting Life states that Frank Brill, “a popular minor league pitcher a decade ago is now living in retirement at Long Island City.” The 1910 U.S. Federal Census lists Frank Brill as a saloon keeper and manager of a bowling alley in Chicago. The census for 1920 shows him managing a billiards parlor there. A Frank Brill, who may have been the pitcher, was also a topﬂight bowler in the Chicago area.

The National Police Gazette noted of another player that he was “as slow a runner nearly as Charlie Briody,” who carried 190 pounds on his 5' 8\" frame. In his busiest season —1884 — he played in 65 games, split between the Cleveland Blues and the Cincinnati Outlaw Reds. Beginning with Troy in 1880, Briody also played with St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit in the National League and Kansas City in the American Association. As a catcher he ﬁelded .910, ten points over the league average for the time. Born in Lansingburg, NY, to Irish parents, Briody became a “rotund boniface of a hostelry at Troy.” Later he settled in Chicago, where he “opened his own independent trucking business.” Newspapers reported him dead in May of 1892, but the Boston Daily Globe stated that Briody “has been in hard shape, but dead never.” He actually died on June 22, 1903, in Chicago at age 44.

Plagued by mastoiditis from childhood, he was largely deaf, illiterate and ignorant of subjects other than baseball. The alcoholism which plagued him throughout his career was probably as an answer to mastoid pain. After leaving baseball, he tried operating a saloon and selling cigars, but ultimately looked after his mother, a “comparatively wealthy” woman. For a time Browning was committed to the insane asylum at Lakeland, KY. His death on September 10, 1905, was attributed to alcoholism, cancer and paresis. He was 44 years of age.
