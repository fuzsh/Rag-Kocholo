        "text": "British number two\n\nJames Ward was knocked out of Wimbledon after losing to Mardy Fish in a five-set second-round thriller.\n\nThe Londoner, ranked 173rd in the world, gave a good account of himself as he went down 6-3 5-7 6-4 6/7 (7/3) 6-3 to 10th seed Fish.\n\nThe 25-year-old played some impressive tennis on Court One and even managed to save a match point in the fourth set.\n\nBut he eventually succumbed to the American, who has only recently returned to the ATP Tour following a heart scare.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Ward said: ‘I’m disappointed. Everyone else seems to be pretty happy but I don’t know why.\n\n‘It was a good match – I’m not going to lie and say it wasn’t. It was a special day for both of us.\n\n‘It was a long match, ups and down, but I tried to give myself the best chance.\n\n‘In the end he was just a little bit better than me. He’s a top player and he came up with some big points at the right times.’\n\nWard lamented the fact that Fish was able to pull something out of the bag at crucial times.\n\n‘Every time I sort of had a chance, he came up with a big first serve,’ he added.\n\n‘But you’ve got to expect that. He’s a great player so he’s most likely to go for it. Today it came off.’\n\nFish wrapped up the opening set inside 33 minutes but the Brit managed to win the second with some inspired play.\n\nWard gave as good as he got for long spells in the match and, on occasion, looked the better player.\n\nBut Fish showed his quality as he went on to take the third set, and even though the young Brit managed to take the fourth on a tie break, the Californian took the final and decisive set to seal his place in round three."
