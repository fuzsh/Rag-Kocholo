        "text": "Andy Roddick went out. Novak Djokovic went out. Rafael Nadal nearly went out. And then, for Andy Murray, the lights went out on a gloomy day at Queen's, when Mardy Fish persuaded the supervisor to call off their third-round match just as the Scot was storming back to parity late in the evening in the deciding set.\n\nWhat a day. What a night.\n\nMurray and Fish will go at it again first up on Centre Court tomorrow and their contest could hardly be more delicately poised at a set apiece and 3-3 in the third. Murray was unusually animated in complaining the American had kidded his way into an early finish, with a chance to regroup.\n\nThe light was indifferent to playable. The dilemma in these situations is a familiar one of self-interest, of course, and Murray has to ask himself if he would not have done the same if he had found himself in Fish's situation: struggling against the tide in the dark like an abandoned salmon. Not a Scottish salmon, obviously.\n\n\"The only reason he wanted to call it off was because I had come back from 3-1 down to 3-3,\" a furious Murray told the umpire, Cédric Mourier. \"He was happy to play on at 3-1. This is absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\nIt was the American supervisor, Tom Barnes, who made the call in the end but given that Fish was already tucked up in the locker room, there wasn't much else he could do but agree to call it a night. So to speak.\n\nThe match was about as close to a razor-thin finish as you could wish after Fish won the first set 6-4 and dropped the second 6-1. The light was not as bad as that in which Murray had played in the fourth round of the French Open at Roland Garros, but neither was it blinding. They had been playing for an hour and 41 minutes, the third match on Centre Court after all the drama that had been played out there before. Shakespeare, as Sid Waddell might have said, could not have wished for more.\n\nMurray stood for several minutes at the other end, impassive and unamused. When it became apparent that Fish had persuaded the umpire to call for the supervisor, Murray reacted as if stung by a summer bee. The suggestion that Fish had intervened when the match was swinging away from him seemed valid – but the laxity of the decision-making by the supervisor did not help the mood.\n\nEarlier, it all kicked off in a variety of ways. Nadal seemed to be walking through this genteel tournament like some blue‑shirted giant, almost as if he were too big for his surroundings. Not today. Not when he was lying face down on the turf, getting his hip massaged, with the 16th-seeded Uzbeki Denis Istomin waiting for him to get up with all the impatience of a prizefighter hungry for a knockout.\n\nFor a few moments – two weeks before Wimbledon – tennis held its collective breath as the world No1, who has been dogged by bad knees for years, lay immobilised, down for the count, grey skies providing a sombre backdrop. He later declared himself \"feeling good\" – but it did not look that promising in mid-fight. He got up to win 7-6, 4-6, 6-4. His aura, ever so briefly, has been sullied.\n\nLater he eased concerns when he said that a twinge at the back of his leg had made him take a precautionary pause. \"I'm not thinking right now about going out of the tournament. I will play, sure. I have to be careful. We will see. I would love to be OK. I am going to try my best.\"\n\nEarlier Dudi Sela, who did not even know he was seeded, had put Roddick out of Queen's before he could work up any momentum in pursuit of a record fifth title. So, in the most unthreatening of settings, there was grief and upset in the cool summer air.\n\nWhen Djokovic, the No2 seed, went out to the unseeded Belgian Xavier Malisse, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, the ambience of insurrection deepened. Tennis: a beautiful game of chilling uncertainty."
