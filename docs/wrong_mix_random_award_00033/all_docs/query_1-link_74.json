        "text": "Former tennis star Mardy Fish said he was “proud” to be the first person to play on both the ATP Tour and the PGA Tour after swapping his racquet for a bag of clubs.\n\nThe 40-year-old won six ATP titles and once ranked as high as seventh in the world in 2011, before retiring from tennis four years later. However, he has recently been playing amateur golf and was given a special exemption to play in the PGA Tour’s 3M Open in Minnesota, his hometown. Fish was unable to make the cut, finishing 13 over par after his two rounds, with only three players carding higher scores.\n\nHe was grateful for the opportunity, though, and took to Twitter on Saturday to reflect on his achievement, posting: “What an incredible experience playing in the 3M Open. Truly a week I will never forget. I’m proud to be the first person to play on the ATP Tour and the PGA Tour. Chase your dreams, no matter how ridiculous they may be! Thank you for the incredible support all week Minnesota!”\n\nNicklaus praise"
