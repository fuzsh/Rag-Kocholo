Before this year, Fish, an Edina native, hadn’t been back to the U.S. Open since 2012, when he never made it onto the court for what should have been one of his biggest matches. He withdrew that day because of a panic attack before his fourth-round meeting with Roger Federer.\n\nFish played little after that as he struggled with anxiety disorder, but he decided for one last hurrah this summer on the hard-court circuit, culminating with the U.S. Open. The former top-10 player hoped to make new memories at Flushing Meadows and tell his story to help others coping with mental illness.\n\n“I accomplished everything that I set out to this summer,” Fish said, “and I’m happy about that.”\n\nHis summer of tennis nearly stretched on at least two more days. Fish had a chance to serve out the match in the fourth set but made three straight unforced errors, then double-faulted to be broken at love.\n\nFish said afterward the nerves weren’t too bad.\n\n“Didn’t pick a great time to play the worst game I played all day,” he said. “I haven’t been in that position in a long time, obviously. So things happen.”\n\nLopez quickly won the next two games as well to force the deciding set, and Fish’s legs were already starting to cramp up. Yet he hung in there at the start of the fifth, when Lopez was the one who seemed overwhelmed by the moment.\n\nHe had four double-faults in the last set but also seven aces to wiggle out of trouble.\n\n“It’s hard to play a guy that’s sort of wounded,” Fish said.\n\n“I was sort of wondering if I could actually get through it,” he added, “but obviously I knew I was in a bit of trouble.”\n\nHis legs were cramping more and more, and he was able to move less and less. Never did he consider quitting.\n\n“You would have had to carry me off the court,” Fish said. “I was definitely not stopping at that point.”\n\nFinally when he was serving at 3-4, his leg seized up in the middle of a point. Lopez broke, then closed out the 2-6, 6-3, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory after 3 hours, 11 minutes.\n\n“That probably wouldn’t have happened a few years ago. I probably would have been fine in the fifth set,” Fish said. “I worked as hard as I could. My body is just about done. So I gave it everything I had.\n\n“That was all I had.”\n\nDuring their handshake at the net, Lopez recalled afterward, he told his longtime rival “that he deserved to win, that he was the better player today.”\n\nAsked about that exchange later, Fish replied with a wry smile, “I felt the same.”\n\n“Those are the situations you work so hard to be in,” he said. “You know, just an awesome crowd, and it’s a really nice memory to have on my final match. Obviously not the last set, but my final match.”\n\nLopez also is 33, and the two have now met nine times. The Spaniard called Fish “a true gentleman.”\n\n“He was a great player, had a good career,” Lopez said in an on-court interview. “It was very sad what was happening the last two, three years with this illness, and it’s great to have him back at least for a few weeks.”\n\nFish carried his 19-month-old son into the interview room for his last U.S. Open news conference. He was feeling lousy physically, understandable for someone who hadn’t played a 3-hour-plus match on a hot, humid day in years.\n\nAs well as he performed Wednesday, Fish never once reconsidered his retirement. He plans to play a lot of golf — he’s a scratch golfer — and help the U.S. Tennis Association.\n\n“Just at peace personally,” Fish said. “I’m bummed that obviously my career didn’t end the past few years the way I had imagined. But it is what it is, and you try to make the best of your situation.”\n\nOriginally Published: September 1, 2015 at 11:01 p.m."
