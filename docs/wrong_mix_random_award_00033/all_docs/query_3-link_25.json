        "text": "Following social media reports that a dog had died from cyanobacteria contracted from algae blooms at Lake Tahoe, the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection in conjunction with the California Water Boards and U.S. Forest Service took action, sampling a number of water sources from El Dorado Beach and Nevada Beach.\n\nThose tests have returned negative, indicating the dog’s death was not caused by swimming in Lake Tahoe. However, at Nevada Beach, a “very low level” of a cyanotoxin called saxitoxin within a shallow pond not connected to the lake was found.\n\nWhen asked if any cases of wildlife falling sick had been reported, Nevada Division of Wildlife’s Ashley Zeme said she had not heard of any cases affecting wildlife: “There have been no reports of fish or any other wildlife being impacted.”\n\nJenny Jackson of Nevada’s Department of Conservation and Natural Resources similarly said there had been no other reports of pets falling ill from Tahoe waters.\n\n“We are deeply sorry to hear about the loss of a pet after swimming in Lake Tahoe,” Jackson said. “Apart from the social media post, we have not received any other reports of pet or wildlife deaths. The Nevada Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Task Force is collaborating closely with the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to monitor HABs in Lake Tahoe. We urge the public to report any suspected harmful algal blooms in Nevada to the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection and to keep an eye on the HAB dashboard for updates on confirmed blooms.”\n\nWhile there are a number of HAB watches and warnings for waterways in the area, Lake Tahoe due to its size and low temperatures are typically spared from the algae. However, with our climate continuing to warm, algae and HAB could become more prevalent.\n\nBeaches are sampled throughout the season according to Lisa Herron from the USDA Forest Service, Lake Tahoe basin management unit.\n\n“Per Lahontan Regional Water Quality Board, several Lake Tahoe sites were visited and samples were collected on June 11,” Herron said. “No visible algae were present during those visits, and sample results show that there was no cyanobacteria or the toxins Microcystin or Anatoxin-a present. Sites sampled included Connolly Beach (Timber Cove Marina), Regan Beach, and Taylor Creek Marsh. Other sites visited in Lake Tahoe that showed no visual signs of algae were present were Kiva Beach, Commons Beach, and Kings Beach.”\n\nThe Lahontan Water Board and NDEP collected further water samples on July 8 and 10 at the beaches following social media reports of the dog’s death. While the Lake itself did not return positive for HABs, the board and NDEP are recommending the pond, which is partially fenced off, be fully fenced off to prevent dogs and owners from accessing the area.\n\nNDEP has issued a “HAB Watch” advisory specific to the backwater pond at Nevada Beach.\n\nWhether or not the pond contributed to the death of the dog, however, is unknown:\n\n“The agencies involved in water-sample testing cannot draw conclusions about the cause of death for the dog from these results; they can only speak to evaluating water quality and the presence of HABs,” a press release stated. “The California Interagency Harmful Algal Bloom-related Illness Workgroup (Illness Workgroup), which includes staff from the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), continues to investigate.”\n\nHow to report and stay informed:\n\nThe advisory at El Dorado Beach has been lifted and the water is designated safe for recreational activities, however the public is urged to always remain vigilant when visiting any waterbodies, practice healthy water habits, and to be aware of how to identify and report suspected harmful algal blooms. Doing so can keep loved ones, including dogs, along with other members of the public, safe from possible health impacts from HABs.\n\nTo stay updated on harmful algal blooms in California, visit the HABs portal."
