        "text": "With Indian Wells underway, Roddick looked back on his mad dash between heartbreak in the singles and glory in the doubles back in 2009. The former world No. 1 failed to lift the singles trophy during his glittering career - one of the few big trophies he failed to collect in his home country.\n\nHe did enjoy success in the doubles with countryman Fish but it was a quick turnaround after losing to Nadal in the singles semi-final. The Spaniard came through 6-4 7-6(4) and eventually went on to win the tournament. Roddick also ended the week with a trophy, though it wasn’t part of the plan.\n\n“We won it accidentally one time in 2009, Mardy and I did,” Roddick said on his Served podcast. “Mardy won with like five different partners that year, I think he could’ve won with my cat. I think I was a very, very small part of it.”\n\nThe 2003 US Open champion was left gutted when Nadal dashed his hopes of winning the singles tournament. But he quickly came around when he learned what was on offer in the next match, £88,300 ($112,500). Roddick added: “I remember losing to Rafa at the semis and then coming off and I was like, ‘Okay, we have an hour until we play doubles.’\n\n“And you know, I'm like mad I lost to Rafa. It's the only North American event that I didn't end up winning. So I kind of wanted to win it but I come off the court and said to Mardy, ‘What do we get if we win this match?’ And he told me the number and I couldn't believe we were about to play two sets and a tiebreaker for that sum of money in the doubles event.”\n\nAs two top singles players, it was something of a surprise when Roddick and Fish together. But they weren’t the only players to cross over and form a pairing that week. “So we ended up winning against Miryni and Ram but we played a bunch of singles teams,” Roddick continued.\n\n“We played like Gasquet Wawrinka one round. They pack the stadiums, they get the extra sessions.” It’s no different this year, as several top singles guys have signed up to take on the extra matches including Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, Britain’s Dan Evans and top-15 star Grigor Dimitrov.\n\nAnd Roddick isn’t surprised, branding Indian Wells the best two-man tournament to play in. He explained: “I think it’s the best doubles draw of the year outside of the Olympics where people would take a gold medal in a distant spitting competition, a gold medal is a gold medal.\n\n“The men on tour, there is not really any other tournament besides Miami and Indian Wells where you play it over 10 or 11 days but you don’t extend the format. It’s not a three out of five set situation, you’re playing max two or three sets.”"
