        "text": "I have been considering writing this post for over a year. I have mixed feelings about revisiting the Nobel prizes in physics with the knowledge of NPQG in hand. Let‚Äôs go through the set of conflicting thoughts that run through my mind.\n\nThe Nobel Prize is considered the highest award in physics (and other fields) and the award and winners are generally held in high esteem.\n\nModern day criticism of the Nobel Prize concept resonates with me, specifically that it reinforces the power and competition hierarchy of academic physics which has been and still is dominated by a non-diverse group and which leads to unhealthy behaviour in the physics community.\n\nI don‚Äôt wish to tarnish the past prize in the eyes of the public, the scientific community, nor the recipients. However, science marches onward. It is inevitable that if a paradigm shift occurs in a field, that many of the past results, while possibly fine work in their era, are rendered incorrect, obsolete, or misinterpretations by the science of the new era.\n\nIt is important for science historians to understand and document the errors in thinking and faulty methods of prior eras and why those eras advocated incorrect narratives that deviated to a large degree from the ground truth of nature. While I am not a science historian, I have studied the history of physics, cosmology, and astronomy in order to fathom the errors and misinterpretations that have blinded these fields to solutions that are rather painfully obvious in retrospect.\n\nUnder the fair use doctrine, I have copied the text of the All Nobel Prizes in Physics page from the Nobel Prize website. I‚Äôve kept the links intact to the annual prize and winner pages. I will add my comments in red font if NPQG has a material impact on the science that led to the prize and green font if NPQG impact is none to minimal. Where I use an orange font, NPQG will have a material impact to the area, but it is unknown if it will impact the research for which the prize was awarded. If there is no comment after a prize winner section then either I have not found a serious NPQG impact to that research or I have not yet evaluated it.\n\nNPQG will undoubtedly have a degree of impact on all science of standard matter-energy in spacetime √¶ther going forward. However, prior work may be minimally impacted at its scale of reference. I‚Äôll use the symbol ùõøNPQG to indicate Nobel prizes where there may be minor deltas or reframing needed in the context of NPQG and often this is with respect to the fundamental narratives of GR/QM/ŒõCDM.\n\nThe first version of this post will be a quick pass through, based simply on the high level description of the research for which the prize was awarded. In the future, I may come back and revisit some of these in more detail.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2020\n\nThe 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics has not been awarded yet. It will be announced on Tuesday 6 October, 11:45 CEST at the earliest.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2019\n\n‚Äúfor contributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth‚Äôs place in the cosmos‚Äù\n\nJames Peebles ‚Äúfor theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology‚Äù\n\nDr. Peebles work on ŒõCDM cosmology occurred during an era where a fundamental narrative misconception has been in place ‚Äì specifically the physical implementation of the Big Bang, inflation, and expansion as whole universe concepts (LeMaitre rewind to a single event). NPQG teaches that these concepts are all galaxy local and this resolves a number of tensions in cosmology that had largely been discounted by scientists, including the Hubble rate and the age of the universe relative to other processes. Presumably much of Dr. Peebles work can be mapped over to the galaxy local processes.\n\nMichel Mayor and Didier Queloz ‚Äúfor the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2018\n\n‚Äúfor groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics‚Äù\n\nArthur Ashkin ‚Äúfor the optical tweezers and their application to biological systems‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform this science to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of spacetime √¶ther nor of the Planck scale point charges (electrino and positrino), nor of the composite electrino/positrino structure of the photon.\n\nG√©rard Mourou and Donna Strickland ‚Äúfor their method of generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform this science to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of spacetime √¶ther nor of the Planck particles (electrino and positrino), nor of the composite electrino/positrino structure of the photon.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2017\n\nRainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish and Kip S. Thorne ‚Äúfor decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform gravitational wave science to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of spacetime √¶ther nor of the Planck scale point charges (electrino and positrino), nor of galaxy local recycling as the dominant large process in the universe.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2016\n\nDavid J. Thouless, F. Duncan M. Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz ‚Äúfor theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2015\n\nTakaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald ‚Äúfor the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform neutrino science to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of spacetime √¶ther nor of the Planck scale point charges (electrino and positrino).\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2014\n\nIsamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura ‚Äúfor the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2013\n\nFran√ßois Englert and Peter W. Higgs ‚Äúfor the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN‚Äôs Large Hadron Collider‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform particle physics and Higgs research to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of spacetime √¶ther nor of the Planck scale point charges (electrino and positrino).\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2012\n\nSerge Haroche and David J. Wineland‚Äúfor ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform particle physics and quantum research to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of spacetime √¶ther nor of the Planck scale point charges (electrino and positrino), nor composite particles of standard matter, nor does quantum mechanics understand uncertainty properly.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2011\n\nSaul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt and Adam G. Riess‚Äúfor the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae‚Äù\n\nThis work on ŒõCDM cosmology has been during an era where a fundamental narrative misconception has been in place ‚Äì specifically the physical implementation of the Big Bang, inflation, and expansion as whole universe concepts (LeMaitre rewind to a single event). NPQG teaches that these concepts are all galaxy local and this resolves a number of tensions in cosmology that had largely been discounted by scientists, including the Hubble rate and the age of the universe relative to other processes. The discrepancy between Supernovae distance calculations, redshift, and directional Hubble rate will need to be re-evaluted in the context of NPQG.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2010\n\nAndre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov ‚Äúfor groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2009\n\nCharles Kuen Kao‚Äúfor groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG\n\nWillard S. Boyle and George E. Smith‚Äúfor the invention of an imaging semiconductor circuit ‚Äì the CCD sensor‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2008\n\nYoichiro Nambu ‚Äúfor the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG the understanding of symmetries of nature and symmetry breaking will gain new insights as a result of NPQG and the Planck scale point charge basis of nature.\n\nMakoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa ‚Äúfor the discovery of the origin of the broken symmetry which predicts the existence of at least three families of quarks in nature‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG the understanding of symmetries of nature and symmetry breaking will gain new insights as a result of NPQG and the Planck scale point charges basis of nature.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2007\n\nAlbert Fert and Peter Gr√ºnberg‚Äúfor the discovery of Giant Magnetoresistance‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2006\n\nJohn C. Mather and George F. Smoot‚Äúfor their discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation‚Äù\n\nThis work on ŒõCDM cosmology has been during an era where a fundamental narrative misconception has been in place ‚Äì specifically the physical implementation of the Big Bang, inflation, and expansion as whole universe concepts (LeMaitre rewind to a single event). NPQG teaches that these concepts are all galaxy local and this resolves a number of tensions in cosmology that had largely been discounted by scientists, including the Hubble rate and the age of the universe relative to other processes. The multi-peaked power spectrum of the CMB background may be related to the composite of several black body spectra for constituent particles of space time √¶ther.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2005\n\nRoy J. Glauber‚Äúfor his contribution to the quantum theory of optical coherence‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform this science to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of spacetime √¶ther nor of the Planck particles (electrino and positrino), nor of the composite electrino/positrino structure of the photon.\n\nJohn L. Hall and Theodor W. H√§nsch‚Äúfor their contributions to the development of laser-based precision spectroscopy, including the optical frequency comb technique‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2004\n\nDavid J. Gross, H. David Politzer and Frank Wilczek ‚Äúfor the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction‚Äù\n\nNPQG teaches that the UV divergence, IR divergence, renormalization, and asymptotic freedom are related to the immutability of the Planck scale point charges from whence the universe emerges.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2003\n\nAlexei A. Abrikosov, Vitaly L. Ginzburg and Anthony J. Leggett ‚Äúfor pioneering contributions to the theory of superconductors and superfluids‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG. I would expect rapid advancement in this research area once informed by NPQG.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2002\n\nRaymond Davis Jr. and Masatoshi Koshiba ‚Äúfor pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform neutrino science to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of spacetime √¶ther nor of the Planck scale point charges (electrino and positrino).\n\nRiccardo Giacconi ‚Äúfor pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform astronomy to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of the Euclidean background space of the universe and the corresponding Map 1 equations where observers in Euclidean space would see a variable speed of photons in the spacetime √¶ther which we describe by Map 2 which has Riemannian geometry at all but the smallest scales.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2001\n\nEric A. Cornell, Wolfgang Ketterle and Carl E. Wieman ‚Äúfor the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental studies of the properties of the condensates‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG.

Veltman ‚Äúfor elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions in physics‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform this science to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of spacetime √¶ther nor of the Planck scale point charges (electrino and positrino).\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1998\n\nRobert B. Laughlin, Horst L. St√∂rmer and Daniel C. Tsui ‚Äúfor their discovery of a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally charged excitations‚Äù\n\nI suspect that NPQG will inform this science to a large degree, especially considering that prior science is not aware of spacetime √¶ther nor of the Planck scale point charges (electrino and positrino).\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1997\n\nSteven Chu, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and William D.

Brockhouse‚Äúfor the development of neutron spectroscopy‚Äù\n\nClifford G. Shull‚Äúfor the development of the neutron diffraction technique‚Äù\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1993\n\nRussell A. Hulse and Joseph H. Taylor Jr. ‚Äúfor the discovery of a new type of pulsar, a discovery that has opened up new possibilities for the study of gravitation‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG. I do imagine that this science will be greatly informed by NPQG but I do not know if it will impact this work directly.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1992\n\nGeorges Charpak ‚Äúfor his invention and development of particle detectors, in particular the multiwire proportional chamber‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1991\n\nPierre-Gilles de Gennes ‚Äúfor discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers‚Äù\n\nùõøNPQG.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1990\n\nJerome I.

This includes small physical scale and low energy reactions. Definitely anything involving photons. Definitely anything involving spacetime √¶ther interactions. Certainly standard model and below. Possibly atomic and molecular research.\n\nThe larger the scale of the study domain the more likely that NPQG will have a material impact. This includes high energy scales as well as large distance scales. Impacted subjects span universe as a whole, ŒõCDM cosmology, astronomy beyond our galaxy, galaxy dynamics, black holes, supermassive black holes and their jets, dark matter, dark energy, galaxy rotation curves, and high energy gravitatonal waves.\n\nResearch in-between these extremes of scale is less likely to be directly impacted by NPQG as long as the science has minimal dependency on the narrative from the extremes of scale. That said, there may be advances in these areas that will be enabled by NPQG.\n\nBeyond this point, I‚Äôll comment on the Nobel prizes that are significantly impacted by NPQG.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1985\n\nKlaus von Klitzing‚Äúfor the discovery of the quantized Hall effect‚Äù\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1984\n\nCarlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer ‚Äúfor their decisive contributions to the large project, which led to the discovery of the field particles W and Z, communicators of weak interaction‚Äù\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1983\n\nSubramanyan Chandrasekhar ‚Äúfor his theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars‚Äù\n\nWilliam Alfred Fowler ‚Äúfor his theoretical and experimental studies of the nuclear reactions of importance in the formation of the chemical elements in the universe‚Äù\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1982\n\nKenneth G.
