Helped found the field of oceanography. He shaped the modern science of physiology and made Berlin one of Europe's leading centers for medical research. Used a severed head propped on his wife's piano to study the voice box. Believed to have committed suicide due to despondency over the drowning death of his student when his steamship went down in the Baltic (Mueller himself survived by clinging to a piece of debris).\n\nother students: Emil du Bois-Reymond, Theodor Schwann, Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, Karl Ludwig.
