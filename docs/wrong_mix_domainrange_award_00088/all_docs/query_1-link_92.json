        "text": "Walther Gerlach’s numerous contributions to physics include precision measurements related to the black-body radiation (1912–1916) as well as the first-ever quantitative measurement of the radiation pressure (1923), apart from his key role in the epochal Stern-Gerlach experiment (1921–1922). His wide-ranging research programs at the Universities of Tübingen, Frankfurt, and Munich entailed spectroscopy and spectral analysis, the study of the magnetic properties of matter, and radioactivity. An important player in the physics community already in his 20s and in the German academia in his later years, Gerlach was appointed, on Werner Heisenberg’s recommendation, Plenipotentiary for nuclear research for the last sixteen months of the existence of the Third Reich. He supported the effort of the German physicists to achieve a controlled chain reaction in a uranium reactor until the last moments before the effort was halted by the Allied Alsos Mission. The reader can find additional discus...\n\nTo his friends, colleagues, and students, Martin Klein was a gentle and modest man of extraordinary integrity whose stellar accomplishments garnered him many honors. I sketch his life and career, in which he transformed himself from a theoretical physicist at Columbia University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Case Institute of Technology into a historian of physics while on leave at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Study and the University of Leiden and then pursued this field full time at Yale University.\n\nHistorical methods have long been put to use in the making of natural knowledge. In this article, I examine the use of historical methods by nineteenth-century physicists, focusing on the Austrian researcher Ernst Mach in particular. I argue that Mach applied methods characteristic of the then-dominant historical and philological disciplines to his own discipline of physics. He construed history as a tool for the physicist. On the basis of a study of his notebooks and correspondence with the chemist-turned-historian Emil Wohlwill, I explain what he sought to achieve by means of this tool, and reconstruct the practices characterizing his historical research. These practices included the reading, ordering, and comparison of textual sources. Moreover, Mach appropriated the historical-philological method of source criticism. I show that prominent fellow physicists of Mach, including Johann Poggendorff and Hermann von Helmholtz, made use of similar historical methods, even though their aims were different. Together, the cases of these history-writing physicists illustrate how history and natural science continued to intertwine in a time of increasing disciplinary fragmentation."
