        "text": "PLYMOUTH (WBSM) â€” A 79-year-old customer suffered severe burns and a store employee and an 11-month-old child were also sent to the hospital after a deep fryer shot out hot cooking oil at the Plymouth Market Basket on Thursday.\n\nPlymouth Fire Chief Neil Foley said that the department responded at about 6:46 p.m. on August 1 to a call for burn injuries at the Market Basket, located at 1 Commerce Way.\n\nIt was reported that a deep fryer shot out the hot oil, injuring several people. Firefighters arrived to find cooking oil on the ceiling of the kitchen as well as grease splatter about 15 feet away from the fryer, Foley said.\n\nThree people were evaluated for burn injuries and the fire department shut down the kitchen. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also responded to the scene.\n\nAccording to Foley, a 79-year-old male customer suffered severe burns and was taken by ambulance to the Massachusetts General Hospital Sumner Redstone Burn Center. His name was not released.\n\nA 31-year-old male store employee and an 11-month-old child were also taken by ambulance to South Shore Hospital. Their identities also were not released.\n\nThe cause of the incident remains under investigation by the Plymouth Fire Department and OSHA."
