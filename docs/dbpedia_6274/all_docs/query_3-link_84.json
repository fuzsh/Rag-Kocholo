        "text": "Our squirrel will save the world. Our moose is on the loose. The Cold War just got hot all over again.\n\nAfter years of being trapped in a two-dimensional animated world, those villainous spies from Pottsylvania, Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale have broken the secret code and made the leap into the real world (hiss!) led by the dastardly Fearless Leader (double hiss!). But have no fear-Rocky and Bullwinkle are here (wild applause!)¿get ready for the 21st century.\n\nUniversal Pictures¿ and Tribeca Productions¿ The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is an innovative and irreverent live-action/animated comedy adventure based on Jay Ward¿s classic cartoon, which combines the talents of Robert De Niro as the insidious Fearless Leader, Jason Alexander as the evil Boris Badenov and Rene Russo as the seductress Natasha Fatale. In addition to cameos from such names as Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Carl Reiner and others, the trio are joined by a CGI-created Rocky and Bullwinkle from the wizards of Industrial Light & Magic.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nRocky & Bullwinkle make a successful leap from '60's television program to 21st century theatrical film.¿ The duo that taught the youth of America just what a pun was (and even worse, how to use it) haven't lost a step.¿¿\n\nAfter villains Boris Badenov (Jason Alexander of Seinfeld), Natasha Fatale (Rene Russo) and Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro ¿ yes, that Robert De Niro) manage to cross over to the \"real\" world, the FBI sends Agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo, Coyote Ugly) to enlist the aid of Moose & Squirrel to save the world again.¿ Along the way, it's cameo city and punster hell.¿ If you know someone who hates silly humor and sight gags they wouldn't even have used in Naked Gun, then drag them to see this film and watch them squirm.\n\nRocky the Flying Squirrel, Fearless Leader (De Niro), Boris (Alexander), Natasha (Russo), and Bullwinkle J. Moose\n\nDe Niro's Fearless Leader doing the classic \"are you talkin' to me?\" bit from Taxi Driver is worth the price of a ticket alone. De Niro, an admitted fan of the old series, looks like he's having a great time. And why shouldn't he? Rocky & Bullwinkle were everything that made kid's shows great in the '60's. The humor made you laugh but you really had to be using your brain to get the jokes. This wasn't spoon fed prat falls; if you didn't get the joke then you had some studying to do.\n\nWhile the film isn't quite on the same level as the TV series, there's plenty to keep the fans going (some of the sight gags scream for a second viewing) plus there's enough obvious humor (Boris & Natasha falling from several stories up, blowing themselves up, etc.) for the kids in the audience. But don't make the mistake of thinking about Rocky & Bullwinkle as a kid's movie ¿ I'm willing to bet most of the kids in the audience will be just like mine, dragged there by their parents.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nThe film is far from perfect and at times almost gets too cute for its own good.¿ The cameos by actors like Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg (who plays a character called \"Judge Cameo\"), Janeane Garofalo, John Goodman and Jonathan Winters (who appears as at least four different characters) do everything but wink into the camera.¿ It's obvious that everyone here loves the material but that also creates some lost opportunities for laughs.¿ One scene in particular features another cartoon character that's just a sort of generic cartoon animal instead of someone like Mr. Peabody.¿ These lost opportunities result in a few slow sections but they're easily forgiven when the film is firing on all cylinders.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n\nNone."
