        "text": "In 1988, a little movie called Who Framed Roger Rabbit broke ground with its combination of live-action and animation. Even if it wasn’t the first film to do so, Roger Rabbit did it in such a way to where you believed that actors were really working with cartoon characters (a dream come true for any animation-loving kid). It, in turn, inspired a few other films to try that same form of magic. But out of all the hybrids that came after Roger Rabbit, one film managed to be overlooked where it ended up in a pile of forgotten films, and that film is The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Based on the Jay Ward cartoon, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends. I didn’t really grow up with the cartoon much, but I had a VHS of it as a kid, so I have a little knowledge of the characters. Yet from what I understand of the show itself, it was sort of like a sketch series for kids, starring a flying squirrel named Rocky, and his dimwitted moose friend named Bullwinkle as they go on a series of wacky adventures with criminal masterminds, Boris and Natasha trying to outwit them. The show also included other characters such as Mr. Peabody and Sherman, a dog and boy duo who travel through different periods of time as they teach history in a parodical way, and a Canadian Mountie named Dudley Do-Right as he tries to stop the dastardly Snidley Whiplash and his crimes. It lasted 163 episodes and got cancelled in 1964, where it made a living off of re-runs.\n\nIt all seemed to fade into obscurity over the years, except to those who fondly remember the cartoon. So having a movie should be a good way to bring a long-forgotten comedy duo into the modern world for a chance to appeal to a new generation of kids, right? Well, apparently, it didn’t work as the film not only failed to impress critics, but it also ended up alienating audiences. It could be stated that the films’ failure was due to its dated humor, or lack of interest for those who were too old to appreciate the cartoon, and those young enough not to be familiar with it. Whatever the case may be, not much is said about the film, other than it being a joke. In the years since, I have noticed more appreciation for The Adventures of Rocky And Bullwinkle among critics who knew the source material well enough to appreciate its cheap gags and badly-written humor (Even Roger Ebert praised it for staying true to the original cartoon, and ended up being one of the few critics who actually liked it). I even watched it enough times as a kid on VHS, but I also was disappointed in its approach on adapting the original cartoon to the big screen; I didn’t appreciate how meta it was. As an adult knowing all this, I find myself mixed on how to feel about it. Is it terrible? Is it clever? What kind of merit does it even have? Revisiting it last night, I still don’t know how to feel about it. But maybe there is something to truly appreciate about it.\n\nThe movie takes place during the aftermath of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, when we learn during a brief history of 1964 and its significant events, that despite having a good run, that it was cancelled. This has caused a problem in the cartoon world, as it isn’t thriving like it used to be. Frostbite Falls has become a wasteland where the trees have stopped growing. Rocky has gone through a hopeless depression, losing the spunk to fly, while Bullwinkle is still as dimwitted as ever; both living off residual checks due to reruns. While Fearless Leader, Boris Badenov, and Natasha Fatale are losing any hope of conquer. Even the show’s narrator (Voice of Keith Scott) is living at his mother’s house, where he is reduced to narrating her every day life. It isn’t until the three villains find a way to a TV station in Hollywood where executive producer, Minnie Mogul (Janeane Garofalo) is rifling through scripts, in which the plot kicks off, as they trick Mogul into signing a contract to greenlight a Rocky and Bullwinkle movie, bringing them into the real world, where they are portrayed by actors Robert De Niro (Fearless Leader), Jason Alexander (Boris), and Rene Russo (Natasha) as they set out to control the world with a TV station which they call RBTV (Really Bad TeleVision) in order to turn everyone into zombies (A supposed comment on the world’s consumption of mindless programming).\n\nAfter learning of Fearless Leader’s plan, FBI director Cappy Von Trapment (Randy Quaid) recruits young agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) to take down all three villains in the only way possible, by bringing moose and squirrel into the real world via movie magic by the literal green light of Hollywood. (Though they are in CG form, but voice performances retained by Keith Scott and June Foray) on a road trip/fantasy adventure to stop the Pottsylvanians from reaching world domination, with Boris and Natasha hellbent on taking down moose and squirrel permanently. What follows are a gaggle of puns, constant fourth wall breaks, and even a few celebrity cameos for good measure.\n\nHow does one fully grasp The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle without understanding its source material? As a movie, I see why it didn’t work as the film constantly goes joke after joke with no sense of stopping, making its efforts at comedy extremely tiring, and that would be enough for a modern audience at the time to handle, but there is also an ambition to its commitment of horrible gags and weak humor that it comes off as nearly admirable, with its jokes even being hilarious over time. The casting of De Niro, Alexander, and Russo is perfect. Many wonder why they stooped so low and took these roles, with money rumored to be the reason, but I think they play their parts well. While seeing Rocky and Bullwinkle exit their world being fish out of water as they try to navigate a world that has changed since they have been on TV, while bantering the whole way is interesting to say the least.\n\nThe question of whether The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is terrible or secretly clever is a baffling one to answer. But the real question is: Does it matter? In my opinion, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle lives in its own world where stupidity knows no limit. In the world of The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, every cheap gag and horrible sense of humor defies logic and ensures that there are no bounds to be constricted by. So while The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle may be terrible in a traditional sense. Its ability to exist on its own wavelength and wearing its lack of logic on its sleeve makes me love it that much. It’s not Who Framed Roger Rabbit good, nor is it The Room bad. The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is just what it is; its own planet where the criteria doesn’t apply"
