        "text": "Journey down under and meet a whole new breed of hero in \"Koala Kid,\" a laugh-filled, action-packed animated adventure with a rare white koala bear who just wants to fit in. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Canela R likes this movie \"because it has a funny story and at the same time, action and suspense is thrown in with lots of twists and turns.\"\n\nKoala Kid by Canela R\n\nSee Canela’s full video review here!\n\n“Koala Kid” is a animated film about a white Koala who doesn’t he think he fits in with his community of gray Koalas and comes to believe that he has special talents which he thinks can prove to everyone that he belongs. He does this by going on a miraculous journey to defeat an evil crocodile named Bog.\n\nThe Koala Kid’s name is Johnny and he’s voiced by Rob Schneider. As his journey continues he meets Miranda, a gray Koala (Yvonne Strahvoski), Hamish the Tasmanian Devil (Bret McKenzie) and his Monkey Photographer Lokie (Charlie Bewley). They battle with their wits and through action with Bog the villainous Crocodile (Alan Cumming, the Bad Guy from Spy Kids!) and his chief henchman, Blacktooth the Dingo (Tim Curry).\n\nThere is one moment that seems to capture the humor and suspense of this movie perfectly. When Bog the evil Croc is sleeping, the tiny wombats take Snorkles into the pond and capture Bog with a net. When Bog awakes, he shrugs them off of him as if it is nothing. I didn’t want to laugh because the Wombats are so cute, but it is funny.\n\nI really like the animation in this film because it feels as if you’re really in the hot outback with all these fun characters.\n\nThe colorfulness adds to the fun I experienced. There is also one song in the movie which continues the colorfulness and had both me AND my mom tapping our feet, “Do You Come From a Land Down Under.” I think I’m still tapping my feet.\n\nI think the message of this movie is no matter what you look like, you can always become a hero.\n\nIf you like adventurous cartoons as much as I do, then “Koala Kid” is the movie for you. I recommend this to kids ages six to sixteen because as much as it is a lifelong lesson that you can always use. There are some suspenseful moments that could be scary to the younger ones.\n\nI rate this movie five out of five stars because it’s hilarious and colorful which speaks to the mind of kids and teens.\n\nKoala Kid is available now on DVD.\n\nCheck out KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Gerry O’s Koala Kid interview here!\n\nParental Guidance, rated PG, is truly a film for the whole family. A hilarious vision of how families relate to one another, kids, parents and grandparents. Starring the fabulous talents of Bette Midler and Billy Crystal, this film has a long range appeal.\n\nKIDS FIRST! Film Critic, 8-year-old Morgan Bertsch, says this story has an important moral: “if everyone works together things will come out all right” and Victoria Burns, 14-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic says that people will like this film because they “can relate to the differences between parents and grandparents.”\n\nOur very own Cheyenne Nguyen, 9-year old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, was able to interview some of the talent on this film. Click here to see her wonderful video interviews!\n\nParental Guidance\n\nReviewed by Victoria Burns\n\nClick here to see Victoria’s full video review!\n\nThis is an experience! It was interesting to see different styles of parenting, from generation to generation. This movie gives an unusual perspective on parenting, whether it be by using a smart house, or screaming at teachers; this movie is enlightening.\n\nWhen I stepped in the theater to see the movie, I did not know what to expect. It is hilarious! I can relate to the strange transition from what parents would let a children do and grandparents that let children do anything. This movie follows the Simmons family who believe in a more, “I’ll let you consider the consequences and make the right choice” type of parenting; and the parents that never get to have time alone together. So when the inventor father: Phil Simmons (Tom Everett Scott) is nominated for an award out of state, he and his wife Alice (Marisa Tomei) decide to take this trip for some much needed alone time. They call Phil’s parents to watch them, but they are away on vacation; Alice dreads to ask her judgmental parents, but they say yes. Let the games begin.\n\nMeet Artie Decker (Billy Crystal) a newly fired baseball announcer and his wife Diane (Bette Midler), a retired weather girl. These grandparents’ main goal is to make their grandchildren love them, and to no longer be the “other grandparents.” They are being entrusted to care for three children: Harper (Bailee Madison), 12 going on 50 and an aspiring violinist; Turner (Joshua Rush), a shy boy with a stutter; and Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf), the youngest with a hard time making real friends, so he has an imaginary one. This is a new type of environment for Artie and Diane, who try their best to do a good job, but cannot because their daughter will not release her hold and go with her husband. We see how Diane and Artie form a relationship with their grandchildren, and Artie and Alice rekindle theirs also.\n\nPersonally, I would probably only watch this movie once because these types of movies are entertaining but become tiring quickly. I think that children and most adults would enjoy it because of the comedy aspect. This movie also is not too long so younger children will not get restless. I recommend this movie for ages six and up because they can relate to the differences between parents and grandparents. I give this movie four and a half stars out of five because I do not usually favor quirky family comedies. This is a good movie and a great movie to watch with your family. Victoria Burns, age 14, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.\n\nParental Guidance\n\nReviewed by Morgan Bertsch\n\nClick here to see Morgan’s full video review!\n\nThe preview of this movie was very cute. It is a story about a mom and dad who want to go on a vacation together. The question is, who will watch the three children. They decide to ask the grandparents. The favorite grandparents are busy and cannot come so they have to call the other grandparents. “RI” is a new house that is all computerized and the dad’s project. The technology is very confusing to the grandparents. It is a very cool house that everyone will want to own.\n\nMarisa Tomei is a mother, trying to juggle a family and a job. She is trying to do the best job she can but there are many choices of how to raise your children. Tom Everett Scott plays dad, who just wants his wife to be proud of him and misses spending time with her alone. The kids are adorable. I love the kangaroo. Barker has a strong grip and doesn’t want his mother to leave. This will have you laughing. Harper is an amazing violist and the perfect big sister. Turner has issues but learns to overcome them. The old grandparents do not always understand the way their daughter is raising her children. They do not follow her rules. When they find out they are not the favorites they decide it is time to take action and make the children love them. Even I know sugar makes kids crazy. Cake any one?\n\nMy favorite scene was when they play kick the can. Playing in the rain is always fun; add a game and it is funtastic. My favorite character was the grandmother because Bette Midler stood up for her granddaughter. She was funny and even had a scene with her famous singing voice. The grandfather, Billy Crystal, would be great to hang out with because he loves baseball and so do I. He believes in this movie so much that he also signed on as a producer.\n\nThe moral is, if everyone works together things will come out all right. Sometimes it takes a little time to understand someone else’s ways. All ages will love this movie from the young 5 to the elder 105. It is about different ages all trying to understand each other, learn from each other and getting to place of being a happy family. I give this movie 5 twinkling stars. It was cute, funny and made for everyone. Morgan Bertsch, age 8, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.\n\nWant more? Click here for video reviews of Parental Guidance from Cheyenne Nguyen and Julia Chestnut!\n\nKIDS FIRST! Film Critic Morgan Bertsch, age 8, attended an exciting preview of three DreamWorks films scheduled to come out in 2013. All in 3D, Turbo, The Croods and Mr. Peabody and Sherman, are all sure to be box office hits. Morgan got to meet a lot of famous folks who were pleased to have such a lovely young interviewer.\n\nPreview Event for Turbo, Mr. Peabody and Sherman and The Croods. All coming to the theaters 2013.\n\nReview by Morgan Bertsch, age 8, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic\n\nI had an amazing time. I got to see the previews of three of the movies coming out in 2013 brought to you by DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox all in 3D.\n\nTurbo is the story about a snail that is tired of being slow and longs to be a racer. Turbo has a brother who of course doubts Turbo will do much of anything in the way of excitement. He gets the power of lightning fast speed after an accident. The Indianapolis 500 is in his future. The graphics are amazing. There are tons of new characters to meet. I think everyone will love this movie coming out July 19, 2013.\n\nMr. Peabody and Sherman is about the smartest dog in the world who adopts a little boy. He takes him on many adventures in his time machine to teach him about the world. He gets to experience the past in real life. We learn that Sherman loves cake, like all kids, but this turns out to be a bad thing. This story is based on a series produced by Jay Ward, who did The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle. I had the pleasure of meeting his daughter Tiffany Ward who is one of the Executive Producers on this animated feature film. She is very pretty and wonderful to talk to. I think that carrying on her father’s legacy is very cool. I can’t wait until November 1, 2013 when we all get to see this movie and on go on the many adventures. The preview leaves us wondering what will become of Sherman since he stole the time machine, has taken a classmate with him and lost her.\n\nThe Croods was very funny. It is a little strange because it is about some wild cavemen and women. They are afraid of everything outdoors. All the neighbors seem to disappear. The teenage daughter tries to date a stranger and the whole family flips out. When their cave is destroyed they must rely on him and their family to find a new home. In true DreamWorks style, the scenes were original, colorful and different from anything you have seen before. I got to talk to Chris Sanders, who is also the voice of Stitch from Lilo and Stitch. He is one of the writers of The Croods. He really loves to draw and told me that they took different parts of various animals and mixed them together to come up with the crazy creatures you see in this movie. I have met and chatted with Cloris Leachman, who once again did an incredible job. She is the voice of Gran the Grandmother. Gran is very cute and very hungry. Let’s just say they all need to learn some table manners or well, learn what a table is first. They are cavemen after all. We will be able to see this March 22, 2013 in theaters.\n\nWhen we left the filming we got to eat at three different stations. Turbo’s station was all decked out with checkered racing stripes and Tacos were being served. Mr. Peabody and Sherman’s station had crepes to die for and The Croods had burlap table clothes and scrumptious omelets.\n\nDreamWorks always manages to make our dreams appear on the big screen and it looks like 2013 will be an amazing, fun time at the movies. I am so looking forward to seeing all of them.\n\nThe fact that Quill had been a big hit in Japan when it was released in 2005 was not the main reason Ed Arentz, managing director of Music Box Films, was attracted to the opportunity for his company to distribute the film in the United States. Part of the company’s programming strategy to obtain “art-house” films for kids, Quill: The Life of a Guide Dog was released to theaters and VOD platforms this past May and streets July 10 on DVD.\n\nAlthough it had been a top 10 release in 2005 in Japan and had done well in other markets, its screenings in the U.S. were mostly at festivals, which is where Arentz “happened to see it,” he says. “It spoke to me on a personal level,” he shares. The story follows the life of one remarkable dog from his puppy days through his time as a service animal to a disabled man and into his old age. For Arentz, the connection was immediate. “[I saw it] during a period of time when my daughter, wife and I were foster parents to seeing-eye puppies.”\n\nHe felt the movie was a great tribute to dogs in general, and “especially to these breeds, the enormously helpful service dogs. They are remarkable partners in so many different activities, able to do things we can’t do for ourselves.”\n\nBelieving Quill to be a moving film that would speak to others as it had to his family, Arentz says, “The biggest challenges were convincing colleagues and partners that this was a film we should get involved with.”\n\nHe gave it an extended title, adding to the simple name of the dog it biographies (“Quill”) the more informational “The Life of a Guide Dog.” And the company added subtitles. Not that there is much dialog, anyway, Arentz points out. “Quill is not a fantasy animal; he doesn’t speak. We intuit what Quill is thinking from the actions.\n\n“The story, we felt, was affecting and direct enough, it didn’t need to be guided that much by subtitles.” Comparing the film to a picture book, Arentz says even a 5- or 6-year-old could follow the story. “A child will easily understand the emotional aspect of the story” – with maybe just a little input from his or her parent, filling in any additional details the subtitles provide.\n\nThis final paragraph comes to readers with a “spoiler alert” warning, so you may wish to read no further.\n\n“Like the best dog films, from Old Yeller to Marly, this film ends in a bittersweet way,” says Arentz. But based on his own experience as a foster parent to three potential seeing-eye dogs (two of whom graduated to become seeing-eye companions and one of whom remains with his family as a pet), he feels the film is a very honest portrayal of dogs he calls “remarkable.”\n\nEd Arentz shares more about Quill: The Life of a Guide Dog as a guest on this week’s episode of KIDS FIRST! Coming Attractions, which streams on Voice America Kids.\n\nPhotos: Quill: The Life of a Guide Dog DVD box art (top), Ed Arentz (bottom)\n\nA horse with a big heart, wide-open-space scenery and great country music, all packaged in a heartwarming tale of good overcoming adversity – this is a movie that has it all. Released May 1 from 20th Century Fox in a Walmart and Sam’s Club exclusive (and also in a Flicka collection available on amazon.com), it has our KIDS FIRST! youth critics Brianna Beaton (age 12) and Julianna Noone (age 12) also singing its praises. The bond between horse and rider is one of the special aspects that touches Brianna most, and she shares the insight that the bond is what “allows them to trust each other to ride and compete.” “… Flicka plays an important role in helping people overcome obstacles in their lives,” observes Julianna, sharing the movie’s important message that “if you always give your best effort, the outcome doesn’t really matter because you gave it your all.”\n\nClint Black, country music superstar and Grammy Award winner, stars alongside wife Lisa Hartman. The Blu-ray and DVD includes a never-before-seen music video as well as two behind-the-scenes featurettes on the making of the film that give more insight on the singer’s involvement with the Flicka franchise.\n\nFlicka: Country Pride\n\nReviewed by Brianna Beaton\n\n(See her full review on video.)\n\nThis is a very moving and touching film with great country music.\n\nI truly like this film because of all the bonding it has between a horse and her rider. They bond quickly, which allows them to trust each other to ride and compete. The acting by everyone is really good; however Stephanie Meyers (Siobhan Williams) acts extremely well and she stands out from the rest. It really makes me not like Stephanie because of how well she is portraying this mean character. The cinematography gives you great pictures of Flicka with her amazing jumping capabilities and allows you to appreciate this beautiful horse. I love the countryside — it is soooo pretty and you can see why someone would just absolutely love being in the country with nature. It’s a very relaxing atmosphere.\n\nFlicka: Country Pride is a sequel to Flicka 2. It tells the story of Kelly (Kacey Rohl) and a wild mustang whose name is Flicka. They quickly bond and Kelly hopes to get Flicka into an upcoming competition. But the competition is fast approaching, and Kelly faces the additional stress of a rival trainer who plays dirty along with a growing fear of having to sell the stable. Then Toby (country singer Clint Black) gets involved to save the day. Good\n\nDirected by Michael Damian (Flicka 2, Marley & Me), Flicka: Country Pride also has great country music by Clint Black that will definitely satisfy your craving for great country music. Even though I’m not a big country music fan, the music is still pleasant to listen to. My favorite part of the film is when Flicka first appears — she is so pretty.\n\nIn watching this film, I feel a great message would be to never lose hope. Always keep in sight your dreams and what you believe in. Be determined and focused!\n\nAlthough this is mainly a family film, it is rated G and I recommend it to ages 5 to 12. This will definitely appeal to all horse lovers at heart.\n\nI give this film 4 out of 5 stars because, while it certainly has a good plot, it is just a tad drawn out and I kind of knew what to expect.\n\nFlicka: Country Pride is absolutely a good film and I can almost promise that you will enjoy it as much as I do. It gallops onto DVD the first of May. So go gather up everyone and enjoy this family film.\n\nFlicka: Country Pride\n\nReviewed by Julianna Noone\n\n(See her full review on video.)\n\nFlicka: Country Pride is a great film for the entire family. This film stars Kacey Rohl (Red Riding Hood) as Kelly, Lisa Hartman (Back To You and Me) as Lindy, country music star Clint Black (Flicka 2) as Toby, Max Lloyd Jones (Girl Fight) as Briggs and Siobhan Williams (Radio Rebel) as Stephanie.\n\nThis is a wonderful and heartwarming story about a family struggling to overcome a tragedy and difficult times and how they work through this, with the help of some friends. This film is about a very special horse — Flicka, a beautiful black mustang — and the special bond the wild horse builds with Kelly. After Kelly’s father dies, she shuts everyone out of her life, but Flicka slowly breaks her down and gives her some hope.\n\nFlicka comes into Kelly’s life along with her owner, Toby, who becomes the new stable manager after Kelly’s father dies. Just as Flicka does for Kelly, Toby is there for Lindy, Kelly’s mom, when she needs it the most.\n\nOne of my favorite scenes is when Kelly and Stephanie battle in a riding competition over a boy they are fighting over. In this scene, Stephanie repeatedly tries to kick Kelly and knock her off her horse and win no matter what. This backfires on her, though, as it is Stephanie who falls off her horse. My other favorite scene is when Toby is working in his new office and reads the writing on the wall: “If you give it your all you’ve already won.” This is a phrase that Kelly’s dad liked to use and follow, and it reminds Kelly of her father. It’s a touching point in the movie and is very moving. It’s a good message for everyone to try and follow, in that if you always give your best effort, the outcome doesn’t really matter because you gave it your all.\n\nMy favorite character is Flicka because, even though Flicka is a horse, in this film as well as the first two films Flicka plays an important role in helping people overcome obstacles in their lives.\n\nThe film is shot on location in British Columbia, Canada, and the countryside is beautiful and makes you want to go outside and go horseback riding. The stunt coordinator, Kirk Jarrett, did a great job in setting the action scenes on the horses. The riding scenes were well shot and fun to watch.\n\nI rate this film 4 out of 5 stars and would recommend this film as well as the first two Flicka films for ages 5 to 105. Kids of all ages, particularly horse lovers, will enjoy these wholesome family-friendly films. Look for this film on DVD and Blu-ray starting May 1st. I can’t wait to watch this film again!\n\nPhotos: Flicka: Country Pride poster (top), Brianna Beaton (middle, Julianna Noone (bottom)"
