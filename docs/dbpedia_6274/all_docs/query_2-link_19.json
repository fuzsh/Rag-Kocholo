        "text": "It's been more than thirty years since their TV show was cancelled and the most famous residents of Frostbite Falls, MN - better known as Rocky J. Squirrel (voice of JUNE FORAY) and Bullwinkle J. Moose (voice of KEITH SCOTT) - have since been stuck in perpetual reruns.\n\nThat changes when their longtime archenemies and overall No-Goodniks from Pottsylvania -- Fearless Leader (ROBERT DE NIRO) and his two bumbling assistants, Boris (JASON ALEXANDER) and Natasha (RENE RUSSO) -- manage to escape into the real world. By broadcasting their RBTV (Really Bad TV) programming signals across the country, Fearless Leader plots to turn everyone in America into mindless zombies incapable of independent thought, and then make them vote for him as the next President.\n\nThat doesn't sit well with the current chief executive, President Signoff (JAMES REBHORN) and so FBI agent Cappy Von Trapment (RANDY QUAID) assigns rookie agent Karen Sympathy (PIPER PERABO) to find the only characters capable of stopping such a diabolical plan - Rocky and Bullwinkle - and get them to New York City before Fearless Leader makes his executive broadcast to the nation.\n\nAfter retrieving the two cartoon characters into the real world, Sympathy, and her two animated companions, then set out on a cross-country trek to stop Fearless Leader. As they do so, however, they must contend with various complications and obstacles, including those introduced by Boris and Natasha who've been assigned to stop Rocky and Bullwinkle at any cost.\n\nHere's a quick look at the content found in this PG-rated film. Brief language (a few minor profanities and colorful phrases) are what earn the film its rating. Various instances of slapstick style violence occur (where people are unintentionally and certainly not seriously injured), while some brief comedy style violence is also present in the form of two characters repeatedly trying to harm others.\n\nA few of those scenes and others may be a bit suspenseful to the youngest of viewers, but all of them are played solely for laughs or action and not to be scary. The villains obviously have bad attitudes, but in a cartoon-like way, various weaponry in present at different points of the film, and a few characters drink and smoke.\n\nShould you still be concerned about the film's content and its appropriateness for anyone in your home, you may want to take a closer look at our detailed content listings for more specific details and information about what occurs in the film."
