        "text": "Did you know there are now 66 locations across the Land of 10,000 Lakes where you can dig into the hamburger that's been named America's favorite?\n\nTo say hamburgers are one of our favorite foods here in the North Star State and across the country might be a bit of an understatement. A good burger might be our FAVORITE food overall. Because here in the U.S. we eat a LOT of them!\n\nYahoo News reports that Americans consume over 50 billion hamburgers every year. (Yes, that's a billion, with a 'b'!) If you do the math on that number, it means, on average, Americans will eat 2.4 burgers every day. And we've loved burgers for a fairly long time, too. Yahoo says the first burger was sold back in 1904 at the St. Louis Louisiana Purchase Exposition.\n\nALSO INTERESTING: Restaurant Chain Founded in Minnesota Just Filed For Bankruptcy\n\nThere are, of course, a lot places that will sell you a burger these days. But only one of them has been called America's Favorite Burger-- and there are 66 places you can get your hands on one here in the North Star State.\n\nSo which burger IS America's Favorite? According to Eat This Not That!, that title goes to Culver's-- which was founded across the Cheddar Curtain over in Sauk City, Wisconsin. According to their survey, Culver's scored highest among America's burger chains in terms of customer satisfaction, allowing them to walk away with the title of America's Best Burger.\n\nSpecifically, Eat This Not That! said Culver's placed first in their survey for several reasons:\n\nCulver's wowed the guests who dined at its 882 locations, averaging an impressive score of 4.34 out of 5. To put it in perspective, Sonic Drive-In came in second with a much lower 3.69 average rating.\n\nAs we mentioned, Culver's was founded over in America's Dairyland and just celebrated its 40th anniversary earlier this summer. The very first Culver's opened back in 1984, and has expanded to 146 stores there. Across the Midwest, you can also find Culvers in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, and South Dakota.\n\nHere in our neck of the woods, Minnesota currently operates 66 Culver's locations, including the following cities (though some have several Culver's locations):\n\nBaxter\n\nSt. Cloud\n\nWaite Park\n\nAlexandria\n\nGrand Rapids\n\nMonticello\n\nElk River\n\nAlbertville\n\nBuffalo\n\nRogers\n\nCambridge\n\nAnoka\n\nMaple Grove\n\nHutchinson\n\nDelano\n\nBemidji\n\nCoon Rapids\n\nPlymouth\n\nChamplin\n\nBlaine\n\nBrooklyn Center\n\nWilmar\n\nGolden Valley\n\nSt. Anthony\n\nLittle Canada\n\nMinnetonka\n\nVadnais Heights\n\nDuluth\n\nWaconia\n\nEden Prairie\n\nWayzata\n\nSt. Paul\n\nWhite Bear Lake\n\nChanhassen\n\nForest Lake\n\nChaska\n\nBloomington\n\nShakopee\n\nWest St. Paul\n\nSavage\n\nStillwater\n\nWoodbury\n\nCottage Grove\n\nEagan\n\nLakeville\n\nApple Valley\n\nRosemount\n\nTwo Harbors\n\nHastings\n\nNorthfield\n\nNorth Mankato\n\nRed Wing\n\nMarshall\n\nOwatonna\n\nRochester\n\nAustin\n\nWinona\n\nBehind Culver's and Sonic, Mooyah, Five Guys, and Fuddruckers rounded out the top five in the Eat This Not That! America's Best Burger survey. And while some of those chains might be a bit unfamiliar, keep scrolling to check out the most popular and well-known brands in the U.S.\n\nListen to Curt St. John & Samm Adams\n\nweekdays from 6 to 10 a.m. on Quick Country 96.5"
