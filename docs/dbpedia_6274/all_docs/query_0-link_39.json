        "text": "LOS ANGELES: Animated film \"Mr Peabody & Sherman\" rose to top dog at North America's box office this weekend, as hi-octane action movie \"Need for Speed\" was slow off the grid, industry data showed Monday.\n\nThe critically acclaimed children's film, based on characters from the 1960s television cartoon \"Rocky and Bullwinkle,\" follows the adventures of a super-intelligent canine who adopts a human infant.\n\nThe Fox movie, which features the voice of \"Modern Family\" star Ty Burrell as the heroic talking canine Mr Peabody, took $21.8 million on its second week of release, figures from Exhibitor Relations showed.\n\nThe three-day haul was strong enough to knock ancient Greece fantasy-action movie \"300: Rise of an Empire\" from atop the box office standings.\n\nThe gory follow-up to the 2007 hit \"300\" added $19.2 million to its strong opening weekend.\n\nThe latest film, based on a not-yet-released graphic novel by Frank Miller, sees the return of several characters from the first film, notably the fearsome Persian warrior Xerxes, played by Rodrigo Santoro.\n\nIn a disappointing third place for its makers was \"Need for Speed,\" the fast-paced car-chase action film inspired by the videogame of the same name.\n\nThe film, which features \"Breaking Bad\" star Aaron Paul in his first major movie role since the award-winning television series ended last year, took $17.8 million.\n\nFourth place was occupied by \"Non-Stop,\" the Liam Neeson action movie set on a long-haul flight.\n\nThe film added another $10.6 million to its total earnings.\n\nOne place behind was \"The Single Moms Club,\" the latest offering from prolific actor-director Tyler Perry, about five struggling mothers who set aside their differences to bond in a support group.\n\nThe film took $8.1 million on debut.\n\nSixth place was \"The Lego Movie,\" the hit animated film inspired by the children's toy building blocks, with $7.7 million.\n\nReligious epic \"Son of God\" added $5.5 million to take seventh spot.\n\nThe quirky humor of \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" forced its way into the top 10 on its second week of release.\n\nThe film by Wes Anderson (\"The Royal Tenenbaums\", \"Fantastic Mr Fox\") took eighth place with $3.6 million.\n\nRounding out the top 10 were Disney's Oscar-winning animated hit \"Frozen\" with $2.1 million and George Clooney's historical thriller \"The Monuments Men,\" which earned just under $2.1 million."
