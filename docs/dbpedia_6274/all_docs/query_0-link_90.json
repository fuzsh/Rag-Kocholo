        "text": "Elle was born and raised in Scotland but currently resides in Los Angeles.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Elle is also a singer/songwriter whose vocals and music have been featured in radio, commercials, film and television in both Europe and the USA. A classically trained vocalist, she has studied voice with coaches from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, La Scala in Italy and voice builder Gary Catona. She has shared the bill with a diverse range of musical acts in various genres including Travis, Natalie Imbruglia and the Pointer Sisters. Elle has also scored and composed music for film.\n\nElle recently voiced the character Oracle in the fourth installment of the Socom video game for Sony Playstation.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, and raised in New York City, Jessica DiCicco grew up on the Upper West side of Manhattan.

During what she thought was a typical day in her second grade class, actress Marlo Thomas selected her from thousands of New York school children to appear on the ABC special Free to Be... a Family (1988). She worked on the show for one year and was heavily featured in the final broadcast. Soon after, Jessica landed her first role in the film Der Pate 3 (1990) followed by the cult classic Ein ganz normales Wunder (1993), and booked multiple national commercial spots including Cheerios, Burger King, and a groundbreaking Nike campaign directed by Spike Lee. She also lent her voice to many television and radio projects and appeared in numerous productions for theater, feature film and television, including the lead in a Nickelodeon pilot, Bus No. 9 (1998), which earned her a nomination for a Young Artists Award.\n\nJessica's ambition and drive also manifested itself in her academics and passion for photography. She was an excellent student, always making her education top priority. Also an outstanding photographer, Jessica was the youngest photographer to ever shoot the cover of New York Magazine, in addition to shooting the entire eight-page cover story. This issue became one of the largest selling issues in New York Magazine's history.\n\nMaurice LaMarche is a Canadian-born comedian and voice actor from Toronto, Ontario who has lived and worked in the United States since 1980.
