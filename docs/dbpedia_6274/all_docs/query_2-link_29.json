        "text": "Ahh… the joys of Saturday morning TV. So often, studios have turned the cartoons we enjoyed so much as kids into live-action, overbloated disappointments. Now, Universal brings us “The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle”.\n\nI entered the theatre with some trepidation: was this the same R&B I enjoyed between smatterings of “Fractured Fairy Tales” and “Sherman and Mr. Peabody”? Short answer: yes. Aside from a few items, Rocky and Bullwinkle do indeed live on the silver screen.\n\nOf course, Rocky and Bullwinkle are a flying squirrel and moose who live in Frostbite Falls, MN, a town which has suffered since the cancellation of the R&B television show. Everything has changed, except our heroes… and our villains.\n\nFearless Leader (Robert De Niro, “Taxi Driver” and “Raging Bull”) leads his two agents of evil, Boris (played with perfection by Jason Alexander, “Seinfeld”, “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”) and Natasha (with equal perfection by Rene Russo, “Lethal Weapon 4,” “Ransom”) to the 3-D world in hopes of taking over the world. The FBI sends agent Karen Sympathy (newcomer Piper Perabo) to get R&B. What follows is a plot that goes from the deserts of Arizona, to the deserts of Oklahoma, to Bullwinkle’s alma mater, to… well, you get the idea.\n\nIndeed, from an artistic point of view, you do get the idea, just not the entire story… and that’s the way they want it. Just like every other adventure the twosome have had, the movie is episodic, has numerous pointless side trips, and ends up just being a big barrel of fun.\n\nThere’s not too much to get offended at, either. I did knock off a few points for a completely unnecessary d*mn, and for a scene where Boris and Natasha share a tub, but then, they are evil… Karen Sympathy lies, but the lies are treated as a very bad thing that she did in order to repress her good, fun loving true nature.\n\nIn conclusion, “R&B” is a silly movie that should please fans and families alike. It’s not intelligent, but then I always suspected Bullwinkle’s degree was honorary."
