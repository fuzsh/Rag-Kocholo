        "text": "GOING to the movies used to be no big deal for kids. Many of us would see films the way we read books: because it never occurred to us not to. I remember walking, every Saturday, to the RKO or the Loew's on East 86th Street. There'd be a double bill, and no one was too particular about what was playing or what time it started. ''This is where I came in'' still had meaning then, and often it wasn't until the movie ended and began again that you learned what the title was. My friends and I saw every single movie that was made for us, and many that weren't. And later, we also occasionally sat upstairs in the balcony and necked and sneaked cigarettes, but that's another story. Or perhaps not.\n\nNowadays -- in these much more salubrious, enlightened days of ratings and $5 popcorn and clean, no-smoking, no-talking theaters -- when people take their children to the movies, what do they want to get out of it? Perhaps it just happens to be the shape that an American family outing takes, especially when the weather isn't fabulous.\n\nJudging by the amount of complaining and the lack of specificity, it seems that many people know only what they don't want. They don't want to be left flat. They want to have fun with their kids. That's all, really, that people demand of the movies for their families: they want to be happy.\n\n''How was it? Was it violent? Was it scary?'' you'll hear one adult say to another. And they're talking about ''Stuart Little.'' Surely, there must be a correlation between the huge number of new books on parenting and the extraordinary concern about so-called family movies. Worried parents have taken to wandering in a maze of intricacies of what is and isn't appropriate -- appropriate language; appropriate amount of violence, sex, fear, diversity; appropriate amount of stimulation and lack thereof; appropriate amount of play of the imagination; appropriate amount of good and bad news about life.\n\nWell, then, parents of small and mid-size children had better strap themselves in. Getting ready to zoom, glide, slide, swat, trundle and chug-a-chug-a onto their neighborhood screens this summer is a particularly vexing collection of movies, buttressed by colossal ad campaigns, marketing deals, tie-ins, link-ups, crossover and franchising strategies. Why vexing? Because each is like a discrete galaxy. How do you tell, ahead of time, whether you're going to be happy outside the Milky Way?\n\n''Chicken Run'' (June 23), ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' (June 30), ''Pokemon the Movie 2000'' (July 21), ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' (July 26) -- and some of the more adventurous parents will want to add ''X-Men'' (July 14) -- are all big-budget, big-big-concept entertainment. A ''family'' film these days is not only 90 minutes in a theater, it's a design universe and a lifestyle. It trails in its wake not only the highly visible logos endlessly appliqued, stickered or hologrammed onto junk-food wrappers, mugs, T-shirts, pajamas, CD-ROM's, books, Game Boy cartridges, soundtracks, trading cards, Web sites and heaven knows what else, but also a language, an attitude, an ambience and a technological ideology.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
