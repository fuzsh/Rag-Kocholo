        "text": "In my most recent \"day job,\" I was the sports and features editor for a weekly New Jersey newspaper, where I hosted another blog. Busy, busy, busy.\n\nI did a profile piece on the award-winning cartoonist Arnold Roth and he was nice enough to \"immortalize\" me.\n\nUpdated 5/2/24\n\nThe New York Game: Baseball and the Rise of a New City, by Kevin Baker (via Bookreporter.com)\n\nThe Body Count, by Lincoln Michel\n\nCalico Joe, by Robert Grisham\n\nWhy We Love Baseball: A History in 50 Moments, by Joe Posnanski (via Bookreporter.com)\n\nThe Last Miracle: My 18-Year Journey with the Amazin’ New York Mets, by Ed Kranepool with Gary Kaschak\n\nMost recent books read updated 6/26/24:\n\nSometimes You See It Coming, by Kevin Baker\n\nGrade: B. I first read this one when it originally came out some 30 years ago. I must say I don't remember it being so raunchy in spots. Draws on lots of real-life events and characters that real fans will recognize.\n\nThe Last of His Kind: Clayton Kershaw and the Burden of Greatness, by Andy McCullough\n\nGrade: A. I usually don't like titles with superlatives, but in this case the author might be right, although there are probably a couple of Kershaw's contemporaries (Verlander and Scherzer) who fit that description.\n\nThe Yankee Way: The Untold Inside Story of the Brian Cashman Era, by Andy Martino\n\nGrade: B+. Even this non-Yankee fan found the deep background with its Moneyball-like machinations interesting\n\nThe New York Game: Baseball and the Rise of a New City, by Kevin Baker\n\nGrade: A. Well-researched, well-written. What else could you ask for? Baker has a lot of street cred writing about New York as well, both in fiction and non-fiction.\n\nThe Body Scout, by Lincoln Michel\n\nGrade: C. Perhaps the ultimate performance enhancers -- interchangeable body parts -- help major leaguers of the future. But, as with all of these things, there's a price to pay.\n\nCardboard Gods: An All-American Tale Told Through Baseball Cards, by Josh Wilker\n\nGrade: A. Re-read in preparation for a Bookshelf Conversation with the author. Had a deeper meaning than when I first read it more than a decade ago."
