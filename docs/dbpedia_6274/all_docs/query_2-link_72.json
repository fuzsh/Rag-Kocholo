If so, what would you be looking for?\n\nCVS/Pharmacy (a US drugstore chain) sold a bunch of Rocky and Bullwinkle beanbag dolls in the early 2000s (partially to tie into the 2000 R&B movie, but other Ward characters were made, too). I still have my Boris doll (oddly with red eyes, a la the first few episodes he appeared in) and Bullwinkle one (holding a Wossamotta U banner) on my bookshelf (next to Wakko Warner)\n\n-B.\n\nToonFanForever said:\n\nI have all 12 of the CVS dolls (Rocky, Bullwinkle, Boris, Natasha, Fearless\n\nLeader, Peabody, Sherman, Fractured Fairy, Dudley Do-Right, Horse, Nell\n\nFenwick, and Snidely Whiplash). They were produced in three different sizes,\n\nand I have at least one of each size. As you said, there hasn't been much\n\nnew Jay Ward merchandise lately though.\n\nI have the set of 12 CVS Rocky & Bullwinkle dolls too. Sadly, they must not have sold very well. I bought them all as they came out that summer (the year the live action movie came out), but I still remember that by summer's end the local CVS still had BOXES of R&B beanies leftover and was clearing them out for 0.50 each!\n\nEven the Universal theme park, Islands of Adventures in Orlando, FL doesn't sell much Ward merchandise anymore. They are the home of an amazing Dudley Do-Right themed log flume ride and used to have an all-Ward \"Wottasamotta U\" gift shop... which has since just turned into a generic sports-themed gift shop when I visisted a few months ago.\n\nThere is always Electric Tiki's nice looking R&B mini-maquette to look forward to next year: http://www.electrictiki.com/classic toons/bullwinkle.html\n\nThis might be a factor (and I'm speaking as a \"baby-boomer\" here), but it\n\nseems to me that the attention spans of kids today are much shorter than\n\nours were, back in the 1960s when the Jay Ward cartoons first aired. One of\n\nthe R & B adventures (the first, \"Jet Fuel Formula\") ran for 40 episodes! Back\n\nthen, there were also many more serialized comic strips in the daily newspapers. Probably for the same reason. Much has been said about the\n\nfact that the shows were too dated or too topical or that some of the jokes\n\nwent over kids' heads. But kids are much sharper today (from watching so\n\nmuch television) and I think they would find the shows to still be funny if\n\nsomeone would air them again and the kids would just give them a chance.\n\nToonFanForever said:\n\nThis might be a factor (and I'm speaking as a \"baby-boomer\" here), but it seems to me that the attention spans of kids today are much shorter than ours were\n\nIt looks like the problem with Gen-Y isn't so much a short attention span, but rather an expectation of instant gratification. Everything has to be NOW, so the idea of watching a story arc that lasts several days is beyond their comprehension.\n\nIt's like the story that ran on the AP this week that said that email has lost its favor among today's youth. It seems too slow, and they prefer text messaging on their phones and instant messaging on their computers. The article quoted a doctoral candidate who said about email \"It used to be just fun. Now it's about parents and authority.\" GMAB.\n\nBHK said:\n\nIt looks like the problem with Gen-Y isn't so much a short attention span, but rather an expectation of instant gratification. Everything has to be NOW, so the idea of watching a story arc that lasts several days is beyond their comprehension.\n\nBut now that you can get all those episodes on a DVD set, you don't have to take days to watch them.\n\nJudging from all the ugliness in the world as it seems doomsday is just around the corner, why shouldn't we desire instant gratification? That might be our only chance."
