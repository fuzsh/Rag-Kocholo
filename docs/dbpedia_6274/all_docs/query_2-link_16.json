        "text": "I recently rented the Boris and Natasha movie, first time I saw it since 1997. And after all these years, I still think it's better than the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie, though now I feel it could have been better.\n\nWhile it is often funny, at times it feels more like a Lifetime original movie (and I don't watch Lifetime) or a crime drama (I don't watch those, either). Interestingly, it was originally broadcast on Showtime but was intended as a theatrical release, and at the beginning the narrarator references looking at tickets for the film, but the quality looks more video than film to me.\n\nI'll say that one of the best things about the movie is the narrarator. Pretty much all of his dialogue is funny. I sort of want to say over-the-top as well. And the narrarator is voiced by Cory Burton, who replaced Bill Scott on Gummi Bears. I wonder if he was hired because he'd replaced Bill Scott on a cartoon, though Scott wasn't the narrarator on the original series.\n\nOne of my biggest problems with the movie is the fact that the actors playing Boris and Natasha don't have the right hair. Boris has a full head of hair here, while Natasha's is too short. And in the movie Natasha becomes a famous model and they especially mention her hair being one of her signatures (and they also say it was inspired by a Pottsylvanian hero as they show a photo of Moe Howard).\n\nMy next sentence or two will reveal \"spoilers\", though it seems the movie is hard to find and I'm not sure how many of you actually have a bif desire to see this movie. At the end there are many plot twists as almost every supporting character reveals themselves to be after the microchip Boris and Natasha were after, for different reasons, but for the most part they are pretty much bad guys. Boris and Natasha's neighbors reveal themselves to be \"Agents Moose and Squirrell\", obviously implying Bullwinkle and Rocky, but they also say they cosmetically altered their appearance \"once again\", but this movie would be the first time they were known to have altered their appearance like that. It seems they would have been the only true \"good guys\" in this case, though when Natasha finds out, Rocky/\"Tish\", whom Natasha had developed a little friendship with earlier, seems to genuinely apologize to Natasha over the revelation.\n\nAlso, I have read that the producers apparently couldn't secure the rights to have Rocky and Bullwinkle actually appear, in their usual form. I wonder why, since they could get the rights to make a movie based around Boris and Natasha. I wonder if that's why they hired actors with the wrong length of hair, but then again, the original animated versions of them appear in the title card. I didn't see any character copyright notices in the end credits (I also didn't see any character copyright credits in the first three Muppet movies or Follow That Bird).\n\nWhile Dave Thomas and Sally Kellerman seem to play the characters well, at times they seem to play them as too real. I guess I sort of have that problem with many live-action adaptations of cartoons, certain characters seem to develop more than the original cartoons allowed. I also feel it's strange that Sally Kellerman got top billing, when Boris' name comes first in the title and duo billing. Kellerman was an executive producer in the film, so maybe that's why, or maybe she was a bigger name drawl than Dave Thomas at the time (though I hardly know anything else she was in, besides M*A*S*H and Follow That Bird).\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I'd give Boris and Natasha a 3 and a half.\n\nI recently rented the Boris and Natasha movie, first time I saw it since 1997.

Nothing too special.)\n\nAlso, just out of curiosity, were Boris and Natasha ever really considered a couple? I kinda always kinda thought they were a couple (Didn't they almost kiss in \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" movie?)\n\nI don't know if it was ever stated that Boris and Natasha were a couple on the show, but it seems implied. They constantly call each other \"darlink\" or \"honey\" or terms that I would only expect a couple (or people wanting to hit on, in which case it'd be odd if they were constantly hitting on each other but never became a couple) to call each other.\n\nI thought I might have mentioned it in an earlier post about the \"Boris and Natasha\" movie, but I didn't see it in my big post, but in that movie they become a couple. At first they appear to be just friends/co-workers, but after they go to America Natasha seems to admire American life. They live together but sleep in different beds (though I guess not all couples who live together have to sleep together). Since the two live together their neighbors think they are a couple, and after Natasha denies it her neighbor still feels otherwise, putting the idea of them being a couple into her head, and also talking about some of the perks of being a couple in America over Pottsylvania (such as the fact that both the man and woman generally get treated equally in their relationship). Eventually Boris seems to appreciate her more, and (SPOILER ALERT!) at the end when Boris introduces them to somebody, he makes a point to introduce Natasha as his girlfriend."
