        "text": "(ABC, NBC, November 19, 1959-June 27, 1964)\n\nJay Ward Productions, Gamma Productions, Producers Associates of Television, Inc.\n\nBill Scott – Bullwinkle, Dudley Do-Right, Fearless Leader, Mr. Peabody, Gidney, Mr. Big\n\nJune Foray – Rocky, Natasha Fatale, Nell Fenwick, various\n\nPaul Frees – Boris Badenov, Captain Peter “Wrongway” Peachfuzz, Cloyd, Inspector Fenwick, Dudley Do-Right narrator, various\n\nWalter Tetley – Sherman\n\nDaws Butler – Aesop Jr., various\n\nCharlie Ruggles – Aesop\n\nHans Conried – Snidely Whiplash\n\nWilliam Conrad – Narrator for Rocky and Bullwinkle and Dudley-Do Right\n\nCrusader Rabbit and his sidekick, Ragland T. Tiger.\n\nNBC, who had been financing the series, stopped ordering new episodes. Ward and NBC-appointed producer Jerry Fairbanks felt NBC wasn’t adequately promoting the series to its full potential since it wasn’t a network show. They decided to promote the show themselves and split the profits equally, leading to Fairbanks attempting to buy back all of his projects from the network. However, Fairbanks ended up in financial trouble and defaulted on his agreement with the network. NBC in turn auctioned all of his films off, including Crusader. Anderson and Ward attempted a lawsuit against NBC and Fairbanks in order to get the money Fairbanks had promised them, however they ultimately lost their case. Crusader wound up in the hands of wealthy businessman Shull Bonsall in 1954, TAP was dissolved, and Anderson and Ward took up jobs in advertising and real estate, respectively.\n\nWard’s old friend Leonard Key convinced him to get back into the business in 1956 as animation was growing more favorable on television. Ward and Key attempted to get a colorized revival of Crusader going, believing he and Anderson owned the rights to the character if not the original films, but those plans were dashed by Bonsall’s own intention to revive Crusader in color; which he did in 1959.Unable to afford a legal battle, Anderson and Ward ended up selling the rights to the character and TAP to Bonsall with the provision that they kept the rights to any of the other properties they had or were developing.\n\nThe characters of The Frostbite Falls Revue: Rocky, Oski, Bullwinkle, Sylvester, Blackstone and Floral.\n\nThe revised cast (from top left): Snidley Whiplash, Rocky, Bullwinkle, Mr. Peabody, Sherman, Horse, Nell, Dudley Do-Right, Boris Badenov, Natasha Fatale and Fractured Fairy Tales fairy.\n\nThe town of Frostbite Falls.\n\nTeaching the future spies of Pottsylvania their craft.\n\nRocky and His Friends ad.\n\nFearless Leader REALLY doesn't like failure.\n\nBullwinkle and Rocky with Captain Peachfuzz.\n\nTwo Rocky and Bullwinkle segments were included in each episode. They were joined by a rotating roster of several other segments to comprise the entire half hour, each with their own opening titles:\n\nThe WABAC Machine.\n\nDudley reporting to Inspector Fenwick.\n\nRocky, Bullwinkle and Fearless Leader Funko Pops.\n\nSega Genesis game box.\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle with Natasha, Boris and Fealress Leader in the \"real world\".\n\nBullwinkle was almost a football star.\n\nComing soon."
