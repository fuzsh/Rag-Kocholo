        "text": "The Short-lived marriage\n\nOn 1189, Richard I, King of England would be crowned as the King of England and the Duke of Aquitaine for his mother, Eleanor, Richard I would marry Berengaria soon to have heirs of his own, despite the fact that he is betrothed to the sister of the King of France, however, Richard would decide to send Alice back to the King of France which would cause complications between the two monarchs and caused skirmishes so she was not sent back and instead is married to Richard I’s brother, John who was confirmed as the lord of Ireland and he would feel uncomfortable of John around in England due to him being proven to be an ally of his father against him so he would send him to Ireland in order to found his own kingdom.\n\nPhilippe II and Richard I would meet on Rouen to finalize their treaty of peace regarding the marriage of Alice of France and John I which would finalize the fact that Richard is not interested in marrying Alice of France, however, Philippe II would send a letter to Alice to marry John instead of being sent back to France and Richard would be later upset when he learned of the manipulations of Philippe.\n\nRichard would feel very angry towards his brother, John but he would decide to forgive both Alice and John for marrying without his own permission so was Eleanor of Aquitaine who is also furious of John who is described as sly as a fox, that is why the King of Ireland, John would gain the nickname, John the Fox of Ireland.\n\nThe marriage between John and Alice was said to be done by the Swift actions of Philippe II of France and John was the one who would benefit from those actions and the ultimate victor from that was Philippe II of France who would gain an ally through John, Lord of Ireland, however, Richard would built in alliances in the continent to offset that.\n\nRichard would act fast and marry his niece, Matilda Richeza of Saxony to Imre of Hungary in proxy during that time which would bring wonders to Richard and create a genealogical link between the Kings of England and Hungary and she would arrive shortly after the proxy marriage.\n\nBerengaria would arrive on the beginning of 1190, she would be described as a beauty by the monarchs and was crowned as Queen, she immediately announced her pregnancy and Richard I of England would be very happy with his wife Berengaria, however, she would give birth to a son she would name Henry and she would shortly die of Puerperal fever and Richard I would quickly remarry to another woman, Yolande of Hainault, Yolande of Hainault would quickly become pregnant and gave birth to a son named William, however, Richard I would leave for the crusade in the latter part of 1191 before he would be able to know that Yolande was pregnant of his son, however he would receive a letter about it on his arrival on the crusade, however, he would be suspicious of his son with Yolande’s paternity until he actually met him on 1194 when he returned.\n\nYolande of Hainault is a woman suggested to him by his sister, Marie of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nMathew of Paris would describe Queen Berengaria as a fair beauty, but she would be described by him as the most beautiful queen of England since Queen Godiva.\n\nThe Assasination of Conrad of Montferrat\n\nOn 1192, on the arrival of Richard the Lionheart, Henry II of Champagne would obviously is the mastermind of the death of Conrad of Montferrat after the Hassashin would tell who was the mastermind of the death of Conrad of Montferrat and it is Henry II, but the marriage would move forward as Isabella was fond of her first marriage and not the marriage with Conrad of Montferrat despite the fact she has a daughter with Conrad of Montferrat, Henry II would be hated by the other people of Jerusalem for getting away with the death of Conrad of Montferrat.\n\nMany people would hate the match between Henry II of Champagne who was called the murderer of the King of Jerusalem, Conrad.\n\nBoth the Champagnes and the Plantagenets would both hate the Capetians for Isabella of Hainault’s marriage with Philippe II due to the house of Champagne being robbed of the match of Isabella of Hainault with Henry II of Champagne, however, Marie of Champagne the younger’s marriage with the heir to Hainault will solve it so was the marriage of Richard with Yolande of Hainault\n\nRichard would be one of the people that supported Henry II of Champagne’s bid as the ruler of that crusader state, Yolande of Hainault’s letter to Richard about the birth of his son would be received by Richard in Jerusalem and Henry II of Champagne would tell Richard to see his son, William first before he will judge his wife, Yolande as his mother was right to suggest her as his wife after his first one died.\n\nHenry II of Champagne and Isabella of Jerusalem would get a staunch and strong supporter in Richard the Lionheart until 1194, when he would leave the holy land which would leave Henry II’s position in the Holy Land much more weaker in 1194 due to Henry II of Champagne being known as a regicide king who killed his predecessor, Henry II of Champagne would have three daughters, namely Marguerite(1193), Alice(1194) and Philippa(1196) until he was assassinated by the supporters of Conrad afterwhich she would marry Amalric of Lusignan.\n\nDuring that time, both John, the brother of Richard I and his wife, Alice of France would plot against Richard with Philippe Auguste which would be the issue of worry for Richard I of England and he would hear of the threat of John on 1194, which would make him return to England sooner.\n\nThe Aragonese match\n\nRichard I would arrive on France on late 1194 where he would meet his second wife, Yolande again and she would explain her side and present their son, William to him, their encounter would result in them sleeping together and Yolande of Flanders being pregnant and give birth to a daughter named Mathilde on 1195.\n\nOn 1194, instead of deciding to return to England, he would decide to marry his own niece Berengaria to Peter II of Aragon which would deny the betrothal of Conrad of Swabia with Berengaria and the later possible match with Alfonso IX of Leon.\n\nEarlier on 1189, Constance of Hauteville, the aunt of the former king of Sicily would have a son named Frederick of Sicily which would cause her to die due to puerperal fever. Joan of England would remarry to Henry VI of Holy Roman Empire on 1191 and she would assist Henry VI to claim the throne of Sicily for his own son and Joan of England would later give birth to son named Henry of Swabia(1193) and a daughter named Beatrice of Swabia(1196).\n\nHenry VI would hear that his brother’s match with Berengaria has already been broken for her to marry Peter II of Aragon, however, Joan would guarantee the easy dissolution of the sponsalia or betrothal of Berengaria of Castile with Conrad of Swabia but the death of Conrad of Swabia on 1195 would solve the issue of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nPeter II would be captivated by the beauty of Princess Berengaria of Castile, who is also an English princess that he would fall in love with the young Castilian Princess who was just 14 years old when he married her."
