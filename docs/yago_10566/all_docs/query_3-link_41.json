        "text": "From the beginning of her childbearing years, Petronila had several children. At the age of 16, during the birth of the first of her children, Pedro (who died in infancy), she had to make a will in childbirth. This gives us an idea of how precarious the question of succession, the preservation of the family name and the patrimony of the House of Aragon was. The eldest of those who survived infancy would be Alfonso II of Aragon. Widowed at the age of 26, Petronila did not want to take a husband again and was the mistress of her own actions. A determined woman, in 1164 she renounced the kingdom and gave it to her son. It was then that the Crown of Aragon was born, which, although it had been cemented by her marriage, now took on its charter.\n\nThere are still many gaps around the figure of Petronila. We know about her legacy and the circumstances surrounding her life, certain public acts… much more than about her real life. We know about her children, who after Alfonso would occupy various responsibilities and honours (Pedro, Count of Provence; Dulce, Queen Consort of Portugal; Sancho, Count of Roussillon, Provence and Cerdagne). We know of his death and burial in Barcelona Cathedral in the autumn of 1173, but there are still enigmas surrounding his tomb, which is not really located, and about which there are various hypotheses."
