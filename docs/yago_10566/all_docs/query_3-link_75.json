        "text": "Crusading was the most effective method of integrating the Iberian Peninsula within Christendom. This fact is most evident when we consider the reign of Alfonso VIII of Castile. This monarch married the daughter of the king of England, arranged the marriage of his eldest daughter with the heir of the German Emperor and married another of his daughters with the future king of France. These actions convey the need for maximum integration which can be traced using several indicators –political, ideological, cultural...– that moreover reinforce the propaganda image of a king at the service and in defence of Christianity.\n\nThis paper examines the prevalence of armsbearing bishops in the Kingdom of Castile during the reign of Alfonso VIII (r.1158-1214). In doing so, it suggests that recent work done by scholars whose research focuses on more traditional medieval centers (i.e. England, France, and the Empire) needs to contextualized within a much broader survey of the phenomenon. To achieve that goal of contextualization, this paper examines the evidence of armsbearing bishops in the frontier kingdom of Castile, and demonstrates the ways in which the frameworks established by some scholars need to be adjusted to fit the larger medieval reality experienced across all of Latin Christendom."
