        "text": "So, finally, this TL will see the light of the day...\n\nI would like to give special thanks to @Karolus Rex and @General Ripper\n\nLong story short it is a TL about a union between Portugal and Leon, there are multiple PODs the first is the birth of a son to João Anes de Lima, the second is the marriage of this character to Sancha Heiress of Leon if you want to know more about the PODs and the objective of the TL read this thread please: https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/hispania-iberia-united-by-portugal.398811/\n\nI was working in the shadows for months in this TL, so I hope you enjoy.​\n\n​\n\nChapter I - Afonso IX, last king of Leon\n\nFirst years of life and coronation\n\nAlfonso IX, born in 1171, son of Fernando II of León and Urraca of Portugal, reigned between the years 1188 and 1230, the year of his death. Alfonso was born of a marriage between cousins, common event in the Iberian monarchies of that time. For that reason, its position as successor of the king became uncertain after the marriage between its parents became null.\n\nAs soon as his father died his stepmother tried to put his own son on the throne, under the argument that her son was the deceased king's eldest legitimate son. Nevertheless, Urraca Lopes de Haro, widow of the king did not succeed in convincing the majority of the nobles and of the clergy and had the pretension of its son rejected by the royal curia. Urraca failed to unite the nobility in favor of his son, even her own family, the Haro, wasn't enthusiastic about the possibility of a child-king, in contrast, three important families stood out in defense of the rights of Infante Alfonso, the families Lara, Trava, and Lima.\n\nWeddings: seeds of the crisis\n\nAlfonso did not take long to fulfill his real obligations to generate an heir. Soon he married and during his lifetime he was married twice, but his lack of care in choosing his wives, although taking into account short-term diplomatic goals, led the peninsula to a crisis of succession that was the biggest one of Spain in that century.\n\nIn 1191 Alfonso married his first wife, Teresa, daughter of the king of Portugal, Sancho I, who was also his cousin. This marriage was considered null in 1194 and generated three children, Sancha, Fernando, and Dulce. Sancha and Fernando remained in Leon, but Dulce was taken to Portugal with his mother. Many years later Sancha married Rodrigo Anes de Lima in 1211.\n\nIn 1194 Alfonso married again with another cousin, Berengaria of Castille, this marriage generated two sons and two daughters and was also annulled.\n\nWith the annulment of the second marriage of Alfonso, a crisis seemed to have been avoided, since now Berengaria could not discredit the legitimacy of the first-born of Alfonso without discrediting its own son.\n\nIn 1206 the king made a clear definition that Fernando would be its successor and in the case of its death, the masculine children of Berengaria would inherit, later the women daughters of Teresa and finally the women of Berengaria.\n\nDiplomacy\n\nIn 1194 the Cardinal and Papal Legate, Gregory, was sent to Spain to arbitrate the differences between the Christian kingdoms. In the same year, the agreement of Tordehumos was reached, with such agreement several castles in litigation are exchanged and the borders were defined again.\n\nDespite the agreement Alfonso always maintained distrusts against Castile, seeking to secure its border with Portugal and the friendship of Navarre and Aragon. The Almohad power also always kept Alfonso from trying to expand southwards, on the contrary, he sought help from the Muslims to attack Castile and Portugal, when those kingdoms entered into an alliance around the turn of the century. In these wars all kingdoms had losses, but Leon had the greatest, losing not only men and wealth but the support of the other kingdoms and extensive strips of territory.\n\nThis situation changed in 1212 when it happened the battle of Navas de Tolosa. This battle that definitively destroyed Muslim cohesion did not have a Leonese participation, but it profoundly affected Leon's diplomacy, which began to seek expansion southwards, mainly to reach the city of Seville and to conquer as much of Andalusia as possible before the neighboring kingdoms. The king then spent almost the whole of its last two decades of his life devoted to the reconquest, expanding the territory to the south of Leon.\n\nDeaths and successions\n\nIn the year 1211 the heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Castile, Ferdinand, died at the age of 22 passing away with no offspring. The new heir was Henry, the second son of Alfonso VIII of Castile. In turn, in 1214 the king of Castile also died leaving his son, Henry I, a boy of only ten years of age as sovereign. The former wife of the king of Leon, Berengaria, was then made his protector.\n\nOn that same year in the kingdom of Leon, the heir of Alfonso IX died, Ferdinando was the heir of Leon and son of the king with his first wife, he was only 22 years old. With his death, the throne of Leon happened to be now part of the inheritance of the children of Berengaria and Alfonso because next in the line of succession was another Ferdinando, half-brother of the recently deceased infante.\n\nIn 1215 Dulce, daughter of the king of Leon was engaged to Henry I of Castile. The engagement was supposed to become a marriage between 1219 and 1221.\n\nHenry was a young king and so was not fit to rule, at age 13 in 1217 he was still interested in playing games and living his life of young teen until in a summer day he played with other children a little game of polka dots in the shade of a house when a tile slipped and hit the top of his head, causing a sinking of the skull. His death remained a secret for some time and was only revealed after the coronation of Berengaria.\n\nThe fact that the king was under the protection of Berengaria in Palencia and that she was his successor led to the beginning of a small scandal when the death was revealed, but the supporters of the new queen soon drowned out these rumors.\n\nImmediately after knowing about the death, Alfonso IX declared that he was Henry's heir, as the closest living relative of the late king by male line. However, it was too late, and indeed his eldest son had left Leon in the days before at the request of Berengaria, with the consent of Alfonso, not knowing yet that Ferdinand would be crowned king of Castile.\n\nAlfonso felt betrayed and ordered his son to return, his son and the mother of his son sent to him a message saying that the king of Leon could not give orders to the king of Castile. Alfonso immediately went on to coordinate a conspiracy with the noble Castilian Alvaro Nunez de Lara, but his conspiracy was discovered and Lara was executed for treason. By that moment, Alfonso and Ferdinando started to exchange increasingly harsh correspondences.\n\nAccording to the chronicles of the kingdom of Leon, Alfonso wanted to wage war against the kingdom of Castile, but it was the contrary advice of João Fernandes de Lima and the appeals of his daughter Sancha and the Archbishop of Santiago that prevented Alfonso from summoning his army against Castile.\n\nPolitical strategy of Alfonso IX, the “Party of Sancha”\n\nAfter the betrayal of his children, Alfonso decided to block the succession of his surviving sons and made Sancha his successor. In 1218 the king, together with his main advisors and friends, created a strategy to secure the power of Sancha's supporters.\n\nThe main piece in this political game was Joao Fernandes de Lima, chosen to be the Mordomo (Steward of the Kingdom) between 1220 and 1224, “Alferez” of the Kingdom between 1224 and 1228 and again Mordomo in 1228. In this position of power, Joao could distribute tenancies to the allies of Lima, like Rodrigo Fernandez, Alferez of the king after 1228, Diego Froilaz, son of the count Froilaz Ramirez and stepfather of some illegitimate children of Alfonso IX, and several nobles of the families that usually supported Alfonso, mainly the Trava, the Lara and obviously the Lima . Besides the nobles, Alfonso had the support of Bernardo II, archbishop of Santiago and by consequence of the greater part of the Leonese clergy.\n\nIn addition to creating and cementing the power of what was known as the Sanchist Party, the partisans of the infanta sought the support of the other kingdoms, seeking to isolate the kingdom of Castile diplomatically. Many Leonese nobles had family and political relations with Portugal and this was the first kingdom courted by Alfonso and Joao. In the year 1219, an alliance with Portugal was reached, as well as a marriage agreement between Alfonso's granddaughter and the son of Alfonso II of Portugal, not Sancho, heir to the throne, but his brother Afonso. The following year Alfonso was able to marry his second daughter, Dulce, with the heir to the throne of Navarre, Pedro, future Pedro II. With this movement, Alfonso diplomatically advanced the siege of Castile. In 1228 Sancha was quick to negotiate with Louis VIII of France a marriage for her son Tiago (translated as James), heir to the throne of Leon, with Isabel of France, born only three years before, the marriage was to be consummated after 1238.\n\nThe king's machinations were ended in 1230 unexpectedly, he wished to leave Sancha in a good position to make a peaceful transition, but his early death without the full consolidation of the sanchist power and the sheer Leonese bad luck of Ferdinando being already mobilized for war at that time were the main reasons for the start of the Leonese War of Succession.\n\nMap of Spain at the death of Alfonso IX​\n\nNotes:\n\n1 - North Extremadura: Region between the Sierra Central and Tagus River\n\n2 - South Extremadura: almost entirely conquered in the reign of Alfonso IX from 1210 to 1230.\n\nChapter 2: The Leonese Succession War\n\nThe last glory of Alfonso\n\nThe region in Léon that lies south of Sierra Central is called Extremadura. For decades that region remained almost uninhabited as a no man's land of the christian kingdoms to the north and Taifas to the south. After the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa Alfonso IX changed his attitude towards his muslim neighbors, before that event he tried to maintain a cordial relationship with the muslims, but when the Almohads collapsed into several states it became not only profitable but almost mandatory to invest his military resources against the south. His problem initially was that to campaign against the south the king of León needed to start in an unfavorable position since the years of leonese passivity in that front led to castilian advances that almost blocked any chance of expansion. This situation was very apparent when looking to the fortress city of Plasencia, as anyone could see just looking to a map, that city was the main castilian tool to control the main valley that linked north and south of the mountain range.\n\nDespite this setback, Alfonso was successful nonetheless and succeeded in making many gains between 1210 and 1229, taking Alcantara, Trujillo, Medelin and Badajoz, thus cutting Caceres alone almost as an exclave in León. So after the isolation of the city, Caceres surrendered without a fight in the year 1230. In that same year the king planned more advances against the south, among them the first would be an attack against Zafra, but by misfortune, the king ended up dying in Galicia when he was making a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela on September 24, 1230.\n\nInformation Game\n\nIn the year 1230 Ferdinando, King of Castile, was campaigning against the Taifa of Jaén and already controlled important places like Baeza, Ubeda and Linares when he decided to surround the capital of that taifa. For months he stayed with his army seeing the hopeless town dying without help, he could have taken the city if he could wait just a little longer, but that was the year of his father's death.\n\nWith the death of Alfonso IX and a lack of a male heir the biggest share of power in Leon was in the hands João Fernandez de Lima, Mordomo of León and father-in-law of the infanta and heiress Sancha of Leon. Still on the same day of the death, João met the closer advisers of King Alfonso and informed everyone about the ill news, they met to argue over what to do as a follow-up to protect the rights of Sancha and it as a consensus that the death of Alfonso occurred at a very bad time. Ferdinando was in a good position to attack León in case he decided not to accept Sancha's coronation, he was leading at least four thousand men in Jaén, probably more, and the kingdom of Leon would take weeks to gather a force of equal size, weeks that Castela would use to continue their mobilization and reinforce their army, the councilors also knew that Castile possessed much more knights and population than Leon, that scenario meant that time was an enemy, not an ally.\n\nThe council reached an agreement about what to do, the consensus was that the first thing to do was to ensure that the death of the king should not be discovered, as did Berengaria with her brother's death many years prior, then João should call the allies of León for a defense of Sancha and finally León should summon troops to war in case there was need to defend the kingdom. Rodrigo, that was Sancha's husband and now was supposed to be king consort, was the one that gave the idea of calling first the most loyal sanchists and hide the mobilization under the disguise of an expedition against Seville.\n\nSecret Revealed\n\nFor some few days the leonese were able to keep the secret of Alfonso's death, but rumors spread in the fourth day, rumors that reached the ears of Ferdinando's informants. On the ninth day after the death of his father Ferdinand received in Jaén reports about those rumors and twelve days after it had happened he received the confirmation, meanwhile Sancha was crowned queen of Leon in the eleventh day after Alfonso’s death. Outraged and still unaware that Sancha was now the crowned Queen of Leon, Ferdinand lifted the siege to Jaen and left the members of the military orders guarding the conquered places while the rest of the army returned to Castile in order to receive reinforcements and invade the kingdom of Leon. Around this time Ferdinando rode to Ciudad Real with the vanguard of his forces to meet his mother in order to receive her advice, there he learned about the coronation of Sancha and about the movements and events that where happening in the neighboring kingdom.\n\nChaos\n\nAs soon as the news about the coronation arrived in each place it created an atmosphere of tension, fear, anger and joy everywhere, some villages exploded in revolts, many others in celebration for the new queen and a very large number of places exploded in street fights. It was common to see supporters of Sancha and Ferdinando beating the opposition and committing murders against the other party, even more common was the kidnapping of political enemies. In several places nobles and tenants were killed or arrested as the members of both parties revealed themselves.\n\nSo little by little the hidden chess pieces that fernandists and sanchists played were revealed, twenty years of plans and intrigues that would culminate in the chaos of the War of Leonese Succession.\n\nExpecting an invasion and caught in the middle of the anarchy the population of the country could only hope for the best, but the situation was dark and would become even darker in the next days.\n\nMap of Spain in September of 1230 showing the conquests of Ferdinando as part of Castile​\n\nPart 2 - The War of \"Clavas e Adagas\"\n\nOn October 5, Sancha was crowned queen in the city of Leon, the ancestral seat of the Leonese monarchy, next to her Rodrigo Anes de Lima was crowned as her king consort. Immediately Rodrigo Anes became the military chief of the kingdom, above his father, João and the alferez of the kingdom Rodrigo Fernandez. As the crowning took place, a Leonese force was already gathering around the city of Leon at that time, still under the disguise of an operation against Seville. Although this meeting point was very poorly located for an attack against Seville, because attacks to the south would have as a meeting point some place at least south of Salamanca and most probably in Extremadura.\n\nWhen news of Ferdinando's movements came to the attention of the Leonese the situation of war was obvious, so Joao Anes ordered that the royal family to be taken to Galicia where they should remain during the conflict, only the king consort should remain in places of danger as he should lead the Leonese army. The kingdom of León was in a precarious situation on these days, less than a thousand men had gathered at the rendezvous point and Castile would quickly gather 5,000 men in Plasencia for the invasion.\n\nThe period of time between October 5 and October 27 is known as guerra de clavas e adagas (the clubs and daggers war), this name was adopted mostly because of being characterized by street fights (clubs) and murders (daggers). Major social upheavals happened in that period that preceded the fighting between regular armies. On October 8th, the first great revolt occurred, the city of Tordesillas, which concentrated large numbers of Castilians rebelled against the new queen and expelled its tenant, killing several sanchists who could not escape the onslaught. The next day the cities of Palencia and Medina Del Campo also rebelled and became Castilian fortresses. On the 11th the Ferdinandists attempted a rebellion in Zamora, but the goodwill towards Castile was scarce in that city, with most of Ferdinando's sympathizers being agitators from neighboring regions. Still, hundreds of Fernandists faced against the lieutenant of the city, his men and much popular who took the cause of Sancha for themselves, the battle of Zamora as the brawl became known led to the death of at least a hundred people and the defeat of the supporters of the king of Castile. In the days that followed, rebellions happened throughout the Extremadura, there most of the cities fell under Castilian dominion. The last major rebellion was that of Salamanca, which took place on 25 October and resulted in the massacre of the Fernandist rebels. By the end of the 26th day of October, León had lost control of most of Extremadura and the Eastern part of the kingdom but had retained control of the western and northern regions.\n\nMap of Spain in October 26th, 1230.​\n\nPurple areas are in control of Castile.​\n\nPart 3 - The Castilian Invasion\n\nFerdinand arrived in Ciudad Real on the night of October 14, 1230, he had left Baeza the morning of the previous day with the vanguard of his army in a forced march. When he arrived in Ciudad Real his mother was waiting for him, they argued for hours on how to proceed about the events that took place in Leon. By the delay in the communications Ferdinando did not yet know that Sancha had already been crowned the queen of Leon a few hours prior, but new information arrived every day, so with some delay they were informed of what was happening in the kingdom.\n\nEven without accurate information on what was happening, Ferdinand was convinced that he could take his father's throne if he acted quickly. Berengaria agreed with her son, but nevertheless she proposed to him to seek a negotiated peace with his sister as she feared the weakening of the kingdoms in a fratricidal war. Her son was always receptive to his mother, so he ordered her to send a formal request to Sancha, ordering her to respect the rights of Ferdinando, in change the king would give of compensations to Sancha and her family, but at the same time Ferdinand ordered his Alferez to summon all his vassals to war. He wished a peaceful solution but thought that João and Rodrigo would never give up the crown without a fight.\n\nOn October 27, Ferdinand entered with the Castilian army in Extremadura, 6,000 soldiers, most veterans of the Jaén campaign accompanied him while the kingdom of Leon struggled to gather a third of that number in the environs of Zamora. Nonetheless the hardships of the logistic both armies received every day significant amounts of reinforcements of all parts of their kingdoms, for that reason the armies involved in that war were constantly growing. At the end of October Ferdinando considered that he already had sufficient troops to reach his objectives in Extremadura and for that reason ordered that all the new reinforcements were sent primarily to the region of Valadolid, thus preventing the leonese reconquer of the cities that had rebelled against Sancha.\n\nAfter entering Extremadura Ferdinando wasted no time and marched against the city of Coria, the last great bastion of the sanchists south of the mountains of the Sierra, meanwhile he reinforced his army with leonese fernandist and sent groups to surround all the castles that still were resisting him.\n\nThe campaign against the Extremadura did not last long, every day castles surrendered to the Castilian forces with the city of Coria being the last place to surrender, falling in the morning of November 5th. As soon as Ferdinand defeated all the resistance of Leon in that region he allowed a day of rest and celebration for the Castilian forces, but on the 6th Ferdinando set off again aiming to conquer the rest of the kingdom of his father. Among the decisions taken that day were the sending of 1,000 Castilian and 500 leonese men in a mission that consisted of crossing the mountains and taking the city Rodrigo by the fastest route, with luck the city would surrender without fighting and the mission was considered trivial.\n\nThe king had received information about Portuguese troops somewhere close to the frontier. Ferdinando feared about finding a portuguese or leonese force entrenched somewhere in the passage or ambushing his army. Because of it he took the remainder of his force and went through the mountains by the valley of the river Jerte, under the security of the castilian territory while his alferez Lope Dias de Haro led the small force against Ciudad Rodrigo.\n\nWhen the king arrived in Bejar on the other side of the mountains, about six days after leaving Coria, the castilian forces were divided again. Another 1500 men followed Infante Alfonso of Castille, brother of the king to help in the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, by that day Lope was around the city starting to camp outside the walls.\n\nThus ended the 46th day after the death of Alfonso IX of Leon. The castilian forces were divided into four armies:\n\nTwo armies of fifteen hundred men each facing or heading to Ciudad Rodrigo.\n\nAn army, the biggest of all consisting of seven thousand men under the direct command of the king marching against Salamanca.\n\nAnother castilian army was in the region of Campos (Tordesillas, Medina and Palencia), under the command of the mordomo Gonzalo Rodriguez Giron. This last army, which wasn’t yet described, protected the frontier region between Leon and Castile, fulfilling both its function of defending the castilian homeland and the special function of keeping the leonese army locked to Zamora. Any leonese movement of the army of Zamora, that wasn’t very big at the time anyway, would result in gap in the defense of the lands from Zamora to Astorga and perhaps even the city of Leon itself would be exposed to attacks. The situation seemed very bad to the leonese, but still there was hope as Ferdinando had unknowingly committed a big mistake.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nPlease forgive the Guadalara in the map, that was a keyboard problem... I swear that I knew that it is Guadalajara...\n\nPART 4: THE CHARGE OF THE PORTUGUESE KNIGHTS\n\nArrival and preparation of the Castilians\n\nAfter three days marching the alferez Lope Diaz de Haro arrived at his destination on the morning of November 8th, 1230. Before evening his camps were already established in their positions and the siege had begun. The Ciudad Rodrigo stood in a relatively elevated position beside the river Agueda and just outside the walls was a bridge that gave access to the other margin of the river. In regards to its defensive capabilities the town wasn't very fortified. It had to defend itself nothing more than a wall a little higher than five times the average height of a man, a garrison of less than 300 men and the elevated place where it was located. Outside the walls the Castilian troops were organized in two camps, the largest on the north-east side of the river, and the smallest on the south-west bank near the bridge connecting the two sides of the river. The larger camp housed four times as many men as the smaller.\n\nThe war until that moment had been an uninterrupted sequence of Castilian victories and judging by the disparity of forces in Ciudad Rodrigo and the rest of the Kingdom of Leon other Castilian victories were becoming nearer, yet the garrison of the city remained firm and didn’t surrender on the first sight of the enemy like many places of the Extremadura.\n\nThe Portuguese forces\n\nBefore sending the force of Lope, Ferdinando was informed about portuguese movements in the frontier region, but Ferdinando underestimated the importance of that information as according to the reports received, only a few hundred men were concentrated there. Finally the king of Castile decided that those forces were not important enough. Ferdinando in his mind probably calculated that those forces could only cause harm to him at the passes of the Sierras where his forces would be exposed to surprise attacks, otherwise they would be irrelevant, thus Ferdinando made a serious mistake that would cost him dearly in the near future.\n\nOn the same day that castilians arrived in Ciudad Rodrigo the portuguese were resting near Fuentes de Oroño. That army that was encamped at the border was commanded by Infante Afonso of Portugal, brother of king Sancho and son-in-law of Rodrigo and Sancha. He led a cavalry force composed of 300 riders, among them were many \"cavaleiros-vilãos\", portuguese nobles and their personal retinues too, they could have been considered at the time as part of the \"crème de la crème\" of the portuguese armies, to the west another group of 500 portuguese almogavars were approaching in order to meet with the infante.\n\nThe Charge\n\nOn November 9th, after learning the day before that the castilians were near his position Afonso decided that he had to act on its own. He had only the cavalry with him, he needed at least to try to relieve the pressure on the leonese.\n\nThat same day Afonso packed what he needed and rode the distance (around 25 km - 15.5 miles) that separated him from the Castilians. His journey was so fast that he took the besieger force totally off guard. As its force was devoid of cavalry in good quantity Lope had decided not to use their few mounted troops to do the work of scouts, because of that he was taken by surprise. Lope had always kept his horsemen next to him as a mobile force to counter any attacks from the town. that is probably why even after seeing a large cloud of dust gradually increasing in the west the scouts on foot did not had time to warn their men in the camp about the Portuguese, the men on camp only knew about what was happening after seeing the same cloud.\n\nThe first castilian attitude was to try to retreat crossing the bridge in good order, but a force of no more than fifty defenders quickly left the city to stand menacingly outside the gates. They were armed with javelins and spears and quickly blocked the exit of the bridge, succeeding in intimidating the Castilians who did not tried to fight those men in the narrow passage. At that moment Afonso already galloped by the field, nearer and nearer to the Castilians that had no choice but to form a line of defense to resist the attack even with the defenders of the city on its backs.\n\nAcross the river the main forces of castile were warned about what was happening on the other side and from afar they could observe the movement of allied and enemy troops. Haro decided to employ his own cavalry to aid his men. He galloped south around the city at a safe distance from the walls, but midway he could see the fighting already happening across the river.\n\nWhat he saw was the Portuguese cavalry about to hit the Castilian lines of defense that had been assembled hastily as the group of leonese infantry crossed the bridge to attack the castilians from behind. After seeing the shock of the cavalry on the Castilian line, Haro then heard the sound of spears, hooves, armor and shields hitting each other. As the castilians were almost leaderless and faced a much superior enemy they could not stand even the the first portuguese blow, the castilian men shattered instantly when their formations broke, the battle turned into a chaotic chase when the infantrymen tried escape just to be caught by the portuguese cavalry. The Castilians that survived the first shock surrendered in droves and none of them escaped.\n\nSeeing what happened and realizing that the siege had been already broken Lope decided it was time to withdraw. He probably thought that the Portuguese cavalry force was the vanguard of a much bigger army, a force that could reach his position any moment soon. The Castilian commander knew that there were reinforcements coming under Alfonso, and because of that he thought that there was no sense in risking more men in such disadvantageous position.\n\nOn that day the Kingdom of León obtained their first victory against Castile thanks to the Portuguese Knights. The Castilians lost in the battle at least 300 men while the Portuguese lost only four, the first siege of Ciudad Rodrigo was finished, but the war was not yet won. Alfonso of Castile’s forces would soon unite with Lope's forces and both would return in the next few days with an army of double size trying again to take that city.\n\nFor scale reasons: the river under the bridge is 150m wide (165yd)\n\nPART 4: DUEL OF AFONSOS\n\nParchment containing the song \"Duel of the Afonsos\" and ilustration about the event.​\n\nIt was not long before Lope Diaz de Haro met Alfonso, the next day both forces met and the infante learned about what had happened during the siege, immediately he sent a messenger to Ferdinando to inform him what happened, putting some mean words against Lope in the text too. Both commanders had a tense discussion about how to proceed, Haro believed that the Portuguese force that had attacked him was only the vanguard of the Portuguese army and was suspicious that Portugal had managed to gather the host of the entire nation, he ultimately wanted to ask reinforcements to Ferdinando, Alfonso on the other hand thought that Haro was an idiot.\n\nInfante Alfonso of Castile wished to resume the siege immediately with the men he had, he saw no sign of big Portuguese forces, and credited the defeat entirely on Lope's incompetence. The opinion that prevailed at end was the same one that Alfonso had initially, he took very little in consideration about the advices of Haro.\n\nAfter the defeat in Ciudad Rodrigo the Alferez had a big problem, his reputation was badly hit. Now Haro commanded the smallest part of the castilian siege force, and even worse to him was the fact that the infante had the support of the king who had given him command over Haro. Before giving the command to Alfonso the king included in his orders to Alfonso that he needed to always take In consideration the advices of Haro, but now Alfonso thought that the recent events would relieve him of this part of his orders.\n\nThree days after the battle of Ciudad Rodrigo the new force of 2700 men was again on the outskirts of the city. Just as Afonso the portuguese had done before Alfonso the castilian galloped on the lead of his vanguard. The vanguard of the Castilian army found the Portuguese knights prepared for battle about 5 km (3 miles) off Ciudad Rodrigo, the skirmish that followed wasn’t very bloody, both forces had similar sizes and equal distrust of their own capabilities against the enemy. Both cavalries charged each other beating each other with spears and swords, but mainly fighting at distance using javelins. After less than half an hour the Portuguese retreated, the Castilians did not chase them, with a wise fear of being led into a trap they just let them escape. From Afonso's perpective that movement was a let down as leading the castilians into a trap was exactly what he was trying to do. With the Portuguese plan frustrated, that fight made few casualties to both sides, Castile lost 6 riders and Portugal 9. Although it was not a big deal this skirmish became known as the second battle of Ciudad Rodrigo, and was also called the Duel of the Princes or Battle of the Afonsos, for having counted on the participation of both homonyms.\n\nLater the fight was made into a song. In that song the battle turned into a duel of ten against ten. The princes and a hand of their companions became champions, in this famous song the winner of the individual duel between the Afonsos was the Portuguese one, despite that the Castilian side won the fight as they were able to knock down more champions with many of those secondary matches ending with the death of both challengers.\n\nAfter the battle Afonso reunited his forces in the city and after pondering his options decided to send back most part of the cavalry that accompanied it, remaining himself in the walls only with 200 almogavars and 50 horsemen. He made this decision against the will of his knights as Afonso himself explicitly told in a letter to his brother. Acording to him all the knights wished to remain in the city fearing that this retreat would be seen as a cowardice and dishonor, above all they did not want to abandon the brother of the king as they had sworn before Sancho to protect the infante and obey him. In turn Afonso feared that if he left the town, the people there would be taken by the feeling of abandonment and would end up surrendering their town to the Castilians more easily as had happened to the city of Coria, so it could have happened again. At the same time Afonso feared to end up neutralizing the best Portuguese forces within the city when they could be useful to his brother anywhere else. Thus, before most of the Castilians arrived near the city, the Portuguese forces retreated westwards, crossing the river and disappearing across the horizon as the Portuguese infantry entrenched itself within the walls, a few hours later the Castilian force arrived and again they set up their camps and severed the city's communication with the outside world.\n\nThe next day after these events in Ciudad Rodrigo Ferdinando reached Salamanca and started to siege it. He had confidence that the war was nearing its end. Meanwhile far away, as far as many days of travel, Sancho VI de Navarra definitely entered the war initiating what was known in songs and chronicles as \"The Great Cavalcade of Peter the Strong.\"\n\nPART 5: THE GREAT CAVALCADE OF SANCHO AND PEDRO\n\nFor many years the relation of Navarra and Castile was strained, since the end of the previous century both countries were in a state of rivalry wich found it's lowest in 1200 when Castile took half of the territory of Navarre. The relation between the two kingdoms improved when king Sancho of Navarre fought at the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, but the territory lost wasn’t returned and Sancho never really forgot that. However, even if begrudgingly, Sancho had already accepted that he would leave for his son a smaller kingdom than he had received. He could find solace in the fact that Navarre was in a better economic shape than half a century before, but not that much solace.\n\nSancho VI, “the strong”, of Navarre was already a man of advanced age in 1230, as debilitated as he was by a varicose ulcer in the leg, he closed himself inside its castle in Tudela. Being almost 80 years old he did not expected to fight another war in his life and retired from the government of the kingdom. Those were now responsibilities of his son and heir Pedro (Peter).\n\nWhen the war began, the news about Alfonso's death did not cause any surprise to the old king, he was already old enough to have seen the life and death of many kings and had knew face to face many rulers far more impressive than Alfonso. What was cause of surprise to him were the calls for help made by the kingdom of Leon. He really expected that Sancha would have an easy transition to power. To Sancho the calls from Leon sounded as an opportunity given by God Itself, an opportunity to right the wrongs and mistakes of the past. That request for help gave him \"a last breath, a last chance to fight his last battle\" as described by himself. Sancho resumed partially his functions as king to help Pedro and motivate his people. In that specific scenario motivation was what Navarre needed the most as the news coming from the west basically said that they were allies of the kingdom that was losing the war. The nobility of Navarre hoped to get the lost lands back, but it seemed like a lost cause, every time that Navarre received news it looked worse. In Pamplona the common people used to say that Leon (that means lion in many latin languages) was actually more like a kitten that didn't know how to use claws.\n\nThose thoughts did not made way to Sancho's mind, he could strategically read the news and was one of the best generals of his time. If Leon was being invaded by as many soldiers as it was said by the people then Castile should be leaving their own castles with as few men as possible to garrison them. Considering that it was risky to let the south unprotected the north should have been even more stripped from its normal guard and with so few men to defend the east and north any army that showed up in the fields of Castile would be unmolested at least for a while.\n\nEveryone knew that Navarre was small and could not face the Castilian power in an offensive war, to take castilian castles was unthinkable to Sancho and face the armies of Castile directly would be suicide. However, wars were made of more than battles and sieges and Sancho would use every possible option to cause maximum damage to his enemy and maximum relief to his allies.\n\nOn November 19th Pedro and Sancho started their raid on Castilian territory, leaving Tudela the day before, the king and his son carried destruction to many villages and settlements of the Ebro valley. They made a path that followed the plains of the river Ebro until the mountains of the north, there the king found many basques that cooperated with the raiding parties, as the army of Navarre left untouched the basque villages raiding and pillaging only the castilian settlers.\n\nThe great party of looters was split into several smaller groups to be able to attack more places. Following the river Ebro they passed through Logrono, then through Haro, entered the mountainous regions near Bilbao and went west, so much to the west that they almost crossed to the lands of Leon but without really crossing the frontier they choose to follow another path to southeast. That was a path dangerously close to Burgos, but the party was unmolested all the way.\n\nWhile this expedition was taking place the majordomus of Castile prepared his forces to face Sancho and Pedro. The problem to the castilians was that they could not abandon unguarded the recently gained positions on the frontier of Leon. It took them almost ten days to gather enough men to the rebelled regions guarded while the majodomus of Castile personally chase the raiding party.\n\nRealizing that the castilians were comming to them, the army of Navarre began to retreat, but even then they did not stop wreaking havoc in the parts of Castile that were unable to defend themselves.\n\nPath followed by the army of Navarre​\n\nThe cavalcade lasted 15 days from the day they entered Castile to the day they crossed the frontier to Navarra again. The attack had yielded many spoils of war and captives, but other than that it ignited the rebellious spirit of the basques in Castile, openned a new defensive front in the war, disrupted the planning of Ferdinando and delayed the arrival of reinforcements to the Castilian armies that fought in Leon. The raid was a succes, even if it caused much pain to Sancho and deteriorated his health to the worst condition possible, probably contributing to his death the following year.\n\nNo one knows how much the “great cavalcade of Sancho and Pedro” contributed to the cause of Sancha, but most historians agree that it was a big boost of moral to the coalition. So, as the cavalcade happened at the same time as the third battle of Ciudad Rodrigo that period of time is considered as a turning point in the Leonese Succession War."
