Succeeded by Sancha of Castile\n\nEarly reign. He inherited the county of Barcelona from his father Ramon Berenguer III on August 19, 1131. On August 11, 1137 in Huesca he was betrothed to the infant Petronila of Aragon, aged one at the time. Her father, Ramiro II of Aragon the Monk, who sought Barcelona's aid against Alfonso VII of Castile, abdicated on November 13 that same year, leaving his kingdom to Petronilla and Ramon Berenguer. The latter essentially became ruler of Aragon, although he was never king himself, but instead Count of Barcelona, Prince of the Kingdom of Aragon. He was the last Catalan ruler to use the title of Count as his first; starting with his son Alfonso II of Aragon the counts of Barcelona styled themselves, in the first place, as kings of Aragon.\n\nThe treaty between Ramon Berenguer and his father-in-law stipulated that their descendants would rule jointly over both realms. Even should Petronila die before the marriage could be consummated, Berenguer would still inherit the title of King of Aragon.[citation needed] Both realms would preserve their laws, institutions and autonomy, remaining legally distinct but federated in a dynastic union under one ruling House. Historians consider this arrangement the political masterstroke of the Hispanic Middle Ages. Both realms gained greater strength and security and Aragon got its much needed outlet to the sea. On the other hand, formation of a new political entity in the north-east at a time when Portugal seceded from León in the west gave more balance to the Christian kingdoms of the peninsula. Ramon Berenguer successfully pulled Aragon out of its pledged submission to Castile, aided no doubt by the beauty and charm of his sister Berenguela, wife of Alfonso the Emperor, for which she was well-known in her time.\n\nCrusades and wars. In the middle years of his rule, his attention turned to campaigns against the Moors. In October 1147, as part of the Second Crusade, he helped Castile to conquer Almería. He then invaded the lands of the Almoravid taifa kingdom of Valencia and Murcia. In December 1148, he captured Tortosa after a five-month siege with the help of Southern French, Anglo-Normans and Genoese crusaders.[1] The next year, Fraga, Lleida and Mequinenza in the confluence of the Segre and Ebro rivers fell to his army. The reconquista of modern Catalonia was completed.\n\nRamon Berenguer also campaigned in Provence, helping his brother Berenguer Ramon and his infant nephew Ramon Berenguer II against Counts of Toulouse. During the minority of Ramon Berenger II the Count of Barcelona also acted as the regent of Provence (between 1144 and 1157). In 1151, Ramon signed the Treaty of Tudilén with Alfonso VII of León. The treaty defined the zones of conquest in Andalusia in order to prevent the two rulers from coming into conflict. Also in 1151, Ramon Berenguer founded and endowed the royal monastery of Poblet. In 1154, he accepted the regency of Gaston V of Béarn in return for the Bearnese nobles rendering him homage at Canfranc, thus uniting that small principality with the growing Catalanoaragonese empire.\n\nDeath. He died in 1162 in Borgo San Dalmazzo, Piedmont, Italy, leaving the title of Count of Barcelona to his eldest son Ramon Berenguer, who next year inherited the title of King of Aragon from his mother's abdication Petronila of Aragon (Ramiro II was already dead), and, in compliment to the Aragonese, changed his name to Alfonso and became Alfonso II of Aragon. Ramon Berenguer's younger son Pedro inherited the county of Cerdanya and lands north of the Pyrenees.\n\nThe elder son of Ramon Berenguer III, he continued his father's crusading wars against the Almoravid Muslims. The kingdom of Aragon soon sought Ramon Berenguer IV's aid against Castile. In the course of their negotiations, he was promised the hand of the Aragonese king Ramiro II's daughter and heir, Petronila (Peronella); they were married on Aug. 11, 1137, and a few months later (November 13), Ramiro II abdicated in favour of his daughter and son-in-law. Ramon Berenguer IV thus became the last count of Barcelona to take this as his principal title, for, from 1137, he was also ruler of Aragon (though he himself never assumed the title of king). From the reign of his son, who in 1162 succeeded him with the title of Alfonso II, the counts of Barcelona styled themselves, in the first place, kings of Aragon.\n\nWhen Ramon Berenguer IV's father had died, he had left the county of Provence to a younger son. When this son died, his brother Ramon Berenguer IV acted as regent (conventionally with the title Ramon Berenguer II of Provence) until the legitimate heir, his young nephew, reached majority in 1157, as Ramon Berenguer III of Provence. When this count of Provence died in 1166 without a male heir, he was succeeded by Ramon Berenguer IV's son Alfonso II, king of Aragon. By his wars and conquests from the Moors--Tortosa (1148), Lerida, Mequinenza, and Fraga (1149), and Prades and Siurana (1153)--Ramon Berenguer IV definitively established the boundaries of the principality of Catalonia.\n\nCopyright © 1994-2001 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\n\nRamón Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, was also called Ramon \"the Holy.\" He effected the union between Aragon and Catalonia into the Crown of Aragon.\n\nOn August 11, 1137 in Huesca, Ramón was betrothed to the infant Petronila of Aragon, aged one at the time.
