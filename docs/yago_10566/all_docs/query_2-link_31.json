        "text": "Enrique I of Castile (14 April 1204[1] – 6 June 1217) was king of Castile. He was the son of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile (daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine). He was the brother of Berenguela and Mafalda of Castile.\n\nIn 1211, Enrique became heir to the throne when his older brother Ferdinand suddenly died.\n\nWhen his father died in 1214, Henry was just 10 years old, so the regency was assumed by Enrique's older sister Berengaria of Castile, wife of Alfonso IX of Leon.\n\nIn 1215, Enrique married Mafalda of Portugal, daughter of Sancho I of Portugal. As he was very young, the marriage was not consummated, and it was dissolved in 1216 by Pope Innocent III on grounds of consanguinity. In the same year, Henry became betrothed to his second cousin Sancha, heiress of León.\n\nEnrique died in Palencia in 1217 at the age of 13, killed by a tile coming off a roof. His sister Berengaria succeeded him, before renouncing the throne in favour of her son Ferdinand III. His body was buried at Las Huelgas monastery in Burgos.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_I_of_Castile\n\nhttps://dbe.rah.es/biografias/6616/enrique-i-de-castilla\n\nKing of Castile and Toledo:\n\nReign: 5 October 1214 – 6 June 1217\n\nPredecessor: Alfonso VIII\n\nSuccessor: Berengaria\n\nBorn: 14 April 1204, Valladolid\n\nDied: 6 June 1217 (aged 13), Palencia\n\nBurial: Las Huelgas, Burgos\n\nSpouse: Mafalda of Portugal\n\n​(m. 1215; annulled 1216)​\n\nHouse: Castilian House of Ivrea\n\nFather: Alfonso VIII of Castile\n\nMother: Eleanor of England\n\nReligion: Roman Catholicism\n\nTomb of Enrique I of Castile.
