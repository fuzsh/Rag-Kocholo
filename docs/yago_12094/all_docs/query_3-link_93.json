        "text": "Sweetland\n\nThis screening took place on Saturday, February 10, 2024 at 12:00 pmYukon Arts Centre\n\nSt. John’s filmmaker, Christian Sparkes has two dramatic features screening at ALFF ’24. The King Tide (Opening Film of the festival) is a fantasy film, whereas Sweetland, based on a book by the acclaimed writer Michael Crummey, is rooted in the modern re-settlement experience of outport Newfoundland and represents a genre we’ll call Newfoundland Gothic.\n\nThis heartbreaking film tells the story of an endangered Newfoundland community and the struggles of Moses, a man determined to resist its extinction. Visually stunning, Sweetland features impeccable performances and a sparse but gutting script delivered in a fable-like manner.\n\nContent advisory: strong language and peril.\n\nRecommended ages 13+\n\nGenre: Drama"
