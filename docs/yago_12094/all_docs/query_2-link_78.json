        "text": "Welcome back to Deep Focus. In this week’s episode, host Rodrigo Perez, also the Editor-in-Chief of The Playlist.net taslks to Michael Sarnoski, the writer and director of “A Quiet Place: Day One” which is now available to rent or buy digitally from Paramount Home Entertainment.\n\nSarnoski, as you probably know launched his career with the quiet and delicate indie “Pig” which featured a beautifully nuanced performance out of Nicolas Cage. For his “A Quiet Place” spin-off prequel, when John Krasinski, the writer/director of the previous two franchise installments called Sarnoski to pitch him the project, he wondered if the filmmaker would want to bring his “Pig” touch to the franchise.\n\nSarnoski went away, thought about it a bit, and pitched his take on the movie, something epic in scale set in New York, but in many ways, deeply human, character driven and subverting a lot of blockbuster tropes in the meantime. And they all went for it. And when Krasinski said he wanted some of that “Pig” touch brought into the ‘Quiet Place’ franchise, well he got exactly that and maybe more.\n\nAs you may already know, ‘Day One’ flashes back to the first day of the invasion by deadly creatures who hunt by sound in one of the loudest places on Earth: New York City. Lupita Nyong’o and Joseph Quinn give emotionally devastating and riveting performances as strangers who embark on a harrowing journey through the eerily quiet streets of Manhattan in order to just get a slice of pizza.\n\nI spoke to Sarnoski all about the pitching of the film, the creation of the film, working with John Krasinski, Jeff Nichols’ version of the script—he was the first filmmaker on the project but bowed out—whether he would ever attempt more ‘A Quiet Place’ sequel and his upcoming next film, “The Death Of Robin Hood” which will star Hugh Jackman and Jodie Comer.\n\nPixar Reportedly Considering Reboots Including ‘The Incredibles’ & ‘Finding Nemo’\n\nHow times change. There once was an era when Pixar just didn’t think it needed sequels and could just go from original story to original story. In fact in 2016, Pixar’s president Jim Morris said there were no Pixar sequel plans after Brad Bird’s “The Incredibles 2,” something of a response to the underwhelming reception to “Cars 2” and to a lesser degree, “Toy Story 3.”\n\n“Most studios jump on doing a sequel as soon as they have a successful film, but our business model is a filmmaker model, and we don’t make a sequel unless the director of the original film has an idea that they like and are willing to go forward on,” Morris said at the time.\n\nWhile Pixar has certainly tried to stick to that—six of the ten movies they’ve released since the summer of 2016 have been original— since Morris’ remarks, they’ve released “Toy Story 4” (even when they said ‘3’ was the finale), the spin-off “Lightyear,” and this summer’s upcoming “Inside Out 2.”\n\nA “Toy Story 5” is in the works, and now a new report from Bloomberg— discussing many of Pixar’s recent layoffs and woes— says not only are sequels still game, but Pixar is considering rebooting some of its classic films.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg piece, “Every hit of yesteryear is being considered for a reboot, with Finding Nemo and The Incredibles regarded as particularly strong candidates for new titles.”\n\nPixar’s new strategy to turn around their financial problems” involves balancing original movie ideas with sequels and spinoffs, the better to remind audiences what they once loved about Pixar.”\n\nThe new aim is apparently to make three new movies every two years, which is historically much less frequent to their usual, one film a year cadence, “with every other title a sequel or spinoff and the rest standalone concepts or potential seeds for new franchises.”\n\nThis also sounds a lot like Bob Iger and Disney’s less is more approach and their dialing back at Marvel and Lucasfilm.\n\nOn May 21, Pixar announced the company’s largest restructuring, cutting 175 jobs as the studio refocuses on big-screen films instead of Disney+ projects—also not dissimilar to the way Marvel and Lucasfilm are heading, back to the big screen with a deemphasis on Disney+ programming.\n\nIt's a sign of the times, unfortunately, and financially they are not great at the moment, a trend that is affecting the entire industry. Will they follow through? This industry is fickle, so we shall see, but if the box office of 2024 is any indication, these alarming trends may just continue to dominate for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn this week’s episode of The Discourse, host Mike DeAngelo roams the forest in search of his next victim while discussing “In A Violent Nature.” The movie follows a resurrected killer through the woods as he stalks his victims, all while searching for his stolen necklace. The film is written and directed by Chris Nash and stars Ry Barrett, Josh Lucas, Andrea Pavlovic, Cameron Love, Reece Presley, and more.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘In a Violent Nature’ Review: Chris Nash’s Debut Heralds a Major New Voice in Horror [Sundance]\n\nDuring the interview, Chris Nash discusses not only the obvious homages to '80s slashers like “Friday the 13th” but also the less-expected influences that just as heavily influenced the tone and approach to his first feature film.\n\nIn this week’s episode of The Discourse, your host, Mike D’Angelo and Playlist Editor-in-Chief jump on the mic to talk with Joanna Robinson, one of the writers on the new book “MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios” co-written by Dave Gonzales and, Gavin Edwards.\n\nGiven everything that’s happened/happening to Marvel this year, this all and this weekend—the flop of “The Marvels,” the Studios lowest-grossing opening ever and their first major failure in, well, forever—the book and the conversation, is timely.\n\nRobinson is a veteran journalist who has worked for Vanity Fair, many other outlets and currently works at the Ringer. For the book, her Gonzales and Edwards interviewed over 100 people and sources to tell the Marvel Studios story, from the early days of Stan Lee and producer Avi Arad, the pre-inception of Marvel Studios (when Marvel had movies and characters scattered all over at places like Universal, Paramount and of course 20th Century Fox), the big gamble of making Marvel Studios with Kevin Feige, all the risks they took and more."
