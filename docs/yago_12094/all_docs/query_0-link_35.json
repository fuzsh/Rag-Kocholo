        "text": "Although director Ali Selim's drama \"Sweet Land\" tends to be a film festival standout and a critic pleaser, be cautious of the raves.\n\nThis post-World War I tale of a mail-order bride and her farming romance is a yawn-inducing, slow-to-go saga that relies heavily on facial expressions and sporadic dialogue. So, if you're not in the mood, don't bother. It is a typical example of a period film that will likely snag a slew of awards and leave audiences wondering why.\n\nSet in the 1920s, immigrant Inge (Elizabeth Reaser), travels from Germany to Minnesota to wed a Norwegian farmer, Olaf (Tim Guinee). The historic climate is one of suffragism and German suspicion due to the war, and the backdrop is an austere, rural landscape.\n\nWhen we are introduced to the stunning young Inge, she is without papers, is lugging around a Victrola and has a vacant face that tells of a language barrier. She doesn't speak any English, but her voice is secondary to her emotion-rich looks.\n\nAs the plot unfolds, because of Inge and Olaf's disparate citizenships, they are initially not allowed to court. Time passes, obstacles are overcome, the two forge a relationship under the curtain of sexual tension, and by 1968, Inge buries her husband on their Minnesota estate. The narrative is told in flashback form, as we watch an elderly Inge tell her grandson (who is mulling over whether to sell the farm) her life's journey.\n\nBased on Will Weaver's short story, \"A Gravestone Made of Wheat,\" Selim's debut feature recounts the hardships of organic corn harvesting. The cast is a strong suit, with Alan Cumming as Olaf's friend Frandsen, John Heard as Minister Sorrenson, Ned Beatty as the banker Harmo and multiple Tony Award nominee Lois Smith as old Inge.\n\nHowever, it isn't until at least halfway in that the film begins to smolder, as Inge and Olaf finally discover their chemistry. Waiting for the buildup can be torturous, especially because of the peppered banter.\n\nFor those novel-readers out there who don't mind flipping a hundred pages to get to the meat, \"Sweet Land\" may be the perfect sojourn. But for the rest of us ..."
