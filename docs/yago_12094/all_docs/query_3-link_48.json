        "text": "Here is a nicely photographed, but bland, insipid and weirdly passive-aggressive little film that has been knocking around since 2005, and long been available in the US on DVD. It is set largely in rural Minnesota just after the first world war, when migrant incomers from Scandinavia and Germany, who have arrived to try their luck working the land, face suspicion and out-and-out hostility from the locals on account of the fact that they are still thought of as The Enemy. Elizabeth Reaser is Inge, the beautiful enigmatically smiling German woman who has come over to marry honest, stolid Olaf (Tim Guinee). Bureaucratic niggles mean they can't get a judge to hitch them, so they cause scandal by living together anyway. Alan Cumming plays Frandsen, the quirky guy with loads of kids and no money who befriends them. Reaser's performance is fairly annoying, as she sports her silent, martyred little smile and goes into Jane Campion Piano mode. And the plot does not make satisfactory sense as Olaf makes a grand gesture to help Frandsen out of a financial jam in the final reel - we aren't shown how exactly he thinks his gesture will help, and what precisely is at risk for him personally if it does not work. The \"flashback\" structure moreover fails to add depth. An unusual little picture, but there's not much more to be said for it than that."
