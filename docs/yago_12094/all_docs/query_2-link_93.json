        "text": "Secret Invasion director Ali Selim provided some intriguing insights into the upcoming Marvel series during a recent interview with Total Film. Selim described the Disney Plus project as a “six-hour movie unto itself” and assured fans that it would wrap things up nicely. However, Selim also hinted at the possibility of a second season.\n\n“When it ends, I hope you feel satiated and complete. And as Marvel does so excellently, you also feel like ‘Oh, it could go in this direction,'” Selim teased.\n\nThe director also ventured close to spoiler territory by hinting at the fate of certain characters. Selim revealed: “Nick Fury is alive and continues to battle, I don’t think that’s a spoiler alert. And there are some characters that are no longer with us and some characters that live to see another challenge.”\n\nDeveloped by Kyle Bradstreet, Secret Invasion stars Marvel veteran Samuel L. Jackson, who reprises his role as Nick Fury, with Ben Mendelsohn joining him as the shape-shifting alien Talos. The series is expected to feature a high-stakes storyline that sees the two working together to unravel a complex conspiracy that threatens the entire world.\n\nHow Marvel is adapting Secret Invasion\n\nSecret Invasion is based on the comic book storyline of the same name, which was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Leinil Francis Yu . The story revolves around a group of Skrulls, an alien race that has the ability to shape-shift and take on the appearance of anyone they want. The Skrulls have infiltrated Earth’s society and are secretly replacing key figures with their own kind in order to take over the planet.\n\nThe full Secret Invasion cast also includes Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Gravik, Emilia Clarke as G’iah, Don Cheadle as James “Rhodey” Rhodes and Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross. Olivia Colman, Dermot Mulroney, Killian Scott, Christopher McDonald, Carmen Ejogo and Charlayne Woodard are also on board in undisclosed roles.\n\nStuned for all the latest news regarding the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel for more content."
