        "text": "The film, Sweet Land, will be shown at 7:00 on Friday, March 8 at the Winona Arts Center, 228 East 5th Street, Winona. Our doors open at 6:30 pm and the cost is $5.\n\nThis film is a winner of the Independent Spirit Award First Feature. Sweet Land is a lovely old-fashioned farm romance quietly doubling as a commentary on immigration and American identity. Inge is a feisty German mail-order bride who has come to Minnesota to marry Olaf, a young Norwegian immigrant farmer of few words. In a post-WWI anti-German climate, the local minister forbids the marriage. They fall in love despite the town’s disapproval. Olaf’s friend faces foreclosure on his farm and finally the community unites around all the farmers.\n\nEnglish and German with subtitles. 111 minutes.\n\nThis film is made possible by the voters of Minnesota through a grant from the Southeast Minnesota Arts Council thanks to a legislative appropriation from the Arts and Cultural Heritage fund.\n\nFor more information about this and other events at the Winona Arts Center, please visit our website at www.winonaarts.org."
