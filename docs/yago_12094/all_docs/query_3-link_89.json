        "text": "The government is ready to resettle the far-flung fishing community of Sweetland, Newfoundland with a healthy pay-out — but only if the entire community signs up for the move. Retired fisherman Moses (Mark Lewis Jones) is one of the last hold-outs. He’s lived here his entire life, and he’s not ready to put his ghosts behind him. Reminiscent of Gordon Pinsent’s classic John and the Missus, this adaptation of a novel by Michael Crummey is distinguished by its beautiful cinematography and a formidable central performance from Mark Lewis Jones. Director Christian Sparkes (Cast No Shadow) also has The King Tide on release this year; he’s emerging as an important figure in Canadian filmmaking."
