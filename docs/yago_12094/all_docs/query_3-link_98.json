        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Youth should be a time of innocence, but in the midst of war children suffer heart wrenching consequences.\n\nSuch is the reality for Vrej, the 11-year-old boy at the center of My Sweet Land, a documentary that makes its world premiere next month at Sheffield DocFest, the U.K.’s leading nonfiction film festival. Vrej was born in Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh), an ethnic Armenian territory within Azerbaijan that has been the sight of fighting ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe documentary is directed and produced by Sareen Hairabedian, an Armenian-Jordanian filmmaker based in New York. We have your first look at the film in the trailer above.\n\n“Vrej… watches birds, plays with friends and dreams of being a dentist. But echoes of the three wars his family have lived through since 1992 are ever-present,” Sheffield DocFest notes in its program. “His grandmother laments the cycle of ethnic violence: ‘Living in Artsakh means that one day there will be a war and my grandson will participate in that war.’ As his school lessons become increasingly militarized and Vrej struggles to hold on to his childhood dreams, his grandmother watches her prophecy unfold.”\n\nVrej, wise beyond his years, says in the trailer, “We live in a country where war is expected to start at any moment. I don’t want my children to witness war. I may experience it, but I don’t want that for my children.”\n\nMy Sweet Land debuts June 13 at DocFest, with additional screenings set for June 15 and 16.\n\nHairabedian writes in a director’s statement, “As a great-grandchild of Armenian genocide survivors, I carry the deeply-rooted traumas of my ancestors who were expelled from their indigenous lands and found refuge in the Middle East. I grew up in a small community of Armenians in Jordan, attended schools where nationalism was praised and recited poems about the lands that ‘will be freed’ one day. Nothing and no one has been freed.\n\n“In 2018, that trauma brought me to a hidden enclave in the stoic mountains of the South Caucasus, named Artsakh, internationally known as Nagorno-Karabakh. As an Armenian, I wanted to hear the stories of its ethnic Armenian population who, to this day, are engaged in wars to preserve their homeland and cultural identity. The story that started to unveil before my camera was about the generational cycle of trauma that kept the resilience of a people alive while passing down the burdens of war to its children. That’s when I met Vrej.”\n\nHairabedian adds, “I made this film because I strongly believe that the story of Vrej and all children, whose basic human rights are ripped away from them the day they are born, should be seen and heard. These children have hopes and dreams and deserve to live in peace—not as prisoners to inherited wars.”\n\nMy Sweet Land is produced by HAI Creative in co-production with Sister Productions and Soilsíu Films, a co-production of ITVS in association with ARTE France and World of HA Productions. The documentary is directed and produced by Sareen Hairabedian and produced by Azza Hourani. Co-producers are Julie Paratian and David Rane. Executive producers are Beth Levison, Carrie Lozano, Hallee Adelman, Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh. Robina Riccitiello is co-EP.\n\nHairabedian shot the film and edited it along with Raphaëlle Martin-Holger. The score is composed and produced by Tigran Hamasyan.\n\nThe 31st edition of Sheffield DocFest runs from June 12-17 in the South Yorkshire area of England. This year’s program includes 48 world premieres, 14 international premieres, and 17 European premieres.\n\nWatch the trailer for My Sweet Land above."
