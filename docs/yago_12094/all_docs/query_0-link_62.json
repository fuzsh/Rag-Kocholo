Although it is not a competitive program it is much like going to state in a sport. In an average year the VISTA company would be invited to perform a medley from the show on the State Theatre stage. Because of Covid the Spotlight Showcase the event will be held on Hennepin Ave in front of the State Theatre with limited in-person participation. Our very own Lizzie Nelson is one of the finalists for the 20/21 Technical Award. Lizzie was chosen from students across the state and it is a very high honor. She will be on the production team for the 20/21 Showcase so will be attending in person. They will announce the winner at the event which is Tuesday June 15th 6:30-9:30.
