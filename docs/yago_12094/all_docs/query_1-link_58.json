        "text": "The film Sweet Land takes us through the life of a German mail-order bride named Inge Altenberg, played by Elizabeth Reaser, who comes to America with just a suitcase and her gramophone. Sweet Land is based off of a short story collection called “A Gravestone Made of Wheat” by Will Weaver in 1989 that won several awards such as the Minnesota Book Award for fiction. This movie also takes place after World War I where there is much American hostility towards the German people especially German immigrants who are to be feared, supposedly. They are instead seen as “German nationals…German nationals engage in prostitution, they encourage polygamy, they harbor dangerous political convictions” according to people such as the Clerk of Court at the beginning of the movie voices the more “legal” aspect as to why the German immigrants are not welcome to the United States.\n\nUnfortunately for Inge, she is not the typical German immigrant who typically comes over with her family in search of a prosperous life financially, but instead she is a mail-order bride who comes to live with her potential husband Olaf who is played by Tim Guinee. Originally before coming to the United States Inge is an orphan from Snasa, Norway with no immigration papers. This film, like most, has a love story which is found between Inge and Olaf who are denied marriage by a local minister, played by John Heard. This is a result of Inge not having the proper paper work that would allow her to naturalize if and when they are able to be married. During this time period, the United States immigration laws had made it easy for immigrants to naturalize, because in prior waves of immigration they were seen as the “favorable” immigrant group due to the fact that they were educated as well as other things.\n\nXenophobic hostilities arise when Inge arrives, and there is an emphasis of Inge’s language skills and ability to learn English as quickly as possible, for Olaf believes that in order for them to be able to get married she must be able to speak English properly, instead of the Norwegian and German that she does speak already. When she struggles to speak English, she is then forced to speak the Norwegian instead of her fluent language of German in attempts to convince the community her and Olaf live in, that she’s not their enemy. The nice thing about this film is that the director, Ali Selim, offers flashbacks in the beginning and end of the movie that reassure you that Olaf and Inge do in fact remain with one another, even in old age, and they even have a son by the name of Lars. Lars is the one who has to make a tough decision about wither or not to sell the farm after the death of his parents because the land was something that his parents fought so hard to keep.\n\nThe love story is not the only focal point of this storyline, but so is the land that helps to bring Olaf and Inge together for it is their livelihood as it was for most German farmers during his time period. Olaf, even before Inge comes to live with him, is struggling to keep up with his neighboring American farmers. These American farmers not only have the money to pay for work hands, but they also have the money to purchase the necessary machines to be able to harvest wheat and other crops a lot faster than farmers such as Olaf. His friend Frandsen tries to compete with these American farmers by purchasing an expensive tractor that he purchased through a loan that he could not afford. Which causes his home to be almost taken away if it was not for his friend Lars winning his house in an auction for $7,000. Lars himself cannot hardly pay for Frandsen’s home and tries to buy time with a mortgage as he tries to obtain enough money to pay off his new debt.\n\nAs a result, upon Inge’s arrival, she begins to help Olaf take care of his farm animals and helps with harvesting the crops though; however, this is nowhere near the amount of help he needs in order to keep both his home and Frandsen’s. If Lars and Inge do not pay off the mortgage then they will not only lose their home, but also go to jail as well. Due to this threat, Olaf emphasizes the fact that “Banking and farming do not mix,” due to the fact that farming is a gamble especially if one takes on too many responsibilities like his dear friend Frandsen had done. This instead causes him to work harder against all odds as he harvests his crops in hopes to get the money that he needs to keep his as well as Frandsen’s houses, farms, and more importantly, properties. Land during this era was most important, for immigrants did not typically have the opportunity to have a piece of their own, and it was vital in order to have a say within the local community. Also, by having this land showed that Olaf and Inge could be like the Americans regardless of their foreign backgrounds.\n\nInge, of course, helps Olaf to keep his property, but she tries to remind Olaf that life is not all about work, but about following their dreams. She makes an example of ducks, and how they dream just like humans do in order to show that he is like the duck with dreams in order to prove her point. Within the movie, we see Inge trying to make Olaf lighten up and not always focus on work, but also other aspects of life that makes everything worthwhile. She does this by introducing him to music through dancing as she plays her phonograph that she brought with her from her homeland. Eventually, they come to understand each other with or without being officially married and even grow to love each other in the end.\n\nUnfortunately, after months of hard work trying to come up with the money for their farm, they fall short; unexpectedly, though, the community that was so against them is able to secretly provide them with enough money for them to keep their house. This is all thanks to the local minister that gave them such a hard time in the beginning about being different from the American people within their town. This minister even managed to kick both Inge and Olaf out of church during a service because he caught them dancing together out on the porch of Olaf’s home, and heard rumors that they were sleeping within the same quarters. The town’s people are able to show their compassion for those wishing to share the same dreams that they themselves do, realizing that they are not so different after all, regardless of where they came from or how black their coffee may be. The church eventually allows Olaf and Inge to officially marry, even with the rumors of them sleeping within the same house hold before marriage, even though Olaf instead slept in his barn while Inge slept inside the house, due to the fact that Inge had nowhere else to live upon arriving to the United States. Before coming to live with Olaf she did live with Frandsen and his family, but with their financial difficulties they could barely take care of her and their nine children.\n\nOne aspect of this film that really pops out is the language barriers that complicated the lives of most immigrants coming to the United States. This is a film where there are no subtitles used even though there are large parts of the movie where the characters are only speaking German or Norwegian. The director, Ali Selim put the language barrier in place especially between Olaf and Inge because he found it to be “a metaphor for most men and most women who speak an entirely different language and have to find something more than the intellectual power of words to communicate” (Kerr, 2006). This allows the audience to understand not only the importance of Inge learning to speak English, but also how Americans felt during that era who did not understand other language besides English. It allows the audience to feel alienated by such conversations as both immigrants and American citizens often did when it came to listening as well as trying to understand someone speaking a foreign language of any sort. Due to the language barriers that were created one can tell how Americans became hostile towards the immigrants that they did not understand especially when it came to communication. As these scenes are playing, not all is lost as there is much body language being used that helps one to understand what is going on within the conversations that were entirely made up on the spot so that no one could understand what anyone was saying unless it was in English. Even as Inge spoke English, it was difficult to understand as she mostly said “I could eat a horse” when she was hungry, which makes the community members cringe as they listen to her “devil’s talk” (Scheib, 2005).\n\nAlso, visually, this film shows off the importance of the land as it does not show dull colors, but instead shows the promises and beauty of the land found in Minnesota. This film depicts bright colors of blue skies, green grass, and colorful crops that are brightly shown as Olaf and Inge work hard to keep the farm. By showing these enriching colors, it helps to reveal what the American dream for this couple really is, and the importance of the land for it is one of the main focal points of the film. That is why no real seasons of change are shown such as spring, autumn, and winter because the director did not want to take away from this beauty even though this film shows the time lapses of life in Minnesota (Westbrook 2005). In a press junket interview, Ali Selim, the director admits how the cinematography that was chose through the several lenses was able to evoke emotions and add to the story as the viewers are able to see the deep greens of the grass and bright yellows of the barley (as shown in the youtube video clip blow).\n\nThe director, Ali Selim created this film based on a short story titled “A Gravestone Made of Wheat” that was written by Will Weaver who worked with the director to create the film Sweet Land. Prior to creating this film Selim had directed other productions such as six episodes in an HBO televison series, inTreatment and even worked in advertising where he had directed five commercials. The reason why he had created this film was to reminisce over the stories that he was told of his Swedish-American grandparents and their tales of the prairie. Even when reading the story he had “got a little teary-eyed when [he] finished it” as well as the writer of the story Will Weaver who admitted to crying as he finished the story (Kerr, 2006). Other than the short story being a heart felt narative, Selim also decided to film Sweet Land in Minnesota because he himself is form the area where he still lives today, had it not been his father immigrating from Egypt before Ali was born in order to attend the University of Minnesota to study Economics. For him through both the story of Sweet Land and “A Gravestone Made of Wheat” really had reminded him of his father’s stories of his journey to the United States that had really pulled at Ali’s very heart strings that gave him the motivation to create this film. Stories of his father had really carried with him throughout the production of the film as he pictured his father’s feelings of being in a new country where one has to immerse themselves within a new culture that is unfamiliar (Landmark Theatres, 2007).\n\nA way in which the director, Ali Selim, was able to create parallels between his father’s story and the film, Sweet Land was that Ali’s father would always complain that the tea in America is too sweet unlike tea found within Egypt, where his father emigrated from. In the film the director tries to incorporate this same idea when the minister drinks the coffee that Inge makes for him and says that it is too black because too many beans were used to make it. Even in another scene this same concept is brought up when Inge first makes Olaf dinner he asks if it is German food in which she responds that it is “Just food,” and nothing else. Regardless of how it is prepared, the texture, or the taste Olaf still simply eats what is given to him for the sake of nourishment (Landmark Theaters, 2007). The reason why these parallels are created was to show symbolically how no matter how food tastes, or how it looks it is still just food. This is the same sort of logic that can be applied to how an immigrant is perceived because no matter where they’re from, what the look like, what language they speak, or from what religious background they come from, they are still in fact humans just like the rest of us.\n\nOver all this independent film had won several awards such as the Audience Award at the Florida Film Festival in 2006 for Best Narrative as well as the Best Narrative Feature award at the Hamptons International Film Festival. Other awards included the Jury Award from the Newport Beach Film Festival for Best Actress which was given to Elizabeth Reaser who played Young Inge. The reason why this film had received numerous awards was because it had brought about a different viewing experience for those in the audience and seemed to really depict the German immigrant experience after arriving within the United States. It allows its audience to immerse themselves within their lives as well as lifestyles to show the importance of not only the love this couple shares, but also the importance of maintaining the American dream of owning land that was not available in Europe at the time of war where everything was destroyed. Even though this couple had a lot to struggle with, they were able in the end to gain acceptance by their discriminate community members; once they ignored the social norms they were eventually able to be embraced."
