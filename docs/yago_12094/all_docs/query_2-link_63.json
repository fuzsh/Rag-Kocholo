        "text": "‘Betrayed’ shows off some of the worst of the Marvel TV shows’ serialization tendencies. In the bid for cliffhangers and pay-offs, the pace of the shows can get very wonky, and this episode feels both rushed and glacially paced at the same time. And while they’re aiming for the impression of game-changing events, there’s so little context for what’s going on here that it’s hard to get emotionally or intellectually invested, especially when the show has been at pains to remind us that nothing is ever what it seems.\n\nTo take an obvious point first, late in the episode Emilia Clarke’s G’iah is shot by Gravik after he uncovers her as a traitor. Given that Clarke has had so few lines and so little personality development, the question of who she’s working for has never built up a particularly compelling amount of tension anyway; and she’s dispatched so summarily here that either it’s a fake-out, or the series just was never invested in the character to begin with – either way, what feels like it’s meant to be a shocking twist instead just feels routine. And the weekly pacing is making it hard to remember what we do or don’t know; the fact that G’iah is passing on information to her father, Talos, doesn’t seem to be treated as especially momentous here.\n\nSimilarly, the episode begins with Gravik announcing the plan that the Skrulls are going to take on powers and become Super Skrulls – cool – and then ignores this entirely, apart from the gruesome reveal that Gravik can heal himself. But again, even recognising this as a reveal involves some guesswork – for instance, given that the Skrulls are shape-shifters, is it just that these powers allow them to reconstruct their hands (presumably the ability to reformat their DNA is exactly how they shapeshift?)? Or is it meant to be a jaw-dropping reveal that Gravik has become the Super Skrull by taking Extremis, shown briefly on a screen last week? While the show appears to be aiming for allusion and close attention, instead it’s rather just squandering its own drama and tension.\n\nBetter, in some ways, are the conversations between the old hands. Fury and Olivia Colman’s Sonya have a fun phone chat where Sonya reveals she’s discovered the bug she put on her own ornament, and in response puts a little eyepatch on it. Charlayne Woodard earns her place as Fury’s newly revealed wife by having a great argument with him about his choice to bugger off to space, though – again – given that they’ve only just introduced this relationship and it’s full of lies and new information, it’s hard to get too invested in the problems of their marriage. And Talos and Fury get to have some well-performed conversations about their mutual dependence on one another, though these are also rehashing the conversations from the last episode. It’s just all a bit . . . tedious. And this is from someone who appreciates when Marvel properties take the time to let characters have conversations.\n\nWithin all of this, there’s a crisis-of-the-week plot which seems mostly designed to smoke out G’iah as a traitor. Gravik uses Skrull infiltrators to precipitate a nuclear attack on a plane, which he claims will draw the Avengers out and allow them to plunge Earth into war. Great! Disappointingly, though, this plot boils down to Fury and Talos going to a guy’s house to get him to rescind the order, while G’iah finds out his password. It’s a very small-scale response to a global problem (what’s this guy with this clearance doing at home by himself with no security while initiating nuclear war?), and it remains unclear whether the plan was actually ever even intended to happen or not.\n\nDespite all of this, there’s good material here. A parley between Talos and Gravik is both entertaining (Kingsley Ben-Adir gets to almost literally chew a painting) and tense (as the bystanders around them suddenly all turn out to be Gravik’s Skrulls). There’s some decent dialogue. And the actual premise has potential, both in the Super Skrulls plan and in the sowing of mistrust around the world. But tonight’s episode ends before it feels like it’s fully begun, and it’s going to be frustrating if we lose so much time to false cliffhangers and feints."
