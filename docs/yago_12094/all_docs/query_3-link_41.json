        "text": "Ali Selim's visual masterpiece recalls the stark artistry of Terrence Malick and Western lyricism of Larry McMurtry, as it turns every frame into a picture postcard of stunning beauty.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: A- | May 25, 2013\n\nThe flashback structure adds nothing but length to an already awkward mix of humanist-socialist parable and gently halting love story that's been sat on a shelf since 2005. But even so, it's a surprisingly sweet little treat.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Sep 5, 2008\n\nAt once epic and intimate, Sweet Land offers a stirring account of love and hardship which, aside from a muffed Capra moment towards the end, hardly puts a foot wrong.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Sep 5, 2008\n\nOur movie of the week - which isn't saying much - arrives in the shape of this atmospheric slice of Americana about an arranged marriage deep in the heart of rural Minnesota.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Sep 5, 2008\n\nPleasant surprise of the week, a US indie so unashamedly romantic about pie, cornfields, family and baseball you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching a Presidential campaign video.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Sep 5, 2008\n\nHere is a nicely photographed, but bland, insipid and weirdly passive-aggressive little film.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Sep 5, 2008\n\nMinnesota between the wars is a bone yard for dreams, yet, like Babette's Feast, the film plucks a tiny miracle from stony ground.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Sep 5, 2008\n\nSweet Land could have been mawkish and overly sentimental, but Selim has a light touch and the film is intelligent, sensitive and sweet.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Sep 5, 2008\n\nEchoing Malick's 'Days of Heaven' in the way it captures the majesty of the American countryside, this is a small gem that's worth seeking out.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Sep 5, 2008"
