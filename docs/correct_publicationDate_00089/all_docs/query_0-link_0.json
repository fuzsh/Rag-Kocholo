        "text": "1983 novel by Greg Egan\n\nAn Unusual Angle (1983) was the debut novel by Australian science fiction writer Greg Egan by Norstrilia Press.[1]\n\nThe novel follows a high school boy who makes movies inside his head using a bio-mechanical camera, one that he has grown. He is also able to send out other \"viewpoints\", controlled with his \"psi\" powers, of which he has more power than anyone else he's ever met. Most of the book concerns the boy trying to get his films out of his head, but no brain surgeon will believe him."
