        "text": "At the end of this review there are what may be considered spoilers.\n\nIf you wish to read the story in question before reading the review,\n\nthe full text of it is available at:\n\nhttp://outofthiseos.typepad.com/blog/2008/03/hugo-short-stor.html\n\nGreg Egan used to be one of my favorite writers. I say \"used to be\"\n\nbecause Egan opened my eyes to the wonderfully evocative power of\n\ntruly hard science fiction, only to eventually have him throw it all\n\naway with his own ham-handed politics and pecadillos. For a while,\n\nsince the publication of Schild's Ladder, Egan hasn't written much,\n\nbut now he's back with a new series, the Amalgam stories, the first of\n\nwhich was \"Riding the Crocodile\", and which is the setting for his\n\nnext novel, Incandescence.\n\nA new Amalgam story, \"Glory\", appears in the anthology The New Space\n\nOpera, and has been published for free at Eos books' website.\n\n\"Glory\" is an awful story.\n\nMy reaction to \"Riding the Crocodile\" was that it was Greg Egan\n\npandering to the bulk of his audience: those of us too lazy to\n\nactually follow the physics of Schild's Ladder, but willing to be\n\nthrilled by a certain level of mastery of physics and willing to buy a\n\ncertain amount of handwavery as long as it seemed plausible. \"Riding\n\nthe Crocodile\" is also pandering in that it proposes a posthuman,\n\n\"AI's are people too\" universe in which people flit about from\n\nstarsystem to starsystem via fast-as-light radio transmissions,\n\nswitching from arbitrary digital existence to biological instantiation\n\nwithout a second thought.\n\n\"Glory\" takes this pandering one step further. His opening scene wants\n\nto be one of those masterpieces of physics handwaving, in which he\n\nshows his Amalgam civilization throwing a one kilogram weight almost\n\nup to lightspeed fast enough that it will go all the way through its\n\ntarget star, in the process setting up shock waves so that the star,\n\nin its wake, is briefly turned into a nanomachine factory that creates\n\nprimitive devices for listening for radio waves and converting nearby\n\nmatter into useful tools, which the Amalgam can then operate by remote\n\ncontrol. I don't buy it; neither space nor the insides of stars is\n\nthat predictable. His description of the matter/antimatter engine is\n\namazing; his attempt to convince you that it'll all work in the end\n\npure nonsense.\n\nWhat follows from that is, well, it's not really a Greg Egan story.\n\nInstead, it's more like a Greg Egan fanfic. All of the elements of\n\nEgan's own hangups are there. There's absolutely no possibility of\n\nintimate relationships; Egan has written a species with a reproductive\n\nurge so limited and incapable just so he won't have to write about it\n\nor think about it. (At this point, I have to admit that I kinda miss\n\nthe manipulative, teenage Greg Egan of such passionate works as \"Mind\n\nVampires\" and \"The Demon's Passage.\") The only thing that matters is\n\nmathematics; anyone obsessed with anything else, like art or politics,\n\nis either a fool, a knave, or a villain.\n\nIn the end, the heroine discovers The Big Secret, the Beautiful\n\nUnified Theory of Mathematics, the End Of All Seeking in her\n\ncivilization and when she does this she breaks down and realizes that\n\nshe can't let it go. She can't tell anyone about it. Because if she\n\ndoes, she'll weaken her own civilization's ability to fight the\n\naggressive hegemonizing culture that had the secret and didn't know\n\nit.\n\nWhat makes this unbelievable is the idea that no one in the Amalgam\n\nmay have ever considered this possibility before. I find that\n\ncompletely impossible to believe. How could they not know? A vibrant,\n\npowerful, and excessively chatty civilization (as depicted in \"Riding\n\nthe Crocodile\") somehow doesn't have a punditocracy that's spent\n\ncenturies (and I do mean centuries) asking themselves, \"So, if we ever\n\ndo discover the Unified Mathematica, what will we do then? What will\n\nit mean to us a civilization?\" Somehow, the heroine, a historian of\n\nxenomathematics, is completely unaware of any such pondering going on\n\nwithin her own civilization?\n\nI call bullshit. This story completely failed to move me, either in a\n\nsensawunda depiction of a technological application of known physics\n\n(one of Egan's true strong suits), or in his story, which is a\n\nphoned-in Heinleinesque \"the right man in the right place to make the\n\nright decision,\" only in this case Egan's characters are more shallow\n\nthan usual, their convinctions contrived, and the ending a pale shadow\n\nthat imparts no meaning or message.\n\nElf\n\nFull text of \"Riding the Crocodile,\" with pointers to Incandescensce:\n\nhttp://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/INCANDESCENCE/00/Crocodile.html\n\nFull text of \"Mind Vampires:\"\n\nhttp://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/HORROR/VAMPIRES/Vampires.html\n\nFull text of \"The Demon's Passage:\"\n\nhttp://eidolon.net/?story=The%20Demons%20Passage&pagetitle=The+Demon's+Passage&section=fiction\n\nWebsite for Schild's Ladder:\n\nhttp://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/SCHILD/SCHILD.html\n\n--\n\nElf M.

In fact, an anti-\n\n> fail. :)\n\nReally? I thought it fell a bit flat. The ending was too empty for\n\nsomething this long, and I didn't like the rest of the story quite\n\nenough to redeem it.\n\nThat said, I really enjoy Egan, and I liked most of the concepts in\n\nGlory. I was impressed enough by the relativistic antimatter firework\n\nto ignore the handwaving needed to have it carve out and propell\n\nnanomachines from the face of a star, though I would have balked at it\n\nin a novel. I wasn't bothered by the explicit \"sex copout\" as Elf was\n\neither.\n\nPerhaps it works better if you read a bit more into the ending -\n\n1) that the Amalgalm would thrive better working the MacGuffin out for\n\nthemselves; they'd be damaged by being given it on a plate / knowing\n\nthat someone else had worked it out before them\n\n2) it would cripple their ability to respond to the emerging threat\n\nfrom the expansionist (\"Spreader\") Noudahs.\n\nIt still doesn't convince though. Why is maths quite so important to\n\nthe Amalgalm? And on the second point, the Amalgalm are supposed to\n\nknow \"how to deal with barbarians\".\n\nI suppose it makes sense as a decision made on a risk/benefit basis,\n\nor from the POV of someone who's... well, not literally grieving for\n\ntheir lover or in fear of their life, but at least extrememly fed up\n\nwith their current situation. But this doesn't seem to be well\n\ndeveloped - so I read it as the usual s.f. short story ending, where\n\nmaking the right Decision is absolutely necessary. Re-reading it, I\n\ncan see the subtleties, but for me they were too cryptic to override\n\nmy genre defaults. I wasn't convinced by the basic explanation and I\n\njust wondered whether Egan thought the herione was making the wrong\n\ndecision.\n\nAlan"
