We are fortunate to have the means to show them different parts of the world and this year we are going to Southeast Asia, which will also be new to Susan and myself.\n\nDuring our travels I also tend to detox from the Internet and find time to read. I already have a couple of books with me about the region we are going to, but am looking for a few more recommendations (I will also be reading this month’s USV book club selection, “The Sellout”).\n\nI would love to hear from people: what is the best book you have read in the last 12 months and why?"
