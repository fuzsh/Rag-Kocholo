        "text": "In Australia, fan activity has always been more important than science fiction publishing activity. In the late 1930s Graham Stone, Vol Molesworth and a small number of teenage boys formed the Futurians in Sydney. This small group of males is chiefly remembered for their infinite capacity for feuding among themselves. When they were not disputing over standing orders, they sought out the small number of overseas books and magazines that reached Australia, and swapped them among themselves.\n\nFor the chief problem of Australian science fiction fans from the beginning of World War II until 1959 was gaining supplies - any supplies - of their favourite reading matter. There were no British SF magazines before the War, and virtually all American SF was contained in the pulp magazines. After August 1939, no supplies of these reached Australia, except occasionally as ballast in ships. In Melbourne, these windfall magazines were bought at the dockside or ended up in the famous Franklin's Secondhand Store in the old Eastern Market, which was located where the Southern Cross now stands. Because there were very few copies, each magazine was swapped from one person to another.\n\nIn the early 1950s a small group of teenage boys began to meet in each others' houses, forming the Melbourne Science Fiction Club in 1954.\n\nThey included Lee Harding, who later became a successful science fiction writer for young adults, and won the Australian Children's Book Award in 1982 for Displaced Person, Mervyn Binns, who was for many years manager of McGills Newsagency in Elizabeth St, Melbourne, and then from 1971 to 1985 was the owner/manager of Space Age Books, Dick Jenssen, who later became head of the Meterology Department at Melbourne University, and Race Matthews, who after three years in Federal Parliament during the Whitlam Period became the State Member for Oakleigh, and a Minister during the Cain Government. Two years ago he was forced to take abrupt early retirement from his seat, and has since then tried to regain his links with some members of the SF community. He has written a wonderful short history of the early days of the Melbourne Science Fiction Club, which I'm publishing in the The Metaphysical Review.\n\nThe few people who had ambitions to become successful writers knew that there was only one way to succeed: by selling to overseas magazines, or perhaps even selling a book in New York or London. As early as the 1930s, Wynne Whiteford had sold a story in America.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, a group of writers began to sell stories to the British science fiction magazines New Worlds and Science Fantasy that were edited by Ted Carnell. These authors included Lee Harding. I've already mentioned his later success as a writer of young adults' fiction within Australia. John Baxter was an ambitious Sydney writer on from science fiction and other forms of fiction to writing successful books about film. Damien Broderick, who had actually begun his career by selling stories in Australia, also began selling the occasional story in Britain. Wynne Whiteford, by now a successful journalist, began selling science fiction stories again after a break of many years. David Boutland, who wrote under the name of David Rome, actually broke into the American market with a short story called `Parky' that was picked up, then and now, for anthologies.\n\nThe most successful of all was an honorary Australian, A. Bertram Chandler. A British sea captain, he had been selling stories regularly in America since 1940. After he joined the Australian National Line in the 1950s, he called himself an Australian writer.\n\nThese were the people whose names I knew from reading the British magazines when I became a fan in late 1967. My involvement with the SF field is told in an article I wrote for Tirra Lirra called `How I Became an Editor'. It's enough to say that I became involved soon after the first real revival of interest in science fiction that happened in 1966. As always in Australia, that interest was driven by publishing Australian Science Fiction Review. It was a fanzine. Since it's a word that I will use often, I'd better define it.\n\nThe best definition I know is `A fanzine is a magazine written and published by science fiction fans, usually distributed among science fiction fans, but not necessarily about science fiction'. ASTR, as Australian Science Fiction Review was known, was mainly about science fiction, but it also had a lot of humour and banter, which is the reason why people appreciated it. It put people in touch with each other, leading directly to the beginning of fan groups in Adelaide and Brisbane, and the revival of interest in Sydney. I became a reviewer for ASTR just before its first incarnation folded in 1969. I began my own magazine, SF Commentary, in January 1969, and that magazine is still going.\n\nNow, all this is `amateur' activity; that is, activity carried out purely for the love of it. ASTR was very high-quality amateur activity, since its editor was, and still is, an editor of immaculate standards. For awhile it seemed as if professional activity would follow. Ron Graham, a very rich science fiction collector in Sydney, set up a magazine called Visions of Tomorrow. Financed in Australia, it was published in Britain, and the original idea was to feature half and half Australian and British science fiction writing.\n\nUnfortunately, Graham picked a rather odd character named Phil Harbottle as his editor, and Phil Harbottle had no interest in keeping up the Australian quota. But on the strength of this magazine, Lee Harding became a full-time writer, a fast downward chute to poverty.\n\nThe attempts to initiate the Australian SF publishing industry were based on the activities of fans rather than people who expected to make their fortunes. In 1975 I and two friends, Carey Handfield and Rob Gerrand, began Norstrilia Books. This was originally set up to publish critical books about the field, based on the essays that were appearing in SF Commentary.\n\nOur first book was Philip K. Dick: Electric Shepherd, a series of essays about Philip Dick, my favourite science fiction writer. However, we moved into fiction, beginning with two books, The Altered I and The View from the Edge, which told the story of two of the writers' workshops and published selections written at them.\n\nWe published Keith Antill's Moon in Ground, a novel that had won an award ten years earlier as an unpublished manuscript, and Damien Broderick's The Dreaming Dragons, which also was published overseas and went on to win second prize in the John Campbell Award.\n\nWe only published two novels from the hundreds of manuscripts sent to us: Greg Egan's An Unusual Angle and Jay Bland's Lavington Pugh. I'll tell you more about Greg Egan's career in a moment. Our greatest success, however, was a marginal novel, Gerald Murnane's The Plains. I still insist it is great speculative fiction, and Gerald insists that it has no connection with the field.\n\nLet me give you an example.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Greg Egan from Western Australia sent Norstrilia Press a manuscript called An Unusual Angle, Greg had written it during his last year of high school. Set at a typical Western Australian high school, it tells in first person the story of a boy who believes he has in his head a camera. He makes films of everything he sees. The books is not that film, but about the taking of the film. The story-teller has not yet found a way of processing the film. Fantasy or science fiction? We didn't know, but Greg's astonishingly assured style made us feel that it didn't matter.\n\nWe accepted his manuscript and published it. It didn't sell well, but then, we found it impossible to get anyone to review it properly. The only exception was Sister Veronica Brady from the University of Western Australia. Her review showed that it was possible to see exactly what Greg was up to, even if you had read no science fiction. Greg went off to the Film and Television School in Sydney, stayed one day, and decided it wasn't for him.\n\nUnemployed for some time, he wrote five novels and three books of short stories, and sent them all to us. As chief reader for Norstrilia Press, I found myself with an acute case of literary indigestion. It was all brilliant, and all unpublishable. If I had photocopied those manuscripts, I could have given you a textbook example of the difference between being a brilliant writer and being a publishable writer. Ideas flowed out from each page, but there were so many of them, and so few interesting people in the books, that no audience could have absorbed them.\n\nNeedless to say, Greg was annoyed because we didn't publish his books. Also, we were about to fold our own publishing operations, so we couldn't do much for him. I did give Greg one bit of advice, which he took, and it's the advice I give today. I said that no publisher will do a book of short stories unless most of those short stories have already been published separately to the top markets. I suggested to Greg that he should start tackling the top overseas short story markets. Which is what he did. By the time he sold his first story, to Interzone in England, he had written several million words. I hate to say it, but I suspect that for most successful writers the ratio of words written to words published in the first few years is much the same. Most successful writers tell the same story: writing anything up to a few million words before achieving that first sale."
