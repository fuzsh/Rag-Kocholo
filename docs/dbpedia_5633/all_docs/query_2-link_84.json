        "text": "Ocean’s Films (1960 – Present)\n\nAfter the moderate success of Some Came Running (1958) and the failure of The Thin Man: The Television Show (1957–1959), in 1959, Peter Lawford approached Frank Sinatra with a project about a group of old paratroopers who pull off a big heist in Las Vegas on New Year’s Eve. Both Sinatra and Lawford agreed (one of the few times they did) that it would be a good vehicle for “The Summit” (“The Rat Pack”). With five out of the eleven heisters automatically cast, the rest was just phone calls away. The production occurred in Las Vegas, Nevada on sets mostly, but when they could they would shoot in the casinos. At night the Sinatra and the guys (some say, “boys”) would, “play,” at The Sands Hotel and Casino, Sinatra’s favorite place. They would hold court with some booze but mostly props of various kinds and do shows from around 8:00pm or 9:00pm at night and get done around 2:00am or 3:00am in the morning. If Martin or anyone else, who didn’t want to spend the rest of the night awake talking to Frank until production resumed the next morning, were lucky, they would get to bed around that time and get a few hours rest before the events would repeat the next day.\n\nThose shows featured some of the best in the entertainment world, both on the stage and ringside (audience). On a given night, aside from seeing Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford, one could see Milton Berle, Red Skelton, Don Rickles, Buddy Hackett, Shirley MacLaine, Bob Hope, and / or other notables, including the spouses of said performers. Language was sometimes course but the jokes were always funny and the songs were standards for each of the singers. Sometime a novelty song would show up. No one was safe from the barbs and if a known comedian was in the audience, you could bet (it was Las Vegas after all) that he or she would be called to the stage to do a bit of their act or interact with the boys. The shows proved so popular that they became a regular thing over the years both in Vegas and in later years on the road. Some clips of various shows can be found on YouTube (The Summit or The Rat Pack At The Sands or At The Copacabana). There is also a special from the 1960’s that Sinatra and company did for charity with Johnny Carson on closed circuit television. While this would give you a more complete and sanitized version of what a given show would look like, please do not mistake it for what was being done in Vegas at the time of the filming of Ocean’s 11 (1960).\n\nGetting back to that production: The result of the long days during the production schedule is a movie that has painted Las Vegas as an adult’s playground for over 50 years. It was remade in 2001, which then spun off a series, ending in 2007, and that series in turn spun off a all female series starting in 2018. Below are the film reviews and notes accompanying each series.\n\nOcean’s 11 (1960)\n\nC – 127m\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1 – Widescreen\n\nA.K.A.: Ocean’s Eleven\n\nStory: George Clayton Johnson and Jack Golden Russell\n\nScreenplay: Harry Brown and Charles Lederer\n\nUncredited Contribution: Billy Wilder\n\nProd. – Dir.: Lewis Milestone\n\nAssoc. Prod.: Henry W. Sanicola\n\nStarring: Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, Angie Dickinson, Richard Conte, Cesar Romero, Patrice Wymore, Joey Bishop, Akim Tamiroff, Henry Silva, Ilka Chase, Buddy Lester, Richard Benedict, Jean Willes, Norman Fell, Clem Harvey, Hank Henry, Red Skelton, George Raft, Robert Brice, John Holland, Murray Alper, Don Anderson, Don “Red” Barry, Majorie Bennett, Richard Boone, Paul Bryar, John Craven, Gregory Gaye, John George, Hoot Gibson, Joe Gray, Brad Harris, Shirley MacLaine, Charles Meredith, Anne Neyland, William H. O’Brien, Steve Pendleton, Jack Perrin, Carmen Phillips, Fred Rapport, Joan Staley and George E. Stone.\n\nMusic: Nelson Riddle\n\nSongs: “Ain’t That A Kick In The Head” by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen – Performed by: Dean Martin\n\n“Eee-O-Eleven” – Performed By: Sammy Davis, Jr.\n\nA group of WWII paratroopers join forces to pull of the biggest heist in Las Vegas history: five hotels / casinos in one night – New Year’s Eve! Splendid fun with The Summit / “Rat Pack” offers plenty of laughs and some fun music. Be aware that some of the humor is considered racist by today’s standards but was meant in fun and as social commentary back when the film was made and released. That noted, the film has fine performances, is light fare and has music that will have one bouncing in time with it. Pacing may be slow for kids but teens on should be able to appreciate the film.\n\nTrivia: Sammy Davis, Jr. was not allowed to stay at any of the major hotels / casinos in Vegas until Frank Sinatra and separately Jerry Lewis confronted them (the casinos / hotels) about it, thus breaking the color barrier. Patrice Whymore adlibbed throwing the candy dish during that scene with Sinatra and his friends, hence the genuine look of surprise on their faces. Shirley MacLaine adlibbed her drunk cameo and got a car as compensation from Warner Brothers. Her line, “I’m so drunk I don’t think I lay down without holding on,” was a rehash of a line attributed to Dean Martin that was actually Martin quoting comedian Joe E. Lewis. MacLaine filmed her cameo while on a break from Billy Wilder’s The Apartment (1960). She said she took the job, although compensated as noted with a car, as an excuse to hang out with Sinatra and company and see their Vegas show. Tony Curtis, Jackie Gleason and Milton Berle were all originally offered Cameo roles.\n\nAdditional Trivia Note: There were reported high-jinx of firecrackers being set off in one another’s shoes, and other pranks; like locking one another in the bathroom performed by Sinatra, Martin, Davis, Bishop and Lawford during the filming of this movie. Wouldn’t it have been great to have some of that available on the video releases?! And / or some outtakes?!\n\nOut Of Print on VHS but Available on Blu–ray, DVD & Digital Copy\n\nAfter the mild success of the Ocean’s 11 film, Frank Sinatra and his group would, in various forms go on to make other films together.

Marriage On The Rocks (1965) – Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Cesar Romero amongst other notables. (See review)\n\n13 & 14.) The Tony Rome films (Tony Rome (1967) and Lady In Cement (1968) – see the blog about them for details) featured “in” jokes by Sinatra about Davis, Martin and some of his (Sinatra’s) romantic history. Actor Richard Conte also starred in the films with Sinatra. (See review)\n\n15 – 19.) The Matt Helm films (1966 – 1968) featured Dean Martin taking joking jabs at Frank Sinatra. (See review)\n\n20 & 21.) And Salt And Pepper (1968) and One More Time (1970) teamed Sammy Davis, Jr. and Peter Lawford, the latter being directed by Jerry Lewis. (See review)\n\n22.) Contract On Cherry Street – Starring Frank Sinatra and Henry Silva, amongst others.\n\n23 & 24.) The Cannonball Run (1981) – A huge cast that included Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr.… & The Cannonball Run II (1984) – In addition to the big cast that features Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr., Frank Sinatra has a cameo. (See review)\n\nNone of this includes the numerous television specials and appearances by the various members of the Ocean’s group in which there may be other members or joking references to other members.\n\nSome 40 years after Ocean’s 11 (1960), George Clooney and his, for lack of a better term, “Rat Pack” did a trilogy of Ocean’s films. Below are the reviews.\n\nOcean’s Eleven (2001)\n\nC – 116m\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1 – Widescreen\n\nA.K.A.: Ocean’s 11, O11, 11\n\nOriginal Story: George Clayton Jonson and Jack Golden Russell\n\nOriginal Screenplay: Harry Brown and Charles Lederer\n\nOriginal Uncredited Contribution: Billy Wilder\n\nScreenplay: Ted Griffin\n\nDir.: Steven Soderbergh\n\nStarring: George Clooney, Paul L. Nolan, Bernie Mac, Brad Pitt, Mark Gantt, Tim Perez, Elliott Gould, Frank Patton, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Eddie Jemison, Miguel Perez, Shaobo Qin, Carl Reiner, Lennox Lewis, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Michael DeLano, Julia Roberts, Robin Sachs, J.P. Manoux, Jerry Weintraub, Henry Silva, Eydie Gorme, Angie Dickinson, Steve Lawrence, Wayne Newton, Rusty Meyers, Scott L. Schwartz, Don Cheadle (uncredited), Holly Marie Combs, Jaime Gallagher, Steven Soderbergh, Emanuel Steward, Barry Watson and Shane West.\n\nCinematography By: Steven Soderbergh\n\nDanny Ocean assembles eleven guys to rob three casinos in Las Vegas simultaneously and tries to win back his ex–wife. Fairly quick paced action thriller that reimagines the, “…11”, story for the modern age comes off well. Almost everything works here, especially the major misdirection of the story. A worthy remake!\n\nTrivia: The script was sent to Julia Roberts with a $20 bill attached with a note from George Clooney saying, “I hear you’re getting 20 a picture now.” This was a joke in reference to Julia Roberts being the highest paid actress at $20 Million per picture at the time. Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson were offered the roles of the brothers Virgil and Turk but they dropped out to make The Royal Tenenbaums (2001). Danny Glover also turned down the role of Frank Catton. Bruce Willis was originally cast as Danny Ocean, the part Clooney plays. Don Cheadle plays a major role but is uncredited. Andy Garcia said it wasn’t easy to do a serious scene with Carl Reiner because Reiner was so funny.\n\nSteven Soderbergh wanted to shoot the film in black and white. Warner Brothers said he could do so only if he drastically reduced the cost of the film, so he changed his mind. Henry Silva and Angie Dickinson, from the original film, make cameos here. This was Silva’s final film as he retired after it. Casey Affleck and Scott Caan adlibbed some of their lines. George Clooney and the other guys would pull pranks on Julia Roberts, like leaving a request for a 5am wakeup call on days when she didn’t need to be on the set until Noon / 12:00pm. Julia Roberts filmed all her scenes in two weeks. Jon Favreau was offered a chance to write the screenplay but turned it down. Alan Arkin was cast as Saul Bloom but dropped out for personal reasons. Don Rickles was also an early choice to play Saul Bloom. Johnny Depp was considered for the role of Linus Caldwell, the part Matt Damon plays.\n\nRated: [PG–13] – Some Language & Sexual Content\n\nAvailable on Blu–ray, DVD & Digital Copy"
