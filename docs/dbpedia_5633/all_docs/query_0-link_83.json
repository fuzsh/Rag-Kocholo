        "text": "The Pacific Ocean is the biggest ocean of the world and covers more than 30% of the Earth's surface.\n\nThe name 'Pacific' come from the Latin word 'pacificus' which means peaceful. Thus, Pacific Ocean means 'peaceful ocean'. However, the Pacific is not really calm and peaceful. The 'ring of fire' is located in the Pacific Ocean. There is a string of volcanoes in the Pacific basin which are still active and therefore many of the world's major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen in this region.\n\nThe lowest known point on earth is called Challenger Deep. It is located in the Pacific Ocean near Guam in the Philippine Sea at the end of the Mariana Trench. The depth recorded is 10,920 metres or 35,827 feet.\n\nThe Atlantic is the second biggest ocean in the world and is between the continents of America and Europe and Africa.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean is about half the size of the Pacific Ocean and covers roughly 20% of the Earth's surface. However it is growing in size as it is spreading along the Mid-Atlantic Coasts.\n\nSharks, such as this Thresher Shark swimming in the gulf stream, are found in the waters of the Atlantic.\n\nDid you know that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the longest mountain range on Earth? It spreads from Iceland to Antarctica beneath the Atlantic.\n\nThe Indian Ocean is located between Africa and Austral-Asia. The waters of the Indian Ocean provides the largest breeding grounds of the world for humpback whales.\n\nAlso found in the Indian ocean, a fish which was thought to be extinct was discovered there. The Coelacanth is found in the warm waters off the Comoro islands between Mozambique and Madagascar.\n\nThe Northern Indian Ocean also is the most important transport route for oil as it connects the oil-rich countries of the Middle East Each with Asia. Every day tankers are carrying a cargo of 17 million barrels of crude oil from the Persian Gulf on its waters.\n\nThe Southern Ocean is located around the South Pole across the Antarctic circle in the Southern Hemisphere off Antarctica.\n\nThe Southern Ocean is the home of Emperor Penguins and Wandering Albatrosses. Icebergs will be encountered in the Southern Ocean during any season, but during May to October there are also strong winds which make crossing the ocean even more dangerous.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean is located around the North Pole across the Arctic circle. There are many polar bears living on the Arctic ice. The Arctic Ocean derives its name from the word 'arktos' which means 'bear' in Greek.\n\nA jellyfish with the funny name 'Lion's Mane Jellyfish' can also be found in the Arctic Ocean's waters. It grows up to 2.4m or 8 feet across and lives on plankton and fishes. Did you know that the Arctic Ocean's ice covers are shrinking by 8% every ten years?\n\nMany Arctic ground features are named after early Arctic explorers, like Nansen Basin or Mendeleyev Ridge.\n\nAntarctica\n\nAntarctica is a desert - but it's not hot, it's really, really cold. It's called a desert because it hardly ever rains.\n\nThe South Pole is near the middle of Antarctica. That's the very bottom of the planet. In parts of Antarctica the winter temperature can be minus 60°C.\n\nNobody lives in Antarctica permanently. Some scientists stay there to work and carry out research. They may spend months indoors in the research stations. When the weather gets bad, they are cut-off from the rest of the world.\n\nLet's Explore - Antarctic BBC Teach - Go Jetters Antarctica Seven Worlds One Planet - Antarctica BBC Science and Nature: Revealing the extraordinary wildlife stories and unseen wilderness of our seven unique continents.\n\nEurope\n\nThis collection of Funky Facts from Go Jetters includes information about some of Europe’s significant landmarks.\n\nSome are built masterpieces such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, and the canal system supporting the wonderful architecture of the car-free City of Venice, Italy; others are awe-inspiring natural wonders such as the the Matterhorn mountain with it's near-symmetrical pyramidal peak or the dramatic Mount Etna volcano on the island of Sicily, Italy and the natural light show of the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights, visible from more northerly latitudes of the world such as Lapland in Finland.\n\nThen there's the beautiful colour of the tulip fields of the Netherlands, that can be seen from space when in full bloom!\n\nGo Jetters - The Continent of Europe Seven Worlds One Planet - Europe BBC Science and Nature: Revealing the extraordinary wildlife stories and unseen wilderness of our seven unique continents. Let's Explore - Europe\n\nNorth America\n\nHuge cities with skyscrapers, crowds and man-made landscapes might be what comes to mind when you think of North America.\n\nThis collection of Facts from Go Jetters focuses on North America, a continent found entirely within the northern hemisphere.\n\nIn these clips, we explore iconic landmarks within the United States (US), one of North America’s larger countries.\n\nWe are introduced to the iconic Statue of Liberty, built on Liberty Island in New York harbour as a symbol of welcome, the Everglades National Park in Florida with it's vast network of wetlands, and we find out some facts about this city’s famed green space known as Central Park.\n\nWe also visit Hollywood in California were movies have been made for over 100 years, the stunning waterfalls of Niagara Falls in Canada and an iconic landmark in the US carved out by the power of nature and the Colorado River: the magnificent Grand Canyon.\n\nBBC Teach - Go Jetters North America Seven Worlds One Planet - North America BBC Science and Nature: Revealing the extraordinary wildlife stories and unseen wilderness of our seven unique continents.

Oceania is home to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the natural wonders of the world, and home to lots of ocean wildlife.\n\nThis collection of Facts from Go Jetters focuses on Oceania, a continent made up of the large island country of Australia, often called a continent by itself, and other Pacific Islands.\n\nThis scattered continent is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the north, east and south; the Southern Ocean to the south and the Indian Ocean to the west. Like all other continents, Oceania has wonders to explore on land and sea.\n\nAustralia is home to unusual, native animals like Kangaroos and Koalas, and to the Great Barrier Reef. This system of reefs is one of the largest eco-systems on Earth and can be seen from space.\n\nBBC Bitesize - Let's explore Australia's Northern Territory BBC Teach - Go Jetters The Continent of Oceania Seven Worlds One Planet - Australia BBC Science and Nature: Revealing the extraordinary wildlife stories and unseen wilderness of our seven unique continents.
