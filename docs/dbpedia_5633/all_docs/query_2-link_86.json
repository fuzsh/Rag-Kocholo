        "text": "Continued from here. Written after three viewings.\n\nIt would be pointless to deny that my heart thrills when I see Richard Armitage’s face for the first time on the big screen. And I do think many of his scenes achieve precisely the comic effect the script intended them to have. But may I be permitted to state that my favorite scene in this film does not involve Armitage? (I promise to come back to him, though, if you’ll walk through a few scenes with me.)\n\nI’ll set the stage: as Debbie (Sandra Bullock) and Lou (Cate Blanchett) consider candidates for the “fence,” they fall upon Tammy (Sarah Paulson) as the solution. The film cuts to an exterior shot of her huge, clunky, boxy, style-free suburban home. Then the moment: We see Tammy standing at her perfect black quartz countertop with a food processor, making a smoothie. Not any smoothie, but a healthy one with kale and blueberries and wheat grass and who knows what other on-trend food fad ingredients. Behind her, a little boy, her son, is kicking a ball back and forth through an empty dining room with a picture window behind it, despite a request for him to stop.\n\nThis is the moment: finally, the phone rings, and Tammy’s grab for it is desperate, as if she’s grabbing for a life preserver to save her from the vacuousness of her current existence. The scene develops from there, following Debbie’s entrance, as we learn that Tammy has stockpiled huge numbers of household appliances in her garage, attributing it to an eBay habit.\n\nThe film doesn’t fill in the back story, but I think many of us can guess it. How many of us know a woman in very nearly in this position? Someone who’s excellent at her job and then for very good reasons turns homemaking into her job and lives a life of quiet, albeit precisely governed, desperation? How many of us have been in this position ourselves?\n\n[Note that I’m not deriding homemaking as a profession here — just noting that not everyone finds it as fulfilling as the lifestyle magazines tell us it should be.]\n\nThis my second favorite moment in the film:\n\nNine-Ball (Rihanna) needs to find a way into the computers at McCallister Security, so that she can gradually re-orient the streaming cameras in front of the ladies’ bathrooms in the Met to create a blind spot. To do so, she locates a project supervisor at the company (Paul Damanian, played by James Hindman), then looks at his public FB profile, to learn that he is a huge fan of wheaten terriers. She creates a stegosploit image on a fake website, and posts a link to it on his FB page. Unable to resist the cuteness of the image, he perforce clicks — and loads exactly the malware onto his (under-protected; he only has one password to the file she wants to control) machine that will let her accomplish her desired hack. He, on the other hand, leaves work smiling and whistling after having enjoyed the terrier image.\n\nDo you know anyone who hasn’t been distracted in exactly this way while working, whether in an office or at home? We do tedious or time-consuming or tiring or just complicated things that trap us at a computer screen, or we are doing something else and turn to a screen for a moment of diversion, and we need a break, and fifteen minutes later we’ve fallen down a rabbit hole of pictures of an actor? And those fifteen minutes are the highlight of the day? I don’t know anyone who’s ever done that or felt that way. [coughs]\n\nThere are numerous tiny comic or sarcastic moments like this in the film, some more obvious than others: Eaddy Kiernan, who is actually Anna Wintour’s assistant and plays herself in the film, corrects Tammy as to the correct pronunciation of “gala.” Standing before the real Vogue office’s wall of shoes, Tammy alerts Eaddy to the lack of a nutritional specialist at the catering firm, and convinces her to switch companies to safeguard the food sensitivities of 20 percent of her guests. Cate Blanchett scrupulously disinfects her hands before administering an emetic to Daphne Kluger’s (Anne Hathaway) soup. Asked about her inspiration for Daphne’s style, Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter) is speechless — because she can’t say “diamond theft” (G-d, what a metaphor). Confused as to what Claude’s motivation for a jewel theft could be, insurance investigator James Frazier (James Corden) asks why he would steal anything when he has “two of these things” — gesturing frantically at some odd striking modern art in Claude’s apartment. Constance (Awkwafina) meticulously supervises the construction of a Subway sandwich.\n\nIf I had to come up with one theme that unifies so many of these comic moments, it’s “motivation” — and I would summarize the motivations as waxing between love and desperation (and sometimes a combination of these). The film is poking huge fun at the big and little things that we use to get through our lives every day, both at the projects we commit our lives to (the Met Gala, the fashion industry) and the coping mechanisms that allow us to escape. This is why I was mystified by the BBC review: this film doesn’t take fashion very seriously at all — in fact, it’s the opposite of serious. The star’s dress at the ball is created by a has-been designer whose idea of high fashion is flight attendants’ uniforms and who’s only got the job because of her personal friendship with Wintour. One of the more charming things about the film, in fact, is that all of these high-level fashion professionals are appearing in an ironic picture of their premiere annual event. The “con” is just as much the complicated game everyone at the Gala is playing as it is a jewel heist.\n\nAs evidence for this reading of the film, take another one of its more hilarious moments: Tammy is interviewing for the job as assistant to the Met Gala with Eaddy, and Eaddy reminds Anna Wintour that she wanted to interview the assistant as well. Ms. Wintour, however, tells Eaddy to take care of it — because she is way too occupied watching a tennis match on the Internet to care about who’s running her premiere event of the year. The fabled Anna Wintour — superdiva, whose single word can swing markets — would rather be watching tennis.\n\nWhat motivates people to act? Their desires, their loves, their vanities, their moments of quiet desperation — all of which are tied up together. Everyone is foolish when they are chasing the things they love or the activities that give their lives meaning. Everyone takes stupid risks. And the winners in the film — the ladies who profit from the huge jewel heist — are the ones who take the biggest risks. They win not only because they are good at what they do, because they are living their best lives even while they are executing a crime, but also because they know when to let go to cruise the PCH or have dinner at the Eiffel Tower or buy a loft so big you can skateboard in it — or like Tammy, you have realized what you really need to do is go back to work. If the film is feminist, it’s because of this: because you see eight women with unfettered access to their own emotional energies, which drive their desires and activities. In contrast, Claude ends up in jail because his best life is only derivative — because he collects art rather than making it, because his publicists make his decisions, because he can’t take responsibility, and in the end, because starf*cking does take primacy over actual sex.\n\nWhat we love is often silly. What we value is often fake. The causes we give our lives to are sometimes so obviously meretricious that all we can do is laugh. But what matters is not the symbol, whether perfect smoothies or wheaten terriers or the perfect vegan soup. It’s the purity of energy with which we pursue those loves — which makes us human, and lets us live real lives in the midst of the many illegal and legal “cons” that occupy our time."
