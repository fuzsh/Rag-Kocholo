However, when I type in the terminal, if the language is ru or ua, not one symbol is typed in, nothing is typed in. Again, if I ls files in directory, ua and ru letters are not displayed, en are. Unicode is also not displayed. Fonts issue?\n\nI use Arch with Suckless Terminal, however this issue applies to dmenu and to xterm too.\n\nSolved. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Locale#Setting_the_system_locale\n\nIt just happens that I had not configured system locale. I checked the output of locale command - LANG='C', then, according to the wiki:\n\nlocalectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\nlogged out and logged in (restarted the session)\n\nRead the wiki for more detail.\n\nanswered Mar 6, 2020 at 11:32\n\nAndrewAndrew\n\n5111 silver badge44 bronze badges"
