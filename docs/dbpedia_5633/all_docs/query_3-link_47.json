The community focuses on 'Mission Oriented Research and Innovation' to carry out research and intervention-based learning projects that address a common mission: reducing plastic pollution on the Basque-Aquitaine coastline.\n\nThis language policy plays an important role in enabling participants to assert their linguistic identities without invading others, on the contrary enriching one another with the multilingual experience.\n\nThe multilingual and inter-cultural dimension is transversally incorporated in all of Ocean i3 activities. It is supported by an expert research team that observes and assists based on a 'language use awareness' approach and activates communication resources that go beyond language. It works in laboratory mode to define guidelines adapted to the complexity of the project (inter-institutional, inter-cultural, multilingual, international) in order to transfer them to other Bordeaux-Euskampus Campus projects.\n\nThe DREAM research group, in collaboration with Euskampus, has drafted a tentative Language Policy for the Ocean i3 community , which aims to help maintain the communityâ€™s linguistic diversity, explaining the main reasons for its implementation. It constitutes a protocol to preserve and promote inter-culturality and multilingualism in the Ocean i3 cross-border community.\n\nSuch a language policy fosters the use of the four languages (Basque, French, Spanish and English) and provides participants with a set of ground rules to help them decide which language to use at any given time, give everyone the opportunity to express themselves in the language of their choice and activate the entire community to build the collective meaning. Moreover, this language policy plays an important role in enabling participants to assert their linguistic identities without encroaching on those of others, but rather mutually enriching each other.\n\nTherefore, the main objectives of this language policy are to:"
