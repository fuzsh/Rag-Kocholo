There is no full nudity in these scenes. There are also some mild verbal sex references, as well as sight of cards advertising the services of escorts.\n\nnudity\n\nNudity is implied when cards are seen advertising escorts. No clear nudity is shown, although a woman is seen covering her breasts with her hands.\n\nalcohol and smoking\n\nAdult characters drink alcohol.\n\nlanguage\n\nThere is infrequent strong language ('f**k').\n\nsex\n\nModerate sex references include the discovery of a bag filled with what are described as 'fliers for hookers', featuring images of a woman covering her bare breasts with her hands.\n\nThere are some scenes of mild violence in which men trade punches with one another."
