        "text": "When i first saw trailers for Oceans 11 i was amazed that they could get a cast like that into a film. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon are among Hollywood's elite and the lesser known actors such as Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, and Casey Affleck have made big impressions in other films that they appeared in. Whenever big hollywood actors are in a movie i always want to see if they're actually making a good movie or if they're just putting them together to make a profit and a bad film. Then i heard that Steven Soderbiergh was directing. By that time i was hooked because he directed one of my favorite films; Traffic. After all that time of waiting last night was the night. Opening Night with about 12 of my friends and a semi-packed theatre. After viewing the film i have to say my verdict is......\n\nWHAT A DAMN FUN, ENTERTAINING, and CLEVER FILM. Words can't describe how much i loved it. These actors weren't in it just to make a profit they were in it to make a memorable film. I don't want to give any of the plot away because it's just too good but i will tell you what i liked and some things i didn't like about the film.\n\nWhat I Liked:\n\nGeorge Clooney and Brad Pitt are the embodiment of charisma. I'm a straight male but there is no denying that these guys possess a lot of style and charm. Not to mention talent. I've always enjoyed George Clooney as an actor and with each film he does he becomes an even better actor. i've always been a fan of Brad Pitt as well. He's just seems like an everyday guy in his films. Very natural and laid back. He's truly at home in this role.\n\nThe supporting cast is uniformily good. To see Julia Roberts in a supporting role was odd at first but even in the few scenes she's in you can't deny that the girl has talent. Her scenes with Clooney are priceless. The dialouge in these scenes are suitably sassy and snappy. Don Cheadle and Bernie Mac making a lasting impression as well. Don Cheadle is becoming one of my favorite actors and Mac is obviously on his way with this film and his own hit TV show. Matt Damon is good in his role and his chemistry with Clooney during the last act provides us with some truly entertaining and hilarious moments. Andy Garcia makes for a truly suave villian in the film. I haven't seen him in much lately which is quite a shame because he's a wonderful actor. Scott caan and Casey Affleck are a dynamic duo. They provide some of the most hilarious moments in the film and it's because of their off-beat chemistry.\n\nSoderbergh is a wonderful filmmaker. He has an obvious love of films and this aids him in making good movies. He knows all the tricks of the trade and he uses them throughout the film. Subtle things are also down through the use of music. Images fly over a hip soundtrack that give the film an edge. This is especially certain during the final few scenes. Soderbergh is probably one of the best directors of our generation.\n\nVegas is a pretty interesting back-drop for everything that goes on. Vegas is basically another character in the film and through Soderbergh's work on the film he gives it a life of its own.\n\nThe final half of the film is outstanding. So much is going on yet the story flows at a nice pace so we know what is exactly going on.\n\nWhat I didn't Like:\n\nI tihnk i only disliked one thing about this film. Some of the dialouge was a bit cheesy but what film doesn't have that. My major gripe in the film was Julia's lack of screentime. She's good in the scenes that she's in but because her character isn't well developed you don't really care about her plight. If julia wasn't playing her however i don't know if any other actress could make you almost care with the screentime that she possesses.\n\nIt's rare that i dislike one thing about a film. Ocean's 11 has already made it's way into my top twenty and it's most definitely the best film i've seen this year. Very nice work\n\n9/10\n\nAn enjoyable enough crime story from golden child Steven Soderbergh, perhaps not achieving classic status but still very amiable to sit through. This remake has many things in its favour, not least in Soderbergh's direction; this is a man with the power to turn the most mundane plot events into fairly gripping, watchable drama. His film looks and feels good, reaching a classy level far above anything most Hollywood directors these days have the capability of achieving. The plot, it has to be said, is fairly clich√©d and predictable, but there are one or two surprising twists and a witty script gives to some fine interplay between the characters. Of course, it goes without saying that the star-studded cast is the main reason to sit through this film and enjoy it.\n\nGeorge Clooney heads the bill as Danny Ocean, a suave and snappily-dressed criminal who devises the perfect robbery. The more I see of Clooney, the more I like him; in fact he may be one of the only stars in Hollywood today to recall the charm and charisma of the old school actors like Cary Grant and Clark Gable. Combining dashing looks with strong acting methods, Clooney is a real gem of an actor and it's astonishing that he began in television when his forte is so obviously the cinema. Not that I want to sound sycophantic, but Clooney is one of the good guys. His foil is none other than Andy Garcia, who seems to have been off our screens for a decade, so who now looks suddenly a heck of a lot older than he used to. Garcia crafts a cold, cold character for his casino owner, Terry Benedict, combining smoothness with menace with barely uttering a word.\n\nBrad Pitt has a supporting role as Clooney's accomplice and is, well, Brad Pitt. He doesn't have a lot to do but he seems to be enjoying himself. Julia Roberts is the conventional love interest but I have already expressed my dislike of the actress elsewhere so I'll leave it at that. With so much of the screen time devoted to many different characters and actions, not many of the other actors get much of a look in and instead appear to be along for the ride, adding \"name value\" to the poster. Matt Damon barely registers as the young, smart pickpocket; Casey Afflect and Scott Caan provide dubious comic relief; Elliott Gould has aged in an astonishing way so this distracts from his acting. Congratulations to Carl Reiner, putting in a tour-de-force acting performance in a very small part. Watch out for Joshua Jackson as a card shark and Don Cheadle, whose character appears to have been influenced by Dick Van Dyke in MARY POPPINS. OCEAN'S ELEVEN is a pure popcorn movie, but at least it credits the audience with some taste, intelligence, and refinery, unlike most big bucks blockbusters these days.\n\nI imagine that followers of the legend of the Clan would find it unforgivable that George Clooney remade the ultimate Rat Pack film Ocean's 11. But I think even Frank, Dean, and Sammy would be happy with what Clooney and director Steven Soderbergh did with it. It's nothing less than a crackerjack caper film with a few stars to gaze at also.\n\nThe point in the original is that this was a film almost made as a lark for the participants while the main players were appearing at the legendary Sands Resort in Las Vegas. These were old army ranger buddies who decide to put their training to use and heist five casinos.\n\nClooney and buddy Brad Pitt's film has them in the Frank and Dean roles and they're a much more professional outfit who are only doing one of them. But it's the one Andy Garcia owns and Clooney has a score to settle with him. He's taken Clooney's wife away played here ever so briefly by Julia Roberts. In the original Angie Dickinson had the part. And it was also a brief part.\n\nClooney and Pitt go out and recruit a crack team, some they know, some they don't. But it's a professional job and close run thing.\n\nGarcia is in a part the equivalent of George Raft from the original. It was business for Raft and business for Cesar Romero the syndicate guy he hires to find them. But Garcia's a nasty character who settles his own accounts.\n\nThe film has got a whole lot of nice touches stylistically and cast is expensive and first rate. For those familiar with the original the irony of that ending is replaced by something completely different. More in keeping with George Clooney than Frank Sinatra.\n\nNevertheless I think the Chairman of the Board would like this Ocean's Eleven."
