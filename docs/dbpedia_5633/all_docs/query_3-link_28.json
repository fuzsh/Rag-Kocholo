        "text": "Do not translate the names of contemporary figures. Unlike in Catalan, this includes the names of contemporary royalty. For example:\n\nKing Juan Carlos [not King John Charles]\n\nHowever, do use the English translation of the papal names of popes. Examples:\n\nPope John Paul II\n\nPope Benedict XVI\n\nAdditionally, respect the original spellings of names written in the Latin alphabet, including any accents or other reasonably reproducible diacritical marks. Examples:\n\nAki Kurismäki\n\nJulio Cortázar\n\nFor names written in other alphabets, use standard transliterations. Examples:\n\nMohamed El Baradei\n\nKarolos Papoulias\n\nRemember, different languages use different transliteration systems. For instance, the surname of the current Supreme Leader of Iran is spelled Jameini in Spanish, Chamenei in German, and Khameini in English and Catalan. It is thus important to double-check any transliterations used in the source text.\n\n+ Return to top\n\nWhile in the past some foreign media outlets have traditionally referred to Catalans by the Spanish-language versions of their names, that practice is increasingly rare. In texts for the UOC, neither Catalan nor Spanish names should be translated; rather, people should be referred to by whatever name they use themselves. Examples:\n\nPau [not Pablo] Casals\n\nJoan Manuel [not Juan Manuel] Serrat\n\nPlease note that, to prevent confusion, in English texts it can be helpful to write out the Catalan and Spanish abbreviations M. and Mª in full as Maria.\n\n+ Return to top\n\nLikewise, translate the names of major geographical features (mountains, rivers, gulfs, islands, straits, etc.) with traditional English translations. Examples:\n\nthe Danube River/the River Danube\n\nthe Canary Islands\n\nLeave the names of major geographical features without standard translations in the source language. However, translate any generic words used in their names (e.g. river, mount), capitalizing them in accordance with English conventions. Examples:\n\nthe Besòs River/the River Besòs\n\nthe Prades Mountains\n\nSimilarly, unless a traditional English translation exists, do not translate the names of minor or local geographical features. Instead, translate only the generic words used in their names (e.g. stream, pond, ravine), capitalizing them accordingly, and leave the name itself in the source language. Examples:\n\nLake Banyoles\n\nTerradets Ravine\n\nExceptions are made for generic words that have come to form a part of the proper name itself, which should be left in the source language. Examples:\n\nthe Sierra Nevada\n\nRío Grande\n\n+ Return to top\n\nAs a general rule, street names should not be translated. This is especially true of street names (and other items) in postal addresses. Nevertheless, particularly in running text, you may consider writing all words in an address in full to facilitate comprehension by non-native speakers. Example:\n\nCarrer (instead of C.)\n\nPassatge (instead of Ptge.)\n\nFor international addresses, the country should be written in both English and the language of the destination country. Examples:\n\nEspaña/Spain\n\nSuomi/Finland\n\nUnlike in Catalan, it is unusual to translate the generic part of a foreign street name in English, even when it appears in running text. Thus, write:\n\nAvinguda Diagonal is one of the city's main thoroughfares [not Diagonal Avenue…].\n\n+ Return to top\n\nTranslate the names of towns and cities with traditional English translations. Examples:\n\nVienna\n\nHavana\n\nMexico City\n\nLeave all other such names in the source language. Examples:\n\nBuenos Aires\n\nSort\n\nUltramort\n\nFor references to towns and cities in Catalonia that do not have traditional English translations, use the Catalan (rather than Spanish) version of the name. Examples:\n\nLleida [not Lérida]\n\nGirona [not Gerona]\n\nRemember, because they are often spelled differently in different languages, it is important to double-check all place names in the source text, particularly transliterated ones, in case they need to be translated or otherwise changed to conform to English-language conventions.\n\n+ Return to top\n\nDo not translate acronyms or initialisms unless an alternative version is commonly used in English. Thus, OCDE (Organització per a la Cooperació i el Desenvolupament Econòmics) should be rendered as OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) in English, but PSC (Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya) should not be rendered as SPC (Socialist Party of Catalonia).\n\nAs a general rule, when conserving a foreign acronym or initialism, translate the full name from which it is derived on first mention, followed by the acronym to be used thereafter in brackets. Example:\n\nthe Catalan University and Research Grant Management Agency (AGAUR)\n\n+ Return to top\n\nDo not translate the titles of books, periodicals, and other publications that do not have official translations. Instead, where necessary to ensure comprehension of a text, include a translation of the title in brackets on first mention. Examples:\n\nEcoUniversitat\n\nAnàlisi. Quaderns de Cultura\n\nManuel de Pedrolo's Mecanoscrit del segon origen (Typescript of the Second Origen)\n\nWhere an official English-language version does exist, use the English title; however, be sure to specify which version and/or edition was being referred to in the original text when that information is germane. Examples:\n\nRuiz Zafón's The Shadow of the Wind\n\nQuim Monzó's The Enormity of the Tragedy\n\n+ Return to top\n\nTranslate the names of congresses, exhibitions and other events when they consist of common, translatable words. Where applicable, use the official English translation. Example:\n\nthe 8th International Conference on Internet Law & Politics (IDP 2012)\n\nDo not translate the names of such events when they consist of an untranslatable proper noun. Examples:\n\nAntiQuaris\n\nExpoHogar\n\nNotwithstanding the above, when an untranslatable name is derived from a series of translatable words or used as shorthand for a longer, translatable version of the event's name, consider providing a translation of the words on which it is based or the longer version of the name on first mention for added clarity. Example:\n\nExpodidàctica, the Educational Resources and Technology Exhibition\n\n+ Return to top\n\nTranslate the names of higher and/or international bodies and organizations with clear equivalents or official translations in English. Examples:\n\nMinistry of Education\n\nInternational Federation of Association Football\n\nNote, however, that the names of local and regional bodies with no traditional translation or clear equivalent in English should not be translated. In such cases, provide a brief literal or descriptive translation, as appropriate, in brackets on first mention and use the original term or a generic reference thereafter. Examples:\n\nvegueria (an obsolete Catalan territorial and administrative division)\n\nloyajirga (a traditional 'grand council' held to resolve important national matters)\n\n+ Return to top\n\nDo not translate the names of institutions commonly known by their original names. Examples:\n\nthe Duma [not the Deliberation]\n\nthe Knesset [not the Assembly]\n\nHowever, for clarity's sake, you may refer to them with common-noun equivalents instead either from the first mention on or, if you have defined the foreign term on first mention, for all subsequent mentions. Examples:\n\nthe lower house of the Russian parliament\n\nthe Israeli parliament\n\nWith regard to the translation of Generalitat, the UOC recommends using Government of Catalonia.\n\n+ Return to top\n\nAs a general rule, avoid using Latin terms where an acceptable English equivalent exists, particularly in texts intended for a general audience. For instance, unless you are working with a text about logical reasoning, rather than retaining a posteriori, consider using in retrospect, in hindsight or subsequently, as appropriate; rather than retaining a priori, consider in theory or beforehand; rather than retaining inter alia, consider using among others; etc. Notwithstanding this rule, it is not necessary to avoid Latin terms that are in common use in English, such as e.g., sic or vice versa, or that are conventionally used in a particular discipline or field.\n\n+ Return to top\n\nTranslate the names of universities, unless otherwise specified by the university itself. Where available and reasonably idiomatic, use the university's own preferred translation. Examples:\n\nthe University of Barcelona (UB)\n\nPompeu Fabra University (UPF)\n\nWhen referring specifically to the UOC, use the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) on first mention, and the UOC thereafter. Example:\n\nFrom the start, the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) has been committed to the social inclusion of people with disabilities. […] To further this commitment and ensure accessibility, the UOC has created the Strategic Accessibility Committee.\n\nUse the definite article the only with the names of universities beginning with the word university or a non-proper adjective (e.g. open, technical). The word the can usually be safely omitted with universities whose names begin with a proper noun. Examples:\n\nThe University of Massachusetts\n\nThe Open University\n\nYale University\n\nRice University\n\nRemember that many (but not all) universities in English-speaking countries omit the definite article before their initialism, even when it is used when the name is written in full. Examples:\n\nUMASS\n\nUCLA\n\nbut the OU\n\nWhen in doubt, check the university's own website.\n\n+ Return to top\n\nTranslate the titles of works of art unless there is no clear equivalent in English or they are traditionally known by their titles in another language. Examples:\n\nThe Scream\n\nThe Starry Night\n\nThe Garden of Earthly Delights\n\nbut Las Meninas, Goya's Caprichos\n\nWhen a text includes both types of titles, try to be as consistent as possible.\n\n+ Return to top"
