        "text": "Located 3,958 miles from Hawaii in an isolated archipelago called the Mariana Islands, the island of Guam is the first place that sun touches U.S. soil every morning. Considering Guam is located so far from the U.S. mainland, you might wonder things like:\n\nWhat is it like to live on Guam?\n\nFind out in our Guam Insider’s Guide!\n\nWhat kind of things are there to do on Guam?\n\nRead up on Guam activities and attractions.\n\nWho were the original inhabitants of Guam?\n\nDiscover more aboutthe CHamoru people.\n\nDo people on Guam speak English?\n\nKeep reading!\n\nIn this article, we’ll answer that final question and give you a tour of the most common languages spoken on Guam. By taking a peek into the languages you’ll hear spoken on Guam, you’ll also get a glimpse into the different ethnic groups you’ll encounter on the island. If you’re considering a move to Guam, these insights will give you a sense of what life on the island might be like for you—and how you can prepare for a smooth transition to Guam.\n\nWhat’s the Official Language of Guam?\n\nThe island of Guam has two official languages:\n\nEnglish\n\nChamorro—the language of Guam’s original inhabitants\n\nNote:\n\nYou’ll also see Chamorro written as “,”a spelling that’s more true to the language itself, which doesn’t use the double R or the letter C. In 2017, this spelling was officially adopted by the Kumision I Fino’ CHamoru (Chamorro Language Commission).\n\nHowever, the two official languages of Guam don’t tell the full story of Guam’s long history—or the numerous ethnic groups who have made their home in Guam over the years.\n\nThe island was claimed by Spain in 1565, ceded to the U.S. in 1898 as a result of the Spanish-American War, and occupied by the Japanese during World War II. All of these events significantly impacted the Chamorro language. We’ll dive into that in the next section.\n\nAdditionally, due to immigrants from the Philippines, Asia, and other Pacific Islands, there are many languages besides English and Chamorro spoken in homes across the island.\n\nIn fact, when you look at census data, you’ll begin to get a glimpse of the diverse ethnic backgrounds of the people of Guam. Let’s take a closer look at the numbers.\n\nWhat Languages Are Spoken in Guam?\n\nBecause Guam is a U.S. territory, you might expect that English would be the most widespread language spoken at home. However, U.S. Census Bureau data shows that a majority of the population speaks a language other than English at home:\n\n0%\n\nspeak only English at home\n\n0%\n\nspeak another language at home\n\nWithin that “other language” category, you’ll find quite a range. Of those who speak a language other than English at home:\n\n0%\n\nspeak Chamorro\n\n0%\n\nPhilippine language\n\n0%\n\ndifferent island language\n\n0%\n\nan Asian language\n\n0%\n\ndifferent language\n\nBy the way, if you’re curious how the Census Bureau defines Philippine, Pacific Island, and Asian languages:\n\nPhilippine languages include Tagalog, Bikol, Bisayan, Sebuano, Ilocano, Pampangan, and Pangasinan.\n\nPacific Island languages include Carolinian, Chamorro, Chuukese, Hawaiian, Indonesian, Malay, Palau, Ponapean, Samoan, Tongan, other Micronesian languages, and other Polynesian languages.\n\nAsian languages include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, languages of Southeast Asia such as Vietnamese and Thai, Dravidian languages of India, such as Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu, and the Turkic languages.iii\n\nAs you can see from the numbers, Guam has a significant population who trace their roots to the Philippines. In fact, Filipinos are the second-largest ethnic group on Guam, making up about 24.5% of the population. The only population larger is those who identify as Chamorro—40.3% of Guam residents.iv\n\nThe people of the Philippines share a number of commonalities with the people of Guam. Both places were colonized by the Spanish, and it’s believed that both also share common ancient ancestors. However, it was the large influx of Filipino workers in the wake of World War II that gave Filipinos a significant foothold on Guam.v\n\nNow that you have a better sense of the diversity of languages spoken on Guam, let’s take a closer look at the Chamorro language. We’ll also throw in a few common Chamorro phrases you’ll likely hear on the island.\n\nA Deeper Look at Chamorro, the Language of Guam’s Original Inhabitants\n\nEven though it’s one of Guam’s official languages, only a minority of Guam’s residents speak Chamorro at home—an estimated 17.8%.vi Additionally, very few of those estimated 25,827 Chamorro speakers were under the age of 18—only 2,394.vii\n\nThese numbers have left many concerned for the future of the Chamorro language on Guam. One potential solution can be found at P.C. Lujan Elementary in Barrigada. The school is the first publicly funded Chamorro immersion school. Although its program is still in the pilot phase, the project’s leaders hope to expand the program and teach Chamorro to a new generation of students on Guam.\n\nThe language has long suffered over the length of Guam’s history. Guam spent many years under Spanish rule, and Spanish became the common language on the island. Today, as much as 55% of the Chamorro vocabulary borrows from Spanish.viii Furthermore, Chamorro was banned under U.S. Naval rule in 1917, with harsh consequences for those who violated the rule.ix As a result, the number of Chamorro speakers declined significantly. During the Japanese occupation, students were taught Japanese.x\n\nHowever, today, you’ll still hear Chamorro spoken on Guam. (And, hopefully, the number of Chamorro speakers will continue to grow!) To get you started with some basic Chamorro, we put together a quick list of a few commonly used phrases, with pronunciations courtesy of wikitravel.org:\n\nHåfa adai!\n\n(Hah-fah day)\n\nHello!\n\nHåfa tatatmanu hao?\n\n(Hah-fuh tah-taht-mah-noo how)\n\nHow are you?\n\nSi Yu’os ma’åse’\n\n(C dzu-oohs muh-ah c)\n\nThank you\n\nBuen probechu\n\n(Bwen pro-bet-sue)\n\nYou're welcome\n\nGuahu si ____\n\n(Gwah-hu c ____)\n\nMy name is _____\n\nAdios\n\n(Ah-dee-oss)\n\nGoodbye\n\nYou’ll probably hear the first phrase in this group—Håfa adai!—all over the island. If there’s one phrase to practice before you arrive on Guam, that’s it! Get comfortable with it now so you can deliver it with confidence from the first time someone greets you on Guam.\n\nWhat to Expect When You’re Moving to Guam\n\nNow that you know a little about the languages on Guam, as well as the culture and ethnic groups you’ll encounter on the island, you’ve got a better sense of what to expect if you’re headed to Guam.
