        "text": "The summer movie calendar continues to sizzle with the release of Friday's \"Ocean's 8.\"\n\nA spin-off of \"Ocean's Eleven\" trilogy that starred George Clooney and Brad Pitt, \"Ocean's 8\" features an all-female, all-star cast, led by Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett.\n\nAlready, box office predictions suggest we could see more of this team in the future. \"Ocean's 8\" is tracking to make between $30 million to $45 million and likely will dethrone \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" at the box office.\n\nBefore you buy your ticket, here are eight things you need to know about \"Ocean's 8.\"\n\n1. Sandra Bullock plays Debbie Ocean, Danny Ocean's estranged sister who is just released from prison and wants to pull off a huge heist at the Met Gala in New York City. What's the take? A necklace worth more than $150 million.\n\n2. An \"Ocean's\"-style movie was something Mindy Kaling always dreamed of working on. In her 2011 book, \"Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?,\" the \"A Wrinkle in Time\" star wrote that she wanted to do a reboot called \"Ocean's 5\" with an all-female cast. Dreams can come true!\n\n3. Pop singer/rapper/icon Rihanna also stars, and yes, she requested that her character, hacker Nine Ball, wear locs. \"We thought it would be strong,\" Rihanna's hairstylist Yusef Williams said in an interview with Refinery 29. \"She wasn't just going to some American girl in this movie. Ball is still a Caribbean girl that just happens to be in America.\"\n\n4. No, the stars didn't hate one another. In an interview with People magazine, Bullock acknowledged tabloid rumors about the cast being at one another's throats. \"The opposite was true,\" Bullock said. \"A lot of film was wasted on laughing fits that usually resulted in makeup having to be redone and a little snot being removed.\"\n\n5. If Bullock is the Clooney of this film and Blanchett is the Brad Pitt-type best friend, then Anne Hathaway is the Andy Garcia rich-type from whom the crew wants to steal. Hathaway told Entertainment Weekly she had fun poking at the selfish Daphne who works \"so hard to be refined and sophisticated, but she just clearly isn't that.\"\n\n6. Like the other \"Ocean's\" films, this one will be fun. Screenwriter Olivia Milch told Vulture that she was ready to bring this group of actresses onscreen together. \"They are legends,\" Milch said. \"We were just so excited to have the fun and the delight of seeing women steal s*** and see them be badass criminals. That was very much the standard.\"\n\n7. Expect a few cameos, including Matt Damon, Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner, who all appeared in the previous \"Ocean's\" trilogy. Who knows maybe even Pitt, Clooney and Julia Roberts will appear, too?\n\n8. The group text the cast had is now dead. Bullock told USA Today that after months of interviews, the cast disbanded the group text chain. \"We had a little funeral for it,\" Bullock said. \"We all got very paranoid about being hacked. It was time to say goodbye.\" To which all we can say is, \"See what you monsters are doing\" and \"Honestly, we'd pay to see a movie of these women just texting each other stuff. Really.\"\n\n'OCEAN'S 8'\n\nSTARRING: Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Awkwafina, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter and James Corden\n\nDIRECTOR: Gary Ross\n\nNOW SHOWING: At AMC Baton Rouge 16, AMC Mall of Louisiana 15, Celebrity Theatres Baton Rouge 10, Cinemark Perkins Rowe and XD, Movie Tavern Citiplace, Malco Gonzales Cinema, Movie Tavern Juban Crossing (Denham Springs), The Grand 14 (Lafayette) and Celebrity Theatres Broussard 10 (Lafayette)."
