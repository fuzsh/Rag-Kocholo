A man climbs along a metal rigging around a display in a museum to avoid security sensors.\n\n► A woman gags and runs through a crowded gala to a bathroom where we hear her vomiting violently (we hear splattering and gagging). A woman gags several times and runs off-screen. A woman eats Nutella from a jar and seems to be crying, with mascara streaming down her face. A woman cracks her neck twisting it side-to-side. We hear that a woman was bitten by \"chiggers\" and that they burrow under the skin and lay their eggs before re-emerging when they hatch. We see a screen that shows the inside of a sewer pipe as a camera passes through it (we see brown goo and matter). A woman takes chewing gum out of her mouth and holds it on her finger in a few scenes.\n\nSUBSTANCE USE - A woman smokes a large marijuana cigarette in an apartment and another woman seems alarmed, a woman holds a large marijuana cigarette while watching computer screens, a woman squeezes a liquid onto a serving of soup and another woman eats the soup (please see the Violence/Gore category for more details), and two young men talk about smoking something (presumably a drug).

Just go to our search page or use the search bar, with or without a keyword, from the top navigation menu. Move sliders from 0-10 in any combination, check and uncheck MPAA ratings and use keywords to further filter results -- please let us know what you think.\n\nTHE ASSIGNED NUMBERS\n\nUnlike the MPAA we do not assign one inscrutable rating based on age but 3 objective ratings for SEX/NUDITY, VIOLENCE/GORE & LANGUAGE on a scale of 0 to 10, from lowest to highest depending on quantity & context |more|"
