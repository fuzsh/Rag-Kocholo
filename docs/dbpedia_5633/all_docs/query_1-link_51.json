        "text": "I'd say you are correct about the placement of the generic word being the reason for using (or not using) 'the' , and all your examples are phrased correctly. Notice that 'Falls' is different also in that it is a plural.\n\nEdit: I have found the answer:\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nIn English, nouns must in most cases be preceded by an article that specifies the presence or absence of definiteness of the noun. The definite article is the in all cases other than generic references, which use the zero article (i.e., the absence of an article), while indefiniteness is expressed with a or an for singular nouns or the zero article for plural or non-count nouns.\n\nFrom Monmouth University:\n\nThe definite article 'the' is used before both singular and plural nouns when the noun is specific. The names of geographic places are specific names and may require definite articles: names of rivers, oceans, seas, geographical areas, deserts, forests, gulfs, peninsulas, groups of lakes (the Great Lakes), mountain ranges, and chains of islands.\n\nNo article is necessary before the following specific nouns: Singular names of countries or territories, cities, towns, states, streets, lakes, bays, mountains, continents, islands, languages, sports, academic subjects.\n\nThe use of definite articles with names for inanimate objects in English should be understood on a case-by-case basis. There is, as far as I know, no principled reason behind the distribution of definite articles.\n\nHere is what Hawthorne and Manley (2012) say on the subject:\n\nin English there are various situations where names in subject position require articles. Thus, when modifying names with adjectives we almost always add articles: ‘A/The bleary-eyed Bill Clinton emerged’, ‘Now the incredibly agile Jordan is weaving through his opponents’....\n\nEven unmodified singular names are often prefixed by the definite article, such as names for rivers and newspapers.... Moreover, no deep distinction divides names that are prefixed by the article and those that are not. Names for oceans typically have an article, while names for lakes typically do not; in California, numerical names for highways have them (‘take the 405’), while on the east coast they do not (‘take 287’). One might object that, for example, in ‘the Thames’ the article is somehow fused into the name and no longer functions as a determiner. But note that the article gets distanced from the name when adjectives are added: ‘the mighty Thames’, ‘the vast Pacific’, ‘the notorious Wall Street Journal’ and so on.\n\nHawthorne and Manley, The Reference Book (2012).\n\nFrom this passage, we observe:\n\nName for rivers typically have articles (\"the Thames\", \"the Nile\", \"the Niagara River\").\n\nNames for oceans typically have articles (\"the Atlantic\", \"the Indian Ocean\").\n\nNames for lakes typically don't (\"Lake Erie\", \"Lake Michigan\").\n\nIn California, names for highways have articles (\"take the 405\").\n\nOn the east coast, names for highways don't have them (\"take 287\").\n\nNames for newspapers typically have articles (\"the Wall Street Journal\", \"the New York Times\").\n\nWe might add:\n\nLike oceans, seas also have articles (\"the Mediterranean Sea\", \"the Black Sea\").\n\nWaterfalls typically don't have articles (\"Niagara Falls\", \"Victoria Falls\")\n\nCanyons sometimes have articles, but sometimes don't (\"the Grand Canyon\", \"Colca Canyon\")\n\nYou can make similar observations about names for bridges, buildings, squares, publications, etc.\n\nWhy names for some types of geological features and artifactual entities seem to require the definite article while others don't is an open question. There may be no principled reason.\n\nI'd say you are correct about the placement of the generic word being the reason for using (or not using) 'the', and all your examples are phrased correctly. Notice that 'Falls' is different also in that it is a plural.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nAn article is a word that is used alongside a noun (…) to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, and in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope. The articles in English grammar are the and a/an, and in certain contexts some. \"An\" and \"a\" are modern forms of the Old English \"an\", which in Anglian dialects was the number \"one\" (compare \"on\" in Saxon dialects) and survived into Modern Scots as the number \"owan\". Both \"on\" (respelled \"one\" by the Norman language) and \"an\" survived into Modern English, with \"one\" used as the number and \"an\" (\"a\", before nouns that begin with a consonant sound) as an indefinite article. […]\n\nThe definite article is used to refer to a particular member of a group or class. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned or it may be something uniquely specified.\n\nHowever, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to lexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.\n\nFrom Monmouth University:\n\nThe definite article 'the' is used before both singular and plural nouns when the noun is specific. The names of geographic places are specific names and may require definite articles: names of rivers, oceans, seas, geographical areas, deserts, forests, gulfs, peninsulas, groups of lakes (the Great Lakes), mountain ranges, and chains of islands.\n\nNo article is necessary before the following specific nouns: Singular names of countries or territories, cities, towns, states, streets, lakes, bays, mountains, continents, islands, languages, sports, academic subjects."
