        "text": "Last year, I wrote about how I can only watch scary movies if I’ve looked up the entire plot beforehand. I’ve started doing this with other movies, too. Rom-coms, action movies, anything where there's a villain or danger or even a miscommunication that causes tension between two people for more than a single scene. I absorb anxiety, and if even for a second it seems like things aren’t going to be okay for someone I want them to be okay for, everything tenses up for me until it resolves. Which may not be for hours. Or ever.\n\nI didn’t have to Google what happens in Ocean’s 8. It induces no anxiety. It’s a glitzy puzzle with no consequences. And it’s exactly what I want a movie to be.\n\nOcean’s 8 begins with Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) getting out of jail, where she’s been hanging out for the past five years, planning her next heist. Her brother, Danny Ocean (George Clooney of the most recent Ocean’s run), is dead, but she’s carrying on the family legacy, which is apparently stealing lots of money with very attractive people. This time, the heist involves stealing a very valuable Cartier necklace from the Met Gala.\n\nBullock goes about getting the band back together, in the first of many montages. The Brad Pitt to her Clooney is Cate Blanchett, who may have more suits than lines, but those suits are fabulous, and clearly she still has a lot of vamping to get out of her system post–Thor: Ragnarok. The mark is Anne Hathaway, who is truly spectacular as a self-centered actress who is savvier than she looks. Each team member gets a brief backstory, but not enough that you seriously worry about any consequences on their lives. There’s no fretting over Sarah Paulson’s kids, or Rihanna’s sister, or Mindy Kaling’s stereotypically overbearing Indian mother. Whether they succeed or fail, nothing bad is actually going to happen.\n\nIt’s not like they don’t try to set up stakes. We find out Ocean is a Wronged Woman seeking redemption. There are a few moments where the team runs into snags. But, as in Clooney’s Ocean’s Eleven, they’re quickly overcome with witty banter, some form of deus ex machina, and some corny close-ups of Cartier jewels. And I mean quickly. The film, at just under two hours, runs at a clip considering the number of moving parts that need to come together to make the heist happen. There are moments you wish they breathed a little more into the characters’ relationships with each other (a scene with Awkwafina teaching Mindy Kaling Tinder comes to mind), but the point of an Ocean’s movie is getting the job done.\n\nOn a recent episode of NPR’s Pop Culture Happy Hour, co-host Glen Weldon noted how easy it was to laugh at the references in Deadpool 2, even though they weren’t actually jokes. I think the same part of your brain lights up when you figure out a plan in a heist movie. The idea of the heist being “good” or “realistic” doesn’t even play into it. You’re too busy being like, “AHHH LOOK WHAT THEY DID!” It’s like watching a Rube Goldberg machine—nothing matters except how satisfying it is when it comes to an end. And it’s really satisfying!\n\nOne of the best parts of the movie came just after, when I walked out and realized...there was no love story. Ocean’s Eleven was all about Clooney winning back Julia Roberts, as if she were property that could be easily impressed and reclaimed instead of a human woman who left Danny Ocean for a reason. (I mean, the movie wrote her as the former, but a girl can dream.) Here, there’s only a glimmer of a love interest—existing enough to act against but not enough to become emotionally invested in. He’s not a source of drama or yearning. He’s a tool.\n\nIf you liked Ocean’s Eleven, you’ll like Ocean’s 8. It’s got the glamorous setting, the quips, the moment where you figure everything else out, an Ocean in a tuxedo with an undone bow tie. Does it matter that the team is all women? I think so. Not in that you learn that women are capable of pulling off a heist—like Ocean’s Eleven, the film is in no way realistic—but that women are the center of such a distinctly masculine genre. And while Ocean’s Eleven doesn’t make any mention of the team being all men, Ocean’s 8 explicitly notes that their plan requires it to be all women. Their womanhood is not only acknowledged but necessary. Growing up, I knew plenty of girls who wanted to emulate Brad Pitt, not in gender necessarily but in attitude. Maybe after Ocean's 8, some boys will want to emulate Cate Blanchett."
