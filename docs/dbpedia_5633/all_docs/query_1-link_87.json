If they use the big F Word twice, the movie will become a 15 cert.\n\nPoochJD\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nAug 28, 2000\n\nMessages\n\n11,017\n\nReaction score\n\n1,850\n\nPoints\n\n2,592\n\nLocation\n\nNorwich\n\nJan 8, 2009\n\n#3\n\nHi,\n\nAccording to the BBFC:\n\nOcean's Twelve (Cinema Version)\n\n- Contains one audible and some bleeped uses of strong language\n\n- No cuts or alterations made (by the BBFC).\n\nOcean's Twelve (Vides/DVD Version)\n\n- Contains one audible and some bleeped uses of strong language\n\n- No cuts or alterations made (by the BBFC) from the original cinema version.\n\nOther than that, there doesn't appear to be any further information about censorship to this movie. I suspect, therefore, that the bleeped uses of strong language were undertaken in the USA by the movie's distributors, so that it would be acceptable for a US \"PG-13\" rating, and a UK \"12\" rating. They clearly wanted the strong language to be understood, but not heard, so that youngsters and parents didn't get upset.\n\nI should mention I've not seen the film, so can't comment on when or how the bleeps are used in it.\n\nPooch\n\nMrE26\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\nOct 15, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n239\n\nReaction score\n\n28\n\nPoints\n\n29\n\nAge\n\n48\n\nLocation\n\nNewcastle\n\nJan 8, 2009\n\n#4\n\nI don't recall the scene in question (tried to block the film out of my memory!) but i'd imagine it was filmed that way. I can't see any filmmakers allowing their movies to be censored by bleeps. Possibly a bleeped tv/movie scene in the film (if that makes sense!)\n\nGalacticaActual\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 1, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n7,064\n\nReaction score\n\n597\n\nPoints\n\n1,423\n\nAge\n\n48\n\nLocation\n\nGalactica C.I.C.\n\nJan 12, 2009\n\n#5\n\nPretty sure it was actually filmed liked that to begin with.\n\nelicash73\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\nJul 6, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n819\n\nReaction score\n\n37\n\nPoints\n\n152\n\nAge\n\n40\n\nGreg Hook\n\nModerator & Reviewer\n\nJoined\n\nNov 25, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n30,203\n\nReaction score\n\n21,923\n\nPoints\n\n8,521\n\nLocation\n\nIn a secret location with Florence Pugh\n\nJan 17, 2009\n\n#7\n\nJust watched this tonight and the scene in question definitely appears to have been filmed that way and the bleeping is part of the joke. In fact Don 'English accent supremo' Cheadle even mentions the bleeping.\n\nJoined\n\nMar 10, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n24,404\n\nReaction score\n\n6,491\n\nPoints\n\n4,698\n\nLocation\n\nSomewhere being wrong but staying strong\n\nJan 18, 2009\n\n#8\n\nYep thats definitely the whole point (some might argue that Mr Cheadles accent is the bigger joke )\n\nOceans 12 was my fave out of the lot. Love the fact it feels like a European film rather than a Hollywood film......infact easily the most stylish film in the last decade."
