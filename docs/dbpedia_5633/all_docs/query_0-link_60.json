        "text": "Is anyone in the film industry busier than Margot Robbie? The star of Barbie and producer of Saltburn, Emerald Fennell’s barnstorming follow-up to Promising Young Woman, now has yet another project in the works, one that she is both financing and performing in: a fresh take on Ocean’s Eleven. Best of all, though, it’ll feature her reuniting with Barbie’s Ken – Ryan Gosling himself.\n\nOn 19 May 2022, The Hollywood Reporter broke the story that the two-time Oscar nominee will take the lead in the latest addition to the Warner Brothers heist franchise, with the news following that she’d be joined by the Canadian heartthrob. Jay Roach, who collaborated with the former on 2019’s Bombshell, will helm the romp, and Carrie Solomon is penning the script. Further details are under wraps, though the publication did reveal that the film will be “an original Ocean’s Eleven that is set in Europe in the 1960s”.\n\nThe chosen time period suggests there may be nods to Ocean’s 11, too – the 1960 Las Vegas-set Rat Pack classic spearheaded by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr that inspired Steven Soderbergh’s slick trilogy. The latter’s ensemble cast – which included George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Andy García and Al Pacino – was ridiculously stacked, and so was that of its 2018 spin-off Ocean’s 8, the frothy comedy that saw Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling, Awkwafina, Helena Bonham Carter and Sarah Paulson storm the Met Gala in pursuit of a priceless necklace.\n\nSo, which other A-listers will make up Robbie’s team this time around? Where on the continent will their mission take them? And what casino, hotel or glittering soirée will be their target? It may be some time yet before we find out – but for now, let the fantasy casting commence."
