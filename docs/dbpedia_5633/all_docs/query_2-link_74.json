prime candidates to hang around in the GPGP.\"\n\nOther \"thin\" plastic, such as bags and straws, tends to disintegrate and sink to the sea bed.\n\nClaim: Plastic straws only account for 0.03% of ocean plastic\n\nMr Tabrizi says in the film that a global campaign to ban the use of plastic straws \"was like trying to save the Amazon rainforest and stop logging by boycotting toothpicks\".\n\nThe statistic - 0.03% of ocean plastic is straws - is sourced to two studies highlighted in the film, one led by Jenna Jambeck, at the University of Georgia, and another by two Australian scientists Denise Hardesty and Chris Wilcox.\n\nProf Jambeck's 2015 study provides a global estimate on the \"mass of land-based plastic entering the ocean\".\n\nAnd the other study is an estimate of the amount of straws on coastlines around the world.\n\nIt appears a calculation has been done using these findings.\n\nThe 0.03% figure was also referenced in a Bloomberg Opinion piece in 2018.\n\nThis is very much an estimate, and Prof Jambeck said no-one really knows how much of it is straws, but experts agree that it is certainly a lot less than dumped fishing gear.\n\nProf Hardesty does not think that straws are a bigger issue than lost fishing gear, but the risks posed by nets are clearly a major issue.\n\n\"Abandoned, lost, derelict fishing gear poses substantial environmental harm to coastal and marine species,\" she says, \"and we know far more about entanglement risk than we do about ingestion risk (of other objects) to wildlife\".\n\nClaim: Micro-organisms absorb four times more CO2 than the Amazon\n\nThis claim is about the important role the oceans play combating global warming.\n\nMicroscopic organisms in the ocean called phytoplankton absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, just like plants.\n\nThe documentary refers to an IMF report that says \"we calculate that this is equivalent to the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) captured by 1.70 trillion trees - four Amazon forests' worth\".\n\nExperts say that the figure is about right, and could even be an under-estimate.\n\n\"It's fair to say that over the global ocean, phytoplankton absorb about four times as much carbon dioxide as the Amazon does,\" says Dr BB Cael, a scientist at National Oceanography Centre in Southampton.\n\nAnd Dr Cael says oceans can store carbon for a long time.\n\n\"A portion of the carbon absorbed by phytoplankton sinks into the deep, and stays there for hundreds to thousands of years until the ocean slowly brings it back up to the surface.\n\n\"A much smaller amount of the carbon taken up by trees is sequestered from the atmosphere for that long,\" says Dr Cael.\n\n\"This will definitely impact the model of carbon flows,\" said Oregon State University microbiologist Steve Giovannoni.\n\nAnother study published in 2020 looked into what's called the \"biological pump\" - when plankton die they fall to the deep ocean, removing carbon from the surface and storing it.\n\n\"If the deep oceans didn't store so much carbon, the Earth would be even warmer than it is today,\" wrote its author Ken Buesseler.\n\n\"We estimate that the biological pump carries twice as much heat-trapping carbon down from the surface ocean than previously thought,\" said Mr Buesseler.\n\nRead more from Reality Check"
