It might connect with small land masses to create a series of islands like the Pacific Islands. Or, it might connect with one of the seven continents. Where the ocean meets land, you have a beach. Not only are those beaches filled with creatures, but you can find other fun ocean landforms and words, such as:\n\ncliff - rock face\n\ncoast - the edge of a land mass where it meets the sea\n\ncoastal - along the coast or near the coast\n\ncoastline - the outline of a coast\n\ncontinental shelf - shallow seabed near a land mass\n\ndriftwood - wood that floats in the ocean or has been washed ashore\n\nebb tide - period between high tide and low tide when water flows away from the shore\n\nforeshore - shore closest to the water\n\nhigh tide - when the tide has come the farthest in it will come\n\ninland - areas of land away from the coast\n\ninshore - in towards the shore\n\nlow tide - when the tide is the farthest out it will go\n\nonshore - on land\n\nPacific Islands - islands in the Pacific Ocean including Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia\n\nseashell - any shell found on the beach\n\nsea spray - aerosol particles of sea water, mostly from the movement of waves\n\nshore - the coast\n\nshoreline - line where the sea meets the land\n\ntidal wave - large, irregular wave\n\nwave - rolling motion in the surface of water\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDifferent Words for Ocean Ships and Boats\n\nSince you can’t walk on water, you have to navigate the ocean somehow. Thankfully, there are all kinds of fun ocean vehicles you can come across. Just a few of the boats or ships you might encounter in an ocean include:\n\nbarge - large, flat boat used for carrying freight\n\ncontainer ship - ship carrying cargo stored in containers\n\ncruise ship - large ship carrying travel passengers; a floating hotel\n\nfishing boats - crafts used in fishing\n\nsailboats - watercraft propelled by sails\n\nsubmarine - boat that submerges and travels fully underwater\n\ntanker - ship that carries liquid cargo in bulk tanks\n\ntrawler - boat used for trawling (net fishing)\n\nyacht - large pleasure watercraft\n\nUnique Ocean Words\n\nThe ocean is full of unique and interesting things, from the saltwater itself to the creatures found above and below the surface. Considering much of the ocean is undiscovered, it kind of makes you want to dive right in and explore it. Thankfully, you can. Right from the comfort of your own home through ocean and sea examples. Then, you can explore other bodies of water, like ponds and lakes."
