        "text": "Imagine, ten years ago, hearing about an upcoming Steven Soderbergh crime-comedy trilogy. You'd lose your shit, right? We didn't know how lucky we were with the Ocean's trilogy, and now that it's on Netflix, it's time to revisit (or watch for the first time!) this weird, wonderful anomaly.\n\nFor the inexplicably uninitiated, Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven is an ensemble remake of a 1960 heist movie that did insane numbers, thanks in part to a cast comprising of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle (rocking a delightfully needless Cockney accent) and Brad Pitt. Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen shortly followed thereafter, despite the middle edition's lukewarm response.\n\nBut there's a reason the arthouse-inclined Soderbergh kept returning to the story of Danny Ocean and his misfit crew (other than, y'know, the dumpsters full of cash Warner Bros. left on his doorstep). Throughout the series and all its convoluted, ridiculous plotting, a sense of fun and a firm hand in the director's chair helped the trilogy never slip into too familiar a rhythm. Even if you think you've seen it all, every vault robbery, every casino heist, the movies find their ways to surprise you.\n\nOf course, they are also inherently shaky bastions of early-to-mid-2000s filmmaking. There are all kinds of ridiculous pieces of criminal tech, and Ocean's Thirteen (2007) features a charmingly laughable subplot about hacking servers or something. Even worse, try as he might, Soderbergh can't seem to shake half his cast out of their \"I'm just here to cash a check\" stupor. Taken for what they are, though, the Ocean's movies still hold up as minor, frivolous curiosities much more in the vein of a good heist caper than, say, Rat Race. We may even owe it to Ocean's Twelve, the most maligned and overcomplicated in the series, a reconsideration. That this dumb, fun series lasted three whole movies is a feat in itself, let alone the impending all-female spinoff (which we are psyched for).\n\nThe Ocean's movies might not be relevant masterpieces, or anywhere near as great as Soderbergh's newer comedy heist film from last year, Logan Lucky, but they are endlessly watchable, and they are on Netflix. That's good enough."
