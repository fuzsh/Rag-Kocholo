        "text": "The island nation of the Bahamas is known for its unique dialect of British English called Bahamian English or Bahamian Creole, which is mutually intelligible with standard English.\n\nHow Many Languages Are Spoken in the Bahamas?\n\nThere are two primary languages spoken in the Bahamas: Bahamian Creole or Bahamian English, which is spoken by most people, and Haitian Creole, which is spoken by about 25% of the population. One is an English-based Creole language and the other is a French-based Creole language.\n\nOfficial Languages of the Bahamas\n\nThe official language of the Bahamas is English. In the 1700s, British settlers arrived on the island and it became a British protectorate which introduced the English language. British English is used in the Bahamas for government, mass media, education, and business transactions.\n\nMost people in the Bahamas speak a unique dialect of English called Bahamian English. Bahamian English mixes British English with African influences and the island dialect.\n\nThe following is an example of Bahamian English from Susan Wallace's \"Islan' Life:\" \"Islan' life ain' no fun less ya treat errybody\n\nlike ya brudder, ya sister, or ya frien' Love ya neighbour, play ya part, jes' remember das de art, For when ocean fen' ya in, all is kin.\"\n\nOther Languages of the Bahamas\n\nMany people in the Bahamas speak Bahamian Creole, an English Creole language that combines British English with other native languages and dialects and is sometimes called Bahamianese. There are more than 400,000 native speakers of Bahamian Creole which has similarities to other Creole languages of other islands in the Caribbean."
