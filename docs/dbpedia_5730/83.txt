A sea fury is a "custom variation on the sea hag", created by Matthew Mercer.[2]

A sea hag which grows more powerful than and massacres the others of its coven may become a sea fury. Driven to madness by power and loneliness, a sea fury hoards treasure, spreads rumors, and aims to lure adventurers to its lair. By doing so, the sea fury hopes to alleviate its loneliness for a time, before killing its playthings when they have outlived their usefulness.[3]

Description[]

Abilities[]

Multiattack: The sea fury makes two attacks with its claws.

Death Glare: The sea fury targets one frightened creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom save or drop to 0 hit points.

Known sea furies[]

Dashilla the Dreadful: The only known sea fury at the time of this writing. Dashilla occupies her lair, the Diver's Grave, which lies at the bottom of the Lucidian Ocean, southwest of Bisaft Isle.

History[]

"The Diver's Grave" (2x44)[]

The Mighty Nein encountered Dashilla while exploring the Diver's Grave in search of a Cloven Crystal;[4] the sea fury was able to escape with her life and hide in the depths of her lair.[5]

The Nein then found a pile of merrow bodies[6] and discovered the pedestal in her central lair had runes that lit up when they absorbed a sufficient quantity of blood.[7]

Trivia[]

The sea fury's Death Glare ability is similar to the Death Gaze of a bodak.
