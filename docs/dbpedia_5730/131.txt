Dreadnought

Super Sea Fury Racer

by Bernhard Schrock

Hobbycraft's 1/48 scale Sea Fury is available online from Squadron

Description

This time I present my next Racer. This is a highly modified Sea Fury with the name Dreadnought.

The plane was fitted with the powerful R-4360 Corncob-engine from P&W, housed in a longer nose and a 4 blade prop from a Skyraider with big spinner. A higher tailplane and a second air inlet in the wing root completed the modification.

I started with the 1/48 kit scale kit from Hobbycraft and combined it with the conversion kit from Maintrack Models.

I added landing gear legs in white metal from Aeroclub and wheels from True Details. The wheel plates are scratchbuilt from 0,15 mm plastic. I also refined the tail gear.

The most challenging aspect was the decals. I painted the plane's name with black ink on a decal film and sealed it with liquid decal film from Microscale. All other markings are spares, airbrushed or hand painted.
