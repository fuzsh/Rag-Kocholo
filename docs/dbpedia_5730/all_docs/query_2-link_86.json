        "text": "History of Rodanthe\n\nLocated on Hatteras Island in the southern Outer Banks, Rodanthe is a small, historic town that was once part of an area known as \"Chicamacomico,\" which also included Waves and Salvo. No one is quite sure why the name \"Rodanthe\" was chosen to designate the area formerly known as North Chicamacomico, but the name itself originates from Greece and means \"rose bud.\" Regardless, Rodanthe has become synonymous with watersports, including kiteboarding and surfing, and the abundance of natural wildlife and undeveloped sands of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.\n\nThe towns' location near the easternmost point in North Carolina (Cape Lookout), made it the perfect place for the Chicamacomico Life-Saving Station. Chicamacomico was the first of seven Lift-Saving Stations built in North Carolina by the U.S. Life-Saving Service in 1874. The US Life-Saving Service would eventually become part of the U.S. Coast Guard which still maintains a station nearby at Oregon Inlet today. The 1918 Mirlo rescue by the men at Chicamacomico is still considered one of the most important rescues in the Coast Guard's history during which 42 sailors were saved during a German U-Boat attack.\n\nAbout the Famous Nights in Rodanthe House\n\nThe most famous home in Rodanthe is undoubtedly the Inn at Rodanthe, a single-family home that was used to film exterior shots for the movie adaptation of Nicholas Spark's Nights in Rodanthe. The movie stars Richard Gere and Diane Lane and explores their relationship and romance on the island.\n\nDuring the movie's filming, many locals of the Outer Banks appeared as extras on screen. In January of 2010, the home, which was previously known as Serendeipity, was in danger of being destroyed due to coastal erosion and was eventually moved to new site by the same company that moved the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse.\n\nYou can find out more about the book the film is based on in our Outer Banks Books Guide.\n\nThings to Do in Rodanthe, NC\n\nThere are so many exciting things to do on this tiny stretch of land between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pamlico Sound.
