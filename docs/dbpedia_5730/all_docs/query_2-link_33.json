        "text": "HOLLYWOOD\n\nIn the movie, “Fury“, U. S. Army Sgt. Don “Wardaddy” Collier (Brad Pitt) commands a tank with a five-man crew in the storied 66th Armored Regiment in the 2nd Armored Division, as it is invading the heart of Germany in April 1945 – just days before the Nazi surrender.\n\nTrivia question: What kind of tank is Pitt commanding?\n\nIn the movie, it was a Sherman M4A3E8, more commonly known as an “Easy Eight”.\n\nIf the movie was based on a real character – and supposedly it is not – Collier would not have been driving an Easy Eight. And he wouldn’t have been fighting a German Tiger TI – but we digress.\n\nIn the film, since a point is made in the movie that Collier loves his tank, and he and the crew have named it “Fury” – the name they’ve painted on its 76 mm gun barrel. Supposedly, they’ve all been fighting together – in Fury – since the North Africa campaign in 1942. If that was so, Fury would have probably been a much earlier model M4 Sherman, like an M2 or M4A3, each of which went into production in 1942. But with a 50 percent casualty rate in most mid-WWII tank battles, an earlier M2 or M4 model that survived 3+ years of combat would have been unheard of. (In fact, only one Sherman tank – a Canadian one – is known to have survived as long as from June 1944’s D-Day all the way to May 1945’s V-E Day.)\n\nIn real life, the Easy Eight, equipped with its 76 mm gun, was a relatively late addition to the war effort – only in production since late 1944. The Easy Eight featured a bigger gun and a better suspension. And they were not completely at the mercy of German tanks.\n\nProduction notes mention that Fury was designed and built by Henry Ford, and the German tanks were masterminded by Ferdinand Porsche. (Ergo, it was not a fair fight!) Yeah, okay, kinda sorta. Ford Motor Company didn’t design the Sherman, but it did build them – but only 1,690 M4A3s from June 1942 to September 1943. In all, about 50,000 were built for the war – and the vast majority of Shermans were built by General Motors and Chrysler.\n\nThe comparatively rare Ford-built Shermans were equipped with Ford’s 450-horsepower, 18-liter GAA V8 engine – originally a V12 knock-off of Rolls-Royce Merlin and Allison aviation engines that were supposed to be used in American planes. When the Navy turned the Ford V12 down – because they decided to use radial engines – Ford lopped off four cylinders and converted it into a tank engine.\n\nI believe the tank used in the movie had a Ford engine, but it was not a battle-scared M4 from the North Africa campaign.\n\nSo why use (possibly) the wrong tank in a movie that insisted so much on realism and authenticity (okay, other than the men’s haircuts)? Probably because there aren’t many surviving WWII tanks available to today’s filmmakers.\n\nThe American tanks in the movie – ten were used – were all M4A3E8s and all came from the Bovington Tank Museum in southern England (if you go, “Fury” is the one with serial # T224875) where the movie was principally filmed.\n\nThat’s also where the filmmakers got the movie’s nearly indestructible German Tiger I tank (a.k.a. “Panzers”) – a relic that was out of production by 1945. But the one at the tank museum is reputed to be the only surviving Tiger 131 tank still in working order.\n\nThe Tiger was a feared fighting machine, but among the criticisms leveled at it was that it was heavy, cumbersome and over-engineered – you know, just like today’s German cars! (Just kidding. Sort of.) America’s Shermans, to their credit, were considered manueverable, reliable and quick on the draw (like a gunfighter – another relevant comparison).\n\nBut, the point is – regardless of some of the plot disconnects in Fury – by that time in World War II, Germany had far superior tanks (albeit fewer of them), and could blow most of the American tanks to smithereens. Earlier in the war, it was a much more even fight; but the Germans continued to improve their tanks, while the Americans stupidly did little in that regard. And the tank crews, like those in Fury, paid a terrible price.\n\nJerry Garrett\n\nNovember 1, 2014\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nIt would be better to tell if side by side with a Firefly for instance, but I believe the tank in the photo IS a US M4/76 but NOT from ww2, after ww2.\n\nI may be wrong, I’m doing this on the fly 3am after marking papers all night.\n\nHere’s why.\n\n1. Muzzle break. To my recollection and quick perusal at the pc, all my videos, photos, blue-prints of them during ww2 have NO muzzle breaks, the feature at the end of the barrel designed to help reduce recoil force and muzzle flash.\n\n2. Barrel length. The Firefly barrel was significantly longer. Indeed the Firefly hull was slightly longer, a little more front armour and the turret shorter and smaller to make a smaller target.\n\n3. The commander cupola mg. Designated for anti-aircraft purposes, the priority target for any infantry let alone sniper the entire torso let alone head of the tank commander itself, the Allies had all but complete air superiority since D-Day and I’ve seen no photos etc of these with these mgs except in the Korean and Israeli wars.\n\n4. The hull gun. Like the Firefly, this had been removed to make space for the shells in ww2, only after ww2 do I see any examples of this.\n\nThe Germans had in fact solved their reliability problems by the end of the war. When the Tigers first came out in 1942 vs Leningrad and the Panthers in 1943 at Kursk most were crippled by breakdowns and difficult repairs, however by the end of the war that was more a US and Russian failing.\n\nThe Sherman was a maintanence dream, pathetic design, but even the entire engine could be replaced in Europe or Asia not sent back to factory.\n\nHowever, the US heavy, M6a2 was disastrous, too late in ww2 to face any panzer, their reliability problems extended years through the Korean war in fact, 7 years. Where the US Shermans had to face off with Russian T34s instead.\n\nEven then American commanders would disobey orders to request Brit/Cdn tank support instead, even the last version of Churchill the Black Knight could deal with coasts and inclines US tanks couldn’t. The Brits had finally learned their lessons from their ww2 Churchills and Challengers, the end war Centurion(also too late to face panzers) would be the world’s choice for over 15 years(especially Israel).\n\nBut you make another excellent point, Tiger production had ceased in 1943, replaced by Tiger IIs(King or Konigstigers), though the vast majority of German armour faced the final year were tank destroyers like the Jpz even Sturmgeschutz conversions assault guns. Zhukov(Russia’s greatest tank general) blamed the SGIII alone for destroying 3 T34/85s even JsIIs for every SG lost in the Battle of Berlin.\n\nIt is pure nonsense to claim that a US M4/76 of any shell at the time would reliably take out the front armour of even a Tiger I let alone Tiger II at 1000 m. The ONLY tank the Germans feared at that range was the Brit/Cdn/Pol Firefly, which could give it out but unlike the German Panther, Tiger, Tiger II, Jpz, Jagdpather worse Jagdtiger couldn’t take it. That’s total unhistorical nonsense and why I understand why few of the veterans of groups I’ve asked are interested in seeing the movie except maybe on video, and those that already have very disappointed.\n\nIt dishonours them to lie about such things, the greater heroism and valour is their going into battle knowing they are in inferior equipment.\n\nAlso Pitt would never be a tanker. Even when I was a teenager, slim 5’9/174cm I couldn’t fit into let alone operate either the T34 or Shermans etc, only this inoperable Tiger we got to see in France back in the 70s. They had height restrictions, I don’t think I can remember a single ww2 tanker from any nation i’ve ever met let alone interviewed who would’ve been taller than 5’5/164cm.\n\nAs for Tigers. I’ve seen documentaries on 2 Tiger restoration projects, one in the UK the other in the US, with rumours of another in France and I will believe the claims of one in Russia when I see a modern video of it, otherwise no. I wonder what happened to the 3 Henschel versions used in Kelly’s Heroes, owned by private collector if I recall correctly, otherwise movies get by with putting Tiger turrets on other chassis and worse.\n\nMovies have always lied about their historical accuracy. I remember us purchasing the editors version of the Battle of the Bulge and historian commentary claiming use of actual tanks from the actual battle, balderdash. They used American training M6s as King Tigers, despite the models shown the German generals actual King Tigers, and M3 Chaffees as M4 Shermans. Historians can understand faking stuff, but claiming to be so authentic when not is worse.\n\nSad thing is, we’re all sure we’ve seen a post-Normandy Sherman in some show someplace with the 76 long gun, but we’re getting old and mental. Sure hope it wasn’t Bovington, they’ve been great to us in the past insisting on hosting our conventions.\n\nIt bothers the veterans themselves the most you know, they take it as if we’re disrespecting them or their memory, even if the uniforms or insignia are wrong, let alone weaponry and equipment, locations or especially events. With so much real valour, why do you have to make stuff up?\n\nA movie I would like to see done right if they could, would be the killing of the most infamous tank killer of ww2, Waffen SS-Hauptsturmfuhrer Michael Wittman, a hated but respected foe. Just weeks after mauling an entire armoured column with just one other Tiger, he borrowed Tiger 007 with his own crew and led a squadron to counter-attack the British. In this rare occasion, the Brit gunner quoting “never before never since” did he ever hit 3 moving targets anywhere near 900 meters in 3 rapid fire shots, otherwise ‘we would’ve been toast’, near on 90 degrees to the flank of the Tigers in diamond formation. But it was an older Canadian M4 Sherman long in wait with its barrel pointing out a hole made in the stone wall, that got a shot at Wittman’s Tiger broadside opposite flank about 140m if I recall correctly, he believed he hit the engine compartment somehow, but quickly blowing the turret right off, no chance for the crew to bail. Now that’s reality and worthy of a movie, both admitting they were dead if the Germans got to turn, reverse and/or fire back.\n\nEven the Firefly crews would paint the end of their barrels blue white to try to look like a normal Sherman because the Germans rightly ‘picked on’ the Fireflies alone as a threat. Only the 17pdr Firefly(76mm) or Comet(77mm) could penetrate the front armour of a Tiger, Panther or Tiger II etc, and not regularly either, so the Germans gave orders to give all priority to their destruction. The Firefly could give it out as well as the GErmans, but they couldn’t take it back as well as the Germans, still in the pitiful Sherman hull.\n\nThe true bravery and I couldn’t do it is the Firefly commander ordering the other mates ‘Joe, George, Jean you all charge that Tiger trying to outflank and get behind him and hope I can knock him out before he knocks us out, ok? go!’ ….’you go to hell Jim, i’m going to hope he doesn’t even notice me over behind this wall’ or ‘yeah, i’ll be right behind you guys’.\n\nI’d rather those movies about real heroic events portrayed realistically and not be lied to about the ‘actual historical equipment’.\n\nBut there always those ‘catastrophic’ lucky shots, that jam a turret or penetrate a foolishly open view-port even the barrel of the target itself, though more likely a track. Hell military simulations proved that the shot the Bismark took on the Hood, first salvo, blowing it apart, was a one in a million chance, but it happens. However it is absolutely wrong to portray the Bismark as being able to blow apart any foe with any shot like that.\n\nThe American tanks in particular were called ‘ronson’ or ‘tommy burners’ because they way they designed their munitions storage they were the most likely tanks to burn up/blow up even with non-penetrating strikes. But to portray the M4/76 as a stand up threat head on to a Tiger, Panther or Tiger II, even worse at night where Germans had huge advantage in night vision, I agree, is unrealistic, unhistorical and dishonours the bravery and suffering of those veterans manning the actual tanks.\n\nYou make another excellent point about Americans upgrading. They did have the heavy M6 option, but as the Brits would buy as much of anything offered, greed prevailed, the thousands of M2s only justifiable against the ridiculous Italian and Japanese tankettes if ever, the M3s a Czech tanker once told me they thought the Americans trying to copy the T34 but only admired its speed in ‘getting away’, and the M4 the ‘tommy cookers’ instead.\n\nEven by war’s end the M6 they did put out was worse than the worst German failures and problems would not be solved even through the Korean war. At least the Brits got it right with the Centurion to the Russians dismay in Europe.\n\nBefore D-Day the Brits offered the Americans their Fireflies. All Brit, Cdn and Polish squadrons of 4 would have 1 Firefly. The Americans refused.\n\nThe Brits offered them their Hobart Funnies, their amphibious and engineering tanks that had 80% success rate at Normandy, to the US 15%, the Americans refused.\n\nEven in the Korean war when US commanders were disobeying orders requesting Brit/Cdn tank support rather than their own, the US tried to refuse, thankfully for South Korea enough US commanders disobeyed those orders.\n\nWhy? arrogance and greed maybe.\n\nThe Brits and Canucks swallowed their pride to take anything the Americans could give them, even junk, but the Yanks apparently didn’t feel the lives of their crews as important.\n\nAs many tankers, almost all, same as pilots, would tell me, EXPERIENCE is as important as training but there is no experience if your crews don’t survive.\n\nTo prove the falsehood of the claims of M4/76 capabilities vs German heavies some of the best research compilations I’ve seen are from HPS Sims.com\n\nOtherwise here.\n\nHPSSims.com\n\nor less so\n\nhttp://www.wwiiequip…-data&Itemid=61\n\nhttp://www.wwiivehic…/guns/76-mm.asp\n\nThanks to all interested in history who demand authenticity not settling for propaganda, and to those who put so much time, money and effort in restorations that we can actually see and touch parts of the past.\n\nMiller Systems WW2 Campaign\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with what you said, but the film producers certainly seem to have less of a knack for historical accuracy than they say they did.\n\nWhilst Porsche was responsible for a great many Tank designs, the tank in the film – all models of the Tiger, including both the Tiger I and Tiger II – were actually creations of the German company ‘Henschell and Son’. Porsche was actually responsible for neither the Tiger I or Tiger II ‘King Tiger’, save for a failed diesel-Electric engine for the first Tiger, and being wrongly credited for a less-produced turret for the Tiger II.\n\nIn fact, Porsche did very little besides coming up with the terrifyingly dangerous ‘Maus’ tank – which unfortunately never saw action, and only saw production in the form of one complete prototype, which was immediately destroyed by terrified Soviets, and one incomplete, turretless prototype which was fitted with the scavenged turret of the destroyed tank and stuck in a Russian museum.\n\nIn fact, whilst we’re on the topic, the claim that every Sherman Tank in the film was an E8 model is completely ludicrous. You can clearly see in the scene with the Tiger that the last Sherman to be destroyed in the fight before Fury knocks out the Tiger – I think Brad Pitt’s character referred to the commander of the tank as ‘Roy’ – is just a stock M4A3 Sherman – this is obvious by the stubby-barreled M1 75mm Medium-Velocity gun it has. All the M4A3E8 model tanks were equipped with the 76mm High Velocity gun, models M1A1C or M1A2, depending on how close to the end of the war.\n\nIt’s also kind of silly to say that it was a bad thing that American tanks were generally only improved upon where they need to be. All you need to do is look at the fact that during the war, about 1,500 combined Tiger I and Tiger II tanks were produced – compared to about 50,000 Sherman tanks. You may say ‘Oh, well, the Tiger tanks were good enough to beat those odds’. And you’d be wrong. Using the correct ammunition, a 76mm gun could sufficiently penetrate the front armor of a Tiger.\n\nA Tiger tank had 120mm of frontal armor at it’s strongest point. At 1000 meters, a Sherman tank using relatively standard late-war M93 High Velocity Armor Piercing rounds could defeat 135mm of armor.\n\nThe British Tank Hunter variant of the Sherman, the VC Firefly, with its Ordnance QF-17 pounder – the most lethal gun of the war, capable of penetrating 230mm of armor from 1km firing Armor Piercing, Fin-Discarding SABOT ammunition- was an even greater example of this. That’s sufficient to defeat the frontal armor of literally every German tank or armored vehicle in the war, with the exception of perhaps the Maus, if using lower-grade ammo.\n\nInstead of wasting money constructing overly complex tanks, the Allies just changed the minimum that they needed to get the job done, and kept churning these tanks out in overwhelming numbers.\n\nOn another note, this actually proves the movie to be blatantly inaccurate, as the first shot from Fury’s 76mm gun should’ve done to the Tiger exactly what the Tiger had done to the other Shermans, especially in those hits on the turret or side armor – unless the tank was using ammunition from significantly earlier in the war. Considering that the movie quote ‘Takes place days before Germany’s surrender’, this is unlikely. This seems strange, but then you need to consider that tank warfare often occurred at much greater than 1000 meters, and you can see why the Tiger maintained its fearsome reputation.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Hitler’s obsession with over-the-top powerful tanks was unnecessary. All they needed was a basic tank with sufficient armor and size to mount the lethal 88mm flak, or their own version of the 76mm High-Velocity gun which was mounted on the Panther – actually a more powerful gun than the 88mm flak. What they didn’t need were over-engineered, difficult to produce, slow moving tanks like the Tiger. In fact, the Panther is probably the best tank of the entire war. Fast, sufficiently armored, relatively easy to produce, and packing one hell of a punch.\n\nHope someone read my rant at least. Just a military-obsessed junior high student with a bit too much holiday time xD\n\nJerry,\n\nReally Good and interesting article,\n\n– But the Ronson lighter bit was actually pretty inaccurate.\n\nShermans of the early 1944 time frame are scarce because lots of them were scrapped after the war, modified by other countries post wwII, etc..\n\nThere aren’t a whole lot of PZ IVs or t34/76s left either, and a whole lot of those were made during WWII.\n\nThe M4 was actually an excellent tank for it’s intended role.\n\nSurvival rate for the US tank crews was significantly better than those of their German counterparts, but apparently tactics for the British while using the m4 may have lead to somewhat higher crew losses.\n\nNicholas Moran – a US army Major and tank commander (and a Wargaming employee)- researched and analyzed the performance of the M4 in battle and completely debunked the myth that the M4 was a huge fire risk and a crew killer – by using real numbers and facts (Technical information, battle reports, etc.).\n\nBy the way, both the panther and tiger were also gasoline (petrol) fueled tanks like most M4 mediums. Both of the German tanks were good tanks in their time but they were not mechanically reliable. Also of note, the type of fuel had less far, far less to do with the likelihood of a crew dying because of a fire than a fire caused by the chain reaction ignition of the propellant of the stored ammunition. The “easy 8” M4E38 tanks were used and available in fairly significant numbers late in the European theater, and they did have the wet ammunition storage that Major Moran mentions. These later M4 variants did provide for a significant part of the Allied armored force used early in the Korean war.\n\nHere is the link to Nicholas Moran’s exceptionally well done presentation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNjp_4jY8pY (well worth watching!) Enjoy!!\n\nIn addition it is notable, that the use of the term “It was known as a Ronson Lighter because it lights every time” would most likely not have been attributed to the M4 in WWII since Ronson lighters did not use the advertising slogan “lights every time” until after WWII.\n\nThe brits actually may have called an early prototype version of their Churchill crocodile flame thrower tank a Ronson because it used a ronson lighter as part of the ignition system for the flame thrower.\n\nAnother analysis which includes sections specifically addressing Belton Cooper’s (decidedly negative) book about the Sherman.\n\nhttp://knowledgeglue.com/dispelling-myths-surrounding-m4-sherman/\n\nAnd this from the perspective of a Russian tanker crewing a Sherman in WWII:\n\nhttp://knowledgeglue.com/was-the-m4-sherman-really-that-bad-a-soviet-perspective/\n\nI think this will add to the discussion above. I know you are primarily an automotive and travel writer, but I also am pretty sure you would want to accurately portray one of the better tanks of wwII, and a definite contributor in the Allied victory over the Axis powers.\n\nwell, to critize a movie supposedly full of errors, your article it is commiting the same sins…\n\n#1 “If the movie was based on a real character – and supposedly it is not – Collier would not have been driving an Easy Eight. And he wouldn’t have been fighting a German Tiger Tiger”\n\nAlthough the Brad Pitt’s character wasn’t directly based on a real person, the production team and the director himself, have stated that they got some inspiration from the history of Staff Sgt. Lafayette “Wardaddy” G. Pool and his “in the mood” M4A1 sherman tank and Audie Murphy MoH citation. The characters, their background and the combat scenes portrayed in the movie are pretty close to the actions of these soldiers in real life (including the highly critized last battle scene).\n\n#2 “Supposedly, they’ve all been fighting together – in Fury – since the North Africa campaign in 1942. If that was so, Fury would have probably been a much earlier model M4 Sherman”\n\nIn the movie it was NEVER stated that they fought in the same tank since 1942. Yes, the crew members make mention that they have been together since North Africa, but they never affirm they have had the Fury since then, they just tell how they been in combat together, even when Gordo tells their history about the falaise pocket, the actual tank is never mentioned.\n\n#3 “I believe the tank used in the movie had a Ford engine…”\n\nThe fury tank in reality is a M4A2E8 powered by the General Motors 6046 12-cylinder twin in-line engine, not the Ford GAA v8. Even the Bovington Tank Musseum presents it with that designation in its official site:\n\nhttps://tankmuseum.org/tank-nuts/tank-collection/m4-sherman-fury\n\n#4 “The American tanks in the movie – ten were used – were all M4A3E8s and all came from the Bovington Tank Museum”\n\nWRONG\n\nThere were used 5 sherman tanks, not 10, From these american tanks, just 2 were provided by Bovington Musseum, the rest were provided by diferent private collectors: a M4(105) HVSS with an M4A3(76) turret (named Matador in movie) from Jeep Sud Est, a M4A1 (76)W (named Old Phillis in movie) from Bovington Tank Musseum, a M4A2(75) (named Lucy Sue in movie) from Tay restorations, a M4A2E8(76)W (originally Ron/Harris renamed Fury for the movie) also from Bovington Tank Musseum, and a M4A4(75) (named Murder Inc) from Adrian Barrell private collection.\n\n#5 “So why use (possibly) the wrong tank in a movie that insisted so much on realism and authenticity (okay, other than the men’s haircuts)?”\n\nThe movie is already filled with a lot of historical accurate details, like proper era uniforms and equipment, realistic weapon props, realistic scenario sets, hell even the map shown before the beetfield scene was based on real ww2 U.S. Army maps; besides, the movie was plagued with a lot of references to historical events, wartime photographs, veterans testimonies and documented data that were reflected in several parts of the movie, its dissapointing that such details were missed by a lot of wehraboos, like you, when critizing this movie like sheeps “muh hollywood!”.\n\n#6 your last statement just shows your complete ignorance on the tank design doctrines of the allies and axis countries during WW2, and the whole article just makes clear you get your info from wikipedia and community opinions from WoT forums…"
