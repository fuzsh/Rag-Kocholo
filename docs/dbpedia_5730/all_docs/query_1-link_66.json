        "text": "Last week I watched and reviewed my very first Bruce Lee film, 1971’s The Big Boss, also known as Fists of Fury, also known as The Chinese Connection, all due to a naming mix-up with the U.S. distributor of Bruce Lee’s films. That first film, due to its plot involving drug trafficking, was supposed to have been titled The Chinese Connection as a nod to The French Connection, which came out the same year, but the title ended up going to this film instead, and that first film ended up with the title Fists of Fury, which was actually supposed to be the title of Bruce Lee’s second film, minus an “s”. Today, purists refer to these two films by their originally intended titles rather than by those conferred onto them by the distributor, so the film from 1971 is The Chinese Connection and the film from 1972 is Fist of Fury. Today I watched Bruce Lee’s second film as part of my effort to appreciate further the man considered by many to have been the keystone to the popularity of martial arts cinema in the West.\n\nThe film opens with a narrative title card that explains the story of the sudden death of Huo Yuanjia, a legendary Chinese martial artist famous for his victories over Russia’s champion wrestler and Japan’s bushido experts and fr helping restore pride to the Chinese people. Master Huo, shortly after forming the Jingwu School in Shanghai, had been poisoned, we learn, though it’s never been revealed who actually poisoned him or why. The film admits that the story that will follow is merely a speculative representation of the most popular theory behind Huo’s death. One of Huo’s favored pupils, Chen Zhen (Bruce Lee), returns to Shanghai following his master’s death. Broken and enraged, Chen arrives at the burial and starts clawing at the dirt hysterically until someone knocks him out with a shovel. That’s how upset he is. Chen doesn’t accept the official story, which says that Huo died of pneumonia. He vows to uncover the truth. At this time in China’s history, during the early 1900s, Japanese occupiers and other foreigners treated the Chinese as second-class citizens and referred to China as the “Sick Man of Asia.” After members of a rival Japanese bushido school show up at Huo’s funerary ceremony to provoke a fight, Chen can’t stand the indignities, so he goes to the bushido school alone. Despite Huo’s teachings that martial arts should be used for physical and mental health and not for conflict, Chen defeats everyone in the school except for the master, Mr. Suzuki (Riki Hashimoto), who is out for the day. To get revenge, Mr. Suzuki dispatches his students to attack the Jingwu School and force them to hand Chen over. Chen’s friends at the school want him to leave Shanghai rather than risk death at the hands of the Japanese, and Chen even packs his things and buys a ticket – but when he overhears two members of the Jingwu School talking about how they poisoned Huo, he kills both men and then is forced into hiding. Chen sets out to find out who else was behind the poisoning, and kill them.\n\nImmediately, during that first scene at Huo’s funeral where Lee frantically tries to dig up his master, I knew I would love this movie so much more than Lee’s previous film. I adore the set design and costuming from this period in China’s history and marveled at how high the production value seemed for a film made during the early 70s. Having had no knowledge of what the movie was about prior to seeing it, I became very excited when I realized it was a direct spiritual sequel to one of my favorite wuxia of all time, 2006’s Fearless with Jet Li. In Fearless, Jet Li portrays Huo Yuanjia, who after a violent tragedy and self-exile becomes a hero to the Chinese people for his stance against foreign aggression and his ability to defeat their greatest fighters in martial arts. At the end of that film, Huo is poisoned with arsenic in his tea by a Japanese diplomat who wants to see him lose to Japanese fighter Tanaka, a loss which is supposed to bring shame to China and demonstrate Japan’s superiority. In Fist of Fury, the theory is proposed that Mr. Suzuki, the master and owner of the bushido dojo, as well as several of his cohorts, all conspired against Huo and poisoned his biscuits. In real life, the true cause of Huo’s death was never determined, though an autopsy suggests that he may have been poisoned with arsenic. Since Huo Yuanjia is such a heroic figure in Chinese lore, discerning fact from myth is difficult.\n\nFor me, in my past, the biggest disincentive to watch Bruce Lee films was the fact that he made, through ADR, such bizarre, high-pitched noises while fighting. I found them so distracting and cringe-worthy! In my previous review I learned three possible explanations, but the one that seemed most likely to me was that the noises were meant to help western audiences distinguish him from the other actors. While practicing real martial arts, Lee didn’t make those noises, thankfully. The cat-monkey growls and snarls are mercifully few and far between in Fist of Fury, at least compared to The Big Boss, so I was able more easily to enjoy Lee’s athleticism and Han Ying Chieh’s fight choreography, especially the match between Chen and a super-strong Russian expatriate named Petrov (Robert Baker), who is shown hammering nails through a board with his palms. Furthermore, the fake blood is appreciatively more realistic. I love when filmmakers spend money on proper blood, and hope the next few films of his have equally high production values and are as impressively well-made.\n\nJames Tien, who played Hsu in The Big Boss, returns as one of the Jingwu students, and once again, he dies relatively early into the story. Lo Wei, who also directed both films, appears as a Chinese detective who gets involved with the search for Chen. The lovely Nora Miao plays another Jingwu student and Chen’s fiancée and the reason he returned to Shanghai in the first place. One of my favorite scenes is when she finds him hiding out in the graveyard after he’s murdered the two traitors. They have a very heartfelt dialogue about the plans they’d made with each other, and how happy they might have been able to be if this cycle of bloodshed had never started. As with Fearless, the plot of Fist of Fury carries with it the adage of “an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind.” This is in contrast to the quick and uneventful ending in The Big Boss. Here, Chen’s revenge against the men who poisoned his master isn’t just personal or selfish. It’s about more than him. Like his master, Chen stands up to the injustice of foreign aggressors, and his sacrifice is meant to inspire the people of China not to tolerate the indignities thrust upon them by foreign occupiers. The ending is very satisfying, especially the final song, which goes, “Who says knight errantry is dead? / Who says life is always preferred? / Here goes a true hero / Caring little what lies ahead.” There’s the lesson we’ll take from the film. Better to die a hero than live a coward.\n\nWhile Huo Yuanjia is a real historical figure in Chinese history, albeit one who’s been absorbed into the national mythology, Chen Zhen is an entirely fictional character supposedly based on the real-life Huo pupil Liu Zhensheng. After Fist of Fury, the character has appeared in many more films and retellings of the story, including 1994’s Fist of Legend with Jet Li (which means Jet Li has portrayed both the poisoned master and the vengeful pupil on two separate occasions) and 2010’s Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen with Donnie Yen.\n\nFist of Fury has a 92% score on Rotten Tomatoes with 12 reviews. I won’t make any DVD recommendations as each release of Lee’s films has their own advantages and disadvantages, but this one is a definite watch if you haven’t already seen it, and a definite rewatch if you have.
