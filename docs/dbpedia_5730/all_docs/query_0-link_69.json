        "text": "The FAA's Hellcats and Tarpons (Avengers) had power folding wings, but I don't believe any of the British-build carrier aircraft of WW2 had power folding? Is the postwar Sea Fury the first?\n\nWhy did it take so long? This postwar Seafire has them, why not the earlier models?\n\nEwenS\n\nTech Sergeant\n\n2,135\n\n4,191\n\nOct 19, 2021\n\nGrumman developed its STO-Wing folding system in 1940/41. It was designed around a hydraulic system. But wing folding added weight to the F4F Wildcat so sapping performance. So to minimise the performance loss the folding wing F4F Wildcats were fitted with a manual system instead.\n\nWhen the folding wing Seafire III was developed in 1942/43 power folding was seen as most desirable due to man power issues amongst carrier deck crews. BUT the weight increase to provide it (especially with the double fold) was unacceptable due to the effect it would have on performance on what was basically a modified, and already heavier, Spitfire V. Then the Seafire XV/XVII used the same wing and folding mechanism, but was only seen as an interim aircraft pending development of the Spitfire XXI based Seafire 47 with the single wing fold. Powered folding on Seafire 47 was fitted from the 5th production aircraft which first flew in Feb 1947.\n\nMost of the main British naval aircraft types of WW2 began development before mid-1940. Many suffered substantial weight growth. Powered folding on the likes of Barracuda and Firefly would simply have exacerbated the performance problems they had.\n\nBy the end of the war more powerful engines were available and new types entering service then got power folding. But the post war slowdown meant it was 1946-48 before Seafire 47, Sea Fury F.10 and Sea Hornet F.20 and later Firefly versions began to reach front line units.\n\nThe nature and tempo of carrier operating cycles changed significantly between 1940 and 1942 highlighting the need for power folding.\n\npbehn\n\nColonel\n\n13,201\n\n10,330\n\nOct 30, 2013\n\nDid the sea Mosquito get them? I cant find any info.\n\nEwenS\n\nTech Sergeant\n\n2,135\n\n4,191\n\nOct 19, 2021\n\nDid the sea Mosquito get them? I cant find any info.\n\nSea Mosquito TR.33 had manually folded wings after the first 13 aircraft had been built. It was only ever envisaged as a low production variant and power folding would have meant complete redesign of the hydraulic system with the added weight that that brought.\n\nAdmiralty plans in 1944 envisaged a total of 72 being acquired for 2 squadrons (24 aircraft each) as alternative air groups for HMS Implacable & Indefatigable plus a photo squadron (12 aircraft) plus another 12 for trials and training. The purpose was to provide a long range strike / PR capability for the Far East, something that the Director of Plans felt was beyond the capability of the USN at the time.\n\nWith the end of the WW2 the production order was cut back from 100 to 50 with another 6 built as TR.37 with a different radar in the nose. The only front line FAA squadron with Mosquitos was 811 squadron, which had reformed on Mosquito VI on 15 Sept 1945 to work up on the type. These were gradually replaced with 12 TR.33 between April and August 1946. It operated these until it disbanded on 1 July 1947.\n\nA whole range of second line FAA squadrons operated various versions of the Mosquito during the latter part of the war and then into the postwar years.\n\nMikeMeech\n\nSenior Airman\n\n585\n\n1,413\n\nNov 20, 2019\n\nThe FAA's Hellcats and Tarpons (Avengers) had power folding wings, but I don't believe any of the British-build carrier aircraft of WW2 had power folding? Is the postwar Sea Fury the first?\n\nWhy did it take so long? This postwar Seafire has them, why not the earlier models?\n\nHi\n\nWhile the Avenger/Tarpon had power folding, as far as I can find the Hellcat had manual folding like the Wildcat/Martlet. Indeed the Grumman 'sto-wing' system is very similar to the earlier (1937) Blackburn Skua folding system:\n\nThe Supermarine system for folding wings proposed in 1939 for the 'Sea Spitfire' (from 'Spitfire, The History' by Morgan & Shacklady) also appears to be similar to the later Grumman system:\n\nOr the system of the two-seat N 8/39 proposal (from same source):\n\nThese were also manual (as they had been on bi-planes from 1912 onwards). As has been mentioned power folding did increase the weight of the system and it became more viable and necessary as aircraft got heavier and had more engine power.\n\nMike\n\nHere's the F4F Wildcat \"Power\" wing fold system.\n\nThumpalumpacus\n\nMajor\n\n9,617\n\n14,872\n\nFeb 5, 2021\n\nTejas\n\nHere's the F4F Wildcat \"Power\" wing fold system.\n\nLike I used to joke about my old 73 Toyota -- \"it's got Armstrong power-steering.\"\n\nBiffF15\n\nTech Sergeant\n\n1,981\n\n3,501\n\nAug 15, 2010\n\nFlorida\n\nHere's the F4F Wildcat \"Power\" wing fold system.\n\n\"Man\" power.\n\nA lot easier than the Seafire.\n\nEwenS\n\nTech Sergeant\n\n2,135\n\n4,191\n\nOct 19, 2021\n\nHi\n\nWhile the Avenger/Tarpon had power folding, as far as I can find the Hellcat had manual folding like the Wildcat/Martlet.

As has been mentioned power folding did increase the weight of the system and it became more viable and necessary as aircraft got heavier and had more engine power.\n\nMike\n\nI'm confused about the Hellcat. This training film states that hydraulic power was at least required to lock the wings in place (see from 1.20 onwards) once they were unfolded. But it shows one / two men only on each wing as they were unfolded.\n\nDoesn't seem very much manpower when compared to this training film on carrier flight deck operations with the Wildcat (see around 4.30 onwards)\n\nEven the video above has 3 involved plus one overseer (elf and safety no doubt!)\n\nI can't find anything at the moment actually showing a Hellcat's wings being either folded or unfolded. They always seem to on deck with wings spread. Sods law when you are looking for something.\n\nHmmâ€¦. I assumed the F6F Hellcat had power folding since both the Corsair and Avenger did.\n\nGreenKnight121\n\nSenior Airman\n\n673\n\n1,275\n\nMar 16, 2014\n\nThe Hellcat is listed as having optional power-folding. All Hellcats had the power-fold system installed, but it could be easily disabled for manual folding if so desired... and many squadrons on USN carriers did that to reduce wear on the aircraft systems.\n\nHere's the Avenger (edit) fold. I thought the engine had to be running to generate the hydraulic power?\n\nLast edited: Mar 8, 2022\n\nBiffF15\n\nTech Sergeant\n\n1,981\n\n3,501\n\nAug 15, 2010\n\nFlorida\n\nHere's the Hellcat fold.

The OV-10 had one (made by the lowest bidder) that worked the gear and flaps, as well as the 767, A319 and A320 (assume the rest of the \"320\" types have them as well).\n\nCheers,\n\nBiff"
