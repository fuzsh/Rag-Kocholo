        "text": "THE THIN MAN (1934): Dashiell Hammettâs urbane but fun-loving sleuths Nick and Nora Charles, along with their pup Asta, investigate the disappearance of an inventor in this classic blend of laughs and suspense. Shot in just two weeks by director Woody \"One-Shot'' Van Dyke and cinematographer James Wong Howe, this gem set the gold standard for the sophisticated comedyâinspiring five sequels as well as countless inferior imitations. Van Dyke previously directed Myrna Loy and William Powell in Manhattan Melodrama and spotted the terrific chemistry of their off-screen banter between takes. He insisted on casting the pair as Hammettâs hard-drinking super-couple and the glamorous pair became one of the movies' great romantic teams. Shot by the legendary cinematographer James Wong Howe. The film garnered four Oscar nominations, Best Picture, Best actor for Powell, Best Director, and Best Writing, Adaptation for Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett. Dir. Woody Van Dyke\n\nTORN CURTAIN (1966): An American scientist (Paul Newman) pretends to defect to East Germany as part of a spy mission to obtain the formula of a secret miracle resin and escape back to the United States. He is accompanied by his fiancÃ© (Julia Andrews) who is relived to find that he is a double agent. This film also contains one of the most touching scenes in a Hitchcock film and one of the grisliest murders. Dir. Alfred Hitchcock\n\nI CONFESS (1953): In Quebec, a priest (Montgomery Clift) hears the confession of a murderer and then finds himself accused of the crime. He canât break the sanctity of the confessional and must find another way to clear himself. To complicate matters his ex-sweetheart (Anne Baxter), who still loves him, was being blackmailed by the victim. Dir. Alfred Hitchcock\n\nA PLACE IN THE SUN (1951): This sublime adaptation of Theodore Dreiserâs An American Tragedy is noir to the core, despite the gloss and glamour Paramount ladled on to make it a huge hit. A blue-collar social climber (Montgomery Clift) falls for a gorgeous society debutante (Elizabeth Taylor, at the peak of her beauty), but his plain, prole, and pregnant girlfriend (Shelley Winters) stands in the way of his personal American Dream. It won Oscars for best costumes, score, editing, cinematography, screenplay, and direction, yet somehow lost best picture to An American in Paris. Dir. George Stevens\n\nSTILL OF THE NIGHT (1982): In the neo-noir, psychiatrist Sam Rice (Roy Scheider) is approached by beautiful Brooke Reynolds (Meryl Steep) who was having an affair with one of his patients who was recently murdered. She wants him to return her loverâs watch to his widow (Jessica Tandy). A visit from a NYPD detective who warns him that the unknown murderer may target Rice believing that he may know something pertaining to the murder. See if you can spot all the Hitchcock references. Dir. Robert Benton\n\nNOTORIOUS (1946): Ruthless but attractive U.S. government agent T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant) recruits party girl Alicia (Ingrid Bergman), the daughter of a German spy who committed suicide in prison, to infiltrate a Nazi spy ring in post-WW2 Brazil. In this morally grey but thrilling espionage tale by Ben Hecht, love plays second fiddle to duty: Alicia makes the supreme sacrifice and marries suspected ringleader Alexander (Claude Rains) to aid her lover Devlinâs mission. Rains and Leopoldine Konstantin (who plays Alexanderâs overly devoted mum) steal the picture from one of the most gorgeous romantic pairs of all time with their sterling performances. Dir. Alfred Hitchcock\n\nBREATHLESS Ã bout de souffle (1960): Small-time crook Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo), a ne'er-do-well with a headful of cinematic delusions, falls for Patricia (Jean Seberg), a sexy young American in Paris. Action, ennui, and tragedy ensue. On one level, a loving tribute to Hollywood B moviemaking, but more crucially a simple tale told in nontraditional, exhilarating cinéma verité style; it heralded not only the arrival of France's Nouvelle Vague, but a seismic shift in movie style and technique. One of two noir-tinged films released in 1960 that forever changed international cinema. Dir. Jean-Luc Godard\n\nTHE NAKED STREET (1955): A mobster (Anthony Quinn) springs a condemned murderer (Farley Granger) who impregnated his sister in time to save him from the electric chair, to spare her (Ann Bancroft) from a fate worse than death, unwed motherhood. The brother, of course, lives to regret it. Dir. Maxwell Shane\n\nUNDERCURRENT (1946): In this unusually cast noir, a sheltered woman (Katherine Hepburn) realizes that either her husband (Robert Taylor with a Walt Disneyesque mustache) or his mysterious brother, (noir stalwart Robert Mitchum) is a psychopath. Edmund Gwenn co-stars as Hepburnâs father. Dir. Vincente Minnelli\n\nTHE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE (1974): Lieutenant Garber (Walter Matthau) races the clock to thwart the plot of four criminals Blue (Robert Shaw), Green (Martin Balsam), Grey (Hector Elizondo) & Brown (Earl Hindman). Theyâre holding a subway car full of passengers hostage and threaten to shoot one each minute until a one-million-dollar ransom is fully paid. Dir. Joseph Sargent\n\nDOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944): Barbara Stanwyckâin a platinum blonde wigâplays Phyllis Dietrichsonâthe consummate femme fatale who lures insurance salesman and all-around chump Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) into a plot involving murder and insurance fraud. His friend, and insurance adjuster, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) smells a rat. Nominated for seven Oscars: Best Actress in a Leading Role; Best Cinematography, Black-and-White; Best Director; Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture; Best Picture; Best Sound, Recording; and Best Writing, Screenplay. Dir. Billy Wilder\n\nMANPOWER (1941): Power linemen and best friends Hank (Edward G. Robinson) and Johnny (George Raft) feud over Hankâs wife (Marlene Dietrich). Life imitated art during the production of this film; the two actors tussled over Dietrich. Raft won. Dir. Raoul Walsh\n\nSTAGE FRIGHT (1950): Jane Wyman may be the star of the film, but Marlene Dietrich walks away with it. Wyman plays a mousey RADA student out to clear her crush, Jonathan (Richard Todd) suspected of murdering the husband of a glamorous actress-singer (Dietrich). Things get complicated when she falls for the detective, âOrdinaryâ Smith (Michael Wilding) who is searching for Jonathan. Dir. Alfred Hitchcock\n\nSTORM WARNING (1951): A model (Ginger Rogers) visits her recently married younger sister (Doris Day) in small town America and witnesses a lynching. When she arrives at her sisterâs home, she realizes her brother-in-law (Steve Cochran) was part of the lynch mob. Will she help the crusading D.A. (Ronald Regan) bring down the local branch of the KKK, including her sisterâs husband? Dir. Stuart Heisler"
