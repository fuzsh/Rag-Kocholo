        "text": "Dreadnought\n\nSuper Sea Fury Racer\n\nby Bernhard Schrock\n\nHobbycraft's 1/48 scale Sea Fury is available online from Squadron\n\nDescription\n\nThis time I present my next Racer. This is a highly modified Sea Fury with the name Dreadnought.\n\nThe plane was fitted with the powerful R-4360 Corncob-engine from P&W, housed in a longer nose and a 4 blade prop from a Skyraider with big spinner. A higher tailplane and a second air inlet in the wing root completed the modification.\n\nI started with the 1/48 kit scale kit from Hobbycraft and combined it with the conversion kit from Maintrack Models.\n\nI added landing gear legs in white metal from Aeroclub and wheels from True Details. The wheel plates are scratchbuilt from 0,15 mm plastic. I also refined the tail gear.\n\nThe most challenging aspect was the decals. I painted the plane's name with black ink on a decal film and sealed it with liquid decal film from Microscale. All other markings are spares, airbrushed or hand painted.\n\nAdditional Images\n\nClick the thumbnails below to view larger images:\n\nModel, Images and Text Copyright Â© 2003 by Bernhard Schrock\n\nPage Created 30 October, 2003\n\nLast Updated 25 March, 2004"
