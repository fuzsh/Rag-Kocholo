But it was a completely new design.\n\nIt was inspired by a German Focke-Wulf Fw 190 A, captured in June 1942, which was a model for compactness and skillful use of air-cooled radial engines.\n\nCamm took over the wings, except for the middle part, from the Hawker Tempest and went from the steel pipe to the self-supporting construction for the airframe.\n\nThe prototypes were flown with Centaurus, Griffon and Sabre engines, while Boulton Paul developed the Sea Fury.\n\nAt the end of WW2 the RAF orders were cancelled, but 65 Hawker Fury were built for Iraq, Egypt and Pakistan. Some of them were two-seat trainers with either two cabin roofs (Egypt) or a long roof (T 61 for Pakistan).\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury was the standard fighter-bomber of the Royal Navy and was also sold to Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, Western Germany, Burma, Cuba and other countries.\n\nThe total production figure was 860, from which the British Royal Navy received 615.\n\nDuring the Korean War (1950-53) the Hawker Sea Fury was used as the standard aircraft of the RN, RAN and RCN from light carriers and flows numerous missions to support the ground troops. Even in aerial combat against the Russian MiG-15 they achieved good results.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Hawker Fury remained in use until 1973. A Hawker Fury in US property holds the world record in speed for piston engines.\n\nUsers: Royal Navy, Canada, Netherlands, Australia, Western Germany, Burma, Cuba.\n\nSpecifications Hawker Sea Fury\n\nSpecifications:\n\nHawker Sea Fury\n\nSpecifications\n\nType\n\ncarrier-based fighter-bomber\n\nPower plant\n\n1 x 2,470 hp Bristol Centaurus 18-cylinder two-row radial engine\n\nAccommodation\n\n1\n\nWing span\n\n38 ft 4.2 in\n\nLength overall\n\n34 ft 7.7 in\n\nHeight overall\n\n15 ft 9.4 in\n\nWeight empty\n\n8,874 lb\n\nWeight loaded\n\n12,514 lb\n\nMaximum speed\n\n460 mph\n\nInitial climb\n\n4330 ft / min\n\nService ceiling\n\n36,090 ft\n\nRange\n\n760 miles\n\nArmament:\n\nHawker Sea Fury\n\nSpecification\n\nin wing roots\n\n4 x 20mm Hispano guns\n\nexternal load\n\nracks under wings for 2,000 lb of weapons(12 rockets or four Triplex rockets, bombs or fuel tanks)\n\nService statistics:\n\nHawker Sea Fury\n\nfigures\n\nFirst flight\n\n1 September 1944\n\nFirst flight Sea Fury\n\n21 February 1945\n\nTotal production figure (all)\n\n925\n\n3D Model Hawker Sea Fury\n\nReferences and literature"
