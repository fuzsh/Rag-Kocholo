        "text": "1. CASABLANCA\n\n(1942, Directed by Michael Curtiz, Written by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G Epstein, Howard E. Koch and Casey Robinson, based on the play Everybody Comes to Rick’s, by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison)\n\nPerhaps Bogey learned everything he needed to know about writers and writing during the making of Casablanca, the film with seemingly a thousand writers (as the above list of credits suggests). Casablanca is probably the antithesis of the auteur theory, the idea that the best films are the product of a single creator, or “author.” It seems to have no one single author (nor even one single director, as Curtiz was just the last in a long line of directors who worked on it) and yet it is still probably cinema’s most singular vision of freedom, both artistic and political.\n\nAt the heart of it, of course, as the title of the original play suggests, is Bogey’s “Rick,” the cynic who eventually proves himself a romantic, but in the process loses the woman he loves. If Casablanca is the obvious choice as the ultimate Bogey movie, well, sometimes the obvious is just absolutely obvious and unarguable. As I have written before, Casablanca is probably the greatest film script ever written, with every line not only beautiful but quotable. However, it would almost certainly never have worked as well as it does without Bogey as the lead.\n\nIf all art is at least in part a product of its time, so are all artists. Perhaps it was World War Two that made Bogey the greatest male movie star. Up until its outbreak, he was largely unsuccessful and mostly forgettable in the films he made. With the coming of war, however, and the consequent darkening of mood around the world (even in America before its formal entry to the war after Pearl Harbor), the gangsters and glamour boys of the Thirties no longer seemed to fit the public mood. What was needed instead was an Everyman, but an Everyman who embodied every man’s hope for himself (and every woman’s idealised version of that man). That man, of course, was Bogey, and it is chastening to think that just as some children today no longer know about or understand the importance of World War Two, so they know nothing about the man who was effectively its poster boy. For all true lovers of cinema, though, whatever their age, Bogey will always be the greatest. And it is entirely fitting that, like Christ himself, the King of Cinema was born on Christmas Day."
