        "text": "We’ve known for several years that Mad Max creator and director George Miller intends for Mad Max: Fury Road to be the first instalment of a new trilogy, but Miller has now revealed the title he has in mind for the first follow-up to Fury Road: Mad Max: The Wasteland.\n\nDiscussing the potential future of the Mad Max series on The Q&A with Jeff Goldsmith, Miller echoed his 2011 comments regarding future Mad Max screenplays and confirmed that a script for a second film exists and work is underway on the third.\n\n“We’ve got one screenplay and a novella,” explained Miller. “It happened because, with the delays [on Fury Road] and writing all the backstories, they just expanded.”\n\nPressed for a possible title for the second, Miller dubbed it Mad Max: The Wasteland but clarified no storyboarding has taken place at this stage.\n\n“No, no, no; I just finished this movie 12 days ago!” chuckles Miller. “I said to someone it’s like asking a woman who’s just given birth, ‘When are you having your next baby?’”\n\nMad Max: Fury Road hit cinemas last week and represents Miller’s biggest opening weekend ever, with the film raking in global ticket sales of $US109.4 million. Tom Hardy revealed last month that he has signed on for three more Mad Max films should follow-ups to Fury Road be greenlit."
