        "text": "Film is seen through sight. Images translate to our brains through our eyes into materiality – what is the becomes that, evidence of something that was in a place in time. But it is only an illusion that our eyes deceive. \"Let that screen fill your mind,\" we are told. And yet, we cannot touch. We can desire to touch—out of lust, anger, fear, or love—but to touch is to destroy the screen.\n\nPerhaps more than Blow-Out, De Palma's The Fury addresses our relationship to cinema, except through the most insane, backwards way possible: a conspiracy thriller with a psychological horror fantasy bent.

There’s no tears, it’s all laughs and then we blow it all to hell. My mother said I need to learn to hug better. He was thin, frail and emotional. She needed him to fix her sink, she couldn’t go 30-60 days without that. I hand him the pocket-sized black book, furrow my brow, and plow…"
