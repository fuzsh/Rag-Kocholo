He was rolling out on landing after his display when the plane\n\nswerved slightly and went over on its nose and then on its back. The accident was at about 2--2:30\n\non Tuesday.\n\nI only saw the replay on local TV. I did see the show on Sunday. Hilliard flew a very nice display, with\n\nwingtip smoke generators like Frank Sanders used to have, as well as engine smoke. I remember well of\n\ncourse seeing him fly many times with the Eagles team.\n\nThe accident is eerily reminiscent of Harry Doan's fatal accident in a AD Skyraider at Tico a few years\n\nago. One difference is that Doan landed really long and flipped right at the end of the runway. It\n\nlooked as if Hilliard had lots of room remaining.\n\nIt is very sad and a great loss.\n\n--\n\nDavid Tanner\n\nufta...@nervm.nerdc.ufl.edu\n\nPaul Coggan <E...@warbirdsww.com> wrote:\n\n>Hello there\n\n>Just heard this morning UK time that a Sea Fury had a landing accident at Lakeland, Florida, USA.\n\n>Aircraft flipped over on its back after landing.

I\n\nwas told by my parents that it appeared that one wheel had a puff of\n\nsmoke out of the brake area and then it went over on it's back.\n\nApparently Charlie was crushed when it landed.

The prop kicked up\n\nsand/dirt and dug in to the ground...and she went up and over. Rather slowly, in\n\nfact. The aircraft was clearly supported by the vertical stabilizer and the\n\ncowling...the tail did not crumple and the canopy did not break or, as far as I\n\ncan tell from closely watching and rewatching the video, even hit the ground. At\n\nthe speed it went over, you would expect the pilot to survive. I could see no\n\nevidence of his head hitting the canopy. Perhaps he was incapacitated before it\n\nveered off the runway and went over? Something odd certainly happened. After\n\nstudying that tape, I can't buy the locked brake scenario. Besides, I heard they\n\ntowed it away afterwards (after turning it over, of course).\n\nA damn shame...but something strange happened out there.\n\n--\n\n==>For All E-Mail Replies, Use \"wsh...@airmail.net\"\n\n=============================================================\n\nWalt Shiel - Author: \"Cessna Warbirds, A Detailed and\n\nPersonal History of Cessna's Involvement in the Armed Forces\"\n\n[For More Info, E-Mail: wsh...@airmail.net]\n\n=============================================================\n\nPaul Coggan <E...@warbirdsww.com> wrote:\n\n>Hello there\n\n>Just heard this morning UK time that a Sea Fury had a landing accident at Lakeland, Florida, USA.\n\n>Aircraft flipped over on its back after landing.

The aircraft\n\nbrakes reportedly locked, the aircraft veered off the runway and flipped over. The pilot/sole\n\noccupant suffered fatal injuries and the aircraft has substantial\n\ndamage.\"\n\nPolk County (Fla.) Medical Examiner Alexander Melamud concluded Hillard died of \"positional\n\nasphyxia\" after \"his chest and back were compressed by\n\nparts of the cockpit.\"\n\nHillard, 58, had logged 42 years and more than 15,000 hours of flight time. Some of his\n\naccomplishments included:\n\nMember, U.S. Skydiving Team, 1958\n\nNational Aerobatic Champion, 1967\n\nWorld Aerobatic Champion, 1972\n\nLeader of The Eagles Aerobatic Team, 1971-1995\n\nEAA OSHKOSH air show boss 1991-1995\n\nFuneral services were held Monday, April 22, in Fort Worth, Texas. Memorials may be directed to\n\nthe Aviation Heritage Museum in Fort Worth or the\n\nEAA Aviation Foundation in Oshkosh, Wis.\n\nPoberezny had the following comments following Hillard's accident:\n\n\"Charlie Hillard was a world-class aviator. He was a world aerobatic champion, the leader of the\n\nEagles Aerobatic Team for 25 years. He was just totally\n\nimmersed in aviation.\n\n\"Along with his aviation skills, Charlie was a highly respected member of the community, as\n\nevidenced by the outpouring of support to his family and\n\ncolleagues in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n\"He was also an important part of the EAA family. That makes this an especially difficult loss\n\nfrom both a personal and professional standpoint.\n\n\"Our sincere condolences to Charlie's family during this difficult time. He will be missed, but\n\nmore importantly, he will be remembered.\"\n\nAmen.\n\nRegards, Jim"
