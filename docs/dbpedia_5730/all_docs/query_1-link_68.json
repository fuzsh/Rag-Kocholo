        "text": "There’s a punctuation party raging throughout Hollywood, which is in desperate need of a colon cleanse.\n\nThis year alone, Hollywood will release 20 films with colons in their titles, which appears to be a record. The colon proliferation is indicative of the industry’s reliance on sequels and reboots that need to distinguish themselves from their predecessors with a pair of dots and a subtitle.\n\nAnd we’re not even counting all the foreign films and documentaries released in less than 100 theaters, projects like “We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks,” “Cinco de Mayo: La Batalla” and “Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry.”\n\nThe trend has spread from wide releases at major studios to films from specialty labels such as Fox Searchlight (“Absolutely Fabulous: the Movie”), Sony Pictures Classics (“The Raid: Redemption”) and Radius-TWC (“Escobar: Paradise Lost”).\n\nHollywood seems to be breaking its own record this year, as last year there were 16 films that qualified. Meanwhile, of the 20 titles this year with colons, 13 are sequels, one is a reboot, one is a spinoff, one is based on a TV series, one is a concert film, one is an original comedy and two are based on books.\n\nThere’s no end in sight to the colon craziness, as films on the horizon in 2017 include “Alien: Covenant,” “xXx: The Return of Xander Cage,” “Amityville: The Awakening,” “Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,” “John Wick: Chapter Two,” “Maze Runner: The Death Cure,” “Kong: Skull Island,” “Knights of the Roundtable: King Arthur,” “Smurfs: The Lost Village,” “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,” “The Divergent Series: Ascendant” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming.”\n\nHeck, even Netflix has been getting in on the action of late with “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny.”\n\nTake a look at the colon epidemic below and hit the comments section if you have any suggestions on how to fix this punctuation problem.\n\n2016: 20 Movies\n\n13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi\n\nThe Divergent Series: Allegiant\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\n\nBarbershop: The Next Cut\n\nThe Huntsman: Winter’s War\n\nCaptain America: Civil War\n\nNeighbors 2: Sorority Rising\n\nX-Men: Apocalypse\n\nPopstar: Never Stop Never Stopping\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows\n\nIndependence Day: Resurgence\n\nThe Purge: Election Year\n\nIce Age: Collision Course\n\nAbsolutely Fabulous: The Movie\n\nMechanic: Resurrection\n\nMiddle School: The Worst Years of My Life\n\nKevin Hart: What Now?\n\nJack Reacher: Never Go Back\n\nOuija: Origin of Evil\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story\n\n2015: 16 Movies\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron\n\nThe Divergent Series: Insurgent\n\nEscobar: Paradise Lost\n\nHitman: Agent 47\n\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2\n\nInsidious: Chapter 3\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service\n\nMad Max: Fury Road\n\nMaze Runner: The Scorch Trials\n\nMission: Impossible – Rogue Nation\n\nParanormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2\n\nThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens\n\nThe Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death\n\n2014: 14 Movies\n\n300: Rise of an Empire\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nExodus: Gods and Egypt\n\nHobbit: Battle of the Five Armies\n\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1\n\nIsland of Lemurs: Madagascar 3D\n\nJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\n\nNight at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\n\nParanormal Activity: The Marked Ones\n\nPlanes: Fire & Rescue\n\nThe Purge: Anarchy\n\nSin City: A Dame to Kill For\n\nTransformers: Age of Extinction\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past\n\n2013: 15 Movies\n\nAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues\n\nAugust: Osage County\n\nG.I.
