        "text": "A recent video prompted memories of the day a Hawker Sea Fury was lost during the Prestwick Air Show of 1989.\n\nI may be wrong, but this show was unusual in the number of incidents (usually zero) which occurred.\n\nIf I’m thinking of the correct year, this show was also halted during the displays while a passenger jet made an emergency landing and was evacuated in front of the crowd. While little was announced to the crowd (I don’t even remember hearing anything over the PA), all activity stopped while the aircraft landed and was handled. I had to hunt for info afterward (no mobile phones with cameras, Internet, or trashy social media chasing clicks back then), and believe there was smoke reported, but nothing was confirmed and nothing was found.\n\nHowever, events came to a halt for a second time when the Hawker Sea Fury reported an undercarriage fault, and one of the undercarriage legs would not lower. I can’t say which as online accounts which can be found today conflict, with both the port and starboard items being given as the problem in different accounts.\n\nThe pilot made various attempts to lower the gear, including touch and go on the lowered leg, but none of these freed the stuck leg.\n\nAs the single leg configuration was deemed dangerous for a ground landing, once his fuel level had fallen, the pilot headed for the sea off Turnberry, where the aircraft was ditched after he parachuted to safety.\n\nSadly, it seems the aircraft was lost and could not be recovered.\n\nYou can find pics of the aircraft in better days here.\n\nNot so in the recent ditching seen below, where the pilot ditched a Grumman TBM Avenger in the water just off Cocoa Beach, during an air show there.\n\nMore details here: Check Out This Dramatic Video of a TBM Avenger Ditching Yesterday at Cocoa Beach Airshow.\n\nI think there was film of the Turnberry ditching on the news shortly after the event, and I always wondered why this was done so far out to sea – but have to the respect the Pilot in Command’s decision as he has ALL the facts, and understands the characteristics of the aircraft.\n\nI did drive down to Turnberry after the show, but after looking along the coast road couldn’t see or find any activity, or even any boats on the water, but had no way of knowing if I was even in the right area.\n\nObviously, the ditching HAS to be out to sea if the pilot is parachuting and leaving the aircraft – at the height needed for that (without an ejection seat) the aircraft could glide for some considerable distance, turn, and head inland to have a disastrous crash somewhere. Sod’s Law suggests it would head for the nearest road, and wipe out some family in the area for a holiday break. There are also houses, and even a hotel – although nobody would care about that today, at least not while it is owned by absentee landlord, asset stripper, and bankrupt grifter, Donald J Trump.\n\nThis was later followed with news of the recovery.\n\nA Look at the Recovery of the TBM Avenger That Ditched at Cocoa Beach Airshow\n\nI cut off the intro, and you can stop watching at the 4-minute point, as this guy just rambles."
