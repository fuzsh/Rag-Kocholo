We are delighted to announce the appointments of Martin Foster as First Team Coach and Karl Lenaghan as Goalkeeper Coach to join Danny Ellis and Danny Forrest’s backroom team.

Martin Foster is a former professional footballer who came through Leeds United’s academy before a move to Greenock Morton.

Whilst in Scotland the midfielder was loaned out to Doncaster Rovers before the move was made permanent. Foster went on to play for Ilkeston Town, Forest Green Rovers, Halifax Town, Oxford United, Rushden & Diamonds, Tamworth, Eastwood Town, Harrogate Town and Hull United.

The Rotherham born coach has plenty of off field experience too working with Matlock Town, Sheffield FC, Tadcaster Albion and Gainsborough Trinity on two occasions in joint manager and assistant manager roles.

We have also added Karl Lenaghan to the team. The former footballer has been a regular visitor to Nethermoor over the years with opposition including Stockport County, Bradford (Park Avenue) and FC Halifax Town as a goalkeeper coach.

Karl is another based in the local area and was a goalkeeper himself for several clubs including Bradford City, Ossett Town and Bradford (Park Avenue).

You’ll find him on a matchday making sure our keepers are ready for the game ahead with tailored warm-ups and training sessions.

Welcome to the club Martin and Karl!
