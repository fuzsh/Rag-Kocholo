        "text": "British Steel intends to shut its blast furnaces at Scunthorpe; a move that could result in up to 2,000 job losses.\n\nBBC News speaks to one third-generation steelworker and full-time Unite union convenor fighting to protect livelihoods.\n\n\"It feels very personal...\" admits Martin Foster, a full-time Unite union convenor at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. He draws a sharp intake of breath, composing himself, before continuing his sentence.\n\n\"...because those people that I represent mean something to me.\"\n\nSince the 19th Century, when ironstone was first discovered here, this Lincolnshire town has relied on the sector.\n\nIt's clear why Mr Foster feels under attack: the workers he represents are his neighbours, friends and family.\n\nMr Foster, who joined the works in 1978, is from a long line of steelworkers. He wears the stress of years of arduous work and job uncertainty.\n\n\"For the last 15 years we have been fighting for the steel industry and it feels like a never-ending battle,\" he says.\n\nBritish Steel says the blast furnaces need to go as part of its Â£1.25bn plan to create \"a clean, green and sustainable business\".\n\nHowever, the unions say it will come at a huge cost, with up to 2,000 jobs - most of them in Scunthorpe - expected to be lost.\n\nMr Foster says he sees families, not numbers.\n\n\"Two thousand job losses is not just 2,000 job losses - it's 2,000 families decimated,\" he says.\n\n\"We need to do everything we can to protect these jobs.\"\n\nMr Foster, whose grandfather toiled as a bricklayer at the town's former Normanby Park steelworks, says the consequences of Britain losing its once-mighty steel industry will be severe for towns like Scunthorpe.\n\n\"If we lose the industry it will probably be the end of Scunthorpe as we know it. Businesses will close. People will move away.\n\n\"They will no doubt bring industrial parks to the area but it will not replace the well-paid jobs we have enjoyed in the steel industry for decades.\"\n\nWatch Martin Foster's full interview on Politics North on BBC1 at 10:00 GMT on Sunday."
