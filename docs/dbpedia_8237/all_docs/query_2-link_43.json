        "text": "The courage to endure the challenges and conflict characterizing the believer's earthly course is fueled by the consolation of their ultimate conquest at the point of entering the Presence of the Lord.\n\nThe demonstration of this courage coupled with unwavering confidence could not have been more apparent than through the honorable witness and testimony emanating from the life of Sister Lillian Martin Foster.\n\nShe was born to the parental stewardship of James and Gesner Deary Martin on December 29, 1925 in Taylor, Texas. At the tender age of nine she sealed her eternal destiny by accepting Jesus Christ as her personal Savior. She was baptized by the late Pastor O. I. Temple at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church in Taylor, Texas. Her choice to receive Christ resulted in her committed resolve to serving in ministry to His church under His Lordship.\n\nShe attended the public schools of Taylor, Texas, culminating her high school education at Blacksheir High School. As a woman with a passion to live by the principle, \"learning is for living\" she obtained volumes of education, seeking to apply it in vastly diverse aspects. Her conviction for learning was influenced by her intentions to live well. She believed the quality of one's learning would be reflected in the quality of their ability to live. She attended Central Texas College in Killeen, Texas, Canal Zone College in the Panama Canal Zone and graduated from Oahu Community College for Adults in Wahiawa, Hawaii.\n\nThe fruit of her education would be exposed over the course of her employment experience and her community involvement. A reasonable portion of her employment and service experience is listed without confinement to: a Cashier at the Post Exchange, a Counselor Assistant at Project Re-Start - ATU, a Clerk Typist on Fort Hood, and a Receptionist at the Texas Workforce Center in Killeen, Texas. She exemplified the epitome of an Administrative Specialist, serving her government admirably and honorably before retiring from Civil Service in 1999.\n\nHer interest in the welfare of others was registered in her concern and willingness to devote four years of her life to the Killeen Housing Authority from 1995 until 1999.\n\nThe year of 1963 would prove transitionally significant for Sister Foster. During this year she would be united in matrimony to the late Oney Foster. The order of Divine Providence would unveil her assignment to engage parental oversight to three beautiful step-children; each of whom she loved as her very own. During this year her family would also make their home in Killeen, Texas.\n\nIt would not be long after settling that she would unite with Marlboro Heights Missionary Baptist Church under the pastoral leadership of the late Pastor R. A. Abercrombie. She wasted no time putting her heart and hands to the plow, serving in Sunday School, Women's Mission I, the Music Ministry of the Women's Mission Chorus, and serving as the Women's Day Chairperson for many years.\n\nHer commitment to serving bore the authentic qualities of a resilient and reliable servant. This truth would be inescapably noticed at the conclusion of an evening service at Marlboro when at the age of 90, she publicly confirmed her willingness to serve the Lord as long as nothing required exceeded the human frailty her physical or mental limitations. This commitment to her Lord and to her church family remained constant whether it was from her bedroom or hospital room.\n\nHer witness was a genuine reflection of her testimony. Living in an imperfect world, filled with imperfect people, gripped by the inescapable effects of imperfect conditions; the integrity of her intentions were to love God, her family and her fellow man by living her best life in His sight.\n\nDuring the early morning hours of Sunday morning, October 14, 2018, Sister Foster embraced the gentle whisper of her loving Lord, summonsing her into His eternal Presence.\n\nAmong those who preceded her deliverance from the shores of this earthly life are: her parents, James and Gesner Martin.\n\nAmong those who remain to celebrate her earthly tenure and eternal triumph are three step-children: David Foster, Oakland, California, Marilyn Foster Maze, Augusta, Georgia, and Catherine Foster Evans, Cary, North Carolina; four nephews: Fincher B. Roscoe , Austin, Texas, Preston L. Haskins (Reva) Taylor, Texas, Raymond S. Roscoe (Tina) San Antonio, Texas, and J. W. Simmons, Madison, Florida; five grandchildren: James (Darleen) Foster, Corpus Christi, Texas, Charles (Lakia) Maze, Augusta, Georgia, Raymond (Kim) Maze, Augusta, Georgia, Jeffery (Afton) Evans, Clayton, North Carolina, and Cheree (Justin) Teasley, Wendell, North Carolina; thirteen great-grandchildren, and a host of loving, devoted and faithful extended members of her family and friends.\n\nShe fought a good fight, finished her course, and kept the Faith. A fruitful and fulfilling life on earth has now been exchanged for a more glorious life in eternity!\n\nHer special message to her family was prepared in advance, anticipating the celebration of her life. It was documented in her membership profile, and has been reserved to be reflected as written from her heart as follows;\n\n\"I thank God you are all saved. That was my prayer for years: Lord, I want to see my whole family accept you as their Lord and Savior. Thank God He did that for each one. Now feed on His Word and live. Choose Life or death.\n\nLove each other and pray about everything. Stay close to God. Stay with the church. Remember you can do nothing without God. Please don't fuss and fight with each other over the arrangements for me to go Home. Let this day be in peace and love. So I can go in peace. I love you ALL.\"\n\n~Lillian M.
