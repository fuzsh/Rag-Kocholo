        "text": "For other uses, see Rotherham (disambiguation).\n\nRotherham (i rodh-ƏR-əm) is a Minster town in South Yorkshire, England. It is the largest settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham. A historical market town, Rotherham is on the banks of both the Rivers Don and Rother, the latter of which the towns name originates.\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, traditional industries included farming, glass making and flour milling. In the late 18th and 19th centuries, Rotherham became known for its coal mining and, later, steel industries.\n\nThe town's historic county is Yorkshire, and Rotherham once formed part of the West Riding of Yorkshire administrative county. In 1974, this administrative county was abolished during a reorganisation of local government. Subsequently, Rotherham became part of the county of South Yorkshire, where it makes up one of four metropolitan boroughs.\n\nThe town had a population of 109,691 in the 2011 census. The borough had a 2020 population of 265,411, the 60th most populous district in England.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nIron Age and Roman settlements dot the area covered by the district, including a small Roman fort to the south-west in the upper flood meadow of the Don. Rotherham was founded in the very early Middle Ages. Its name is from Old English hām 'homestead, estate', meaning 'homestead on the Rother'. The river name was carried into Old English from Brittonic branch of Celtic words: ro- 'over, chief' and duβr 'water', thus 'main river'; a similar size namesake is in East Sussex, see Rother. It established itself as a Saxon market town, on a Roman road near a forded part of the River Don.\n\nBy the late Saxon period, Rotherham was at the centre of a large parish on the Don's banks.\n\nFollowing the Norman Conquest an absentee lord held the most inhabited manor, Nigel Fossard (however today's city proper takes in eight outyling Domesday estates). The Domesday 'Book' or Survey records this lord of the manor with a Norman name took the place of the Saxon lord Hakon holding 20 years before in 1066 and was tenant of an overlord of hundreds of such manors, Robert de Mortain, the Conqueror's half-brother. The central assets at the time were medium in rank among manors: eight adult male householders were counted as villagers, three were smallholders and one the priest, three ploughlands were tilled by one lord's plough team and two and a half men's plough teams were active. The manor's other resources were a church, four loosely called 'acres' of meadow, and seven of woodland. Rotherham had a mill valued at an ordinary half of one pound sterling.\n\nHis successors, the De Vesci family, rarely visited the town and did not build a castle but maintained a Friday market and a fair. In the mid 13th century, John de Vesci and Ralph de Tili gave all their possessions in Rotherham to Rufford Abbey, a period of growing wealth in the church. The monks collected tithes from the town and gained rights to an extra market day on Monday and to extend the annual fair from two to three days.\n\nThe townsmen of Rotherham formed the \"Greaves of Our Lady's Light\", an organisation which worked with the town's three guilds. It was suppressed in 1547 but revived in 1584 as the feoffees of the common lands of Rotherham, and remains in existence.\n\nIn the 1480s the Rotherham-born Archbishop of York, Thomas Rotherham, instigated the building of a College of Jesus or Jesus College, Rotherham to rival the colleges of Cambridge and Oxford. It was the first brick building in what is now South Yorkshire and taught theology, religious chant and hymns, grammar and writing.\n\nThe College and new parish church of All Saints made Rotherham an enviable and modern town at the turn of the 16th century. The college was dissolved in 1547 in the reign of Edward VI, its assets stripped for the crown to grant to its supporters. Very little remains of the original building in College Street. Walls of part of the College of Jesus are encased within number 23 and Nos 2, 2A, 4 (later for a time Old College Inn, a beerhouse), 6 and 8 Effingham Street. Its fragments of walls are the earliest surviving brick structure in South Yorkshire and are remains of the key institution to Rotherham's growth into a town of regional significance. Sixty years after the College's dissolution Rotherham was described by a wealthy visitor as falling from a fashionable college town to having admitted gambling and vice. The history of Thomas Rotherham and education in the town are remembered in the name of Thomas Rotherham College.\n\nIndustrial Revolution\n\nThe region had been exploited for iron since Roman times, but it was coal that first brought the Industrial Revolution to Rotherham. Exploitation of the coal seams was the driving force behind the improvements to navigation on the River Don, which eventually formed the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation system of navigable inland waterways.\n\nIn the early Industrial Revolution major uses of iron demanded good local ore and established processing skills for iron strength, qualities found in Rotherham's smelting plants and foundries. Iron, and later steel, became the principal industry in Rotherham, surviving into the 20th century. The Walker family built an iron and steel empire in the 18th century, their foundries producing high quality cannon, including some for the ship of the line HMS Victory, and cast iron bridges, one of which was commissioned by Thomas Paine.\n\nRotherham's cast iron industry expanded rapidly in the early 19th century, the Effingham Ironworks, later Yates, Haywood & Co, opened in 1820. Other major iron founders included William Corbitt and Co; George Wright and Co of Burton Weir; Owen and Co of Wheathill Foundry; Morgan Macauley and Waide of the Baths Foundry; the Masbro’ Stove Grate Co belonging to Messrs. Perrot, W. H. Micklethwait and John and Richard Corker of the Ferham Works.\n\nThe Parkgate Ironworks was established in 1823 by Sanderson and Watson, and changed ownership several times. In 1854, Samuel Beal & Co produced wrought iron plates for Isambard Kingdom Brunel's famous steamship the SS Great Eastern. In 1864, the ironworks was taken over by the Parkgate Iron Co. Ltd, becoming the Park Gate Iron and Steel Company in 1888. The company was purchased by Tube Investments Ltd in 1956 and closed in 1974. Steel, Peech and Tozer's massive Templeborough steelworks (now the Magna Science Adventure Centre) was, at its peak, over a mile (1.6 km) long, employing 10,000 workers, and housing six electric arc furnaces producing 1.8 million tonnes of steel a year. The operation closed down in 1993.\n\nJoseph Foljambe established a factory to produce his Rotherham plough, the first commercially successful iron plough.\n\nA glass works was set up in Rotherham in 1751, and became Beatson Clark & Co, one of the town's largest manufacturers, exporting glass medicine bottles worldwide. Beatson Clark & Co was a family business until 1961, when it became a public company. The glass works operated on the same site, although the family connection ceased and the company is owned by Newship Ltd, a holding company linked to the industrialist John Watson Newman. It continues to the manufacture glass containers for the pharmaceutical, food and drinks industries. In the 19th century, other successful industries included pottery, brass making and the manufacture of cast iron fireplaces. Precision manufacturing companies in the town include AESSEAL, Newburgh Engineering, Precision Magnetics, Orkot Composites and Darron Oil Tools SBO. Rotherham is the location of the Advanced Manufacturing Park (AMP).\n\nMilling grain into flour was a traditional industry in Rotherham, formerly in the Millmoor area, hence Rotherham United F.C.'s nickname \"The Millers\". Flour milling continued at the Rank Hovis town mill site on Canklow Road until September 2008. The site of the mill is a warehousing and distribution facility for Premier Foods.\n\nFloods of 2007\n\nRotherham was affected by flooding in the summer of 2007, which caused the closure of central roads, schools, transport services and damaged residential and commercial property, including the Parkgate Shopping complex and the Meadowhall Centre, which suffered considerable internal water damage. Ulley Reservoir caused major concern and forced the evacuation of thousands of homes when its dam showed signs of structural damage, threatening to break and release water into the suburbs of Treeton, Brinsworth and Canklow as well as potentially flooding the Junction 33 electrical sub-station. Rother FM evacuated its studios, passing its frequency temporarily to neighbouring station Trax FM. A stretch of the M1 motorway was closed for three days owing to the flood risk in the event of a breach of the reservoir. Fire service and police officers used thirteen high-powered pumps to lower the water level in the reservoir and reduce pressure on the dam wall, which was damaged but held. By summer 2008, the reservoir and surrounding country park reopened.\n\nA new wetland and flood storage area, Centenary Washlands, has since been built by Rotherham Council and the Environment Agency to prevent flooding in the future. Sheffield Wildlife Trust manages the site as a local nature reserve.\n\nLandmarks\n\nAll Saints Minster, on a square of the same name, was built using neat-cut pieces made of a unique sandstone, Rotherham Red, with a low-pitched lead roofing. It is a listed building in the highest category of architecture, Grade I. A Belfry was added to the church in 1501 and today the Minster houses 13 bells. A church has stood on the site since before the Norman Conquest and the current building dates from the 15th century and includes parts from earlier Saxon and Norman structures. Clayton and Bell working to George Gilbert Scott's designs constructed the east window. Stained glass makers and designers A. Gibbs, Camm Brothers, Heaton, Butler and Bayne and James Bell are known makers of the other windows. Gargoyles flank its clock on each face. It has a \"recessed octagonal spire with crocketed arrises and pinnacled shafts rising from corner faces and a gilded weathervane.\" Architectural critics Nikolaus Pevsner and Simon Jenkins considered it \"the best perpendicular [style] church in the country\" and \"the best work in the county\", respectively.\n\nClose to the town centre is the 15th-century Chapel of Our Lady of Rotherham Bridge (or \"Chapel on the Bridge\"), beside Chantry Bridge (a road bridge opened in the 1930s). It is one of four surviving bridge chapels in the country. The chapel was restored in 1923, having been used as the town jail and a tobacconist's shop.\n\nThe town was once home to Jesus College which was founded by Thomas Rotherham in the fifteenth century. The remains of the college's buildings are in the town centre, some of the earliest examples of a brick built structure remain although not accessible to the public. The gate to the College of Jesus can be found in nearby Boston Park.\n\nBoston Castle, in the grounds of Boston Park, was built as a hunting lodge by Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham between 1773 and 1774 to mark his opposition to British attempts to crush the Americans in their war for independence. It is named after Boston, Massachusetts, the scene of the Boston Tea Party.\n\nBuilt in the 18th century, Clifton House houses Clifton Park Museum.\n\nOn the outskirts of Rotherham, a brick-built glass making furnace, the Catcliffe Glass Cone, is the oldest surviving structure of its type in Western Europe and one of four remaining in the United Kingdom – the others being the Red House Cone in the Wordsley centre of the Dudley Glassworks in the West Midlands, Lemington Glass Works west of Newcastle upon Tyne and Alloa in Scotland. Threatened with demolition in the 1960s, it has been preserved as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and stands as a focal point in a sheltered housing complex and close to the path leading up the Rother valley.\n\nSouth of Maltby in the east of the district, half-way to Worksop are the ruins of Roche Abbey, among the small minority in the United Kingdom bearing multi-storey walls, as most others are no more than foundations or a single storey of ruins following the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s.\n\nEducation\n\nSee also: List of schools in Rotherham\n\nRotherham has three further education institutions and colleges. These are Thomas Rotherham College, Dearne Valley College and the Rotherham College of Arts and Technology. The Rotherham College of Arts and Technology has a campus in the Rotherham town centre and a second site in Dinnington, as well as a nearby, smaller campus for the construction-based subjects taught, such as bricklaying.\n\nGovernance\n\nSee also: Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council and Rotherham (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nThere is one main tier of local government covering Rotherham, at metropolitan borough level: Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council. The borough council is also a member of the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Mayor of South Yorkshire. Some outer parts of the built-up area of Rotherham are included in civil parishes, which form an additional tier of local government for their areas, but the central part of the built-up area is an unparished area.\n\nAdministrative history\n\nRotherham was an ancient parish. The parish was divided into eight townships, being Brinsworth, Catcliffe, Dalton, Greasbrough, Kimberworth, Orgreave, Tinsley, and a Rotherham township covering the central part of the parish including the town. Such townships were also made civil parishes in 1866.\n\nUntil 1801 the parish was governed by its vestry and manorial courts, in the same way as most rural areas. More urban forms of local government began in 1801 when a body of improvement commissioners was established for the Rotherham township, with responsibilities for paving, lighting, and repairing the streets. The commissioners were superseded in 1852 by an elected local board, whose district covered both the Rotherham and Kimberworth townships and had more extensive responsibilities, particularly relating to water supply and sewers.\n\nThe local board was in turn replaced in 1871 when Rotherham was incorporated as a municipal borough. In 1902 it was elevated to become a county borough, taking over county-level functions from West Riding County Council.\n\nThe county borough was abolished in 1974 and replaced by the larger Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, which also took in the areas of the abolished urban districts of Maltby, Rawmarsh, Swinton, and Wath upon Dearne, plus the Kiveton Park Rural District and Rotherham Rural District.\n\nThe Labour Party, have controlled the authority since the 1974 incorporation of the Metropolitan Borough. Following the 2016 CSE Scandal, the way in which local councillors are elected in Rotherham changed, replacing rolling elections, held annually with whole council elections. This change also coincided with notable boundary changes, which has marked a notable change in the political landscape of the borough. Rotherham's shadow cabinet local opposition is currently the Conservative Party with 18 the seats. Independents account for one seat.\n\nAlthough Labour retained control of the council, the Conservatives went from zero to 20 seats at the May 2021 election. Having had elections by thirds every other year. The method of election is changing to whole council elections every four years, from 2016.\n\n..... Following the report's publication, the council leader, Roger Stone of the Labour Party, resigned – an act of contrition the report said should have been made years earlier – saying he would take full responsibility for \"the historic failings described so clearly in the report.\" Labour Councillors Gwendoline Russell, Shaukat Ali and former council leader Roger Stone were suspended from the Labour Party, as was former Deputy Council Leader Jahangir Akhtar, who had lost his council seat in 2014. Chief Executive, Martin Kimber, said no council officers would face disciplinary action. Kimber announced on 8 September that he intended to step down in December 2014, and offered his \"sincere apology to those who were let down\". The council's director of children's services, Joyce Thacker, also left the authority by mutual agreement. Malcolm Newsam was appointed as Children's Social Care Commissioner in October 2014, and subsequently Ian Thomas was appointed as interim director of children's services.\n\nShaun Wright, the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for South Yorkshire from 2012, was the Labour councillor in charge of child safety at the council for five years from 2005 to 2010. He initially refused demands to resign as PCC from the Home Secretary, Theresa May, as well as members of his own party and local Labour MP Sarah Champion, saying: \"I believe I am the most appropriate person to hold this office at this current time.\" He resigned from the Labour Party on 27 August 2014, after an ultimatum by the party to either resign or face suspension from the party. Wright stood down as PCC on 16 September, saying that the prominence given to his role distracted from \"the important issue, which should be everybody's focus – the 1,400 victims outlined in the report – and in providing support to victims and bringing to justice the criminals responsible for the atrocious crimes committed against them.\"\n\nThe former Chief Constable, Meredydd Hughes, who served from 2004 to 2011 and who had unsuccessfully stood for the Labour Party nomination in the Police Crime Commissioner elections, was told by Labour MP Keith Vaz that he had 'failed' abuse victims.\n\nThe inspector, Louise Casey aided by seven assistant inspectors produced the Inspection Report on 4 February 2015. Following its conclusion that the council was not fit for purpose the minister directed that the powers of the council (RMBC) be transferred to his department and the cabinet would need to resign unless RMBC made sufficient representations within 14 days to contradict the report. The Secretary of State empowered a team of five Commissioners to replace councillors before a full election in 2016 and on the Report's strength, stated that as the authority was not currently fit for purpose its powers would not revert until the dis-empowered councillors could prove their fitness to carry out all of the council's duties without intervention. One of these commissioners was appointed to specialise in child protection.\n\nConstituencies\n\nThe Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham covers the constituencies of Rotherham (UK Parliament constituency) which has been held by the Labour Party since 1933; Wentworth and Dearne (UK Parliament constituency), held since labour from the creation of the seat in 1983; and Rother Valley (UK Parliament constituency), held by the Conservatives since the 2019 General Election, this marked the first time the Rother Valley Constituency changed colour since its inception in 1918 and first time the borough of Rotherham that anything other than a Labour MP was returned to Parliament since 1931.\n\nLike most of South Yorkshire, the Rotherham constituencies are considered to be 'safe', that is having enjoyed 'substantial' majorities over a 'long' period of time; a typecast which heightens the incumbency factor present in first past the post elections. The constituency of Rotherham, which includes all its near suburbs, has been held by Labour MPs since a by-election in 1933. After the resignation and subsequent jailing of Denis MacShane in November 2012 due to expenses abuse. The by-election in 2012 saw Sarah Champion elected.\n\nGeography\n\nThe town in great part occupies the slopes of two hills; that in the west is the start of a 3 miles (4.8 km) north-west crest topped by Keppels Column, that in the east is a narrower crest alongside the Rother known as Canklow Hill, topped by a protected formally laid out public area, Boston Park, less than 500 east of and 80 metres above the Rother. The Rother here is between 32 and 34 metres above sea level. The south scarp here is slightly higher still, the Canklow Hill Earthworks, a Scheduled Ancient Monument, one of relatively few in the borough, as pre-dating recorded history. This compares to 524 listed buildings and structures by English Heritage in the district. Samuel Lewis describing the town with its townships as having nearly 14,000 people in 1848, described the southern green slope by saying the town lies \"partly on the acclivities of an eminence...great improvements have been made within the last twenty years; in the immediate neighbourhood, several substantial and respectable dwellings have been recently built\".\n\nRotherham's commercial town centre occupies the valley in between these hills on the navigable part of the River Don flowing from the south-west after it has turned approximately due north. The town centre is less than 0.5 miles (0.80 km) below and north of the confluence of the Rother flowing from the south. The Mid Don Valley continues adjoining towns in the north of the Metropolitan Borough.\n\nBeyond the town centre and away from the Don Valley, the Rotherham district is largely rural, containing a mixture of retired people, larger properties, some farming and tourism and the landscaped Wentworth Woodhouse estate, where the last surviving kiln of the Rockingham Pottery can be seen.\n\nAside from two regular roads and two bypasses (one being the motorway network), Sheffield is connected directly by the Trans-Pennine Trail which passes the Meadowhall Shopping Centre on both sides (which between the two places) as it includes Sheffield as southern detour.\n\nRotherham Central railway station has frequent trains connecting to Sheffield in a time of 14 minutes; Manchester through a change in Sheffield is accessible in a similar circa 70 minutes to nearer Leeds and York as many towns and suburbs in South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire are all stops on Rotherham's railway – it is Doncaster which has the East Coast Main Line providing express intercity services.\n\nDistricts and suburbs of Rotherham include\n\nDemography\n\nIn 2011, Rotherham had a population of 109,691, this figure is for an urban subdivision and roughly corresponds with ward and output area boundaries. The population in 2001 was 117,262 but the figure includes Catcliffe which was a separate subdivision a decade later, so there may not have been an actual decrease in population.\n\nThe population of Rotherham is increasing slightly because 110,550 people lived in the town in 2014.\n\nRotherham compared 2011 Rotherham USD Rotherham (Borough) White British 85.6% 91.9% Asian 8.3% 4.1% Black 1.3% 0.8%\n\nIn 2011, 14.4% of Rotherham's population were non-white compared with 8.1% for the surrounding borough. Rotherham town has over double the percentage of Asian people compared with the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham and a slightly larger percentage of black people. Rotherham has a large Pakistani population.\n\nAs of 2021, the town of Rotherham's population was enumerated at 129,897, and its ethnic makeup was 86.1% White, 9% Asian, 1.7% Mixed, 1.5% Black, 1.2% Other and 0.5% Arab. The town's religious makeup was 49.2% Christian, 40.1% No Religion, 9.6% Muslim, and has small Hindu and Sikh communities.\n\nCulture and attractions\n\nMuseums\n\nThe Magna Science Adventure Centre, an interactive science and adventure centre built in a former steel works in Templeborough, has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the region.\n\nClifton Park Museum medium-sized museum in Clifton Park.
