        "text": "Edith Barlow was born at Bramley, Rotherham, in 1925 and died aged 25 being only 22\" tall and weighed 17lbs (7.72 kgs).\n\nEdith was the daughter of Mrs H Barker and Mr George Barlow.\n\nShe weighed only 1.1/2lbs when born and was raised on brandy and water.\n\nUp to the age of 6 months, Edith was wrapped in cotton wool soaked in olive oil.\n\nA specialist saw Edith at the age of two and told her mother that she had been 'wonderful to keep her', suggesting she should not keep her after the age of three.\n\nEdith suffered with bronchitis and was double jointed in both arms and legs.\n\nEdith was otherwise normally developed physically and mentally.\n\nHer education set a major problem for she could not be accepted as a pupil at a Rotherham school since it was said she would distract the attention of other pupils.\n\nAs ratepayers, her family were far from satisfied with this state of affairs.\n\nHowever, while staying for periods with her grandmother at Bolton, Edith managed to obtain some schooling.\n\nShe had, in fact, progressed so far as to be able to use a typewriter. It was while staying at Bolton during 1947 that she became interested in show business and joined a travelling fair, visiting Newcastle, Bradford and other towns.\n\nHer mother, who travelled with her, shared the same trailer caravan.\n\nMrs Parker was a normal sized woman, who's husband was sturdily built and six feet tall.\n\nIn 1948 Edith again appeared at fairs in the sema show, chiefly in the nort and midland areas.\n\nHer employer was Mr John White jnr of Doncaster.\n\nEdith's sisters told of occasions when she was taken to Rotherham cinemas and attendants requested the 'grown up' accompanying her not to let 'that child' occupy a seat but to keep her on her knee!\n\nThe reactions of Edith, who loved a cigarette now and then and the occasional guinnes her doctor prescribed for her, were not difficult to imagine.\n\nIn August 1948, her colleagues moved on from Southend.\n\nWhere? not even her sisters knew until they received a letter.\n\nEdith died in Newcastle, she was taken to hospital but said \"the show must go on\" and died in her caravan at town moor.\n\nAt the time, her address was given as Vernon Road, Broom, Rotherham."
