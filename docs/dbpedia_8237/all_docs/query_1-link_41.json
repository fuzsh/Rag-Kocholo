        "text": "Family Fostercare South Yorkshire\n\nLocation and Catchment Area\n\nOur friendly fostering team at Family Fostercare Doncaster work with foster carers and children throughout South Yorkshire, including Doncaster, Barnsley, Rotherham and Sheffield.\n\nOur Doncaster office is at Apex Office Space, 1 Watervole Way, Balby, Doncaster, DN4 5JP.\n\nOffice Background\n\nOur Doncaster office officially opened its doors on 1st July 2016. Over the course of 2014 and 2015 our South Yorkshire circle of foster carers had grown steadily, supported by our fostering team at our main Yorkshire office in Beverley. During a support group meeting towards the end of 2015, our foster carers from the South of the county told us it would be great for them to have support closer to home. We listened and immediately set about finding premises, preparing the office for business and finding a great, dedicated fostering team to ensure that our foster carers in the area would continue to receive the same level of care and support tailored to their individual needs that has become one of our trademarks.\n\nHow We Work\n\nFamily Fostercare's ethos is to deliver fostering with a family feel, and our friendly, close-knit fostering team in Yorkshire definitely achieve that. We are passionate about putting children and foster carers first, about recognising each individual and tailoring what we do to suit the needs of everyone in the foster family.\n\nYou can find more information about us including our Ofsted Report, Statement of Purpose and other important documents in our online documents library.\n\nFostering Enquiries\n\nWe welcome enquiries from anyone over the age of 25, living in the South Yorkshire area who is interested in finding out more about fostering: from eligibility to finances, to what to expect and the training to become a foster carer. If this sounds like you, please get in touch with us today. We'll send you a helpful Introduction to Fostering information pack, and then if you're still interested in finding out more we'll arrange to visit you in your home to talk it over and answer your questions in person. You are welcome to call Caroline on 01302 910215 or 07709 298674, or just use the form to request your Fostering Information pack today!\n\nIf you'd rather meet in person then why not come along to one of our Could You Foster Open Days? We hold these informal, friendly open-office events regularly with full details posted here on our website and on our Facebook page. Martin Rae, our founding director is available to chat with visitors about what makes Family Fostercare special, there's lots of information to take away with you, and there may also be the chance for you to meet some of our experienced foster carers to hear first hand about what it is like to be a foster carer. We'd love to see you so please feel free to come along, perhaps even bring some friends and find out about fostering together. And of course if you have younger children who aren't at school yet that's no problem, there'll be a friendly Family Fostercare welcome for them too!"
