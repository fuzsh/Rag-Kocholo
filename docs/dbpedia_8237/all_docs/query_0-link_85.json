        "text": "Bill started his cricket career in the early 1960s as a junior at Sheffield United CC, playing on the famous old Bramall Lane ground. Playing primarily in the second and third teams up until 1965, he was also selected for the Sheffield & District under 18s and was asked to attend Yorkshire nets in 1964 and 1965.\n\nBetween 1966 and 1974, Bill played for a number of clubs, including Rotherham Town in the Yorkshire League, Brighouse in the Bradford League, and Elland in the Huddersfield League. During these years, he also played Sunday friendly cricket for the now-defunct Sheffield Cutlers, alongside some of the best players in South Yorkshire – a team he describes as, ‘a great place to learn how to play cricket.’\n\nIn 1975, Bill joined Sheffield Collegiate, where he had already played friendly and mid-week cricket. There, in the Yorkshire League, he earned a complete collection of innings wicket-taking performances, from none through to ten – taking ten wickets against Hull in 1987 and nine against Rotherham in 1979. Other career highlights were winning the Yorkshire League bowling averages in 1984; his Wombwell Cricket Lovers Match Winning Award in 1986 for taking seven wickets for eight runs to beat Barnsley; and helping Collegiate to their first Yorkshire League silverware – a cup and league double in his final season of 1990.\n\nBill was equally effective off the field, serving on the committee of Sheffield Collegiate for all but one year of his time at the club, holding positions including fund-raiser, treasurer and Yorkshire League representative. For several years in the late 1990s, he served on the board of the Sheffield Amateur Sports Club and he was the groundsman for the Abbeydale Sports Club in 2008 and 2009. Even after retiring to Devon in 2012 he found himself helping out the local club as their treasurer for four years.\n\nWhilst he was a fiery competitor in his playing days, Bill always enjoyed the social side of the game and he remains great company over a beer in the clubhouse on his regular visits to South Yorkshire. He places great value on the friendships he has made with both team mates and opposition during his long career.\n\nBill was a pro-active and ‘hands-on’ President of the Yorkshire League between 2008 and 2011, during which time his balanced and forward-thinking approach earned him great respect.\n\nBill Croft was inducted to the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 27th October 2017.\n\nHe started his career playing with his father Tony at Upper Haugh Cricket Club, where he won recognition for Yorkshire Schools in 1983, 1984 and 1985 at under 13,14 and 15 levels. In 1986, at the age of 16, he moved to Rotherham Town, making his Yorkshire League debut that same season. Apart from a very brief spell with Yorkshire Bank in the Bradford League in 1990, he stayed at Rotherham Town until 1992. In that last season he took over 60 wickets, forming a redoubtable opening partnership with Nick Cowan that led the club to the Yorkshire League championship. Then, in 1993, Andy moved to Lacelles Hall in the Huddersfield League, helping the club to the league title that year, and taking over 50 league wickets in both his seasons at the club.\n\nAndy started his 23-season association with the Wickersley club in 1995, joining the club as captain and winning the South Yorkshire championship in that first season. A further six South Yorkshire league championships followed in the next ten seasons, during which time Andy also captained his side to three Whitworth Cup and two Yorkshire Council Championship successes. A fierce competitor on the field, Andy always liked to finish every match with a pint and some banter with his contemporaries.\n\nDuring his career, Andy has played many games with his brother, Richard, and has introduced his two sons to the game – both of whom are now playing at Wickersley. He has remained on the Wickersley committee since his captaincy days, also taking over as groundsman from father Tony, winning the Groundsman of the Year award in the inaugural season of the Yorkshire South Premier League in 2016.\n\nAndy played an important part in the negotiations leading to the formation of the Yorkshire South Premier League, and was asked to join the newly-formed League committee in 2015, to which he has since contributed enormously with his experience, knowledge and common sense.\n\nAndy Harrison was inducted into the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 27th October 2017.\n\nApart from a two-year stint at Hickleton Main, Stuart’s cricketing career was spent as a batsman at Conisbrough Cricket Club, during which time he won the club’s Young Player of the Year award. A loss of form and interest led to his early retirement on 1980, but former international football referee Ernie Crawford, himself also a cricket umpire, persuaded him to try umpiring. This led to him joining the Doncaster & District Umpires Association in 1984, where he soon became regarded as a very good umpire, and he was accepted onto the Yorkshire County Premier League panel in 1988.\n\nStuart’s calm, unflappable and quietly authoritative on-field demeanour; his methodical and organised approach; his consistency and sound decision-making soon made him one of the League’s most respected umpires. He umpired the Yorkshire League Knock-Out Cup final in 1998 and 2006, and stood in the League’s first t20 final in 2011. He was twice the Yorkshire League Umpire of the Year and was recognised by Yorkshire CCC, for whom he umpired second XI matches between 2001 and 2004. He had the honour of being selected to umpire an England XI v Yorkshire t20 game at Headingley in 2005, in front of a 17,000 crowd and TV cameras, but unfortunately a deluge caused the game to be abandoned without a ball bowled.\n\nWhen the Yorkshire League was split as a result of the reorganisation of premier league cricket in the county after the 2015 season, Stuart was its longest serving umpire. Since then he has served on the newly-inaugurated Yorkshire Leagues umpires panel. He is arguably the best official produced by the county never to have stood in the first-class game.\n\nStuart was the chairman of the Yorkshire League Umpires Association between 2002 and 2015, and was both chairman and training officer of the Doncaster & District Umpires Association until 2016. He has now completed a remarkable 30 years as a Premier League umpire.\n\nStuart Roberts was inducted into the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 27th October 2017.\n\nAs a relatively late-comer to the game, the 16-year old Nick began to establish himself at Doncaster Town in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. He was introduced to the club by his father, former Yorkshire CCC player Mike Cowan, who was then captain at Town Fields. As a junior player, he learned much from Doncaster stalwart Les Ranns, and then, under the captaincy of Tony Craven, made rapid progress in the first team.\n\nIt was difficult for Nick to follow in his father’s illustrious footsteps and try to emulate his success. Try as he did, despite attracting interest from county sides, including a spell at Somerset where he learned from the likes of Joel Garner and Ian Botham, he was unable to make the breakthrough into the county game. Despite that, he went on to forge one of the most successful league cricket careers.\n\nA feared opening bowler, who was a consistent performer and wicket taker, he was also an outstanding captain. Fiercely competitive by example, his leadership and man management skills were second to none. He was a great tactician with an ability to read the game, that led to some remarkable victories and achievements, and he brought the best of talented young players like Simon Widdup and Richard Dawson.\n\nAfter his first spell at Doncaster, he moved on and enjoyed further success with Rotherham Phoenix, Elsecar and Rotherham Town, captaining the latter to the Yorkshire League championship in 1992. Returning then to Doncaster, he repeated his Rotherham feat by captaining the Town Fields side to Yorkshire League championship success.\n\nBut his greatest achievement was when, in August 1998, he led Doncaster Town to Lords, where they beat Bath in the final of the Abbot Ale cup – the forerunner of today’s national club knock-out.\n\nOpposing batsmen remember Nick with the greatest respect. His reputation for being tough on the field of play was matched only by his willingness to share a drink with his opponents after the game.\n\nRetaining his passion for Doncaster Town CC and Premier League cricket, he is a very important part of the Doncaster club. He is always available to share his great knowledge of the game, and is always seen supporting his team on the Yorkshire South Premier League circuit.\n\nNick Cowan was inducted into the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 9th November 2018.\n\nRichard was born into a Barnsley cricketing family in 1977, with both his father and grandfather being keen cricketers. He joined Barnsley CC as a junior at age 11, and after playing for Barnsley schools and Yorkshire Schoolboys, he made his Yorkshire League debut at 15 years old. Richard then came to the attention of the county club and joined their Academy at 16, playing under the coaching of Arnie Sidebottom at Bradford Park Avenue.\n\nHaving started his cricketing life primarily as a batsman, he had by this time developed his off-break bowling, and could truly be termed as an all-rounder. In 1996, playing for the Yorkshire Academy, he won the Yorkshire League junior bowling award. At 19, he became a junior professional at YCCC, but the fierce competition at Headingley meant that he was restricted to a single first class appearance and four one day matches.\n\nNonetheless, Richard enjoyed a hugely successful career in league cricket. At the end of his stint with the Academy, he joined reigning Bradford League champions Bradford and Bingley in 1999, before returning to Barnsley in 2002. He then helped his home town club to their first Yorkshire League championship in 2006, a glorious season in which they also won the Heavy Woollen Cup in 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he left Barnsley again, this time when he was appointed to manage the Yorkshire Academy. He captained their Yorkshire League side for two seasons, passing on his experience and knowledge to budding county players.\n\nRichard returned to Barnsley in 2009 and the following season was the Yorkshire League’s joint top wicket-taker with an impressive 82 victims. He then captained the club to victory in the 2012 Yorkshire League t20 tournament before moving on in search of a new challenge with Hoylandswaine. In his four years with the Huddersfield League side, he also won the League, the League Cup, the League t20 twice and the Black Sheep trophy while not as captain.\n\nIn 2017, Richard joined Whitley Hall in the Yorkshire South Premier League, where he finished both his seasons as the club’s top bowler in the League averages. Towards the end of the 2018 season, Richard announced that he would be bringing down the curtain on his playing career.\n\nThroughout his playing days, Richard had a twinkle in his eye, was always ready with a witty one-liner and liked a joke – but his sense of humour was never at the expense of a hugely competitive streak and will to win. He played the game as it is supposed to be – hard but fair, and usually with a smile on his face. Our grounds will be the poorer on Saturday afternoons without his presence on them.\n\nRichard will still be involved in the game, however. He will continue in his day job with the Yorkshire Cricket Board, as Cricket Development Manager for North Yorkshire and Teeside. This involves working with the 215 clubs in the north of the county, passing on his vast experience, and helping them to lay foundations that will enable them to create sustainability, and run effectively and successfully in the long term.\n\nRichard Wilkinson was inducted into the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 9th November 2018.\n\nAs an opening bowler and hard-hitting lower middle order batsman, Harry played for 25 years for Cresswell Colliery in the Bassetlaw League. Before the introduction of Premier Leagues, the Bassetlaw League was a very strong league containing some of the best sides in Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire; and Harry was very proud to win its’ top division bowling averages in 1975.\n\nAfter Cresswell, Harry moved on to Sandiacre Town for the last 16 years of his playing career, and it was there that, as one of three senior players looking after the young players in the second XI, that his umpiring career started. They decided that only one of the three would play each week, and Harry joined the Bassetlaw League supplementary list so that he could umpire when not playing.\n\nBy this stage, Harry’s old Cresswell opening bowler partner, George Wood, was umpiring in the Yorkshire League. When Harry passed his umpiring exams, George recommended him to the League. Harry made his debut at Appleby Frodingham in a game against Sheffield Collegiate in 2003, and after standing in a handful of games in that and the following season, Harry joined the Yorkshire League list full time in 2005. By this time, Harry had been appointed to the ‘D list’, which meant that he was also standing in county second XI games.\n\nHaving been made redundant from the Coal Board in 1997, and working as a volunteer ambulance service driver, Harry had plenty of time for umpiring, and he became a regular fixture with Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire seconds, even having a season with Yorkshire seconds. Harry also regularly umpired England ladies team until, two years after the normal retirement age of 70, he came off the D list at the end of 2017.\n\nHarry Fidler was inducted into the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 8th November 2019.\n\nIt was when he moved into the then South Riding League that his umpiring career career took off, leading him onto the Minor Counties List, the ECB 38 County Competition Panel, three Yorkshire Area Village Knock-Out finals and the latter stages of the National Club KO Competition. Before retiring from active umpiring in 2018, he had stood in over 1,200 games, and he is now an umpires’ observer and mentor to new and young umpires, always ready to pass on his knowledge and experience.\n\nBut has been Terry's ‘off the field’ work that will have the longest benefits to the world of umpiring. As chairman of the South Yorkshire branch of the Association of Cricket Officials, his main achievements have been in the area of recruitment, where he has worked tirelessly to entice new members into the umpiring fold; improving umpiring standards through a programme of training, mentoring and progression; and supporting and mentoring many umpires now established in league cricket.\n\nTerry has also made a huge contribution to the administration of league cricket in South Yorkshire, becoming chief executive and later chairman of the South Yorkshire Senior Cricket League. In this latter role, he played a big part in the establishment of the Yorkshire South Premier League, and he has been honoured by being appointed as one of the first two Ambassadors of the Yorkshire Cricket Southern Premier League.\n\nFor many years, Terry has been associated with Darfield CC, and was instrumental in a great period of success for the club when, as cricket manager, he oversaw a period in which the club won the South Yorkshire championship seven years running between 1984 and 1990.\n\nTerry is a larger-than-life character, epitomised by his enthusiasm for, and commitment to, the world of cricket, his impish sense of humour and his blunt outspokenness. In many ways, South Yorkshire cricket has been his life - he has put his heart and soul into it, and it has been much enriched by his presence.\n\nIn that time, he has fulfilled the roles of player, captain, secretary, treasurer, groundsman and coach – and has played a big part in pulling the club through some very difficult times. His commitment to the development of juniors has been responsible for perhaps his biggest achievement – putting in place the junior structure that serves the club so well. More recently, he has helped to establish a thriving womens’ and girls’ section at the club.\n\nIain still plays for Millhouses; turning out happily for whichever team in which he is selected. A stylish stroke player, he has always been most pleasing on the spectator’s eye, and with a bit more selfishness might have scored even more runs than he has – which perhaps would have been a fairer reflection of his abilities. He has also done more than his fair share of the close-in fielding ‘under the bonnet’ duties.\n\nIain has been the club secretary for around 15 years and groundsman for a similar period. Like many of his brethren, he takes his duties on the ground very seriously, and is a fully qualified member of the groundsmens’ association.\n\nMost recently, his persistence and tenacity was pivotal in getting the club’s new pavilion project off the ground. Work is now in progress, and the club hope to start 2022 with a fantastic new facility in place.\n\nOutside Millhouses, he has become a qualified umpire; a member of the Ben Jessop Junior League committee, looking after the League’s Play-Cricket site; and a former secretary of the Yorkshire & Derbyshire League.\n\nA solicitor by occupation, Iain is affable, approachable and a good networker – cultivating strong links with the YCB to ensure that the club can take advantage of any help available to them. He is also a keen golfer, likes the odd glass of red wine, and enjoys his Thai food.\n\n‘Shep’ Mallett’s name is synonymous with Millhouses Works CC – he really is the type of person every club needs.\n\nIn 1965, Milton was instrumental in founding the Sheffield Carbbean Sports Club in Crooksmoor, and later moving to Athelstan School. Milton then formed Caribbean Sports CC in 1967 – and has effectively run the club ever since. Initially playing in the Norton League, Caribbean progressed through the Sheffield and Alliance Leagues to the SYSCL.\n\nMilton subsequently obtained grants to purchase the current ground, which had formerly been a works sports club. He is now responsible for a project to build a new pavilion on the ground.\n\nHe has now served the club for over 50 years as player, captain, scorer and senior and junior teams manager. During this time, he has devoted countless hours to encouraging and coaching young talent; he became a father figure to many and inspires respect and affection in equal measure. Almost certainly his most famous alumnus is former Derbyshire, Northamptonshire and England pace bowler Devon Malcolm.\n\nAs a player, Milton was an off-spinning all-rounder and if perhaps not the greatest player from the Caribbean to grace these shores, there have been none more dedicated or long-serving – he hung up his boots only a few years back. He is a natural leader, and he was an excellent captain. A disciplinarian, he insists on everything being done properly, and on good behaviour – once dispatching a recalcitrant fielder back to the pavilion in a cup tie.\n\nWhilst cricket is his first love, Milton has also run the Caribbean Sports football team until the last couple of years, enabling the provision of sporting opportunity for the community throughout the year.\n\nOutside sport, Milton worked in the probation service for 35 years before retirement, in his later years specialising in race, diversity and community engagement issues. He has been a volunteer worker with Sheffield SADACCA – a community voluntary organisation that provides healthcare, intermediary and support services for the local community, particularly those from African and Caribbean backgrounds.\n\n‘Sam’ is one of the ‘good guys’ – approachable, affable, and laid back. He is widely respected throughout the South Yorkshire cricket community for his selfless dedication to the game, and is rightly known to many simply as ‘Mr Caribbean.’\n\nWhen the YCSPL set up an Equity & Diversity Group earlier this year, Milton was the obvious choice as its’ leader. Several honours have come his way over the years, the most prestigious being his OBE – recognising his huge contribution to BME sport in Sheffield.\n\nMark then came to the attention of Derbyshire CCC, and in his first season with the Peakites, 1987, he played in eight County Championship games, taking 12 wickets with best bowling figures of 4-68 and in that season’s victorious 1987 second XI Bain Dawes Trophy campaign, where he took four wickets against Hampshire in the final. He was not to play in the first team again after that season, but continued to play successfully in the second XI.\n\nDuring this time, he moved to Rotherham Town, whom he captained to a Yorkshire League Cup win in 1987. After that he became club professional for Hanging Heaton, which was the start of an eight-year period of league and cup success in the Bradford League, that also took in spells at East Bierley and Idle.\n\nA season as professional at Kexborough in 2000 was followed by two successful seasons with Brighouse in the Huddersfield League before he returned to Barnsley in 2003. At the time, Barnsley were struggling, but Mark played a huge part in rebuilding the club, and was part of the first team that won the Yorkshire League for the first time in 2006 – a glorious year in which all junior and senior teams in the club won their leagues and the club also won the Heavy Woollen Cup.\n\nThroughout his career, Mark always played with wholehearted commitment; he was a ferocious competitor who played the game hard and with a never-say-die spirit and an unflagging will to win. He is proud to jointly hold the Yorkshire League ninth-wicket partnership record, putting on 113 with Rayon Griffith to steer his side to an improbable victory over Scarborough.\n\nA qualified level 3 coach, he is currently the head coach at Shaw Lane, and his coaching career includes being Pathways Lead Coach in South Yorkshire, and in 2008 assistant coach to the Isle of Man team that won the silver medal in the ICC European Championship in La Manga.\n\nAs vice-chairman of the executive and cricket committees at Shaw Lane, roles he is hugely proud to hold, Mark oversaw the amalgamation of Barnsley CC and Woolley CC into what is now known as Barnsley Woolley Miners. He is also the club Facilities Chair, overseeing the clubhouse and ground at the Woolley site. It is fair to say is the heartbeat of Barnsley Woolley Miners CC.\n\nMark served on the committees of the Yorkshire League and the Yorkshire South Premier League, and has now completed a two-year spell as Head of Premier Section in the YCSPL. To all his committee work, he always brings his enthusiasm for, and commitment to, cricket; his forthrightness and honesty; his vast experience; and an innate ability to contribute fresh ideas.\n\nPeter holds the record for the highest score in the South Yorkshire League by an amateur player at Oakes, with 155 against Coal Aston, and was a key part of the teams won the South Riding B division undefeated in 1978, the Tuby Cup in 1981, the Whitworth Cup in 1995, and the Mick Savage Memorial Trophy in 1996. He is widely regarded at Norton Oakes as the best amateur batsman the club has had in living memory.\n\nIn addition to his long and distinguished playing career, Peter has held every position at the Oakes Park club, most notably as secretary, safeguarding officer, and junior coach, and has served on the club committee for many years.\n\nSince slowing down his playing commitments in recent seasons, Peter has given back an enormous amount to the club, setting up their All Stars and, later, Dynamos programmes single-handedly; visiting schools in the local area, getting parental volunteers and player involvement to make it one of the most successful schemes in Yorkshire. He has been for well over a decade a qualified Level 2 coach and has led the club’s junior coaching. From juniors, he has now branched out into developing the womens’ game at Norton Oakes, driving the establishment of a women’s and girls’ team by giving up more of his time to facility practice and encouraging participation from initially reluctant parents, aunties, and sisters.\n\nPeter has also put considerable time and energy into obtaining a number of grants for the club over the last few years, including one to compensate for Covid restrictions.\n\nNorton Oakes’ secretary Stephen Cook says, “It is fair say that without Pete’s sustained commitment and energy, Norton Oakes would certainly not be the club it is today.”\n\nThroughout his 42 seasons with the club, he has produced many amazing performances – mainly through his medium-quick right-arm bowling but with some capable batting performances, even the odd century, thrown in.\n\nFor many years, on most Saturdays he would bowl 23 overs consecutively, as bowlers could in those days, with incredible accuracy – performances that in some years almost single-handedly kept Wath in the top division of the SRL and its successor, the South Yorkshire Senior Cricket League.\n\nSuch is his accuracy, that older club members swear that he last bowled a full toss in 1985 - against Ralph Swindells of Darfield, who hit it for four through midfield wicket.\n\nWith no Play-Cricket coverage in the 1980s and 90s, it is difficult to give precise stats, but Mark has certainly bowled well over 10,000 overs and taken well over 1,100 wickets for the club at a remarkable economy rate of just over two runs per over. Whilst in the A section, he achieved his best bowling figures, of 9-17 in a game at Whiston, also taking over 50 wickets in a season several more times. He has twice gone through a full season with an economy rate of less than two runs per over in the SYSCL top division, and, now in the latter part of his career, has bowled over 100 maidens in each of the last two seasons for Wath 2nds.\n\nMark has been recognised by Yorkshire Over-50s on numerous occasions, and made some important contributions to the Yorkshire team that won the National Championships in 2018. ‘Jocky’, as he is known to teammates and friends, has also been selected for England Over-50s, with whom he has toured Sri Lanka and playing for his country in South Africa in the last over-50s World Cup.\n\nHe soon made his senior debut in the third team but, such was his talent, he swiftly moved into the second team, where he cemented his position in the middle order. Runs came freely and he was considered regularly for the first team, which at the time was a strong well-established team, holding its own in the South Riding League top division. He played occasionally through the early 80’s, before becoming a first-team regular in 1983.\n\nIt was at this time that he emerged as a part-time bowler, a role that would develop in his later career, and also led to his on-field nickname of ‘Chukker’.\n\n‘Clay’ held his place in the first team for 30 years, before standing aside to allow younger players an opportunity. However, he continued to play for the second team until 2017, when he officially retired; although he has played the odd game since to help out, his last being in 2022. In all, he has represented the Frecheville Community club over six decades.\n\nIn his playing career, he captained the first team between 1998 and 2009, capturing three ‘B’ Division titles, and also captaining the mid-week Alliance team. Clay has scored well over 20,000 runs, including five hundreds with a top score of 182 not out, and has taken over 300 wickets, with a best bowling return of 7 for 29.\n\nArguably his crowning performance and probably the reason he retired was a ‘Man of the Match’ performance in the Billy Oates Memorial Cup final triumph of 2017, where he scored 95 and took 3-27 – not at all bad for a 54-year old!\n\nOff the field, Clay has been a member of the Frecheville cricket committee since 1985, taking over the position of chairman in 2009 after the passing of Roger Hobson. He is also one the cricket representatives on the clubs Sports & Social Committee.\n\nClay has worked as a groundsman at the Hobson Bowl for 20 years, assisting the previous groundsman Brian Hobson until the latter’s retirement in 2014, when he took over the post of Head Groundsman.\n\nAlways a pleasant, popular and approachable person to young and old alike, someone who always played hard but fair, and was well-respected and liked by his opponents.\n\nAll he has done in cricket has been done voluntarily, simply for the love of his club and the game. He is undoubtedly one of cricket’s unsung heroes, without whom, cricket, and in particular, Frecheville Community CC, would be in a worse place.\n\nStarting out at Wombwell Main CC, Martin made his senior debut at 12. As a youngster, he also represented the Wombwell Cricket Lovers, the South Yorkshire Joe Lumb side and Yorkshire Senior Schools.\n\nMoving to Barnsley CC in 1967 to play Yorkshire League cricket, Martin was in the Yorkshire CCC set-up under coach Arthur Mitchell. He became Barnsley CC captain in 1975 and remained so for the next 12 seasons, leading them to the Yorkshire League Cup success in 1981, thus adding to his two earlier YL Cup wins with the club. Former Barnsley CC player Andy Watts says, “He always kept a watchful eye over us youngsters after he had won or saved the game with either bat or ball”.\n\nIn 1987, Martin joined Sheffield Collegiate, and for the next 14 seasons was a member of an extremely successful club and part of a side that won everything that there is to win in club cricket; seven Yorkshire League titles, three more Yorkshire League Cups and the National Knock-Out Cup in 2000, after which he called time on his career…… or so he thought. On his time at Sheffield Collegiate, former team-mate David Jones says, “He is simply the best league cricketer I have known, competitive as they come, and a great bloke.”\n\nBut the lure of over-50s cricket, and the opportunity to return to Barnsley CC to close the circle, proved too strong and he returned to Shaw Lane as captain for the 2001 season, playing until 2005, and helping to build a side that would win the club’s first Yorkshire League title in 2006.\n\nHighlights of his Yorkshire League career included four wickets in one over for Sheffield Collegiate against Harrogate), 8-23 against Hull, a handful of centuries including 102 not out against a very strong Scarborough side, two hat-tricks in the 1997 season, and, at a conservative estimate, well in excess of 10,000 runs and 1,000 wickets in a 37-year career in the Yorkshire League.\n\nMartin enjoyed the privilege of playing with and against some of the finest test cricketers of his generation, including playing alongside Geoff Boycott, Martin Moxon (with whom he opened the batting), Michael Vaughan and Ian Bishop (with whom he opened the bowling), and against the likes of Fred Trueman, Martin Crowe and Mark Greatbatch.\n\nSince then, he has played senior representative cricket for Yorkshire and England, with the highlights being winning the County Championship in 2006, back-to-back wins in the ‘grey Ashes’, as England over-60s won both at home and away, and four tours to the West Indies with the Yorkshire Seniors.\n\nSteve’s dad, John, a Treeton stalwart, introduced him to the club, where he played for under-13s at nine and was in the first team at 15. At just 17, he moved to East Bierley in the Bradford League, and it was there that as a result of playing so much cricket so young he suffered two broken bones in his back. In a close-season operation he had two metal pins were inserted that are there to this day. The following season, he moved on to play in the Yorkshire League with Sheffield Collegiate. After a year at Abbeydale, he made the trip north to Barnsley, where he played for two seasons before returning to the Bradford League to play for Spen Victoria. In 1992, he moved on to Gomersal in the Central Yorkshire League, where he spent eight highly successful seasons. Then, in 2000, he returned to the Bradford League to play for Hanging Heaton.\n\nBy the time he returned to Treeton in 2003, Steve had won league titles and every major cup competition, including the Black Sheep Yorkshire Champions Trophy. He marked his return by taking 10-44 against Sheffield Collegiate II. Then, in 2006, he topped the league batting and bowling averages – only the second player ever to do so – in the process helping Treeton to win the SYSCL title for only the second time. In 2006 he recorded his highest score of 206 not out against Houghton Main and, in 2015, he helped Treeton to win a place in the newly-formed Yorkshire South Premier League. In all, since his return to Treeton, he has scored over 14,000 runs at an average of 56 and has taken 821 wickets at an average of just over 11.57.\n\nIn addition to his feats at club level, Steve played seven games for Yorkshire seconds between 1992 and 1993, scoring three half-centuries, as well as 151 against Kent. He played List A cricket for the Yorkshire Cricket Board, Northumberland and Cumberland, taking 25 wickets in his nine List A matches at an average of 10.24. He played 72 times for England Amateurs between 1995 and 2004, captaining the side from 1999 to 2004, during which time the team won back-to-back European championships in 2002 and 2004.\n\nSteve has now completed 16 seasons with his home-town club and is in the latter stages of an outstanding career in which he is widely considered one of the best players not to have played at first class level for his county.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, Frank, Bob joined Cleethorpes as a highly talented junior. His talent as a batsman soon emerged, and, after graduating from Nottingham University with a degree in geography, he returned to Cleethorpes to take up a teaching career.\n\nHe was a member of a talented group of players who went on to win the Lincolnshire County Cricket League Championships 11 times between 1967 and 1983. In 1984, the club was invited to join the Yorkshire League and, although never winning the league during Bob's playing days, he played a leading role in making the club a highly respected force. He was club captain between 1977 and 1980, then again 1987 to 1989, and finally 1999.\n\nThanks to his very understanding wife, Pauline, it is difficult to remember Bob ever missing a game – whether league or the then regular Sunday friendlies against strong visiting teams. He must be a member of a very select band of club players who have scored more than 35,000 runs – a testament to his loyalty, longevity, dedication – and, above all, his talent.\n\nBob has always had Cleethorpes at heart, not just being satisfied with his batting successes but on the administrative side as well. At the time of his induction, he was in his second spell as cricket chairman at Cleethorpes CC and was one of the club's four Trustees. Bob has played a huge part in the development of the club, both on and off the field; his attention to detail ensures that no stone is left unturned and that the club is up-to-date in all areas of administration. He also served on the committee of the former Yorkshire League.\n\nBob Leafe was inducted into the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 27th October 2017.\n\nDennis started scoring for Appleby Frodingham’s first team in 1958 when he stood in for the regular scorer. He gradually officiated at more and more matches and, in 1962, he took over as the official first team scorer. Initially, Dennis scored for the club in its’ Yorkshire Council years up to 1965, then between 1966 and 1993 in the Lincolnshire League, and finally 22 seasons in the Yorkshire League between 1994 and 2015. In addition to the first team matches, Dennis scored in Sunday friendlies, innumerable mid-week games, and for the third team in Sunday matches.\n\nPatient and meticulous in the scorebox, Dennis's dedication, good humour and loyalty made him popular with fellow scorers, umpire and players alike. Dennis's scoring style was typified by his immaculate hand-writing, using coloured pencils to denote the balls bowled by different bowlers and faced by different batsmen, all with times of the start and end of innings and falls of wicket conscientiously noted. Thankfully, all his scorebooks are now preserved in the club’s archive.\n\nAfter 58 years of scoring, 54 as official first team scorer, Dennis retired from his position at the end of the 2015 season. At 80 years of age, the introduction of computerised scoring was a step too far – he has a passionate hatred of computers! In all, his friends and colleagues estimate that he has scored in an incredible 3,000 plus matches.\n\nAfter his retirement, he was recognised by the Yorkshire Cricket Board and the Lincolnshire League, and the scorebox at the club’s ground at Brumby Hall was named in his honour.\n\nDennis Wadd, who was inducted into the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 27th October 2017, sadly passed away on 18th September 2022.\n\nKeith's parents had a great influence on his life, of which Treeton CC has aleays been a big part. His father, Ron, worked at Orgreave coking plant, and in his leisure time spent hours working on the Treeton ground; whilst his mother, Eileen, was an integral member of the team of tea-ladies.\n\nKeith started work for the NCB after leaving school in 1965, and earned a BSc degree in mining engineering from the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne in 1973. He became a respected figure in the mining industry, ultimately as Deputy Manager at Kiveton Park Colliery. Whilst in Newcastle, Keith played for Stamfordham CC, but on returning to South Yorkshire he resumed his playing career at Treeton.\n\nFrom 1987, when he took on the role of club chairman, he started to exert a profound influence on the club. He put into practice the methodology and skills gleaned from his university experience and work in the Coal Industry. Throughout his 31-year tenure, his strong values have spurred him on, and he has upheld a much loved and respected family name. The will to work hard and succeed on and off the field is hard-wired in Keith’s DNA.\n\nDuring his tenure as club chairman, Keith has led four major building and construction developments at the ground – clubhouse development from a shed to its present form; the elevated spectator viewing areas in front of the clubhouse; a new scoreboard and machinery store; and new two-lane cricket nets. In addition, he has overseen projects to delivery of a new irrigation and sprinkler system around the square, and fencing to help protect adjacent properties. To complete these works, he has led several successful grant bids. He has been an active supporter of junior and ladies, resulting in the club supporting eight teams at different age groups.\n\nThe recently-built machinery store enabled Keith to progress his policy of upgrading the ground machinery, including high quality cutters, scarification equipment, tractor, roller and much more. As a result, the club was able to overcome the withdrawal of council ground support and took control of its own destiny. His enthusiasm for improving the facilities continues unabated, and his current project is to enlarge the clubhouse bar, cellar & kitchen facilities.\n\nKeith has also overseen a sustained period of development on the field, including four Yorkshire Council championships, eight South Yorkshire League championships, four Whitworth Cup wins and promotion to the newly-formed YSPL in 2016. To achieve this, he has helped the club to field many overseas professionals, whilst remaining committed to developing the potential of homegrown players.\n\nHe is also chairman of the trustees of the charity that owns the playing fields used by the club and has held many positions in South Yorkshire cricket, where he has become respected for his balanced and knowledgeable input.\n\nAll of Keith’s work for the club is characterised by his dogged determination – he leads by example and never gives up; his thoughtfulness – he always recognises the effort put in by other volunteers; and his responsibility – he always has the club’s interests at heart and never shirks a challenge. His understanding of how to manage, retain and get the best out of the club’s army of volunteers has been crucial to the development of the club.\n\nIt is a testimony to Keith’s dedication and efforts that Treeton Cricket Club are today one of the leading cricket clubs in South Yorkshire.\n\nKeith Haynes was inducted into the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 9th November 2018.\n\nMatt’s history with Sheffield Collegiate CC goes back to his schooldays at Birkdale College, and he returned to the club from Winchester College and the London School of Economics. Collegiate were a strong team in those days, and were well served in the spin bowling department through the likes of Richard Ibbotson, John Hespe, and later Rob Barlow and Jim Tasker, and Matt had to be very patient in waiting for his chance in the first team. Even when, on an early first team appearance in July 2006, Matt took 7-42 against Doncaster, he was left out for the following game when regular players returned.\n\nHis big opportunity came in 2007, by which time Collegiate had lost many of the senior players that had made them a force in the Yorkshire League, and were looking for an experienced head to captain a promising young team. Matt had performed consistently well as second team skipper for a number of year, and was the man they turned to.\n\nThe early seasons as captain were difficult ones with only Nick Gaywood, Nadeem Kahn and himself providing experience, but Matt held things together with his quiet but committed style of leadership. Slowly, the team improved as the young players, notably the Root brothers, came through. Then, when Sheffield Collegiate became founder members of the YSPL, Matt led the club to the runners-up spot in the YSPL in both 2017 and 2018, winning the League's t20 title in 2016 and 2017.\n\nA popular and respected figure throughout the Yorkshire League over its latter seasons, Matt was elected to the League Committee and, having represented the club and the league in the discussions that led to the formation of the Yorkshire South Premier League, Matt became vice-chairman of that league, and represented it on the newly-formed Yorkshire Premier Leagues Management Board. Matt is also a playing member of the MCC and has been chairman of its Fixtures and Touring sub-committee since October 2015.\n\nA private and undemonstrative man, Matt is married with a young son, Albert. He plays golf as a member of Lindrick Golf Club and is a season ticket holder at Sheffield United. Having qualified as a solicitor in 1998 and specialising in company law, Matt set up his own practice, MD Law, in Sheffield in 2015.\n\nDue to the demands of his family and business, Matt stepped down from the captaincy of SCCC, and his roles on the YSPL committee and the YPLMB at the end of the 2017 season.\n\nMatt Dixon was inducted into the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 9th November 2019.\n\nKevin started his scoring career at Harrogate CC in the Yorkshire County Premier League, and his skills were soon recognised by BBC and ITV. His CV includes work for Test Match Special, Radio 2 and Yorkshire TV, when the latter used to broadcast the Roses games. He has also scored at various International matches and his scorebooks demonstrate his meticulous records and knowledge of the game. His colleagues from those days, including Jonathan Agnew, Henry Blofeld and John Helm, amongst others, all hold him in high regard.\n\nAfter a while away from the game, he answered an advertisement in the Cricketer magazine from Barnsley CC, who were looking for a first team scorer. Many people at the club say that Kevin was their best ever signing. Steve Ward remembers sitting with him at Shaw Lane when he scored the game both on a laptop and a linear sheet, and also commentated on the game for BBC Radio Leeds!\n\nKevin was one of the first scorers to have earned the Level 3 award, and scored for Yorkshire Diamonds until his health prevented him from doing so. His record keeping is top class, and his knowledge of the Play Cricket system has smoothed the way for clubs to us it to their advantage. Kevin was instrumental in introducing computerised scoring to the former Yorkshire League, and this ground-breaking work was the forefront of this development that we now take for granted.\n\nAs well as his work in the scoring world, Kevin played an important part in the successful launch of Yorkshire South Premier League, and introduced the annual digest of league records, named after him as the Motley Almanac, which has become the League's statistical bible.\n\nKevin Motley, who was inducted into the Yorkshire South Premier League Hall of Fame on 8th November 2019, suddenly passed away in August 2023.\n\nSteve played through Whitley Hall junior and senior sides as a capable all-rounder, developing also into a very strong captain. Under his leadership, Whitley Hall were a very good Sheffield League side throughout the 1980s. He was then a pivotal force in the club’s transfer from Sheffield League to the old South Riding League, where the club continued to grow and develop both on and off the field.\n\nFrom an early age, he realised the importance of juniors to the club and ran many, if not all, of the age group sides at the club. His commitment to junior development at Baxter Field continued for 50 years, helping a host of juniors move through the ranks to represent the club in senior cricket. Thanks in a large part to Steve’s inspiration and guidance, Whitley have also been blessed with a large number of juniors who have gone on to represent their county and country at all junior levels. Probably the best-known of these is Yorkshire, Northamptonshire and England U/19s bowling star Ben Sanderson, who has now taken almost 400 wickets at county level.\n\nSteve also had a spell of about ten years on the league’s junior committee, running a number of Sheffield representative sides – one of which included current England captain Joe Root, who paid tribute to his old coach recently; “For as long as I can remember, you’ve been the heartbeat of South Yorkshire cricket … I’m extremely grateful for all that you do for cricket in our region. I know how much the guys appreciate you,” he said in congratulating him on his inaugural LV=Insurance Pride of Cricket award.\n\nBut Steve’s main focus has always been Whitley Hall. He has held every single position at the club – club captain, committee member, junior co-ordinator, director of cricket, secretary, barman, president, fundraiser and ladies’ manager. Pretty much that anything that needed doing around the club, Steve would do it – willingly, reliably, and to the best of his ability.\n\nSteve is at the Whitley Hall clubhouse almost every day of the week during the summer, opening the doors before training, junior practice and matches, running the bar and locking up when everyone else has left. For visitors to Baxter Field on match days, Steve’s is always a familiar, cheerful and welcoming face, whether making a cup of tea for visitors or serving behind the bar, always down-to-earth and with a friendly word for everyone, and a pride in his club that is obvious to all.\n\nAlways a family man, his wife Denise and son Alex, who followed in his footsteps as first team captain, have also both played big roles at the club. Now a devoted grand-dad, he has another, extended, family at Baxter Field - all the Whitley Hall people are family to him too, and his infectious passion for the club has rubbed off on many of them too.\n\nIt was club secretary Joe Webster who successfully nominated Steve for the Pride of Cricket award, and he summed him up simply by saying ‘Steve is Whitley Hall Cricket Club.’\n\nSteve Fletcher, sadly, passed away in October 2022.\n\nAs a dedicated member of Penistone CC for 47 years, and its chairman for over 20 years, Steve was the driving force behind a huge number of achievements at the club, including Clubmark accreditation; obtaining funding for a new outfield drainage system; refurbishing the clubhouse, including building a new kitchen; installing a new car park; and renewing most of its ground machinery; but, most importantly, inspiring generations into his beloved cricket.\n\nCricket was in Steve’s DNA from his early years at Hartshead Moor CC, where his older brother also played and his sister was scorer, and his dad would not be too far away as the head groundsman. Steve followed in his father’s footsteps, and later, as club groundsman at Penistone for over 30 years, he worked unflaggingly on the thankless task of getting the ground ready for the season and preparing pitches throughout the season.\n\nAs head coach at the club, qualified to ECB level 2, for many years he played a massive role in helping young cricketers at the club on their journeys from All Stars through to senior cricket; providing advice, encouragement and support that will never be forgotten by those fortunate to come under his tutelage. In his professional life as a PE teacher at Penistone Grammar School, where he served for 37 years, he also helped shape and support many young people into the world sport especially for his passion cricket.\n\nSteve was also well-known to many cricketers across South Yorkshire as a popular and respected member of the SYSCL umpires panel since 2012.\n\nSteve Reid passed away in April 2021 after a short illness. He is sorely missed by all at Penistone CC, where he was an inspiration to all those in the Penistone and neighbouring communities, but his legacy is a club that is growing in strength from the foundations he helped build, and that now faces a bright future.\n\nBorn in Nottingham on 9 May 1948, Richard completed his education at Brasenose College, Oxford, representing the university as a wicket-keeper in first class matches against four county sides. His profession as an English Teacher and later Deputy Head, took him, his wife Anne and four children to Tapton School in Sheffield, where, in 1984, he joined the local club, Hallam.\n\nHe put his heart and soul into the club from day one and, by 1987, he had become secretary, a position he still holds today. Under his guidance the club has expanded from two senior sides and three junior teams to six senior sides, two Sunday sides, a midweek and indoor team, and fourteen junior teams.\n\nThe successful provision of such opportunities for local cricketers has led to the club operating across three grounds and Richard’s determination and willingness to enforce change for the better has been key to this. He was influential in Hallam becoming the first club to gain the Clubmark accreditation in Yorkshire and also the redevelopment of derelict land at Crimicar Lane, which now is home to the club’s 1st and 2nd XI teams.\n\nWhilst influential in the club’s expansion, Richard’s passion lies in the enjoyment of cricket by juniors of all ages. Through his commitment to grass-roots cricket, not only as a coach, but also through involvement in junior representative sides and as the current chairman of the Ben Jessop Cricket League, Richard can be credited with playing a role in the development of a vast number of current players across South Yorkshire. Within his club, he made it his early mission to provide opportunities for under-nine and under-11 cricketers, and in recent years has been a huge driving force in establishing a successful and award-winning All Star & Dynamos program. To this day, his passion and enthusiasm for learning cricket is as infectious and inspiring as it was 30 years ago.\n\nHis service to Hallam CC and cricket in Sheffield cannot be understated. All his work is done with the absolute minimum of fuss or any personal desire to be credited. There is no role within the club he has not undertaken at some point, no job is too big or too small. Without his selfless dedication to Hallam, it could be argued that the club may not have survived the 1990’s, when only a Richard Storer-driven amalgamation with Waterworks CC laid the foundations for what Hallam CC has become today.\n\nWhilst, he would not wish for such a title, it could be argued that Richard Storer, bucket hat and all, is, Hallam Cricket Club.\n\nA one-club man, he has been a stalwart of Bradfield Village Fellowship CC for over 30 years. He is still playing, mainly in the second team, at ‘slightly’ slower pace, and is ever willing to pass on his knowledge and experience to the younger generations at Bradfield. On the field, he remains the competitor he always was, and will most likely carry on playing until medical advice stops him.\n\nIn addition to his long playing career, Mick has contributed greatly to the running of the Bradfield club, carrying out many committee roles, most notably in recent years, as secretary and groundsman. Club President Mark Wragg says, “Simply put, without Mick’s commitment to the club over the many years he has served it, I am doubtful that the club would have existed – it certainly would not be the thriving club it is today, with over 100 members, several junior teams and two womens’ teams.”\n\nA qualified umpire, Mick has also willingly given up much of his time to league administration, serving both the South Yorkshire Senior Cricket League and now the YCSPL in the thankless job of disciplinary officer, a role that he has unfailingly carried out with compassion, conscientiousness, and fairness.\n\nChris Street remains a close friend, and in congratulating his old pal, says that “Mick is thoroughly deserving of recognition. Wragg says, “We may have lost count of all the five-wicket hauls and fifties, the game-changing performances, that he has contributed to our cause – but most importantly, we have never lost sight of how important he is to our club and the league as a whole. Cricket has been his life, both on and off the pitch.”\n\nA right-arm off-spin bowler and a right-handed batsman, Ian had successful spells with both Barnsley and Sheffield United in the Yorkshire League in the late 1970s and early 80s, and attracted the interest of Yorkshire CCC. Having played in the county seconds, Ian made his first team debut for Yorkshire against Somerset in 10 August 1983 at Weston-Super-Mare. Also in the Yorkshire team that day were greats Geoffrey Boycott, Ray Illingworth, Martyn Moxon, and David Bairstow. Ian took 1-19 from 10.4 overs in the first innings and bowled against West Indian legend, Sir Vivian Richards.\n\nHis best bowling figures for Yorkshire were 7-95 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge and his best batting performance was 114 for a Yorkshire XI against the MCC at Scarborough – both of these being in 1987. After leaving Yorkshire, Ian joined Somerset CCC and spent two seasons with them. In all, he played in 88 first-class matches, in which he scored 1,550 runs with the one century, and he took 106 wickets.\n\nAfter leaving Somerset, Ian joined up with Yorkshire and Warwickshire player Paul Booth at Meltham CC in the Huddersfield League, where he was soon appointed captain. Over a 16-year period, he enjoyed several League championship, Sykes Cup and Champion of Champions successes with Meltham, earning in the process enormous respect as an astute and popular captain.\n\nAfter repeated attempts, Elsecar CC managed to bring Ian ‘home’ to captain their first XI in 2008. In the Whitworth Cup Final that year, Ian played arguably his best innings for the club, a man-of-the-match knock of 127 not out, including no fewer than 25 fours, in a nine-wicket victory over Treeton at Wickersley.\n\nThat was the start of several successful seasons at Armroyd Lane, culminating in Ian’s leading Elsecar to their finest-ever achievement – when they beat the all-conquering Yorkshire League champions York CC to become the Black Sheep Yorkshire Champions of 2014. His performances over the last fourteen years have resulted in him being regarded as one of the finest players ever to play for the Elsecar club.\n\nIan has also coached and managed many junior teams over the years, passing on his huge knowledge to endless youngsters, including most recently Elsecar and Yorkshire bowler Jack Shutt. He has also served the club in the thankless role of groundsman for many years – the splendid playing surface at the Armroyd Lane being a testimony to his skill and dedication.\n\nHe initially became involved with Whiston Parish CC on the administrative side in the late 1960s. this led to him being nominated as the club’s delegate to the South Riding Cricket League in 1971, and then to his becoming a member of the League’s Management Committee in 1984.\n\nBrian was then asked to chair the League’s newly-formed rules revision committee in 1995, continuing in this role until it was merged with the cricket committee in 2018. He was elected the South Yorkshire Senior Cricket League President in 2014, succeeding Alan Phelan, and held this post until its merger with the YSPL in 2021.\n\nHe also served as a League delegate to the Yorkshire Cricket Council from 2008 and served as its President for two years from 2017.\n\nAlthough Brian retired from his formal roles upon the amalgamation of the SYSCL with the YSPL in 2021, he has retained his active interest in South Yorkshire cricket and remains closely involved with the League. His knowledge of South Yorkshire cricket is unparalleled, and he remains a respected figure whose views are still sought.\n\nIn 2021, Brian was made a Life Member of the Yorkshire Cricket Southern Premier League in recognition of all his service to the League and its predecessors."
