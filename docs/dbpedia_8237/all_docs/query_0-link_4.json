        "text": "Sector organisations have responded to racist violence which unfolded across the UK over the weekend of 3-4 August.\n\nNational Museums Liverpool has issued a statement condemning the rioting in the Liverpool City Region and nationwide.\n\n“This isn’t protest or freedom of speech, it’s racism and it should have no place in our society,” said Laura Pye, the organisation's director, in a piece published on the museum's website. “The distressing scenes outside mosques and community buildings across the country is causing fear and anxiety among our Global Ethnic Majority communities, particularly our Muslim communities who have wrongly been targeted with violence following a campaign of misinformation.\n\n“We stand with these communities and we want to reassure them that the actions of a minority don’t represent the views of the majority. Despite the disgraceful scenes, our city region's true character shone through when local residents united to protect mosques from attack and came together in large numbers to clean up the damage.”\n\nFar-right rioting broke out in several UK towns and cities following the deaths of three children in a stabbing attack in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July.\n\nOn the museum's role in its community, Pye continued: “Across all of our museums and galleries that make up National Museums Liverpool, we work to understand and address the racism born out of the legacy of Transatlantic Slavery. There is no doubt that these are dark times, but as we struggle to come to terms with what has happened, it is vital that we stand together.\n\n“It is also important in the coming weeks and months that we can come together as a society to discuss our concerns and work together. Our museums are civic spaces where these discussions can take place, and we will play our part.\n\n“As a Museum of Sanctuary, National Museums Liverpool works with City of Sanctuary UK to foster supportive and welcoming spaces for people seeking sanctuary in our communities. We will continue to focus our efforts on ensuring our museums and galleries are a safe space and we will not tolerate hate of any kind.”\n\nSpellow Lane library hub, a community space in Liverpool which was targeted and set alight by rioters on Saturday evening, has already raised over £125,000 to support the cost of repairs via a GoFundMe campaign. More than 6,000 donors have contributed to the fund in two days.\n\nHull\n\nIn a post on X, Simon Green, managing director of Hull Culture & Leisure, thanked staff at Ferens Art Gallery and Hull City Hall for keeping buildings and visitors safe on 3 August.\n\nRotherham\n\nFollowing brutal attacks at a hotel providing accommodation for refugees in Manvers, Rotherham, leader of Rotherham Council Chris Read said in a statement: “The scenes in Manvers today confirmed our worst fears about the nature of protests across the country. There can be no excuse for the kind of violence and vandalism we have seen. As others have rightly said it must be met with the full force of the law.\n\n“Those who stood by and simply watched thugs tried to set fire to a building containing other human beings will reflect on what they have become and what they have associated themselves with. Rotherham is better than that. Everywhere is better than that.”\n\nThe council is responsible for museums and cultural venues including Clifton Park and Museum and Boston Castle and Park.\n\nUK-wide sector support\n\nThe Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents public sector workers, including some museum and heritage staff, said it condemns the “recent violence and hatred” in a joint statement from general secretary Fran Heathcote and national president Martin Cavanagh.\n\nThey said: “Over recent days we have witnessed the most atrociously violent attacks on communities by the far right. These attacks are not protests, they are racially targeted riots aimed at our Black and Muslim brothers and sisters, as well as vulnerable refugees seeking asylum in this country.”\n\nThe statement went on to reiterate its support for members: “PCS stands with our Black and Muslim members, their families and communities during these troubling and dangerous times. We are appalled that such horrific attacks are taking place in communities which promote unity, solidarity and hope. PCS is here to support any member affected by these incidents. We urge members to speak to their reps and regional officers who are on hand to offer support.”\n\nSharon Heal, director of the Museums Association, said: “As a sector we will all be appalled by the scenes we have witnessed in towns and cities throughout the UK over the past week.\n\n“Many colleagues will be personally impacted by the violence, racism and anti-Muslim bigotry and institutions should be doing all they can to support them. Our communities will also be impacted and we need to do all that we can to support them.\n\n“Museums have a convening and healing role to play in bringing people together to understand what has happened and to rebuild, but we should also be clear in calling out and rejecting racism in every form and ensuring it has no place in a civilised society.”"
