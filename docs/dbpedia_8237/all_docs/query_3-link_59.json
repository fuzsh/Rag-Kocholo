There are so many fun times and lots of precious moments. I always feel so blessed to work with the kids and their families. Being a children’s pastor is a blessing and it’s a role that I love doing. I love to see children learning all about how much they are loved and treasured by God. I also enjoy seeing kids becoming all God has created them to be with their gifting and personalities. My vision is to see children not only knowing Jesus through coming to church but actually getting to know him for themselves, just as I did when I was younger. I love to see kids worshiping and loving Jesus with all their heart. Children are such a blessing and being a part of what God has for them is an honour.”"
