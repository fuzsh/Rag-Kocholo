        "text": "Breastfeeding gives your child the best possible start in life.\n\nYour milk is unique and changes during each feed, with the time of day, your diet and the baby’s needs. Your breast milk is naturally full of nutrients, enzymes and antibodies. These antibodies reduce the risk of your baby suffering from many illnesses including ear, chest, gut and urine infections, as well as from diabetes, eczema, and asthma, which is why breast milk alone is enough to feed your child for the first six months of their life.\n\nWe will give you all the support you need from getting started with breastfeeding to weaning. This includes:\n\nduring pregnancy - we’ll talk about feeding and bonding with your baby\n\nholding and feeding your baby when they are born\n\nlearning how to respond to your baby’s needs\n\nrecognising feeding cues and knowing when your baby is getting enough milk\n\nlearning how to breastfeed and express milk\n\nbottle feeding, making formula feeds and sterilising\n\nweaning your baby on to solid foods\n\nInformation about feeding is also available in your Red Book.\n\nWe are also working with children’s centres in Rotherham to develop a team of peer supporters who can help you get to grips with breastfeeding, especially if it doesn’t seem to be as straightforward as you had hoped. Peer supporters are other Mums who have breastfed themselves so they know what it is like – but they have had training from our team and can offer lots of good advice and support.\n\nBeing a parent can be the best job in the world - but it can also bring challenges. There may be times when parents need some help over and above the five contracts offered in the Healthy Child Programme. This may include:\n\nweaning\n\npostnatal depression\n\nsleepless children\n\nmanaging challenging behaviour\n\nrelationship problems that affect the children\n\nchildren who have a long-term health condition\n\nchildren who don't seem to be making as much progress as expected\n\nWe can provide additional support such as extra visits so that you have more time to talk through your concerns and find the right way for you and your family to get on top of the issue.\n\nWe have a good knowledge of all the other services available in the community and can also refer you to other teams who may be able to help.\n\nIf there are a number of different services involved with your family, we will work in partnership with them to help achieve the best possible outcome for your child and the rest of the family.\n\nWe can provide advice on all of the following:\n\nstopping smoking and issues related to alcohol and drugs\n\nhealthy eating, healthy lifestyles and exercise\n\nrelationships\n\nsexual health and contraception\n\nbullying, abuse and exploitation\n\nworries about mental health\n\nIf you are a young person, or someone who is concerned about a young person, you can call our helpline number to speak to someone who can give you advice. If appropriate, we can arrange to see the young person – or put them in contact with a more specialist service that can address their needs.\n\nWe also hold drop-in sessions where young people can call in to ask for information or discuss any issue which is affecting their mental or physical health. For dates and times of these sessions, please ring the helpline number – or lookout for posters in schools and community venues.\n\nThe Healthy Child Programme is a national initiative which aims to ensure that children get off to a good start in life and stay healthy. We offer everyone five visits between the ages of 0-5 years to check on development and give parents the information and support they need as their child grows.\n\nThe five visits are as follows:\n\nAn antenatal contact (before your baby is born) - we talk about the weeks ahead and answer any of your questions\n\nNew birth visit (before your baby is fourteen days) - we check on how you and your baby are doing and make sure you get any extra support that you need\n\nSix to eight week visit - we check that your baby is making progress and help with any questions or concerns that you may have\n\nOne year development review (between nine to twelve months) - we check on your baby’s milestones and talk about what to expect in the year ahead\n\nTwo year development review (between two to two and a half years) - this is a chance to see how your child is getting on in all areas of their development\n\nWe are able to support parents by providing:\n\ndevelopment checks for their child\n\ninformation and advice on physical and emotional development\n\nadvice on establishing good sleep habits\n\ninformation on keeping your child safe, reducing the risk of accident and injury\n\nbreastfeeding advice and support\n\nhealthy eating and weaning advice\n\nimmunisations\n\nhelp and advice on minor illnesses\n\nWe can signpost you to local services and activities that you and your their child might enjoy or find useful. We are also there to give parents extra support when they need it.\n\nParenting during your teenage years can bring its own challenges, so we offer a programme of regular visits for young parents. This means young parents get the help they need to do the best for their baby at a time in their lives when they may also need support as young adults.\n\nThe programme is delivered by a Young Parents’ Nurse through visits to your home or they may invite you to a clinic. The Young Parent Nurse would visit at key milestones throughout your child’s development for example Antenatal Visit, New Birth Visit, 4 Week Visit, 6-8 Week visit and 3-4 month visit. If you are aged 19 or under and are pregnant with your first baby, you will be referred to this service by your midwife or health visitor who will discuss with you whether you would benefit from the programme.\n\nThe programme starts in pregnancy and lasts until your child is 2 years old. The programme covers topics such as health, child development, relationships, emotional wellbeing and everyday health support as a new parent. You will have the opportunity to get to know your Young Parents’ Nurse which means you will feel more able to ask questions and get the help you need which may involve seeking support and information from other specialised services.\n\nThe Weight, Health and Attitude Management (WHAM) service supports children and young people identified as being above a healthy weight through the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP).\n\nThe service is delivered in a friendly, safe and non-judgemental environment by experienced health professionals, who offer a tailored approach to weight management. They encourage families to work together to make lifestyle changes that will help children achieve and maintain a healthier weight.\n\nWHAM is embedded into the community with health improvement at the heart of what they do. We have strong links with other professionals such as school nurses, GPs, paediatricians, dietitians, early help and the CAMHS.\n\nFor more information about the service, please email us on rgh-tr.whamrotherham@nhs.net or call us on 01709 423214.\n\nYou can also find us on Facebook where we provide healthy lifestyle advice and support including signposting to physical activity opportunities across Rotherham."
