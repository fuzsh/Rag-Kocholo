        "text": "Martin LeRoy Foster started his life journey April 10, 1945. His early years in Marlton, NJ consisted of transforming a South Jersey swamp into Creek Run Recreational Lake and Swim Club. With help from his parents, LeRoy and Martha Foster, Martin spent countless hours turning a little patch of New Jersey into the historic lake it is known for today. As Martin grew into a teenager, he played football for Lenape High School. He was also a member of the Garrison Foster Hunting Club where he spent many years sitting in trees waiting for deer to cross his path. Many times, he was outsmarted by the deer. Martin was a respected volunteer fire fighter in Marlton. He married Gail Joyce Levy and they had a daughter. He was also an active member of Local 172 where he optimized the very roads you use every day. In the mid-1990’s, the swim club was turned into Camp Creek Run, a day camp for children ages 4-12. In the early 2000’s Martin and Gail retired to a horse farm in PA. Martin was excited to swap years of hard work for greener pastures – literally – as you could find him sitting on his favorite tractor listening to his favorite country music always during dinner time which wasn’t Gail’s favorite but, the lawn looked great! After the loss Gail, Martin moved to Felton, DE to live out the final years of his life. He enjoyed over-feeding the native bird population, floating down the Delaware river with fishing rod in hand spending quality time with his pride and joy, a fluffy little white dog named Mikey. Martin was loved by his community. He was a keen outdoorsman, animal whisperer and a better cook than Gail. He was also liked by everyone who ever met him. Martin is survived by his only daughter, Tara. There will be no service."
