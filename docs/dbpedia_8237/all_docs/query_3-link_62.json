        "text": "Police have pictured the 24 men they want to talk to following deplorable disorder outside a Holiday Inn Express, thought to house ayslum seekers.\n\nA mob of far-right thugs stormed the hotel in Manvers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on Sunday, and set objects on fire in shocking scenes. They forced entry by smashing a window and then marched into the hotel - to the horror of worried onlookers, including children.\n\nPolice called it \"mass disorder\" and, since then, more wanton violence has been repeated in towns and cities across the UK. Arrests - and convictions - have been made this week but South Yorkshire Police continue to investigate this particular incident.\n\nThe force said: \"Our investigation continues at pace and we are now looking to identify a number of people in connection with unrest that took place outside the Holiday Inn Express hotel at Manvers in Rotherham on Sunday (4 August). Do you recognise any of these people? Can you help identify them? If you know who these people are, please contact our investigating team.\"\n\nSouth Yorkshire Constabulary released pictures of 24 men they want to talk to regarding the anarchy outside the establishment, which is in a suburb to the north of Rotherham. The force stresses the numbers beside each image are important, and officers will ask for each number in any communication.\n\nFootage shared on social media captures the mob maraud into the building on Sunday. Further video shows items of furniture leaning against the exterior of the hotel on fire.\n\nDramatic photos taken inside the hotel show police officers tending to a wounded colleague while the mob smashes windows and hurls tables and chairs. Thugs also pelted police officers with bricks outside the building. Shocking videos show protesters, including some waving England flags and Union Jacks and others wearing balaclavas, shout slogans including \"get them out\" and rock a police van and its camera.\n\nOne man in camouflage khaki pants held a large placard which read: \"Enoch Powell 1968. Rivers of blood, social unrest, 3 kids murdered. Who's next?\" Another placard being waved outside the Holiday Inn read: \"Stopping the boats means stopping the stabbings.\" Another read: “Men don’t flee war and there is no war in France.”\n\nObjects, including pieces of wood and chairs, were thrown at the hotel and at police officers as they lined up in front of the building. At least one injured officer in riot gear was carried away by colleagues, it was understood.\n\nUnrest also unfolded outside the Potters International Hotel in Aldershot, Hampshire, on Sunday afternoon. One placard there said: “No more squatters staying at Potters” while another read: “House Brits on waiting lists.” A group of young men waved another banner that read: “We’re not far right we’re just right.\"\n\nMore disorder is feared in the next few days as authorites studied \"further intelligence of events\" - which may include football fixtures.\n\nAlthough last night saw counter-demonstrators outnumber the far-right thugs at most of the protests, Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson MP remains \"cautious\" today about future events.\n\nShe said \"further intelligence of events during the next few days\" has come to light so police forces remain braced for further unrest. Ms Johnson, 58, did not elaborate on the events in question, but this weekend marks a significant point in the football calendar - with games across the EFL Championship, League One and League Two as the English Football League season starts. Preston host Sheffield United in Lancashire on Friday night and Saturday's ties include games in Sheffield, Hull, London, and Birmingham.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, Ms Johnson said: \"I am cautious about what happened last night. It’s good that we didn’t see the level of disorder and criminality on our streets that we have in previous days, but obviously this is just the start. There is now further intelligence of events during the next few days and we need to see what happens there.”\n\nNearly 500 arrests have been made across the country in relation to the riots. Several people have already appeared in court - and been jailed - for crimes committed at the gatherings.\n\nTwo rioters who were “at the forefront” of violent far-right disorder on Merseyside have been jailed over their “disgraceful” actions. John O’Malley, 43, and William Morgan, 69, were both handed a sentence of two years and eight months at Liverpool Crown Court after admitting to violent disorder last Tuesday.\n\nA 48-year-old man, from Hunslet, Leeds, has admitted causing racially, religiously aggravated harassment, alarm, or distress through words in relation to a demonstration in the city. Philip Hoban pleaded guilty at Leeds Magistrates Court today and will be sentenced next week.\n\nHoban was a prominent figure in an anti-immigration demonstration in the centre of Leeds on Saturday, where he could be seen shouting at hundreds of anti-fascist protesters and leading the chanting. Scores of police were deployed outside Leeds's museum and art gallery, where the two rival demos were kept apart by lines of officers.\n\nAnd a 55-year-old woman has been arrested in relation to a social media post containing inaccurate information about the identity of the suspect in the Southport murders.\n\nThe woman, from near Chester, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of publishing written material to stir up racial hatred and false communications. She is being held in custody by Cheshire Police where she is assisting officers with their inquiries.\n\nAnd a couple who were both bitten by police dogs after becoming embroiled in riots in Hartlepool following an afternoon bingo session have each been jailed for two years and two months.\n\nSteven Mailen, 54, was described as “one of the main instigators” of a huge disturbance in the town. His partner Ryan Sheers, 29, also from Hartlepool, was bitten on the hip by the dog during the incident. They displayed \"disgraceful\" behaviour, which resulted in the animal attacking them both, a judge said.\n\nBrash and boozed-up Sheers was seen goading police and even claimed \"I pay your wages\". Performing a bizarre scene squatting and yelling in front of the line of shielded officers, the protestor was left feeling less sure of himself after the dog grabbed him by the shorts and pulled them down, leaving others in hysterics. He wept during the hearing last week before being sentenced today.\n\nThe pair, neither of whom has any previous convictions, pleaded guilty to violent disorder after about 200 people gathered in the town on July 31. Teesside Crown Court heard Mailen and Sheers had been at bingo together in the afternoon and continued drinking at home.\n\nKieron Gatenby, 19, and Bobby Shirbon, who was celebrating his 18th on the day of the protests, were also part of a group \"shouting racial slurs\" and throwing missiles. There will both be detained at a Young Offenders institute, Gatenby for 16 months and Shirbon, who threw a beer bottle at a police vehicle, was handed 20 months.\n\nA fifth defendant, Carl Holliday, 30, hurled several large metal sheets at police while aggressively shouting and swearing at officers over a 30-minute period, it was claimed in court. In mitigation, Duncan McReddie he was a \"chronic alcoholic\" but held no \"racist\" or \"extreme political views\". He was jailed for two years and eight months.\n\nMailen and Sheers told police they came upon the disturbance on the way to the shop to buy more alcohol and ended up being “at the very forefront of the mob”. Rachel Masters, prosecuting, said officers at the scene described Mailen as “one of the main instigators of a large-scale disturbance”.\n\nThe court heard that over 10 minutes he “taunted” police and appeared to be “inciting the gathered crowd to use violence towards them”. Both Mailen and Sheers attempted to push through a police cordon, it was said. At one point Mailen approached an officer and “gesticulated towards him, shouting abuse at him” until he was struck on the leg by an officer’s extendable baton.\n\nSheers, who one officer described as “particularly violent” was bitten by a police dog “in the right hip/buttock area”. Ms Masters said Mailen made an attempt to grab the dog or dog handler and when an officer tried to detain him, grabbed his radio and tucked it under his arm.\n\nHe was struck again with a baton and kicked the officer in the shins numerous times. The court heard he continued to lash out as he was being arrested and it took three officers to get his arms behind his back and get the handcuffs on. Nigel Soppitt, defending both men, said the behaviour was an “isolated activity” for them and they had expressed remorse.\n\nThe court heard Mailen is a former postmaster and school governor who, in the past, has “called out prejudice of all kinds”. After watching bodyworn camera footage of the incident, Judge Francis Laird KC told them: “Your behaviour and the behaviour of others around you was truly disgraceful.”\n\nHe said: “There was large-scale damage to property and members of the public have been forced to endure the devastation and chaos caused to their community. The public are rightly outraged by this behaviour on the streets of this country.” Three more people are due to be sentenced over the Hartlepool disorder at Teesside Crown Court on Thursday.\n\nA woman accused of being the first to spread false rumours that the Southport stabbing suspect was an asylum seeker says she's “mortified” and \"literally destroyed\".\n\nThe stabbing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in the Merseyside town last week led to widespread misinformation that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived by boat. It fuelled race-fuelled violence and unrest, with major rioting in Southport spreading to towns and cities across the country.\n\nBebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Dasilva Aguiar all died in the stabbing frenzy on July 29 with Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, 17, from Banks, Lancashire, arrested and accused of the three murders.\n\nRudakubana, who was born in Cardiff, is also charged with the attempted murders of yoga class instructor Leanne Lucas, businessman John Hayes and eight children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and with possession of a kitchen knife with a curved blade. He was remanded to youth detention accommodation and will next appear in court in October."
