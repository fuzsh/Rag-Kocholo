        "text": "With Leeds-based midfielder Stoker now agreeing terms with Leigh RMI, Foster would have been a lone traveller from his Rotherham home, having previously shared driving duties with his midfield companion.\n\nFans' favourite Foster joined Rovers in January 2001 from Doncaster Rovers. His all-action midfield performances quickly made the 26-year-old a firm Lawn legend.\n\nCaptaining Rovers on a number of occasions Foster's future was shrouded in doubt throughout last season after an on pitch bust-up with fellow star Scott Morgan, an incident which resulted in Morgan having his contract terminated by mutual consent.\n\nHowever, with Rovers boss Tim Harris implementing a policy of recruiting players closer to the Gloucestershire locality, Foster's future at The Lawn remained an issue and his tenure with the club has now ended.\n\nMeanwhile, Langan has been offered the chance to study for a masters degree in Texas, though his loss has been negated by the capture of defender Gould from Chippenham Town for a nominal fee.\n\nGould arrives at the club along with former Bristol Rovers striker Rammell and Cheltenham Town midfielder Cleverley.\n\nThe trio will join recent fresh faces Mark Beesley, Charlie Griffin, Danny Greaves and Matt Aubrey.\n\nStroud-based Luke Kitchen is currently training with Rovers having returned from a spell playing football in America. Kitchen, a former England schoolboy captain, had previous spells at both Swindon Town and Shortwood United.\n\nUp to ten new faces will be on show for a new-look Rovers as they begin their pre-season warm-up campaign at Chalford tonight (6.45pm) before playing at home to Reading on Tuesday, July 13 (7.45pm)."
