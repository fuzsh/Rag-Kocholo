        "text": "League Two outfit Rotherham have been rocked by news that Luke Foster has been ruled out for the season with an injury.\n\nThe utility man, capable of playing in defence or midfield, sustained a knee problem in the 3-2 win at Hereford last week and a scan has since shown him to suffer cruciate ligament damage. \"It's a blow for him and for us because he's an important part of our squad,\" boss Andy Scott said. \"When he's played he's done a good job for us so it's his season over I'm afraid. \"The good news that we're getting people back is tainted by that news really.\" Foster, who joined in the summer from Stevenage, has played five times this season."
