I'm so excited.\n\n\"I said she was my best friend in the world, and everybody thought I was a bit mad, but now it's official. BFFs. It's amazing.\"\n\nShe added: \"My boyfriend probably won't care though - he's had enough of me talking about Kim.\"\n\nSince downloading the game last June, Emma has been hooked and regularly shuns going out for dinner with her boyfriend of four years to spend the night at home glued to her tablet.\n\nShe said: \"Last summer, it was getting to me how few English-speaking friends I have here. I used to get bored all the time.\n\n\"Now I'm never bored, and it's fantastic that the real Kim is officially my best friend.\"\n\nEmma's long-suffering boyfriend will continue to put up with the game, because he says it's an \"addiction\".\n\nKim's tweet was favourited a whopping 2,700 times in the first 12 hours it was online."
