        "text": "Get in touch with us fosteringfriendly@fostering.net and we can send you our draft policy.\n\nAdapt the policy for your needs. Send us back your policy.\n\nWe can arrange a call with you or answer any questions you have.\n\nWe can then approve you (or provide comments to help you get approved) add you to our list of Fostering Friendly Employers and celebrate your new status on our social media channels.\n\nIs there a cost?\n\nNo the scheme is free to join.\n\nHow long does it take to become Fostering Friendly?\n\nGetting internal agreement and sign off for a new HR policy can take time. Depending on the size of your organisation, it could be a few months, but remember we are here to assist at any stage and are happy to talk to any stakeholders in your organisation.\n\nOnce you have a draft policy document, you can send it to us and we should be able to approve it within a week.\n\nCan we write our own policy?\n\nYes you can. We have a draft policy, which we can send you – to save you time. Some organisations incorporate this into existing policy documents.\n\nWill this impact our business?\n\nMany businesses have adapted and become more flexible in recent years.\n\nAround 1 in 890 employees in the UK is also a foster carer. This may help you to estimate what the take up may be.\n\nSupporting staff helps to build morale.\n\nThis could help with staff retention and with the cost of living.\n\nYou can use our Fostering Friendly logo on your website and on social media.\n\nJoining the scheme shows strong corporate social responsibility - a responsible company with a long term commitment in the area.\n\nHow do we support Foster Care Fortnight?\n\nWe will send you materials that you can share on social media. This helps to recognise the important role of foster carers in our society and to encourage others to consider fostering.\n\nYou could consider holding an event to raise awareness about fostering.\n\nFrom some of our existing Fostering Friendly Employers:\n\n\"We recognised that the impact for us as a company is relatively small, but the impact for any potential child being fostered could be significant.\"\n\nKarin O'Connell, Deputy Head of People Success, Synetics and Port Vale.\n\n“We recognise and value the enormous contribution that foster carers make to the lives of children in care. We also understand the need for flexibility at work to meet the needs of foster children, which is why we are committed to supporting colleagues who are foster carers.”\n\nProfessor Martin Jones, Vice Chancellor and Chief Executive, Staffordshire University.\n\n“We became a Fostering Friendly employer because we wanted to strengthen our family-friendly policies to include foster carers who provide a really important service to their communities.\n\nIan Gleave, Executive Director of Organisational Development, Aspire Housing."
