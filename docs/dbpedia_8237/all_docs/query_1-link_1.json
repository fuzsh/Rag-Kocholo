Then went in the Metropolitan police cadets for a couple of years but resigned. A short period of confusion followed before he went back to college to study computers. Went to Dinnington Tech, Sheffield and got an ONC in Computer Studies. Decided to continue studying and got into Manchester Poly's HND Computer Studies program.\n\nImmediately after, Martin got a job cooking on a summer camp in New Hampshire, USA. He then headed to California where he got a top job as a burger cook in a bar in Malibu. After that he became a bouncer\n\nFinally, after 2 years of dead-end jobs, he married his girlfriend and got a job as a consultant programmer/analyst.\n\nDid a few years of programming and then got bored. Started to see that 3d computer animation was becoming a viable field of employment and launched himself into it as a consultant/freelancer.\n\nOver the years, Martin worked on all kinds of animation projects for many industries, architecture, engineering, video games, and 3d /effects for feature films. The most recently released was \"Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone\" and \"Stuart Little 2\"\n\nMartin lives in Laguna Beach which is 65 miles down the coast from Los Angeles, but during a film project Martin, his wife and son, stay in a small apartment in West LA within bicycle commuting distance."
