        "text": "Did you know that one of this year's grant recipient's was the Apex Police Youth Enrichment Camp. In a world where community engagement and positive law enforcement interactions are vital, police youth summer camps have emerged as a beacon of hope and an opportunity for building strong relationships between law enforcement agencies and the younger generation. These camps provide a unique and enriching experience that goes beyond the conventional summer activities, fostering trust, understanding, and leadership skills among the youth. 2023 marked the 14th anniversary of the Apex Police Departmentâ€™s Youth Enrichment Camp. The positive effects of YEC ripple beyond the participants themselves. As these young individuals return to their communities, they become ambassadors of understanding, sharing their experiences and insights with peers, family members, and neighbors. This leads to improved relationships between the police and the community at large, fostering a culture of trust and collaboration. In an era where building bridges between law enforcement agencies and the youth they serve is paramount, police youth summer camps emerge as a transformative force. Through fostering understanding, nurturing leadership skills, and creating lasting relationships, these camps lay the foundation for a brighter and more cohesive future.\n\nCheck out this organization my friend/colleague is supporting-- they are looking to create different outcomes for court-involved youth and formerly incarcerated adults by providing safe, accessible \"climbing adventures\" in nature. ðŸ’¯ This is, no doubt, amazing and transformative work. We need more resources (money, minds, and time) invested in these kinds of creative, human-centric solutions. Part of our problem is that we have all been taught that solving social problems is supposed to look a certain way and that the power to create change belongs to certain people. When I was at HLS, we were taught that learning how to use the law was the best way to solve law-related problems (i.e.Mass Incarceration). In the world of \"professional social justice\" (i.e. nonprofit work), there tends to be a high value given to \"proper\" problem-solving strategies (i.e. things that require J.D.s, PhD's, and MBAs), and the people who are \"qualified\" to lead those strategies... As someone with a \"fancy\" degree, believe me, formal education can be helpful... However, I see many of us over-indexing and over-valuing the things that make us feel smart (ego) while greatly under-valuing and under-utilizing strategies informed by what we experience, observe, and witness in life and the world around us. Things we know in our spirit and body because of what we lived through. To be completely real, my life experiences have contributed far more to my ability to advocate, organize, and problem-solve (for justice and equity) than my formal education has (though the HLS degree is usually the \"hook\"). What's funny is that my most valuable insights from formal education came from interrogating and resisting what I was being taught... dominant narratives, without historical context, fed to me as divine truth (\"Rule of Law\"). I learned to pay attention to what questions Professors consistently dismissed/ignored, and I learned to understand what language and ideas were rewarded. It's not what I was taught that benefitted me. It was the process of interrogating what I was being taught and trying to understand WHY. One of the WHYs I arrived at: If we all believe that we need to be a formal power holder (lawyer, judge, doctor, CEO) to create radical change, most of us will also believe that we cannot create radical change in the world. However, the truth is-- each of us is a missing piece of the puzzle. Everyone has the power to contribute to a more just and equitable world... you just gotta find your way, your unique superpower. The Flash doesn't try to be Superman, and Charles Xavier doesn't try to be Wolverine... superheroes move from within. \"This is who I am, and so this is how I will help save the world.\" You have permission. <3 #transformativejustice #communityfirst #sharedhumanity\n\nChicago Commons' development team is doing a thing- a BIG thing! It's time to celebrate 130 years of transformative change in and around the city of Chicago. Join us on May 10th for our anniversary gala at Morgan Manufacturing as we honor those who support our mission as well as participants of Chicago Commons' programs who are doing the hard work of providing for the children, families, and seniors in their lives and building strong communities. We are \"Honoring the Past and Building the Future.\" For tickets: https://lnkd.in/gEaj8hiF For fun, what else happened 130 years ago in 1894? 1. The Pullman Strike began. If you don't know the history of this one, please look it up. It's fascinating and very important to labor history. 2. The Tower Bridge in London opened to traffic. 3. Norman Rockwell and Jack Benny are born. 4. William Kennedy Dickson receives a patent for motion picture film in the United States. 5. An extreme national economic depression hit the US in 1894 leading to factories closing and mass unemployment and poverty. 6. Chicago Commons was founded on May 1 by Graham Taylor...but this isn't in Wikipedia's \"1894\" entry - although I can change that, I suppose."
