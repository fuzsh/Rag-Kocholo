        "text": "The former treasurer of a naval veterans' organisation has been jailed for 18 months after nearly Â£80,000 was withdrawn from its accounts.\n\nThe money belonged to the HMS Ganges Association for people who served at the former naval training base at Shotley Gate near Ipswich, Suffolk.\n\nMartin Foster, 54, of Haig Road, Uxbridge, had already admitted two charges of fraud by abuse of position.\n\nHe was sentenced at Portsmouth Crown Court.\n\nThe inquiry was carried out by Hampshire Police after debit card transactions of Â£4,200 and cash machine withdrawals totalling Â£74,000 were made from the association's bank accounts between August 2010 and June 2012.\n\nThe association said it had about 3,000 members and at the time of the offences its income from membership fees was about Â£30,000 a year.\n\nJim Gitsham, chairman of the Shotley branch of the HMS Ganges Association, said: \"Members will be delighted that he's going down.\n\n\"We're hoping that we can get some of the money back from him, but we don't know if that's going to be possible.\"\n\nThe HMS Ganges training base, which opened in 1905, closed in 1976 and has remained derelict.\n\nA Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is due to take place at Portsmouth Crown Court on 23 January."
