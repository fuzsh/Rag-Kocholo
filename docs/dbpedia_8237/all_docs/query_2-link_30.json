Jenkins, Bryan Eubanks, Bonnie Jones, Hong Chulki, Choi Joonyong, Ryu Hankil, Jin Sangtae, and Kevin Parks.\n\nHe’s been in the groups Super Unity, Peevish, Don Brown and Dan Reynolds, and English, and has releases on Rasbliutto, Balloon&Needle, Manual, Homophoni, Doubtmusic, and Erstwhile. He plans to continue playing until death.\n\nhttps:// joefoster.blogspot.com/\n\nJean-Paul Jenkins has been making sounds in front of people since 1991. Inspired by the sound of one hand clapping, he integrates multiple forms of attention and performance to create sonic spaces for healing and relaxation. Accompanying physical movement and meditation has been his primary focus for the last decade.\n\nhttps:// jean-pauljenkins.bandcamp.c om/\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/ Joe-Foster-3-JP-Jenkins-Mon ey-Desert/release/9759380\n\nErika Bell is a Los Angeles composer and instrumentalist whose work is lightly focused on textural construction, irregular ensemble groupings, and a structure-based approach. Her recent recital piece ‘Sucking Stones’ was an exploration built upon a passage by Samuel Beckett and performed by a twelve-piece ensemble. She has performed with the Dogstar Orchestra and is a frequent composer for the koto-centered trio Pashan."
