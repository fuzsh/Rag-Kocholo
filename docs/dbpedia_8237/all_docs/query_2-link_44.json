Best season to date came in his rookie year of 2002 which, ironically, ended early when he was admitted to hospital to have a tumour removed from his neck. By his own admission, the amiable Yorkshireman took most of 2003 to recover before travelling to the Qualifying School in Portugal, where he earned a conditional card entitling him to limited starts in 2004. Returned to the School in November 2004 and secured the sixth card making him fully exempt for 2005. Represented England at amateur level before turning professional and qualifying for The European Tour, where he finished second on five occasions. Best season on the Tour came in 1976 when he finished seventh on the Order of Merit. A golf historian and a keen collector of golf books, he also started a magazine called Yorkshire Golf but sold it as a going concern prior to turning 50.",
