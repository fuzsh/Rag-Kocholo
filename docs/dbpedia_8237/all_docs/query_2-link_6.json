        "text": "Article by Chris Pitt\n\nMartin Foster was leading conditional jockey for the 1990/91 season when riding for champion trainer Martin Pipe.\n\nMartin Robert Foster was born in Cullompton, Devon, on September 8, 1970, the son of former National Hunt jockey John Foster, and nephew of fellow jump jockeys David, Gerry and Eric Foster. It was in thus his genes that Martin would become a jump jockey.\n\nHe began his career with Martin Pipe and rode his first winner on Dan Marino at Towcester on Easter Monday, March 27, 1989. He went on to be crowned champion conditional jockey for the 1990/91 season with 35 winners.\n\nMartin gained his biggest successes in 1992 on Martin Pipe’s Vagog, on whom he won the Murphy’s Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham on Mackeson Gold Cup day in November and Ascot’s Long Walk Hurdle in December.\n\nHowever, he rated Riverside Boy as the best he rode. Martin rode him to finish second in the 1992 Welsh Grand National, that being the famous occasion when Martin Pipe saddled the first four home: Run For Free, Riverside Boy, Miinnehoma and Bonanza Boy. Martin rode 21 winners in that 1992/93 campaign.\n\nHe rode in three Grand Nationals, completing the course in 14th place on Lucinda Russell’s 100/1 outsider Greenhill Raffles in 1996.\n\nHaving struggled to ride winners for a couple of seasons, he enjoyed a resurgence in 1996/97, notching 27 wins, thanks inpart to a link-up with trainer Chris Thornton, who supplied eight of them.\n\nMartin went on to ride a total of 148 winners. The last was on Heidi III in the J. Noble’s Promotions Car Boot Fair Novices’ Hurdle at Carlisle on Saturday, April 22, 2000. It was a successful conclusion to a carefully-hatched plan by the horse’s trainer Micky Hammond. As Martin, 29, passed to post clear of Global Search, he punched the air in delight and promptly announced his retirement from the\n\nHe explained afterwards: “I ride out for Micky every morning and I have done a lot of work on this horse – and we had decided a while ago that I would ride him when he had a chance. I have to thank Micky for putting me up and it is great that it has all worked out, though I must admit I am sorry to have to be packing in.\n\n“But it is not the time to carry on, if you are not riding winners you don’t get on other winners and it is just not practicable to carry on. It’s difficult to keep the weight down if you are not riding regularly.”"
