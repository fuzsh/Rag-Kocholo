        "text": "Last week, hundreds of far-right protesters in Rotherham, England stormed a hotel hosting migrants seeking asylum. According to the BBC, the protests were part of a broader reaction to a July 29 knife attack, which resulted in the deaths of three children. The attack was initially blamed on a Syrian Muslim asylum seeker who had arrived in the United Kingdom by boat in 2023 — a claim later proven false, the BBC reported.\n\nMisinformation quickly spread online and fueled the anger of many Brits, who took to the streets chanting “get them out” and clashing with police. The day after the knife attack in Southport, hundreds of protesters, believed to be supporters of the far-right and anti-Muslim English Defence League, attacked a local mosque with bricks, bottles and rocks.\n\nHowever, upon further investigation, it was revealed that the suspect was actually born in Wales to Rwandan parents. Although the initial suspect behind the stabbing has since been disproven, the events in the United Kingdom highlight a broader issue of xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment that is circulating throughout Europe.\n\nThe U.K. is not the only country experiencing a rise in anti-immigration sentiment. In France, 45% of the population believes there are “too many immigrants,” according to a December 2022 Kantar survey. The rise of Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party reflects how mainstream these ideas have become. Le Pen’s platform, built on a strong anti-immigration stance, has resonated with a significant portion of the French electorate, particularly in economically depressed regions where job scarcity and social services are strained.\n\nSimilarly, far-right, anti-immigrant political figures have gained mainstream traction in countries like Italy. The ascent of Giorgia Meloni and her Brothers of Italy party illustrates how anti-immigrant rhetoric is no longer confined to the fringes but is shaping national policies.\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine this xenophobia being quelled anytime soon. As economic inequality between countries grows, immigration to Western Europe will likely continue to rise. Since the pandemic, immigration has been high in several countries, including France, Germany and the U.K.\n\nAs immigration increases, so too does xenophobia. In Germany, for instance, attitudes toward immigration have become more negative, particularly among younger populations. The Guardian reported that among those aged 15 to 24, negative attitudes toward immigration from outside the European Union rose from 32% in 2019 to 35% in 2023, while negative attitudes among those aged 25 to 34 increased from 38% to 42%.\n\nMoreover, economic struggles have exacerbated the situation, with socially and economically vulnerable individuals feeling more threatened by minorities. According to comparative migration studies, these individuals are more likely to express discriminatory and exclusionary attitudes. This toxic combination of rising immigration and economic hardship could further entrench xenophobic and nationalist sentiments across Europe, which will undoubtedly lead to more anti-immigration violence in the future.\n\nThese developments are not occurring in a vacuum. They are part of a larger backlash against globalization and the perceived loss of national identity. In many European countries, there is a growing sense of alienation among citizens who feel they are being stripped of national identities. This sense of alienation is often channeled into resentment toward immigrants, who are seen as both a cultural threat and a strain on already overburdened social systems.\n\nAs Europe continues to grapple with these challenges, the potential for further violence cannot be ignored. History has shown that economic downturns and social fragmentation can create fertile ground for extremism. If current trends continue, the continent could see an increase in not only isolated incidents of violence but also in organized efforts to push anti-immigrant agendas through political and social channels. The recent riots in the U.K. might just be the beginning of a more widespread and dangerous shift across Europe.\n\nThis dangerous rhetoric toward immigration will certainly be important in shaping the scope of European governments in the coming years. As anti-immigration movements gain traction, we are certain to see more divisive and reactionary policies that will not only target immigrants but also undermine democratic values and social cohesion. As we have seen in the U.K., if left unchecked, this shift could erode stability and social cohesion within European countries, leading to a volatile path for the continent.\n\nOpinion articles represent the views of their author(s), which are not necessarily those of The Dartmouth."
