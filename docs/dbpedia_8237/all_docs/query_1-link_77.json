Lots of people have called her a legend but she was more then that to me. Sue was my wife of 48 years with no breaks & I enjoyed every second of it, but now she as been taken from me my heart is hurting so much & now my life seems so empty without her I have no idea how we are going to cope without Sues strength. If I could have changed places with Sue I definitely would have she was a much better person than me. Sue was also very straight forward she did not mix her words that were one thing that I loved about her. Rest in peace sweetheart I loved you more than words can tell.

I didn't want to live without you, But you would have wanted me to, And if there is anyone I want to make happy, That anyone is you. I would have given anything to have you back, But I know it was meant to be, For you are still watching from up there, And I know you are watching me. I will make you proud Mum, I'm going to fulfil your wish, You are going to see me and smile, That's a daughters promise. Love you always, Marie xxx\n\nMarie Buxton\n\n29th July 2016\n\nA life well lived is a precious gift of hope and strength and grace, from someone who has made our world a brighter, better place.

David underwent 3 major operations and had regular chemotherapy sessions. Throughout this time David always faced his challenges with courage and good spirits. He would use his sense of humour as a way of protecting those he loved from worrying about his future.\n\nDavid spent 2 weeks in the Rotherham Hospice and received wonderful care, before returning home and passed away with his loving family by his side.\n\nI met David (Dave to me) at the Tivoli night club in Rotherham in 1993 and we spent 27 happy years together. We had many wonderful holidays with family and friends during this time and it is these happy memories which I will now try to focus upon in the years to come.\n\nYour loving partner, Diane.\n\nShared memories of David Pearman\n\n\"I met Dave at a hotel in Spain some 38 years ago he was there with his friend Ross, it was such a chance meeting as he must have been at the bar and nipped to the toilet, then at that point me and my friend Tony entered the bar and took the seats they were sitting in Dave came back looked at us and said in typical Yorkshire accent your right from that moment we stayed in touch and holidayed together, more so my friend Tony as I shortly having returned from this holiday moved to Cornwall. Dave loved his holidays to Spain and Turkey and many other places, well me although I joined Dave several times on holiday my great love was cruising. I'm, sure he used to dread me trying to convince Dianne to take a cruise because as Dave said I can get four holidays for that we did have a laugh about it, and that was Dave great sense of humour, but he had a serious side to particularly if money was mentioned he would drag us from bar to bar always remember were the cheapest bar was and that's the Yorkshire spirit I loved about him. So sorry to hear of his passing, they say time is a great healer, but memories will last a lifetime R.I.P.\"\n\nKevin Fentham\n\n18th November 2020\n\n\"Dave was one of my best friends & we met 38 years ago along with my friend Kev, who has also left a message on the memory page. Dave has been a fantastic friend over all that time & we shared many a weekend together at his & Dianne's house in Swinton, at my house in Birmingham & away in Cornwall & many other destinations in the UK. We also had many years going abroad together to lots of destinations around Europe. His favourites were Turkey & Majorca. We always had a fun time & plenty of drink was involved. Dave was originally from Rotherham & in his early days used to stay at his mom & dad's house & go out with the lads for are weekend sessions. Other friends used to join me & Dave welcomed them all with open arms. He was always friendly with everyone. I got to know his family & Dianne's family & have become good friends with them all & they always made me feel welcome. Dave & i had the same sense of humour & always had a good laugh together. We both loved football, plus many other sports, including horse racing. Dave used come to mine & stop so he could go & watch his beloved Rotherham United, even sitting with myself & the Birmingham fans on one occasion. Dave was fantastic with finances & helped me understand my pension & got me into the position i am in today & will be forever grateful to him. He also help helped friends & family with theirs & i know they feel the same too. Dave will be greatly missed by me, as he was a dear friend, mate for life & a top bloke. I will always miss my buddy but will always be in my thoughts. God bless you m8! Forever brothers!\"\n\nAnthony Village\n\n23rd November 2020\n\n\"Dave was a special friend to me, ever since we met 38 years ago, on holiday in Majorca, with my friend Kev & the others we were away with. We have been the best of mates since, spending many weekends & holidays away together. For many of those years, he was with his partner Dianne, who he loved dearly& her kids, Robert & Catherine, who he treated like his own. He loved his sport & was an avid Rotherham United fan & season ticket holder. He also travelled to away matches & used to come to my team's Birmingham City's ground, also sitting with myself in the Birmingham stands. He loved my most sports & we used to go to horse race meetings with Dianne & the lads. We both had the same sense of humour & loved having a laugh at just about anything. He helped me with my finances along with others, he wanted the best for everybody. I became good friends with his family over the years & made many good friends, through him. I will miss Dave so much, has was a great friend & special person.\"\n\nAnthony Village\n\n23rd November 2020\n\n\"I first met Dave at the physique Gym in town, then started going out with other members on Friday nights them me and Dave had a ritual Friday night Prince of Wales then Tivoli night club. Saturday pub crawl round town few away days Benidorm, Blackpool Rotherham away games good times. Dave always made me laugh the more he drank the bigger the grin. then he met and fell for Diana the rest is history. We lost contact for many years then out of the blue he was sat in his car in Lidl car park windows down we started chatting away later that night Dave phone and we had a long conversation for 1 hour + just talking about old times. Dave never mentioned his illness during our conversation and I promised to keep in touch ( thinking about it now, so brave of him not to tell me of his problems so we could giggle and smile and not making it a sad phone conversation ) Then the phone call from Diana Sandra and I could not believe he had passed away. After all those years and then Meeting and talking and now he's gone again so sad. I would like to thank Diana who is one of the nicest people one could ever meet allowing a few but not enough words in this memory book RIP Dave who knows one day we might have that beer together.\"\n\nDave Roberts\n\n11th December 2020\n\n\"I got to know Dave from work, we use to car share from Chesterfield was always pointing birds out as we went back up the M1. We used to do a pub crawl from the gate Inn down into Swinton making sure we finished in the butcher's arms for the oap karaoke which he loved.Thanks for being a good mate, will always remember the laughs and good times we had.

A town centre manager turned urban academic, Victoria devoted her life to an aspect of cities that is entirely invisible, but which she was convinced had a huge influence over how we perceive places – namely, their smell. She achieved the successful publication of her book “Urban Smellscapes”, and had begun preparation of a second book which is now being completed by her colleagues.\n\nIn 2014, Victoria received the news that she had cancer. She was cared for by the Hospice at Home team, before being admitted to the Inpatient Unit on 19th September 2014. Victoria’s family visited daily and were impressed with the peacefulness of the Hospice surroundings, and the privacy and dignity shown to Victoria.\n\nWhilst being cared for in the Hospice, Victoria urged her sons Brodie, Alistair and Oliver to take part in the Colour Assault to give something back to the Hospice. The boys set up an online fundraising page, setting themselves a fundraising target of £300, and asked family and friends to sponsor them. Imagine their delight when their fundraising reached over £5,000!\n\nSadly, only a few weeks after the Colour Assault, Victoria passed away at home. We are extremely grateful to the family for their support of Rotherham Hospice and we wish them all the very best for the future.\n\nHow can you help?\n\nThere are many ways you can support us, whether it be through holding an event, playing in our lottery, volunteering, or donating!"
