On a small Mexican island dwells a group of Indians who live in the traditional manner and who disdain outsiders. The beautiful Maclovia and the poverty-stricken Jose Maria are in love, but her father refuses to allow their marriage, or even any communication between them, due to Jose Maria's lack of means. The young man strives to educate himself and earn enough to purchase his own fishing boat in order to win her father's favor. At the same time, a battalion of soldiers is posted there, and the brutal sergeant develops eyes for Maclovia. The conflicts come to a head on the Night of the Dead.
