        "text": "Hello!\n\nSorry, no reviews today … we’ve just gotten back from a quick trip East to hobnob with our fellow wizards attend to some forbidden personal family errands … We are a lot more refreshed than we would be if we tried to jam in a review laden with typos, awkward sentences and egregious mistakes for our esteemed correspondents to correct.\n\nMelville x 2 ! Kaufman x 2 ! Bert I. Gordon x 2 !\n\nBut we have some good disc announcements, none of them more than a week old! First up is KL Studio Classics’ announcement of their August lineup. It has a number of very welcome surprises, starting with a stack of worthy genre pictures in 4K Ultra HD: Jean-Pierre Melville’s Bob Le Flambeur and Le Doulos (with Jean-Paul Belmondo), Michael Ritchie’s PC outrage Prime Cut and Alain Resnais’ Last Year at Marienbad … plus …\n\n… plus … Jean-Luc Godard’s Alphaville in 4K, which I’m hoping will be a bit of an improvement over the previous Blu-ray.\n\nBlu-ray debuts or reissues include Phil Karlson’s 99 River Street with John Payne and Evelyn Keyes, Burt Reynolds in Navajo Joe, with its screaming soundtrack of Ennio Morricone; Bert I. Gordon’s Food of the Gods and Empire of the Ants (never seen ’em, I’m sure they’re ‘special’), Ray Milland in Frogs, Jeff Lieberman’s Squirm, Philip Kaufman’s The White Dawn and a Volume Twenty (XX) for the series Film Noir the Dark Side of Cinema.\n\nAlso to be very much welcomed by fans of Classic Eurohorror, from the always-reliable disc boutique Radiance, is the coming-soon announcement of the Riccardo Freda – Mario Bava horror opus I vampiri. The B&W CinemaScope thriller was the icebreaker for gothic horror in Italy. It preceded Hammer Film’s first all-out Technicolor horror release by one year.\n\nAfter Radiance’s stunning remasters of The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, Planet of the Vampires, etc., this is big news. We loved the old Image disc from 23 years ago, but wondered if its odd jumble of scenes fairly represented the movie; perhaps the experts can straighten it out for us. At any rate, it will be illuminating to hear commentator Tim Lucas contrast I vampiri with the U.S. recut version The Devil’s Commandment.\n\nRadiance also has a special edition on the way of Benjamin Christensen’s ultra-creepy silent infotainment documentary Häxan. Also listed as Coming Soon, it carries three alternate music scores, and a couple of additional re-cut versions.\n\nThanks for reading! — Glenn Erickson\n\nHello!\n\nIt’s another article forwarded by Joe Dante … the Brave New AI Future World has found another way to squeeze money from the culture — by body-snatching celebrity voices.\n\nWe first noted this 30 years ago, when CGI made it possible for ad men to repurpose classic Fred Astaire musical numbers — they took shots in which he dances with a coat rack and a cane, replaced them with a vacuum cleaner, and created instant clever TV commercials that trivialized Astaire’s art. Astaire’s widow routinely blocked use of the dancer’s film clips to promote his movies, and in 1992 refused to allow clips of her husband to be used to honor Ginger Rogers at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. But she readily licensed his image for paid advertising.\n\nAn AI company has something just as questionable in mind, thanks to new technologies: Judy Garland’s resurrected voice can be digitally configured to read an audiobook of The Wizard of Oz. I can imagine the editors salting in charming little Judy laughs and giggles here and there, all authentic, all re-jiggered. Their message is clear — given enough vocal samples, They can make anybody say whatever they want them to say.\n\nThe article is from CNN, written by Samantha Murphy Kelly:\n\nHollywood Stars’ Estates Agree to the Use of Their Voices with AI\n\nAnd none other than Gary Teetzel breaks the news to us about the most fantastic home video announcement of the year …\n\nVinegar Syndrome, which recently brought us incredible 4K Ultra HD restorations of The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors and Phase IV, not to mention remasters of arcane items like Kinski’s Paganini and The Playgirls and the Vampire…\n\n… is going the extra kilometer to produce a lavish 4K Ultra HD special edition of an incredible cinematic (or Cinemagic) achievement:\n\nReptilicus 4K\n\nNo stone has been left unturned, let alone any frozen flesh fragment found in the Arctic tundra. The deluxe disc presentation will bring collectors the ultimate in Tillicus-Friendly extras: a commentary, image galleries, several visual essays with amusingly serious-sounding titles. The esteemed personnel announced as attached include Nicolas Barbano, Stephen R. Bissette, Jay Jennings, C. Courtney Joyner, Kim Newman & Robert Parigi.\n\nThe kicker extra is a Blu-ray encoding of the Alternate Danish version of Reptilicus directed by Poul Bang. It’s quite different, and includes the infamous ‘Tillicus song’ by Dirch Passer and the even infamous-er Flying Reptilicus scenes.\n\nSo maybe we have a “Tivoli Night” delight in store. The promotional materials don’t list a specific release date yet.\n\nWe look forward to once again covering Sidney Pink’s Danish Delight … you must admit, “Reptilicus” is one fantastic-sounding title for a giant monster movie. We saw it new in ’62, a very strange kiddie matinee experience for a ten-year-old … I remember staring at that poster as if the movie were made expressly for ME.\n\nThanks for reading! — Glenn Erickson\n\nHello!\n\nIt’s Book Review time again at CineSavant, only because we can’t resist the classic Universal movie lore found in BearManor’s book series Scripts from the Crypt. I’m not exactly sure how long the series has been around, but I’ve reviewed a stack of them, with coverage of Bride of the Gorilla (scroll to May 18), Dracula’s Daughter, Boris Karloff’s The Veil (scroll down to June 9), Son of Dracula, The Brute Man, Mr. Sardonicus, The Mummy’s Hand, The Mummy’s Tomb and The Mummy’s Ghost. They must be doing something right — I’m still curious to see more.\n\nThe last year or so brought us several 1940s Mummy sequels; this time around they’ve chosen one of the better ’40s pictures, The Ghost of Frankenstein from 1942. If you recall, it’s the fourth movie in Uni’s Frankenstein franchise, following the classic Son of from three years before; this one reunites The Monster with Bela Lugosi’s Ygor. It’s Lon Chaney Jr. underneath the Jack Pierce monster makeup — we’re told that this was the show that confirmed Chaney as a successful monster star. He also dropped the ‘Jr.’ from his billing.\n\nWe also meet the other Frankenstein brother Ludwig, played by actor Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Seeing a knighted Brit thesp in a Universal horror outing always seemed a little odd, as if Greta Garbo had come out of retirement to appear on TV’s Celebrity Bowling.\n\nTom Weaver still ramrods the book series. He provides the seemingly limitless research notes, trade mentions, interview gems and general throw-the-net-wide info grab over every aspect of the picture, from minor players to exhibitor reactions, and later fan and revival rumblings. Top-billed writer Gregory W. Mank wrote the leadoff historical essay, condensing the preparation for and filming of the show into about 90 dense pages. Images to illustrate the text are brought in from everywhere, from official stills, frame blowups, and photos from newspaper morgues. Contributing writers Frank Dello Stritto, Bill Cooke, Roger Hurlburt, Michael A. Hoey and Scott Gallinghouse dish up a wide variey of bio pieces and analysis of character development in the franchise: You say Ygor, I say Igor.\n\nOne big theme here is Lon Chaney’s erratic rise to stardom. At times he seems an alcoholic loose cannon, playing cruel pranks on Evelyn Ankers; then he’s the darling of publicity, a swell guy described as kind to dogs and children. If the clippings and witness statements are to be believed, Chaney practically adopted the moppet playing ‘The Monster’s friend’ in this installment, four-year-old Janet Ann Gallow. Weaver is his usual wary self, scrutinizing pub feeds and interviews for the Baloney Factor. He leads the way with the debunking of a casting myth about kid actor William Smith.\n\nThe birth of Dr. Hfuhruhurr?\n\nThe other concentration of analysis is Ghost of Frankenstein’s somewhat goofy but genuinely interesting ‘Musical Brains’ brain-transplant theme … this is the one where Ygor’s brain gets slotted into The Monster’s head, in place of the brain of a benign scientist. The Monster apparently wanted the little kid’s brain, for some reason. We 1960s kids in front of our 19″ TVs were weirded-out by the spectacle of Chaney’s Monster speaking with Lugosi’s voice. Weaver and Mank tell us about unused script pages that gave Ygor a ‘conquer the world’ motivation; they also talk about scenes shot for the next movie in the series, Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, in which Ygor comes back, somehow, even though The Monster speaks with Ygor’s voice … I don’t think I paid close enough attention to these derailed movie ideas. The upshot of it is that, after speaking only in Bride, The Monster would remain a mute automaton until he met Lou Costello: “Yes, Master.”\n\nThe Scripts from the Crypt series still entertains — the original screenplay is present plus the formal essay plus reams of semi-organized research gleanings and images of every piece of promotional artwork generated for the movie. It all comes with Tom Weaver’s commitment to veracity … if something isn’t a nailed-down fact, Tom makes sure to say so loud and clear. How well might Tom perform on a debate broadcast?\n\nThe book comes in both soft and hardcover editions.\n\nAs long as we’re on the subject of BRAINS, correspondent Michael McQuarrie links us to another fascinating film listing by Periscope Film. It’s a public information film about ‘passive brainwashing’ in Korean POW camps. Hosted by Ronald Reagan, it is sometimes labeled as propaganda: The Ultimate Weapon.\n\nArchive.org’s somewhat agenda’ed description says that it “was produced by Film Consultants of California in an effort to back an anti-Communist campaign that was part of the Red Scare.” The dramatic scenes are fairly corny, but not much more than other Hollywood war films of the day. It is a bit like The Manchurian Candidate, except that the Red Chinese use only psychology to break down the POWS. Even thought they do nothing overtly violent, the American prisoners fail to organize against their captors, or even to prevent the spread of disease.\n\nForget the camaraderie of The Great Escape. Ronald Reagan’s voiceover reports that some men die just from ‘give up-itis’: “If only the boy’s family, and school and church had helped him grasp and develop the idea of personal responsibility and obligation.” Oh, now we get it — the American POWS are falling apart because liberal values have sapped their rugged pioneer spirit. They’re waiting for ‘the government’ to do something instead of doing it themselves.\n\nThe shocker is Reagan’s summing-up speech, which changes gears to tell the audience that we are all stoops being suckered by Commie traitors in our midst. It’s a quick diatribe against the social safety net and American ‘softness’ that will make it easy for Communists to conquer us. “So-called broadmindedness, tolerance and sophistication can destroy as as surely as any nuclear advice.” It’s scare tactics 101, and the country ate it up.\n\nWhat kind of stealth production is this? The movie is very cagey with its abbreviated titles. A Google search for the ‘Film Consultants of California’ turned up nothing. The movie is a polished Hollywood production, but neither it nor the director (Robert Cashy?) or the screenwriter (Charles W. Cromer?) appear in the IMDB, that I can see. [Nothing necessarily sinister about that, as the IMDB does have its info gaps here and there.] Editor Hugo Grimaldi is a real name, and so is cameraman Arthur Feindel; The Ultimate Weapon doesn’t show in their IMDB filmographies.\n\nSeveral actors are very familiar … but I was only able to identify one, Del Monroe. → His face is familiar from old TV episodes of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. I’m less certain about Robert Dowdell, also from the same TV show. Can anybody help me with some of the others?\n\nI still have an altered print of this movie in 16mm. It must have been a junked print because the titles have been hacked off. My copy was altered for later use — in public meetings? The final anti-Communist speech is replaced with an even cruder ‘feel good’ speech in which Reagan tells us to reject Communism because it will take away our consumer paradise — a montage of images of new cars and a well-stocked grocery meat meat counter is added! In my re-edited copy, Reagan begins his wrap-up with the words, “Now I know you hate Communism … !”\n\nThanks for reading! — Glenn Erickson"
