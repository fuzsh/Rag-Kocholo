        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhen many US and European spectators first encounter mainstream Mexican films and telenovelas, their reaction is frequently one of bewilderment. Often these spectators cannot help but ask something to the effect of “Why is everyone so White?”1 What they mean, of course, is that the predominance of people with European epidermal schemas2 in film and television produced in Mexico clashes forcefully with their own racialized understanding of Mexicanness and their (often unquestioned) acceptance that, with respect to themselves, Mexicanness is radical alterity.\n\nThough the mediatic image of White preponderance has always contrasted starkly with the country’s demography, as Charles Ramírez Berg and Dolores Tierney have observed, Whites have still enthroned themselves as the universal image of Mexican society in film and media, in part because of their political and economic dominance.3 Local media producers established racialized norms of representation by which heroes and protagonists have been largely represented by actors whose phenotypes conform to the physical requirements of Whiteness in Mexico, while those with epidermal schemas that do not fall within the parameters of Mexican Whiteness are often relegated to the roles of villainous or comedic characters.4 In recent years, Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta has publicly identified these norms as racist practices within the national film industry, which, in his own words, limit Mexican men of color like himself to the roles of “jodido, sufridor y … ratero” (the fucked, the suffering and … the thief).5\n\nWhen this norm is not adhered to, racist backlash ensues. The case of Alfonso Cuarón’s 2018 film Roma, which featured an actress of Mixtec origin, Yalitza Aparicio, is illustrative. Aparicio’s centrality in the film produced racist indignation in the form of insults and calls to disqualify her from the Ariel Awards (the annual awards held by the Mexican Academy of Film),6 a sentiment ostensibly exacerbated by the international acclaim the film garnered, including an Oscar nomination for Aparicio’s performance. Throughout 2018 and 2019, the fact that this “india”7 was representing Mexico on the world stage through the prestigious medium of auteur cinema at international festivals and award shows was, according to many Mexicans, a problem.8\n\nThe position of Whiteness as the norm9 in Mexican film and media is particularly perverse in light of the country’s majority mestizo demography. The degree of mediatic distortion carried out by this norm and the virulence with which it is defended confers on Mexican film and media’s privileging of Whiteness a unique ideological force that this book uncovers. That ideological force is the coloniality of power. Through this term, sociologist and political theorist Aníbal Quijano has suggested that the experience of Spanish colonialism established asymmetrical power relations according to the racialized distribution of labor defined during that period.10 His concept also refers to how political, economic, and social inequalities have persisted along racial lines in the centuries since Latin American republics’ independence from Spain.11 Furthermore, as elaborated by Walter Mignolo,12 the term coloniality exceeds what Stuart Hall has called the economic approach to racism and refers also to the ever evolving cultural and ideological structures of “dominance” that have accompanied racism’s original “ ‘economic nucleus.’ ”13 In this sense, the coloniality of power has much in common with what Homi Bhabha has referred to as “colonial discourse as an apparatus of power.”14\n\nIn Mexico, one of the clearest manifestations of the coloniality of power is the continued social and aesthetic valuing of Whiteness that has persisted long after colonial rule. As in all societies forged in colonialism and coloniality,15 Whiteness in Mexico confers social, economic, and aesthetic privilege to those who are perceived to possess it. This reality permeates all aspects of social existence and is prominently manifested in the country’s (audio)visual cultural production. Mexican cinema has been a key instrument serving to reinforce a local ideal of Whiteness through the exaltation of White Mexican bodies on-screen and the steering of spectatorial desire toward those bodies.\n\nThis book addresses a specific display of the ubiquity of Whiteness in Mexico’s audiovisual landscape and one that speaks to the intensity with which the showcasing of Whiteness is inextricably tied to colonized notions of beauty and desire: its historical pervasiveness even in fiction films that explicitly claim to represent Indigeneity. This volume builds on the excellent existing scholarship pointing to the racial politics in Mexican cinema during the Golden Age (roughly from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s)16—a period of film production frequently credited with having a profound impact on Mexican culture and society. Expanding on the valuable work of Joanna Hershfield, Charles Ramírez Berg, Andrea Noble, and Dolores Tierney, among others,17 this volume examines the duration of a local, idiosyncratic form of racial masquerade18 that I term whiteness-as-indigeneity.19 From a decolonial perspective20 grounded in the history of race relations in Mexico, this volume elucidates how, throughout the Golden Age, the White Indians of Mexican cinema manifest the unresolved tension between two ideological formations. On the one hand was the government’s twentieth-century postrevolutionary discourse that symbolically celebrated Indigeneity, and, on the other, was the persistent, long-standing valorization of a local construct of Whiteness that began with colonialism and was transformed through subsequent discourses of modernity during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A result of this tension, whiteness-as-indigeneity is the limit case of the racist norms that have structured audiovisual production in Mexico. Like its hemispheric cousin, blackface, whiteness-as-indigeneity is characterized by a “tendentiously flawed mimesis.”21 However, instead of seeking to ridicule the racialized subject, the Mexican trope—not unlike the Whitening of Roma people in Spanish cinema as analyzed by Eva Woods Peiró22—works in the opposite direction, infusing the racialized subject with the dignity and desirability that coloniality confers upon Whiteness.\n\nTo understand how the reelaborated vestiges of colonial racial hierarchies reemerge in visual mediums such as twentieth-century cinema, it is necessary to approach the subject of Whiteness in the Mexican context by considering the evolution of racial categories and their role in shaping projects of national identity.\n\nThe Persistent Privilege of Whiteness in Mexico\n\nThe constructs of the Indian and of Indigeneity are European inventions that homogenized the original inhabitants of what came to be known as the Americas23 and cast them as Other vis-à-vis the colonizer. The precise meaning of the term and who is considered an Indian has evolved over time under what Mexican anthropologist Paula López Caballero has termed “national regimes of alterity,”24 which have each brought with them new terms to designate the constructed Otherness of the native inhabitants and their progeny, including terms such as autóctonos, indios, pueblos originarios (the autochthonous, Indians, original inhabitants, etc.) as well as the “constant slippage and strategic ambiguity” of the terms Indian, mestizo, and campesino.25 Whiteness, which in the local Mexican racial formation functions as the polar opposite of Indigeneity,26 is an equally fabricated and ever-evolving social identity. Throughout the book, my use of the terms “White,” “Whiteness,” “Indian,” “Indigenous,” and “Indigeneity” are not meant to reify the notion that such hermetic racial groups exist as verifiable scientific realities. Rather, I use the terms to refer to the constructed nature of these ethnoracial categories in Mexico specifically, and to the very real social, economic, and emotional effects that the perception of one’s belonging to these categories has in lived experience.\n\nFurthermore, my treatment of Whiteness in Mexico refers to a person’s ability to locate themselves on the “right” side of what Mignolo has termed modernity/coloniality—the “set of diverse but coherent narratives” produced by “the Western Christian version of humanity, complemented by secular de-Goding narratives of science, economic progress, political democracy, and lately globalization …”27 In the Mexican context, modernity/coloniality has constructed Indigeneity as the bane of these discourses, fixating on the following as points of supposed inferiority in various stages: Indigenous paganism, alternative ways of knowing, models of economic subsistence, communal organization, apathy toward the nation-state and its “democracy,” protections for local economies, and so forth. In Homi Bhabha’s terms, this is the process by which the subjects of the (post)colonial discourse of power execute the “containment” of the colonized and produce “that limited form of otherness … called the stereotype.”28 Because of the ambivalence of (post)colonial discourse, not only is the pejorative position of the colonized within it ever shifting as the discourse evolves through time, but the placement of the colonized is also unstable within a given phase of the discourse.29\n\nMoreover, as Satya P. Mohanty has argued, the process of racialization not only “creates stereotypes of the colonized as ‘other’ and as inferior … the colonizer too develops a cultural identity that survives well past the formal context of colonial rule.”30 In other words, the ongoing process of pejoratively racializing the colonized necessarily also yields the fabrication of a shifting but always privileged category of Whiteness defined by its correlation to the current regime of modernity. To name this aspect of Whiteness, I borrow and expand a term elaborated by Latin American philosopher Bolívar Echeverría, blanquitud. For him, blanquitud refers to an individual’s internalization of a specific discourse of modernity—the “ethos puritano capitalista” (puritanical capitalist ethos) that values above all else a high degree of productivity and the external, material wealth that such productivity yields.31 For my purposes in this book, blanquitud refers not only to this “puritanical capitalist ethos”—the current regime of modernity that Echeverría has brilliantly theorized—but also to the previous discourses of Western modernity that have taken root in Mexico beginning with the Spanish conquest and continue to exist in residual forms. In this sense, the discursive and performative dimension of Whiteness that I refer to as blanquitud is an aggregate of the discourses of Western modernity in Mexico.\n\nAt the same time, however, Whiteness and Indigeneity are not merely discursive or performative positionalities, but ones with a very real embodied component that imposes limits to performativity for those with racialized epidermal schemas.32 To refer to the quality of having genealogical ties to Europe and an epidermal schema that is read as European, this book uses the term blancura.\n\nIn what follows, I provide a brief outline of the ways in which the definitions of Whiteness in Mexico have been functions of the colonial matrix of power,33 evolving from the sixteenth century to the twentieth to reflect the prevailing discourse of modernity of a given period while, simultaneously, the justification of Indigenous inferiority reflected Indigenous people’s supposed incompatibility with each of those discourses. Throughout the past five centuries, the ability to embody Mexican Whiteness—in its various discursive and corporal definitions—has been a persistent source of privilege.\n\nSpanish colonialism is the underlying historical reality that has structured the asymmetrical positing of different ethnoracial identities in Mexico, though these have since continued to evolve in complex ways. The fact of colonial dominance meant that access to political power, land, and wealth were greater depending on one’s proximity to Spanishness. Of course, not all Spaniards or genealogical claims of Spanish origin were equal. In the fifteenth century, the concept of limpieza de sangre (purity of blood) evolved in Spain to distinguish Jews and Muslims who had recently converted to Christianity (respectively known as conversos and moriscos) from people whose families had been Christian for more than two generations.34 The 1449 limpieza de sangre statutes prevented these new Christians from holding public office in Spain, and the establishment of the Inquisition in 1478 heightened their persecution.35 The principles of limpieza de sangre were applied in New Spain, with Indigenous people becoming “pure of blood” upon conversion to Christianity, while Africans and their descendants did not have a clear path to attaining this status because of the perception of their ties with Islam, which became the justification for their enslavement.36 The casta painting genre in New Spain—more a reflection of the elite’s hope that neat boundaries among racial groups could be named and maintained than a historical document of how the colonial order operated—corroborated the idea that Indigeneity could smoothly fold into Spanishness.37 While these images show that the descendant of an Indigenous person could be considered Spanish over just a few generations, these same images suggest that an Afro-descendant’s Blackness could unexpectedly resurface even after several generations of mixing with Spaniards.38 The name given to an Afro-descendant whose phenotype prominently manifested Black ancestry after several generations of genealogical Whitening in these paintings, torna atrás, literally suggests regression, thus underscoring Whitening as the ideal direction of one’s lineage in the colonial context.\n\nDespite the relative privilege of Indigenous people according to these representations, they were in effect deemed a childlike variant of humanity.39 In practice, having converso, Indigenous, or African heritage in New Spain “could create suspicion and possibly exclude a person from public office, university entrance or ordination in the Church”40—which constituted nearly all of the avenues to political power and/or wealth. Furthermore, the stigma of illegitimacy, which had already been an obstacle to political and economic ascent in Spain, kept many mestizos from being able to acquire purity of blood status.41 In sum, in New Spain, the more one could approximate Whiteness in the form of a legitimate Spanish lineage untainted by converso, Indigenous, or African heritage, the greater one’s educational, economic, and political opportunities. In this context, Whitening did not necessarily refer to ensuring one’s offspring had a chromatically lighter appearance; rather, it meant securing a specific legal status that some Spaniards and criollos (the progeny of Spaniards born in the Americas) enjoyed because of their genealogies.42\n\nAfter Mexican independence from Spain, the 1821 Plan of Iguala established the legal equality of all of the republic’s inhabitants, and the following year Congress ordered the omission of racial classifications in all legal documents.43 This shift brought Mexico closer, at least discursively, to the European model of modern nationhood, which required a substantial degree of homogeneity among fellow co-nationals. However, despite the elimination of the term “Indian” as a legal category,44 governing elites were aware of the need to negotiate the internal ethnic and racial heterogeneity of the population for the purposes of producing national cohesion.45 Within this negotiation of internal difference, the construct of Indigeneity and the identification of its proper place and function within the new nation became an ongoing concern. These anxieties about Indigeneity did not emerge in a vacuum; rather they built on and evolved previous ideas. As Rachell Sánchez-Rivera has argued, in the nineteenth century “preconceived notions of honorability, respectability and purity of blood were subsumed within new scientific ideas to manage and control reproduction, framed within the terms of an ‘ideal’ mixing of people consequently determining the ideal Mexican citizen after the Independence in 1821.”46\n\nFundamentally, Indigenous people were a source of frustration for governing elites in the nineteenth century because of the former’s perceived incompatibility with elite designs of “progress”—a Eurocentric ideological orientation shaped by the Enlightenment, social Darwinism, and positivism.47 From the elite perspective, part of the problem was that Indigenous people did not perceive themselves as national subjects. As Mexican historian Beatriz Urías Horcasitas observes, prominent public and academic figures of the period such as Francisco Pimentel and Rafael de Zayas Enriquez complained that Indigenous people lacked any sense of belonging to the Mexican nation-state.48 Still, the greatest impediment that Indigenous people posed for national development according to elites was their supposedly unproductive use of the land according to modern, nineteenth-century standards.49 Within a vision of economic development based on the exporting of raw materials on a massive scale, Indigenous people’s landownership and their alternative use of that land for subsistence purposes was cast as a serious economic liability for the nation.50 The new nineteenth-century legal framework in which all Mexicans were, at least nominally, equal under the law led to the erosion of Indigenous people’s previous condition of semiautonomy, rights to communal lands, and other protections.51\n\nThe so-called “guerras de castas”—Indigenous uprisings that took place in various regions of the country aiming to regain appropriated lands—greatly heightened the urgency of “el problema del indio” (the Indian question) for elites.52 In the north, José María Leyva Cajeme led the uprising of the Yaquis in Sonora, governing a Yaqui state from 1875 to 1886 until the government sold the Yaquis to henequen plantation owners in Yucatan.53 The Tzotzil Mayans in Chiapas rose up under the leadership of Pedro Días Cuscat from 1867 to 1870, while Manuel Lozada led Indian resistance to hacendado encroachment in Jalisco and present-day Nayarit from the 1850s until 1873.54 The Indigenous uprising of greatest magnitude by multiple measures was the Caste War of Yucatan in which Mayans fought against Whites and mestizos on the peninsula from 1847 into the twentieth century, achieving self-governance for a period of time.55 The zeal with which elites held the exploitation of private lands to be crucial to national “progress” is clear in the calls to annihilate those Indigenous groups who rebelled against the expropriation of their lands.56 These conflicts and the debates surrounding them laid bare the endurance of a racialized perspective in governance and the persistence of heterogeneous ethnoracial identities in Mexico despite the erasure of racial language in official documentation. Indigeneity was now an undesirable categorization because it acquired the connotation of being antithetical to “progress” and national economic interests.57\n\nAnother dimension of elite anxieties about Indigeneity was linked to the emergence of positivism in the nineteenth century and the implications of Lamarckian understandings of heredity, which had a unique endurance in Mexico.58 Believing that the propensity toward alcoholism, destitution, illness, crime, and prostitution were inheritable characteristics, scientists in emerging disciplines such as social hygiene, anthropology, sociology, psychiatry, and legal medicine saw “in society’s poorest sectors a latent and imminent threat of national degeneration.”59 In this context, Indigenous people in the second half of the nineteenth century became one of the many social groups categorized as degenerate, in multiple senses of the word.60 For instance, anthropologists Francisco Martínez Baca and Manuel Vergara’s 1892 study of crime associated Indigeneity with lawlessness and “social deviation.”61 For sociologist Rafael de Zayas Enríquez, the biological heredity of Indigenous people was intrinsically degenerative, meaning that they were destined to disappear because each successive generation was increasingly afflicted with disease and vice.62 In this context of scientism, anthropometrics often functioned as “proof” of Indigenous people’s supposed biological and genetic inferiority.63 As Oliva López Sánchez observes, during the Porfiriato (the period between 1876 and 1911 during which Porfirio Díaz served as president for seven terms), some scientists concluded that Mexican women’s bodies were not well suited for childbirth because of their pelvic measurements, which were smaller than those of European women.64 The implication of their studies is that racial mixture produced female bodies that were inadequate for reproduction65 and, more specifically, that the biological contribution of Indigeneity was to blame for this deficiency. In these ways, nineteenth-century scientific paradigms and practices reinforced previous racial hierarchies, casting Indigenous people among society’s most wretched and rationalizing under scientific auspices the superiority of upper-class subjects who exhibited hygienic, moral, racial, educational, and cultural ideals.66\n\nTo address the threat that, according to elites, Indigeneity posed to the progress and development of the nation, liberals proposed various forms of assimilationism.67 This strategy for nation-building found expression in the writings of politicians and intellectuals such as Vicente Riva Palacio and Justo Sierra in the late nineteenth century68 and later in Andrés Molina Enriquez’s Los grandes problemas nacionales completed in 1910—all of which pointed to mestizaje as the avenue for achieving national cohesion and progress in Mexico.69 The proposal that a thorough mixing of the country’s Indigenous and European elements would bring about national cohesion and vitality flew in the face of contemporary European pronouncements on racial mixture, such as those by Arthur de Gobineau,70 which saw in miscegenation “the epitome of human degeneration.”71 Still, because the liberal discourse in the second half of the nineteenth century cast Indigeneity as an undesirable location of biological and cultural origin from which one needed to evolve, it constitutes what Alicia Castellanos Guerrero understands as the renewed Mexican racism of the nineteenth century, distinct but informed by the previous racial hierarchies.72 While Spanishness still featured as part of the White ideal—evident in the centrality that speaking the Spanish language and sharing the Catholic faith had as markers of assimilation73—the understanding of Whiteness as it evolved in the nineteenth century also incorporated the nations of the North Atlantic, whose technological advancements and capitalist projects Mexican elites aspired to imitate.74 In this way, nineteenth-century assimilationism continued to privilege Whiteness and introduced mestizaje as a desirable ethnoracial identity.\n\nFor governing elites in the second half of the nineteenth century, one of the strategies for creating a mestizaje that would result in national progress involved promoting the immigration of Whites from North America and Europe.75 This plan was the topic of impassioned debates in the national congress, and it was supported by various political figures, including the prominent intellectual Justo Sierra.76 The arrival of large quantities of White immigrants, liberals hoped, would “improve the race” and mitigate cultural and technological backwardness in Mexico.77 At the same time, naturalization laws were put in place to block migrants deemed undesirable for Mexican mestizaje, including Jewish, Japanese, Afro-Caribbean, and Chinese people.78\n\nIn addition to promoting biological mestizaje, politicians and intellectuals such as Manuel Orozco y Berra and Francisco Pimentel also saw education as a vehicle to assimilate Indigenous Mexicans into a hegemonic criollo/mestizo culture.79 The idea that Indigenous people could become intellectually equal to Whites through a Western education departed from the biological racism of the day according to which Indigenous people were irremediably inferior to Europeans and their descendants. However, the premise of assimilationism through education was, nonetheless, that Indigenous people’s culture kept them in a state of backwardness and that they therefore needed to be improved through Eurocentric culture. That some of the most illustrious men of the century had either partial or full Indigenous ancestry—José María Morelos, Benito Juárez, Ignacio Altamirano, and Porfirio Díaz—seemed to confirm liberals’ hopes for the role of education. The Sociedad Indianista Mexicana, founded at the end of the Porfiriato, embodied the belief in Indigenous regeneration through both foreign migration and schooling.80 In sum, by both exposing Indigenous people to Western education and increasing the presence of Europeans and Euro-Americans in the national gene pool, nineteenth-century Mexican intellectuals and politicians invested in nation building hoped to create a more homogenous and Whiter citizenry.\n\nIn contrast to the colonial period in which genealogical Whiteness possessed a greater weight,81 the nineteenth century illustrates an important transformation of racial understandings in Mexico. Because, as we have seen, by then Indigeneity connoted both material poverty and backwardness, degrees of social Whitening were indeed possible through a combination of economic success and acculturation.82 Cultural and material transformations now allowed for a greater fluidity of racial and ethnic identities than had previously been possible. However, the sociopolitical landscape remained a racist one, preserving its “link between essentialist representations of race and social structures of domination,” the criteria that according to sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant define any racist social project.83\n\nAfter the Mexican Revolution and under a corporatist model, the new government reaffirmed commitments to progress and modernity, which now meant achieving comparable levels of technological sophistication, health, and economic growth with the United States and Western Europe.84 This endeavor involved extending resources to Indigenous and campesino populations as well as incorporating them into the nation-state. These interrelated projects of indigenismo and mestizaje85 also inaugurated a new national discourse that made Indigenous people and mestizos its protagonists in an effort to visibly exalt the new national subjects. However, Whiteness (blancura and blanquitud) continued to hold value in Mexico, which is reflected in the official postrevolutionary ideology that incorporates aspects of Indigeneity symbolically, but exalts its Whitened counterpart, mestizaje,86 as the nation’s common “fictive ethnicity.”87 As social scientists Regina Martínez Casas, Emiko Saldívar, René D. Flores, Christina A. Sue, and colleagues have noted, “Indigenista policy … played a central role in constructing and defining mestizos as being nonindigenous individuals.”88 On the one hand, Indigeneity now functioned as a symbol of Mexican particularity; on the other, it played a fundamental role in the cult of mestizaje as a marker of the distance that the mestizo had traveled into modernity and into Mexican national subjectivity.89\n\nTo realize their project for a modern mestizo Mexico, postrevolutionary Mexican politicians and intellectuals adapted nineteenth-century perspectives toward Indigenous people but essentially pursued the same assimilationist approach rooted in racism.90 Within the inherited positivist and evolutionist framework in which Mexican intellectuals and politicians continued to operate after the Revolution, Indigenous people were not racially inferior in a biological sense, but they could not contribute substantially to Mexican modernity beyond providing the archaeological and historical markers that endowed the nation with symbolic specificity.91 For José Vasconcelos, the secretary of public education from 1921 to 1924 who put forth a utopic vision of racial amalgamation in Latin America, Indigenous people’s contribution to mestizaje consisted of their “countless number of properly spiritual capacities.”92 Echoing their nineteenth-century counterparts’ faith in education as a force of national amalgamation, some of the most emblematic postrevolutionary efforts to “improve” Mexican citizenry include the Cultural Missions designed by Vasconcelos, which from 1921 to 1924 traveled to rural areas for the purpose of priming young Mexicans for instruction in modern public schools.93 Also, from 1926 to 1932 the Casa del Estudiante Indígena in Mexico City housed and educated rural Indigenous male youths with the goal that they would return to their communities to spread a civic sensibility and modernization.94 In subsequent decades, influential anthropologists such as Alfonso Caso and Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán would continue supporting indigenista policies that prioritized integration and acculturation, albeit with their own nuances.95\n\nThose preoccupied with engineering an ideal Mexican citizenry shared with their Porfirian counterparts the desire to minimize the presence of elements deemed “degenerative” in the national gene pool.96 Though the concerns of Mexican eugenicists exceeded the Indigenous question—targeting alcoholism, prostitution, and socioeconomic marginality as well—twentieth-century eugenicist doctors frequently established links between Indigenous people and tendencies toward delinquency and mental illness.97 In addition, Mexican eugenicists of the period considered vagrancy and alcoholism to be Indigenous traits.98\n\nThe academics, doctors, intellectuals, and politicians who belonged to the Sociedad Eugénica Mexicana para el Mejoramiento de la Raza (Mexican Society of Eugenics for the Improvement of the Race), founded in 1931, perceived a need for “social prophylaxis”—measures intended to safeguard the health, vitality, and ideal of mestizaje among the Mexican citizenry.99 Members of the group, including the “father” of Mexican anthropology, Manuel Gamio, at times voiced recommendations very similar to those suggested throughout the previous century and its political regimes. For instance, group members played a role in drafting the migration law of 1926, which distinguished potential immigrants as either “assimilable” or “unassimilable,” resulting in the denial of naturalization to many Jewish and Chinese applicants and the favoring of immigrants from Spain.100 In addition, Gilberto Loyo, a demographer close to President Plutarco Elías Calles; and Alfredo Saavedra, a surgeon, professor, and the Society’s first president, supported the immigration of White foreigners to Mexico.101 The Society’s members eschewed traditional racial determinism, especially during and after the Nazi regime.102 However, as Sánchez-Rivera observes, the group merely replaced biological racism with cultural racism—which, according to Etienne Balibar, uses the concept of culture to reproduce hierarchies of people who are supposedly incompatible with one another.103 In sum, newly armed with twentieth-century pseudoscience, Mexican intellectuals and politicians understood Whiteness (blancura and blanquitud) as the key ingredient that would ensure an ideal blending of the Mexican citizenry into a healthy and modern mestizo people, producing “solutions” whose justifications may have been new, but whose substance certainly was not.\n\nTwentieth-century indigenismo-mestizaje (this hyphenation reflecting that they were two sides of the same coin)104 was predicated on the inferiority of Indigeneity and therefore was a racist national construct. As Gómez Izquierdo explains, “Indigenist ideology is based on a racist view of the Indian to define its policies of assimilation or integration into national culture … Being mestizo is better than being an Indian, it represents progress towards Mexico’s dreamed-of europeanization.”105 Ultimately, as numerous scholars have concluded, indigenismo-mestizaje is a particularly pernicious racist ideology precisely because it pretends to be raceless.106 This social history results in a complex reality in Mexico in which “Indian ancestry has been proudly acknowledged … [but] society … clearly values whiteness as both a status symbol and as an aesthetic.”107\n\nIn recent years, social scientists have noted the contradiction between the raceless discourse of Mexican mestizaje and the privileging of Whiteness that exists in everyday society.108 Specifically, Mónica Moreno Figueroa observes that “passing towards ‘whiteness’—in its peculiar Mexican version—is still a goal for the inhabitants, a problematic area in terms of identity and a non-spoken rule of social stratification.”109 Her findings and those of other scholars110 point to Whiteness as an enduring form of physical capital111 in Mexican society. In his elaboration of the term, sociologist Chris Shilling expands on Bourdieu’s analysis of the body, explaining that through the notion of physical capital, the body can be understood as a “possessor of power, status and distinctive symbolic forms which is integral to the accumulation of various resources” allowing for “the development of bodies in ways that are recognized as having value in social fields …”112 Given the racist nature of the Mexican “social field” outlined here, the Whiteness (blancura and blanquitud) of the Mexican body—understood not strictly in chromatic terms, but as a combination of physical features, hair texture, classed speech patterns, dress, wealth, body height and build, gait, hygiene, posture, and mannerisms—is a source of power that confers social and economic advantage.113\n\nAs I hope the historical outline above makes clear, the term “Whiteness” as used in this book is tied specifically to Mexican social and historical realities. This contextual understanding of Whiteness is in tune with Omi and Winant’s concept of “the racial formation,” which refers to a historically and socially situated project within which human bodies and social structures are represented and organized.114 Several decades earlier, sociologist Harry Hoetink had already alluded to the ways in which various definitions of Whiteness are contextual, as in, for example, the existence of a “white Iberian somatic norm image” in the Caribbean that is distinct from and darker than that of northwestern Europe.115 This same White Iberian ideal—the visage of the first Western discourse of modernity imposed in what is now Mexico116—still serves as the baseline definition of blancura in the country, according to which criollo and mestizo bodies are read as physically White in the Mexican context.117 Furthermore, because Mexican modernity is characterized by multitemporal simultaneity,118 the physical construct of Whiteness in Mexico is a spectrum reflecting the personifications of all subsequent Western discourses of modernity. The boundaries of Mexican Whiteness, therefore, are the “Iberian variant of Hispanic whiteness, a white face with dark-brown to black hair”119 on the darker end and the blond, blue-eyed, Anglo US-inspired phenotype on the lighter end.\n\nI wish to emphasize that all of the other cultural and economic markers (blanquitud) listed above inform the local construct of Whiteness. This confluence of factors has led Regina Martínez Casas and colleagues to demonstrate that skin-color distinctions in Mexico are highly ambiguous and do not determine the way Mexicans self-identify ethnically or racially.120 For this reason, the terms “Indian” and “Indigenous” are also similarly constructed and signal a combination of physical, cultural, and socioeconomic markers.\n\nYet despite the multifaceted nature of Mexican Whiteness, the physical dimension (blancura) does at times operate as a defining boundary that one cannot dress, dye, exercise, or surgically alter one’s way out of. Here, the work of anthropologist Hugo Cerón Anaya is highly illustrative. Cerón-Anaya perceptively disentangles the relationship between race and class in Mexico by challenging the full accuracy of the familiar adage “money Whitens.” He demonstrates that although lower- and middle-class individuals with darker epidermal schemas can impact how they are racialized through increased wealth, consumption, and cosmetic changes to their body, money’s Whitening effect diminishes among the upper-middle and upper class, where nonpurchasable forms of Whiteness, such as family pedigree and a White Mexican phenotype, are of extreme importance.121 Thus, although the Mexican racial formation is a landscape characterized by ambiguity, there remains a crucial relationship between one’s body and the latitude available for one to position the self within the colonial matrix of power.\n\nIndigenista Visual Production and Cultural Anxiety\n\nCritics have debated the role that cultural production has played in the construction of the nation as an idea and in the formation of national subjectivities and identities. Following Benedict Anderson’s well-known study of print capitalism for the creation of national imaginaries122 and Homi Bhabha’s discussion of narratives as texts that simultaneously perform the nation while casting their contents as national signifiers,123 Radcliffe and Westwood have demonstrated the crucial role of cultural production in the formation of national subjectivities in Latin America.124 In light of Nestor García Canclini’s observation that Mexico’s cultural profile was established more through visual production than through literature,125 it follows that visual cultural production is a privileged locus for understanding the role of culture in the forging of twentieth-century Mexican nationalism.126 For this reason, various scholars have carried out studies highlighting how different manifestations of Mexican cultural production operated within the nationalist project of indigenismo-mestizaje by featuring visual constructs of Indigeneity.127\n\nIndeed, visual representation was a central concern for the architects of the new postrevolutionary nationalist campaign. One of the foremost figures of this impulse, the anthropologist Manuel Gamio, specifically addressed the country’s culturally stratified patterns of artistic production and consumption as a symptom of the nation’s lack of cohesion. In his 1916 treatise, Forjando patria, Gamio advocates for a fusion in the artistic preferences of Mexicans: “Cuando la clase media y la indígena tengan el mismo criterio en material de arte, estaremos culturalmente redimidos, existirá el arte nacional, que es una de las grandes bases del nacionalismo” (When the middle class and the indigenous class have the same criteria regarding art, we shall be culturally redeemed, national art will exist, which is one of the great bases of nationalism).128 In concert with this vision, Vasconcelos famously commissioned artists to create works that would portray the Mexican people and aimed to provide the country with an aesthetic that it could call authentically national.129\n\nThe results of these efforts were the now well-known murals painted by figures such as Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. Although he did not adhere strictly to Vasconcelos’s views,130 Rivera explicitly engaged the theme of Indigeneity in paintings such as The Great City of Tenochtitlan (1945) located in the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City, which “depicts an idealized view of the Aztec capital.”131 In other works such as The World of Today and Tomorrow (1929–1935) (also located in the Palacio Nacional), he envisions the nation’s central subjects as the peasant, the soldier, and the worker, and conceives of them as the evolved descendants of Mexico’s Indigenous people. While such works prominently displayed Indigeneity and mestizos of color, it is important to keep in mind that indigenista cultural production (and indigenismo itself) was as preoccupied with modernity as it was with Indigeneity. As Adèle Robin Greeley points out, a major motive for the creation of the murals in the first place was the desire of President Alvaro Obregón (in office from 1920 to 1924) to mitigate the image of Mexico as an uncivilized country, especially following the violence of the armed phase of the Revolution.132\n\nInterrogating indigenista visual production in Mexico during the mid-twentieth century allows us to address the tension between the official indigenismo-mestizaje ideology and the continued valuing of Whiteness that was both colonially inflected and ever evolving in response to subsequent regimes of modernity. Although starting from the early 1920s there was a highly visible promotion of Indigenous themes in the realm of Mexican cultural production, what I wish to point out is that in light of a history of racialized Othering, having the Indigenous and peasant populations suddenly become the privileged objects of aesthetic expression was not an unproblematic proposal. Figure I.1 is a cartoon that appeared in Excélsior, a conservative newspaper directed toward a middle- and upper-class readership,133 on August 31, 1927. The cartoon is titled “Buen juez” (Good judge), and it shows an Indigenous woman who has brought her son to a beauty pageant for children as she is met with the confusion of one of the pageant’s judges.134 “Ma’am, how dare you bring such an ugly little boy?” the judge asks the woman. When she responds that “Don Diego” is one of the judges for the pageant, the judge remains confused and asks what Diego Rivera’s participation in the pageant has to do with anything. To this the woman responds, “Well, the boy looks just like the ones he painted in the Secretariat of Public Education.” The cartoon suggests that just because Diego Rivera is painting Indigenous people in state-sanctioned murals in public buildings for all to see, this does not necessarily mean that they are aesthetically venerable according to Mexican public opinion.135 It hints at the idea that pictorial indigenismo had yet to interpellate lighter-skinned elites, but at the same time allows the reader/viewer interpretative latitude. Most importantly, the cartoon points to the fact that there was contention about whether or not Indigenous people were fit for celebratory artistic representation and debate about how they should be rendered.\n\nAnxiety surrounding the visualization of Indigeneity is also evident in relation to other mediums and practices that sought to showcase lo mexicano—understood as a hegemonic criollo/mestizo take on Indigeneity and rural Mexico.136 In the 1920s and 1930s, Mexican intellectuals and business entrepreneurs helped the Mexican government develop its own version of a national exoticism that was shaped by Euro-American visions of Mexico and by national discourses that were central to postrevolutionary national identity,137 This internal form of Orientalism138 idealized and re-created rural Mexico, placing a specific emphasis on images of women because “it equated the exotic with the feminine.”139\n\nAs a result, images of what Joanne Hershfield has called the “domestic exotic” and what Ageeth Sluis has termed the “camposcape” appeared in multiple mediums including high art, advertisements of various kinds, and postcards.140 Within this new national aesthetic, la india bonita featured as a motif.141 For Sluis, the dressing up of “deco bodies” (characterized by their slender shapes and fashionable late-1930s makeup with very thin eyebrows, full lashes, and a light complexion) in Indigenous garb across visual mediums was a way for the cultural industry to simultaneously convey modernity and authenticity.142 Natasha Varner has used the term india bonita to draw connections among multiple forms of visual culture including beauty pageants, tourism posters, film, and photography to point to how postrevolutionary cultural elites reconstructed images of the female Indigenous body in a manner that was in fact “a project of erasure.”143 As David S. Dalton has illustrated, another cultural strategy for manifesting embodied Mexican specificity and modernity in the postrevolutionary period was to represent Indigenous bodies fused with technologies to convey their transformation into modern mestizos.144\n\nRead together, these scholars analyze two embodied proposals for visualizing Mexican modernity, which are inversions of each other. The first uses the White Mexican body to signify modernity and folkloric accessories to denote mexicanidad; in the second, the Indigenous body is used to evoke Mexicanness, while technology conveys modernity. In this book, I maintain that the two proposals will not function as true equivalents in the Mexican cultural landscape because of one crucial factor: the aesthetic, romantic, and sexual desirability that will remain tied to Whiteness because of the nation’s discriminatory racial history and the multifaceted legacy of coloniality. I suggest that while the association with technologies may have served to transform Indigenous bodies into modern mestizo ones, this juxtaposition was not enough to supplant (or even approach) the White Mexican body’s status as the pinnacle of aesthetic value in society (especially for women), which in turn had a determinant effect on the representation of beauty and desirability as White in the modern visual medium of Mexican cinema.\n\nThe inability of the Mexican person of color to be upheld as simultaneously modern and desirable can be gleaned from the existing work of several scholars. Hershfield’s analysis of illustrated magazines of the time featuring la india bonita provides insight into the racial politics at work in the appropriation of Indigenous culture: “la india’s skin color was not something to be emulated, [but] her colorful, non-Western dress habits were a fashion rage among various sectors of elite society.”145 Furthermore, Laura Isabel Serna’s analysis of how Mexican women of color who attempted the flapper hairstyle and other modern fashion trends were openly ridiculed in local print culture points to a tension with respect to beauty, modernity, and race.146 Quoting a 1924 article by journalist Carlos Serrano in Revista de revistas, Serna notes,\n\nMiddle-class observers clucked “in many of the dark faces that carry the imperturbable stamp of the race,” the [flapper] style ends up being “unsympathetic and ridiculous.” In designating modern styles as the province of those with fair skin, these sorts of comments reinforced Mexico’s racial hierarchy …147\n\nSerna’s observation points to how the Mexican woman of color was held to be incompatible with a modernity that was also aesthetically desirable, making her participation in modern fashions appear absurd to the middle and upper class in Mexican society. The women’s lack of blancura apparently disqualified them from taking on modern trends tied to blanquitud.\n\nBecause of the racialized dynamics of aesthetic value and desire, it is the specific combination of a White epidermal schema and stylized Indigenous garb that “wins” as a hegemonic national visual symbol (ubiquitous in twentieth-century cinema, calendar art, and advertisements). These representations have greater currency because the impermanence of the local embellishments and the more permanent Whiteness of the body anchor Mexico’s claim to modernity in a manner that reinforces the long-standing colonized valuing of Whiteness as universally desirable in the Mexican racial formation.\n\nIndeed, White Mexican bodies have had the luxury of adorning themselves with folkloric paraphernalia because these impermanent additions to the body do not threaten the White body’s social privilege, which is safely secured by more permanent physical markers of Whiteness—a dynamic that Dyer has referred to as “white people’s right to be various.”148 In this sense, I distance myself from Varner’s analysis of a broad range of visual mediums that include dark-skinned Indigenous women as examples of indias bonitas because my focus suggests the nonequivalency of these examples.149\n\nBut to which iteration of modernity does this White Mexican body masqueraded as Indigenous correspond? When tasked with representing an Indigeneity that is both modern and desirable, twentieth-century cultural producers resort to using the visage of the first project of Western modernity introduced in what is now Mexico: an Iberian physical schema. By this point, Iberianness was sufficiently inscribed in local society and displaced from a global hegemonic position (having become the decayed alter ego of Anglo-US imperialism)150 so as to be associated with Mexican tradition vis-à-vis looks disseminated from western Europe and the United States. At the same time, a physical appearance that connoted Iberianness was still “superior” to the Indigenous physical schemata within a Eurocentric worldview. For this reason, the Iberian physical schemata—the darkest variant of Mexican Whiteness—became the canvas of choice onto which the signifiers of Indigeneity could be layered through folkloric embellishment. This visual code will define whiteness-as-indigeneity in cinema throughout the twentieth century with many White Mexican actresses transforming themselves physically into Indigenous characters simply by wearing long dark braids.\n\nFilmic representations of Indigeneity in Mexico were also produced in the midst of a complex racial climate in which some aspects of Indigeneity were officially praised while others were unofficially disparaged. Such films often fulfilled an internally colonial function, reifying a criollo/mestizo subject position by making Indigenous Mexicans the “objects of spectacle.”151 Additionally, Indigenous-themed films were charged with other meanings and missions because of the significance of cinema as a medium that was uniquely associated with modernity.152 Although government officials attempted to use muralism as an assertion of Mexico’s modernity by marrying avant-garde aesthetics with local themes, and despite Vasconcelos’s belief that it was impossible to develop film as a national form,153 cinema eventually did become the most important channel through which the country would assert its aspirational status as a modern nation-state throughout the twentieth century. International recognition of Mexican films was one way in which the nation sought to proclaim its arrival as a sophisticated peer among North American and Western European countries. Through their participation in the modern art form of cinema, Mexican filmmakers sought to be recognized in international contexts as producers of films that were both exemplars of artistic quality and identifiably Mexican.154 Mexican films about Indigeneity are therefore rich spaces in which the search for Mexican singularity and external recognition, the racialized associations between Indigeneity and backwardness (both at home and abroad), and the national aspiration to be modern are carefully negotiated.\n\nMexican films about Indigeneity have been addressed by scholars in a variety of ways. Overwhelmingly, the literature on the subject is dominated by analyses of Emilio “El Indio” Fernández’s indigenista films from the 1940s and those films that are considered to be precursors to his work.155 This genealogy features Sergei Eisenstein’s unfinished ¡Qué viva México! (1932), Carlos Navarro’s Janitzio (1935), Fred Zinnerman’s Redes (1936),156 and on occasion the early silent films De raza azteca (1921), Guillermo Calles’s El indio yaqui (1926), and Raza de bronce (1927).157 Scholarship has tended to address these films because Fernández’s work is often considered to be most emblematic of the postrevolutionary government’s aims for incorporating Indigenous people into the national community while exalting them on a symbolic and aesthetic level.158 When films that represent Indigenous people have been discussed outside the postrevolutionary indigenista narrative, they are often mentioned in isolation and studied within the development of the Mexican film industry;159 thus they are not analyzed in ways that foreground the significance of their specific contents. Furthermore, much of the film studies tradition within the Mexican academy has tended to privilege historical and sociological approaches160 rather than engagement with textual readings that allow us to interpret how these Indigenous-themed films produce meaning.\n\nMany early films prior to the Golden Age have not been studied in detail because of their obscurity and lack of commercial success. Furthermore, Indigenous-themed films made toward the end of the Golden Age and after have largely been ignored or underanalyzed, in part because they are perceived to be plagued with the same general lack of quality and artistic merit that scholars attribute to Mexican films from the late 1950s through the late 1970s.161\n\nFurthermore, scholarship on Mexican cinema in general traditionally has tended to privilege state policies and discourse as determining factors for the interpretation of films.162 This emphasis is logical because the Mexican government played a significant role in the Mexican film industry beginning with the promotion of “quality cinema with a marked social content” during Lázaro Cardenas’s government (1934–1940).163 In 1942, the Banco Cinemátográfico (which later became the Banco Nacional Cinematográfico in 1947) “was funded primarily by the state to protect, promote and remodel” film production in the country.164 The government also impacted distribution through the formation of Películas Mexicanas S.A. in 1945 to handle distribution abroad and the creation of the mixed capital distributor, Películas Nacionales S.A., to carry out domestic distribution. Finally, in 1949 the Ley de Industria Cinematográfica was passed, proposing government financing for films of national interest, stricter censorship, and requiring governmental authorization for Mexican films screened abroad.165 In light of the government’s involvement in the film industry, official discourses about Indigenous communities at the moment films were produced are a pertinent factor that may have informed filmmaking decisions. For instance, we know that Emilio Fernández had to make modifications to Río Escondido (1948) after censors found the film to be “antirevolucionaria,” or not in keeping with the ideals of the Revolution.166\n\nHowever, while clearing censorship requirements was an important consideration,167 film production of the Golden Age was also a function of other concerns, such as the market, the search for international recognition and prestige, and individual filmmakers’ creative visions. Furthermore, as Andrew Paxman has argued, there is reason to believe that the state’s role in Mexican film production and culture was less pronounced than has previously been argued because many of the state’s measures regarding the industry had greater symbolic significance than real impact. Paxman observes, for instance, that when the Film Bank was created in 1942, it “was a largely private-sector bank, capitalized at 2.5 million pesos, the state committing a mere 10 percent.”168Also, film quotas were passed but not necessarily enforced, and as a result, even during Mexican cinema’s much celebrated Golden Age, the majority of the films exhibited were foreign, while few domestic productions were ever profitable.169 In light of the priorities of industrialization, modernization, and the laissez-faire media policy in presidential terms (sexenios) after Cardenas, Paxman asserts that “the content of film and TV programming (newsreels and newscasts aside) was less important to the state than the proliferation of movie theatres and radios or TV sets.”170\n\nWith regard to films about Indigenous people, the tendency to center the state has resulted in a lot of attention toward films that evidence ideological affinity with official state discourses of a particular period. For instance, Redes and Janitzio are frequently identified as examples of Cardenas’s progressive social agenda that supported worker’s rights and agrarian reform,171 while Fernández’s indigenista films are consistently read as examples of belated cardenismo.172 However, there were other Indigenous-themed films produced during the Cárdenas presidency, such as Tribu (dir. Contreras Torres, 1935), La india bonita (dir. Helú, 1938), and La Zandunga (dir. de Fuentes, 1938), yet, because they have nothing to do with the official rhetoric of the period, they are largely understudied. As Paula Félix-Didier and Andrés Levinson have perceptively observed, “problems arise when attempts are made to establish close or direct ties between a political moment in the country’s history and cultural production—as if it were possible to establish from a political perspective a cultural hegemony free of all contradictions.”173\n\nThe tendency to center the state has yielded excellent scholarship and has, without a doubt, illuminated myriad aspects of filmic production in Mexico. However, when interrogating a pervasive and consistent racist code of cinematic representation, attempting to tie each film to a specific discourse during a sexenio (the six-year presidential term in Mexico) impedes an understanding of evident continuities, which the endurance of whiteness-as-indigeneity as a device exemplifies. Furthermore, a sexenio-centered approach also means that while connections between some Indigenous-themed films have been consistently identified by scholars (such as the affinity between Emilio Fernández’s indigenista films of the 1940s and Carlos Navarro’s 1935 film Janitzio, in which Fernández acted), many others have never been explored. For instance, Emilio Fernández also played an Indigenous man in Miguel Contreras Torres’s 1935 colonial-era drama, Tribu, a film that has very little ideological or aesthetic overlap with Janitzio, yet was released in the same year. The sexenio framework offers no meaningful way of reading these films together. The same is true for other aesthetically and ideologically dissimilar films about Indigeneity produced in temporal proximity in later decades, such as Raíces (dir. Alazraki, 1955) and Chilam Balam (dir. de Martino, 1957).\n\nInstead of departing from the assumption that each film studied here must be somehow defined by the officialist rhetoric of the specific sexenio in which it was produced, this book’s point of departure is that residual and emergent attitudes about race coexist in complex ways throughout the twentieth century, as is glaringly indicated by the very existence of whiteness-as-indigeneity throughout the period of cultural nationalism that championed indigenismo. Through a broad view of Indigenous-themed films, it becomes clear that ideologically divergent films about Indigenous people were produced in very close succession. Nearly all of these resorted to whiteness-as-indigeneity to convey those divergent messages. By privileging the films’ aesthetic similarities while also identifying their discursive differences and the recurrence of those discourses, my hope is that this study can help provide a broader understanding of how cinema in Mexico has mediated a variety of conceptions about Indigeneity and the nation throughout the twentieth century.\n\nWithin these Indigenous-themed Mexican films, more often than not, women occupy the prominent roles, a fact that continues a long-standing local tendency to portray Indigeneity through the feminine.174 Another reason for the prominence of female characters has to do with the parameters of the melodramatic mode, which was pervasive in postrevolutionary Mexican film production because “it responded to political and moral chaos by offering up ‘truth’ in the clearest and most melodious terms.”175 In melodrama, virtuous women are often protagonists because they have historically served as privileged vehicles for transmitting victimhood and emotionalism.176 If, as Silvia Oroz has observed, one of the characteristics of Latin American melodrama is “[a] construção de uma imagem cinematografica nacional, que remete a um universo próximo do espectador” ([t]he construction of a national cinematic image, that references a universe close to the spectator),177 one can see how Indigenous female lead roles in Mexican cinema were ideal vessels for melodrama in the local context. However, while on postcards intended for tourists Indigenous women could appear in rich epidermal shades,178 their visualization in twentieth-century Mexican cinema is overwhelmingly White. In other words, in mainstream Mexican films, it is women whose epidermal schemas locate them as White in the local racial formation—understood in its multifaceted physical and cultural definition outlined above—who are cast in leading roles, even in Indigenous-themed films.\n\nThe obvious fact that this phenomenon is a breach of indexicality—often a point of contention within many discussions about race and representation in cinema—is not this book’s primary focus. Robert Stam and Louise Spence have correctly observed that in scholarship about race and cinema, “the emphasis on realism has often betrayed an exaggerated faith in the possibilities of verisimilitude in art in general and the cinema in particular, avoiding the fact that films are inevitably constructs, fabrications, representations.”179 Richard Dyer echoes this position when he reminds us that cinema, like all other forms of representation, “never ‘gets’ reality.”180 While certainly noting the inconsistencies between characters’ diegetic identities and those (more socially privileged ones) of the actors who play them, the primary purpose of this book is not merely to point out that the actors playing Indigenous people in Mexican cinema are not themselves Indigenous people. Rather, this book interrogates the existence of a pervasive racialized visual logic in Mexico that makes this Whitening approach to visualizing Indigeneity—and society in general—the rule in the local context. The method used here to interrogate this phenomenon—a constant across the periodizations of Mexican cinema usually used to explain stylistic changes181—is to critically engage the multiple discursive functions of Whiteness in the cinematic representation of Indigeneity in Mexico.\n\nCommentary on this phenomenon has tended to consist of critiques of Emilio “El Indio” Fernández’s indigenista films, most of which point to their breach of indexicality as a means of transmitting mestizo hybridity and/or an attempt to produce cosmopolitan appeal.182 Within the discussion of this director’s work, Dolores Tierney has expertly demonstrated how the use of Whiteness for the main characters in María Candelaria is a crucial device informed by the colonial hierarchy through which the film “reconciles indigenismo with the project of modernity in order to offer an idealized visualization of the indígena’s place within the modernizing Mexican nation.”183 Expanding on Tierney’s excellent work, and in conversation with other scholars who engage mid-twentieth-century Mexican racial masquerade in cultural production such as Hershfield, Sluis, Dalton, and Varner, I situate the corpus of films analyzed in The White Indians of Mexican Cinema within a racist visual tradition and argue that it can be understood through the coloniality of power and as the result of the colonization of both desire and subjectivity.\n\nWhiteness-as-indigeneity takes as its canvas the imagined Iberian phenotype—the visage of the first project of Western modernity imposed in Mexico184—which by the twentieth century was so thoroughly inscribed into the local cultural landscape and displaced from a position of global hegemony as to take on the symbolism of local tradition, particularly in comparison with more contemporary ideals of feminine beauty created and disseminated by Hollywood and European cinema.185 Whiteness-as-indigeneity is a phenomenon that not only is characteristic of Emilio Fernández’s cinematic indígenismo, but also can be identified in (extant) films as early as 1931 and beyond the Golden Age.186 This book treats whiteness-as-indigeneity as the crystallization of an uneasy process of ideological accommodation that takes on nuanced and varied stances in specific films spanning decades. Whiteness-as-indigeneity is an enduring and idiosyncratic form of on-screen racial masquerade, a racialized visual pact with the Mexican spectator based on shared colonized codes of beauty and subjectivity that were also applied to male representation. Although many aspects of the films analyzed here reflect the changes that scholars attribute to the shifts throughout the stages of Mexican film production, whiteness-as-indigeneity is an enduring device, a constant across periods. It is the endurance of the trope that is of primary interest in this study.\n\nIn addition to using critical race theory and decolonial thought to elucidate the racialized implications of whiteness-as-indigeneity in Mexican film, this book also aims to broaden what is understood as indigenista cinema to include films beyond those aligned with the political aims of indigenismo-mestizaje in a specific moment, administration, or policy. In a more general vein, inspired by Mexican philosopher Luis Villoro’s definition of indigenismo as “the group of theoretical concepts and of processes of consciousness that, throughout the ages, have manifested indigeneity,”187 I take indigenista films to be those that imagine and/or set out to convey Indigeneity from non-native perspectives and, in so doing, speak to the definition of the imagined criollo/mestizo national self. Through this perspective, I analyze a variety of films from different moments in the development of the Mexican film industry that explicitly, either diegetically or extradiegetically, convey the intention of representing Indigeneity.188 In broadening the temporal, aesthetic, and ideological scope of the films we might consider indigenista, I aim to show the variety of indigenista proposals (indigenismos) regarding the place of Indigeneity in the modern Mexican national identity that can be gleaned from Indigenous-themed cinematic production throughout the Golden Age. Following Dolores Tierney and Susan Dever, who have argued that Mexican films from the Golden Age were “a porous amalgamation of ideas”189 conveying “a range of contradictory ideologies,”190 I suggest that this corpus of Indigenous-themed films transmit vying, if not conflicting, ideas about the place of Indigeneity in the nation. In exposing this plurality of positions, I aim to show how Mexican cinematic production registers a lack of consensus about what the place of Indigeneity should be in the modern national identity, which in turn suggests the instability of the supposedly hegemonic indigenismo-mestizaje project.191\n\nContextualizing Race and Gender On-screen\n\nTheoretical debates about gender, race, and cinema inform this volume’s approach to the filmic representation of Indigeneity, which insists on the centrality of local race relations and understandings. Laura Mulvey has famously argued that Hollywood cinema has produced representations of women that are products of the male gaze, through which the spectator (envisioned as male) is incited to “possess” the woman on-screen, therefore imposing subjective male positionality onto the spectator.192 While Mulvey’s approach is certainly pertinent to the ways in which Indigenous women in Mexican films from the first half of the twentieth century are presented as objects of desire, it is also true that, as bell hooks and Jane Gaines have noted, traditional feminist film theory is not helpful for understanding the racial dynamics at work in cinema.193 In her approach to these connections, bell hooks has encouraged film scholars to consider the local realities in which films are produced and consumed. Through this emphasis, she has noted that the gaze of US Blacks toward cinema cannot be divorced from US racial history in which the Black gaze could be considered an act of defiance or sexual aggression.194 By highlighting contextual racial dynamics, hooks observes that the Black male gazers of White womanhood on-screen not only engaged in an act of possession (as Mulvey suggests), but that as spectators they were situated in a subject position that was violently denied to them in lived experience. In this way, hooks’s work illustrates that films can have dramatically different implications depending on the racial contexts in which they are consumed and provides a point of entry to explore the gendered and racialized nature of cinema spectatorship in postcolonial contexts.\n\nAmong film theorists who have addressed the relationship between race and cinema, Richard Dyer has approached the issue of Whiteness specifically. He posits that Whiteness acquires its power because it attributes to itself a universal quality, an ability to represent anything because Whiteness claims not to be a particularizing quality.195 Although Mexican film has used Whiteness in a similar way,196 I suspect that in the case of Hollywood, the use of Whiteness to represent anything and everything is strongly rooted in the demographic reality and national narrative of the United States, particularly in the era of so-called classical cinema. Mexico, on the other hand, has always been a minority-majority country,197 in which Whiteness has always been a particularizing quality because it has been tied to socioeconomic privilege and because it has historically included only a small minority of the population. In the Mexican (post)colonial context, it is both the rarity of Whiteness and its privilege—not its pervasiveness—that “generated a dominant image of the white man as spectacle.”198\n\nThough the image of White homogeneity in Mexican society has always contrasted starkly with the country’s demography, as Charles Ramírez Berg and Dolores Tierney have noted, Whites have succeeded in fashioning themselves as the universal image of Mexico in film and media, which their political and economic dominance has made possible.199 The pervasiveness of this blatant distortion even in the majority-minority scenario of Mexico makes film and media’s privileging of Whiteness the product of a unique ideological force: the coloniality of power and, more specifically, the colonization of desire and subjectivity. It manifests itself clearly in the ubiquity and veneration of White Mexican actors on-screen and off. Mexican films that state their intention to represent Indigeneity, yet still employ Whiteness to do so, are this system’s limit case—a testament to the extent to which desire and subjectivity have been colonized, so much so that the indexically unfeasible (White Mexican women presented as Indigenous women) is preferable to the presentation of “Indigenous-looking” femininity (and masculinity) as desirable. By qualifying the meanings of cinematic Whiteness in the Mexican context, this volume also seeks to contribute to Anglo-American theorizations of race and cinema.\n\nColonizing Desire\n\nOne of the many aspects of the colonial experience that theorists have addressed is the impact of coloniality on the cross-racial dynamics of desire. In his well-known 1952 text, Black Skin, White Masks, Frantz Fanon suggests that the prohibition of sexual relations and marriage between Black men and White women during the colonial period in the Antilles causes Black men to experience desire toward the White woman because an intimate relationship with the White woman symbolizes both redress for the colonial subjugation and acceptance within White society.200 Assuming the voice of a collective Black Antillean male subjectivity, he writes:\n\nI wish to be acknowledged not as black but as white … who but a white woman can do this for me? By loving me she proves that I am worthy of white love. I am loved like a white man … I marry white culture, white beauty, white whiteness. When my restless hands caress those white breasts, they grasp white civilization and dignity and make them mine.201\n\nWhen discussing the Black Antillean woman’s desire to couple with a White man, Fanon suggests that the inclination is rooted in a wish to Whiten, and therefore improve, the prospects for future children. He also suggests that marrying a White man is a way to definitively disassociate oneself from Blackness and approach a more consolidated and convincing White identity.202 In a similar vein, Albert Memmi’s The Colonizer and the Colonized highlights the desire to marry the colonizer as an extension of the colonized’s strategy to become like his oppressor by adopting everything from the colonizer’s world as superior.203 Both Fanon and Memmi reveal that in colonial contexts, sexual attraction and desire are far from arbitrary occurrences and can be understood as racialized phenomena. Of course, I do not mean that the colonized are never considered to be sexually desirable, but that the overwhelming tendency to exalt Whiteness as desirable in these contexts has a basis in colonial subjugation. Furthermore, as Fanon and Memmi argue, the way in which colonialism upholds the colonizer’s body as more desirable contributes to a process of self-loathing in the colonized, and this fact is evidenced in various attempts at physical Whitening alongside the broader processes of socioeconomic and cultural Whitening.204\n\nWhile the history of interracial marriage in Mexico has its own historical specificities, the experience of colonialism produced similar results to those described by Fanon and Memmi. Early during the conquest, the marriage of Spanish men and Indigenous women was looked upon favorably because of the lack of Spanish women in the Americas and because these unions were considered vehicles for conversion to Catholicism by the Spanish Crown.205 Indeed, intermarriage was a part of Hernán Cortés’s initial strategy for supporting the conquest of New Spain.206 The freedom to marry Indigenous women was made explicit in laws passed in 1501 and 1514.207 However, as soon as Spanish women became available in New Spain, Spanish men rejected Indigenous women as marriage partners.208 Subsequent laws continued to protect Spanish unions with Indians and with those of mixed Indigenous and Spanish ancestry (mestizos and castizos)209 while discouraging unions between Spaniards and people of African ancestry.210 However, the mere fact of legal protection does not mean that unions between Spaniards and Indigenous people were common or socially encouraged. Magnus Mörner has illustrated the distinction between the legal statuses and social statuses of different groups in New Spain.211 He has shown that although Indigenous people had the highest legal status of those who were neither Spanish nor criollo, they had the lowest social status,212 which was in turn tied to the racialized division of labor according to which they performed primarily physical tasks. Thus, despite the protected legal status of Indigenous people and the fact that their marriages with Spaniards and criollos were legal, they were less common because of the great socioeconomic distance that evolved between the groups.213 Though their selection of marital partners changed, White men maintained “privileged access to non-white women’s sexuality” while at the same time obstructing non-Whites’ access to White women’s sexuality.214\n\nAccording to Douglas Cope, the significance of marriage for securing wealth and status made unions with non-Whites undesirable for Spanish and criollo families in New Spain, and phenotype served as a “sieve, filtering out unsuitable candidates for admission to Spanish families.”215 This relationship between phenotype and status can be corroborated by Alexander von Humboldt’s observation of the social distinction that Whiteness (blancura) conferred in the Mexican context. During his trip to the country at the turn of the nineteenth century, he noted, “In Spain, it is a kind of title of nobility not to descend from Jews or Moors. In America, the skin, more or less white, is what dictates the class that an individual occupies in society. A white, even if he rides barefoot on horseback, considers himself a member of the nobility of the country.”216 Clearly, physical appearance mattered as a factor that informed one’s social status and marriage prospects. In fact, as historian Federico Navarrete Linares points out, criollo families in Mexico were at times so desperate to Whiten their “tainted” lineages or preserve them that they were regularly willing to intermarry with White Spaniards even if they were of low socioeconomic status.217\n\nAfter independence, as we have seen, acculturation and wealth (blanquitud) enabled individuals to shift their ethnoracial identities to White ones, giving way to greater mixture. However, the practice of Whitening continued, both through a preference for physically and genealogically Whiter marriage partners, especially among the elite, and through physical and cultural attempts to Whiten the self.218 The historical practice of elite, White endogamy in Mexico and the negative characteristics attributed to Indigeneity over time have helped make Whiteness the aesthetic ideal in the country as well as an object of sexual and romantic desire. With this I do not mean that non-White bodies are never considered desirable by anyone in Mexico, but that, according to the dominant racial ideology, Whiteness (blancura, especially when paired with blanquitud) is constructed as aesthetically superior and more desirable, especially in the context of long-term and socially visible coupling.219\n\nThis racialized desire for White bodies has been documented throughout the history of Mexican cultural production. Referring to the country’s literary texts, José Vasconcelos noted that “You find almost in every one of our Indian or mestizo poets, dark of skin themselves, the ardent eulogy of the white hands, the pale cheek, of the amada.”220 Even in Ignacio Altamirano’s foundational national novel El Zarco, which earnestly proposes the dark-skinned Indian, Nicolás as the ideal of manly virtue, Nicolás cannot match the blue-eyed bandit’s handsome appearance, and the novel opts instead to establish Nicolas’s moral superiority with his “beautiful soul.”221 Mexican cinema, television programs, and advertisements reinforce the supposed aesthetic superiority and desirability of Whites to this day.222 Although I do not exclude that Mexican films have also sought to imitate the conventions of Whiteness in European and American films, what I wish to point out is that because beautiful bodies and faces are almost always requirements for film stars (especially for women),223 Whiteness in Mexican film production has also been predominant because of the local process of the colonization of desire, which dictates that beauty is White according to a very specific set local bodily standards within the context of the local racial formation.224\n\nFurthermore, this book seeks to elucidate how the Mexican cinematic experience is predicated on racialized and classed “looking relations.”225 For this reason, films have exploited the opportunity to offer the majority–non-White, nonelite audience the indulgence226 of gazing upon and desiring White bodies in a manner that likely would not be possible for them in lived reality without facing some form of social sanction because, as Mónica Moreno Figueroa notes, “seeing is a racialized, gendered, and classed cultural practice …”227 In addition to allowing people to gaze at racially privileged bodies, cinema spectatorship amplifies the scopophilic dimension of this experience because, as Christine Gledhill reminds us, “[p]hotography and especially the close-up, offers audiences a gaze at the bodies of stars closer and more sustained than the majority of real life encounters.”228 In other words, Mexican cinema has capitalized on the effects of the colonization of desire and subjectivity, which include, for those who consciously or unconsciously still subscribe to those values, non-White Mexicans’ desire to be White, White Mexicans’ will to affirm themselves as desirable and beautiful, and both groups’ desire toward White bodies as aesthetically, sexually, and romantically preferable.\n\nColonizing Subjectivity\n\nOf course, there are other aspects of the discursive and epistemic violence of coloniality that have helped to produce the centrality of Whiteness in cultural production. Fanon also describes how the colonized subject’s exposure to racialized discourses in comic books and history books impacts him, effectively alienating him from himself through a kind of discursive brainwashing229—the colonization of his subjectivity. He identifies with the White protagonist, the victor, and becomes complicit in the Othering of pejoratively racialized subjects. He therefore associates the Senegalese with the “wicked Negroes” of his texts and attributes to himself a White subjectivity, disavowing his own African ancestry.230 Fanon’s identification of how the colonized are coerced to identify with Whiteness not only is a characteristic of the Antilles, but also is constitutive of the coloniality of power across colonies.231\n\nIn the Mexican context, the colonial experience similarly created a cultural symbolic order (through, for example, historical and religious narrative) that privileged Whiteness as a preferred signifier of privileged social identity. This cultural symbolic order was not entirely replaced or eliminated through independence, revolution, or the Revolution’s institutionalized cultural projects. Instead, these movements merely qualified the terms of White superiority through subsequent discourses of modernity. Although José Jorge Gómez Izquierdo does not refer to Fanon, his own study of how Mexican history books teach about Indigenous cultures brings him to a similar conclusion: their discourses serve the purposes of White supremacy in Mexico, aligning the pupil with the non-Indigenous subject, which results in psychological and emotional damage.232\n\nThis value and protagonism ceded to Whiteness is further evidenced in the generalized indifference toward the suffering and death of non-White Mexicans. As Mexican anthropologist Roger Bartra explains while debunking the notion that indifference toward death is an inherent characteristic of rural and Indigenous Mexican culture, “this fatalism has another origin, … the disdain of the dominant classes for the lives of those who find themselves in conditions of misery. There are people whose lives are not worth much in the eyes of their masters: the death of a Mexican Indian … occurs in the bosom of the undifferentiated ‘masses’; such deaths can reach monstrous statistical proportions but do not threaten the civilized man.”233\n\nEchoing the theme of indifference, Navarrete Linares perceptively illustrates how the association between Indigeneity and poverty in Mexico has been thoroughly naturalized, producing generalized attitudes of detachment toward racialized socioeconomic marginality.234 He explains how when a Facebook user in 2012 spotted a blond, light-skinned girl named Alondra begging for money on the streets of Guadalajara, a social media storm ensued. Insinuations that the girl must have been kidnapped prompted local authorities to temporarily remove the girl from the custody of her parents, who, after providing a legitimate birth certificate, were still required to provide DNA evidence to prove that Alondra was, in fact, their daughter. This wave of indignation over the socioeconomic marginality of one blond, light-skinned child—forceful enough to incite legal intervention—contrasts starkly with the generalized silence and indifference regarding the poverty in which numerous Indigenous and mestizo Mexican children live.\n\nLuis Estrada’s mordant satirical film, La dictadura perfecta (2014), masterfully re-creates the racialized dynamics at work throughout the case of Alondra, as explained by Navarrete Linares. In Estrada’s film, a corrupt governor, Carmelo Vargas, and the most prominent Mexican television company, TVMX, collude to make the kidnapping of light-skinned, middle-class twin sisters national news to distract from the governor’s rampant corruption. The film’s display of how the Mexican media frame the girls’ kidnapping as a tragedy while refusing to show the scores of dead bodies that emerge during their partnership with Vargas points to the racialized attitudes toward suffering and death in Mexico according to which the plight of middle-class White people is the stuff of tragedy and that of poorer Indigenous or mestizo Mexicans is unremarkable or ignored altogether.235 For Elena Poniatowska, this racialized appraisal of human life is apparent in the Mexican state’s mishandling of the “disappearance” of forty-three teacher trainees from the state of Guerrero in 2014.236 In short, in Mexico Whiteness functions as perhaps the most important “frame” that determines “grievability.”237\n\nIn light of this racial history and the persistence of highly racialized social attitudes, I suggest that Whiteness (blancura) is also dominant in Mexican cultural production (and in Mexican cinema specifically) because in the context of colonized subjectivity, physical Whiteness functions as a device for inciting identification between the spectator and the main characters in the diegeses (story worlds).238 Charles Ramírez Berg has already alluded to some of the consequences of this phenomenon by observing that in twentieth-century Mexican film, Whiteness functions as a “marker of morality and social standing … light skin confers righteousness and high social station; dark skin usually signifies a lower-class villain or clown.”239 Leading roles, the primary point of identification for audiences in narrative cinema, are therefore almost exclusively played by actors who can conform to the physical boundaries of Mexican Whiteness. Blancura functions as a kind of passport for aspiring media figures, because according to the logic of the colonization of subjectivity, physical Whiteness qualifies them as deserving of centrality and attention. In this way, several stars in Mexico and throughout the Americas who originally lacked substantive blanquitud were able to capitalize on and enhance their blancura while presenting their lower-class affinity as charm or relatability, allowing them to rise to prominence in still-racist societies. Figures who have benefited by playing this “Whiteness game” include Pedro Infante in Mexico,240 Eva Perón in Argentina, Carmen Miranda in Brazil,241 and Marilyn Monroe in the United States.\n\nIt is through the colonization of desire and subjectivity that we arrive at the situation in Mexico in which the national audiovisual repertoire has painted an overwhelmingly (and unrealistically) White picture of Mexico. Although the dynamics are different with respect to the US context, the ubiquity of Whiteness on-screen has also been a tool of White supremacy in Mexico.242 Indeed, it is one of the most powerful manifestations of what Guillermo Bonfil Batalla has termed “el México imaginario” (the imaginary Mexico), which he defines as “a minority country organized according to norms, aspirations, and intentions of Western civilization that are not shared (or are from another perspective) by the rest of the national population … that sector that incarnates and impels the dominant project in our country.”243\n\nClearly (to apply one of bell hooks’s observations), Mexico is not as White as it wants to be.244 And so we return to the bewildered European or US American spectator who upon encountering Mexican films and telenovelas for the first time cannot help but ask, “Why is everyone so White?” I have often heard many Mexicans react indignantly to this kind of question, and I have done so myself. “We have White people too,” the response goes, beneath which one can read, “we have beauty, civilization, and modernity too.” But like children and drunks who unwittingly reveal uncomfortable truths,245 those who ask the ingenuous (and sometimes prejudiced) question reveal the fantasy for what it is: an aspirational and unconvincing mask.\n\nWhiteness, Melodrama, and Hegemony\n\nSpeaking specifically about the Golden Age of Mexican cinema (lasting from about 1936 to 1957), both Jesús Martín-Barbero and Carlos Monsiváis have posited that film production from the period fulfilled a hegemonic role, helping to fashion Mexican spectators into national subjects.246 On the one hand, the films reinforced the viewer’s awareness of their existence within an “imagined community,”247 but cinema also had a strong pedagogical and socializing function, serving as a “school” in which spectators could learn models of behavior that would be associated with what is typically Mexican.248 While scholars have questioned the lessons surrounding gender and sexuality that these didactic cultural products conveyed,249 what has yet to be pointed out is that through the ubiquity of Whiteness, these films also contained a heavy-handed lesson about race through which Mexican Whiteness was upheld as the aesthetic and cultural ideal.\n\nFurthermore, the didacticism of Golden Age cinema was effective precisely because it gave a White face to multiple groups within Mexican society. Nowhere is this dominance of Whiteness clearer than in the realm of melodrama. Because identification is an essential component of melodrama,250 and, as we have seen, Whiteness operates as the preferred human type for inciting identification in the Mexican context, the main characters of melodrama in Mexico tend to be White independently of their socioeconomic situation or ethnicity in the diegeses. This function of Whiteness is predicated on the fact that as a performative tradition, melodrama used physiognomy to “charg[e] the visible appearance of the actors with ethical values and counter values.”251\n\nWhiteness functions as the colonially determined glue that allows a broad sector of Mexican society to identify with and desire characters who have stigmatized social identities (as well as nonstigmatized ones) because Whiteness interpellates252 and appeals to spectators on the basis of their shared colonized desire and subjectivity.253 Because “[s]tars reach their audiences primarily through their bodies,”254 what Jesús Martín-Barbero has identified as the “secret pact that bonded [movie stars’] faces with the desires and obsessions of their publics”255 depended in Mexico on this White norm as its crucial factor. It is through Whiteness that a representative of the urban working class, Pepe “El Toro” (played by Pedro Infante in the 1948 film Nosotros los pobres), becomes one of the most cherished characters in all of Mexican cinema history. It is also through Whiteness that melodramatic Indigeneity works to endear itself to spectators through the faces of Dolores del Río and María Félix among many others. Or, to put it another way, the Whitening of marginalized social sectors in Mexican melodrama is their visual “re-semanticization through the hegemonic code”256 according to which White bodies are valuable and desirable. If, as Roger Bartra has argued, a specific “formula” is needed to produce the “transposition of some selected aspects of lower-class struggles and feelings to the domain of national culture,”257 then I argue that, with regard to cinema, Whiteness is that formula’s key ingredient.\n\nAlthough the formula yields a cinematic repertoire that dramatically distorts national reality,258 it has functioned effectively because of the extent to which coloniality in Mexico entrenched itself as the metric of value. Therefore, what has caused Mexican audiences to receive these films with a celebratory reaction259 is not the faithfulness of cinematic representation to their lived reality, because Mexican cinema, like Hollywood cinema, is largely a fantasy.260 Rather, Mexican audiences have traditionally applauded the code of Mexican cinematic irreality because they recognize its patterns formed in a local experience of coloniality (as opposed to that of Hollywood). Therefore, even though Mexican melodrama indeed “references a universe close to the spectator,”261 this in fact occurs in two different senses. The first is in the indexical sense of reproducing the sights and sounds a local spectator would recognize from their immediate environment—a long-standing feature of Latin American cinema production through which it offered something absent in Hollywood films.262 The second is that Mexican melodrama also showcases the codes of local epistemological dominance that obfuscate that spectator’s local reality. Even though it is true that Mexican film production throughout the Golden Age was highly influenced by Hollywood’s norms (while also seeking a cosmopolitanism that could make it palatable in Europe),263 because of the different positions that Indigeneity occupies in the US and Mexican racial formations and national projects, as well as the distinct parameters of Whiteness in both countries, Mexican cinema spawned and consistently deployed idiosyncratic “solutions” to filmic racial representation, such as whiteness-as-indigeneity.264 As we have seen, this particular trope seeks to retain the markers of Whiteness that are advantageous in the context of the local racial formation for the sake of featuring an Indigenous character as compassion-worthy and desirable both romantically and sexually.\n\nFurthermore, this idiosyncratic solution was also exportable to the rest of Latin America (a film market in which Mexican productions occupied a position of privilege during the Golden Age)265 as well as to diasporic communities in the United States.266 When Elena Lahr-Vivaz proposes that Spanish-speaking spectators throughout the Americas “glimpsed themselves in Golden Age films,”267 I suspect that part of what they were glimpsing was a shared experience of (originally Iberian) colonialism and coloniality.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the stars who would embody Mexican Whiteness on-screen were able to do so because they conformed to the contextual and ambiguous nature of Mexican Whiteness. As other scholars have already observed, many of these same actors (such as Lupe Vélez and Dolores del Río) were cast as ethnic Others within Hollywood’s distinct Anglo-American Protestant construct of Whiteness.268 According to Richard Dyer, within Hollywood’s racial framework, “Latin whites” are more sexual and prone to “anything that can be characterized as low, dark and irremediably corporeal.”269 In this sense, during their US careers, Vélez and del Río operated as incarnations of what María DeGuzmán has called “off-whiteness” in referring to the liminal positionality that Spaniards and their descendants in the Americas occupy within the US racial formation and cultural imagination precisely because they incarnate a deposed project of empire and modernity vis-à-vis that of the United States after 1898.270 The “alien whiteness” of these actresses generates Anglo-America’s “drama of the repulsion of and attraction to” them; however, ultimately, off-whites are “abjected from the ideal body politic.”271\n\nRegarding Indigenous-themed films, Mexican whiteness-as-indigeneity is an instance in which, as Ana M. López has articulated with regard to the representation of women in Golden Age cinema, “conflicting voices and needs visibly erupt into the cinematic and social sphere.”272 Whiteness-as-indigeneity functions as a “solution” to an aesthetic challenge raised by the shift in the official ideology regarding Mexican national identity after the Revolution.273 Whiteness-as-indigeneity operates as a palimpsest of discourses: beneath are the racialized vestiges of the colonial symbolic order that have not been entirely erased by the Revolution and continue to privilege Whiteness. Above is the new state-sponsored discourse urging Mexicans to value Indigenous people and peasants as worthy national subjects. Or, to use the vocabulary of Raymond Williams, we are seeing the relationship between the “residual” and the “emergent.”274 In this way, the use of Whiteness for representing Indigeneity (before, after, and during the Golden Age) operates as a hegemonic maneuver and sophisticated, colonially inflected semiotic trick to facilitate the national and personal appropriation of Indigeneity precisely through the continued glorification of Whiteness. In this way, these films, though nominally about Indigenous people, are actually heavily invested in affirming the nonnative national self through their showcasing of “nuestra bella apariencia estética criolla/mestiza sancionada como la norma hegemónica” (our beautiful criollo/mestizo aesthetic appearance, sanctioned as the hegemonic norm).275 Through racial masquerade, whiteness-as-indigeneity is a tool for impelling spectators toward varied ideological positions regarding the place of the native in national culture.\n\nThe White Indians of Mexican Cinema\n\nIn writing about the White Indians of Mexican cinema during the mid-twentieth century, I engage in the process of marking the ubiquity of Whiteness as a racist phenomenon in Mexican cinema. As a body of work, spanning from the early 1930s to the end of the 1960s, this group of films illustrates how the use of Whiteness to represent Indigenous womanhood (and, to a lesser degree, manhood) promotes the codification of Indigeneity into the national narrative in specific and varied manners that ultimately privilege Whiteness and reinscribe Indigenous people as the objects of coloniality.\n\nI would also like to state clearly what this book does not aim to accomplish. I am not arguing that these indigenista films effectively influenced the adoption of specific subjective attitudes toward Indigeneity. Such a study would require extensive information about the circulation and diffusion of the films as well as their financial accessibility and interviews with human subjects. It is a widely documented fact that the main audience for national films made during the Mexican Golden Age was urban populations, especially the working class. For the purpose of this volume, I am not concerned with researching more specifically who the spectators of the films analyzed here were because I do not claim to address the process through which the films’ perspectives were absorbed, but rather the variety of messages about the relationship between Indigeneity and the nation that they put forth in doubly racialized terms. Nor am I engaged in a project that seeks to recover native voices or extensively denounce the films’ inauthentic portrayal of Indigeneity. This study assumes, from the outset, the inauthenticity of the films with respect to the Indigenous cultures of Mexico, because the films are told from non-Indigenous perspectives and without the meaningful creative collaboration of Indigenous people. In other words, this book is preoccupied with how Mexican cinema functions as a tool of racialized dominance and not with analyzing subaltern forms of resistance in the realm of representation.\n\nMy approach to analyzing the films is influenced by Robert Stam, Louise Spence and Ella Shohat’s delineations of the formal aspects of film and narrative that constitute a social group’s representation within the medium.276 Because narrative and visual details are the sites through which films "
