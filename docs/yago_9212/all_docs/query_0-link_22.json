        "text": "Next Cine Plaza at the Fox screening brings classic Mexican film Maclovia\n\nAnother landmark of Mexican cinema is coming to Tucson’s Fox Theatre, 17 W Congress St., on Sunday, June 30 as part of the ongoing Cine Plaza at the Fox film series.\n\nMACLOVIA is a 1948 Mexican romantic drama directed by Emilio (El Indio) Fernández and starring María Félix and Pedro Armendáriz., Miguel Inclan, and Carlos López Mectezuma. The movie was acclaimed during the 1949 edition of the Venice Film Festival.\n\nOn the beautiful island of Janitzio, in the middle of Pátzcuaro Lake in the state of Michoacán, Mexico lives Maclovia (María Félix), the beautiful daughter of the leader of the local Tarasco Indian community. Maclovia loves José (Pedro Armendáriz), a young very poor Indian but her father does not approve of the relationship. The arrival of a battalion of soldiers from the Mexican mainland causes additional conflicts when the brutal sergeant leading the battalion (Carlos López Moctezuma) develops eyes for Maclovia.\n\nMexico’s landscape has never been as beautiful and breath taking and Maria Felix has never looked lovelier thanks to the wonderful award winning work on Maclovia of Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa.\n\nEstablished in 2010, the Cine Plaza series offers first class Spanish language films and original documentaries of Tucson and Southwestern Latino culture. The sixth of the Cine Plaza documentaries, on how Tucson was transformed by its mariachi and folklórico cultures, is now in production for a 2014 release.\n\nIf You Go:\n\nWhat: Cine Plaza at the Fox presents the classic Mexican film Maclovia\n\nWhen: June 30, 2 p.m.\n\nWhere: Tucson’s Fox Theatre, 7 W Congress St\n\nAdmission: $3 donation suggested"
