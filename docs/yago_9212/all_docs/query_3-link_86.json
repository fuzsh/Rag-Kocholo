        "text": "Doris Day starred in one and only one film by Alfred Hitchcock, “The Man Who Knew Too Much” (1956). Let’s do the stats: Grace Kelly featured in three of Hitch’s films, as did Ingrid Bergman, while Tippi Hedren and Vera Miles count for two films each. Then there was Madeleine Carroll in a pair of Hitch’s British films, “The 39 Steps” (1935) and “Secret Agent” (1936). She is often cited as the original “Hitchcock Blonde,” or, as some have it, the prototypical “icy blonde.”\n\nOther actresses, though one-timers with Hitchcock, also fit the mold: Edna Best, Eva Marie-Saint, Kim Novak, Janet Leigh, and let’s not forget Karen Black wearing a wig on the model of Veronica Lake in Hitchcock’s last film, “Family Plot” (1976). Yet Day was different from these actresses: Blonde though she may have been, her presence in “The Man Who Knew Too Much” is, if not a sticking point, then notably off-topic. For what Day exuded was not iciness or glamor, but pluck. In the end, she may have proved too spunky for Hitchcock.\n\nA newly restored version of “The Man Who Knew Too Much” is the centerpiece of “Hitchcock’s ’50s,” a one-week series at Film Forum that follows up on the soon-to-be-completed retrospective of the decade, “50 From the ’50s.” The Hitchcock program includes inescapable cinematic monuments like “Strangers on a Train” (1951), “Rear Window” (1954), “Vertigo” (1958), and “North By Northwest” (1959), as well as some that fall a smidgen below the standard: “To Catch a Thief” (1955) and “The Wrong Man” (1956).\n\nWere the 1950s Hitchcock’s finest decade? The ’40s put up a good fight, with “Shadow of a Doubt” (1943) and “Notorious” (1946) leading the pack. The ’60s were heralded with “Psycho” (1960), arguably the Hitchcock film with the greatest reach and influence. Yet mid-century saw the erstwhile director on a roll that had to be the envy of his peers. Billy Wilder did right by movie fans during the decade, as did Anthony Mann and John Ford, with Howard Hawks a hair’s breadth behind them. If Hitch doesn’t stand alone, he is an integral component of an amazing run in Hollywood.\n\n“Dial M for Murder” (1954) has been doing double duty at Film Forum, given that it’s also been screened as part of “A Deeper Look: Hollywood’s First 3-D Wave, 1953-1954.” Why this particular property was deemed worthy of the stereoscopic process likely has more to do with catching a wave than its mise en scène. Based on a stage play by Frederick Knott, the picture is heavy on dialogue and circumscribed in setting. Fortunately, the dialogue sparkles and Hitchcock lays out the parameters of the story’s environs to an almost fetishistic degree. Compared to something like “Rear Window,” “Dial M for Murder” is small beer. Still, it’s pretty fun.\n\nThat is, if you could buy into the notion that retired tennis player Tony Wendice (Ray Milland, supercilious and enjoying every minute of it) would want to kill Grace Kelly or, rather, his wife Margot. Tony is in receipt of a letter that confirms that Margo is having an affair with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). He calls Mark Swann (Anthony Dawson), an old school chum with a disreputable past. The back-and-forth between Tony and Mark is the best thing about the movie, with Milland and Dawson relishing every syllable of an improbably circuitous tête-à-tête. What follows afterward is a not-so-perfect crime elaborated upon and solved in the fashion of Agatha Christie.\n\nHitchcock had already made a version of “The Man Who Knew Too Much,” and the remake is equally abundant in suspense but also in comedy, reminding us of how vital humor was to Hitchcock’s vision. Dr. Benjamin McKenna of Indianapolis, Indiana (James Stewart), is vacationing in French Morocco with wife “Jo” (Day) and son Hank (Christopher Olsen). When Hank inadvertently removes a young woman’s niqāb — the scarf worn by Muslim women that covers the face — the all-American family incurs the wrath of her husband. Fortunately, Louis Bernard (Daniel Gélin), a suave but mysterious Farenchman, steps in to smooth things over.\n\nThings rarely stay smooth for long in the Hitchcockian universe. The good doctor and his family are soon embroiled in an international intrigue that includes a planned assassination attempt on the British prime minister. Did I mention that “Jo” was a former star of the theater? It’s reason enough to allow Day to sing “Que Sera Sera” — not once, but twice. Should that sound like overkill, the second version is the hinge on a major plot point that also turns out to be quite funny in its execution.\n\nDay brings to the proceedings her estimable gifts as a comedian and Stewart responds in kind. The story dawdles on for a good 45 minutes more than the original, but the keen pairing at its center makes it worth your time. That, and you get to enjoy America’s Sweetheart bedeviling the Master of Suspense. That alone is worth the price of admission.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the November 8, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nThe word “utopia” was coined by Thomas More upon writing his book of the same name. Conjoining the Greek words “ou” and “topos,” the 16th-century English philosopher, lawyer, and statesman posited a society so perfectly realized that it could only be fictional — that is to say “no place.” As history has proved on repeated occasions, illusions have never been lacking in adherents, but when the chimerical nature of this or that utopia is ultimately unveiled to a true believer, the reaction can be sobering.\n\nIt happens in the harrowing new documentary from Madeleine Gavin, “Beyond Utopia,” and the results are heartbreaking. When the 80-year old matriarch of the Roh family, Sunok Park, thinks of the promises made by the government of her native land — that would be North Korea — her face betrays a bewilderment so deep-seated that it is difficult to watch.\n\nLate in the movie, Sunok is being interviewed by the filmmakers with her daughter, Yeongbok Woo, at her side — that is, after they’ve fled from North Korea. A question is posed: Do you still think North Korea is the best? After some tense hemming and hawing, the older woman begins by sympathizing with Kim Jong-un and the challenges inherent to leadership. Yeongbok re-enters the frame and says: “Mom, don’t lie. When did Kim Jong-un ever give you rice to eat?”\n\nSunok refuses to engage in any badmouthing or, rather, she is incapable of doing so. She does talk about the decision to defect from North Korea alongside her daughter, son-in-law, and two young granddaughters. Should she have remained, Sunok admits, the security police would have to be reckoned with on a daily basis and bribes paid. Still, she can’t bring herself to be critical: “So we must — we must really work hard to make Marshall Kim Jong-un even a little bit happy.”\n\nMs. Gavin provides a tersely stated history lesson of the era and then showcases examples of North Korean propaganda. In an undated black-and-white cartoon, hopping-and-bopping soldiers move in unison to destroy a large bomb labeled “USA.” The accompanying music is jaunty; the refrain, is less so: “Eliminate the American bastards … eliminate everyone.”\n\nCut to a defector from the North who is now an activist based at Seoul, Lee Hyeon-Seo: “In North Korea, we don’t have such a word: American. We only have ‘American-Bastard.’”\n\nChildren learn math through story problems that involve the killing of Americans. They sing songs that iterate how “all human scum live in America.” Dismiss all of this as so much kitsch and then consider Grandma’s burgeoning amazement that the American filmmakers responsible for “Beyond Utopia” are not planning to kill her. They are, she says, “kind and nice.”\n\nAt the center of “Beyond Utopia” is Pastor Seungeun Kim, a defector, a Christian, and the spearhead of the South Korean equivalent of the underground railroad. Over the course of a decade, he has helped more than a 1,000 people escape from the North, earning the enmity of its government and putting his life at considerable risk. Notwithstanding a frame and demeanor that could be likened to that of a teddy bear, the good pastor is made of stern stuff, putting into effect escape plans of Byzantine complexity and utilizing intermediaries whose motives are decidedly un-Christian.\n\nIt is through these “brokers” of human life that much of the footage of the Roh family winding their way through jungles, safe houses, and various getaway cars was acquired. Other film was provided by family members, Pastor Kim and “Jiro,” a mysterious figure located in Japan who has posted unexpurgated photos and films of life in North Korea gleaned from cameras that he’s helped to smuggle inside its borders. This documentation is sometimes surreal, often brutal, and invariably tough-going. All the while, Kim Jong-un sustains a national mythology in which he is a Christ-like figure worthy of unquestioning supplication.\n\nMs. Gavin’s picture can’t be recommended enough even as it cannot be recommended lightly. “Beyond Utopia” is a difficult and important film.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the November 3, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nZeus transformed himself into a veritable zoo of beasts, Gregor Samsa woke up as a cockroach, and the preternaturally diffident Eva (Simone Bucio), the protagonist of director Ann Oren’s debut feature “Piaffe,” grows a tail — a horse’s tail, to be specific. Be cautioned that this addition to Eva’s physiognomy is the least outré part of a picture rife with narrative non sequiturs, prurient absurdities, and some icky byways. Welcome, one and all, to Surrealism 2.0.\n\nActually, strike the last analogy. “Piaffe” is, technologically speaking, old school. Not only has it been shot on 16mm film, but the set design by Ilaria Di Carlo makes a point of mechanisms — squeaky gears, rusty wheels, noisy locks, and other things that need oiling on a regular basis. The first thing the audience sees are the burnished brass holes of a kinetoscope through which we view stop-motion snippets of growing plants. Eva, you see, is the attendant at a botanical peep show. This won’t be the last time Ms. Oren, who co-wrote the script with Thais Guisasola, conflates sexual eccentricity with the prerequisites of nature.\n\nEva has been tasked with the job of providing sound effects for a television spot heralding a new antidepressant and attempts to replicate the noises created by a horse at the center of the campaign. When her efforts are derided by the commercial’s director — a mercurial individual with a platinum blonde ’do apparently inspired by Moe Howard of the Three Stooges — Eva sets out to commune directly with the animal world. Before you know it, a small nub begins to grow on her lower back, an appendage that will soon turn into a long and lustrous tail.\n\nAll the while, Eva becomes entranced by a man who is the only regular client at the peep show. Whereupon we learn why Novak (an appealingly haggard Sebastian Novak) is drawn to the premises: He’s in charge of the exhibits at a nearby botanical garden. When Eva shows up at his office door bearing roses, Novak, after a bit of hemming-and-hawing, makes a romantic overture — of a peculiar kind. What follows is a scene that is as willful in its provocations as it is genuinely erotic. Give Ms. Oren credit for touching a nerve even as she overplays her hand.\n\nThe title of the film refers to a maneuver in dressage in which a horse trots in place without gaining traction. It’s a fitting conceit for a movie that offers a series of digressions that accumulate rather than gain in momentum. There’s a mental hospital in which Eva’s non-binary sibling Zara (Simon[e] Jakiriuma Paetau) has been institutionalized, complete with an attendant who makes Nurse Ratched seem like Florence Nightingale. We’re also repeatedly shepherded to a discotheque in which our heroine becomes notably less withholding in her physicality. Tails, you know, they’re liberating.\n\nMs. Oren’s film is striking in its imagery, but overstays its welcome by a good 30 minutes. It’s also hampered by cinematic gimmickry. Scattershot lens flares, moments when the grain of the film becomes scratchy, and oh-so-symbolic double exposures are the pitfalls of, if not a first-time director necessarily, then someone who has spent too much time cloistered in art school. (The director earned her BFA and MFA from the School of Visual Arts.) David Lynch, a graduate of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, both honed and transcended his early mannerisms. The same could prove true of Ms. Oren’s thorny, untethered talent.\n\nIf “Piaffe” is fare not intended for general audiences, “Tokyo Cowboy” is a crowd-pleaser that will have to find out what crowd it’s intended for. It’s an independent feature that is resolutely conventional in trajectory. Japanese businessman Hideki (Arata Iura) travels to Montana’s Big Sky country in the hopes of turning a profit on a struggling cattle ranch. After his companion, an expert on Wagyu beef (an irrepressible and underutilized Jun Kunimura), takes a dive on a mechanical bull, Hideki is left to his own devices.\n\nA cadre of rough-and-tough, shoot-from-the-hip types eventually take a cotton to Hideki and he’s soon shedding his salaryman ways. A sidebar concerning an illegal quinoa farm is the most idiosyncratic aspect of what is, in the end, a likably middling entertainment. If you don’t mind a film that pretty much states its ambitions from the first frame, then you’ll enjoy this one just fine.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the November 3, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nThe German painter Max Beckmann (1884-1950) is likely best known for a series of sizable triptychs, canvases whose clustered images channel the medieval, the modern, the mythical, and the mundane. Many New Yorkers are best acquainted with him, in that regard, through “Departure” (1932/’33-’35), long a staple of the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection and as disjunctive an accounting of cultural dislocation as you could hope for — or withstand.\n\nBeckmann is also known for his formidable self-portraits, not a few of which can be seen in “Max Beckmann: The Formative Years, 1915-25,” a recently opened exhibition at the Neue Galerie. With that aggressive sweep of forehead and tight turn of mouth, Beckmann typically pictured himself facing down the viewer, stolid in bulk and blunt in demeanor. Dressing up as a sailor, as he does in “Self-Portrait with White Cap” (1926), is the closest he came to being light-hearted.\n\nThat isn’t to say Beckmann lacked a sense of humor. At the bottom right of “Paris Society” (1925/1931/1947) is a man covering his face in a gesture whose closest verbal equivalent might be “oy vey.” Beckmann’s widow Mathilde identified this figure as being a German ambassador, Leopold von Hoesch. But, really, take a look at that furrowed brow and tell me it isn’t Beckmann himself, mulling whether the company of his peers is a burden, a farce, or a gift.\n\nThis, in significant part, is how Beckmann viewed life itself. He bristled at being compared with the Expressionists. No slash-and-burn nihilism for Mr. Beckmann, thank you very much. “It’s stupid to love humanity,” he wrote, “but I love it anyway. I love its meanness, its banality, its dullness, its cheap contentment, and its oh-so-very-rare heroism.” When I asked a friend why Beckmann’s bizarre imagery didn’t qualify him as a Surrealist, she responded immediately: “Because the world is too real for him.” Exactly. Meet Max Beckmann, chronicler of times that are perpetually in crisis.\n\nBeckmann was born at Leipzig, studied at Weimar and established himself as the “German Delacroix” upon reaching Berlin. Although steeped in art history and wary of fashion, he kept an eye on vanguardist figures like a fellow countryman, Louis Corinth, and an odd painter from Norway, Edvard Munch. Beckmann achieved renown as a young artist and then came World War I. He served as a medic, saw the damage wrought by the industrialization of combat, and suffered nervous exhaustion. After being discharged, Beckmann approached art-making in a different manner. How could he not?\n\nThe Neue Galerie show focuses on a period encompassing World War I and stops short of the rise of National Socialism — between, as critic Robert Hughes memorably put it, “the sleepwalk and the goose step.” Stylistically, we see Beckmann employ softly modeled forms in cloistered Boschean dioramas like “Women’s Bath” (1919) and “The Dream” (1921), with its up-ended conglomeration of amputees, street performers, and musical instruments. The hieratic, harshly outlined shapes that would characterize his later paintings are seen in “Paris Society,” a canvas that was reworked over the space of some 22 years.\n\nBeckmann’s prolific output as a printmaker is on display with “Die Hölle (Hell)” (1919), a scabrous suite of etchings detailing the moral failings of Weimar Germany. The artist, ever urbane, pops in and out of these fractured portrayals of a society governed by excess, marked by poverty, and given to inevitable bouts of violence. Channeling the compositional strategies of Cubism, Beckmann’s bilious moralism is of a piece with similar meditations on civilization’s failings by contemporaries like George Grosz and Otto Dix.\n\nHis paintings are more distinctive and, I think, more profound, not least because they don’t capitulate to cynicism and self-righteousness. However equivocal Beckmann may have felt about humankind, his work is marked by a rapacious appetite for life. Even within the most enigmatic or caustic of scenarios, there are moments marked by empathy and hope. Here was a man who, after having later been driven out of his native Germany by a regime that dubbed his art “degenerate,” had the wherewithal to aver that “human sympathy and understanding must be reinstated … in the midst of a boundless world turmoil.”\n\nNo Pollyanna, our Max, but neither was he a fatalist. As invested as he was in limning the boundlessness of history and its abundant cruelties, Beckmann could not help but take note of the comedy inherent in fashion, the pleasures of sensual lassitude, the foibles of human congress, and a hot air balloon gliding gently on the air as if it were a visitor from on high. There are few artists, let alone modern artists, who achieve the goal of realizing the “fullness, roundness, and the vitally pulsing” nature of “essential things.” Max Beckmann was one of them. “The Formative Years” is a must-see exhibition.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis article was originally published in the November 2, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nIn an interview with Vogue magazine a little more than a year ago, the director Sofia Coppola mentions that taking on “Priscilla,” her new movie based on Priscilla Presley’s 1985 book “Elvis and Me,” was done as a “pivot” away from an Edith Wharton adaptation that was proving burdensome. Wanting to make “one film with one idea,” Ms. Coppola likened Ms. Presley’s experience as a teenager coming of age within the “amplified world” of Elvis Presley as “kinda similar to Marie Antionette.”\n\nMs. Coppola, you might remember, helmed “Marie Antionette” (2006), a picture released to mixed reviews, though critics in France found much to recommend within its fast-and-loose historical parameters. Some opinion makers stateside took the film to task for a soundtrack that was largely ahistorical, wondering if songs by post-punk musicians like the Cure, Bow Wow Wow, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and New Order were suitable for evoking the resplendent environs and political machinations of 17th-century Versailles.\n\nMusic has always been a vital component of Ms. Coppola’s films. Bill Murray’s karaoke version of’ “More Than This” in “Lost in Translation” (2003) made plain the vulnerability that was occluded in the original by Roxy Music. The pivotal use of songs by the Jesus and Mary Chain in the same film did much to reboot their pop profile. Did “Marie Antionette” do something similar for Gang of Four when it featured the song “Natural’s Not In It”? Somehow, aggrieved Marxist caterwaul seems less user-friendly than Bryan Ferry keening about the vagaries of romance.\n\nThose expecting “Priscilla” to include an array of Elvis songs will be disappointed. Authentic Brands Group, the corporation that is a majority owner of Elvis Presley Enterprises, didn’t grant access to Ms. Coppola and her cohorts. My knowledge of copyright law being what it is, I wonder how a re-created snippet of “Guitar Man” from Elvis’s epochal 1968 television special made it into the movie. Still, anachronism in the soundtrack flourishes — from the Ramones to a just-out-of-chronological-sync Tommy James and the Shondells to Phoenix, a group headed by Ms. Coppola’s husband, Thomas Mars.\n\nHow true to life is “Priscilla”? The story of a 24-year old Elvis Presley courting 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu is as chaste, in its own weird way, as it is unseemly. What did the recently drafted pop idol, played by Jacob Elordi from the HBO series “Euphoria,” see in the daughter of Captain and Mrs. Paul Beaulieu (Ari Cohen and Dagmara Domincyzk)? An American girl, pure of mien. The junge frauen of Germany proved too starstruck to be good company.\n\nNot that your average ninth-grader back in 1959 didn’t know who Elvis Presley might be. When Priscilla (Cailee Spaeny) is given parental permission to join a party hosted by Presley, she arrives dumbfounded not only by the number of adults on hand, but by the attention bestowed on her by one of the world’s most famous men. After sequestering themselves together, Elvis admits to a level of insecurity about his diminishing fame. Priscilla tells him that “Heartbreak Hotel” is her favorite song.\n\nAfter taking Priscilla to the pictures — “Beat the Devil” (1953), of all things, is the film of choice — Elvis talks about becoming a movie star along the lines of Marlon Brando and James Dean. Although Elvis’s cinematic output is nowhere near as dreadful as it is often assumed, we know, at this late date, that Hollywood and his erstwhile manager, Tom “the Colonel” Parker, did much to tame Presley.\n\nIn “Priscilla,” the making of movies takes Elvis away from his beloved Priscilla and, should the gossip rags be believed, into the arms of co-stars like Ann Margaret. Tensions between Elvis and his pretty young ward increase, as does the usage of pills and, with them, stray moments of violence.\n\nDid the world really need another movie about Elvis Presley? Protestations to the side about this being Ms. Presley’s story, “Priscilla” tells us more about Elvis’s wants, needs, and failings than it does about its title character. As played out in Ms. Coppola’s script, Priscilla remains something of a cipher, more of a post-feminist sounding board than a full-fledged character.\n\nAdmittedly, that might be the point — proving just how dehumanizing unchecked masculinity might be. But when Priscilla either undergoes or instigates transitions in her relationship with Elvis, the audience is curiously absented from them. As a result, we remain perplexed by the inscrutable woman at the center of what is, in the end, a meandering and episodic picture.\n\nMs. Spaeny does her best with the bare bones given to her by Ms. Coppola. But one does have to wonder if the executive producer — that would be Ms. Presley herself — encouraged some massaging of biographical particulars? As it is, “Priscilla” is a handsomely mounted film of minor interest, a cinematic venture that falls flat by being more subtle and more evasive than its story warrants.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the October 31, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\n“Where the Devil Roams” is the kind of thing I keep hoping to encounter in museums of contemporary art — you know, inside those darkened galleries in which viewers are expected to hunker down on bean bag chairs or something equally uncomfortable in order to take in avant-gardist video installations.\n\nWhat one usually experiences in these situations is propaganda of a peculiarly aggrieved sort or artless montages set to backdrops of thrumming sounds. Unless clock-watching counts as an aesthetic response, these objets d’ art, whether low-fi or high-tech, tend to be thin gruel for the soul.\n\nNot so “Where the Devil Roams,” the new movie written, directed, and starring John Adams, Tobey Poser, and Zelda Adams. Would that our museum-certified artistes had the cunning, know-how, and visionary reach of the Adams family and their nifty little horror film.\n\nYes, that’s right: the Adams family, but not Morticia, Gomez, and the other denizens of Charles Addams’ classic New Yorker cartoons. Rather, husband John, wife Tobey, and daughters Zelda and Lulu, all proud citizens of Roscoe, New York, a hamlet of some 500-people about a two-hour drive from Manhattan.\n\nMr. Adams is a former model, having worked for Giorgio Armani and Calvin Klein. Ms. Poser is an actress who’s been on the stage and in the soaps, as well as “Sex and the City.” When confronted by illness, parenthood, and the vagaries of professional life, the couple began making their own “no budget” movies with growing daughters in tow. As Zelda and Lulu came of age, their input into the family’s cinematic ventures grew as well. For how much longer is a good question: Zelda has moved onto a modeling career. Striking a pose, it seems, runs in the family.\n\n“Where the Devil Roams” is an ingenious confection, a grimy and often gory tale that is at once bound by history (Depression-era America) and defiantly anachronistic (punk in attitude, players, and soundtrack). It details a family shattered by war, wracked by poverty, and, ultimately, beholden to otherworldly powers.\n\nThey make their way as circus performers, with an act that poaches upon Christian iconography of a rather saccharine sort. Along the way, murders are committed in the cause of economic warfare, lack of neighborliness, and, increasingly, the collection of spare body parts. The family’s mode of transport is a ’31 Chevy; their emotional affect, stoic. Seven, Maggie, and Eve — respectively, Mr. Adams, Ms. Tobey, and Ms. Adams — are, in their own way, not-so-distant cousins of Grant Wood’s “American Gothic.”\n\nThe prologue to the film is tell-tale. A legless performer with ornate tattoos and elaborate piercings waddles on his hands across a stage and proceeds to read the title poem to a theater packed with well-heeled, whitebread patrons. His articulation is stilted; the film, black-and-white; the sound, somewhat tinny. The performer is here-and-now; the audience, cut-and-pasted from a film circa-1930. The allusion to Tod Browning’s “Freaks” is unmistakable, as is the cinematic artifice.\n\nThe latter may be due to financial constraints, but it is also an integral component of an aesthetic strategy. The Adams’s film may be a shoestring venture and, at moments, shaky in its acting, but it has also been exquisitely calibrated and cleverly nipped-and-tucked. Close-ups are predominant and compositions are composed with evident care. The color and grain of the film change, almost surreptitiously, throughout the proceedings to suit the story. Digital hocus-pocus has been applied sparingly and is endowed with an odd, handmade character. Practical effects courtesy of Trey Lindsay are all-too-convincing.\n\nEconomy of means can result in artistic ingenuity. Here is Exhibit A proving as much.\n\nWhat can this kind-of-but-not-really home movie be compared to? Cultish fare like “Eraserhead,” for sure, but there are also echoes of “The Passion of Joan of Arc” (1928), Walker Evans, Andrew Wyeth, Ingmar Bergman, and, if I’m not mistaken, Paul Cezanne. Keep an eye out for cinematic Easter eggs — I spied a fleeting shout-out to Boris Karloff — and note both the understatement and the clarity of the editing.\n\nHere is a rarity: a straight-faced horror film that sends out nods and winks — not with condescension, but with love. Who needs Hollywood when you’ve got Roscoe to call home?\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the October 30, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nI’m pleased to have written an essay that will be accompanying this upcoming exhibition in Greece. See the invitation above for more information.\n\nThe notion of “lost and found” is predicated on cooperation, albeit of an inadvertent sort. A given item is misplaced by one individual and subsequently discovered by another. What happens to the object depends on the wiles and generosity of the latter party. Will it be placed in a holding space for retrieval by its original owner or, on the logic of “finders and keepers,” be taken as a kind of spoil?\n\nDifferent circumstances entail different resolutions. Within the history of modernism, the “found object” comes with its own tradition, that of repurposing an item whose original function wasn’t crafted with art in mind. That’s the “losing” part. Finding, in these terms, is a means of recontextualization and, with that, a presumed new lease on life for the object at hand.\n\nThe impetus for this exhibition was the reclamation of a post-war apartment of Byzantine complexity located in Victoria Gardens. These environs, due for renovation after this exhibition has ended, will serve as the future studio for Artemis Alcalay, who, in conjunction with curator Laura Dodson, organized “Lost and Found.”\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that this space is within the same building in which Alcalay was born-and-raised. Can a person go home again? The American novelist Thomas Wolfe famously replied in the negative. Dodson and Alcalay suggest that you can go home again, but only under conditions that underline the changes entailing the personal, the cultural and the historical that have since taken place. Which means, in a roundabout way, that the organizers are more in agreement with Wolfe than we might initially assume.\n\nThe artists included in “Lost and Found” work in a gamut of styles and a dizzying array of materials. Paint and canvas are in evidence, but so are photography, printmaking, video, dance, thread, wax and fabric. Antique books are included, as are new technologies and a settee seemingly transplanted from the 19th-century. Does this multiplicity of forms connote, as Dodson writes, “the imagination’s ability to supplant loss and desire with hope?” Taking into account the juxtapositions of artworks within their current surroundings, it would be wise not to bet against it.\n\nBesides, the current surroundings are smack dab in the middle of Athens, a city in which fragments of antiquity are forever being found, reclaimed and held in situ as a means of confirming the ineluctable reach of human accomplishment. What Dodson and Alcalay have done here isn’t quite as epochal, nor does it pretend to be. But there is a sweet correspondence between this exhibition and its host city, between the reclamation of time within reach and times long past gone. In that regard, “Lost and Found” taps into currents that are bigger than any single artist can claim and, in doing so, opens them for the rest of us.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nWhat, you might ask upon perusing the title of Justin Monroe’s documentary, “Holy Frit,” is frit? That there’s a play on words going on is obvious, but not so much when it comes to the words being played with. “Frit” is vital to Mr. Monroe’s story of over-scaled ambitions, material frustration, and an ultimate compensation that is, in equal parts, financial, aesthetic, and spiritual.\n\nLaymen in the audience learn about frit almost tangentially as we watch Narcissus Quagliata — yes, that’s his real name — sprinkle a granular mixture of something or other upon flat shards of colored glass that are then placed in a kiln. Pace the ever reliable Miriam Webster, frit is “various chemically complex glasses used ground especially to introduce soluble or unstable ingredients into glazes or enamels.”\n\nAs seen in Mr. Monroe’s picture, frit occasions a painterly range of color and texture that is then combined with “fused glass,” a specialized technique that is Mr. Quagliata’s contribution to the medium. The renowned glass artist is the secret weapon of Judson Studios, a family-owned business based at Los Angeles. Mr. Quagliata is called in for his expertise when the company lands a bid to make the world’s largest stained glass window and subsequently realizes that it’s taken on more than it can handle.\n\nAlong with his expertise, Mr. Quagliata brings an abundance of pithy opinions, hackle-raising behavior, and sizable stogies that are perpetually at hand. Even without “the Maestro” and his jet-setting ways, Judson Studios is undergoing enough stress prompted by the multimillion-dollar commission.\n\nDavid Judson, its fifth-generation owner and operator, is an even-keeled sort who loathes to give in or admit to his anxieties. All the same, he betrays grizzlement as the project progresses. As for Tim Carey, the painter in Mr. Judson’s employ who lands the job with the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection, the press release describes him as “a bit of a jackass.”\n\nOnly a bit? Mr. Carey has a forbearing wife and beautiful children, but, boy, is he a piece of work. We first encounter him at the wheel of his car, semi-facetiously bemoaning the artist’s lot in life, rattling on about being the suburban kid amongst a cadre of weirdos in art school. A talented painter with a sense of humor, Mr. Carey is also headstrong and prickly. He can’t help but betray his frustrations — and his snark — when dealing with his boss, co-workers, Mr. Quagliata, and the representatives from the church.\n\nStill, they all muddle through. The folks from the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection — you might remember its pastor, Adam Hamilton, from the second inauguration of President Obama — are a remarkably patient lot. Which isn’t to say that there aren’t snags. Money problems are encountered, but so too are lawsuits, bureaucratic snafus, and accusations of environmental poisoning. That, and Mr. Carey isn’t spending enough time with the kids.\n\nYuchiro Oku’s soundtrack, jaunty and loud, telegraphs the dramatic trajectory of the story, as does Mr. Monroe, whose light, almost farcical touch similarly undermines “the drama of any human endeavor that is greater than the sum of its parts.” Still, he’s crafted an amiable film that is most compelling when settling its lens on the benefits of community — whether it be the members of Pastor Hamilton’s flock or, especially, the employees of Judson Studios.\n\nIn the end, “Holy Frit” underlines its abiding humanity by straying from its primary storyline.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the October 27, 2023 edition of The New York Sun."
