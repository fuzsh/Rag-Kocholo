        "text": "Fabián [Fabián Aranza]: actor who had some second leads in the 1970s (Mecánica nacional, La dinastia Drácula), but has played mostly supporting roles--often villainous--since. Not to be confused with the U.S. pop singer Fabian (real name, Fabian Forte).\n\nFábregas, Virginia [María Barragán] (1870 or '71?-1950): famous stage actress of the late 19th and early 20th centuries (her professional stage debut came in 1892) who made only a few film appearances, late in her career. Her son Manuel Sánchez Navarro, grandson Manolo Fábregas, and great-grandson Rafael Sánchez Navarro all followed her into the acting profession.\n\nFábregas, Manolo (1921-1996): actor and theatrical producer, known as \"Señor Teatro\" for his years of work as an actor, producer, director and theatrical impresario. Fábregas was born on 15 July 1921 in Vigo, Spain. His real name was Manuel Sánchez Navarro Schiller: his grandmother was the famous actress Virginia Fábregas, his father--Manuel Sánchez Navarro--was an actor, and his mother--Fanny Schiller--was also a well-known performer. Manolo's first film role came in 1933, when he appeared with his father in Pecados de Amor. His film career in earnest at the age of 20. He originally played supporting roles, occasionally as someone's son or younger brother, or as a \"male ingenue\" type, most often in dramatic films, but in the 1950s he moved up to starring roles, often in comedies. At the end of decade he began to devote most of his time to his theatrical endeavors and made only sporadic film appearances afterwards. Fábregas was awarded a \"Diosa de Plata\" by PECIME for his performance in Mecánica nacional. His final film appearances were in the early 1980s, in the Televicine productions Lagunilla, mi barrio and its sequel, Lagunilla 2. However, he continued to work on television and in the theatre until May 1987, when he suffered a stroke that limited his activities, although he stayed active in the theatrical world until his death of a heart attack in February 1996. Several of his children are also actors, notably Rafael Sánchez Navarro.\n\nFaiad, Zulma: busty Argentine \"vedette\" (dancer, showgirl, actress) who worked in Mexican films from the late '60s through the '70s, for example La noche de los mil gatos and El ídolo (both 1970). She had been on-screen in Argentina as early as 1961, and is still active there on the stage.\n\nFajardo, Eduardo [Eduardo Fajardo Martínez] (1918 or '24?--): Fajardo was born in Spain and received his law degree there in 1945, but never practiced this profession, instead choosing an acting career. He worked in the theater and films in his native land before coming to Mexico in 1953 under contract to Miguel Contreras Torres, who put him in his first Mexican picture, Tehuantepec (this film was also made in an English-language version, with Dan O'Herlihy in Fajardo's role). For the rest of the decade and into the '60s Fajardo spent a significant amount of time in Mexico, working in films and producing and directing stage plays. Fajardo was often cast as unsympathetic characters, from outright villains to snobbish and selfish husbands, etc. By the mid-'60s, however, he was once again mostly working in Spain, and he continued to appear in films there through the 1980s.\n\nFalcón, Federico [Federico del Castillo] (1935-80): actor brother of Eric del Castillo, in films from the '60s into the 1970s, usually in secondary roles, sometimes villainous and sometimes sympathetic.\n\nFalcón, Rafael (?--1942): Argentine-born actor and singer, occasional leading man in 1930s' films. Pleasant enough, but not especially distinctive. Can be seen sharing the lead with future star Jorge Negrete in 1938's Juntos pero no revueltos.\n\nFegan, Jorge (1931-1993): Ecuadorian actor who started working in Mexican cinema in the mid-60s and racked up a very long list of credits into the 1990s. Won an Ariel award towards the end of his career for Rojo amanecer (1991).\n\nFélix, María (1911 or '14?-2002): One of the great personalities of Mexican cinema, María de los Angeles Félix was born in Sonora, one of 16 children (12 surviving infancy). The family later moved to Guadalajara; while they were living there, María met and married Enrique Alvarez, at the time a traveling salesman for Max Factor cosmetics. Félix and Alvarez had a son, future actor Enrique Alvarez Félix, but the marriage soon broke up. Félix traveled to Mexico City, where she was \"discovered\" by Fernando Palacios. She made her film debut opposite Jorge Negrete in 1941's El peñon de las ánimas. Over the next 29 years, Félix was one of the top stars of Mexican cinema. After she starred in the title role of Doña Bárbara (1943), Félix was nicknamed \"La Doña,\" a sobriquet she carries to this day. She took home three Best Actress Arieles--for Enamorada (1947), Río Escondido (1949), Doña Diabla (1951)--and was nominated for El monje blanco (1946) and Camelia (1955). Félix also made a fair number of films in Europe during the late 1940s and 1950s. Her last film was La generala (1970), after which she retired from the screen, although she remains a conspicuous public figure, spending most of her time in Paris. In addition to Enrique Alvarez, María Félix's husbands included composer Agustín Lara and actor Jorge Negrete.\n\nFernández, Agustín (1920-1991): sinister-looking brother of Emilio Fernández who had a fairly long career (to at least 1989's La gallera) in minor roles as villainous henchmen.\n\nFernández, Claudia: young actress of the 1990s, won an Ariel for her role opposite Vicente Fernández in Por tu maldito amor (1991).

Worked steadily in films into the 1950s; made a brief comeback in 1991 in Los años de Greta, but ill-health forced her to retire once more . Briefly married to Antonio Badú (they were a couple for more than six years, but officially married only 18 months). She died of heart failure on 21 October 1999.\n\nFernández, Fernando (1916-1999): singer/actor who achieved his greatest success in cabaretera films of the late 1940s, where he was often teamed with Meche Barba. After being rejected by the STPC directors' union, he started working for STIC as a director at the América studios. Fernández was severely burned in an automobile accident in 1960 and had to undergo plastic surgery on his face and hands, although he did take occasional acting roles later, including one directed by his half-brother Jaime (such as El sinaloense, 1984). He was also in a number of movies directed by his step-brother and cousin Emilio (Emilio's father married Fernando's mother after her first husband died; her first husband was Fernando's father, who happened to be Emilio's father's brother--is that clear?), such as Enamorada (1946), Duelo en las montañas (1949), and El crepúsculo de un dios (1968). Fernando Fernández died on 24 November 1999.\n\nFernández, Freddy \"El Pichi\" (1934-1995): the eternally-youthful \"Pichi\" made his screen debut in 1943, but shot to fame as the eager teenage suitor of Evita Muñoz \"Chachita\" in Nosotros los pobres and Ustedes los ricos. Most of his roles, even into the 1980s, saw him playing similar characters (Fernández and Muñoz later co-starred on a TV sitcom, \"Nostros los Gómez\"), since his appearance changed little as he aged. Fernández, who died of cancer in 1995 , received three Ariel nominations in his career--Pepe el toro (1954), Con quien andan nuestras hijas? (1957), and La ciudad de los niños (1958).\n\nFernández, Jaime (1927-2005): actor, occasional director, and long-time union executive (he also served in Mexico's legislature for 8 years). Took home three Arieles for acting--El rebozo de Soledad (1952), La rebelión de los colgados ('54), and Robinson Crusoe ('52). Fernández stopped directing in the '80s, but then resumed his acting career, which continued into the 1990s. His filmmaking brothers included Agustín and Rogelio Fernández (Emilio and Fernando were his half-brothers). Fernández was married twice, and has four children, including two who are performers and one who is a producer.\n\nFernández, José Luis: balding, moustached, ubiquitous character actor and stunt heavy, usually in Westerns, from the 1950s into the '70s. This may be the same performer, nicknamed \"El Bigotes,\" who was a comic and acrobat in the carpa theatres. Born in Oaxaca.\n\nFernández, Maribel \"La Pelangocha\": female comic actress, frequently in \"sexy-comedies\" from the 1980s onward.\n\nFernández, Pedro (1969--): Guadalajara-born singer and actor who began appearing in films as a young boy in the late '70s, and continued to make occasional appearances in action films into the early '90s. Fernández's signature hit as an adolescent singer was \"La mochila azul\" (The Blue Bookbag); he is chiefly a proponent of ranchera singing. One of his younger brothers, Gerardito, is also a singer. Pedro Fernández is married and has three children. \"Pedro Fernández\" is not his real name, it is a combination of \"Pedro\" (from Pedro Infante) and \"Fernández\" (from Vicente Fernández).\n\nFernández, Rolando: actor husband of Rosa Gloria Chagoyán, Rolando Fernández López is one of five children of Raúl Fernández Fernández, who founded Scope Films. Despite his nondescript appearance, Rolando often plays the hero opposite his wife. Rolando's brother Raúl Fernández López has directed most of the Chagoyán-Fernández hits such as Lola la trailera and Juana la cubana.\n\nFernández, Vicente (1940--): one of the biggest stars of 1970s and 1980s Mexico, Vicente Fernández was born in Huentitlán in the state of Jalisco. As a youth he had a variety of jobs, but turned professional singer at the age of 21, appearing on local TV in Guadalajara. He later moved to Mexico City, and after becoming a success on TV and with his recordings, made his film debut in 1970. At first he was cast in rancheras and urban, working-class comedy-dramas in frank imitation of Pedro Infante, but he later appeared in some Westerns and contemporary dramas (albeit with music) as well. Fernández, married to the same woman since 1963, has three sons, the youngest of whom (Alejandro Fernández) is a major singing star himself (Vicente and Alejandro appeared together in the film Mi querido viejo (1991)). Fernández's films include Picardia mexicana, Tacos al carbón (his first), and La ley del monte.\n\nFerrara, Juan [ Juan Félix Guilmain] (1943--): Dark-haired, sharp-featured actor from the 1960s on.
