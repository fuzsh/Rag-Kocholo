        "text": "Tonight in Piazza Maggiore (with a cover set at Cinema Arlecchino in case of rain) we will watch Dans la nuit (France/1929), one of the last masterpieces of silent french cinema, accompanied by the music of the finnish band Cleaning Women. It was the first and only directing credits of Charles Vanel, who was mainly an actor - a quiet prolific one, actually. The passage from acting to directing is not such a strange phenomenon nowadays, but it's still pretty unusual. At Il Cinema Ritrovato this year, we can find also other cases.\n\nThe monster of Dusseldorf for Fritz Lang, the man who knew too much for Hitchcock, and Raskolnikov for Josef von Sternberg. This year Il Cinema Ritrovato has decided to dedicate a section to the talent of Peter Lorre: Peter Lorre, a foreigner in a foreign land. As a means of celebrating this magnificent actor, whilst waiting to see him on the big screens of the festival, let's explore the lesser known side of him ... the cartoons!"
