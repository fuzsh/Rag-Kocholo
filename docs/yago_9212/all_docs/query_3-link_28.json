        "text": "Stage your own cinematic celebration of Cinco de Mayo, marked Monday, with films featuring famous Mexican directors, writers and actors. This list is in no way comprehensive, but rather a starting point to explore the rich heritage of Mexican film.\n\nBegin by kicking it old school with a few classics from the golden age of Mexican cinema: Fernando de Fuentes' \"Doña Bárbara\" (1943) starring María Félix; Emilio Fernández's \"María Candelaria\" (1943) starring Dolores del Río; and Fernández's 1947 excellent adaptation of John Steinbeck's \"The Pearl\" starring Pedro Armendáriz. Both directors are as legendary as any from Hollywood and helped pave the way for future generations of influential Mexican filmmakers.\n\nAlfonso Cuarón — Without doubt one of modern Mexico's hottest exports, Cuarón is such a natural filmmaker, it's been a pleasure watching his career mature and grow. The writer-director made his feature debut with 1991's Spanish-language \"Love in the Time of Hysteria,\" a dark romantic comedy that mixes slapstick farce with overwrought melodrama, in which Cuarón pays not-so-subtle homage to one of his personal heroes, Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. Ten years would pass until his next Mexican feature, \"Y Tu Mamá También,\" a provocative coming-of-age drama that would earn Cuarón Golden Globe and Oscar nominations.\n\nMeanwhile, Cuarón's talents have not gone unnoticed in Hollywood. His first English-language feature, 1995's \"A Little Princess,\" was splendidly filmed, though his next, a modernized adaptation of Dickens' \"Great Expectations,\" was a huge letdown. Fans balked when Cuarón was tapped to helm \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" but his dark edginess turned out to be just what the foundering series needed.\n\nBy now a proven commodity, Cuarón was given full reign to adapt and direct a dystopian novel by P.D. James. 2006's \"Children of Men,\" a downbeat sci-fi favorite, was followed by his greatest achievement so far, last year's award-winning \"Gravity.\" Stunningly original and technically dazzling, the film showcases the director's gift for visual composition, narrative thrills and offbeat character development. Although not one of the most prolific filmmakers, Cuarón just keeps getting better and better.\n\nGuillermo del Toro — Another wildly successful native son, del Toro's name is synonymous with dark fantasy, horror and over-the-top sci-fi action. Born in Guadalajara, he was mentored as a teen in special-effects makeup by Hollywood legend Dick Smith (\"The Exorcist\") and cut his teeth with several self-produced shorts before attracting major studio attention. The filmmaker's early career is divided between ultra-creepy Spanish-language films — \"Cronos\" (1993), \"The Devil's Backbone\" (2001) and \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (2006) — and big-budget Hollywood favorites such as \"Blade II\" (2002), \"Hellboy\" (2004), and last year's \"Pacific Rim.\" When he's not writing or directing, del Toro can be found producing a wide variety of films, from horror (\"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark,\" \"Mama\") to drama (\"Biutiful\") and animated comedy (\"Puss in Boots,\" \"Kung Fu Panda 2\").\n\nAlfonso Arau — If nothing else, you have to admire Arau's long and varied career as writer, director, producer and actor, both in his native Mexico and Hollywood. Best known for his dark comedic edge, he began as an actor in small Spanish-language films in the 1950s and '60s, landing breakout roles in two controversial westerns, Sam Peckinpah's \"The Wild Bunch\" (1969) and Alejandro Jodorowsky's \"El Topo\" (1971). Since then, Arau has divided his time between Mexican and American projects, including \"Inspector Calzonzin,\" \"Used Cars,\" \"Romancing the Stone\" and \"Three Amigos.\" As director, he is best known for his 1992 Spanish-language adaptation of \"Like Water for Chocolate\" and 1995's \"A Walk in the Clouds.\"\n\nThe best American films set in Mexico include: John Huston's \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948) and \"Under the Volcano\" (1984); Sam Peckinpah's \"The Wild Bunch\" (1969) and \"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\" (1974); Julie Taymor's \"Frida\" (2002); and Robert Rodriguez's Mexico Trilogy: \"El Mariachi\" (1992), \"Desperado\" (1995) and \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" (2003). Special mention goes to Spanish director Luis Buñuel's 1962 classic \"The Exterminating Angel,\" produced during his exile in Mexico."
