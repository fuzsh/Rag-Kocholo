Too much, I think, thoughts like\n\n\"look, they just copied, what they captured from the Germans\" probably are around the corner\n\nand I wouldn't be surprised, if that was the intention !\n\n- Don't know of any mention, that rockets were regarded as something else, as a way to transport\n\nbombs (the development just started as a substitute for long range artillery) or may be men. Have\n\nfound no indication, that space flight was really envisaged and if so, probably rather in a way similar\n\nto that, shown by the UFA motion picture company (\"Frau im Mond\"). Though mentioned by some\n\nrocket scientists after the war, as the true reason for their efforts, I think of this rather as an excuse.\n\n- And the problems, the German \"rocket industry\" was still facing up to 1945, were far too big, to my\n\nopinion, to allow for any digressions from the principally target: To deliver a payload, as heavy as possible,\n\nas far as possible to targets on earth, not in space !\n\n- Last, UNICRAFT is known for producing models of \"rare types\", but especially about German WW II aircraft and\n\nweapons, I think, they shouldn't be regarded as a reliable source. They probably have done their share to\n\nmake projects like the V4 or V7 Feuerball \"real\" . :\n\nThat's why I moved this topic to this section, at least until we get confirmation from a more reliable source.\n\nlastdingo\n\nBlogger http://defense-and-freedom.blogspot.de/\n\nJoined\n\n18 October 2008\n\nMessages\n\n589\n\nReaction score\n\n99\n\nWebsite\n\ndefense-and-freedom.blogspot.de\n\n30 September 2015\n\n#6\n\nActually, the rocket developers dreamt of rocket-powered aircraft or flight to moon, not of lobbing explosives into London.\n\nThe utility of a satellite was not fully recognized, though - the one exception I know of was a (post-war?) fantasy of a huge ring-shaped space station as a base for moon or mars travels.\n\narchipeppe\n\nACCESS: Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n18 October 2007\n\nMessages\n\n2,344\n\nReaction score\n\n2,537\n\n30 September 2015\n\n#7\n\nThe Unicraft design is obviously derived from the original Sputnik.\n\nvon Braun always dreamed to use his rockets for scientific purposes but never dare the SS due to the Hitler's strict orders to use rockets exclusively as wespons.\n\nKorolev were forced to design from scratch the \"Object PS\" also known as Sputnik since the original planned Russian first satellite the \"Object D\" (later launched as Sputnik 3) was behind the schedule. He assigned the task to his OKB-1 lead designer Mikhail S. Khomyakov who accomplished the task in a real crash programme aimed to realize a real simple satellite able to stand the space environment and transmit radio signal to ground.\n\nThe result was the Простейший Спутник-1 \"Elementary Satellite 1\", designed as a mere sphere (since the simplest shape) in two units a main one and a backup one.\n\nAt times when PS-1 was designed and built all the German scientists previously located in USSR (the Gottrupp group) were already returned to homeland so not was possible any German influence on its design (as it could be the case for the R-7 rocket).\n\nThe backup unit still exists today.\n\nAvimimus\n\nACCESS: Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n15 December 2007\n\nMessages\n\n2,260\n\nReaction score\n\n550\n\n30 September 2015\n\n#8\n\narchipeppe said:\n\nThe Unicraft design is obviously derived from the original Sputnik.\n\nvon Braun always dreamed to use his rockets for scientific purposes but never dare the SS due to the Hitler's strict orders to use rockets exclusively as wespons.\n\nA convenient tale after his rehabilitation, isn't it?\n\nI'm not suggesting he wasn't interested in science. However, if you read the second half of Goethe's Faustus you'll see the scientist bring Prussia's enemies to their knees being presented as a good. It wasn't uncommon for people to feel that fighting for their country is an inherent good.

The LOX/alcohol propellant was pretty awful and the mass ratios atrocious. In order to lurch even a small payload into orbit, the A-9/10 would need the A-11 stage underneath *that,* and the Germans were *nowhere* near capable of building the A-11.\n\nIn order to get a payload to orbit, the Redstone rocket needed to be *greatly* improved over the V-2. Stretched, improved engine, improved mass ratio, and greatly improved control systems. It's not simply a matter of nailing a satellite to the top of the missile and wishing real hard.\n\nthe final design of the A10 booster was powered by a 1,670 kN (380,000 lbf) thrust rocket burning diesel oil and nitric acid, during its 50-second burn it would have propelled its A9 second stage to a speed of about 4,300 km/h (2,700 mph)\n\nAnd orbital speed is about 19,000 miles per hour. That's 7 times faster than the A-9/10. And in terms of *energy,* that's 7*7 = 49 times short of orbit. The A-10 was *nowhere* near orbital in capability.\n\nP.S. Soviet Sputnik 1 was a 23.0 in diameter sphere, and had a mass only of 8.3.0 kg (184 lb). it's Very small, and V-2 teoretically can take this mass to orbit,\n\nNo, it can't.\n\narchipeppe\n\nACCESS: Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n18 October 2007\n\nMessages\n\n2,344\n\nReaction score\n\n2,537\n\n23 December 2015\n\n#32\n\nI quote Scott word for word....\n\nXP67_Moonbat\n\nACCESS: Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n16 January 2008\n\nMessages\n\n2,252\n\nReaction score\n\n407\n\n27 December 2015\n\n#33\n\nVladimir, your dream is dead.

Of that, 1,000 kg was warhead (payload) and 8,720 kg was propellant. The rocket engine produced a sea level specific impulse of 203 seconds, a vacuum Isp of 239 seconds.\n\nThe maximum delta V, optimistically assuming the maximum Isp of 239 seconds, is found via the standard rocket equation:\n\ndelta V = 9.81*Isp *ln (Mo/Mf) = 9.81*239*ln(12,500/(12500-8720)) = 9.81*239*ln(3.307) = 2,804 meters/second.\n\nLow Earth orbital velocity is about 7800 meters per second. Assuming a ground launch, you also have to factor in gravity loses and drag losses, generally around 2,000 m/sec. So to get from launch pad to orbit your vehicle needs to generate 9800 meters per seconds, plus or minus. So the standard V-2 falls short of orbital velocity by a factor of 9800/2800, or 3.5. But falling short by a factor of 3.5 in velocity means you've fallen short by a factor of 3.5 *squared* in terms of kinetic energy, or 12.25 times.\n\nNow assume that the V-2 is launched without that one-ton warhead. Now the math works out like:\n\nDelta V = 9.81*239*ln(11,500/11,500-8720)) = 3329 m/sec. Still falls short of orbital velocity by a factor of 2.94.\n\nNow let's assume that the 1 ton payload was replaced with a scaled-down V-2. The same engine performance and mass ratio, just scaled down. In this case, both stages would produce a delta V of 2800 meters per second, taking the second stage to 5600 m/sec, or 0.57 time orbital velocity. In this case, the payload of the second stage would be scaled down from the 1,000 kg of the V-2 by a factor of 1,000/12,000 => 80 kg. If you want to assume a *third* stage that makes it to orbit, it would have to generate 4,200 meters per second.\n\nOn the other hand, assume a booster *under* the V-2, such as the A-10. As previously mentioned, that booster could boost the A-9 (i.e. V-2) up to 1,200 meters/second. Assuming the A-9 was replaced with a V-2 that uses a 1,000-kg mini-V-2 for third stage, the total delta V generated is 1200+2800+2800 m/sec = 6,800 m/sec... still three full kilometers per second short of orbit.\n\nThe V-2 was not only incapable of getting to orbit on its own, it was incapable of being used as a first stage orbital booster using equivalent rocket technology. You could use improved propellants and structures and engine tech on a second stage, but that is technology that the Germans *didn't* have. And if you got to the bother of developing that improved technology, why would you use a V-2?\n\nVladimir\n\nI really should change my personal text\n\nJoined\n\n22 September 2015\n\nMessages\n\n321\n\nReaction score\n\n44\n\n28 December 2015\n\n#37\n\nXP67_Moonbat said:\n\nI'll share my Christmas vodka with you!\n\n;D\n\nVladimir\n\nI really should change my personal text\n\nJoined\n\n22 September 2015\n\nMessages\n\n321\n\nReaction score\n\n44\n\n28 December 2015\n\n#38\n\nOrionblamblam said:\n\nIn what will undoubtedly be a vain and useless attempt at putting some of the mythology to bed, here's some math:\n\nThe A-4 rocket had a liftoff weight of about 12,500 kg.

And if you got to the bother of developing that improved technology, why would you use a V-2?\n\nUsing a V-2 as *any* sort of stage for an orbital vehicle is basically insane; the performance simply wasn't there. Von Braun claimed *after* the war that the A-11 could pull it off... but he was almost certainly blowing sunshine up the US Army's ass in order to secure a position for himself. Note that even though he was put in charge of the Army's satellite program, nobody has *ever* produced anything to suggest that he wanted to use a modified V-2 as an orbital stage. The closest he came was the Redstone, which was *greatly* advanced from the V-2, and even then he only suggested it's use as a booster for *very* small satellites.\n\nThe closest he came to suggesting V-2-A9/A10-legacy rockets for space was his Colliers \"Ferry Rocket.\" Which was almost entirely engineering fantasy. Nobody in industry - including himself - took the Ferry Rocket at all seriously.\n\nBut mayby some Oberth or Sanger concepts possible would used for that purposes...\n\nNope. Neither of them had any practical engineering designs for orbit-capable vehicles. The closest was Sangers \"Silbervogel,\" which would not have even come close to working.\n\nThe work done by the Germans during WWII showed that the technology for orbit was possible. But everyone involved knew that the technology then available was far too primitive to pull it off. As far as actually designing successful orbital vehicles, the Americans of 1947, with HATV and WCSS, were far closer than the Germans of two years before. Had not von Braun proven himself to be a world master of self promotion, the native American space efforts might have proceeded, leading to earlier, more capable and *better* space launch."
