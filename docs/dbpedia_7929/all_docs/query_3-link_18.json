        "text": "Berlin TV tower is the tallest structure in Europe, and can be seen from every place in Berlin. During the Cold-War period, East German authorities set up this tower to show how great their communist world is.\n\nAfter the collapse of Hitler's Germany, the country was divided into two, and the entire city of Berlin was within the territory of East Germany. However, Berlin was also divided into two.\n\nThus, the citizens of West Berlin were able to enjoy Western life-style. This created migrations of Berliners to West Berlin. In order to prevent this, East German authorities had to show how superior their system is. This is the reason why they refurbished the Alexanderplatz and set up the TV antenna to show off and to send strong TV signals.\n\nTheir efforts did not work. This is the reason why Soviet authorities in 1961 decided to isolate West Berlin by building traffic barriers around West Berlin. This resulted in the tragic comedy called the Berlin Wall.\n\nClick here for more about divided Berlin and the unification in 1990. The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.\n\nAs soon as you enter the main hall, you will see the marvel wall with what Karl Marx said about philosophers. Marx says the same thing in English on his tombstone at the Highgate Cemetery in London. He says\n\nThe philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. The point however is to change it.\n\nMarx talks about the philosophers. If you are not a philosopher, what does he tell you? He tells you\n\nIt is not enough for you to interpret this world. You have to change it.\n\nWas Einstein a philosopher? Yes or No, depending on your subjective point of view. In either case, he changed the world. Click here for a story."
