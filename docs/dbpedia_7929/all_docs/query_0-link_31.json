        "text": "Outstanding Graduating Senior 2023\n\nCongratulations to this year's European Studies Outstanding Graduating Senior, Sama Kenda Aziz, and Most Influential Faculty, Dr. Felicitas Jaima!\n\n\"My time spent studying German at SDSU was incredibly insightful and helped me refine my language and cultural skills even more than the time I lived in Germany. Some of the most interesting classes I took during my studies were the German ones, and they've helped me develop a strong understanding of what it means to really become fluent in a foreign language. This Fall I will be getting my master's degree in economics from Peking University in China, with plans to work on research and continue on the international studies track.\"\n\n-Sama Aziz\n\nStudents Participate in Foreign Affairs Competition in Washington, D.C.\n\nStudents from the Department of European Studies were among 30 collegiate teams from across the U.S. that participated in the 2023 Schuman Challenge on March 30-31. The annual competition invites teams of three-four undergraduate students to respond to a topic impacting transatlantic relations and present before a panel of judges.\n\nThe SDSU team featured students Ilias Benbatoul, Marek Fialkiewicz, and Hadil Salih and faculty mentors Kristin Rebien and Kylie Sago. The students entered the competition with a proposal to establish an EU-U.S. Committee on Indigenous Land Stewardship. The committee would amplify the voices of Indigenous peoples in Northern Europe and the U.S. by including their expertise in biodiversity protection. Their proposal grew from a class project for EUROP 301, Contemporary Europe.\n\nThe team presented their proposal to three judges, including a high-ranking official of the EU Delegation to the U.S., a member of the European Parliament, and a diplomat at the U.S. embassy in Finland. The judges praised their presentation for filling a gap in current transatlantic cooperation, foregrounding fundamental human needs, and clarity of their production.\n\nIlias Benbatoul, Hadil Salih, and Marek Fialkiewicz outside the competition.\n\nIlias Benbatoul, Marek Fialkiewicz, Hadil Salih, and faculty mentor, Kylie Sago\n\nMarek Fialkiewicz, Hadil Salih, and Ilias Benbatoul\n\nNew book by Emily Schuckman Matthews Examines Archetypal Characters in Russian Culture\n\nWith characters like Sonia Marmeladov from “Crime and Punishment,” the appearance of prostitutes for more than 100 years in popular Russian literature and media is expected.\n\nDespite sex workers appearing so often in Russian fiction, few scholars have closely examined what these archetypal characters represent in Russian culture and how that compares to the reality in modern life.\n\nEmily Schuckman Matthews authored a new book on the subject, “Sex Work in Contemporary Russia: A Cultural Perspective,” published by Lexington Books. Shuckman Matthews is an associate professor of European Studies and the European Studies program director at San Diego State University.\n\nRead the full story on the CAL website.\n\nSchulze Appointed Co-Editor\n\nMat Schulze, German Professor and LARC director, has been appointed co-editor of Teaching German, one of the most prestigious German journals in the US. The journal’s central focus is teaching and pedagogy.\n\nCongratulations Mat!\n\nRecent Graduate Finds Language Learning Unlocks the Door to a Whole New World\n\nWith her sights set on a future career in optometry, biology student finds value in adding foreign language study to her skills set\n\nDiva Zeckua Barajas understands the value in language learning. She grew up in San Diego in a household where Spanish was primarily spoken. The experience showed her how language barriers affect people as they navigate the basics like grocery shopping, traveling, and visiting a doctor.\n\nWhen she entered SDSU with a focus on sciences, she made it her mission to learn different languages to open up future possibilities and create deeper connections with non-native speakers. “Language learning has complemented my studies,” Barajas said. She graduated this year with a degree in biology along with minors in Italian studies and leadership development. She’ll begin the Doctor of Optometry program at Western University of Health Sciences in the fall.\n\nRead the full article on the CAL website.\n\nRead the Fall 2021 Newsletter\n\nWar on Ukraine 2022: Perspectives from Faculty and Students\n\nCAL faculty respond rapidly, broadly, and with compassion to help students contextualize and understand the current global crisis.\n\nBy Leslie L.J. Reilly\n\nA collective community of scholars and experts on issues of war, Russia, and the Ukraine from CAL departments of European studies, political science, and history, the Jewish studies program, the Center for Human Rights, and the Center for War and Society, give students a chance to engage in critical conversations to help them understand the impacts of the current war on Ukraine.\n\n“Let us be united in our compassion for one another,” said Dean Monica J. Casper. “And let us also do what CAL does especially well – apply our analytical skills to understanding the conditions and consequences of war.”\n\nEuropean Studies Department Takes Action\n\nDaria Shembel, Russian studies director and adviser along with European studies program director Emily Schuckman-Matthews have both restructured their syllabi in order to help students contextualize and understand this war as well as work through the wide range of emotions they are all feeling.\n\nRead the full article: SDSU NewsCenter | College of Arts and Letters\n\nEmily Schuckman-Matthews at March 9 event:\n\nRussia’s War Against Ukraine: A Historical and Contemporary Perspective\n\nDaria Shembel and Emily Schuckman-Matthews at March 9 event:\n\nRussia’s War Against Ukraine: A Historical and Contemporary Perspective\n\nProfessor Anne Donadey (French and Women’s Studies) is the 2021-22 College of Arts and Letters recipient of one of the major awards given at SDSU, the Alumni Association Award for Outstanding Faculty Contributions to the University.

There I started my academic journey at the only state university in the city at 18, and a year later I came back to California to continue my education at Grossmont College, and then at SDSU. It wasn’t until my third year at university that I finally declared Russian as my major.\n\nIt’s hard to explain where my interest for Russian culture and desire to learn Russian come from, since I don’t have a single Russian or even Russian-speaking relative to practice with, and the places where I’ve lived up until this point aren’t exactly world-renowned for their Russian-speaking diaspora. But I think that’s just the point: There really is no good explanation for it. It just happened that way.\n\nHowever, I couldn’t have picked a more motivating and fitting major to dedicate my academic career to, especially in light of recent events, when more (not less) understanding between different peoples is necessary to come to a solution that everyone can benefit from.\n\nDaria Shembel, Most Influential Faculty Member\n\nProfessor Daria Shembel is the only professor who could fit the role of Most Influential Faculty Member for me. No one else has had such an impact on my understanding of Russia, Russian culture, the language and beyond, like Dasha has, and she has supported me with her time, patience and advice throughout my whole SDSU experience. She has helped me develop the skills and knowledge that I value most dearly, and for this reason I have chosen her as my Most Influential Faculty Member. Thank you so much, Dasha!\n\nCongratulations to Danielle Cervantes Stephens, whose article “How Community and Literary Engagement Derailed Colonial Exploitation” was published in Sartre Studies International.

Some say it’s a racist nation. To others, it’s the greatest country on earth. One way of examining America’s soul is by asking how it treats its enemies. This talk explores the battles over whether to let the German people starve in the early years of U.S. occupation. But the talk places these debates over Germany in the larger context of vengeance by revisiting the internment of Japanese Americans and the atomic bombings of Japan. It asks who really supported each of these vengeful policies, and the answers will surprise you. Contrary to what we’ve been told, in each case, most Americans, and most key officials, favored mercy over revenge. But if that’s true, how, then, did those harsh policies get pushed through?\n\nVengeance is only one side of the story. Virtue is the other. This talk also examines America’s attempts to atone for its wartime acts through postwar humanitarian campaigns across Europe. Most people today have no idea that Americans once chose to go hungry to help feed their former foes. By rescuing millions of migrants, minorities, and average Europeans, the U.S. transformed its image in the eyes of the world. Yet even those actions faced a backlash. This is the story of how a handful of leaders overcame domestic resistance and mounted extraordinary efforts to save countless lives across continents. To understand the U.S., we must grapple with all the good and bad, the kindly and the cruel decisions, that produced the American century.\n\nSponsored by the Department of European Studies with CAL’s IRA funds and the Department of History.\n\nAlbertine Cinematheque at SDSU\n\n7 days, 7 films, all at 7 pm\n\nAll screenings in HH 221, except April 21 and 28 films screened in Bernstein Theatre (formerly known as the Little Theatre)\n\nAll films are free of charge and have English subtitles.\n\nApr 19: France (2021, dir. Bruno Dumont)\n\nLéa Seydoux brilliantly holds the center of Bruno Dumont’s unexpected, unsettling new film, which starts out as a satire of the contemporary news media before steadily spiraling out into something richer and darker. Never one to shy away from provoking his viewers, Dumont (The Life of Jesus, NYFF35) casts Seydoux as France de Meurs, a seemingly unflappable superstar TV journalist whose career, homelife, and psychological stability are shaken after she carelessly drives into a young delivery man on a busy Paris street. This accident triggers a series of self-reckonings, as well as a strange romance that proves impossible to shake. A film that teases at redemption while refusing to grant absolution, France is tragicomic and deliciously ambivalent—a very 21st-century treatment of the difficulty of maintaining identity in a corrosive culture.\n\nApr 20: Benedetta (2021, dir. Paul Verhoeven)\n\nDr. Joanne Ferraro, Albert W. Johnson Distinguished Professor of History Emerita, will introduce the film.\n\nVerhoeven’s sexually graphic, violent, often shocking film is based loosely on Judith Brown’s Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy (1985). Benedetta Carlini (1590–1661), an Italian nun in the Convent of the Mother of God in Pescia, claimed she experienced mystic visions. As her fame spread, she came to the attention of the Counter-Reformation papacy. That institution was seeking to control potentially troublesome mystics who showed any signs of false claims or heretical beliefs as did Benedetta. A series of investigations ensued to determine the legitimacy of her claims. Unexpectedly, when they interrogated another sister, Bartolomea, that they found that the two women had engaged in sexual relations. Benedetta was stripped of her rank as abbess and remained in the convent prison until her death.\n\nApr 21: Happening (2021, dir. Audrey Diwan)\n\nFrance, 1963, twelve years before abortion became legalized in France. Anne is a bright young student with a promising future ahead of her. But when she falls pregnant, she sees the opportunity to finish her studies and escape the constraints of her social background disappearing. With her final exams fast approaching and her belly growing, Anne resolves to act, even if she has to confront shame and pain, even if she must risk prison to do so. This powerful, harrowing film is based on Nobel prize winner Annie Ernaux’s autobiographical novel of the same name. NPR called it “timely and urgent...a film that speaks to today’s abortion debate.”\n\nApr 26: We (2021, dir. Alice Diop)\n\nThe RER B is an urban train that traverses Paris and its environs from north to south. A moving testament to the importance of filming as a process of bearing witness and remembering, We is subtle and shrewd in a world which favors shortcuts and easy answers. Justifiably adopting the fragmented structure of a patchwork portrait to describe a riven society, Diop displays impressive control of her essay and its impact. In the film’s first few minutes, a deer is observed, through binoculars. Isolation, discrimination, and nostalgia for hierarchies, inherited from a monarchical past... Divisions haunt France’s present. But the human urge to give as well as to receive stubbornly creeps into every situation, observed or triggered. Could this be the one thing that still keeps a nation together?\n\nApr 27: Gagarine (2021, dirs. Fanny Liatard & Jérémy Trouilh)\n\nYouri, 16, has lived all his life in Gagarine Cité, a vast red brick housing project on the outskirts of Paris. From the heights of his apartment, he dreams of becoming an astronaut. But when plans to demolish his community’s home are leaked,Youri joins the resistance. With his friends Diana and Houssam, he embarks on a mission to save Gagarine, transforming the estate into his own “starship”–before it disappears into space forever. The film was shot on the cusp of the actual demolition of the Cité Gagarine housing project in collaboration with its residents in Ivry-sur-Seine.\n\nApr 28: Saint Omer (2022, dir. Alice Diop)\n\nTechnically, Saint Omer could be classified as a courtroom drama, but hardly in the traditional sense. Rather than offering manipulated, melodramatic reversals, this intense, stately work has the ring of classical tragedy – closer to Racine than 12 Angry Men. Named after the French town where it is set, Saint Omer is inspired by the 2016 trial of Fabienne Kabou, a young woman originally from Senegal, charged with killing her baby daughter by leaving her on a beach. Diop attended the trial, fascinated after reading about Kabou. “I went there under the magnetic pull of an obsession that for a long time I couldn’t put into words. There was this psychoanalytic and mythical dimension underlying the way she explained her actions. She said: ‘I laid her on the sand, thinking the sea would carry her body away.’ That put the horror of the crime to one side: I was hearing something else. I found myself making up a story more beautiful, perhaps more acceptable than the real one, about a woman offering her child to a sea which could care for her.”\n\nMay 3: Last Year at Marienbad (1961, dir. Alain Resnais)\n\nNot just a defining work of the French New Wave but one of the great, lasting mysteries of modern art, Alain Resnais’ epochal Last Year at Marienbad (L’année dernière à Marienbad) has been puzzling appreciative viewers for decades. Written by radical master of the New Novel Alain Robbe-Grillet, this surreal fever dream, or nightmare, gorgeously fuses the past with the present in telling its ambiguous tale of a man and a woman (Giorgio Albertazzi and Delphine Seyrig) who may or may not have met a year ago, perhaps at the very same cathedral- like, mirror-filled château they now find themselves wandering. Unforgettable in both its confounding details (gilded ceilings, diabolical parlor games, a loaded gun) and haunting scope, Resnais’ investigation into the nature of memory is disturbing, romantic, and maybe even a ghost story.\n\nWant more info?

Starting from key feminist texts from the 1970s, the presentation will move into more recent iterations of the so-called pensiero della differenza [philosophy of difference] that have critically reengaged with and redefined both Marxist theories of social reproduction and symbolic practices of female intersubjectivity. The discussion will consider the impact that local and international antiracist and intersectional feminisms have had in redefining white feminist imaginaries and stimulating the creation of a broader and more inclusive feminist struggle in Italy.\n\nLoredana Di Martino is Professor of Italian Studies at the University of San Diego. Her current research focuses on the intersections between Italian literature, gender studies, and postcolonial and transnational studies. She investigates the relationship between contemporary storytelling and feminist and anti-racist activism as well as transnational feminist practices in Italy. Her most recent articles focus on Elena Ferrante’s feminist philosophy, and the recent decolonial turn in Italian feminism. She is working on a book project on contemporary transnational and intersectional articulations of the so-called Italian philosophy of difference. Her publications include peer-reviewed articles, book chapters and encyclopedia entries in addition to the co-edited volume Encounters with the Real in Contemporary Italian Literature and Cinema (2017) and the single-authored book Il caleidoscopio della scrittura.

Narrated from Olga’s perspective, the novel portrays major events in European history, including colonialism in Africa; displacement and expulsion from Eastern Europe in the 1940s; and the student movement in 1968. Alida Becker, writing in the New York Times, describes Olga as being “caught between worlds”: “A quietly determined German schoolteacher,” Olga is “a survivor of two world wars” who spends “a lifetime waiting for a lover who may never return.”\n\nBernhard Schlink’s background as a legal scholar and former constitutional court justice informs the clarity and incisiveness of his poetic language, as well as the moral questions he raises in his fiction. Professor Schlink taught law and legal philosophy at the Humboldt University in Berlin and at the Benjamin N. Cardoza School of Law in New York City. In addition to his scholarly writings, he has authored over ten novels and short story collections, beginning with the 1987 co-authored crime novel \"Selbs Justiz,\" translated into English as \"Self’s Punishment.\" He is best known for his 1995 novel \"The Reader,\" a story of love and secrets, horror and compassion, unfolding against the haunted landscape of postwar Germany. It became the first German novel to reach #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. The 2008 film adaptation, directed by Stephen Daldry, was nominated for five Academy Awards and starred Ralph Fiennes and Kate Winslet, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nThe event is co-sponsored by the Departments of European Studies and English and Comparative Literature and received funding from IRA, the Center for European Studies, Humanities in Action, CAL’s Dean’s Office, and Adventures by the Book.\n\nImagine Europe\n\nEmbarRACEments: African Diaspora and Afrophobia in Italy\n\nThursday, September 29, 2022\n\n12:30-1:45 p.m.\n\nDonald P. Shiley BioScience Center, Gold Auditorium, SDSU\n\nWhile Italians supported the Black Lives Matter movement that was born in the United States, many remain blind to the rampant racism in their own society. In Italy there is excessive fear and great aversion to Africans, a condition which the UN and EU refer to as “Afrophobia.” This is a systemic, endemic phenomenon with multiple origins that contributes to a negative representation and perception of Africa. This view is at the root of racism in Italy, a racism that often expresses itself in the banality of people’s everyday language, micro-aggressions, and hypersexualized approaches toward women.\n\nThis presentation includes readings from Kossi Komla-Ebri’s two volumes of personal, ironically humorous anecdotes, translated in English as EmbarRACEments: Daily Embarrassments in Black and White . . . and Color (2019), focusing on issues of inclusivity, racism, and cultural conflict. EmbarRACEments tells the embarrassment of difference, the discomfort related to the Other, the culturally different, and, especially, the visibly different.\n\nKossi A. Komla-Ebri, born in Togo, is a medical surgeon and award-winning writer who lives near Como, Italy. His publications include Neyla (2002, 2019), translated and published in the USA, his volumes of anecdotes, Imbarazzismi, and Nuovi Imbarazzismi, translated into English (EmbarRACEments 2019), French (Embarracismes-Le racisme au quotidien, 2016) and Arabic (2021). He has recently published two books of fables, Gente udite la mia favola and Le due lezioni (2022), and a collection of short stories Avant que tombe la nuit (2021). The English translation of eleven short stories was published as Home by Bordighera Press in 2022.\n\nHe has been invited to speak at numerous conferences in Italy and internationally and has presented at university courses on issues related to Africa, black Italy, integration, interculturalism and migration literature.\n\nSponsored by the the Department of European Studies, the Center for European Studies, the Italian Program and the Department of Africana Studies with CAL's IRA funds.\n\nOn Marginalization and the Limits of European Belonging\n\nwith Dr. Sunnie Rucker-Chang\n\nTuesday, Sept. 27th, 9:30-10:45am\n\nTemplo Mayor, SDSU, Aztec Student Union, Level 2\n\nIn this presentation Dr. Rucker-Chang will challenge the seemingly inclusive nature of “Europe” and “European” while recognizing these concepts as limited and inflexible. She will do so by discussing how articulations and expressions of “Europeanism” exclude marginalized communities and geographical peripheries on the European continent. The conversation will center on contemporary constructions non-EU, post-conflict, Southeast European countries, with an emphasis on Serbia, and negatively racialized populations that are regularly defined by way of their difference and distance from the majorities of their countries of residence.\n\nSunnie Rucker-Chang is an Associate Professor in the Slavic and East European Languages and Cultures and African American and African Studies departments at the Ohio State University.

Originally from Moscow, Russia, he is well known far beyond the Southern California scene, where he regularly performs with his band or solo unplugged. Alex’s music fuses the gloom yet self-irony and raunchiness of blues, the drive, and madcapping of rock-n-roll, the pure emotion of Latin rhythms. His lyrics are deeply metaphorical and filled with wordplay and symbolism, yet follow the best traditions of Russian poetic heritage. His musical influences encompass a wide range of seemingly eclectic sources: from the early 20th-century Russian chansonnier Alexander Vertinsky to legendary Russian rock bands Aquarium and Auktyon, from Paul Simon to Tom Waits.\n\nMany outstanding musicians have played and currently play in Alex Kiskachi's band.

Florvil\n\nBlack German Women and Intellectual Activism\n\nThursday, March 10 | 12:30-1:45 pm\n\nLocation: Peterson Gym 153\n\nIn 1985, Black German men and women united and created a diasporic movement that connected people from across the nation. But Black women were key figures in the movement who helped to determine its cultural, political, and intellectual contours. Specifically, Dr. Florvil examines May Ayim and Ricky Reiser as examples of what she has coined “quotidian intellectuals,” intellectuals who stress the everyday in form and content. These two women, she argues, decolonized German knowledge in ways that made the Black diaspora and Black Germanness legible. Through their intellectual work, these Black German women also made significant epistemic interventions that allowed them to write themselves into German and diasporic history.\n\nTiffany N. Florvil is an Associate Professor of 20th-century European Women’s and Gender History at the University of New Mexico. She specializes in the histories of post-1945 Europe, the African diaspora, Black internationalism, as well as gender and sexuality.

Its destination is Cuba. There are 937 Jews on board, fleeing the growing Nazi threat. The German captain, Gustav Schröder, is forced to steam back to Europe, after both Cuba and the United States governments refuse to help the passengers. Hopes are raised for placement with the host nations of Belgium, Great Britain, Holland, and France. As Nazi Germany prepares to invade Europe, the epilogue is a devastating one for many aboard the St. Louis.

She’s also the co-curator and cohost of the Virtual Salons: Discourses on Black Italia webinar series at NYU’s Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marimò. Whitney received her bachelor of arts in anthropology and Italian from Mount Holyoke College.\n\nBarbara Ofosu-Somuah is a researcher, writer, and emerging Italian-to-English translator, from Accra, Ghana, and the Bronx, New York. As a translator, she attempts to bring the works of contemporary Afro-Italian writers to English-speaking audiences. She has received both Thomas J.

He spent his sophomore year in Germany, studying German through the CSU International Program in Tübingen and taking mechanical engineering classes in German at Ulm University of Applied Sciences in his second semester. He earned straight As in all his German classes, writing papers and giving presentations, in German, on topics ranging from Goethe’s Werther to the European Union. He has worked as a teaching assistant in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, a research assistant in the SDSU’s microelectromechanical systems lab, and as a preschool teacher during his time in Germany. Additionally, he has been involved in many student organizations on campus, including Mortar Board, the Global Aztec Alliance, the College of Sciences Student Council, and oSTEM at SDSU. Following graduation, Christopher will pursue a Masters in Chemical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada.\n\nMost Influential Faculty Member\n\nDr. Kristin Rebien has been my professor for every German course I have taken since my return from my study abroad in Germany, and she has been instrumental in shaping my relationship with the language I’ve learned and the cultural I’ve come to know. Through her classes, I have been able to explore the history and future of Germany, and in parallel to that, the growth of the European Union and supranational bodies all over the world. Not only do I feel monumentally more confident in my German language abilities, I also feel more informed and engaged with Germany and the European Union as they are now. Under her guidance, I have become more active in trying to understand the political and cultural landscapes around me, and I know that I am a better global citizen because of it.\n\nFaculty Bio\n\nKristin Rebien is an Associate Professor of German and European Studies and the Director of the German Program at SDSU. She holds M.A. degrees in German and Political Science from the University of Leipzig, Germany, and a Ph.D. in German Studies from Stanford. Her research focuses on the interface between literature and politics, philosophy, and the visual arts in the twentieth and twenty-first century German culture. She joined the SDSU faculty in 2006.\n\nLisette Kelly, Outstanding Graduating Senior in Comparative International Studies\n\nI grew up in a small mountain town in Southern California. I come from a big, French Basque family. My culture is very important to me and there is nothing I value more than my family. Being second generation, my appreciation for my culture has sparked an empathy in me for the rest of the world. I love history, political science, and any discipline that enlightens why humanity is the way it is. I am a transfer student from SDCCD and chose SDSU because it had been my dream since I first visited the campus at 16 years old. I hope to be able to use the knowledge I have accrued at SDSU to make the world a better place.\n\nMost Influential Faculty Member\n\nI chose professor Schorr as my most influential faculty member because he made me realize that perfecting and continuing to use my French is one of my main priorities. He is extremely lively in the classroom and makes the material easy to relate to and remember. Above all, he has inspired me to continue my French and worked actively to show me ways to make that happen.\n\nFaculty Bio\n\nJames L. Schorr is an Emeritus Professor of French. His research interests include the Enlightenment and a number of 18th century writers, especially the works of Justus van Effen.\n\nThis has been a year of exciting upcoming changes for the department.
