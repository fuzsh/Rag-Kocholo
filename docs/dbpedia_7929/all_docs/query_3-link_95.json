Early in his scientific career, beginning in 1890, he worked as assistant to Heinrich Hertz, and contributed to Hertz' work on electromagnetic resonance. This work eventually led to the development of radio.\n\nBjerknes is an important figure in 20th century meteorology: he introduced many of the common techniques and ideas used by modern meteorologists and weather forecasters. He was one of the originators of the Bergen classical school of thought in meteorology (also referred to at times as the Norwegian school). In the Bergen model, fronts are considered to be the sloping boundaries between cold and warm airmasses. They therefore have a three-dimensional structure, which was a new idea at the time.\n\nBjerknes was also a professor of meteorology, and published papers and books on dynamic meteorology and hydrodynamics. For example, in the paper On the Dynamic Principle of Circulatory Movements in the Atmosphere (Monthly Weather Review, October 1900), Bjerknes applied fundamental theorems in fluid motion by Helmholtz, Kelvin and Silberstein, along with others of his own discovery, to atmospheric circulation. This was one of the first papers to study dynamic meteorology in its modern framework.\n\nIn 1917, Bjerknes founded the Geophysical Institute of Bergen, with the goal of improving the country's meteorological forecast service. He established a large network of observing stations, mostly in southern Norway, that followed what was known as the \"indirect\" reporting method, in which detailed cloud observations were made in an attempt to compensate for the lack of upper-level sounding information (Bjerknes knew that information from upper levels was as important as information from the surface, but the modern radiosonde network had not yet been established). Starting in 1918, Bjerknes made analyses of his synoptic (i.e. large scale) weather maps, in which he integrated the available observations over large areas into complete meteorological patterns that included smaller scale features such as cold and warm fronts and their associated circulations. From his analyses, Bjerknes built a model of the cycle of the birth, development and decay of mid-latitude low pressure systems and their associated fronts. This was useful because the model could then be applied to observed patterns in order to forecast the evolution of the weather. This work was the foundation of what came to be known as the Bergen School of Meteorology. This idea still lies at the heart of the modern practice of weather forecasting.\n\nWhile at the Institute, Bjerknes wrote his book On the Dynamics of the Circular Vortex with Applications to the Atmosphere and to Atmospheric Vortex and Wave Motion. It was published in 1921.\n\nFor more information about Vilhelm Bjerknes, as well as about his son Jacob who was also a meteorologist, see this document.\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content Norway403 (Mi466)1962100th anniv. birth \"Vilhelm Bjerknes\" Norway404 (Mi467)Norway403-404 fdc1Two stamps and (orange and blue printed)cachet on FDC Norway403-404 fdc2Two stamps and (Norsk Filatelistisk Tidsskrift) cachet on FDC Norway403-404 fdc3Two stamps and (gold and blue and grey printed) cachet on FDC Norway403-404 fdc4Two stamps and (Populaer Filateli no.74) cachet on FDC Norway403-404 fdc5Two stamps on FDC (blank/no cachet) Norway404 cardInformation card\n\nEckener, Hugo\n\n(1868–1954)\n\nHugo Eckener was the commander of the German airship Graf Zeppelin.\n\nIn 1926 Fridtjof Nansen founded the International Association for Exploring the Arctic by Means of Airship (commonly known as \"Aeroarctic\"). According to its statement of purpose, Aeroarctic would support \"the scientific investigation and permanent control of the Arctic by means of explorations (voyages) and by the disembarking and support of wireless stations\". To this end, in 1928 Nansen discussed with Eckener the idea that Aeroarctic might sponsor the Graf Zeppelin in an Arctic mission. Through Eckener's knowledge of airships and Nansen's knowledge of weather, the two agreed that such a voyage would be feasible. Nansen wrote that \"it may be understood that the object of the expedition with the Graf Zeppelin ... is not merely to fly across the North Polar region and to take a few accidental observations, but it is an important link in a great scientific programme, and will give results of importance to science\". He expected that such a scientific program would provide information useful in weather forecasting, agriculture, shipping, trade and air traffic, but unfortunately died before it could take place.\n\nThe Aeroarctic/Graf Zeppelin Arctic expedition took place in 1931 with Eckener in command. The trip was a success on all fronts. A large amount of information was gathered related to meteorology, terrestrial magnetism and oceanography. Weather records were kept throughout the trip and meteorological isobaric maps were constructed three times per day. Molchanov sounding balloons were successfully launched from the airship near Franz Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya and Vaigach Island. These balloons carried small radio transmitters that relayed measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity back to the airship.\n\nEckener would later write of the voyage that \"my expectations, in so far as they were surpassed, were realized when I saw that, respecting the Arctic in summer, no anxieties need be felt regarding meteorological disturbances. Temperatures in the upper air regions are such that fears that an ice cap can be formed on the ship can be avoided by proper navigation\".\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content Antigua and Barbuda1632 (Mi1701)1992(125th anniv. birth, in 1993) Antigua and Barbuda1711 (Mi1850)1993125th anniv. birth \"Dr. Hugo Eckener\" Antigua and Barbuda1712 (Mi1851)Antigua and Barbuda1716 (Mi1852)Antigua and Barbuda1718 (BL265, Mi1853)\n\ni1718SS1\n\nImperforate SS1 Azerbaijan513 (BL?)SS11995(40th anniv. death, in 1994) Barbuda1440 (Mi1573)Antigua and Barbuda 1711 overprinted \"Barbuda Mail\"1994125th anniv. birth (in 1993) \"Dr. Hugo Eckener\" Barbuda1441 (Mi1574)Antigua and Barbuda 1712 overprinted \"Barbuda Mail\" Barbuda1445 (Mi1575)Antigua and Barbuda 1716 overprinted \"Barbuda Mail\" Barbuda1447 (BL226, Mi1576)SS1 (stamp), Antigua and Barbuda 1718 overprinted \"Barbuda Mail\" Bequia (St. Vincent Grenadines)400c (Mi?)One of MS3 (400 (a-c))2007\"Dr. Hugo Eckener\" Dominica1568 (Mi1705)1993125th anniv. birth Dominica1570 (Mi1706)Dominica1573 (Mi1707)Dominica1576 (BL239)SS1 Dominica1576 fdcSS1 on FDC Gambia1380 (Mi?)1993125th anniv. birth Gambia1382 (Mi?)Gambia1383 (Mi?)Gambia1387 (BL?)SS1 GermanyNonePostcard back~1906\"Dr. Hugo Eckener\" GermanyNoneCancel on cover1925 GermanyNonePostcard back, also front1926 GermanyNoneCinderella (5pf, green)~1926Zeppelin fundraising campaign GermanyNoneCinderella (5pf, blue) GermanyNoneCinderella (10pf, red) GermanyNonePostcard, also back1932 GermanyNonePostcard back1936 GermanyNoneCommemorative card, also back1938 Germany (West)825 card (Mi? card)Cachet on card1968100th anniv. birth \"Dr. Hugo Eckener\" Germany (West)NoneCancel on cover1968100th anniv. birth Germany (West)None(Pictorial) cancel on postcard, also back1968100th anniv. birth Germany (West)NoneCachet on cover1976 Germany (West)NoneCachet on cover1978 GermanyNoneCancel on postal card1993(125th anniv. birth) Ghana1551A (Mi?)1993125th anniv. birth Ghana1553 (Mi?)Ghana1560 (Mi?)Ghana1562 (BL?)SS1 Grenada1794 (Mi?)1990\"Dr. Hugo Eckener\" (at left) Grenada2272 (Mi?)1993125th anniv. birth \"Dr. Hugo Eckener\" Grenada2273 (Mi?)Grenada2274 (Mi?)Grenada2275 (BL?)SS1 HungaryC390 (Mi3235)1977(110th anniv. birth, in 1978) Lesotho940 (Mi?)1993(125th anniv. birth) Malagasy RepublicC160 (BL?)In (right) margin of SS11976Eckener (rightmost of the three men) Mauritania346 (Mi540)\n\ni346\n\nImperforate1976\"Dr. Hugo Eckener\" Nicaragua1989a (Mi?)From MS16 (1989 (a-i))1994(125th anniv. birth, in 1993) Nicaragua1989e (Mi?)

Ben Nevis is the highest point in Scotland, and the observatory was at the summit. Wilson found the glories (philatelic examples 1 and 2) and coronas (philatelic examples 1 and 2) in the clouds and mists of the mountain particularly beautiful and was inspired to study them. Glories and coronas are two types of atmospheric optical phenomena. Furthermore, the thunderstorms that Wilson experienced may have been the seeds of his later interest in atmospheric electricity.\n\nThe Cloud Chamber\n\nWilson worked from 1895 to 1900 as a researcher at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. His starting point was the work of John Aitken (1839–1919), a Scottish atmospheric physicist who cooled a sample of air in an expansion chamber to cause condensation and showed that the resulting water droplets formed on small atmospheric particles such as dust. Such particles are now known as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Wilson developed an updated expansion chamber that came to be called the \"cloud chamber\" and used it to show that water droplets would also form in pure air (with no dust) if it was cooled enough to attain a very high humidity. He noticed that such droplets reacted to an electric field and hypothesized that the nuclei on which they had formed must therefore be ions (charged particles). Wilson then passed X-rays (discovered late in 1895) through the cloud chamber and found a resulting large increase in the number of cloud droplets. This experiment confirmed his hypothesis, since other researchers had established that the passage of X-rays through air makes it electrically conductive, and furthermore that air conductivity was due to the presence of ions.\n\nWilson demonstrated the cloud chamber to some other interested scientists in the late 1890s, including Kelvin, who had previously made some measurements of the atmospheric electrical field.\n\nWilson had some hopes of using his cloud chamber results as a basis for linking the behaviour of ions with the formation of clouds in the real atmosphere. In this he was unsuccessful. Such a link may not even be possible, since the conditions in the cloud chamber differ greatly from those in the real atmosphere.\n\nIn 1911, Wilson was the first to observe and photograph the tracks of alpha- and beta-particles and electrons in the cloud chamber. He described them as \"little wisps and threads of clouds\". The cloud chamber later provided other discoveries in the field of nuclear physics. As a result, Wilson, together with Arthur Compton, received the 1927 Nobel Prize for Physics. Wilson was cited for the invention of the cloud chamber, which the Nobel committee described as being at the heart of \"his method of making the paths of electrically charged particles visible by the condensation of vapour\".\n\nAtmospheric Electricity\n\nWilson's interest in atmospheric electricity grew in the late 1890s. Then in 1900 he was asked by the Meteorological Council of the Royal Society to do some scientific work on the subject. To start, he made observations of the atmospheric electric field in 1900 and 1901 in Peebles, Scotland, where he used captive balloons and kites to measure the electric field strength at various heights, and also made improvements to the Kelvin electrograph technique. Within a few years he had constructed an instrument to measure the atmospheric electric potential gradient and the vertical flow of current in fair weather. Those measurements allowed him to calculate the electrical conductivity of the air. Of this work Wilson would reminisce, in an article published posthumously in 1960:\n\n\"I remember the satisfaction I had when my work led to the fulfilment of my dream of isolating a portion of the Earth's surface and measuring the charge upon it and the current flowing into it from the atmosphere\".\n\nHis instrument, later called the \"Wilson apparatus\" by the Meteorological Office, became a standard for measurements of atmospheric electricity. Instruments with the same basic design were used at the Kew Observatory until 1979. Interestingly, data from the Wilson apparatus has also been used to reconstruct historic air pollution data in England.\n\nSince atmospheric conductivity is almost exclusively due to the presence of ions, Wilson's measurements of electrical conductivity allowed him to calculate the concentration of those ions. He was also able to examine them in the cloud chamber. He published papers describing the cloud chamber and its uses in 1911 and 1912. In subsequent years he continued to make observations of atmospheric electricity and worked on droplet charging, thunderstorm electrification and the development of a capillary electrometer. In 1913 he was appointed Observer in Meteorological Physics at the Cambridge Solar Physics Observatory, where he carried out in particular work on thunderstorm electricity. In 1918 he was appointed Reader in Electrical Meteorology at the Cavendish Laboratory, and he was the Jacksonian Professor at Cambridge from 1925 until his retirement in 1935.\n\nIn the years after WWI, Wilson turned to the question of why the Earth's surface should retain an overall negative charge despite the observed electrical gradient (positive charge in the atmosphere, negative at the surface) which at first glance should neutralize the surface negative charge. It was known that there were electrical discharges associated with thunderstorms, and this led to the suggestion that lightning might be the replenishing agent of the surface negative charge. Wilson's cloud chamber experiments suggested another mechanism: they showed that if the CCN on which cloud droplets formed were negatively charged, more vapour would condense onto them than if they were positively charged. He therefore suggested that raindrops descending to the ground in thunderstorm areas (or possibly in other areas of unsettled weather with rain) were negatively charged, so that lightning and raindrops together could act to continuously replenish the observed surface negative charge in the presence of the overall atmospheric positive charge. To complete the picture, it was necessary to postulate that a vertical charge separation occurs in thunderstorms: negative at the base and positive at the top. The high level positive charge could migrate upward to a conducting layer (the ionosphere) which then would transfer it to all the remaining areas without thunderstorms, thus maintaining the observed electrical structure of the atmosphere and the surface. This theory has come to be known as the global atmospheric electrical circuit, and current flowing in the circuit is referred to as the Wilson current. Even today all the details have not been worked out, but the general theory is well-accepted. Wilson published these ideas in various papers including those of 1921, 1929 and 1956.\n\nReferences (some scientific papers by Wilson):\n\nWilson, C.T.R., 1899: On the condensation nuclei produced in gases by the action of Rontgen rays, uranium rays, ultraviolet light and other agents, Phil.

Like Wegener, du Toit realized that historical climate change could be explained if the continents had drifted from one climatic zone to another, and furthermore that a rearrangement of the Earth's continents and oceans could act to change climate patterns.\n\nIn his 1937 work Our Wandering Continents: A Hypothesis of Continental Drifting, du Toit expressed these climate-related ideas: he stated that different continents could show \"in their fossil remains common or allied forms of terrestrial life, possessed during certain epochs of climates that may have ranged from glacial to torrid or pluvial to arid, though contrary to meteorological principles when their existing geographic positions are considered\".\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content British Antarctic Territory86-91 fdc (Mi88-93 fdc)Insert back from FDC, also insert front and cover front1982\"Dr. Alex du Toit\" South Africa813 (Mi828)1991du Toit and maps of early continents South Africa813 maxiStamp and cancel and cachet on maxicard South Africa810-813 fdcOne of four stamps on FDC\n\nSimpson, Sir George Clarke\n\n(1878–1965)\n\nSimpson was an English meteorologist. He studied atmospheric electricity in Lapland in 1902 and was appointed meteorological lecturer at Manchester University in 1905. He became the Imperial Meteorologist for the Indian Meteorological Service in 1906, where his responsibilities included inspecting meteorological observing stations in India and Burma. In 1910 he joined Robert Scott's second Antarctic expedition (the British Antarctic Expedition) as expedition meteorologist. He served aboard the ship Terra Nova as it made its way to Antarctica. In Antarctica, he was responsible for one of the continent's first weather observing stations, at the Cape Evans base camp. A knoll just behind the Cape Evans hut, 66 feet above sea level, was named Wind Vane Hill. A run-of-the-wind anemometer and a Stevenson screen were set up on the knoll. Electric wires connected the anemometer cups to a recorder in the hut. The cup rotations were electrically counted; with every four miles of wind a signal sent to the hut caused a pen on a chronograph to register a step. The screen was visited (generally by Simpson) at 0800 each morning, in all weather, and the thermometers (maximum, minimum and present) were read. BAT Scott 432b shows Simpson standing in front of the screen and recording those temperatures. Furthermore, Simpson made the first Antarctic upper-air measurements using instrumented balloons. This document describes in some detail those measurements. This stamp shows expedition members, including Simpson, launching a weather balloon. Simpson also studied the local meteorological effects of the area. For example, he established that Minna Bluff acts to divide the airflow into two separate currents, which results in the cold and foggy \"windless bight\" area on the south coast of Ross Island.\n\nSimpson returned to the Indian Meteorological Service early in 1912. There he compiled his notes about Antarctic meteorology. In 1919 he published the first volume of the expedition's meteorological records, entitled British Antarctic Expedition 1910-1913. Meteorology. Two other volumes followed.\n\nSimpson was drafted into WWI military service and served in 1916 as meteorological advisor to the British Expeditionary Force in Mesopotamia. In 1920 he became the Director of the British Meteorological Office in London, where he conducted research into atmospheric electricity, ionization, lightning, radioactivity and solar radiation. In 1926 he established a wind force scale known as the Simpson scale, a modification of the Beaufort wind force scale.\n\nSimpson retired from the Meteorological Office in 1938 but was recalled into active service in 1939 because of WWII. He was appointed head of the Kew Observatory, where he continued to study the electrical structure of thunderstorms until 1947.

His general ideas about this question followed those of the Scot James Croll, who in 1864 had published a paper in the Philosophical Magazine that hypothesized that variations in the Earth's orbit might have caused the ice ages.\n\nIn the WWI years Milanković studied the interactions between solar radiation and the temperature of the Earth. His results were published in Paris in 1920 in a monograph entitled Théorie mathématique des phénomènes thermiques produits par la radiation solaire (Mathematical theory of thermal phenomena caused by solar radiation). In it, he presented a curve describing the solar insolation at the Earth's surface. Köppen and Wegener used it in their 1924 work Klimate der geologischen Vorzeit (Climates of the Geological Past). In 1927 they invited Milanković to collaborate with them on their Handbuch der Klimatologie (Handbook on Climatology). He wrote the introduction to the Handbook: Mathematische Klimalehre und astronomische Theorie der Klimaschwankungen (Mathematical science of climate and astronomical theory of the variations of the climate). The ideas contained therein would form the basis of a theory that he formulated in the 1930s. That theory, which came to be known by the name of \"Milanković cycles\", presents a relationship between long-term cycles in the Earth's climate and changes in its orbital eccentricity, axial tilt and precession. The precession changes slightly in an approximate 26,000 year cycle. The Earth's orbit about the Sun changes in 100,000 year and 400,000 year cycles. The tilt of the Earth's axis changes in a cycle of about 41,000 years. Milanković derived the mathematical formulas that describe these cycles and showed how they can interact so that at some times there is more sunlight striking the Earth, and at others there is less. When there is less, snow and ice can accumulate and glaciers can advance, forming an Ice Age. When there is more, there is warming and the ice retreats. Milanković presented the complete theory in his 1941 work Kanon der Erdbestrahlung und seine Anwendung auf das Eiszeitenproblem (A Study of Insolation reaching the Earth and its Application to the Problem of the Ice Ages).\n\nThe theory of Milanković cycles remained controversial, but a paper published in the journal Science in 1976 (\"Variations in the Earth's orbit: pacemaker of the Ice Ages\" by Hayes, Imbrie and Shackleton) confirmed the basic ideas. In it, measurements from deep ocean sediment cores along with new understanding of celestial mechanics were used to show that variations in solar insolation were the main cause of the advance and retreat of ice sheets in the Quaternary period. Here is the abstract of their paper.\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content Bosnia and Herzegovina (Serb Admin.)226 (Mi303)Stamp + label, from MS8 (8x single + label)2004125th anniv. birth Bosnia and Herzegovina (Serb Admin.)226 fdcStamp and cancel and cachet on FDC Serbia374 (Mi174)2007(50th anniv. death, in 2008) Serbia374 fdc1Stamp on FDC Serbia374 fdc2Stamp on FDC (different) Serbia-KrajinaMi62A\n\nMi62BFrom strip of 2 and label, or from MS8 (8x Mi62A + label)\n\nMi62B and label from imperforate MS8 (8x Mi62B + label)1996 Serbia-KrajinaMi62A fdcStamp and cancel and cachet on FDC Serbia242 (Mi319)2004125th anniv. birth Serbia242 fdcStamp and cancel and cachet on FDC Serbia242 var (Mi?)Variety, with the initials of the stamp designer printed in the stamp image SerbiaNone(Bronze) medallion, also reverse?

His research in atmospheric physics and meteorology included the studies of cloud microphysics, thermodynamics, the vertical structure of the chemical composition of the atmosphere, atmospheric optics, and European tornadoes. In addition to all that, he proposed the then-revolutionary theory of continental drift, which was a seminal contribution to the field of geophysics.\n\nWegener received a doctorate in astronomy in 1904, but found that he was more interested in geophysics, meteorology and climatology. At that time the telegraph, Atlantic cable and wireless were beginning to supply the data necessary for analysis and forecasting of storms. In 1905 he went to work at the Royal Prussian Aeronautical Observatory near Berlin, where he studied the atmosphere with kites and balloons. He was then invited to join a 1906 Danish expedition to Greenland's northeast coast. This was a dream come true for Wegener. In Greenland from 1906 to 1908 Wegener became the first person to use kites and tethered balloons to study the polar atmosphere. From 1909, he lectured on meteorology and astronomy at the University of Marberg. In 1911 he collected his meteorology lectures into a book, Thermodynamik der Atmosphäre (The Thermodynamics of the Atmosphere), which became a standard text in Germany.\n\nWegener also worked in the area of cloud and precipitation physics. As early as 1784, Benjamin Franklin had speculated that rainfall at the ground began as some form of snow in the clouds. Wegener considered that water can exist in the atmosphere in supercooled liquid form (at a temperature below 0°C), and also that the saturation vapour pressure over liquid water is greater than that over ice. He concluded that as a result, cloud ice crystals would necessarily grow at the expense of supercooled liquid cloud droplets. The resulting large ice crystals would be Franklin's 'snow', which could melt to form raindrops as it fell. These ideas were contained in Thermodynamik der Atmosphäre. Wegener never got the chance to document this process in real clouds, but Tor Bergeron and Walter Findeisen proved the theory in the 1930s. The process, often now known as the Bergeron-Findeisen process, is more correctly referred to as the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process.\n\nWegener went back to Greenland in 1912-13 and crossed the Greenland ice cap with Danish explorer J.P. Koch and two others in a trip from Dove Bay on the east coast to Upernavik on the west coast. The data that he gathered during this journey made him one of the world's leading experts on polar meteorology and glaciology. According to fellow meteorologist and Greenland explorer Dr. Johannes Georgi, \"Wegener was the first to trace storm tracks over the Greenland ice cap\". He continued to work at Marburg until 1919, when he was appointed head of the Department of theoretical meteorology at the German Hydrographic Office (The Deutsche Seewarte) in Hamburg. In 1924 he was appointed professor of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Institute of Physics, University of Graz. In addition to his continuing interest in continental drift and polar meteorology, he also conducted investigations concerning processes in the upper atmosphere and the Aurora Borealis. Furthermore, he also studied optical effects in the frigid air above the Greenland ice cap, where spectacular optical phenomena can occur in the presence of ice crystals. In a 1926 article, Wegener explained the formation process of two rare arcs that can appear opposite the Sun in the presence of ice crystals. The arcs were then named in his honour.\n\nWegener's interest in tornadoes probably dates from the first of his four Greenland expeditions, for which he acted as physicist and meteorologist. In July of 1907, he and other expedition members observed a series of waterspouts from Cape Bismarck in the Northeast Greenland National Park. In subsequent years he tried to provide a physical explanation for the formation of tornadoes and waterspouts. He was drafted into the German army in 1914 and served in WWI. In 1916, as commanding officer of the German Army's Field Weather Station 12, he was responsible for the station's weather observations. He devoted his free time to meteorological research and focused on the theory of tornadoes and on bringing together all available empirical observations of European tornadoes. He corresponded with Wladimir Köppen about this project. His book on tornadoes, Wind- und Wasserhosen in Europa (Tornadoes and Waterspouts in Europe), was finished in August of 1916 and published in 1917. It was essentially a synthesis of everything that was known at the time about European tornadoes. It included Wegener's ideas about their formation and structure and effects, along with the first catalogue of all known observations of tornadoes and waterspouts in Europe before 1915. Wegener presented 258 such reports, which served as the basis for his European tornado climatology, the first such climatology that had ever been produced. He showed, for example, that European tornadoes occurred mainly in the months of June through August, with a peak in July. Modern work has confirmed the overall conclusions of Wegener's climatology of European tornadoes.\n\nIn addition to his meteorological work, Wegener originated a revolution in geophysics: the idea of continental drift. This theory accounted for geological and fossil evidence that ancient climates had been vastly different from modern ones. Wegener thought that actual motion of continents might explain this climatic puzzle, so he and the climatologist Wladimir Köppen (who was also his father-in-law) plotted ancient deserts, jungles and ice sheets on paleogeographic maps based on the theory. The result was a plausible picture of past climates. Evidence of an ice age from some 280 million years ago, for example, scattered over almost all the Earth in modern times, clustered neatly around the South Pole in Wegener's map. This was because Africa, Antarctica, Australia and India had once comprised a southern hemispheric supercontinent (Gondwanaland). Wegener considered such paleoclimatic validation one of the strongest proofs of his theory. Conversely, continental drift has since become one of the main supporting principles of paleoclimatology. The South African geologist Alexander du Toit, working more or less independently, reached similar conclusions to those of Wegener and so became one of the early supporters of his theory.\n\nWegener returned to Greenland in the spring of 1930 as the leader of an expedition designed to systematically study the Greenland ice cap and its climate. Ernst Sorge, Johannes Giorgi and Fritz Lowe were part of this team. During this expedition, three research stations were set up: West camp, East camp, and Eismitte (Middle Ice camp, located on the ice cap at some 3000 m elevation). Unfortunately, in November 1930 Wegener and Rasmus Villumsen died while trying to reach West camp from Eismitte. Wegener was only 50. Despite his death, the expedition succeeded in its goal of recording one full year of meteorological observations at the Eismitte station as well as at the West camp station.\n\nGermany's Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine research, established in 1980, was named in honour of Wegener.\n\nOther selected publications by Wegener:\n\nDurch die weiße Wüste (The Crossing of the Ice Cap, 1912-13) (1919) The Origin of Continents and Oceans (published in German in 1912 and 1915, and translated to other languages in 1922) Die Klimate der Geologischen Vorzeit (The Climates of the Geological Past) (with W.

He was also the director of the early Max Planck Institute for Stratospheric Physics in the years between the two World Wars (this Institute is now known as the Institute for Aeronomy). His research with upper air balloons launched from the Institute helped to define the chemical composition of the troposphere and the stratosphere. One particular area of interest for Regener was the influence of ultraviolet (UV) light on the chemical equilibrium between molecular oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3). In 1934 he became the first scientist to directly measure the absorption of UV energy in the ozone layer. He also studied cosmic rays in the stratosphere, and had plans to study Earth's upper atmosphere with instruments aboard a German V-2 rocket.\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content Germany2052 cover (Mi2073 cover)(Pictorial) cancel on cover2000\"Erich Regener, extraterrestrial physics pioneer\" and his A-4 research rocket and ejected instrument package; also 120th anniv. birth, in 2001 GermanyB857 cover (Mi2097 cover)(Pictorial) cancel and (black printed) cachet on cover2000\"Prof. Dr. Erich Regener\"; \"A-4 rocket with a 'Regener canister' for high atmospheric research\" (in German text and also illustrated in the cachet); \"Erich Regener, extraterrestrial physics pioneer\" and A-4 research rocket and ejected instrument package (in the cancel); also 120th anniv. birth, in 2001\n\nLangmuir, Irving\n\n(1881–1957)\n\nIrving Langmuir was an American physical chemist who spent much of his career with the General Electric (GE) corporation. He was awarded the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1932, but is remembered by meteorologists mostly for his pioneering work in the area of weather modification through cloud seeding.\n\nHe invented the Langmuir probe, an instrument designed to measure the properties of ionized gases (known as 'plasma', a term that he coined in 1927) in the upper atmosphere. In 1946, a Langmuir probe and other instruments were carried aloft from White Sands Missile Range by a V2 rocket. Although the V2 failed, the launch marked the first attempt to explore the upper atmosphere through direct measurements by rocket-borne instruments.\n\nLangmuir had a strong interest in meteorology, particularly in the area of cloud microphysics. In the war years, he was involved in research on smoke screens and on aircraft de-icing capabilities. He and his colleague Vincent Schaefer invented the artificial fog smoke screen generator widely used during WWII. This work led him to think about clouds in general, and airborne particulates and ice nucleation in particular. In 1946, Langmuir and Schaefer realized that clouds might be modified by \"seeding\" them with dry ice pellets. The dry ice supplied to the cloud would form extra ice particles to which cloud water would migrate, resulting in more cloud droplets and potentially more rain. They demonstrated the effect later that year. Their work continued in the post-war years with dry ice and also silver iodide as seeding agents. The hope was that a certain amount of seeding could induce clouds to produce rain, while overseeding could potentially reduce hail and so reduce hail damage to crops. The work was controversial, and considerations of possible financial liability led GE to turn the program over to the military in 1947. The military continued to conduct cloud seeding experiments, some of which were carried out in the area of Socorro, New Mexico, which since 1963 has been home to the Irving Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research.\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content Micronesia471 (BL98)SS12001Irving Langmuir, cloud seeding pioneer\n\nvon Kármán, Teodor\n\n(1881–1963)\n\nTeodor von Kármán was a Hungarian fluid dynamicist and aerodynamicist whose work has some applications to the atmosphere. He emigrated to the US in 1930. In the period 1915–1938, von Kármán and Prandtl developed mixing-length hypotheses for the atmosphere, using eddy diffusivities and flux-gradient concepts based on analogies with molecular transfer (Garratt, J. R., 1992. The Atmospheric Boundary Layer, p.3-4. Cambridge University Press).\n\nThe von Kármán constant is used in studies of turbulence in the planetary boundary layer. Von Kármán \"cloud streets\" can occur in some cases in the low levels of the atmosphere downstream of an island or other low barrier across which a moderate wind is blowing. These atmospheric flow patterns may be visible in the low level cloud formations downstream of the barrier. If there is no obscuring middle or upper-level cloud, satellite imagery can clearly show them. Here is an example.\n\nVon Kármán was the recipient of many awards, including, in 1963, the first US Medal of Science, which he received from John F. Kennedy.\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content von Kármán (on non-launch-cover postal items) Central African Republic761 (Mi1165A)\n\ni761 (Mi1165B)\n\nImperforate1985 Central African Republic761a (BL347A)\n\ni761a (BL347B)SS1 (761)\n\nImperforate SS1 (i761) Central African Republic1060a (Mi?)One of strip of 3 (1060 (a-c))1994(30th anniv. death, in 1993) Chad710d (Mi1520A)\n\ni710d (Mi1520B)One stamp of MS6 (710 (a-f)) (Mi1517A-1522A)\n\nOne stamp of imperforate MS6 (i710 (a-f)) (Mi1517B-1522B)1997 HungaryNone (Mi_P255)Postal card1981(100th anniv. birth) Hungary3353 (Mi?)1992(110th anniv. birth, in 1991); (30th anniv. death, in 1993) Maldive IslandsMi8214One of MS4 (Mi8214-8217)2019\"Von Kármán Crater\" Maldive IslandsMi8214-8217_ms4 fdcMS4 on FDC Mali1037d (Mi2270)One of MS4 (1037 (a-d)) (Mi2267-2270)1999 Mali1037 fdcMS4 on FDC Micronesia178b (Mi?)One of block of 8 (178 (a-h)), or two of MS16 (2x (a-h))1993(30th anniv. death) Micronesia178b fdcStamp and cancel and cachet on FDC United StatesNone dOne of (RRI) imperforate cinderella MS41969 United StatesNoneCachet on cover, also back1990 United States2699 (Mi2313)Also partial sheet with selvedge1992(110th anniv. birth, in 1991); (30th anniv. death, in 1993) United States2699 fdc1Stamp on FDC (multi-color cachet) United States2699 fdc2Stamp and (pictorial) cancel (design like stamp) on FDC (blank/no cachet) United States2699 fdc3Stamp and (ArtCraft/PCS) cachet on FDC United States2699 fdc4Stamp and (ArtCraft) cachet on FDC United States2699 fdc5Stamp and (Fleetwood) cachet on FDC, also back United States2699 fdc6Stamp and tab1 and (Fleetwood) cachet on FDC, also back United States2699 fdc7Stamp and tab2 and (Fleetwood) cachet on FDC, also back United States2699 fdc8Stamp and tab3 and (Fleetwood) cachet on FDC, also back United States2699 fdc9Stamp and tab1 and (Fleetwood) cachet on FDC card United States2699 fdc10Stamp and (Artmaster) cachet on FDC, also back United States2699 fdc11Stamp and (Robert C.

In Paris under Marie Curie she studied the effects of solar radiation on radioactive substances. She claimed that it could induce what she termed an 'artificial radioactivity' in those substances. Modern research does not support this idea.\n\nMărăcineanu moved to the University of Bucharest in 1930 where she continued her research. One of her colleagues, Dimitrie Bungentianu, was interested in the atmosphere and meteorology, and she was drawn to those areas as well. Her work with radiation led her to theorize that radioactive sources might have something to do with the onset of rain. In 1931 the hypothesis was tested in Baragan, Romania, which was experiencing a drought. Low clouds were injected with radioactive salts released from an airplane, and some rainfall was noted. In 1934, the French government supported similar artificial rainfall experiments in the Touggourt desert region of Algeria. The results were inconclusive, and the idea faded away with the approach of World War II. After the war, the focus of weather modification research shifted to the United States, where it was found that dry ice or silver iodide (without radioactivity) could be used as cloud seeding agents.\n\nMărăcineanu also claimed that there was a correlation between earthquake activity and rainfall, because of certain electrical or radioactive perturbations in the atmosphere and in the ground at the time of the earthquake. The mechanism was not clear and the idea was not confirmed by other researchers.\n\nMărăcineanu died in 1944, probably as a result of cancer caused by her lifelong work with radioactive substances.\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content Romania5441 (Mi?)From MS6 (5441a (6x 5441))2013First artificial rain experiment, based on the work of Ştefania Mărăcineanu Romania5441-5443 fdcOne of three stamps and cachet on FDC RomaniaNone(Posta Romana) stamped envelope\n\nGoddard, Robert H.\n\n(1882–1945)\n\nRobert Goddard was an American physicist, engineer and rocketry pioneer whose work created the foundations of space flight. He is now considered to be the \"father\" of modern rocketry.\n\nIn 1899, Goddard first speculated about using rockets to explore the upper atmosphere. In 1919 he published his classic work, A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes, in which he proposed that rockets could be used to explore the upper atmosphere by lifting weather-recording instruments to higher levels than would be possible with balloons. In 1920 he repeated that proposal in a paper titled The Possibilities of the Rocket in Weather Forecasting (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, VI (1920), p 493). However, his main challenge was to develop rockets that worked.\n\nIn 1926 Goddard launched the first liquid fuel rocket. On 17 July 1929 he launched the first instrumented rocket, carrying a barometer, a thermometer, and a small camera to record the readings of the instruments (the idea was that the camera shutter would be tripped when the rocket's parachute was deployed). These instruments were secondary to the goals of the flight, and were really no more than interesting secondary engineering devices that Goddard wished to test. In any case, the launch failed, reaching only 52 m altitude.\n\nNevertheless, the seed of the idea of sounding rockets was planted, and a very few people in America considered their scientific potential. For example, in 1931 W.J. Humphreys published an article titled \"Mining the Sky for Scientific Knowledge\" (Scientific American, 144, Jan 1931, p 22). On 27 January 1932, John A. Fleming, Head of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee that some thought was being given to using Goddard's rockets for research during the Second International Polar Year beginning 1 August 1932. Nothing came of this proposal, though, and such ideas about rocketry continued to fall on deaf ears in America in the 1930s.\n\nIt was in Russia that the first rockets that could actually deliver atmospheric information were developed. They were based on the GIRD (Group for the Investigation of Reaction Propulsion) rockets developed in the early 1930s. GIRD-9 was successfully tested in August 1933, and GIRD-10 in November of that same year. As members of GIRD, the Soviet rocketry pioneers F. A. Zander and M. K. Tikhonravov were involved in the development and testing of those rockets. Zander did not live to see the two successful launches: he died in March 1933. Another GIRD-10 launch in 1935 apparently carried instruments for upper atmospheric research and reached an altitude of 11 km (Reference: Frederick Ordway III and Ronald C. Wakeford, International Missile and Spacecraft Guide, New York, 1960, p 4). As far as is known, no details of the instruments carried or the results ever reached the West. Tikhonravov continued to work on liquid-fuel rockets for upper-atmospheric research until the end of the 1930s.\n\nMilitary rockets were developed by German scientists and engineers before and during WWII, and after the war and in the 1950s many of those same people contributed to the rapid development of American sounding rockets.\n\nFrom the brief history presented above, we see that atmospheric sounding rocket instruments can be traced back to their most humble beginnings: Goddard`s test of 17 July 1929.\n\nIn 1963 the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) was formed, honouring Goddard with its name. The Center's Laboratory for Atmospheres had as its mission to study the Earth's atmosphere through the use of satellite remote sensing techniques.\n\nIn 1970 the astronomical/telescope satellite OAO-B was named \"Goddard\" to honour his accomplishments. Unfortunately, the launch of OAO-B failed.\n\nA well-known photo of Goddard shows him standing beside the frame that supported his first liquid-propelled rocket in 1926.

After serving in WWI, he graduated from the electrical engineering faculty of the Vienna Technology University. As part of his work in astronautics, he was the first to establish the scientific basis of the geostationary orbit. Satellites in such an orbit, at 36,000 km above the equator, remain constantly above the same spot on the Earth's surface, since they revolve around the Earth in the same time as the Earth takes to make one rotation on its axis. Many communications and weather satellites take advantage of this type of orbit.\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content Austria1586 (Mi2082)1992100th anniv. birth Austria1586 fdcStamp and (multi-color printed) cachet on FDC Slovenia149 (Mi?)1992(100th anniv. birth) Slovenia149 fdcStamp and (pictorial) cancel and (multi-color printed) cachet on FDC Slovenia-VitanjeLocal?\n\nHess, Victor Franz\n\n(1883–1964)\n\nVictor Hess was an Austrian physicist who did work in the area of atmospheric electricity.\n\nIn balloon flights in 1910, Alfred Gockel estimated the electrical conductivity of the atmosphere as a function of height by measuring the rate of charge leakage from an insulated Wulf electrometer, in ascents to as high as 4500 m. The leakage rate was found to be greater aloft than near the Earth's surface, which meant that the atmospheric ionization was greater aloft than near the surface. This was unexpected because at that time the ionization was thought to be greatest at ground level, due to local radioactivity of the soil. Gockel had no explanation for his observations, but they would turn out to be a precursor of the discovery of cosmic radiation in the atmosphere. In 10 balloon ascents made from 1911 to 1913, Hess repeated the measurements and showed clearly that the ionization reached a minimum at 800 m and then increased steadily up to the highest altitude which he reached. He explained this in terms of a penetrating radiation entering the atmosphere from outside but not from the Sun. This was eventually recognized as the discovery of what came to be called cosmic radiation, for which Hess would share the Nobel Prize in physics in 1936. He also founded a research station at Hafelekar mountain (at 2300 m) near Innsbruck for observing and studying cosmic rays.\n\nCosmic rays are hypothesized to have some influence on weather and climate. For example, the ionization due to cosmic rays can change the atmospheric electric field. Lightning (and the associated thunder) will occur if the electric field becomes large enough.\n\nIn a paper published in 1997, Henrik Svensmark and Eigil Friis-Christensen of the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen found a correlation between cloudy days and high cosmic ray concentrations. A possible causal mechanism was described by Fangqun Yu (State University of New York at Albany): cosmic ray energy encourages the formation of atmospheric aerosols which act as cloud condensation nuclei which are necessary for cloud droplets to grow, and therefore for clouds to form. This idea is still considered speculative, however.\n\nCosmic rays are at the basis of carbon-14 (14C) dating, since their energy acts to form the carbon-14 in the first place. Relative 14C amounts have been measured in materials for which the age is also known by some other means (e.g. using the rings in tree trunks). This is useful because one can then deduce the amount of 14C that was present in the atmosphere at that time in the past. This in turn gives a history of the 14C flux. Other proxy paleontological measurements can give some idea of the global historical weather at that time. The cosmic ray flux and the weather can then be compared, and it turns out that there is a correlation between the flux and the weather: when the weather was generally cold, cosmic ray fluxes were high, and vice-versa. If colder weather can be related to greater cloudiness (due to less solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface), then this framework is consistent with the work mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\nAnother possible use of cosmic rays is in the measurement of soil moisture. A project being conducted by the University of Arizona called COSMOS (COsmic ray Soil Moisture Observing System) will study the low energy neutrons produced when cosmic rays strike the soil. Some of them are absorbed by the soil, while others are reflected back into space. It turns out that the number of neutrons in the air above the soil surface is inversely related to the soil moisture. Soil moisture can have a significant effect on weather, so improved measurement of soil moisture could lead to improved short term and longer term weather forecasts.\n\nHess's publications relating to the atmosphere include:\n\nElektrische Leitfähigkeit der Atmosphäre und ihre Ursachen (book), 1926 (The Electrical Conductivity of the Atmosphere and Its Causes, 1928); Ionenbilanz der Atmosphäre (The ionization balance of the atmosphere–book), 1933; Luftelektrizität (Electricity of the air–book, with H.

He and his twin brother Jean were pioneers in the balloon exploration of the stratosphere. Scientific balloon ascents in the 19th and early 20th Centuries had been done in an open nacelle, but in the 1920s the Piccards developed pressurized nacelles and new high-altitude balloons. On 27 May 1931, with his colleague Paul Kipfer, Auguste Piccard lifted off from Augsberg, Germany in the balloon FNRS and made the first manned balloon flight into the stratosphere, reaching a record altitude of about 15.8 km. On 18 August 1932, Piccard and Max Cosyns went even higher (approximately 16.2 km). During his flights, Piccard made measurements of cosmic rays in the stratosphere and also recorded stratospheric temperatures. Other aeronauts followed Piccard's lead in exploring the stratosphere by balloon, including Jean Piccard and the Americans Albert Stevens and Orville Anderson.\n\nFollowing his work with stratospheric balloons, Auguste Piccard turned his interest to the exploration of the ocean depths. As a boy he had dreamed about pressurized gondolas that could be used underwater, and eventually realized that a bathyscaphe could be thought of as an underwater balloon that uses gasoline for lift, since gasoline is lighter than water, just as hydrogen and helium provide the necessary lift for atmospheric balloons because they are lighter than air. It is in this sense that he later wrote in his book Earth, Sea and Sky that \"it was the submarine that led me to the stratosphere\".\n\nIn the latter half of the 1930s and in the 1940s Jean Piccard worked to improve the materials used in high altitude balloons. Polyethylene eventually became the balloon fabric of choice. It was light, not too expensive, and allowed balloons to ascend to around 30 km, where scientific measurements could be made with almost no atmospheric interference. Instruments aboard high altitude balloons have since studied ozone, carbon dioxide, carbon-14, nitrous oxide, nitrogen, dust particles, solar energy, cosmic rays and radiation in the high atmosphere. Eventually James Van Allen would launch scientific rockets from high altitude balloons to get atmospheric measurements from even higher levels. All this work was possible in part as a result of the scientific legacy of the Piccard brothers.\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content AustriaNoneCancel and cachet on cover1981FNRS balloon and 50th anniv.
