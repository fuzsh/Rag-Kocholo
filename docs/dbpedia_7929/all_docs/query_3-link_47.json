        "text": "Story timeðŸ˜Œ When I started our school tours Peace Shapers, I quickly realized that addressing the issue of school violence requires a comprehensive approach, involving not just students but also teachers, parents, and communities. It became evident that hosting a one-time training session, while valuable, might not ensure lasting impact. Teachers need to not only receive knowledge but also learn how to effectively apply and sustain what we impart to their students. There's so much that many educators are unaware of when it comes to classroom safety, not due to a lack of willingness, but often because they lack access and opportunities for such training. I felt compelled to address this issue. Iâ€™m very intentional in designing our projects, ensuring they go beyond mere \"activities.\" If we can't measure the impact, I won't just do it. The success of our recent WAVE Tour has inspired me to take this next step. When I envisioned this webinar, I carefully considered who to invite as the facilitator. Ugochi stood out as the ideal choice. I mean, have you seen her remarkable work? Ugochi is a renowned Child Safety expert in Nigeria, and her expertise doesn't come cheapðŸ« . I vividly remember praying for favor ðŸ˜…when reaching out to her, and boom, she agreed immediately. I couldnâ€™t even believe it cos omo, no money abeg ðŸ˜‚but God!!. This marks a significant milestone for Peace Shapers, and I'm honored to collaborate with the very best in the field. For those who know me, you understand I don't settle for mediocrity; it's either excellence or nothing at all. If you have connections with teachers, I urge you to share this opportunity with them. Let's partner together to create safe and secure learning environments where children can thrive and grow. #ThePeaceShaper #Youthinpeacebuilding #Safeschools #Childsafety\n\nOur book Thongs or Flip Flops is out. There are about one million Australian citizens living outside Australia, including families with children. Some are sent abroad for work - with DFAT, the ADF, NGOs, multinational companies, or missionary organisations. Others take jobs in their fields outside Australia, and still others move to be near family in other parts of the world. Australian kids growing up outside Australia are 'Third Culture Kids'(TCKs). They build childhood memories and emotional connections in other places and communities. Their concept of what it means to be 'Australian' will be impacted by these experiences, and their re-entry to Australia is often unexpectedly rocky. Thongs or Flip-Flops? provides Australian TCKs and Australian families living overseas with everything they need to know in order to thrive long term, no matter what paths they take in life.
