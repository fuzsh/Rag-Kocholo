        "text": "Many thanks to everyone who responded to my request. I also consulted a few friends who are not in HoL. I have made a list of the books and films that were suggested directly or indirectly and this is given below. I read the newest book at once (the one by Philip Oltermann) and was so impressed by it that I consulted him too. He was kind enough to suggest five more books and one more film. He also enthused about the TV series Heimat.\n\nThe list includes 28 books and 13 named films which is rather more than I had in mind so I have had to choose. For the time being, I intend to concentrate on the first four or five books below and on the first part of Heimat (that’s eleven episodes).\n\nBooks:\n\nKeeping Up with the Germans by Philip Oltermann\n\nThe Reader by Bernhard Schlink\n\nStasiland by Anna Funder\n\nBaader Meinhof Complex by Stefan Aust\n\nThe Conquest of Nature: Water, Landscape, and the Making of Modern Germany by David Blackbourn\n\nThe Emigrants, Vertigo and Rings of Saturn by W G Sebald\n\nThe Tin Drum, Peeling the Onion and The Box by Günter Grass\n\nThe Safety Net by Heinrich Boll.\n\nThe File by Timothy Garton Ash\n\nWhat We Knew by Eric A. Johnson and Karl - Heinz Reuband\n\nFive Germanys I Have Known by Fritz Stern\n\nGermany: Unravelling an Enigma by Greg Nees\n\nThe Germans by Gordon A. Craig\n\nEffi Briest by Theodor Fontane\n\nThe Black Spider by Jeremias Gotthelf\n\nThree Men on the Bummel by Jerome K Jerome\n\nThe Piano Teacher by Elfride Jelinek\n\nLove in the time of the Mahlstädt child: stories by Clemens Setz\n\nIn Europe by Geert Mak\n\nMeasuring the World by Daniel Kelinek\n\nAtemschaukel (Everything I Possess I Carry With Me) and Der Fuchs war damals schon der\n\nJäger (Even Back Then, the Fox Was the Hunter) by Herta Müller\n\nAlone in Berlin by Hans Fallada\n\nFlights of Love by Bernhard Schlink\n\nBerlin Blues by Sven Regener\n\nFilms:\n\nThe Wave by Denis Gansel\n\nThe Lives of Others by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck\n\nRun Lola Run by Tom Tykwer\n\nGoodbye Lenin by Wolfgang Becker\n\nWings of Desire by Wim Wenders\n\nBaader-Meinhof Komplex by Uli Edel\n\nDownfall and The Final Days by Oliver Hirschbiegel\n\nWomen in Berlin by Max Färberböck\n\nThe Hunters are the Hunted by Peter Fleischer\n\nAmen by Rolf Hochhuth\n\nThe Enigma of Kaspar Hauser by Werner Herzog\n\nAnything by Schöndorff, Herzog, Fassbinder, Costa-Gavras\n\nHead On by Fatih Akin\n\nTV:\n\nHeimat\n\nAvailable via the internet are two multi national TV stations.. 3SAT & ARTE available everywhere in Germany..\n\n3SAT Is a joint German, Austrian & Swiss station. Be aware that the Swiss are considered to be, at least within the German speaking world, as conservative and a bit boring.. a clichee maybe, but all clichees have some basis.\n\nhttp://www.3sat.de/index.html\n\nand then there's ARTE, a joint French-German station with all programming available in French & German - Maybe this might be a way into German Culture for those can speak French better than German..\n\nhttp://www.arte.tv/fr French\n\nhttp://www.arte.tv/de German\n\nhttp://videos.arte.tv/fr/videos/html/index-4268756.html en direct/live\n\nI've often thought a joint German-English station might be worthwhile.. as the understanding and knowledge of Germany in Britain is somewhat lacking.. But, I expect that the Brits, being TV chauvanists, who prefer to buy in MACprogramming from the USA, wouldn't be much interested .. Better stay with the old chlichees you know and love, than be really in touch.\n\nNot at all what Dick was looking for, nor yet \"the old cliches you know and love\" as StephenBln puts it, I found Timothy Snyder's \"Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin\" (2010) an eye-opener. Not so much Heimat as Lebensraum meets Das To(e)ten Raum where Uncle Adolf meets Uncle Joe in the spaces in between. But then I find you can often learn more about lebensraum seekers in the countries they've visited than on their home soil. Like Dick Harris, I return to Vienna at Easter, 43 years after my one and only visit. I think I'll revert to Snyder on the Hapsburgs for my prep."
