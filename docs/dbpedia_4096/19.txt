Harry Joe Brown got his start in the theater, where he was an actor and director. He went to Hollywood and became a director--mostly of second features--at Universal Pictures in 1930, then went over to Paramount from 1932 to 1933. His main focus was as a producer, however, and he produced quite a few films for Columbia Pictures. In partnership with actor Randolph Scott and director Budd Boetticher he turned out a string of both critically and financially successful westerns at Columbia in the 1950s.
