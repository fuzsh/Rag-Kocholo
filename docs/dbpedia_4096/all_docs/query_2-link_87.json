        "text": "Born in Beverly Hills, CA to actress and fashion model, Karen Somerville and producer and screen writer, Harry “Coco” Brown, Morgan grew up with parents who traveled the globe. This fast paced lifestyle exposed Morgan, at an early age, to glamour, sophistication and an array of new worlds and cultures. Her father eventually moved the family to New York where he started a career in commercial real estate. His career turned into an empire, eventually owning office buildings all over New York as well as internationally. He was also the mastermind behind the Mullholland estates in Beverly Hills. When she wasn’t traveling with her father, Morgan spent a lot of her childhood in England and Ireland where her mother resided when she married legendary actor Peter O’Toole (Laurence of Arabia) and gave birth to Lorcan O’Toole, Morgan’s brother.\n\nAt the age of 14 Morgan stepped into the modeling world and her eye for fashion was ignited. Running around New York and making her mark in the social scene, Morgan immersed herself in the fashion and art scenes of the 1990s. Traveling between New York and London, Morgan’s keen sense of aesthetic became finely tuned.\n\nIn 1995 her father, Coco Brown, began The Houses at Sagaponic Project. It was the brain child of Coco and famed Architect, Richard Myer (Getty museum). At this time, Morgan was interning at her father’s company and she credits this project with sparking her love of design. The concept was thirty-five houses, each to be built by renowned architects from around the world (Michael Graves, Philip Johnson, Richard Rogers to name a few). It was to be a museum of sorts, showcasing some of the greatest global architects of the time and all in one subdivision in the Hamptons. Morgan remembers the care they took to incorporate modern simplicity and environmentally sensitive design and sustainability. The project went on to receive numerous prestigious accolades and had a book published by Rizzoli.\n\nIn 2004, Morgan would go on to take over her father’s company when he passed away from cancer. Devastated by the loss, she sank her teeth into running several office buildings in New York, four large shopping centers in Florida and international properties in Canada, France and Uruguay. In 2006 she left New York and returned to Los Angeles where she continued her father’s legacy but also began exploring residential housing. She built her first house from the ground up when she was only 27 and has built seven other impressive estates since then.\n\nSoon requests for Morgan’s design and decorating skills started pouring in and so she created Morgan Brown Desgins. In 2017, Morgan took a risk and did something that had never been done before. She built the first and largest compound in West Hollywood. The two-lot estate features four structures, a salt-water pool and a skate park. It has been featured in many architectural shows and it is where she currently resides. In 2019 Morgan decided to part from her fathers commercial real estate company and invest her money and time refurbishing famed historical trophy properties around Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2020 Morgan purchased 220 acres in Joshua Tree where she was inspired to make her mark building an oasis in the California Desert - a boutique hotel consisting of bungalows in the shape of stars and crescent moons Her dream is to make a place where people can escape, relax in luxury and lose themselves in the magic of the desert.\n\nMorgan’s boho chic style lends itself to cozy, spiritually inspired homesteads. Morgan has also always pulled her inspirations from historical properties and homes. This may have something to do with the fact that Morgan stems from old Hollywood royalty. Her grandfather was legendary producer Harry Joe Brown, whose star can still be found today on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, and her grandmother was Sally Eilers, a silent film star and a Zigfield girl.\n\nMorgan believes the home is your sanctuary and with that in mind it should be curated, respected and loved. To her, design is so much more than just some rugs and furniture, design is an extension of your senses. How you feel in a room is just as important as how it looks. Morgan’s innate ability to combine textures, colors, sounds and even scents is what separates her visions from other interior designs. Maybe it’s because family is the most important thing to her that all aspects of her homes reflect a sense of familiarity and belonging. From extra large kitchens to cozy entertaining rooms, Morgan has an instinct for making all rooms of the house inviting while still maintaining a standard of luxury and sophistication. When she’s not building them, she’s living in them with her 16 year old son and her three dogs. And in her spare time, she can be found galloping on her horse in show jumping Grands Prix. It’s no wonder why people have described her as the female Ralph Lauren. She has a New York meets Cali meets London style that is echoed in her homes and her fashion. From her old Hollywood heritage to her immense travel and fashion background, she has molded herself into a visionary developer and designer."
