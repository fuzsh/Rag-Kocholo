        "text": "SO often in the half-dozen low-budget, impeccably made westerns that Budd Boetticher directed in the late 1950's, the opening shot features a lone horseman approaching the camera out of a lunar vastness of rock. We don't know who he is, though his name always has a ring to it: Stride, Brennan, Allison, Buchanan, Brigade, Cody. You do know that he comes bearing the elemental promise of a story.\n\nOnce or twice he has nothing more on his mind than acquiring a new seed bull for his one-man ranch, or simply enjoying a drink and a good steak in the next town. In those instances, circumstances will swiftly conspire to raise the existential-absurdist ante and place his and others' lives in dire jeopardy. But more often, this rider of the wasteland might as well be a spirit rather than a man. Somewhere, days or weeks or years ago, his heart has taken a deep wound that can never be healed. His essential story is already over. It remains merely for us to catch up on it as he settles leftover business -- ritual, re-enactment, revenge.\n\nThe unfamiliar name Budd Boetticher (pronounced BETT-icker) is likely to be in the air this month, with tributes to him planned by the American Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Festival. The film festival will include, on Sept. 30, a retrospective showing of ''Seven Men From Now,'' a 1956 picture directed by Mr. Boetticher, written by Burt Kennedy, produced by John Wayne's production company, Batjac, and starring Randolph Scott and Lee Marvin. It is that rarity, a B-movie that turned out to be a masterpiece -- a complete original in the western genre and as classical a piece of filmmaking as you could ask to see. Except that for the last couple of decades, asking did no good. The only print in clandestine circulation had turned pink and suffered such breakage that two of its most memorable deaths occur ''off screen,'' during a splice break. The film has just been restored by the U.C.L.A. Film and Television Archive.\n\nFor its part, the American Museum of the Moving Image has pulled together a proper run-up to the film festival event. Over three weekends, Sept. 16 to Oct. 1, the museum will offer a comprehensive survey of Mr. Boetticher's career, including all five of the westerns he and Scott went on to do in partnership with the producer Harry Joe Brown, emulating the commercially and critically successful model of ''Seven Men From Now'': ''The Tall T'' (1957), ''Decision at Sundown'' (1957), ''Buchanan Rides Alone'' (1958), ''Ride Lonesome'' (1959) and ''Comanche Station'' (1960). (The five are out on video.)\n\nTaken together under the leathery moniker ''The Ranown Cycle'' (after Randolph Scott and Harry Joe Brown), these films constitute one of the most elegant and esteemed bodies of work in American film, whose spiritual and stylistic rigorousness had critics reaching for parallels in ''The Odyssey'' and ''The Canterbury Tales.'' The series remains -- rivaled only by Val Lewton's 1940's horror films for RKO -- the most remarkable convergence of artistic achievement in the history of low-budget moviemaking.\n\nEach of the films stands alone, yet the series is strikingly cohesive. To have seen one movie is not to have seen them all; still, seeing them all has the effect of making any one look richer and more resonant. And although the storylines rehearse similar incidents, and similar characters recur, the storytelling is so spare and the rhythms are so canny that any attempt to synopsize the deceptively simple plots compromises the dramatic force and pleasure -- the integrity -- of the experience the films afford.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
