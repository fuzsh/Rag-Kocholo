        "text": "Producers Corp of America did not spare the budget in readying this adaptation from the original by Maxwell Anderson and Kurt Weill. Harry Joe Brown, who produced and directed for the screen, has done much to emphasize the film’s humor, gaiety and songs in a fast-moving pic.\n\nA comedy set to music, film is laid in old New Amsterdam of Peter Stuyvesant’s day. It deals with a gay, singing but fighting newspaper publisher who fights for freedom in the colony and relief from the oppressed from conniving politicians. He crosses the path of the crafty, humorous Governor Stuyvesant in his political and newspaper crusading and also in his desire to wed the daughter of a politician.\n\nFilm has nine songs, five more than the [1938] Broadway show. The music ties the production together neatly. Four songs – lyrics by Anderson, music by Weill – carried over from the original. They are ‘Nowhere to Go but Up’, ‘It Never Was Anywhere You’, ‘Indispensable Man’ and ‘September Song’, first two sung by Nelson Eddy, last two by Charles Coburn."
