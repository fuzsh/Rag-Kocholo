        "text": "On July 25, right at the end of the semi-annual half-off sale at Barnes & Noble (and concurrent price matching at Amazon), The Criterion Collection released their biggest 4K box-set to date: The Ranown Westerns: Five Films Directed by Budd Boetticher. Here’s how Criterion sums up the package:\n\nThe five briskly entertaining, vividly performed westerns made by director Budd Boetticher and strapping star Randolph Scott in the second half of the 1950s transcend their B-movie origins to become rich, unexpectedly profound explorations of loyalty, greed, honor, and revenge. Often grouped under the name Ranown (after producer Harry Joe Brown and Scott’s production company) and colorfully scripted by Burt Kennedy and Charles Lang, these films seem to unfold in a world unto themselves, staking a claim between traditional westerns and the subversive genre revisionism of the 1960s—and representing the crowning achievement of the underappreciated auteur Boetticher.\n\nIn early July, I received a preview copy of the set and proceeded to work my way through its contents. Along the way, I created a series of short video clips on my TikTok account, which I’ve assembled here to serve as my review. Saddle up cowboy, let’s hit the dusty trail! Here’s my big round-up:\n\nFirst Arrival\n\n@dee.ell.bee first look at packaging for the #RanownWesterns new #4K #boxset from the #criterioncollection ♬ Wilderness, western, whistling, melancholy, western(833142) – みんと\n\nOpening Thoughts\n\n@dee.ell.bee opening thoughts on the #RanownWesterns new #4K #boxset from the #criterioncollection #buddboetticher #randolphscott #westernfilms #bmovies ♬ Harmonica Healing Leisurely Relax(1309411) – kajisan\n\nTHE TALL T\n\n@dee.ell.bee a few comments about THE TALL T, part of the #RanownWesterns box set from #criterioncollection ♬ original sound – David Blakeslee\n\nDECISION AT SUNDOWN\n\n@dee.ell.bee comments on DECISION AT SUNDOWN, film #2 in the #RanownWesterns #boxset from the #criterioncollection #RandolphScott #westernmovies ♬ original sound – David Blakeslee\n\nBUCHANAN RIDES ALONE\n\n@dee.ell.bee BUCHANAN RIDES ALONE #3 in my series on the #RanownWesterns #4kboxset from #criterioncollection #randolphscott #westernmovies #tallinthesaddle ♬ original sound – David Blakeslee\n\nRIDE LONESOME\n\n@dee.ell.bee clip #4 covering RIDE LONESOME from that #RanownWesterns box set recently released by #criterioncollection starring #RandolphScott directed by #BuddBoetticher ♬ original sound – David Blakeslee\n\nCOMANCHE STATION\n\n@dee.ell.bee COMANCHE STATION is the last of 5 features in this #4K #ranownwesterns #boxset from #criterioncollection ♬ original sound – David Blakeslee\n\nSupplements and Final Thoughts\n\n@dee.ell.bee final clip in my #RanownWesterns series, talking about the supplements included in this excellent #boxset #buddboetticher #randolphscott #westernmovies ♬ original sound – David Blakeslee\n\nAfter all that, and without repeating myself (I hope), my bottom line on this set is a resounding endorsement – this is a riveting collection of excellently crafted and thoroughly entertaining movies! I’m not a diehard fan of Westerns, but my appreciation has grown over the past decade or so, and these films are among the very best I’ve seen in that genre from its “classic” era. The themes they explore definitely transcend the usual white hat vs. black hat “horse opera” clichés, and each one delivers a distinctively satisfying experience without requiring much in the way of strenuous work to focus attention from the audience.\n\nMy only caveat would be for viewers who are decidedly uninterested in the Western genre – if you don’t get some degree of appreciation from watching men ride around on horses, pulling guns on each other, and settling their conflicts through high-stakes shootouts, these films are not meant for you. And I think it’s safe to assume that there’s a significant number of viewers who would cringe at some of the indisputably objectifying portrayals of women and indigenous peoples in several of the titles, though I don’t think they cross into territory that makes them actively offensive. Still, they are products of an era and a “man’s world” mentality that needs to be acknowledged in 2023. This set is already on my short list of “favorite Criterion releases of the year” and (setting the massive and magnificent Pasolini 101 edition aside), has a strong chance of being my #1 – though we have yet to see what November and December will unleash!\n\nCONTACT ME:"
