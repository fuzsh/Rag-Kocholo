        "text": "Wouldnt you just like to know what Coca-Cola paid MGM for this all star cast advert. Of course it’s great publicity for DINNER AT EIGHT. Even the film’s director,George Cukor is there.\n\nThe ad talks about “the cooling relief from the hot kleig lights” and “the stress and strain of shooting scenes over and over.”\n\n(Hope that’s not a comment on Mr. Cukor’s directing style!)\n\nNice colour shot from SIGN OF THE CROSS, with Fredric March, Claudette Colbert and Cecil B. DeMille.\n\nNice to know that Cleopatra favoured Coca-Cola.\n\nParamount apparently has bottled Coca-Cola on the sets.\n\n“The pause that refreshes” was the recurring theme.\n\nParamount also liked Pepsi-Cola. Here with Robert Preston and Ellen Drew in NIGHT OF JANUARY 16TH.(1941)\n\nPepsi is described as bigger and better – for only a nickel. The two companies kept their prices the same, even though Pepsi suggests it is bigger.\n\nPepsi-Cola is “the double feature favourite all over America”. (Ah, the days of double features when you got your money’s worth.)\n\nLon Chaney is guzzling that Pepsi, as Broderick Crawford pours for Evelyn Ankers, in NORTH OF THE KLONDIKE.(1942)\n\n(Crawford was billed as ‘Brod’ Crawford in this film.)\n\n”Pepsi-Cola is the rage of Hollywood!”\n\nRKO’s THREE GUYS AND A GOB, with Lucille Ball and Edmund O’Brien.\n\nPepsi is different from other cola drinks because of its “finer flavor”.

He is due to testify in a murder trial, but feels his testimony will send his friend to the chair.\n\nHe ends up in San Francisco at the house of his ex-wife ( CATHY O’DONNELL) who has left him because of his gambling. He assures her he is a reformed character and even has a job and bank book to prove it.\n\nThings don’t go smoothly of course. Detectives TOM DRAKE and JEFF COREY are on the lookout for him, and Cathy is followed out of a shop by RHYS WILLIAMS , also a cop but one who thinks any woman is an easy target for him.\n\nRhys ends up accidentally dead and Dane decides to dispose of the body and not to tell the police.\n\nTom Drake, Rhys Williams, Jeff Corey\n\nDrake and Corey make a good team as they tie all the pieces together and Drake falls for O’Donnell.\n\nAlways reliable MYRNA DELL would have been preferable in the lead female role but only has a few scenes as a friend of Cathy O’Donnell. ( O’ Donnell is just too one- note for me).\n\nI wish this film was out on DVD. I caught it on You Tube.\n\nThis poster actually gives too much away, indicating Dane Clark as a killer. But is he!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe line of dialogue supposedly spoken by Tony Curtis in either THE PRINCE WHO WAS A THIEF or THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH – or THE SON OF ALI BABA is :\n\n“Yonder lies the castle of my father.”\n\nBut the legend goes than Tony Curtis, born in the Bronx,New York, said:\n\n“Yonda lies da castle of my faddah.”\n\nThus making fun of , and implying that Tony had a pronounced and modern accent in an Arabian Nights fantasy.\n\nBut the fact is that Tony very quickly lost his Bronx accent after entering movies. And there is no such dialogue line in any of these films.\n\nThe nearest is in “Son Of Ali Baba”, in which he says, quite clearly and plainly, “This is my father’s castle. And yonder lies the valley of the sun.”\n\nBut, as Carleton Young said to James Stewart in “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance”,\n\n“When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.”\n\nTony Curtis, in his autobiography, indicated he felt a little hurt by the comment and said it might have originated with Debbie Reynolds!\n\nJust as anyone impersonating James Cagney will always say, “You dirty rat!” Or Cary Grant pleading , “Judy! Judy! Judy!”, I guess the phrase tagged with Tony’s name will always be known in Hollywood.\n\nStill,Bette Davis fans know that she really did say, “What a dump!” – in BEYOND THE FOREST.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe 2017 documentary about HEDY LAMARR is by writer/ director Alexandra Dean and is now available on DVD . I saw it for the first time at the Glasgow Film Festival. I enjoyed it very much and have the DVD on order.\n\nKnown for her glacial beauty, MGM starred Hedy with all its biggest names from Gable to Tracy to Robert Taylor. She graced countless magazine covers. Though her acting range was quite limited, MGM persevered in the seven years they had her under contract from 1938.\n\nNotably, they did not renew her contract.\n\nThe documentary is not primarily a study of Hedy’s film career but concentrates more on an aspect of Hedy’s life which only came to light in recent years.\n\nHedy was an inventor, she was mechanically minded and said,\n\n“Inventions are easy for me to do – I have an inventive mind.”\n\nBorn Hedwig Kiesler in Vienna in 1914, Hedy was very close to her banker father who encouraged her interest in how things work. And her first husband , Freidrich Mandle , was a munitions manufacturer in Berlin.\n\nIn the 2011 book, “Hedy’s Folly, The Life and Break Through Inventions of Hedy Lamarr”, author Richard Rhodes points out that some inventors have been artists –\n\n“Samuel L.Morse, the co-inventor of the telegraph, was a professional painter……But many inventors have been people with no obvious qualifications for inventing. Hedy Lamarr was an inventor.”\n\nThe documentary makers were fortunate to make contact with a journalist ,Fleming Meeks ( a reporter at Forbes magazine) who had audio tapes of interviews with Hedy in 1990. Listening to Hedy talk about herself is fascinating.\n\nShe said, “The biggest people with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest people with smallest minds. Think big anyway.”\n\nMaybe she was still smarting at the U.S. Government for rejecting the invention she and her friend George Antheil had offered in 1940. The Government officials suggested she sell war bonds – which she did.\n\nWhat she and George Antheil had invented was a way to protect the radio transmissions that controlled torpedoes so they could not be jammed. (German U -Boats were sinking North Atlantic shipping).\n\nA patent was filed in 1941 and expired in 1959. When the U.S military, many years later, finally realised the importance of the invention, there was no recognition or compensation for Hedy.\n\nThe patent was filed under Hedy’s married name, Hedy Kiesler Markey ( her second husband was producer Gene Markey).\n\nIt has been written that Hedy’s invention, Spread Spectrum technology ,was the forerunner of Wi-Fi and GPS.\n\nHedy set up an inventor’s corner in the drawing room of her Hollywood home.\n\nApparently, while friends with Howard Hughes, Hedy discussed a more aerodynamic design for plane wings after observing birds and fish!\n\nAt the height of her beauty, in ZIEGFELD GIRL\n\nWith John Loder,one of her 6 husbands.\n\nHedy on the cover of the scientific magazine ,”Invention and Technology.”\n\nIn 1997, three years before her death, Hedy received an award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Her son accepted for her.\n\nIn 2014, she and her co- inventor George Antheil were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. They were honoured for contributing an important development in wireless communication.\n\nHedy died, aged 85 ,in 2000. In her last years she was a recluse. I saw some footage of her in her apartment on You Tube . Her many plastic surgeries were evident and very sad. Grotesque in fact.\n\nIt was announced in September , 2017 that Diane Kruger ( who appears in the documentary ) will play Hedy in a proposed TV mini series based on Richard Rhodes’ s book, Hedy’s Folly.\n\nI’ve caught up on some of Hedy’s films after seeing the documentary. I’m afraid none of her performances have impressed me. Partly let down by poor scripts, but ,apart from looking gorgeous, she is generally overshadowed by others in the casts.\n\nOne I haven’t seen,TORTILLA FLAT had Hedy alongside two powerhouse performers, Spencer Tracy and John Garfield.\n\nHedy was ushered back to MGM after the success of SAMSON AND DELILAH, but, again, MGM’s script for A LADY WITHOUT PASSPORT was just not good.\n\nHedy front and centre in the MGM star photo from 1943. She was always so elegant looking.\n\nBOMBSHELL is the first production of Reframed Pictures ,from Susan Sarandon, Alexandra Dean and Adam Haggiag.\n\nIt’s a fascinating story.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt was interesting to see the documentary , ROD TAYLOR, PULLING NO PUNCHES (2016) in the presence of the two Australians who made the documentary – director Robert de Young and producer Stephan Wellink.\n\nThe screening at the Glasgow Film Festival in February, 2018 was the first time the documentary has been shown in the U.K.\n\nBorn in Sydney, Rod Taylor (1930 – 2015) started off in radio in the early 1950s but made his way to Hollywood by 1954.\n\nMGM gave him a seven year contract in 1955 and put him in THE CATERED AFFAIR, with Bette Davis and Debbie Reynolds.\n\nRod is best remembered for THE TIME MACHINE (1960), THE V.I.P.’S ( one of the few times he played an Aussie), YOUNG CASSIDY and THE BIRDS.\n\nRod did quite a lot of TV including 26 episodes of a series called HONG KONG (1960/61). Ida Lupino was one of the directors.\n\nAnother series called OUTLAWS (1986/87) only lasted 12 episodes but looked interesting when I watched an episode on You Tube – time travelling cowboys from 1896 find themselves in 1986!\n\nMaggie Smith was interviewed and said Rod was incredibly generous.\n\nThree of my favorites :\n\nRod’s biographer,Stephen Vagg is also interviewed. His book is ROD TAYLOR,AN AUSSIE IN HOLLYWOOD (2010).\n\nHaving read the extensively researched and interesting book, I’d only take exception to Mr. Vagg’s description of one of my favorite westerns,”The Train Robbers” as lacking excitement and originality!\n\nAlso interviewed are Tippi Hedren and Angela Cartwright from “The Birds”\n\nThe heart of the documentary is a series of interviews Rod did in 2012. He comes over as open, candid and humorous.\n\nThe DVD of the documentary came out in Australia in January 2018 from UMBRELLAENT.COM.AU\n\nIt’s well worth seeing and I hope it gets a release in the UK and the States.\n\nI’ve been a Rod Taylor fan for a long time. Even in a small part in Alan Ladd’s HELL ON FRISCO BAY in 1955, he stood out as someone to watch.\n\nThere’s lots of info about Rod on the website http://www.rodtaylorsite.com\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI liked CROSSROADS, though Hedy Lamarr didn’t really deserve costar billing with William Powell.\n\nClaire Trevor, Basil Rathbone and Felix Bressart had more to do in this slick MGM story about amnesia and blackmail.\n\nSet in Paris in 1935. William Powell plays a French diplomat married to the glamorous Hedy. Powell’s character is an amnesiac after a train wreck 13 years earlier. He remembers nothing of his former life.\n\nClaire Trevor and Basil Rathbone claim they knew him before he lost his memory and threaten blackmail, saying he was involved in robbery and murder.\n\nNot knowing the truth , he offers Claire 50,000 francs, to which she replies, “You’re talking about cabbage – I want Caviar.”\n\nShe even says his mother is still alive and gives him her address.\n\nMargaret Wycherly is so good pretending to be the little old lady who mourns her son.\n\nIt’s all an elaborate con and Powell eventually catches on.\n\nThere’s a lovely scene where the three conspirators get together – Trevor, Rathbone and Wycherly, arguing among themselves while figuring out the final part of their plan.\n\nI’d have settled for a film starring these three!\n\nClaire Trevor’s character is a night club singer and she delivers a Howard Dietz/Arthur Schwartz song, ‘Till You Return’, dubbed by Connie Russell.\n\nPoor Hedy is mere decoration, as the devoted wife.\n\nFelix Bressart plays Powell’s doctor and has a good scene in court with Sig Ruman, as they argue over the meaning of memory loss.\n\nWilliam Powell is never disappointing and, after a string of comedies, it was good to see him in a dramatic role.\n\nThe setting in Paris was typical Hollywood and couldn’t have been less convincing. Why they didn’t just relocate the plot to New York or Los Angeles, I don’t know.\n\nThe plot was used three times within a 4 year period. In 1938, the French film CARREFOUR was directed by Curtis Bernhardt ( Carrefour meaning crossroads).\n\nThen, in 1940, there was a British version called DEAD MAN’s SHOES, starring Leslie Banks.\n\n“Carrefour ” is on You Tube, but, alas, no subtitles.\n\nIt would be interesting to compare the three films.\n\nTwo publicity photos for the film:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
