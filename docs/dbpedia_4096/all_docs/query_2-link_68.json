Preserving the landscape is a priority and as such the Festival tours are limited to 10 cars and/or 20 people. As such, and to maximize the tour opportunity for all who want to go on tours, we suggest that individual drivers who would like to join the caravan, be willing to have others join them in their car for the tour. Please mention this to the Ticket coordinator when you call if you are a “one person” participant and driving.\n\nThe Museum tour coordinator, at the South parking lot where tours leave from, may ask you to participate as outlined above if you are the only one in a vehicle. The Film Festival Board thanks you for your understanding and your cooperation.\n\nFRIDAY OCT 6\n\nFri. 8:00 am – 10:00 am Ansel Adams at Alabama Hills Tour with Thomas Kelsey\n\nJoin photojournalist Thomas Kelsey as he leads us to five specific sites where Ansel Adams captured his timeless images of our beautiful Alabama Hills landscape.

We will post your submission on the Lone Pine Film Festival Facebook page. Note: Some walking over uneven ground is required to reach some locations. Please bring your camera, sunscreen and wear sturdy walking shoes.\n\nFri. 8:15 am – 10:15am Meet the Alabama Hills Tour with Greg Parker\n\nFor newcomers to the Lone Pine Film Festival, or others wishing to reacquaint themselves with the Alabama Hills, this tour is designed to give the visitor a general overview of the diverse roles the Alabamas have played in hundreds of movies and television episodes during the past century. See specially selected locations from several films and TV shows spanning the 1930’s to the 2000’s in genres such as westerns, army, drama, adventure and sci-fi.

Visit the popular sites of the Gunga Din Bridge, Lone Ranger Canyon and Gene Autry rock, and see scenes with famous actors like John Wayne, Gene Autry, Tex Ritter, Jamie Fox, Kevin Bacon, Clayton Moore and others. The variety of different films showcased in this tour makes for a pleasant appreciation of the Alabama Hills as a unique shooting location for generations of Hollywood filmmakers. NOTE: The tour requires a moderate amount of walking, including on uphill and sloping terrain, as well as driving on dirt roads.\n\nMcGee Pack Station – Alabama Hills Scenic Ride.\n\nThursday October 5 12:00 pm – 2:30 pm\n\nFriday October 6 8:30 am – 11:00 am\n\nSaturday October 7 2:00 pm – 4:30 pm (Space is limited – Call NOW! 760-935-4324)\n\nMcGee Creek Pack Station presents a trail ride through the Alabama Hills with Western Film Historian, Douglas Grieve, showing many filming locations along the way.

In addition to clearing his name Banning was also try to convince the miner’s niece (Nan Leslie) that he has her best interests at heart.

Featured in over 450 films, these hills are true unheard storytellers. Learn how millions of years of natural processes shaped them into the iconic terrain we enjoy today. From the Mobius Arch Trailhead we will walk a loop trail and discuss the geologic story of the Alabama Hills. Note: A moderate amount of walking is required, including on uphill sloping terrain. For a more comfortable tour please wear shoes with traction, sunscreen and carry water.\n\nFri. 10:30 am – 12:30 pm Owens River Movie Locations Tour with Greg Parker\n\nBack by popular request! In a fun venture outside of the Alabama Hills this tour will focus on a popular movie filming location northeast of Lone Pine at the Owens River bed, past the old train depot. Before the river was diverted upstream into the California Aqueduct the area was used time and time again for scenes in such films as The Man from Utah (1934) with John Wayne, Between Men (1935) with Johnny Mack Brown, and the Round-up (1920), the earliest surviving movie made in the area. See where scenes from these movies were made, as well as others from Lawless Range (1935), Army Girl (1938), The Nevadan (1950) and many more. This tour is an interesting diversion from the dramatic rocks and boulders of the Alabamas but still a part of the Lone Pine film history experience.

Of the westerns he shot in the Lone Pine area, Hell Bent for Leather is arguably the best. In this film Clay Santell (Murphy) gets mistaken for a psychotic killer named Travers (Jan Merlin). Marshal Harry Deckett (Stephen McNally) is determined to collect the reward money for Travers, even though he knows that Santell is not Travers. The only way for Santell to survive is to find the real Travers, and thereby prove his own innocence. On this tour we’ll go to Hell Bent for Leather and back, following in the footsteps of Audie Murphy, just as Santell traces Travers. NOTE: This tour requires walking through sagebrush including climbing a steep trail up a canyon.\n\nFri . 11:30 am – 2:00 pm (Note: Tour is 2 & 1/2 Hours) Ansel Adams at Manzanar Tour with Thomas Kelsey\n\nBack by Demand, this tour begins with a brief tour of the Manzanar Historic site by a National Park Service Interpretive Ranger, Dr. Patricia Biggs., PhD.

In the meantime, the horse gets loose out in the open range so Gene uses a plane to find him. On this tour we’ll see the area the plane flew over so Gene could lasso the horse from above. We’ll also see where Gene and Champion jumped over Barlow in the car and some exciting scene locations in between.

A video compilation of excerpts precedes our tour of cinematic beauty – with over 20 years of important Western film production. We’ll travel up Lubken Canyon by car caravan to the Lubken spread where we’ll watch for the ghosts of the film’s revered cowboys who’ve made their mark at this spectacular location.

All six films of the so-called “Ranown Cycle” (Seven Men from Now, The Tall T, Decision at Sundown, Buchanan Rides Alone, Ride Lonesome, and Comanche Station) are quality Westerns, and four of them were shot in the Alabama Hills. In Ride Lonesome, one of the best of the bunch, bounty hunter Ben Brigade (Scott) captures a wanted murdered named Billy John (James Best), intending to take him to Santa Cruz to be hanged. The tale of revenge and absolution takes some twists and turns, and we’ll follow those twist and turns quite literally, standing in the footsteps of Scott and Best. As we do, we will also point out some sites from another James Best performance – the little-seen pilot for Red Ryder, which starred Allan “Rocky” Lane and featured Best in a guest role, but was never picked up by a network.

Other locations from the shoot-out scenes will also be visited.

In Ride Lonesome, one of the best of the bunch, bounty hunter Ben Brigade (Scott) captures a wanted murdered named Billy John (James Best), intending to take him to Santa Cruz to be hanged. The tale of revenge and absolution takes some twists and turns, and we’ll follow those twist and turns quite literally, standing in the footsteps of Scott and Best. As we do, we will also point out some sites from another James Best performance – the little-seen pilot for Red Ryder, which starred Allan “Rocky” Lane and featured Best in a guest role, but was never picked up by a network. NOTE: This tour requires walking through sagebrush including hiking a steep trail up a canyon.\n\nREMINDER!!!
