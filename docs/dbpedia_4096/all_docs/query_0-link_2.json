        "text": "Director | Producer Born Sept. 22, 1890 in Pittsburgh, PA\n\nProducer and director Harry Joe Brown was associated with most of the major studios during his career that began in the silent film era and ranged into television.\n\nHis movies included âCaptain Bloodâ with Errol Flynn, âDown Argentine Wayâ with Carmen Miranda, âAlexanderâs Ragtime Band,â \"Moon Over Miamiâ and âJohnny Apollo.â\n\nStarting in 1956, he and star-producer Randolph Scott co-produced six classic \"Ranown westerns,\" directed by Budd Boetticher. They were \"Seven Men From Now\" (1956), \"The Tall T\" and \"Decision at Sundown\" (both 1957), \"Buchanan Rides Alone\" (1958), \"Ride Lonesome\" (1959) and \"Comanche Station\" (1960).\n\nThe Ranowns, with their harsh, opulent landscapes, terrifying bursts of action, cock-eyed absurdist humor and perversely compelling relationships between hero and villain, are tense fables of duty and dishonor. Set in scorching terrains that become corridas for mano-a-mano combat, they gave Boetticher his cinematic cultural icon status in Europe.\n\nBrown also produced the âMr. and Mrs. Northâ and âTopperâ television series.\n\nBrownâs first marriage to actress Salle Eilers ended in divorce. In 1953, he married Dorothy Gray."
