Often grouped under the name Ranown (after producer Harry Joe Brown and Scott’s production company) and colorfully scripted by Burt Kennedy and Charles Lang, these films seem to unfold in a world unto themselves, staking a claim between traditional westerns and the subversive genre revisionism of the 1960s—and representing the crowning achievement of the underappreciated auteur Boetticher.\n\nSIX-DISC 4K UHD + BLU-RAY SPECIAL EDITION FEATURES\n\nNew 4K digital restorations by Sony Pictures Entertainment, with uncompressed monaural soundtracks\n\nThree 4K UHD discs of the films presented in Dolby Vision HDR and three Blu-rays with the films and special features\n\nIntroductions to the films by filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Taylor Hackford\n\nNew introduction by film critic Farran Smith Nehme on actor Randolph Scott\n\nThree audio commentaries, featuring film scholar Jeanine Basinger on The Tall T, film critic Jeremy Arnold on Ride Lonesome, and Hackford on Comanche Station\n\nArchival programs featuring interviews with director Budd Boetticher\n\nAudio conversation with Boetticher and film scholar Jim Kitses\n\nSuper 8 home-movie version of Comanche Station\n\nTrailers\n\nEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing\n\nPLUS: An essay by film scholar Tom GunningNew cover by F.
