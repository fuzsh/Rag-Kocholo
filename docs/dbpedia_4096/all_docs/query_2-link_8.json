        "text": "While I was off in the mountains over Thanksgiving, with no Internet, John, Graham and an assorted cast of characters kept the lights on with a steady stream of comments. Y’all are sure something for me to be thankful for!\n\nAnyway, one of the new released that was name-dropped was The Randolph Scott Collection from Via Vision out of Australia. It’s a pretty eclectic set, leaning towards the Harry Joe Brown pictures.\n\nThe Texans (1938)\n\nDirected by James P. Hogan\n\nStarring Randolph Scott, Joan Bennett, Walter Brennan\n\nA post Civil War picture from Paramount.\n\nWhen The Daltons Rode (1940)\n\nDirected by George Marshall\n\nStarring Randolph Scott, Kay Francis, Brian Donlevy, Broderick Crawford, Andy Devine, George Bancroft, Edgar Buchanan\n\nAbout 80 minutes of nonstop action as the Daltons blast their way from one robbery to the next, with Scott a lawyer friend who tries to help out.\n\nCorvette K-225 (1943)\n\nDirected by Richard Rosson\n\nStarring Randolph Scott, James Brown, Ella Raines, Barry Fitzgerald, Robert Mitchum\n\nHoward Hawks produced this World War II picture, with Scott going after the U-boat that sank his ship and machine-gunned his crew.\n\nGunfighters (1947)\n\nDirected by George Waggner\n\nStarring Randolph Scott, Barbara Britton, Bruce Cabot, Forrest Tucker\n\nA cool Cinecolor picture produced by Harry Joe Brown.\n\nCoroner Creek (1948)\n\nDirected by Ray Enright\n\nStarring Randolph Scott, Marguerite Chapman, George Macready, Edgar Buchanan, Wallace Ford , Forrest Tucker, Joe Sawyer\n\nRay Enright directs that spectacular cast in Cinecolor. It doesn’t get much better than that.\n\nThe Doolins Of Oklahoma (1949)\n\nDirected by Gordon Douglas\n\nStarring Randolph Scott, George Macready, Louise Allbritton, John Ireland , Charles Kemper, Noah Beery Jr.\n\nThis is just a terrific movie that gets everything right.\n\nThe Walking Hills (1949)\n\nDirected by John Sturges\n\nStarring Randolph Scott, Ella Raines, Edgar Buchanan, Arthur Kennedy, John Ireland, Josh White\n\nA group of men head to together in search of a lost wagon train loaded down with gold. Sturges’ does a great job, and the Alabama Hills and Death Valley locations are put to good use.\n\nSanta Fe (1951)\n\nDirected by Irving Pichel\n\nStarring Randolph Scott, Janis Carter\n\nScott’s trying to help build a railroad, with even his own brothers trying to stop him.\n\nMost of these pictures can be found elsewhere — some even on Blu-Ray, so there’s likely some duplication with something you already have. But there’s plenty of good stuff to recommend it. Sure wish there was a Blu-Ray version available, too (especially of Doolins)."
