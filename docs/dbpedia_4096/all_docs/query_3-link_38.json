        "text": "Harry Joe Brown Jr., a real estate executive whose birth into Hollywood royalty presaged the pizazz he generated by enlisting 34 leading architects to design one house each for a Hamptons residential development, died on Wednesday at his Manhattan home. He was 71.\n\nThe cause was complications of prostate cancer, his family said in a statement. Mr. Brown also had a home in West Palm Beach.\n\nIn the mid-1990's, Mr. Brown acquired 56 acres of scrub land in the hamlet of Sagaponack for $1.6 million when another developer went bankrupt. It was supposedly on the wrong side of the Hamptons' main road, too far from the beach and too close to East Hampton Airport.\n\nMr. Brown, widely known by his nickname \"Coco,\" persuaded the architect Richard Meier to recruit a roster of top architects. Mr. Brown's idea was that people with a certain blend of wealth, knowledge and pretension would line up for modernist houses designed by the likes of Mr. Meier, Philip Johnson, Michael Graves and Sir Richard Rogers.\n\nMr. Brown offered lower than normal prices for the Hamptons, less than $3 million, although he also offered less house. Rather than the 10,000-square-foot behemoths of recent years, Mr. Brown thought an exquisitely designed vacation home of 5,000 square feet, even 2,000, would be sufficient.\n\n\"I want to show that every new home here doesn't have to be a McMansion,\" Mr. Brown said in an interview with The New York Times in 2002.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
