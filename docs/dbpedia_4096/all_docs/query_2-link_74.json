        "text": "Ray Enright's Coroner Creek is the first of Randolph Scott's Westerns that hasn't really gripped me from the start, it takes it's time to settle, but becomes a compelling Western with some nice touches. It wasn't Scott's performance , or the direction from Enright who keeps things moving along fairly swiftly, it's the antagonist of the piece, played by George McCready, that lets everything else down. Another revenge story, with Scott this time hunting down the man who killed his fiance, this has Scott doing the thing he does best, with more finesse that you'd expect. His 18 month search is almost over, but will revenge quell his bloodlust and give him peace?\n\nA lot of these films always seem…\n\nRay Enright’s western. After his fiancée is killed in the stagecoach raid which also saw a large army payroll go missing, a gunman (Randolph Scott) vows to track down the man responsible.\n\nAdapted from the novel of the same name by Luke Short, which was published three years earlier, the movie sees Randolph Scott give a good performance in his role as Chris Danning, the man who acts like he is determined to make sure he gets his vengeance on the person who murdered his wife-to-be, but he knows he will have to be careful with himself.\n\nElsewhere, there are decent performances to be had from Marguerite Chapman and George Macready in their respective parts as Kate Hardison and Younger…\n\nBlu-Ray. Western. A man sets out to find the man responsible for the death of his fiancée.\n\nAnother Harry Joe Brown production for Columbia. We can therefore be sure that the quality will be top-notch. Three women will be circling Randolph Scott, trying to make him forget his murdered fiancée. First there's Ella, the widow of a ranch owner who offers him a golden job, then there's Kate, a hotel manager who's single but has to look after her invalid father, and finally there's Abbie, who drowns the disillusionment of her marriage in alcohol.\n\nBut Randolph Scott doesn't have time to listen to these sirens; he has only one fixed idea at the moment: to make suffer and kill the…\n\nNot Randolph Scott's best western, but not too bad either. Scott comes to a town called oddly enough, Coroner Creek, seeking revenge for an unsettled crime, towards a rancher (ex-robber) that he has been seeking for over a year and a half. Although he tries to remain unclear about what his issues with the man are, it is fairly apparent to attentive viewers, and a number of townspeople aren't the rancher's friends either. It doesn't help that the town sheriff, played by Edgar Buchanan (an ex-Oregon dentist who took up Hollywood acting), is looking the other way, because the rancher is married to his daughter. Things start to go south pretty soon after Scott comes to town and works for…\n\nFor reasons I couldn't figure out, Coroner Creek seemed to stretch on for a lot longer than the 90 minutes it actually is. Probably because of having to fast-forward the adverts off TCM, I guess.\n\nOr maybe it's because it lacks the bite of Randolph Scott's Budd Boetticher collaborations. It drags when it should go for the jugular and it doesn't really capitalise enough on George Macready's naturally menacing and threatening air. What I will say for it is that is that it does at least have a solid story behind it, and an even more solid cast.\n\nThe final third is especially strong as Scott sets about putting the blocks into place to smoke Macready out. If you've seen…\n\nFor reasons not entirely known to the viewer at first, Randolph Scott harbors a personal vendetta against a blonde man with a scar on his right cheek. He finally catches up with his quarry in the town of Coroner Creek (likely in Arizona, judging by the beautiful scenery) and sets about antagonizing the man any way he can. As is typical of Scott, however, he proves himself the most polite and gentlemanly angel of vengeance, and quickly makes allies among the townspeople. Coroner Creek bears much resemblance to other Scott collaborations with producer Harry Joe Brown. Dipping into the familiar roster of Randolph Scott Players, Forrest Tucker and George Macready play the heavies, and Edgar Buchanan provides comic relief. What…"
