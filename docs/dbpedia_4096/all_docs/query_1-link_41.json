        "text": "This is a private issue LP of a Friar's club Stag Dinner For Harry Joe Brown. A roast of the film director by his friends George Jessel, George Burns, Jack Benny, and Art Linkletter. Very Funny and suprisingly raunchy for it's time (definitely the only time I have heard George Burns talk about contracting \"Cupid's Eczema\" and drop the F-bomb). I believe it was recorded sometime 50's-very early 60's. The record plays through with minimal crackling. There is a small \"blister\" on side B (see photos) it creates a low pop , but plays through and does not skip (on my technics 1200) Generic white sleeve . (No cover ) white label on album with the letters \"A\" and \"B\" written in pencil on their respective sides .Sold as-is , so please Ask any and all questions before bidding. Thanks !!\n\nOn Harry Joe Brown (from wikipedia):\n\nHarry Joe Brown (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania September 22, 1890-Palm Springs, California April 28, 1972) was a movie producer and supervisor who was also a theatre and film director. Brown died from a heart attack.\n\nAs producer, he was notably involved in the fruitful partnership with director Budd Boetticher, actor Randolph Scott and screenwriter Burt Kennedy which generated a series of fine westerns between 1957 and 1960 (The Tall T, Decision at Sundown, Buchanan Rides Alone, Ride Lonesome, and Comanche Station) through a company he created with Randolph Scott which eventually assumed the name of The Ranown Pictures Corp.\n\nBrown produced the American debut films of both Errol Flynn in Captain Blood and Sean Flynn in Son of Captain Blood."
