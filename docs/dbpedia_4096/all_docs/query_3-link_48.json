Often grouped under the name Ranown (after producer Harry Joe Brown and Scott's production company), these films seem to unfold in a world unto themselves, staking a claim between traditional Westerns and the subversive genre revisionism of the 1960s — and representing the crowning achievement of the underappreciated auteur Boetticher. In RIDE LONESOME — perhaps the bleakest of the series — mysterious motivations drive taciturn bounty hunter Ben Brigade (Randolph Scott) to capture a wanted murderer. But his quest is complicated when he is accosted by a pair of outlaws who have their own inscrutable reasons for riding along. Masterfully scripted by Burt Kennedy, and featuring supporting turns by James Coburn (in his film debut) and Lee Van Cleef, the first of the Ranown Westerns shot in CinemaScope makes striking use of the enlarged frame — with a final shot that stands as perhaps the single most unforgettable image in the series.
