        "text": "I like them all very much. I do wish that the costume designer for Comanche Station would have had more sense to know that Comanches didn’t have Pawnee/Mohawk-style haircuts though!\n\nI already have good DVDs with all of these films, so I don’t think I’ll be picking up the Criterion box. But I’m sure they’ll do a lovely job with the transfers\n\nActually 7 westerns, and their first one 7 Men from Now is usually viewed as part of the Ranown cycle, even if it was not produced by Brown. Too bad that again it was not possible to release all 6 together,\n\nThe 7th one Westbound (1959) is on the other hand only a minor b-picture, watchable, but nothing special. It also lacks the thematic connections of the others.\n\nOh! The Criterion just counts from The Tall T to Comanche Station. Westbound, being WB, would be a pain in the butt to include. Thanks for the info!\n\nI have seen neither Seven Men From Now nor Westbound. I watched them on this Mill Creek thing. It included a mediocre one (A Lawless Street), though cleverly directed, was kinda ham-fisted.\n\nYes, the name Ranown comes from the producers company, and stands for Randolph Scott and Harry Joe Brown. Brown produced also some earlier films with Scott, but but they don’t belong to the Ranown films.\n\nBut 7 Men from Now does (despite produced by John Wayne’s Batjac for Warner Bros), cause its a blue-print for the 5 films to follow, especially for the other 3 also written by Burt Kennedy."
