        "text": "UCLA's restoration of Budd Boetticher's masterpiece Seven Men from Now, long presumed lost, has caused a resurgence of interest in the man whom Georges Sadoul three decades ago called \"the best director of modern westerns.\" Boetticher has been honored in recent tributes at the American Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Festival, and in articles in Film Comment, Sight & Sound, and the New York Times. Between 1956 and 1960 Boetticher made seven B westerns with Randolph Scott, variously written by Burt Kennedy and produced by Harry Joe Brown, the so-called Ranown Cycle: Seven Men from Now, The Tall T, Decision at Sundown, Westbound, Buchanan Rides Alone, Ride Lonesome, and Comanche Station. The Times's Richard T. Jameson wrote: \"(T)hese films constitute one of the most elegant and esteemed bodies of work in American film, whose spiritual and stylistic rigorousness had critics reaching for parallels in The Odyssey and The Canterbury Tales. The series remains (one of) the most remarkable convergence(s) of artistic achievement in the history of low-budget moviemaking.\""
