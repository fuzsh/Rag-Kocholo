        "text": "Hyfler/Rosner\n\nThe New York Times\n\nNovember 27, 2005 Sunday\n\nPaid Notice: Deaths\n\nBROWN--Harry Joe, Jr., 1934 - 2005. Affectionately known by\n\nhis friends as ''Coco,'' real estate developer,\n\nscreenwriter, and former film and theater producer, died\n\nthis past Wednesday, November 23. He was 71 years old and\n\nlived partly in West Palm Beach, FL, and partly in New York\n\nCity, where he died at home with his family around him after\n\na courageous battle with cancer. Mr. Brown, who came from a\n\nprominent Hollywood family--his father was the\n\nproducer/director Harry Joe Brown and his mother was the\n\nscreen star Sally Eilers--first made his mark in the\n\ntheatrical world in the late '50s and the early '60s with\n\noriginal, award-winning New York productions of works by\n\nEdward Albee, Samuel Beckett, Jean Anouilh, and Tennessee\n\nWilliams.\n\nIn subsequent years Mr. Brown was in charge of a creative\n\ndevelopment program for Twentieth Century Fox and had an\n\noriginal screenplay, Duffy, produced by Columbia Pictures in\n\n1970. Duffy was also published as a novel. Educated at\n\nPhillips Exeter Academy, Stanford, and Yale, where he\n\ngraduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, Mr. Brown went\n\non to earn an master's degree at Oxford University under a\n\nMarshall Scholarship. With a keen instinct for real estate\n\nvalue, Mr. Brown made his first foray into development with\n\na large and lucrative residential sub-division project\n\ncalled Mulholland Estates above Beverly Hills. Over the next\n\nthree decades he assembled a highly eclectic portfolio of\n\nlargely commercial real estate in many parts of the U.S. as\n\nwell as in South America, Europe, and Canada. But Mr. Brown\n\nwould undoubtedly be best remembered for his conversion of a\n\nfailed housing development in the hamlet of Sagaponac, NY,\n\ninto an historic showcase of architecture called The Houses\n\nof Sagaponac. With curatorial assistance from architect\n\nRichared Meier, Mr. Brown assembled thirty four of the most\n\ntalented architects practicing today, both seasoned and new,\n\nto design Hampton weekend homes which were aesthetically\n\nfresh, sensibly sized, and relatively affordable, going\n\nagainst the current trend of affluent house design that\n\nemphasized size and strayed away from innovative design. Mr.\n\nBrown is survived by his partner Catherine Nelson Brown, his\n\nformer wife Karen Dempsey, his two daughters Morgan Brown\n\nand Esme Brown, of Beverly Hills and Manhattan respectively,\n\nand a grandson, Remington Rivers. Mr. Brown was predeceased\n\nby his first wife Marcia Stillman. The family will be\n\nreceiving friends at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076\n\nMadison Avenue, on Monday, November 28, 2005, from 7 to 9\n\npm, with a memorial service to be held at a future date. The\n\nfamily has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations may\n\nbe made in the name of Harry J. Brown, Jr. to the charity of\n\nyour choice."
