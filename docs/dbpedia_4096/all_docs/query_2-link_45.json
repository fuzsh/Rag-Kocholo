        "text": "(Courtesy of Jack Tillmany)\n\nReed Howes - circa early 1920s.\n\nAbove from the October 18, 1924 issue of the Exhibitors Trade Review.\n\n(Courtesy of Les Adams)\n\nReed Howes - circa 1943 and about 43 years of age.\n\n(Courtesy of Ed Tabor)\n\nBorn in Washington, D.C. in 1900, Hermon Reed Howes served in the Navy during World War I.\n\nHowes biographies mention his graduation from the University of Utah and attendance or graduation from Harvard. That college time is questionable. We know that 19 year old Reed was a bookkeeper and living in Utah with his parents at the time of the 1920 census. About 2 1/2 years later, he was in Hollywood.\n\nA good looking gent, he became one of 1920s \"Arrow Collar Men\" who modeled Arrow shirts in print advertisements. It appears that Howes \"tied the knot\" at least three times - in the census and other data at the bottom of this webpage, he was divorced at the time of the 1930 census. Then there's 1932 and 1937 marriages.\n\nThe earliest tradezine mention that I found was in the November 11, 1922 issue of Exhibitors Trade Review. The article headline read: \"Arrow Will Issue 'High Speed Lee,' with Reed Howes\"; and an excerpt from that article: \"... a society drama made by Atlantic Productions and featuring Reed Howes, who, according to all reports, is now being groomed as a successor in the type of roles in which Douglas Fairbanks made his screen debut.\"\n\nAround the time that Howes turned up in Hollywoodland, W. Ray Johnston was forming Rayart Pictures. Johnston was a major player in the independent market, and by the late 1920s, Rayart disappeared and became Syndicate Film Exchange. A few years afterwards, he and Trem Carr established Monogram Pictures, and both Johnston, Carr and Monogram were part of the formation of Republic Pictures in 1935. During the mid to late 1920s, there were dozens of westerns, non-westerns and serials created by various production units operating under - or contracted with - the Rayart company. Harry S. Webb - who would partner up with Bernard B. Ray in the 1930s to create Reliable Pictures - was doing \"Rayart Whirlwind Westerns\" with Jack Perrin. Kermit Maynard, Ken's younger brother, was billed as \"Tex Maynard\" in another batch of \"Rayart Whirlwind Westerns\" for producer Trem Carr. Howes signed with producer and director Harry Joe Brown and during the years 1925-1929, he starred in about two dozen comedies, melodramas, westerns and aerial adventures, initially for Rayart and continuing at Educational Pictures.\n\nThere were a few opportunities in bigger films at bigger production companies:\n\nHowes was loaned out to play opposite Clara Bow in the lost/missing ROUGH HOUSE ROSIE (Paramount, 1927).\n\nanother loan out got him a credited role in the Al Jolson THE SINGING FOOL (Warners, 1928).\n\nhe was the hero of the lost/missing TERRY OF THE TIMES (Universal, 1930), a ten episode cliffhanger that included some sound elements but no dialog.\n\nThere's an article in the July, 1927 issue of Motion Picture magazine about various Hollywood divorces, and there's mention of Reed and his former wife Lillian who were still on friendly terms and attending social events together. In addition, Howes seemed to recognize the frailty of being a hero in small films for the independent market. In the article, he says:\n\n\"... according to his own description, (Howes is) the most 'unknown celebrity in captivity', due to the fact that his stellar activities take place on the screens of little towns.\"\n\nWhen talkies arrived, Howes found that only a few leading man roles were being offered. Examples:\n\nIn 1932, Sono-Art/World Wide churned out \"Thrill-O-Dramas\" starring Howes, Rex Lease, Grant Withers, Kenneth Harlan, more. In DEVIL ON DECK (Sono-Art/World Wide, 1932), it was Howes and Molly O'Day vs. Wheeler Oakman in a tale about sailing ships and being shanghaied.\n\nReed was in St. Petersburg, Florida circa 1933 doing a couple low budget movies for Aubrey Kennedy's production company - the films are CHLOE (1933) and PLAYTHINGS OF DESIRE (1933).\n\nhe was the hero of the twelve chapter QUEEN OF THE JUNGLE (Screen Attractions, 1935), a cliffhanger that I vaguely recall for the liberal use of old silent jungle stock footage and onetime \"Our Gang\" member Mary Kornman as the heroine.\n\nIn the July, 1936 issue of Motion Picture magazine, there's a tidbit about \"old-timers\" and \"once-stars\" hired for (THE AMAZING EXPLOITS OF) THE CLUTCHING HAND (Weiss/Stage & Screen, 1936):\n\n\"... Clutching Hand serial, a remake of the one which starred Pearl White 20 years ago, will bring a lot of old-timers back in your eye. On the sets I noticed such once-stars as Bryant Washburn, William Farnum, Rex Lease, Jack Mulhall, Franklyn Farnum, Mae Busch, Reed Howes and Gaston Glass!\"\n\nTo stay busy and keep bread on the table, Howes had no choice but to shift to support and bit parts, much of which are henchman roles in various oaters. Les Adams has him in about 200 sound films - 117 were westerns and 27 were chapterplays. He appeared in about 30 films at Republic Pictures during the period 1937-1950, and approximately two-thirds were cowboy flicks and the remainder were serials.\n\nMany of the B western and serial players were NOT great with dialog delivery. I've always rated Howes low in this category - his voice and personality seemed to have no zip, no \"pizzazz\". And since he lacked charisma - and didn't have the bulk or menace of a Harry Woods, Roy Barcroft or Fred Kohler - he wound up relegated to lesser roles, oftentimes portraying a henchman.\n\nHe does a good job as John Wayne's buddy in THE DAWN RIDER (Lone Star/Monogram, 1935). In that, Wayne and Howes battle a gang run by Yakima Canutt and a young Dennis Moore (still going by the name of Denny Meadows). In the chapterplay CUSTER'S LAST STAND (Stage and Screen, 1936), Howes plays a crooked saloon owner searching for an Indian medicine arrow that could lead to a cave of gold.\n\nIn the early 1950s, he was among many who transitioned to television and appeared in episodes of WILD BILL HICKOK, THE GENE AUTRY SHOW, ANNIE OAKLEY, CISCO KID, WYATT EARP, SGT. PRESTON, more. He had a recurring role as the sheriff in THE ROY ROGERS TV show (Harry Harvey Sr. also played the lawman on the Roy and Dale TV show). Among his last movies was a bit as a police inspector in THE SINISTER URGE (1960), one of the z grade horror flicks churned out by Ed Wood, Jr. (PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and others).\n\nLes Adams reminded me about Howes showing up in many of Randolph Scott's films - possibly as a stand-in ... or he was just a friend ... or it was just a casting accident. The answer may be Harry Joe Brown, the producer/director of Howes' starring silents in the 1920s. Brown did a bunch of Randolph Scott oaters, and Howes picked up a days pay doing minor bits in many of those. In the 1950s, Harry Joe Brown partnered with Scott and formed a production company named Ranown (a combination of RANdolph and brOWN). Writer Burt Kennedy and director Budd Boetticher were added to the team, and their collective output brought us many of Scott's best westerns.\n\nHowes's movie and TV career spanned forty+ years, from about 1922 through the early 1960s.\n\nHe passed away at the Motion Picture Home and Hospital, Woodland Hills, California on August 6, 1964. World War I Navy veteran Hermon Reed Howes is interred at the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery, San Diego, California.\n\nAlthough some of the data is incomplete or inaccurate, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) has information on Reed Howes: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0398139/\n\nThe Internet Movie Database has a People Working Together search function:\n\nHowes and producer Harry Joe Brown worked together in about fifty films and TV shows during the period 1925-1958: https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?role=nm0398139,nm0113693\n\nHowes and Randolph Scott worked together in 17 films during the period 1940-1957: https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?role=nm0398139,nm0000068\n\nAt the Internet Archive, you can view/download CHLOE, a voodoo tale starring Olive Borden, Reed Howes and Molly O'Day. The print is not very good. And this NOT politically correct film is really terrible: https://archive.org/details/ChloeLoveIsCallingYou1934\n\nFind A Grave website has a photo of the grave marker of World War I Navy veteran Hermon Reed Howes at the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery, San Diego, California, The marker notes he was born in Washington D.
