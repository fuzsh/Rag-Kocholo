Weak writing and heavy-handed direction by Robert Parrish, eliciting only tepid performances, combine to snuff out much interest before the genuinely perky climax.\n\nJames Mason is a cold, calculating industrialist, loathed heartily by his sons, James Fox (who needs dad’s money to pay for his hedonistic excesses) and John Alderton (who simply needs someone to rescue him from stupid blunders). Susannah York has some sort of affair going with Fox. Trio recruits drifter James Coburn to help with a money heist, designed to make them independently wealthy and also to embarrass Mason.\n\nFox’s interpretation of his role is so swish (with costumes to match) that one wonders what attractions he holds for York. York in addition looks different in practically every setup. Only Alderton, who plays broadly to the pit, has what seems a definite concept of his part. Coburn tries awfully hard to be a hippie."
