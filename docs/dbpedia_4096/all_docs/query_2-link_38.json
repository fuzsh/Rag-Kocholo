        "text": "The Ranown Westerns: Five Films Directed by Budd Boetticher, almost two years after their Blu-ray debuts in Mill Creek's Randolph Scott Collection, takes the featured films to 4K Ultra HD.\n\nBack Cover Synopsis[]\n\nThe five briskly entertaining, vividly performed westerns made by director Budd Boetticher and strapping star Randolph Scott in the second half of the 1950s transcend their B-movie origins to become rich, unexpectedly profound explorations of loyalty, greed, honor, and revenge. Often grouped under the name Ranown (after producer Harry Joe Brown and Scott’s production company) and colorfully scripted by Burt Kennedy and Charles Lang, these films seem to unfold in a world unto themselves, staking a claim between traditional westerns and the subversive genre revisionism of the 1960s—and representing the crowning achievement of the underappreciated auteur Boetticher.\n\nChapters[]\n\nThe Tall T[]\n\nTBA\n\nDecision at Sundown[]\n\nTBA\n\nBuchanan Rides Alone[]\n\nTBA\n\nRide Lonesome[]\n\nTBA\n\nComanche Station[]\n\nTBA\n\nSupplements[]\n\nTBA\n\nImage Gallery[]\n\nArtwork[]\n\nTBA\n\nVMGM Menus[]\n\nMenu and Sprites[]\n\nTBA"
