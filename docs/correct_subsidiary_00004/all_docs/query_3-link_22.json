The company also developed server software, including the Netscape Commerce Server and Netscape Communications Server. Funding Details: Netscape went public in 1995, and its initial public offering (IPO) is considered one of the most successful in history.

After its acquisition by AOL, Netscape was merged with the AOL Browser team to form the Mozilla Foundation in 2003.
