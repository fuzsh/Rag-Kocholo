        "text": "Author: Alan C. Dube\n\nDate: 2/23/97\n\nLiterature Review of Groupware Issues\n\nIntroduction\n\nBurns (1996) defines \"groupware\" as computer software that\n\nsupports groups of people engaged in a common task, providing an\n\ninterface to a shared environment. Groupware has rapidly become\n\nan important catalyst for organizational change and innovation,\n\nfostering new collaborative links within corporations and\n\neliminating many of the barriers that have hindered productive\n\ncommunication in the past (Manasco, 1995). However, groupware is\n\nsubject to some of the same pitfalls and problems as other\n\ncomputer-based systems. Although technical issues can and do\n\naffect groupware implementation and performance, many issues\n\nsurrounding groupware failures and inefficiencies emanate from\n\nproblems in managing the collaborative framework of groupware\n\napplications, as well as the corporate culture itself.\n\nThis project studies groupware issues by conducting a\n\ncomprehensive literature review on problems and topics related to\n\ngroupware, and the management of groupware applications. The\n\nreview discusses the contents (in annotated bibliography format)\n\nof 100 sources (i.e., books, articles, and papers) related to\n\ngroupware, notes how these sources were found, summarizes the\n\nfindings in the literature, and draws conclusions based on the\n\ninformation contained within the sources. The goal of the\n\nproject is to provide insight into areas of research that will\n\nimpact the use of groupware, assist the author in defining and\n\nnarrowing areas of probable dissertation research, and intern\n\ncontribute to the field of information systems management.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nAdhikari (1996) surveyed the current groupware market,\n\ndiscussing the capabilities of products like Lotus Notes,\n\nNovell's Groupwise, Microsoft Exchange, and Netscape's\n\nCommunicator client. Adhikari found that many companies, like\n\nBellSouth Advertising & Publishing Corporation, are choosing to\n\nrun groupware applications over their corporate intranets,\n\nbecause intranets are more cost effective than conventional\n\ngroupware products and offer a Web-based interface that is easier\n\nto use.\n\nAhuja (1992), through advanced study at AT&T Bell\n\nLaboratories, proposed that both asynchronous and synchronous\n\nmultimedia communications are necessary to support collaborative\n\ncomputing at a distance. Ahuja suggests that remote\n\ncollaboration requires integrated media that must be transparent,\n\ninterruptable, and shareable for a successful implementation.\n\nGroupware is the software that facilitates group efforts.\n\nAllison (1992) studied organizational issues involved with\n\ngroupware, noting that groupware can be used for decision making\n\nor the collaborative development of complex systems. The author\n\nstressed that groupware must be tailored to the needs of the\n\norganization using the product, and that groupware can be\n\nconsidered \"glueware\" when it is used to hold together or link a\n\nnumber of different application programs.\n\nAnderson (1991) looked at the nature of \"groupwork\" by\n\nrunning several experiments on computer-mediated communications.\n\nThe author recognized that computer systems affect the social\n\nconditions of work groups, and that in order for groupware to be\n\nsuccessful in an organization, it must incorporate the social\n\naspects of communication in its design and implementation.\n\nBannon, Bjorn-Anderson, and Due-Thomsen (1988) appraised the\n\nfield of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), providing\n\nbackground and definitions for the concept of CSCW. Bannon, et\n\nal. noted that CSCW is growing rapidly and that there are\n\ndistinct problems insuring the effectiveness of groupware\n\nimplementations.\n\nIn their examination on the assumptions in the name\n\n\"Computer Supported Cooperative Work\" (CSCW), Bannon and Schmidt\n\n(1991) identified core issues of articulating cooperative work,\n\nsharing an \"information space,\" and adapting the technology to\n\nthe organization. The authors concluded that CSCW is a valid\n\nrepresentation of the research area and that there is much work\n\nto be done to address a variety of CSCW issues.\n\nThe Automated Office Metaphor, and described by Benest and\n\nDukic (1993), places emphasis on the ability to share captured\n\nand computed information. Through the use of electronic office\n\nforms, Benest and Dukic found that information sharing can\n\nultimately turn into a conferencing system. The authors\n\nconcluded, however, that conferencing systems are not without a\n\nseries of implementation issues that must be addressed through\n\nfurther study.\n\nBenton and Devlin (1993) reviewed the evolution of work\n\ngroup automation, discussing problems and providing some examples\n\nof how systems can be implemented in a Hypertext environment.\n\nBenton and Devlin found that most of the systems fail because\n\nthey do not consider problems that are unique to working in the\n\nnetworked environment and concluded that better cognitive models\n\nare needed. The models include social structure, politics, and\n\ngroup dynamics.\n\nBigdoli (1996) examined several major software vendor\n\nsolutions for Group Support Systems (GSS) and found that when\n\ncompanies tried to implement the technology, the results were not\n\nalways successful. Bigdoli concluded that to successfully use\n\nGSS technology, the capabilities of the GSS must be appropriately\n\nmatched with a decision-making group's needs, and management must\n\nsupport and champion the use of the technology within the\n\norganization.\n\nBlum (1996) examined pricing issues associated with\n\ngroupware products, noting that all of the major packages (e.g.,\n\nNotes, Exchange, Groupwise, and Collabra Share) cost about $50 to\n\n$75 per client seat. Blum suggests that although groupware\n\nproducts are relatively inexpensive, IS managers should avoid\n\nmixing different vendors' client and server technologies in order\n\nto avert a potential loss in functionality throughout the\n\nimplementation.\n\nBock and Marca (1995), in their book entitled Designing\n\nSoftware, discuss a variety of social, technical, and human\n\nfactors that must be considered when designing software. Bock\n\nand Marca note that software developers must differentiate\n\nbetween products that are to be used by one person from those to\n\nbe used by a group, as the usage, feedback, and control\n\nmechanisms involved need completely different sets of\n\nrequirements and functionality.\n\nBock and Marshak (1994) studied the interactions and\n\ndiscourse involved with several forms of electronic conferencing,\n\nincluding on-line meetings, discussion databases, and knowledge\n\ncapture environments. Bock and Marshak found that electronic\n\nconferences often provide a framework for organizing business\n\nactivities, serving as an entry point for structuring day-to-day\n\nwork in a business environment. The authors concluded that any\n\ngroupware tool used to structure such activities should have\n\nproper browsing, notification, security, document handling,\n\naging, and subject-search capabilities.\n\nMany companies are trying to decide which groupware product\n\nto adopt and implement. Booker (1996) interviewed the chief\n\ninformation officer (CIO) of Watson Wyatt Worldwide to get the\n\nspecifics of why the CIO decided upon Collabra Share over Lotus\n\nNotes. Booker found that the CIO chose Collabra Share because it\n\nwas cheaper, easier to install and maintain, and had a graphic\n\ninterface similar to Watson Wyatt's existing e-mail platform\n\n(Lotus' cc: Mail). Booker noted that while many companies\n\nrequire the sophistication that a tool like Lotus Notes provides,\n\nothers are adopting less daunting products, forgoing\n\nfunctionality for better price and easier integration with\n\nexisting network and messaging systems.\n\nBorg (1996) looked at the current offerings in the groupware\n\nmarket and studied how businesses are trying to introduce the\n\nproducts into a team-based environment. Borg found that many\n\ngroupware applications have evolved from mere messaging and\n\ncollaboration vehicles to fully powered workgroup applications\n\nthat integrate a Web browser. Borg surmised that Web-enabled\n\ngroupware allows business teams to make the collaboration process\n\neasier and more efficient, providing users with platform\n\nindependence and the ability to reap the benefits of the Internet\n\nand corporate Intranets as well.\n\nBostrom, Watson, and Kinney (1992), in their book entitled\n\nComputer augmented teamwork: A guide tour, studied group systems\n\ntechnology, electronic meeting technologies, and work group\n\nsupport structures. Bostrom et al. stress that all collaborative\n\nsystems and computer support must be tailored to the\n\norganization, and concluded that products that allow for easy\n\ninstallation, customization, maintenance, and integration with\n\nexisting systems will win out over their competition in the end.\n\nBullin and Benet (1991) interviewed 223 people in 25\n\norganizations to determine how groupware systems were being\n\nutilized. In doing so, the authors attempted to understand the\n\nvalue that the technology brings to the office environment.\n\nBullin and Benet concluded that groupware was indeed living up to\n\nits promise for the most part, providing tools that can be used\n\nby workgroups to facilitate the exchange and sharing of\n\ninformation. The information, however, must be actively managed.\n\nBurns (1996) conducted more than 75 telephone surveys with\n\ninformation systems (IS) personnel at large organizations in\n\nNorth America to find out how companies use groupware, and why\n\nthey are using it. Burns found that groupware use had grown\n\nrapidly within corporations because the infrastructure necessary\n\nto support it has been widely implemented, desktop computers have\n\nsufficient horsepower to permit use of a variety of collaborative\n\ncomputing features, and companies have turned their attention\n\naway from the personal aspect of computing towards workgroup\n\nbased computing. The author concluded that groupware will\n\ncontinue to flourish as corporations continue to downsize, strive\n\nto improve their customer service, reduce their costs, and\n\nrespond more rapidly to changing market conditions.\n\nButterfield, Rathnam, and Whinston (1992) conducted a survey\n\nto measure people's perceptions of the field of groupware. The\n\nsurvey was administered by electronic mail and asked simple\n\nquestions concerning user perceptions. The authors found that\n\nusers had high hopes for the technology, but were skeptical of\n\nits practical value and implementation. Butterfield, et al.\n\nconcluded that the technology needs to be further researched, and\n\nprovided suggested directions for doing so.\n\nChawla and Renesch (1995), in their work entitled Learning\n\norganizations: Developing cultures for tomorrow's workplace,\n\nexplored the use of feedback and reward mechanisms for\n\nimplementing collaborative cultures in today's corporate\n\nenvironments. The authors discussed problems with the\n\n\"protection\" of information for job security, and concluded that\n\nmanagement must overcome this protective human nature by\n\nincorporating changes in the corporate culture to encourage,\n\nrather than discourage, cooperation and information sharing.\n\nCole (1996) conducted a study of companies that use Lotus\n\nNotes, interviewing 1,500 end users. Cole found that many firms\n\nare failing to tap into the full potential of the collaborative\n\nplatform, using Notes primarily for e-mail. Only half of the\n\nusers interviewed said they regularly used Notes discussion\n\ndatabases, and only 14 percent used workflow applications at\n\nleast 3 times a week. Cole concluded that management and\n\ncorporate issues, not the Notes technology itself, were the\n\nprimary reasons for disuse and suggests that the issues\n\ndiscovered in the study apply to all groupware applications.\n\nStudies within companies that have implemented groupware\n\nsystems show a culture shift can occur within the organization.\n\nTo understand this occurrence, Coleman (1992) discussed the types\n\nof: groupware that are available, organizations affected, and\n\ncollaborative processes utilized. Coleman concluded that\n\ncollaborative groupware allows individuals to act anonymously,\n\nthus increasing participation, improving the quality and quantity\n\nof workgroup output, and helping to achieve consensus.\n\nColeman (1995) continued his work on collaborative computing\n\nin his book entitled Groupware: Technology and applications.\n\nColeman continued to analyze how groupware technology has evolved\n\nand how organizations are applying it, finding that the\n\ntechnology alone cannot guarantee the success of an\n\nimplementation. Coleman suggests that groupware technology must\n\ncompliment, not replace, the corporate culture in which it\n\noperates. Management and end-user acceptance of this new\n\ncomputing paradigm is essential for its successful application.\n\nCook, Birch, Murphy, and Woolsey (1991) created software\n\nmodels that were used in group experiments to explore ideas on\n\nhow distributed systems could enhance the effectiveness of group\n\ncommunications, including support for planning and completion of\n\ncooperative tasks. The authors found that a variety of\n\narchitectural issues, as well as the capabilities of the software\n\nitself, are large factors in the acceptance or rejection of\n\ngroupware in a team-based scenario.\n\nThe use of groupware is not limited only to the IBM\n\ncompatible computing platforms. Dale (1993) studied groupware\n\nsystems running on the Macintosh network. In the paper, Dale\n\ndiscussed the issues for both technical and human-computer\n\ninteraction, and compared commonly expressed views of groupware\n\nwith real-world experiments. Dale concluded that although there\n\nare many benefits to using this type of software application,\n\nthere are also many problems that warrant further study.\n\nDallas (1995), in Special Edition Using Collabra Share,\n\nanalyzed how Netscape's Collabra Share product could be used to\n\nmake teams more productive. Dallas looked at how \"knowledge\"\n\nworkers function within an organization, collectively utilizing a\n\ncorporate knowledgebase to store and share ideas. Dallas\n\ndiscovered that products like Collabra Share make corporate\n\nlearning almost automatic because it helps to capture and\n\ncategorize information, provide a common frame of reference for\n\nfuture discussions, and with some discipline, be used for the\n\ntracking of procedural steps in a workflow application. Dallas\n\nconcluded that upper management must be persuaded to re-engineer\n\nfundamental business processes using groupware to help employees\n\nsee the value of sharing their knowledge, thus changing their\n\nattitudes about cooperation in the workplace.\n\nDavenport (1993), in his book entitled Process innovation:\n\nRe-engineering work through information technology, seems to\n\nsupport Dallas' view of the role technology plays in re-\n\nengineering the corporation. Davenport used case studies to\n\nexamine how corporations are re-engineering their business\n\npractices through the introduction of new information technology.\n\nDavenport found that with proper execution and management\n\nsupport, new computing technologies can reshape the way\n\ncorporations conduct business, and make them more competitive as\n\nthe \"new\" culture adapts to the re-engineered company.\n\nDix, Finlay, Abowd, and Beale (1993) in their book entitled\n\nHuman-computer Interaction, discuss how the human-computer\n\ninterface has adapted over time, and provides extensive\n\ninformation on groupware frameworks and implementation. Dix et\n\nal. also address CSCW issues and theory. The authors concluded\n\nthat groupware remains to be proven as a valuable tool for\n\ncommunication, and needs to adapt to future computing\n\nrequirements in order to flourish.\n\nSuccessful collaboration requires awareness of both\n\nindividual and group activities, and a reconciliation of the\n\nseparate work spaces. CSCW systems support this with information\n\nsystems that effectively separate themselves from the shared\n\ndomains. Dourish and Bellotti (1992) discussed a study of\n\npassive awareness mechanisms that allow users to be aware of and\n\nexploit information through a shared environment, while avoiding\n\nproblems with active approaches. Dourish and Bellotti found that\n\nwhen the correct discipline is used, users can indeed move\n\nbetween lose and close collaboration and coordinate work\n\ndynamically.\n\nDragoon (1996) examined the dilemma CIOs have in choosing\n\nbetween proprietary groupware systems and a Web-based intranet\n\nfor their group communication needs. Dragoon found that the\n\ndistinction between products like Lotus Notes and Web products is\n\nbeginning to blur. Dragoon concluded that for companies that\n\nrequire high levels of security, workflow capabilities, or\n\ndatabase replication, Notes is the product of choice. For\n\norganizations that need to share information remotely and for\n\nwhom security and workflow capabilities are not important issues,\n\nan internal Web site offers an inexpensive solution.\n\nThe meaning of groupware is extremely difficult to pin down\n\nas it means many things to different people. Dressler (1992)\n\ndiscussed the need to establish complimentary and highly\n\ndeveloped delivery channels for groupware and groupware\n\napplications. Dressler used the Novell Corporation as an example\n\nof how delivery channels worked, thus fostering the LAN industry.\n\nDyson (1992), classified groupware as information or\n\nworkflow oriented with user-centered, work-centered, or process-\n\ncentered categories. The author found that groupware could be\n\nused as a tool for change in an organization, and provided a new\n\nframework for structuring groupware applications.\n\nEllis, Gibbs, and Rein (1991) conducted a thorough\n\nexamination of various design issues facing groupware developers\n\nin three key areas: communication, collaboration, and\n\ncoordination. Ellis et al. found that there are several\n\ndifferent groupware taxonomies and various perspectives from\n\nwhich several collaborative systems were created. The authors\n\nconcluded that a gap between synchronous and asynchronous work\n\nmust be bridged by integrating telecommunications and computer\n\ntechnologies, creating shared environments with updated group\n\ncontext and individual user action notification, and coordinating\n\nthe actions of multiple users to avoid conflicts or repetition.\n\nEnglebart (1992) considers groupware as a means to an end\n\nfor creating high performance human organizations. Engelbart\n\ndiscussed the complexity of implementing groupware changes that\n\ncould play an evolutionary role in organizational development.\n\nEnglebart proposed four groupware architectural requirements:\n\nglobal and individual vocabulary control; multiple look and feel\n\ninterfaces; shared-window teleconferencing; and linkage between\n\nHypertext-based documents and other data systems.\n\nForman (1991) identified and discussed basic groupware\n\nissues for the 1990s and posed numerous questions to drive future\n\nresearch. Forman found that groupware research by social\n\npsychologists and information systems specialists usually viewed\n\ncollaborative writing the same as other group work. Forman\n\ncalled for composition specialists to become more actively\n\nengaged in groupware technology development through cross-\n\ndisciplinary research on computing and collaborative writing.\n\nGagne (1996) surveyed 25 groupware users at Fortune 500\n\ncompanies to measure the impact the proliferation of the Internet\n\nhas had on their groupware strategies. Gagne found that many IS\n\nmanagers emphatically support their groupware selection and have\n\nno interest in switching products at this stage. IS managers are\n\nexcited about Internet technology, but are also wary of it.\n\nGagne concluded that although the Internet can and will affect\n\ngroupware selection, groupware users are more interested in\n\nsmooth connections to the Internet, avoiding multiple groupware\n\nsolutions, and firm decisions that support the current and\n\nplanned infrastructure at their respective organizations.\n\nGalegher and Kraut (1992) compared the validity of\n\ncontingency theory and adaptive structuration theory through a\n\nstudy of collaborative student writers who were given a choice of\n\ncommunication media. Galegher and Kraut found that students\n\npreferred face-to-face communication over computer communication,\n\nespecially when integrating and planning their work. The results\n\nconfirmed the general validity of contingency theory in that\n\nmatches between task and communication medium occur spontaneously\n\nand contribute to the effectiveness of task performance. The\n\nstudy acknowledged some aspects of adaptive structuration theory\n\nand suggested further research to study human behavioral\n\nadaptation in specific technological environments.\n\nGershman and Sato (1994) discussed a framework to help\n\ndefine what group communication products are most useful and\n\nproductive. Gershman and Sato proposed a framework that maps\n\ncommunication systems against group business interactions.\n\nGery (1991) surveyed currently available IS technology to\n\nshow how it could be used to improve productivity in an\n\norganization. Gery concluded that companies need to adopt and\n\nstick with a technology, and not be driven by fear of\n\nobsolescence -- as this fear represents an opportunity cost that\n\ncould be damaging to the corporation in the long run.\n\nGilbert (1993) discussed CSCW and showed that it is now\n\npossible using existing infrastructures. The author described\n\ncase studies of good and bad experiences, and was surprised that\n\nCSCW has been possible for over the past ten years. Gilbert,\n\nhowever, concluded that CSCW is rarely practiced today and\n\nsuggests that further investigative research be conducted to\n\nfound out why this is so.\n\nGronbech, Kyng, and Morgensen (1992) investigated the CSCW\n\naspects of large-scale technical projects in a Danish engineering\n\ncompany. The authors found problems and bottlenecks in daily\n\nwork and collaboration activities, including tasks involving the\n\nsharing of materials, issuance of tasks, and status tracking.\n\nGronbech et al. concluded the study by uncovering several\n\nchallenges for the implementation of a collaborative\n\norganizational structure.\n\nGrudin has authored a number of articles on groupware and\n\nCSCW. Grudin discussed the perils and pitfalls of groupware\n\n(1988), showing that group interactions are extremely complex,\n\nand concluding that proper attention must be paid to subconscious\n\nitems in order to properly implement a CSCW system. Grudin also\n\nstudied group collaboration (1991), observing that people\n\ninteract continually without much effort. He found that computer\n\ncollaboration is difficult and requires a much better\n\nunderstanding of the way groups and organizations function.\n\nGrudin concluded that there must be a better understanding of\n\ngroup processes for workgroup computing system to be successfully\n\nimplemented. Finally, Grudin discussed the differences between\n\ngroupware and traditional computer support (1994), covering the\n\norigins of groupware, identifying eight problem areas, and\n\nexamining groupware successes.\n\nHahn (1994) examined how advances in e-mail and messaging\n\ntechnology have affected groupware. Hahn noted that messaging-\n\nbased groupware has two advantages: it can leverage the existing\n\ninfrastructure of transport, directory, security, and\n\nadministrative services; and groupware messages can potentially\n\nreach anyone with e-mail access. Hahn concluded that those\n\ngroupware applications that support e-mail agents and support the\n\nstore-and-forward metaphor will succeed -- and those that do not\n\nwill have a tough future ahead of them.\n\nHammer and Stanton (1995), in their book entitled The\n\nreengineering revolution: A handbook, discuss methods for re-\n\nengineering business processes, and attempts to define exactly\n\nwhat re-engineering means to corporations today and in the\n\nfuture. Hammer and Stanton note that groupware and communication\n\nproducts like e-mail and the Internet can act as a vehicle for\n\nchange, but conclude that in order for change to be effective and\n\npermanent, management and the employee base of a company must\n\nwork together to question common practices and redefine\n\nestablished roles and procedures.\n\nHeld (1992) examined how Lotus Notes, with several add-on\n\nproducts, was used in a large banking organization to resolve\n\ngroup collaboration problems. The system has been successfully\n\nexpanded to over 100 users in multiple locations. Held noted\n\nthat even senior management, who did not have computers before\n\nthis system was implemented, are now using the system.\n\nIn his book entitled Future telecommunications: Information\n\napplications, services, and infrastructure (1993), Heldman\n\nprovides background information on telecommunications trends.\n\nTopics such as networking, services, and infrastructure are\n\ncovered. Future implications for groupware products are also\n\ndiscussed.\n\nThe term \"groupware\" has been used to describe everything\n\nfrom simple e-mail programs to complicated workflow software.\n\nHiggins (1992) explained that groupware should be considered a\n\ndistinct category of software, and recognized applications that\n\nfall into this distinction. He discussed six categories of\n\ngroupware including messaging systems, database applications,\n\nmessage filtering applications, work group application\n\ndevelopment software, calendaring and scheduling products, and\n\ndocument management systems.\n\nHildebrand (1996) commented on being a member of a groupware\n\nimplementation team, and the lessons to be learned from the\n\nactivity. Hildebrand found that discovering and managing the\n\nbehavioral and organizational factors that drive groupware\n\nefforts is a challenging task, and requires emphasis on human\n\nfactors in order to avoid organizational chaos. She concluded\n\nthat to encourage knowledge sharing, IS and other corporate\n\nexecutives must align incentives and rewards with the\n\ncollaborative initiative.\n\nHills (1997) reviewed the current product offerings in the\n\ngroupware market. Hills notes that most of the leading products\n\n(e.g., Lotus Notes, Novell's Groupwise, Microsoft's Exchange, and\n\nNetscape's Collabra Share) were developed before the advent of\n\nintranets, and rely on traditional client/server architecture.\n\nSome, newer products, like Netscape's Communicator and Lotus\n\nDomino, use intranets for its primary platform. Hills concluded\n\nthat these newer products will gain market share over their\n\ncompetitors, as IS managers use their existing intranet structure\n\nto implement browser-accessible groupware applications in a cost\n\neffective manner.\n\nWith so much groupware technology and terminology about, it\n\nis sometimes difficult to discern fact from fiction, and real\n\napplications for \"vapor\" ware. Holsapple, Rathman, and Winston\n\n(1993) provide a concise description of groupware, and discuss\n\nsome possible applications. Their straightforward article on\n\ngroupware serves as a good introductory work to the field.\n\nHoltham (1993) identified five workgroup drivers: change,\n\ncoordination, collaboration, control, and connectivity. Holtham\n\nargues that \"bundles\" of different groupware tools are required\n\nto support different business situations, and provided a grid\n\nthat helps in classifying groupware tools and systems.\n\nCollaborative computing systems are environments that allow\n\npeople to share thoughts, ideas, and information. Hsu and\n\nLockwood (1993) discussed the three fundamental aspects of\n\ncollaborative computing: common task, shared environment, and\n\ntime and space. Hsu and Lockwood identified and discussed\n\nproblems with groupware, finding that groupware systems can meet\n\nresistance when they are introduced because they challenge the\n\nexisting organizational culture. Hsu and Lockwood concluded that\n\norganizations must change the way they operate for collaborative\n\nsystems to be successful.\n\nHuber (1990) directly addressed the different forms of\n\ncommunication and the effects these technologies can have on\n\nchanging the workplace. He explained the nature of advanced\n\ninformation technologies in terms of basic characteristics, such\n\nas precision, rapidity, and access control. Huber concluded that\n\nuse of advanced technologies will not usurp traditional\n\ntechnologies unless organizational effectiveness can be\n\nincreased.\n\nJohansen, Sibbet, Benson, Martin, Mittman, and Saffo (1991),\n\nin their book entitled Leading business teams: How teams can use\n\ntechnology and group process tools to enhance performance,\n\ndescribe the motivation behind using groupware, and cover\n\nelectronic groupware tools and systems used within corporate\n\ninfrastructures. Johansen et al. also explored specific types of\n\ngroupware, focused on the social nature of groupware, and\n\npresented a series of corporate examples to illustrate the uses\n\nof groupware within business settings.\n\nJohnson-Lenz (1991) explored several different approaches to\n\ngroupware in order to find a middle ground. The authors focused\n\non two main methods: making groups work through the use of\n\nexplicit forms and procedures; and allowing groups to self\n\norganize. The authors concluded that groupware must be capable\n\nof being tailored to changing needs and evolving purposes, with\n\npurposed-centered groupware having the potential to be applied to\n\nany organizational group in order to help sustain their culture.\n\nKaplan, Lauriston, and Fox (1992) reviewed twenty-eight\n\ndifferent groupware products, noting their strengths, weaknesses,\n\nand applicability. The authors concluded the review with some\n\nguidelines concerning what to look for in personal computer\n\ngroupware products.\n\nKaran, Kerr, Murthy, and Vinze (1996) conducted several\n\nstudies in behavioral decision making via group decision support\n\nsystems (GDSS) and found that decisions made by interacting\n\ngroups tend to shift from the mean judgment for the same tasks\n\nwhen performed individually. The results indicate that people\n\ninteract differently through a GDSS than when they communicate\n\nface-to-face, and suggest that GDSS-media communication is more\n\nefficient.\n\nKhoshafian and Buckiewicz (1995), in their book entitled\n\nIntroduction to groupware, workflow, and workgroup computing,\n\nreviewed the concepts and framework involved with collaborative\n\ncomputing technology. The authors examined the existing\n\ncollaborative technologies available, and commented on their\n\napplications in workflow and workgroup environments. Citing\n\nseveral corporate success and failure stories, the authors\n\nconcluded that groupware, unlike standard transaction-based\n\ninformation systems, has a special set of social characteristics\n\ninvolved that must be accounted for during the implementation and\n\nmaintenance phases of the groupware application.\n\nCSCW implementation progress during the last few years has\n\nbeen slow, with notably few success (i.e., e-mail and computer\n\nconferencing). Kling (1991) studied the work aspects of CSCW,\n\nfinding that CSCW may be seen as a conjunction of certain kinds\n\nof technologies, certain kinds of users, and a view that\n\nemphasizes sociable work relations. He differentiated CSCW from\n\nother forms of computerization and felt that CSCW is a social\n\nmovement rather than a group of technologies. Kling concluded\n\nthat it may be difficult to implement CSCW because the dynamics\n\nof group social processes are not well understood.\n\nKundargi and Subramaniam (1992) described the experiences in\n\ndesigning and implementing a computer based environment to\n\nimprove business collaborations in residential real estate\n\ntransactions. The resulting system was a server-based network of\n\npersonal computers complete with a graphical user interface\n\nspecifically designed for real estate transactions instead of off-\n\nthe-shelf groupware products. The authors concluded that\n\ngroupware systems that can be tailored to the specific work\n\nenvironment involved will be more successful than standard, no-\n\nflexible \"canned\" applications.\n\nKyng (1991) paid close attention to the collaborative\n\naspects of work a computerized setting. Kyng discussed\n\ncooperation as a factor that must be integrated into computer\n\nsupport efforts, and perceived that some of the aspects of\n\ncooperation have been ignored by the more traditional computer\n\nsupport areas. Kyng concluded that this lack of cooperation has\n\nhindered the introduction of groupware into organizations.\n\nLang (1992) discussed the essential elements for the\n\nsuccessful introduction of a groupware product in an\n\norganization. Studying the implementation, Lang found that there\n\nwere two highly related sets of factors for the use of groupware:\n\nthe product (electronic calendaring) had to have well defined\n\nexpected uses and clear guidelines for usage; and the\n\norganization had to revise procedures as the product was\n\nintroduced to encourage and stimulate usage by the employees.\n\nTransfer of information can be a motivating force in the\n\nbusiness environment. Larson and Zimney (1990), in their book\n\nentitled The white collar shuffle: Who does what in today's\n\ncomputerized workplace, discussed this subject and other factors.\n\nLarson and Zimney also looked at the negative effects of\n\ncomputerization, including the loss of face-to-face\n\ncommunications and depersonalization. The authors showed how\n\ntechnology can be intimidating to workers and how there must be\n\nan appropriate distribution of work to encourage success.\n\nMalone, Lai, and Fry (1992) studied an experiment conducted\n\nwith Oval: a tailorable tool for cooperative work. Malone et al.\n\nfound that Oval was used to create applications by combining\n\nobjects, views, agents, and links in a building block approach.\n\nOval functioned much like Coordinator, Lotus Notes, and\n\nInformation Lens. The authors concluded that Oval established\n\nprimitives that were used as a tailoring language for application\n\nconstruction.\n\nManasco (1995) looked at how companies are adapting their\n\nwork environments and are harnessing \"intellectual capital\"\n\nthrough the use of groupware technology. The author found that\n\nmany problems with information sharing in a group setting are due\n\nto organizational arrangements and the human tendency to hoard\n\nknowledge. These problems, however, can be overcome by linking\n\nbonuses, promotability, and other incentives to the sharing of\n\nknowledge. Manasco concluded that the true promise of groupware\n\nlies not in its ability to disseminate existing information, but\n\nrather, its potential to facilitate the creation of new knowledge\n\nin a collaborative context and help companies better manage their\n\nintellectual assets.\n\nMcGrath and Hollingshead (1993) studied group theory in\n\ndetail and examined how technological advancements affect dynamic\n\nprocesses within groups. The authors attempted to provide a\n\nbalance to the technological implementation of group support\n\nsystems, and concluded that focusing on group requirements,\n\nrather than individual needs, lead to a smoother integration of\n\ngroupware systems within organizations.\n\nMedford (1993) discussed trends in groupware, analyzing\n\nproducts such as e-mail, calendaring, and group scheduling\n\nproducts. Medford concentrated on Lotus Notes, and how it\n\nprovided a top-down environment for work groups. Medford\n\nconcluded that based on its market strength, Notes is setting the\n\ndefacto standard for various types of workgroup products.\n\nOlsen (1989) provided articles on the relationship between\n\ncomputer systems and social systems. The articles described\n\napproaches to using computers to support teamwork, defined\n\ncollaborative computer systems, and described management\n\ninformation systems that support collaborative work. Olsen\n\nconcluded that: knowledge is social constructed; current\n\ncollaborative computer tools are inadequate to satisfy the needs\n\nto integrate data from a variety of sources; and that because we\n\ndo not yet understand the true nature of collaboration, we are\n\nunable to provide the tools to enhance cooperative work.\n\nUser needs and capabilities should be used as the focus when\n\ndesigning groupware. Olson and Olson (1991), through the use of\n\nextensive studies, presented user-centered system design concepts\n\nthat consisted of observation and analysis of users at work,\n\nassistance in design from relevant theory, and iterative testing\n\nwith users. The studies helped to develop the beginnings of a\n\ntheory of distributed cognition that formed the basis for the\n\nfirst stages of iterative testing and redesign of a prototype\n\neditor to support shared design work.\n\nOpper (1992) studied the impact and benefits a groupware\n\nproduct can have on an organization, finding that clear benefits\n\nmust be identified in order to promote future interest. Opper\n\nsuggests that when groupware solutions are implemented in an\n\norganization, base-line interviews should be conducted to\n\ndetermine who will use the products and to design applications\n\nonce groupware has been established.\n\nOpper (1993) continued her work in groupware, reviewing and\n\ncommenting on factors that are critical to choosing and\n\nimplementing a groupware system. Opper noted that the process\n\nbegins with input from business and systems, and is supported by\n\nan on-going team of business and technical experts. Opper found\n\nthat groupware implementation is an iterative process requiring a\n\nseries of structured pilots to build a solid foundation for\n\nenterprise-wide groupware. Opper concluded that effective\n\ntraining and skilled support, when combined with vision and\n\norganizational restructuring, will allow groupware to be an\n\nenabling technology for a transformed organization.\n\nOpper and Fersko-Weiss (1992), in their book entitled\n\nTechnology for teams: Enhancing productivity in networked\n\norganizations, explored the uses and development of groupware\n\nthat integrates computer technology and team processes. The\n\nauthors placed groupware in a business context, describing the\n\ngroupware currently available, and examining the benefits of\n\ngroupware. Opper and Fersko-Weiss provided guidelines and\n\nstrategies for thinking about and using groupware by asking and\n\nanswering a series of questions about who should use groupware,\n\nhow it should be implemented, what changes it will make in how\n\npeople work, and how these changes should be managed.\n\nOrlikowski (1992) undertook an exploratory field study to\n\ndetermine the impact of groupware on organizational\n\neffectiveness. A Lotus Notes implementation in a large office\n\norganization was observed to determine the changes the\n\ncollaborative process had on social interaction. The results\n\nsuggested that groupware caused an interaction between cognitive\n\nand structural aspects of the environment, causing employees to\n\nassess and think about the value of the new technology.\n\nOrlikowski concluded that people generally act towards a\n\ntechnology based on their understanding of it, and that\n\nimplementing Notes does not in of itself change the way people\n\nwork in an office environment.\n\nGroupware is affected by the bandwidth of the communication\n\npaths it uses. The amount of groupware data that can be\n\nexchanged in a unit of time is a central issue in groupware\n\nsupport. Orr (1992) discussed the goals of groupware that\n\nincluded a medium for communication, metacommunication, audit\n\ntrails, and security. Orr surmised that the addition of graphics\n\nto group communication will increase the intimacy of\n\ncommunications and help reach acceptance of groupware by larger\n\nportions of the user community.\n\nPastor and Jager (1992) describe an architectural framework\n\nfor cooperative support. The authors show that groupware\n\nimplementation need to be addressed in a building-block fashion -\n\n- starting with the proper computing and network infrastructure\n\nand ending with unit testing, maintenance, training, and support.\n\nPost (1992) discussed issues concerning the implementation\n\nof group support systems relative to group performance and return\n\non investment. Post reported that business case variables such\n\nas efficiency, quality, effectiveness, customer satisfaction, and\n\ndecision-making are useful for measuring the potential\n\ncontribution of group support systems. Post's framework is\n\nuseful to researchers and implementors attempting to deploy\n\ngroupware technologies in complex business environments.\n\nMany multi-user applications lack the ability to \"undo\" an\n\naction. Prakash and Knister (1992) proposed a general framework\n\nfor undo that allows for conflict between various users within a\n\ngroup-support system. Undo selections are proposed for actions\n\ndepending on who performed them, where they originated, or other\n\nappropriate criteria. The authors concluded that additional\n\nresearch is required to determine appropriate interfaces for\n\nsupporting the undo action in a workgroup environment.\n\nRadosevich (1996) cautioned into rushing into a groupware\n\nselection right away. In reviewing the current groupware market,\n\nRadosevich found that today's hot groupware picks may be outdated\n\nin 2 or 3 years -- thanks to the Internet, intranets, and the\n\ncontinuing race among software vendors. While Lotus Notes,\n\nMicrosoft Exchange, and Novell Groupwise are all solid products,\n\nnone have emerged as the clear winner. Ultimately, Radosevich\n\nconcludes, the groupware selection could boil down to a choice of\n\nhardware platforms.\n\nApproaches for cooperative work vary greatly. Reinhard,\n\nSchweitzer, and Volksen (1994) developed a taxonomy that could be\n\nused to evaluate groupware tools and how they relate to the\n\nworkgroup computing process. Reihard et al. defined application\n\nand functional criteria requirements. Their results described\n\ntwo implementation approaches: multi-user access to shared single-\n\nuser applications; and a network of shared data objects.\n\nRiggs, Bellinger, and Krieger (1996) argue that there are\n\ntwo conceptually different functions for groupware -- those\n\nbringing workflow automation and those that capture\n\norganizational learning. The authors found that in its early\n\nstages, groupware implementation focuses primarily on workflow\n\nautomation. Riggs et al. concluded that organizational learning\n\nvia groupware is a long-term process expected to be found in more\n\nmature applications.\n\nRobinson (1991) studied first generation CSCW applications,\n\ncovering group authoring, calendar management, meeting\n\nscheduling, action coordination, informal conversations, and\n\nlarge meetings in organizations. Robinson outlined ten concepts\n\nfor CSCW that account for past work in the field, forming an\n\nagenda for research, design, and implementation of future CSCW\n\nsystems and applications.\n\nRodden (1993) reviewed computer technology necessary to\n\nsupport CSCW, finding that two CSCW approaches exist. One\n\nsupports the exchange of information between users, and the other\n\ndevelops systems that allow the cooperative sharing of\n\ninformation. Rodden also discussed iterative meeting systems\n\nthat allow information sharing and group communication.\n\nNetworks can provide for improved transmission of\n\ninformation and the sharing of resources. A measure of\n\neffectiveness for distributed systems is how well the users of a\n\nnetwork can coordinate their activities with respect to one\n\nanother. Rogers (1992) examined the interactive processes that\n\ntake place when there is a breakdown in the network, finding that\n\ncognitive issues of shared understanding, the transmission of\n\nknowledge, and a distribution of problem solving methods are\n\nadversely affected by any network downtime. Rogers concluded\n\nthat replication is a required process for shared support, and\n\ncan avoid problems raised when networks do not function properly.\n\nWithout proper policies, employees cannot take advantage of\n\ncompany-provided software such as groupware, or products that\n\nenable two or more users to communicate, collaborate and\n\ncoordinate their activities via computer. Romano (1997) proposed\n\na five-part framework for implementation including socialization,\n\ncommitment, reward, feedback, and legitimacy.\n\nSarin, Abbott, and McCarthy (1991) presented a model for\n\ncollaborative work that breaks down the process into units of\n\nwork. The model includes flexible routing of work to the\n\n\"doers,\" who work on the presentation and manipulation of\n\ndocuments. The model, which was implemented as an object\n\noriented network service, is important because it is one view of\n\nthe collaborative process that can help to explain the group\n\ndynamics in a CSCW environment.\n\nScalia and Sackmary (1996) examined a classroom application\n\nof groupware for CSCW, consisting of problem solving, decision\n\nmaking, and development of group reports. The study found that\n\nstudent groupware users are generally satisfied with member\n\ncontributions and group output but are less satisfied with\n\nsoftware-supported, decision-making processes. Scalia and\n\nSackmary concluded that groupware is a powerful communication\n\ntool for support of work groups but that it may not solve the\n\nbasic problems of getting people to work effectively and\n\nproductively.\n\nLotus Notes has certainly been a major player in the\n\ngroupware market, and has helped to bring definition to this new\n\nclass of cooperative applications. Schulman (1994), in his book\n\nentitled Using Lotus Notes, provides an introduction to the basic\n\nfeatures of Lotus Notes. Schulman points out that Notes has\n\nbecome a leading groupware products because of its ability to\n\nshare databases and electronic information over local and remote\n\ncorporate networks.\n\nAs workgroup computing matures, a major area of discussion\n\nwill be how data is stored, maintained, and accessed in workgroup\n\nsettings. Schwartz (1992) addressed the wide range of issues\n\nsurrounding this subject, noting that close attention should be\n\npaid to the underlying technologies and the data delivery models.\n\nThis concentration should ensure that a close fit with the data\n\nneeds of an organization are supported.\n\nSchwartz (1996) analyzed how several insurance companies\n\nhave implemented groupware systems, and found that in some cases,\n\nthe technology has doubled or tripled productivity. The benefits\n\nhave come through collaborative applications designed to\n\nsignificantly reduce support costs. One company, Swiss Re,\n\nreduced its contract processing time from 3 weeks to a matter of\n\ndays. The company used Lotus Notes for its application\n\ndevelopment platform.\n\nSmith (1994), in his book entitled Collective intelligence\n\nin computer-based collaboration, proposed a new approach for CSCW\n\nand a research agenda for developing and testing the approach.\n\nSmith's main emphasis is on parallel processing of user tasks.\n\nHe also considers a group to be a distributed information\n\nprocessing system that can have a particular level of awareness\n\nand control.\n\nStevenson (1993) reviewed leaders of the PC groupware pack.\n\nHe found that since groupware was not well defined, selection of\n\nthe competing programs was difficult. Products reviewed include\n\nBeyond Mail, CM/I, Keyfile, Lotus Notes, Office IQ, and Futurus\n\nTeam. The products address different areas with some overlap:\n\nhowever, no single product addresses all aspects of workgroup\n\ncomputing. Stevenson concluded that selection of a final product\n\ndepends on the type of workgroup situation and knowledge of what\n\nproblems must be solved.\n\nTuroff (1991) presented a historical perspective of computer-\n\nmediated communication and its relationship to designing for\n\ngroup support. Turoff provided design feature examples that\n\nsupport specific tasks, and discussed the advantages of\n\nasynchronous communication process support.\n\nVarney (1996) examined the pervasive influence of Internet\n\ntechnologies on groupware, noting what used to be a choice among\n\nvarious groupware products has now broadened to include a slew of\n\nWeb-based alternatives that use the open standards of the\n\nInternet to provide groupware functions. Longtime groupware\n\nvendors have seen the threat from rivals such as Netscape and are\n\nmoving quickly to incorporate support for Internet standards.\n\nVarney concluded that smarter corporate customers will be looking\n\nfor groupware that supports open interfaces for an enterprise\n\ndirectory infrastructure.\n\nWacker (1992) progressed through the perils and pitfalls of\n\nimplementing a set of groupware tools in a law office setting.\n\nAfter several years of use, Wacker found that the rudimentary\n\ntools for groupware are in place, however, e-mail is still the\n\nmost popular functioned being used. Wacker concluded that the\n\nbiggest challenge is to keep out minds open to the possibilities\n\nof groupware.\n\nWastell and White (1993) described a form of technology\n\nknown as Process Support Technology. This process provides a set\n\nof techniques to allow modeling cooperative work. Wastell and\n\nWhite also provided case studies that illustrate this technique,\n\nand discussed issues arising from field studies.\n\nWheatley (1996) observed that the market for groupware\n\nsoftware, which for long has been synonymous with Lotus Notes,\n\nnow seems disturbingly wide open, with as many new definitions of\n\ngroupware abounding as new providers. Groupware vendors have\n\nbeen challenged by the explosion of corporate intranets -- which\n\noffer businesses most of the same functions at a lower price, and\n\nin an \"open\" environment. Wheatley concluded that the\n\ntraditional groupware market will continue to be challenged by\n\nintranets, and groupware products will have to adapt themselves\n\nby opening their architecture while also lowering prices.\n\nAs organizations continue to network, business decision\n\ntimes are being reduced. Whittier (1992) analyzed just-in-time\n\n(JIT) processing for business decisions, finding that data must\n\nmove quickly to the right people as well as give them access to\n\nit. He concluded that CSCW enables JIT business decisions\n\nthrough inter-personal communications, information sharing, inter-\n\noffice communication, and real-time conferencing.\n\nWreden (1993) addressed potential benefits and problems\n\nimplementing groupware in organizations. Each groupware\n\nimplementation has its own special problems depending on the type\n\nof installed equipment base and the computer \"maturity\" of the\n\norganization. Wreden concluded that successful groupware\n\nimplementation depends on a shared collaborative vision that is\n\nactively supported by everyone in the organization.\n\nThe Yankee Group (1995) discussed the three dynamics in\n\nworkgroups: communication, collaboration, and coordination. In\n\ntheir review, The Yankee Group presented a common framework for\n\ncustomers and vendors to use in planning their own\n\nimplementations of workgroup solutions. The authors concluded\n\nthat by understanding the three dynamics, users can gain the most\n\nbenefit from groupware products and align business requirements\n\nwith emerging groupware technologies.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe literature reviewed in this paper was derived from a\n\nvariety of sources, including academic and trade journals,\n\ntechnical publications and magazines, and on-line discussion\n\ngroups and Internet locations. The first location used to garner\n\nsources was Nova Southeastern University's Electronic Library.\n\nUsing Nova's on-line search databases (e.g., First Search and ABI\n\nInform), when keyed on the term \"groupware,\" yielded many\n\ninteresting articles and journal publications.\n\nA second major source for groupware references was the\n\ncomputing and technology section in the Snell Library at\n\nNortheastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. Northeastern's\n\nstacks are quite extensive, and their on-line library catalog\n\nmade the search for books and journals on groupware-related\n\nsubjects a fairly easy task.\n\nBy far the richest source of groupware references was the\n\nInternet. The Usenet newsgroup comp.groupware had a series of\n\ninteresting discussions in progress on a variety of groupware\n\ntopics, as well as available FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) on\n\nthe subject of groupware in general. Searching on the keyword\n\n\"groupware,\" using the Internet Web search engine Alta Vista from\n\nDigital Equipment Corporation, also yielded a number of Web page\n\n\"hits\" that were rich in sources on groupware. All of the major\n\nvendors had Web pages describing their products, as well as a\n\nnumber of studies available on-line in support of their products\n\nand groupware systems. Netscape's Collabra Share page\n\n(http://www.collabra.com) listed a number of groupware white\n\npapers, as well as an on-line bibliography of CSCW writings\n\ncompiled by Lee Honeycutt of the Rensselaer Polytechnic\n\nInstitute, and Deborah Bosley of the University of North Carolina\n\nat Charlotte.\n\nResults\n\nIt is clear from the literature review that the term\n\n\"groupware\" is still being defined, and its impact hotly debated\n\namongst corporations, IS personnel, and researchers in the field.\n\nGroupware itself is evolving, and holds much promise for those\n\ncorporations that master the technology and adapt their workplace\n\nto become a more collaborative environment.\n\nIn summary, a number of interesting points emerged from the\n\nliterature review, including:\n\n* Corporate intranets are evolving and pose a challenge to\n\ntraditional groupware products.\n\n* Time and space constraints, and emerging multimedia\n\ncapabilities must be accounted for in groupware design.\n\n* Groupware applications must be tailored to the organization\n\nand matched to group requirements.\n\n* Groupware must be championed and supported by management.\n\nReward mechanisms need to be in place to encourage the sharing,\n\nrather than the hoarding of, corporate information.\n\n* Social dynamics of groups and groupwork must be better\n\nunderstood.\n\n* Groupware is fairly inexpensive, and intranets will continue\n\nto lower the cost.\n\n* It's best to stick with one groupware system rather than mix\n\nand match different groupware technologies.\n\n* Groupware designers need to pay attention to group dynamics,\n\nrather than individual mechanics, when designing applications.\n\n* Groupware is enabling technology; It can help transform an\n\norganization when it is combined with proper re-engineering\n\ntechniques.\n\n* Lotus Notes is currently leading the market, but competitors\n\nsuch as Novell, Netscape, and Microsoft are all catching up\n\nquickly.\n\n* Information based in a groupware system must be actively\n\nmanaged in order to avoid becoming stale and useless.\n\n* Groupware, like any other computerized system, needs to have\n\na support and maintenance structure in place in order for it to\n\nflourish within an organization.\n\n* Not all groupware features are being used. Proper training\n\nand follow-up is needed to ensure employees use the system as it\n\nwas intended.\n\n* Implementation of groupware systems spawn network and\n\nbandwidth issues that must be actively addressed.\n\n* Issues in how to reconcile information, and how to replicate\n\ninformation within groupware exist and need to be addressed.\n\nConclusions\n\nGroupware will continue to have a large impact on how\n\ncorporations do business, how people communicate, and how\n\nprocesses are defined. However, with out a clear strategy in\n\nmind, groupware will not live up to its promises of enhanced\n\nproductivity, improved group communications, and more structured\n\ndecision making.\n\nIt is evident that corporations need guidance when choosing\n\nand implementing a groupware system. Merely buying a groupware\n\napplication and placing it front of a user population it not\n\nenough. The corporation must first look within itself to examine\n\nhow existing processes and procedures can be improved, and how\n\ngroupware can act an enabling technology, or a vehicle for\n\nchange, to motivate employees to share ideas and improve workflow-\n\nbased practices.\n\nEmployees must then be encouraged to share information.\n\nThis is a tricky proposition, especially within the current\n\nbusiness atmosphere of corporate consolidations and downsizing.\n\nManagement must champion the cause, and reward people for showing\n\ninitiative, sharing ideas and knowledge, and recording this\n\nvaluable \"intellectual capital\" onto a system that will keep the\n\ninformation available for people to use.\n\nOnce the information is within the groupware system, it must\n\nbe actively structured and managed so the it is grouped into\n\nmeaningful subsets, and can be retrieved and referenced with\n\nlittle effort. The groupware system must be able to store\n\nobjects that are \"foreign\" to it, such a spreadsheet and work\n\nprocessing files, so that the complete process or workflow can be\n\ncaptured.\n\nFinally, the groupware system must fit within a\n\ncorporation's existing infrastructure, and be able to adapt to\n\nnew information systems that need to interface or exchange\n\ninformation with it. The emergence of the Internet, and\n\ncorporate intranets, pose a challenge to traditional groupware\n\nsystems and methodologies. Those groupware applications that can\n\nadapt to this new, dynamic, and open environment will be those\n\nthat last into the next century, and those that become a critical\n\npart of a corporation's infrastructure. Networks and networking\n\nsystems will need to provide the bandwidth and connectivity\n\nneeded for groupware systems to operate sufficiently within\n\ncorporations, and link corporate networks on a global basis.\n\nMuch like the client/server computing paradigm, a groupware\n\napplication should follow a framework: a series of steps to\n\nensure that the technology will fit the infrastructure, and the\n\ntechnology will be accepted, adapted, and used by the\n\ncorporation. A framework will help to make sense of all the\n\nfactors in consideration for a groupware implementation, and\n\nserve as a roadmap for corporations to follow as they seek to\n\nempower employees and remain competitive in the future.\n\nReferences\n\nAdhikari, R.
