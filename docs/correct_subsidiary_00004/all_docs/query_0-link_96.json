Her early years were spent in Germany where her father served as a lieutenant colonel in the US Army reserves. However, her family returned to the U.S when she was four years old. She began her career in entertainment at the age of 14 with the film The Man in the Moon, which earned her a nomination for a Young Artist Award. Witherspoon's breakthrough came in 1999 when she starred in the comedy-drama Election, earning her a Golden Globe nomination. But it was her role as Elle Woods in the comedy Legally Blonde in 2001 that catapulted her into Hollywood stardom. This performance solidified her standing as one of America's most talented and versatile actresses, earning her a second Golden Globe nomination. In 2005, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of June Carter Cash in the biographical musical film Walk the Line. Aside from her acting career, Witherspoon has made significant strides as a producer and entrepreneur. She established her production company, Pacific Standard, in 2012 to create more roles for women in film and television.

Raised in Cypress, California, Woods was introduced to the sport at a tender age by his father, Earl Woods, himself an amateur golfer. With this early introduction to the sport, Woods displayed an undeniable talent and passion for golf that catapulted him to international fame. Woods' career is a testament to his talent, resilience, and ambition. He attended Stanford University on a golf scholarship, but only stayed for two years before turning professional in 1996. His prowess on the green led him to become the youngest ever Masters winner in 1997, a record he still holds today. Over the years, he accumulated an impressive array of titles, including 15 major championships, solidifying his status as one of the most successful golfers of all time. Woods' triumphs extend beyond the green; he's been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record eleven times and is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row, a feat known as the Tiger Slam. His victory at the 2019 Masters Tournament is often hailed as one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. Off the course, Woods has leveraged his success to launch the TGR Foundation, which supports community-based programs that improve health, education, and welfare. Tiger Woods' story is one of immense talent, perseverance in the face of adversity, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, making him a compelling figure in the world of sports.\n\nJames Isaacs\n\nAs Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Alliances, James Isaacs is responsible for sales to wireless operators and for building a world-class organization for long-term support of Danger's wireless operator customers.

Hailing from a well-established family in New York City, she adopted her stage name from a character in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby. Weaver's fascination with acting began at a young age, leading to her pursuit of a Bachelor of Arts in English from Stanford University, followed by a Master of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Drama. Weaver's breakthrough role came in 1979 when she starred as Ellen Ripley in Ridley Scott's science fiction horror film, Alien. Her portrayal of a tenacious, resourceful heroine in a genre dominated by male protagonists was groundbreaking and earned her worldwide recognition. She reprised this role in three subsequent sequels, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Aliens in 1986. This role cemented her status as a leading lady in action films, breaking stereotypes and paving the way for future female action heroes. Despite being synonymous with the Alien franchise, Weaver's versatility as an actress extends far beyond. She has shown exceptional range in both drama and comedy, earning critical acclaim for her performances in films like Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey and Working Girl, both of which earned her Academy Award nominations in the same year. Weaver continues to captivate audiences with her compelling performances, making her a true icon in the world of cinema.\n\nPolitician, Military Officer, Author\n\nAge : Dec. at 46 (1917-1963)\n\nBirthplace : Brookline, Massachusetts, United States of America\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, often referred to by his initials JFK, was a significant figure in the annals of American history. Born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts, he was the second of nine children from the politically influential Kennedy family. His early education took place in elite institutions, culminating with a Bachelor of Arts in Government from Harvard University in 1940. Kennedy's early life was not only marked by academic pursuits but was also filled with health struggles, including a near-fatal case of Addison's disease. Kennedy's political career began in earnest after World War II. In 1946, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Massachusetts's 11th Congressional district. After serving three terms, he successfully ran for Senate in 1952. His tenure as a Senator was notable for his advocacy on labor issues and his foreign policy stances, particularly regarding Vietnam. However, it was the 1960 Presidential election that truly thrust Kennedy into the global spotlight. At the age of 43, he became the youngest person ever elected to the presidency and the first Catholic to hold the office. Kennedy's presidency, though brief, was momentous. He navigated the country through some of the most intense moments of the Cold War, including the Cuban Missile Crisis. His administration also saw the initiation of the Peace Corps, the launch of the Apollo space program, and significant strides in civil rights. Tragically, Kennedy's presidency was cut short when he was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Despite his short time in office, Kennedy's charismatic leadership, compelling speeches, and forward-thinking policies have ensured his enduring legacy in American history."
