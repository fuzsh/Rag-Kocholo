II �������� Business Capabilities and Plan�����������\n\nPart III�������� Technical Capabilities and Plan����������\n\nINTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW\n\nThis application is filed on behalf of The dotPRO Consortium (�DPC�) for the right to operate and administer the registry for the .pro Top-Level Domain (�TLD�).� Conditional upon award, the entities comprising the dotPRO Consortium (the �Partners�) include:\n\n� The .TV Corporation International (�dotTV�)\n\n� Lycos, Inc.\n\n� XO Communications, Inc.\n\n� SK Telecom Co, Ltd.\n\n� 7DC, Inc.\n\n� OnlineNIC, Inc.\n\nCollectively, the Partners encompass a broad geographical reach and possess an impressive range of Internet- and technology-related expertise.� The DPC Partners are global leaders in the fields of domain name registration (in both registry and registrar functions), wireless networking, portals/search engines, web navigation, broadband, web-hosting, and online services.� Respectively, the Partners� operations are headquartered in the United States (dotTV, Lycos, XO), Korea (SK Telecom, 7DC), and China (OnlineNIC), with international offices located in Hong Kong and the UK (dotTV), Brazil, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the UK, Spain and The Netherlands (Lycos).� Highlights of the Partners� business activities include:\n\nCompany������� Central Offices������������� Recent Highlights\n\nDPC proposes a two-tier TLD system that targets professional and commercial enterprises, consisting of �pro� as the top-level domain, and a set of second-level domains, each of which pertains to a specific professional community.\n\nThe string proposed is �.pro�, an abbreviation for the word �professional�, itself a root name that has broad multi-lingual appeal and will be understood by a large number of Internet users in the world�s professional and commercial communities\n\nInitially, DPC proposes the following second-level domains be established, with as many foreign language equivalents as ICANN determines are appropriate or necessary:\n\nSuffix\n\nIndustry\n\nUsers\n\n.med\n\nMedicine and Healthcare\n\ndoctors, hospitals, HMOs, medical supply companies\n\n.law\n\nLegal and Judicial System\n\nlawyers, judges, courts and courthouses, law firms, clerks\n\n.agr\n\nAgriculture\n\nfarmers, food processors, distributors\n\n.ins\n\nInsurance�������������\n\n.fin\n\nFinance�\n\nfunds, investment banks, brokerages, lenders, banks, accountants\n\n.aer\n\nAerospace\n\nengineers, manufacturers, airports, airlines\n\n.rx\n\nPharmaceutical\n\npharmacies, pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, drugstores\n\n.trv\n\nTravel & Leisure\n\nhotels, restaurants, travel agents, resorts, airlines, car rentals\n\n.art\n\nArts, Entertainment, Recreation\n\ncinemas, theaters, symphonies, museums, actors, venues, operas\n\n.pub\n\nPublication\n\npublishers, authors, printers, writers, editors, photographers\n\n.auto\n\nAutomotive\n\nmanufacturers, subcontractors, dealerships, parts, mechanics\n\n.npo\n\nNonprofit\n\ncharities, missions, trade associations, unions\n\n.acct\n\nAccounting���������\n\nCPAs, auditors, tax preparers, accountants, bookkeepers\n\n.trans\n\nTransportation\n\ntrucking, delivery services, railroads, shipping, carting\n\n.util\n\nUtilities\n\npower companies, phone companies, energy, oil, cable, gas\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the above industries employ more than 100 million people in the United States alone, suggesting a significant worldwide applicability of the proposed .pro TLD.\n\nDPC will be constituted as a joint venture corporation which shall be jointly owned and controlled by the Partners.� All management, marketing, business development, finance/administrative and legal functions will be performed directly by DPC�s own personnel.� All registry functions will be outsourced to dotTV under contract enabling DPC to take advantage of dotTV�s existing state-of-the-art registry infrastructure.\n\nDTVC asserts that the proposed system brings with it many advantages and will generally enhance the utility of the DNS.� In addition to addressing specific needs of the Internet business community that are not currently met under the existing .com regime, the scheme proposed satisfies all or most ICANN�s stated criteria and, specifically, promotes stability, efficiency, and equity on the Internet.� Furthermore the proposed scheme will serve as a test-bed for other potential TLDs based on a similar multi-level structure.\n\nThe two-level domain name system being proposed is a self-regulating method of stabilizing and organizing the Internet into distinct categories.� Inherent in the two-level .pro domain system is a roadmap leading to greater precision that will help Internet users find their destinations more easily, making both site marketing and browsing more efficient and less taxing on the system as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, the proposed system will serve to �flatten� the large discrepancies between desirability of various domain names that has exacerbated cybersquatting problems and led to the saturation of the .com universe.� There will be greater supply, lower demand, and less money spent on domain names that will never be used.� In short, it promotes stability in a way that a single gTLD rollout does not.�\n\nDPC will be able to draw on the substantial financial, technical and management resources of its parent companies to ensure its stability and success.� Additionally, the strong international experience and presence of the Partners, either directly or through their respective strategic alliances, will enable DPC to establish a worldwide distribution network to promote global recognition and adoption of a new TLD.\n\nAs an operating TLD registry, dotTV already has in place a proven, state-of-the-art global technical infrastructure and high-speed name resolution capability that is overseen by technical personnel with the highest level of expertise and relevant experience.� In addition to maintaining the .tv registry and the requisite physical and technical infrastructure, dotTV�s management has displayed the ability to creatively and innovatively introduce and promote the acceptance of a novel TLD to the public.� DPC will be able to draw on this management and marketing expertise.\n\nDPC is able to propose an aggressively competitive business model that assumes a wholesale price to registrars of $3.50 per domain name, and includes an initial capital investment of $10,000,000 that will include equity investments from each of the Partners.� This initial infusion will allow for a modest return on investment within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nPART I.��� GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nD2.

(formerly Concentric Network and Nextlink Communications; a leading webhost and leading wireless/fiber optic networking company, respectively).\n\nSK Telecom Co, Ltd.; (a leading Korean wireless telecommunications company).\n\n7DC, Inc., Inc.; (a Korean domain name registrar).\n\nOnlineNIC, Inc.; (the largest domain name registrar in China).\n\nIn the event one or more of the above entities elect not to participate in the consortium, dotTV either alone, or with the remaining members of the consortium, is willing to move forward with this application and to assume all of DPC�s responsibilities and obligations.\n\nDPC will administer and be responsible for all registry functions.� All management, marketing, business development, finance/administrative and legal functions will be performed directly by DPC through its own staff.� All technical functions will be outsourced to dotTV under contract enabling DPC to take advantage of dotTV�s existing state-of-the-art registry infrastructure, subject to oversight and direction from DPC�s principal technical executive.� Further details regarding the proposed management/staffing structure of DPC and the allocation of functions between DPC and dotTV are discussed in detail elsewhere in this proposal.\n\nWith regard to the administration and distribution of domain names in .pro, DPC proposes to:\n\nUtilize the distribution channels of ICANN-accredited and non-ICANN accredited registrars;\n\nOversee and maintain all requisite business, technical, support and administrative functions in connection with .pro;\n\nContinuously monitor, evaluate, and revise the policies applicable to the successful operation of .pro registry with which it is entrusted.\n\nMarket, advertise and promote .pro to registrars and consumers worldwide;\n\nD13.1.1.

Current business operations.� Core capabilities, services offered, products offered, duration of provision of services and products.\n\ndotTV:\n\nPursuant to an exclusive agreement with the Government of Tuvalu, dotTV is a registrar and the exclusive worldwide registry for second-level domain names in the .tv top-level domain.� The Company received its initial funding in November, 1999 from the idealab! Corporation in Pasadena, California, and began registering .tv domain names in April, 2000.� In exchange for the exclusive in-perpetuity license of the .tv top-level domain, the nation of Tuvalu has received a significant minority interest in dotTV, a seat on dotTV�s board and substantial cash payments.�\n\nAs an operating registry, dotTV already has in place a proven, state-of-the-art global technical infrastructure and high-speed name resolution capability which would be required by any prospective registry operator.� In addition to maintaining the .tv registry and the requisite physical and technical infrastructure, a significant proportion of dotTV�s management and staff is dedicated to the marketing, distribution and commercialization of .tv domain names and the development of ancillary business opportunities.� In this respect dotTV has displayed the ability to creatively and innovatively introduce and promote the acceptance of a novel TLD to the general public.\n\ndotTV�s primary source of income is derived from the registration of .tv domain names.� Since domain-name registrations represent obligations to pay annual registration fees, and because of the high renewal rates normally experienced with domain names, dotTV has a highly-predictable recurring revenue stream to support and invest in its business ventures.� Initial license fees are paid up-front and in cash.� Reflecting the international appeal of the .tv domain extension, over 45% of dotTV�s registrations have been from international customers.\n\nFrom a marketing perspective, dotTV has innovatively and aggressively positioned .tv as the domain for the new generation of richer and more engaging online experiences.� The dotTV marketing team consists of group that has diverse experience in both online and offline marketing from the following companies: The Clorox Company, Nestl� USA, eHow.com, Stamps.com and various advertising and public relations agencies.�\n\nExamples from dotTV�s advertising and marketing campaigns are attached as Exhibit B.\n\nSince the launch of dotTV in April, 2000, thousands of companies from around the globe have launched websites in the .tv top level domain including:\n\nThe Academy of Television Arts & Sciences- nonprofit trade group that conducts the annual Emmy Awards (http://www.emmys.tv/)\n\nPAX TV- largest owner of broadcast stations in the country and the operator of the seventh largest television network in the United States (http://www.pax.tv/)\n\nNBC4 (KNBC)-� NBC�s owned and operated station in Los Angeles

nearly 180 million viewers in Asia alone (website under development)\n\nAs of September 25, 2000 dotTV had registered over 100,000 names within the .tv top-level domain.� dotTV has generated significant interest within the international Internet community, having received over 45% of registrations from outside of the United States.� In addition to registering domain names to international customers on its own website, dotTV has signed agreements with 4 U.S. registrars and 7 registrars located outside the United States.� Approximately 10 other registrar agreements are in the final stages of negotiation and expected to be executed and implemented imminently.�\n\n.tv Registrations by Country as of September 25, 2000:\n\nCountry\n\n% of Total\n\nUnited States\n\n53.40%\n\nUnited

offering a suite of value-added products and services through third parties, including email, web hosting, web design and video streaming services.�\n\ndotTV will use it�s strong and growing business experience and partner relationships to support and promote the business activities of DPC.\n\nDPC:\n\nDPC will administer and be responsible for all registry functions of .pro registry.� Generally, all management, marketing, business development, finance/administrative and legal functions will be performed directly by DPC through its own staff.� All technical functions will be outsourced to dotTV under contract enabling DPC to take advantage of dotTV�s existing state-of-the-art registry infrastructure, subject to oversight and direction from DPC�s principal technical executive.\n\nDPC will have access to dotTV�s established business partners and, to the extent possible, dotTV will facilitate the establishment of advantageous business arrangements between DPC and dotTV�s business partners on terms identical or comparable to those enjoyed by dotTV.� In addition, DPC will be able to draw on the management and personnel of dotTV to assist with the establishment and operation of the new registry.� The proposed staffing structure of DPC is discussed in D13.1.7 below.�\n\nD13.1.3. Past business operations/entity history.� History, date of formation, legal status/type of entity, initial services, duration of provision of services and products.\n\ndotTV:\n\nDPC:\n\nDPC is an unincorporated joint venture which proposes to incorporate upon confirmation of ICANN�s approval of this application.�\n\nD13.1.4. Registry/database/Internet related experience and activities.� Experience with database operations, Internet service provision.\n\nDPC has not conducted any business in its own right.� DPC will outsource to dotTV all technical functions with regard to the operation of the registry and, during its start up phase, draw upon dotTV�s experienced management and staff to assist in the establishment of DPC�s stand-alone operations.� See 13.1.2 outlining dotTV�s current business operations and core competencies including registry/database/Internet related experience.� dotTV�s technical experience with regard to registry operation is further discussed in the Technical Capabilities Plan.\n\nD13.1.5. Mission.� The registry operator�s mission and how it relates to expansion into the registry operation field.\n\nDPC�s mission is to facilitate and promote the introduction, distribution and adoption of the proposed new gTLD within the worldwide Internet community.� Integral to this goal is establishing a wholesale price point that provides adequate incentive to ICANN-accredited and non-ICANN accredited registrars to offer registration on a consistent and equitable basis for all interested parties.�\n\nD13.1.6.� Management qualifications and experience of financial and business officers and other relevant employees.� Please address/include past experience, resumes, references, biographies.\n\ndotTV:\n\ndotTV has put in place a talented and experienced management team well equipped to oversee the introduction of a new gTLD and the operation of its registry.� These resources would be made fully available to DPC.� Set forth below are biographies for dotTV�s senior executive team, board of directors and advisory board:\n\nLou Kerner\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nMr. Kerner has significant experience in analyzing and understanding the management and financial performances of the world�s leading media companies.� Prior to joining dotTV in January of 2000, he was a Vice President in the equity research department at Goldman Sachs, analyzing domestic and international cable, satellite and related companies.� Prior to Goldman Sachs, he worked as a securities analyst at Merrill Lynch, covering cable, media and broadcasting companies.� From 1992 - 1994, he served as President of de Forest Research, a leading provider of legal and factual research to the entertainment industry.� Mr. Kerner earned a M.B.A. from Stanford University and a B.A. in Economics from the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nCraig Frances\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nCraig Frances has substantial experience building Industry-leading Internet companies.

business and has no existing management.� Upon award dotTV will aggressively begin the hiring process for DPC management and employees.� If necessary, dotTV shall provide supplemental management and

ability to expand employee base, hiring policy, employee training, space for additional staff.\n\nDPC:\n\nDPC does not currently conduct business in its own right and has no employees.� Upon award dotTV will aggressively begin the hiring process for DPC management and employees.� Generally, all management, marketing, business development, finance/administrative and legal functions will be performed directly by DPC through its own staff.� All technical functions will be outsourced to dotTV under contract enabling DPC to take advantage of dotTV�s existing state-of-the-art registry infrastructure, subject to oversight and direction from DPC�s principal technical executive.�\n\nThe proposed management and staffing structure of DPC is as follows:\n\nPROPOSED MANAGEMENT OF DPC:\n\nThe management of DPC is anticipated to be as follows:\n\nBoard of Directors:\n\nDPC�s management will act under the oversight of a Board of Directors comprised of representatives from each of the consortium partner companies.�\n\nChief Executive Officer:\n\nThe day-to-day management of DPC will be overseen by a Chief Executive Officer who will report to DPC�s Board of Directors.�\n\nThe following functional heads will report to the CEO.\n\nChief Technical Officer:\n\nThe Chief Technical Officer will have oversight of all in-house technical and production matters including the establishment and maintenance of equipment, systems and DPC�s websites.� The CTO will additionally have oversight of all outsourced technical functions including technical functions performed by dotTV under contract.\n\nVice President, Business Development:\n\nThe Vice President of Business Development will have responsibility for identifying and developing business opportunities with regard to .pro including the establishment of a distribution network of registrars and business partners.\n\nVice President, Marketing:\n\nThe Director of Marketing will devise and implement marketing and advertising strategies and campaigns enhancing visibility and public awareness of .pro and promoting its acceptance and adoption.� The Vice President of Marketing may also implement co-marketing strategies with its various registrar partners.\n\nGeneral Counsel:\n\nThe General Counsel will oversee all legal matters with regard to the establishment of DPC and the introduction of .pro including the implementation and proper application of DPC�s registration policies and addressing of intellectual property issues.\n\nController/Director of Finance and Administration:\n\nThe Director of Finance and Administration will oversee all financial, accounting and budgeting functions with regard to DPC�s operations and the introduction of .pro.\n\nSTAFFING OF DPC:\n\nAll management, marketing, business development finance/administrative, and legal functions will be performed directly by DPC through its own staff, while most technical functions will be outsourced to dotTV under contract.� As DPC will be relying on dotTV�s existing and proven technical infrastructure and capabilities to handle much of the registry function, DPC�s anticipated staffing requirements will be quite modest.� Based on the 90% confidence projections discussed later in this proposal, DPC estimates that it will require a staff of 6 at inception increasing to 15 over two years.� Details regarding the composition of the staff are provided in the attached Exhibit D.\n\nBased on dotTV�s own experience (discussed below), it is anticipated that DPC will be able to readily adapt its staffing structure and expand rapidly to meet the needs of its operation having regard to the volume registrations in .pro.� In the event that additional personnel are required by DPC, it is anticipated that such individuals could be promptly located, engaged and trained.� As discussed below, dotTV maintains an in-house human resources department which also works in close association with idealab!�s human resources group.� DPC will be able to draw upon dotTV�s recruitment resources for assistance in meeting its personnel needs.\n\nPersonnel will be selected, hired, trained, compensated and promoted with regard to their experience, education, skills and work performance.� DPC will encourage employees to pursue additional studies, training and development to enhance their skills and abilities.\n\nDPC will obtain office space adequate to meet the requirements of its anticipated staff levels and accommodate foreseeable expansion needs.� As discussed below, dotTV proposes to relocate in November, 2000 to new office space which would have sufficient capacity to house DPC�s personnel.\n\ndotTV:\n\nAs of September 25, 2000, dotTV employed 64 people in senior management, marketing, business development, finance, technology, legal, sales, customer service and administration positions and anticipates the full-time employee headcount to increase to 90 by the end of 2000 and to 133 by the end of 2001.� This rapid headcount expansion began from a base of approximately 5 employees in April, 2000, evidencing dotTV�s ability to aggressively recruit and hire talented individuals.\n\nIndividuals are selected, hired, trained, compensated and promoted with regard to their experience, education, skills and work performance.� dotTV encourages employees to pursue additional studies, training and development to enhance their skills and abilities.\n\nIt is anticipated that in November, 2000 dotTV will be occupying a new facility with approximately 20,000 - 25,000 square feet that will accommodate up to 150 employees.\n\ndotTV anticipates that its current staff expansion plans will be adequate to accommodate the projected increase in registration volume and customer contacts arising in connection with the functions it will assume under the outsourcing arrangement with DPC.� dotTV maintains an in-house human resources department which also works in close association with idealab!�s human resources group.� In the event additional personnel are required by dotTV and/or DPC, the recruitment resources of dotTV and idealab! can be called upon to promptly locate, engage and train the required additional personnel.\n\nD13.1.8.� Commercial general liability insurance.� Address/include amount of insurance policy, provider of policy, plans for

registry operations.� This section should present a comprehensive business plan for the proposed registry operations.� In addition to providing basic information concerning the viability of the proposed operations, this section offers the registry operator an opportunity to demonstrate that it has carefully analyzed the financial and operational aspects of the proposal.� At a minimum, factors that should be addressed� are:\n\nD13.2.1.� Services to be provided.� A full description of the registry services to be provided.�\n\nThe registration function includes determining whether proposed domain names are available, establishing accounts which include entering registrant contact information and transacting the financial transaction.\n\nDPC will register domain names in .pro indirectly through distribution arrangements with registrars worldwide.� All ICANN accredited registrars will be welcome to perform registrar functions in connection with .pro.� To promote the introduction of .pro, DPC will utilize various marketing tools including online and offline marketing.\n\nCustomer and technical support services will also be provided as described in D15.2.14 below.\n\nD13.2.2.� Revenue Model.� A full description of the revenue model, including rates to be charged for various services.�\n\nDPC will establish an operational infrastructure modeled on dotTV�s organization, (incorporating the functions outlined in D13.1.7.) which will administer and be responsible for all registry functions.� Generally, all management, marketing, business development, finance/administrative and legal functions will be performed directly by DPC through its own staff.� All technical functions will be outsourced to dotTV under contract.� dotTV�s experience in administering a TLD registry will assure DPC of seamless back-end operations.�\n\nRevenue:\n\nIt is anticipated that virtually all DPC�s income will be revenue received from its registrar relationships in the form of standard fixed fees.� DPC does not intend to control the end prices which registrars charge to their customers.� However, DPC is attempting to reduce the rate charged to registrants by offering a competitive rate to its registrars.� A relatively small amount of additional income may be generated from ancillary sources including website advertising, however, this has not been factored into our calculations.\n\nThis pricing model should ensure a high level of competition in� the domain name registration market not seen with .com, .net, and .org domain names until very recently.�\n\nPricing:\n\nDPC proposes to price new gTLD names at a fixed $3.50 per registration.� At this pricing level, DPC believes it can make a reasonable rate of return and at the same time provide a low cost alternative for registrars.\n\nRevenue and pricing models are illustrated in the attached Exhibit D.\n\nD13.2.3.� Market.� Market definition, size, demand, accessibility.�\n\nThere is a tremendous domestic and international market opportunity for domain name registrations.� The demand for domain names is expected to explode to more than 140 million names by 2003.� With 20 million registrations as of July 2000, market penetration is only 14% and is being driven by the most fundamental factors: growth in the number of companies engaging in business-to-consumer and business-to-business e-commerce and the growing acceptance of the Web as a communications medium.\n\nAlthough domain name registrations have been occurring for over six years, a substantial portion of the growth in these registrations has occurred more recently.� Approximately 75% of all domain names were registered in the 18 months ended September 30, 1999 and over 50% were registered in the 12 months ended September 30, 1999. During the nine months ended September 30, 1999, a total of approximately 3.6 million new .com, .net and .org domain names were registered worldwide, an increase of 89% over the 2 million new domain names registered in all of 1998.�� DPC believes that the market for domain name registrations will continue to grow driven by individuals' and businesses' desire for an online identity and brand, the need to promote products, services and events, and the emergence of the Internet as a communications platform.� As of May 2000, an estimated 75,000 to 90,000 domain names were being registered each day.\n\nYear\n\nDomains (MM)\n\n1998\n\n5\n\n1999\n\n13\n\n2000\n\n27\n\n2001\n\n49\n\n2002\n\n85\n\n2003\n\n140\n\nThe professional and business communities are expected to account for over 90 million domain registrations over this time period (source: Bear Sterns):\n\nCategory\n\nDomains (2003; MM)\n\nPersonal Names\n\n50\n\nProducts & Services\n\n40\n\nU.S. Business\n\n10\n\nEvents\n\n10\n\nInternational Business\n\n30\n\nTotal\n\n140\n\nThe popular .com top-level domain is saturated, leaving few widely recognizable, high-quality domain names.� An active secondary market has developed for quality domain names ending in .com, and other TLDs such as .tv, .ws, .cc, and other country codes.� There is a tangible need for a new gTLD that addresses the needs of the global business community.� The �Statement of Policies� section of this application addresses DPC�s proposed solution.\n\nD13.2.4 Marketing plan.� Advertising, publicity, promotion strategy, advertisement development strategy, relationship with advertising firm.� Use of registrars and other marketing channels\n\nDPC�s dedicated Marketing Department will work with their dotTV counterparts to formulate and implement an advertising and marketing strategy for the introduction of .pro.� It can be expected that the introduction of .pro in itself will generate enormous public awareness.�� Consequently, the marketing strategy to be applied in respect to .pro is expected to be significantly scaled down from that needed to brand a TLD such as the .tv ccTLD.� Notwithstanding the differences in focus and scale between the .tv and proposed new gTLD campaigns, DPC will be greatly advantaged by being able to draw on dotTV�s expertise and experiences.\n\ndotTV has already gained significant knowledge on how to best market new TLDs.� The .tv TLD was successfully launched in April 2000 and continues to grow at an impressive rate.� Positioned as the domain for the new generation of richer and more engaging online experiences, .tv has received traction from all over the world.\n\nThe dotTV marketing team consists of a group that has diverse experience in both online and offline marketing from the following companies: The Clorox Company, Nestl� USA, eHow.com, Stamps.com and various advertising and public relations agencies.� The company is confident that it can best position and subsequently market .pro to maximize the market opportunity.\n\nIn connection with the introduction of .pro, DPC will have the opportunity to leverage the experience gained by dotTV from its launching the .tv TLD and to utilize various proven marketing tools including online advertising and public relations.� In view of the significant press attention which is expected to be directed at the introduction of .pro, DPC will endeavor to maximize the exposure and promotion of .pro through extensive public relations initiatives.� In this regard, it is anticipated that DPC would engage the services of the global public relations agency, Edelman Communications, which currently provides PR services for dotTV.�\n\nThe extensive PR campaign will be supplemented by online and other direct marketing efforts that will be two-pronged:\n\n1.� To end-users � principally including advertising on registration sites around the world which dotTV has already tested and proved to be highly effective in promoting the adoption of domain names.\n\n2.� To distribution partners - this will be a direct effort by DPC�s marketing team to ensure that registrars around the world are well aware that they can, on an automated basis, download the DPC API and begin registering .pro from day one.� By the time that .pro is formally approved and introduced, dotTV expects to have in place formal distribution arrangements with registrar partners that register over 80% of all Internet domain names worldwide.� dotTV will leverage these arrangement for the benefit of DPC, thereby providing DPC and .pro with a broad distribution network from inception.\n\nBeyond the initial phase of introduction, DPC will market .pro principally through additional online advertising and co-marketing programs with its distribution partners.� Focus will be placed on vehicles that best support the continued growth of .pro.\n\nAnticipated marketing expenses in connection with the above plan vary based on the estimated demand levels.� DPC proposes to expend approximately 70% of estimated new registration revenue in year one on marketing to promote the TLD.� Based on that assumption, marketing costs for the first year would range between $1.6 million (applying the 90% confidence figures) and $2 million (applying the 10% confidence figures).� In subsequent years marketing would be scaled back to an amount equal to 10% of new revenue commitments based on the assumption that DPC�s registrar partners would each implement marketing campaigns attracting registrants to their respective websites.�\n\nD13.2.5 Estimated demand for registry services in the new TLD.� Projected total demand for registry services in the TLD, effect of projected registration fees, competition.� Please provide estimates for at least 10%, 50% and 90% confidence.\n\nHaving regard to the statistics discussed under D13.2.3 and dotTV�s experiences, DPC expects that the number of registrations in the first year will range from 385,000 (applying the 90% confidence figures) to 1.2 million (applying the 10% confidence figures).� By the end of the fifth year, the cumulative number of registrations is expected to range between 5 million (applying the 90% confidence figures) and 17 million (applying the 10% confidence figures).\n\n10%, 50% and 90% confidence projections detailing the above are incorporated in the revenue tables attached as Exhibit D.�\n\nThe 10% projections assume approximately 17 million new gTLD registrations over a five year period and further assume an annual non-renewal rate of 25%.� Projected registrations during the first month are estimated to be approximately 65,000, with ensuing growth at a monthly rate of approximately 4.9% during year one and decreasing to 2.5% in year five.�\n\nThe 50% projections assume approximately 10 million new gTLD registrations over a five year period and further assume an annual non-renewal rate of 25%.� Projected registrations during the first month are estimated to be approximately 40,000, with ensuing growth at a monthly rate of� 4.8% during year one and decreasing to 2.4% in year five.�\n\nThe 90% projections assume approximately 5 million new gTLD registrations over a five year period and further assume an annual non-renewal rate of 25%.� Projected registrations during the first month are estimated to be approximately 25,000, with ensuing growth at a monthly rate of 4.1% during year one and decreasing to 2.1% in year five.\n\nD13.2.6.

Provide a detailed estimate of all resources (financial, technical, staff, physical plant, customer service, etc.) required to meet the estimated demands, using at least the 10%, 50%, and 90% confidence levels.\n\nOverview\n\nDPC will put in place all resources necessary to meet demands with regard to the operation of .pro registry.� DPC will administer and be responsible for all registry functions.� Generally, all management, marketing, business development, finance/administrative, and legal functions will be performed directly by DPC through its own staff.� All technical functions will be outsourced to dotTV under contract enabling DPC to take advantage of dotTV�s existing state-of-the-art registry infrastructure, subject to oversight and direction from DPC�s Chief Technical Officer.�\n\nDuring the initial phases of operation, DPC will draw on the management, personnel and other resources of dotTV to assist with the establishment and operation of the new registry.�\n\ndotTV is the exclusive registry and the leading registrar for the second level domain names within the .tv top level domain.� As a registry, dotTV maintains the master directory of all the second level domain names which include registrations, modifications, transfers, re-registrations or deletions for new and existing second level domain names.� The experience dotTV possesses as an exclusive registry for the .tv ccTLD will be leveraged to meet the demands of administering the operations of a new gTLD.� The excess capacity within dotTV�s current business plan will absorb much of the additional resources necessary to provide outsourced registry services to DPC with regard to .pro.�\n\nFinancial Resources\n\nThe estimated operational costs of DPC are set forth in D13.2.11 below.\n\ndotTV and its consortium partners will ensure that DPC receives adequate financial resources to meet the demands associated with the establishment and operation of the .pro registry, with each of the consortium members contributing a share of the required resources in proportion to its equity ownership.� In the event that one or more of dotTV�s consortium partners elect not to participate in the consortium, dotTV either alone, or with the remaining members of the consortium, will assume all funding and financial responsibilities in connection with DPC�s operations.\n\ndotTV raised $2 million from the sale of Series A Preferred Stock and an additional $7.9 million from the issuance of convertible debt.� As of August 31, 2000, dotTV had approximately $5.4 million in cash in its bank account remaining from these initial financings.�\n\nStaffing\n\nThe staffing requirements of DPC and means by which staff will be located, engaged and trained are discussed above under D13.1.7.\n\n�\n\nFacilities\n\nAll technical registry functions will be outsourced to dotTV under contract enabling DPC to take advantage of dotTV�s existing state-of-the-art registry infrastructure, subject to oversight and direction from DPC�s Chief Technical Officer.\n\ndotTV is located within Idealab�s facilities in Pasadena, California and maintains international offices in London and Hong Kong.� The corporate headquarters has been located in Pasadena since its inception.� dotTV is currently looking for new office space for its corporate headquarters.� The new corporate headquarters would be sufficient to house the incremental number of people necessary to provide outsourced registry services to DPC for .pro and, additionally, to house DPC�s business operations.\n\ndotTV currently has five geographically located DNS centers located around the world.� There are two vault enclosed data centers for the main web servers and DNS servers located at Exodus Communication collocation facilities in Santa Clara, California and� Sterling, Virginia.� There are three other locations for DNS servers, two in Exodus Communication cage spaces in� Tokyo, Japan and London, UK and the third is in ISI/USC collocation space in Los Angeles, California. In addition, there are two locations under lease which would house two additional DNS servers and will likely be located in New York City and Australia.� Each of these locations has capacity that could be used to store additional equipment if necessary.� DPC proposes to utilize all the above established state-of-the-art facilities thereby keeping establishment costs to a minimum.\n\ndotTV and its consortium partners will ensure that DPC is adequately funded to enable it to lease any facilities or acquire any equipment required in connection with the new registry.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nDPC will establish a technical support system modeled on dotTV�s existing system described below.� It is important to note, however, that as DPC will conduct business solely through registrars and not directly with customers, DPC�s support system will be adapted and principally geared to address questions and problems arising at the registrar level.� It is anticipated that customer support for end consumers will be provided by the registrars.\n\ndotTV�s existing customer support organization is available 24x7.� dotTV supplements its own in-house customer service staff through the use of an outsourced service, PeopleSupport.� In addition to their services, dotTV utilizes support representatives that can interact with customers in a number of different languages, in particular Korean, German, Spanish, Chinese, and French.� A full featured Customer Relationship Manager system with phone system integration is in the final stages of being implemented.� This full service system is expected to be in wide use by the end of 2000.� When in place, the system will track all customer contacts, whether they be by email, phone or referral.� Integration with the phone switch will allow �screen pops� of customer data based on the caller id information that arrives with each call.\n\nD13.2.7. Plans for acquiring necessary systems and facilities. Describe plans for acquiring all necessary systems and facilities for providing the proposed services at each estimated demand level. Provide details as to the scope, cost, and vendor for any significant planned outsourcing.\n\nDPC will put in place all systems and facilities necessary to meet the demands of the .pro registry; however, it is proposed that all technical functions in connection with the operation of the .pro registry will be outsourced to dotTV, subject to oversight and direction from DPC�s Chief Technical Officer.� Under this arrangement, dotTV would provide most of the required systems and technical facilities within its existing infrastructure described below.\n\ndotTV currently operates a state-of-the-art registry for the .tv ccTLD which is based on the SRS (shared registration system) model.� The database used for the registry is IBM�s DB2 Enterprise-Extended Edition.� The application working on top of the database provides important registry functions such as adding, deleting, and modifications of data which are an integral part of a registry�s business.� dotTV has dedicated considerable resources to developing and implementing systems that are state of the art in today�s registry business, yet scalable, at an incremental cost, to meet the needs resulting from future growth of dotTV�s existing business and the integration of registry functions in connection with the operation of new gTLD registry.� These systems will be made available to DPC and leveraged and scaled accordingly.\n\ndotTV and its consortium partners will ensure that DPC is adequately funded to enable it to implement or acquire any additional systems or technical facilities required in connection with DPC�s operation of the new registry.\n\nEstimated costs in connection with the proposed outsourcing arrangement are set forth in the attached Exhibit E.\n\nD13.2.8. Staff size/expansion capability. Plans for obtaining the necessary staff resources, capacity for expansion, hiring policy, employee training, space for additional staff, staffing levels needed for provision of expanded technical, support, escrow, and registry services.\n\nDPC�s staffing requirements and expansion plans and capabilities are discussed above under D13.1.7.\n\nD13.2.9. Availability of additional management personnel. How will management needs be filled?\n\nThe availability and recruitment of management personnel for DPC is discussed above under D13.1.7.\n\nD13.2.10. Term of registry agreement. State assumptions regarding the term of any registry agreement with ICANN or the sponsoring organization. Note that the .com/.net/.org registry agreement has a basic term of four years.\n\nDPC requests a term of at least five years for the initial registry agreement with ICANN subject to automatic extensions thereafter for additional five year periods in perpetuity subject to DPC�s adherence to the terms of its agreement with ICANN.�\n\nD13.2.11. Expected costs associated with the operation of the proposed registry. Please break down the total estimated operational costs by the sources of the costs for each estimated demand level. Be sure to consider the TLD's share of ICANN's cost recovery needs.\n\nExpected costs associated with the operation of the .pro registry are set forth in the attached Exhibit F.\n\nAll technical functions with regard to the operation of the new registry will be outsourced to dotTV.� The primary technical costs associated with the operation of the registry are employee compensation, additional storage space for the new registry database and rent for additional space where the DNS servers are located.� As dotTV already has an established infrastructure, these incremental costs would be significantly less then that of a new registry.\n\nEach of the demand levels for general and administrative expenses applies variable rates to determine projected costs based on new registration commitments obtained each year.� This allocation method allows costs to increase based on growth in the number of new domain registrations as opposed to other factors such as revenue.� Each of the three demand levels applies the same percentage assumptions, thus the 10% confidence level will incur more cost than the 90% confidence level.� The following are the assumptions used to estimate general and administrative expenses:\n\nCompensation is calculated at 15% of new commitment revenue for years one and two and 10% for years three through five.�� Further explanation of employee growth is provided in D13.1.7 above.\n\nProfessional fees are calculated at 12% for all five years in the projections.� Included in professional fees are external legal, accounting and other consulting fees which were allocated at the rates of 5%, 3% and 4% respectively.\n\nRecruiting is calculated at 4% percent of new commitments for year one and 2% for years two through five.� The requirement for employees will be high in year one as DPC aggregates a strong team to manage the operation of the .pro registry.� Recruiting fees will decrease in years two through five as DPC�s headcount increases incrementally with new registrations.\n\nTravel, meals and entertainment are computed using a 4% rate for all five years.� These costs will remain flat over time but will be utilized by different departments each year.� For example, marketing will represent a major portion of these costs during year one due to promotion of .pro.� Business Development and Technical departments will increase in subsequent years as the number of registrations increase.\n\nInsurance is calculated using a 2% rate for each of the next five years based on dotTV�s projected insurance rates.\n\n�\n\nOffice expense is calculated using a 6% rate for all five years.� These are fixed costs which will increase slightly with the growth of the registry.� Office expense includes rent, telecommunications costs and other expenses which are allocated at 2%, 3% and 1% or new registration revenue respectively.\n\nIn addition, the projections contemplate a cost recovery fee payable to ICANN.� This fee represents a variable amount calculated based on the number of new .pro registrations.� The fee is calculated at a rate of $1 per new gTLD registration subject to a maximum annual payment of $1 million.�\n\nApplying the 90% certainty demand level model, fees payable to ICANN are estimated to range from $385,000 in year one and would be subject to the $1 million annual cap by year four for a total of $3,950,000 over the five year period.�\n\nApplying the 50% certainty demand level model, fees payable to ICANN are estimated to range from $643,000 in year one and would be subject to the $1 million annual cap by year two for a total of $4,643,000 over the five year period.�\n\nApplying the 10% certainty demand level model, fees payable to ICANN would be subject to the $1 million annual cap during each year for a total of $5,000,000 over the five year period.\n\nThe sum of these expenses support the general and administrative expenses for each demand level.� Depending on the level of funding reasonably required by ICANN, the fee payable may be subject to adjustment up or down.\n\nD13.2.12. Expected revenue associated with the operation of the proposed registry. Please show how expected revenue is computed at each estimated demand level.\n\nIt is anticipated that virtually all DPC�s income will be revenue received from its registrar relationships in the form of standard fixed fees.� A relatively small amount of additional income may be generated from ancillary sources including website advertising; however, this has not been factored into our calculations.\n\nThe 10% certainty projections assume approximately 17 million new gTLD registrations over a five year period generating revenue at a rate of $3.50 per registration and further assumes an annual non-renewal rate of 25% over years two through five.� Annual revenue commitments were calculated assuming 65,000 registrations in the first month with ensuing growth at a monthly rate ranging from 4.9% in year one to 2.5% in year five.� The 10% model projects approximately $104.7 million in revenue commitments over a five year period.\n\nThe 50% certainty projections assume approximately 10 million new gTLDs registrations over a five year period generating revenue at a rate of $3.50 per registration and further assumes an annual non-renewal rate of 25% over years two through five.� Annual revenue commitments were calculated assuming 40,000 registrations in the first month with ensuing growth at a monthly rate ranging from 4.8% in year one to 2.4% in year five.� The 50% model projects approximately $61.9 million in revenue commitments over a five year period.\n\nThe 90% certainty projections assume approximately 5 million new gTLDs registrations over a five year period generating revenue at a rate of $3.50 per registration and further assumes an annual non-renewal rate of 25% over years two through five.� Annual revenue commitments were calculated assuming 25,000 registrations in the first month with ensuing growth at a monthly rate ranging from 4.1% in year one to 2.1% in year five.� The 50% certainty model projects approximately $31.8 million in revenue commitments over a five year period.\n\nSee the tables in Exhibit D which illustrate the above.\n\nD13.2.13. Capital requirements. Quantify capital requirements in amount and timing and describe how the capital will be obtained. Specify in detail all sources of capital and the cost of that capital (interest, etc.). Evidence of firm commitment of projected capital needs will substantially increase the credibility of the\n\nregistry operator's proposal.\n\nDPC will receive all necessary capital from dotTV and its consortium partners.� The equity ownership arrangements among the partners are not yet finalized.� In the event that one or more of the consortium participants elect not to participate, dotTV either alone or with the remaining consortium members, will assume all of DPC�s liabilities and obligations. �Information regarding dotTV�s ability to meet all of DPC�s capital requirements is set out D13.4.4 below.\n\nAs all of the technical functions with regard to the operation of the new registry will be outsourced to dotTV existing registry operations, the capital requirements of DPC are projected to be quite modest.� Based on the 90% demand model, approximately $2 million of investment capital is necessary before DPC begins to generate positive cash flow in the second quarter of year two.� DPC will recoup the losses generated in the first five quarters by the first quarter of year four.� The large cash flow losses in the first year are primarily attributable to DPC�s aggressive marketing campaign and the modest $3.50 fee charged to registrars, which generates less revenue than current market rates.\n\ndotTV and its consortium partners anticipate that an initial investment of approximately $4 million will be necessary to give DPC an adequate cash position to support any unforeseen market conditions that may arise.\n\nD13.2.14. Business risks and opportunities. Describe upside and downside contingencies you have considered and discuss your plans for addressing them.\n\nBusiness Opportunities:\n\nMore efficiently operate new gTLD registry leveraging dotTV�s registry experience.\n\nMaximize the exposure and acceptance of .pro through dotTV�s existing distribution channels and other INANN-accredited registrars.\n\nPromote competition in the gTLD registry arena through DPC�s competitive pricing model.\n\nEnhance the utility of the DNS through innovation.\n\nEnhance the number of available domain names.\n\nTest the feasibility and utility of different types of new TLDs.\n\nTest the efficacy of different procedures for launching new TLDs.\n\nWork closely with ICANN to devise and implement TLD policy.\n\nBusiness Risks:\n\nCompetition:\n\nThird level domain name providers.\n\nCountry code registries.\n\nRegistries of existing TLDs.\n\nRegistries of potential new TLDs.\n\nDomain name resellers.\n\nRevenue:\n\nPricing pressures.\n\nBundled service offerings that include domain name registrations.\n\nRegulatory and Legal:\n\nTermination of agreements by the Department of Commerce or ICANN.\n\nThe Department of Commerce could revoke its recognition of ICANN.\n\nForeign governments may disagree with the policies of ICANN.\n\nClaims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights.\n\nBurdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws.\n\nInternet Usage:\n\nReduced rate of demand for domain names.\n\nHigher than expected non-renewal rate of domain names.\n\nReduced rate of growth in Internet usage.\n\nChanges in the Internet navigation system impacting domain name usage.\n\nTechnical:\n\nSystem failure or interruption.\n\nSecurity breaches.\n\nSystem strain due to inability to meet increasing demands.\n\nNatural disaster.\n\nHacking, computer viruses or sabotage.\n\nPower loss.\n\nFinancial:\n\nGeneral downturn in market and economic conditions.\n\nDownturn in market conditions affecting technology and Internet stocks generally.\n\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual registrations or operating results.\n\nUnfavorable industry conditions and trends.\n\nD13.2.15. Registry failure provisions. Please describe in detail your plans for dealing with the possibility of registry failure.\n\nRegistry failure provisions could take a number of different forms.� Registry failure may arise as an artifact of business decisions or from a literal failure of some portion of the registry infrastructure itself.\n\nIn the case of an infrastructure breakdown, dotTV�s technical staff, under the oversight of DPC�s Chief Technical Officer, would immediately diagnose the issues and resolve in as timely a way as possible.� With the level of redundancy that exists in dotTV�s infrastructure there is a low probability of this happening.� If the breakdown is caused by a natural disaster of one type or another, dotTV�s disaster recovery site will still be up and functional.� dotTV has chosen sites on the east and west coasts of the US to minimize the probability of both sites being impacted by any single disaster.\n\nIn the event of a business problem failure, all the registry data could be transferred to an ICANN approved agency to assume the gTLD�s registry responsibilities.� The key information is the database table structure.� The data will be maintained in dotTV�s commercial database; IBM�s DB2, so any DB2 DBA should be able to work with the dotTV�s documented data format to export the data to any other data base the new transferee registry may be using.\n\nIf DPC/dotTV�s registry staff is no longer available to help with the transition, then an ICANN representative would need to work with the escrow service to obtain the most recently archived database and recreate the data in a new database.� This process would be similar to the earlier discussed process but without the help of staff familiar with the database structure.� Clearly the former is a more desirable situation in the case of a registry failure, but in either case, the proposed recovery plans should ensure minimal disruption, if any, to the day to day operation of the gTLD name resolution services.\n\nD13.3. Pro-forma financial projections. Please provide detailed pro-forma financial projections, consistent with your business plan, for the demand scenarios that you estimate under item D13.2.5. The pro-formas should show revenue and expense estimates broken down by detailed categories and should be broken down into periods no longer than quarterly.\n\nSee the financial projections attached as Exhibit G.\n\nD13.4.1. Registry operator's organizational documents. Documents of incorporation (or similar documents).\n\nSee Exhibit H for organizational documents of dotTV.\n\nD13.4.2. References. A list of significant trade and credit references.\n\nSee Exhibit I.\n\nD13.4.3. Annual report. The registry operator's most recent annual financial report (or similar document). Audited financials are preferred.\n\nDPC:�\n\nDPC is not yet operational and has not prepared any annual financial reports.\n\ndotTV:�\n\ndotTV has been operational since April 2000.� dotTV is currently in the process of being audited by Pricewaterhouse Coopers for the year ended December 31, 1999 and the nine months ended September 30, 2000.� Internal interim financial statements through August, 2000 are attached as Exhibit J.�\n\nD13.4.4. Proof of capital. Provide evidence of existing capital or firm commitments of capital. Demonstrated access to necessary capital will be carefully scrutinized.\n\nDPC will receive all necessary capital funding and financial support from dotTV and its consortium partners.� As financing arrangements are yet to be finalized among the consortium members, for the purposes of this application it can be assumed that dotTV will furnish 100% of DPC�s capital.� Information regarding dotTV�s ability to meet all of DPC�s capital requirements is set out below.\n\ndotTV has raised $2 million from the sale of Series A Preferred Stock and an additional $8 million from the issuance of convertible debt.� As of August 31, 2000, dotTV had approximately $5.4 million in cash in its bank account.�\n\nD13.4.5. Proof of insurance. Please provide proof of the insurance described in item D13.1.8.\n\nPART III.� TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES AND PLAN\n\nD15.1. Detailed description of the registry operator's technical capabilities. This should provide a detailed description of the registry operator's technical capabilities, including information about key technical personnel (qualifications and experience), size of technical workforce, and access to systems development tools. It should also describe the registry operator's significant past achievements. This description offers the registry operator an opportunity to demonstrate the extent of its technical expertise in activities relevant to the operation of the proposed registry.\n\nDPC will outsource to dotTV all technical functions with regard to the .pro registry, drawing upon dotTV�s existing technical capabilities.�\n\nThe technical personnel within dotTV responsible for oversight of the outsourced services will comprise a core group of experienced and skilled staff.� In addition to this base of seasoned personnel, new staff would be engaged as required to meet increased demands resulting from the operation of .pro.�\n\ndotTV�s current core personnel includes a highly experienced staff of business,� marketing and technical experts.� dotTV�s Vice President of Technology has 15+ years experience in enterprise-wide academic computing, covering all aspect of computer service for two world-class institutions, the University of California, Berkeley and University of Southern California.� The three technology directors have noteworthy experience in e-commerce activity as well as Internet data center development and deployment.� Two of dotTV�s technical directors developed and implemented the infrastructure for the online retailer, eToys.\n\nOther technical staff brings with them extensive database management and design experience, programming skills in modern web languages of PERL and JAVA, and top of class enterprise network design and management skills.\n\nFurther information regarding the qualifications and experience of dotTV�s technical personnel is contained in Exhibit M.\n\nD15.2.1. General description of proposed facilities and systems. Address all locations of systems. Provide diagrams of all of the systems operating at each location. Address the specific types of systems being used, their capacity, and their interoperability, general availability, and level of security. Describe in detail buildings, hardware, software systems, environmental equipment, Internet connectivity, etc.\n\nUnder its outsourcing arrangement with dotTV, DPC will utilize dotTV�s existing deployed infrastructure for the .tv ccTLD as described below.\n\ndotTV�s facilities include two vault enclosed data centers for the main web servers, DNS servers and database servers located in Exodus Communication collocation facilities in Santa Clara, CA and Sterling, VA.� Each operates independently yet can provide fail over disaster recovery for each other.\n\nIn addition, there are three other locations for DNS servers, two in Exodus Communication cage spaces in Tokyo and London, and the third in ISI/USC collocation space in Los Angeles.\n\nThere are two additional locations under lease.� One is with Global Center Communications and the other with Abovenet.� The locations for these two additional DNS centers are still pending but it is anticipated that they will be in Australia and New York City.\n\ndotTV utilizes the services of UltraDNS, which has a worldwide net of 13+ DNS centers and provides a different DNS technology than the conventional BIND technology used at all of the other locations.� This new technology layers DNS resolution on top of enterprise size Oracle databases and uses some very efficient and innovative BGP routing procedures to allow the advertising of only two DNS name server names and addresses while the BGP routing insures that the requestor will be serviced by the closest UltraDNS server, independent of where the requestor is geographically located.\n\nSee Exhibit N for a map identifying the locations detailed and a description of the hardware deployed at the locations.� In brief, there is a diversity of collocation spaces, networking equipment, and operating systems to insure that in the event of a denial of service attack focused on one OS or brand of networking hardware, some set of DNS and data centers would not be directly impacted by the DOS attack.\n\nExodus Communication was chosen as the main collocation provider because they were able to offer us a fully enclosed vault space within their data center space.� Thus we benefit from the extreme lengths that a world class collocation service goes to insure availability of clean power and two levels of backup power (batteries and generators), redundant HVAC systems, multiple network paths, and physical security for center access and building integrity to best manage any disaster.\n\nFoundy Networks and Extreme Networks are the networking vendors, both are high quality vendors and young enough to still be cutting edge with regard to new technologies.� VA Linux servers are used for web server clusters as well as for DNS server clusters.� The clusters are composed of ten servers for each function, ten web servers for that function and ten for the DNS function.� These are configured in two stacks with different network feeds to each stack.\n\nLastly, each center has a pair of management servers to monitor and report status to a central Network Operations Center.� There is also serial console management node which allows routine and emergency management of all servers at the center from a central office location.\n\nSee Exhibit N containing diagrams of dotTV�s current and proposed data center architecture.\n\nD15.2.2. Registry-registrar model and protocol. Please describe in detail.\n\nUnder its outsourcing arrangement with dotTV, DPC will utilize dotTV�s current registry-registrar model and protocol as described below.� The .pro registry will operate under dotTV�s current SRS model.� This protocol has been extended to include significant security enhancements to prevent domain hijacking and is more capable of handling increased volume than the current SRS model.�\n\nD15.2.3. Database capabilities. Database size, throughput, scalability, procedures for object creation, editing, and deletion, change notifications, registrar transfer procedures, grace period implementation, reporting capabilities, etc.\n\nThe web user interface application operates on top of the database.� This application has been used by dotTV for a number of months providing registry functions for the .tv ccTLD.� It incorporates requisite adding, deleting, and modification of data routinely as part of a registry's business.� Features include durations of registrations, reminder of renewals, and financial reporting.\n\nD15.2.4. Zone file generation. Procedures for changes, editing by registrars, updates. Address frequency, security, process, interface, user authentication, logging, data back-up.\n\nUnder its outsourcing arrangement with dotTV, DPC�s zone file generation procedures will conform with those currently followed by dotTV with regard to the .tv ccTLD registry as described below.\n\ndotTV currently updates zone files twice daily and proposes to increase this to 4 or 6 times a day.� Infrastructure is in place which will allow this level of update without straining the existing infrastructure and not becoming too dependent upon Internet availability.� Updates occur over an SSH connection with each version of the zone file also stored in a CVS file store for retrieval and versioning needs, with security and MD5 encryption to insure accurate and complete transmission of the data.\n\nDNS logging records all activity in the database centers and DNS zone files on a continuous basis.� The zone files are backed up and archived.\n\nEach of dotTV�s two web and database Data Centers have automated tape back-up to a DLT jukebox, in accordance with best practices for Data Center back-up (including integrity testing, etc.).� In addition, these tapes will be rotated to an off-site storage facility for long-term, secure storage.�\n\ndotTV�s previously described infrastructure is capable of recording and archiving all transactions, correspondence and communications.\n\nD15.2.5. Zone file distribution and publication. Locations of nameservers, procedures for and means of distributing zone files to them.\n\nUnder its outsourcing arrangement with dotTV, DPC�s zone file distribution and publication procedures will conform with those currently followed by dotTV with regard to the .tv ccTLD registry as described below.\n\ndotTV�s current registry structure includes five geographically located DNS centers and a connection to UltraDNS.� The database is the definitive source of the DNS information and an extract of the database data is used to automatically generate the zone files on a 4-6 times a day schedule.\n\nTwo vault enclosed data centers for the main web servers and DNS servers are located in Exodus Communication collocation facilities in Santa Clara, CA and Sterling, VA.� In addition, there are three other locations for DNS servers, two in Exodus Communication cage spaces in Tokyo and London, with the third in ISI/USC collocation space in Los Angeles, CA.� dotTV is also using the services of the company, UltraDNS, which has a worldwide net of 13+ DNS centers and provides a different DNS technology than the conventional BIND 8.x technology used at all of the other locations.�\n\nAll of these sites receive updated zone files from the primary server in the Santa Clara data center.� Currently the widely used NOTIFY feature of BIND is being used to update the files.� As the size of the zone file increases, there is a plan to move from the updates happening on the public Internet to a leased line model to insure bandwidth availability and additional security of the transfers.\n\nD15.2.6. Billing and collection systems. Technical characteristics, system security, accessibility.\n\nBilling and collections functions will be modeled on dotTV�s existing systems and processes as described below.\n\ndotTV�s billing and collection systems is a classical online e-commerce model utilizing CyberSource transaction services.� In each data center, Santa Clara, CA and Sterling, VA, there is a two machine cluster for single credit card processing system only connected to the back network with a special connection to the commodity Internet for transaction purposes.� dotTV currently has in place all of the encryption and security procedures suggested and required by credit card processing facilities.� The security on dotTV�s existing credit card server system is the highest of any system at the data center.\n\nD15.2.7. Data escrow and backup. Frequency and procedures for backup of data.
