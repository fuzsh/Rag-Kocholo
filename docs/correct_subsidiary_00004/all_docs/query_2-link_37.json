Salmon About the Author Larry M. Edwards is a new-media consultant specializing in Web site design, content development, and Internet marketing, which he has done since 1994. He has worked with dozens of companies and organizations, helping them establish a foothold on the electronic frontier. Edwards is an award-winning journalist and a former staff writer for the San Diego Business Journal, where he covered the high-technology beat — including the growth and commercialization of the Internet and World Wide Web.

Acknowledgments A project of this magnitude is never a solo effort. It requires the assistance of a team of people to keep it on track and moving forward. Without the help of that support team, this book would not — could not — have been completed. First and foremost is my wife, Janis, who patiently tolerated my often reclu- sive and hermit-like behavior during the several months I devoted to this work. Her unflagging support — along with the fresh orange juice she squeezed most mornings — was invaluable in seeing the project through to the end. I gratefully acknowledge the editors at Ventana Communications who offered me spirited support and assistance, ensuring this book was the best it could possibly be — Acquisitions Editor JJ Hohn, the ever cheerful Project Editor Rachel Anderson, Copy Editor Norma \"Eagle Eye\" Emory, Kristin Miller, Scott Hosa, Patrick Berry, Ginny Phelps, and Becky Steele. I single out for special recognition Development Editor Paul \"Coach\" Cory, who dished out enthusiastic encouragement along with the honest critiques and constructive feedback that kept me focused and on target. To Mark Burgess, president of sandiego.com, I shall be forever indebted for volunteering to be my mentor and for his sterling technical review of the pages herein. Also, cartoonist Kurt Snibbe, who added some fun to an other- wise dry subject; Martha Kaufman, my agent; Mike Emke, my script doctor; and Vince Casalaina, the vaunted viscount of video. Finally, I would like to thank those who gave me a helping hand when I first stumbled into cyberspace to stake my claim on the electronic frontier: my former partner Bruce Gresham, as well as the guys in what was then the Internet Techology Lab at Science Applications International Corporation. — L.

The Internet will grow. So no matter what your business, job, or particular investments, take a fresh look and con- sider how Internet commerce and practice will affect them. Because you can be sure it will affect them. — fames Flanigan, Los Angeles Times P kJ ongratulations! You've taken the first step in exploring and capitalizing on the promise of the Internet as a way to grow your business or perhaps start a new venture online. This is an exciting time, as people like you use the Internet's global communication infrastructure and electronic commerce to transform new business opportunities into business realities. The Internet — Coming of Age Less than four years ago, only a small percentage of people had even heard of the Internet, let alone had a clue what it was about. Even less had any knowl- edge of the fledgling World Wide Web, the newest and most vibrant compo- nent of the Internet. Today, both the Internet and World Wide Web routinely make headlines — and often are the subject of cartoons and stand-up comedy — as they become more prominent factors in our lives. XXII □FFtciAL Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit Exponential Growth The Internet, also dubbed the Information Superhighway, continues to grow at an exponential rate, doubling in size every year by some measures. Many business folks see this electronic frontier as a new land of opportunity, a place to stake a claim and take advantage of this increasingly important digital universe known as cyberspace. Yet, at the same time, the Internet is often intimidating to the uninitiated. That's probably why you picked up this book. The Internet, or just plain Net, is expanding and evolving at a head-spinning rate, and you'll likely see the acronym WWW as meaning the World \"Wild\" Web. You don't want to go stumbling blindly through the cyberwildemess, an uncharted frontier with a language and culture all its own. You seek professional guidance as to which path you should take and you seek a measure of protection from the con artists, schemers, and carpetbaggers you are sure to meet along the way. You don't want to become one of those people who succximbed to \"Internet Fever\" only to discover that WWW often refers to \"What Went Wrong?\" Eight-Step Guide The Official Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit: The Eight Essential Steps for Launching Your Business on the Net was written for you, a businessperson who has little or no experience with the Internet yet realizes that cyberspace offers new business opportunities and that you want a trail guide to lead the way. The book evolved from the numerous articles I've written and classes I've taught about doing business on the Net, and in response to the many ques- tions I get asked about how to do business online. This book is a by-the-numbers guidebook for establishing and growing a business in this still-untamed no-man's-land and the no-holds-barred, boomtown mentality that underlies it. Best of aU, you don't need to be one of the \"digiterati\" to put the powerful tools in this book to use. It's a concise, eight-step guide for migrating your business to the Internet using Netscape Communicator. Communicator is a multifaceted software program that opens the door to the Net and lets you send and receive e-mail, participate in online discussion groups, and compose your own Web pages. The book is designed and laid out for you, the businessperson, so you can make the move to ^e electronic frontier a successful one, avoiding the pitfalls into which others have tumbled. It comes with a Companion CD-ROM packed with useful templates, style guides, software, checklists, worksheets, online resources, and more. Introduction XXIII Using This Book To keep the book focused on its ultimate purpose, I have assumed that you're familiar with the use of a desktop computer and know how to use a computer mouse. If not, you should get some instruction in basic computing techniques before tackling the exercises in this book, because it is the computer that pro- vides your gateway to the Net, your window to the Web. That's not to say you can't get started right now if you're not well versed in computer use. You can learn computer basics while you're implementing the steps outlined in the book. While ^is book introduces Netscape Communicator and explains how to use some features of the software, this is not meant to be the definitive tome on the use of Communicator. I cover only the features needed to complete the exercises and tutorials in the book. For a complete Communicator reference, see the Official Netscape Communicator 4 Book by Phil James, published by Ventana. Conventions Used in This Book Throughout the book you will come across symbols spotlighting critical or useful information. These symbols include: H Tip: A hint on how to more easily accomplish something online or to use a shortcut to simplify the use of Netscape Communicator or other soft- ware. M Trap: Something to avoid to prevent the loss of precious time or resources. M CD-ROM icon: Signifies the availability of a resource or reference on the Companion CD-ROM. Making a \"Net\" Profit The Official Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit is divided into the eight essential steps you must take to ensure the success of your online venture, assuming your venture is based on a sound business model to begin with. Each step is further subdivided into relevant chapters, clearly laying out all the key elements neces- sary to successfully take a business to the Net and make it pay off. The book provides detailed checklists you can use to identify the most qualified independent contractors and service providers and to evaluate their work and performance. It also includes worksheets you can use to accurately assess your technological needs, as well as the human and financial resources you may need. XXIV □ fficial Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit Step 1: Get Online — Today If you're not online and haven't explored a bit of cyberspace first hand, then you shouldn't even think about trying to build the coolest Web site on the planet. You need to explore this new frontier before making financial and human- resource commitments. Otherwise, you're likely to make costly mistakes. The Net in a Nutshell To maximize the strengths of the Net, it's critical that you understand what it is — and what it is not. For starters, the Net is not synonymous with the World Wide Web. The Web is the newest component of the Net and the one getting the most attention, but it is not the most important in terms of Net users' priorities: That honor goes to electronic mail, or e-mail. Then there's the Usenet, a chaotic array of discussion groups covering every topic under the sun (and moon and stars). You need to become acquainted with it, too, if you're going to market your company's products and services successfully on the Net. Because the sum of these and other elements, which together make up the Internet, offers you a cost-effective marketing-communications medium. Get (Well) Connected For those who are not online or who are considering an upgrade to their current Internet access system, I introduce the types of services available — Internet access, e-mail. File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Telnet, Web site hosting, discussion groups — and the costs involved. I also provide a checklist for you to use when choosing an Internet service provider, or ISP. We'll look at the hardware requirements for going online — the computers, modems, and various types of network connections you may need and the options you have. A worksheet will guide you through the process of identify- ing your hardware, software, and training needs. Last, I'll take a peek at where the Internet technology is headed, so you can anticipate and plan for equip- ment and software upgrades. Select a Web Site Host You will need to determine whether to host the Web site yourself or hire a commercial ISP to host it for you. Compared to renting office space or opening a store, having a Web site is relatively inexpensive, but it may cost more than you've been led to believe. Introduction XXV This chapter will help you select a host for your Web site if (1) you're not going to host it yourself, or (2) you want to use someone other than your access pro- vider. It also covers the costs involved; a worksheet and checklist are included. A Domain of Your Own To make it easier for us humans to get around in cyberspace, where we're at the mercy of computers that comprehend only the ones and zeros of binary code, aliases were created so we could use familiar words and terms to repre- sent the numeric addresses assigned to the Internet's computers. These aliases are known as domain names. Having a unique domain name that clearly identifies your company is a powerful marketing tool, but the name needs to be chosen carefully. This book guides you through the process of choosing and registering a domain name and the costs involved. Step 2: Learn the Lay of the Land You wouldn't open a new business across town, let alone in another city or a foreign country, without scouting the territory first. Yet, that's what many people have done on the Internet. You need to get online and learn the lay of the land. Otherwise, you may end up flushing money down the cybertoilet. Exploring Cyberspace To get you started, I take you on a guided tour of cyberspace. You get a short tutorial on how to get around the Net efficiently and learn how to find busi- ness resources online. This will help you identify which of your competitors are online and how they're positioning themselves. During the cybertour, you'll browse the Web, use search engines to locate sources of online information, subscribe to and peek in on some discussion groups, learn the rules of Internet etiquette — known as Netiquette — and subscribe to a mailing list. The powerful software you'll use to take the tour through the cyberjungle is Netscape Communicator (shown in Figure I-l), a nifty computer program that allows you to surf the Web, send and receive e-mail, read and submit mes- sages to online discussion groups, and compose your own Web pages. Think of Communicator as a high-tech vehicle for navigating through cyberspace as XXVI Official Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit you market your wares, keep tabs on the competition, and open lines of com- munication with business associates, colleagues, and customers.

Introduction XXVil By following the steps IVe outlined, you will get hands-on experience in the use of Netscape Communicator. With it, you'll browse the Web, use search engines, and make bookmarks so you can find your way back to interesting Web sites. This includes the use of the Communicator Message Center, which is where you compose and send e-mail messages, retrieve and read e-mail sent to you, create an address book, develop mailing lists, as well as subscribe to your favorite discussion groups. Separate Fact From Fantasy If you can't separate the hype from the reality, you can't set realistic goals for going online. Some Internet drum beaters would have you believe there are two to three times the number of people online than found by reputable stud- ies. This chapter illustrates how to distinguish fact from fantasy and how to obtain the best estimates of current population figures and demographics of the Net and the Web. In addition, I introduce you to the types of businesses already proven successful on the Net, as well as new business opportunities, and show you how reducing overhead costs may be the best — and most profitable — ^reason for going online. I introduce you to news and information sources, online as well as offline, that you can use to stay on top of the rapid change that charac- terizes cyberspace. Belles-Lettres Electronic mail, or e-mail, will become an invaluable tool for you, if it isn't already. The key is getting comfortable with it and using it effectively. Netscape Communicator simplifies the process with its Message Center and Messenger Mailbox features. You'll quickly get the hang of e-mail basics, as well as learn how using a signature file and other forms of identification can further your marketing strategy. Security and privacy are critical when it comes to online communication, so I'll explain how digital identification and message encryption provide solu- tions for both of these issues. Within a business, these matters can ultimately affect the bottom line, so specific policies should be adopted regarding the use of e-mail for company and private correspondence. I'll point you to online resources you can use for help in forming such a policy. □fficial netscape Internet Business starter kit xxviii — Step 3: Devise an Internet Business Plan For business, the Internet is about marketing. However, many businesses went online early and only after the fact realized they had no clear direction for integrating this cyberventure into their existing business plan. Your purpose for being on the Net and how you position your company are critical. You need to practice due diligence and lay out a road map for leveraging this newest weapon in your marketing arsenal. Defining Your Online Strategy When going online, you need to be smart about it. You need to be clear on why you want your business online and what you hope to accomplish and redefine your mission and marketing message accordingly. I will help you identify the products or services you want to promote on the Internet and look at case studies of both successes and failures. A worksheet is included to help you establish your goals and identify the milestones you'll need to reach in order to achieve those goals. Planning Your Online Budget The costs of building a Web site range from $300 to $3 million, depending on the size and complexity of the site. Realistically, a small business should plan on spending anywhere between $2,000 and $20,000 the first year for the devel- opment and promotion of a marketing-oriented Web site. This section will help you establish a realistic budget by walking you through the budget-planning process. Using the accompanying worksheet and checklist, you'll identify the requirements and associated costs of start-up and ongoing activities as they pertain to the need for equipment, services, and human resources. This way, you can avoid a major pitfall: underestimating the development costs of a Web site. This includes an introduction to the three basic, but vastly different, types of Web sites: M Marketing: economy model il Publishing: high overhead M Online sales: costly start-up Introduction XXIX Step 4: Develop a Well-Designed Web Site Note that this is Step 4, not Step 1, although many people have made the mistake of starting here. Building a Web site is the biggest and costliest step you'll take. Thoughtful planning and preparation are a given. At the same time, you need to weigh your options before pinching too many pennies. Otherwise, you may join the \"What Went Wrong?\" crowd. Selecting a Web Site Designer A common dilemma in developing a Web site is whether to do it in-house or hire outside contractors. The learning curve for developing the skills needed to create an effective Web site is steep, and neither you nor your employees are likely to have the time or expertise to do a satisfactory job within a reasonable amount of time — at least not without some outside assistance. However, choosing a Web site design consultant or developer is one of the most important decisions you will make, so do it thoughtfully and cautiously. I provide a worksheet and checklist to help you through the often frustrating process. Web Site Design: The Essentials One of the biggest mistakes people make when designing Web sites is using too many graphic images or using graphic images and multimedia files that are so large they make the download seem interminable to visitors. The next biggest mistake is creating a Web site that makes it difficult for visitors to find the information they are looking for. Using Netscape Composer The hallmarks of an effective, user-friendly Web site are a relatively quick download and intuitive navigation throughout the site. 1 detail the tricks you can use to create an effective Web site and how you can implement them using Netscape Communicator's Page Composer (shown in Figure 1-2). These guide- lines will be useful even if the work is done by an independent contractor. Included are illustrations of effective page design, as well as links to Web sites that can be used as models.

The Book Is Coming in November Current Web Prejeett ; Document: Done Figure 1-2: Netscape Communicator's Composer simplifies the task of creating and updating your Web pages. I introduce to you to HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the lingua franca of the Web. HTML can be a bit unnerving at first, but it's really just another form of word processing or desktop publishing. However, under- standing its limitations and the compromises you may have to make will smooth out the bumps in the design process. I also show you places online where you can get clip art to quickly spruce up otherwise mundane pages. And I show you how to add interactivity to the site, which will improve its appeal. In addition, on the Companion CD-ROM you'll find Web page templates, as well as JavaScript and Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts you can use to add special features and interactivity to your Web site. Web Site Design: The Enhancements \"Cool\" gimmicks and \"killer\" gadgetry such as multimedia, video, animation, and gargantuan graphics are very appealing — unless you're the one who has to wait seemingly endless minutes to see them, only to discover they had little or no value and you feel your wait time was wasted time. These things are the Introduction XXXI elixirs of the Web. They hold great promise, but often are nothing more than a disappointing dose of sugar water. I advise my clients to resist the temptation to include such things unless they serve a truly useful purpose. For experienced Web developers, the rule of thumb is ''function over form.\" This section introduces you to the growing variety of options for including audio, video, multimedia, Java, ActiveX, virtual reality, and animated graphics in your Web site and examines the pros and cons of each in terms of design as well as Web site security. Online Transactions & E-Commerce If you want to conduct financial transactions of some sort, particularly accepting payment for items sold directly over the Web, you have three key concerns: ■ Processing the information. ■ Method of payment. ■ Security. I give you the options, explain how to achieve the best results, and refer to existing Web sites illustrating the key concepts. I also discuss online shopping carts and the use of a technology known as cookies, which has raised a huge red flag regarding privacy. Security and privacy issues are looming large and have become the subject of hearings conducted by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as proposed regulations at state and federal levels. I examine these issues and direct you to online information sources so you can remain apprised of these matters. They will have an impact on your online venture. Step 5: Launch the Web Site & Get it on Course Building a Web site, even if it's the best Web site ever created, is like opening a shop in an unlit back alley. If no one knows it's there, no one will come to it. It's imperative that you effectively promote and advertise your electronic storefront. Hello, World! A sjTidrome many online businesses suffer is the Field of Dreams delusion. That is, they believe that if they build it, people will come. But it ain't so, Joe. It doesn't work that way. You cannot base the success of your online enterprise on random acts of Web surfing. mil □ fficial Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit I will show you how to combine traditional public relations, marketing, and advertising techniques with methods unique to the online world to get the word out about your scintillating Web site. Even before your Web site is ready for prime time, you can begin laying the foundation for spreading the good word. That way, when D-day arrives, the troops have been marshaled and are ready for action. Step 6: Maintain, Update, Move Forward A Web site, unlike a print publication or video tape, is an evolving entity. To keep it current and to keep traffic coming through the digital doorway, it needs continual care, feeding, and attention. However, the manner in which this is achieved can raise questions regarding invasion of privacy and unethi- cal business practices. In this step, ITl discuss market research and the serious privacy issues involved and I'll introduce you to strategies you can use to personalize your Web site, keep it fresh, and increase interactivity. Marketing Online: A Personal Matter The Internet offers opportunities for marketing and market research that traditional media do not. Though the Internet is a far-flung entity, you can get up close and personal with your customers. However, this raises serious concerns about privacy. In this chapter, I discuss the issue of privacy as it relates to the gathering and use of personal information on the Net, including the legal and ethical surrounding such activities. I also address the issue of using indiscriminate direct mail campaigns, which in the online world is called spammmg. This is a controversial issue and has been at the core of major lawsuits as well as pro- posed legislation. Update, Upgrade & Promote Once your Web site is online, it needs to be nurtured and cultivated to make it blossom in the ever-changing climate of cyberspace. You need to accommo- date changes within your company, technological advances, and the fickle culture of cyberspace. In short, your Web site needs to be updated, upgraded, and promoted on a continuing basis. Introduction XXXill You can accomplish this in a number of ways, depending upon your online strategy, business model, and budget. This requires that you remain cognizant of demand for change, provide good customer service, review and update the content as needed, invite feedback, make the site interactive, incorporate new features that add value to the site, and establish an ongoing promotional program. In this section I'll discuss these concepts, describe steps you can take to implement site upgrades, and show you what others are doing with their Web sites instill customer loyalty andto keep people coming back. Step 7: Evaluate Your Internet Program A new program is only as good as its execution. Once you have things rolling, it's time to begin evaluating the progress you've made. Web Site Monitoring & Management A critical element in evaluating your progress is the traffic at your Web site. But there are many misconceptions about how traffic is measured and what these measurements mean. For example, many people trumpet the number of \"hits\" their Web site is getting. But did you know that one visitor can generate dozens, if not hundreds, of hits during a single visit? I put all of this into perspective, examining the options you have and the software you can use to meter the traffic at your Web site and analyze its true significance. Return on Investment It's imperative to the continuing success of your online venture that you know whether your investment is paying off. But determining the return on invest- ment of your Internet presence can be problematic. I offer a number of approaches you can take to effectively evaluate the performance of your online activities. Step 8: Look Forward As you march forward into cyberspace, you need to periodically peer into your crystal ball. Internet technology changes rapidly. However, early adop- tion is not always the wisest course. Your decisions should be based on knowl- edge and thoughtful planning, not conjecture. XXXIV Official Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit Successfully predicting where the Internet is headed, whether technologi- cally or culturally, is riskier than a roll of the dice in Las Vegas. Nevertheless, it behooves anyone staking a claim on the electronic frontier to keep a weather eye on what's coming around the next bend — and the one after that, and the one after that. The Potholes Ahead The final chapter of the book — but certainly not the final chapter of your online enterprise — examines the technological changes, social issues, and regulatory moves that are just beginning to emerge or that are being antici- pated and are likely to have an effect on your business. These include push or netcasting technology, Internet phone service, video conferencing, network computing, the PC /TV, high-speed connectivity, and smart cards, as well as changes in existing areas such as consumer products and services, security, privacy, and others.

Conclusion What the Net represents is a powerful new medium for delivering your mar- keting message and building one-on-one relationships with your customers. But success doesn't happen by default. It takes a carefully planned and imple- mented strategy if you don't want to become roadkill on the Information Superhighway. XXXVI □rnciAL Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit Consider this comment from Robert Hertzberg, editor-in-chief of Mecklermedia's Wefc Week Newspaper of Web Technology and Business Strategy: For every story of an Amazon.com — the startup that comes out of nowhere to make a business selling conventional products on the Web — there will be 30, 50, or even 100 stories about existing compa- nies that protected or extended their franchises by transferring a portion of what they do to the Web. The losers will be those who mistake their advantage — ^namely, the popularity of their current set of services, or the size or presumed loyalty of their customer base — for an unassailable lead. It's those companies alone that will find themselves with a diminishing role in a changed world. The Official Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit guides you through the proven eight-step process you need to develop and implement a successful Internet strategy. Prop In & Say Hello Once you're established online, drop me an e-line. I'd like to hear how you've done and get some feedback. You can send me e-mail at larry@larryedwards.com. I'll even put a link from my home page (www.larryedwards.com) to your Web site. Good luck to you in your online venture. Now roll up those sleeves and let's get going! Get Online — ^Today If you're not online and haven't truly explored the Internet firsthand, you don't have any business thinking about building the coolest Web site in cyberspace. This is the most common mistake people make, thinking that if they simply pay someone a few bucks to throw up a Web site, it will some- how magically transform itself into a thriving profit center. You need to explore this new frontier before making financial and human-resource com- mitments. Otherwise, you're likely to make costly mistakes. The Net in a Nutshell I he Internet is not new — its 25th anniversary was celebrated in 1994 — but only in the last three to four years has the Internet really entered the collective consciousness of the public at large. Consequently, it seems new to many people; it's still cloaked in an air of mystery. And this has resulted in a lot of misconceptions about the Internet, what it is . . . and what it is not. The following pages give you an overview of this ethereal universe, de- scribing the Internet's primary components and opening a window on the ways a business can benefit from this cost-effective marketing-communica- tions medium. You'll get a taste of the alphabet soup the veterans throw around on a routine basis, but not so much Netspeak that it leaves your head spinning. Definitions of some frequently used cyberwords can be found near the end of the chapter. The Internet: What It Is Bill Gates notwithstanding, the Internet is not a religious experience. It is, however, a cost-effective communications medium, as well as an alternate means for the distribution and sale of goods and services. 2 □fficial Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit Bill's Conversion Mr. Bill Gates, the resourceful chairman of Microsoft Corporation, had an epiphany on the Bellevue-Redmond Road late in 1995. He saw the light, and it was the Internet with a capital /. The focus of his company changed almost over- night — and he had to rewrite his book. The Road Ahead, to reflect his inspira- tional rebirth. The Irony was that it had taken him as long as it did to figure It out. The Internet is revolutionizing the way people interact with one another and is having as great an impact on the dissemination of information as Johann Gutenberg's printing press did more than 500 years ago. That's what makes the Internet so valuable to business people such as you. Through the Internet you can reach business associates, suppliers, and customers — and they can reach you — for a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. Used properly and methodically, the Internet has the potential to improve your bottom line. But it is not a matter of faith; it is not a \"field of dreams.\" It requires realistic goals and budgets, careful planning and implementation, and — perhaps most of all — patience. Boon to Business Businesses can benefit from the Net's strengths in a number of ways, chief among them the broad geographical reach it offers and the high degree of interactivity it permits. This allows small businesses to compete strategically with their larger rivals. Business uses of the Net range from marketing to customer service to product distribution to retail sales. The types of busi- nesses, products, and services now on the Net range from booksellers to banks, from software to shoes, from flowers to financial services, from pot- pourri to pom. The Four Here's a quick roundup of what the Net's all about: ■ Who: Millions of people worldwide, ranging from grade-school students to rocket scientists to the president of the United States to unscrupulous con artists. It's a cross-section of humanity, currently dominated by white males, although the percentage of women and minorities using the Chapter 1: The Net m a Nutshell 3 Internet is rising steadily. Keep in mind, too, that while these figures are accurate, the majority of those millions are in the United States. To put it into perspective, some 25 percent of the world's population doesn't even own telephones. E What: The Internet, or Net, as it is known. It's a global network of com- puter networks, all interconnected or internetworked — Whence, its name. No single person or entity owns the Net, and it has only a loose gover- nance that is focused primarily on coordinating its technological under- pinnings and ensuring system compatibility, as opposed to overseeing social or legal arenas. This may change, however, in response to the unscrupulous operators, swindlers, and crooks trying to make a fast buck at the expense of fellow cybercitizens. 0 Where: Global. The Net is becoming ubiquitous, but it's going to be several more years before connections are as commonplace as telephones and television sets. While the Net has reached critical mass in terms of commercial enterprises, it is not yet a mass medium. il Why: Because it provides a big, interactive reach at a (relatively) small cost. Greater Than the Sum The Net is much greater than the sum of its component parts: the millions of computers, wires, cables, silicon microchips, and electrons of which it is made. It got its start, perhaps portentously, in 1969 — the year of Woodstock and of the landing of men on ^e moon. It was, too, the height of the Cold War, which was the impetus behind the birth of the Internet. The U.S. military got together with a group of scientists to create a communications network that could continue to operate over common telephone lines following a nuclear attack on Washington and the Pentagon. The Internet originally consisted of just two computers in California, one at the University of Califomia-Los Angeles (UCLA), *e other at Stanford Uni- versity in Palo Alto. A third was added shortly thereafter, and the number's been growing ever since. Restricted to military and academic uses for the first two decades, the Internet was opened to commercial organizations in 1991, resulting in an upsurge in the rate of growth. When it became possible to view graphic images on the World Wide Web, the growth of the Internet skyrock- eted (see Figure 1-1). 4 □ fficial Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit Figure 1-1: The growth of the Internet skyrocketed when it became possible to view graphic images on the World Wide Web. The Internet gradually spread throughout the United States, Canada, and then beyond, and is now in most countries of the world, if in a rather limited capacity in some. Millions of computers are connected to the Internet. In the United States, control of the Internet backbone — a maze of high- speed fiber-optic cables criss-crossing the country — was relinquished by the National Science Foundation in April 1995 and is being turned over to private business. The process will be completed in March 1998. Today, close to a dozen companies control the Internet backbone, including MCI Communications Corporation, Sprint Corporation, and IBM (but not, ironically, AT&T), and there are thousands of Internet service providers offering Internet access to anyone willing to pay for it. Chapter 1 : The Net in a Nutshell 5 Designed originally for point-to-point data transmission, e-mail capability was added early in the 1970s and immediately became the most popular use of the Net. That was followed by the creation of the Usenet, which is based on the same messaging technology as e-mail, which has become an unregulated mass of some 25,000 to 30,000 discussion groups, where information and opinions on every subject imaginable are exchanged every hour of every day. The World Wide Web is the new kid on the block in terms of the Net's under- pinnings, but it's the one commanding all the attention and Internet band- width, and is responsible for fueling the exponential growth of the Net. Virtual Communities From its humble beginnings in academia, the Net has evolved into a global congregation comprised of thousands of virtual communities formed through common interests rather than geographical proximity. To comprehend this phenomenon, you need only to visit highly interactive Web sites, such as Women's Wire, Parent Soup, Tripod, Geocities, ZDNet, or The Well, one of the oldest online communities, or take a peek at the eclectic array of discussion groups that make up the Usenet. Developing a sense of community around your Internet business and its Web site can help you more successfully market your products and services. For example, Amazon.com, an online bookstore, not only has a colossal data- base of books for sale but also offers book reviews and solicits and publishes readers' comments on the books they've read. ZDNet, sponsored by maga- zine publisher Ziff-Davis, provides hardware and software reviews, new product information, and public forums where Web site visitors can give their own opinions on computer-related products and seek assistance in the use of these products. The Internet's Underpinnings Because the Net is amorphous, it is defined by the functions it provides. Think of these functions or components as the spokes of the Internet wheel (see Figure 1-2). 6 □ fficial Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit Figure 1-2: The Internei is comprised of several components, which function like the spokes of a wheel. t Messaging Electronic mail, or e-mail for short, is the most important component of the Net in terms of user priorities. Millions of messages are exchanged each week. You identify an e-mail address by the \"at\" symbol (@) — e.g., youmame@bizname.com — which in Net protocols is used only in e-mail addresses. If you were to recite an e-mail address out loud, you would say \"your name at biz name dot com\" — the period between the elements of an Internet address is pronounced dot. E-mail will become an invaluable tool in your online business activities. World Wide Web, or Simply, the Web This is what everyone's talking about. The Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Switzerland, in 1989, but was not formally instituted until 1994. It is the wunderkind of the Net and has led to the phenomenal growth in the use of the Internet. It's now responsible for the majority of data transmissions on the Net. The Web, with its pictures, video, and multimedia presentations, allows even the most computer-phobic people to overcome their fears and get comfortable online as they use hypertext to point and click their way around cyberspace. You identify a Web address by syntax such as this: http://www.bizname.com, http://www.agency.gov, or http:// www.nonprofit.org. The giveaway in a Web address — technically known as a Chapter 1: The Net in a Nutshell 7 URL (Uniform Resource Locator) — is the http:/l, which is used only in Web addresses. Your Web site, or home page, will be your electronic storefront, where you will greet, meet, and interact with your customers. Usenet The Usenet is an assemblage of discussion groups or forums (known in Net lingo as newsgroups) whose subject matter ranges from astrophysics to Zen meditation and every conceivable topic in between. While it's almost impossible to accurately coiont the number of discussion groups, a recent estimate pegged it at close to 40,000, although many of these have little or no regular activity. The Usenet, or user network, began as a way for groups of people with similar interests to keep each other up to date on new developments within their respective fields of interest, hence the name newsgroups. But the groups are not organized by commercial news agencies. They are informal and often teeming with rumors and half-truths. Messages sent, or posted, to a discussion group are added to a database passed en masse between computers, where they are organized by topic and can be retrieved by subscribers. A discussion group functions much like a bulletin board. The advantage of making it electronic is that messages of like topics are threaded together, making it easy to follow the line of discussion and contribute your own replies. You identify a discussion group address by syntax such as this: misc.business.marketing.moderated. Again, note the dot separating the elements that make up the name. Discussion groups can be an invaluable source of information and a way for you to interact with consum- ers. You can even start your own discussion group. Mailing Lists Mailing lists are similar to discussion groups, but instead of messages being sent to a central location, they exchange information using e-mail. They grow out of special interest groups in which information is exchanged through e-mail messages that are automatically forwarded to every subscriber on a specific list. Mailing lists are also known as listservs, in part because one of the more popular software programs used to administer them is named ListServ. You may want to join a mailing list to keep abreast of certain areas of interest, or you may want to establish a mailing list as a form of customer service and interaction. Some mailing lists are very active, generating dozens of messages a day, so use some discretion in terms of how many you subscribe to at any given time. □fficial Netscape Internet business Starter kit FTP FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a common and oft-used method of transferring files from one computer to another. If you become actively involved in creat- ing and maintaining your Web site, you'll use FTP routinely. Telnet Telnet is a process that lets you control a computer from a geographically remote location. Specially tailored Telnet software (a Telnet client) is used by professionals to, among other things, set up and operate Internet servers. What it does is open up a dumb terminal session in which the operator then uses the software on the remote computer. This differs from most Internet sessions in which the operator uses software on his or her own computer to send requests and replies to a remote computer. If you've got a hankering to get under the hood and into the nuts and bolts of Internet computing, you'll need to be able to Telnet into a computer, even if it's just in the next room. You will also need to learn a smattering of UNIX com- mands; UNIX is the most common operating system used for Internet servers. IRC IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, is used for real-time (live) discussion groups on the Internet. These tend to be a bit raunchy, although valuable information is exchanged. One group made up of residents in the United States and England use IRC to stage Shakespearean plays on an intercontinental virtual stage. Intranets & Extranets The Net has spawned some offspring recently, known generically as intranets and extranets. An intranet is a private network built on the open standards of • Internet protocols. Many companies are establishing intranets to improve internal communications, support departmental Web sites, access legacy data, and encourage collaborative, or team, computing. An extranet is an intranet opened to others outside the organization, such as when a company opens its intranet to its customers. For example, a wholesale distributor may link with its customers to facilitate the electronic exchange of purchase orders, status reports, invoices, the products themselves, and even payment for goods and services. Chapter 1: The Net in a Nutshell 9 Collaborative Computing Collaborative computing — in which people, often separated by distance . . . even by time zones . . . work together on a project — has grown hand-in-hand with intranets and extranets. This growth has been fueled by continuing improve- ments in groupware, the software that enables collaborative computing by allowing project team members to share information, documents, calendars, and the like. More and more, groupware is being based on Internet protocols, which reduces the cost of deployment and allows for remote access to private intranets via the Internet. The software Netscape Communicator, which will be introduced in Chapter 4, \"Exploring Cyberspace,\" was designed for use in collaborative computing. When it's used in conjunction with the Netscape SuiteSpot family of servers, it becomes a valuable communications tool within a business, allowing people in different geographical regions and different time zones — such as those on business trips — to stay in touch and to work on the same projects. Other Elements You may have heard or read about other facets of the Net, such as Gopher, Archie, and Veronica. These technologies have been largely displaced by the Web and are used infrequently today. Gateways to the Net To gain access to the Net, you need an Internet service provider (ISP), whether you're an individual or a major corporation. These days, you can choose from two types of ISP: pure ISPs such as Earthlink and Mindspring, or commercial online services such as CompuServe or America Online (AOL). Pure ISPs The thousands of ISPs around the world provide the gateways — the on-ramps, if you will — to the vast network of interconnected cables and computers that together make up the Net's infrastructure. This has come to symbolize what is euphemistically known as the Information Superhighway. These ISPs gener- ally offer speedy access to the Web, e-mail, and Usenet newsgroups. Many also offer other services (in return for higher fees), such as Web site hosting, multiple e-mail accounts, vanity addresses, and so on. Pricing, features, and quality vary widely from ISP to ISP. In Chapter 2, \"Get (Well) Connected,\" I'll explain how to locate and evaluate an ISP and procure its services. 10 □ fficial Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit Commercial Online Services You've no doubt heard of America Online, CompuServe, Microsoft Network, Prodigy, and other online services. Maybe you even subscribe to one. These are proprietary subscriber networks that function independently of the Internet. However, since 1995 these networks have been plugged into the Net, offering varying degrees of Net access and information exchange to their subscribers. I used to recommend that Net neophytes get their feet wet with one of these services because setting up a computer to access the Net was such a pain in the neck. But most ISPs have made the connection process relatively painless, and I now recommend you bypass the commercial online services unless you find one that offers some compelling content or special interest groups you can't find anywhere else. You may want to subscribe to one of them, as I do, so you have a secondary gateway to the Net for times when your ISP has an outage, when you're on the road, or for marketing your products and services directly to subscribers of online services. Gridlock on the Information Superhighway A note of caution: The Internet is suffering from growing pains as it attempts to absorb the ever-increasing amount of traffic flowing through its fiber-optic arteries. As a result, there can be major traffic jams and gridlock at Internet hubs — places where one backbone carrier hands off traffic to another — slowing Internet traffic to a crawl. If the traffic is sufficiently heavy and con- gested, it can (and does) bring parts of the system to a halt. At such times the Information Superhighway seems more like a deeply rutted wagon road with more than its fair share of potholes, and you begin to think you were secretly beamed into Snoresville, USA. Unlike the commercial online services, which suffer the greatest congestion during the evening hours and on weekends, the Net is busiest during the business day, particularly the period between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in U.S. time zones. This slows all types of data transmissions — whether they are e-mail messages, Web page downloads, Telnet connections, or file transfers — and has given rise to yet another definition of WWW: World Wide Wait. What's more, the heavy traffic within this time frame further emphasizes the fact that the majority of the Internet population resides in the United States. This, too, shall pass, as capacity is boosted and the underlying infrastruc- ture is upgraded with more powerful equipment, some of which has yet to be developed commercially. In the meantime, if a message pops ups in your Web browser window saying that a Web server did not respond and may be offline, it may simply mean that your browser timed out because the signal was stuck in traffic at an Internet hub. Chapter 1: The Net in a Nutshell 1 1 Client-Server & Other Technobabble As you read more about the Internet, you will hear and see the term client- server used a lot, because the Internet is composed of two categories of com- puters and software: client and server. A client can be a computer as well as the software installed on that computer. Same with a server. Simply put, an Internet client is typically Internet software, such as Netscape Communicator, installed on a desktop computer. A server, on the other hand, is typically a more powerful computer with Web server software, such as the Netscape Enterprise Server, installed on it. When a Web surfer wants to view a Web page, his or her client (the Web browser) sends a request for information to a server, which stores the Web pages and then \"serves\" that information back to the client. There are a host of other often incomprehensible acronyms and jargon you will encounter as you explore cyberspace — and as you work your way through this book. The following definitions are to get you started, so the references in the book don't leave you feeling lost and alienated. You'll find the full list in the Glossary. ■ Domain name — A comprehensible term, such as larry-edwards, that serves as an alias for a numeric Internet address (e.g., 199.2.50.14) that computers use to identify one another. ■ FTP — File Transfer Protocol, a technical standard that allows dissimilar computer operating systems to send and receive files to and from one another. ■ Home page — The entry, or top-level, page of a Web site. Sometimes used synonymously with Web site. ■ HTML — HyperText Markup Language, the lingua franca of the Web. This text markup, similar to word processing, is what formats Web pages and creates hypertext, the hot links that characterize the Web. See also Hypertext. ■ Hypertext — The \"hot\" text that makes up the hyperlinks you use to point and click your way around the Web. Hypertext is usually blue and underlined. When you move your mouse pointer over hypertext, the pointer typically changes to the shape of a hand with an up-raised finger. (No, it's the index finger!) If you click on the link, you automatically go to that page. Later if you return to the page that contained the link, you'll see the hypertext has changed color, by default set to violet. This tells you where you've been. ■ KB — Kilobyte (1,000 bytes), a measure of data file size. One byte is equivalent to one text character and consists of eight bits. Official Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit ■ Kbps — Kilobits per second signifies data transmission speeds, or capac- ity, of modems, data transmission lines, and other data transmission devices. ■ MB — Megabyte (1 million bytes or 1,000 kilobytes). ■ Modem — Short for modulate/demodulate. An electronic device that is connected to your computer and allows you to dial into an Internet service provider (ISP) using a plain old telephone service (POTS). ■ URL — Uniform Resource Locator. An intimidating term for what is simply an Internet address. Most often this will refer to the location of a Web site. A Web URL begins with http://. You also may hear some people pronounce the term \"earl,\" but it's not recommended. ■ Web site — A collection of HTML files, or pages — as well as programs that generate pages and multimedia displays — published to a Web server so that others may view them from remote locations. Moving On You've now been introduced to the Net, its major components, and how it provides a platform for expanding your business to the virtual world or for starting a new business online. In a nutshell, the Net is a cost-effective tool that you can use — likely will have to use — to grow your business. But your head probably is still swimming with all the new terms and infor- mation I've dumped on you. Do not despair. In the next two chapters you're going to put this new knowledge to work as you get online, if you're not already, and take a tour of the electronic frontier, where you can experience these things firsthand. Get(WeH) Connected I f you're not online, if you're not connected to the Net (or not \"wired\"), or if you're considering an upgrade to your current Internet access, you're in the right place. The ensuing pages will fill you in on the various options for get- ting onto the Net, what they will cost you, and how to go about selecting an Internet service provider (ISP). Armed with this information, you can evaluate your needs and budget your expenses accordingly. (I'm assuming you have a personal computer of at least the 486 class that runs Windows 3.1, or at least a Macintosh 68030 with System 7.5, as detailed in the Introduction.) If you are already online and are satisfied with your current Internet service, skip ahead to Chapter 3, \"Select a Web Site Host.\" Getting Wired (to the Net) Whether you are self-employed or your business is a large corporation, you will need to use an Internet service provider to connect to the Net. Internet connections range from low-speed (some would say \"slow\" speed) access using the copper wire of plain old telephone ser\\dce (POTS), to high-speed access through fiber-optic cables which use pulses of light to transmit data at lightning speed. The low-speed access is inexpensive but may be insufficient to handle your needs. High-speed access is going first class but may be over- kill, and you may not be able to justify the costs. The minimum service should include at least one e-mail account, access to the Web, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Usenet (discussion groups). Official Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit You will be assigned (or you can choose) a username and a password, which you will need to log on through your ISP or your company network. Your username is often the same name used in your e-mail address, but not always. For business purposes, I recommend that your e-mail address have a name that quickly identifies you. In small companies, it may be a simple as john@smallbiz.com. In a larger organization, the full name often is used: Jack.Smith@bigbiz.com. The first and last names can be separated by a dot, dash, or underscore. Capitalized names are also acceptable. I explain how to obtain your own domain name in Chapter 3, \"Select a Web Site Host.\" If you're in a big hurry, you can set up a generic account right away, and then have your mail forwarded to the new address after you obtain a domain name of your own. Access the Net These days, gaining access to the Net is a fairly simple procedure. But before you just jump at the first offer that comes along, let's examine your options, the costs involved, and the pros and cons of each. Dial-up Account A dial-up account uses a standard telephone line to connect you to the Net via an analog modem — a device that allows your computer to dial into an ISP, which then connects you to the Net. A personal dial-up account typically costs about $20 a month. A business account will cost you a little more, depending on how often it's used. A modem runs anywhere from $100 to $300 depending on its speed and whether it's internal (installed inside your computer) or external (connected to your computer by a short cable). If you fall into the SOHO (small office/home office) category, you can probably get by with a dial-up account, but those who use the Internet fre- quently or have multiple users should expect to pay more than the basic fee for the service. Most ISPs have local phone numbers, so there is no per-minute charge from the telephone company for residential service at this time. (The telephone companies are not happy with this and are taking steps to recoup what they believe are lost revenues, so this may change.) A modem is rated by the amount of data (bits) it is capable of transmitting in one second. The most commonly used modem today has a capacity of 28,800 bits per second, or 28.8 kilobits per second (kbps), although a signifi- cant percentage of people still use 14.4 kbps modems. (Modem speed has a direct impact on Web page design and is discussed in detail in Chapter 10, \"Web Site Design: The Essentials.\") Some common terms used to describe modem speed and capacity are defined in Table 2-1. Chapter 2: Get (Well) Connected 1 5 Term Definition Bit The smallest unit of binary data; blinary + dig)it. Byte A set of eight bits; one byte is the equivalent of one text character. Kbps Kilobits per second (1,000 bps); common unit of data transmission speed. Mbps Megabits per second (1,000,000 bps). Packet A bundle of data, generally about 1,500 bytes. Table 2-1: Data classification and rates of transfer. Modems rated at 33.6 kbps are also on the market, but not all ISPs support them. In addition, 56 kbps modems have been introduced, but the manufac- turers are using nonstandard and sometimes conflicting protocols at this writing, and compatibility problems may arise. Check with your ISP before buying one. Tip Buy as fast a modem as you can get, but make sure your ISP can support it before spending the extra bucks for speed you may not be able to use. Buy at least a 28.8 kbps modem, even if someone offers you a 14.4 for free. Otherwise, the slow speed will drive you up the wall. Trap A standard modem will not work with digital PBX- or Centrex-type business phone systems. If your business has such a system, you will need a dedicated analog phone line to use the modem, just like you had to provide for your fax machine. Shell, SLIP 8e PPP Accounts When inquiring about a dial-up account, you may be asked if you want a shell, SLIP, or PPP account. Even my eyes glaze over with this discussion, so ril make the explanation as brief as possible. The short answer is that you want PPP, which may include a shell account. PPP is short for Point-to-Point Protocol, and it's the more advanced technol- ogy of the three. It provides a direct connection between your computer and the Internet, allowing your computer to use Internet protocols and join the network. At one point, PPP was available only to Macintosh users, but we □fficial Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit Windows types can use it now too, and it has pretty much replaced SLIP. If an ISP doesn't offer PPP, which is unlikely, you may want to take your business elsewhere (unless it's the only game in town), because it's an indication the ISP is behind the times, technologically speaking. SLIP is short for Serial Line Internet Protocol and it preceded PPP. Like PPP, SLIP gives you a direct connection to the Net, permitting your computer to join the network. A shell account dates back to earlier times when Net users logged on to the Net through an intermediate, or host, computer. This is a text-based, menu- or command-driven system in which your computer, for all practical purposes, becomes a dumb terminal on the host computer's network. You dial in using any of a number of communications programs available, and then log on to the computer using your username and password. You work your way through a series of menus — or enter commands at the prompt — to perform various tasks, such as e-mail, FTP, Telnet, or Web surfing with (horror of hor- rors!) a nongraphical, text-only browser. Many ISPs no longer offer shell ac- counts because there's so little demand for them. But if you're willing to learn a smattering of UNIX commands, it can occasionally be useful, such as when your primary computer crashes and you have to dust off that old pre- Windows DOS machine to get to your e-mail. Integrated Services Digital Network Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is not new technology, but it is being touted more heavily by service providers, particularly the telephone companies. ISDN comes in two gears — 56/64 kbps (one channel) and 112/128 kbps (two channels) — ^the latter about 10 times as fast as a 14.4 kbps analog modem, even though it uses the same kind of telephone line. Two-channel ISDN is fast enough that you can do low-end video conferencing. ISDN differs from a standard dial-up connection in two ways: (1) it is com- pletely digital, and (2) rather than using an inexpensive analog modem, the connection is handled by one of two devices, depending on whether you're connecting a single computer or a computer network to the Net. A single computer requires a network terminal adapter, whereas a network of two or more computers requires a separate routing device or one of the computers to act as a router, which is more expensive to set up. ISDN can be set up so that you have virtually instant access, without hav- ing to dial in every time you want to log on to the Net. However, the instant access and higher speed come with a higher price. Chapter 2; Get (Well) Connected 1 7 An ISDN setup will cost you from $500 to $2,000 (hardware plus installa- tion fees). The basic monthly service fee will run you $30 to $50. And you will be charged by the minute for the time you're online, even if it's a local phone call. These charges are roughly three to six cents for the first minute and one to two cents per minute thereafter, depending on whether you're using one channel or two and on the rates charged by your local telephone company. While the charges may seem insignificant at first glance, they can add up to several hundred dollars a month if you have several people in your office using the system. An advantage of ISDN is that you can use a single line for multiple functions simultaneously — phone, fax, and Internet access. So, if you have multiple users, it could cost less than having several individual dial-up accounts and multiple dedicated phone lines, plus you get the higher speed. But to be safe, I recom- mend checking out all your options before choosing ISDN. An option worth investigating is Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology, which I discuss in a later section. Table 2-2 outlines some Internet access options and estimated costs. Trap If your office local area network (LAN) is connected to the Net via a router, the router may run up connection and line charges even when no people are using the connection. This is because routers routinely poll the network, that is, they take roll, in a manner of speaking, to see who's present. This may include connecting to the Net and triggering a line charge. The phone company zvill love you for this, but your first bill may be a shocker. Type of Access Data Transmission Rate Equipment Cost' Setup Cost^ Monthly Fee^ Dial-up Up to 56 kbps $100-$300 $25 $20-3100 ISDN 56-128 kbps $350-$1,500 $200-$300 $50 and up Cable 1.5-10 mbps Included $100-5150 $50 xDSL 128-768 kbps S400-S2,500 $600-S1,000 $75-3200 Dedicated or Network 56 kbps-4 mbps S400-S2.500 $600-31,000 $250-33,000 ' Estimate only.

' Estimate only. Costs will vary depending on the service provider and system requirements. ’ Estimate only. Costs may increase in proportion to the number of users and the amount of connection time. An ISDN account, for example, will incur additional per-minute line charges, even for a local call. Table: 2-2: Internet access options and estimated costs. 18 □mciAL Netscape internet Business Starter Kit Digital Subscriber Line Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology is the next step up from ISDN. Like ISDN, it's a digital signal transmitted over a copper telephone line, but can support data transmission speeds up to 6 mbps over the largest copper tele- phone cables. DSL comes in several flavors, including Integrated (IDSL), High- bit-rate (HDSL), Asymmetric (ADSL), and Symmetric (SDSL), and is referred to generically as xDSL. The xDSL services are aimed at businesses and designed to offer access to the Internet by connecting directly to an Internet service provider's point of pres- ence, a telephone company's own Internet access service from a corporate LAN, or a company's frame relay or asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network. An xDSL Internet connection will get you data transmission speeds up to 768 kbps, which is six times faster than ISDN and 26 times faster than a 28.8 kbps analog modem. A trade-off from ISDN is that it delivers data-only access services, no voice. However, on the plus side, you're likely to be billed at a flat rate, and it transmits data over a data-only network bypassing the voice net- work, which boosts performance. At this writing, xDSL service is not widely available. It's limited to just a few metropolitan regions and is somewhat experimental. But you should keep an eye on it. Once the bugs are worked out and equipment costs come dovm, it could be a good alternative to cable access, discussed below. Service costs are expected to range from aroimd $75 a month for a 128 kbps IDSL up to $200 a month for a 768 kbps HDSL circuit. ADSL and SDSL are coming, but details are sketchy at this time. Equipment costs are higher, too. An xDSL modem can cost as much as $2,500, but they are expected to come down in price through economies of scale as the services come into greater use. Cable Access With a cable modem, you can obtain a high-speed network (Ethernet) connec- tion between your computer and your ISP via a hybrid network of coaxial and fiber-optic cables. This mode of access does not use a telephone line. Rather, it uses the same cable as television signals. Compared to dial-up or ISDN, a cable modem is fast and can handle up to a hundred times the data of an analog modem over a given period of time. An Ethernet is rated at 10 megabits per second (mbps) — almost 700 times faster than a 14.4 modem — ^but don't let that figure or the marketing hype deceive you. It's a reflection of the network's potential, not its actual performance, particularly if hundreds of users are online at once. (Besides, it's unlikely your computer can process information at more than half that speed.) Chapter 2: Get (Well) Connected 19 Moreover, your ISP may have only a T-1 connection to the Net. A T-1 is a fiber-optic cable about the diameter of a finger that has a top speed of 1.5 mbps. As the weakest link in the cable connection chain, the T-1 will limit transmission speeds to its rate, which can create a bottleneck. In addition, these transmission speeds relate to downloads (from the Net to your computer), not uploads (from your computer to the Net). Uploads max out at 768 kbps, although that's still six times the fastest ISDN speed. Generally, this service is offered by cable television companies, as they already have a coaxial network connected to homes and businesses. But the service is in its infancy and not available in all areas. The cost typically ranges from $40 to $50 a month, and the installation charge ranges from $100 to $150 (including the cost and installation of the Ethernet card), but you don't own the modem; you're just renting it. The high-speed access is nice, especially if you find yourself spending a lot of time online, as I do, or if you want to view Web-based videos and multime- dia presentations. These often have gargantuan file sizes and can take substan- tial amounts of time to download with an analog modem. However, the bugs in these systems are still being worked out, and I don't think a business should rely on this type connection alone at this point. I use cable access but have two dial-up accounts as backup. In addition, your Web access is likely to be routed through a proxy server, as it is with commercial online services and many corporate connections. This means that when you click on a hyperlink to a Web page, your request goes to the proxy server, not the server hosting the Web page. If the proxy server has cached, or stored, that particular page (what are the odds on that?), then you get it right away. But if it's not cached (the likely scenario), you have to wait until the proxy server downloads the page, then passes it along to you. If it's a relatively small page, an analog modem linked direct to a host server often can outpace the cable modem. This is not a reason to reject cable access. I explain this only to remind you that patience is required on the Web, even with high- speed systems. One more thing: A cable television company offering Internet access may not offer Web hosting services. So if you use a cable company for access, you may also need a second ISP to host your Web site, which I discuss in Chapter 3, \"Select a Web Site Host.\" 20 □ fficial Netscape Internet business Starter Kit Network Connection A network connection is the fastest, and most expensive, connection readily available today, and it comes in several models, depending on how much bandwidth — or data transmission capacity — you need. Capacities range from a 56 kbps frame relay account to a leased T-3 line. Unless you're the only user, an internal network is required, and it will take a substantial investment in equipment and cabling. For example, a fractional T-1 line (the smallest fiber-optic cable) will cost you in the neighborhood of $500 or more a month, and the setup fee is likely to exceed $1,000. A full T-1 ranges from $1,200 to $2,000 a month, depending on the provider, and the installation fee will set you back as much as $3,000, including the router. A tiered T-3 line (equivalent to 28 T-1 lines, or 45 mbps) operating at 4 mbps can be as much as $7,500 a month, with a one-time instal- lation fee in the neighborhood of $7,500. You can get data transmission rates up to 45 mbps, but it'll cost you a proportional amount more. I'm not going into aU the gory details here because it's the subject of an entire book by itself. If your company already has an internal network, start by brain- storming ideas with your network administrator or the contractor who did your installation work. If your company doesn't have an intemal network, contact a local ISP and/or telephone company to establish your needs and budget. When Fast is Slow As I pointed out earlier, having a high-speed connection doesn't guarantee it will always function at the rated speed. In fact, sometimes you will find that a network connection crawls along as slow as a 1 4.4 modem. It's a matter of rated capacity versus actual throughput. Think of a network, and the Internet itself, as a system of roads and freeways. When a small number of vehicles are using the system, the traffic flow Is smooth and efficient. But as the number and the size of vehicles increase, traffic slows down and can become congested, particularly at intersections. If there is an accident or a problem with a traffic signal, the traffic can come to a halt. You could be driving a Ferrari, and it wouldn't make any difference; you'd still be stuck next to that aging VW Bug. The same thing happens on a computer network and— -because the Internet is one humongous network Itself — on the Net. As the number of users increases and as the sizes of the data files (graphics, audio and video clips, multimedia) Increase, traffic slows because data transmission lines can hold only so much data at a given time. When large amounts of data, or packets, are being trans- mitted simultaneously, traffic begins to slow. What's more, the routers and hubs— Chapter 2: Get (Well) Connected 21 the network/Internet equivalent of intersections — ^tend to be the weakest links in the computer chain and cause data traffic to back up and come to a screeching halt. The fastest Internet connection in the world isn't going to help you when this happens. The Net's infrastructure is being upgraded and technological improvements are being brought into play, so some of these problems will disappear. However, we're also likely to see a leapfrog effect: As improvements are rolled out, we'll see more users, larger graphics, and more video and multimedia presentations, which will slow things down again as the process repeats itself. Again, the watchword Is patience. Remember, the Internet went commercial only In 1991. It's functioning at levels not unlike our telephone system at the turn of the last century. Choosing an ISP As with anything else, when choosing an Internet service provider the lowest cost doesn't necessarily mean you get the best deal. The accompanying check- list contains the questions you need to ask to evaluate how much bang you're getting for your buck. The checklist depicted below is the condensed version, but it gives you an idea of the broad range of information you need to make an informed decision. The checklist (ISPCHECK) is included in the /Resource /Checklists directory of this book's Companion CD-ROM. You can choose from Windows or Macintosh formats. See Appendix A for instructions on using the CD-ROM.

This is the red flag issue. I know a woman whose first ISP offered a maximum of 56 kbps access to the Net. Granted, this was 1994, but it was unacceptable even then. However, she didn't know the difference at the time. If you're using the Net for business, you want an ISP with a minimum of redundant T-1 lines with multihoming capabil- ity. This means two T-1 lines are routed through separate backbones. If one backbone provider has an outage, you and your ISP will still have connectivity. If the ISP has a T-3 or greater capacity, that's even better. If you need a T-1 or a T-3, you'll have limited options in terms of who can provide this much bandwidth. Also, find out if the ISP has a direct con- nection to the Net or is going through yet a larger ISP. You want one with a direct connection to the Internet backbone. H Length of time in the Internet business. This, too, is a red-flag issue. You want an ISP with at least two years under its belt. When the major telephone companies began offering Internet connections in 1996, they were flooded with complaints because they were not as experienced as, nor could they match the technical support given by, smaller operations that had been in the business for several years. B Services. The more the better. Even if you need only a dial-up account to get started, you'll want the option of upgrading later without having to switch ISPs. Chapter 2: Get (Well) Connected 23 ■ Fees. You will have to weigh them against the services offered. Small ISPs aren't always staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so they can get away with charging less. But what happens if you're trying to meet a deadline at 11 p.m. or working from home on a weekend cind suddenly have no connection to the Net and no one to call? On the other hand, it's my experience that the smaller ISPs provide more personal service and are more responsive to your technical questions than the large operations, and you can often page someone for assistance. Speaking from personal expe- rience, even if you call one of the larger ISPs at 11 p.m., you may be on hold for a half-hour before actually getting a live body at the other end of the line, and even then the technician may be of little or no help. ■ Hardware. Typically, hardware is not supplied by ISPs, with the excep- tion of cable access — where the provider generally furnishes a network card and cable modem, and some network accounts — where a router is included, as described earlier. ■ Software. Most ISPs make the basic software available, but you should ask how current it is. Technology on the Net changes in a matter of months, not years. ■ Customer-to-modem ratio. Ten to one or less is desirable, but you prob- ably can live with 15 to one. (That leaves America Online (AOL) out.) Keep in mind, though, that the ISPs may not give you accurate figures. ■ 800/tolI-free number or broad local access. If you or your employees travel a lot, this could be a deciding factor. ■ Host Web sites. Most ISPs host Web sites, but not all do. You're better off having a single ISP providing both access and Web hosting services. This will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter. Finding an ISP If you're not online, your best option is to ask a friend or business associate for a reference. Get three or four references, if you can. If you don't know anyone who's already online, you'll have to scour local newspapers and magazines for advertisements for Internet access service, or obtain a copy of a printed direc- tory, such as the one published bimonthly by Boardzuatch magazine. Such directories should be available in bookstores and computer retail stores. Also, check with a local phone company. Most of them are now offering Internet access. But remember, most of them are relatively new to this business and may not yet provide the level of service or the personalized service you may get from an established ISP. □fficial Netscape Internet Business Starter Kit If you're online but want to investigate yoiur options, a good source of infor- mation is Boardwatch magazine's Web site (http://www.boardwatch.com/), which has a directory of Internet service providers in the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) and Canada. Another online information source is The List, which can be found at: http://thelist.iworld.com. United Consumer Action Network (http:/lwww.ucan.orgD, a watchdog agency that keeps an eye on public utilities and telecommunication companies, sponsors y an ISP rating service. It was new at this writing, with only a small number of f'_ responses, so one disgruntled subscriber can easily skew a rating. Before you select f an ISP, see Chapter 3, \"Select a Web Site Host,\" for information on selecting a Web I site host. It may make more sense for you to choose both at once. Making the Connection If you obtain a dial-up or cable modem account, your ISP will provide the software you need to connect to the Internet and often will install it (for a fee) if you don't want to fool with it yourself. Today, setting up your computer to dial into an ISP is a relatively painless process, particularly if you have Win- dows 95, which does most of the work for you. Then it's just a matter of filling in some online forms so the ISP can verify your identity and establish a pass- word to protect your account. p Do not commit to a long-term access agreement at the outset if you don't have to, [ Try out the ISP for a few months first to see if you're satisfied with the service and j. technical support. Once you get your computer set up, it's not the end of the world t if you decide to switch providers.
