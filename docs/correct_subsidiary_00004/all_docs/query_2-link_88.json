Towards the end of 1996 many leading computer scientists designing agents and e-commerce applications became interested in using game theory. One team from the University of London approached the economics department where I was completing my PhD, asking for advice on how to apply game theory to automated negotiations. I already had Bachelors and Masters degrees in computer science, and was keen to get involved. My work on automated negotiations quickly grew to become a more general interest in the e-commerce phenomenon. There then followed four fascinating years of work on e-commerce with computer scientists, economists, start-up companies, management consultants and the e-commerce research team in the Hewlett–Packard laboratories. As my e-commerce work progressed, it soon became clear that there were two different research agendas. The first was the use of microeconomic analysis to gain an understanding of the value of various e-commerce technologies and Internet-based trading mechanisms. In the period between 1997 and 1999 ecommerce companies were the darlings of investors. Blinded by fantastic market capitalization rates, little attention was paid to the answers provided by start-up companies to questions such as who will pay for what and why. Often, startups would say something like “this application will save consumers an average of $10 and therefore they will be willing to pay $5 for it”. While such statements were often true, they tended to ignore what I call the “total game”, for example the response of sellers to applications that empower buyers. For instance, sellers can (and xi\n\nxii Preface do) block access to their sites to many e-commerce applications, or even use the same technology for a different purpose. In the long run, only business models based on sound economic propositions—which take into account the “total game”—will survive and flourish. And that is where microeconomic analysis is essential. The second research agenda was centered on the use of game theory for designing and running e-commerce applications. The early attempts of computer scientists to use game theory in automated negotiations fall into this category. In particular, there was—and still is—huge interest in auctions for buying and selling almost anything. The success of eBay (and to a lesser extent Priceline.com) made auctions familiar and popular with consumers. Moreover, they triggered consumer appetite for new methods of buying and selling goods. On the business side, companies such as Ariba, CommerceOne and FreeMarkets heavily promoted the use of auctions in business-to-business transactions. The wave of largely successful mobile phone auctions in the United States and Europe also contributed strongly to the notion that game theory is a useful theory in designing economic institutions. Game theory is the study of the interactions between rational decision-makers. It is formal and is based largely on mathematical modeling. It is perfectly suited for designing ecommerce applications because of the formal nature of the rules that govern the interactions between participants. The second part of the book is therefore a reference guide to the principles of economic engineering in the context of e-commerce: how economic analysis—and game theory in particular—can be used to help design efficient e-commerce applications. The first years of co-operation between game theorists, economists and computer scientists led to an explosion of research in this area—so much so that in the first world conference in game theory (held in Bilbao in the summer of 2000), there were almost as many computer scientists as economists. In my opinion this research has only just begun. The computer scientists working in this area belong mainly to a field of computer science known as artificial intelligence (AI) .1 It is an interesting 1\n\nInterestingly, AI—which was big in the 1980s and vanished in the 1990s—is now making a comeback. In March 2002 The Economist wrote: “Large companies are also using the term [AI] … Microsoft announced a “breakthrough application that enlists\n\nPreface xiii fact that AI and economics have had many overlapping interests over the years. John von Neuman’s pioneering work laid the foundations for modern AI as well as modern game theory. Along the same lines, Herbert Simon’s work on rationality and bounded rationality greatly influenced research in both fields. It is therefore not surprising that we find ourselves today in a situation where researchers from both fields are working together in pursuit of what may become one of the more important technological changes of modern life. In the short term, computer science is likely to benefit more from this cooperation, because economic wisdom on the efficiency of systems consisting of self-interested agents can be directly applied to most e-commerce applications. In addition, the economic methodology, which stresses the importance of looking for the underlying incentives of participants, can provide important insights into automated negotiations and electronic trade. But in the long term, economists also have much to gain from this joint adventure. By focusing on what is essentially an application of economic theory and mechanism design to automated environments, we can learn about the usefulness of our theories and intuitions. HOW TO USE THIS BOOK Although this book is based on recent research, it is essentially a textbook, and should be read as such. It is designed primarily for MBA students. The course is intended for those students who are likely to implement e-commerce in the organization for which they work, or through work as consultants, or for those who are considering starting their own Internet business or working for such a start-up. The book can be used as a text for an MBA elective. In Oxford this elective is titled “advanced e-commerce”. To cover the whole book, a minimum of 15–20 teaching hours are required. It is essential from my experience that students have already taken a basic course in microeconomics (for example managerial economics), because otherwise it is easy to get “bogged down” in trying to grasp basic economic concepts. However, it should be possible to cover the material without being too formal—most of the intuitions are straightforward the power of artificial intelligence to help users manage mobile communications. … Sony also unabashedly uses the term AI.”\n\nxiv Preface and could be explained using basic diagrams and examples. The book can also be used in more “general purpose” microeconomics course for MBA as a source of examples and applications of the theory. Some of the chapters are more difficult than others. In particular, chapters 3 and 4 are more theoretical, and it might be advisable to dedicate more than one lecture to each of these. Alternatively, it would be possible to cover only parts of these chapters. Chapter 5 is more general and can be used either as an introduction to the second part of the book, or as a topic on its own. In the latter case it will be useful to supplement the reading, for example with material from Milgrom and Robert’s Economics, Organization and Management (1998). Migrom and Roberts include many useful discussions and examples of incentive contracts and economic engineering. The remaining three chapters of this book—6, 7 and 8—are, in my experience, relatively straightforward to teach, and there are many examples that can be used to illustrate the material covered in these chapters. The book is also suitable for undergraduate and graduate economics students. When teaching graduate students it may be useful to suggest that students read the actual research papers referred to in the text. The book covers research other than my own, but it is heavily biased toward my own work. It might be a good idea to supplement the reading with other texts, particularly with the excellent “Information Rules” by Shapiro and Varian (1999), to give students a more comprehensive view of the economic issues in e-commerce.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe book is centered on my research over the last four years. During this time I have had the pleasure of working with a number of other researchers in this area. In particular, my research with Ken Binmore, Tuomas Sandholm, Zvika Neeman and Chris Preist is described in various places in the book. It was a great experience working with each of them. I am particularly grateful to Ken, who also provided helpful comments on an early version of various chapters. In writing the book, I was greatly assisted by Eleanor Scott, my research assistant, who helped compile many of the examples used in the book. Romesh Vaitilingam provided valuable help in organizing the book, and I am grateful for his many useful suggestions. I am also in debt to my editor, Richard Baggaley for his support throughout the ups and downs of this project. Finally, many thanks to my wife Fiona for her patience, and for looking after our babies in the long evenings while I was writing this book. I dedicate this book in memory of my father, Uzi Vulkan, who instilled in me the love of learning and science.\n\nxv\n\nThe Economics of E-commerce\n\nChapter 1 Introduction and Overview\n\nThe phenomenal growth of the Internet since the mid-1990s is an unprecedented event in the history of information and communications technology. The Internet, essentially a collection of computer networks linked by cable and satellite, which started off connecting four supercomputers, today links more than 300 million people in 170 countries. And the rate of Internet traffic continues to grow rapidly. The Internet has already fundamentally changed the way many individuals and organizations think about and perform their work. Electronic commerce—the conduct of business activities electronically via digital media—is now part of everyday business. And despite the sharp falls in the share prices of many ‘dotcoms’ since early 2000, e-commerce is still likely to have a major and lasting effect on most forms of economic activities. This is true for the interactions of businesses both with consumers and with other businesses. On the business-to-business (B2B) side, web-based procurement systems, online business auctions and electronic negotiations are already commonplace in the interactions of large to medium-sized businesses with their suppliers and clients. 1 On the consumer side, the Internet is emerging as a significant medium for buying and selling certain goods, such as books, computer software and hardware, music CDs and airline tickets. Advances in web-based technologies further support the growth of e-commerce. In particular, automation and delega1\n\nOn October 5, 2002, The Economist ran a story “Life after dotcom death”, which began with the sentence; “If you think B2B market places are dead, read on”.\n\n1\n\n2 Chapter 1 tion technologies—known variously as intelligent or smart ‘agents’, ‘shopping bots’ or ‘bidding elves’—are likely to have a considerable effect on the future of e-commerce. These software programs make it possible, for example, for consumers to conduct automated searches and price comparisons, and for online sellers to know the identity of visiting consumers, access background information on them in real-time and adjust their prices and offerings accordingly. The technologies can even make decisions on behalf of individuals, negotiate with other programs and participate in online markets. Much of the economic value of e-commerce arises from this kind of automation. The opportunities to use the Internet for business and comparison shopping are increased significantly by technologies that can take the place of activities that were previously done manually, especially those that were most costly in terms of data and working hours. And ecommerce, particularly automated e-commerce, creates new economic value not only by making business processes easier, but also by opening up new possibilities for market interactions. That is the issue at the heart of this book. The aim is to provide an understanding of the added economic value of e-commerce applications for readers searching for “e-commerce solutions”. These might include e-commerce strategists and business managers in corporations, designers of new applications—whether online retailers, B2B marketplaces, negotiation technologies, auction websites or electronic exchanges—and potential investors in these enterprises. As the rise and fall in the valuations of the first wave of ecommerce companies show, promises of profits at some vague point in the future are no longer going to be sufficient. Only business models based on sound economic propositions will survive and flourish. And that is where economic analysis is essential. This book provides the reader with the tools to understand and evaluate the underlying economic propositions of the wide range of actual and potential e-commerce businesses. And it demonstrates how the tools can be used to assess a variety of existing applications. The first part of the book investigates the economic value of both consumer and business e-commerce applications, using the tools of economic analysis to explore key questions about the variety of trading mechanisms on the Internet. For example, are electronic markets likely to be more or less competitive\n\nIntroduction and Overview 3 than ‘bricks-and-mortar’ markets? And what are the pros and cons of dynamic pricing, where sellers price their offerings according to the identity of each individual consumer? The goal is to understand the advantages of online trading mechanisms and the choices of individuals and organizations over which mechanism to use and when. Chapter 2 lays out the basic tools of economic analysis that can be used to evaluate e-commerce applications, notably the assumption of rationality, game theory and the concept of equilibrium. The guiding principle is that, to understand the way electronic markets—indeed any markets—work, it is essential to have an overarching framework of analysis. This demands, first, a basic intuition of what incentives determine economic behavior, and the only reasonable one to use is rationality, i.e. that people (and software programs operating on their behalf) act in their own best interests. Second, it requires a way of thinking about how economic interactions take place across the whole market place; game theory is a very effective tool. And finally, it needs a “solution”, some means of predicting and assessing the potential outcome or outcomes of all those interactions, and that comes from the concept of equilibrium. Chapter 3 surveys e-commerce for consumers, focusing in particular on the economic implications of Internet technologies for prices and product offerings, and for competition between firms. There are two key questions: what are the incentives for consumers and retailers to trade online; and is it buyers or sellers who benefit the most? Relatively simple economic analysis can clarify the economic proposition underlying many consumer e-commerce technologies, notably “ShopBots”, i.e. virtual robots that scan the web for price and product information on behalf of consumers and retailers, and ‘personalization technologies’, which provide retailers and marketing companies with an enormous amount of consumer-specific data. Shopping bots, for example, reduce the search costs of consumers virtually to zero since the software program does all the searching. At first sight, this might suggest that markets will become more competitive and prices will fall, at least those for homogeneous goods like books, CDs and software. But economic analysis casts some doubt on this view, and there is evidence that, although the prices of some goods are cheaper on the Internet, loyalty and branding still play a major role in the electronic retailing industry.\n\n4 Chapter 1 Economics sheds light on the real relationship between consumer search power and the pricing strategies of online sellers, especially the new opportunities the latter have, using personalization technologies, to tailor both prices and products to individual consumers. Sellers can now take advantage of the vast array of data on their customers to treat them as individuals, employing such practices as price discrimination, product differentiation, ‘one-to-one’ marketing and mass customization. Chapter 3 addresses the incentives for both sellers and consumers to engage with each other using these technologies and marketing strategies. Chapter 4 provides an overview of B2B e-commerce, focusing in particular on the economic advantages of trading through ecommerce and comparing the pros and cons of the three main forms of electronic markets. In broad terms, firms can trade online via ‘one-to-one’ or direct negotiations; by participating in ‘one-to-many’ auctions; or through ‘many-to-many’ exchanges, where there are many potential buyers and sellers at any given time. The volume of business e-commerce is estimated to be nearly ten times as large as that of consumer e-commerce. Most companies now use the Internet in one way or another to trade with their suppliers and corporate customers. Large parts of the supply chain are automated using e-commerce. And auctions are commonplace, as are web-based markets for many commodities, like steel and metal. Chapter 4 provides a framework with which to understand the economic value of these business electronic markets. There are two key questions: what is the added economic value from switching to trading with other businesses from offline to online; and what is the preferable online trading mechanism; that is, how do firms choose the most profitable way to trade online? Economic analysis reveals how webbased markets—online auctions and electronic exchanges—can overcome the inefficiencies often associated with direct negotiations. If part I of this book is about evaluating existing e-commerce applications, part II is about how to make things better. Economic engineering—the design of market mechanisms that encourage desirable economic outcomes—is certainly not a new invention, but the opportunities for practicing it have increased dramatically with the growth of e-commerce. The public seems to have acquired an appetite for trying out new\n\nIntroduction and Overview 5 ways of buying and selling. Managers understand that proper economic engineering can make all the difference to their businesses. And the pressure toward trading electronically and further automation of the supply chain increases, because no one wants to be left out. It is no longer acceptable for managers not to know the advantages and disadvantages of auctions, say, or price discrimination. The second part of the book is therefore a reference guide to the principles of economic engineering in the context of ecommerce: how economic analysis—and game theory in particular—can be used to help design efficient e-commerce applications. It has been said that economists are forever theorizing about how they could make the world more efficient if only they were given a chance. Over the last ten years or so, they have finally had that chance. For example, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission invited a number of game theorists to design its telecommunications auctions. These turned out to be a huge success, bringing in revenues far greater than originally expected. Other countries, including the U.K., followed suit, employing game theorists to design large-scale auctions in order to maximize the government’s revenue from licencing state-owned and natural resources. Economic engineering is of course much more general than auction design. It is a set of tools for designing the rules that govern any interactions between individuals and firms. Over the last three decades, rapid progress in game theory has brought the subject to an engineering-like state, where a large number of well understood mechanisms can be prescribed for given sets of circumstances. Electronic markets are a particularly good place to apply this theory, because the interactions between participants are already regulated by the communication protocols of the software. They may as well be regulated by a well designed protocol, which, by setting the ‘rules of the game’ appropriately, provides participants with the right incentives leading to efficient outcomes. Chapter 5 sets out the basic principles of market engineering and its uses for e-commerce. Game theory can be used to consider the possible implications of various sets of rules, such as auctions and exchange, on the behavior of self-interested participants. On the basis of these conclusions, it is then possible to select mechanisms that ensure the efficiency of many types of e-commerce application.\n\n6 Chapter 1 Chapter 6 describes how ideas from the theory of negotiation can be used to resolve potential conflicts between participants in e-commerce applications. Negotiations lie at the heart of almost all e-commerce scenarios: buyers and sellers bargain for a price, companies negotiate the terms of agreement, and so on. In fact, a certain degree of conflict of interest is inevitable in most e-commerce applications (because of the nature of interactions between self-interested economic actors), and the parties involved must use some form of negotiation to resolve it. Economic analysis takes the view that the choice of protocol (or the “rules of the game”) will typically affect the behavior of participants. For example, someone (or a software program acting on a person’s behalf) who is capable of making a credible “take-it-or-leave-it” offer is typically in a good bargaining position (paradoxically because they refuse to bargain). The designers of e-commerce systems must therefore take account of the strategic considerations of participants, especially in oneto-one bargaining situations, where these considerations are particularly significant. Chapter 6 reviews the theory and applications, and describes a number of new technologies designed specifically for e-commerce applications that involve one-toone bargaining. Chapter 7 deals with auctions, clear winners of the e-commerce phenomena. Consumer web-based auction houses like eBay.com involve trade worth millions of dollars every day. Businesses in large numbers are incorporating online auctions into their transactions. And Microsoft’s release of an auction component in its e-commerce server will probably cause an increasing number of website developers to consider online auctions as part of their e-commerce solutions. By using an auction—instead of committing in advance to a fixed price—the seller is able to charge prices that reflect what buyers are willing to pay. This practice can, in many cases, increase the profits of the seller considerably. Auctions are also an effective way of resolving the ‘one-tomany’ bargaining problem so that the seller does not need to negotiate with each of the potential buyers separately. This is particularly true for e-commerce, since the Internet can support only a limited amount of communication at any given time. Chapter 7 reviews the basic principles behind auction theory and describes a number of common auction types. It also describes a number of e-commerce auction technologies.\n\nIntroduction and Overview 7 Chapter 8 explores ‘many-to-many’ negotiations. This is a common set-up for trading in most commodities, where at any given stage there are many buyers and sellers. The chapter explains how exchanges operate, how they are created and the incentives of participants to join them. It also provides designers of e-commerce exchanges with the basic theoretical tools to create and maintain such markets. The chapter begins by discussing how goods and services can be standardized and describes the experience of a number of exchanges that struggle to standardize their offerings. It then discusses how exchanges work. Specifically, we examine what it means to set clearing prices and what affects this is likely to have on the market. A key factor in determining the success of the exchange is its ability to provide liquidity. The chapter explains what exactly liquidity is and who provides it. It shows that industry consortiums are most likely to succeed in the long run because of their ability to bring enough liquidity to the market. Finally, the chapter discusses the possibility of automating trading, by providing traders with software agents. Agents reduce the cost of trading, and increase its speed. These affects can increase trading volume, market efficiency and the profits made by the exchange. But traders need to trust their agents. The chapter describes Hewlett–Packard’s “Jester” experiments on the human–agent interface in exchange trading, and draws conclusions for the future use of such a technology. The book ends with a case study of electronic communications networks (ECNs) and the affect they had on security trading in the United States in the second part of the 1990s.\n\nChapter 2 E-commerce and the Tools of Economic Analysis\n\nThe latter half of the 1990s and the early years of the new millennium have witnessed an enormous growth in interest in the possibilities of e-commerce. But much of the hype has focused on specific applications, such as the success (in terms of media profile if not business profitability) of particular “early mover” companies like Amazon. Relatively little consideration has gone into a systematic overview of the economic development of ecommerce, thinking carefully through the incentives and interactions of buyers and sellers across the whole electronic marketplace. But economic analysis is a powerful way of thinking about the business world, and this chapter begins to make a case for using economics as an essential tool for understanding e-commerce. It lays out the basic tools of economic analysis that can be used to evaluate e-commerce applications, notably the assumption of rationality, game theory and the concept of equilibrium. The guiding principle is that, to understand the way electronic markets—indeed, any markets—work, it is essential to have an overarching framework of analysis. Such a framework will be of great value to software designers, business managers and investors in e-commerce applications. THE PHENOMENAL GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE The single most important force behind the phenomenal growth of e-commerce is the increased access to the Internet. The Internet itself, however, is only the medium for the services using it, like e-mail, the World Wide Web and e-commerce. No 11\n\n12 Chapter 2 single organization or government owns the Internet— although the telecoms companies own much of its backbone—and consequently it is much more difficult to regulate. This was illustrated in May 2000, when the French authorities tried to bar Yahoo’s auctions of Nazi items under broad French anti-hate speech laws, threatening the U.S.-based site with fines of as much as $13,000 per day unless it blocked French citizens’ access to the items. Yahoo protested, saying it ran a French auction site which abides by local laws but could not effectively block people in France from going to other country-specific sites to access the objectionable material. In November 2000, a U.S. federal judge ruled that Yahoo was not bound to comply with French laws governing Internet content. Yahoo’s case demonstrated how the true global nature of the Internet makes it particularly difficult to enforce different types of national regulation. The Internet offers global access to information through web browsers, like Internet Explorer or Netscape. Web browsers are essentially a universal standardized technology. The standardization of web access makes e-commerce a viable option for all businesses, however small. It is difficult to overstate this last fact. Electronic trading is not a new invention: companies like General Electric and Hewlett Packard (HP) were trading electronically as early as the 1980s, using what was then known as Electronic Data Interchanges (or EDIs). But they first had to spend millions of dollars creating a unified interface for electronic interactions with their suppliers. Suppliers, too, had to incur large costs to install and use the software. Moreover, the HP software could be used only for trading with HP, and so on. This situation has changed dramatically. Nowadays, once a trading mechanism has been established on the web, the costs of participating are very small, because the enabling technology for e-commerce (browsers) is freely available to all. The Internet brings together geographically dispersed buyers and sellers, significantly increasing the size of potential markets. For buyers, it provides easy access to catalogs and price lists of sellers. Most businesses on the Internet face relatively low entry, set-up and maintenance costs, although the costs of advertising and fulfillment are still high. Electronic retailers also face lower menu costs (the cost to the seller of changing its prices, e.g. print new menus, update price tags, etc.) compared with their “bricks-and-mortar” counterparts, which allows\n\nE-commerce and the Tools of Economic Analysis 13 them to update their prices frequently in response to changes in demand or supply. At present, Internet-based electronic commerce is, for the most part, restricted to online shops and services that are accessible via a web browser. A consumer can search for a product and purchase it by simply entering a valid credit card number. Such services are sometimes referred to as “first-generation” or user-driven e-commerce: the consumer uses the Internet to search and locate a specific product and to make a single purchase. These types of e-commerce application are now commonplace, and are likely to account for the bulk of electronic commerce for the immediate future. But prototypical “second-generation” e-commerce applications are now beginning to emerge. Here the user—be it an individual or an organization—delegates the authority to transact business to a software program. E-commerce becomes automated. The emergence of automated e-commerce There are substantial cost savings from automating the business process. Using this technology, retailers can stay open, at no extra cost, for 24 hours a day, customers can search even when they are not logged on, and businesses can take better advantage of market opportunities by authorizing software programs to make decisions on their behalf. For example, consumers make use of “shopping bots” to search the Internet for the best deal of particular items, and businesses make use of automated “bidding elves” in complex online auctions. Automated interactions are becoming increasingly important, partly because of “technology push”—the growth of standardized communication infrastructures and advances in automated negotiation technology—and partly because of “application pull”—such as web purchasing of goods, information and communication bandwidth, and the continuing industrial trend toward outsourcing. If anything can be termed “revolutionary” in e-commerce, then it must include these automated interactions between individuals and organizations. Automated software programs increase the search power of users, and allow more extensive and “smarter” searches in large databases—a process, that is currently slow and may be offputting to many users. These programs are also able to perform interactive searches on behalf of their users. For example, a ShopBot searching for airline tickets from virtual travel agencies\n\n14 Chapter 2 on the web can match preferred dates, price range, class of travel and other features of the journey, without having to go back to the user, on whose authority it is operating, at any stage. If prices are negotiable, then it is possible (at least technologically possible) that programs equipped with some negotiation skills will do the bargaining on behalf of their users. Similarly, this technology can be used by sellers to tailor the contents of their site. Most sites require that users register with them first. Of course, consumers benefit from being registered through a shorter process and faster and more efficient service. But it does mean that the seller knows the identity of the consumer surfing, and in particular details such as post codes, in real-time. An online catalog can be individually customized to match the user’s likely requirements: all the seller needs to do is install the appropriate software—there are no further costs in rearranging the content. More generally, the company’s site can be rearranged for the user. In particular, the technology can be used to offer different prices to different consumers. E-commerce provides the first real opportunity to practice this type of personalization and discrimination. Much of the economic value of e-commerce arises from this kind of automation. The opportunities to use the Internet for business and comparison shopping are increased significantly by technologies that can take the place of activities previously done manually, especially those that were most costly in terms of data and working hours. And e-commerce, particularly automated e-commerce, creates new economic value, not only by making business processes easier but also by opening up new possibilities for market interactions. WHY USE ECONOMICS TO ANALYZE E-COMMERCE? Economics is a huge subject area. Traditionally, it is divided into microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of detailed individual decisions, while macroeconomics emphasizes the interactions in the economy as a whole, abstracting from the choices of specific individual and organizations. There are many interesting micro- and macroeconomic issues arising from e-commerce. But this book focuses solely on the microeconomics and does not address such macroeconomic issues as electronic money and the effects of e-commerce on globalization. The main reason for this choice is that e-commerce is largely a business phenomenon—individual companies introducing new trading mechanisms and e-com-\n\nE-commerce and the Tools of Economic Analysis 15 merce applications. Although governments are looking to respond to these changes with appropriate legislation, the type of applications and strategies currently seen in the market are largely driven by market forces. This suggests that, before proper macroeconomic analysis can be carried out, it is necessary to understand the microeconomics of e-commerce. As a science, economics is both descriptive and constructive. It can be used to describe—and therefore better understand— observed phenomena. For example, it can be used to describe why books are likely to be sold on the web, while other goods are not. Economics can also be used to construct economic institutions, such as e-commerce applications where buyers and sellers interact. For example, the theory of double auctions can be used to design an efficient web-based global market for steel. Both approaches are used in this book, the descriptive more in part I, which shows how to evaluate e-commerce applications, and the constructive more in part II, which explores how to design e-commerce applications. Economics is a powerful tool for looking at the world, a means of analyzing how the economy, or a part of it, works and of making predictions about what will happen if something is changed. At its heart is a basic intuition of what incentives determine economic behavior: rationality, the assumption that people (and software programs operating on their behalf) act in their own best interests. Next, it involves a way of thinking about how economic interactions take place across the whole marketplace, something provided by game theory. And finally, it offers “solutions”, some means of predicting and assessing the potential outcome or outcomes of all those interactions: this comes from the concept of equilibrium. The useful assumption of rationality The chief assumption underlying economic thinking is rationality, which can be broadly defined as the assumption that economic actors (be they individuals, organizations or even software programs) act in their self-interest (or, in the case of software programs, in the self-interest of their users). In other words, when presented with a number of choices, they—to the extent that they can—rationally choose the action that helps them best achieve their goals. So, for example, companies will choose pricing strategies to maximize their profits, and consumers will look to pay as little as possible. If it is not known which action is the best, then it\n\n16 Chapter 2 is assumed that economic actors will choose the action that they expect to be the best, given whatever limited information they have and their goals. 1 It is possible within this framework that people are altruistic or make choices that do not benefit themselves directly. As long as this is what they want—is part of their goal—there is no contradiction between the assumption of rationality and such behavior. Is this assumption always justified? Of course not. Everyone is familiar with cases where people make choices that they later regret. But economics deals only with those cases where choices are “optimal”. In other words, economics is all about explaining the interactions of rational agents. There are a number of justifications for this. • First, there is no proper and robust theory of irrationality and it is therefore best to stick to what can be described. • Second, in many cases in commerce, economic actors do try to act rationally (i.e. to make the best, or optimal, decision). Managers, for example, are paid to do what is best for the company they are running, and many consumers compare prices and other attributes of the goods and services they are buying. This argument goes further: even if people are unaware of their decision processes, over time, and especially in the cases where they care about the outcomes, they will behave as if they are maximizing some goals. These goals, whether they are aware of them or not, are what economists call revealed preferences—the real goals as revealed by actions. • Finally, much of economics, and certainly much of what is discussed in this book, is to do with how individuals or organizations should behave. In other words, this book can be used by, say, managers to select what is optimal for their organization. Economics, the theory of rational choice, is the science that prescribes advice to organizations and individuals seeking to behave optimally. And if people 1\n\nSuppose, for example, that the economic actor in question expects that action A will lead to a payoff of either $10 or $0 with equal probability, while action B is expected to yield payoffs of either $12 or $5. Then action B is preferred to A because its expected payoff is higher.\n\nE-commerce and the Tools of Economic Analysis 17 care enough about the outcomes (for example, if there are large sums of money involved), and if the rules are not too complicated, then they will try to behave pretty much as the theory predicts. Using game theory to understand business interactions It is common nowadays to think of the interactions between self-interested economic actors as games and of the actors themselves as players. Game theory, which has had a huge impact on microeconomics over the last three decades, is dominant throughout much of this book. The basic idea is that, just as the rules of most games like chess or poker can be described formally, so can the rules governing most economic interactions. And, just as players in a game play to win, so economic actors play to “win” their own goals. 2 So, for example, the seller of an antique chair and bidders participating in their web-based auction play a game where the seller’s goal is to try and get the highest price and each bidder is attempting to win the object while paying as little as possible. There are two significant points about game theory as a way of analyzing business situations. • First, it provides a uniform language with which to describe the interactions of self-interested economic actors. • Second, it defines the “solutions” or “equilibria” of games. In analyzing games, economic actors are players and the actions and decisions available to them are referred to as their strategies. For example, each bidder in a sealed bid auction submits a single bid that must be a non-negative number, and so the set of positive real numbers are the bidders’ possible strategies. Once all players have selected their strategies, the game is played and an outcome is realized. For example, assume that the auctioneer of an antique chair gives it to the bidder with the highest bid and charges her this bid. Suppose now that there are three players, A, B and C, and 2\n\nParadoxically, game theory contributed very little to understanding of board games like chess—it turns out that chess is far too complicated to describe in terms of strategies—and yet managed to revolutionize the analysis and design of many economic institutions.\n\n18 Chapter 2 that A bids $110, B bids $70, and C bids $95, then A will win the chair and will pay the auctioneer $110. For a given selection of strategies, it is therefore possible to talk about the payoffs to each of the players. Continuing with the same example, it is clear that players B and C receive a payoff of zero. Suppose that A values the chair at $150. Then A’s payoff is $150–$110=$40. Suppose further that the worth of the chair to the seller was $55. Then the seller’s payoff equals $110–$55=$55. So how do strategies and payoffs play out in the analysis of games? The main solution concept used by economists is the Nash equilibrium. 3 A Nash equilibrium is a combination of strategies, one for each player, which has the property that, given the choice of strategies of the other players, none of the players wants unilaterally to change their strategy. In other words, each of the players chooses their optimal strategy given the choices of the other players. For example, consider the decision of firms concerning whether to adopt a new technology for electronic trading. Installing this technology is costly, but if at least half of the other firms in the market also adopt it, then the rewards outweigh the costs. This situation can be described as a game: each firm’s set of strategies consists of two options: “adopt the new technology”, and “do not adopt the new technology”. It is easy to see that the strategy a given firm should choose depends on the choices made by the other firms: if at least half of the other firms adopt the new technology, then it is optimal to do so too. If fewer than half the other firms adopt the technology, then it is optimal not to do so. What are the Nash equilibria of this game? Remember that in a Nash equilibrium none of the firms will want to change their choice of strategy. So, clearly, a situation where some of the firms adopt the technology and some do not cannot be an equilibrium. If the fraction of firms adopting the technology is greater than one-half, then each of the firms not adopting the technology would be better off changing their strategy. Similarly, if this fraction is smaller than one-half, then each of the adopters would have been better off not adopting the technology. So the only two “candidates” for equilibria are the cases where all firms choose the same strategy. And indeed, each of 3\n\nSo named after the American mathematician John Nash, who formalized it in the 1950s. In 2002 the extraordinary life of John Nash became the subject of a successful Hollywood film, A Beautiful Mind.\n\nE-commerce and the Tools of Economic Analysis 19 these cases is a Nash equilibrium. If everyone adopted the technology, then no single firm would prefer to change its strategy. Similarly, no one wants to be the only adopter of the technology, because this is not cost effective. This example demonstrates both the advantages and disadvantages of the notion of a Nash equilibrium. Clearly, the two outcomes are very different—all the players (firms) will be better off in the equilibrium where the technology is adopted. Yet both outcomes equally qualify as an equilibrium. So a Nash equilibrium does not reveal everything about optimality. But, since the outcome for each firm depends on the choices made by others, it is not possible to say something meaningful about the optimal choice of a given firm without reference to the choices made by others. So a Nash equilibrium is a measure of stability rather than optimality. Recall the definition of a Nash equilibrium: “None of the players wants unilaterally to change their strategy.” Think of economic situations as evolving: individuals and firms make choices and then update them in response to outcomes. Suppose that at some stage players arrive at a Nash equilibrium (for example, in this case, all firms, say, do not adopt the technology). Then they are likely to continue with whatever they are doing (at least for some time), because none of them can gain from changing their behavior. And so this situation is stable. But if they did not arrive at the Nash equilibrium (for example if only 80 percent of firms adopt the new technology), then at least one of them (e.g. any of the firms in the 20 percent that did not adopt it) does have an incentive to change. And so the situation is not stable. The concept of equilibrium The notion of equilibrium is central to modern economics. Economists trying to understand economic phenomena construct an analytical model and solve it by computing its equilibria. These equilibria are then thought of as the predictions of the model: since economic actors are assumed to be rational, they will continue to change their behavior as long as this is beneficial. Only in equilibrium does no one have an incentive to change, and so this is likely to resemble actual behavior, at least in the long run. For example, in chapter 3 we study the implications for consumers and Internet retailers in adopting technologies, such as personalization and search agents. To do so, we first build a styl-\n\n20 Chapter 2 ized model 4 of the interactions between buyers and sellers in electronic markets, where the technology investigated is not in use. We find the equilibrium of this model and compute the payoffs for buyers and sellers. Then we re-examine the same stylized model, this time allowing for the technology to be used, but keeping everything else fixed. This modified model will have a new equilibrium, and once we find it, we again compute the payoffs for everyone involved. Since everything in our analysis has remained fixed except the use of the technology investigated, we can say that the effect of using this technology say for retailers is described by the difference in their payoffs between the first and second equilibria. If retailers have a higher payoff in the second equilibrium, we say that they are better off using the technology; and so on. The equilibrium already takes into account the incentives and behaviors of all participants, and so describes the total effect of adopting the technology. Similarly, economists carrying out a design assignment (for example, designing an auction for a government) use equilibria to try to predict the outcome of their mechanisms if and when they are implemented. While this is true in general, it is particularly true for e-commerce design, where participants can be shown what their equilibrium actions should be. Since these actions are in their best interest, they are likely to follow them. For example, the online auction giant, eBay, uses second-price auctions, where the equilibrium action for bidders is to bid their maximal willingness to pay. (Chapter 7 explains why this is the case.) On their site eBay state: “eBay always recommends bidding the absolute maximum that one is willing to pay for an item early in the auction. … if one is outbid, one should be, at worst, ambivalent toward being outbid. After all, someone else was simply willing to pay more than you wanted to pay for it.” And so the equilibrium outcome is not only a prediction of using the design: it can also be used as a prescription for participants, which in turn makes it a very likely prediction.\n\n4\n\nA stylized model focuses on a few decision variables. For example, in one such stylized model firms compete only in prices, not in quantity or quality. In reality, most decisions involve many different considerations. It is normally difficult to model all these considerations, and so economists study stylized models, which allows them to focus on a small number of effects at a time.\n\nE-commerce and the Tools of Economic Analysis 21 This is the approach used throughout this book. Ideas are made precise by referring to formal economic analysis. The predictions of these models can be discussed by referring to their equilibria. KEY ISSUES • The value of e-commerce is best understood through a systematic overview of the economic development of e-commerce, thinking carefully through the incentives and interactions of buyers and sellers across the whole electronic marketplace. • The Internet offers global access to information and a variety of trading mechanisms through a universal standardized technology: web browsers. • E-commerce sellers face low menu costs. • Much of the economic value of e-commerce arises from the automation (for example using agents) of interactions between consumer and sellers, and between businesses. Automated e-commerce creates new economic value not only by making business processes easier, but also by opening up new possibilities for market interactions. • Economic theory can be used (1) to describe observed phenomena in e-commerce, and (2) to construct ecommerce applications. • Rationality of individuals and firms is a useful working assumption. • Game theory provides a useful language with which to describe interactions between economic actors. In particular, the notions of strategy, payoffs and Nash equilibrium are relevant. • Equilibrium analysis is the central tool both in describing economic phenomena and in constructing economic institutions.\n\nChapter 3 E-commerce for Consumers\n\nThe Internet is emerging as one of the most efficient and popular channels for buying and selling goods and services such as books, computer hardware and software, music CDs, videos and airline tickets. More and more customers are discovering the advantages of shopping online and the range of products available for online purchase is expanding. Within only a few years, web-based retailers such as Amazon and Travelocity have emerged as major players in their industries. Established names in high street retailing, which initially snubbed the Internet, have now reversed their decisions. This chapter provides an overview of consumer e-commerce, and considers the economic implications of Internet technologies for prices and product offerings, and for competition between firms. There are two key questions: • What is the economic value added from buying and selling online—in other words, why trade online? • Is it buyers or sellers who benefit most from consumer e-commerce? THE IMPACT OF E-COMMERCE ON PRICES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS How is Internet shopping different from “real” shopping? There are two key differences. • First, there is the ease of finding information and comparison shopping, especially for homogeneous products. This means reduced search costs compared with “real” shopping. • Second, sellers can now have far more information about their customers, through “personalization tech22\n\nE-commerce for Consumers 23 nologies”. These make it possible for retailers to know the identity of their consumers in “real-time”, to access data on past shopping patterns, and to change prices and offerings where appropriate. In principle, this opens up the opportunity to engage in the following strategies: (1) product differentiation: offering different versions of the same basic product to different market segments; (2) price discrimination: charging different consumers different prices for the same product; (3) “push” marketing: tailoring marketing messages to individual customers; and (4) mass customization: low-cost tailoring of the same basic product for individual customers. The advantages for consumers of shopping online For consumers shopping online, it is easy to find what they are looking for, to match goods more precisely to their particular requirements and to compare prices. This is especially true for homogeneous goods like CDs, books and software, but also for more complex products, such as airline tickets and mortgages. Suppose that you are looking to buy a music CD on the web. There are two ways to do this. You can either use any standard search engine, such as Yahoo or Altavista, type in what you want and get an enormous list of websites, then visit and interrogate each of them “manually” to find the price of the CD. This can be very time-consuming, and realistically, you will be able to check only a few of these sites. But it is still probably better than trawling round or telephoning stores, so there can be significant transaction cost savings from buying online. A more efficient alternative is to employ a “ShopBot”. Here you pick the category “music CD”, type in the name, and let the ShopBot visit many sites, 1 interrogate them to find the price, and return with the lowest price (or an ordered list of prices, starting with the cheapest). If you were to shop for the CD in real shops, you would need to spend time visiting or calling the shops to find out the price. The time costs of getting 1\n\nIn theory, search agents can interrogate thousands of sites within seconds. In practice, only a small number of sites are actually searched. The reason for this is not technological, but economical, as explained later on in the chapter.\n\n24 Chapter 3 even three or four price quotes are considerably high. In effect, the ShopBot reduces these costs to zero. There are many shopping bots currently available, such as DealTime, GreaterGood, (which promises to donate at least 5 percent of what you spend to the charity of your choice), Jango (now owned by Excite), mySimon, StreetPrices, StoreRunner and BidFind, which focuses on online auctions. Although the basic idea is similar in all these companies, the actual technology is different. MySimon, for example, uses a search technology it calls Virtual Learning Agent, which mimics human shopping behavior. Evenbetter’s bot pops up while any consumer who is registered with them is making purchases at sites such as Amazon, and displays a message indicating that the same item can be bought elsewhere more cheaply. With one click, the user is transferred to the site where the product is sold for less. ShopBots are proving very popular with online shoppers. According to a study conducted in 2000 by the consultancy Angus Reid, 67 percent of 1,000 employees surveyed in the United States who have access to the web at work used ShopBots at some stage. This figure was exceeded only by the percentage of those accessing research or search engines and checking news and sports headlines. Comparison shopping was a more common reason to surf than checking the stock market, playing video games, using online banking services or viewing adult sites, the report says. Although ShopBots tend to focus on homogeneous goods, where the only search dimension is price, there is no reason why the technology cannot be extended to deal with more complex goods. For example, Mortgagebot.com claims to have introduced the first website that enables consumers to comparison-shop among online mortgage lenders. The site compares rates and fees of the various lenders, searching for real-time price information and comparing the benefits of the lenders. The results are displayed in a format that makes it easy to compare different online lending options. “Intelligent search agents will reduce the search time for consumers interested in online mortgages and ultimately provide borrowers with a lower cost mortgage,” says Scott Happ, president and chief executive officer of M&I Mortgage Corp. and Mortgagebot.com. “By helping consumers discover which online lender has the best overall price, prospective borrowers can spend less time surfing and more time evaluating their\n\nE-commerce for Consumers 25 alternatives.” A typical search takes less than a minute. The company claims that conducting a similar search manually would take the average user about 30 minutes. Interestingly, the site includes itself in the comparisons, although it claims to gather information from competing lenders in an equitable fashion. “Objectivity is critical. We intend to promote this tool as a consumer-centric web destination enabling borrowers to obtain quick, unbiased price information from the top online lenders,” says Happ. But, as I explain later on in this chapter, there are good reasons for consumers to doubt such statements. But retailers benefit too Consumers undoubtedly benefit from shopping online. But there are also substantial benefits for retailers. For a start, sellers too can take advantage of reduced search costs to monitor each other’s pricing behavior and may even be able to maintain higher prices. But sellers also benefit from the second important difference between Internet and non-Internet shopping: the ability to know exactly who is surfing a site and to access their data in real-time. Personalization can be carried out according to website demographics (the user profile for a given site); individual domains (attributes inferred from the user’s web browser); learning (by monitoring the behavior of users and learning their preferences), and correlation (by comparing the user’s preferences with other users with similar interests and suggesting possible contents based on this correlation—for example, Barnes & Noble and Firefly have created a system that recommends books based on this method). Using personalization technology, sellers can tailor their offerings to the requirements of the person surfing as deduced from their data. They can also personalize the price they are charging. The essence of personalization technology is the ability to measure the shopper’s desire for the product and charge them accordingly and/or shape it to meet their precise needs. Personalization technology in e-commerce takes place on several levels. • First, sellers use a strategy of “first degree price discrimination”, where different consumers are charged different prices for exactly the same goods based on their identity.\n\n26 Chapter 3 • Second, sellers use e-commerce to allow customization of goods and services at very low cost, sometimes at no cost at all—what Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian (1999) call “versioning”. • Third, the technology means that retailers can now know the identity of the users, and can handle previously risky transactions—such as arranging a test drive in an expensive car—without the worry that they are dealing with a fraudster, or a mischievous teenager. E-commerce offers unprecedented opportunity to use consumer-specific information online. Because users normally register with sites (most companies either require registration or provide incentives for joining), the seller knows exactly who is surfing and can access their data in real-time. This allows sellers to tailor their offerings—and possibly the price they are charging—to the person surfing. The same data can be used to guess which goods or services the user will want next (for example, based on their past shopping pattern) and offer it to them in advance. More specifically, in recent years an enormous amount of consumer-specific data has been collected by retailers and marketing companies (for example, through the use of loyalty cards and frequent flyer programs). Now companies like British Telecom (BT) and the UK’s Post Office launch campaigns that offer firms the technology to target potential customers and tailor their marketing message to each individual. The same technology can then be used to develop customer profiles and relationships that are appropriate to each client individually. This is “one-to-one” or “push” marketing. The data agency Experian has launched a software package that enables e-commerce sellers to recognize customers instantly. It can send the user’s profile to retailers, including details of their wealth and the products they are most likely to buy. The site can then promote special deals to suit the user’s tastes. It is widely expected that financial companies will use the program to offer cheaper insurance, better mortgage rates and tailormade investments to customers. Richard Fiddis of Experian told the Sunday Times: The potential is limitless. Customers will benefit from cheaper deals and special offers. You could find that you are offered a discount off your purchases if, say, you take out a special credit card with a cheap rate.\n\nE-commerce for Consumers 27 Companies will be able to target their products with extreme accuracy, so bespoke offers are a natural progression. It is no good advertising good deals on expensive cars to a 14-year-old child, and discounted computer games are of little interest to a chief executive. Such a scattergun approach will soon become a thing of the past. Similar technologies are used in the United States: Shapiro and Varian (1999), for example, note that the online data provider Lexis-Nexis “sells to virtually every user at a different price”. Personalized pricing is likely to increase, because the technology that enables it is now in place. For example, in the United States the software company BroadVision offers a Retail Commerce Suite, which it says will allow any e-commerce player to practice “dynamic pricing”: charging different customers different prices for identical products. The pros and cons of personalized marketing An Internet shopping study conducted by Ernst & Young found that, in general, the Internet is used for “considered” shopping. In other words, users who know exactly what they want are using the Internet to find the best deal. Of course, this happens too in the world of bricks-and-mortar shops, but much of the time consumers go shopping so that they can look around to see what is available. They do not decide in advance what they are going to buy. This poses limitations on what can be achieved by regular forms of advertising. Consumers who know what they want are less likely to be pay attention to advertising. Sellers can, however, counter this problem by using personalization technologies. The technology can be used not only to collect data on the user, but also to use such data to predict what users will want next and offer it to them in advance. One technology that supports personalization is British Telecom’s YOU CAN. BT, which dominates the UK telecommunications arena (with approximately 80 percent of the business market and 64 percent of the residential market), set up YOU CAN to “help companies transform their business functions and harness available technology in order to remodel the way they relate to their customers”. The services include webenabled call centers, news and information channels, and customized IP network services.\n\n28 Chapter 3 The idea is to attract and retain the custom of the most profitable clients. To attract new customers, sellers should target potential customers and tailor their marketing message to each individual. They can then go on to develop customer profiles and relationships that are appropriate to each client individually. YOU CAN’s “customer relationship management” (CRM) services enable sellers to have a relationship with their customers and to learn what each customer wants and what they might want in the future. Sellers can then better respond to client needs and develop strong customer loyalty. By developing databases that collect and analyze data on customers, companies can identify their best clients, i.e. those making them the most money, and concentrate their marketing efforts accordingly. CRM means that companies have the information to allow them to find the right products for customers rather than the traditional means of marketing, which involves finding the right customers for products. Marketing is thus based on relationships with customers rather than being conducted en masse. By storing information on previous sales and interactions, companies can develop one-to-one relationships with customers and build more long-term relationships with them. YOU CAN offers a range of technologies to facilitate the attraction and retention of clients. Its electronic services play an important role. Electronic trading allows customers to order and pay for products over the Internet. Companies can also gather sales data in real-time, which enables them continually to monitor demand trends. The YOU CAN system collates information on every customer and then analyzes it to identify key groups and trends in behavior. Companies can use this information to tailor their marketing to the individual client and thus expand sales by offering them what they want, when they want it. More generally, software is now available which monitors the behavior of users. “Spyware” is a general term describing software that monitors the behavior of the user, building and updating a database of personal preferences and habits. These data can then be used to second-guess what the user is likely to want to buy next. If, for example, the user has just bought a weekend trip to Paris, the software can recommend a travel guide. Or it might suggest a one-click reservation option for a restaurant near the theater they are going to visit tonight. Naturally, not everyone is happy. Lawsuits have been launched in America against RealNetworks, DoubleClick and\n\nE-commerce for Consumers 29 Alexa, a subsidiary of Amazon. All allege that these data-monitoring companies infringe the individual’s privacy. The toy maker Mattel outraged consumers when an American journalist discovered, after installing a Mattel game for his daughter, a hidden piece of software called Brodcast that was silently connecting his computer to Mattel’s web server, which Mattel claimed was to check for software updates. But privacy protection lobbying groups around the world were quick to point out the software had many more capabilities, such as accessing any file on a computer, or tracking exactly how often Mattel games were played. Mattel quickly removed Brodcast from all its products. The term “spyware” was coined by an American software writer, Steve Gibson, who has since discovered spying devices in hundreds of pieces of commonly used software. He believes that, if you regularly use a computer, you almost certainly have spyware on your machine. He claims that “there are about 23 million pieces of spyware currently installed on machines without the users’ knowledge”. But the controversy over surveillance extends far beyond spyware. Almost every website uses a piece of code known as a “cookie” to track the movements of its users. These devices are no more than short text strings that pass from a given website to the user’s computer, where they are stored. Cookies were designed to enable a website to recognize the user. When linked into an online retailer’s profiling technology, the cookie compiles, for example, a record of all the holidays or cinema tickets bought by the user, building data incrementally into a profile reflecting the user’s unique tastes and spending power. Such a consumer database is invaluable to the direct marketing industry. The problem with both spyware and cookies is regulation. By its very nature, the web has no governing body and no police force to ensure that retailers care for and protect personal profiles in a responsible manner. Although the Data Protection Act in the UK ensures that consumers are made aware of how their personal data are to be exploited—and are given the option of having their confidentiality maintained— to enforce this policy across a medium as large as the Internet is impractical. The controversy over the future of personalization technologies was highlighted in 1999 in the furore that followed Intel’s announcement that it would stamp a serial number onto each Pentium III chip, which allows websites to\n\n30 Chapter 3 identify the computer being used to surf the net. Intel disabled the feature after privacy activists—with the support of the European Parliament—launched a boycott campaign. 2 So what determines who wins? It is clear that the value of consumer e-commerce technologies to both sellers and buyers is not as straightforward as it might at first seem. Consumers might benefit from being able to comparison-shop, but sellers too can take advantage of reduced search costs to monitor each other’s pricing behavior. This is where economic analysis begins to offer valuable insights, since it suggests that sellers can use the technologies to maintain higher prices. The increased ability of firms to treat their customers as individuals also has mixed effects. On the one hand, it allows sellers to charge their more loyal consumers higher prices. On the other hand, each consumer then becomes her own market, forcing sellers to compete more for their custom. The overall effect on prices and profits will depend on the specific features of the market, but economic analysis shows that in many cases consumers will actually be better off under individual pricing than under fixed pricing. However, reaching these results demands some prior economic analysis of how markets operate and then thinking through the impact that e-commerce has on that operation. In 1883, the French economist Joseph Bertrand made the observation that, if firms selling the same product compete only on price, they cannot make any positive profits. This result, known as the Bertrand paradox, can best be explained using game theory. Suppose that there are two retailers competing in a market with total demand D. They both have the same unit costs, c— that is, identical staff costs, shop rents and advertising budgets. Consumers monitor the prices charged by the retailers and buy from the cheapest. A “strategy” for each seller is the price he charges for the goods. In game theory terms, a strategy profile is a pair of prices ( p 1 , p 2 ), where p1 is the price charged by the first retailer and p2 is the price charged by the second retailer. In this case, the payoff for the first retailer is ( p 1 – c)*D if p 1 < p 2 2\n\nThe original purpose of the chip’s identification number was to support hardware digital certificates and other security measures that could be used to limit piracy by tracking users.\n\nE-commerce for Consumers 31 (that is, if it serves the whole market, and is making a profit of p1– c for each consumer); 0 if p 1 > p 2 ; and ( p 1 – c)*D/2 if p 1 = p 2 (that is, if the two retailers charge the same price and then split the demand between them). What is the Nash equilibrium of this game? Recall from chapter 2 that any strategy profile where (at least) one of the players has an incentive unilaterally to change his strategy (in this case price) cannot be an equilibrium. Suppose that p 1 > p 2 (that is, retailer 1 charges a higher price than retailer 2); then retailer 1 is making no profits. As long as p 2 > c, retailer 1 can gain by setting a price in between p2 and c. By doing so, he will gain the whole market demand (because his goods are now the cheapest) and make positive profits (because (p1– c)*D is positive if p 1 > c). This type of profitable price-cutting is possible as long as the cheapest price is greater than c. The Bertrand game therefore has a unique Nash equilibrium where both retailers set their prices equal to the unit cost, that is, p 1 = p 2 = c. But then neither retailer is making any profits: per unit sold the profit is zero, and so whatever size the demand, they both still make zero profits. It is possible that retailers face different costs, for example if one sells CDs on the Internet while the other runs a music shop with high rents and staff costs. The Nash equilibrium of this game will be different from the previous case, although the logic is similar. Here the retailer with the lower unit cost can set her price slightly below the unit cost of her competitor, gaining the whole market demand and still making positive profits (because this price is still higher than her own unit cost). In equilibrium, the retailer with the higher cost will make no sales and no profits. The retailer with the cost advantage will serve the whole market. Cost advantage may be the reason for the success of Internet retailers like Amazon, CDnow and Travelocity. But a closer look at the profits of the low-cost firm suggests that these profits diminish with the difference between their own costs and those of their second-cheapest competitor (because in order to gain the demand the retailer needs to set his own price below that of his competitor). The per-item profits are therefore equal to the differences in costs. If there is more than one Internet retailer, this difference is unlikely to be very large. The problematic aspects of the Bertrand result—that competing on price leads to no profits for anyone—are therefore relevant even if retailers have different unit costs.\n\n32 Chapter 3 The significance of the Bertrand result for competition in e-commerce Bertrand’s result is also known as the Bertrand paradox. This is because it shows how price competition leads to zero profits even if there are only two firms in the market. The same logic holds whether there are two or eight, or a million, retailers in the market: as long as the cheapest price is above unit cost, retailers can gain by price cutting, but this leads to prices equaling costs, and no profits. In reality, we tend to see that markets with a larger number of sellers are more competitive than markets with a small number of firms. It is rare that markets with two or three firms are at all competitive. Bertrand’s result is a paradox because, although it is mathematically sound on the one hand, on the other hand is inconsistent with our view of reality. Of course, several important features of real-world price competition are missing from Bertrand’s analysis, and these can help explain the discrepancy between the game and what is observed in the real world. Taking into account the significance of these assumptions by extending Bertrand’s analysis makes it possible to understand the realities of competition in e-commerce and whether it is buyers or sellers who are most likely to gain. Implicitly, the Bertrand model makes three assumptions. • The first assumption is that consumers can effortlessly, and at no cost, find the cheapest price no matter how many sellers operate in the market—the issue of search costs. • The second assumption is that sellers cannot react to price changes by their competitors; that is, the analysis assumes a “one-off” interaction—the issue of repeated interaction. • And the third assumption is that products are completely identical and that price is the only factor in determining consumer behavior. Thus, the analysis excludes the possibility of brand loyalty, different levels of quality of service, product differentiation and mass customization. The Bertrand result is a useful benchmark for the type of perfect competition that occurs if there is no friction in the market. The three assumptions can be thought of as the sources of friction, which prevent markets from being perfectly competitive. E-commerce is often dubbed “frictionless” (as in Bill Gates’s term, “friction free capitalism”). Using economic analysis to examine the sources of friction in markets provides a\n\nE-commerce for Consumers 33 better understanding of the economic value of the technologies that reduce friction. But this can only be done against the background of the Bertrand benchmark result. CONSUMER RESEARCH AND COMPARISON SHOPPING: THE ECONOMICS OF SEARCH COSTS If consumers need to invest less time and effort in finding information about the prices charged by various retailers—if search becomes less costly—then the competitive pressures on sellers are increased. At the same time, if search becomes less costly, then sellers are better informed and can therefore more easily monitor and react to their competitors’ pricing decisions. So what does the economic analysis of search costs suggest will be the impact of the growing use of ShopBots, where search is indeed becoming less costly? What can be learned from economic analysis Bertrand’s analysis assumes that consumers always buy from the seller with the cheapest price. But to do so they need to find this seller, and in reality the process of comparing prices can be lengthy and requires a certain amount of effort. Research shows that most consumers only “sample” prices, or do not compare prices at all. For example, many shops offer a “price guarantee” or “find the same product anywhere else for less and we will match this price”. It turns out that this type of price guarantee is enough for many consumers: they buy without even checking the price of other sellers. What is the implication of the fact that consumers (at least some consumers) do not compare prices because price search is costly? We can still get a single equilibrium price under the costly-search assumption. We now consider what this price will be (in other words, we begin by assuming a single price equilibrium and see what “candidates” there are for this price). Since all sellers charge the same prices, consumers have no incentive to do any search (because search is costly). All consumers will therefore buy from the first shop they visit. But if consumers never compare prices, then sellers have no incentive to lower prices! In fact, the only rational price to charge is the monopoly price—the price that maximizes their profits, given demand and ignoring other sellers—and certainly not the competitive price p = c suggested by Bertrand. Moreover, this conclusion is correct regardless of the actual costs of search. All that is needed for the argument to hold is\n\n34 Chapter 3 that search costs be positive, even if such costs are very small and insignificant, as for example in the case of price comparison by telephone. Making local telephone calls is cheap in most places in the United States, and so the only cost of search is the time of spending a few minutes on the telephone. This outcome is even more paradoxical than the Bertrand outcome. The “single price hypothesis” is therefore unlikely if search is costly. Instead, it is likely that retailers charge different prices and consequently that consumers (at least those consumers who care a lot about price, for example because they do not have much money) will compare prices before buying. The theory of costly search when prices differ can be further developed. In fact, there are a number of important economic studies of consumer and retailer behavior when search is costly. One such study is by Hal Varian (1980), in which he suggests that consumers can be broadly divided into two groups. • First, there are those who choose a shop at random and buy if the price is lower than a pre-decided reservation price (that is, the highest amount they are willing to pay for the goods or service, or the worth to them in monetary terms). • Second, there are those consumers who first search for the cheapest price and then buy at that price. Consider now the optimal pricing strategy of retailers in the presence of these two types of consumer. Each retailer will receive some share of the demand of the first type of consumer, regardless of its price, because these consumers do not compare prices. Retailers can occasionally conduct a sale, i.e. a price reduction on a number of their goods. If a retailer runs a sale, it has a chance of gaining the second type of consumer—those who search—at least if its price is at least as low as the other retailers conducting sales at the same time. This scenario with two types of consumer can be described as a game. In the equilibrium of this game, retailers will occasionally conduct sales. The frequency of these sales will depend on a number of factors, such as the size of demand, the number of competing retailers and the proportion of informed consumers. In particular, the larger the proportion of consumers who search, the more frequent the sales. And this proportion is likely to increase when the cost of search goes down. So this analysis predicts that, as search costs decrease,\n\nE-commerce for Consumers 35 the greater will be the frequency of sales, and consequently the lower (on average) prices will become. Other approaches to the economic analysis of search (for example Burdett and Judd, 1983) focus on sequential search behavior: consumers get a price quote and, depending on this, decide whether to continue to search. At each stage, consumers evaluate the best price they already have against the chances of finding a better price if they continue to search. Clearly, the more expensive it is to search, the less likely they are to search for long. By considering the equilibrium of such analyses, it is possible to link consumers’ search costs to price dispersion, i.e. the variation in prices charged by different retailers for the same product. While the approaches differ in exact details, they all have in common the fact that price dispersion decreases when search costs become lower. As search costs decrease, the market becomes more and more competitive and the prices come down toward their Bertrand level, p = c. Economic analysis confirms that search costs can be a source of friction in markets, something that prevents them from being fully competitive. The higher the costs of search for consumers, the greater the opportunities for retailers to charge higher prices. On the other hand, as search costs become smaller, prices should decrease and approach unit costs. With the advent of consumer e-commerce in general and ShopBots in particular, the prediction of this analysis can finally be put to the test. ShopBots have the potential to reduce consumer search costs to zero. Does this mean that prices will drop dramatically? Evidence of falling prices The Internet offers consumers easy access to a huge range of information about prices, particularly of homogeneous goods where price is the dominant factor in buying decisions. In recent years, researchers have begun to gather data on prices of such goods on and off the web. These data can be analyzed to address the following questions: does competition on the Internet lead to lower and more comparable prices? Do Internet retailers adjust their prices more readily to changes in supply and demand? Are brand names and trust important for homogeneous goods sold on the Internet? Research by Erik Brynjolfsson and Michael Smith (2000a) considers these issues in the context of the markets for books and CDs, both of which are homogeneous goods traded widely\n\n36 Chapter 3 over the Internet. Their comparison of pricing behavior on the Internet and in conventional retail outlets suggests that prices on the Internet are 9–16 percent lower than those in conventional outlets. As more and more people gain access to the Internet, this suggests future difficulties for conventional retailers in terms of their being able compete on price if the substantial differences remain. Jeffery Brown and Austan Goolsbee (2000) conducted similar research, focusing on the market for life assurance policies. Their results show that, for a given set of individual and policy characteristics, a 10 percent increase in the share of individuals in a group using the Internet reduces the average insurance price for the group by up to 5 percent. This is not the case for groups that were not covered by the comparison websites. Brynjolfsson and Smith also find that Internet retailers’ price adjustments are up to 100 times smaller than conventional retailers. The smallest price change on the Internet is $0.01, while for conventional retailers it is $0.35. This implies that lower “menu costs”—the direct costs to the seller of changing their prices (as in the cost of printing new menus for a restaurant)—for Internet retailers may allow them to adjust their prices more efficiently in response to changes in supply and demand. In terms of price dispersion, there is evidence of substantial and systematic differences in prices across retailers. Prices on the Internet vary by an average of 33 percent for books and 25 percent for CDs, suggesting a great deal of dispersion despite the ease of consumer comparison. But when the prices are adjusted to take account of the market share of different online retailers, it seems that price dispersion is actually lower in Internet channels than in conventional ones. This reflects the dominance of certain heavily branded retailers such as Amazon and CDnow. While price is an important determinant of customer choice, a second study by Brynjolfsson and Smith (2000b) indicates that, even among ShopBot consumers who can readily compare prices, branded retailers and those websites that consumers have visited before hold significant price advantages in headto-head price comparisons. Such retailers have a significant advantage over their competitors in this setting. As an example, Amazon has a 5 percent margin advantage over unbranded retailers and a 6.8 percent margin advantage among repeat visitors. In other words, repeat visitors are willing to pay up to 6.8\n\nE-commerce for Consumers 37 percent more before they consider switching to another seller. Brynjolfsson and Smith conclude that consumers use brand as an indicator of a retailer’s credibility, especially with regard to the aspects of a product that are difficult to specify in a contract, such as shipping time. So economic research provides some support for the hypothesis that the Internet is a more efficient market in terms of price levels and menu costs. But the evidence of price dispersion suggests that retailer heterogeneity with respect to such factors as branding, awareness and trust remain important factors to understanding Internet markets. Doubts about falling prices Two points cast doubts on the argument that ShopBots will cause prices to fall. • First, sellers can block their sites from being interrogated by ShopBots. • Second, sellers can also use these shopping bots to regularly check each other’s prices. This in turn can be used to maintain tacit price collusion, allowing sellers to charge high prices. In most examples of ShopBot technology, not only can retailers block their sites from interrogation, but they actually have to register—and, in many cases, pay—to be searched. So why would a retailer pay to be forced into cut-throat price competition? Indeed, it is worth considering the incentives of the ShopBot websites themselves, by asking how they make (or intend to make) profits. None of the companies charge consumers for using their services. Most of them charge sellers to be listed on their comparison shopping engine service, and many have arrangements with retailers to display their goods in a search. So the results given by the ShopBot are often biased toward retailers having agreements with the site. Since participation is a choice, there are clear incentives for sellers to avoid direct price competition. In other words, by registering with a ShopBot site, the retailer is sending a signal to its competitors that it does not intend to cut prices. Furthermore, since retailers too can find out what prices their rivals are charging, they can respond more effectively to each other’s pricing strategy, and this may actually enable them to sustain higher prices. The intuition is that it will now be more\n\n38 Chapter 3 difficult for sellers to secretly undercut one another so that every price cut could “trigger” a “punishment”, for example by an all out price war. This threat can sometimes be sufficient to deter any seller from cutting prices. Repeated interactions and trigger strategies In Bertrand’s analysis, retailers cannot react to each other’s pricing strategy. What happens today is of no consequence tomorrow, for the simple reason that in this model there is no tomorrow (i.e., the Bertrand model is a “one shot” game). In reality, of course, most interactions between retailers are not limited to a single transaction. But if interactions between sellers are repeated, then this should form part of the analysis. So how can Bertrand be extended to deal with repeated interactions, and what implications does this have for consumer e-commerce? Bertrand illustrates the incentives of retailers to undercut one another by charging a price that equals marginal cost. The analysis has a unique equilibrium where both sellers charge prices equal to marginal cost and make zero profits. But if sellers could somehow agree to charge higher prices, then they would all stand to make positive profits. For example, if sellers could agree to set their prices equal to the monopoly price, then they would split the demand between them and make high profits. (If there are only a few sellers, then these profits will indeed be substantial.) But in the Bertrand model, such an outcome, however desirable for sellers, cannot be reached. Even if sellers decide to collude, each one has an incentive to cheat by setting its price slightly below its opponent’s price and winning the whole demand. But what happens if sellers interact more than once? Perhaps they would choose not to undercut their opponent’s price today because of the consequences of this on tomorrow’s profits? It turns out that, even if these interactions are repeated a finite number of times, collusive behavior remains an unlikely outcome: in the final period, there will be no tomorrow to think of, and so the sellers’ incentives are just as in the original Bertrand analysis. Consider now what would happen in the penultimate round. Sellers know that in the next (and final) stage everyone will charge a price equal to marginal cost, and so there are no incentives to collude today. Because whatever they do today will not be rewarded tomorrow, they may as well pick the rational one-off strategy, which is to set the price equal\n\nE-commerce for Consumers 39 to marginal costs. Therefore rationality requires that, in the round before last, sellers charge prices equal to marginal cost and make zero profits. It is easy to see that the same reasoning implies p = c in the round before the penultimate round, and continuing right back to the first round. So, even if the game is repeated a finite number of times, Bertrand’s conclusion remains valid. But if there is no final period, then this type of backward reasoning does not work. And in reality, there is no reason why there should be a known last period. Sellers could exist forever; at any rate, the date when they might cease to exist is unknown. It turns out that if the interactions are repeated infinitely—or even if they are repeated a finite number of times but the last period is not known in advance—then collusion is a possible outcome. A pricing strategy in the infinitely repeated Bertrand model is an infinite list of prices (one for each period). These prices can depend on the prices set by other sellers in previous periods. For example: “Start by setting the price to the monopoly price, continue by setting your price at period t to the price set by your competitors in period t–1”, and so on. Collusion pricing can be achieved using what is known as a trigger strategy: “Start by setting the collusive price and continue with it forever unless the other seller undercuts you. If they do, switch to p = c forever”. It is easy to see that if one of the sellers uses such a trigger strategy, then the others are better off cooperating throughout the repeated game. Moreover, through a more formal analysis (which is beyond the scope of this chapter) it is possible to show that trigger strategies are the best response to each other. That is, if your competitor is using a trigger strategy, then it is also your best strategy. So a situation where both firms are using trigger strategies to determine their prices is a Nash equilibrium of the infinitely repeated Bertrand model. And if both firms are using trigger strategies, the threat of punishment is sufficient to deter price competition—firms will continuously charge consumers the monopoly price. If repeated interactions take place, therefore, it is possible for retailers to charge equilibrium prices above marginal costs. But to do so, they must be able to punish undercutting (if punishment is not possible, then the incentives to undercut remain), and to do that they need to monitor the pricing behavior of their competitors. ShopBots allow easy access to the current and updated prices of the competition, making secret under-\n\n40 Chapter 3 cutting more difficult and increasing the effectiveness of trigger strategies. ShopBots can therefore affect the prices of homogeneous goods in two opposing ways: • ShopBots reduce search costs for consumers and consequently put pressure on sellers to reduce prices. • ShopBots increase price transparency, which increases the incentives for retailers to use trigger strategies, resulting in higher prices. Recently a number of economic models have been put forward, which seek to formalize these features of price dispersion in markets for homogeneous goods with ShopBots. Most notably, Michael Baye and John Morgan (2001) show that ShopBots 3 will—in the equilibrium of their model—charge firms high prices, resulting in partial participation. Another interesting model, by Ganesh Iyer and Amit Pazgal (2002) focuses on the pricing decisions of firms selling homogeneous goods using both ShopBots and other channels. Their model does well in explaining a large set of data on the pricing of books, CDs and videos using seven leading ShopBots and comparing with prices elsewhere. INDIVIDUALLY TAILORED PRODUCTS AND PRICES: THE ECONOMICS OF PERSONALIZATION Bertrand’s approach to competition can also be extended to examine situations where sellers can differentiate their offerings. This framework, based on economic analysis first developed by Harold Hotelling (1929), can be used to examine the implications of personalization technologies. In particular, it makes it possible to understand first degree price discrimination—the ability of firms to charge individually tailored prices—and to explore the joint economic impact of individual pricing and mass customization. Product differentiation The Bertrand result is based on the assumption that the only attribute that matters to consumers is price. But, even for homogeneous goods such as CDs and books, retailers can create brand loyalty through advertising, quality of service and so on. Retailers who are successful in creating such loyalty are then able to raise their prices slightly above those of their 3\n\nOr “Information Gatekeepers”, as they call them.\n\nE-commerce for Consumers 41 unbranded competitor, in the expectation that not all customers will switch to the cheaper retailer. In these circumstances, the logic behind the Bertrand result will not hold. If retailers manage to differentiate themselves, then it is possible that in equilibrium they are able to charge prices higher than unit costs, and consequently to make positive profits. How much profit exactly will depend on the degree of product differentiation. As a general rule, the more sellers differentiate their products, the higher their equilibrium profits. Hotelling’s analysis extends Bertrand’s by allowing firms to differentiate. It also provides a useful framework with which to study the effects of personalization technologies. Hotelling’s basic analysis works like this: two retailers, A and B, selling identical goods are located at either end of a line of length L > 1 (figure 3.1). L represents the degree of differentiation between the two sellers: the larger it is, the more differentiation there is (for example, through brand loyalty). Each consumer can be “located” along the line according to her degree of loyalty to the products sold by A and B. A consumer who is very loyal to A is located near to A, whereas a consumer who is not particularly loyal to either products is located in the middle of the line, "
