        "text": "What you want to use is called \"masquerading\" in the 'sendmail' terminology. This should not be confused with IP Masquerading (which everyone outside of the Linux world calls \"NAT\" -- network address translation).\n\nThe other think you'll want to use is to use M-x customize or M-x edit-options (in emacs) to customize/override the e-mail address that emacs' mail readers (RMAIL VM mh-e -- whichever) will put in its headers).\n\n--Jim\n\nREALBIOS?\n\nFrom: Bill Dawson\n\nLinux Wizard,\n\nI am a newbie to Linux, and it has been a rocky start. Through a series of trial and error I discovered I needed to use loadlin to get started. When I ran loadlin I got this message:\n\n\"Your current configuration needs interception of \"setup.S,\" but the setup-code in your image is *very* old (or wrong) Please use BIOSINTV/ REALBIOS or try another image file\"\n\nI looked at the reference on your page to REALBIOS, but it did not tell me where to find this program. Could you tell me where to get it and how to use it, please?\n\nThis happens when you have a memory manager, a disk manager, or any sort of TSR or device driver that \"hooks\" into your BIOS controlled interrupt vectors prior to running LOADLIN.\n\nShort Answer:\n\n-------------\n\nLook for the loadlin.tar.gz package -- it should include that. Here's the URL for the copy of that on sunsite:\n\nhttp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/slackware/slakware/a4/loadlin.tgz\n\nIn this file there should be a copy of a program called REALBIOS.EXE which you would run as I've described before. It would create a special \"system/hidden\" file in the root of your C:\\ drive -- which allows LOADLIN to find all the ROM handlers for each of your hardware interrupts.\n\nOne way you might avoid the problem is to invoke LOADLIN from your CONFIG.SYS. You can do that by invoking LOADLIN.EXE from a SHELL= directive in your CONFIG.SYS.\n\nIf you're using a version of MS-DOS later than 5.0 you can create a menu of boot options pretty easily -- see your MS-DOS/Windows '95 manuals for real details. Heres a trivial example:\n\nrem CONFIG.SYS menuitem WIN menuitem LINUX menudefault LINUX [WINDOWS] FILES=64 BUFFERS=32 [LINUX] rem Load my 2.0.30 Linux kernel SHELL=C:\\LINUX\\LOADLIN.EXE C:\\LINUX\\L2030.K root=/dev/hdc1\n\nA bit of Background:\n\n--------------------\n\nPC Interrupt's are similar to Unix signals or Macintosh \"traps.\" They are a table of pointers (in the first 4K of RAM) to \"handlers\" (routines that process verious sorts of events -- like characters coming in from the keyboard, handshaking signals from modems or printers, or data-ready events from disk drives). Normally, under MS-DOS, many of these events are handled by the BIOS. Others are handled by DOS device drivers. Still others aren't assigned to hardware events at all. In fact most of the interrupts are reserved for \"service routines\" (similar to Unix \"system calls\").\n\nLinux doesn't use any of these routines. Your system's BIOS is a set of machine language routines written for the processor's \"real mode.\" All x86 processor start in real mode. Every processor since the 286 has had a \"protected\" mode -- which is where all of the cool extended memory addressing and other features are implemented (actually the 286 only supported 24-bit addressing -- but it's not supported by any modern operating protected mode OS, the obscure 80186 was never used as the core processor).\n\nSo, your kernel has to shift from \"real mode\" to \"protected mode.\" It also has to provide low level device drivers for any device you want to access -- where it uses I/O port and DMA channels to talk to the devices. The problem is that something from real mode must load the Linux kernel.\n\nLILO and LOADLIN.EXE:\n\n---------------------\n\nThe two common ways to load a Linux kernel into memory are: LILO and LOADLIN.EXE.\n\nOn any PC hard disk there is a \"partition table\" which is how multiple operating systems can share the same disk. This was necessary because the early design o fthe PC made it very difficult to swap drives. (Using the sorts of external SCSI drives that are common on other systems -- and any sort of OpenBoot or other PROM \"monitor/debugger\" -- makes it pretty easy to connect external drives with alternative OS' on them -- but that would have been far too expensive for the early PC XT's (the first PC's to offer hard drives).\n\nThroughout most of the history of the PC architecture the BIOS for most machines could only see two hard drives -- any additional hard drives required additional drivers. Furthermore these two drives had to be on a single controller -- so you couldn't mix and match (without resorting to software drivers).\n\nWorse than that -- there were no standard drivers -- each manufacturer had to write their own -- and none of them followed an particular conventions.\n\nNone of this matters to us, once we get the Linux kernel loaded, because Linux will recognize as many drives and devices as you attach to it (assuming you compile in the drivers or load their modules).\n\nHowever, it does matter *until* we get our kernel loaded. With LILO this basically requires that we have our kernel somewhere where the BIOS can reliably find it from real mode. With LOADLIN we have a bit more flexibility -- since we can put the kernel anywhere where DOS can find it (after any of those funky drivers is loaded).\n\nThe partition table is a small block of data at the end of the master boot record (the MBR). It's about 40 bytes long and has enough for 4 entries. These are your \"primary\" partitions. One of them may be marked \"active\" that is will be the partition that is \"booted\" by default. One of the partitions may be an \"extended\" partition -- which is a pointer to another partition table on the same hard disk. The rest of the MBR (512 bytes total) which precedes the partition table is a section of real mode machine code called the 'boot loader'.\n\nLILO can replace the MBR boot code (or it can be in the \"logical boot record\" -- which is like the \"superblock\" in Unix terminology -- it can also be placed in the boot sector of a floppy. If LILO is placed in \"logical boot record\" of a Linux partition -- then the DOS (or NT, or OS/2 or whatever) code must be set to load it (usually by setting that partition -- with LILO in it -- as the \"active\" partition).\n\nWith LOADLIN all of this is moot. You just boot DOS (or Win '95 in \"command prompt\" mode -- using {F8} during the boot sequence or whatever) -- or you can use the mult-boot configuration I described earlier.\n\nOne of the funny things about Linux is how many different ways you can load it. You can even shove a Linux kernel unto a floppy (using the dd command) and boot it that way (though you don't get any chance to pass it any parameters that way -- as you do with LOADLIN and LILO).\n\nLast Notes:\n\n-----------\n\nThings are improving in the PC world. We no have some SCSI and EIDE controllers that can boot off of specially formatted CD-ROM disks (meaning we can use a full featured system for our rescue media, rather than and to scrimp and fight to get what we need onto one or two floppies). Most new systems come with at least EIDE -- giving us support for four devices rather than just two. (That's especially important when you want to share a system with a couple of OS and you want to have a CD-ROM drive). Any decent system comes with SCSI -- and most PCI SCSI controllers support 15 devices, rather than the traditional limit of seven. There are \"removable bay\" and drive adapters for IDE and SCSI -- so having an extra \"cold spare\" hard drive is pretty simple (and with SCSI we can have external drives again).\n\nConclusion:\n\n-----------\n\nThere are still many cases where we need to use LOADLIN.EXE rather than LILO. I personally recommend that anyone that has DOS installed on their system make a LINUX directory somewhere and toss a copy of LOADLIN.EXE and their favorite kernel(s) in there. This makes an effective \"alternative boot\" sequence of your partition tables\n\n--Jim\n\nX-Windows Libraries\n\nDate: Sun, 21 Sep 1997 14:06:26 -0700\n\nFrom:\n\nAlthough I did not get any response from you, I want to follow up with what I have found in the hopes that it may benefit someone along the way.\n\nSorry. The volume of my mail and the nature of my expertise (that is the fact that I don't know much about X Windows -- meaning I have to research anything I'm thinking of saying), means that there are sometimes unfortunate delays in my responses.\n\nBy the beginning of next year I hope to entirely revamp the way we do \"The Answer Guy\" (it will hopefully become \"The Answer Gang\").\n\nThis is about the problem of the X-Windows System not coming up but instead gives messages to the effect that it couldn't map the libraries.\n\nIn the process of our playing around, on occasion it would give a message about being out of memory. This puzzled us in that it was not consistent and appeared in a small percentage of the cases. However, on that clue, I found that the swap entry was missing from '/etc/fstab'. I manually turned on swapping and now the X-Windows System comes up and runs normally.\n\nAfter adding the entry to '/etc/fstab', the whole system comes up and plays as it should. All I can say is that somewhere in the process of trying to get the system back on the air, the entry got removed!\n\nAlthough you were not directly involved in the solution, I'd like to say, \"Thanks for being there!\"\n\nI'm glad that worked. I'll try remember that next time a similar probl em comes up.\n\nTo the extent that I have \"been there\" you're welcome. As with most of the contributors to Linux I must balance my participation against my paying work. Naturally my contributions are far less significant than those of our illustrious programmers -- bit I hope to help anyway.\n\n--Jim\n\nPC Emulation\n\nDate: Sat, 20 Sep 1997 13:07:56 -0700\n\nFrom: SAFA ISAA\n\nHi Im working in comp. named Fordons Data our databas is a UNIX RS/6000.and we use aprogram calld Reflection to emulte pc so we can use the\n\nThat would be the WRQ Reflections to emulate a 3270 or 5150/5250 IBM terminal.\n\npc=B4s as aterminal.We use ethernet withe TCP/IP protcol=20 for com.betwen RS and PC .In pc we use win95.My q. is can we use doslinux or minilinux to com. withe rs instade of Reflection ??\n\nYou could install DOSLinux or MiniLinux and a copy of tn3270 and it *might* be able to talk to your RS/6000 (AIX) applications.\n\nThe problem is that the 3270 and 5150 terminals are very complex -- more of a client/server hardware than a \"terminal/host.\" Essentially the IBM mainframes and mini's download whole forms to the \"terminal\" and the \"terminal\" then handles all sorts of the processing on its own.\n\ntn3270 just implements a bare minimum subset of the 3270 protocols (just the weird EBCDIC character set so far as I know).\n\nFrankly I don't know how this relates to your RS/6000 AIX system. That should be able to accept standard telnet and terminal connections. The question be becomes: \"Can your database application (frontends) handle this sort of connection?\" Does it provide a curses or tty interface?\n\nIf the answer is YES would U tell me where can I gat and how to test it..We R the bigest comp. in skandinavin for adm the hole car sys THX\n\nThis looks pretty mangled. The answer is \"I don't know.\" However, Linux has the virtual of being free -- so there's very low risk in setting up a copy and trying it.\n\nThe more fundamental question is: What are you trying to accomplish? If you currently use Win '95 and Reflections why do you want to switch?\n\nDo you want to save money?\n\nWhile Win '95 and Reflections are commercial packages -- they aren't terribly expensive. Your administrative and personnel training costs are presumably much higher.\n\nIs is for administrative flexibility?\n\nThe number one complaint about MS Windows products by Unix sysadmins (based on my attendance at LISA, USENIX, and similar events) is that MS products are difficult to administer -- and largely impossible to administer remotely or in any automated way.\n\nUnix admins are spoiled by rlogin, rcp, rdist, and the fact that almost *anything* under Unix can be scripted. Most jobs are amenable to shell or perl scripts run via rlogin or cron -- and some of the \"tough\" jobs require expect (or the perl comm.pl) to \"overcome those fits of interactivity.\"\n\nMouse driven interfaces with \"floating\" windows and dialog boxes are not \"automation friendly\" and MS Windows is particularly unfriendly in this regard. (MacOS has an Applescript and a popular third-party utility called QuickKeys (sp) that reduce its deficiencies in this area).\n\nSo, if you're considering switching from Win '95 to Linux so that you can centrally administer your client desktops -- it's probably not quite a compelling reason.\n\nI could go on and on. The point is that you have to make a good business case for making this switch. Is there some Linux application that you intend to deploy? Is this suggested by your security needs? What are the requirements of you database applications? Could you migrate those to use \"thin clients\" (HTML/CGI forms) through a web (intranet) gateway? Could you implement the client on Java?\n\nAs for DOSLinux and MiniLinux specifically: Those can be pretty hard to find. I've sent e-mail to Kent Robotti, the creator of the DOSLinux distribution, to ask where it's run off to.\n\nThere are some other small Linux distributions that are suitable for installation into a DOS directory and able to be run off of the UMSDOS filesystem mount on '/' (root).\n\nMini-Linux is pretty old (1.2.x kernel) and doesn't appear to be currently maintained.\n\nI'd look at Sunsite's distibutions directory --\n\nhttp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/\n\nNormally there would be a doslinux directory thereunder -- but Kent seems to change things pretty rapidly and it may be that this as been removed while he's doing another upgrade or release.\n\nIt may be that you best bet would be the \"Monkey\" distribution (there's a directory under the URL above for that). This seems to be a five diskette base set in a set of split ARJ (Jung Archive) files. This seems to have been put together by Milan Kerslager of Czechloslovakia (CZ). There are about nine add-on \"packages\" that are ready to roll with it.\n\nThis is pretty recent (last March) package -- and one of the packages for it is a 2.0.30 kernel from the end of April.\n\nA copy of ARJ.EXE doesn't seem to be included, so you'd have to grab that from someplace like:\n\nSimtel: arj250a.exe -- Robert Jung's Archiver\n\nftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtelnet/msdos/arcers/arj250a.exe\n\n* (for those who don't know Simtel used to be at the White Sands Missile Range on an old TOPS system. It's primary mirror used to be at oak.oakland.edu -- and it's now hosted by Walnut Creek CD-ROM (ftp.cdrom.com). If you need any sort of DOS shareware or freeware (perhaps to run under dosemu or Caldera's OpenDOS) this is the definitive collection. If you need any significant number of packages (like you need to test/evaluate a dozen of them to decide which works for you) I'd suggest springing for the CD. Another invaluable site for any non-MS DOS users is at http://www.freedos.org -- which in proper free software tradition has links to other DOS sites like RxDOS. DOS is truly the OS that wouldn't die -- and the shareware writers have about a decade headstart on ubiquitous availability over Linux).\n\n--Jim\n\nVisual Basic for Linux\n\nDate: Thu, 18 Sep 1997 15:34:08 -0700\n\nFrom: Forzano\n\nI'm looking for a sw that can translate an application developed in Visual Basic to Unix. Could you help me?\n\nThe product you were undoubtedly thinking ofis VBIX by Halcyon Software (http://www.vbix.com). (408-378-9898).\n\nI haven't used this product personally (since I have no interest in Visual BASIC). However they do claim to support Microsoft Visual BASIC source code and they offer some other, related products.\n\nI see a DBIX (which appears to be a database engine with ODBC -- open database connectivity drivers for Linux/Unix and MS Windows '95 and NT). Also interesting might be their \"BASIC 4 Java.\" Here's a blurb from their web pages:\n\n\"Halcyon Software Java Products\n\nInstantBasic Script -Written in 100% Pure Java, Halcyon InstantBasic Script (IBS) is more than just cross-platform BASIC; it is BASIC for the Internet. Moreover, IBS is available as both a compiler and an interpreter, thus allowing developers to execute scripts as either BASIC source code or Java binaries(class file). The engine is compatible with Microsoft's BASIC Script Edition and provides complete Java Beans and ActiveX* support. The engine is easily customizable for quick integration and comes with its own lightweight Interactive Development Environment (IDE).\n\nInstantBasic 4 Java - InstantBasic 4 Java is a 4GL development environment written 100% in Java that allows programmers to quickly and easily migrate their existing VB applications to run under any Java environments using the VB-like IDE.\n\n--Jim\n\nLinux 4.2 software and Hardware compatablity problems\n\nDate: Wed, 17 Sep 1997 20:03:54 -0700\n\nFrom: John Arnold\n\nI purchased a new computer system and 4.2 RedHat Linux Power Tools for my son, Blake, who is a student at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX.\n\nThey were purchased from different vendors.\n\nNeither, Blake, his profs,myself or my vendor knew what we were doing. The result is a big mess. I believe the basic configuration is incorrect. That notwithstanding, I need to know which parts are not supported by Linux and recommended replacements. The following is a brief description of the system:\n\nSupermicro P5MMS motherboard with 430TX chip set. Ultra DMA 33 Mb/s Transfer and 512K pipe line burst mode cache AMD K6 MMX Processor @166 MHz, 6th generation performance, Microsoft certified. 32 MEG SDRAN-10ns-DIMM Memory Western Digital 4.0 Gig IDE hard drive. Split 50/50 by vendor TEAC 1.44 floppy disk drive MATROX MYSTIQUE 4MEG SGRAM PCI Video card 14\" NI SVGA Color monitor by MediaTech, 1024X768-28DPI (I beleive it has a Fixed Frequency) PIONEER 24X CD ROM Drive Keytronics keyboard Microsoft PS2 mouse US Robotics 28.8/33.6 Sportster modem Sound Blaster AWE 64 sound card with speakers Windows 95 & Plus, Service release 2\n\nWhen I have the correct equipment I will find a professional to properly configurer it.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nAll of this equipment is fine. However I have to question your approach. There are several vendors that can ship you a fully configured system with Linux and Windows '95 pre-installed and configured (or just Linux, if you prefer).\n\nIn fact an upcoming issue of the Linux Journal has a hardware review of just such a system: the VAR Station II by VA Research (http://www.varesearch.com).\n\nThis system is very similar to the one you described (using the same video card, keyboard, and sound card and a very similar 24X CDROM). The big difference between the configuration you list and the one I reviewed is that the VAR Station came with a 4Gb SCSI hard drive, a Toshiba SCSI CD-ROM, and a SymBIOS SCSI adapter (in lieu of the IDE equipment you listed). Also the system I reviewed had a 3Com PCI ethernet card rather than any sort of modem (I already have some modem on my LAN). The other thing is that this motherboard is an Intel and uses a 266 Pentium II.\n\nFor about the same as you have spent on these parts separately you could probably get a system from VA Research or several others.\n\nHere's a short list in no particular order:\n\nPromoX (http://www.promox.com)\n\nAspen Systems (http://www.aspsys.com)\n\nLinux Hardware Solutions (http://www.linux-hw.com)\n\nSW Technology (http://www.swt.com)\n\nApache Digital (http://www.apache.com\n\nTelenet Systems Solutions (http://www.tesys.com)\n\n... and that doesn't include the ones that specialize in Alphas or SPARC based systems.\n\nSo, you have many choices for getting system with Linux preconfigured.\n\nNow, if you're stuck with the system you've got, and you just want it all to work, you could pay a consultant to install and configure on the existing hardware. At typical rates of $50 to $150 per hour (mine are usually set at $91/hr) you'd rapidly spend more on this than on getting system from any of these vendors (who presumably have most of the installation and configuraiton process automated).\n\nI cannot, in good conscience, recommend that you hire me to configure a system like this. It's just too expensive that way.\n\nIf you made it clear to your vendor that you intended to run Linux on the system, and they were unable to adequately install and configure it -- I personally think you are fully justified in returning everything and starting over. (If not then yo are still probably within your rights -- and you may still want to consider it).\n\nAnother approach you might try is to get just a hard disk with Linux pre-installed on it. This is the popular LOAD (Linux on a Disk) product from Cosmos Engineering (http://www.cosmoseng.com). This isn't quite a neat as getting the whole box pre-configured -- you still have to tell it what sort of video, sound, and other cards you want it to use (and you have to be able to support the extra drive -- which may be tricky if you have an IDE HD and an IDE CD-ROM drive already on your IDE controller. Many new IDE controller have two \"channels\" (enough to support four IDE devices) and some don't.\n\nAnother approach is to just let Blake fend for himself. He can wander around the campus a bit and look for fellow students who use and understand Linux. Who knows, he may meet some great people that way -- maybe even get a date in the process. Linux is very popular at colleges and universities -- and students are generally pretty enthusiastic about helping one another use any sort of toys -- computers especially.\n\n--Jim\n\nMoving /usr subdirectory to another drive..\n\nDate: Wed, 17 Sep 1997 18:11:32 -0700\n\nFrom: Ben Bullock\n\nMy entire Linux filesystem currently resides on /dev/hda2 and uses up almost 90% of this partition. Because I am quickly running out of disk space on my original hard drive, I recently added a second hard drive and created a Linux partition on it which the system sees as /dev/hdb1. The /usr subdirectory of my filesystem has swollen to over 300MB, so I would like to copy all the directories and files under /usr over to /dev/hdb1 and then edit /etc/fstab so that this partition will then be mounted on /usr in the filesystem when I boot up.\n\nI've given a lot of thought about how to do this, but I am very concerned about making this change because of the potential problems it might cause if not done properly. I would, therefore, appreciate your advice on how to proceed and what steps I should take to safeguard the integrity of my filesystem. BTW, I have a second, unused partition (/dev/hdb2) available on the new drive that could be used to store a \"backup copy\" of all the directories and files currently under /usr on /dev/hda2, and I also have an emergency boot/root floppy disk set that provides basic utilties.\n\nThanks very much for any help you can give me on this. Also, I want you to know that I enjoy your column in the Linux Gaxette and have found it to be very helpful.\n\nRe: my previous columns and articles.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nRe: how to move (migrate) trees full of files:\n\nI can understand you concerns. Under DOS and Windows this sort of operation is hairy, tricky, painful, and often terribly destructive.\n\nThe good news is that Unix is *much* better at this.\n\nHere's the overview:\n\nMount the new filesytem to a temporary location Use a cpio or tar command to copy everything * (optionally) Make all these files \"immutable\" Boot from an alternate partition or a rescue disk Rename the source directory Make a new directory by that name (a mount point) Mount the new fs on the new mount point Update your /etc/fstab to make this permanent * (optionally) Update your tripwire database Test Remove the old tree at your leisure.\n\nThat's all there is to it. Now we'll go back over those steps in greater detail -- with same commands and some commentary.\n\nMount the new filesytem to a temporary location:\n\nI like to use /mnt/tmp for this. So the command is:\n\nmount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/tmp\n\nUse a cpio or tar command to copy everything\n\nI used to use tar for this -- but I've found that cpio is better. So here's the tricky command that's really the core of your question:\n\ncd /usr/ && find . -print0 | cpio -p0vumd /mnt/tmp\n\n* note: must do this as root -- to preserve permissions and ownership!\n\nI realize this is an ugly looking command. However, we'll explain it step by step:\n\ncd /usr/ && -- this cd's to the user directory and (if that goes O.K.) executes the following. If you typed /usr/ wrong you won't end up with a mess.\n\nfind . -print0 -- this provides a list of filenames as \"null terminated strings\" -- this will work *even if some of the files have spaces, newlines, or other dubious characters in them*. The results are written into a pipe -- and the program reading them must be capable of using this list. Luckily the GNU cpio and xargs command have this feature, as we'll see.\n\n| cpio -p0vmd /mnt/tmp -- here's the tricky part. This is the \"passthrough\" mode of cpio. cpio normally copies files \"in\" or \"out\" -- but it can do \"both\" using the \"passthrough\" mode. cpio expects a list of filenames for its standard input (which we are providing with the 'find' command). It then copies the corresponding file \"in\" from the path specified (as part of the input line) and \"out\" to the the path specified as one of cpio's arguments (/mnt/tmp in this case).\n\nThe rest of the switches on this cpio command are: 0 -- expect the input records (lines) to be null terminated, v -- be verbose, m -- preserve the modification time of the files (so your next incremental backup does think that everything under /usr/ has suddenly changed), and d -- make leading directories as needed.\n\nThe last argument to this cpio command is simply the target directory we supply to the -p switch.\n\n* (optionally) Make all these files \"immutable\"\n\nOne obscure feature of Linux' ext2 filesystem that I like to suggest is the \"immutable attribute.\" This prevents *any* change to a given file or directory until the file is made \"mutable\" again. It goes way beyond simply removing write permissions via the standard Unix chmod command.\n\nTo do this use the command:\n\ncd /mnt/tmp && chattr -R +i *\n\n... or (to just do the files and not the directories):\n\nfind /mnt/tmp -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chattr +i\n\nUltimately this protects the sysadmin from his or her own 'rootly' powers. Even 'root' gets an \"operation not permitted\" error on any attempt to modify any feature of an immutable file.\n\nUnder normal circumstances this only marginally improves the system's security (any attackers who get a 'root' shell can just 'chattr' the files back to \"-i\" (mutable), and then have their way with your files). However, with the addition of the \"sysctl securelevel\" features that are expected in the 2.2 kernel (and may already be in the current 2.0 and 2.1 kernels) -- this will actually be a real security feature. (Discussion of \"securelevel\" is for a different article).\n\nThe point is that you can save yourself from many sorts of mistakes by making files immutable. This is particularly handy when running 'make' as root -- when you may have missed some problem in the file that would otherwise wipe out some of your important files. I suspect it's also handy if you get a bogus RPM package -- for basically the same reason.\n\n(Many sysadmin's I've talked to and exchanged mail and news postings with fervently rail about the dangers of running make as root or using any sort of package management system. I understand their concerns but also recognize that the number of new inexperienced SA's -- and the sheer amount of work that many SA's are expected to complete -- practically require us all to take shortcuts and place some trust in some of the packages we're installing. So this \"immutable\" feature is a reasonable compromise).\n\nBoot from an alternate partition or a rescue disk\n\nNow we've done the hard part. All we have to do now is use the new copy of /usr. The only problem is that many of the commands we want to use require access to the shared libraries in /usr/lib. If you ever accidentally remove or damage /usr/lib/libc.so you'll have first hand experience with the problem.\n\nSo, we boot from an alternative boot partition or from a rescue disk, mount our normal root partition and continue. I'll leave out the details on this -- since the details vary from one distribution and site to another.\n\n* Note to distributors and installation script maintainers: PLEASE INCLUDE AN OPTION TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE BOOT PARTITION IN YOUR PRODUCTS\n\nRename the source directory\n\nNow we've copied the whole /usr/ tree to /mnt/tmp. We could just modify the /etc/fstab, and reboot the system. Your rc scripts would blithely mount the new /dev/hdb1 right over the existing /usr -- in effect \"hiding\" the old usr files. However this wouldn't be very useful -- it does free up any disk space.\n\nSo we issue a command like:\n\ncd $NORMALROOT # (wherever you mounted # your normal root filesystem) mv usr usr.old\n\nMake a new directory by that name (a mount point)\n\nNow we need to make a new /usr directory. We just issue the \"mkdir /usr\" command. However -- we're not quite done. We also want to chown and chmod this new directory to match the old one.\n\nSo we use \"ls -ld usr.old\" to see the owner, group, and permissions -- whice are typically like:\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 20 root root 1024 Aug 1 22:10 usr\n\n... and we use the commands:\n\nchown root.root usr chmod 755 usr\n\n... to finish the new mount point.\n\n(Personally I like to make /usr/ owned by root.bin and mode 1775 -- sticky and group writable. However, I also mount the whole thing read-only so I'm not sure this is comparable to any of the FSSTND (the filesystem standard) or the conventions used by any distribution).\n\nI get a bit of confused about how the mount command works -- because it seems that the mount command actually over-rides the underlying ownership and permissions of the mount point. However I have seen problems that only seemed to go away when I make the underlying mount point match my intended permissions -- so I do it without understanding it completely.\n\nMount the new fs on the new mount point\n\nI like to do this just to test things.\n\nUpdate your /etc/fstab to make this permanent\n\nNow you can edit your /etc/fstab (which should actually be under whatever mount point your using during this \"alternative root/rescue\" session)\n\nYou'll add a line like:\n\n/dev/sdb1 /usr ext2 defaults,ro 1 2\n\n... to it.\n\n(Note, I like to mount /usr/ in \"read-only\" mode. this provide one extra layer of protection from the occasional root 'OOOOPS!' It also helps enforce my policy that all new packages are installed under /usr/local, or /usr/local/opt (to which my /opt is a symlink), or under a home directory (which, on some of my systems are under /usr/local/home). The idea of maintaining this policy is that I know what files and packages are not part of the base OS).\n\n* (optionally) Update your tripwire database\n\nTripwire is a program that maintains a detailed database of your files, their permissions, ownership, dates, sizes, and several different checksums and hashes. The intent is to detect modifications to the system -- in particular these would be signs of corruption, or tampering (security breaches or the work of a virus or trojan horse).\n\nI won't go into details here. If you have tripwire installed, you want to update the database and store it back on it's read-only media.\n\nFor more info about tripwire see:\n\nTripwire (ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/COAST/Tripwire)\n\nTo get it to compile cleanly under Linux look at the patch I wrote for it:\n\nTripwire Patch for Linux (http://www.starshine.org/linux/tripwire-linux.patch)\n\n(no .html extension on that -- its just a text file).\n\n(* one of these days I'll get around to writing up a proper web page for Tripwire and for my patch -- I submitted it to Gene and Gene and they never integrated it into their sources).\n\nTest\n\nNow you simply reboot under your normal configuration and test to your hearts content. You haven't removed the old /usr.old yet -- so you can back out of all your changes if anything is broken.\n\nRemove the old tree at your leisure.\n\nWhen you're satisfied that everthing was copied O.K. -- you can simply remove all the old copies using the command:\n\nrm -fr /usr.old\n\nNow you finally have all that extra disk space back.\n\nObviously this process can be done for other parts of your filesystems as well. Luckily any other filesystem (that doesn't include the / (root) and /usr/lib/ trees) is less involved. You shouldn't have to reboot or even switch to single user mode for any other migrations (though it won't hurt to do so).\n\nI like to put /tmp, /var, and /usr/local all on their own filesystems. On news servers I put /var/spool/news on it's own. Here's a typical fstab from one of my systems:\n\n# <device> <mountpoint> <filesystemtype> <options> <dump> <fsckorder> /dev/sdc1 / ext2 defaults 1 1 /dev/sda6 /tmp ext2 defaults 1 2 /dev/sda10 /usr ext2 defaults,ro 1 2 /dev/sda7 /var ext2 defaults 1 3 /dev/sda8 /var/log ext2 defaults 1 3 /dev/sda9 /var/spool ext2 defaults 1 3 /dev/sdb5 /usr/local ext2 defaults 1 3 /proc /proc proc defaults /dev/sda2 none swap sw /dev/fd0 /mnt/a umsdos noauto,rw,user 0 0 /dev/fd1 /mnt/b umsdos noauto,rw,user 0 0 /dev/hda1 /mnt/c umsdos defaults 0 0 /dev/scd1 /mnt/cd iso9660 noauto,ro,user,nodev,nosuid 0 0 /dev/scd0 /mnt/cdwr iso9660 noauto,ro,user,nodev,nosuid 0 0 /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy minix noauto,rw,user,noexec,nodev,nosuid 0 0 /dev/fd0 /mnt/e2floppy ext2 noauto,rw,user,noexec,nodev,nosuid 0 0 /dev/sdd1 /mnt/mo ext2 noauto,rw,user,nodev,nosuid 0 0 /dev/sdd1 /mnt/mo.offline ext2 noauto,rw,user,nodev,nosuid 0 0 /dev/sdd1 /mnt/modos umsdos defaults,noauto 0 0 tau-ceti:/ /mnt/tau-ceti nfs ro\n\nNote all the noauto and user point points. These allow users to access these removable devices without switching to 'root.' To protect against potential problems with the 'mount' command (being SUID 'root') I have it configured with the following ownership and permissions:\n\n-r-sr-x--- 1 root wheel 26116 Jun 3 1996 /bin/mount\n\nThus, only members of the \"wheel\" group are allowed to use the mount command (and I only put a few people in that). So I balance the risk of one of the \"wheel\" members finding and exploiting a bug in 'mount' vs. the expense having to do all mount's myself and risk of my typing *bad things* at the root shell prompt. I could also accomplish the same sorts of things with 'sudo' (and I use that for many other cases).\n\nFor more info about sudo see:\n\nSudo Home Page (http://www.courtesan.com/courtesan/products/sudo/)\n\nFTP sudo: (ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/sysadmin/sudo\n\nI hope that I've done more than answer your question. I hope I've given you some ideas for how to make your system more robust and secure -- how to apply some of the principles of \"best practice\" to administering your Linux box.\n\n--Jim\n\nC++ Integrated Programming Enviroment for X...\n\nDate: Wed, 17 Sep 1997 17:56:30 -0700\n\nFrom:\n\nDear Answer Guy,\n\nI am a student in Information Systems at Kansas State University. As a relatively new user of Liunx, I was wondering if there exists a software package for X which could be comparable to something like Borland's C++ IDE? I've heard of something called Wipeout, but I'm not running Xview, is there anything else that I should check out?\n\nI've never heard of \"Wipeout\" -- but it sounds suspicously like a slurred pronunciation of \"wpe\" -- which would be the \"Window Programming Environment\" by Fred Kruse. This has a console mode (wpe) and an X mode (xwpe) which are just links to the same binary.\n\nI don't know that it requires Xview. Certainly on the rare occasions when I've run it I didn't have to do anything special -- just type the appropriate command for the mode I wanted and it just appears. So, I didn't have to install any special libraries or run a particular window manager or anything silly like that.\n\nt typing 'xwpe &' from any xterm and see if that's already installed for you. If so you can add it to your window manager's menu tree, or to whatever sort of desktop manager or program/applications manager you use (or just always launch if from an xterm -- which is what I do for 90% of the things I run under X).\n\n--Jim\n\nLYNX-DEV new to LYNX\n\nDate: Tue, 16 Sep 1997 22:06:45 -0700\n\nWill I be able to browse the FULL INTERNET using LYNX? I am using LYNX at my job, and the computer does not have window!\n\nThe web is not the FULL INTERNET!\n\nWeb browsers (such as Lynx, Mosaic, Netscape and MSIE) only access the web, ftp, and gopher. These are only a few of the services and protocols supported by the Internet.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"browsing\" the \"full Internet.\" Indeed, the phrase \"full Internet\" is meaningless.\n\nAs to your implicit question:\n\nWill you be able to browse all public web sites using Lynx?\n\n... the answer is no.\n\nLynx is a browser that complies with as much of the HTTP and HTML specifications (the protocols and data representation (file formats) used by the \"web\") as possible -- within the constraints of it various platforms (text only -- no \"inline\" graphics, no sound, no support for \"Java\" or \"JavaScript\" (which aren't part of these specifications anyway).\n\nTherein lies the rub. The client (Lynx) is able -- but many of the servers aren't willing. (In this case, by \"servers\" I'm referring to the people and the sites -- not the software).\n\nBasically there are some sites that are \"unfriendly.\" They make gratuitous use of tables, imagemaps, frames, Java applets, embedded JavaScript, cookies, ActiveX, active server pages (ASP) and ISAPI, and other extensions. They hope to win in some \"one-up-manship\" contest of \"coolness.\"\n\nMost of these extensions were introduced or promoted by one or another company (mostly Microsoft or Netscape) in their efforts to \"capture\" the \"mindshare\" -- which they hope will lead to increased *market*-share for their browsers and \"web developement tools\" (at the expense of standards, interoperability, and -- most especially -- their competitors).\n\nThe \"web development tools\" are the most insidious power piece in this little chess game. These tools (mostly Microsoft's \"FrontPage\") seem to include these non-standard extensions wherever possible -- with no warning, commentary, and mostly with no option to avoid them. Anyone who wants to produce \"clean,\" friendly, standards conformant code is basically reduced to using a bare text editor -- and knowing the syntax inside and out.\n\nIn some particularly notorious cases there are \"active\" or \"dynamic content\" sites that will slam the door shut on your browser just based on a prejudice about it's name. By default your browser identifies itself to the server when fetching pages. Some sites are \"just too cool\" to have any textual content -- and shove a message down your throat:\n\n\"Go get a 'real' browser, punk!\"\n\n... (the sheer effrontery of telling your \"customers\" what sort of vehicle to drive around on the \"stupor hypeway\" -- it simply boggles the mind and gasts the flabber!).\n\nI've even encountered a couple of cases where some \"dynamic sites\" would shove hundreds of kilobytes of \"search engine spam\" to my copy of Lynx. This was a crude effort to seed the databases maintained by Yahoo!, InfoSeek, HotBot, and others with excessively favorable content rating (based on the notion that most of these sites used \"bots\" (web robots, or \"spiders\") that identify themselves as \"Lynx\" (to avoid using the extra bandwidth on graphics that they couldn't use).\n\nThere are also an increasing number of sites that require SSL even for their non-secure information. SSL is a set of encryption protocols which are primarily used to provide for server-authenticated (or mutually authenticated) and \"secure\" (encrypted) access to web forms (mostly for order Pizzas without shouting your credit card number to every router in fifty states and a few countries).\n\nSo, there are a number of places on the \"full Internet\" that you can't adequately or comfortably browse with Lynx.\n\nThe good news is that Lynx does support features to address most of these problems. You can get an SSL proxy (which you'd run on the same machine as you run Lynx), the current versions of Lynx will list all the \"frames\" (which are a Netscape extension for displaying multiple separate HTML files concurrently), and can fetch some sorts of \"map\" files (the text files which describe the \"hot\" (clickable) regions of an IMAGEMAP -- which is a picture with \"clickable\" point therein) -- so you can browse them. Lynx can offer to accept cookies *(see note: cookies) for a given session -- and, eventually, may offer options to save them.\n\nThe bad news, again from the site maintainers and devlopers, is that they often don't provide meaningful names for their frames, or within their image map files. These are intended to be \"seen\" by a site's users -- and often aren't \"seen\" by the site's developers (remember the \"integrated web developer software we mentioned earlier?).\n\nThe final bit of good news is this:\n\n\"Most sites that are particularly \"Lynx-unfriendly\" have not real content. When I succumb to curiosity and view them in a GUI browser -- they are all flash and no substance.\"\n\nWhen we say \"hypertext\" they seem to hear \"hype OR text\"\n\nSo, Lynx acts as a bit of a twit filter. Visit a site first with a text browser (Lynx or emacs' W3 mode) and you'll know immediately whether their webmasters are hard of hearing or whether they \"get it.\"\n\n\"* Cookies are another Netscape extension which are intended to allow web site developers a crude and unreliable way to \"maintain state\" (distinguish between users who might be at the same site -- like all of the AOL, CompuServe, and Netcom users going through their respective gateways). Marketing people drool over statistics based on \"cookies\" which can purport to tell how many *new* and *returning* users there are to a site, *who* read *which* documents other nonsense. However, for those statistics to be even close enough for a marketeer, the use of them must be almost universal (so we stop non-cookies browsers at the front home page) and we have to rely on them being so obscure in the browser software that no one tampers with them (they essentially must be \"sneaky\").\"\n\nPS: I've copied this to my editor at the Linux Gazette -- since I think it's a article for them to consider. Maybe they'll reprint it in \"Websmith\" (a feature of the Linux Journal, which is published by SSC, the maintainers for the Linux Gazette webazine). Interested parties can view all of the back issues of LG the URL in my sig. - -- a site that is emminently \"Lynx Friendly\"\n\n-- Jim\n\nCopyright © 1997, James T. Dennis\n\nPublished in Issue 22 of the Linux Gazette October 1997\n\n\"Linux Gazette...making Linux just a little more fun!\"\n\nSet your browser as wide as you'd like now. I've fixed the Muse to expand to fill the aviailable space! © 1997 by\n\nmuse:\n\nv; to become absorbed in thought\n\nn; [ fr. Any of the nine sister goddesses of learning and the arts in Greek Mythology ]: a source of inspiration\n\nelcome to the Graphics Muse! Why a \"muse\"? Well, except for the sisters aspect, the above definitions are pretty much the way I'd describe my own interest in computer graphics: it keeps me deep in thought and it is a daily source of inspiration. [Graphics Mews] [WebWonderings][Musings] [Resources]\n\nhis column is dedicated to the use, creation, distribution, and discussion of computer graphics tools for Linux systems.\n\nAs expected, two months of material piled up while I was out wondering the far reaches of the US in August. My travels took me to California for SIGGRAPH, Washington DC for vacation (honest), Huntsville Alabama for work (they kind that pays the rent) and just last week I was in Dallas for a wedding. All that plane travel gave me lots of time to ponder just where the Muse has come in the past year and where it should go from here. Mixed with a good dose of reality from SIGGRAPH, I came up with the topics for this month.\n\nFirst, there are two new sections: Reader Mail and Web Wonderings. Reader Mail is an extension of Did You Know and Q and A. I'm getting much more mail now than I did when I first started this column and many of the questions are worthy of passing back to the rest of my readers. I've also gotten many suggestions for topics. I wish I had time to cover them all.\n\nWeb Wonderings is new but may be temporary. I know that many people are reading my column as part of learning how to do Web page graphics. Its hard to deny how important the Web has become or how much more important it will become in the future. I started reading a bit more on JavaScript to see if the language is sufficient to support a dynamically changing version of my Linux Graphics mini-Howto. Well, it is. I'll be working (slowly, no doubt) on converting the LGH to a JavaScript based set of pages. My hope is to make it easier to search for tools of certain types. I can do this with JavaScript, although the database will be psuedo static as an JavaScript array. But it should work and requires no access to a Web server.\n\nReaders with Netscape 3.x or later browsers should notice a lot more color in this column. The Netscape 4.x Page Composer makes it pretty easy to add color to text and tables so I make greater use of color now. Hopefully it will add more than it distracts. We'll see. I may do a review of Netscape 4.x here or maybe for Linux Journal soon. There are some vast improvements to this release of Netscape, although the new reader (known as Collabra Discussions) is not one of them.\n\nIn this months column I'll be covering ...\n\nBrowser detection using JavaScript\n\nSIGGRAPH 97 - what I saw, what I learned\n\nDesigning Multimedia applications for Linux\n\nOh yeah, one other thing: Yes, I know I spelled \"Gandhi\" wrong in the logo used in the September 1997 Linux Gazette. I goofed. I was more worried about getting the quote correct and didn't pay attention to spelling. Well, I fixed it and sent a new version to our new editor, Viki. My apologies to anyone who might have been offended by the misspelling. Note: the logo has been updated at the SSC site. Disclaimer: Before I get too far into this I should note that any of the news items I post in this section are just that - news. Either I happened to run across them via some mailing list I was on, via some Usenet newsgroup, or via email from someone.

It is available from ftp://thumper.moretechnology.com/pub/deltacine.\n\nThis project aims to provide portable C++ source code that implements the system and video layers of the MPEG standard. This first release will interpret MPEG 1 streams, either 11172-1 or raw 11172-2, and render them to an X-Windows display. The project emphasizes correctness and source code readability, so the performance suffers. It cannot maintain synchronized playback on a 166MHz Pentium.\n\nStill, the source code contains many comments about the quality of the implementation and the problems encountered when interpreting the standard. All of the executing code was written from scratch, though there is an IDCT (Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform) implementation adapted from Tom Lane's IJG project that was used during development.\n\nThis is an ALPHA release which means that the software comes with no warranties, expressed or implied. It is being released under the GNU Public License for the edification of the GNU/Linux user community.\n\nLimitations:\n\nRequires ix86\n\nNo playback synchronization. Movies play as fast as the decoder can render the frames.\n\nRequires X-Windows server in 16bpp mode.\n\nFeatures:\n\nFull decode of Part 1 (System) and Part 2 (Video) specification for ISO/IEC 11172. Full implementation except for synchronization.\n\nReference quality output as compared to the Stanford implementation.\n\nUser-mode multi-threading implemented as part of the decoder.\n\nRenderMan Module v0.01 for PERL 5\n\nThis module acts as a Perl5 interface to the Blue Moon Rendering Tools (BMRT) RenderMan-compliant client library, written by Larry Gritz:\n\nhttp://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nThis module requires Perl 5, a C compiler, and BMRT.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nSome extra code has been added to the examples directory that should enable you to convert LightWave objects to RIB or to a Perl script using the RenderMan binding. More useful examples will be provided in future releases.\n\nUpdates will hopefully be uploaded to PAUSE once I am authorized to upload there, and will be posted to my personal home page at:\n\nhttp://www.gmlewis.com/\n\nAUTHOR\n\nGlenn M. Lewis |\n\nSven Neumann released two more GIMP scripts for the megaperls script collection. You can find them as usual at:\n\nhttp://www-public.rz.uni-duesseldorf.de/ ~neumanns/gimp/megaperls\n\nYou'll need to patch the waves-plug-in if you want to use the waves-anim script. The patch was posted a while ago on the list but hasn't made its way into any semi-official release yet. It is also available from the web-site mentioned above.\n\nEd. Note: Please note that the current release of the GIMP is a developers only release and not a public release. If you plan on using it you should be very familiar with software development and C. A public release is expected sometime before the end of the year.\n\nSven Neumann\n\n<>\n\nt1lib-0.3-beta\n\nt1lib is a library for generating character- and string-glyphs from Adobe Type 1 fonts under UNIX. t1lib uses most of the code of the X11 rasterizer donated by IBM to the X11-project. But some disadvantages of the rasterizer being included in X11 have been eliminated. Here are the main features:\n\nt1lib is completely independent of X11 (although the program provided for testing the library needs X11)\n\nfonts are made known to library by means of a font database file at runtime\n\nsearchpaths for all types of input files are configured by means of a configuration file at runtime\n\ncharacters are rastered as they are needed\n\ncharacters and complete strings may be rastered by a simple function call\n\nwhen rastering strings, pairwise kerning information from .afm-files may optionally be taken into account\n\nan interface to ligature-information of afm-files is provided\n\nrotation is supported at arbitrary angles\n\nthere's full support for extending and slanting fonts\n\nnew encoding vectors may be loaded at runtime and fonts may be reencoded using these encoding vectors\n\nantialiasing is implemented using three gray-levels between black and white\n\na logfile may be used for logging runtime error-, warning- and other messages\n\nan interactive test program called \"xglyph\" is included in the distribution. This program allows to test all of the features of the library. It requires X11.\n\nFor X11-users a special set of functions exists which:\n\ndraw directly into X11 drawbles\n\nrespect fore- and background color of the graphics context\n\nprovide opaque and transparent drawing mode\n\nprovide automatic colored antialiasing\n\nAuthor: Rainer Menzner ()\n\nYou can get t1lib by anonymous ftp at:\n\nftp://ftp.neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bocum.de/pub/software/t1lib/t1lib-0.3-beta.tar.gz\n\nAn overview on t1lib including some screenshots of xglyph can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ini/PEOPLE/rmz/t1lib.html\n\nGTK Needs A Logo!\n\nGTK, the GIMP Toolkit (I think, at least thats what it used to stand for) is looking a for a logo. Something that defines the essence of GTK, something that captures its soul and personality. A frozen image of everything that GTK stands for.

It is freely avalible for linux from\n\nhttp://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/ computing/users/aspinr/ra-vec.html\n\nxfpovray 1.2.4\n\nA new release of the graphical interface to the cool ray-tracer POV-Ray called xfpovray is now available. It requires the most recent (test) version of the XForms library (0.87), and supports most of the numerous options of POV-Ray. Hopefully 0.87 will migrate from test release to public release soon.\n\nThis version of xfpovray adds a couple nice features, such as POV-Ray templates to aid in writing scene files. Binary and source RPMs are also available. Since xforms does not come in rpm, you may get a failed dependency error. If you get this, just use the --nodeps option.\n\nYou can view an image of the interface and get the RPMs and source code from\n\nhttp://cspar.uah.edu/~mallozzir/\n\nThere is a link there to the XForms home page if you don't yet have this library installed.\n\nBob Mallozzi <>\n\nWSCG'98 - Call for Papers and Participation\n\nJust a reminder:\n\nThe Sixth International Conference in Central Europe on Computer Graphics and Visualization 98, in cooperation with EUROGRAPHICS and IFIP working group 5.10 on Computer Graphics and Virtual Worlds, will be held in February 9 - 13, 1998 in Plzen at the University of West Bohemia close to PRAGUE, the capital of Czech Republic\n\nInformation for authors: http://wscg.zcu.cz select WSCG'98\n\nContribution deadline: September 30, 1997\n\nivtools 0.5.7\n\nivtools contains, among other things, a set of drawing editors written in C++ for Unix/X11.

Anitroll is a forward kinematic hierarchical based animation system that has some support for some non-kinematic based animation (such as flock of birds, and autonomous cameras). These tools are based upon the Graph library which is full of those neat rendering and animation algorithms that those 3D faqs keep mentioning.\n\nWhy Pixcon & Anitroll? Well, systems like Alias, Renderman, 3DS/3DSMAX, Softimage, Lightwave, etc are too expensive for average users (anywhere from $1000 - $5000 US) and require expensive hardware to get images in a reasonable amount of time. Conventional freeware systems, such as BMRT, Rayshade, and POV are too slow (they're raytracers...). Pixcon & Anitroll is FREE, and doesn't take a long time to render a frame (true, its not real time... but I'm working on it). It also implements some rendering techniques that were presented at Siggraph 96 by Ken Musgrave and was used to generate an animation for Siggraph '95.\n\nThe Pixcon & Anitroll Home page is at: http://www.radix.net/~dunbar/index.html\n\nComments to\n\nAvailabe from: ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/incoming/Linux/pixcon-105.tgz\n\nand will be moved to:\n\nftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/rays/pixcon-105.tgz\n\nGlide 2.4 ported to Linux\n\nGlide version 2.4 has now been ported to Linux and is available free of charge. This library enables Linux users with 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics based cards such as the Orchid Righteous 3D, Diamond Monster 3D, Canopus Pure 3D, Realvision Flash 3D, and Quantum Obsidian to write 3D applications for the cards. The Voodoo Rush is not yet supported. The library is available only in binary form.\n\nTo quote 3Dfx's web page:\n\nGlide is an optimized rasterization library that serves as a software 'micro-layer' to the 3Dfx Voodoo accelerators. With Glide, developers can harness the power of the Voodoo to provide perspective correct, filtered, and MIP mapped textures at real-time frame rates - without having to work directly with hardware registers and memory, enabling faster product development and cleaner code.\n\nAs a separate effort, a module for Mesa is also under development to provide an OpenGL like interface for the Voodoo Graphics cards.\n\nFor more information on Glide please see:\n\nhttp://www.3dfx.com/download/sdk/index.html\n\nFor more download informtion for Glide see:\n\nhttp://www.3dfx.com/download/sdk/index.html\n\nFor more information on Mesa see:\n\nhttp://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html\n\nFor an FAQ on 3Dfx on Linux see:\n\nhttp://www.gamers.org/~bk/xf3D/\n\nFinally, if you need to discuss all this, try the 3Dfx newsgroup:\n\nnews://news.3dfx.com/3dfx.glide.linux\n\nDid You Know?\n\nQ and A\n\nQ: Let me ask a graphic related question: is there a software which converts GIF/JPEG file to transparent GIF/JPEG file? Raju Bathija <>\n\nA: JPEG, to my knowledge, doesn't support transparency. You have to use GIF (or PNG). GIF files can have a transparency added by picking the color you want to be transparent. One of the colors, and only one, can be specified as transparent. You can use xv to pick the color. Then you can use the NetPBM tools to convert the image to a transparent GIF. You would do something like\n\ngiftopnm file.gif | ppmtogif -transparent rgb:ff/ff/ff > newfile.gif\n\nCheck the man page for ppmtogif for how to specify the color to use.\n\nReader Mail\n\nChris Bentzel <> wrote:\n\nAt the end of your gamma correction discussion of graphics muse issue 17, you mention that you were unable to find contact info for Greg Ward.

Perhaps it's because I'm investigating the development of a Linux based Distance Learning platform for for use in my networking classes.Anyway, one of the least expensive resources I've found over time has been the Winnov Videum-AV. An outstanding card but near as I can tell, there are no Linux drivers . I contacted Winnov a while back and they're not interested in Linux at all, but after reading about the efforts of the QuickCam folks I was wondering if you could just mention that the Videum card exists, perhaps simply asking if anyone is working on a driver? (And, no, I don't own stock in Winnov nor know anyone that does.)Perhaps some of the programmers out there are working on something, or maybe Winnov will take the hint. I'm certain that a Videum card on Linux would outperform the same card under NT. Imagine a streaming video service (Either Java based or using the just released 60 stream Real Video Linux server) with a live feed under Linux. Sure wish the folks at Winnov could!Anyway, thanks. The 'Muse has a good balance of technical material and artistic issues. I'll be reading the 'Muse a lot more often, but first...... the back issues!\n\n'Muse: Well? Anyone working on a driver for this?\n\nJim Tom Polk <> http://camalott.com/~jtpolk/ wrote:\n\nReading your column I noticed that you state that you don't know of any animated GIF viewers for Linux. I use xanim. I usually use gifmerge to create the image, and then load up the image and step through it with xanim. I also find it useful to see just how some animations are composed / created. The version I have installed is: XAnim Rev 2.70.6.4 by Mark Podlipec (c) 1991-1997 I only found it out by accident when I loaded an animated GIF by accident (I was clicking on an mpeg file and missed it). You can start/stop/pause. Go forward and backwards one frame at a time, and speed up or slow down the entire sequence. You still have to use another utility to create the GIF, but I use it all the time.Really enjoy your column.\n\n'Muse: I got a number of replies like this. I never tried xanim for animated GIFs. Sure enough, it works. It just goes to show how much this wonderful tool can do.\n\nAlf Stockton <> wrote:\n\nI have a number of JPEGs that I want to add external text to. ie Comments on photographs I have taken with my QV-10 digital camera. Now I don't want the text to appear on the picture. It must appear either next to or below same. So in other words I want to create a large JPEG consisting of some text and my picture. Of course it does not necessarily have to be a JPEG but it must be something that a web browser can display as I intend uploading same to my ISP.The thought was that I would create a HTML document for each image and this would work but now I have a large number of images & I don't want to create an equal amount of HTMLs.\n\n'Muse: I'm a little confused here. Do you want the text visible at all? Or just include the text as unprintable info (like in the header of the image)? If you want the text in the header I'm not sure how to do this. I'm pretty sure it can be done, but I've never messed with it.\n\nIf you want the text visible but not overlapping the original image there are lots of ways to get it done. I highly recommend the GIMP, even though you feel its overkill - once you've learned to use it you'll find it makes life much easier. However, if you just want a shell script to do it you can try some of the NetPBM tools. NetPBM is a whole slew of simple command line programs that do image conversion and manipulations. One of the tools is pnmcat. To use this you'd take two images and convert them to pnm files. For GIFs that would be like\n\ngiftoppm file1.gif > file1.pnm\n\nThen you use pnmcat like this:\n\npnmcat -leftright file1.pnm file2.pnm > final-image.pnm\n\nThis would place the two images side by side. You could then convet this back to a GIF file for placing on the Web page. pnmcat has other options allowing you to stack the images (-topbottom) and specify the way to justify the smaller image if the images are not the same width/height. There is a man page for pnmcat that comes with NetPBM.\n\nNote that the NetPBM tools do not have tools for dealing with JPEG images. However, there are some tools called jpegtoppm and ppmtojpeg available from the JPEG web site (I think). I'm not positive abou that. I don't use these specific tools for dealing with JPEGs.\n\nIf you want, you can always read in the JPEG with xv first and save it as a PPM/PNM (these two formats are essentially the same) file first, then use the NetPBM tools.\n\nJeff Taylor <> wrote:\n\n1) You mentioned [in your review of Megahedron in the September issue of Linux Journal]some difficulty in writing the model information to a file for rendering with an alternative renderer. This is important to me as I would like to use PVMPOV for the final rendering. It wasn't clear from what you wrote, is it difficult to do or impossible?\n\n'Muse: Difficult, but not impossible. I think you can get model information via polygon data (vectors), but you'll have to do the work of getting that out to the file format of interest. I'm no expert, however. I used it only for a little while, to get modestly familiar with it. The best thing to do is write to them and ask the same question. It will get a better answer (one would hope, anyway) and also show that the Linux community is interested in supporting commercial products.\n\n2) Does the modeller allow 2D images to be printed? I'm thinking of CAD type 3-angle-view drawings. I'd like to use it for CAD applications where a model is created and scale drawing can be printed.\n\n'Muse: There isn't a print function for the 2D images, but you can save the images to a file and then print them using some other tool, like xv or the GIMP. The manual has a section on how to save the images. BTW, I'm assuming you mean the images that have been rendered. These images can be saved in RAW or TGA format using functions provided in the SMPL language.\n\nDaniel Weeks <> wrote:\n\nI just want to start of by telling you that you are doing a great job with the Graphic Muse and on the current article in the Linux Jornal on Megahedron. This is where my questions come from.\n\n'Muse: Thanks for the compliments!\n\nFirst, with Megahedron I noticed that it is a progamatic/procedural language for modeling (interestingly enough the language itself is not that dissimilar to our cgiStudio language in structure and function {except for that wierd commenting style}, in fact I already have a perl script that translates most of SPML to cgiStudio :). The question here is does Megahedron have any sort of interface over the demo mode, I guess I mean something like (but it doesn't have to be as fully functional or bloated as) SoftImage or Alias|Wavefront. Second can Megahedron support NURBS patches and deforming geometry.\n\n'Muse: Megahedron is a programming API - actually a scripting API. The CD I got (which is the $99 version they sell from their web pages) wasn't a demo, although it had lots of demos on it. There is no X interface to the language (ie no graphical front end/modeler). I suppose if there was enough interest they'd look into it. Best thing to do is check their web page and get an email address to ask for it. There might be a non-Unix graphical front end, but I didn't check on that. As for Nurbs, there wasn't any mention of support for it on the disk I got. In fact, I don't think I've come across any modellers (or modelling languages) aside from BMRT that has support for NURBS on Linux. But Linux is just beginning to move into this arena anyway, so its just a matter of time.\n\nBTW: for those that don't know it, Blue Sky Studios is the special effects house that is doing, among other things, the special effects for the upcoming Alien Resurrection movie. Yes, it appears Ripley may live forever.\n\nHap Nesbitt <>, of Handmade Software wrote in reply to my review of Image Alchemy:\n\nA very nice review thanks. BTW we do 81 formats now. The new formats are documented in addendum.pdf. The Mews seems quite ambitious. Is this all your work or do you get some help?\n\n'Muse: Its all mine, although I've had a couple of people write articles on two separate occassions. And Larry Gritz offered lots of help when I did the BMRT write ups. I still owe the readers an advanced version of that series.\n\nWe've found a tool for porting Mac libraries to X. Our Mac interface is beautiful and we should get it ported sometime in the next 6 months or so. I'll keep you posted. BTW people don't really buy much Image Alchemy, they buy Image Alchemy PS to RIP PostScript files out to large format inkjet plotters in HP-RTL format. If you give me your mailing address I'll send you a poster done this way. I think you might enjoy it.\n\n'Muse: Sounds great. Thanks for the info Hap!\n\nG. Lee Lewis <> wrote:\n\nYour web pages look really nice.\n\n'Muse: Thanks.\n\nDid you use Linux software to create your web pages?\n\n'Muse: Yes. In fact, thats all I use - Linux. I don't use MS for anything anymore. All the software used to create the graphic images on my pages runs on Linux.\n\nCan you say what you used?.\n\n'Muse: Mostly the GIMP, a Photoshop clone for Unices. \"GIMP\" stand for GNU Image Manipulation Program, but the acronym kinda stinks (IMHO, of course). Its quite a powerful program though. I also use xv quite a bit, along with tools like the NetPBM toolkit (a bunch of little command line programs for doing various image processing tasks), MultiGIF (for creating GIF animations) and Netscape's 4.x Page Composer for creating HTML. I just started using the latter and not all my pages were created with it, but eventually I'll probably switch from doing the HTML by hand (through vi) to only using the Page Composer. For 3D images I use POV-Ray and BMRT. These require a bit more understanding of the technology than a tool like the GIMP, but then 3D is at a different state of development than 2D tools like the GIMP.\n\nWhat flavor of Linux do you like, redhat, debian, etc..??\n\n'Muse: Right now two of my 3 boxes at home are WGS Linux Pro's (which is really a Red Hat 3.x distribution) and one is a Slackware (on my laptop). I like the Red Hat 4.2 distribution, but it lacks support for network installs using the PCMCIA ethernet card I have for my laptop. I plan on upgrading all my systems to the RH4.2 release by the end of the year.\n\nI've not seen the Debian distribution yet. Slackware is also quite good. I liked their \"setup\" tool for creating packages for distribution because it used a simple tar/gzip/shell script combination that was easy to use and easy to diagnose. However, its not a real package management system like RPM. \"Consumers\" (not hackers) will probably appreciate RPM more than \"setup\".\n\nI also use commercial software for Linux when possible. I run Applixware, which I like very much, and Xi Graphics AcceleratedX server instead of the XFree86 servers. The Xi server is much easier to install and supports quite a few more video adapters. However, it doesn't yet support the X Input Extension unfortunately. The latest XFree86 servers do, and thats going to become important over the next year with respect to doing graphics.\n\nWhat do you think of Caldera OpenLinux?\n\n'Muse: I haven't had a chance to look it over. However, I fully support the commercial distributions. I'm an avid supporter of getting Linux-based software onto the shelves of software reseller stores like CompUSA or Egghead Software. Caldera seems the most likely candidate to be able to get that done the quickest. After that, we'll start to see commercial applications on the shelves too. And thats something I'd love to see happen. I did buy the Caldera Network Desktop last year but due to some hardware limitations decided to go back to the Slackware distributions I had then.\n\nOf all the distributions Caldera probably has a better understanding of what it takes to make a \"product\" out of Linux - something beyond just packing the binaries and sticking them on a CD. A successful product will require 3rd party products (ones with full end-user quality, printed documentation and professional support organizations) and strategic alliances to help prevent fragmentation. Fragmentation is part of what hurt the early PC Unix vendors (like Dell and Everex) and what has plagued Unix workstation vendors for years.\n\nSo, in summary, I strongly support the efforts of Caldera, as well as Red Hat, Xi Graphics, and all vendors who strive to productize Linux.\n\n<> wrote:\n\nIs there some documentation available on GIMP - please, please say there is and point me towards it.\n\n'Muse: No, not yet. A couple of books are planned, but nothing has been started officially. No online documentation exists yet. Its a major flaw in free software in general which annoys me to no end, but even in commercial organizations the documentation is usually the last thing to get done.\n\nThere will be a 4 part series on the GIMP in the Linux Journal starting with the November issue. I wrote this series. It is very introductory but should help a little. I also did the cover art for that issue. Let me know what you think!\n\nYou can also grab any Photoshop 3 or Photoshop 4 book that covers the basics for that program. The Toolbox (the main window with all the little icons in it) is nearly exactly the same in both programs (GIMP and Photoshop). Layers work the same (with some minor differences in the way the dialog windows look). I taught myself most of what I know based on \"The Photoshop 3 Wow! Book\" and a couple of others.\n\nBrowser Detection with JavaScript\n\nI recently started reading up on the latest features that will be supported in the upcoming releases of the Netscape and MSIE Web browsers through both the C|Net web site known as Builder.com and another site known as Developer.com. A couple of the more interesting features are Cascading Style Sheets, which you'll often see referred to as CSS, and layers. CSS will allow HTML authors to define more definitive characteristics to their pages. Items such as the font family(Ariel, Helvetica, and so forth), style (normal, italic, oblique), size, and weight can be specified for any text on the page. Browsers will attempt to honor these specifications and if they can't do so they will select appropriate defaults. CSS handles most of the obvious characteristics of text on a page plus adds the ability to position text in absolute or relative terms. You can also clip, overflow, and provide a z-index to the position of the text. The z-index positioning is useful because it provides a means of accesing text and graphics in layers. By specifying increasing values of z to a position setting you can effectively layer items on a page. Builder.com and Developer.com both have examples of these extensions to HTML that are fairly impressive. There is a table of the new CSS features available at http://www.cnet.com/Content/Builder/Authoring/CSS/table.html. You will need Netscape 4.x to view these pages.\n\nCSS is about to make web pages a whole lot more interesting.\n\nThe down side to CSS is that its new. Any new technology has a latency period that must pass before the technology is sufficiently distributed to be useful to the general populace. In other words, the browsers aren't ready yet, or will just be released at the time this goes to print, so adding CSS elements to your pages will pretty much go unnoticed for some time. I would, however, recommend becoming familiar with them if you plan on doing any serious Web page design in the future. In the meantime we still have our JavaScript 1.1 and good ol' HTML 3.0.\n\nOk, enough philosophizing, down to some nitty gritty.\n\nI just updated my GIMP pages to reflect the fact that the 0.54 version is pretty much dead and the 0.99 version is perpetually \"about to become 1.0\". What that means is I've dropped most of my info and simply put up a little gallery with some of the images I've created with the GIMP. Along with the images, including a background image that was created using nothing more than a set of gradients created or modified with the gradient editor in the GIMP, I've added some Javascript code to spice up my navigation menus and a couple of simple animated GIFs. It was probably more fun to do than it is impressive. If you check out these pages you'll find its a little more attractive with Netscape 4.x since I'm using a feature for tables that allows me to specify background images for tables, rows and even individual cells. Netscape 3.x users can still see most of the effects, but a few are lost.\n\nI had added some JavaScript code to the main navigation page of my whole site some time back. I sent email to my brother, who does NT work at Compaq, and a Mac-using friend asking them to take a look at it and see what they thought. It turned out MSIE really disliked that code and the Netscape browser on the Mac didn't handle the image rollers correctly (image rollovers cause one image to be replaced by another due to some user initiated action - we'll talk about those in a future Web Wonderings). Shocking - JavaScript wasn't really cross platform as was first reported. Well, its a new technology too. The solution is to add code to determine if the rest of the code should really execute or not. I needed to add some browser detection code.\n\nThat was .... a year ago? I can't remember, its been so long now. Well, while scanning the CSS and other info recently I ran across a few JavaScript examples that explained exactly how to do this. I now take this moment to share it with my readers. Its pretty basic, so I'll show it first, then explain it. Note: the following columns might be a little hard to read in windows less than about 660 pixels wide. Sorry 'bout that.\n\n<SCRIPT LANGUAGE=\"JavaScript1.1\">\n\n<!-- // Activate Cloaking Device\n\n//***************************************\n\n// Browser Detection - check which browse\n\n// we're working with.\n\n// Based loosely on code from both Tim\n\n// Wallace and the Javascript section of\n\n// www.developer.com.\n\n//***************************************\n\nbrowserName = navigator.appName;\n\nbrowserVersion = parseInt(navigator.appVersion);\n\nbrowserCodeName = navigator.appCodeName;\n\nbrowserUserAgent = navigator.appUserAgent;\n\nbrowserPlatform = navigator.platform;\n\n// Test for Netscape browsers\n\nif ( browserName == \"Netscape\" &&\n\nbrowserVersion >= 4 )\n\nbVer = \"n4\";\n\nif ( browserName == \"Netscape\" &&\n\nbrowserVersion == 3 )\n\nbVer = \"n3\";\n\nif ( browserName == \"Netscape\" &&\n\nbrowserVersion == 2 )\n\nbVer = \"n1\";\n\n// Test for Internet Explorer browsers\n\nif ( browserName == \"Microsoft Internet Explorer\" &&\n\nbrowserVersion == 2 ) bVer = \"e2\";\n\nif ( browserName == \"Microsoft Internet Explorer\" &&\n\nbrowserVersion == 3 ) bVer = \"e3\";\n\nif ( browserName == \"Microsoft Internet Explorer\" &&\n\nbrowserVersion >= 4 ) bVer = \"e4\";\n\n// Deactivate Cloaking -->\n\n</SCRIPT>\n\nThe first line tells browsers that a script is about to follow. The LANGUAGE construct is supposed to signify the scripting language, but is not required. If the LANGUAGE tag is left off browsers are supposed to assume the scripting language to be JAVASCRIPT. The only other language available that I'm aware of currently is VBSCRIPT for MSIE Browsers that do not understand this HTML element simply ignore it. The next line starts the script. All scripts are enclosed in HTML comment structures. By doing this the script can be hidden from browsers that don't understand them (thus the comment on \"cloaking\"). Note that scripts can start and stop anywhere in your HTML document. Most are placed in the <HEAD> block at the top of the page to make debugging a little easier, but thats not required.\n\nComments in scripts use the C++ style comment characters, either single lines prefixed with // or multiple lines that start with /* and end with */. I placed the comments in the example in a purple color for those with browsers that support colored text, just to make them stand out from the real code a little.\n\nThe next five lines grab identification strings from the browser by accessing the navigator object. The first two, which set the browserName and browserVersion variables, are obvious and what you will use most often to identify browsers in your scripts. The appCodeName is \"Mozilla\" for Netscape and may not be set for MSIE. The appUserAgent is generally a combination of the appCodeName and the appVersion, although it doesn't have to be. Often you can use grab this string and parse out the information you are really looking for. The last item, the platform property for the navigator object, was added in Javascript 1.2. Be careful - this code tries to access a property that not all browsers can handle! You may want to embed the browserPlatform assignment inside one of the IF statements below it to be safe.\n\nNow we do some simple tests for the browsers our scripts can support. Note that the tests are fairly simply - we just test the string values that we grabbed for our browserName and browserVersion variables. In the first set of tests we check for Netscape browsers. The second set of tests test for MSIE browsers. We could add code inside these tests to do platform specific things (like special welcome messages for Linux users!) but in practice you'll probably want this particular script to only set a global flag that can be tested later, in other scripts where the real work will be done. Remember - you can have more than one script in a single HTML page and each script has access to variables set in other scripts.\n\nWhy is it important to test for browers versions? Simple - JavaScript is a new technology, introduced in Netscape's 2.0 release of their Navigator browser. Microsoft, despite whining that JavaScript isn't worth supporting, added support for the language in their 3.0 browser. The problem is that each version, for either browser, supports the language to different extents. For example, one popular use of the language is \"image rollovers\". These allow images to change in the display based when the mouse is placed over the image. Various versions of Netscape from 2.0 handled this just fine. The Mac version had a bug in 3.0 that would not clear the original image before updating with the new image. MSIE 2.0 and 3.0 didn't like this bit of JavaScript at all, popping up error windows in protest. Knowing the browser and platform information can help you design your JavaScript to work reasonably well on any platform.\n\nSIGGRAPH 97\n\nUnfortunately I'm not able to bring you my experiences at SIGGRAPH this month. On my trip I took notes in my NEC Versa notebook (running Linux, of course). Unfortunately I left the power supply and power cable in my motel room and by the time I realized it after I returned the motel could not find it. Its probably on some used computer resellers shelves now. Anyway, I just ordered a replacement. I'll have my SIGGRAPH report for you next month. Sorry about that. I am, of course, taking donations to cover the cost of replacement. <grin>\n\nDesigning Multimedia Applications\n\nI recently picked up a copy of Design Graphics from my local computer bookstore. This is a monthly magazine with a very high quality layout that covers many areas of computer graphics in great detail. The magazine is rather pricey, about $9US, but so far has proven to be worth the price. If you are into Graphic Design and/or User Interface Design it might be worth your time and money to check out this magazine.\n\nThe July issue focused on MetaCreations, the company that was created from the merger of MetaTools and Fractal Design. MetaTools founders includeKai Krause, a unique designer and software architect, the man responsible for the bold interfaces found in MetaTools products like Soap and GOO. This issue also included very detailed shots of the interface for Soap. It was while reading this issue and studying the interface for Soap that I realized something basic: Multimedia applications can look like anything you want. You just have to understand a little about how Graphical Interfaces work and a lot about creating graphical images.\n\nGraphical Interfaces are simply programs which provide easily recognizable displays that permit users to interact with the program. These interfaces are event driven, meaning they sit in a loop waiting for an event such as a mouse click or movement and then perform some processing based on that event. There are two common ways to create programs like this. You can use a application programming interface, often referred to as an API, like Motif or OpenGL. Or you can use a scripting interface like HTML with Java/JavaScript or VRML. Which method you choose depends on the applications purpose and target audience.\n\nSo, who is the target audience? My target audience for this column is the multitudes of Linux users who want to do something besides run Web servers. Your target audience will either be Linux/Unix users or anyone with access to a computer no matter what platform they use. In the first case you have a choice: you can use either the API's or you can make use of HTML/VRML and browser technology. If you are looking for cross-platform support you will probably go with browser technology. Note that a third alternative exists - native Java which runs without the help of a browser - but that this is even newer than browser technology. You'll have about a year to wait till Java can be used easily across platforms. Browser technology, although a little shakey in some ways, is already here.\n\nIn order to use an API for your multimedia application you need to choose a widget set. A widget set is the part of the API that handles windowing aspects for you. Motif has a widget set that provides 3D buttons, scrollbars, and menus. Mutlimedia applications have higher demands than this, however. The stock Motif API cannot handle MPEG movies, sound, or even colored bitmaps. It must be used in conjunction with OpenGL, MpegTV's library, the OSS sound interface and the XPM library to provide a full multimedia development environment. The advantage to the API method is control - the tools allow the developer the ability to create applications that are much more sophisticated and visually appealing than with browser based solutions. An API solution, for example, can run in full screen mode without a window manager frame, thus creating the illusion that it is the only application running on the X server. In order to get the effects you see in MetaTool's Soap you will need to create 2D and 3D pixmaps to be used in Motif label and button widgets. If you do this you should turn off the border areas which are used to create Motif's 3D button effects. You will also need to write special callbacks (routines called based on an event which you specify) to swap the pixmaps quickly in order to give the feeling of motion or animation.\n\nEven with the use of 3D pixmaps in Motif you still won't have the interactivity you desire in your multimedia application. To add rotating boxes and other 3D effects with which the user can interact you will need to embed the OpenGL widget, available from the MesaGL package, into your Motif program. By creating a number of OpenGL capable windows you can provide greater 3D interactivity than you can by simply swapping pixmaps in Motif labels and buttons. The drawback here is that you will be required to write the code which registers events within given areas of the OpenGL widget. This is not a simple task, but it is not impossible. Using OpenGL with Motif is a very powerful solution for multimedia applications, but it is not for the faint of heart developer.\n\nUsing browser technology to create a multimedia application is a little different. First, the browser will take care of the event catching for you. You simply need to tell it what part of a page accepts events, which events it should watch for and what to do when that event happens. This is, conceptually, just like using the API method. In reality, using a browser this way is much simpler because the browser provides a layer of abstraction to simplify the whole process. You identify what parts of the page accept input via HTML markup using links, anchors, and forms and then use JavaScript's onEvent style handlers, such as onClick or onMouseOver, to call an event handler. Formatting your application is easier using the HTML markup language than trying to design the interface using the API. You can have non-rectangular regions in imagemaps, for example, that accept user input. API's can also have non-rectangular regions, but HTML only requires a single line of code to specify the region. An API can use hundreds of lines of code.\n\n-Top of next column-\n\nMore Musings...\n\nNo other musings - what? This wasn't enough for you? <grin>\n\nOk, since we know using API's can be complex, and because I'm going to run out of room long before I can cover how to use an API to do a multimedia application, lets look at creating an application using browser technology.\n\nCreating web pages is pretty easy. If you haven't had a chance yet, take a look at Netscape 4.0. It includes a tool called the Page Composer which allows for WYSIWYG creations of web pages. This column was created using Page Composer. Web pages are not enough, of course. We need graphics, animations and sound. Not to mention interaction with files on disk.\n\nGraphics, animations and sound can easily be embedded in a web page with links. Your application will probably need to provide players for any animations or sounds you provide unless you feel really confident users will already have players. For animations on Linux systems, other than animated GIFs which are supported natively in most browsers these days, you can try xanim. Your installation process will have to explain how to install the players. JavaScript does permit you to query what players and plug-ins are available but doesn't appear to give you the ability to automatically launch them without having first registered them with the browser.\n\nSound can be added just like the graphics and animations. You simply have links to the sound files. Not all Linux systems will have sound available. You might want to consider writing a plug-in which checks for the sound devices before trying to play sounds and having this plug-in installed for your sound files. Security issues may prevent a plug-in from opening a device file. You should check the Netscape plug-in API to find out what files you can and cannot open.\n\nYou might be wondering how you can use a browser for a multimedia application on a CD. Don't forget - both MSIE and Netscape allow you to view HTML documents on the native system. On Netscape you can just use something like file:/cdrom/start.html to open up the main page of the application. Any links - sound, graphics, or animations - can be displayed or played when the page is first loaded using JavaScript's onLoad event handler. Graphics, animations, sound and Java applets do not have to be served via a Web server to be viewed or run by the browser. And JavaScript is embedded in the HTML page so it doesn't require a Web server either. As long as you use relative links (relative to the directory where your applications start page is located) your users won't need access to a Web server to use your HTML-based multimedia application.\n\nWell, we've covered just about all the things you'll want to do in your program except how to access files. Security in browsers and with Java has traditionally been rather zealous - the systems were secure by denying all access to your hard drives. Thats still the case even with JavaScript 1.2. There are no real file I/O commands in the JavaScript language. In order to place data in your application you will need to place it all in static arrays embedded in JavaScript code in a page. Fortunately you can place this data in separate files and link to them when the page is loaded. To do this you would use the SRC= attribute of the SCRIPT tag. Netscape 3.0 or later browsers will read this and load the script file as if it were embedded at the SCRIPT tag of the original page. This will not work for pre-3.0 browsers, some of the beta 4.0 browsers or (apparently) any of the MSIE browsers.\n\nThe SCR attribute provides some level of control for maintaining your data files, but it also means your data is in user readable files on the CD. If you use Java applets instead you have the ability to compile this data into an object file but you still don't have access to your file system. It may be possible to read data from files using plug-ins in order to perform some interactive operations but I'm not familiar with the Netscape or MSIE plug-in API's and suspect they also have some measure of security that may prevent this. Reading files seems harmless enough, but there are reasons to disallow this practice. There is a way to get read/write access to the users filesystem from a JavaScript or Java application - certificates. This is a new technology and I'm not that familiar with its use yet. The Official Netscape JavaScript 1.2 Book describes certificates and how to obtain and create them. I suggest taking a look at this book (at the end of chapter 14) if you are interested in this.\n\nAs I reread this article I realize what is so crystal clear in my mind now is probably still a muddy swamp to my readers. Don't fret. I covered a lot of material in a rather short space. What you should do is first pick a method - API or browsers. Then pick one part of that method and start reading all you can about it. Personally, I understand the API methods better since I'm a programmer by trade. The browser technology is interesting in that it provides the User Interface (UI) that is filled in by the developer with images and sound. Abstrasting the UI in this manner is the future of applications but its still in its early days of development. In either case you still need an understanding of what each piece of the puzzle does for you. The API method will give you more control and access to databases without the need for servers (you can embed the database code in the application). The browser method is easier to prototype and develop but has limited access to the system for security reasons. Either method can produce stunning effects, if you understand how all the pieces fit together. And when you look at MetaCreations products, like Soap and GOO, you can see the kinds of effects that are possible.\n\nThe following links are just starting points for finding more information about computer graphics and multimedia in general for Linux systems. If you have some application specific information for me, I'll add them to my other pages or you can contact the maintainer of some other web site. I'll consider adding other general references here, but application or site specific information needs to go into one of the following general references and not listed here.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nNext month:\n\nWeb Wonderings - Adding JavaScript Rollovers to simulate dynamic images\n\nMy SIGGRAPH notes, if I can get my notebook running again.\n\nMaybe a look at libgr, if I have time.\n\nCopyright © 1997, Michael J.
