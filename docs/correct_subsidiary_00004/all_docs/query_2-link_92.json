Jorgensen Co., thought the tough part of a large laptop and sales force automation deployment would be persuading people to go mobile. But the biggest hur¬ dle turned out to be the laptops themselves — a shipment of about 230 Texas Instruments, Inc. Extensa 555 and 560 models. Many of them just didn’t work, he said. “One of the more se¬ rious problems was that you would go to turn on the machine, and it would say, ‘Hard drive error, disk not found,’” McWhirter said. “It’s been incredibly annoying.” He isn’t alone. Users and industry observers have been complaining for months that vendors, in a rush to meet accelerating and unexpect¬ edly high demand, are shipping laptops that haven’t been adequate¬ ly tested. Users also face con¬ figuration problems when their machines are preloaded with out¬ dated software. “My theory is that people are rushing new-generation prod¬ ucts out the door with¬ out spending as much Laptop, page 135 Laptop sales International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass., recently revised its notebook market forecast upward, predicting that 4.7 million notebooks will ship in the U.S. this year, up from 3.5 million iastyear.

Anthes WASHINGTON It may be the most expen¬ sive systems develop¬ ment fiasco in history. Delays in overhauling the federal tax systems are costing the U.S. Treasury as much as $50 billion per year, a Computerworld investigation has found. That figure represents what the federal government could be collecting in additional taxes if the Internal Revenue Service had succeeded in its decade-long attempt to moder¬ nize its 1960s-era computer systems. Now trying for the third time to revamp its tax collec¬ tion systems, the IRS spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on the effort. But crit¬ ics say much of that money is wasted through mismanage¬ ment and primitive develop¬ ment practices. And IRS offi¬ cials concede many of those points. Yet direct expenditures on the IRS’ $8 billion Tax Systems Modernization program pale beside a less-noticed cost: the revenue that might have been. The IRS admits that the lack of progress in developing new automated compliance tools stands in the way of its goal to boost tax collections IRS, page 28 INSIDE ■ The IRS wants more credit for its successes.

In 1995, the IRS: • Collected $1.4 trillion in taxes • Paid out $106 billion in refunds • Handled 2 billion pieces of paper (a stack 200 miles high) • Processed 206 million tax returns • Assisted no million taxpayers by telephone • Spent $25.6 billion overall • Spent $1.6 billion on information systems overall • Spent $622 million on Tax Systems Modernization projects At a meeting last month of the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS, Sen. Bob Kerrey (D- Neb.), center, lambasted the IRS forfaiting to apply the right performance measures to its operations News 1925-1996 “Seymour’s supercom¬ puters allowed [us to find] cures for disease, made air and auto trav¬ el safer, improved our ability to predict and prepare for nature’s worst disasters and ended the Cold War.” — Bo Ewald, president and chief operating officer, Cray Research, Inc., a subsidiary of Sili¬ con Graphics, Inc. kkk “Since 1960, Seymour has given us the recipes for building com¬ puters that will continue well into the 21st century. The regret I feel, beyond his loss, is not being able to see his next machine.” — Gordon Bell, inventor of the VAX minicomputer kkk “Seymour’s philosophy for hiring recent college graduates, peo¬ ple not yet bound by . . . limits . . . gave many young people the opportunity to create and innovate much of today’s technology.” — Larry Ellison, CEO, Oracle Corp. kkk “So many of his ideas have been seminal to almost all computing systems large and small. ... He had an incredible knack for de¬ veloping high-performance systems with slow components. He was a master of architecture.” — Tom Pyke, director of high perfor¬ mance computing and communications, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration kkk “He inspired people aesthetically. His inventions were beautiful — it was not just engineering. He had a certain elegance and in¬ tegrity to his design.” — Danny Hillis, co-founder, Thinking Machines Corp. kkk “Seymour Cray was a visionary in the purest sense, having the ability to conceive new solutions and the courage not to waver from his convictions.” — Scott McNealy, chairman, Sun Microsys¬ tems, Inc. The 5th Wave by Rich Tennant Java top guns seek glory, not gold By Julia King Rumors of Java developers snag¬ ging salaries and signing bonuses of $200,000 and more are just that: rumors. Demand for Java talent is sky- high, but the kind of money most Java developers earn won’t buy them a spot at Millionaire Acres — at least not immediately. More than money, the near- term paybacks are the learning opportunities, adrenaline rush and sense of professional elitism that come with working on some of the industry’s more leading- edge, high-profile projects. Consider the case of Jay Janar- thanan, 25, who took a 50% pay cut to earn $500 per day working on a Java project at Nortel, Inc. in Otta¬ wa. Janarthanan had been a con¬ sultant in New York and Califor¬ nia, earning between $800 and $1,000 per day. ‘The project we are doing at Nortel is putting Java in a cell phone, which is pretty interesting and a highly visible project,” Janarthanan said. “With Java be¬ ing a new technology, there’s a lot of experimentation and things to learn. Being on a project like this lets you do that. And once it’s done, I can actually show people the cell phone.” Hands-on Money also was a secondary consider¬ ation for Chris Lau¬ rel, a 25-year-old Java developer at Di¬ mension X, Inc., a San Francisco-based company that spe¬ cializes in Java-based multimedia software. The firm tapped in to the Inter¬ net to recruit Laurel from his home in Minnesota. “It was very important just to get a project that I could sort of run with on my own and com¬ pletely define from the begin¬ ning,” Laurel said. What he ultimately came up with is Liquid Reality, a Java- based software tool that has become the stan¬ dard for creating three-dimensional pages on the World Wide Web. Yet Java skills alone won’t win developers a coveted spot on leading-edge proj¬ ects, employers said. Far more impor¬ tant are an excellent knowledge of and experience in ob¬ ject-oriented soft¬ ware design. “Java is a programming lan¬ guage, and in that regard, it’s not that big of a deal. But knowing about object-oriented [design], plus Java, makes you very valu¬ able,” said Frank Greco, CEO of Crossroads Technologies, Inc., a systems integrator in New York. Jay Janarthanan enjoys the learning opportuni¬ ties that come with his Java work News Shorts Temps win court ruling The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Ap¬ peals last week ruled that several hundred temporary workers hired by Microsoft Corp. be¬ tween 1987 and 1990 are eligible for 401 (k) and stock purchase benefits, even though they had signed agreements waiving them. Microsoft has until Oct. 24 to ap¬ peal the ruling. If the ruling stands, Microsoft — and virtually any company that employs tempo¬ rary contractors to supplement full-time personnel — could end up paying millions of dollars in back benefits to freelance workers. Microsoft movies Separately, Microsoft announced that it will bundle Microsoft Cam¬ corder, a recorder and playback utility designed to let Office 97 us¬ ers create and distribute audio and video files, with its forthcom¬ ing version of Office 97. Users who receive a stand-alone Cam¬ corder .EXE file can play back the movie screen-capture even if they don’t have Microsoft Camcorder installed on their machine. Health care interface The Andover Working Group, an Andover, Mass.-based coalition of more than 130 technology ven¬ dors and health care companies, has released to its members the first in a series of HL7 specifica¬ tions. HL7, or Health Level 7 En¬ terprise Communication Frame¬ work software, is a set of system interfaces designed to make it easier to transmit text-based data among health care applications. Hewlett-Packard Co. estab¬ lished The Andover Working Group in March.

Cray, the goal was simply stated, if not always easily met: “to make the fastest computers in the world.” And that’s just what he did, start¬ ing in a St. Paul, Minn., glider fac¬ tory in 1951 and ending 45 years lat¬ er in Colorado Springs. Cray, 71, died Oct. 5 from head injuries received in an automobile accident two weeks earlier. To see Cray’s achievements in strictly quantitative terms — the Tribute fastest computers — overlooks the huge contribution he made to a dis¬ cipline he helped create. “Computational science” grapples with the problems that as a practical matter can’t be solved by conven¬ tional computers. For example, it doesn’t do much good to develop a 12-hour weather forecast if it takes 24 hours of com¬ puter time to do it. Seymour Cray didn’t seem to care much about weather forecast¬ ing, petroleum exploration or the design of drugs, cars and nuclear weapons — all of which he influ¬ enced considerably. To him, the name of the game was creating lightning-fast hardware, not appli¬ cations. The amiable but intensely private computer designer was the quintes¬ sential nerd. He once told of how, as an engineering student at the Uni¬ versity of Minnesota, he had been ribbed for using a circular slide rule because nearly everyone else used the “straight stick” kind. Seymour Cray: If you keep try¬ ing, ‘you will occasionally do something worthwhile’ But that willingness to buck con¬ ventional practices was the key to Cray’s success over the years. In a rare interview two years ago, he told Computerworld, “You have to be prepared to fail, and I have failed about half the time, I guess. But you simply have to pick your¬ self up and go at it again with what¬ ever insights you’ve gained from failure. If you do keep trying, you will occasionally do something worthwhile.” His string of successes ended in the early 1990s after he left Cray Re¬ search to start Cray Computer Corp. Believing silicon processors would soon reach their perfor¬ mance limits, Cray cast his lot with the much faster gallium arsenide. But the proces¬ sors were difficult to manufacture, and Cray wasted years and hun¬ dreds of millions of dollars. And the demand for supercomputers plunged in post- Cold War years. Cray said the secret to making computers faster was to make them smaller. He speculated that molecular- size circuits built by biological pro¬ cesses might hold promise for huge improvements in computer perfor¬ mance. “How do we train bacteria to make transistors?” Cray won¬ dered. He wasn’t joking. When asked if he might soon re¬ tire, he said, “That frightens me. I will work as long as I am able.” The work of the legendary com¬ puter designer has come to a tragic end. But we will recall Seymour Cray every time we drive a car, fly in an airplane, take a modern medi¬ cine or dodge a hurricane. ^COMPUTERWORID COME VISIT OUR WEB SITE pummerc© ■ ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE Too busy doing transactions on the ’net to search for information about electronic commerce?

I do have a lot of ahnnt hnm this rnmnanw ran Q While disconnected from the network, users can look up information or do basic tasks such as writing E-mail 0 Changes are replicated to the network database when the connection is restored By Craig Stedman Network computers may not be just for networks after all, if Ora¬ cle Corp. has its way. One of the most fervent of the network computer prophets, Ora¬ cle is developing a network com¬ puter version of its single-user database that would let users do some work while disconnected from the network. But such a move goes against the grain of the network comput¬ ing concept, several users and an¬ alysts said last week. Officials at other companies that are developing thin clients, including IBM, Sun Microsys¬ tems, Inc. and HDS Network Sys¬ tems, Inc., said devices with some disconnected capabilities aren't completely out of the question. But for now, they said, corporate interest in network computers is expected to come from customers who view the devices as the dumb terminals of the 1990s. The network computer release of Personal Oracle Lite should be ready next year, Oracle officials said. End users with such a database could download data and Java app¬ lets to their network computers and do basic processing while dis¬ connected from the network. That would make it conceivable to have mobile or handheld network com¬ puters that would be less expen¬ sive to buy and support than full- fledged laptop computers, ac¬ cording to Oracle’s vision. Michael Anthony Jewelers, Inc. is one prospective user that wants network computers to have as few capabilities as possible beyond the network, said Kalman Shor, assistant director of information services at the Mount Vernon, N.Y., jewelry manufacturer. “The reality of the way we do business sort of dictates that for us,” Shor said. “A lot of the people here aren’t very computer-sawy, and we’re talking about gold bul¬ lion walking into this place and gold jewelry walking out. Even with our data, we want to keep close track of what’s here.” Michael Anthony’s PCs run Windows 3.1 off a server rather than having individual copies, and network devices would replicate that setup “with less cost up front and less of a box to get destroyed in the manufacturing environ¬ ment,” Shor said. The company is considering installing about 100 of IBM’s upcoming Network Station terminals, he said. Other observers said a network computer with a database would also need local storage — which would make it look awfully similar to a PC. “I’m not exactly sure how to dif¬ ferentiate between a mobile [net¬ work computer] and a laptop,” said Frank Tait, a vice president at SCT Education Systems. The Mal¬ vern, Pa., software vendor plans to support network computers and use them internally as re¬ placements for low-end PCs and Macintoshes. A new Windows version of Per¬ sonal Oracle Lite, to be an¬ nounced this week, requires 1M byte of memory and 5M bytes of hard-disk space. Oracle officials said they haven’t decided whether the network computer version of the database would be stored on a disk or an alternative medium such as flash memory. Network devices hot topic at Unix Expo Desktop dilemma By Laura DiDio and Jaikumar Vijayan NEW Y0 RK That old X terminal never did catch on, but at last week’s Unix Expo Plus in New York, attendees were starting to get excited about its direct descendant — a network computer attached to a Unix file server. The idea of low-cost network access devices originated 10 years ago with X terminals, but the concept never went anywhere because potential users were scared off by Unix’s “technical complexity,” said Eileen O’Brien, an analyst at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. But the price advantage of a $500 network device, combined with the scalability, reliability and security of Unix, could make it a viable alternative to PC-based net¬ works in certain situations, users and analysts said. Easy sell “They were an easy sell here,” said Jim Hogan, manager of infor¬ mation systems at Gambro Healthcare, Inc. in Lakewood, Colo., a maker of kidney dialysis machines. Gambro three years ago bought 50 Tektronix, Inc. NetStations with Windows emula¬ tion software to attach to its Hew¬ lett-Packard Co. HP-UX servers. “The total cost was $150,000. If The ups and downs of low- cost network computers attached to Unix servers p 1 Architecturally neutral .- %■ Inexpensive Highly scalable . Zero client administration AT A A No upgrade requirements Better security , Users don’t want to give V A up control of their S| \\ :- VT desktops Lack of stability of Tv/ running Windows mi applications we had opted to buy PCs for all of our engineers, it would have cost $1.5 million,” Hogan said. It also resulted in a “drastic time- savings” for Hogan and his net¬ work administrators because they had to configure only one server. Greg Blatnick, vice president at Zona Research, Inc. in Redwood City, Calif., said Hogan’s experi¬ ence is typical. “Unix vendors are making a very legitimate case. A thin client on the desktop eliminates the need to upgrade systems with ev¬ er-burgeoning amounts of memo¬ ry and storage capacity, which can get very expensive in large environments,” he said. Some large organizations, in¬ cluding Federal Express Corp., R. R. Donnelly & Sons Publishing Corp., Wells Fargo Bank, Bank of America and the University of Washington Medical Center, have either already adopted network computers with their Unix serv¬ ers or are testing them with an eye toward deployment, Blatnick said. Tom Boos, senior vice president at R. R. Donnelly in Chicago, said the firm is building a thin- client, Java-based network that provides “portability across Win¬ dows, Macintosh and OS/2 work¬ stations and applications.” “We’re definitely considering it for some of our sites, though we haven’t made a definite commit¬ ment yet,” said an MIS manager at Federal Express in New York, who requested anonymity. “We have tens of thousands of users, and everyone is screaming for In¬ ternet access, which means we have to upgrade all our desktops. We’d be crazy not to at least look at them.” Other users were hesitant. Rob Young, a software engineer at Vu/Text Library Services, Inc. in Philadelphia, said network com¬ puters require much higher net¬ work bandwidth. Otherwise “the network becomes the bottle¬ neck,” he said. “So instead of paying to main¬ tain PCs, you end up paying through the nose to keep the net¬ work running,” Young said. Save the servers James Garden, an analyst at Tech¬ nology Business Research, Inc. in Hampton, N.H., said users who exchange their fat desktop PCs for thin clients still need fat Unix servers to carry the ap¬ plication load. Still, Garden and Blatnick said the de¬ mand for Internet access could help spur the adoption of thin cli¬ ents. ‘The Web is becoming the cross-platform application deliv¬ ery and access vehicle, especially in legacy environments. Business¬ es could build Web interfaces on top of these applications. This would let users access legacy ap¬ plications via Web browsers using PCs, laptops and thin clients. This trend will certainly support the push toward thin clients,” Garden said. The biggest barrier facing the thin clients, though, could come from end users. “It’s going to be a tough sell convincing users to give up the freedom to control their desktops after so many years,” Blatnick said. Corrections Due to an editing error, the story “Browser rouser” [CW, Aug. 26, page 1] in¬ correctly stated that Intuit, Inc. lost an antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. Rather, Microsoft called off its proposed $2 billion ac¬ quisition of Intuit in May 1995 in the face of what could have been a lengthy antitrust trial with the U.S. Department of Justice. Due to a reporting error, a story on page 28 of Com- puterworld’s Sept. 16 issue about System/390 hard¬ ware and storage subsys¬ tems misstated the capacity available in Ramac 3 disk arrays. It is actually 363G bytes. A story on page 8 of Com- puterworld’s Sept. 23 issue misstated the outsourcing relationship between Pru¬ dential Insurance Company of America and Integrated Systems Solutions Corp. (ISSC). ISSC will maintain the mainframe legacy appli¬ cations now managed by Prudential’s application de¬ velopment offices. Pruden¬ tial will continue to run its data centers. Network computing COMPUTERWORLD OCTOBER 14, 1996 (www.computerworld.com) News Frame-relay users police carriers Mercer Management’s Patrick Brennen says in¬ dependent monitoring tools help him under¬ stand utilization By Patrick Dryden and Kim Girard Frustrated users of frame-relay services are driving carriers to improve the thor¬ oughness and timeliness of reports about these vital links among remote sites. The packet-switching technology pro¬ vides a cost-effective way to carry diverse traffic across wide-area networks through its speed, reduced overhead and flexible subscription levels. But many users complain they can’t tell from the limited or late information provid¬ ed by carriers if they are paying for the ap¬ propriate level of service and provisioning circuits according to users’ needs. Savvy users have sought their own moni¬ toring tools so they wouldn’t have to negoti¬ ate for additional chunks of frame-relay capacity blindly and painfully as their WAN traf¬ fic fluctuates. AT&T Corp., MCI Communi¬ cations Corp. and Sprint Corp. * told Computer- i world they 5 are evaluating E whether to adopt such tools to expand the in¬ formation they provide to cus¬ tomers. And each plans to make usage information accessible via the World Wide Web early next year. “They finally recognized how these tools can help them monitor their service and be more responsive to customers,” said Scott Meyers, network operations manager at Cargill, Inc. in Minneapolis. The agricultural supplier adopted tools for real-time monitoring of its global links. Instead of receiving reports after the fact, Meyers wants to troubleshoot connection problems while on the telephone with re¬ mote sites. And he needs more complete statistics than those carriers provide. “This helps me police the carriers,” Mey¬ ers said. “Now I can make sure AT&T and MCI truly deliver the contracted service.” Another watchdog is Buck Consultants, Inc. The New York-based benefits consult¬ ing firm discovered it had paid for a com¬ mitted information rate but received less capacity, said Clem Bowen, systems pro¬ grammer at the firm. To augment weekly reports from AT&T, Bowen scans circuit usage with more infor¬ mative tools. He said he looks forward to the day when carriers provide “dynamic in¬ formation on circuit usage that I don’t have to download and print.” No carrier has provided adequate infor¬ mation on actual usage, said Tom Reinsel, telecommunications analyst at Eli Lilly and Co. in Indianapolis. ‘We must have a reality check when we purchase lines to know if we’re getting our money’s worth,” Reinsel said. Independent monitoring tools “help me understand utilization in ways that I couldn’t get from the carrier,” said Patrick Brennen, network operations manager at Mercer Management Consulting, Inc. in New York. Reinsel said he can control costs by de¬ tecting underutilized circuits. And when rolling out new applications, he said, he needs to watch for overutilization, which can drag down response time for users. Carriers say there is high demand for better and faster reporting on utilization. But they aren’t sure if users will pay for re¬ ports or tolerate impact on service. Users maneuver to open WAN bottle¬ necks. See page 63. BE A WINNER WITH...

Oracle’s merchant server, code-named Project Apollo, will let companies tap the Internet to sell goods, information and ser¬ vices. It is supported by several Internet application vendors that are developing plug-in modules that use Oracle’s “cartridge” tech¬ nology. Sources said those vendors in¬ clude VeriFone, Inc., which is linking its electronic-payment software to the Oracle merchant server. Millipore Corp., a Bedford, Mass., maker of liquid and gas filtration equip¬ ment, plans to use Ora¬ cle’s technology to let its customers get informa¬ tion — and eventually transact business — via the Internet. Kevin Danehy, manager of workgroup computing at Milli¬ pore, said Oracle has developed some “rather savvy applications” that will open up the company’s price, availability and shipment¬ tracking databases to customers who have World Wide Web browsers. “We want to give our customers the ability to do simplistic things themselves and take that burden off of our sales force,” Danehy said. After an initial test period, Millipore may take advantage of Oracle’s order- entry capabilities that use a drag- and-drop shopping cart interface, he said. Oracle last week declined to comment on the upcoming an¬ nouncement. Industry sources said Project Apollo will ship this quarter. It is expected to support Oracle’s Webserver software with Oracle7 as the back-end database. The merchant server works with Ora¬ cle’s object-based Network Com¬ puting Architecture for connect¬ ing clients to distributed servers and databases, the sources said. Front-end capability Meanwhile, Oracle also will an¬ nounce plans to open up its appli¬ cation suite to access from Java- enabled Web browsers. Any browser-equipped device, includ¬ ing network computers, intelli¬ gent telephones and handheld de¬ vices, will be able to function as an Oracle front end, company offi¬ cials said. The merchant server will put Oracle in heavy competition with Microsoft Corp., Netscape Com¬ munications Corp., IBM and oth¬ er vendors that have already laid out their electronic commerce plans. But industry observers said Or¬ acle’s database technology and market dominance should hold it in good stead. “Oracle is fairly well ahead of the game in understanding what the issues are that custom¬ ers will face as they try to put up electronic commerce sites,” said Ted Julian, an analyst at Inter¬ national Data Corp. in Framing¬ ham, Mass. Electronic commerce Web-hosting services expand By Mitch Wagner Looking for a friendly big buddy to help you cross the information highway? A couple of big companies audi¬ tioned for the role last week. Federal Express Corp. said it will offer electronic commerce services to help its customers sell products that FedEx will then also ship. Earlier, AT&T Corp. an¬ nounced plans to expand its host¬ ing service on the World Wide Web with built-in technology to accept credit-card payments and enhanced ties to companies’ lega¬ cy electronic-mail systems. AT&T and FedEx are among a busload of major vendors that of¬ fer electronic commerce services for Internet-hungry users. For example, IBM recently an¬ nounced Web-hosting services, including payment processing. And MCI Communications Corp. announced a similar program in the spring. Teaming up with a corporate megalith has its advantages over going it alone or working with a smaller vendor, said Chris Pizey, webmaster at Universal Press Syndicate in Kansas City, Mo. Universal Press uses MCI to host its Web site (www.uexpress.com). Big advantages A big vendor can offer access to services, technology and high- bandwidth connections that a smaller vendor would have diffi¬ culty matching. “Being part of a bigger picture has been better for us,” Pizey said. The FedEx offer may solve some of the major problems con¬ sumer companies have had get¬ ting on the Internet — problems that have nothing to do with tech¬ nology. Many retail companies that de¬ pend on brick-and-mortar stores don’t have a fulfillment system to take orders remotely and then ship a product to a customer. Cat¬ alog companies on the Web, such as Lands’ End, Inc., don’t face that problem. FedEx will set up a company’s Web catalog and run it on a Web server located at FedEx head¬ quarters in Memphis. The com¬ pany will also handle shipments — either by maintaining an inven- By Kim Girard Lucent Technologies, Inc., with its pending acquisition of LAN switch maker Agile Networks, Inc., aims to shed its image as a private branch exchange supplier tory of items at a FedEx ware¬ house or by linking to a server that FedEx will install at the cor¬ porate customer’s warehouses. The FedEx server will address and print out a shipping label for the corporate customer. The FedEx service is sched¬ uled to be available in the first half of next year. Pricing hasn’t been determined, although FedEx offi¬ cials said the company probably won’t charge a monthly service fee, just a setup cost and a per¬ centage of sales royalties. ■fV AT&T expands digital cellular phone service.

Lucent first moved in July to boost its profile as a network pro¬ vider by signing an agreement un¬ der which it would resell equip¬ ment from Bay Networks, Inc. Lucent uses Bay’s routing soft¬ ware in its own products and re¬ sells its switching and network management software. Wally Knapp, director of com¬ puter services at Catonsville Col¬ lege in Catonsville, Md., said he was skeptical about Lucent’s pros¬ pects as a full-service vendor. Lucent “tried it all before” as a part of AT&T with NCR Corp. computers and Paradyne net¬ working gear, said Knapp, a Bay Networks user. “Simply because they have the wires and boxes doesn’t mean anything at all,” he said. Lucent is buying Agile, a pri¬ vately held LAN switch maker in Boxboro, Mass., that has 60 employees, for its virtual LAN (VLAN) software and Asynchro¬ nous Transfer Mode technology, said Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Archi¬ tects, Inc., a consulting firm in Washington. VLAN technology lets infor¬ mation systems managers create logical workgroups regardless of where users are located on a network. Lucent officials said the firm plans to integrate Agile’s VLAN technology across its product line and use Agile network management software with its OneVision management system. But there is some overlap be¬ tween the Agile products that Lu¬ cent is acquiring and those that Lucent resells from Bay Net¬ works, notably Bay’s larger switches. ©Bay Networks answers 3Com Ethernet switch offering.

Transforming Enterprise Systems MICRO FOCUS 12 News Using the Internet for project management By Bob Wallace If you had the ambitious job of wiring 1,554 far-flung sites to the Internet, what would you. do? How about using the Internet itself as a project management tool. That’s what A1 Ganier and com¬ pany decided to do when present¬ ed with the gargantuan task of connecting 1,554 schools in 95 Tennessee counties to the Inter¬ net across Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines. When completed in six to eight weeks, the $5.6 million Con- necTen program will provide 860,000 students and their teach¬ ers access to the Internet’s vast In control Network managers can now set policies for how they want mo¬ bile workers and branch of¬ fices to access resources at central sites, thanks to an innovative package intro¬ duced last week by Cable¬ tron Systems, Inc. SecureFast VRA Manag¬ er runs on a Microsoft Corp. Windows NT server and lets administrators set up security, management, connection configuration, accounting and reporting rules across multiple Cabletron CyberSwitch central site remote access servers. The rules can keep the servers from accepting calls during specific times of the day or days of the week. Used with call accounting data, the rules can help IS managers save on wide-area network charges. “Cabletron is the first in¬ ternetworking vendor to extend the policy benefits of campus networks to the growing remote access community,’’ said John Morency, a principal at The Registry, Inc., a Newton, Mass., consulting and re¬ search firm. “Once the re¬ mote user gets approved by VRA Manager, he or she can rock ’n’ roll across the campus network.” — Bob Wallace educational resources. The project’s logistics entailed configuring routers for each school, coordinating ISDN line provision and equipment installa¬ tion among 27 telephone compa¬ nies and creating an information- packed World Wide Web page to keep everyone abreast of the project’s status. “We exchanged the files we needed to establish and verify routing tables for all the schools’ remote access routers with Cable¬ tron [Systems, Inc.] over the ’net,” Ganier explained. He is president of Connect Tennessee Students, a nonprofit group in Nashville that runs the Connec- Ten project. ‘There was almost no paper in¬ volved, which meant the process was more efficient and far less time-consuming,” Ganier said. The Web page also enabled schools to check on the Internet — rather than flood his network operating center with hundreds of telephone calls — for available IP addresses and the installation dates for every school. Industry analysts said they were impressed with Ganier’s ap¬ proach to project management. ConnecTen “is breaking new ground in project management, which is by far the toughest and most demanding aspect of any network undertaking,” said Dan¬ iel Briere, president of Tele- Choice, Inc., a consultancy in Ve¬ rona, N.J.

Data center managers attend¬ ing last week’s Storage Tech¬ nology Corp. conference here just wanted to know who is minding the store. Users had questions about a June agreement that gives mainframe storage competitor IBM sole responsibility for sales and marketing of Storage- Tek’s line of mainframe disk ar¬ rays [CW, June 17]. ‘We had mixed feelings be¬ cause everything coming from one vendor can limit competi¬ tion, which has been good for us in the past with lower pric¬ es,” said Dan Stanton, director of information processing ser¬ vices operations at MCA, Inc. in Universal City, Calif. Attendees said they don’t want prices of mainframe disk storage to go up with one fewer vendor in the mix, and they wonder about IBM’s commit¬ ment to marketing the Storage¬ Tek products while still selling its own Ramac systems. Also, users don’t know who will pro¬ vide product support and main¬ tenance now that there is a mix of old StorageTek shops, Sto¬ rageTek shops getting up¬ grades from IBM and new IBM customers. With StorageTek’s removal, remaining rivals to IBM include EMC Corp. and Hitachi Data Systems Corp. Although there is one fewer player, disk array Melting iceberg Now that StorageTek’s Iceberg is part of IBM’s Ramac line, IBM is adding its own new features, including: • IBM 4.5G-byte disk drives • Optional array configurations, including 8 disks for 8oG bytes or 16 disks for 210G bytes • Smaller footprint • Integrated packaging with other IBM products prices have declined over the past year and users expect good things from IBM enhance¬ ments to StorageTek products (see chart) . “IBM and StorageTek have both served us extremely well, and we hope it continues” with this agreement, said Tom Birk, manager of the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Computer Center in Raleigh, N.C. In the cards IBM and StorageTek officials revealed the following: • IBM will handle maintenance for new installations and up¬ grades to StorageTek’s Iceberg disk arrays, while StorageTek will continue maintenance for existing Iceberg customers. • If the agreement isn’t re¬ newed in 1999, customers who bought or upgraded systems from IBM will still receive sup¬ port from IBM. • IBM will continue to work on its Seastar project, its next-gen¬ eration, fault-tolerant disk stor¬ age technology that isn’t ex¬ pected to be released until 1998. Seastar won’t compete directly with Iceberg but will target higher-end users. • There is no plan to expand the agreement to other product lines, specifically tape-storage systems. • IBM is committed to sell a minimum number of Storage¬ Tek systems, and StorageTek has committed to certain target dates for new development on the products. Paul O’Neil, vice president of IBM’s high-end storage busi¬ ness, said getting the right in¬ formation from IBM staff to us¬ ers is IBM’s highest priority. “We’ve been cautious about putting too much future [Ice¬ berg] product information in IBM [marketing’s] hands right away,” O’Neil said. Louisville, Colo.-based Sto¬ rageTek entered into the deal with IBM because it felt its smaller sales force could not properly market its line of disk products. Sales in the high-end disk storage market are project¬ ed to hit $6.1 billion in 1996, ac¬ cording to International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. ©IBM unveils storage copy feature in Ramac Virtual Ar¬ ray. See page 41. StorageTek plans management software A tool being developed by StorageTek may soon give users a better pic¬ ture of how to store their cor¬ porate data. MetaLabel software will manage indexes of data on tape storage systems to make it easier to find data and un¬ derstand where and how it’s stored. Another tool being prepared, Virtual Storage Manager, simplifies the way data is organized among stor¬ age volumes in tape cartridge libraries. The firm also plans to let its Central Archive Management (CAM) software provide backup data from LANs to Unix systems. Currently, CAM backs up only LAN data to mainframe storage. Such products may give users , more options in the way they handle data coming into their central storage and backup systems. “This reflects a trend in the market to move into storage management, not just storage of data,” said Ray Freeman, president of storage consul¬ tancy Freeman Associates, Inc. in Santa Barbara, Calif. MetaLabel builds on the concept of managing meta¬ data. Users can get an inte¬ grated picture of the medium on which the data is stored and content, usage and rela¬ tionships between data sets in their networked storage sys¬ tem. The information can be used to better distribute data to various types of tape stor¬ age and ensure that data can be placed in the most secure storage media based on its importance. — Tim Ouellette COMPUTERWORLO OCTOBER 14, 1996 (www.computerworld.com) Now you can use market-leading PowerBuilder® 5.0, together with Powersoft’s new web.pb' ' to build PowerBuilder 5.0 supports ActiveX controls, you can extend your appli¬ cations’ reach even further with new Internet components.

Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates demonstrated an early version of Internet Explorer 3.0 for Unix at last week’s Unix Expo Plus trade show in New York. The company also announced that upgraded versions for Win¬ dows 3.1, Unix and Macintosh that support ActiveX will be avail¬ able free by year’s end. “We like what we see of Active- X, and the fact that it’s on plat¬ forms other than Windows 95 will give us more flexibility,” said Wayne Lemmerhirt, manager of technology services at Boston Ed¬ ison Co., where the standard desktop runs Windows 3.1. ActiveX, Microsoft’s software- component technology, is built in to Windows 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows NT. Earlier this month, Microsoft announced it had formed a con¬ sortium of software vendors called The Active Group to license ActiveX for other plat¬ forms, such as Unix. Ac¬ tiveX is a revamped ver¬ sion of Microsoft’s OLE 2.0 technology, which is included in Windows 3.1. Java alternative Microsoft also has put forward ActiveX as a way to embed small programs into Web pages. Active- X components would be an alter¬ native to Java applets, the small programs written in Sun Micro¬ systems, Inc.’s cross-platform In¬ ternet language. Currently, neither ActiveX nor Java is supported in Web brows¬ ers that run on Windows 3.1, which is still widely used on busi¬ ness desktops. “There are certainly more Win¬ dows 3.1 clients than there are Ap¬ ple [Computer, Inc.] or Sun [cli¬ ents] combined,” said Paul Ma- howald, vice president of informa¬ tion systems at Blockbuster Entertainment, a division of Via¬ com International, Inc. in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. “Having Java applets available on Windows 3.1 will be very useful.” IBM and Netscape Communi¬ cations Corp. are developing Java support for Windows 3.1. Net¬ scape plans to release a Java- enabled version of its Navigator 3.0 browser for Windows 3.1 this month. Neither ActiveX nor Java is sup¬ ported in the beta version of Inter¬ net Explorer 3.0 for Windows 3.1 that Microsoft made available at its Web site this week. Those fea¬ tures will be added before the product ships at year’s end, com¬ pany officials said. Still, as corpo¬ rate developers begin to build client/ server applications that use Web browsers and run across corporate intranets, users like having a second option for a full- featured browser, observers said. Internet standards Users still bugged by Explorer 3.0 Microsoft’s Web site \\. ;A . . (www.microsoft.com/iesupport/content/issues/) lists Internet Explorer bugs and resolutions. They include the following: mm Microsoft is researching the Internet Explorer 3.0 won’t run when Trumpet WinSock Point-to-Point Protocol is installed problem; it is telling users to remove Trumpet WinSock Screen flashes or flickers Some browser plug-ins won’t work Change code in registry, then reinstall browser Some add-ons require that Navigator also be installed; Microsoft is working with plug¬ in makers to tweak their products for Explorer or build similar ActiveX components By Kim S. Nash Microsoft Corp. last week re¬ leased a beta-test edition of Inter¬ net Explorer 3.0 for Windows 3.1, but some users wonder whether it will have the same problems found in the Windows 95 version of the browser that shipped in Au¬ gust Some problems have been fixed, but several users are vexed by the bugs that remain. Internet Explorer 3.0 scored high marks over rival Netscape Navigator 3.0 for look and feel and some advanced capabilities. But the product has been far from trouble-free, users said. Several past problems On its World Wide Web site, Mi¬ crosoft lists 12 “known issues” with Internet Explorer 3.0 (see chart), but users said they have discovered many more. For example, errors related to the Wininet runtime library fre¬ quently crop up, including sys¬ tems crashes and the inability to get Internet Explorer running af¬ ter such a crash, according to complaints on Microsoft and Use¬ net newsgroups. Internet Explorer support engi¬ neers who monitor the news- groups said they know about the error but haven’t devised a fix. Some users feared that Micro¬ soft — in its race to compete with Netscape Communications Corp. — simply rushed Internet Explor¬ er 3.0 out before its time. “Microsoft was not ready for the program to ship when it did,” said Kevin Thomas, president of MetroPage, a pager and cellular telephone company in Atlanta. “I am not completely satisfied.” Other users agreed. One user, who asked to remain anonymous, said he suffers regular, unex¬ plained “total system lockups” that force him to reboot his PC. ‘This is very serious,” he said. Microsoft didn’t return calls last week requesting comments about the remaining bugs. The company did fix some bugs in In¬ ternet Explorer 3.0 for Windows 95 just after the browser shipped.

The announcements include new PowerPC 604E-based work¬ stations and servers; a dual-pro¬ cessor technical workstation that costs less than $20,000; more World Wide Web software op¬ tions; and a disaster-recovery ca¬ pability for long-distance remote backup. This marks the biggest over¬ haul of the popular lineup since it was launched six years ago. It brings IBM users some long- awaited technology and perfor¬ mance enhancements. The lineup gives users “a broader system range with new processors at the low end and the high end and significantly better performance at the same price points,” said Peter Lowber, an an¬ alyst at Datapro Information Ser¬ vices Group in Delran, N.J. Catching up The announcements also help IBM close a dangerously widen¬ ing price and performance gap be¬ tween its RS/6000 systems and those from vendors such as Hew¬ lett-Packard Co., Sun Microsys¬ tems, Inc. and Silicon Graphics, Inc., analysts said. “They are finally getting out what they said they were going to for the past year. They are just playing catch-up,” said Roy Dodd, MIS director at The Good Guys, Inc., an electronics retailer in Brisbane, Calif. But “this definitely gets IBM back in the mainstream and puts them in a good position with sys¬ tems from vendors like HP and SGI,” said Thomas Copeland, an analyst at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. New agenda The highlights of IBM’s an¬ nouncement included the follow¬ ing: • The introduction of 166- and 200-MHz PowerPC 604E uni- and dual-processor workstations and servers. • Peripheral Component Inter¬ connect-based graphics support. That means users will have a much larger choice of graphics components compared with IBM’s proprietary Micro Channel Architecture-based graphics envi¬ ronment. • A supercomputer and a desk¬ side system based on IBM’s high- end Power2 Super Chip. • Electronic commerce software, Lotus Notes 4.5 and Java-based software options with IBM’s Pow¬ ersoft integrated Internet bundle. • A high-storage capacity sym¬ metrical multiprocessing server that supports up to 81.9G bytes of internal RAID storage, up to 1G byte of memory and up to 22 bays and nine expansion slots. ’♦V Sun brings clustering to its ■r server line.

(www.computerworld.com) OCTOBER 14, 1996 COMPUTERWORLD soft agreed to support Sun Microsystems, Inc.’s rival Java programming language, but Netscape officials have said they have no similar plans for ActiveX. That may cause trouble for application developers at large user sites who want to run both Netscape and Microsoft brows¬ ers, said an information systems manager at a large retailer, who requested anonym¬ ity. “Netscape is going to have to embrace ActiveX and not rely on a third-party, half- baked plug-in,” the manager said. On the way Also on tap for the conference are the following: • How-to sessions on using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol services to track intranet users’ rights and permissions. • Previews of upgrades to the SuiteSpot line of Web servers, which are due in the first half of next year. • Previews of legacy access utilities that will link intranets to existing systems and back-end databases.

Nash Netscape will offer a ton of product prom¬ ises and road maps — maybe even a bridge to the 21st century — at its user conference this week in New York. But users will ask the World Wide Web software vendor when it will fulfill some of its previous campaign promises. At the top of the list is when Netscape Communications Corp. will integrate the groupware products it garnered in a $108 million buyout of Collabra Software, Inc. 13 months ago. At the time, Netscape said that by the mid¬ dle of this year its Navigator browser would let users access shared Collabra files. But sup¬ port for Collabra has been de¬ layed until Navi¬ gator 4.0 ships, which is expect¬ ed in early 1997. “We now have to wait for Net¬ scape to drive the direction of a product that we were all set to take off with,” said Geoffrey Teekema, a project manager at Boston Scientific Corp. The Natick, Mass.-based medical instru¬ ments maker bought a 2,000-user license from Collabra before Netscape acquired the company. Some of the delay in Collabra support stems from Netscape’s ripping out Colla- bra’s proprietary groupware technology to replace it with a work-sharing system based on the Net News Transport Protocol (NNTP) standard. NNTP is used in Usenet newsgroups, for example. But Netscape will give showgoers a peek at Navigator 4.0, including a look at its Tools menu, which will contain Collabra- related commands [CW, Oct. 7). Getting beyond Oracle At the user conference this week, Netscape is expected to answer questions about port¬ ing its electronic com¬ merce Web servers — Publishing, Merchant and Community — to databases otherthan Oracle’s. Informix ver¬ sions were slated to ship this quarter or ear¬ ly next quarter but might be pushed back to early next year. C A captures Cheyenne Seeks lead in workgroup management Merging management By Patrick Dryden and Matt Hamblen In a bold bid to broaden its sys¬ tems management reach into LANs, Computer Associates Inter¬ national, Inc. last week acquired Cheyenne Software, Inc. for roughly $1.2 billion. CA seeks to extend its Unicen¬ ter systems management support further into workgroups by inte¬ grating Cheyenne’s popular LAN backup and virus protection tools and taking over its sales channels. At stake is a market for enter¬ prise systems management soft¬ ware that is projected to reach $7 billion to $10 billion by 1999. Also vying for a slice of that pie are ven¬ dors such as Tivoli Systems, Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. with their integrated platforms. Industry analysts generally praised the move, but some users said they were worried about the outcome. “CA’s management suite will look more attractive with these products closely tied to the line, but I’m concerned about their bad reputation for support,” said Byron Jones, systems administra¬ tor at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla. “They tend to buy companies for technology but then leave the products to die on the vine.” Jones uses software from both vendors. But CA pledged to break from tradition and keep all 800 Chey¬ enne employees in a division that will continue to support its distri¬ bution channel and users. “This time they have a good fit because the product lines don’t overlap,” said Brian Burba, man¬ agement analyst at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. “CA lacks [Novell, Inc.] NetWare storage management support and expects to grow support for Windows NT better than Cheyenne can.” Merging management Here's why CA spent big bucks for Cheyenne \\ ■ Data management tools for workgroups, including ARCServe backup and InnocuLAN virus scanning software ■ Staff of 8oo with expertise in workgroup- level software, support and sales ■ Distribution channel to complement CA’s direct sales force ■ Partnerships for devel¬ oping and spreading Unicenter tools This way CA can grab a leader¬ ship position in workgroup stor¬ age management, taking a short¬ cut from the long and costly development road to support LANs and desktops, said Sue Al¬ drich, an analyst at Patricia Sey- bold Group in Boston. CA plans to integrate ARC¬ Serve software for backup and hierarchical storage manage¬ ment, along with the InnocuLAN virus scanner, into its Unicenter line, said Charles Wang, chairman and CEO of CA in Islandia, N.Y. For users, that means Chey¬ enne tools will gain an enterprise¬ wide view, said Reijane Huai, chairman and CEO of Cheyenne in Roslyn Heights, N.Y. Tough sell But one potential user of CA’s Unicenter systems management platform remains unswayed by the acquisition’s promised bene¬ fits. “CA is focused on pushing the Unicenter next-generation ver¬ sion that integrates all aspects of systems and application manage¬ ment. But our consultants warn us that won’t ship for another year,” said a bank official, who re¬ quested anonymity. ‘We just told them to call again when they have a real product to show us.” Internet providers sued for software piracy By Stewart Deck The Software Publishers Associa¬ tion (SPA) filed lawsuits late last week that charge two Internet ser¬ vice providers and a World Wide Web-hosting service with soft¬ ware piracy. Sandra Sellers, vice president of intellectu¬ al property at the SPA, said the association filed copyright infringement law¬ suits against service providers Community Connexion, Inc. in Oakland, Calif., and GeoCities, Inc. in Beverly Hills, Calif. Tripod, Inc., a Web-hosting service in Wil- liamstown, Mass., also was served with legal papers last Thursday. The SPA filed the suits on behalf of software manufacturers Adobe Systems, Inc., Claris Corp. and Traveling Software, Inc. Four charges The lawsuits allege that each of the three service providers al¬ lowed their users to infringe on software copyrights in one of four ways: by posting unauthorized copies of copyrighted software, publishing illegal software autho¬ rizing serial numbers, publishing cracker/h acker utilities or letting users maintain links to file trans¬ fer protocol sites that host pirated software. Sellers said the SPA sent each service provider a warning letter. Repre¬ sentatives at two of the companies said it wasn’t clear whether those letters had been received. Douglas Barnes, vice president of sales and marketing at Commu¬ nity Connexion, was incensed by the association’s heavy-handed tactics. “This is a groundless and frivolous lawsuit,” he said. ‘They sent us an [electronic-mail] form letter Sept. 25, and a week later they served us with a lawsuit.” Barnes said monitoring ever- changing Web pages for content is difficult. Instead of taking legal action, the association should work with service providers on copyright policing, he said. Ironically, Community Conne¬ xion makes 95% of its revenue from sales of Web server and oth¬ er software, Barnes said. “We were going to join the SPA before this happened. Now there’s no way we will,” he said. A spokesperson at Tripod said the company is “looking into the suit.” GeoCities officials declined to comment. By Gary H. Anthes WASHINGTON President Clinton last week pledged $100 million of federal money to kick off a five-year pro¬ gram to build “the next-genera¬ tion Internet.” Clinton said the funds, which would come from existing gov¬ ernment research programs, would be used in 1998 to connect at least 100 universities and feder¬ al laboratories at speeds 100 to 1,000 times faster than today’s Internet. An additional $400 million would be used over the five years to promote experimentation with Chris Stevens, an Internet ana¬ lyst at Aberdeen Group, Inc. in Boston, agreed with Barnes. ‘They need to go after the people who post pirated software, not the host. That’s like suing the phone company for receiving obscene phone calls,” he said. new networking technologies and demonstrate new applications in areas such as national defense, medicine, education and manufac¬ turing. Clinton didn’t say where those funds would come from. “The results of this work will al¬ most surely trigger serendipitous discoveries and unlock billions of dollars in corporate product/ser¬ vice development,” said Vinton Cerf, vice president of data archi¬ tecture at MCI Communications Corp. in Washington. As co-developer of the Arpanet, the forerunner of the Internet, Cerf saw federal seed money in the 1970s and 1980s spawn much of today’s network technology. Legal issues Clinton pledges Internet funds Lotus CEO steps down By Tim Ouellette Lotus Development Corp. is los¬ ing another executive, but he isn’t going very far. CEO Michael Zisman is step¬ ping down from his post for family reasons. But Zisman will remain as vice president of strategy at the Cambridge, Mass., sub¬ sidiary of IBM. Chief Op¬ erating Offi¬ cer Jeffrey Papows will take over as CEO. Papows had shared the office of the president with Zisman, and both reported to John M. Thomp¬ son, senior vice president of IBM’s Software Group. Because Zisman and Papows had comple¬ mentary roles, observers don’t expect much change in Lotus’ strategy. Lotus has suffered a slew of ex¬ ecutive resignations since it was bought by IBM in June 1995. Zisman stepped in as CEO when former CEO Jim Manzi left last Zisman had taken a smaller part in the opera¬ tions of the company since PC Expo this summer, when he had to forgo a presentation on Lotus’ Domino technology due to a death in the family. Zisman is a founder of Soft- Switch, Inc. in Wayne, Pa., which was bought by Lotus. He is credited by observers with providing a strong technical vision for Lotus as it moved to improve its flagship Notes groupware. “As a visionary for technology, he is probably one of the stron¬ gest people I have ever met,” said Gary Rowe, principal at Rapport Communications, Inc. in Atlanta. “Lotus will miss him in that CEO slot.” Papows previously was presi¬ dent and CEO of Cognos Corp.

The chips will be unveiled at the Microprocessor Fo¬ rum conference in San Jose, Calif. The biggest performance increase is ex¬ pected to come from Exponential’s X704 chip, a 500-MHz PowerPC chip. The San Jose, Calif., company, which boasts Apple Computer, Inc. as a financial supporter, is expected to begin shipping the chip in vol¬ ume during the first quarter of 1997. ® Contents ©News ©Search ©Help ©TechCity COMPUTERWORLD The Internet Connection for the IT Community • Daily IT News • Interactive Forums • Market MindShare customized products IT Research Broadcast & services Center Technology Resource Commerce Product Pundits & Center where we Investment Center 2000 Building Search Commentary audio & are and overcoming building product & great video where stocks, conversion blocks technology minds around we’re analysis, obstacles of IT search speak the Web going trends commerce engines titles, essays, interactive reviews Your IT Web address www.computerworld.com ©’.996 COMPUTERWORLD, Inc.

Apple and Macintosh clone makers Pow¬ er Computing Corp., Umax Computer Corp. and DayStar Digital, Inc. are prep- ping machines based on the 500-MHz chip. Most are due next summer, sources said. Industry observers warned that there are roadblocks to achieving that increased speed — a huge leap in clock speed over the current crop of 225-MHz PowerPC chips. The X704 could be hampered by the current Macintosh bus architecture and cache configurations. What a difference a year makes October 1995 May 1996 July 1996 This month Q1 1997 Summer 1997 IBM ships 150-MHz PowerPC 604 chip Motorola and IBM ship 200-MHz PowerPC 603E chip IBM ships 225-MHz PowerPC 604E chip Exponential expected to unveil 500-MHz PowerPC chip Motorola and IBM due to announce 240-MHz PowerPC 603E chip Exponential 500-MHz X704 chip slated to ship Motorola and IBM expected to ship 300-MHz G3 chip Motorola and IBM expected to deliver 500-MHz G4 chip Still, users said they were excited by the potential performance increase. ‘This is the leap [over Intel] that every¬ one has been waiting for,” said Victor Na- zarian, MIS director at Harbour Inn Conva¬ lescent Medical Center in Baltimore. “With double the clock speed, I would like to get my hands on the machines as soon as pos¬ sible.” Mike Feibus, an analyst at Mercury Re¬ search in Scottsdale, Ariz., warned that clock speed alone isn’t an accurate mea¬ sure of how much faster the chip is. Still, 500 MHz tops anything available in the In¬ tel Corp. and PowerPC markets. “It’ll be a while before Intel hits that level of performance,” Feibus said. He said In¬ tel’s Pentium Pro is expected to reach speeds of 300 MHz by the end of next year. Motorola and IBM also are expected to have a 500-MHz PowerPC chip, but not un¬ til 1999. Exponential’s first offering will take over as the high-end flagship PowerPC proces¬ sor. That title was intended for the Pow¬ erPC 620 that Motorola and IBM are devel¬ oping, but the 620 is more than a year late. No new delivery date has been announced. In the meantime, Motorola and IBM will also take the wraps off their fastest Pow¬ erPC processor to date: a 603E that runs at 240 MHz. Two months ago. Power Com¬ puting announced a high-end system, the PowerTower 240, based on that chip. Apple is also readying 240-MHz 603E systems, sources close to the Cupertino, Calif, com¬ pany said.

Bernstein & Co. in New York. “From what I can tell, margins on the prod¬ ucts they are selling are higher than [what are being garnered within] the overall PC market,” he said. Zlotnikov predicted only a “slight loss in the fourth [calendar] quar¬ ter.” Operating system Although Macintosh clones may be canni¬ balizing Apple’s sales in the short term, for long-term stability Apple needs to more broadly license its Mac OS, according to in¬ dustry watchers. “It’s what Apple has to do to expand the market,” Zlotnikov said. But to appeal to potential licensees, Ap¬ ple needs a more compelling operating sys¬ tem strategy, analysts said. Some industry observers have criticized Apple’s recent decision not to deliver Mac OS 8, code-named Copland, but rather pro¬ vide periodic updates to its operating sys¬ tem. ‘The OS story is really hurting,” said Da¬ vid Card, an analyst at International Data Corp. in Mountain View, Calif. “Copland isn’t going to work, and now Apple needs to figure out what will work.” North/Central Florida Careers Will be featured in Computerworld’s November 4 edition Deadline: Oct 31, 3pm 1-800-343-6474 x8201 Computerworld October 14, 1996 (www.computerworid.com) Hie NCR Scalable Data Warehouse. ab\\#eS announcemj c.o/f NCR At the 50 used \\)e s^o*3 \\p cP #5 ■^4 ^ & ,o* e \\s \\V SJO Only big. this can we make news Once again, NCR is leading the way in data warehousing.

You’ll have to 1) Get a relational database to hold the information and avoid burdening the centralized IS resources of your operational database. 2) Get a metadata cataloging tool to define your data sources and map them to the data warehouse. This will enable you to track where your decision support data comes from and search the contents of the warehouse. 3) Get an extraction and transformation tool to pull data from the operational database and deposit it in the warehouse. Still with us? Good. 4) Get an information access tool to bridge the warehouse to the applications currently running across your enterprise. 5) Get a query tool to reach data stored on multiple platforms and to browse data search results. And get a data analysis tool to analyze complex information patterns. 6) Perhaps it’s time you took a vacation as you’ve probably put in a good six months by now. Of course, when you get back, you’ll have to get a World Wide Web connection to allow access to your warehouse via the Internet. 7) Hand code the links between the tools to create one integrated, operational data warehouse resource. Think you’re done? Hold the champagne. 8) Extract data from original operational databases and transfer it to the warehouse in raw data form. Follow that? Then let’s continue. 9) Filter the information from millions of rows of data to smaller units of usable data rows. 10) Create a metadata catalog to allow information to be found easily and quickly. That is why you got into this mess in the first place, isn’t it? 11) Update and refresh the data and data warehouse to avoid compromise of overall data integrity. Sounds simple enough. Now try doing it for nine hours a day, because that’s what it takes. 12) Finally. Hire extra staff to maintain data warehouse security, integrity, component integration and vendor contact. By the way, salaries start in the high sixties. Now you don’t have to wrestle with technology to get your data warehouse up and running. Visual Warehouse puts everything in place for you, much faster and for a fraction of the cost.

Solutions for a small planet ” - — r 28 Special Report: tax systems fiasco Time is taxing The IRS makes the first major automation with the Tax Administration System The IRS determines tax systems, based on 1950s concepts, need to be replaced. It launches a first attempt to modernize systems. The White House cancels the tax system overhaul, citing concerns about privacy and security. 1982 The IRS launches a second tax system replacement program, Tax System Redesign. Goals: upgrade hardware, speed information access, link related data, automate manual activities. 1985 The Treasury Department disap¬ proves the IRS’ project plan, saying the objectives are too general and the plan would out¬ source too much. IRS: Tough to get any respect By Gary H.Anthes The IRS has agreed with much of the criticism leveled at it over the years, but the agency claims it hasn’t gotten the credit it de¬ serves for having made substan¬ tial improvements to its systems. “All this criticism is leveled by people who can’t recognize a huge amount of progress,” said Hank Philcox, former chief infor¬ mation officer at the IRS and now CIO at DynCorp in Reston, Va. “We wasted $2.5 billion? No, we built an infrastructure. To say we made no progress ignores where we started from.” Philcox said that when he as¬ sumed responsibility for TSM in 1986, the IRS’ computer systems were on the verge of collapse. Un¬ derpowered mainframes and inef¬ ficient software took five days to do “weekend” file updates. The 1985 tax-filing season was an in¬ formation systems and public re¬ lations disaster as tax refunds to 85 million individuals suffered long delays. Essentially no data was avail¬ able online, so IRS workers relied on tons of paper documents and computer printouts. Updates to the master file — on some 3,000 magnetic tapes — were propagat¬ ed to regional centers by flying tapes across the country. As a result of the 1985 fiasco, the IRS established three key sys¬ tems priorities: boost computer power and optimize existing software, connect IRS centers with a high-speed data network and automate the manual process¬ es of case workers by getting key tax information online. By the early 1990s, Philcox said, automa¬ tion plus the network had reduced processing delays and manual effort so much that the IRS was able to eliminate 4,500 clerical positions. Philcox said the new Integrated Collection System, scheduled for full implementation in 1998, has improved by 30% the productivity of case workers where it is in¬ stalled. But final roll¬ out of that system — and other worth¬ while systems in the development pipe¬ line — depends on the IRS’ future bud¬ get for the Tax Sys¬ tems Modernization program, said Mark Cox, director of the IRS’ southwest district. The budget and plans for this latest collection system are under review by the IRS. Cox said the IRS has accom¬ plished much over the past five years. “I don’t think it’s a totally negative story at all,” he said. “I keep hearing people externally saying we haven’t gotten the mes¬ sage, but folks internally have got¬ ten the message on what needs to be done, and they are trying real hard.” The agency has also been listening lately to the siren song of outsourcing. Declaring that its ex¬ pertise is in taxes, not systems, it has been parceling out more pieces ofTSM. Philcox agreed with the GAO’s call for the IRS to do business process re¬ engineering, but he said the IRS’ deci¬ sion to automate on¬ ly existing process¬ es was the correct one at the time. “Our strategy all along was to get the near-term improvements and to ensure a return on invest¬ ment as we went along,” he said. “And we did that.” The IRS’ ex-CIO Hank Philcox: ‘To say we made no progress ignores where we started from ’ 1986 The IRS wins Treasury approval for a third approach to "
