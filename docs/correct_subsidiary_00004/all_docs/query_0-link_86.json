This threatens the prevailing business model of companies like Microsoft and Intel who benefit from bundled software and continual hardware upgrades. \n- A new programming language called Java allows small programs called \"applets\" to run on any device that has a Java enabled web browser, potentially ending software lock-in to specific hardware/operating systems and making bloatware obsolete. Many see Java and the ability to distribute software over the web as ushering in a new era for the software industry.",
