        "text": "Netscape Communicator Professional 4.01 4 (Very good)\n\nNow Shipping\n\nAfter instituting a significant weight-loss program, Netscape Communications Corp. recently released its fourth-generation Internet package, Communicator Professional 4.01. The $79 browser and groupware client now requires a more reasonable 6 Mbytes of RAM, down from 16 Mbytes in the beta we previewed (see 04.07.97, Page 19), and it includes all the components found in the Windows clients.\n\nThe expanded scope pushes Netscape's product into the realm occupied by Lotus Development Corp.'s Lotus Notes client and Microsoft Corp.'s forthcoming Active Desktop, where an all-in-one client environment is forged by a collection of components.\n\nSuite advantages\n\nAn impressive breadth of features is embodied in the browser (Navigator), e-mail (Messenger), news reader (Collabra), HTML authoring (Composer), real-time collaboration (Conference), scheduling (Calendar) and IBM 3270 terminal emulation (IBM Host on Demand).\n\nThe H.323 Conference application, which uses Apple's QuickTime Conferencing, offers real-time audio conferencing and whiteboard capabilities so you can talk and share drawings with others over an intranet or the Internet. (The forthcoming Netcaster \"push\" client component is not yet available for the Mac.)\n\nCommunicator's Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 4 (LDAP)-enabled messaging client, which can use Post Office Protocol 3 or Internet Mail Access Protocol 4, is one of the most advanced e-mail clients available. If you use a browser frequently, Communicator's flexible ways of handling folders, filters and directory services might compel you to abandon your stand-alone e-mail package. For example, you can create nested folders to store your messages; rules can have multiple selection criteria; and you can plug in any LDAP directory service, such as http://www.switchboard.com, as an extension to your address book. Being able to embed HTML in your messages adds a new dimension to them, although this feature is far from ubiquitous and your recipient needs a mail client that supports HTML.\n\nPerformance and reliability were good during an extended period of use. During more than two months with the beta and then the shipping version, we experienced no program crashes. We found that allocating 10 Mbytes of RAM (which is above the recommended amount) helped with stability.\n\nNetscape tried to make Communicator all things to all people, but the program falls short in some areas. One area is bookmark management. The Mac version lags behind its Windows counterpart: There's no custom tool bar, and you can't drag and drop bookmarks to a specific folder on the bookmarks menu.\n\nAnother area where Communicator falls short is in HTML authoring. The WYSIWYG editor, brought over from the former Gold edition of Navigator 3.0, doesn't do frames, which have become a standard feature for most Web editors.\n\nConclusions\n\nNetscape Communicator is the richest and best-integrated Internet client environment available today. For organizations seeking to adopt a standards-based approach to groupware services, Communicator is the most compelling product on the market.\n\nFor those users who prefer to integrate a group of separate products of their own selection or who favor proprietary groupware products, such as Notes/ Domino, the full breadth of Communicator's function may be less significant.\n\nNetscape Communications Corp. of Mountain View, Calif., can be reached at (415) 937-2555; fax (415) 528-4124; moreinfo @netscape.com; http://www.netscape. com.\n\nScore card: Netscape Communicator Professional 4.01\n\n4 (Very good) Netscape Communications Corp. List price: $79*\n\nHits: E-mail client links to LDAP directories; full-featured group scheduling is included; conferencing supports shared whiteboard.\n\nMisses: Lacks drag-and-drop bookmark management; missing active document support; Composer does not support frames."
