These strings exist in MENU, DIALOG and STRINGTABLE resources. (Remember, .DOG files are version specific, so if you are using a kit based on version x to localize version y, the .DOG files may not give you every instance of these strings. In that case, you need to search the resources directly.) If that resource is a localizable (i.e., not forbidden) one, you must remove or replace the word \"Netscape\" or \"Collabra\" in that resource. NOTE: there are instances where these strings should not be replaced, such as in registry entries, .INI file names, etc. These should be marked DON'T TRANSLATE in the localization notes, so pay attention to these. Instructions: You must remove or replace this with your own image.\n\nThis is a GIF89a-type file that is stored in the DATA resources of RESDLL.DLL. To remove it, simply edit RESDLL.DLL with a resource editor and delete the \"SPLASH_IMAGE\" DATA resource. You must also alter the <IMG SRC=\"about:logo\" ALT=\"Netscape Logo\"> tag in the about: page HTML. (This is contained in STRINGTABLE resources in RESDLL.DLL, starting at resource ID 60200.)\n\nTo replace this image with your own, follow these steps:\n\nOpen RESDLL.DLL with your resource editor\n\nAgain, using your resource editor, open the GIF image you want to replace the Netscape logo in another window.\n\nSelect the entire GIF image and copy it to the clipboard.\n\nSwitch to the window containing RESDLL.DLL, locate the DATA section and open the \"SPLASH_IMAGE\" resource.\n\nSelect the entire \"SPLASH_IMAGE\" resource, then paste the new image over it.\n\nBe sure the resource is null terminated (ends with 00)\n\nIf your image size is different from the original Netscape one, you might also want to alter the HEIGHT and WIDTH elements of <IMG SRC=\"about:logo\"> tag in the about: page HTML.\n\nSave the edited copy of RESDLL.DLL.\n\n(These instructions were derived by using Microsoft MSDEV. If you use a different resource editor, adjust these instructions accordingly.)"
