        "text": "Distance, in the context of virtual teams, has traditionally been treated as an unproblematic, in fact positive, byproduct of work practices mediated by ICTs. Research largely has overlooked the notion of distance and its relationship to virtual team work practices and digital telecommunications technologies.\n\nOur emphasis in this chapter is on the sustainability of online educational communities, particularly the role that evaluation has to play in promoting sustainability. From the literature on online communities and evaluation of technology, we select and extend models of online community and technology acceptance that inform and enable the design and evaluation of sustainable online educational communities. Sustainability is a key issue that highlights the sociotechnical nature of these communities. Collaboration Across ...\n\nAbstract This chapter describes the evaluation of 13 educational online forums. The forums were classified into structured or free, and teacher-centered or student-centered forums according to the learning designs used to prepare the tasks and the style of online interactions. The study provides empirical data across multiple online forum experiences to better inform the pedagogy of using online forums."
