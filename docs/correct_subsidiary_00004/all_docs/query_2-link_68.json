        "text": "The paper presents two kinds of cooperating teams: traditional and virtual, and proposes a new measure of the team virtuality level. Some representative teamwork characteristics, such as team member competencies, team diversity, leadership, and team decision-making are analyzed and compared depending on the degree of virtuality. Moreover, the team climate as one of the team performance measures is also analyzed and compared in virtual and traditional teamwork conditions. The considerations show that the virtuality level is crucial for virtual and face-to-face team comparison, virtual and hybrid team analysis and answering the question how to improve online collaboration processes and performance.\n\nBackground: The vast improvement in communication technologies and sophisticated project management tools, methods and techniques has allowed geographically and culturally diverse groups to operate and function in a virtual environment. To succeed in this virtual environment where time and space are becoming increasingly irrelevant, organisations must define new ways of implementing initiatives. This virtual environment phenomenon has brought about the formation of virtual project teams that allow organisations to harness the skills and knowhow of the best resources, irrespective of their location.Objectives: The aim of this article was to investigate performance criteria and develop a conceptual model which can be applied to enhance the success of virtual project teams. There are no clear guidelines of the performance criteria in managing virtual project teams.Method: A qualitative research methodology was used in this article. The purpose of content analysis was to explore the lit..."
