Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the individuals who helped make this book possible. A report of this scope would not have been possible without a lot of hard work and a lot of support from many people. First, without the tireless efforts and extensive contributions of Samantha McCuen, the report would simply not have been published. Samantha worked with Morgan Stanley for almost six years, most recently in the technology equity research group, before joining Sandler Capital in January as an investor focusing on PC software and new media companies. In Morgan Stanley's equity research group, many analysts with expertise in various sectors contributed to the report. They include George Kelly (Data Networking); Chuck Phillips (Enterprise Software); Steve Milunovich (Server Hardware); Neil Danzger (Telecommunications Equipment); Mark Wolfenberger (Computer Services); Alan Rieper (Semiconductors); Doug Arthur (Publishing); Stephanie Comfort (Telecommunications Services); Rich Bilotti (Cable Television); David Hilder (Financial Services); Steve Roach (Economist); and Mike Sorell (Emerging Growth). Gillian Munson, Bob Austrian, Alison Manolovici, and Tony Scott offered invaluable sanity checks and feedback. Mayree Clark, Phil Friedman, and George Kelly were key advocates in committing the resources we needed for this enterprise. Morgan Stanley's Technology investment banking team has also been critical in helping us uncover emerging companies in all areas of technology, most recently related the Internet. In our (admittedly partial, but unqualified) opinion, our technology banking team is second to none. We would like to single out Frank Quattrone, Bill Brady, Jim Liang, Chris Pasko, Drew Guevara, Tim Walsh, and Dave Weiden for their contributions to \"The Internet Report.\" While the aforementioned folks helped us get this report near the goal line, without Morgan Stanley's editorial and production group, the report never would have made it into the end zone. We would like to thank our two crack editors and technophiles, Fred Miller and Andy McCann, as well as our graphics and printing team, Alison Pitman, Claudette Bell, Ramona Boston, and Joe Darragh. In addition to the contributions of these and other Morgan Stanley employees, many pioneers in the field, experts, advisers, and friends have generously shared invaluable insights that have made their way into this report, not just over the last year, but over the last decade. To you, we hope that our descriptions of your companies and concepts do justice to your visions and entrepreneurial efforts. May the next ten years in technology be as exciting as the last ten years have been. . . .

Technology/New Media: Chapter 1: The Internet Report Introduction • Our recommended portfolio of Internet-related stocks consists of Cisco, Ascend, Cascade Communications, America Online, and Intuit. We also like Netscape, but given the volatility in the stock, its lack of liquidity, and strong performance since its IPO, we believe investors should hold off in the near term until it becomes more seasoned. Many other companies should also benefit from growth in the Internet, but we have attempted to select for our portfolio those with especially high levels of reward/risk related to the Internet. Investors have already rewarded all Internet-related companies with extremely high valuations: The five stocks in our Internet portfolio rose, on an unweighted average, 257% in 1995 and at year-end traded at, on average, 7.3 times C1996E revenue and 59 times C1996E EPS. Yes, we are excited about Internet invest- ment opportunities and the performance of the stocks, and yes, we are nervous about the valuation levels. In order to mitigate valuation/execution risk, investors must take a long-term, portfolio approach, and we recommend building posi- tions over time. While in the short term, making money in Internet-related companies has been like shooting fish in a bar- rel, over the long run, selectivity and patience will be key as companies/technologies/stocks come and go. • The companies we favor are leaders in three key areas of Internet development: Internet Infrastructure, Internet Software and Services, and Internet Content and Aggregation. • Infrastructure The three data networking equipment companies that our networking analysts, George Kelly and Neil Danzger, are recommending are Cisco, Ascend and Cascade; all three look well positioned as early beneficiaries of the rapid Internet build, which has only just begun. • Software and Services The companies we highlight — Intuit and Netscape — are in leadership positions in each of their respective operating spaces and should continue to support strong growth during the coming years. • Content and Aggregation We believe America Online has a share in each of four critical areas: service, content or- ganization and aggregation, and venture funding. We believe that the company is strategically well positioned (though not without risk to changes in its business model) to benefit from growth in online services and the Internet. • In this lengthy report, we describe various aspects of this arena (including Internet, Intranet, and Online products) and propose frameworks for analyzing its emerging markets. Two things are certain: Growth will be significant (in fits and starts) and investors will vacillate between riding the growth wave and worrying about risk/reward and valuations; and companies, strategies, and the very structure of the market will change rapidly. When we first set out to write this report, we wanted it to answer all the questions about the Internet. The goal was impossible to achieve; by its very nature, the Internet is chaotic and can only be described clearly in hindsight. Consider this report our puck on the ice at the begin- ning of a very long game. Summary and Investment Conclusion In this report we attempt to describe what may well be one of the hottest new markets to develop in years — the growth in PC-based communications and the Internet. We like the Internet investment theme for the following rea- sons: • Due to technological advances in PC-based communica- tions, a new medium — with the Internet, the World Wide Web, and TCP/IP at its core — is emerging rapidly. The market for Internet-related products and services ap- pears to be growing more rapidly than the early emerging markets for print publishing, telephony, film,\n\n1-2 MORGAN STANLEY This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

In short, there’s lots of upside. By way of comparison, since 1980 and the sale of the first PC —an initial base of zero — the PC industry has created more than $250 billion in net shareholder value. Now we are embarking on an industry just beginning to tap the base of 150 million PC users. In the first 15 years of what might be called the enhanced-communications industry, or what- ever it ends up being called, we feel that over time the shareholder value created from developments in the Inter- net (starting in 1994, for the sake of argument) could ex- ceed that created in the first 15 years of the PC revolution. • Based on our market growth estimates, we are still at the very early stages of a powerful secular growth cycle for Internet-related stuff. Remember how Microsoft’s Win- dows cured for about seven years before it became a run- away hit in 1990 with the launch of Windows 3.0? Well, the Internet — TCP/IP in particular — has been curing for about 15 years, and the rollout of the graphical Web browser (Mosaic) in 1993 is having a significant impact on market growth analogous to the launch of Windows 3.0. • There are two major market opportunities for Internet usage: enterprise and consumer. A recent survey by Da- taquest showed that in 60% of 100 medium to large organi- zations in the U.S., all departments had some access to the Internet. Similarly, the rapid take-off of America Online shows that consumer adoption of online/Internet access, while still less than 8% of U.S. homes, is growing quickly. The enterprise market is dominated by access for informa- tion services (internal or external), while the consumer market will likely be dominated by online/Internet enter- tainment and information services. • At a minimum, e-mail should become pervasive. So should Internet/Web access: E-mail is the “killer appli- cation” of the Internet today, and browsing through in- formation services the “killer app” of tomorrow. • Using the Internet as an information distribution ve- hicle offers companies the ability to reduce distribution costs, support costs, and cost of goods sold — and eventu- ally to target focused customer bases. On the flip side, lower costs and easier distribution open markets for new competitors in publishing, marketing/advertising, com- merce, and software development. Dislocations of tradi- tional companies in these areas are likely in time as new business models based on free trials, subscribers, advertis- ing, and transactions emerge. Today, the amount of money being made from Web pages (mostly free, with limited advertising) is insignificant. But the authors of this report, over the course of the last several years (thanks to some T-1 lines plus some nice notebook PCs), have spent a lot of time gathering information (and being entertained) via online services and the Web. And our conclusion is that the value of these experiences has risen to the point where it’s worth paying for. • As the Internet continues to evolve, market opportuni- ties for equipment/infrastructure providers should be huge. Opportunities for well-positioned software/services companies and content/aggregation companies will also be significant. • New companies will emerge and poorly positioned companies will die. • It’s likely that development of the Internet won’t be as easy as it sometimes appears. Bob Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet and founder of 3Com, recently offered a list of provoking thoughts about what could crush the Internet, soon: Money — Investors will tire of investing in compa- nies that lose money; Digital Money — Transaction costs will be too high; Measurement — Advertisers will only invest significant dollars when they have tangible user data; Monopolies — Telcos will be slow to reduce costs for high- speed Internet access, and the Internet will become consti- pated as more users try to send more stuff over the same infrastructure; Security — Major security breaches will occur that undermine user confidence; Compatibility — Fights for control for standards will tear the Web; Capacity — The Internet will become chronically overloaded, and the current flat-rate usage business models of vendors will not provide enough investment dollars to appropriately ex- pand capacity; Privacy — Well-publicized privacy viola- tions will occur; Video — Video delivery capabilities will\n\nMORGAN STANLEY 1-3 This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

(Like it or not, por- nography has been one of the major, early-stage drivers of many new mass media; Playboy, it should be added, cur- rently has the most popular Web site.) Do we think that all these problems will appear? No. Will some? Yes. It’s just tough to predict which and when, although the likeliest problems, we believe, will relate to security and capacity. Put simply, change takes time and dislocations happen. In times of euphoria (when it’s assumed the sky’s the limit) it’s also easy to forget developments on the “company” side. For instance, while Sun’s Java may be great, if Mi- crosoft NT erodes Sun’s server share, Sun has issues; while Netscape’s browser may seem ubiquitous, Microsoft’s free- ware, over time, may be an issue; while UUNET’s revenue growth may be awesome, competitive pressures are sure to rise; while Compaq’s Internet server business may be ramping, what happens if desktop PC prices collapse? While Microsoft’s margins may be rising, what if the Inter- net causes a platform shift; and if the Internet ramps up really fast for consumers, what happens to America On- line’s business model? Don’t get us wrong, we are extremely excited about the long-term growth prospects of the Internet/Intranet/Online stuff, and many of the aforementioned companies. It’s just that, no doubt, there will be bumps along the way. There always have been, always will be. Been there. Done that. This report violates a lot of the rules they taught us in Wall Street Analyst school. It’s long; it describes a lot of indus- try topics that aren’t investment-relevant; it’s short on in- vestment ideas. If all you care about is stock picking, the number of pure- play investment vehicles related to the Internet is shockingly short (and way too risky for your grandmother, anyway). From a short list, our even shorter list of favorite stocks follows. We like these stocks long-term but are scared about some of their short-term valuation risks. Many of the Internet-related stocks have traded up based on a simple phenomenon: Demand for the shares of semi- illiquid companies has exceeded supply. For a broader list of Internet-related companies, see Chapter 16. We think it’s a good idea for investors interested in an In- ternet-play to take a portfolio approach to these stocks, as in owning a basket to bring down the risk profile. For all the interest the Internet has received, there aren’t a lot of ways for institutional investors (who require liquidity) to invest in the sector, and while these companies should have an estimated $6.5 billion in combined revenue in C1996, at year-end 1995 they carried a collective market capitaliza- tion of $36 billion (or $11.2 billion, if you exclude Cisco and Intuit). For now, we are excluding the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as UUNET, PSINet, and Netcom from our list. While the top-line growth opportunities for these compa- nies look significant, we believe that barriers to entry are relatively low (there are more than 3,000 ISPs, and the number is rapidly rising) and that pricing pressure will remain an issue. Clearly, following their unweighted aver- age 73% 1995 rise, these stocks have shown caution to be a mistake — and given the enthusiasm for the Internet stocks generally, it may well remain a mistake for some time to come. But we prefer to wait and see. The ISP companies have been early to market with superior service offerings, and while the telcos should in theory own this market, they have not proven adept at demonstrating this. Our cautious view is not that investors should not own these stocks, it’s simply that we believe infrastructure pro- viders like Cisco, Ascend, and Cascade — which sell prod- ucts to UUNET, PSINet, and Netcom and have shares in excess of 75% in their markets — are a better, safer way (as a derivative) for investors to play the ISPs’ dramatic growth. No doubt, there will be a full pipeline of pure-play Internet companies that will go public in the next several years (manic market permitting). To put this trend in perspective for investors, consider the last big IPO boom, which was Table 1.1 Recommended Internet Stock Portfolio 1995 Mkt. Mkt.

In those 15 years, 581 tech companies went public and created more than $240B in net market capitalization. At the end of 1994, 45% of the companies traded at prices below their IPO price, and only 16 ten- bagger stocks had been created (or 3% of the companies that went public in the 15-year time period). In addition, only 17 of the top 100 PC software companies in 1981 (as defined in Jeff Tarter’s Soft-Letter newsletter) were still on the list in 1995. For the losers, the reasons for poor per- formance were typically related to competitive pressures and low barriers to entry, overhyped expectations, technol- ogy obsolescence, and poor management execution. “Caveat emptor” should be the mantra for the brave souls who tread in Internet investment waters. But the good news is that the next Microsofts, Ciscos, Oracles, and Compaqs are being created. When looking for in- vestment ideas in new markets, we default to our favorite maxims from Don Valentine of Sequoia Capital, who is known as one of the toughest and smartest technology venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. Don follows several simple rules in choosing early-stage tech investments: (1) Find “monster” markets that can be really big, like the In- ternet; (2) find good technology and good technologists who can stay ahead of competitive threats; (3) find out- standing leaders/management teams that can drive the technologies and markets forward; and 4) buy companies, not products, and try to find companies that have achieved critical mass with their products — or can achieve it, and can create some form of “barriers to entry.” Easier said than done, but an important checklist nonetheless. How to Read This Report If all you care about are stocks, your reading may be fin- ished. However if you want to put on your geek hat, your consultant hat, or your start-up company hat, read on.... just don’t read this cover-to-cover; jump around to the areas that you are interested in, as you would on the Net. This introduction is intended to give the big picture and a couple of stock ideas. At the beginning of each chapter, we summarize the highlights in a few bullet points. In Chapter 3 we analyze the size of the markets. In Chapter 8 we de- scribe, in detail, the Internet strategies for Netscape, Micro- soft, America Online, Sun Microsystems, Adobe, and Mac- romedia. In Chapter 10 we analyze the positioning of companies in the subsegment Internet markets. In Chapter 11 we give brief descriptions of what lots of companies are doing about the Internet, and in Chapter 12 we present our favorite cool sites on the Web. The other chapters describe various areas and issues surrounding the Internet such as history, software environment, technical and administrative stuff, infrastructure, and company financials. Background Thoughts   You Want Action? We Got Action. . . No doubt, something’s happening. PC sales are cruising along at healthy (though slowing) rates. Microsoft is mar- keting Windows 95 as if every breathing body were a po- tential customer. Morgan Stanley chief economist Steve Roach posits that consumers are buying PCs instead of cars. How can all of these wonderful things actually be happening — especially in the tough climate of the ’90s? It is tough out there — layoffs, stagnant real wages, and longer work days are only part of the malaise that is grip- ping the American worker/consumer. In part, because of these developments, households are operating in a much more income-constrained environment than ever before. That implies that when they find something new they like (i.e., computers) they must give up something in return (i.e., cars). The numbers certainly bear this out. When the current recovery commenced in 1Q91, our estimates sug- gest that cars and trucks accounted for 12% of total discre- tionary consumption; some 18 quarters later (3Q95), this ratio was essentially unchanged at 12%. Over this same period, the share of discretionary consumption going to electronics — computers, video and audio equipment, cable TV, and video cassette rentals — rose from 6% in 1Q91 to 10% in 3Q95. In the income-stretched 1990s, families have financed their entry into the Information Age by rede- fining the trade-offs that have long shaped discretionary spending choices.\n\nMORGAN STANLEY 1-5 This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

But there’s more to it than that. It’s also a cultural thing. The local radio station is taking song requests via e-mail. Actress Sandra Bullock, an avid America Online user, worked to get the lead role in the summer film The Net, then hosted an online chat forum on America Online and 2,000 people (a chat record at the time) joined in to partici- pate. MTV then decided to host Michael Jackson in a similar session, only to be followed by online distribution of speeches and Internet video updates from the U.S. tour of the Pope (yes, THE Pope)! The local coffee shop in Tellu- ride, Colorado (The Steaming Bean), has a PC with an In- ternet connection for its customers. Finally, tech stocks have (with fits and starts) experienced one of the most powerful rallies ever. What’s going on? We call it “The Great Communications Backfill Opportu- nity.” Over the last ten years, Bill Gates of Microsoft has been the most vocal repeater of the mantra “A PC on Every Desktop.” Now we are getting to the point where PCs, while not on every desktop (or every lap), are supporting the kind of presence/momentum where even your mother thinks that Bill could be right. Over the last nine years, Intel has shipped over 300 million x86 chips for PCs: 35 million Pentiums, 125 million 486s, 72 million 386s, 40 million 286s, 30 million 8088/8086s. That implies a simi- lar number of PCs were shipped, but let’s assume that, on average, only those shipped in the last four years are still in use. Of those 196 million PCs, we’d estimate some 23% are second PCs, leaving about 150 million PC users in the world. We ramble on about these numbers for a purpose: Spread- sheets, word processors, and games are cool, useful, and important, but there ain’t nothing like communicating with a PC (whether via e-mail; transferring a file; interacting with someone who shares your interest in migration pat- terns of Canadian Geese; or obtaining information on any- thing from the weather to the best beer halls in Munich). Or yes, conducting good old-fashioned commerce in a new way. How Big? How Fast? How Much? Of those 150 million estimated worldwide PC users, we estimate 35 million (23%) have used e-mail in their busi- nesses, 9 million (6%) have used the Web, and only 8 mil- lion (5%) have used an online service. We feel that e-mail, online/Web access may be ubiquitous for PC users within a decade. Intel shipped about 60 million x86 chips for PCs in 1995 (up 20% Y/Y) and expects 100 million PCs to ship in a year sometime before the year 2000. This implies more than 250 million PC users by the year 2000  in short, a big market opportunity for lots of companies. See Chapter 3 for details on our PC and Internet user estimates. Node counting is one way to size a market; there are others, such as infrastructure revenue. Although not easy to esti- mate with accuracy, the 1994 data communications market approached roughly $15 billion/year if one includes private line data services ($9 billion/year), local area network and bridge/router equipment ($3 billion/year), wide area net- work services ($1 billion/year), electronic messaging and online services ($1 billion/year), and proprietary network- ing software and hardware ($1 billion/year). Some of these markets show 35–50% annual growth rates, and the Inter- net itself has nearly doubled in size each year since 1990.\n\n1-6 MORGAN STANLEY This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

What is the Internet? • The Internet is a network of networks that are both commercial and publicly-owned. • It has no end and no beginning; as networks are added or removed, or failures occur in parts of the system, the rest of the Internet continues to operate. • No one owns the Internet; it is a shared resource that grows more useful as more networks — both private and public — are added. • Growth in connections to the Internet, or hosts, is dou- bling annually, a rate that should continue for at least the next five years. The following definition is taken from the archives of the RFC (Request for Comments) by the U.S. government’s networking task force: “The Internet is a world-wide network of networks with gateways linking organizations in North and South America, Europe, The Pacific Basin and other countries. . . . The organizations are administra- tively independent from one another. There is no central, worldwide, technical control point. Yet, working together, these organizations have created what to a user seems to be a single virtual network that spans the globe.” “The networks all use a common suite of networking protocols, TCP/IP. It is because of this commonality of protocols, this commonality of network func- tionality and interoperability, that the networks provide what may appear to be a seamless, inte- grated virtual network, regardless of the underlying heterogeneity of the underlying computer hardware or communications transport.” That is just the technical core of what the Internet is. We believe the Internet has taken on many new meanings. The Internet is also: • No longer for academic, UNIX-gurus; • Getting easier to use; • A new shopping paradigm; • A generational thing; • An extension of the ubiquitous PC; • A vast source of information, facts, opinions, and enter- tainment; and • Not going to be the same in five years. A few years ago, the Internet user base was dominated by academics and researchers. Now, most users pay to access it through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) like Netcom or PSINet, or an Online Service Provider (OSP) like America Online. Individual dial-up modem accounts typi- cally cost about $20 per month, depending on use; corpo- rate accounts cost hundreds to many thousands of dollars, depending on the bandwidth purchased. We believe the most important factor in the Internet’s on- going growth was the Mosaic browser, an easy-to-use graphical interface that allows easy navigation through the World Wide Web, one of many protocols running on the Internet. Improvements in search engines like Yahoo or InfoSeek that let users easily look up information on nearly every imaginable topic have also helped the Web multiply. As the PC becomes a communications device, an increasing number of PCs are being connected to ISP and OSP net- works. Companies have also begun to ramp up Internet software for use on internal networks, called intranets. The motivation for this is put into perspective when you ask yourself the simple question: Why is it that I can use the Internet to easily find a file in Russia when I can’t even find a file I created two months ago on my corporate LAN?\n\nMORGAN STANLEY 1-7 This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

The Internet now encompasses an estimated 70,000 net- works worldwide, about half of which are in the United States. Users on the Internet are doubling annually, or a rate of about 0.19% per day. About 10 million computers (hosts) are permanently attached to the Internet, plus at least that many portable and desktop systems only intermit- tently online. (In 1969, there were only four computers on the ARPANet, and only 200 on the Internet in 1983). Traffic rates in the recently \"retired\" NSFNet backbone approached 20 trillion bytes per month and were growing at a 100% annual rate. As technology analysts, we are used to change. We have witnessed the adoption of the minicomputer, the rollout of the Macintosh, the ramp-up of the PC, the pervasiveness of the spreadsheet, the invasion of the Automatic Teller Ma- chine, the growth in the number of local area networks, and Figure 1.1 Internet Host Growth, 1969 to 1995 0 1,000,000 2,000,000 3,000,000 4,000,000 5,000,000 6,000,000 7,000,000 12/28/68 6/20/74 12/11/79 6/2/85 11/23/90 5/15/96 Note: Generally speaking, an Internet host is a device such as a computer or router that is connected to the Internet Source: Network Wizards of course, the rapid acceptance of Windows. But we have never seen anything like the recent rapid ramp and scale of the use of online services and the Web. We have a simple approach to calibrating just how big the market opportuni- ties may be. We call it our less than/more than perspective. Less than describes emerging or rapidly growing things that make us enthusiastic about the potential market oppor- tunities; more than shows historical consumer or business buying patterns that also make us enthusiastic about the size of the market opportunity. Confused? Here goes, as of mid-1995...

Paraphrases, Quotes, and Tidbits From George Gilder In his book Life After Television (Norton: 1992), George Gilder articulates his view of the changing medium being created by the Internet and developing technologies. We offer some of our favorite Gilderisms to help describe what’s driving many current/future technology changes. Data is rapidly approaching a level of 50% of the bits in a telephone net- work and already comprises 20% of the profits. Data income is growing six times as fast as voice income. As the telephone network becomes a computer network, it will have to change, root and branch. All the as- sumptions of telephony will have to give way to radically different assump- tions. Telephony will die. Computer networks respond to all the human characteristics that TV net- works defy. Computer nets afford peer-to-peer interactivity rather than top-down broadcasts. Rather than a few “channels,” computer networks offer as many potential connections as there are machines linked to the web. Rather than a system whereby a few “stations” spray images at mil- lions of dumb terminals in real time, computer networks put the customer in control, not settling passively for what is on the “air” but actively seeking and even shaping the customer’s first choices. The cost-effectiveness of individual computers measured in MIPS (millions of instructions per second) per dollar approximately doubles every 18 months and the value of computers in networks rises as the square of the rise in the number of networked machines. In a top-down network, such as a conventional phone or cable system, attaching a new device may burden the central switch or head end; it is close to a zero-sum economy of com- munications; in broadcasting over the air, each additional receiver has no effect on the technical power of the system. But in a peer-to-peer computer heterarchy, each new device is a resource for the system, expanding its capabilities and even its potential bandwidth. The larger the network grows, the more efficient and powerful are all its parts. The computer industry feeds on the explosive advance of semiconductor and networking electronics: (1) The Law of the Microcosm showing that microchip cost-effectiveness rises as the square of the number of transis- tors crammed on a single chip; and (2) the Law of the Telecosm showing that computer cost-effectiveness rises by the square of the number of com- puters connected to networks. According to Moore’s law, the famous pro- jection of Intel Chairman Gordon Moore, the number of transistors on a single chip will double every 18 months. According to the record of the last five years, the number of computers attached to networks is rising too fast to measure. Only by comprehending the full force of the computer juggernaut can one anticipate the future of the information age. In 1950, few people could imagine that in a decade or so television would become a peremptory force in American culture, defining the news, reshap- ing politics, reorienting family life, and remaking the cultural expectations of several generations of Americans. No one predicted that in a few dec- ades 98% of all American households would own a television set, exceed- ing the level of telephone ownership by five percentage points, and by a far larger margin in the homes of the poor. No one anticipated that the mem- bers of an average household would watch the screen some six hours a day, while in poor homes television would become a substitute hearth, glowing constantly day and nights. Few people foresaw that television, more than any other force, would provide the unifying images that would define the national experience and consciousness. By radically changing the balance of power between the distributors and creators of culture, the teleputer will forever break the broadcast bottle- neck. Potentially, there will be as many channels as there are computers attached to the global network. The creator of a program on a specialized subject  from fly-fishing to quantum physics  will be able to reach with one video everyone in the United States, Europe, and Asia who shares the interest. Artists will be able to command a large audience without worry- ing about mass appeal. The medium will change from mass-produced and mass-consumed commodity to an endless feast of niches and specialties. Today, some 70% of the movie dollar goes to distribution [and 68% of magazine revenues are dedicated to manufacturing and distribution]. The masters of the bottleneck charge a toll to the queued-up creators seeking to reach the public and a toll to the public seeking the creators’ work. In the fiber-optic network, however, the share of the entertainment dollar going to distribution will drop below 5%. With essentially unlimited bandwidth, the cost of adding another option on a fiber cable will be negligible. The op- erators of fiber networks will want above all to fill them with programs. A huge variety of suppliers will gain access to audiences and money will pass from the distributors to the creators. But this will not be a zero-sum game. The distributors will do better, too, because of an explosive expansion in the market. Big-events  the Super Bowl or the election debates or the most compel- ling mass programs  will still command their audiences, which can be reached by direct-broadcast satellite or broadcasts through fiber-optic cables. But all the media junk food and filler that stretches out toward the horizons of mass culture like so much strip development will tend to disap- pear. People will order what they want rather than settling for what is there. In the world of the teleputer, broadcasters, educators, investors, and filmmakers, who thought they could never go broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people, are going to discover that they were wrong. A tablet that looks very much like a newspaper but in fact is a flat-panel screen some nine inches wide, a foot high, and a half inch thick . Weighing a little over a pound, far less than the Sunday edition of your local news- paper, this device  call it a newspanel  might contain a trove of news, graphics, audio, and even video, representing more than a year of Sunday papers. Through fiber-optic lines and radio links it might connect to data- bases of news and entertainment from around the world. As Steve Case of America Online puts it: ‘Everybody will become informa- tion providers as well as consumers. The challenge is to create electronic communities that marry information and communications  thereby creat- ing an interactive, participatory medium. The community aspect is crucial  it is the soul of the new medium.’ America Online is uniquely focused on the vital center of the new market: the point of convergence of newspa- pers, magazines, and computers in new communications of interest and interaction. This is it, folks, the PC — defined not just by a programmable microproces- sor or digital graphics or robust interactivity, but by a culture of adult engagement and invention. Follow the personal computer and you can reach the pot of gold. Follow anything else and you will end up in a back- water. What the Model T was to the industrial era  the teenage training board, the tinkerers’ love and laboratory, the technological epitome  the PC is to the information age. Just as people who rode the wave of auto- mobile technology  from tire makers to fast food franchisers  prevailed in the industrial era, so the firms that prey on the passion and feed on the force of the computer community will predominate in the information era.\n\nMORGAN STANLEY 1-9 This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

Generational Combustion? As in the past, much of the new Internet industry will be created by twenty-somethings just out of college (either before or after graduation) and heading new companies. Marc Andreessen, at the age of 23, was sought out by Sili- con Graphics founder Jim Clark to be the technical vision- ary for Netscape. After a stab at a magazine/newsletter venture, the Gardner brothers of “The Motley Fool” stock forum on America Online, have created one of the hottest interactive forums in the online world. If they keep it up, they (and others) have the potential to shake up the finance and publishing industries. In short, this generation grew up with PCs, knowing how to use them and knowing how powerful they can be. It’s overly simplistic to say that the PC revolution was created by “kids” such as Steve Jobs/Steve Wozniak (Apple), Bill Gates/Paul Allen (Microsoft), Mitch Kapor/Jim Manzi (Lotus), Paul Brainerd (Aldus), Trip Hawkins (Electronic Arts), and Dan Bricklin/Bob Frankston (Software Arts), but they sure had a lot to do with it. There is a lot to be said for how a near-maniacal leader (who lives/breathes his/her business passion) can indeed, with the right idea and a little capital, create big changes, and, yes, make lots of money. With each step in the evolution of computing (figure 1.2) from mainframe to minicomputer to PC   or from cen- tralized to decentralized to networked computing   more and more people gained control of their computing capabilities. Smaller, cheaper computing systems also made this control more economical. From a business perspective, the overriding theme was that no company that dominated one generation of computing managed to domi- nate the next; each became wedded to its legacy systems and cash flow. The reason that communications-enabled computing will continue to grow is twofold. First, it allows people to con- trol the way they communicate. Just as e-mail is so much more efficient than voice-mail, when you first speak to someone via your PC and the Internet (watch out, IXCs) you may feel the same sense of epochal breakthrough me- morialized by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 with “Mr. Watson, come here, I want you.” Second, it allows them to control the time and manner in which they obtain informa- tion (why wait for the current weather forecast on the even- ing news when you can get it at the click of a mouse any- where and anytime). No doubt, solutions will arise for problems that we didn’t know we had. Just as automatic teller machines eliminated trips to the bank, communica- tions-enabled software products such as Intuit’s Quicken will eliminate some of those trips to the ATM and will, no doubt, eliminate lots of check-writing, manual bill-paying and stamp licking.

So What’s an Investor to Do? It’s simple, go to work for a start-up or become a venture capitalist! :-) Any public investor who’s lived through the development of the PC business knows what rough-and-tumble, volatile investing is all about, knows the thrill of buying Microsoft shares in the IPO and holding on...a single investment that allowed one to make a lot of poor investments and still come out way ahead. No doubt, we will go through periods of investor enthusiasm and depression and periods of capi- tal gains and losses. Concepts and companies will come and go (remember artificial intelligence, Fortune Systems, Kaypro, Daisy Systems, MiniScribe, Eagle Computer, and the first iteration of Activision?) but opportunities will abound. We will also go through periods of rapid growth in the number of new companies followed by shakeout and con- solidation. These sorts of gyrations, too, will provide in- vestment opportunities. In general, we believe development of the Internet industry will follow a pattern similar to the beginning of personal computers in the early 1980s, with three distinct phases (figure 1.3). In the early years, hardware/infrastructure will dominate, but over time, value will shift first to ena- bling technology (like an operating system and software and services to manage the interactive environment) and ultimately to programming, content, and aggregation. We have a simple investment thesis for the evolution of the Internet industry: Buy stock in companies that have good underlying business/growth fundamentals and be very se- lective. For these companies, one should use traditional valuation parameters for valuing the core business and use P/E analysis and/or discounted cash flow to value the base case Internet opportunities for the company (as a call op- tion). In fact, some companies, like Netscape, can be con- sidered call options. It is also useful to estimate potential market sizes and attempt to determine what market shares and margins a company may obtain. If a business is sub- scriber based, estimating lifetime revenue per subscriber is useful. Of course, a portfolio investment approach is key.

A Few Brief Thoughts from Biotechnology Investors Regarding Internet Investing Given the euphoria, enthusiasm, and downright investor warp related to the Internet, we thought it wise to converse with our brethren from biotech-land to compare and con- trast Internet with biotech frenzy. Lucky for us, many of our fellow analysts are also PC-using Internet cruisers. Morgan Stanley’s emerging growth analyst Mike Sorell and biotech analyst Eric Hecht watched biotech stocks ex- perience explosive growth in 1991. Many issues rose sev- eral hundred percent; IPOs were oversubscribed many times and went to quick premiums of 100% or more. In- vestors were trying to find another Amgen, which went from $0 to about $1 billion in sales in about one year’s time. Although it was predictable that disaster lurked, it took fundamental bad news on three individual stocks in late 1991 and early 1992 (three years after the biotech bull mar- ket began) to result in a fundamental reevaluation of the industry’s prospects: U.S. Bioscience had a negative re- view at the FDA for its flagship product, Ethyol. Synergen, which had risen from the low teens to close to $100 a share, failed to confirm its phase II results for Antril (a treatment for septic shock) in a definitive phase III controlled trial. And Centocor saw the FDA give a strong, and almost le- thal, turndown to its entry in the septic-shock arena. The fallout was severe: First-tier stocks fell 30%; second- tier about 60%; and the mass of third-tier names declined 80%. Our analysts have tracked the class of 1991 IPOs and note that while the market capitalization is now, four years later, about double that of the group at the end of 1991, the share price is, on average, the same. This underscores a key difference between biotech and many (though not all) Internet companies: namely, the need for additional capi- tal. How does all this compare to the Internet arena? In our view, the industry dynamics are very different. The exam- ples cited above point out the tremendous and unpredictable clinical and regulatory risk associated with biotech stocks. On the positive side, most Internet companies are selling products and can do so very quickly after inception  most also do not have an insatiable need for capital (with the exception of the OSPs/ISPs, which are in rapid infrastruc- ture build mode) as they often generate cash quickly. On the negative side, the market sizes, business models, and competitive threats for Internet companies are not yet de- fined. What are the similarities? Well, to keep it short, the sus- pension of disbelief among investors and the triumph of greed over fear. However, when sentiment turns from positive to negative, picking up the pieces will be fruitful and rewarding; with biotech, other than a handful of lead- ers, this effort took three years to unfold and has just re- cently proven fruitful.\n\n1-12 MORGAN STANLEY This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

Source: Morgan Stanley Estimates We believe new businesses that are created by or for the Internet marketplace will grow very rapidly, at an estimated CAGR of 38% from now until the year 2000 (see table 1.3). Such businesses include data net- working equipment specialized for the Internet, Internet Service Providers, security equipment and software, In- ternet applications software, transaction processing, seg- ments of the enterprise software market, information provision, information aggregation services, online and offline publications, and online commerce. We also be- lieve growth in some existing markets, namely PCs, serv- ers, semiconductors, and telecommunications service and equipment, will benefit indirectly. This segment should grow at a 30% CAGR, thanks in part to its role in sup- porting the Internet’s growth. Combining directly and indirectly-related markets, we believe the Internet market will grow at a 38% CAGR until the year 2000. We estimate Internet-related revenues by applying our estimates for the fraction of a company’s total revenue in the latest 12 months that is related to the Internet. For new businesses like ISPs, this is easy, 100%. For exist- ing businesses, this is less obvious. Data networking equipment is a good example. We estimate that about 1/5 of all worldwide data networking equipment revenues were derived as a result of sales to ISPs, OSPs, carriers for use on the Internet, or for sales which were incre- mental as a result of the Internet. Similar logic is applied for other company categories. In Table 1.3 we put the size of today’s Internet market at about $5.0 billion for new markets plus another roughly $11 billion re- lated indirectly to existing infrastructure companies. We believe the ‘new businesses’ market may grow to $36 billion in the year 2000, and the indirectly-related existing markets will grow to $43 billion. In describing some of the more interesting public com- panies in the communications evolution, one thing is absolutely certain: a host of companies will be key to new developments that no one has heard or thought of yet...and some of the best-and-brightest companies of today will become also-rans. We have created a series of competitive analysis charts (see Chapter 10). Our sum- mary chart (Fig. 1.4) divides the Internet market into 16 subsegments. We compare the value-added of various companies’ products with growth opportunities relative to the Internet. The sweet spot is high and to the right.\n\nMORGAN STANLEY 1-13 This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public. No representation is made that it is accurate or complete.

Infrastructure Data Networking Equipment (Bridges, Routers & Hubs) Right now, development of the connected community is just beginning, and a simple analogy would compare it to the rollout of the railroad system in America in the 1860s. Let’s say that it’s 1865 and railroad track/ties are just be- ginning to be deployed (at its peak in 1928, America had over 260,000 miles of railroad track in operation) and you have the option of investing in (a) a group of five compa- nies that have a near monopoly on railroad ties, or (b) one of 20 capital-intensive start-ups that want to control rail- road traffic in different regions. Which would you pick? We would invest in the railroad tie companies: They are not particularly capital-intensive, they have market leader- ship, and the demand for their products is bound to grow dramatically with the rollout of the train system. We believe that the railroad-tie equivalents for the rollout of today’s PC communication systems are Cisco, Ascend, and Cascade, and possibly U.S. Robotics. In the IPO pro- spectuses of Netcom, PSINet, and UUNET, Cisco is identi- fied as a sole source provider in the risk section of each, and Cascade and Ascend are identified in two. Once one of the brands/products is installed, more of the same are likely on the way. These are as close to proprietary ‘railroad ties’ as you can get. In general, to build a small- to medium- sized Point of Presence (POP), which gives subscribers lo- cal call access to their ISP or OSP network, you need one router, one switch (though mainly in large networks), and one or more call aggregators. One way to assess the poten- tial market size for data networking equipment related to ISP and OSP networks is to estimate the number of POPs necessary to allow local access calls to most users in the U.S. and in the rest of the world. Today, each of the largest ISPs has 200–300 or more POPs worldwide, mostly in the U.S. and in the same cities as their competitors (New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, etc.).\n\n1-14 MORGAN STANLEY This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

Inc. and others associated with it may have positions in and effect transactions in securities of companies mentioned and may also perform or seek to perform investment banking services for those companies. Cisco’s routers comprise an estimated 80% of the Internet backbone. The ISPs are standardized on the product, for the prevailing TCP/IP technology needs routing to work. Cisco’s yearly growth has chugged along at rates of almost 100% for FY1992 to FY1994, 59% for FY1995; Morgan Stanley analyst George Kelly estimates 74% annual growth over the next year and 45% the year after. Cisco has grown from a $340 million company in fiscal 1992 to nearly $2 billion in FY1995. Cascade and Ascend, two companies that went public in 1994, are big beneficiaries of growth in the Internet. Both have leads in incorporating features needed by the ISPs into their products, and both have substantial installed bases in the ISPs, OSPs, and other carriers. Because Cisco, Ascend, and Cascade equipment is neces- sary to build the Internet, we believe these stocks are the safest and cleanest way now to invest in its evolution. Internet Security Equipment and Software In surveys over the past year, the No. 1 concern of network managers considering a connection of their corporate net- works to the Internet is security. There are many forms of security to be concerned with. First, external threats of hackers from the outside. Once connected to the Net, a system may need some degree of firewalling and/or packet filtering. Applications-layer firewalling, considered more advanced than packet filter- ing, is being addressed by many privately-held and pub- licly-traded companies, including Raptor, Secure Comput- ing, Border Networks, Trusted Information Systems, and CheckPoint Software. Second, meeting the threat of messages being inter- cepted. Once they are on the Internet, messages require some kind of transmission and/or transaction security (encryption). Transmission security is being addressed using on-the-fly encryption by companies such as Raptor and TimeStep, an affiliate of Newbridge Networks. Trans- action security is being addressed by software encryption technology built into browser and other software by Terisa (a joint venture between EIT and RSA Data Security), RSA Data Security, Netscape, VISA International, Microsoft, Spyglass, and many others. Third, the threat of unwanted users being authorized ac- cess to ISP networks or to corporate networks through the Internet. This is being combated by more advanced pass- wording and user authentication. Security Dynamics, maker of the SecurID card, and CryptoCard, are making extended user authentication challenge/response token cards that generate one-time passwords. The market for Internet security is small today but has the potential for strong growth over the next several years. Over time, it’s likely that many of the small security com- panies will be acquired by larger companies wishing to enhance or extend product lines. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) With 1995 year-end public valuations in the range of 20, 25, and 6 times latest 12-month sales, companies such as UUNET, PSINet, and Netcom have certainly captured the enthusiasm of investors. Together, the three have an ag- gregate public market capitalization of $3 billion but only $176 million in latest 12-month revenue and $57 million in latest 12-month losses. These companies are helping create the backbone for the Internet by providing interconnections. While this market is growing very rapidly, large companies such as MCI, Sprint, AT&T, IBM, CompuServe, America Online and many others (remember, there are more than 3,000 ISPs worldwide) are competing in this space or soon will. The growth/business model dynamics of this business can be compared with that of the cellular business in the 1980s and ’90s. Companies are investing lots of capital to build regional POPs (points-of-presence) as quickly as possible to secure users around the country and worldwide. While this business is growing rapidly, over time it will likely experi- ence considerable pricing pressure as new entrants fight for traffic. In addition, in time it’s likely that we will see an industry shakeout, and the better-capitalized may acquire the smaller pioneers. ISPs are moving fast to find ways to enhance their revenue streams, ranging from using their own interfaces/browsers, search engines and soon, bundling (in cable-model fashion) basic and premium services for Web access/membership to certain sites. For example, Microsoft would like to bundle (for a fee) MSN and NBC news with every ISP’s offerings. ISPs were first to market in providing Internet access to customers. We expect many RBOCs to begin offering lim- ited service by 2Q96; PacBell and US West already do;\n\nMORGAN STANLEY 1-15 This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

Inc. and others associated with it may have positions in and effect transactions in securities of companies mentioned and may also perform or seek to perform investment banking services for those companies. some of the IXCs are already offering service. As it stands now, the ISPs’ infrastructure and customer base are grow- ing as rapidly as their people can purchase, install and maintain network equipment; ISP and OSP network infra- structures have been growing more slowly than customer usage. ISP and OSP networks are not as reliable as tele- phone users have become accustomed to. We have seen the ISPs come to market for more capital many times, and the valuations on these stocks look high relative to sales. The telcos will either miss the market; buy into the market; or successfully enter it on their own. Bandwidth expansion will be an ongoing issue for the ISPs. As Internet usage increases and bandwidth requirements expand, the infrastructure will need to ramp as well. In time, cost increases will have to be passed on to users, and it is likely that structural bottlenecks may occur. PCs, Servers, and Semiconductors Anyone who wants to communicate digitally needs a com- munication device, a PC (or a pager or a set-top box). As indicated earlier, we expect PC growth to remain reasona- bly strong (though the rate of growth will likely continue to slow) as the market for PCs expands globally and as func- tionality (largely communications features) increases. The most play in this space is the company with an 80% market share in PCs, Intel. We feel it is clearly positioned to be the primary beneficiary (at least, based on microprocessor units shipped; revenues may be another story) as end-users con- tinue to ramp up their PC processing power. Of course, PC vendors such as Compaq and Dell profit from PC growth. However, their relatively low, though leading, worldwide market shares (10% and 3%, respec- tively) indicate just how competitive this space of the mar- ket is. Microsoft, naturally, benefits from PC growth as well. You want to set up a home page or a stable communica- tions infrastructure for internal/external digital communi- cations? You need a server plus software. Companies such as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, and Sili- con Graphics have indicated that server sales have picked up due to the Internet. We believe there is a trend to make servers, and the software that runs on them, easier to use and less expensive. Telecommunications and Related Services Telecom service providers should benefit from increased utilization of the Internet in two important respects, in- creased network usage and new access services, and new retail service offerings. Increased activity on the Internet will increase demand for access to Internet points of presence (POPs). This could benefit local exchange carriers by stimulating demand for second access lines (for use with modems) and — depend- ing on calling plans and POP locations — increasing local usage revenues. Current Internet applications are also very graphics-intensive, which requires faster connections and should facilitate both high-speed business-line and residen- tial ISDN sales. More Internet activity will also stimulate demand for backbone capacity, of which the long-distance carriers, primarily AT&T, Sprint, and MCI, are already supplying a large portion. The telecom service providers hope the real revenue oppor- tunity will be through retail product offerings. Telecommunications Equipment Many (but not all) telecommunications equipment vendors are significant beneficiaries of increasing Internet activity. Since much of the Internet’s allure stems from its heavy use of graphics and often sound, high-speed digital connections are required, at the very least, between major nodes com- prising the Internet. Ideally, digital connections should also exist between Internet Service Providers’ points of presence and their subscribers’ access equipment, though admittedly most Internet connections today are being made over slower, analog phone connections. Much of the Internet is composed of multiprotocol routers linked by high-speed data lines. These leased connections, operating at 1.5 megabits/second in the case of T1 lines, or 45 megabits/second in the case of less ubiquitous but higher capacity T3 connections, are supplied by carriers using digital cross-connects manufactured by companies such as Tellabs and DSC Communications. Cross-connects serve to trunk and groom digital signals between the endpoints of leased connections.\n\n1-16 MORGAN STANLEY This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

While routers play an important role in Internet infrastruc- ture, larger ISPs are increasingly choosing to establish pri- vate frame relay networks to aggregate subscriber traffic from their many points of presence and to manage the flow of that traffic onto the Internet. Major ISPs and OSPs have purchased frame relay switches from Cascade and Strata- Com for this purpose. Subscribers can connect directly to Internet Service Providers’ frame relay networks, attracted by high throughput (generally 56 kilobits/second to 1,544 kilobits/second) compared with the tens of kilobits on con- ventional analog connections. When accessing the Internet using frame relay, subscribers often need FRADs (frame relay access devices) manufactured by companies such as Digital Link, the Kentrox division of ADC Telecommuni- cations, and Motorola to interface with the frame relay service. Another increasingly attractive method of accessing the Internet is Integrated Services Digital Network. ISDN, long the “Rodney Dangerfield of digital connectivity,” is beginning to gain respect given its high bandwidth (up to 128 kilobits/second for a BRI connection, with throughput several times that with compression) and attractive pay-as- you-go nature. Companies that supply ISDN connections or make equipment to access ISDN include Ascend Com- munications, ADTRAN, U.S. Robotics, Premisys, and Mo- torola. Telecommunications carriers offering or planning to offer video services may ultimately harness one of the most promising means of increasing bandwidth to the home and office. CATV operators are conducting trials of high-speed data communications over an upgraded broadband plant. Success in this endeavor hinges on more widely upgrading plant to accommodate two-way communications and man- age communications over a combination of fiber and cop- per. Several companies have cable modems under devel- opment, including CATV equipment leaders General In- strument and Scientific-Atlanta, a host of other large com- panies such as Intel, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, and Zenith, as well as several smaller companies such as @Home, LAN City and Com21. While architectures differ widely  is the upstream/downstream bandwidth equal or primarily broadcast in nature? Will Ethernet, ATM, or some other protocol be employed?  this product segment will likely remain an area of intensive trials and investment over the next few years. Software and Services Application Software There will likely be four key areas for Internet software development: (1) Browser software; (2) Server software; 3) Internet software development/authoring tools; and 4) software for back-end processes and databases. The Web is about software; heretofore, lots of Internet software has been distributed freely. Many companies today are spend- ing heavily to develop software to make the Internet easier to use. To date, we think the biggest success story is Netscape Communications, which will likely end C1995 as the fastest growing software company in history (based on first year sales). By using the Mosaic web browser software as its guide, Netscape created and freely distributed its browser software across the Internet. We believe more than 60% of web surfers use the Netscape browser. Through licensing arrangements with Spyglass, companies such as Microsoft are also rapidly rolling out other browser prod- ucts, for free. Many other companies want to be in the browser game (including America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, Oracle, Sun, Lotus and AT&T). We believe that over time, the market will standardize on one or two browsers — the most likely winners are Netscape and Microsoft. Both compa- nies will likely end up receiving very little money per browser as they build critical mass in an attempt to control the front-end software for the Web. The company that controls the web’s front-end will likely be best positioned to control the server and development tool markets. For now, Netscape has the lead in the browser market, but it’s still too early to tell whether it can dominate the market on an on-going basis. Microsoft’s edge with Windows 95 and Windows NT, combined with its own browser, over time can be a powerful challenge. Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems has been saying for years that “The Network is the Computer,” and with the rapid ramp-up in Internet usage, he’s starting to look spot on. The success of the mainframe created IBM’s market dominance, the argument goes; the rise of the minicom-\n\nMORGAN STANLEY 1-17 This memorandum is based on information available\n\nto the public.

If indeed, the Internet/network is the next computing platform, a host of new dynamic companies will capitalize on it. The reason for the massive investor appetite for shares of Netscape, in our opinion, is that at least for now, it appears that Netscape could be the leader in creating the software plat- form for the Internet. The dominant players in this emerging industry are making strategic bets, building proprietary Internet applications and giving them away to users to gain mass acceptance and try to become the de facto system. Such attempts include Mi- crosoft’s often changing efforts; Adobe’s Acrobat; Mac- romedia’s ShockWave; Netscape’s proprietary HTML ex- tensions and SSL/Secure Courier; Sun’s Java; electronic payment systems from DigiCash, First Virtual, and Cyber- Cash; Xing Technology’s StreamWorks, Progressive Net- works’ RealAudio, VocalTec’s Internet Phone, Paper’s VRML, World’s VRML+. This type of positioning by software companies is what creates long-term opportunities for “annuities” as proprietary implementations become standards. We will watch carefully as these “standards” emerge. Enterprise and Networking Software The Internet’s potential for fundamentally restructuring the computing industry is more apparent and imminent in the enterprise space than in others. In short, the Internet repre- sents the next application development platform and ubiquitous access to applications regardless of location. The impact on the enterprise will be as significant, if not more so, than the previous platform shifts (mainframe to mini to PC). What’s at stake is a battle for application de- velopers. For the first time, developers will have a stan- dard, cross-platform GUI with fairly well-defined pro- gramming interfaces. Universal access to the Web and an uncharacteristically uniform desktop environment in the form of Web browsers have created an attractive volume market for developers that, heretofore, has only been matched by Microsoft DOS and Windows environments. The volume market for developers has been controlled by Microsoft for nearly a decade. HTML, Java, and related families of emerging development tools based on these standards represent a chance to break away from the Micro- soft stranglehold and still reach the Windows market. HTML is a cross-platform page description language in the public domain. Enhanced scripting language with sophisti- cated logical constructs that complement HTML will emerge from another generation of tools companies. Likewise, many existing development tools vendors will license Java and incorporate HTML generation into their current tool sets. No doubt, for the Web, Microsof"
