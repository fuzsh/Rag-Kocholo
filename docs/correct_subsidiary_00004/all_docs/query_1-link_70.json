        "text": "Columns\n\nQ&A\n\nSrivats Sampath, vice president of product marketing for the Server Product Division at Netscape Communications Corp., is responsible for managing the overall product strategy for Netscape SuiteSpot servers and for growing the Intranet market. He recently spoke with Ameet Patel, Contributing Editor of AD Trends.\n\nSrivats Simpath\n\nQ. Can you define Netscape's business strategy for the next year? Where do you see Intranets going? As well as, I have heard a lot of things that the Extranets is really the next wave after Intranets.\n\nSS. Let me give you a little quick historical perspective. We started in 1995, which is around the time the whole Web revolution happened, where the Internet protocols have made the standards, and took the world by storm. In 1996, we saw these technologies come into the corporations. Browsing was suddenly very applicable within the company for creating and consuming content. For the first time in the short history of computing, we found that the protocols of the services that ran inside the company were the same ones that ran outside the company. Suddenly, the doors opened on building applications that bridged the company with their customers, their vendors, and their partners.\n\nIf you remember back a few years, the big automotive companies tried to do EDI, right? But EDI was basically a band-aid solution. Companies would route their own proprietary protocols; there would be multiple different document formats; it was just a mess. And as you can see EDI never took off.\n\nBut with the Internet, now we all agree on a standard set of protocols, we all agreed on a standard way to render a document (which is HTML), and we all agree on a standard way to write an application, and that is using Java.\n\nThe walls are coming down between the customers, partners, vendors, and suppliers because of the standardization of the technology.\n\nQ. What kinds of applications do you find your customers are building?\n\nA. The one interesting trend, is the ability to support both internal and external customers. For example, Netscape has implemented an internal home site for HR. We go to HR, to a place that says \"Forms\". There is a change of address form, 401K form, and so on it. We click on it and get an HTML form. We fill it in, hit a button, and at the backend it automatically updates the database. You can do this from anywhere in the world.\n\nAnother example of this is a job posting system that allows managers to post jobs and allows people with browsers who are coming in to take a look at this to look at what jobs are available and to apply for them on-line. Another example is expense reports. When I was at Comdex on the road, I filled out the expense report, hit a button, and bank, it's gone. These applications just make you more productive.\n\nWe recently launched a program called AppFoundry on the Netscape web site. It is a collection of applications written by our partners, and we have source code with them. In the first six weeks, we had something like 20,000 downloads.\n\nI'll tell you why this marketplace has seen such a rapid pace of acceptance. In the client/server world you've got the server all done and then you had to go deploy the client physically on every desktop. Typically you would do it through Windows and then the Mac people would get extremely angry and then the Unix people, you never even thought that they existed. It takes a long time to roll out a client/server application for 20,000 people. With Network-centric applications, the rollout is instantaneous.\n\nThe Netscape homepage is, for example, actually a complete application. There are Java applets in there; there's JavaScript code running behind it; there is HTML script, all that stuff. It is a full blown application with a database backend. And we update that application almost on a daily basis.\n\nWe have 3.5 million people who come visit our site every day and spend an average of nine minutes on that site. So the application deployment is instantaneous. In fact, one of our customers said, \"This is one of those few cases where I have five people testing the application at 8 in the morning., and I can have 5,000 people using it by 5 in the evening.\"\n\nQ. Recently at Comdex, you announced your Constellation product. What is its importance to your future strategy?\n\nA. The four things that we allow you to do today with our product is one is to create information, second is to consume information, third is to communicate, and fourth is to collaborate. That is what communicators are, those are the four C's.\n\nNow, with the breaking down of the barriers, the user is privy to information from all over the world, gigabytes and in some cases terabytes of information. If you are the knowledge worker and if your business is to be information aware, as I call it, the distant metaphors of application and going looking for it no longer hold true. You need to have some very smart ways by which, information comes to you. So we undertook an initiative called Constellation, which right now is a technology initiative.\n\nNow, with Gigabytes of this information coming your way we wanted to find ways by which you could set up filters, channels or views, of the kind of information you wanted to see. So that's what it is, it is a productivity add-on that allows you to be more effective at getting information or getting to the right information. Whether it will manifest itself as a component or communicator is still to be decided. We are in a very early stage.\n\nQ. My understanding of Constellation is that it could make the operating system environment sort of mute. I know that Microsoft is planning to bundle Explorer within the operating system environment. Communicator acts as a shell on top of the operating system and sort of abstracts away the OS so that you are not OS specific. Is that understanding correct?\n\nA. No, that is not right. What it is, like I said, it allows you to be productive. If you have seen Communicator, there is a toolbar for mail, for the browser, for Collabra, for Composer, and so on. There will also be a button for Constellation. A lot of people will choose to live in the native operating system view. Some people will choose to live in their E-mail. That is primarily what they do. I live in my E-mail all day because that is where I do most of my work. But there are some people, knowledge workers, or information workers who will choose to click on Constellation and get that view of their information. The native windows desktop is just a click away.\n\nIt is not our intention to replace Windows or any of the operating system. Our intention is to provide a component to Communicator that allows people to get the information easier than they would have normally.\n\nQ. About Microsoft's Explorer and IIS strategy: What are some of your key differentiators that cause your customers to pick SuiteSpot's servers.?\n\nA. That is a very good question. We have ten servers. We have Enterprise server, which is our high end content management and Web server. We have Media server, which is our low-bandwith streaming audio server. We have a Messaging server, our enterprise-class SMTP/Pop 3 class messaging server. We have Collabra server, an NNTP-based based discussion server. We have Catalog server, basically an indexing and a cataloging system for all the documents that you create. There is an LDAP server which provides LDAP-based directory support. We have Proxy server for all the proxy stuff."
