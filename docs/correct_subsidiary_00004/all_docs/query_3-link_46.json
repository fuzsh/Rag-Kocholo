Details about risks affecting various aspects of our business are\n\ndiscussed throughout this Form 10-K. Investors should read all of these risks\n\ncarefully, and should pay particular attention to risks affecting the following\n\nareas: competition (page 15); our strategy and implementation with respect to\n\nthe Internet and our Internet-based businesses, including but not limited to our\n\nability to operationally support and manage these new businesses (page 8); the\n\ntiming of availability for future products and services, including availability\n\nof our online payroll service (pages 9 and 13); market growth, sales of new\n\nproducts and customer upgrade rates, including but not limited to sales and\n\nupgrade rates for our new QuickBooks(R) multi-user product (pages 9 and 13); the\n\nvalue and size of our equity investments in other companies, including Checkfree\n\nCorporation and Excite, Inc.

We provide a range of small\n\nbusiness accounting, tax preparation and consumer finance desktop software,\n\nfinancial supplies (such as computer checks, envelopes and invoices), and\n\nInternet products for individuals and small businesses. Our products and\n\nservices include QuickBooks(R), the leading small business accounting software;\n\nTurboTax(R), the leading personal tax preparation software; our popular\n\nProSeries(R) and Lacerte(TM) professional tax products; Quicken(R), the leading\n\npersonal finance software; and the Quicken.com(SM) website, one of the fastest\n\ngrowing online financial sites on the Internet. Our revenues come primarily from\n\nthe United States, Japan, Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom. We sell\n\nproducts through retail distribution channels and direct sales to customers, as\n\nwell as through electronic distribution channels such as our Quicken Store\n\nwebsite.\n\nThe Internet is a pervasive force that has reshaped our business and is\n\nproviding new opportunities and challenges. We recently made some major changes\n\nto our business strategy to capitalize on these opportunities. While desktop\n\nsoftware and related products and services still provide most of our revenue,\n\nour Internet-based businesses are growing rapidly, and the Internet has become\n\nan integral part of our business strategy in all of our business divisions. In\n\naddition, we intend to provide a broader range of products and services targeted\n\nat the small business community, a market that we believe has significant growth\n\npotential.\n\nWe are currently focusing our strategic efforts in three directions. First, we\n\nhave added Internet connectivity to our tax, small business and personal finance\n\ndesktop software. Second, we have created, and are substantially expanding, new\n\nInternet-based resources and businesses in order to establish Intuit as a\n\npremier provider of personal and business financial information and services on\n\nthe Internet. Third, we are expanding our small business offerings.\n\n3\n\nOur primary business objective during fiscal 1998 was to make progress on the\n\nthree strategic efforts described above, while still delivering solid financial\n\nperformance to our stockholders. These are some of our major events for fiscal\n\n1998:\n\n- - Increased traffic, service offerings and aggregated content on our\n\nQuicken.com personal finance website, through strategically important\n\ndistribution relationships, continuing product and service development\n\nand the launch of marketspaces for mortgages and auto insurance\n\n- - Launched the first multi-user version of our QuickBooks Pro(R) small\n\nbusiness accounting software\n\n- - Expanded one of our most profitable business areas through the\n\nacquisition of Lacerte and its professional tax software product line\n\n(financed by a public offering of 10 million shares of Common Stock)\n\n- - Initiated a new focus on employer services for small businesses, with\n\nthe development of our online payroll service that we introduced on a\n\nlimited basis in September 1998\n\n- - Returned to profitability in our Quicken desktop business\n\n- - Improved our focus in strategically important areas by selling our\n\nParsons subsidiary\n\nAlthough fiscal 1998 was a successful year for Intuit in many respects, we\n\ncontinue to face significant challenges and risks. For example, our\n\ninternational operations had a disappointing year relative to our expectations,\n\nour Internet businesses are requiring significant levels of investment, and\n\ncompetition is intensifying, particularly for TurboTax and our Internet\n\nproducts. We encourage you to read the entire Form 10-K carefully to better\n\nunderstand our business and our financial results, and the risks and\n\nuncertainties we face.\n\nSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\n\nStrategic Internet Distribution Relationships with Excite, America Online and\n\nCNNfn. In June 1997, we entered into an agreement with Excite Inc. to jointly\n\ndevelop, promote and distribute a new online financial channel now called Excite\n\nMoney and Investing by Quicken.com. The channel debuted in early fiscal 1998. We\n\nare the exclusive provider and aggregator of personal financial content for all\n\nof Excite's Internet services, and we share revenue from the channel with\n\nExcite. See Note 5 of the financial statement notes (page 50) for more details.\n\nIn February 1998, we announced a three-year agreement with AOL under which\n\nIntuit is the exclusive provider, subject to certain limited exceptions, of\n\nonline tax preparation and filing, multi-carrier life and auto insurance and\n\nmulti-lender mortgage services on both the AOL service and AOL.com, which is\n\nAOL's default site for Internet access by AOL members. In addition, on AOL.com,\n\nIntuit is the primary source of financial content for the Personal Finance Web\n\nChannel. We have guaranteed payments to AOL totaling $30 million over three\n\nyears, and AOL may also be eligible for additional revenue-sharing after we have\n\nrecovered certain advances and other amounts. See Note 5 of the financial\n\nstatement notes (page 50) for more details.\n\nIn October 1997, we entered into a five-year agreement with CNNfn, a financial\n\nnews website, to create a co-branded personal finance channel. The channel,\n\nwhich launched in December 1997, includes business news and financial\n\ninformation. In exchange for marketing fees paid to CNNfn, we receive a share of\n\ncertain revenues from the site.\n\nOur relationships with Excite, AOL and CNNfn have helped us increase the\n\ncustomer base for our Internet-based products, and we expect this benefit to\n\ncontinue. This should help us attract more financial institutions to participate\n\nin the online financial products that we offer and eventually generate\n\nincreasing revenue for us from a combination of advertising and transaction\n\nfees. During fiscal 1998, page views per month on our Quicken.com website\n\nincreased from 16 million to 90 million. Advertising sales also increased\n\nsignificantly during fiscal 1998, although they are still not material. While we\n\nare encouraged by these results, we can't be certain that these growth levels\n\ncan be sustained. See \"Risks of Internet Commerce,\" on page 8.\n\nAcquisition of Lacerte. On June 22, 1998, we acquired substantially all of the\n\nassets and liabilities of Lacerte Software Corporation and Lacerte Educational\n\nServices Corporation (now called Lacerte Educational Services, Inc.), for a\n\nprice of $400 million in cash. We financed the acquisition with a public\n\noffering of Common Stock in\n\n4\n\nthe fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. See MD&A (page 26) and Notes 3 and 8 of the\n\nfinancial statement notes (pages 49 and 54) for details about the acquisition\n\nand the offering. Lacerte is a leading provider of tax preparation software and\n\nservices for tax professionals. We believe that the acquisition may give us\n\nseveral strategic benefits. First, we believe it will contribute to our\n\nrecurring revenue base, since users of Lacerte's products (like users of our\n\nProSeries tax products), must purchase annual updates that reflect changes in\n\ntax law and tax forms. Currently a very high percentage of Lacerte's customers\n\nrenew their licenses each year. Second, Lacerte has been a highly profitable\n\ncompany, and to the extent that we can sustain its profitability, it could make\n\na significant contribution to our earnings. Third, we believe that the\n\nacquisition will enable us to compete more effectively with other large\n\nproviders of professional tax preparation software. As the complexity of\n\nprofessional tax products increases, our annual cost of producing and supporting\n\nthese products also increases. We believe it is important to expand our customer\n\nbase and sales volume in order to improve our competitive position, and Lacerte\n\nhad approximately 30,000 customers as of March 31, 1998. Fourth, we expect the\n\nacquisition to strengthen our presence in the professional income tax compliance\n\nmarket. Although the Intuit ProSeries product line and Lacerte's product line\n\nare both designed for tax professionals, they function differently and can\n\nprovide complementary solutions for different practitioner preferences.\n\nOur acquisition of Lacerte poses a number of risks that could adversely affect\n\nour ability to achieve the anticipated benefits. We currently intend to have\n\nLacerte operate as a separate entity, with separate sales and marketing,\n\nresearch and development, customer support and administrative organizations.\n\nThis may create operating inefficiencies and communication difficulties. These\n\nchallenges may be exacerbated by the fact that Lacerte is located in Texas,\n\nwhere we have not had any material operations. The resources required to\n\nestablish relationships with, and procedures for communicating with, Lacerte may\n\naffect our ability to successfully pursue other opportunities for a period of\n\ntime. The departure of key Lacerte employees or significant numbers of Lacerte\n\nemployees, which is a risk with any acquisition, would negatively affect us.\n\nLacerte customers may be uncertain about our plans and ability to support both\n\nLacerte's products and our existing ProSeries software, and this could hinder\n\nour ability to retain these customers, which would negatively affect us. Lacerte\n\nis in the process of a major product line transition that will require\n\nsignificant development efforts. The departure of engineers, or other\n\ndifficulties caused by the acquisition, could hinder Lacerte's ability to\n\nsuccessfully complete this development. If, in the future, Intuit and Lacerte\n\ndecide to integrate their operations, the integration could present a number of\n\nrisks and divert management's attention from other matters.\n\nWe assumed substantially all of the liabilities related to Lacerte's business\n\nwith the exception of certain tax liabilities. If unanticipated liabilities are\n\ndiscovered later, we will likely have to satisfy those liabilities, which could\n\nhave a material adverse effect on our operating results. The acquisition\n\nresulted in a one-time charge for in-process research and development of $53.8\n\nmillion in fiscal 1998 and will result in $358.2 million of amortization\n\nexpenses over the next three to five years. See MD&A, page 33, and Note 3 of the\n\nfinancial statement notes (page 49), for a more detailed discussion of the\n\nfinancial impact of the Lacerte acquisition.\n\nOther Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures. During the past few years we made\n\nseveral other acquisitions to expand our business more rapidly in selected\n\nareas, and we have sold businesses that no longer support our corporate\n\nstrategy. We acquired two Japanese companies that make small business accounting\n\nsoftware, and two companies that have been important to the growth of our\n\nQuicken.com website. We sold our banking and bill payment processing subsidiary\n\n(Intuit Services Corporation) and our direct marketing consumer software\n\nsubsidiary (Parsons) to allow us to increase our focus in strategically\n\nimportant areas. These transactions have had, and will continue to have, a\n\nsignificant impact on our financial results, and they may make period-to-period\n\ncomparisons of our financial results less meaningful. For more details about\n\nthese transactions and their impact, see Notes 3 and 4 of the financial\n\nstatement notes, beginning on page 48.\n\nWhile we believe our recent acquisitions were in the best interests of Intuit\n\nand its stockholders, there are significant risks associated with these\n\ntransactions. The acquisitions have expanded our size, product lines, personnel\n\nand geographic locations. Our ability to integrate and organize these new\n\nbusinesses has required improvements in our operational, financial and\n\nmanagement information systems, and further improvements will be necessary to\n\naddress issues presented by growth through acquisitions. Our acquisitions have\n\nalso resulted in significant amortization expenses, including amortization of\n\npurchased software (reflected in cost of goods sold) and amortization of\n\n5\n\ngoodwill and purchased intangibles (reflected in operating expenses), as well\n\nas charges for purchased research and development. These expenses have had a\n\nnegative impact on our operating results, resulting in a reduction in net income\n\nof $46.5 million in fiscal 1996, $34.6 million in fiscal 1997 and $44.3 million\n\nin fiscal 1998. Based on acquisitions completed as of July 31, 1998, future\n\namortization will reduce net income (after tax) by approximately $78.5 million,\n\n$72.8 million and $61.6 million for the years ending July 31, 1999 through 2001,\n\nrespectively. If we complete additional acquisitions in the future, there could\n\nbe an incremental negative impact on operating results. See MD&A, pages 32-33.\n\nWeb-based Finance Joint Venture. In May 1998, we participated in the formation\n\nof a joint venture company, Venture Finance Software Corp. (\"VFSC\") that is\n\ndeveloping certain Web-oriented finance products. In exchange for our equity\n\ninterest in VFSC, we granted VFSC licenses to certain technology and\n\nintellectual property rights. VFSC is receiving cash funding from other\n\ninvestors. Affiliates of Morgan Stanley & Co Incorporated are the principal\n\ninvestors in the joint venture company. In addition, of the $46 million\n\npotential funding for VFSC, venture capital funds managed by Kleiner Perkins\n\nCaufield & Byers, of which L. John Doerr, a director of Intuit, is a general\n\npartner, have agreed to invest up to $1 million. We have agreed with VFSC not to\n\ncompete in certain areas of server-based personal finance for a period of ten\n\nyears. Intuit is managing the development and commercialization efforts of the\n\njoint venture. We have an option to purchase the equity interests of the other\n\ninvestors in VFSC between two and four years after the formation of VFSC. The\n\nprice to exercise this option would be substantial, and we will also have\n\nongoing amortization expenses if we exercise the option. There are many\n\ntechnological risks involved in the development of Web-oriented finance\n\nproducts, and we can't be certain that the development will be successful or\n\nthat we will exercise the purchase option. See MD&A (page 33) and Note 5 of the\n\nfinancial statement notes (page 50) for more details about this transaction.\n\nCORPORATE BACKGROUND\n\nIntuit began operations in March 1983 and was incorporated in California in\n\nMarch 1984. In March 1993, we reincorporated in Delaware and completed our\n\ninitial public offering. Our principal executive offices are located at 2535\n\nGarcia Avenue, Mountain View, California, 94043, and our telephone number is\n\n(650) 944-6000. When we refer to \"we\" or \"Intuit\" in this Form 10-K, we mean the\n\ncurrent Delaware corporation (Intuit Inc.) and its California predecessor, as\n\nwell as all of our consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIntuit offers products and services through four principal business divisions:\n\n- - SMALL BUSINESS DIVISION: Accounting software, financial supplies,\n\nemployer services and other related services\n\n- - TAX DIVISION: Personal, professional and small business tax preparation\n\nsoftware, electronic tax return filing, web-based tax preparation and\n\nrelated services\n\n- - CONSUMER FINANCE DIVISION: Personal finance software, websites and\n\nmarketspaces and related services\n\n- - INTERNATIONAL DIVISION: Small business, tax and consumer finance\n\nproducts in selected foreign markets\n\nDesktop software and related products and services delivered through traditional\n\nretail and direct sales channels currently provide most of our revenue, and we\n\nexpect this to continue for the foreseeable future. (See MD&A, beginning on page\n\n26, for information about revenues for our principal products.) However, we're\n\nbeginning this description of our products and services with a separate\n\ndiscussion of our Internet-based activities for two reasons. First, the Internet\n\nhas become an integral part of our business strategy in all of our business\n\ndivisions, and consequently, understanding our Internet strategy is necessary\n\nfor understanding each of the business divisions we have described on pages\n\n9-12. Second, we are providing separate information about our Internet\n\nbusinesses because investors have requested this type of analysis. However, we\n\ndo not have a separate \"Internet\" division within the company. We manage our\n\ncompany, and review our internal financial results, based on the four business\n\ndivisions identified above.\n\n6\n\nINTERNET COMMERCE\n\nOverview. The Internet is a pervasive force that has fundamentally changed the\n\nway we do business. It is becoming increasingly important to all of our business\n\ndivisions, both as the foundation for new products and services, and as an\n\nincremental, cost-effective distribution channel. For example, the Internet is\n\nthe foundation for our insurance and mortgage marketspaces, the online payroll\n\nservice for small businesses that we recently introduced, our Quicken Store\n\nwebsite where customers can purchase and download desktop software products and\n\nobtain customer service, and our technical support website where we can quickly\n\nand cost-effectively provide patches for product bugs and provide customers with\n\nanswers to frequently asked questions.\n\nWe use the term Internet commerce to refer to all of our Internet-based business\n\nactivities. Internet commerce has two components: Internet products and\n\nelectronic distribution. Internet products include activities where the customer\n\nrealizes the value of the goods or services directly on the Internet or an\n\nIntuit server. Internet product revenues include, for example, advertising\n\nrevenues generated on our Quicken.com website, online tax preparation and\n\nelectronic filing revenues, and transaction and processing fees from our online\n\ninsurance and online mortgage services. Electronic distribution includes\n\nrevenues generated by electronic ordering and/or delivery of traditional desktop\n\nsoftware products and financial supplies.\n\nBusiness Opportunities. The Internet enables consumers to have greater\n\nconfidence in making financial decisions by providing them up-to-date,\n\npersonalized financial information quickly and inexpensively. In addition, the\n\nInternet enables financial service firms offering complex financial products to\n\nreach new customers in a cost-effective manner. These trends create some\n\ncompelling business opportunities, and we believe Intuit is in a position to\n\ntake advantage of these opportunities for several reasons. First, we have\n\nexpertise in building technical systems that simplify complex financial matters\n\nfor consumers and small businesses. Second, we have a large base of financially\n\nsophisticated customers. Third, we have strong brand name recognition and\n\nloyalty. Our objective is to use these strengths to establish Intuit as a\n\npremier provider of personal and business financial information and services on\n\nthe Internet.\n\nStrategy and Implementation. There are four main components to our Internet\n\nstrategy:\n\n- - Invest in new, entirely Web-based businesses\n\n- - Integrate online, Web-based resources into our desktop software products\n\n- - Put desktop software functionality onto the Internet\n\n- - Increase our presence on the Internet by establishing strategic\n\ndistribution relationships and improving brand awareness for our\n\nInternet offerings\n\nDuring fiscal 1998, we made significant progress in implementing our Internet\n\nstrategy. We launched QuickenMortgage(SM), our consumer mortgage service, in\n\nNovember 1997, and expanded the scope and depth of our InsureMarket(R) site.\n\nMany of our desktop products released during fiscal 1998 have direct links to\n\nQuicken.com and have embedded Web \"browser\" software to simplify Web access. We\n\nexpanded the software tools and financial information available on our\n\nQuicken.com website. We launched our Web TurboTax online tax preparation service\n\n(formerly TurboTax Online) in February 1998, and our Web-based electronic filing\n\nfor our desktop and online tax products. We established important relationships\n\nwith leading Internet media companies (such as Excite), online services\n\nproviders (such as America Online) and Internet-based financial networks (such\n\nas CNNfn).\n\nWe currently measure the success of our Internet activities in a variety of\n\nways, including the following four measures:\n\n- - Revenues. Revenues from Internet commerce more than doubled during the\n\npast fiscal year.\n\n- - Page views. Monthly page views for our Quicken.com site (measured\n\ninternally by Intuit) increased from 16 million at the end of fiscal\n\n1997 to 90 million at the end of fiscal 1998.\n\n- - Reach. Household reach, as measured by Media Metrix, increased from 2.4%\n\nof Internet households in July 1997 to 4.2% in July 1998.\n\n7\n\n- - Financial institution participation. Participation increased 35% during\n\nfiscal 1998, to more than 50 mutual fund companies, brokerage firms,\n\nlenders and insurance companies that provide products and services\n\nthrough our Quicken.com site.\n\nAlthough we have made significant progress in each of these areas during the\n\npast year, investors should be aware that initial success achieved in these\n\nareas will not necessarily result in improved financial results. We believe that\n\nthe dramatic growth of the Internet and the Web will give us significant\n\nopportunities to grow our revenue over the next several years. However, revenue\n\nfrom Internet commerce was only 8% of our total revenue during fiscal 1998 (6%\n\nfor Internet products and 2% for electronic distribution). Our Internet-related\n\nexpenses have been, and will continue to be, significant. We can't predict if or\n\nwhen Internet commerce will generate meaningful revenue or profits.\n\nRisks of Internet Commerce. We face many risks in pursuing our Internet\n\nstrategy, particularly for our Internet products. The Internet represents a new\n\nbusiness model for Intuit, where revenues come from advertising, marketing,\n\ntransaction and processing fees, instead of software product sales. Website\n\ntraffic is an important foundation for this business model. We have made\n\nsignificant progress in increasing traffic to Quicken.com through our\n\nrelationships with Excite, AOL and others. However, we may need to establish\n\nadditional relationships to help us to increase advertising revenue as well as\n\nto continue increasing traffic. This may be difficult, especially given the\n\nrelatively limited number of leading Internet companies. If our competitors\n\nestablish relationships with these companies (particularly exclusive\n\nrelationships), our ability to expand our Internet businesses could be hindered.\n\nEven if we establish these relationships, we can't be certain that they will\n\nresult in significant increases in revenue.\n\nWe need to quickly and successfully build new skills as a website developer and\n\npublisher, which are complementary but different skills from desktop software\n\ndevelopment skills. In particular, development cycles for Web-based products are\n\nextremely short and irregular, while desktop software products generally have\n\nmuch longer and more predictable development and release cycles. We must\n\ncontinue to develop new and continually evolving operational infrastructures to\n\nsupport and manage our Internet-based businesses and the complex operational\n\nrequirements of our strategic Internet relationships. The rapid pace of change\n\nin this area creates unique risks, and we may be unable to manage costs\n\neffectively and/or to meet customer expectations.\n\nWe face intense competition for our Internet products. In several businesses,\n\nthere are very low barriers to entry, and the market is extremely fragmented,\n\nmaking it difficult for any one company to acquire the scale that is necessary\n\n(although not, by itself, sufficient) to begin generating any meaningful revenue\n\nor profits. Many of our competitors are either large companies that can afford\n\nmajor investments in these businesses, or small privately held companies that\n\ncan benefit from a much narrower product focus than Intuit, and whose\n\nshareholders will tolerate significant and extended operating losses.\n\nCustomers may refuse to transact business over the Internet due to privacy or\n\nsecurity concerns. We can't be certain that consumers' use of the Internet,\n\nparticularly for commercial transactions, will continue to increase as rapidly\n\nas it has during the past few years. If Internet use does not grow as a result\n\nof privacy or security concerns, or for other reasons, our Internet-based\n\nbusinesses would be seriously adversely affected.\n\nIn September 1996, we decided to move from a proprietary electronic\n\ncommunications link between our software and financial institutions, to an\n\nInternet-based link based on a standard called Open Financial Exchange (referred\n\nto as \"OFX\"). To some degree, expansion of our desktop product connectivity\n\ninitiatives depends on industry adoption of OFX as a connectivity standard.\n\nWhile we believe that OFX is the right strategic approach for Intuit, we face\n\nrisks and challenges in implementing it. Financial institutions may not accept\n\nand implement OFX as rapidly as we would like, or they may adopt alternative\n\nconnectivity standards that may not support interoperability with OFX. If OFX is\n\nnot adopted by many financial institutions, we may need to incur significant\n\nexpenses to alter our products to conform to other evolving standards.\n\nBecause our Internet-based products are available in many states and foreign\n\ncountries, we may be subject to regulation and taxation in many additional\n\njurisdictions. Also, to the extent that states or foreign countries are\n\n8\n\ngenerally successful in their efforts to impose taxes on Internet commerce, the\n\ngrowth of the use of the Internet could slow substantially, which could have an\n\nadverse effect on the growth of our Internet-based businesses. If Internet\n\nactivity becomes heavily regulated in other respects, that could have major\n\nnegative consequences for our Internet-based businesses.\n\nSMALL BUSINESS DIVISION\n\nWe believe that the small business market provides excellent opportunities for\n\ngrowing our business, both through increasing our customer base and through\n\nincreasing the range of offerings we provide to small business customers.\n\nExpanding our small business offerings is one of our primary strategic\n\nobjectives. These are the major products and services offered by our Small\n\nBusiness Division:\n\nQuickBooks and QuickBooks Pro Software. Our QuickBooks product line brings\n\nextensive bookkeeping capabilities to small business users in an easy-to-use\n\ndesign that does not require customers to be familiar with debit/credit\n\naccounting. QuickBooks Pro is an enhanced version of QuickBooks that addresses\n\nthe needs of small businesses in the U.S. that are project, job or time based,\n\nand/or that are looking for a multi-user product.\n\nIn June 1998, we launched version 6.0 of our QuickBooks and QuickBooks Pro\n\nproducts. QuickBooks Pro 6.0 is our first multi-user accounting software\n\nproduct. We think it represents a good business opportunity because the\n\nmulti-user feature has been the most frequent customer request over the past few\n\nyears. However, there are a number of risks we face in capitalizing on this\n\nopportunity. For example, the relatively high price we charge for the multi-user\n\nproduct (approximately $219 per user, with 5-user packs for $600), may make it\n\nmore difficult to persuade retailers to devote generous shelf space to the\n\nproduct and maintain a significant inventory. The product upgrade rate among\n\nexisting customers may be lower than upgrade rates we have experienced with\n\nprior QuickBooks launches because users that don't require a multi-user product\n\nmay choose not to upgrade at this point. In addition, we may have increased\n\ntechnical support costs if users need additional support because of the more\n\ncomplex multi-user features.\n\nFinancial Supplies. We offer a range of financial supplies designed for use with\n\nour small business and consumer finance desktop software products. Supplies\n\ninclude professional-quality paper checks, envelopes, invoices, business forms,\n\ndeposit slips and rubber stamps. In September 1997, we launched a supplies\n\nwebsite to enable customers to order supplies online, which has reduced order\n\nfulfillment costs and increased customer satisfaction. By the end of fiscal\n\n1998, approximately 10% of supplies orders were generated by the website.\n\nSee MD&A, beginning on page 26, for more details.\n\nIn September 1995, we entered into an exclusive five-year contract with John H.\n\nHarland Co. to print all of our check products, which accounted for about 75% of\n\nour supplies revenue in fiscal 1998. We believe our relationship with Harland is\n\nstrong, and the financial terms of the contract are favorable for Intuit.\n\nHowever, if we experience any problems with Harland's performance, it could have\n\na material negative impact on sales of supplies and on Intuit as a whole.\n\nOnline Payroll Service. As part of our focus on expanding our small business\n\nofferings by providing employer services that complement our desktop software,\n\nin September 1998 we introduced a new online payroll service. The service is\n\ncurrently available to a limited number of customers, with broader availability\n\nexpected in December 1998. The service handles all aspects of payroll\n\nprocessing, including calculation and electronic depositing of federal and state\n\npayroll tax withholdings, electronic direct deposit of paychecks, preparation\n\nand filing of quarterly and annual payroll tax returns and creation of employee\n\nW-2s. The service uses payroll data entered by customers into their QuickBooks\n\n6.0 files and transmitted to Intuit electronically, so customer effort is\n\nminimized. While entering this business gives us a significant opportunity to\n\nincrease revenues, there are also risks. It's possible that the expanded\n\navailability of the service may be delayed. In addition, all of the processing\n\nfor these payroll services is performed for Intuit by Computing Resources Inc.\n\n(\"CRI\"), a third party service provider, so our relationship with CRI is crucial\n\nto the success of the service. While CRI has performed payroll processing for\n\nover 20 years, it has historically handled a significantly lower volume than we\n\nmay experience if the subscriptions to the payroll service meet our\n\nexpectations. Since CRI is the sole provider of these processing services, any\n\nfailure of CRI to perform\n\n9\n\nthese services would prevent us from providing payroll services to our customers\n\nuntil a substitute provider could take over CRI's functions, and finding an\n\nalternate provider could be a lengthy process. We expect that customers will\n\nhave very little tolerance for untimely or inaccurately processed payroll\n\ninformation. Failure to provide uninterrupted, accurate services to our\n\ncustomers, whether due to CRI's failure to perform, or any other problem with\n\nthe payroll service, would have a serious impact on our ability to retain\n\ncustomers or attract new customers, could require us to make significant\n\npayments to customers under our service guarantee, and could also give rise to\n\nother customer claims against us. We are also incurring significant start-up\n\ncosts to initiate this service, including costs to establish the operational\n\ninfrastructure to manage and support a service business, which is different from\n\nour traditional desktop software infrastructure. See MD&A, page 26, for more\n\ndetails.\n\nQuickBooks Support Network (\"QBSN\"). QBSN is our fee-for-support program for\n\nQuickBooks users. The program reflects our belief that high-quality customer\n\nsupport tailored to the specific requirements of small businesses can be a\n\nprofitable and strategically important business, rather than simply an operating\n\nexpense. During fiscal 1998, we expanded and refined QBSN to improve the quality\n\nof the services provided.\n\nSmall Business Website. In March 1998, we launched Small Business by\n\nQuicken.com, a website that addresses the specific needs of small businesses.\n\nOur current goal is to build relationships with current and potential small\n\nbusiness customers by providing information, tools and community discussion\n\nopportunities. The site currently offers Quicken Business CashFinder(SM), a tool\n\nto help small businesses obtain loans and to assist financial institutions in\n\nreaching small business customers. The site is a top level channel on Excite,\n\nand is also accessible directly from QuickBooks 6.0 products and our Quicken.com\n\nsite. Small business website revenues come from advertising, sponsorship and\n\ntransaction fees, but they are not expected to be material, or to offset\n\nexpenses of the site, for the foreseeable future.\n\nTAX DIVISION\n\nWe offer a broad range of federal and state tax preparation software for\n\nindividuals, tax professionals and small businesses. Our tax business has been a\n\nfairly predictable source of recurring revenue (with customers buying new\n\nproducts every year), as well as a very seasonal business. These are the major\n\nproducts and services offered by our Tax Division:\n\nPersonal Tax Software. Our TurboTax products (for Windows) and MacInTax(R)\n\nproducts (for the Macintosh) are designed for individual consumers who prepare\n\ntheir own tax returns. Our tax products are designed to be easy to use, but\n\nsophisticated enough for complicated tax returns.\n\nProfessional Tax Software. Our ProSeries and Lacerte tax products are designed\n\nfor tax professionals who prepare individual, business, estate, trust and gift\n\ntax returns for their individual and business clients. We acquired the Lacerte\n\nprofessional tax product line in June 1998. We believe the two product lines\n\nprovide complementary solutions for differing practitioner preferences, with our\n\nProSeries products emphasizing ease-of-use and data entry on government form\n\nfacsimiles, and the Lacerte products emphasizing efficiency and\n\ncustomer-tailored data sheet entry. See \"Acquisition of Lacerte,\" on page 4, for\n\nmore details about the acquisition. Customers can elect to license professional\n\ntax products for a single fee for unlimited annual use or to use them on a\n\n\"pay-per-return\" basis.\n\nSmall Business Tax Software. For small business owners that prepare their own\n\nbusiness tax returns, we offer TurboTax for Business and MacInTax for Business.\n\nTurboTax for Business can import data directly from QuickBooks accounting\n\nsoftware.\n\nElectronic Filing Service. Users of our desktop tax software can file their\n\nfederal (and many state) tax returns electronically through our proprietary\n\nelectronic filing center. The total number of electronically filed returns for\n\nall of our tax products rose significantly from fiscal 1997 to fiscal 1998.\n\nWeb-Based Tax Preparation Service. In February 1998, we launched Web TurboTax\n\n(formerly called TurboTax Online), a Web-based interactive tax preparation\n\nsolution that allowed individual taxpayers to prepare and electronically file\n\ntheir Form 1040A and Form 1040EZ federal income tax returns entirely online. We\n\nhave not\n\n10\n\nexperienced any significant technical problems with our Web-based electronic\n\nfiling or online tax preparation products. However, the dramatic increase in\n\ndemand for tax preparation and electronic filing during the last week of the tax\n\nseason increases the risk of possible problems. Because of the time sensitivity\n\nfor filing tax returns, any future problems could cause serious financial and\n\npublic relations consequences.\n\nIn August 1998, we announced the Quicken Tax Freedom Project, a philanthropic\n\npublic service initiative under which we plan to provide online tax preparation\n\nand electronic filing at no charge to lower income federal and state tax filers,\n\nspecifically those with adjusted gross incomes of $20,000 or less. Intuit will\n\nprovide the service through our Web TurboTax product beginning in January 1999.\n\nWe don't expect that this service will have a material impact on our revenues\n\nfrom our desktop or online tax products, as the average income of our current\n\ncustomers and their clients is well above the $20,000 income threshold.\n\nCONSUMER FINANCE DIVISION\n\nAs indicated below, the Internet had a profound effect in the Consumer Finance\n\nDivision, which was responsible for most of our Internet products during fiscal\n\n1998. These are the major products and services offered by our Consumer Finance\n\nDivision:\n\nQuicken Software. Our Quicken desktop software products help users organize,\n\nunderstand and manage their personal finances by providing easy methods for\n\nrecording and categorizing various types of financial transactions. For example,\n\nQuicken enables customers to reconcile checking and savings accounts, record\n\ncredit card purchases and payments, and track cash, investments, mortgages and\n\nother assets and liabilities. Our latest Quicken products incorporate a number\n\nof Web integration features, such as direct links to relevant portions of\n\nQuicken.com, an embedded Web browser, online banking and bill payment functions,\n\nand a feature that allows customers of participating brokerage firms to download\n\nbrokerage account data and execute securities trades through their broker's\n\nwebsite. We just launched our Quicken '99 product line in September 1998, five\n\nweeks ahead of our traditional late October release date. The product line\n\nincludes a new bundled product called Quicken Financial Center, which includes\n\nboth Quicken Deluxe and TurboTax Deluxe.\n\nOnline Transactions. Quicken includes an online banking feature that allows\n\nusers to download transaction and account information from participating\n\nfinancial institutions directly into their Quicken accounts. We also offer\n\nonline bill payment through Quicken, with services provided by Checkfree or\n\nparticipating financial institutions. Online revenues come primarily from\n\nadvertising and marketing fees paid by participating financial institutions.\n\nQuicken.com. Quicken.com is our personal finance website. It's designed to\n\nenable people to make better financial decisions and perform financial tasks\n\nmore easily by giving them useful tools, software applications, resources and\n\nobjective information about a variety of personal finance topics, in one\n\nlocation. (Quicken.com also has offerings designed for small businesses - see\n\n\"Small Business Website\" on page 10.) Quicken.com includes \"channels\" for\n\nInvestments, Tax, Insurance, Home/Mortgage and other financial areas.\n\nQuicken.com content is created by Intuit and by third party publishers and\n\nfinancial experts. We do not currently charge customers a fee to access\n\nQuicken.com, but we receive revenue from financial institutions and other\n\ncompanies that advertise and/or sell their products or services on Quicken.com.\n\nQuicken.com includes our Quicken InsureMarket and QuickenMortgage marketspaces.\n\nMarketspaces help buyers find the financial products and services they are\n\nseeking, and help providers of financial products and services find new\n\ncustomers. Our Quicken InsureMarket site enables customers to shop for insurance\n\nproducts online. Users can currently apply for and purchase term life insurance\n\nfrom ten national carriers. Auto insurance is currently available from one\n\ncarrier in eleven states, and we expect to expand the number of carriers and\n\nstates during fiscal 1999. Our QuickenMortgage site allows consumers to shop for\n\nhome mortgages online. Users can currently pre-qualify for, and apply for,\n\nmortgages from eleven lenders nationwide. We receive initial implementation\n\nfees, ongoing annual participation fees and transaction-based fees from\n\ninsurance carriers and lenders who participate in these marketspaces, and some\n\nparticipating institutions also pay us fees for data processing and other\n\nadministrative services. We rely on a single third party to perform the back-end\n\nprocessing services for our QuickenMortgage site. Failure of that party to\n\nperform these services would require us to discontinue certain aspects of our\n\nmortgage\n\n11\n\nservice until an alternative service provider could be located. This would have\n\na serious negative impact on the performance of the QuickenMortgage marketspace.\n\nWe believe the long-term success of Quicken.com will depend on our ability to\n\nbuild scale rapidly, which will require us to increase our customer base as\n\nquickly as possible, get greater participation by financial institutions and\n\nexpand the depth and breadth of offerings on the site. We believe that the\n\ninvestments channel is the most important site for increasing advertising and\n\nsponsorship participation by financial institutions, since it tends to attract\n\nrelatively more affluent, financially savvy consumers that financial\n\ninstitutions are seeking for their products and services. Accordingly, expansion\n\nof the investments channel content, both through internal development and the\n\nacquisition of third party content, has been and will continue to be a high\n\npriority. For our marketspaces, participation by financial institutions involves\n\na greater commitment than purchasing advertising, but the marketspaces allow\n\nparticipants to focus on a very specific group of consumers who are already\n\nactively seeking the products and services they offer. Although we have devoted\n\nsignificant internal resources to marketspace development efforts, our progress\n\nin certain areas has been hampered by technological and other challenges\n\ninvolved in working with large financial institutions. To supplement our\n\ninternal development efforts, we will also consider acquisitions of, and\n\nstrategic relationships with, third parties that have technology to enable us to\n\nexpand our marketspaces more rapidly.\n\nINTERNATIONAL DIVISION\n\nOur International Division is divided into three regions: Japan, Europe and\n\nAsia/Pacific. The recent performance of our international operations has been\n\ndisappointing relative to our expectations. In response, we have restructured\n\ncertain operations to make them more efficient, and we have narrowed our\n\nstrategic focus to fewer products (primarily small business products) in fewer\n\nmarkets. We are also investing resources to create personal finance websites in\n\nCanada, the United Kingdom and Germany. We do not expect significant growth in\n\nour International Division during fiscal 1999.\n\nJapan Region. Our Intuit KK subsidiary in Japan currently offers small business\n\nproducts developed by Milkyway KK (acquired in January 1996) and Nihom Micom\n\n(acquired in March 1997) that address the upper and middle segments of the small\n\nbusiness market in Japan. Fiscal 1998 results were negatively affected by\n\nincreasing competition in the high end of the small business accounting market\n\nand our late entry into the market for high-end Windows products, as well as\n\nadverse economic conditions in Japan and in Asia generally. We are refocusing\n\nour efforts on the lower end of the small business market, which we are\n\naddressing with a localized version of QuickBooks launched in September 1998.\n\nHowever, the economic conditions and currency exchange rates may continue to\n\nhave an impact.\n\nEurope Region. We serve selected European markets and South Africa with\n\nlocalized versions of our products through our offices in Germany, France and\n\nthe United Kingdom. During fiscal 1998, we restructured our European region to\n\ncentralize management operations in Munich. We also outsourced all European\n\ncustomer service, technical support, manufacturing and order fulfillment\n\nfunctions to third party vendors. With our new focus on small business products\n\nin selected larger markets, we are devoting fewer resources to consumer finance\n\nand tax products, and to smaller geographic markets.\n\nAsia/Pacific Region. Our Asia/Pacific region includes Canada, Australia, Latin\n\nAmerica, Hong Kong and other parts of Southeast Asia. We offer Quicken in\n\nCanada, Australia, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore, as well as several\n\nLatin American countries. We offer QuickBooks in Canada, Australia and Hong\n\nKong. We also offer our QuickTax(TM) personal and professional tax products in\n\nCanada and Australia. Our Canadian operations enjoyed more success in fiscal\n\n1998 than our other international operations, in terms of both growth and\n\nprofitability.\n\nSpecial Risks for International Operations. Developing and localizing products\n\nfor foreign markets is more time-consuming and costly than developing products\n\nfor the U.S. market. Recruiting and retaining talented software engineers and\n\nmanagers can be more difficult in our international offices as well. Delays or\n\nother problems in product launches may be more likely because of these factors,\n\nand we experienced significant product launch delays in fiscal 1996 and fiscal\n\n1998. Economic conditions in international markets can also negatively affect\n\nour\n\n12\n\nbusiness, as they did in Japan in fiscal 1998 and in Europe in fiscal 1996.\n\nOur international revenue and expenses are currently denominated in a variety of\n\nforeign currencies and are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\nWe don't currently engage in any hedging activities. Although currency\n\nfluctuations have not had a significant negative impact in the past, this could\n\nchange in the future if our international operations grow. Other risks that\n\ncould have a negative impact on our international operations include unexpected\n\nchanges in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers; longer\n\naccounts receivable payment cycles and collection difficulties; the burden of\n\ncomplying with a wide variety of foreign laws; possible adverse tax consequences\n\nincluding repatriation of earnings; and potentially less protection for our\n\nintellectual property rights under foreign laws.\n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n\nA primary goal of our development efforts is to design products and services\n\nthat will appeal to our large existing customer base as well as to new\n\ncustomers. For existing customers we focus on both upgrades of products they\n\nalready own, and new, complementary products and services. We also focus on\n\nproducts that generate recurring revenue, such as our tax preparation products,\n\nfinancial supplies and our online payroll service. While much of our product\n\ndevelopment is done internally, we supplement our internal development efforts\n\nby acquiring strategically important products and technology from third parties,\n\nor establishing other relationships that enable us to expand our business more\n\nrapidly.\n\nDuring the past few years, we have devoted significant resources to developing\n\nand expanding new products and services, including our multi-user QuickBooks Pro\n\nproduct, and Internet products such as QuickenMortgage and our online payroll\n\nservice. Our total research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue\n\nwere 14% in fiscal 1996, 16% in fiscal 1997 and 18% in fiscal 1998. Hiring and\n\nretaining highly qualified technical employees is critical to the success of our\n\ndevelopment efforts, particularly in new product areas, and we face intense\n\ncompetition for these employees.\n\nThe expansion of our Internet-based products has had a significant impact on our\n\ndevelopment process. Our desktop software products tend to have a fairly\n\npredictable, structured development cycle of about 12-24 months. Once new\n\nproducts are released, they generally are not modified (except to fix \"bugs\")\n\nuntil the next scheduled product upgrade. The development process for\n\nInternet-based products is much more rapid, much less predictable, and has much\n\nshorter development cycles . Getting products and services launched quickly is\n\ncrucial to competitive success, but this time pressure may result in lower\n\nproduct quality. Once launched, Internet-based offerings must be continuously\n\nand rapidly updated to incorporate changing technology and customer demands, as\n\nwell as to fix bugs. In addition, Internet-based products must address customer\n\nconcerns about privacy and security. We currently incorporate a variety of\n\nsecurity measures into our products and services, and we are developing a\n\ncustomer information privacy policy. However, a major breach of customer privacy\n\nor security could have serious consequences for us.\n\nThe development process for our products and services is complex and involves\n\nsome risks. Product and service launches can be delayed for a variety of\n\nreasons. Products may have \"bugs\" that hinder product performance, give\n\ncustomers incorrect results and/or damage customer data. These problems can be\n\nexpensive to fix, particularly if we need to do a major maintenance release or\n\npay refunds to customers. They can also result in higher technical support costs\n\nand lost customers.\n\nThe development of tax preparation software presents a unique challenge because\n\nof the demanding annual development cycle required to incorporate tax law\n\nchanges each year. Tax law change issues also affect our tax table service and\n\nour payroll service. We can't predict how complex the tax law changes will be\n\neach year, when the changes will be made, or when tax forms included in the\n\nproducts will be available from the IRS and state tax agencies. The rigid\n\ndevelopment timetable increases the risk of errors in the products. Although\n\nfiscal 1998 and 1997 tax product quality was high, in fiscal 1996 we had product\n\ndefects that led to negative publicity, customer dissatisfaction and incremental\n\noperating expenses. We guarantee the accuracy of the tax calculations performed\n\nby our federal personal tax products and we have agreed to reimburse any\n\npenalties paid by a consumer customer to the Internal Revenue Service solely as\n\na result of miscalculation on a form prepared using our personal tax products.\n\nIf\n\n13\n\nthese products contain a calculation error affecting a significant number of\n\nconsumer customers' returns, we could be subject to liability claims and be\n\nrequired to make substantial payments, and our operating results and financial\n\ncondition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe rigid development timetable for tax products also increases the risk of a\n\nproduct launch delay. Since the tax return preparation season is brief, it is\n\nimperative that we release tax products as early as possible. A late release in\n\nany year could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a\n\ncompetitive product for that year's tax season, making it more difficult for us\n\nto sell our products to those customers in future tax seasons.\n\nMARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nMARKETS\n\nThe markets that we compete in, particularly in the Internet area, are\n\ncharacterized by rapidly changing customer demands, continuous technological\n\nchanges and improvements, shifting industry standards and frequent new product\n\nintroductions by other companies. Changes in any of these areas can quickly\n\nrender existing products obsolete, so our marketing success depends on our\n\nability to respond rapidly to these changes with new products and services, as\n\nwell as improvements to existing products and services.\n\nRETAIL DISTRIBUTION\n\nWe market our desktop software in North America through traditional retail\n\nsoftware outlets, computer superstores, office and warehouse clubs and general\n\nmass merchandisers. We also have OEM, or \"original equipment manufacturer,\"\n\nrelationships with hardware and software manufacturers who combine our products\n\nwith their products and sell them to retailers and consumers. Although OEM sales\n\ngenerate little revenue (due to low pricing for OEMs) and reduce operating\n\nmargins in the short term, they are strategically important because they are a\n\ngood source of new customers.\n\nIn Japan, Europe and other international markets, we rely on distributors, VARs\n\nand OEMs, who sell products into the retail channel. In Japan, we expect that\n\nour shift in focus to the lower end of the small business accounting market will\n\nrequire us to strengthen our direct relationships with retailers, which will\n\npresent challenges.\n\nRetail sales revenue represented about 30% of total revenues during fiscal 1996,\n\n27% in fiscal 1997 and 32% in fiscal 1998. The only retailer or distributor that\n\naccounted for more than 10% of our net revenue during the past three fiscal\n\nyears was Ingram Micro Inc. (13% in fiscal 1996, 12% in fiscal 1997 and 15% in\n\nfiscal 1998).\n\nThere are increasing numbers of companies competing for access to the\n\ndistribution channels we use. Our arrangements with our distributors and\n\nretailers may be terminated by either party at any time without cause. Retailers\n\ntypically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, for\n\nwhich there is intense competition. Any termination or significant disruption of\n\nour relationship with any of our major distributors or retailers, or a\n\nsignificant reduction in sales volume attributable to any of our principal\n\nresellers, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and\n\nfinancial condition. Also, the bankruptcy, deterioration in financial condition\n\nor other business difficulties of a distributor or retailer could impact our\n\nability to collect our accounts receivable from the affected party, which could\n\nhave an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\n\nDuring fiscal 1998, our personal tax business benefited from particularly strong\n\nrelationships with several major retailers. However, during the past few years,\n\nthere has been increasing consolidation among retailers, and we expect this\n\nconsolidation trend to continue. Consolidation has resulted in a number of large\n\nretailers with significant bargaining power. This factor, combined with intense\n\ncompetition for access to retail shelf space and promotional support, has made\n\nit challenging for us to negotiate financially favorable terms with retailers.\n\nWe expect to face even greater challenges in negotiating retail relationships in\n\nfiscal 1999 and beyond, particularly given Microsoft's possible entrance into\n\nthe personal tax market. This could have a negative impact on our future\n\nresults.\n\n14\n\nDIRECT DISTRIBUTION\n\nWe believe that mail and telephone direct sales campaigns are an effective way\n\nto generate orders and provide opportunities for cross-selling, as well as to\n\nstimulate retail demand and increase consumer awareness of our products. Direct\n\nsales frequently generate significantly higher revenue per unit than retail\n\nsales, but this also means that aggressive retail pricing (such as we have seen\n\nin the personal tax area) can harm direct sales efforts. We use targeted\n\ndirect-mail and telephone solicitations, direct-response newspaper and magazine\n\nadvertising, and television and radio advertising to encourage direct sales.\n\nELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION\n\nCustomers can order and receive software products electronically through the\n\nQuicken Store, which is accessible through Quicken.com and other Intuit\n\nwebsites. Electronic delivery has been a particularly effective method of\n\ndistribution for our TurboTax state tax preparation products. Customers can also\n\norder financial supplies through our supplies website. Electronic ordering and\n\ndelivery are convenient for customers and less expensive for Intuit. During\n\nfiscal 1998, about 2% of our total desktop software and supplies revenues were\n\ngenerated by products ordered and/or delivered electronically, but we expect\n\nthis percentage to increase in fiscal 1999.\n\nPRODUCT RETURNS\n\nLike most other software companies, we have a generous return policy for our\n\ndistributors and retailers, although we encourage them to make returns promptly.\n\nWe have an unconditional return policy for direct customers. We establish\n\nreserves for product returns in our financial statements, based on estimated\n\nfuture returns of products, taking into account promotional activities, the\n\ntiming of new product introductions, distributor and retailer inventories of our\n\nproducts and other factors. In the past, returns have not generally exceeded the\n\nreserves we have established for them. However, if in the future retail\n\nsell-through of a major product falls significantly below expectations, or if\n\ncompetitors' promotional or other activities result in increased product\n\nreturns, returns could exceed the reserves established for them and could have a\n\nnegative effect on our financial performance. In addition, the rate of product\n\nreturns could increase as other changes in our distribution channels occur or\n\nexisting products become obsolete.\n\nDuring the tax return preparation season, we generally ship significantly more\n\ntax products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell\n\nduring the tax season, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or\n\nretailers will run out of products during the short tax season. As a result, we\n\nhave historically accepted significant returns of tax products each year,\n\nprincipally from April to September, and we expect to continue to do so in the\n\nfuture.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWe face intense competition from many companies in almost all of our business\n\nareas, both domestically and internationally. Many of our competitors have\n\nsignificantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.\n\nThe most important competitive factors for our desktop software are product\n\nfeatures, ease of use, quality and reliability, brand name recognition, timing\n\nof product launches compared to competitors (particularly for tax products),\n\nprice, access to distribution channels and quality of technical support\n\nservices. For our Internet products, the most important competitive factors are\n\nspeed in getting new products to market, the ability to distribute them\n\neffectively (i.e., generate significant website traffic), brand name\n\nrecognition, product features and ease of use. We believe we compete effectively\n\non most of these factors, as our three principal desktop software products\n\n(Quicken, QuickBooks and TurboTax) are the leading products in their respective\n\nmarkets, and our Quicken.com site is one of the top personal finance sites as\n\nmeasured by household reach statistics published by Media Metrix. However, we\n\nalways face the risk that competitors will introduce better products and\n\nservices, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution channels, increase\n\nadvertising (including advertising targeted at\n\n15\n\nIntuit customers), and release new products before we do. Any of these events\n\n(particularly any prolonged price competition) could have a material negative\n\nimpact on our financial performance. They could also affect our ability to keep\n\nexisting customers and acquire new customers, which is particularly important\n\nfor our Internet products.\n\nSMALL BUSINESS DIVISION\n\nThe major domestic competitor for our small business accounting software is\n\ncurrently Peachtree Software (a division of ADP). A trial version of Peachtree's\n\nmulti-user product is being \"bundled\" with Microsoft Office Small Business\n\nEdition. Peachtree also has a new product that integrates with Microsoft Office,\n\na feature that QuickBooks does not yet offer. These factors may affect our\n\ncompetitive position. Despite competitive pressures, according to statistics\n\npublished by PC Data, QuickBooks accounted for an average of about 80% of\n\nmonthly retail dollar sales of small business accounting software from August\n\n1997 through July 1998.\n\nOur financial supplies business competes with a number of business forms\n\ncompanies, such as Deluxe Business Systems, New England Business Services and\n\nMoore Business Forms, as well as with direct mail check printers and banks. In\n\naddition, our QuickBooks products have certain features (such as customizable\n\ninvoicing) that compete with our supplies products. Also, online bill payment\n\nservices and online payroll services with direct deposit capabilities (including\n\nservices offered by or through Intuit) offer a competitive alternative to\n\nprinted checks. Significant competitive factors for the supplies business\n\ninclude ordering convenience, distribution channels, product quality, speed of\n\ndelivery and price. We believe we compete effectively in most of these areas,\n\nbut we have experienced increased pricing pressures from many of our\n\ncompetitors. While we have been able to offset some of the impact of price\n\ncompetition by improving operational efficiencies and customer service, at some\n\npoint continuing price pressures could negatively affect revenue and\n\nprofitability for our supplies business.\n\nTAX DIVISION\n\nIn the personal tax area, our major domestic competitor is currently Block\n\nFinancial Corporation, the makers of TaxCut software. During fiscal 1997, TaxCut\n\nwas priced very aggressively, and reached the market earlier than our TurboTax\n\nproducts, which adversely impacted sales of TurboTax. During fiscal 1998, we\n\nreleased TurboTax several weeks earlier than in fiscal 1997, which enabled us to\n\ncompete more successfully with TaxCut. According to statistics published by PC\n\nData, TurboTax accounted for over 80% of retail dollar sales of PC-based\n\npersonal tax preparation software during the recent tax season. We expect\n\ncompetition to remain fierce during fiscal 1999. Competition could become\n\nparticularly intense if Microsoft enters this market with a personal tax\n\nproduct. Microsoft is a formidable competitor, and its presence in the personal\n\ntax market would lead to additional pricing pressures, and could adversely\n\nimpact our ability to negotiate advantageous terms with major retailers.\n\nThe professional tax preparation software marketplace is very competitive. Our\n\nlargest competitors in the U.S. are Commerce Clearing House (CCH), with its\n\nComputax product line, and RIA, with its Fast Tax and Creative Solutions\n\nofferings. In the past, professional tax software providers have been highly\n\nfragmented, but recent years have seen substantial consolidation. We believe our\n\nrecent acquisition of Lacerte improves our competitive position in professional\n\ntax. See \"Acquisition of Lacerte,\" on page 4, for more details about the\n\nacquisition.\n\nIntuit attempts to monitor regulatory and public policy developments that could\n\naffect the current business climate. During calendar year 1998, for example, the\n\nfederal government considered extending current services provided by the IRS -\n\nspecifically, the free provision of certain tax forms using the Internet. The\n\nIRS also sought greater authority in the future to permit taxpayers to fill out\n\ngovernment provided tax forms and return them directly to the government,\n\nalthough this would require a significant expansion of the current IRS\n\ninfrastructure. In the future, federal or state authorities may take actions\n\nthat lead to greater government competition with the private sector, and\n\nlegislative simplification of federal or state income tax laws could reduce\n\ndemand for tax preparation software generally. On the other hand, certain policy\n\nchanges considered and made during the 1998 Congressional legislative cycle\n\nactually removed barriers to electronic filing that had previously hampered\n\ntaxpayers, and this may benefit Intuit. Future regulatory and legislative\n\nactivity can enhance or harm Intuit's competitive position, and impact others in\n\nthe tax preparation industry.\n\n16\n\nCONSUMER FINANCE DIVISION\n\nIn desktop consumer finance software, Microsoft is currently our primary\n\ndomestic competitor. Quicken competes directly with Microsoft Money, which is\n\naggressively promoted with free product offers through various distribution\n\nchannels, and with advertising targeted at Quicken users. These competitive\n\npressures, as well as other factors, have negatively affected Quicken revenue\n\nand profitability, particularly during fiscal 1997, when Quicken revenue\n\ndeclined by over 20%. During fiscal 1998, Quicken revenue and profitability\n\nimproved significantly from fiscal 1997 levels with only a slight decline in our\n\ncompetitive position as measured by retail market share (see MD&A, page 29).\n\nAccording to statistics published by PC Data, Quicken accounted for an average\n\nof over 80% of monthly retail dollar sales for personal finance software from\n\nAugust 1997 through July 1998, but we expect competitive pressures to continue.\n\nThere are many competitors for our other consumer finance products and services,\n\nparticularly for our Internet products. We expect that competition will increase\n\nas we expand our offerings, and as more companies expand their businesses onto\n\nthe Internet. Our Quicken.com site competes for traffic with online financial\n\npublishers and the financial areas on numerous online services such as Yahoo!,\n\nas well as financially-oriented websites such as MSN Investor. We also face\n\ncompetition from financial institutions that are developing their own financial\n\nsoftware and websites. Our insurance and mortgage marketspaces compete primarily\n\nwith smaller companies with a very narrow product focus, but Microsoft is also a\n\ncompetitor in the mortgage area. In addition, in connection with a product\n\ndevelopment joint venture established by Intuit and certain private investors,\n\nwe have agreed with the joint venture not to compete in certain areas of\n\nWeb-based personal finance for a period of ten years. See \"Web-based Finance\n\nJoint Venture\" on page 6. See \"Risks for Internet Commerce,\" on page 8, for a\n\ndiscussion of additional competitive risks for our Internet offerings.\n\nINTERNATIONAL DIVISION\n\nIn the small business accounting software market in Japan, our primary\n\ncompetitors are OBC, PCA and Sorimachi. In Europe, we face competition from The\n\nSage Group PLC (based in the United Kingdom) and Microsoft in the small business\n\nmarket. Strong competition in this market may have a more significant impact on\n\nour international business in the future, as the focus of our business in Europe\n\nis shifting more towards the small business market. We have a number of\n\ncompetitors in international tax, including CCH in Canada and TaxCalc in the\n\nUnited Kingdom. Microsoft is also a competitor in the consumer finance area.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT\n\nWe provide customer service and technical support by telephone (including\n\nautomated voice response systems), fax, electronic mail and the Web. We have a\n\nfull-time customer service and technical support staff that is supplemented by\n\nseasonal employees and outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes (such as\n\nduring the tax return filing season, or shortly after a major product launch).\n\nDespite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and\n\nsupport operations, during peak periods we occasionally can't respond promptly\n\nto all customer requests for assistance. We may also have an unusually high\n\nvolume of requests, and be unable to respond promptly, if large numbers of\n\ncustomer order shipments are delayed or if we have product bugs.\n\nDuring the past few years, we have focused on developing support capabilities\n\nthat can supplement, or in some situations replace, telephone service and\n\nsupport. For example, customers who are connected to the Internet can use our\n\nwebsite to get answers to commonly asked questions, check on the status of a\n\nproduct order and receive bug fixes electronically. Alternative service and\n\nsupport methods are less expensive for us and are often more efficient and\n\neffective for customers as well. These programs, combined with a recent\n\nconsolidation and restructuring of our technical support facilities, have\n\nallowed us to make significant improvement in the efficiency of our service and\n\nsupport operations. See MD&A, page 31.\n\nBeginning in fiscal 1996, we started to institute fee-for-support programs for\n\nQuickBooks and for older versions of Quicken. We expanded these programs during\n\nfiscal 1997 and 1998, and we have also begun to eliminate support\n\n17\n\nfor older versions of some products. Revenues from our fee-for-support programs\n\nhave not been material to date. However, the programs have helped to control\n\ntechnical support costs, and as we expand the QuickBooks Support Network to\n\nprovide higher-quality support tailored to the specific requirements of small\n\nbusinesses, we believe our customer support operations can become a\n\nstrategically important revenue source.\n\nMANUFACTURING AND SHIPPING\n\nThe major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are duplicating disks\n\nand CDs, printing manuals and boxes, and assembling and shipping the final\n\nproducts. We outsource most of these tasks to vendors who are required to follow\n\nour strict quality guidelines. We have a small in-house manufacturing and\n\nshipping facility to handle low-volume products, and to handle shipments for\n\ndirect sales. We have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and\n\navailability has not been a problem for us. Prior to major product releases, we\n\ntend to have significant levels of backlog, but at other times backlog is\n\nminimal and we normally ship products within a week of receiving an order.\n\nBecause of this fluctuation in backlog, we don't think backlog is necessarily an\n\nimportant measure of future sales.\n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nSome of our products and services are regulated businesses under federal or\n\nstate laws. We offer these regulated products and services through separate\n\nsubsidiary corporations. These subsidiaries must comply with a variety of\n\nregulations that don't apply to most software companies. Establishing and\n\nmaintaining regulated subsidiaries requires significant financial, legal and\n\nmanagement resources. If the subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable\n\nregulations, they could face liability to customers and/or penalties and\n\nsanctions by government regulators.\n\nOur Quicken Investment Services, Inc. subsidiary (or \"QISI\") is registered as an\n\ninvestment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is subject to\n\ncertain state regulatory laws as well. QISI is responsible for certain of the\n\ninvestment-related features in our products and services. Investment adviser\n\nregulations restrict QISI's business practices in several areas, including\n\nadvertising and distribution arrangements. The business activities of IIS, which\n\noperates the Quicken InsureMarket website, are subject to state insurance\n\nregulations. IIS (or one of its officers) currently has an insurance license in\n\neach state where we believe licensing is necessary. State insurance laws\n\nregulate various aspects of the business operations of IIS and participating\n\ninsurance carriers, including advertising, record-keeping and compensation. Our\n\nQuickenMortgage and Quicken Business CashFinder services are offered by a\n\nsubsidiary called Intuit Lender Services, Inc. (or \"ILSI\"). ILSI (or one of its\n\nofficers) currently has a mortgage or loan broker license in each state where we\n\nbelieve licensing is necessary. State laws regulate various aspects of the\n\nbusiness operations of ILSI and participating lenders, including advertising,\n\nrecord-keeping and compensation.\n\nOur Quicken products allow customers of participating brokerages to trade\n\nsecurities through their broker's website. Quicken InsureMarket may expand its\n\nsite to include other insurance products, such as variable annuities, that are\n\nconsidered \"securities\" under federal and state laws. We believe we have\n\nstructured these services in a way that avoids direct government regulation.\n\nHowever, it's possible that these services, or other services we may offer in\n\nthe future, may be regulated under federal and/or state securities broker-dealer\n\nlaws or other regulations. We continually analyze new business opportunities,\n\nand any new businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for\n\nregulatory compliance.\n\nVarious Intuit products contain powerful encryption technology. Government\n\nregulations currently prohibit this technology from being exported outside of\n\nthe United States and Canada. Some agencies of the federal government are\n\nseeking to relax export laws, but others are seeking to tighten export\n\nrestrictions on software containing encryption technology. These regulations may\n\naffect international sales of our desktop software as well as our ability to\n\nprovide the level of security customers are seeking in Internet-based products\n\nand services on a worldwide basis.\n\n18\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws,\n\nand employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements to protect our software\n\nproducts and other proprietary technology. While our proprietary technology is\n\nimportant, we believe our success depends more heavily on the innovative skills\n\nand technical competency of our employees. We don't have any copy-protection\n\nmechanisms in our software because we don't believe they are practical or\n\neffective. Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited\n\npractical protection from software \"pirates,\" and the laws of many other\n\ncountries provide almost no protection for our intellectual property. Policing\n\nunauthorized use of our products is difficult, expensive and time-consuming and\n\nwe expect that software piracy will be a persistent problem for our desktop\n\nsoftware products. In addition, the unique technology of the Internet may tend\n\nto increase, and provide new methods for, illegal copying of the technology used\n\nin our Internet-based products. We consider our principal trademarks (including\n\nIntuit, Quicken, QuickBooks and TurboTax) to be important assets and have\n\nregistered these and other trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and many\n\nforeign countries. The initial duration of trademark registrations varies from\n\ncountry to country and is 10 years in the U.S. Most registrations can be renewed\n\nrepeatedly.\n\nWe don't necessarily own all of the software and other technologies used in our\n\nproducts and services, but we have all licenses that we believe are necessary\n\nfor using that technology. We don't believe that our products, trademarks and\n\nother proprietary rights infringe anyone else's proprietary rights. However,\n\nother parties occasionally claim that features or content of certain of our\n\nproducts, or our use of certain trademarks, may infringe their property rights.\n\nPast claims have not resulted in any significant litigation, settlement or\n\nlicensing expenses, but future claims could.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of September 30, 1998, Intuit and its domestic subsidiaries had about 2,500\n\nfull-time employees, and our international subsidiaries had about 360 full-time\n\nemployees. We believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability\n\nto attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business. We don't\n\nhave any collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we believe\n\nemployee relations are generally good. We do not have any key person life\n\ninsurance, and we do not have employment agreements with any employees that can\n\ninsure continued service. Although we believe we offer competitive compensation\n\nand a good working environment, we face intense competition for qualified\n\nemployees. Like many of our competitors, we have had difficulties during the\n\npast few years hiring and retaining employees.\n\nITEM 2\n\nPROPERTIES\n\nOur principal offices are located in Mountain View, California. We also lease\n\noffice and manufacturing space in Palo Alto and San Diego, California. We lease\n\nour Mountain View facilities (currently about 260,000 square feet) under leases\n\nwith staggered eight-year terms that we entered into in November 1994. Since\n\nDecember 1995, we have been in the process of moving our Palo Alto operations to\n\nMountain View in stages. The move will be completed over the next several years.\n\nIn June 1996, we relocated our San Diego operations to new offices\n\n(approximately 140,000 square feet) under a \"build-to-suit\" lease. The San Diego\n\nbuild-to-suit lease was amended this past fiscal year to provide for the\n\nconstruction and lease of a 71,000 square foot building (including a computer\n\ncenter), and to extend and revise the terms of the existing lease. See Note 7 of\n\nthe financial statements (page 51) for information about our lease commitments.\n\nWe also lease facilities in Tucson, Arizona and Fredericksburg, Virginia (for\n\ncustomer service call centers), in Alexandria, Virginia (where our IIS\n\nsubsidiary is located), in Dallas, Texas (where our Lacerte subsidiaries are\n\nlocated), and in Canada, England, France, Germany and Japan. During fiscal 1998,\n\nwe entered into a \"build-to-suit\" lease to provide for the construction of two\n\nbuildings totaling approximately 135,000 square feet on property located in\n\nTucson, Arizona. In fiscal 1998 we also entered into a construction agreement to\n\nbuild a 45,000 square\n\n19\n\nfoot customer service and technical support facility on property owned by Intuit\n\nand located in Fredericksburg, Virginia.\n\nWe believe our facilities are adequate for our current and near-term needs and\n\nthat we will be able to locate additional space to accommodate anticipated\n\ngrowth.\n\nITEM 3\n\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nIntuit is currently a defendant in the following six class action lawsuits\n\nalleging that certain of our Quicken products have on-line banking functions\n\nthat are not Year 2000 compliant: Alan Issokson v. Intuit Inc. (filed April 29,\n\n1998 in the Santa Clara County, California Superior Court); Rocco Chilelli v.\n\nIntuit Inc. (filed May 13, 1998 in the New York Supreme Court, New York County,\n\nNew York); Glenn Faegenburg v. Intuit Inc. (filed May 27, 1998 in the New York\n\nSupreme Court, New York County, New York); Joseph Rubin v. Intuit Inc. (filed\n\nMay 27, 1998 in the Santa Clara County, California Superior Court); Donald\n\nColbourn v. Intuit Inc. (filed June 4, 1998 in the San Mateo County, California\n\nSuperior Court); and Jerald M. Stein v. Intuit Inc. (filed June 23, 1998 in the\n\nNew York Supreme Court, New York County, New York). All of the lawsuits are\n\nsubstantively very similar. The lawsuits assert breach of implied warranty\n\nclaims, violations of federal and/or state consumer protection laws, violations\n\nof various state business practices laws, and the plaintiffs seek compensatory\n\ndamages, disgorgement of profits, and (in certain cases) attorneys' fees. See\n\nMD&A, page 34, for a discussion of Intuit's status and plans with respect to\n\nYear 2000 compliance.\n\nOn June 23, 1998, Intuit moved to dismiss the Issokson complaint. In August\n\n1998, our motion was granted but the plaintiff still has an opportunity to amend\n\nthe complaint to allege injury. We believe this will be difficult in light of\n\nthe remedies that we are providing to our Quicken customers. However, if the\n\ncomplaint is amended in a manner that is satisfactory to overcome another motion\n\nto dismiss, we believe we have good and valid defenses to the claims asserted,\n\nand we intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\n\nWe have filed motions to dismiss the complaints in every other case except the\n\nColburn action. We plan on filing a demurrer in the Colburn action in the\n\nfuture. Discovery is stayed in the New York actions pending hearings on the\n\nmotions. Discovery is ongoing in the Issokson and Stein actions. Given the\n\noutcome of the motion to dismiss in the Issokson case, we believe we may prevail\n\non these motions as well. However, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is\n\nuncertain, and regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on\n\nIntuit because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other\n\nfactors.\n\nWe are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the course of\n\nour business. We currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability, if\n\nany, for any pending actions (either alone or combined) will not materially\n\naffect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, as\n\nnoted above, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and either\n\nunfavorable or favorable outcomes could have a material negative impact.\n\nITEM 4\n\nSUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS\n\nNot applicable.\n\nITEM 4A\n\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT\n\nEffective August 1, 1998, our Board of Directors elected William V. Campbell as\n\nChairman of the Board and William H. Harris, Jr. as President and Chief\n\nExecutive Officer of Intuit. Intuit founder Scott D.

He served as Intuit's President and\n\nChief Executive Officer from April 1994 through July 1998. Mr. Campbell was\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of GO Corporation (a pen-based computing\n\nsoftware company) from January 1991 to December 1993. Mr. Campbell also serves\n\non the board of directors of SanDisk, Inc. (a computer storage devices company),\n\nGreat Plains Software, Inc. (a software company), Apple Computer, Inc. (a\n\ncomputer company) and Netscape Communications Corp. (an Internet browser\n\ncompany). He is a member of SanDisk's Compensation Committee and a member of\n\nApple's Audit Committee. Mr. Campbell holds both a Bachelors and a Masters\n\ndegree in economics from Columbia University.\n\nMr. Cook, a founder of Intuit, has been a director of Intuit since March 1984\n\nand is currently Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board. He served as\n\nIntuit's Chairman of the Board from March 1993 through July 1998. From March\n\n1984 to April 1994, he also served as President and Chief Executive Officer of\n\nIntuit.\n\n21\n\nMr. Cook also serves on the board of directors of Amazon.com, Inc. (an\n\nonline bookseller) and ebay Inc. (an online electronic commerce company). Mr.\n\nCook holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and mathematics from the\n\nUniversity of Southern California and a Masters in Business Administration from\n\nHarvard University.\n\nMr. Harris became President and Chief Executive Officer of Intuit in August 1998\n\nand joined Intuit's Board of Directors in May 1998. He joined Intuit as\n\nExecutive Vice President in December 1993, in connection with Intuit's\n\nacquisition of ChipSoft, Inc.
