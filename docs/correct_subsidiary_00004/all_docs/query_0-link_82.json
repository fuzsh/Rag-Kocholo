Jacobson Borland, Sun Make Java Deal Software publisher Borland International Inc. has formed an alliance with Sun Microsystems to develop products based on the latter's Java programs for Internet access. Reporting from Scotts Valley, California, United Press International says the new alliance calls for Borland to work on developing \"tools\" that can be used to set up customized applications running on Java programs. The product is code named Latte. Borland Vice President Paul Gross told the wire service, \"This agreement with Sun will enable Borland to deliver high quality development solutions to the exploding Internet market. We believe that Java's platform- independent capabilities will drive its acceptance as a distributed computing development environment and create a need for high performance, rapid application development tools. \" As noted earlier, Sun's Java software is designed to simplify use of the Internet's World Wide Web and it has been actively promoting it over the Internet in order to encourage adoption of it as a standard. UPI says Java is designed to allow companies to set up better-looking Web home pages, adding, \"Rather than the current offering of text and an occasional photo, the program allows companies to feature moving pictures and a constantly updated stream of information, such as stock ticker prices or multiplayer games.\" The wire service also comments that Borland has been \"scrambling to stay profitable amid brutal competition for customers\" from such companies as Microsoft Corp. and IBM's Lotus Development Corp., selling off assets in recent years to focus on database software development. Softbank Acquires Ziff-Davis Japanese software distributor Softbank Corp. and an affiliate have agreed to acquire Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., the largest U.S. publisher of computer and high-tech magazines, for $2.1 billion. Ziff-Davis publishes several major computer magazines, including PC Magazine, Computer Shopper, PC Week and MacUser. The acquisition creates the computer industry's largest integrated magazine publisher and trade show organizer. Softbank, which is also a leading computer magazine publisher in Japan, recently acquired the COMDEX computer industry trade show company. Softbank President and Masayoshi Son says the company aims to publish 1,000 titles by 2005, compared to 130 in 1995. Seagate Buyout of Conner OK'd Antitrust regulators with the Federal Trade Commission have cleared disc-drive maker Seagate Technology Inc.'s proposed $1.04 billion buyout of rival Conner Peripherals Inc. Reporting from Scotts Valley, California, United Press International notes the merger, which will make Seagate the world's top producer of drives, still must be approved by stockholders of both companies and by the Commission of the European Union. \"The two companies\" combined share of the booming market for drives is about 35 percent,\" says UPI, \"and will move Seagate into the business of tape drives -- used to back up disc drives -- and software for managing memory in computer networks.\" Packard Bell Amends Compaq Suit In new charges, Packard Bell Electronics Inc. has accused rival Compaq Computer Corp. of falsely labeled shipping cartons on some of its notebook models as made in America though they were produced overseas. Reporting from Sacramento, California, the Reuter News Service says the new allegations amend an October suit in which Packard Bell seeks damages for false advertising and violation of the Lanham Act that prohibits misrepresentation of the origin of goods. Packard Bell also is asking the court to issue an injunction mandating the truthful labeling of Compaq product to show its actual country of origin. As observed earlier, the suit is part of a long running legal battle between Compaq, the nation's largest computer maker (shipping 1.49 million in the third quarter), and Packard Bell, the fourth ranked manufacturer (with 835,000 units shipped in the same quarter). \"The legal disputes date back to the spring of this year,\" Reuters notes, \"when Compaq sued Packard Bell, claiming the company sold computers as new when in fact they contained used parts. The October suit filed by Packard Bell against Compaq claims Compaq falsely described Packard's return policies and misled customers in comparing the two companies.\" Netscape Completes Collabra Buy For $185.5 million in stock, web browser publisher Netscape Communications Corp. has completed acquisition of closely held Collabra Software Inc., a producer of a groupware program that competes with Lotus Notes. From Netscape's Mountain View, California, headquarters, the Wall Street Journal reports this morning the company issued 1.85 million shares of its stock to acquire Collabra. Collabra publishes Collabra Share in the groupware category of software intended for networked computerists. Officials with Netscape have said their employer plans to weave Collabra Share with the Netscape Navigator program for browsing the Internet's World Wide Web. Meanwhile, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday, Netscape topped $100 a share for the first time since going public in August, closing at $100.25, up $1.25. Netscape Sets Stock Split Netscape Communications Corp. says its board of directors has approved a two-for-one stock split, subject to stockholder approval. A special meeting of the company's shareholders is scheduled for Jan. 23, 1996, for the purpose of approving the split and doubling the number of common stock shares. Upon completion of the split, Netscape will have approximately 81 million common stock shares outstanding. Netscape has achieved stratospheric growth in its 19 months of existence. The company's Web browser tool has become the most popular tool for surfing the Internet's World Wide Web. Netscape is based in Mountain View, California. LAN of the Future: Data/Voice Link Multimedia personal computers can have all the special calling features of an office telephone when connected to a new phone system designed by AT&T Corp.'s office systems unit. The Wall Street Journal reports from New York that on Monday, AT&T will announce that its engineers at Bell Laboratories have designed hardware and software for linking the data and voice networks, allowing two people collaborating at their multimedia desktop computers to call and hear each other. The two colleagues could collaborate and then one of them could transfer the other to a third person at another workstation. Voice mail, call-waiting, and other features are also available, sources who have seen the new AT&T product told the Wall Street Journal. 1-Gigabit DRAM Alliance Set IBM, Siemens, Toshiba, and Motorola have announced plans for a four-way alliance to develop future generations of highly advanced semiconductor chips, including a 1-gigabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device. The announcement builds on an existing high-tech alliance among IBM, Siemens, and Toshiba that developed a 256-megabit DRAM. According to plans unveiled by the four companies, the new alliance will continue to develop and enhance existing 64- and 256-megabit chips and cooperate on next generation 1- gigabit DRAMs. A 1-gigabit device will offer four times the memory capacity of a 256-megabit chip, making possible the storage of 100,000 double-spaced pages of typewritten text on a single chip. While 4-megabit and 16-megabit DRAMs are currently available in the marketplace, the semiconductor industry is pushing to develop ever more sophisticated memory devices for use in power-hungry systems, such as powerful personal computers and workstations, as well as high-definition digital video, multimedia and telecommunications systems. Motorola researchers are expected to join development teams from IBM, Siemens, and Toshiba, which have been working on high-density memory chip development for several years at IBM's Advanced Semiconductor Research and Development Center in East Fishkill, New York. The alliance is an outgrowth of separate long-term elationships among the companies. IBM Sets Chip Mfg. Expansion IBM Corp. has announced plans to expand its microelectronics business by investing $1.4 billion at existing chip-making facilities in Essonnes, France and Burlington, Vermont. The investment in Essonnes, totaling about $1 billion, is for manufacturing 64-megabit DRAMs using .35 micron process technology. IBM notes that a single 64-megabit DRAM can store over 6,000 pages of double-spaced typewritten text. Over time, the new mission in Essonnes is expected to employ more than 1,000 people. The $400 million investment in Burlington will add .35 and .25 micron technology for manufacturing microprocessors, embedded controllers and other logic chips, including leading-edge multimedia devices such as IBM's new Mwave media processors and MPEG-2 video encoders and decoders. \"Multimedia chips will play a key role as computing power migrates to large networks. They are an important element of our business growth,\" says Michael J. Attardo, general manager of IBM's Microelectronics Division. \"We'll continue investing to grow our capacity, leverage our leadership in process technology and expand our position in the rapidly emerging consumer and communications semiconductor segments.\" In April, IBM announced $1 billion for capacity expansion worldwide, including Burlington; Essonnes (in a joint venture with Siemens); East Fishkill, New York (in a joint venture with Cirrus Logic called MiCRUS); and Yasu, Japan. In August, IBM and Toshiba announced plans to build a new $1.2 billion, .35 micron, 64-megabit DRAM plant in Manassas, Virginia. IBM says program commitments represented by all of these investments total more than $3 billion to be spent over the next several years. New Storage Plans Researched High-speed holographic data storage systems holding many times the information of today's largest magnetic hard disk drives are the goal of a new research alliance by the University of Dayton's Research Institute, IBM, Stanford University and others. In Dayton, Ohio, university officials told United Press International the potential applications are enormous, ranging from satellite communications to high-speed digital libraries. They added that the optical storage system could hold more than 12 times the information of today's largest magnetic hard disk drives and maintain data input and output rates more than 10 times faster than now possible. \"As part of a five-year, $32 million program,\" the wire service says, \"UDRI will work with Texas Instruments, the Air Force Institute of Technology and the Dayton Area Graduate Studies Institute to develop a reference beam spatial light modulator for holographic data storage systems.\" Steve Gustafson, UDRI senior research scientist and an associate professor of electro-optics, elaborated, saying, \"To do that, we use micromirrors so small that 10 of them would fit across a strand of hair. These mirrors move up and down like a trampoline and are designed to enable optical interference in the crystal that stores the data.\" Gustafson notes that holographic data storage uses lasers to store information as \"pages\" of electronic patterns within the volume of the special optical crystal. Because a million or more data bits are placed on each page and thousands of pages can be stored in material no larger than a small coin, he said, holographic systems offer the possibility of compact devices holding trillions of bytes of information. Also, since there are no moving parts and all the information on each page is accessed simultaneously, the technology also has the potential for very rapid access to any of the stored data at speeds more than 10 times faster than is possible today. Camera Firm Claims CD Breakthrough Officials with the California- based optical storage division of famed Japanese camera firm Nikon say their researchers have found an answer to the problem that causes erasable magneto-optical disk drives to take twice as long to write as to read. Computergram International this morning quotes those at Nikon Precision Inc. in Belmont, California, as saying the delay is caused by the need for a separate erase cycle before the write, and it means that write transfer speeds are only 50 percent of the rated read speed. \"The company's answer,\" says CI, \"is a technique it calls 'direct overwrite,' which uses Nikon's light intensity modulation to vary the intensity of the laser -- presumably between that required to generate enough heat to erase and that required for a write, and plans to offer it in 5.25- inch drives that store 2.6Gb.\" CI says the company claims a read and write transfer rate approaching 4MB per second. \"The drives will be fully read- and write-compatible with the several million 1.3GB 5.25-inch magneto-optical platters in use worldwide,\" says the newsletter, adding that Nikon and Hitachi Maxel Ltd. jointly are working on production of the medium. Nikon says its plan for direct overwrite has been submitted to the International Standards Organization and that it expects it to become a worldwide standard. Eight-Speed CD-ROM Upgrade Ready Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc. is offering the 8X Multimedia Upgrade Kit 800, a product that allows users of double-, triple-, quad- or six-speed CD-ROM drives to upgrade to eight-speed CD-ROM drive technology. The 8X Multimedia Upgrade Kit 800 contains an eight-speed CD-ROM drive, an interface card, Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia 1996 Edition and cables that are compatible with any sound card. The IDE eight-speed drive provides a 1,200KB per second transfer rate, an access time of 230ms and a 256KB buffer. The drive is both Photo CD and Multisession XA-compatible. \"The 8X Multimedia Upgrade Kit 800 provides an easy and affordable way for users to upgrade their system hardware to the latest in CD-ROM technology at a price that compares to standalone 6-speed drives,\" says Paul Nahi, director of product marketing for Diamond, which is located in San Jose, California. The kit, available now, is priced at $399. Newton to Offer Two-Way Messaging Two-way wireless messaging is being developed for the handheld Newton 2.0 platform in a joint project by Apple Computer Inc., RadioMail Corp., Motorola Inc. and Ardis Co. Reporting from San Mateo, California, this morning, the Reuter News Service says the service will enable users to send and receive email and send graphic images to fax machines among other applications. Look for the service to combine \"the power of the Apple MessagePad, the Motorola Personal Messenger 100D Wireless Modem Card, the Ardis wireless network and RadioMail's gateway services,\" Reuters adds. Common IBM-Apple Platform Agreed On IBM and Apple Computer Inc. say they have agreed on details to develop new machines able to run each other's operating software. The announcement, made at the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas, comes a year after the two companies first proclaimed their intentions to develop a common platform. They say they hope to offer an alternate industry standard to the PCs that use Intel Corp. chips and Microsoft Corp. software. Business writer Catalina Ortiz of the Associated Press says the firms, along with Motorola Inc., have released specifications of hardware based on the PowerPC microprocessor, which the three developed. Joe Guglielmi, general manager of the Motorola Computer Group, told reporters at the show, \"The PowerPC platform offers the first truly open model of computing spanning from low-cost portables to high-end servers and workstation systems. The significance of this is tremendous.\" Ortiz says machines conforming to the \"Common Hardware Reference Platform\" should be on the market in the second half of next year. \"Instead of one, common, operating system,\" she adds, \"the new PCs will run the Macintosh OS and IBM's OS/2. It also will run UNIX, used widely for workstations, and Windows NT, Microsoft's heavy-duty OS.\" Apple Buys 5.1% of American Online Apple Computer Inc. has exercised a warrant and acquired a 5.1 percent stake in America Online, paying $12.5 million for 2 million shares of the Vienna, Virginia, online service. Reporting for the Reuter News Service, writer Eric Auchard says some analysts think the move signals that Apple may be moving to dispense with eWorld, its own proprietary online service. Analyst Bruce Lupatkin of Hambrecht & Quist told the wire service that eWorld, despite praise for its easy-to-navigate interface, has failed to make its mark as a broad-based online service brand. Soundview Financial analyst John Maxwell added, \"At this junction, (Apple) probably won't admit it, but eWorld isn't going anywhere.\" Apple acquired the warrant, reported in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in connection with a software and licensing agreement it signed with AOL in December 1992. Acquisition Rumors Swirl Acquisition rumors are once again sweeping the PC industry. The latest reports have IBM Corp. making a bid for Novell Inc., and IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co. making separate offers for Apple Computer Inc. The Reuter News Service says IBM CEO Louis Gerstner is declining to comment on the reports. \"I have no comment on rumors,\" Gerstner told reporters at the company's booth at the COMDEX/Fall computer industry trade show. \"You know that I have no comment on speculations.\" Apple, HP and Novell representatives also declined to comment. Trade journal Infoworld, citing sources close to Apple, says IBM is offering between $70 and $75 per share for Apple while Hewlett-Packard is interested in a swap of between 0.8 and 1.1 shares of HP stock for each Apple share. Based on Monday's closing prices, HP's bid would be worth between $74.70 and $102.71 per share. Jobs, Oracle Discuss Projects Word is NeXT Computer Inc. chief Steve Jobs has advised Oracle Systems Corp. on ways the two companies can work together. The San Francisco Chronicle reports Jobs has been advising Oracle chairman Larry Ellison on a possible alliance with Apple. \"While he has not been specific, a licensing alliance with Oracle could be part of that strategy,\" according to the Associated Press. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reports Oracle also has discussed with Apple the prospect of using software from its Newton product for a computer that would cost just a few hundred dollars and be able to access the Internet and other electronic networks. Most Influential Execs Named For a record third time, Computer Reseller News has put Microsoft Corp. Chairman and CEO Bill Gates at the head of its annual Top 25 Most Influential Executives list. Gates has been a part of the computer industry trade journal's list for all but one of the past 13 years. He's the only individual ever to have topped the list more than once, also claiming the No. 1 position in 1986 and 1991. \"With the launch of Windows 95 this year, Gates captured the mind share of more than just those familiar with PC technology,\" says Robert Faletra, Computer Reseller News' editor-in-chief. \"His influence is deeply rooted in this industry and now in the general population.\" \" 2.

AT&T to Plug In 110,000 Schools AT&T says it will spend $150 million to help connect the 110,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools in the United States to the Internet by year 2000. According to the Reuter News Service, the plan, called the AT&T Learning Network, begins next spring and includes free dial- up Internet access, 100 hours of free usage and free \"browser\" software to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web. The wire service adds that teacher support includes technical assistance to ensure services are installed and working properly; online mentors and access to teachers who have used technology successfully in classrooms; a model for collaborative online projects, and lesson plans to help integrate technology and extended communications into classes. The program also will provide three months of national voice messaging, allowing schools to broadcast messages to parents and pupils. \"Once schools surpass the free usage threshold,\" says Reuters, \"they will still receive discounted rates on Internet and messaging for the remainder of the five year program.\" AT&T says the project will be expanded to include libraries next year. Mexican BBS Leads to U.S. Jail A federal court has sentenced a businessman and a prostitute to jail for selling child pornography by computer from Mexico. It is the first case in which operators of a foreign bulletin board system have been prosecuted in the U.S. for child porn. Robert A. Copella, former vice president of research and development at Rand McNally Corp., was sentenced in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, yesterday to 5 1/2 years in prison. Pamela J. Kneeland received an 18-month sentence. Associated Press writer Jeffrey Gold reports that Copella told U.S. District Judge John Bissell he got Kneeland off crack cocaine and helped start the bulletin board to give her a livelihood off the streets. Said Copella, \"I tried to help her out and it didn't work out the way either of us wanted to. I made a terrible mistake. I chose the wrong path.\" However, prosecutors and Kneeland's lawyer contend Copella took advantage of a woman who was socially and physically immature. Said Assistant U.S. Attorney Donna Krappa, \"Mr. Copella's motive was pure greed.\" Judge Bissell appeared to agree, calling Copella \"warped,\" saying he was guilty of \"grossly unacceptable conduct,\" and adding Kneeland \"was ripe for the picking by a manipulator. Although an active and knowing participant to a degree, Ms. Kneeland is a victim.\" Says Gold, \"Copella and Kneeland met on a Chicago street in April 1993. He was 49, the father of three and an internationally recognized expert in security devices for airline tickets and baggage. She was 24, addicted to crack, and had been arrested about 35 times the year before for soliciting. They moved in together. Prosecutors say they soon began distributing child pornography on a computer bulletin board from a phone line billed to Copella's address in Northbrook, Illinois.\" The wire service says the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Attorney's office began tracking Copella when a Customs agent in Newark learned about the Illinois operation in March 1993. Copella and Kneeland moved to Mexico in 1994, reopening their BBS, which they operated for about six months before Copella was arrested in San Diego in September 1994 after an 18-month investigation. Kneeland was arrested two weeks later outside the federal courthouse in San Diego, where a hearing for Copella was scheduled. AP notes that possession or transmission of pictures, in any form, of children engaging in sexual activity is a federal offense. Authorities have not disclosed how much money the operation generated, but Special Agent Phillip Padlo of the Customs Service said the BBS charged $10 for five days of downloading and browsing, to $250 for a year's access. N.Y. BBS Closed in Novell Raid Equipment operating a Brooklyn, New York, bulletin board system called the Pits BBS has been seized in a raid by U.S. marshals and members of software publisher Novell Inc.'s anti-piracy team. According to a statement from Novell's Provo, Utah, headquarters, the firm took the action \"in response to illegal distribution of its copyrighted software.\" Novell said the raid came after it filed a civil suit last month in the U.S. District Court in New York. \"Following the raid,\" says the statement, \"the BBS operator, Pierre Barkett, agreed to settle the lawsuit by forfeiting his equipment and consenting to a $200,000 judgment.\" Novell said its investigation, launched last May, \"revealed that the Pits BBS had for several years been offering users access to illegal copies of copyrighted software programs, including Novell's PerfectOffice suite.\" Adds the statement, \"Barkett told Novell investigators that he knew about Novell's reputation for aggressively pursing and shutting down pirate bulletin board systems, but did not know that PerfectOffice was a Novell product.\" Felony Charges Brought in Piracy Two felony counts of fraud and trademark violations have been brought against a Californian allegedly ran a big computer-software-piracy operation in L.A. The Wall Street Journal says bail has been set at $250,000 for Thomas Nick Alefantes, who was arrested last week following a raid at his home by investigators from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and software-industry antipiracy sleuths. The paper quotes participants in the raid as saying authorities seized an estimated $1 million in illegally copied software, high-speed duplicating equipment and $15,000 in cash. Software-industry officials and computer- crime experts told the Journal they believe Alefantes's operation is one of the biggest of its kind ever seized. Alefantes -- known in some computing circles as \"Captain Blood\" - is accused of selling and renting stolen software through advertisements in trade publications and a mail-order business. CEO Carol Bartz of Autodesk Inc. told the paper, \"We believe our losses over the past five years from this man's alleged activities add up to millions of dollars, so we are extremely grateful\" for his arrest. She said illegal copies of its automated- design-software programs, which the company sells for $4,000 each, were found at Alefantes's house during the raid. UK Man Jailed For Making Virus A 26-year-old Briton has been jailed for 18 months after being convicted of creating a computer virus. Christopher Pile, who dubbed himself \"The Black Baron,\" is said to be the first person in Britain to be jailed for such an offense. The Reuter News Service quotes Judge Jeremy Griggs in the court in Exeter in southwest England as saying millions of pounds' worth of damage could be caused when Pile copied programs and games, infected them with a virus and then put them back on computer bulletin board systems. \"Those who seek to wreak mindless havoc on one of the vital tools of our age cannot expect lenient treatment,\" Griggs said. \"Once Pandora's Box is opened, like Pandora's, it can't be closed.\" Reuters says Pile, a self- taught computerist, created viruses Pathogen and Queeg, based on expressions used in a cult television series, Red Dwarf. The detective who tracked down Pile told the court the viruses were the most sophisticated he had ever encountered. \"What made them doubly dangerous,\" says Reuters, \"was another virus, an encryption engine he called Smeg, which could be attached to the other viruses, scrambling them every time they were run.\" Prosecuting counsel Brian Lett told the court many of the viruses were detected within days of use, but they could not be defined and cleansed because of the Smeg cloaking device he had created to disguise the virus. Lett alleged the defendant acted deliberately and maliciously, and that his actions remain potentially damaging, adding, \"Some further damage is probable and its extent incalculable.\" Prosecuted under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act for creating and planting computer viruses, Pile admitted five unauthorized accesses to facilitate crime and five unauthorized modifications of computer materials between October 1993 and April last year. Reuters says he also admitted inciting others to contravene the Act via a BBS. The Kids' Computing Corner by Frank Sereno First, I'd like to apologize to the publisher and to you readers for not completing any reviews this week. I have several reviews in the works and hopefully they will be ready for the next issue. Since Thanksgiving is next Thursday, I'd like to wish everyone a happy holiday in advance. Thanksgiving is a wonderful holiday. Of secondary importance is the great feast many will eat or the holiday sales on the following Friday. It is a day to thank your deity for what is good in your life and to thank your family and friends for being part of your life. I've been blessed with a wonderful family and some great friends. One person who deserves a special tip of the cap is my friend Bob Wysocki who uploads each issue of this magazine to AOL. He uploads the ASCII and PDF versions of each week's issue to the E-zines file area. But more than that, he helps lift the darkness that sometimes colors my soul. Last week's Andy Rooney routine did have some benefits. I received a letter with some tips to avoid a recurrence of a tape restore operation nightmare in Windows 95. This is from Bill Halvorsen: \"I just happened by the STR article where you told of your restore nightmare. I had the same thing happen, and now `I think' I know what the problem is (not that I can explain it very well, but maybe you'll get the idea). First, when I have to restore, I do a quickie minimal installation of '95 from CD (have real mode drivers on my emergency boot diskette) so I can get the restore program. Then on to the tape. Now the important part is that when the restore is done, you get an error about a problem restoring the registry. Ignore that. But the important thing is SHUT DOWN immediately and reboot. You mentioned that you went on using your system. If you did, you were `running' on the `minimal' registry without any of your data from system.dat or user.dat because didn't reboot. Then the first thing you did that affected the registry, wrote a new copy, and overwrote the backup (.da0 I think). You're basically sunk at that point. Two things you can do, ignore that registry error message but at any and all costs, just OK that dialog and immediately exit Windows and reboot. As a total fail-safe you run a backup to floppy of your system.dat and user.dat every time you do a backup. Bill Halvorsen, who once owned an ST (great machine at the time, but the company was vapor).\" And that's all for this week's extremely brief article. Remember the e-mail address is fsereno@matrix.uti.com and I thank you for reading. Stonekeep The Wait is Over The Experience Begins Irvine, California-- For those who were betting that Stonekeep(TM) would miss its November 8th street date, it's time to pay up! After over four years in development, a budget of just under five million, and the talents of more than 200 individuals, Stonekeep has arrived. \"What we wanted to do was take the role-playing genre to the next level, to create an experience that was pure. No buttons, no icons, just a pure screen that allowed you to totally immerse yourself,\" said Brian Fargo, CEO of Interplay. Using innovative technology, Stonekeep draws the player into its dark reaches so completely the player will forget it's just a game. The player's feet will walk the ancient corridors and his hands will wield weapons of metal and magic. Battle disembodied foes, rescue allies from evil, liberate a massive dragon from bondage and discover an experience more realistic than anything ever imagined. \"It's the hundreds of details, from the graphics and sound to the intuitive interface, which went into making Stonekeep that creates the suspension of disbelief experienced when playing it,\" explains Michael Quarles, producer of the project. \"We had a vision for Stonekeep and we didn't want to miss that mark.\" In Stonekeep, the highly advanced interface allows for an environment of unparalleled realism in which 3-D rendered dungeons and creatures combine with live actors and stunning special effects. Detailed scriptwriting creates characters that think, act and react depending on each person's style of play. An intelligent journal accompanies the player in his quest, automatically mapping the player's path, the characters encountered and important clues heard along the way. State-of the-art 3-D sound effects, an original music score and beautiful cinematic sequences integrate into the experience that is Stonekeep. Stonekeep was produced by Interplay's Michael Quarles. Michael Quarles' other production credits at Interplay include Star Trek: 25th Anniversary(TM) and Clayfighter(TM) for the Super Nintendo (R); Entertainment System. Mr. Quarles began his career at Interplay as the lead programmer on Battlechess(TM) and Wasteland(TM). Available on CD-ROM, Stonekeep will run on any 486SX 33Mhz or better with DOS 5.0 or newer and at least 8 Mb RAM. A CD-ROM drive, 40Mb free hard- drive space, 256-color VGA card, a Microsoft or compatible mouse and a Sound Blaster or compatible sound card are required. Interplay has released three back-to-back top-10 titles this year: Descent, Virtual Pool and Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep. The developer/publisher has added Frankenstein: Through The Eyes Of The Monster and Stonekeep to the stream of products this fourth quarter. Delrina NewBits STR Focus Delrina Ships WinFax PRO 7.0 for Windows 95 World+s Most Popular Fax Software Delivers Benefits of Communications Under Windows 95 with More Robust and Reliable Faxing; Over 100 New Faxing Features, Functional Improvements, and Usability Enhancements Comdex/Fall 95, Las Vegas, NV -- Sands Convention Center Booth #3544 -- November 13, 1995 -- Delrina Corporation (NASDAQ:DENAF, TC:DC), the world+s leading supplier of PC communications software for Windows, today announced the general availability of its much awaited WinFax<tm> PRO 7.0 for Microsoft<R> Windows<tm> 95. WinFax PRO 7.0 is a fifth generation product that takes full advantage of the new Windows 95 operating system, adding a host of new features, functionality and benefits. The product is designed to attract the non-technical mass market to computer-based faxing, while providing all the necessary \"power\" features for more advanced users. A New Generation of PC Fax WinFax PRO 7.0 continues to set the standard by which all other PC fax software is compared. The new version raises the level of PC faxing to a new plateau with over 100 new fax-based features, functional improvements and usability enhancements that include: z The ability to transmit up to 1/3 faster, saving users time and money, especially on long distance faxes. z The ability to fax high quality gray scale images, such as photographs with devices like the WinFax<tm> Scanner, for better looking faxes. z The ability to define recurring fax transmissions that are sent automatically, saving users from repeating tedious tasks. z Automatic hard copy confirmations of transmissions, so users can easily track faxes, and for billing purposes. z New fax preview and annotation capabilities that are easier to use and enable the user to ensure the fax they are sending looks the way they want it to. z Enhanced cover pages, with an easier to use cover page designer and a greater variety of business-oriented cover pages. z An enhanced database engine that provides faster access to phonebook entries and transmission logs for easier fax management z The new award-winning Xerox TextBridge<tm> 3.0 OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine for more accurate conversions of faxes to text. Realizing the Benefits of Communications Under Windows 95 WinFax PRO 7.0 is Windows 95 logo+d, meaning it takes advantage of all the new communications capabilities of the Windows 95 platform. WinFax PRO 7.0 is rearchitected 32-bit, multi-tasking, multi-threaded code, which delivers faster, more reliable fax communications that run completely in the background, even while running other computer-intensive applications. Now users can load a big application without worrying that their fax will be interrupted. WinFax also includes the ability to receive faxes in the background using a mini receiver (Delrina CommBar<tm>), so users do not have to load the full application, thus saving on system resources. In addition, WinFax PRO 7.0 takes advantage of Plug +n Play (through Unimodem) for easier fax modem installation and configuration, and is able to seamlessly share the communications port with other communicating applications (through TAPI). It includes full OLE 2.0 (Object Linking & Embedding) support for easy integration with other applications, so for example, users can drag and drop a document from Explore on to WinFax PRO (in the task bar) to fax it out. Delrina CommBar sits on the desktop and reports the communications status of the computer. Like the flashing red light on a telephone that indicates messages are waiting, CommBar enables the user to see all waiting messages -- faxes, e-mails, and voice messages -- directly from the Windows 95 desktop without having to launch and check each application separately. Further, since communications now run in the background, users may not know what is actually going on. CommBar provides an instant snapshot of on going or current communications activities, such as the progress of an inbound fax. Easier To Learn and Use WinFax PRO 7.0 has a refined user interface based on Microsoft Office conventions (the product is MS Office compatible), which provides consistency, ease-of-use, and reduces the learning curve between WinFax PRO 7.0 and other Office compatible applications such as Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, and Powerpoint 7.0 for Windows 95. WinFax PRO 7.0 also includes a send fax Wizard that steps the novice user through the task of sending a fax. Integrated Messaging Combined with the other components in Delrina CommSuitea 95, WinFax PRO 7.0 enables the user to manage mixed message types: faxes, voice messages (through Delrina+s TalkWorks<tm> option that provides voice mail, telephony and fax-on-demand with +voice-enabled+ modems), e-mail and paging notification. Under CommSuite 95, WinFax PRO 7.0 administers each of these messaging types in their own unique way by adapting its own interface and offering the full functionality for each message type. It also integrates with other client messaging software through MAPI, so WinFax capabilities can be directly accessed by, for example, Microsoft Exchange and vice versa. Under CommSuite 95, WinFax PRO goes a step further by enabling users to use these mixed messaging types pro-actively with its rule-based autoforwarding feature. For example WinFax PRO can notify the user upon receipt of an urgent fax (identified by the fax CSID or Caller ID) by pager through its built-in paging notification. Pricing and System Requirements Delrina WinFax PRO 7.0 has a suggested retail price of US$129 (Cdn $159) and includes Delrina+s no hassle 60-day money back guarantee. Users with any previous version of WinFax PRO can upgrade for only $49.95 (Cdn $69.95) or WinFax LITE for $59.95 (Cdn $79.95). WinFax PRO 7.0 is also included in Delrina CommSuite 95, which includes the TalkWorks telephony option, Delrina Cyberjack<tm> 7.0 (suite of Windows 95 Internet tools), and WinComm<tm> PRO 7.0 (general purpose data communications program). WinFax PRO users can upgrade to CommSuite 95, which list for $179 (Cdn $229) for $69.95 (Cdn $89.85) or from WinFax LITE for $79.95 (Cdn $109.95). WinFax PRO 7.0 requires a minimum 486-based PC running Microsoft Windows 95, a compatible fax modem, 8MB RAM (16 MB recommended) and 25MB hard disk space for a full install. More US Federal Agencies Expand their Use of Delrina FormFlow Enterprise-Wide GTSI and Loral Select FormFlow for Air Force+s Desktop IV Contract and Army+s SBIS Contract Editor's Summary: z Organizations such as Air National Guard (ANG), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) adopt enterprise- wide licensing of FormFlow with their respective 31,000, 30,000, and 5,000 user license acquisitions z Government Technology Services, Inc. (GTSI) selects FormFlow for their $655 million Air Force Desktop IV (DTIV) contract z Loral Federal Systems Group (formerly IBM Federal) selects FormFlow for Army+s $474 million Sustaining Base Information Services (SBIS) contract z Air Force Air Combat Command (ACC) completes FormFlow Filler acquisition of 25,000 users from Navy's Desktop Companion contract through GTSI z FormFlow is now available to US Federal Government customers through nine multi-year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts WASHINGTON, DC and TORONTO, Ont. -- November 13 1995 -- Delrina Corporation (NASDAQ:DENAF, TSE:DC), the leading supplier of electronic forms to the US Federal Government, today announced that its industry leading Delrina FormFlow<tm> has been selected by Government Technology Services, Inc. (GTSI) and Loral Federal Systems Group (formerly IBM Federal) for the Air Force+s Desktop IV (DTIV) contract and the Army+s Sustaining Base Information Services (SBIS) contract. FormFlow+s inclusion on these contracts facilitates its broader distribution, allowing more government agencies to take advantage of the opportunity for cost reduction and increased productivity through the implementation of electronic forms. FormFlow enables organizations to replace their paper forms with electronic versions, allowing users to fill in those forms on their computers and process them electronically. In addition, FormFlow lets organizations automate many of their existing business activities through its powerful form application development environment. GTSI is one of two prime contractors for Air Force+s $1.4 billion Desktop IV program. Effective November 7, 1995, DTIV was modified to include FormFlow and is effective through February 1998. SBIS, a $474 million ten year contract, was awarded to IBM Federal, now Loral Federal Systems Group, in June 1993. GTSI Vice President and General Manager, Integrated Systems Division, Alan Lawrence, said, \"Delrina's electronic forms products have been a huge success within Department of Defense [DoD] agencies as indicated by GTSI's sales in excess of 500,000 user licenses on Navy's Desktop Companion contract alone. GTSI's belief in this technology is further demonstrated with the recent inclusion of FormFlow on Air Force's Desktop IV contract, NASA's SEWP contract, the NIH Electronic Computer Store contract, and our GSA schedule.\" \"FormFlow's addition to the Desktop IV and SBIS contracts continues the strong partnership between Delrina and our Federal Government customers,\" said Teddy Rosenberg, General Manager, Delrina Electronic Forms Business Unit. \"The growing demand from the Federal Government and the high visibility of FormFlow within DoD reaffirms Delrina's leadership position in this marketplace and our depth of experience as the technology pioneer of electronic forms automation.\" Both contracts include the FormFlow Starter Kit and FormFlow Filler quantity packs up to 1000 users. They are available without limit to DoD agencies and, in addition, DTIV is available to Civilian agencies. FormFlow's Continued Success in US Federal Government Since 1992, Air Force, Army and other DoD agencies have used Delrina's electronic forms products to create more than 1,000 DoD-level forms. This has dramatically driven the use of FormFlow throughout DoD. Of particular importance is the trend in the way FormFlow is used. While many desktop users perform only electronic fill and print functions, a growing number of organizations such as Army's Personnel Information Systems Command (PERSINSCOM) and Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) based in Ft. Sam Houston, have taken more advanced steps with FormFlow to implement sophisticated form applications with workflow routing capabilities. The Air Force Air Combat Command (ACC) recently completed acquisition of 25,000 FormFlow users from Navy's Desktop Companion contract through GTSI, and is now distributing FormFlow enterprise-wide throughout their organization. Jonathan Futrell, Delrina's Director of Federal Sales, stated, \"Enterprise licensing is quickly becoming a preferred method of software acquisition, distribution and control. We have already seen this trend with several large organizations such as Air National Guard (ANG), MEDCOM, and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) with their respective 31,000, 30,000, and 5,000 user license acquisitions.\" The Department of Defense is expected to expand its use of FormFlow as facilitated by the DTIV contract, the SBIS contract, and seven other multi-year IDIQ contracts that include FormFlow. About Delrina FormFlow Delrina FormFlow electronic forms software allows organizations to leverage their existing technology investments to automate business processes. Organizations use FormFlow to create intelligent forms - electronic representations of paper forms with built in intelligence such as calculations, links to databases, and customized toolbars and menus. In addition, organizations can create form applications with conditional routing and deploy them enterprise-wide using their e-mail systems. These form applications present and move information using the existing networks, databases, and e-mail infrastructure. Examples of such automated business processes include travel requests, expense reporting, procurement and human resources applications. FormFlow is currently available for Windows, DOS, UNIX (SunOS, Solaris, SGI), and Macintosh, with IBM AIX, HP/UX, Windows NT, and Windows 95 versions to follow. Delrina's Electronic Forms Business Unit strategy is to support all client platforms used extensively by its customer base and prospective customers. With the rapid adoption of distributed LAN-based computing, more organizations are seeking a complete forms workflow offering like Delrina FormFlow.

The product, the Sportster ISDN 128K terminal adapter, would represent the first of several types of co-branded ISDN customer premises equipment (CPE) available for sale in retail stores. The product also will be marketed directly by Bell Atlantic. The companies plan a strategic relationship to promote widespread adoption of Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services by residential and business markets. The first relationship of its kind between a regional Bell operating company (RBOC) and an ISDN equipment supplier, this joint approach will help Bell Atlantic offer residential customers a turnkey ISDN solution, including ISDN service, equipment and installation. \"Consumers are more likely to want ISDN services if we make them easier to order, install and use by providing a turnkey solution,\" said Fred D'Alessio, president of Bell Atlantic Consumer Services. \"This agreement with U.S. Robotics allows us to provide that solution. The co-branded product will leverage the U.S. Robotics reputation for technological advancement, quality and established leadership in ISDN.\" \"Our companies' combined strengths give the consumer the best of both worlds,\" said Ross Manire, senior vice president and general manager of U.S. Robotics' Corporate/Systems Division. \"Bell Atlantic is an industry leader in providing ISDN services; U.S. Robotics provides a variety of complementary information access products. This powerful combination offers customers U.S. Robotics' advanced features and Bell Atlantic services at a price that we believe will drive consumer acceptance of ISDN.\" U.S. Robotics will sell the jointly branded Sportster ISDN 128K in its established retail channels throughout Bell Atlantic's service area; Bell Atlantic will sell the product directly to customers through Bell Atlantic InfoSpeed, a sales, provisioning and service center. The Sportster ISDN 128K terminal adapter is expected to be available in late November. U.S. Robotics and Bell Atlantic plan several joint promotions for the upcoming holiday season to raise awareness of Bell Atlantic's consumer ISDN services. These activities will encourage Bell Atlantic customers to adopt ISDN services and purchase the Sportster ISDN 128K. Bell Atlantic recently began rolling out its new residential ISDN service through its entire service region, priced at approximately $30 a month plus a small usage fee. This service and U.S. Robotics' competitively priced Sportster ISDN product will provide a cost-effective, complete ISDN solution. In addition, Bell Atlantic offers more services to assist consumers in making ISDN communications decisions. Customer contact personnel at Bell Atlantic InfoSpeed, the ISDN sales, provisioning and service center, work closely with customers to determine appropriate service features and equipment for their specific applications. Bell Atlantic also offers consumers installation for ISDN equipment and premises wiring. When an ISDN line is installed, Bell Atlantic can install the inside wiring and CPE, and test the connection and configuration to ensure the customer's application will run smoothly. The Sportster ISDN 128K's features allow customers to take full advantage of ISDN's increased bandwidth. U.S. Robotics' Turbo PPP feature set works with industry standards for maximum performance, including: enhanced throughput with any Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) application; multiple types of data compression for potential throughput up to 512 Kbps; and Multilink PPP, for an aggregate line rate of 128 Kbps. The product also includes voice support, with dynamic allocation of a 64 Kbps voice channel; and an integrated NT-1 (network termination device). No other device is needed to connect to ISDN services. The Sportster ISDN 128K also supports NDIS, ODI, Packet Driver, WinISDN and TAPI interfaces for use with popular Internet, remote access and data communications software packages. It also provides enhanced performance with Windows 95. U.S. Robotics/Bell Atlantic: Complementary Strengths \"U.S. Robotics was the logical vendor to assist us as we deploy consumer ISDN services in the retail market,\" said Curt Koeppen, Bell Atlantic Consumer Services vice president-ISDN. \"Name recognition is important, and U.S. Robotics has a very well-established name for its information access equipment. U.S. Robotics' market presence and products, combined with Bell Atlantic's complete service solutions, will give consumers the confidence to embrace high-speed ISDN offerings.\" In addition to designing and manufacturing single-user client products, U.S. Robotics has a range of ISDN remote access servers for data centers and branch offices. This full range of products allows U.S. Robotics to meet information access needs of any size. \"The relationship gives both companies the opportunity to explore working together on other information access applications,\" said Manire. \"As one of the most progressive RBOCs in the ISDN arena and the largest supplier of ISDN lines in the U.S., Bell Atlantic recommends a variety of solutions for business customers. Our broad product line allows them to solve a more comprehensive range of business applications that include ISDN.\" Bell Atlantic, through its subsidiary Bell Atlantic Network Integration, Inc., currently recommends and resells U.S. Robotics' Total Control Enterprise Network Hub for high-capacity network access needs. The release of the PRI Access System for the Enterprise Network Hub allows Bell Atlantic to recommend a complete, end-to-end solution for ISDN access. Bell Atlantic has installed more than 133,000 ISDN lines for business and government customers throughout its service area, making the company the largest supplier of local ISDN lines in the U.S. U.S. Robotics is one of the world's leading suppliers of products and systems that provide access to information. The company designs, manufactures, markets and supports remote access servers, enterprise communications systems, desktop/mobile client products and modems that connect computers and other equipment aver analog, digital and switched cellular networks, enabling users to gain access to, manage and share data, fax and voice information. Its customers include Internet service providers, regional Bell operating companies and a wide range of other large corporations, businesses, institutions and individuals. The company's 1994 sales were $499.0 million; sales for the first nine months of fiscal 1995 were $596.0 million. Bell Atlantic Corporation is at the forefront of the new communications, entertainment and information industry. In the mid-Atlantic region, the company is the premier provider of local telecommunications and advanced services. Globally, it is one of the largest investors in the high-growth wireless communication marketplace. Bell Atlantic also owns a substantial interest in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand and is actively developing high-growth national and international business opportunities in all phases of the industry. Atari Jaguar/Computer Section Dana Jacobson, Editor >From the Atari Editor's Desk \"Saying it like it is! The holidays are rapidly approaching. It's easy to tell that winter is coming, also. The northeast was hammered this week with a number of \"nor'easters\" various areas have been buried under a lot of snow already and it's only mid November! We got hit good in Boston earlier in the week with heavy rain. As usual, we lost power here for awhile, which is typical. Life is never boring in New England! Still extremely quiet on the computing side of things Atari. You may have noticed that I didn't even have an Atari computing section last week. Even my usual editorial was bumped and all of my comments were left to our Jaguar section since that's where they really belonged last week after the news of the recent layoffs at Atari hit the streets. We're still looking for people who are interested in writing some articles or two to include in this section of STReport. Have some fond memories or disaster stories related to using Atari computers? Why not reflect on those events and share them with everyone? Drop me a line. Until then, we've got the holidays to look forward to while we continue to take advantage of our favorite Atari computers. Until next time... The Atari Community E-mail Address Book An Online Who's Who Revised 5-Nov-95 Hello all! This list has been compiled to provide Atarians worldwide with the addresses to contact other members of our ever-changing Atari community. There are 4 distinct sections - user groups, Atari computer contacts, Jaguar and Lynx contacts, and World Wide Web pages. Please note that addresses that are of interest to both Atari computer users AND Jag/Lynx owners will be found in the computer section. Using this list - I created this list to encourage communication between Atarians everywhere. If you have a question without an answer, or are moving soon and need to find a new user group, this list should help. It is also a great way to distribute Atari related press releases, such as upcoming Atari shows and new product announcements. And I would LOVE to see user groups sharing newsletter articles via these addresses! However, it SHOULD NOT be used as an advertising tool. If you are a retailer looking to advertise, please contact the individuals on the list and ask if they want to receive your mailings. Some people must pay for their e-mail by the character and would not want unsolicited commercial mailings. If you have any changes, additions, or suggestions, please contact me via private e-mail. My addresses are listed under AUNT.

More Run PC News! Hover Strike CD Review! CATnips! And Much More! >From the Editor's Controller - Playin' it like it is! Last week's news regarding the recent layoffs and firings at Atari continue to generate discussion, on*line and off. It's amazing to see the rumors and speculation fly on the Usenet these days. It's not surprising that people are reacting this way; we're always wondering what is going on in Sunnyvale. However, it is surprising to see this speculation being represented as facts as to what happened, by people who would have no idea as to what actually happened. We've included some comments made, with responses, later in this issue judge for yourself. The games are still coming, contrary to reports that Atari has shut down and abandoned the Jaguar! We just got word that \"Dragon's Lair\" has started hitting dealer shelves on Thursday. This is another CD title, and one that I'll personally be looking for shortly * I'm one of those people who has never seen this game on any platform, including the ST! More games are on the way folks; just check out our \"coming soon\" list below. I've been splitting my playing time among a number of games lately. Rayman has been getting most of my attention, but I've been playing more and more with Hover Strike (CD) and Pitfall, The Mayan Adventure. I'll be the first to admit that I can't believe that there are too many games out there that I want to devote some playing time to, and can't find the time! But, I like it this way * keep 'em coming Atari! Even though we're going to fall far short of that \"approaching 100\" games in time for Christmas, I have to admit that the recent couple of month's game releases have all been excellent, either from experience or online reactions. I hope that this situation continues; and it appears that will. I've just learned that there will be a large Jaguar promotional event going on in the El Paso, Texas area sometime soon. Although information is sketchy at the moment, it appears that about 30 McDonalds will be giving away Jaguars. There will be radio promotions and likely other events occurring. We've been told to expect more news soon, so stay tuned. Also, I've been told that this is a local promotional event, not an Atari*sponsored one (just to prevent those \"why did Atari limit this promotion to one city?\" comments!). Our Jaguar game listing has been updated recently; and after the shake*ups at Atari which included the delays or cancellations of some expected games, we suggest that you give the current list a look to see what the progress is on those games you're anticipating. We've also got that review of \"Hover Strike: Unconquered Lands\" review that I've been promising. Other games in the process of being reviewed include Power Drive Rally, Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure, Highlander, and Ruiner Pinball. There are others, as well, on the way. It should be an exciting next couple of months if things continue as they have been with regard to new game releases. Until next time...

Jacobson Developed by: Atari Corporation Published by: Atari Corporation Price: $59.99 Hover Strike: Unconquered Lands (HS-UL from now on) is the first Jaguar CD title to come out, excluding the pack in games. For a first title, Atari has a major hit. The premise: \"Fear the worst for the missing colonists. Terrakian Pirates have taken over a distant planet and they're patrolling every section of the surface. Only a state-of-the-art armored hovered craft, equipped with a rapid fire cannon and powerful missiles, can battle through 40 levels of fully texture-mapped 3D levels, including Night Vision missions. Knock out key targets and make way for the Federation armada. Save the colony before it's too late!\" HS-UL initially reminded me of Cybermorph, one of my early Jaguar favorites. The basics are there: travel to a planet and knock out pre-defined targets before going on to the next. Once you've achieved your goal, you have the option to select your next mission. Like Cybermorph, once you arrive at your selected destination, your goal is to fly your fully-armed hovercraft all over the planet searching for, and destroying, your targets. Along the way, you're confronted by various defenses which you must destroy, or flee. To help you in your goal, you'll also find fuel and ammunition on the planet's surface. I've played both the cart version of Hover Strike and the CD version. The CD version contains the same missions as the cart, but there are many additional missions as well as some improvements and options. Both are quite good, but I prefer the CD version. When you load the game, you're greeted with some nice Full Motion Video (FMV) sequences. I prefer the FMV, if done well and it's fairly short, to \"set up\" the game and to aid the transitional stages of the game. The FMV in HS-UL is really done well, if somewhat repetitious in areas. But, you can always bypass any of it at the press of a fire button, at any time (a useful feature!). After the introduction sequences, you're faced with selecting your initial mission. If you're fortunate to have a Memory Cart (highly recommended for a game of this nature), you'll have the option of starting a new game or a previously started one. You can also change your saved options. To make it easy, let's start a new game. You begin the game with three hovercrafts (lives). Before you select a mission to start playing, it's important to select your various options. You can leave the background music on or off * a nice feature for those hectic missions where you need total concentration! You can also control the volume of the sound effects (leave them loud!). Joypad controls are important so you'll be able to get the right feel for you. The controls involve acceleration, weapons firing button, and the brakes. You can also change the gunsight control, up and down, via the joypad. What I feel is a significant change from the cart version to the CD version is the ability to alter the controls of the hovercraft with regard to how it reacts during gameplay. Although there are defaults depending on the difficulty selected, they are configurable. The cart version doesn't have these options. The hovercraft controls are: Hover Mode: Like the cart version, controlling your hovercraft's movement requires getting used to doing. Once you're adjusted to maneuvering the hovercraft well, you'll be able to concentrate on the mission at*hand. However, in HS*UL you have the ability to turn off the hovercraft's \"characteristics\". Unlike the cart version, if you let up on the accelerator, your hovercraft stops. Terrain Damage: In the cart version, running into any of the planet terrain causes damage to your hovercraft; in the CD version, you can turn on/off this characteristic. Reactions When Hit: In the cart version, your hovercraft will move when hit by an attacker; in the CD version, you can turn on/off this characteristic. FMV: You have the option to see all FMV or shut it off. Save Game: Only available on the CD version with the Memory Track in-use. You can save up to two games in progress. With the cart version, you can save a game but I'm not sure how many saved game \"slots\" are available. To control your craft, you need to use two of the three fire buttons. The 'A' button allows you to accelerate and the 'C' button is the brake. Using both buttons simultaneously allows you to go backwards. These are the default options which can be changed. The 'B' fire button is your main fire button, using a photon cannon. Alternate weapons, if available, include missiles, guided missiles, and mortars. In some missions, you'll automatically have access to flares to light up parts of darkened planets. I've found that my mortars and guided missiles are my dominant weapons, but I'll use the normal missiles and cannon quite a bit also to save my supply of the others when not needed. I've found the game to be quite enjoyable, although frustrating at times. Controlling the hovercraft is very important, and sometimes difficult. This is something that is necessary to overcome before you can really enjoy the game. The only times that control plays a major factor, other then when you turn all of the \"hovercraft modes\" on, is when you're flying into craters and other \"valleys\" during the game. It's not simple to get yourself out of these areas of a planet's terrain. This brings me to one other factor of the game that I was disappointed with * pilot perspective. You have two options, when flying, to view the game looking out the windshield or far above and behind your craft. I prefer the windshield option, but it's a limited view * you can only see directly in front of you with little peripheral vision. I would have preferred the external view to be slightly above and behind my craft. Perhaps I'm being picky, but I think I'd enjoy the game more in this mode. I haven't found a really good use for the existing external view, yet. The graphics are excellent in this game. I understand that the graphics are fully textured 3D. The landscape on the planets is really nice, although repetitious after a while. The enemies encountered look terrific! Whether they be stationary defenses, mobile land attackers, or various ships * they're unique and look (and play) very well. When being fired upon, the incoming salvo looks good. Likewise, when you fire and hit your targets, the resulting explosions make it all worthwhile. The music is pretty good, but I tend to turn it off after awhile as I tend to get distracted. The game's sound effects are very good; and I usually have the volume turned all the way up for the best effect! The manual is better than I expected. There's a good description of the game, how to control your craft, weapons, options, enemy descriptions (including pictures),tips and strategy, and much more. The entertainment value of this game I rate very high. This is a FUN game to play. It's not easy, but not so difficult that you'll be likely to try it a couple of times and put it aside. I keep finding myself playing it even replacing my gaming time with Rayman, which I was hooked on and haven't completed yet! I wish that I had more free time to really work at completing this game. I'm currently in the second set of missions, about half way through them. This is a game that I really want to keep playing and beat; and I know that after beating it I'll still be enthusiastic about starting all over again and bettering my scores, trying different strategies, and enjoying it all over again! I'm also looking forward to playing this game in two player cooperative mode where one player controls the flying while the other controls the weapons. This should be interesting. Reviewer's Rating 8.5 Entertainment: 9.5 Reviewer's Overall: 9.0 Overall, this is one game that I would highly recommend. If you have a JaguarCD, I'd suggest the CD version over the cart. There's nothing wrong with the cart version, but the CD has more missions and a number of options that the cart version doesn't, as mentioned earlier. HS UL looks great, sounds good, plays well, and is very enjoyable. I can find very little to complain about with this game other than getting used to controlling the hovercraft and the view perspectives. One comment I'd like to make about the various FMV sequences is that it's quite good. There is one humorous sequence if you're not a perfect player. Since you start off with three hovercrafts, there's a good chance that one of your crafts will be destroyed. When you succeed in a mission, the FMV that you encounter is your hovercraft being picked up from the planet's surface and brought back to your base of operations. Looks nice, sounds nice, but gets boring eventually. However, if your hovercraft is disabled or destroyed, the FMV sequence is a little different! When returned to your base, the transport ship enters the hangar, maneuvers to the docking area, and then just drops your hovercraft! The first time that I saw that sequence, I almost fell out of my chair laughing. It was just so unexpected and funny. Jaguar Cheats, & Hints STR InfoFile - Solving Those Riddles! Hover Strike: Unconquered Lands Tips and Strategies This is not an \"official\" tip-sheet, but I thought I'd offer some strategy suggestions and tips that I've found to work fairly well while checking out the game for review. Keep track of your available weapons (missiles, guided missiles, and mortars) and watch your fuel and shield energy. You can accomplish your mission without the special weapons, but I wouldn't recommend it as it will take more time and energy to do so. Once you run out of fuel, or your shields are depleted, it's all over. The second important factor to remember is to utilize the hover craft's radar and target \"lock\" to your advantage. Many players will be tempted to find their targets and go up against them head-to-head. Wrong! While it can be fun and exhilarating, it's dangerous. This is war. You have some great \"artillery\" so use it. Your radar scope has three rings which determine the distance from your targets. An"
