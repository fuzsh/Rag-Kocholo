        "text": "Eric Hahn returned from a 10-week Italian holiday to take on arguably the hottest title in Silicon Valley - Netscape's chief technology officer. The plum post once belonged to company co-founder and \"Internet poster boy\" Marc Andreessen, who now carries the much less glamorous title of executive vice president for products - although those in the know say that the title change isn't much more than that.\n\n\"In the insular, incestuous culture of Silicon Valley, [the CTO title equals] big status points,\" said Jim Balderston, analyst at Zona Research, \"but for the end user and the direction of Netscape's product strategy, it means zero.\"\n\nNetscape has already shifted into a strategy right up Hahn's alley: serving the enterprise market Hahn targeted with the company he founded, Collabra Software, a maker of programs facilitating online project collaboration in the corporate setting. And Hahn, who was \"acquired\" by Netscape in November 1995 when it bought Collabra, has been playing a significant role in developing the company's corporate-appeal technology as head of the server products division.\n\nNoticeably excited about his new job, Hahn downplayed how his promotion would affect Andreessen's role. \"We've kind of traded responsibilities back and forth,\" he explained. \"Marc now has a huge operational responsibility ... with about 1,000 people working for him.\" Hahn, meanwhile, says he has a \"small\" team - totaling in the double digits - reporting to him.\n\nHowever, analysts say Andreessen, far from being an operational powerhouse, has become a company figurehead to grace trade-show auditoriums, and perhaps still provide a bit of creative vision. \"While Marc is extremely smart, his background is not in networking and the enterprise market,\" said Tim Bajarin, a Silicon Valley insider and president of Creative Strategies. He explained Hahn's promotion by saying that Netscape is \"making their money in the backend stuff that Eric lives and breathes, and even more so, likes.\"\n\nHahn would likely agree. \"My dance card is already quite full of things I am passionately interested in,\" he said on his first day on the job. His responsibilities include defining new technologies, continuing the Netscape tradition of collaborating with universities to develop new technologies, keeping new products in the pipeline, and identifying potential acquisition opportunities.\n\n\"We are explicitly omitting the role of advancing technology for its own sake,\" he explained, adding that if Netscape doesn't see an immediate product application, it won't try to develop the technology.\n\nBut given the eager tone of his voice, it's hard to imagine him saying no to any new technology. \"I'm thrilled,\" he said about his new job - and his recent \"sabbatical in Tuscany\". Returning with a fresh perspective, he says he's got \"some new, different thinking for our company.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Silicon Valley's Billionaire Elegy\n\nVenture capitalists Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen claim the tech industry, California, and the country are doomed if we don’t embrace the former president.\n\nOpenAI Slashes the Cost of Using Its AI With a “Mini” Model\n\nWith competing models—including many free ones—flooding the market, OpenAI is announcing a cheaper way to use its AI.\n\nElon Musk Says He’s Moving X and SpaceX Headquarters to Texas\n\nThe tech mogul cited California’s new transgender rights law as “the final straw” for moving out of the state.\n\nApple, Nvidia, Anthropic Used Thousands of Swiped YouTube Videos to Train AI\n\nCreators claim their videos were used without their knowledge.\n\nHow to Get Rich From Peeping Inside People’s Fridges\n\nForget the S&P 500. Look at the ice cream. This investor visits homes around the world to see where diets—and economies—will go next.\n\nThe Hidden Ties Between Google and Amazon’s Project Nimbus and Israel's Military\n\nA WIRED investigation found public statements from officials detail a much closer link between Project Nimbus and Israel Defense Forces than previously reported."
