No, it's not the Internet--it's groupware!\n\nThe move from centralized computing resources (mainframes) to the desktop computer provided users with powerful tools to increase their individual productivity, but did little to enhance group processes (e.g. workflow, meetings, paste-up sessions). The proliferation of Internet applications with the attendant externalities has provided opportunities to apply the externalities of Internet access to group collaboration and workflow. In other words, now that everyone is surfing the net, why not surf your office?\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is groupware? Some look at groupware and see mostly e-mail, while others describe it primarily as discussion forums. Still others identify groupware as a development platform for custom applications. In its narrowest sense, an e-mail system can be (and has been) considered groupware, the purpose of which is to improve worker communications and productivity. In its broadest sense, groupware integrates messaging, collaborative work processes, and workflow management to enable electronic work groups and collaborative efforts within a distributed workforce. Though messaging features are important, groupware covers more than basic e-mail. Key elements of groupware include:\n\nE-mail\n\nNot surprisingly, e-mail continues to be groupware's focal point. E-mail is the most popular application within company networks, and the most popular Internet application next to Web browsing.\n\nCalendaring and scheduling\n\nThreaded discussions, conferencing. The arrival of Internet culture into corporations has brought with it real-time collaboration tools such as chat and electronic whiteboarding--functions not associated with traditional groupware.\n\nShared documents\n\nTask and workflow management\n\nForms creation, processing, and routing\n\nDatabase access\n\nDevelopment tools\n\nWhile Domino, Exchange, and GroupWise come with impressive, ready-to-use clients, some organizations need to develop custom groupware applications from the ground up. Seasoned groupware products such as Lotus Domino and Microsoft Exchange deliver solid platforms for developing both conventional and Web applications.\n\nRemote support\n\nOne major problem with groupware is that it involves so many different pieces, it's difficult to bring them all together so that there's a common platform and a workable environment for rapid application development (RAD).\n\nGroupware, the Internet and Intranets\n\nAround 1995, when Netscape purchased Lotus competitor Collabra Software, Inc. and announced its plans to bring groupware to the Web, many information technology observers and participants said that proprietary groupware was doomed to disappear because of the rise of the Internet and the corporate intranets based on open standards that came with it. The pundits said the Internet would grind proprietary groupware into dust. However, the major players in the groupware market rolled with the punches and shifted gears by beginning the long but rewarding process of adapting their systems to open standards.\n\nMuch progress has been made in this direction and although there is still much left to be done, today groupware can form the heart of corporate intranets. Groupware and intranets are two technology phenomena definitely meant for each other. Corporate Webs provide the perfect backdrop for collaborative work, providing an easily accessible, ubiquitous platform for gathering and sharing information. As an example of the collaboration demonstrated by groupware and intranets, consider the following. Many intranets are built around Web servers delivering HTML pages. The latest releases of groupware provide for dynamic on the fly conversion of any database or application into HTML. The addition of groupware applications to the intranet, therefore, is only natural as a way to leverage an intranet's power.\n\nToday's groupware systems blend Internet openness with polished proprietary environments, although proprietary groupware still provides more functionality than Internet-based implementations. But regardless of the type of application, all groupware systems these days show the unmistakable trend toward Internet software and protocols. To varying degrees, then, all the groupware systems today are a blend of proprietary functions and Internet standards.\n\nDistinct Approaches\n\nA pivotal element in the groupware wars will be development tools that let users customize their applications and tailor forms to a company's specific needs. The cry for communications protocol and data format standards, the popularity of the web browser as a universal client, and the possibility of a multi-platform development tool -- Java -- makes for an amazing degree of interoperability. This also opens the door for new groupware participants, both startups and established companies, that can now more easily plug in to these existing groupware architectures using Java, JavaScript, and ActiveX.\n\nGeneral Characteristics\n\nIS managers agree that the benefits of Internet-based groupware far outweigh the cost and the pain of implementation.\n\nWith newsgroups and discussion databases -- two groupware staples -- team members outfitted with Web tools share ideas and techniques that result in faster product development. They can avoid pitfalls by reviewing previous project details stored in corporate knowledge repositories, another groupware basic. With desktop videoconferencing, also a groupware service, even those located in distant locations can easily participate in meetings and design reviews.\n\nTeams of people in different locations can collaborate on bids or build client profiles with the help of public folders. You can post information in a common database so it can be used as needed by the organization. There are less redundancies and a significant cost reduction.\n\nHuman/Computer Interaction\n\nA smooth groupware installation is grounded in the understanding that the selection and cost of the solution is only half the battle. The first step is to get the whole company involved, even if it means instituting special programs to rally the troops. There must be a willingness to invest in training of new and existing employees if groupware implementations are to be successful. Otherwise, peopleís reluctance to change may be groupwareís biggest obstacle. One key factor for success or failure in implementing a groupware solution is how receptive the employees are to working together. The most success is likely to come if the employees are searching for ways to collaborate, and they believe that groupware is the answer.\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nWhen Lotus Development Corporation introduced the groupware concept eight years ago with Notes, it had an open, proprietary field to play on. Lotus got such a jump on the competition, it quickly became a game of catch-up for everyone else, including such powerhouses as Microsoft Corporation and Novell, Incorporated. Lotus Notes, Exchange and GroupWise, each developed before the advent of intranets, relied on traditional client/server architecture. But, the Internet changed all that. When intranets started popping up, it was natural to think of how they could be used to reduce groupware expenses. And that's just what a new breed of vendors did, resulting in the creation of some inexpensive intranet-specific groupware products. These products, from vendors such as Netscape Communications Corp., are compelling for managers who have wanted groupware but haven't been able to justify the high cost. With the intranet infrastructure already in place, they can simply add the application to the Web server so all browsers can access it. Some cases may require additional components or plug-ins for the browser, but these solutions are still less expensive, and easier to deploy and administer than traditional client/server groupware offerings. Netscape Communications Corporation, is thus the latest strong contender for the groupware throne. Lotus, Microsoft, and Novell are playing catch-up in the Internet-standards race and have only recently begun to run neck-and-neck with Netscape. While Lotus, Microsoft and Novell scramble to re-engineer to open standards, Netscape must quickly develop functionality. Competition is just starting to heat up. Lotus quickly responded to this new product wave by dropping the price of its Notes desktop client from $155 to $69 and starting its push onto the Web. Other proprietary groupware vendors are rapidly Web-enabling their products, as well. Web browsers, in fact, may soon replace proprietary clients altogether. Whether Lotus can remain king of the groupware hill remains to be seen, but for now, with close to 10 million Notes users, it's still the company to beat.\n\n\"The most interesting race is between Lotus and Netscape -- who will deliver a Java-ized product first,\" Gartner Group's Tom Austin, vice president of electronic workplace technology, says. \"They will be within one quarter of each other, but it's too close to call at this point.\" Austin, who anticipates there will be 100 million groupware users by 2002, believes Netscape will surpass Novell next year and by 2000 be the number three player with 15 to 18 percent of the groupware market. He further predicts that Microsoft will cut significantly into Lotus' marketshare and draw even, each claiming 32 percent. Novell will drop to the number four spot with about 10 percent, and the rest of the pie will be divided among the remaining vendors.\n\nEvaluation\n\nIn evaluating groupware there are several key areas which should be examined.\n\nAdministration\n\nYou should examine the ease of installation and management of the system across multiple servers. The system must allow remote administration from anywhere on the network. The system should share user and group information among its modules to allow the administrator to make changes and implement security easily. Assign higher grades to products that integrate with the network operating system or public directories, such as those that use LDAP. Systems that allow data synchronization between servers and offer encryption are preferable. Migration tools to move user information and data from existing systems is important.\n\nMessaging\n\nStandard client e-mail features including text-formatting capabilities, delivery options, attachment support, and user-configurable views are essential. On the server, you expect a single message store, support for multiple directories, and robust routing features. Better ratings go to products that integrate e-mail with discussion and scheduling modules. You should explore whether the system handles HTML and MIME formats, and POP3 and SMTP protocols natively or through translation gateways.\n\nCollaboration\n\nIt is important to consider discussion groups, rating the ease of posting and editing messages as well as attaching documents. Rate the ability to collapse threads for easy navigation and readability, and require a visual indication of which messages have been read and those that are unread. Look for multiple ways of viewing the information (for example, by user, date, or topic). Products should contain moderator and security features. The best systems include strong search tools. Products with a built-in NNTP interface allow interoperability with Internet newsgroup readers.\n\nScheduling\n\nLook for scheduling features for users, groups, and resources that provide time-conflict resolution, free-time searches, and creation of recurring events. Give higher scores to products that include strong notification features integrated with e-mail. The scheduler module should share address books with other groupware modules, and you should look for products that can communicate with public directories as well.\n\nApplications development\n\nEvaluate the tools for customizing groupware environments for made-to-order applications. Products that include forms designing and scripting tools are preferable. Developers need the ability to access the groupware data stores as well as access external database formats easily. The highest rankings should go to products that make all groupware module functions available in both native and open formats, such as HTML. The product's architecture should require minimal or no additional work to develop applications for both native and open environments. Look for development capabilities that allow tight interrelationships of all groupware functions.\n\nThe Software\n\nLotus Notes\n\nNotes has considerable seniority. Since it was the first groupware product introduced into the market, it has had more time to build a user base. Today it still has the larger part of the market. However, Lotus must have seen the writing on the wall for proprietary systems. They've adapted well--in their latest release, they've become Internet-compatible while maintaining their high level of functionality. A more in-depth look at this product is available here.\n\nMicrosoft Exchange\n\nWith its groupware offering, it looks like Microsoft hopes to do to Notes what its Excel spreadsheet software did to Lotus 1-2-3. Exchange's new Outlook client has gotten mostly positive reviews for its ease of use. Exchange's latest version also incorporates support for Internet standards. Yet at its heart, Exchange remains a Windows package.\n\nNetscape Communicator\n\nCollabra is actually just one part of a suite of products designed for Intranets. On the client end is Netscape Communicator, consisting of Composer, Conference, Collabra, Calendar, and Mail. On the server end is Netscape Suitespot, which has servers for all of Communicator's modules. What sets these products apart from other groupware? From the beginning, they have been based on established Internet standards, rather than proprietary ones. Collabra essentially allows you to set up Usenet newsgroups for internal use.\n\n\"As the newcomer to the groupware market, Netscape bases its platform on Internet standards or quasi-standards, which is appealing to customers afraid of being locked into one vendor for their strategic groupware platforms. The downside is that standards tend to move slower than the marketplace. However, as its product offerings mature, Netscape will likely extend the standards to provide new cutting-edge features just as the more established groupware vendors are doing.\" (Databased Web Advisor, September 1997.)\n\nHabanero by the National Center for SuperComputer Applications (NCSA)\n\nHabanero is a Java-based framework for distributed objects (Java, of course!) In fact, it is possibly the first Java-based groupware product released so far*. Intended as collaborative software for scientists, it features a variety of applets, scientific and otherwise.\n\nGroupware Attributes\n\nDeferred communication\n\nAll of the products we looked at are good at this. As Infoworld pointed out in their test comparison (April 21, 1997, p. 68): \"At the end of the day, you could end up with a tool that enhances communication between employees, streamlines the idea flow, and maybe even helps spark some new ideas. You could also end up with a glorified e-mail package. Nothing is guaranteed.\" At the very least, these are glorious glorified e-mail packages indeed.\n\nExchange 5.5 not only does e-mail, but it adds many bells and whistles such as \"Message Flag\" which marks messages with due-dates or reminders, \"Auto-Preview\" which lets you see the first three lines of any message and decide whether you want the rest or not, and automatic hyperlinking of e-mail and web addresses. Also included are features such as \"Document Map,\" \"AutoText\", and spell/grammar-checking, which should look familiar to anyone who has used Word 97 (which I haven't.) The downside: no support for multiple e-mail accounts.\n\nReal-time communication\n\nText\n\nMicrosoft Exchange supports chatting with the Microsoft Exchange Chat Service, which presumably acts as a server for chatrooms. Exchange's Outlook client includes NetMeeting, which includes a chat feature.\n\nCommunicator has recently signed a deal with AOL to license their live chat software. Habanero also supports chat.\n\nVoice and Video\n\nMicrosoft's NetMeeting handles this as well. It also can block incoming calls while you're in a voice conference.\n\nCommunicator has a built-in \"Internet phone\", not video, but is compatible with video products from other vendors.\n\nVideo is not currently implemented directly in NetMeeting, Notes, or Exchange&emdash;but they can work with \"compatible products\" from other companies. Microsoft has a separate product called NetShow which streams video either live or on-demand. To view NetShow \"broadcasts\" you need the NetShow client.\n\nHabanero currently lacks video and voice features, but they could be added.\n\nAt the moment, live collaboration software seems to be dominated by smaller companies, much as the document management area is dominated by the major groupware companies. Over this time, this is expected to change: either the groupware applications will continue to get bulkier and add more features, or they will become more \"modular\" and allow mixing and matching of features (like Habanero).\n\nWorkflow management\n\nNotes, Communicator, and Exchange all offer calendar programs. They appear to be fairly similar in functionality; allowing the user to check other people's schedules and post his or her own. Communicator's calendar displays in HTML; Exchange's calendar can be accessed through Outlook or the Web; and Lotus is also jumping on the HTML bandwagon and making the Notes calendar viewable through a web browser.\n\nHabanero does not currently have a calendar feature.\n\nSecure transactions\n\nNetscape's software supports RSA Security encryption, SSL, and certificates.\n\nHabanero, as the programmers confess frankly in their documentation, has no security features right now, although these are \"planned.\"\n\nExchange uses S/MIME (also supported by Netscape) to allow clients to send encrypted mail to each other. It also supports SSL, and accepts X.509 certificates such as those issued by VeriSign or Microsoft's own Certificate Server.\n\nAuthentication of participants\n\nExchange's mail client has menu options for logging in using Secure Password Authentication. Apparently though, there is no utility for administrators to set up users&emdash;Exchange relies on Window's user profiles, which means that users have to set themselves up. All security in Exchange depends on Windows NT, which uses the \"challenge/response\" method of authentication.\n\nHabanero has \"I.D. cards\" which are filled out by the users themselves and are displayed (along with photos, if available). However, there is currently no function to verify that a participant is who she says she is.\n\nDistributed or Centralized server(s)\n\nThe server component of Communicator, Netscape Suitespot, is particularly flexible, supporting multiple administrators and servers, all of which can be set up through the Netscape browser. However, all of these packages support distribution of their functions at least in part.\n\nProprietary\n\nHabanero is very open, but closely tied to Sun's version of Java.\n\nCommunicator is primarily based on Internet standards--however, remember that Netscape is the company responsible for inventing HTML tags like \"blink\", as well as the language called Javascript, so they do have trouble resisting the temptation to \"innovate.\"\n\nMicrosoft Exchange (version 5.5) has been revised to support Internet standards such as IMAP, LDAP, MIME, SNMP, SMTP, POP3, SSL, and IRC. However, Microsoft-only technologies are alive and well&emdash;there's Collaboration Data Objects (the CDO formally known as Active Messaging). And then there's the fact that to access most of the features of Exchange, whether you're an end-user or an administrator, you need to have a Wintel machine. Exchange is tightly integrated with NT and BackOffice.\n\nLotus Notes remains proprietary at heart, but like Exchange, has been rewritten to take advantage of Internet standards.\n\nExtensibility\n\nHabanero has a lot of promise in this area--NCSA's site describes applets that have already been written for this fledgling product. The idea is that you can write Java applets and run them within Habanero.\n\nExchange can be customized using electronic forms (including HTML-based forms), C++, and Microsoft's own Visual Basic and ActiveX.\n\nOne of Notes' strengths has always been that skilled users can use it to write applications for their intranets. This has not changed in the latest version.\n\nNetscape currently lacks good development tools; however this is expected to change very soon with the release of the next version of Suitespot.\n\nCompatibility with other applications\n\nSuitespot offers connectivity to databases through its Javascript database object. This gives you the potential to add a lot of power to your groupware setup.\n\nMicrosoft's strategy appears to be to design all of its software so that it interoperates seamlessly at every level. The hope is that everyone will be serving their Intranets from Windows NT machines, running Microsoft BackOffice as their enterprise server and Exchange Server as their groupware server, with their users running Windows 95 or NT Workstation, the Office suite, and of course the Exchange client software. Accordingly, it exchanges information easily with Excel, Access, etc.\n\nHowever, Exchange does acknowledge the presence of other programs. It can exchange e-mail and directory information with Lotus cc:Mail, and is quite helpful about helping users migrate from other packages.\n\nCommunicator and Habanero are extremely compatible with other applications.\n\nPlatform independence\n\nThis has been Exchange's weak spot--its server only runs on Windows NT, and Outlook--Exchange's primary component--currently only works on Windows 95 or NT machines. With version 5.0 there is an Exchange client available for Mac and Windows 3.1, that is not as good or as integrated (you need one program to read your mail and use public folders, and another one for scheduling and task management). This is supposedly about to change with 5.5, but Microsoft ports to the Macintosh platform have historically been rather klunky. You will be able to get to your mailbox, discussion groups, directory, and calendar server through your web browser though; HTML support is being added.\n\nNotes' server component runs on several platforms (though not the Macintosh); the Notes client runs on Windows 3.1, 95, NT, and Mac.\n\nNetscape's server runs on Alpha, many varieties of Unix, and Windows NT; Communicator runs on just about everything.\n\nHabanero runs on anything that can run Java.\n\nUsability\n\nLotus has been in the groupware game longer than any of the others, and, unsurprisingly, is considered better at it than the others. Its latest software got rave reviews from several magazines.\n\nNetscape Communicator tends to get praise for its ease of use as well. It helps that Netscape's web browser is still the most widely used (although Internet Explorer may be catching up), because people are already familiar with its interface and can easily learn the features of Collabra, Calendar, and Conference. Even Netscape's server software (Netscape Suitespot) can be administered through the browser.\n\nExchange is generally praised for usability, but condemned for perhaps trying to do too much.The new Outlook client can basically take over your desktop, providing an all-in-one interface to all of your files as well as your shared (or \"public\") files, e-mail, and groupware programs.\n\nHabanero trails the others in ease of use. This is not surprising for a product that was really intended to be an experiment for a select population (scientists) and has yet to see its official release. However, reading through the documentation reveals that installation and configuration of the server and client software is not for the faint of heart. However, it's an interesting experiment that comes with a wide range of applications not available with other groupware packages (check out the live weather module, Collabsentence, and Visible Human!)\n\nWhere groupware is headed\n\nWhen Lotus first released Notes, the Internet wasn't a consideration for most businesses. A company could set up an internal network, buy a server, computers, and client software, and everyone would be (fairly) happy. Network externalities dictated that everyone be computerized, but company information could be kept internal--there was no pressure to make internal networks available to outsiders.\n\nNow, of course, everyone wants to be on the Internet, and there are other factors as well, such as the increased popularity of telecommuting, the growing mobility of workers, and the globalization of trade. The latest buzzword is \"Extranet\", or the use of the Internet as a conduit to connect companies and give them access to each other's data in a secure manner. It is obviously much easier to set up a connection between two local networks if those networks use compatible software. The groupware developers clearly hope to capitalize on this new market by moving their software from proprietary protocols to Internet standards. With their considerable experience in designing user-friendly software they have a good chance of success.\n\nIn short, the Internet is not going to make groupware disappear any time soon!\n\nBibliography\n\nBackground Reading about Groupware\n\nMeetings without Walls\n\n(Internet World, October 1997, p. 53)\n\nA look at collaborative software packages, including standalone whiteboard and conferencing software.
