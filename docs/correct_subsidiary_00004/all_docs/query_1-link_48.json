        "text": "March 6, 1997\n\nThe Evolution of Netscape Navigator:\n\nBrowser to Internet Suite to Desktop\n\nBy ROBERT E. CALEM\n\nith each beta release of Netscape's new Internet software suite, the company's ambitious vision of online integration becomes clearer and more all encompassing.\n\nWhile the suite, known as Communicator, is far from being ready for prime time, even in these early stages it's clearly much more than just an upgrade of Navigator, the Web browser on which Netscape Communications was built. In addition to Version 4.0 of Navigator, Communicator's components include Messenger, an e-mail program; Collabra, a \"collaborative discussion\" program for participating in Internet newsgroups, and Composer, an HTML editor.\n\nComposer, Communicator's HTML editor.\n\nA bigger \"Professional Edition\" also includes Calendar, software, licensed from Corporate Software & Technologies International Inc., that allows co-ordination of group scheduling using Internet protocols, AutoAdmin, which allows authorized users to set up Communicator for use across local or wide area networks, and IBM's 3270 Host On-Demand software, which allows Communicator to be used with mainframe computers.\n\n\"Preview Release 2,\" as Netscape has named its second beta of the suite, was made available for downloading on Feb. 24, and while the company anticipates delivering the commercial version sometime in April, Mike McCue, Netscape's director of advanced technology, acknowledges that Communicator is far from finished. Between now and the final version, other beta editions will be made available with additional features or changes.\n\nMore important, during the second half of the year, Netscape will release Constellation, a separate application that runs under Communicator and seamlessly intertwines every application in the computer or the network with the Internet. Constellation will be a direct competitor to Microsoft's upcoming Internet Explorer 4.0. But while IE 4.0 is positioned as an upgrade to the Windows 95 and NT operating systems that merges the desktop and browser into a single user interface, Constellation will remain an independent application.\n\nEven without Constellation, Communicator offers many improvements over Navigator 3.01, the current commercial release. Moreover, Preview Release 2 adds a few features not found in the first beta edition, which was released in December. These include:\n\nDynamic HTML A next-generation Hypertext Markup Language that allows Web pages to be interactive by, for example, incorporating files and providing access to full applications like spreadsheets or databases.\n\nExtranet functions Support for new communications protocols enables Communicator's various components to be used to share information stored in a company's protected network by users outside the network structure. It also incorporates the means for system administrators to assign permissions and levels of access.\n\nCross-platform support Preview Release 2 is available in versions for Windows NT, Windows 3.1, Apple Macintosh and several UNIX operating systems, as well as for Windows 95.\n\nPossibly the most interesting new feature for the greatest number of users will be the Dynamic HTML, which offers five new capabilities that change the way Web pages appear and work:\n\nDynamic Style Sheets These allow a Web page, including its fonts and margins, to be tailored to the particular characteristics of the user's own monitor, which are sensed during a system query before the first page is downloaded. All the pages that follow would adhere to the same style sheet.\n\nDynamic Layers Text and images or other objects can be layered one on top of another and hidden on a Web page. Pointing and clicking actions can be used to make layers visible, and users will even be able to move objects on the page the way icons can now be moved on the Windows desktop. When viewed with pre-Communicator browsers, layers would be visible at all times \"in-line,\" or in sequential order.\n\nAbsolute Positioning Web page creators can place text or objects at exact locations on the screen, using individual pixels as place markers.\n\nCanvas (a.k.a. Kiosk) Mode This feature allows contents of a Web page to be viewed truly full-screen -- that is, without any of the browser's menus, toolbars, scrollbars or windows. The availability and appearance of the Web site in kiosk mode would be determined by the Web page designer.\n\nMIME-HTML A new e-mail function, MIME-HTML allows users to drag and drop objects like images or sound files into messages. The e-mail messages are delivered as HTML-based pages.\n\nMessenger, Communicator's e-mail tool, allows users to format and filter e-mail messages.\n\nMany of the other features of Communicator, such as the Messenger component's ability to filter e-mail messages by size or sender and to leave them on the server, are already available in other off-the-shelf applications, like Qualcomm's Eudora. But they are new to Netscape. And Messenger goes them one better by embracing new post-office protocol, or POP, standards that allow users to select which mail they want to download and which they want to leave on the server. This feature will prove a real boon to dial-up users who now often have to download dozens of messages and hefty attachments to get the one piece of e-mail they really want to read.\n\nOne anticipated Communicator feature left out of this beta edition: Dynamic fonts will allow Web page designers to specify type faces that are not on the user's hard drive. The fonts will downloaded on an as-needed basis to the user's machine, then disappear when the cache clears. This feature is expected to be built into the next beta release of Communicator, but Netscape hasn't said when it will be available.\n\nConstellation's release date also remains uncertain, although a few of its features have been disclosed. Its desktop interface, dubbed Home Port, will give access to applications, folders, peripherals and the operating system itself through pop-out menu bars that can be hidden around the screen's edges.\n\nAn \"info-stream\" function will keep \"pagelets,\" or snippets of Web pages, hidden at the bottom edge of the screen. Info-streams would be published by the owners of Web sites or other \"content providers,\" McCue said. He gave as an example Federal Express, which might provide an info-stream that allows users to connect to the shipper's Web site to find a package.\n\nBecause the Home Port data is kept on the server, a \"roaming access\" feature will allow users to access their individualized desktops from any computer anywhere via a network connection or modem.\n\nBut Netscape is gambling that what will make Constellation most competitive with Internet Explorer 4.0 will be \"netcasting\" -- a push technology that allows Web publishers to transmit new content to users' PCs without the users having to ask for it. Examples McCue gave included updating of info-streams, delivery of unscheduled information like notifications of changes at a Web site, and breaking news reports.\n\nNetscasting will compete with a number of other push technologies, including that of the current market leader, PointCast. But with the Netscape system, Web publishers will not have to negotiate special arrangements with push services, as they do now, to transmit their content.\n\nIllustrations: The Netscape Communicator Site\n\nRelated Sites\n\nFollowing are links to the external Web sites mentioned in this article.
