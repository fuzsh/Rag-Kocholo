It provides the foundation that enables today's business enterprises to function and flourish. So whether it is in procurement and production, manufacturing and maintenance, customer care and sales, communications and collaboration, tracking and measurement, or virtually any other business discipline, IT plays a critical role. With something so critical, one would think that the planning, integration, and implementation of IT in organizations would have a strong track record of success. Unfortunately, just the opposite is true. Many business professionals point to the use and deployment of IT as a point of weakness, not a point of strength, in their organizations. The reason for this is often that IT is being driven from a technical perspective, not from a business perspective. This situation exists because many businesspeople see IT as being too complicated, too expensive, too risky, and too changeable. They don't take the time to understand the complex environment surrounding information technology management, and, for the most part, IT's impact on the enterprise remains poorly understood. Most businesspeople use technology on a daily basis and understand how specific technologies affect their ability to do their specific jobs. However, when it comes to the use of information technology to drive business value, many businesspeople do not participate fully in information technology decisions because of the complexities involved in choosing between competing projects, assessing project risk, and managing implementation, and because they often do not have the knowledge needed to understand what the technical teams are talking about. Poorly understood IT initiatives often end in failure. Sometimes the failure shows up when an IT project doesn't generate its promised financial benefits. Other times the technology doesn't work as promised or causes unintended problems within the organization's business processes,\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nculture, or operations. In many cases, the failures are within the technology itself, and the resulting difficulties with its implementation result in projects that miss time and budget commitments. But there is no need for failure to be so pervasive. A thorough knowledge of the key factors surrounding IT decisions can significantly reduce failure rates. But more important, when the managers of a business have a thorough knowledge of all aspects of information technology, they can ensure that there is an alignment of business and IT strategies, objectives, and activities. This book was written to help managers develop that knowledge and to help them understand the processes that allow business professionals to successfully drive the use of information technology in their organizations. The idea for the book originally came when we were designing the foundation information technology class for the MBA curriculum at the University of Colorado at Denver. We wanted to create a class that would adequately prepare any MBA student to enter a world in which information technology plays a central role. We quickly realized that it needed to be focused not only on information technology itself, but also on the impact and implementation of information technology in an enterprise. We also realized that any course about information technology needed to strike a balance between practical experience and academic strength. So we framed the course and the book in the context of 100 questions that are critical for every manager. We then recruited a distinguished group of senior business leaders and faculty to answer those questions in a clear and concise way.\n\nWhat Is Business Driven Information Technology?\n\nWhen we talk about business driven information technology, we are really talking about aligning and managing four interrelated sets of activities within an organization. These activities are related to the strategic, financial, organizational, and technological systems of the firm. They are not separate or distinct, although they typically are treated as such in most books and articles about technology and technology management. For example, it is fairly easy to find books and articles on specific technologies (technological system), project management (organizational system), technology and innovation (strategic system), or technology investment (financial system). In reality, however, every technology project has to deal with all these systems simultaneously because they are closely interrelated. Most managers have expertise in one or two of these systems, but managing technology effectively requires the ability\n\nPreface\n\nFigure 1 Effective Technology Management\n\nto align them and manage across their boundaries rather than solely within them. Literally, effective technology management means being able to manage at the intersection of these four systems, as illustrated in Figure 1. Consider the following scenario: a company discovers that its major competitor is about to \"go live\" with a new supply chain management (SCM) system that will decrease its time from order to delivery by 50 percent while reducing costs; this is likely to result in the loss of several of the firm's major customers to the competitor (strategic system). Managers at the firm astutely realize that they have to close the gap quickly, so they launch a crash program to develop their own supply chain management system with their business partners. A vendor is selected based on a set of design criteria (technological system) and projected financial metrics (financial system) that indicate that the SCM investment will at least break even while protecting market share and margins. A project management team is assembled and charged with leading the required software development effort and implementing the system (organizational system). A few months after the crash program's launch, the project team encounters \"unforeseen\" problems with the interfaces among the participating organizations' enterprise resource systems (technological system), and decides that their business processes have to be modified to fit the new SCM system (organizational system). These changes and the associated delay and escalating costs impact the project's financial metrics, increasing the projected payback period and decreasing the projected return on investment (financial system), which push the project's estimated returns into the\n\nxv\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\nred. Worse yet, projections indicate that the firm will lose one percent of its market share each month that the project is late, as its customers defect to its competitor (strategic system). How did they get into this situation? What could they have done to prevent it? Situations like this are not uncommon. Decisions made at the outset of a project significantly affect a technology project's chances for success. Unless those early decisions take into account the interactions of all four systems, \"unforeseen'' problems are much more likely. And once a project is under way, an understanding of how changes made within one system ripple through to the others is extremely important. The answers to our 100 questions help readers understand the issues associated with all four systems and how they interact. Understanding these issues and interactions increases the chance that the initial project decisions and subsequent actions will reduce the number of \"unforeseen\" problems that doom many projects. This book is divided into major sections that describe these four systems and their interactions. The first section, \"IT and Strategy,\" focuses on the strategic system. It looks at how information technology has changed the competitive environments of many industries and, in turn, the strategic challenges that firms face. The answers to the questions in this section show why businesses need to carefully link technology investments to their corporate strategies through business-driven technology strategies. The answers also explore the strategic options that IT has created for firms, enabling them to deal with an ever-changing competitive landscape. The \"Information Technology\" section focuses on the technological system and examines the underlying IT infrastructure of a firm. Its four parts examine specific issues related to architecture, applications, networks, and security. The answers are not intended to provide a mastery of this broad range of technical topics. Rather, they provide managers with an understanding of how different elements of technology work and fit together. And, by exploring the managerial issues associated with each topic, they provide a solid background that can be used to make informed business decisions. The \"IT and £-business\" section first deals with the intersection of the technology and strategy systems, focusing on how the Internet has created new options for businesses to increase revenues and improve their responsiveness to customers while decreasing costs and extending their reach. Then, the answers review the requirements of making an e-business strategy work, such as the integration of front- and back-end systems, the technical elements that need to be in place, and privacy issues that need to be dealt with effectively. The fourth section, \"IT and Organization,\" looks at the organizational system; the interdependent relationship between information technology and an organization's structure, culture and people, stakeholder relations, and knowledge management. This section then examines the relationship between a firm's IT organization and the rest of the business. The answers show that an IT organization's ability to demonstrate alignment with the firm's strategy is key to its effective operation. Alignment requires\n\nPreface\n\nthe articulation of a business driven technology strategy and measurement systems that demonstrate this alignment. The \"IT and Business Processes\" section focuses on the intersection of the organizational and technological systems. It opens with the perennial question of\"Which is more important-business process or technology?\"; the answers that follow explore this issue and its implications in some detail. The last part of this section examines three major processes and their associated technologies: enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain management (SCM) systems. The potential benefits of these systems are discussed, as are technical and organizational issues related to implementing them successfully. The sixth section, \"IT and Resource Allocation,\" focuses on the financial system, exploring issues related to technology investment. The answers in this section address questions such as how much a firm should invest in technology, how it should spend that money, what the relevant financial metrics are for evaluating projects, how it can choose among competing projects, and how it can determine if the benefits have been achieved. The seventh section, \"IT and Implementation,\" returns the discussion to the organizational system, examining issues related to the traditionally weakest area of IT management-that of project implementation. The section opens with a discussion of the risks inherent in project implementation. Most of the remaining answers then focus on how to manage projects to minimize these risks. They examine the requirements for effective project management and provide a wealth of information about managing the project management process. The final two questions close the circle by talking about what needs to be done when things go wrong. Should you plan for failure, and how do you know when to kill a project? While every manager hopes for success, failures are not uncommon, and knowing when to terminate a failing project saves time and money. The answers to the questions are not meant to be complete treatises on a subject. They cover the basics and are short enough that the reader can absorb them quickly. Each answer contains a set of internal references to other questions, indicated by (Q## ), that serve two purposes. First, they show readers where to find more information about a particular topic or issue within the 100 questions. Second, the internal references identify linkages among the four systems. When all the answers are considered in total, they constitute a strong body of very practical knowledge across a wide spectrum of technology topics. And, as a whole, they provide a comprehensive overview of what it means to \"manage technology effectively.\" The eighth and final section, \"Resources,\" contains references to where further information can be found for each answer. \"Web Resources\" are portals where current information about a topic can be accessed.

This book is the result of a unique collaborative effort between the business community and the Business School at the University of Colorado at Denver, where it became known as the \"100 Questions Project.\" Business executives, IT professionals, and faculty members volunteered to write the answers to the 100 Questions. The contributors and the editors have completed the project in support of the University of Colorado, and the book's royalties are being donated to the Business School. We recruited an editorial team for the project that included three former CIOsBarbara Bauer, Rina Delmonico, and Randy Weldon-two members of the CUDenver Information Systems faculty-Jahangir Karimi and Dawn Gregg-and Sue Beers (TIA, Inc.). The editorial team set the direction for the answers, recruited authors, and reviewed and edited drafts for their content and compatibility with the project's editorial vision. Dawn Gregg also served in the role as the project's resource editor, researching and filling gaps in the resources. Sue Beers, our copy editor, undertook the enormous job of editing the answers into a coherent whole. More than 60 business professionals and faculty members joined the project as authors. This group included more than 25 current or former CIOs, CEOs, COOs, and CTOs representing a broad range of firms, such as AT&T Broadband (now part of Comcast), Ball Corporation, Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company, J.D. Edwards, Johns Manville, MCDATA, Oppenheimer Funds, QSE Technologies, and SAIC, as well as partners from services firms such as Accenture LLP, Deloitte & Touche LLP, EDS, Executive Leadership Group, Fujitsu Consulting, Oracle Corporation, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. As you'll see from the biographical sketches, the contributors draw upon many years of experience with information technology in formulating the answers. Over a ten-month period, they worked with the editorial team, writing and revising each answer. We appreciate the contributors' persistence. Our corporate and consulting contributors, in particular, had no idea what they were getting themselves into when they volunteered to participate in the project. Their diligence in producing their answers and their willingness to donate their royalties to the Business School is greatly appreciated. In addition to the contributors, many other individuals lent their support to the project. Sueann Ambron, the dean of the Business School at the University of Colorado at Denver, was a consistent source of support and originally conceived the idea for this project. Christa Rabenold undertook the onerous task of formatting the answers' resources and endnotes. Ellen Metter, the campus business librarian, provided assistance to several of the contributors in researching their answers. Several member of the business community who do not appear as authors also provided significant support to the project. We owe a special thanks to Daya Haddock\n\nPreface\n\nand Cindy Gibson from TIA, Inc., for providing the resources for copyediting. Sharon Baake, Oracle Corporation, and Mike O'Hair and Joni Goheen, EDS, assisted us in lining up authors at critical points during the project. The board members of the Center for Information Technology Innovation at the University of Colorado at Denver provided extensive support in recruiting authors and developing the list of questions. We also want to thank Bill Hicks, who, while he was at Stanford University Press, recognized the potential of this book and got the process started that resulted in its publication. Finally, we thank our editorial team members for all their efforts. They have been an exceptional group of people with whom to work. We hope that you find this book a valuable resource. You might read entire sections or multiple answers. Or perhaps you will focus on specific answers that pertain to a particular challenge you face. In any case, we believe it will give you a good foundation on the subject, whet your appetite for further exploration, and provide you with the tools to make business driven information technology a reality in your organization.

ZAMMUTO\n\nInformation technology (IT) has had a profound effect on corporate strategy over the past three decades, changing the industry conditions in which businesses operate and the strategic options they can pursue. The \"IT and Strategy\" section in this book focuses on the impact of IT on industries and companies. Questions 1 and 2 explore how IT has changed the \"rules of the game\" in many industries and, in turn, the dynamics of competition within them. Question 3 examines why the impact of some new technologies is more profound than others, \"disrupting\" or creating fundamental changes in some industries while not in others. The conclusion that can be drawn from these answers is that IT has gone from being a tool to create competitive advantage to simply being the price of participation in many industries-something a business has to be good at in order to survive. \"Being good at IT\" literally means using it to leverage a company's strategy regardless of strategic focus. Leveraging a company's strategy through IT means targeting technology investments to enhance specific strategic objectives. For example, if a firm's strategy is to be a low-cost producer, then its technology investments need to enhance its ability to lower costs. If its strategy is to differentiate itself from competitors by creating unique value for customers, its technology investments need to focus on making the firm more responsive to customers' needs and serving them. Thus, key to \"being good at IT\" is the ability to create a business driven technology strategy. Question 4 discusses the steps that a company needs to take to develop a business driven technology strategy that ensures that its IT investments and strategic direction are aligned. Part of the formula in developing a business driven technology strategy is a company's overall technology orientation. Question 5 examines different orientations to technology, their benefits and drawbacks, and some of the conditions under which\n\n2\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nthese different orientations are appropriate. At one end of the continuum is a \"bleeding-edge\" technology orientation, where a business adopts cutting-edge technologies to gain a competitive advantage by differentiating itself from its competitors. At the opposite end is a \"following-edge\" orientation, where technology is not an important factor in determining a business's competitive success. Most companies fall somewhere in between. Understanding a company's technology orientation is an important step in knowing what can and cannot be accomplished within the context of its technology strategy. One of the new strategic options that IT has created for businesses is mass customization. Question 6 explains why mass customization is an appealing strategy. It provides the benefits of what were viewed as mutually exclusive strategies prior to the IT revolution: being a low-cost producer of standardized goods and services for the mass market, or being a differentiator that tailored its goods and services to specific market segments. Mass customization promises the economies of low-cost production coupled with the differentiator's responsiveness to specific customer needs. The answer also explains the difficulties in achieving the benefits of mass customization because it applies only in certain situations where specific market, organizational, and supply chain conditions are met. Firms increasingly find themselves needing to respond rapidly to changing market conditions, time-limited windows of opportunity, regulatory mandates, and specific customer and organizational needs. Question 7, the final answer in this section, focuses on using IT to cope with rapid change through the use of \"throwaway'' or ad hoc systems as part of a company's technology strategy. While there is an appeal to quick responses for pressing needs, the answer shows that throwaway systems must be used cautiously because they can negatively impact the effectiveness of a company's overall technology strategy. The message of this section is that technology has changed industries in ways that make sound strategies imperative. Information technology can play an important role in enhancing those strategies by making their execution faster, more efficient and effective, and more responsive to customer needs and market conditions. But unless a business's technology investments are carefully linked to its strategy, they are unlikely to lead to competitive success.\n\nI-\n\n1. How does information technology impact industries? RAYMOND F. ZAMMUTO\n\nInformation technology as we think of it today- computer-based systems-is a relatively new phenomenon in the history of business. Computer technology found its way into large firms, whose information processing needs had exceeded the capabilities of manual systems, during the 1950s. The introduction of IBM's System/360 in 1964launched computers into the business mainstream, primarily by automating paper-intensive tasks such as transaction processing and record-keeping. The efficiencies generated by automation were compelling and thus began the massive wave of IT investment by business. By the end of 1999, the net stock of IT capital equipment approached $900 billion. 1 Early analysts predicted that computers would revolutionize businesses and industries. However, until the early 1990s, studies of the economic impact ofiT investment on industries revealed that it had not significantly affected industry productivity, raising questions as to whether the IT investments were paying off. 2 At the same time, some studies showed that significant gains were made by individual firms that invested heavily in IT.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nWhile IT investment did not appear to affect the economic productivity of industries until the 1990s, earlier it did have a major impact on specific industries through 1 Kevin J. Stiroh, \"Investing in Information Technology: Productivity Payoffs for U.S. Industries,\" Current Issues in Economics and Finance 7.5 (2001 ): 1. 2 Erik Brynjolfsson and Shinkyu Yang, \"Information Technology and Productivity: A Review of the Literature,\" Advances in Computers 43 (1996): 179-214.\n\n4\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nthe actions of firms adopting IT as a competitive tool. Simply put, IT reshaped industries by changing the \"rules of the game\" as large firms discovered ways to leverage their strategies through its use. 3 Because the required investments were large and applications custom developed, firms making successful investments gained significant leads on their competitors through their accumulated IT experience and knowledge. In many cases, IT expertise itself became a source of competitive advantage. Consider the case of the airline industry. American Airlines was the first airline to invest heavily in IT. Joined by IBM in a five- year development effort during the 19 50s, American Airlines developed the first computerized customer reservation system, which eventually became the SABRE system. The original intent was to develop an inventory management system to reduce clerical costs. However, American Airlines discovered that information captured by the system was invaluable in managing passenger service levels and aircraft capacity, and for coordinating baggage handling, food, and fuel requirements. As American Airlines continued to experiment, it found new competitive uses of its IT, such as extending its reach into travel agents' offices in the 1970s, using the information to develop sophisticated pricing models after industry deregulation in 1978, and extending its expertise into new businesses such as IT consulting during the 1980s. The SABRE system itself became a significant source of revenues for AMR, American Airlines' parent corporation. 4 American Airlines' successful IT investments changed the rules of competition in the airline industry. It forced other firms to respond to its strategy by developing their own IT capabilities, as did United Airlines with its Apollo reservation system, or by ceding industry leadership to the firms that could do so. The two firms that made the most successful IT investments, American Airlines and United Airlines, have held and traded the number 1 and 2 positions within the industry ever since. Similar stories are readily found in other industries. For example, Wal-Mart, which began investing heavily in a computerized logistics system during the 1970s, changed the retailing industry, as did Federal Express's (now known as FedEx) pioneering use ofiT to increase reliability and customer service in the express transportation industry. Thus, while IT investment didn't show a discernable effect on industry-level productivity until the 1990s, it reshaped many industries by redefining what it meant to be competitive.\n\nINCREASING PRODUCTIVITY AND COMPETITION\n\nThe effect ofiT on industries began to change in the late 1980s. Studies conducted in the early and mid-1990s revealed that IT investment was beginning to have a 3 See, for example: F. Warren McFarland, \"Information Technology Changes the Way You Compete,\" Harvard Business Review 62.3 (1984): 161-66. 4 D. G. Copeland and J. L. McKenney, \"Airline Reservation Systems: Lessons from History,\" MIS Quarterly 12.3 (1988): 353-70; James L. McKenney, Waves of Change: Business Evolution through Information Technology (Boston: HBSP, 1995) 98-140.\n\n1-How does information technology impact industries?\n\nsignificant impact on the productivity of industries making heavy IT investments, not just selected firms within them. By the late 1990s there was no longer a question whether IT investments were paying off. For example, one study showed that industries experiencing the largest productivity gains in the late 1990s were those that were the most intensive IT users. 5 While there is no definitive evidence as to why productivity increases began to be observed at this time, there appear to be two major contributing factors: (1) advances in computer technology, and (2) the use ofiT to integrate business operations. 1. Advances in Computer Technology Continued development in computer technology made increasing computing power available at decreasing prices, reducing the cost barrier to IT investment. For example, a 1960s mainframe computer cost millions of dollars, had limited capabilities, and typically required the development of custom applications. In the case of American Airlines, it took 20 years of advances in computer technology and millions spent on software development before its original concept of a customer reservation system could be fully implemented. However, by 1990, the same computing power that cost millions in the 1960s could be purchased for a few thousand dollars, and many general off-the-shelf business applications could be purchased from vendors. By the late 1980s it became possible to do more with IT for a much smaller investment, making it possible for smaller firms within an industry to enable their strategies through the use of IT. 2. The Use of IT to Integrate Business Operations The second factor is related to changes in how organizations use IT. Prior to the late 1980s, IT investment tended to create \"islands of automation\" where money was invested in departmental systems with little or no communication across them. These investments largely automated existing processes. In the late 1980s, organizations discovered that they could substantially improve the efficiency, speed, and flexibility of their operations by redesigning them along process lines, where both people and IT communicated across departmental boundaries, streamlining work flows and increasing employee productivity (Qss). By the mid-1990s, integrating operations across departments instead of automating within them had become an important theme in IT investment. With the introduction and widespread adoption of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (Q62), many organizations increased productivity and the speed and flexibility of their operations through a combination of restructuring and IT. However, as more firms entered the world ofiT -enabled operations, the ability to use IT as a source of sustainable competitive advantage decreased. In many industries, IT expertise in itself was no longer a source of competitive advantage because 5 Stiroh, \"Investing\" 1-6. Kevin J. Stiroh, \"Information Technology and the U.S. Productivity Revival: What Do the Industry Data Say?\" Federal Reserve Bank of New York Web Site, Staff Report 115,24 Jan. 2001, 11 Dec. 2002 .\n\n5\n\nr-\n\n6\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nIT -based innovations could more easily be imitated. Consider the case of the express transportation industry, which FedEx pioneered through its use of information technology. Today FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) are in a tight competitive battle for industry leadership. Why? In large part because UPS spent about $1 billion per year through the 1990s to develop IT capabilities similar to FedEx's.6 As more firms in an industry use IT to streamline their operations, the level of competition intensifies (Q2). Investment in other types of applications during the late 1990s, such as supply chain management (Q67) and customer relationship management systems (Q6S), coupled with the ability of the Internet to reduce the costs of communicating with customers, suppliers, and employees (Q26) have further enhanced the productivity effects of information technology on industries by reducing costs, increasing revenues, and increasing the speed of operations. Combined, these integrative systems have created new strategic options, such as the ability to closely tailor goods and services to specific consumer needs (mass customization, [Q6]), to know and target customers better (Q6S), and to develop new channels of distribution (Q3S).\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIT reshaped many industries during the 1970s and 1980s by changing the \"rules of the game.\" Once a firm successfully pioneered new strategic approaches to the use of information, other firms within its industry were forced to find a defensible niche, pioneer their own innovations, or follow the lead of the early mover. Large IT investments and experimentation allowed many early adopters to gain sustainable competitive advantages. However, during the 1990s, IT's impact on industries began to change. As the relative cost ofiT decreased and more firms adopted vendor-provided applications, particularly those integrating operations, it became more difficult to gain a sustainable competitive advantage through IT investments. As Max Hopper, an American Airlines executive instrumental in the development of the SABRE system, wrote in 1990, \"In this new era, information technology will be once more pervasive and less potent-table stakes for competition, but not a trump card for competitive success.\" 7 He was right. IT has simply become part of the price of participation.\n\nO'Reilly, \"They've Got Mail!\" Fortune 7 Feb. 2000: 104. D.

How has information technology changed the dynamics of competition within industries? CHERI LINDEN\n\nInformation technology (IT) has changed the competitive dynamics of many industries by increasing the ease of manipulating information and moving it within organizations, as well as between them and their customers and suppliers. Michael Porter's research on IT and the Internet's impact on industry structure shows how his classic \"five forces,\" which influence the level of competition within industries, change as a result of increased and less expensive flows of information. 1 These \"five forces\" are: (1) barriers to entry, (2) substitution threats, (3) the bargaining power of customers and (4) of suppliers, and (5) the intensity of rivalry. The overall impact, Porter concludes, is increased competition and a reduction in the extent to which firms can establish a sustainable advantage through operational efficiencies. INCREASING THE INTENSITY OF RIVALRY\n\nIT coupled with organizational restructuring has increased the efficiency of many businesses by reducing costs (Ql), often through vendor-provided ERP systems, ( Q62). Early adopters of these systems gained short-term competitive advantages by becoming more efficient than their rivals. More efficient companies could lower prices while maintaining margins, squeezing the profitability of competitors if they attempted to compete on price. However, the widespread adoption of ERP systems meant that other, usually large, companies within their industries experienced similar gains. This widespread adoption of ERP and other systems also increased the pace and intensity of industry competition as the flow of information within companies became more transparent. Markets could be monitored more closely and decisions made more quickly using decision support systems (Q19) and knowledge management practices (Q51). New products and services could be brought to market faster using IT-enabled development methods and flexible production and distribution technologies. Real-time information about sales improved sales forecasting, which, in turn, decreased procurement and logistics costs. Businesses slow to develop these capabilities were at a significant competitive disadvantage in that they could not maintain their margins in the face of decreasing prices, nor could they move as quickly as their competitors to respond to emerging threats or opportunities. 1 Michael\n\nPorter, \"Strategy and the Internet,\" Harvard Business Review 79.3 (2001): 67.\n\n7\n\n2-\n\n8\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nRESTRUCTURING SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS\n\nSupply chain management (SCM) (Q67) technologies and the Internet have had a mixed effect on the relative bargaining power between companies and their suppliers. Early electronic data interchange (EDI) supply chain technologies were proprietary networks that increased the interdependence of businesses and their suppliers. Companies tied together in a supply chain network shared a common fate as changes in demand quickly rippled through a supply chain because it was relatively difficult for member firms to switch partners. Later, Internet-based supply technologies (e.g., auctions and reverse auctions, vertical exchanges [Q36, Q37]} shifted the locus of bargaining power, depending on whether it was buyers or sellers consolidating volume. When purchasing was consolidated across companies, they gained bargaining power over suppliers, reducing their costs. In contrast, suppliers' pricing power increased when they consolidated their sales to businesses using the Internet, enabling them to maintain or raise prices. The Internet also can increase the power of suppliers by providing a channel to bypass traditional business partners and reach customers directly. As supply chain technologies continue to develop, particularly with the advent ofWeb services (QlS ), the impact on the bargaining power of suppliers is likely to shift again as the costs of and technical barriers (Q68) to participating in supply chains decrease, reducing switching costs for both suppliers and businesses.\n\nINCREASING NEW ENTRANT AND SUBSTITUTION THREATS\n\nThe Internet reduces geographic barriers to market entry and reduces the need to build proprietary distribution channels. Increased numbers of competitors, coupled with consumers' increased ability to search for alternatives, heightens the intensity of rivalry within an industry and exerts downward pressures on pricing. In the banking industry, for example, the Internet has reduced geographic barriers to new entrants (i.e., other banks), as well as accelerated the blurring of the boundaries between the banking industry and the larger financial services industry. Besides extending the reach of banks not physically located in a geographic area, the Internet has exposed banks to increased competition with other types of financial service businesses (e.g., credit card companies, consumer finance firms, and mutual funds companies) for a share of consumer wealth. 2 As a result, consumers now have access to an enormous amount of information from a much broader range of financial service firms, allow2 See, for example: Lloyd Darlington, \"Banking without Boundaries,\" Blueprint to the Digital Economy, eds. Don Tapscott, Alex Lowry, and David Ticoll (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1998)\n\n113-38.\n\n2 -How has information technology changed the dynamics of competition within industries?\n\ning them to shop for the services and prices that best fit their needs. The impact has been to increase the overall level of competition, which pressures businesses' margins.\n\nINCREASING CoNSUMER BARGAINING POWER\n\nThe Internet heightens the competitive impact of IT in many industries by increasing consumers' ability to access and search information, making it more transparent while decreasing its cost. Porter notes that the Internet has increased the power of buyers by enhancing their ability to compare products, service offerings, and prices across a greater range of providers. This increased transparency of information reduces switching costs by increasing consumers' ability to find and change providers of goods and services. In turn, consumer bargaining power increases, which exerts downward pressures on prices. Consider the impact the Internet has had on the airline industry's marketing, pricing, and ticketing practices. With the advent of the Internet, new entrants (e.g., priceline.com, expedia.com, and travelocity.com) were launched to independently provide airline travel information providing customers real-time comparative pricing. Airlines first responded by creating company-sponsored Web sites to provide similar capabilities. Then a consortium of airlines created Orbitz.com as a jointventure to compete against travel agents and the independent travel search engines for ticket sales. Orbitz was successful in reducing airline costs by diverting traffic from travel agents and the independent Web sites, reducing commissions paid (Q36). But it also had the unintended effect of reducing airline revenues because consumers had more fare alternatives presented to them in more usable ways. This has further commoditized air travel and increased competition by allowing people to choose easily among alternatives based on price. 3 The overall impact of IT has been to increase the pace and intensity of competition in many industries, which tends to lower prices. However, the impact of technology on individual companies within an industry depends to a large extent on a company's ability to use it. For example, while technology has blurred the banking industry's traditional boundaries, thereby increasing the number of competitors that banks face, it has also increased their ability to reduce transaction costs, tailor services to their customers, and deliver services through new channels. Conducting transactions via the Internet significantly reduces costs for banks. A recent study shows that an Internet transaction costs a bank a penny compared to $.27 for an ATM transaction and $1.07 for a teller transaction. 4 The Internet also creates new distribution 3 Saul Hansell, \"Fare Idea Returns to Haunt Airlines,\" New York Times on the Web 27 Oct. 2002, 11 Dec. 2002 . 4 Stephanie Miles, \"What's a Check?\" Wall Street Journal Online 21 Oct. 2002, 11 Dec. 2002 .\n\n9\n\n2-\n\n10\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nchannels that enable banks to serve their customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, regardless of where that customer is located. Tools such as data mining (Q21) provide banks with the ability to more finely segment their markets, identify their most profitable customers, and tailor services to meet their specific needs.\n\nCoNCLUSION\n\nDeveloping and pursuing a sound strategy is becoming increasingly critical as technology accelerates the pace and intensity of competition within industries. Strategies yield sustainable competitive advantage when they result in unique value for customers.5 If a business can create unique value for customers through either the goods or services it produces or through how it delivers them, it is more likely to be able to maintain its margins in industries where the overall impact of technology has been to reduce prices. How a company uses IT can be an important factor in this equation. IT can leverage a company's strategy by reducing costs, increasing the speed of operations, better tailoring its offerings, and so on. But unless the use ofiT is closely linked to a business's strategic objectives, it will result in wasted investments and a worsening competitive position, which is why a business driven technology strategy (Q4) is the best protection against wasted technology investments.\n\n3. Why do some technological innovations create disruptive changes for industries while others do not? RAYMOND F. ZAMMUTO AND JEFFREY R. NYSTROM\n\nThe term \"disruptive technology\" was popularized by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen in his 1997 book, The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Companies to Fail. Disruptive technologies create something new-whether they are new products, new services, or new ways of doing thingswhich usurp existing products, services or business models. Christensen's book has been very influential and is often cited as one of the intellectual justifications that fueled the Internet boom during the late 1990s. 5 Michael\n\nPorter, \"What Is Strategy?\" Harvard Business Review 74.6 (1996): 61-78.\n\n3 -Why do some technological innovations create disruptive changes while others do not?\n\nTHE DYNAMICS OF DISRUPTION\n\nWhen introduced, a new technology's goods and services typically do not attract much attention from an industry's incumbents or their mainstream customers. This is because they tend to be inferior to what is already available in terms of their overall performance, or the features they offer, compared to the established or \"sustaining\" technology's goods and services. Consider the personal computer during the late 1970s. Existing computer manufacturers, such as IBM, DEC, and Wang, and their customers, wrote it off as a toy, something of interest only to hobbyists, offered by unknown companies without established brands. However, new technologies often contain the seed of a new value proposition within them in that their goods and services are often cheaper, simpler, smaller, and more convenient to use. The process by which a new technology's goods and services become disruptive is based on the premise that the rate of technological advance generally outpaces customers' abilities to use performance improvements. As incumbents improve the performance of their goods and services, they move upmarket to higher margin segments of the industry. In turn, this creates a vacuum in the market's less profitable segments. At the same time, performance improvements by innovating firms using the new technology enable them to better satisfy consumer needs and fill the vacuum at the market's low end. As the sustaining technology continues to improve, the incumbents' goods and services eventually overshoot their customers' needs for increased performance. Continuing improvements in the new technology, however, enable the innovators' goods and services to meet these customers' needs. As a result, the innovating firms move upmarket, eventually eroding demand for the incumbents' goods and services. When this happens, the new technology becomes disruptive and the industry's incumbents are unseated by the innovating firms. This was exactly what happened to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), which was the innovator that developed and commercialized the minicomputer. DEC initially did not view the PC as a competitive threat but, with rapid improvements in performance, PCs were able to perform many of the functions of minicomputers. By the time DEC recognized the threat it was too late to respond and the company was acquired by a leading PC manufacturer, Compaq. Why don't the established firms simply adopt the new technology? Christensen argues that leading firms fail to capitalize on new technologies for four reasons that are generally considered good management practice: 1. Leading firms listen carefully to their best customers who do not want the new technology because the new products are initially inferior to current products. 2. Leading firms carefully study market opportunities by measuring size and growth rates, but the markets created by new technologies are impossible to measure and difficult to predict.\n\n11\n\n3-\n\n12\n\nIT and Strategy\n\n3. Industry's leaders are large firms that pursue large markets. The embryonic markets for new technologies generally are not attractive because of their small size, which does not offer much opportunity for meaningful growth. 4. Corporate investment decisions focus on earning the best possible returns, while new technologies often result in less expensive products with lower margins.\n\nAs a result, it does not appear rational to pursue a new technology when a firm's sustaining technology offers better opportunities, at least in the short-run. By the time it is obvious that a firm's existing business has been undermined, it is usually too late to enter the market and regain industry leadership.\n\nWHAT MAKES A NEW TECHNOLOGY DISRUPTIVE?\n\nA key factor in whether a new technology becomes disruptive is the ability of innovating firms to establish a \"value network\" to support it. A value network is the constellation of firms-manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, other firms making complementary products, and so on-that create a market for the new technology's goods and services. The personal computer industry's value network included chipmakers, software firms, computer manufacturers, and retailers. During the early 1980s, a series of independent but mutually reinforcing actions by its members created a market for the personal computer. The introduction of the IBM PC provided a design standard leading to the rapid entry of clone manufacturers, whose lower prices increased demand. Microprocessor advances improved performance, and the development of applications software, such as spreadsheets and word processing programs, increased the range of practical applications for PCs. The result was that the PC market took off in the mid-1980s and, as noted earlier, PC manufacturers moved upmarket, taking away business from mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers whose late attempts to enter the PC market were generally unsuccessful. However, establishing a value network around a new technology is not easy and many potentially disruptive technologies wither from a lack of a supporting infrastructure. The 2001-2002 implosion of the broadband industry is a case in point. Primary assumptions underlying the massive investments in broadband networks were that there would be rapid development of, and increasing demand for, bandwidthhungry applications. The fact that many of the envisioned applications and demand for them never materialized has led to massive disruption in the industry. Even when a value network can be established, creating a market for a new technology's products can be difficult, particularly if the rate of technological churn in an industry is high. Consider the case of wireless communications technology for personal communications and computing devices. One of the first technologies on the market was Bluetooth, a point-to-point wireless technology developed by Ericsson in 1995. Bluetooth was promoted as a disruptive technology that promised to provide a\n\n3 -Why do some technological innovations create disruptive changes while others do not?\n\ncheap and simple way to connect all types of electronic devices-phones, laptops, personal digital assistants, televisions, headsets, printers, camcorders. Realizing the key to establishing a market for the technology was the development of interoperability standards, Ericsson organized the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) 1 with several major companies, including 3Com, IBM, Intel, Lucent Technologies, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, and Toshiba, and invited virtually any firm interested in developing Bluetooth standards and applications to become \"associate\" members. By the end of2001, the SIG totaled over 2,000 members. Even though the value network had been established, the technology was still not successful. Bluetooth's 1998 launch was marred by interoperability problems that were not fixed until a later release in 2001. At the same time, WiFi (IEEE 802.111 wireless LAN) was rapidly gaining attention, with many industry observers predicting Bluetooth's demise. To complicate matters further, another disruptive contender known as ultrawideband wireless technology is awaiting U.S. Federal Communications Commission approval, and its proponents are sounding the death knell for both Bluetooth and WiFi. While wireless communications will eventually have a major and potentially disruptive impact on many industries, it is not likely to occur until a dominant design or technology standard emerges (Q28, Q29 ).\n\nHow\n\nDo You RECOGNIZE DISRUPTIVE CHANGES?\n\nObviously, identifying disruptive technologies with the 20/20 vision of hindsight is an easy proposition, but how do you do it in real-time for industries with significant technological churn? Andrew Grove, Intel's former chairman, offers some solid advice when he talks about strategic inflection points. A strategic inflection point is the point at which the old way of doing business in an industry disappears and a new one emerges. Disruptive technologies create strategic inflection points in industries, whether it be through the introduction of new products (the PC), new services (Internet-based discount brokerages), or new business models (Dell's \"direct model\"). Three of Grove's suggestions for recognizing disruptive changes are: 2 1. Apply the \"silver-bullet test.\" If you had one figurative bullet, for whom among\n\nyour competitors would you save it? If the answer was clear in the past and not clear now, start looking around for a disruptive change. 2. Pay attention to warnings from people on the front line of your organization\n\nwho are most likely to feel most vulnerable to changes in the market. Most often these people are middle managers and in your sales organization. If you hear Bluetooth SIG, Inc. Member Web Site . Grove offers a number of additional suggestions in his book: AndrewS. Grove, Only the Paranoid Survive (New York: Currency Doubleday, 1996). 1\n\n2\n\n13\n\n3-\n\n14\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nrecurring themes in their warnings, it is time to pay serious attention and start looking around for a potential disruption. 3. Engage your customers and business partners in discussions about the direction your industry is taking. Disruptive changes can be more visible to people outside your organization than to those within.\n\nTechnology can indeed create disruptive change. The more you are aware of its potential and watch for it, the more likely you will be able to benefit from the change rather than be destroyed by it.\n\n4. What is a business driven technology strategy? RANDY WELDON\n\nAs competition within industries increases, the need for effective corporate strategies has become more important (Ql, Q2). Technology can play an important role in leveraging a firm's strategy by reducing costs, increasing the speed of operations, and enabling a firm to be more responsive to its customers. Unfortunately, many business people have been heard saying things such as, \"We don't understand how this project fits into the overall direction of our business. Are we spending our limited funds on the right projects?\" Or, \"This is an IT (information technology) project. The IT department decides which technologies to implement without our input.\" The above scenarios occur when technology strategy is driven by the IT department instead of being driven by the business. A few symptoms of this problem include: • IT independently creates the technology strategy for the company and employees in other departments don't relate to it because they did not participate in creating it. • IT, not the business, owns the projects and priorities. • IT successes are described in IT terms rather than by the impact made on the business. • Business (and often IT) people cannot articulate the technology strategy for the company, what projects are planned for the next few years, or how those projects help the business achieve its strategies.\n\nHow can we reverse this undesirable situation and create business driven technology strategies? Some companies, believing that technology is an important ele-\n\n4-What is a business driven technology strategy?\n\nment of their strategy, hire a Chief Technical Officer (CTO) whose job is to develop that strategy. 1 However, despite the lofty title and job description, just designating someone to develop the plan rarely gets it done.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS OF A BuSINESS DRIVEN TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY\n\nA technology strategy refers to how a company plans to use information technology to help achieve its strategic objectives. A successful technology strategy: • starts with an understanding of the current systems architecture, quality of technical staff, vintage and effectiveness of existing systems, and current systems priorities, • identifies the company's strategic objectives for the near future, • describes a vision for how those objectives can be enabled through information technology, • outlines the policies and high-level tactical plans for achieving that vision.\n\nPerforming the tasks described below will help build a solid business driven technology strategy.\n\nPROCESS TO ACHIEVE THE CHARACTERISTICS\n\nCreating a business driven technology strategy requires IT members of the strategy development team to perform several tasks, including: 1. learning more about the business,\n\n2. obtaining bottom-up input, 3. determining top-down direction, 4. creating a strategic technology vision and a plan to achieve it, 5. drafting a tactical implementation plan.\n\nLearning the Business To be credible with other departments, the IT team must learn and document relationships between the key business stakeholders, cross-functional processes, and process cycles in the company. 1 The CTO can report to either the CIO (Chieflnformation Officer) or to another senior executive. In some companies, the top technology officer is called the CTO rather than the CIO, and there is only one individual fulfilling both functions.\n\n15\n\n4-\n\n16\n\nIT and Strategy\n\n• In addition to the project sponsor, key stakeholders might include: -customers -suppliers -employees - government agencies -investors • Depending on the industry, cross-functional process groupings might include: -Customer-oriented processes (sometimes called CRM, or customer relationship management, activities such as sales and service [Q6S]) -Supplier-oriented processes (possibly including sourcing, procurement, contracting [Q67])\n\n- Enterprise resource planning processes (including sales and operations planning, order entry, and order fulfillment [Q62]) • Process cycles refer to how the key subprocesses relate to each other in terms of sequence of information and transactional flow.\n\nObtaining Bottom- Up Input To gain an understanding of the business, IT members of the team should invite participation from department managers and subject matter experts in interviews, workshops, and other steps in the planning process. In addition, the business and IT people should discuss and document: • business and technology trends in the industry, • current or anticipated competitive threats and opportunities, • ideas for using technology to serve customers better, create new markets, or improve processes.\n\nBased on the output from this planning process, the joint business and IT group should identify, prioritize and document needs and opportunities for the coming years. This is not easy to accomplish since most organizations will want to assume unlimited funding for future systems projects. That is why guidance must come through the process described next. Determining Top-Down Direction Senior IT management should also meet with business executives to obtain high-level strategic planning goals and directions for the business. One objective for these sessions is to put boundaries around what otherwise could be an infinite number of directions for the technology strategy. Some sense of the willingness to invest in technology and the returns expected should also be ob-\n\n4-What is a business driven technology strategy?\n\ntained. Additional research insights may be gained from external groups such as Gartner Group, Forrester, or others.\n\nCreating a Strategic Technology Vision Armed with this top-down direction as well as the bottom-up input from the workshops, IT management can draft a business driven technology vision for the company and a plan to achieve that vision. The plan should have two main sections, a strategic plan (including the vision) and a tactical implementation plan. The strategic section should demonstrate the business understanding gained in the earlier steps of the process including: • An overview of the major business strategies and trends. Examples include: -lowest cost manufacturer - expansion into additional geographic areas - growth through mergers and acquisitions • A Porter 5-Forces Matrix describing key business and technology forces (see simplified example in Figure 4.1). 2 • A traditional SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) diagram. Many entries will have technology implications (see simplified example in Figure 4.2). At this point, it is essential that senior management be brought into the process. Some highly centralized companies have installed a technology review committee, whose job is to decide on technology priorities of the company. This group is often led by the CEO or COO. Other more decentralized companies allow these decisions to be made in individual business units. In either case, functional heads (marketing, operations, engineering, etc.) or heads of business units are usually members of the group. The buy-in of this group to the proposed vision will ensure that it is linked to the overall business strategy. Without such buy-in, the CIO or CTO must communicate the vision individually to key executives, leaving much room for misunderstanding between key business leaders.\n\nTactical Implementation Plan The next step is to translate the strategic business drivers into a tactical list of technology and business process initiatives required to achieve the business objectives and the technology vision. An example initiative might be \"Tie us closer to our customers by implementing a new customer relationship management system, including sales force automation, automated contracts and pricing, private portal/exchange, with an integrated call center.\" A key part of the implementation plan is the resolution of conflicting technology 2 Michael Porter, Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors (New York: Free Press, 1980).\n\n17\n\n4-\n\nFigure 4. 1 Sample Porter 5 -Forces Matrix\n\nBarriers to Entry\n\n+ High capital requirements + Strong manufacturing expertise required\n\n+ Overcapacity in industry Supplier Bargaining Power\n\n+ Many potential sources of quality materials - We are small percentage of their sales\n\nDegree of Rivalry\n\nCustomer Bargaining Power\n\n- Many strong competitors - Strong price competition\n\n+ Unique, custom value-add systems\n\n- Many possible sources of products - Few large customers\n\n+ Long-term contracts Threat of Substitution\n\n- Commodity products easily substituted\n\n+ Specialty products patented, harder to copy ( +) indicates a positive factor or force, while (-) indicates a negative force.\n\nFigure 4.2 Sample SWOT Analysis\n\nStrengths\n\n+ Reputation for quality + Manufacturing expertise + Superior, custom systems differentiators Opportunities\n\n+ Acquire small competitors in markets where we lack presence\n\n+ License new products in short-run while building pipeline\n\nWeaknesses\n\n- Lack critical mass of factories over which to spread overhead costs - Limited pipeline of new products coming Threats\n\n- Competitors buy small competitors before we do - Price war happens before we can build critical mass\n\n( +) indicates a positive factor, while (-) indicates a negative factor.\n\n4-What is a business driven technology strategy?\n\n19\n\nTable 4.1 Business Strategies, Technology Initiatives, and Tactical Plans Business Strategies and Objectives\n\nTechnology Initiatives\n\nTactical Plans\n\nGeographic expansion and growth through acquisitions\n\nMigrate to common ERP system (Q62) Develop rapid rollout team and process for new acquisitions; implement EAI integration middleware\n\nStarting now EAI in six months ERP in two years\n\n(Q13)\n\nQuality and manufacturing expertise\n\nPublish standard operating procedures (SOPs) and best practices into content management system (CMS) (Q52) Make available to appropriate employees via intranet (Employee Portal) (Q42)\n\nStarting now CMS in six months Portal in six months\n\nDifferentiate by understanding customers and being the easiest to do business with\n\nRetain customer knowledge via CRM system (Q65) Share business information via private trading exchange (Customer Portal) (Q37)\n\nStarting in one year CRM in phases over one and one-half years Exchange in six months\n\nproject priorities. To have a believable implementation plan, a short list (less than ten) of key initiatives must be prioritized, scheduled over the next few years (balancing limited people and financial resources), and supported by the necessary infrastructure, organization, and management processes. The best solution is to bring the short list of achievable projects to the technology review committee described above and allow them to approve the final decision. Not only does this further ensure the linkage of the final efforts to overall corporate strategies, but it usually results in at least one executive clearly being designated the sponsor for each project (Q93). Based on the business drivers just described, major technology implications and related initiatives can be discerned, as shown in Table 4.1. Then a series of graphics depicting the primary business stakeholders, processes, and cycles can be used to build a picture of how technology supports the business today, as well as a vision of how the picture could change in the future with new technology, greater integration and standardization, and other changes. Table 4.2 shows a simplified before-and-after picture for a manufacturing company. Even at this early stage, management will want to understand the preliminary business case for each of the major initiatives. The IT planning team must work with\n\n4-\n\n20\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nTable 4.2 Current Business Situation vs. Future Technology-Enabled Vision Process Cycles\n\nCurrent Situation\n\nFuture Vision\n\nPurchasing\n\nThree legacy purchasing systems across three divisions Distributed buying at 50 plant locations Not integrated with financial or manufacturing systems\n\nOne purchasing system within common integrated ERP system Consolidated buying across divisions and plants for like items Reduced costs using an eProcurement system\n\nManufacturing\n\nThree legacy manufacturing systems across three divisions Difficulty sharing best practices verbally based on personal relationships, especially with many new plants acquired\n\nAdd newly acquired plants easily Migrate to best practices available through Intranet Integrate some new companies quickly using EAI software (Q13) without forcing costly migration to standard ERP system\n\nSales\n\nCustomer information kept in sales rep's personal files Sales orders taken over phone, fax, and EDI Account status given over phone\n\nCustomer information shared among all authorized personnel via CRM system Reduced sales order and account status costs by using the Internet\n\nLogistics\n\nLoad tendering by calling multiple vendors over phone and fax Shipping status researched with multiple phone calls\n\nLoad tendering automated in transportation management system using the Internet Shipping status available to all over the Internet\n\nthe business managers to understand potential payback mechanisms including revenue enhancements, cost reductions, and process improvements. Then the team must develop time-phased approximations of expenses, capital expenditures, depreciation, lease payments, licenses, maintenance, consulting costs, internal personnel costs, and tax ramifications using net present value (NPV) or other return on investment (ROI) calculations (Q74, Q72). Tradeoffs between internal options and outsourcing options may also be involved (Q81, Q82).\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGERS\n\nBusiness and IT managers should ensure that a technology strategy reflects business, technology, and the intersection between them. This will eliminate the risk that\n\n5-Should a company be on the bleeding-, leading-, or following-edge of technology?\n\nthe technology strategy will not be sufficiently linked to the business. This also ensures business buy-in for the plan, and increases the likelihood that the IT organization will be successful.\n\n5. Should a company be on the bleeding-, leading-, or following-edge of technology? MARK ENDRY\n\nThe decision on how aggressive to be with technology is difficult to make for some companies and natural for others. To arrive at the answer, one needs to understand how company strategy is supported by each option. Accurate analysis of the factors, followed by effective execution, can provide a competitive advantage for a company.\n\nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES?\n\nFor this discussion, there are four basic types of technologies: I. following-edge technology 2. mainstream technology\n\n3. leading-edge technology 4. bleeding-edge technology\n\nThese topics are discussed in more detail on this and the following page.\n\nFollowing-Edge Technology Following-edge technology works best for companies that require a stable, low-cost alternative. It is often used by firms in industries that do not depend heavily on technology or do not traditionally use technology as a differentiator. These technologies are proven and have been in production for some time, so service levels are more predictable. Changes are less frequent and new problems are less likely to surface. The lower cost of ownership for following-edge technologies may provide a competitive advantage.\n\n21\n\ns-\n\n22\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nMainstream Technology Mainstream technology is widely selected because it provides a stable solution with strong vendor support. Skilled resources are generally available to support the technology and training is easy to obtain to expand the support base. Mainstream technology regularly supports the standards that are in widespread use, facilitating the exchange of information between companies. Warranty support and maintenance contracts provide a regular flow of technology upgrades and patches, helping keep service levels stable. Leading-Edge Technology Leading-edge technology balances a reasonably predictable operating environment with solutions that can provide a competitive advantage. Companies employing leading-edge technology can take advantage of the price and performance gains available from the latest innovations in hardware and software. Leading-edge technology requires that a company be prepared for more frequent changes and those changes can increase costs. Companies should be prepared for a regular cycle of updates and patches that require testing and implementation, but the predictable cycle of releases provides time for planning and scheduling to minimize service interruptions. Bleeding-Edge Technology Bleeding-edge technology can be deployed to help a company stand out from its competitors. Early providers of e-procurement and online brokerage services demonstrated that bleeding-edge technology can create market opportunities that help first movers gain significant market share. Companies who aggressively use bleeding-edge technology tend to view technology as a differentiator. Companies using bleeding-edge technologies have to be prepared for some projects to fail, as the technologies do not always succeed. Companies should be prepared for frequent technology updates, some that may be needed immediately to keep production systems in operation. Support from vendors is typically minimal, given their own unfamiliarity with the new technology. What Factors Should Be Considered? A company should analyze several internal and external factors while making technology decisions. Careful alignment of the internal and external factors can differentiate a company from competitors. Internal Factors The internal factors to consider include company strategies such as: • tolerance for risk, • technology spending, • service level requirements, • vendor relationships. A company's ability to attract and retain technology employees and/or the company's strategy to contract for or outsource technology work are also factors.\n\n5-Should a company be on the bleeding-, leading-, or following-edge of technology?\n\n23\n\nTable 5.1 Comparison of Bleeding-, Leading-, and Following-Edge Technology Factors Factor\n\nBleeding\n\nLeading\n\nMainstream\n\nFollowing\n\nRisk Tolerance\n\nHigh\n\nMedium\n\nLow\n\nMedium\n\nTechnology Spending\n\nHigh\n\nMedium\n\nMedium-Low\n\nLow\n\nService Interruption Tolerance\n\nHigh\n\nMedium\n\nLow\n\nMedium\n\nDesire for Differentiation\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nLow\n\nLow\n\nImpact on Sourcing Strategy\n\nHigh\n\nMedium\n\nLow\n\nMedium\n\nBasis of Industry Differentiation\n\nTechnology\n\nTechnology\n\nCost\n\nCost\n\nRate of Industry Change\n\nRapid\n\nRapid\n\nStable\n\nStable\n\nIndustry Dependency on Technology\n\nHigh\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nLow\n\nExternal Factors\n\nExternal factors to consider include:\n\n• the basis for differentiation in the industry or sector addressed by the company, the rate of industry change, the industry dependence on technology, • specific vendor support that might be available for the industry.\n\nHow Do\n\nTHESE FACTORS MAP TO EAcH OPTION?\n\nTable 5.1 attempts to rate each factor against a particular technology approach. This generic table generalizes the rating of each factor to illustrate the considerations a company should make.\n\nDoES BLEEDING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY ALWAYS\n\nCosT MoRE?\n\nBleeding-edge technology can be cost effective. Depending on the technology, a company can achieve the cost savings and business process efficiencies that result in market differentiation. E-procurement is a good example (Q79). Early adopters not only reduced their procurement costs, but also achieved the prestige of being innovators in their markets. Another example illustrates the value of early adopters within a single department. One IT group found that product development was always one step ahead of\n\ns-\n\n24\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nthem on implementing new releases of desktop products. As soon as the beta version of a product was available on the Internet, product development would install it. This wreaked havoc with other products on the desktop, including virus scanners and network tools. Service outages increased, and IT wasted resources reacting to the resulting problems (Q84). After weighing several options, the IT group decided to make this group their ally instead of their adversary. IT committed to having new releases of standard desktop products implemented across the enterprise within six months of the first customer ship date. To meet this goal, they asked the early adopters in the development group to help them troubleshoot new releases before implementing releases company-wide. The first benefit of this approach was a reduction in service outages. As an early adopter of a new release, the IT group could act as a reference site for the desktop product vendor, who agreed to provide additional support in return. Once the program was fully implemented, the up-front costs of this aggressive approach were offset by a reduction in ongoing support costs.\n\nKEY SuPPLIER RELATIONSHIPs ARE IMPORTANT, Too\n\nWhen making this decision, companies need to assess the relationships that they have with their key suppliers, as well as their approach to staffing their IT function. In particular, a company is much more likely to be successful deploying bleeding- or leading-edge technologies if it has a close relationship with its key suppliers and they are invested in making the company successful. Analogously, a company is much more likely to be successful deploying bleeding- or leading-edge technologies if the IT organization is staffed with highly skilled individuals who have a strong desire to continually learn new technologies. Is THERE A SINGLE ANSWER FOR A CoMPANY?\n\nIn many cases, the answer can differ by department, further complicating the decision. Consider the case of a company with two product lines: • The legacy product line is expected to have a low cost of operation and does not require ongoing research and development. The department's goal is to \"milk a cash cow\" with minimal investment. • The other product line offers customers new features and options, which require extensive research, development, testing and marketing.\n\nLeading or bleeding-edge technology is likely to be too expensive for the legacy product line, but those technologies might be required for the other product line.\n\n6-What are the benefits of mass customization?\n\n25\n\nTable 5.2 Approach to Implementing Technology % of Respondents\n\nStatement\n\nWe like to be among the first to implement new technologies.\n\n8%\n\nWe see ourselves as an early adopter, however we wait until we see the problems others have had with implementation.\n\n40%\n\nWe adopt new technologies when we are confident that they have become mainstream and widely accepted.\n\n44%\n\nWe are reluctant to go to new technologies and will generally do so only when necessary.\n\n8%\n\nSource: Ashton, Metzler & Associates and Key3Medio Group, Inc., • Voice Over IP,\" Study, 6 May 2002.\n\nHow Do\n\nCOMPANIES APPROACH TECHNOLOGY?\n\nSurvey data show that relatively few companies are either truly bleeding-edge or laggards when it comes to the adoption of new technologies (Table 5.2). The bulk of companies are almost equally split into two camps relative to new technologies deployment. One camp likes to adopt a new technology only after the bleeding-edge adopters have exposed some of the major issues relative to the implementation of that technology. The second camp likes to wait until the technology has been in use for a while and the majority of issues have been resolved. The decision to use bleeding-edge, leading-edge, or following-edge technologies needs to be a balanced one. The company's tolerance for risk, cost, and service interruption must be balanced with the potential value (both process efficiencies and market differentiation) each option affords.\n\n6. What are the benefits of mass customization? RAYMOND F. ZAMMUTO\n\nMass customization refers to the production of customized goods and services at the low costs associated with mass production. The term was coined by Stan Davis in his 1987 book, Future Perfect, and reflected the accelerating breakup of many mass markets. Marketing guru Regis McKenna notes that there were many leading brands\n\n6-\n\n26\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nin the early 1980s but \"other\" had become the leader in many product categories by the 2000. 1 In essence, consumer preferences shifted from \"brand\" in the 1980s to \"choice\" two decades later, reflecting increasing consumer demands for \"what they want, when and where they want it.\" 2\n\nCusTOMIZATION\n\nvs.\n\nMAss PRoDucTION\n\nMass customization captures the benefits of the two primary strategies open to organizations through the 1980s, customization and mass production. Customization was the earlier strategy of the two. All goods prior to the industrial revolution were, by definition, customized because they were manufactured on a craft basis. Craftsmen designed and handcrafted goods for individual consumers, making each item unique. The mechanization of production during the industrial revolution changed this because mechanized production required that goods be standardized (i.e., each unit produced was identical). Consumers benefited from lower prices because the efficiency of mass production lowered costs. For example, when Henry Ford began producing Model T's on assembly lines, the Ford Motor Company was able to lower the price of the Model T to consumers by 50 percent. At the same time, however, mass production reduced consumer choice. You could buy a Model T in any color as long as it was black. Corporate strategy paralleled these methods of production. You could be a lowcost leader in an industry by mass producing standardized goods and services for the mass market, or you could differentiate your products by producing smaller quantities for specific, smaller (and usually premium) market segments. Michael Porter captured this distinction in his landmark 1980 book, Competitive Strategy, where the two primary generic strategies he described were cost leader vs. differentiator. 3\n\nMAss CusTOMIZATION\n\nMuch as mechanization redefined production during the industrial revolution, the rise of information technology brought about fundamental changes to the production of goods and services during the 1980s. Programmable automation began replacing dedicated automation, which allowed changes in production to be made by modifying a system's software instead of scrapping and replacing dedicated 1 Regis McKenna, Total Access: Giving Customers What They Want in an Anytime, Anywhere World (Boston: HBSP, 2002) 111. 2 Brian Fitzgerald, \"Mass Customization-At a Profit,\" World Class Design to Manufacture 43.1\n\n(1995): 43. 3 Michael Porter, Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors (New York: Free Press, 1980).\n\n6-What are the benefits of mass customization?\n\nequipment that could manufacture only one specific item efficiently. Suddenly, economies of scope-the ability to efficiently and quickly produce any of a range of parts or services within a family-as opposed to economies of scale-the ability to efficiently produce a large volume of a single good or service-became a competitive possibility. 4 In service operations, information technology advances created opportunities for the fast movement of information across historic functional boundaries streamlining operations, improving contact with customers, and creating whole new classes of value-adding services, which made it possible for service firms to differentiate their offerings across customer segments. Airlines, for example, identify and offer their high value customers-frequent fliers-special deals, discounts and additional services. Overall, advances in information technology make possible a new strategy where a firm can be simultaneously efficient and responsive in the design, production, and distribution of their goods and services, and can react quickly with greater flexibility as consumer demands and market conditions change. In manufacturing industries, mass-customizing firms typically work with a set of modular designs or components that are modified according to customers preferences. Customers are presented with menus of choices, the final product reflecting the configuration they desire. Dell Computer is perhaps the most recognized example of this type of mass customizer. Dell Computer offers basic configurations that customers can modify by adding or subtracting components and specifying the type of component they desire, such as speed of the processor and size of the hard drive. Other mass customizers work from basic designs that are tailored to each specific consumer. Andersen 'Windows, for instance, offers basic window designs that are sized for each customer and customized with selected options. Service customization, often in the form of value-adding services, is another form of mass customization. Amazon. com, for example, analyzes customer data using recommendation engines to suggest additional purchases based on past buying behavior. IT service providers, such as ASPs (Qso) are mass customizers in that they offer template-based application solutions to multiple clients that can be configured to each customer's needs. 5 Similarly, telecommunication firms are becoming mass customizers by packaging and pricing communications services into bundles targeted at different groups of consumers. Configuring the bundles is achieved by turning different services on or off through software, allowing these firms to offer each consumer exactly the package of services they want. 4 M. Jelinek and J. D. Goldhar, \"The Strategic Implications of the Factory of the Future,\" MIT Sloan Management Review 25.4 (1984): 29-37. 5 Elena Christopher and Geraldine Cruz, Mass Customization of IT and Business Services: Insights from the Automotive!ndustry, Gartner, Inc., Dataquest Perspective ITSV-WW- D P -013 5, 20 Sept.\n\n2001.\n\n27\n\n6-\n\n28\n\nIT and Strategy\n\nWHY MAss CusTOMIZATION Is HARD TO\n\nDo\n\nWhile the benefits of mass customization are appealing, most organizations find it hard to do. There are three primary reasons for this: 1. customer demand\n\n2. organizational capabilities 3. supply chain flexibility\n\nCustomer Demand There is always a question of whether customization will increase the value of a good or service from the perspective of the customer. Gartner Research notes that only certain types of consumer products are amenable to mass customization-those where customers: • desire to customize products to satisfy personal tastes or preferences, • need to customize products for health or physiological needs, • need to customize products for functionality. 6\n\nIf there is potential demand, then there is a question of whether customers are willing to pay a premium and wait for the delivery of a good or service versus buying a standardized version immediately off-the-shelf at a lower price. Even within favorable product categories, it is likely that only a minority of consumers will value customization. In other words, while it may be technologically feasible to customize a good or service, there may not be a large enough market opportunity to make mass customization a profitable strategy.\n\nOrganizational Capabilities Mass customization requires a higher degree of organizational flexibility than most organizations possess-particularly those that have been mass producers of goods and services. Historically, manufacturing and service organizations have been functionally organized with vertical flows of information and authority. Mass customization requires that information flow where it is needed quickly, regardless of who historically might have \"owned\" it. ERP and CRM systems can provide this type of information flow, but as is noted elsewhere in this volume (Q63, Q64), such systems are difficult to implement. Moreover, organizations need flexible cultures and structures that provide the authority needed by line personnel to respond quickly to varying customer needs, preferences, and demands (Q48). In other 6 Hung LeHong, CPG Industry: Will the Internet Bring Mass Customization? Gartner, Inc., Commentary COM-13-5214, 23 May 2001.\n\n6-What are the benefits of mass customization?\n\n29\n\nwords, the degree to which a firm can function as a mass customizer is directly related to the extent to which it has organizational and operational flexibility. 6-\n\nSupply Chain Flexibility Mass customization also requires a flexible supply chain. Mass production is a push system, where firms produce a forecast and the suppliers provide inputs based on those forecasts. Inventories buffer the production system from demand variations, allowing the supply chain time to respond to changes in demand. In contrast, mass customization is a pull system, where goods and services are produced on demand. On one hand, costs are reduced by running \"lean\" systems with little or no inventory. On the other, little or no inventory means that the supply chain needs the ability to respond to demand changes in real-time. This requires that all the members of the supply chain have flexible operations and the ability to communicate with the mass-customizing firm quickly. Supply chain management systems (SCM) (Q67) can increase the speed of communication by integrating members' operations virtually, but, as is discussed elsewhere (Q68), these systems are difficult to implement successfully. 7\n\nIMPLICATIONS\n\nMass customization is an alluring strategy for many organizations. It can make them more responsive to the consumer, which can increase customer satisfaction and loyalty while increasing profit margins. However, achieving a successful mass customization strategy is difficult because it requires that: • customization provides an attractive value proposition for consumers, • the mass customizer is able to operate flexibly, • the supply chain operates flexibly as well.\n\nThese last two points are where the technology comes in. Enterprise resource management systems (Q62), customer relationship management systems (Q65), and supply chain management systems (Q66) form the technological backbone that enables a mass customization strategy. If there is insufficient demand to make mass customization profitable or if these technologies cannot be successfully implemented ( Q78, Q79), mass customization won't work.\n\n7 For an example of a flexible, integrated supply chain, see Joan Magretta, \"The Power of Virtual Integration,\" Harvard Business Review 76.2 (1998): 72-84.\n\n30\n\nIT and Strategy\n\n7. Should a company consider interim or \"throwaway\" systems as part of its technology strategy? CHERYL L. WHITE AND THOMAS KIEFER\n\nThe theme of the 21st century is change. Building throwaway systems is one way to keep up with change. As information replaces commodities and materials as the primary product on the market, the need for instant access to useful and usable data grows exponentially. Unprecedented morphing in how businesses do business mandates an IT strategy that supports the development of interim and temporary IT solutions. The technical challenge is to remain abreast o"
