Eric Hahn, who joined Netscape Communications (NSCP) when it acquired his company Collabra Software two years ago, has taken a sabbatical and will return to the company next month in a different capacity.

The company recently underwent a reorganization, and Hahn will return as one of four top executives who report to CEO Jim Barksdale in the new hierarchy, according to Netscape spokeswoman Andrea Cook.

Company policy gives employees a sabbatical every four years, and Hahn's two years at Collabra plus two at Netscape made him eligible for the break, Cook said.

Taking over Hahn's role is John Paul, senior vice president and general manager of the server products division.

Since the Collabra acquisition, Netscape has integrated that company's technology into its servers and its Communicator client.
