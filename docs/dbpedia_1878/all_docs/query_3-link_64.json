        "text": "Congratulations to the entire team Hyperscience - what a week. Not one but TWO leader positions from different Tier 1 analysts. What we built with the ML community was hard…but getting the partners and customers behind us was equally tough. Thank you to Forrester and IDC for the recognition. With recognition comes responsibility to lead in the right way! One special call out to Randy Cairns - the best in the business. We are all grateful for your stewardship of all these efforts. #hyperautomation #enterpriseAI #leader\n\nEnjoyed representing Hyperscience at the #cloudny event at the Rainbow Room at 30 Rock! Hard not to take away some amazing insights when 150 current CEO & Founders are talking....but fellow Hyperscience Board member Matt Turck teased out some of the best nuggets regarding #AI: - About half of the GenAI use cases by businesses revolve around ChatBots; but an interesting second is sales enablement - The world is shifting quite rapidly to use of smaller, bespoke models, even verticalized...but OpenAI seems to get the first nod when experimenting. And there are a lot of experiments happening - Data scientists are quite proficient at using modern ML techniques...it's that their underlying data or a company's data estate is not in order to leverage it yet. The latter is exactly what Hyperscience is ready to change for the enterprise....unlock your ground truth with an accuracy-controlled approach to your information assets - 99+% required, doubts not included. #hyperautomation\n\nOur team at Hyperscience - Randy Cairns, Mayur Pillay Brian Weiss just returned from the buzzy Google Cloud event in Las Vegas, which was brimming with energy (and lot of talk of generative AI). Rumors were that crowds were 2.5x previous years - and it felt like it. Clearly, the Google Cloud folks are on a roll with Gemini, VertexAI platforms, and six new AI agents—all poised to handle cuts of your business with #genai applications. With the adrenaline of the keynote behind us, here are the takeaways that we picked up during our breakouts and participation on the expo floor. - The frontier models are eye-wateringly amazing, but most of demos were use cases at the edge of the enterprise where information and data are fairly innocuous - ie correspondence, marketing content, chat agents - The reality is that moving this technology into the enterprise core (lots of folks were riffing on RAG) will require some significant work by the tech community. The frontier models & new genAI architectures can’t work on bad data. - Most organizations are not close to RAG ready. Somewhat forgotten, there are now multiple frontier models sitting in multiple clouds…feels like cloud wars all over again. - The rewards of adopting this technology are undeniable. It will lead to inevitably too many science projects in the enterprise. (Demonstrations and proof of concepts are relatively easy). Engineering it into a reliable, resilient, trusted application will be really hard and achieving tangible ROI will be critical. Read more about our perspective & learnings here. https://lnkd.in/gh58Nmum I’m excited for Hyperscience to participate in the future adoption of these technologies. Accurate data from ground truth in the enterprise in a trust worthy fashion is essential to the future of AI. #AI #hyperautomation\n\nA great article…I continue to be humbled by what was a wrong perception of our government. Hyperscience has inked its 2nd high-7 figure contract for our AI software infrastructure to handle over 1 billion annual forms and documents. It’s simply stunning to me how complex it is to ensure every citizen is served correctly and accurately - and with speed. Our government has leaned into procuring AI infrastructure swiftly, technically proving it merits with clarity; and it will generate hundreds of millions of dollars of hard ROI at 99.5% accuracy and 98% automation. And I sense this is only the beginning…. #hyperautomation #ai #roi https://lnkd.in/dT8htWys\n\nLeave it to #AI to throw another convention on its head…I attended our partner Palantir Technologies' #S4G summit last week - a fantastic thought-leader symposium with all our top government and elite agency professionals. Classic enterprise GTM considers the Fed a laggard, slow-to-adopt & hard to penetrate market…but what's clear is Federal is THE vertical leading enterprise AI adoption. AI isn’t new to the US government…it’s been widely used in defense, aviation & intelligence efforts The government is mature in its assessment / roll-out of AI tech which requires unique security, data handling & ethical use considerations. If I’m a corporate entity, I’m looking for firms like Hyperscience with proven use cases in Federal. It’s WAY ahead of the enterprise and a flip of the traditional script #enterpriseAI #hyperautomation"
