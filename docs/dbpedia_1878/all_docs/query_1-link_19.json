        "text": "I have long said sailors are mariners and warfighters first and foremost. So naturally, I find a lot to like in the below from the US Navy Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. Clear, succinct and on point. Clarity of purpose and a clear-eyed vision of the threat is important. Of course, a conflict in the Indo-Pacific would be catastrophic and we must do all we can to prevent it where possible. But failing to prepare for it or acknowledge it simply undermines deterrence. If conflict is to arise in the Indo-Pacific it will be fought across all domains, military and non-military but geography dictates it will likely be very much maritime in nature. We must prepare our maritime warfighters for this potential, and we must do so now, and hope in doing so we bolster our deterrence strategy.\n\nThis is an outstanding list of priorities. This is what the Space Force should have. Nowhere in here does the Navy say it's a support force for the other services. Nowhere in here does it say it relies on others to do it's missions. It's a warfighting service that deters and projects combat, warfighting power. The CNO has provided the example for the CSO. Let's replace the \"Comprehensive Strategy for the Space Force\" with a spacepower version of this!!! National Institute for Deterrence Studies Peter Garretson Peter Marquez https://lnkd.in/eUd23ax3\n\nIt goes without saying that upstream interventions lead to positive outcomes down stream. Military to civilian transition is a crucial time to connect these service members and their families to available services in housing, health care, employment, education, benefits, and social enrichment. The DoD/VA Liasion Office has agreements with the states to share information that allows local County Veteran Service Officers to better reach transitioning service members. In North Carolina that data is not pushed down to counties. Any effort that doesn’t involve the counties/local communities at the grassroots level is missing the mark! Time for the state to give that contact data to the County Veteran Service Offices (CVSO) and the VA to let us be involved in programs like Solid Start. These things would better enable CVSOs to ensure we connect veterans to services. We need state and national veteran leaders to assist. The CVSOs are ready to work towards a goal of 100% contact with veterans moving back into our communities. Walter E. Gaskin, John Boerstler, Michael (Mike) Odle"
