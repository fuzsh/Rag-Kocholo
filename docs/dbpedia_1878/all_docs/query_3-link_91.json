Sterrett was born to David and Mary Sterrett of Erie, Pennsylvania at an unknown date. His father David Sterrett was born on March 30, 1789. During the War of 1812 he served as an ensign in the state militia. On March 23, 1815 he returned to his native place, Sterrettania and married Mary. In 1828 he and his brother, Thomas, built and operated a distillery for about seven years. In addition, he built a sawmill and gristmill in 1839. He died on his farm on December 22, 1865. David and Mary's children include Anne M., Brice Innis, Martha J., James L., Rachel R., Mary E., Andrew J., Robert Woods, Thomas, Isabel, and their last child was David Brice Innis.\n\nDavid Brice Innis Sterret attended Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania and graduated with both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in 1857. During his time at Allegheny College he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and the \"Society of Seven\". The \"Society of Seven\" also included Levi Bird Duff, William H. Heller, Harvey Henderson, F. Alsor Jones, James Mills Thoburn, and David D. Waugh. Nothing is known of the activities of the \"Society of Seven\" but many of its members went on to pursue influential careers in the church, law, military, and politics.\n\nLevi Bird Duff (b. 1837) graduated from Allegheny College in 1857 as a member of Phi Kappa Psi earning both a Bachelor of Arts, and a Master of Arts. After Graduation he came to Pittsburgh to study law in the office of George S. Seldon and was admitted to the bar on April 1, 1860. He enlisted during the Civil War on May 1, 1861 and was assigned to Company A of the 38th Pennsylvania Volunteers. On February 6, 1862 he was appointed Captain to Company D of the 105th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers and then became a Lieutenant Colonel on May 18, 1864. During his time in the army he fought in many battles namely Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg to name just a few. On June 18, 1864 he lost a leg at Petersburg, Virginia and on the following October 24th was discharged for his wounds. He then returned to Pittsburgh and to his law practice. In 1865 he was elected District Attorney and held the position for three years before returning again to his private practice. Duff married twice in his life first to Harriet H. Nixon on July 21, 1862 who subsequently died on July 16, 1877 leaving him two children, Samuel E. and Hezekiah Nixon. He then married his second wife Agnes Kaufman on January 16, 1882.\n\nHarvey Henderson served in numerous positions in the church, military, law, and education. He graduated from Allegheny College in 1857 as a member of Phi Kappa Psi with a Bachelor of Arts, a Master of Arts, and a Doctor of Laws. After graduation he was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Meadville, Pennsylvania until 1871. He then became licensed to preach in 1871 with the Methodist Episcopal Church in the Erie Conference. In 1873 Gilbert Haven ordained Henderson a deacon in the church. Then in 1875 Bishop Levi Scott ordained him an elder. He preached in the following areas; Rootstown and Randolph (1871-1872), Twinsburg and Hudson (1873), New Wilmington (1874), Forestville (1875-1877), Clarion (1880-1881), New Castle, First Church (1880-1881). On June 22, 1868 he was elected to the Allegheny College Board of Trustees and was still serving in that position in 1905. He also served as a Corporal of the Pennsylvania 58th Regiment during the Civil War. On November 18, 1882 he was admitted to the Allegheny County Bar Association.\n\nF. Alsor Jones graduated from Allegheny College in 1857 as a member of Phi Kappa Psi with a Bachelor of Arts. He then served during the Civil War as a Captain of the 6th Maryland Volunteers and was wounded at Cheat Run on July 15, 1861. He was later promoted Brigadier General in 1864.\n\nJames M. Thoburn (b.1836-d.1922) graduated from Allegheny College in 1857 as a member of Phi Kappa Psi with a Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, Doctor of Divinity, and a Doctor of Laws. After college he achieved significant recognition as a Methodist Episcopal missionary serving from 1859 to 1908 in Asia. In 1888 he was elected Missionary Bishop. He later retired that year in 1908 to Meadville, Pennsylvania.\n\nFinally, David D. Waugh became an attorney at law and William H. Heller became a teacher. Both graduated from Allegheny College in 1857 as members' of Phi Kappa Psi with both receiving a Bachelor of Arts, and a Master of Arts.\n\nAfter college David Brice Innis Sterret moved to the Texas as repeated letters from his family and friends urge him to come home before the troubles between the North and South escalate. In addition, it appears that Sterrett in 1858 was searching for a teaching position and probably held one for a short period of time. He also studied law after college and was admitted to the bar in 1859. According to the letters he became a practicing lawyer after being admitted to the bar. David Brice Innis Sterrett died sometime before 1916 as the centennial history of Allegheny College published that year indicated that he was deceased.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nThe David Brice Innis Sterrett papers are housed in one archival box and are arranged alphabetically by folder title. These papers include correspondence received by David Brice Innis Sterrett, genealogical information, and school records. The authors of the correspondence include David Sterrett (father), Mollie Sterrett (niece, daughter of Thomas Sterrett who married Nancy C. Sturgeon), Mary S. Norton (niece, daughter of Ann M. Sterret who married Rev. Hiram Norton), L.B. Duff, W.H. Heller, H. Henderson, F. A. Jones, D.D. Waugh, and about twenty other lesser-known people.\n\nEighteen of the letters were written by himself and his family, which includes letters from his father, David Sterrett, and his two nieces Mollie and Mary S. Norton. His father's correspondence contains discussions of family matters, local events, farming concerns, and the impending political troubles between the North and the South. Several letters urge his son to leave the South before troubles escalate. Of particular interest is a letter dated August 21, 1860 which discusses the father's concern over the North and South debate and Lincoln's chances for election. Mollie and Mary S. Norton's correspondence deals with family matters, local events, and the effects of the Civil War on the area of Erie, Pennsylvania. Of particular interest is one letter from Mollie dated August 19,1862 which details Allegheny College's enrollment and new faculty. In addition, this letter also discusses a soldier who died after the Battle of Richmond and the current status of the Army of the Potomac. Furthermore, another letter of interest is from Mary S. Norton dated October 19, 1862, which discusses Cavalry Company's intentions on leaving Monday and that among their highest officers is Phillips and Smiths who both were graduates of Allegheny College and Phi Kappa Psi members.\n\nTwenty of the letters were written by members of the \"Society of Seven\" namely L.B. Duff, W.H. Heller, H. Henderson, F. A. Jones, and D.D. Waugh. There are no letters in this collection from James M. Thoburn. The \"Society of Seven\" correspondence includes updates of the other members, discussions of legal issues and readings, and slavery. Of particular interest is a letter by L.B. Duff dated January 17, 1858, which describes differences between city and rural lawyers. In addition, letters from L.B. Duff dated March 7, 1858 and May 4, 1858, are also of interest, which discuss slavery.\n\nThe remaining fifty letters are from miscellaneous people ranging from school heads, legal book publishers, to clients. Some of the names include Marcus Hotchkif Sander, William H. Sheakly, H.P. & R.H. Small, and Samuel Post. These letters deal with Sterrett's early search for a teaching position, personal and local news, law book orders, legal issues of clients (mainly pensions and one case of nonpayment for horses), Allegheny College, and war news. Of particular interest is a letter from Sander dated December 7, 1861. This letter deals with Allegheny College's enrollment and also includes references to the Pittsburgh Rifles, and Major M. Schlaudecker of Erie and his 111th Pennsylvania Regiment.\n\nFinally, this collection contains a family genealogy and school records. The genealogical information is unclear and does not follow standard practices of organization. In addition, the school records are also unclear and it uncertain exactly what school they originate from and what information they document.\n\nArrangement\n\nThe David Brice Innis Sterrett Papers are housed in one box and are arranged alphabetically by folder title.\n\nConditions Governing Access\n\nThis collection is open for research.\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition\n\nThese materials came in one accession in 1991.\n\nAcc# 1991.0050 Gift of Willard J.
