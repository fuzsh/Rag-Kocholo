        "text": "The Gridiron Club of Greater Boston Web site: http://www.gridclubboston.com/\n\nBOSTON -- Senior Erik Larsson, and sophomore Zach Dill were named semifinalists for the 23rd Joe Concannon Award, presented annually to the best American-born NCAA Division II/III hockey player in New England. Larsson, a semifinalist last year, has 27 points this season, including nine goals and 18 assists. He is tied for second in scoring in the Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference (MASCAC). Dill has accumulated 25 points in his second season for the Vikings - seven goals and 18 assists - and is fourth in the league in scoring.\n\nThe Gridiron Club established the Joe Concannon Award in 2001 to honor Joe, a lifelong devotee of college hockey, former member of the Walter Brown Award Selection Committee and, as a journalist, a staunch advocate for the amateur athletes he knew and covered. A native of Litchfield, Connecticut, Joe graduated from Boston University in 1961. He served as sports information director (SID) at Holy Cross before joining the Boston Globe in the late 1960's to cover college sports. Joe declined frequent invitations by his editors to write about Boston's major professional sports teams, preferring to concentrate on the colleges, distance running and golf. He authored the book Marathoning with Bill Rodgers and established the highly successful Litchfield Road Race in his hometown. Joe was a world traveler and was especially proud of his Irish heritage, frequently sojourning to the Emerald Isle. He passed away in 2000.\n\nTwenty-five institutions are represented in the slate of candidates that includes five players from the New England Hockey Conference (NEHC), five from the Northeast-10 Conference (NE-10), seven from the Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference (MASCAC), nine from the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) and ten from the Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC). Two independent programs, Anna Maria, and Albertus Magnus, also have nominees this season. The list of nominees includes 27 forwards, six defensemen and five goaltenders.

The 38 semifinalists represent our largest field in the 23-year history of the Concannon Award, and it was a great challenge reduce the list to that number. We always expect to see the strongest contenders for the award emerge over the final weeks of the regular season, conference championship tournaments and the NCAA title chase in March. The committee will be watching closely to see which players rise to the top for this year's Concannon.\" The Gridiron Club will announce the finalists and winner of the 23 rd Joe Concannon Award in March, following league playoffs and before the start of NCAA Frozen Four on March 22 & 24 on the campus of Trinity College in Hartford, CT."
