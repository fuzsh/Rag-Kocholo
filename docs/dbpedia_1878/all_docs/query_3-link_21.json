        "text": "GRANVILLE - After more than 70 years, one of Granville’s own will receive special recognition for his action during World War II.\n\nAndrew “Andy” Sterrett recently received notice from the French government he has been awarded that country’s highest honor, the Legion d’ Honneur (Legion of Honor), for his valor and sacrifice in France during the war.\n\n“It’s quite a surprise, quite an honor,” Sterrett said from his home at Middleton, a senior living facility in Granville. “I really am going to accept it in the name of many other people who helped me along the way. I haven’t gotten through 70 years all by myself.”\n\nSterrett, now 92, was born and raised in the Pittsburgh area and started college at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nHe had dreams of becoming a mathematics professor but in June of 1943 he was called to active duty with the newly formed 44th Infantry Division. After D-Day, the 44th shipped out for France.\n\n“It was something that had to be done,” he said. Sterrett is a man of few, but thoughtful, words.\n\nHis unit, largely inexperienced, was thrown into the front lines of France in November 1944. They soon became engaged in a desperate battle with the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division (armored infantry).\n\nOn Nov. 5, 1944, without warning, the Germans began shelling the American position near the eastern French town of Luneville. Sterrett was caught in the open. A shell exploded near him, almost severing his left arm and badly injuring his right arm.\n\nHe spent the night in an unheated bunker where a combat medic fought to keep him alive. The following day, he was evacuated to a rear area medical facility.\n\nHe regained full consciousness days later to find himself in a body cast.\n\nA Red Cross volunteer offered to write a letter home for Sterrett since he had lost his arm. That was his first indication of the seriousness of his wounds. He was evacuated the following day.\n\n“Even though I lost an arm, I wasn’t the only one,” he said. “When I was still overseas I was in a group of 20, I would say, waiting to get on a ship to come back to the States. Nineteen of them had one or two legs off and I had lost an arm. So I wasn’t by myself.”\n\n“When I got back here I ended up in a hospital in Battle Creek, Michigan with three other men,” he continued. “They all had lost two hands or two arms and I had lost only one, so I never really felt sorry for myself. Since I wanted to be a teacher, I knew it was something I could live with.”\n\nHe obtained his first full-time college teaching position at Ohio University. In 1953 he began his teaching career at Denison University.\n\nIn addition to serving as the chair of the mathematics department, he was also dean of the college in the 1970s before his retirement in 1989.\n\nAdditionally, he served multiple terms on the Granville school board, was treasurer of the First Baptist Church in Granville and served as a Granville Foundation board member.\n\nBased on his “selfless and remarkable service to country and community,” Kevin Bennett, a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the US Army as well as a current Granville Township trustee, recommended Sterrett for the Legion d’ Honneur.\n\n“It’s the story of a quiet young man of education and bright future but who answered his country’s call in its hour of need,” Bennett explained.\n\n“There are only two men I’ve truly admired in life and try to emulate,” Bennett concluded. “One was fictional (Atticus Finch). The other is Andy Sterrett. His life is an inspiring demonstration of human fortitude.”\n\nWhile he has been sent the medal already, he will be officially honored at a ceremony scheduled for Veterans Day, Nov. 11, and planning continues for the presentation.\n\nAward ceremony takes shape\n\nAn award ceremony for Andrew Sterrett’s acceptance of the Legion d’ Honneur has been set for 1 p.m. Nov. 11 — Veteran’s Day — at Swasey Chapel. More details will appear in The Sentinel as they become available."
