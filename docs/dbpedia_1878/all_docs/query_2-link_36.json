        "text": "In his eighth year guiding Purdue Athletics, Executive Vice President and Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Mike Bobinski has raised expectations, expanded support for all student-athletes and inspired the Boilermakers’ passionate fan base with notable academic, competitive and development successes.\n\nThese aforementioned achievements include the rise of Purdue Men’s Basketball to consistent national prominence under head coach Matt Painter, monumental victories and bowl trophies for Boilermaker Football and multi-million dollar facility enhancements to Ross-Ade Stadium, Mackey Arena and the Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex.\n\nSuccess across all 18 sport programs has become an expectation at Purdue, with noteworthy accomplishments in recent seasons of competition. The Old Gold & Black’s volleyball program twice reached the NCAA Regional Finals (2020, 2021), the soccer squad advanced to the NCAA Tournament (2021) and the women’s basketball team returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in six seasons with a March Madness berth in 2023. Purdue’s golf programs have excelled, with both the men’s and women’s squads combining for 11 NCAA Regional appearances since 2017.\n\nThree Big Ten Conference regular season championships have been claimed by Purdue Men’s Basketball (2017, 2019, 2023), as well as one tournament trophy (2023). Football claimed its first-ever Big Ten West Division title in 2022, and additionally, women’s outdoor track & field won the 2017 Big Ten Championship.\n\nPurdue set an athletics department record during the 2021-22 school year with 265 Academic All-Big Ten honorees. In total under Bobinski’s watch, Boilermaker student-athletes have earned 47 Academic All-America or All-American scholar recognitions.\n\nFundraising success has been significant during Bobinski’s tenure, including the COVID-necessitated More Than A Game campaign, which raised $18.5 million and allowed Purdue Athletics to continue functioning without reducing sport programs or assuming any debt.\n\nThe John Purdue Club (JPC) secured a record-breaking $83 million in donations in 2022, including the largest cash gift in Purdue Athletics history at $20 million. JPC membership growth has been substantial, with the annual scholarship fund bringing in a record-setting amount of $13.5 million in 2023 to fully cover student-athlete scholarships for the second consecutive year. Bobinski and his team have been responsible for raising $95 million in capital project funding that will be completed by Fall 2024 on the athletics campus.\n\nPurdue’s energized fan base has responded, with Mackey Arena currently holding a 57-game sellout streak for Coach Painter’s hoops program. Football attendance has grown from a season average of 34,500 in 2016 to more than 57,000 for the 2023 season, spurring forward the recently completed $45.4 million opening phase of renovation at Ross-Ade Stadium.\n\nIn 2017-18, Purdue accumulated a school-record 585.5 points in the Directors' Cup to rank 39th out of 351 schools, the 89th percentile. The placement was the best by the Boilermakers in nine years. Purdue teams achieved an average Big Ten finish of 6.30, good for fourth place and the department's best showing in eight years.\n\nBobinski, who was named the ninth full-time athletics director in Purdue history Aug. 9, 2016 - the first with no previous ties to the school - is primed to take the Boilermakers to greater heights. He is under contract through June 30, 2024.\n\nBobinski is just the fourth full-time athletics director at Purdue since 1942, following Guy “Red” Mackey (1942-71), George King (1971-92) and Morgan Burke (1993-2016).\n\nBefore coming to Purdue, Bobinski enjoyed successful stints as athletics director at Georgia Tech (2013-16), Xavier (1998-2004, 2006-13) and Akron (1994-98). Between stints as AD at Xavier, he served as associate vice president for development, overseeing all of the university's fundraising efforts, including major gifts, grant services, and annual and planned giving.\n\nHighlights of Bobinski's three years at Georgia Tech included the football team winning the 2014 Orange Bowl and being ranked No. 8 in the final national poll, an NCAA Sweet 16 berth for women's tennis in 2016, conference championships and top-10 NCAA finishes by men's golf in 2014 and 2015, and back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances for baseball in 2013 and 2014.\n\nDuring Bobinski's 12-year tenure at Xavier, nine programs combined for 40 team or individual spots in NCAA championship competition. The men's basketball program averaged 25 wins, advancing to the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight in 2004 and 2008. The National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics named Bobinski the 2011-12 Under Armour Division I Northeast Athletics Director of the Year.\n\nFrom 1989-94, Bobinski was associate director of athletics at the U.S. Naval Academy. He served as associate and assistant business manager at Notre Dame from 1984-89.\n\nBobinski served as chair of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee for the 2012-13 season, and he completed a term on the NCAA Division I Baseball Committee in 2019.\n\nAs a licensed certified public accountant, Bobinski went into accounting with Deloitte, Haskins and Sells and Arthur Young & Company from 1979-82. He subsequently worked for the Walt Disney Company in Orlando, Florida, from 1982-84 before moving into college athletics.\n\nA native of Yaphank on Long Island, New York, Bobinski earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from Notre Dame in 1979, graduating magna cum laude, while playing four years for the Fighting Irish baseball team.\n\nBobinski (born Oct. 28, 1957) has two children, Melissa (a 2009 Xavier graduate) and Brian (a 2012 Ohio State graduate), and two grandchildren, Maggie and Bo.\n\nPurdue Athletics Director History Years Name 1904-05 Oliver Cutts 1906-14 Hugh Nicol 1915-18 Oliver Cutts 1919-30 Nelson Kellogg 1931-36 Noble Kizer 1937 Robert Woodworth (acting) 1938-39 Noble Kizer 1940 Edward Elliott (acting) 1941 Allen \"Mal\" Elward 1942-71 Guy \"Red\" Mackey 1971-92 George King Jr. 1992 John Hicks (interim) 1993-2016 Morgan Burke 2016- Mike Bobinski"
