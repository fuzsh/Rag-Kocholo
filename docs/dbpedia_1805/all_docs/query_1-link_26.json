Though sequences like FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) can detect a large majority of these lesions, there are smaller lesions without signal changes that can easily go unnoticed by the naked eye. The aim of this study is to improve the visibility of focal cortical dysplasia lesions in the T1 weighted brain MRI images. In the proposed method, we used a complex diffusion based approach for calculating the FCD affected areas. Based on the diffused image and thickness map, a complex map is created. From this complex map; FCD areas can be easily identified. MRI brains of 48 subjects selected by neuroradiologists were given to computer scientists who developed the complex map for identifying the cortical dysplasia. The scientists were blinded to the MRI interpretation result of the neuroradiologist. The FCD could be identified in all the patients in whom surgery was done, however three patients had false positive lesions. More lesions were identified in patients in whom surgery was not performed and lesions were seen in few of the controls. These were considered as false positive. This computer aided detection technique using complex diffusion approach can help detect focal cortical dysplasia in patients with epilepsy.\n\nRasmussen's encephalitis presenting as focal cortical dysplasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nO'Rourke, D.J.; Bergin, A.; Rotenberg, A.; Peters, J.; Gorman, M.; Poduri, A.; Cryan, J.; Lidov, H.; Madsen, J.; Harini, C.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nRasmussen's encephalitis is a rare syndrome characterized by intractable seizures, often associated with epilepsia partialis continua and symptoms of progressive hemispheric dysfunction. Seizures are usually the hallmark of presentation, but antiepileptic drug treatment fails in most patients and is ineffective against epilepsia partialis continua, which often requires surgical intervention. Co-occurrence of focal cortical dysplasia has only rarely been described and may have implications regarding pathophysiology and management. We describe a rare case of dual pathology of Rasmussen's encephalitis presenting as a focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and discuss the literature on this topic.

The visual identification of FCD lesions on magnetic resonance images (MRI) is a challenging task in standard radiological analysis. Quantitative image analysis which tries to assist in the diagnosis of FCD lesions is an active field of research. In this work we investigate the potential of different texture features, in order to explore to what extent they are suitable for detecting lesional tissue. As a result we can show first promising results based on segmentation and texture classification.\n\nBilateral Thalamocortical Abnormalities in Focal Cortical Dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRezayev, Arthur; Feldman, Henry A; Levman, Jacob; Takahashi, Emi\n\n2018-05-05\n\nFocal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a congenital malformation of the neocortex and one of the most common causes of medication resistant epilepsy in pediatric populations, can be studied noninvasively by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The present study aimed to quantify changes in the thalamus and thalamocortical pathways with respect to fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), volume, and other common measures. The study quantified data collected from pediatric patients with a prior diagnosis of FCD; 75 patients (35 females, 10.1 Â± 6.5 years) for analysis of thalamic volume and 68 patients (32 females, 10.2 Â± 6.4 years) for DTI analysis. DTI scans were taken at 3 Tesla MRI scanners (30 diffusion gradient directions; b= 1000 s/mm 2 and 5 non diffusion-weighted measurements). DTI tractography was performed using the FACT algorithm with an angle threshold of 45 degrees. Manually delineated ROIs were used to compare the hemisphere containing the dysplasia to the contralateral hemisphere and controls. A significant decrease in the volume of the FCD hemisphere thalamus was detected as compared to the contralateral hemisphere. In comparison to controls, there was an observed reduction in tract volume, length, count, FA of thalami, and FA of thalamocortical pathways in FCD patients. FCD patients had higher odds of exhibiting high ADC in both the thalamus and thalamocortical pathways. The data implied a widespread reduction in structural connectivity of the thalamocortical network. MRI analysis suggests a potential influence of FCD on thalamic volume. Copyright Â© 2018.

It is considered a sporadic disorder, but its occasional familial occurrence suggests the involvement of genetic mechanisms. Siblings with intractable epilepsy were referred for epilepsy surgery evaluation. Both patients were examined using video-EEG monitoring, MRI examination and PET imaging. They underwent left anteromedial temporal lobe resection. Electroclinical features pointed to left temporal lobe epilepsy and MRI examination revealed typical signs of left-sided hippocampal sclerosis and increased white matter signal intensity in the left temporal pole. PET examination confirmed interictal hypometabolism in the left temporal lobe. Histopathological examination of resected tissue demonstrated the presence FCD type IIIa, i.e. hippocampal sclerosis and focal cortical dysplasia in the left temporal pole. We present a unique case of refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in siblings, characterized by an identical clinical profile and histopathology of FCD type IIIa, who were successfully treated by epilepsy surgery. The presence of such a high concordance between the clinical and morphological data, together with the occurrence of epilepsy and febrile seizures in three generations of the family pedigree points towards a possible genetic nature of the observed FCD type IIIa.

We retrospectively analysed the outcome of 67 patients from 2 to 66 years of age at follow-up periods of 6 to 48 months after epilepsy surgery. Histological subtypes were classified according to Palmini and included a few cases with mild histological abnormalities corresponding to the definition of mild malformations of cortical development. The seizure outcome was classified according to Engel and evaluated at the last follow-up visit as well as at follow-up periods of 12 and 24 months after surgery. The outcome in patients with FCD and additional hippocampal pathology (dual pathology) was analysed separately. Distribution of histological subtypes differed in temporal and extratemporal localization, with a significantly higher extratemporal prevalence of FCD type 2. There was a tendency towards better postsurgical outcome related to the last follow-up visit in patients with more subtle abnormalities classified as mild malformations of cortical development (mMCD) (63% Engel Ia), FCD type 1a (67% Engel Ia) and FCD type 1b (55% Engel Ia) compared with patients with FCD type 2a (43% Engel Ia) and FCD type 2b (Taylor type) (50% Engel Ia). Considering the outcome at follow-up periods over 12 and 24 months, complete seizure-freedom was achieved significantly more often in patients with FCD type 1 and mMCD than with FCD type 2, and seizure reduction by less than 75% (Engel IV) occurred in more patients with FCD type 2a compared with the other subgroups. This tendency was seen in the whole patient group and in the extratemporal subgroup. Patients with dual pathology almost always had temporal lobe epilepsy; the outcome in this patient group was generally favourable (66% complete seizure-freedom at the last follow-up visit). The outcome remained\n\nTowards in vivo focal cortical dysplasia phenotyping using quantitative MRI.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdler, Sophie; Lorio, Sara; Jacques, Thomas S; Benova, Barbora; Gunny, Roxana; Cross, J Helen; Baldeweg, Torsten; Carmichael, David W\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFocal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are a range of malformations of cortical development each with specific histopathological features. Conventional radiological assessment of standard structural MRI is useful for the localization of lesions but is unable to accurately predict the histopathological features. Quantitative MRI offers the possibility to probe tissue biophysical properties in vivo and may bridge the gap between radiological assessment and ex-vivo histology. This review will cover histological, genetic and radiological features of FCD following the ILAE classification and will explain how quantitative voxel- and surface-based techniques can characterise these features. We will provide an overview of the quantitative MRI measures available, their link with biophysical properties and finally the potential application of quantitative MRI to the problem of FCD subtyping. Future research linking quantitative MRI to FCD histological properties should improve clinical protocols, allow better characterisation of lesions in vivo and tailored surgical planning to the individual.\n\nAltered inhibition in Tuberous Sclerosis and Type IIb cortical dysplasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTalos, Delia M.; Sun, Hongyu; Kosaras, Bela; Joseph, Annelise; Folkerth, Rebecca D.; Poduri, Annapurna; Madsen, Joseph R.; Black, Peter M.; Jensen, Frances E.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective The most common neurological symptom of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is early-life refractory epilepsy. As previous studies have shown enhanced excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission in TSC and FCD brains, we hypothesized that neurons associated with these lesions may also express altered GABAA receptor (GABAAR)-mediated inhibition. Methods Expression of the GABAAR subunitsÎ±1 and Î±4, the Na+-K+-2Clâ (NKCC1), and the K+âClâ (KCC2) transporters in human TSC and FCD Type II specimens were analyzed by Western blot and double label immunocytochemistry. GABAAR responses in dysplastic neurons from a single case of TSC were measured by perforated-patch recording and compared to normal-appearing cortical neurons from a non-TSC epilepsy case. Results TSC and FCD Type IIb lesions demonstrated decreased expression of the GABAAR Î±1, increased NKCC1 and decreased KCC2 levels. In contrast, FCD Type IIa lesions showed decreased Î±4, and increased expression of both NKCC1 and KCC2 transporters. Patch clamp recordings from dysplastic neurons in acute slices from TSC tubers demonstrated excitatory GABAAR responses that were significantly attenuated by the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide, in contrast to hyperpolarizing GABAAR-mediated currents in normal neurons from non-TSC cortical slices. Interpretation Expression and function of GABAARs in TSC and FCD IIb suggests the relative benzodiazepine insensitivity and more excitatory action of GABA compared to FCD IIa. These factors may contribute to resistance of seizure activity to anticonvulsants that increase GABAergic function, and may justify add-on trials of the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide for the treatment of TSC and FCD Type IIb related epilepsy.

Palminiâs classification proposed in 2004 is now widely used to categorize FCD. Recently, however, Blumcke et al. recommended a new system for classifying FCD in 2011. Methods: We applied the new classification system in practical diagnosis of a sample of 117 patients who underwent neurosurgical operations due to drug-resistant epilepsy at Severance Hospital in Seoul, Korea. Results: Among 117 cases, a total of 16 cases were shifted to other FCD subtypes under the new classification system. Five cases were reclassified to type IIIa and five cases were categorized as dual pathology. The other six cases were changed within the type I category. Conclusions: The most remarkable changes in the new classification system are the advent of dual pathology and FCD type III. Thus, it will be very important for pathologists and clinicians to discriminate between these new categories. More large-scale research needs to be conducted to elucidate the clinical influence of the alterations within the classification of type I disease. Although the new FCD classification system has several advantages compared to the former, the correlation with clinical characteristics is not yet clear.

We retrospectively studied 110 children who had epilepsy surgery. Twenty-seven patients with FCD were included. Thirteen had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 14 had extra-temporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE). Three patients had associated mesial temporal sclerosis. Preoperative 3T MRIs interleaved with nine controls were blindly re-reviewed and categorized according to signal alteration. Pathologic specimens were classified according to the 2011 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification and compared to MRI studies. Rates of pathology subtypes differed between TLE and ETLE (Ï 2 (3) = 8.57, p = 0.04). FCD type I was more frequent in TLE, whereas FCD type II was more frequent in ETLE. In the TLE group, nine patients had temporal tip abnormalities. They all exhibited gray-white matter blurring with decreased myelination and white matter hyperintense signal. Blurring involved the whole temporal tip, not just the area of dysplasia. These patients were less likely to demonstrate cortical thickening compared to those without temporal tip findings (Ï 2 (1) = 9.55, p = 0.002). Three of them had FCD Ib, three had FCD IIa, two had FCD IIIa, and one had FCD IIb; MRI features could not entirely distinguish between FCD subtypes. TLE patients showed more pronounced findings than ETLE on MRI (Ï 2 (1) = 11.95, p = 0.003, odds ratio [OR] 18.00). In all cases of FCD, isolated blurring was more likely to be associated with FCD II, whereas blurring with decreased myelination was seen with FCD I (Ï 2 (6) = 13.07, p = 0.042). Our study described associations between MRI characteristics and pathology in children with FCD and offered a detailed analysis of temporal lobe tip abnormalities and FCD subtypes in children with TLE. These findings may contribute to the\n\nFiber-probe optical spectroscopy discriminates normal brain from focal cortical dysplasia in pediatric subjects\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnand, Suresh; Cicchi, Riccardo; Giordano, Flavio; Conti, Valerio; Buccoliero, Anna Maria; Guerrini, Renzo; Pavone, Francesco S.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nFocal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is an abnormality in the cerebral cortex that is caused by malformations during cortical development. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electro-corticography (ECoG) are used for detecting FCD. On the downside, MRI is very much insensitive to small malformations in the brain, while ECoG is an invasive and time consuming procedure. Recently, optical techniques were widely exploited as a minimally invasive and quantitative approaches for disease diagnosis. These techniques include fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy. The aim of this investigation is to study the diagnostic performances of optical spectroscopy incorporating fluorescence (at 378 nm and 445 nm excitation wavelengths) and Raman spectroscopy (at 785 nm excitation) for the discrimination of FCD from normal brain in pediatric subjects. The study included 10 normal and 17 FCD tissue sites from 3 normal and 7 FCD samples. The emission spectra of FCD at 378 nm excitation wavelength presented a blue-shifted peak with respect to normal tissue. Prominent spectral differences between normal and FCD tissue were observed at 1298 cm-1, 1302 cm-1, 1445 cm-1 and 1660 cm-1 using Raman spectroscopy. Tissue classification models were developed using a multivariate statistical method, principal component analysis. This study demonstrates that a combined spectroscopic approach can provide a better diagnostic capability for classifying normal and FCD tissues. Further, the implementation of the technology within a fiber probe could open the way for in vivo diagnostics and intra-operative surgical guidance.\n\nRepeat surgery for focal cortical dysplasias in children: indications and outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nSacino, Matthew F; Ho, Cheng-Ying; Whitehead, Matthew T; Kao, Amy; Depositario-Cabacar, Dewi; Myseros, John S; Magge, Suresh N; Keating, Robert F; Gaillard, William D; Oluigbo, Chima O\n\n2017-02-01\n\nOBJECTIVE Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a common cause of medically intractable epilepsy that often may be treated by surgery. Following resection, many patients continue to experience seizures, necessitating a decision for further surgery to achieve the desired seizure outcomes. Few studies exist on the efficacy of reoperation for intractable epilepsy due to FCD in pediatric cohorts, including the definition of prognostic factors correlated with clinical benefit from further resection. METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed the medical records and MR images of 22 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent repeat FCD resection after unsuccessful first surgery at the Children's National Health System between March 2005 and April 2015. RESULTS Accounting for all reoperations, 13 (59%) of the 22 patients achieved complete seizure freedom and another 5 patients (23%) achieved significant improvement in seizure control. Univariate analysis demonstrated that concordance in electrocorticography (ECoG) and MRI localization (p = 0.005), and completeness of resection (p = 0.0001), were associated with seizure freedom after the first reoperation. Patients with discordant ECoG and MRI findings ultimately benefited from aggressive multilobe lobectomy or hemispherectomy. Repeat lesionectomies utilizing intraoperative MRI (iMRI; n = 9) achieved complete resection and seizure freedom in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Reoperation may be clinically beneficial in patients with intractable epilepsy due to FCD. Patients with concordant intraoperative ECoG and MRI localization may benefit from extended resection of residual dysplasia at the margins of the previous lesional cavity, and iMRI may offer benefits as a quality control mechanism to ensure that a complete resection has been accomplished. Patients with discordant findings may benefit from more aggressive resections at earlier stages to achieve better seizure control and ensure functional plasticity.\n\nSecond-hit mosaic mutation in mTORC1 repressor DEPDC5 causes focal cortical dysplasia-associated epilepsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nRibierre, ThÃ©o; Deleuze, Charlotte; Bacq, Alexandre; Baldassari, Sara; Marsan, Elise; Chipaux, Mathilde; Muraca, Giuseppe; Roussel, Delphine; Navarro, Vincent; Leguern, Eric; Miles, Richard; Baulac, StÃ©phanie\n\n2018-04-30\n\nDEP domain-containing 5 protein (DEPDC5) is a repressor of the recently recognized amino acid-sensing branch of the mTORC1 pathway. So far, its function in the brain remains largely unknown. Germline loss-of-function mutations in DEPDC5 have emerged as a major cause of familial refractory focal epilepsies, with case reports of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Remarkably, a fraction of patients also develop focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a neurodevelopmental cortical malformation. We therefore hypothesized that a somatic second-hit mutation arising during brain development may support the focal nature of the dysplasia. Here, using postoperative human tissue, we provide the proof of concept that a biallelic 2-hit - brain somatic and germline - mutational mechanism in DEPDC5 causes focal epilepsy with FCD. We discovered a mutation gradient with a higher rate of mosaicism in the seizure-onset zone than in the surrounding epileptogenic zone. Furthermore, we demonstrate the causality of a Depdc5 brain mosaic inactivation using CRISPR-Cas9 editing and in utero electroporation in a mouse model recapitulating focal epilepsy with FCD and SUDEP-like events. We further unveil a key role of Depdc5 in shaping dendrite and spine morphology of excitatory neurons. This study reveals promising therapeutic avenues for treating drug-resistant focal epilepsies with mTORC1-targeting molecules.\n\nCharacterization of focal cortical dysplasia with balloon cells by layer-specific markers: Evidence for differential vulnerability of interneurons.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakagawa, Julia M; Donkels, Catharina; Fauser, Susanne; Schulze-Bonhage, Andreas; Prinz, Marco; Zentner, Josef; Haas, Carola A\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFocal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a major cause of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. Little is known about the pathomechanisms underlying the characteristic cytoarchitectural abnormalities associated with FCD. In the present study, a broad panel of markers identifying layer-specific neuron subpopulations was applied to characterize dyslamination and structural alterations in FCD with balloon cells (FCD 2b). Pan-neuronal neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and layer-specific protein expression (Reelin, Calbindin, Calretinin, SMI32 (nonphosphorylated neurofilament H), Parvalbumin, transducin-like enhancer protein 4 (TLE4), and Vimentin) was studied by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of FCD2b cases (n = 22) and was compared to two control groups with (n = 7) or without epilepsy (n = 4 postmortem cases). Total and layer-specific neuron densities were systematically quantified by cell counting considering age at surgery and brain region. We show that in FCD2b total neuron densities across all six cortical layers were not significantly different from controls. In addition, we present evidence that a basic laminar arrangement of layer-specific neuron subtypes was preserved despite the severe disturbance of cortical structure. SMI32-positive pyramidal neurons showed no significant difference in total numbers, but a reduction in layers III and V. The densities of supragranular Calbindin- and Calretinin-positive interneurons in layers II and III were not different from controls, whereas Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, primarily located in layer IV, were significantly reduced in numbers when compared to control cases without epilepsy. In layer VI, the density of TLE4-positive projection neurons was significantly increased. Altogether, these data show that changes in cellular composition mainly affect deep cortical layers in FCD2b. The application of a broad panel of markers defining layer-specific neuronal subpopulations revealed that in FCD2b neuronal diversity and a basic\n\nIntraoperative MRI-guided resection of focal cortical dysplasia in pediatric patients: technique and outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nSacino, Matthew F; Ho, Cheng-Ying; Murnick, Jonathan; Tsuchida, Tammy; Magge, Suresh N; Keating, Robert F; Gaillard, William D; Oluigbo, Chima O\n\n2016-06-01\n\nOBJECTIVE Previous meta-analysis has demonstrated that the most important factor in seizure freedom following surgery for focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is completeness of resection. However, intraoperative detection of epileptogenic dysplastic cortical tissue remains a challenge, potentially leading to a partial resection and the need for reoperation. The objective of this study was to determine the role of intraoperative MRI (iMRI) in the intraoperative detection and localization of FCD as well as its impact on surgical decision making, completeness of resection, and seizure control outcomes. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of pediatric patients who underwent iMRI-assisted resection of FCD at the Children's National Health System between January 2014 and April 2015. Data reviewed included demographics, length of surgery, details of iMRI acquisition, postoperative seizure freedom, and complications. Postsurgical seizure outcome was assessed utilizing the Engel Epilepsy Surgery Outcome Scale. RESULTS Twelve consecutive pediatric patients (8 females and 4 males) underwent iMRI-guided resection of FCD lesions. The mean age at the time of surgery was 8.8 years Â± 1.6 years (range 0.7 to 18.8 years), and the mean duration of follow up was 3.5 months Â± 1.0 month. The mean age at seizure onset was 2.8 years Â± 1.0 year (range birth to 9.0 years). Two patients had Type 1 FCD, 5 patients had Type 2A FCD, 2 patients had Type 2B FCD, and 3 patients had FCD of undetermined classification. iMRI findings impacted intraoperative surgical decision making in 5 (42%) of the 12 patients, who then underwent further exploration of the resection cavity. At the time of the last postoperative follow-up, 11 (92%) of the 12 patients were seizure free (Engel Class I). No patients underwent reoperation following iMRI-guided surgery. CONCLUSIONS iMRI-guided resection of FCD in pediatric patients precluded the need for repeat surgery. Furthermore, it resulted\n\nProbing focal cortical dysplasia in formalin fixed samples using tissue optical spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnand, Suresh; Cicchi, Riccardo; Giordano, Flavio; Buccoliero, Anna Maria; Conti, Valerio; Guerrini, Renzo; Pavone, Francesco Saverio\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFocal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is one of most common causes of intractable epilepsy in pediatric population and these are often insensitive to anti-epileptic drugs. FCD is characterized by a disarray in localized regions of the cerebral cortex and abnormal neurons which results them to misfire with incorrect signals. Resective neurosurgery to remove or disconnect the affected parts from the rest of the brain seems to be a viable option to treat FCD. Before neurosurgery the subject could undergo imaging studies including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans. On the downside FCD could be elusive in MRI images and may be practically invisible in CT scans. Furthermore, unnecessary removal of normal tissues is to be taken into consideration as this could lead to neurological defects. In this context, optical spectroscopy have been widely investigated as an alternative technique for the detection of abnormal tissues in different organ sites. Disease progression is accompanied by a number of architectural, biochemical and morphological changes. These variations are reflected in the spectral intensity and line shape. Here, in this proof of concept study we propose to investigate the application of tissue optical spectroscopy based on fluorescence excitation at two wavelength 378 and 445 nm coupled along with Raman spectroscopy for the detection of FCD on formalin fixed tissue specimens from pediatric subjects. For fluorescence at both the excitation wavelengths FCD showed a decreased intensity at longer wavelength when compared to normal tissues. Also, differences exist in the Raman spectral profiles of normal and FCD.\n\nACTIVATION OF EXTRACELLULAR REGULATED KINASE AND MECHANISTIC TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN PATHWAY IN FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIA\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPatil, Vinit V.; Guzman, Miguel; Carter, Angela N.; Rathore, Geetanjali; Yoshor, Daniel; Curry, Daniel; Wilfong, Angus; Agadi, Satish; Swann, John W.; Adesina, Adekunle M.; Bhattacharjee, Meenakshi B.; Anderson, Anne E.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nNeuropathology of resected brain tissue has revealed an association of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). Recent studies have shown that the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is hyperactivated in FCD as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 (S6) at serine 240/244 (S240/244), a downstream target of mTOR. Moreover, extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) has been shown to phosphorylate S6 at serine 235/236 (S235/236) and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) at serine 664 (S664) leading to hyperactive mTOR signaling. We evaluated ERK phosphorylation of S6 and TSC2 in two types of FCD (FCD I and FCDII) as a candidate mechanism contributing to mTOR pathway dysregulation in this disorder. Tissue samples from patients with tuberous sclerosis (TS) served as a positive control. Immunostaining for phospho-S6 (pS6240/244 and pS6235/236), phospho-ERK (pERK), and phospho-TSC2 (pTSC2) was performed on resected brain tissue with FCD and TS. We found increased pS6240/244 and pS6235/236 staining in FCD I, FCD II, and TS compared to normal appearing tissue, while pERK and pTSC2 staining was increased only in FCD IIb and TS tissue. Our results suggest that both the ERK and mTOR pathways are dysregulated in FCD and TS; however, the signaling alterations are different for FCD I as compared to FCD II and TS.

Recent work with the rat freeze-induced focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) model has demonstrated that hyperexcitability in the dysplastic cortex is due in part to higher levels of extracellular glutamate. Astrocyte glutamate transporters play a pivotal role in cortical maintaining extracellular glutamate concentrations. Here we examined the function of astrocytic glutamate transporters in a FCD model in rats. Neocortical freeze lesions were made in postnatal day (PN) 1 rat pups and whole cell electrophysiological recordings and biochemical studies were performed at PN 21â28. Synaptically evoked glutamate transporter currents in astrocytes showed a near 10-fold reduction in amplitude compared to sham operated controls. Astrocyte glutamate transporter currents from lesioned animals were also significantly reduced when challenged exogenously applied glutamate. Reduced astrocytic glutamate transport clearance contributed to increased NMDA receptor-mediated current decay kinetics in lesioned animals. The electrophysiological profile of astrocytes in the lesion group was also markedly changed compared to sham operated animals. Control astrocytes demonstrate large-amplitude linear leak currents in response to voltage-steps whereas astrocytes in lesioned animals demonstrated significantly smaller voltage-activated inward and outward currents. Significant decreases in astrocyte resting membrane potential and increases in input resistance were observed in lesioned animals. However, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR demonstrated no differences in the expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter GLT-1 in lesioned animals relative to controls. These data suggest that, in the absence of changes in protein or mRNA expression levels, functional changes in astrocytic glutamate transporters contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability in the FCD model\n\nProton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in focal cortical dysplasia at 3T.\n\nPubMed\n\nTschampa, Henriette J; Urbach, Horst; TrÃ¤ber, Frank; Sprinkart, Alois M; Greschus, Susanne; Malter, Michael P; Surges, Rainer; Gieseke, JÃ¼rgen; Block, Wolfgang\n\n2015-11-01\n\nFocal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II is a frequent cause of medically intractable epilepsy. On conventional MRI diagnosis may be difficult. The purpose of our study was to assess the metabolic characteristics of MRI-typical or neuropathologically confirmed FCD II lesions at 3T. In a prospective study, 13 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and MRI diagnosis of FCD II (seven neuropathologically confirmed) were investigated by single-volume proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS). We performed an intra-individual comparison placing spectroscopic volumes of interest in the lesion and in the apparently normal contralateral hemisphere. Spectroscopic results were correlated with clinical data. Matched pair analysis revealed a significant increase in absolute choline (Cho) concentration in the lesion volume (+32%, p=0.015) compared to the control volume. This increase was associated with a significant decrease in N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) concentration (-13%; p=0.008). Mean myo-inositol (Ins) levels were distinctly (+36%) but not significantly (p=0.051) elevated. Lesional creatine (Cr) concentration correlated significantly with the frequency of seizures (Spearman-Rho r=0.898; p=0.002), while concentrations of NAA, Cho and Ins did not correlate with clinical or imaging parameters. MR spectroscopy revealed a characteristic metabolic pattern in FCD II lesions that helps to distinguish normal from epileptogenic tissue. Copyright Â© 2015 British Epilepsy Association.

A total of 22 patients with pharmacoresistant TLE were included in the study, 16 of them with histologically confirmed hippocampal sclerosis (HS) associated with neocortical temporal mild Palmini Type-I FCD subtypes and 6 with HS. Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings were analysed for epileptiform discharge frequency and morphology. Associations between histological, and electrocorticography pattern findings in these patients were analysed. Electroclinical outcomes in these patients were also evaluated. Neocortical areas with mild Palmini Type-I FCD showed a significantly higher spike frequency (SF) recorded in the inferior temporal gyrus than those neocortical areas in patients with HS. There was a tendency to higher spike frequency and lower amplitude in neocortical areas with histopathologic subtype IB FCD in relation with IA during intraoperative ECoG. Post-SF excision and amplitude were significantly lower during neocortical post-excision intraoperative ECoG than during neocortical pre-excision recording. There was no difference found in the clinical outcome between patients with and without FCD. Intraoperative electrocorticographic interictal spike frequency recorded in the neocortical inferior temporal gyrus may help to characterize the histopathologic subtypes of mild Palmini Type-I FCD in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and a dual pathology. Our data support the epileptogenicity of neocortical mild FCD in TLE and assessments of ECoG patterns are relevant to determine the extent of the resection in these patients which can influence the electroclinical outcome.\n\nDevelopmental tumors and adjacent cortical dysplasia: single or dual pathology?\n\nPubMed\n\nPalmini, AndrÃ©; Paglioli, Eliseu; Silva, Vinicius Duval\n\n2013-12-01\n\nDevelopmental tumors often lead to refractory partial seizures and constitute a well-defined, surgically remediable epilepsy syndrome. Dysplastic features are often associated with these tumors, and their significance carries both practical and conceptual relevance. If associated focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) relates to the extent of the epileptogenic tissue, then presurgical evaluation and surgical strategies should target both the tumor and the surrounding dyslaminated cortex. Furthermore, the association has been included in the recently revised classification of FCD and the epileptogenicity of this associated dysplastic tissue is crucial to validate such revision. In addition to the possibility of representing dual pathology, the association of developmental tumors and adjacent dysplasia may instead represent a single developmental lesion with distinct parts distributed along a histopathologic continuum. Moreover, the possibility that this adjacent dyslamination is of minor epileptogenic relevance should also be entertained. Surgical data show that complete resection of the solid tumors and immediately adjacent tissue harboring satellites may disrupt epileptogenic networks and lead to high rates of seizure freedom, challenging the epileptogenic relevance of more extensive adjacent dyslaminated cortex. Whether the latter is a primary or secondary abnormality and whether dyslaminated cortex in the context of a second lesion may produce seizures after complete resection of the main lesion is still to be proven.

Although surgical resection has been an important treatment for patients with refractory epilepsy associated with FCD, there are few studies on the surgical treatment of FCD accompanied by HS, and treatment by resection of both neocortical dysplastic tissue and hippocampus is still controversial. We retrospectively recruited epilepsy patients who had undergone surgical treatment for refractory epilepsy with the pathologic diagnosis of FCD and the radiologic evidence of HS. We evaluated the prognostic roles of clinical factors, various diagnostic modalities, surgical procedures, and the severity of pathology. A total of 40 patients were included, and only 35.0% of patients became seizure free. Complete resection of the epileptogenic area (p = 0.02), and the presence of dysmorphic neurons or balloon cells on histopathology (p = 0.01) were associated with favorable surgical outcomes. Patients who underwent hippocampal resection were more likely to have a favorable surgical outcome (p = 0.02). We show that patients with complete resection of epileptogenic area, the presence of dysmorphic neurons or balloon cells on histopathology, or resection of hippocampus have a higher chance of a favorable surgical outcome. We believe that this observation is useful in planning of surgical procedures and predicting the prognoses of individual patients with FCD patients accompanied by HS. Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We compared MRI-based cortical thickness and folding complexity between 2 frontal lobe epilepsy cohorts with histologically verified focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) (13 type I; 28 type II) and 41 closely matched controls. Pattern learning algorithms evaluated the utility of group-level findings to predict histologic FCD subtype, the side of the seizure focus, and postsurgical seizure outcome in single individuals. Relative to controls, FCD type I displayed multilobar cortical thinning that was most marked in ipsilateral frontal cortices. Conversely, type II showed thickening in temporal and postcentral cortices. Cortical folding also diverged, with increased complexity in prefrontal cortices in type I and decreases in type II. Group-level findings successfully guided automated FCD subtype classification (type I: 100%; type II: 96%), seizure focus lateralization (type I: 92%; type II: 86%), and outcome prediction (type I: 92%; type II: 82%). FCD subtypes relate to diverse whole-brain structural phenotypes. While cortical thickening in type II may indicate delayed pruning, a thin cortex in type I likely results from combined effects of seizure excitotoxicity and the primary malformation. Group-level patterns have a high translational value in guiding individualized diagnostics.

O. R.; Queiroz, Luciano; Cendes, Fernando\n\n2018-01-01\n\nObjective Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are an important cause of drugâresistant epilepsy. In this work, we aimed to investigate whether abnormal gene regulation, mediated by microRNA, could be involved in FCD type II. Methods We used total RNA from the brain tissue of 16 patients with FCD type II and 28 controls. MicroRNA expression was initially assessed by microarray. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, luciferase reporter assays, and deep sequencing for genes in the mTOR pathway were performed to validate and further explore our initial study. Results hsaâletâ7f (pâ=â0.039), hsaâmiRâ31 (pâ=â0.0078), and hsaâmiR34a (pâ=â0.021) were downregulated in FCD type II, whereas a transcription factor involved in neuronal and glial fate specification, NEUROG2 (pâ<â0.05), was upregulated. We also found that the RND2 gene, a NEUROG2âtarget, is upregulated (pâ<â0.001). In vitro experiments showed that hsaâmiRâ34a downregulates NEUROG2 by binding to its 5â²âuntranslated region. Moreover, we observed strong nuclear expression of NEUROG2 in balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons and found that 28.5% of our patients presented brain somatic mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway. Interpretation Our findings suggest a new molecular mechanism, in which NEUROG2 has a pivotal and central role in the pathogenesis of FCD type II. In this way, we found that the downregulation of hsaâmiRâ34a leads to upregulation of NEUROG2, and consequently to overexpression of the RND2 gene. These findings indicate that a faulty coupling in neuronal differentiation and migration mechanisms may explain the presence of aberrant cells and complete dyslamination in FCD type II.

They have also been described in the lateral temporal neocortex, although less frequently. The objective is to measure the presence, distribution and density of CoA in the lateral temporal lobes of patients with DRTLE and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), also examining how CoA density may be linked to demographic and clinical traits. Resected tissue from 35 patients was analysed. CoA density was assessed with a semi-quantitative scale according to the criteria established by Cherian et al. Presence of CoA in the neocortex of 9 patients was associated with hippocampal sclerosis (FCD type iiia, 7 cases), disembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour (FCD type iiib, 1 case), and cavernous angioma (FCD type iiic, 1 case). The meningeal surface (MS) was involved in all cases, and 8 cases displayed CoA in the cerebral parenchyma (white matter) and around blood vessels. CoA density on the MS showed a negative correlation with age at seizure onset (r = -0.828, P<.05) and a positive correlation with disease duration (r = 0.678, P<.05) but not with postoperative clinical outcome. Patients with DRTLE and a primary lesion (hippocampal sclerosis, tumour, vascular malformation) associated with mild FCD were shown to have CoA deposits in the neocortex. No association was found between presence of CoA and clinical outcome one year after surgery. Copyright Â© 2013 Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de NeurologÃ­a. Published by Elsevier Espana.

However, seizure control outcomes reported in isolated surgical series are highly variable. As a result, it is not clear which variables are most crucial in predicting seizure freedom following surgery for FCD. The authors' aim was to determine the prognostic factors for seizure control in FCD by performing a meta-analysis of the published literature. A MEDLINE search of the published literature yielded 37 studies that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seven potential prognostic variables were determined from these studies and were dichotomized for analysis. For each variable, individual studies were weighted by inverse variance and combined to generate an odds ratio favoring seizure freedom. The methods complied with a standardized meta-analysis reporting protocol. Two thousand fourteen patients were included in the analysis. The overall rate of seizure freedom (Engel Class I) among patients undergoing surgery for FCD in the cohort of studies was 55.8% Â± 16.2%. Partial seizures, a temporal location, detection with MRI, and a Type II Palmini histological classification were associated with higher rates of postoperative seizure control. As a treatment-related factor, complete resection of the anatomical or electrographic abnormality was the most important predictor overall of seizure freedom. Neither age nor electroencephalographic localization of the ictal onset significantly affected seizure freedom after surgery. Using a large population cohort pooled from the published literature, an analysis identified important factors that are prognostic in patients with epilepsy due to FCD. The most important of these factors-diagnostic imaging and resection-provide modalities through which improvements in the impact of FCD can be effected.\n\nClinical characteristics in focal cortical dysplasia: a retrospective evaluation in a series of 120 patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nFauser, Susanne; Huppertz, Hans-Juergen; Bast, Thomas; Strobl, Karl; Pantazis, Georgios; Altenmueller, Dirk-Matthias; Feil, Bertram; Rona, Sabine; Kurth, Christoph; Rating, Dietz; Korinthenberg, Rudolf; Steinhoff, Bernhard J; Volk, Benedikt; Schulze-Bonhage, Andreas\n\n2006-07-01\n\nFocal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are increasingly diagnosed as a cause of symptomatic focal epilepsy in paediatric and adult patients. However, little is known about the clinical characteristics of epilepsy in these patients. In order to elucidate the clinical characteristics of their epilepsy, 120 pharmacoresistant patients including children and adults with histologically proven FCD were studied retrospectively. Age at seizure onset was analysed in the total group and compared between subgroups with different localization and different histological subtypes of FCD. The role of febrile seizures with respect to dual pathology was investigated. Seizure semiology was analysed focusing on initial seizure type and change of seizure semiology during the course of disease. Finally, transient responsiveness to antiepileptic drug therapy was studied. In the majority of patients, epilepsy began in the first 5 years of life. However, onset of epilepsy could also occur in the second or third decade until the age of 60. Age at epilepsy onset was not significantly different between temporal, extratemporal and multilobar localization of FCD. Patients without cytoarchitectural abnormalities (mild malformations of cortical development, FCD 1a according to Palmini) had significantly later epilepsy onset (P= 0.001) compared with patients with cytoarchitectural abnormalities (FCD 1b, 2a and 2b according to Palmini). In patients with additional hippocampal sclerosis (dual pathology) febrile seizures were significantly more frequently reported (P = 0.02) than in patients without dual pathology. Moreover, patients with dual pathology and febrile seizures significantly more frequently presented with severe hippocampal sclerosis (Wyler Grade 3-4) as compared with patients with dual pathology in the absence of febrile seizures (P = 0.03). First observed seizures were mainly tonic or generalized tonic-clonic.

It also raises important pathophysiologic issues concerning mechanisms of seizure generation. Until now, several seizure-onset patterns have been described using distinct recording methods (subdural, depth electrode), mostly in temporal lobe epilepsies or with heterogeneous neocortical lesions. We analyzed data from a cohort of 53 consecutive patients explored by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and with pathologically confirmed malformation of cortical development (MCD; including focal cortical dysplasia [FCD] and neurodevelopmental tumors [NDTs]). We identified six seizure-onset patterns using visual and time-frequency analysis: low-voltage fast activity (LVFA); preictal spiking followed by LVFA; burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA; slow wave/DC shift followed by LVFA; theta/alpha sharp waves; and rhythmic spikes/spike-waves. We found a high prevalence of patterns that included LVFA (83%), indicating nevertheless that LVFA is not a constant characteristic of seizure onset. An association between seizure-onset patterns and histologic types was found (p = 001). The more prevalent patterns were as follows: (1) in FCD type I LVFA (23.1%) and slow wave/baseline shift followed by LVFA (15.4%); (2) in FCD type II burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA (31%), LVFA (27.6%), and preictal spiking followed by LVFA (27.6%); (3) in NDT, LVFA (54.5%). We found that a seizure-onset pattern that included LVFA was associated with favorable postsurgical outcome, but the completeness of the EZ resection was the sole independent predictive variable. Six different seizure-onset patterns can be described in FCD and NDT. Better postsurgical outcome is associated with patterns that incorporate LVFA. Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This may not be evident on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), so intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG) is needed to delineate the seizure onset zone (SOZ). EEG-functional MRI (fMRI) can reveal interictal discharge (IED)-related hemodynamic changes in the irritative zone (IZ). We assessed the value of EEG-fMRI in patients with FCD-associated focal epilepsy by examining the relationship between IED-related hemodynamic changes, icEEG findings, and postoperative outcome. Methods Twenty-three patients with FCD-associated focal epilepsy undergoing presurgical evaluation including icEEG underwent simultaneous EEG-fMRI at 3T. IED-related hemodynamic changes were modeled, and results were overlaid on coregistered T1-weighted MRI scans fused with computed tomography scans showing the intracranial electrodes. IED-related hemodynamic changes were compared with the SOZ on icEEG and postoperative outcome at 1 year. Results Twelve of 23 patients had IEDs during recording, and 11 of 12 had significant IED-related hemodynamic changes. The fMRI results were concordant with the SOZ in 5 of 11 patients, all of whom had a solitary SOZ on icEEG. Four of 5 had >50% reduction in seizure frequency following resective surgery. The remaining 6 of 11 patients had widespread or discordant regions of IED-related fMRI signal change. Five of 6 had either a poor surgical outcome (<50% reduction in seizure frequency) or widespread SOZ precluding surgery. Interpretation Comparison of EEG-fMRI with icEEG suggests that EEG-fMRI may provide useful additional information about the SOZ in FCD. Widely distributed discordant regions of IED-related hemodynamic change appear to be associated with a widespread SOZ and poor postsurgical outcome.

In particular, extratemporal FCD Type IIA and IIB is not completely understood in terms of clinical, imaging, biological, and neuropathological differences. The aim of the authors was to analyze distinctions between these 2 formal entities and address clinical, MRI, and immunohistochemical features of extratemporal epilepsies in children. METHODS Cases formerly classified as Palmini FCD Type II nontemporal epilepsies were identified through the prospectively maintained epilepsy database at the British Columbia Children's Hospital in Vancouver, Canada. Clinical data, including age of seizure onset, age at surgery, seizure type(s) and frequency, affected brain region(s), intraoperative electrocorticographic findings, and outcome defined by Engel's classification were obtained for each patient. Preoperative and postoperative MRI results were reevaluated. H & E-stained tissue sections were reevaluated by using the 2011 International League Against Epilepsy classification system and additional immunostaining for standard cellular markers (neuronal nuclei, neurofilament, glial fibrillary acidic protein, CD68). Two additional established markers of pathology in epilepsy resection, namely, CD34 and Î±-B crystallin, were applied. RESULTS Seven nontemporal FCD Type IIA and 7 Type B cases were included. Patients with FCD Type IIA presented with an earlier age of epilepsy onset and slightly better Engel outcome. Radiology distinguished FCD Types IIA and IIB, in that Type IIB presented more frequently with characteristic cortical alterations. Nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein staining confirmed dysplastic cells in dyslaminated areas. The white-gray matter junction was focally blurred in patients with FCD Type IIB. Î±-B crystallin highlighted glial cells in the white matter and subpial layer with either of the 2 FCD Type II subtypes\n\nVoxel-based automated detection of focal cortical dysplasia lesions using diffusion tensor imaging and T2-weighted MRI data.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yanming; Zhou, Yawen; Wang, Huijuan; Cui, Jin; Nguchu, Benedictor Alexander; Zhang, Xufei; Qiu, Bensheng; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Zhu, Mingwang\n\n2018-05-21\n\nThe aim of this study was to automatically detect focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) lesions in patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy by relying on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We implemented an automated classifier using voxel-based multimodal features to identify gray and white matter abnormalities of FCD in patient cohorts. In addition to the commonly used T2-weighted image intensity feature, DTI-based features were also utilized. A Gaussian processes for machine learning (GPML) classifier was tested on 12 patients with FCD (8 with histologically confirmed FCD) scanned at 1.5â¯T and cross-validated using a leave-one-out strategy. Moreover, we compared the multimodal GPML paradigm's performance with that of single modal GPML and classical support vector machine (SVM). Our results demonstrated that the GPML performance on DTI-based features (mean AUCâ¯=â¯0.63) matches with the GPML performance on T2-weighted image intensity feature (mean AUCâ¯=â¯0.64). More promisingly, GPML yielded significantly improved performance (mean AUCâ¯=â¯0.76) when applying DTI-based features to multimodal paradigm. Based on the results, it can also be clearly stated that the proposed GPML strategy performed better and is robust to unbalanced dataset contrary to SVM that performed poorly (AUCâ¯=â¯0.69). Therefore, the GPML paradigm using multimodal MRI data containing DTI modality has promising result towards detection of the FCD lesions and provides an effective direction for future researches.

We investigated the options of using neuronavigation and intraoperative magnetic-resonance tomographical imaging (MRI) to avoid residual epileptogenic tissue during resection of patients with FCD II to improve seizure outcome. Altogether, 24 patients with FCD II diagnosed by MRI (16 female, 8 male; mean age 34 Â± 10 years) suffered from drug-resistant electroclinical and focal epilepsy for a mean of 20.7 Â± 5 years. Surgery was performed with preoperative stereoelectroencephalography (in 15 patients), neuronavigation, and intraoperative 1.5T-iopMRI in all 24 investigated patients. In 75% of patients (18/24), a complete resection was performed. In 89% (16/18) of completely resected patients, we documented an Engel I seizure outcome after a mean follow-up of 42 months. All incompletely resected patients had a worse outcome (Engel II-III, P < 0.0002). Patients with FCD IIB had also significant better seizure outcome compared with patients diagnosed as having FCD IIA (82% vs. 28%, P < 0.02). In 46% (11/24) of patients, intraoperative second-look surgeries due to residual lesions detected during the intraoperative MRI were performed. In these 11 patients, there were significant more completely seizure free patients (73% vs. 38% Engel IA), compared with 13 patients who finished surgery after the first intraoperative MRI (P < 0.05). Excellent seizure outcome after surgery of patients with FCD II positively correlated with the amount of resection, histologic subtype, and the use of intraoperative MRI, especially when intraoperative second-look surgeries were performed.

The pathogenesis of FCDs has not yet been clearly established, although a number of histopathological patterns and molecular findings suggest that they may be due to abnormal neuronal and glial proliferation and migration processes. In order to gain further insights into cortical layering disruption and investigate the origin of DNs and BCs, we used in situ RNA hybridisation of human surgical specimens with a neuropathologically definite diagnosis of Type IIa/b FCD and a panel of layer-specific genes (LSGs) whose expression covers all cortical layers. We also used anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein antibody to investigate mTOR pathway hyperactivation. Results LSGs were expressed in both normal and abnormal cells (BCs and DNs) but their distribution was different. Normal-looking neurons, which were visibly reduced in the core of the lesion, were apparently located in the appropriate cortical laminae thus indicating a partial laminar organisation. On the contrary, DNs and BCs, labelled with anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein antibody, were spread throughout the cortex without any apparent rule and showed a highly variable LSG expression pattern. Moreover, LSGs did not reveal any differences between Type IIa and IIb FCD. Conclusion These findings suggest the existence of hidden cortical lamination involving normal-looking neurons, which retain their ability to migrate correctly in the cortex, unlike DNs which, in addition to their morphological abnormalities and mTOR hyperactivation, show an altered migratory pattern. Taken together these data suggest that an external or environmental hit affecting selected precursor cells during the very early stages of cortical development may disrupt normal cortical development.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) postprocessing methods may provide essential help for detection of FCD. In this study, we utilized surface-based MRI morphometry and machine learning for automated lesion detection in a mixed cohort of patients with FCD type II from 3 different epilepsy centers. Sixty-one patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy and histologically proven FCD type II were included in the study. The patients had been evaluated at 3 different epilepsy centers using 3 different MRI scanners. T1-volumetric sequence was used for postprocessing. A normal database was constructed with 120 healthy controls. We also included 35 healthy test controls and 15 disease test controls with histologically confirmed hippocampal sclerosis to assess specificity. Features were calculated and incorporated into a nonlinear neural network classifier, which was trained to identify lesional cluster. We optimized the threshold of the output probability map from the classifier by performing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Success of detection was defined by overlap between the final cluster and the manual labeling. Performance was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. The threshold of 0.9 showed optimal sensitivity of 73.7% and specificity of 90.0%. The area under the curve for the ROC analysis was 0.75, which suggests a discriminative classifier. Sensitivity and specificity were not significantly different for patients from different centers, suggesting robustness of performance.

Several distinct histological patterns have been historically recognized in both HS and FCD, and several studies have tried to perform clinicopathological correlation; results, however, have been controversial, particularly in terms of postsurgical seizure outcome. Recently, the International League Against Epilepsy constituted a Task Forces of Neuropathology and FCD within the Commission on Diagnostic Methods, to establish an international consensus of histological classification of HS and FCD, respectively, based on agreement with the recognition of the importance of defining a histopathological classification system that reliably has some clinicopathological correlation. Such consensus classifications are likely to facilitate future clinicopathological study. Meanwhile, we reviewed neuropathology of 41 surgical cases of mTLE, and confirmed three type/patterns of HS along with no HS, based on the qualitative evaluation of the distribution and severity of neuronal loss and gliosis within hippocampal formation; i.e., HS type 1 (61%) equivalent to âclassicalâ Ammonâs horn sclerosis, HS type 2 (2%) representing CA1 sclerosis, HS type 3 (17%) equivalent to end folium sclerosis, and no HS (19%). Furthermore we performed a neuropathological comparative study on mTLE-HS and dementia associated HS (d-HS) in elderly, and confirmed that neuropathological features differ between mTLE-HS and d-HS in the distribution of hippocampal neuronal loss and gliosis, morphology of reactive astrocytes and their protein expression, and presence of concomitant neurodegenerative changes particularly Alzheimer type and TDP-43 pathologies.

The aim of our study was to evaluate an isotropic high-resolution 3-dimensional Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence (3D FLAIR) at 3T in comparison to standard 2D FLAIR in the diagnosis of FCD. In a prospective study, 19 epilepsy patients with the MR diagnosis of FCD were examined with a sagittal 3D FLAIR sequence with modulated refocusing flip angle (slice thickness 1.10mm) and a 2D FLAIR in the coronal (thk. 3mm) and axial planes (thk. 2mm). Manually placed regions of interest were used for quantitative analysis. Qualitative image analysis was performed by two neuroradiologists in consensus. Contrast between gray and white matter (p â¤ 0.02), the lesion (p â¤ 0.031) or hyperintense extension to the ventricle (p â¤ 0.021) and white matter was significantly higher in 2D than in 3D FLAIR sequences. In the visual analysis there was no difference between 2D and 3D sequences. Conventional 2D FLAIR sequences yield a higher image contrast compared to the employed 3D FLAIR sequence in patients with FCDs. Potential advantages of 3D imaging using surface rendering or automated techniques for lesion detection have to be further elucidated. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods and subjects: Analysis of histories and presurgical and follow up data was carried out in 53 patients with a histological diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia. Their mean age was 24.0 years (range 5 to 46), and they included 14 children and adolescents. Mean age at seizure onset was 12.4 years (0.4 to 36) and mean seizure duration was 11.6 years (1 to 45). Results: The presurgical detection rate of focal cortical dysplasia with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was 96%. There were 24 temporal and 29 extratemporal resections; additional multiple subpial transections were done in 12 cases to prevent spread of seizure discharges. There was a 6% rate of complications with permanent neurological deficit, but no deaths. All resected specimens were classified by neuropathological criteria as focal cortical dysplasia. Balloon cells were seen in most cases of extratemporal focal cortical dysplasia. After a mean follow up of 50 months, 38 patients (72%) were seizure-free, two (4%) had less than two seizures a year, nine (17%) had a reduction of seizure frequency of more than 75%, and four (8%) had no improvement. Seizure outcome was similar after temporal and extratemporal surgery. The patients in need of multilobar surgery had the poorest outcome. Conclusions: Circumscribed lesionectomy of focal dysplastic lesions provides seizure relief in patients with chronic drug resistant temporal and extratemporal epilepsy. There was a trend for the best seizure outcome to be in patients with early presurgical evaluation and early surgery, and in whom lesions were identified on the preoperative MRI studies.

The aim of this study was to determine whether (11)C-methionine PET, compared with (18)F-FDG PET, was useful for the evaluation of these diseases. The clinical and imaging data of 30 pediatric lesional epilepsy patients pathologically diagnosed with FCD, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT), or ganglioglioma were reviewed. Eleven patients had FCD, 8 patients had a DNT, and 11 patients had a ganglioglioma. (18)F-FDG and (11)C-methinine PET scans were obtained from 25 patients and 15 patients, respectively. Visual grading analysis and quantitative assessment of (18)F-FDG and (11)C-methionine PET, represented as a lesion-to-gray matter ratio (LGR), were performed. In the visual grading analysis, both (18)F-FDG PET and (11)C-methionine PET detected a significant difference among the 3 disease groups (P = 0.033 and P = 0.016, respectively), but discrimination of FCD from mixed neuronal and glial tumors was possible only with (11)C-methionine PET. The mean LGR of (18)F-FDG PET was 0.502 +/- 0.119 for FCD, 0.631 +/- 0.107 for DNTs, and 0.620 +/- 0.196 for gangliogliomas; there was no significant difference in LGR among the groups (P = 0.111). However, the mean LGR of (11)C-methionine PET was 1.078 +/- 0.182 for FCD, 1.564 +/- 0.368 for DNT, and 2.114 +/- 0.723 for gangliogliomas; there was a significant difference in LGR among the groups (P = 0.014). Post hoc analysis revealed that the LGR of FCD was significantly different from that of DNTs and gangliogliomas. The mean LGR value of DNTs fell between those of FCD and gangliogliomas. Although (18)F-FDG plays a major role in the preoperative work-up of epilepsy surgery patients, it appears from this study that (18)F-FDG does not contribute to the differential diagnosis and that another tracer such as (11)C\n\nAnalysis of Altered Micro RNA Expression Profiles in Focal Cortical Dysplasia IIB.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Lin; Liu, Chang-Qing; Li, Tian-Fu; Guan, Yu-Guang; Zhou, Jian; Qi, Xue-Ling; Yang, Yu-Tao; Deng, Jia-Hui; Xu, Zhi-Qing David; Luan, Guo-Ming\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFocal cortical dysplasia type IIB is a commonly encountered subtype of developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex and is often associated with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. In this study, to investigate the molecular etiology of focal cortical dysplasia type IIB, the authors performed micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) microarray on surgical specimens from 5 children (2 female and 3 male, mean age was 73.4 months, range 50-112 months) diagnosed of focal cortical dysplasia type IIB and matched normal tissue adjacent to the lesion. In all, 24 micro RNAs were differentially expressed in focal cortical dysplasia type IIB, and the microarray results were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then the putative target genes of the differentially expressed micro RNAs were identified by bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, biological significance of the target genes was evaluated by investigating the pathways in which the genes were enriched, and the Hippo signaling pathway was proposed to be highly related with the pathogenesis of focal cortical dysplasia type IIB.

Cases of adult-onset Rasmussen have also been described, but the clinical picture is less defined, rendering final diagnosis difficult. We present a case of adult-onset Rasmussen encephalitis with dual pathology, associated with focal cortical dysplasia and encephalitis. We interpreted the Rasmussen encephalitis to be caused by severe and continuous epileptic activity due to focal cortical dysplasia. The best therapeutic approach for such cases remains unclear.\n\nHistological Characterization of the Irritative Zones in Focal Cortical Dysplasia Using a Preclinical Rat Model.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeshmukh, Abhay; Leichner, Jared; Bae, Jihye; Song, Yinchen; ValdÃ©s-HernÃ¡ndez, Pedro A; Lin, Wei-Chiang; Riera, Jorge J\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCurrent clinical practice in focal epilepsy involves brain source imaging (BSI) to localize brain areas where from interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) emerge. These areas, named irritative zones , have been useful to define candidate seizures-onset zones during pre-surgical workup. Since human histological data are mostly available from final resected zones, systematic studies characterizing pathophysiological mechanisms and abnormal molecular/cellular substrates in irritative zones-independent of them being epileptogenic-are challenging. Combining BSI and histological analysis from all types of irritative zones is only possible through the use of preclinical animal models. Here, we recorded 32-channel spontaneous electroencephalographic data from rats that have focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and chronic seizures. BSI for different IED subtypes was performed using the methodology presented in Bae et al. (2015). Post-mortem brain sections containing irritative zones were stained to quantify anatomical, functional, and inflammatory biomarkers specific for epileptogenesis, and the results were compared with those obtained using the contralateral healthy brain tissue. We found abnormal anatomical structures in all irritative zones (i.e., larger neuronal processes, glioreactivity, and vascular cuffing) and larger expressions for neurotransmission (i.e., NR2B) and inflammation (i.e., ILÎ²1, TNFÎ± and HMGB1). We conclude that irritative zones in this rat preclinical model of FCD comprise abnormal tissues disregarding whether they are actually involved in icto-genesis or not. We hypothesize that seizure perpetuation happens gradually; hence, our results could support the use of IED-based BSI for the early diagnosis and preventive treatment of potential epileptic foci.

Special focus was set on the newly introduced International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). This is a single center retrospective cross-sectional analysis of prospectively collected data. age at surgery <18 years, pre-surgical evaluation and epilepsy surgery performed at the Vienna pediatric epilepsy center, histologically proven MCD, complete follow-up data for at least 12 months. Clinical variables evaluated: type and localization of MCD, type of surgery and a variety of clinical characteristics reported to be associated with (un-)favorable outcomes. MCD were classified following the existing classification schemes (Barkovich et al., 2012. Brain. 135, 1348-1369; Palmini et al., 2004. Neurology. 62, S2-S8) and the ILAE classification for FCD recently proposed by BlÃ¼mcke in 2011. Seizure outcome was classified using the ILAE classification proposed by Wieser in 2001. 60 Patients (51.7% male) were included. Follow up was up to 14 (mean 4.4 Â± 3.2) years. Mean age at surgery was 8.0 Â± 6.0 (median 6.0) years; mean age at epilepsy onset was 2.9 Â± 3.2 (median 2.0) years; duration of epilepsy before surgery was 4.8 Â± 4.4 (median 3.0) years. 80% of the patients were seizure free at last follow-up. AEDs were successfully withdrawn in 56.7% of all patients. Extended surgery, lesion localization in the temporal lobes and absence of inter-ictal spikes in postsurgical EEG recordings were predictive of favorable seizure outcomes after surgery. However, no association was found between outcome and MCD sub-types. Epilepsy surgery is highly effective in carefully selected drug-resistant children with MCD.

We retrospectively selected 14 MRI-negative patients with FCD from a cohort of 60 pediatric patients previously used to evaluate the diagnostic utility of 3D-ESI in epilepsy surgery. Patients were younger than 18Â years at time of surgery and had at least 1Â year of outcome data. RD and MD models were constructed for each interictal spike or sharp wave, and it was determined whether each inverse algorithm localized within the surgical resection cavity (SRC). We also compared the 3D-ESI findings and surgical outcome with positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal single photon emission computed tomography (iSPECT). RD analyses revealed a high concordance with the SRC (78.6%), particularly for temporal lobe resection (100.0%), and showed superior localization compared to PET and iSPECT, with the highest correlation in FCD type I and temporal lobe resection. Furthermore, the RD method was superior to iSPECT in FCD type II cases and to PET in extratemporal resections. RD and MD results were comparable, but in 18.2% of patients with FCD type I with localizing RDs, the MD solution was only partially within the SRC; in all of these patients 3D-ESI also correlated with superior surgical outcome compared to PET and iSPECT, especially when RD and MD solutions were analyzed together. 3D-ESI in MRI-negative cases showed superior localization compared to iSPECT or PET, especially in FCD type I and temporal lobe epilepsy, and correlated with superior surgical outcome compared to iSPECT and PET at 1 year and 2Â years postoperatively, especially when RD and MD solutions were analyzed together. These findings suggest that 3D-ESI based on a combined RD-MD solution improves surgical accuracy in\n\nFrequency domain beamforming of magnetoencephalographic beta band activity in epilepsy patients with focal cortical dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeers, Marcel; Hirschmann, Jan; Jacobs, Julia; DÃ¼mpelmann, Matthias; Butz, Markus; von Lehe, Marec; Elger, Christian E; Schnitzler, Alfons; Wellmer, JÃ¶rg\n\n2014-09-01\n\nSpike-based magnetoencephalography (MEG) source localization is an established method in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy patients. Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are associated with focal epileptic discharges of variable morphologies in the beta frequency band in addition to single epileptic spikes. Therefore, we investigated the potential diagnostic value of MEG-based localization of spike-independent beta band (12-30Hz) activity generated by epileptogenic lesions. Five patients with FCD IIB underwent MEG. In one patient, invasive EEG (iEEG) was recorded simultaneously with MEG. In two patients, iEEG succeeded MEG, and two patients had MEG only. MEG and iEEG were evaluated for epileptic spikes. Two minutes of iEEG data and MEG epochs with no spikes as well as MEG epochs with epileptic spikes were analyzed in the frequency domain. MEG oscillatory beta band activity was localized using Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources. Intralesional beta band activity was coherent between simultaneous MEG and iEEG recordings. Continuous 14Hz beta band power correlated with the rate of interictal epileptic discharges detected in iEEG. In cases where visual MEG evaluation revealed epileptic spikes, the sources of beta band activity localized within <2cm of the epileptogenic lesion as shown on magnetic resonance imaging. This result held even when visually marked epileptic spikes were deselected. When epileptic spikes were detectable in iEEG but not MEG, MEG beta band activity source localization failed. Source localization of beta band activity has the potential to contribute to the identification of epileptic foci in addition to source localization of visually marked epileptic spikes. Thus, this technique may assist in the localization of epileptic foci in patients with suspected FCD. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our study comprises a consecutive series of 458 patients who underwent surgical treatment for intractable mTLE at the Epilepsy Center Freiburg. Data evaluated included semiology, duration and frequency of seizures, results of presurgical diagnostics including video-EEG monitoring, MRI, PET and SPECT as well as postoperative seizure outcome. Results were evaluated forming two groups: Group A consisted of isolated mesiotemporal lesions. Group B comprised patients with mTLE and additional focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Statistical evaluation was based on the Kaplan Meier survival analysis, using log-rank-tests and a multivariate regression model. Postoperative running down phenomenon was defined as seizure freedom after a period of gradual reduction of postoperative seizure frequency. This was compared to patients with ongoing epilepsy. Complete seizure freedom was achieved in 65.0% of investigated patients at 1year and in 56.5% at long-term follow-up of â¥5 years after surgery. Corresponding results were 64.2% and 56.8% at 1 and â¥5 years, respectively in group A and 66.4% and 56.0%, respectively in group B. Predictive for favorable postoperative outcome in the total group were younger age at surgery, shorter duration of epilepsy, absence of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (SGTCS), presence of strictly ipsilateral temporal interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), complete resection of the lesion as well as absence of postoperative epileptiform activity and of early postoperative seizures.

Among 108 patients with histopathologically confirmed FCD operated between 1985 and 2008, we selected 17 patients with epilepsy onset up to 3 years of age. Development was evaluated by the developmental quotient or intelligence quotient (DQ-IQ) and mental age was measured by the Mother-Child Counseling baby test or the Tanaka-Binet scale of intelligence. Postsurgical development outcome was evaluated by the changes in DQ-IQ and mental age as well as rate of increase in mental age (RIMA) after surgery. RIMA was calculated as the increase in mental age per chronological year (months/year; normal average rate: 12 months/year). Age at epilepsy onset of 17 patients ranged from 15 days to 36 months (meanÂ±SD, 11.0Â±10.0 months). Age at surgery ranged from 18 to 145 months (75.1Â±32.4 months). Evaluation just before surgery showed that 13 of 17 (76.4%) patients had DQ-IQ below 70. Ten patients (58.8%) were seizure-free throughout the postsurgical follow-up period. After surgery, DQ-IQ was maintained within 10 points of the presurgical level in 13 patients (76.4%), and increased by more than 10 points in one patient (5.9%). After surgery, RIMA in patients with Engel's class I (7.5Â±3.8) was higher than patients with Engel's class II-IV (2.6Â±3.4) (unpaired t-test with Welch's correction, t=2.99, df=15, p=0.0092). RIMA was particularly low in two patients with spasm. In four patients with presurgical DQ-IQ<70, seizure-free after surgery and without spasm, DQ-IQ did not increase but RIMA improved from 3.6Â±2.8 before surgery to 6.9Â±2.5 months/year after surgery. RIMA became better from 2 years after surgery. In four patients with presurgical DQ-IQâ¥70 and no spasm, two showed the same or higher RIMA than normal average after surgery.

Although, at present, advanced imaging modalities are capable of detecting most cortical disorders, it is still a challenge for the surgeon to visualize them intraoperatively. The lack of direct identification between normal brain and subtle dysplastic tissue may explain the poor results in terms of being seizure-free versus other forms of epilepsy. The aim of this study is to compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intraoperative ultrasound-guided neuronavigation, along with cortical stimulation and acute electrocorticography, as a multimodal surgical approach to cortical dysplasia's tailored resection. Six consecutive patients with type II cortical dysplasia underwent epilepsy surgery by means of MRI/intraoperative ultrasound-guided neuronavigation. Intraoperative cortical stimulation of sensory/motor cortex was performed to localize cortical eloquent areas. Acute electrocorticography was used to identify epileptogenic tissue. These findings were correlated to real-time ultrasound imaging to establish the extent of the resection. Intraoperative ultrasound depicted cortical dysplasias at a higher resolution and accuracy than MRI. Therefore it maximized the extent of the resection. Both postoperative MRIs and pathology documented the extent of the resection in all patients. Seizure-freedom was achieved in 5 cases (Engel class IA), and in 1 patient it was classified as Engel class IB. No postoperative neurological deficits were observed. These results strongly suggest feasibility of ultrasound-guided resection of focal cortical dysplasia. Providing high resolution and accuracy, it allows an easy, real-time discrimination between normal and dysplastic brain. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Surgical removal is frequently the best treatment option for pharmacoresistant epilepsy. However, subtle FCDs may remain undetected even after high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Morphometric MRI analysis, which compares the individual brain with a normal database, can facilitate the detection of FCDs. We describe how the results of normal database-based MRI postprocessing can be used to guide stereotactic electrode implantation and subsequent resection of lesions that are suspected to be FCDs. A presurgical evaluation was conducted on a 19-year-old woman with pharmacoresistant hypermotor seizures. Conventional high-resolution MRI was classified as negative for epileptogenic lesions. However, morphometric analysis of the spatially normalized MRI revealed abnormal gyration and blurring of the gray-white matter junction, which was suggestive of a small and deeply seated FCD in the left frontal lobe. The brain region highlighted by morphometric analysis was marked as a region of interest, transferred back to the original dimension of the individual MRI, and imported into a neuronavigation system. This allowed the region of interest-targeted stereotactic implantation of 2 depth electrodes, by which seizure onset was confirmed in the lesion. The electrodes also guided the final resection, which rendered the patient seizure-free. The lesion was histologically classified as FCD Palmini and LÃ¼ders IIB. Transferring normal database-based MRI postprocessing results into a neuronavigation system is a new and worthwhile extension of multimodal neuronavigation. The combination of resulting regions of interest with functional and anatomic data may facilitate planning of electrode implantation for invasive electroencephalographic recordings and the final resection of small or deeply seated FCDs.\n\nCategorizing Cortical Dysplasia Lesions for Surgical Outcome Using Network Functional Connectivity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBdaiwi, Abdullah Sarray\n\nLesion-symptom mapping is a powerful and broadly applicable approach that is used for linking neurological symptoms to specific brain regions.
