Objective: To determine the prescription patterns of somatostatin analogues in patients affiliated with the Health System of Colombia. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients of any age and sex treated with octreotide or lanreotide between January 2011 and August 2015. Socio-demographic, clinical (indications) and pharmacological (comedications) variables were considered. Multivariate analysis was performed with SPSS 23.0. Results: We identified 289 patients, with a mean age of 56.6âÂ±â14.0âyears and female predominance (59.5%), who underwent treatment during the 56âmonths of monitoring. Octreotide was used in 56.1% of cases, followed by lanreotide (43.9%), both at approved doses. We found that 4.5% of subjects changed from one drug to another over the course of therapy, which was associated with being diabetic and receiving insulin (odds ratio: 4.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.23â14.84; pâ=â0.014). The most common indications were acromegaly (52.2% of cases) followed by neuroendocrine tumors (15.9%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (39.4% of cases), depression (27.3%), dyslipidemia (23.3%), diabetes mellitus (23.5%) and hypothyroidism (23.5%).

Somatostatin inhibits hormonal secretions in the gastrointestinal tract. Somatostatin analogues are used in the treatment of VIPome-related watery diarrhoea. In addition, more than 10% of patients with AIDS suffer from diarrhoea likely due to the increased intestinal secretion of water and ions. However, the direct effect of somatostatin on the flux of water and ions in the intestine has not been, so far, analyzed in vivo. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of lanreotide, a somatostatin analogue, on the movements of water and ions in the jejunum in man. 2. Accordingly, 10 healthy volunteers (age 18-35 years, mean 27) and two patients with AIDS (26 and 33 years) suffering from water diarrhoea (> 800 ml day-1) underwent intestinal perfusion using a four lumen tube with proximal occluding balloon. The segment tested was 25 cm long. The jejunum was infused by an isotonic control saline solution containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) as nonabsorbable marker. Basal jejunal secretions were measured in all subjects. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was administered intraluminally to stimulate jejunal secretion in healthy volunteers. The effect of intravenous lanreotide on the jejunal PGE1-induced secretions of water and electrolytes was analysed in healthy subjects and on the basal secretions in AIDS patients. Each period was analyzed on the basis of three (10 min) successive intestinal juice collections after 20-30 min equilibration time. The antisecretory effect of lanreotide was evaluated in each subject as the difference between fluxes compared to the control period. 3. In healthy volunteers, PGE1 induced secretion of H2O, Na+, K+ and Cl- in the jejunum and lanreotide reduced significantly PGE1-induced response. In both AIDS patients basal fluxes of water and ions were reduced by lanreotide in a dose-dependent manner. 4. Somatostatin can reduce stimulated-jejunal secretion of ions and water in normal subjects and may improve water diarrhoea in AIDS\n\nLanreotide in metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaplin, Martyn E; Pavel, Marianne; ÄwikÅa, JarosÅaw B; Phan, Alexandria T; Raderer, Markus; SedlÃ¡ÄkovÃ¡, Eva; Cadiot, Guillaume; Wolin, Edward M; Capdevila, Jaume; Wall, Lucy; Rindi, Guido; Langley, Alison; Martinez, SÃ©verine; Blumberg, JoÃ«lle; Ruszniewski, Philippe\n\n2014-07-17\n\nSomatostatin analogues are commonly used to treat symptoms associated with hormone hypersecretion in neuroendocrine tumors; however, data on their antitumor effects are limited. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of the somatostatin analogue lanreotide in patients with advanced, well-differentiated or moderately differentiated, nonfunctioning, somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (a tumor proliferation index [on staining for the Ki-67 antigen] of <10%) and documented disease-progression status. The tumors originated in the pancreas, midgut, or hindgut or were of unknown origin. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an extended-release aqueous-gel formulation of lanreotide (Autogel [known in the United States as Depot], Ipsen) at a dose of 120 mg (101 patients) or placebo (103 patients) once every 28 days for 96 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival, defined as the time to disease progression (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.0) or death. Secondary end points included overall survival, quality of life (assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-GI.NET21), and safety. Most patients (96%) had no tumor progression in the 3 to 6 months before randomization, and 33% had hepatic tumor volumes greater than 25%. Lanreotide, as compared with placebo, was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (median not reached vs. median of 18.0 months, P<0.001 by the stratified log-rank test; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.73). The estimated rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 65.1% (95% CI, 54.0 to 74.1) in the lanreotide group and 33.0% (95% CI, 23.0 to 43.3) in the placebo group. The therapeutic effect in predefined subgroups was generally consistent with that in the overall\n\nBalance between somatostatin and D2 receptor expression drives TSH-secreting adenoma response to somatostatin analogues and dopastatins.\n\nPubMed\n\nGatto, Federico; Barbieri, Federica; Gatti, Monica; Wurth, Roberto; Schulz, Stefan; Ravetti, Jean-Louis; Zona, Gianluigi; Culler, Michael D; Saveanu, Alexandru; Giusti, Massimo; Minuto, Francesco; Hofland, Leo J; Ferone, Diego; Florio, Tullio\n\n2012-03-01\n\nFirst-line therapy for thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas (TSHomas) is neurosurgery, while medical treatment rests mainly on somatostatin analogues. Clinically available sst(2) -preferring analogues, octreotide and lanreotide, induce normalization of hormone levels in approximately 90% of patients and tumour shrinkage in 45%. We evaluated somatostatin 1, 2, 3 and 5 and dopamine D2 receptor expression in tumour samples from three TSHomas, and the relationships between receptor expression, in vitro antiproliferative response and clinical data, including octreotide test and three months of therapy with octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR). TSHoma cell proliferation was tested in vitro using octreotide, cabergoline and two chimeric compounds, BIM-23A760 and BIM-23A387. All patients showed significant TSH lowering to acute octreotide test, but a hormonal response to long-term treatment was observed in only two patients, showing a high sst(5) /sst(2) ratio. Patient 2, characterized by high expression of sst(2) and sst(1) and a relative lower expression of sst(5) , experienced tachyphylaxis after prolonged octreotide treatment. In vitro, the somatostatin/dopamine receptor agonist BIM-23A760 caused the highest antiproliferative effect among those tested. Combined treatment with octreotide and cabergoline displayed an additive effect of magnitude comparable to that of the other chimeric compound (BIM-23A387). Octreotide resistance was confirmed in cells isolated from the nonresponder patient, although it could be overcome by treatment with the chimeric compounds. â A high sst(5) /sst(2) ratio might be predictive of a positive outcome to long-term treatment with somatostatin analogues in TSHomas. Moreover, combined somatostatin and D(2) receptor targeting might be considered as a potential tool to improve the response rate in octreotide-resistant tumours.

Clinical experiences].\n\nPubMed\n\nHerszÃ©nyi, LÃ¡szlÃ³; MihÃ¡ly, Emese; Tulassay, Zsolt\n\n2013-09-29\n\nThe effect of somatostatin on the gastrointestinal tract is complex; it inhibits the release of gastrointestinal hormones, the exocrine function of the stomach, pancreas and bile, decreases motility and influences absorption as well. Based on these diverse effects there was an increased expectation towards the success of somatostatin therapy in various gastrointestinal disorders. The preconditions for somatostatin treatment was created by the development of long acting somatostatin analogues (octreotide, lanreotide). During the last twenty-five years large trials clarified the role of somatostatin analogues in the treatment of various gastrointestinal diseases. This study summarizes shortly these results. Somatostatin analogue treatment could be effective in various pathological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, however, this therapeutic modality became a part of the clinical routine only in neuroendocrine tumours and adjuvant treatment of oesophageal variceal bleeding and pancreatic fistulas.\n\nTherapeutic options in the management of acromegaly: focus on lanreotide AutogelÂ®\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRoelfsema, Ferdinand; Biermasz, Nienke R; Pereira, Alberto M; Romijn, Johannes A\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground In acromegaly, expert surgery is curative in only about 60% of patients. Postoperative radiation therapy is associated with a high incidence of hypopituitarism and its effect on growth hormone (GH) production is slow, so that adjuvant medical treatment becomes of importance in the management of many patients. Objective To delineate the role of lanreotide in the treatment of acromegaly. Methods Search of Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases for clinical studies of lanreotide in acromegaly. Results Treatment with lanreotide slow release and lanreotide AutogelÂ® normalized GH and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations in about 50% of patients. The efficacy of 120 mg lanreotide AutogelÂ® on GH and IGF-I levels was comparable with that of 20 mg octreotide LAR. There were no differences in improvement of cardiac function, decrease in pancreatic Î²-cell function, or occurrence of side effects, including cholelithiasis, between octreotide LAR and lanreotide AutogelÂ®. When postoperative treatment with somatostatin analogs does not result in normalization of serum IGF-I and GH levels after noncurative surgery, pegvisomant alone or in combination with somatostatin analogs can control these levels in a substantial number of patients.

This study was designed to provide preliminary information on the effect of the administration of a long-acting somatostatin analog, lanreotide, on plasma levels of chromogranin A (CgA). Secondary aims were the evaluation of changes in circulating prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Lanreotide (Ipstyl 30 mg; Ipsen, Milan, Italy) was administered intramuscularly every 14 days for 2 months to nine heavily pretreated prostate cancer patients with hormone refractory disease. All patients had, at baseline conditions, CgA values above the normal range. Androgen deprivation was maintained during the study period, while other concomitant antineoplastic treatments were not allowed. Serum PSA levels and plasma CgA and IGF-1 values were measured every week. Lanreotide treatment was very well tolerated and no patient experienced major toxicity. Plasma CgA values at baseline: mean 109 U/liter, standard deviation +/- 85 decreased significantly after treatment as follows: 42 U/liter, +/- 17.8; 27.2 U/liter +/- 13.6; 31.4 U/liter, +/- 17.8 and 27.6 U/liter, +/- 17.0; after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, respectively (P < 0.01, Friedman ANOVA). Serum PSA did not change. Baseline IGF-1 was found to be above the detection limit in four cases, all of them showing a decrease after lanreotide. Lanreotide administration to prostate cancer patients induces a decrease in plasma CgA and IGF-1 levels, without any influence on serum PSA values. Prostate 47:205-211, 2001.

A practical overview.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Blois, Erik; Chan, Ho Sze; Breeman, Wouter A P\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFor iodination ((125/127)I) of tyrosine-containing peptides, chloramin-T, Pre-Coated Iodo-Gen(Â®) tubes and Iodo-Beads(Â®) (Pierce) are commonly used for in vitro radioligand investigations and there have been reliant vendors hereof for decades. However, commercial availability of these radio-iodinated peptides is decreasing. For continuation of our research in this field we investigated and optimized (radio-)iodination of somatostatin analogues. In literature, radioiodination using here described somatostatin analogues and iodination techniques are described separately. Here we present an overview, including High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) separation and characterisation by mass spectrometry, to obtain mono- and di-iodinated analogues. Reaction kinetics of (125/127)I iodinated somatostatin analogues were investigated as function of reaction time and concentration of reactants, including somatostatin analogues, iodine and oxidizing agent. To our knowledge, for the here described somatostatin analogues, no (127)I iodination and optimization are described. (Radio-)iodinated somatostatin analogues could be preserved with a >90% radiochemical purity for 1 month after reversed phase HPLC-purification.\n\nDeficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins in long-term users of somatostatin analogue.\n\nPubMed\n\nFiebrich, H-B; Van Den Berg, G; Kema, I P; Links, T P; Kleibeuker, J H; Van Beek, A P; Walenkamp, A M E; Sluiter, W J; De Vries, E G E\n\n2010-12-01\n\nSomatostatin analogues are administered to control hormone hypersecretion in acromegaly and carcinoid patients. Somatostatin analogues can increase fat in the stools, which can lead to loss of fat-soluble vitamins. The effect of long-term somatostatin analogue use on vitamin levels remains unknown. To investigate the prevalence of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in long-term somatostatin analogue users. All acromegaly and carcinoid patients using somatostatin analogues for â¥ 18 months visiting the University Medical Center Groningen between December 2008 and April 2009 were eligible. Vitamin levels of fat-soluble vitamins in blood, clinical and vitamin-dependent laboratory parameters were collected. In all, 19 acromegaly and 35 carcinoid patients were included. Twelve patients experienced steatorrhoea; two carcinoid patients experienced night blindness. Forty-two (78%) were deficient for one or more vitamins, and 32% (n = 17) had multiple deficiencies. Deficiencies for vitamin A, D, E, K1 and E in erythrocytes occurred in 6%, 28%, 15%, 63% and 58% of the patients. Prevalence of vitamin D, E and K1 deficiencies was similar in both patient groups. Treatment duration did not influence vitamin levels. The length of intestinal resection and age correlated negatively with vitamin A levels. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies are frequent during long-term somatostatin analogue treatment. Therefore, fat-soluble vitamins should be monitored in these patients.

For decades, somatostatin analogs (including octreotide and lanreotide) have been indicated for relief of the symptoms of flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing associated with secretory neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Recently, it has been suggested that somatostatin analogs may provide direct and indirect antitumor effects in secretory and nonsecretory NETs in addition to symptom control in secretory NETs. Methods. A systematic review of MEDLINE was conducted to identify studies that investigated the antitumor effects of octreotide or lanreotide for patients with NETs. Additional studies not published in the peer-reviewed literature were identified by searching online abstracts. Results. In all, 17 octreotide trials and 11 lanreotide trials that included antitumor effects were identified. Partial response rates were between 0% and 31%, and stable disease rates were between 15% and 89%. Octreotide was the only somatostatin analog for which results of a phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that investigated antitumor effects were published. After 6 months of treatment in this randomized phase III trial, stable disease was observed in 67% of patients (hazard ratio for time to disease progression: 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.20â0.59; p = .000072). Conclusions. In addition to symptom control for NETs, the data support an antitumor effect of somatostatin analogs and suggest that they may slow tumor growth. Long-acting repeatable octreotide has been shown to have an antitumor effect in a randomized phase III trial in midgut NETs, whereas results are pending in a corresponding controlled trial with lanreotide for patients with intestinal and pancreatic primary NETs.

Theranostics (therapy and diagnosis) using radiolabeled somatostatin analogues has proved to be a milestone in the management of SSTR-expressing tumors. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy using (177)Lu-labeled or (90)Y-labeled somatostatin analogues may have a significant role in the management of medullary and nonmedullary thyroid cancers in those patients where PET/CT with (68)Ga-labeled somatostatin analogues demonstrates significant SSTR expression.

In fact, peptide ligands of somatostatin receptors (sstâs) conjugated with chelating agents are in clinical use. We have recently developed octreotide dicarba-analogues, which show interesting binding profiles at sstâs. In this context, it was mandatory to explore the possibility that our analogues could maintain their activity also upon conjugation with DOTA. In this paper, we report and discuss the synthesis, binding affinity and conformational preferences of three DOTA-conjugated dicarba-analogues of octreotide. Interestingly, two conjugated analogues exhibited nanomolar affinities on sst2 and sst5 somatostatin receptor subtypes.\n\nEfficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of sustained-release lanreotide (lanreotide Autogel) in Japanese patients with acromegaly or pituitary gigantism.\n\nPubMed\n\nShimatsu, Akira; Teramoto, Akira; Hizuka, Naomi; Kitai, Kazuo; Ramis, Joaquim; Chihara, Kazuo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe somatostatin analog lanreotide Autogel has proven to be efficacious for treating acromegaly in international studies and in clinical practices around the world. However, its efficacy in Japanese patients has not been extensively evaluated. We examined the dose-response relationship and long-term efficacy and safety in Japanese patients with acromegaly or pituitary gigantism. In an open-label, parallel-group, dose-response study, 32 patients (29 with acromegaly, 3 with pituitary gigantism) received 5 injections of 60, 90, or 120 mg of lanreotide Autogel over 24 weeks. Four weeks after the first injection, 41% of patients achieved serum GH level of <2.5 ng/mL and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) level was normalized in 31%. Values at Week 24 were 53% for GH and 44% for IGF-I. Dose-dependent decreases in serum GH and IGF-I levels were observed with dose-related changes in pharmacokinetic parameters. In an open-label, long-term study, 32 patients (30 with acromegaly, 2 with pituitary gigantism) received lanreotide Autogel once every 4 weeks for a total of 13 injections. Dosing was initiated with 90 mg and adjusted according to clinical responses at Weeks 16 and/or 32. At Week 52, 47% of patients had serum GH levels of <2.5 ng/mL and 53% had normalized IGF-I level. In both studies, acromegaly symptoms improved and treatment was generally well tolerated although gastrointestinal symptoms and injection site induration were reported. In conclusion, lanreotide Autogel provided early and sustained control of elevated GH and IGF-I levels, improved acromegaly symptoms, and was well tolerated in Japanese patients with acromegaly or pituitary gigantism.\n\nAntiproliferative effects of lanreotide autogel in patients with progressive, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours: a Spanish, multicentre, open-label, single arm phase II study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­n-Richard, Marta; MassutÃ­, Bartomeu; Pineda, Eva; Alonso, Vicente; Marmol, Maribel; Castellano, Daniel; Fonseca, Emilio; GalÃ¡n, Antonio; Llanos, Marta; Sala, Maria Angeles; Pericay, Carlos; Rivera, Fernando; Sastre, Javier; Segura, Angel; QuindÃ³s, Maria; Maisonobe, Pascal\n\n2013-09-20\n\nSomatostatin analogues (SSAs) are indicated to relieve carcinoid syndrome but seem to have antiproliferative effects on neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). This is the first prospective study investigating tumour stabilisation with the long-acting SSA lanreotide Autogel in patients with progressive NETs. This was a multicentre, open-label, phase II trial conducted in 17 Spanish specialist centres. Patients with well-differentiated NETs and radiologically confirmed progression within the previous 6Â months received lanreotide Autogel, 120Â mg every 28Â days over â¤92Â weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were response rate, tumour biomarkers, symptom control, quality of life (QoL), and safety. Radiographic imaging was assessed by a blinded central radiologist. Of 30 patients included in the efficacy and safety analyses, 40% had midgut tumours and 27% pancreatic tumours; 63% of tumours were functioning. Median PFS time was 12.9 (95% CI: 7.9, 16.5) months, and most patients achieved disease stabilisation (89%) or partial response (4%). No deterioration in QoL was observed. Nineteen patients (63%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, most frequently diarrhoea and asthenia; only one treatment-related adverse event (aerophagia) was severe. Lanreotide Autogel provided effective tumour stabilisation and PFS >12Â months in patients with progressive NETs ineligible for surgery or chemotherapy, with a safety profile consistent with the pharmacology of the class.

Some patients may develop SSA-related side effects such as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency(PEI). Methods In this single-institution, prospective, observational study, the frequency of SSA-induced PEI in 50 sequential patients with advanced Wd-NETs treated with SSAs was investigated. Toxicity was assessed monthly and faecal elastase-1 (FE1) and quality of life (QoL) were assessed 3-monthly. Results The median age was 65.8 years, 58% were male and the majority (92%) of patients had metastatic disease; patients received 4-weekly long acting octreotide (60%) or lanreotide (40%). Twelve patients (24%) developed SSA-related PEI after a median of 2.9 months from SSA initiation; FE1 was a reliable screening tool, especially in symptomatic patients (risk ratio 8.25 (95% confidence interval 1.15-59.01)). Most of these patients (11/12; 92%) required PERT. Other SSA-related adverse events (any grade) included flatulence (50%), abdominal pain (32%), diarrhoea (30%) and fatigue (20%). Development of PEI did not significantly worsen overall QoL, however gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhoea were increased. Conclusion This study demonstrated that PEI occurs at a higher rate than previously reported; clinicians need to diagnose and treat this SSA-related adverse-event which occurs in 1 in 4 patients with Wd-NETs treated with SSAs.\n\nMolecular Origin of the Self-Assembly of Lanreotide into Nanotubes: A Mutational Approachâ\n\nPubMed Central\n\nValÃ©ry, CÃ©line; Pouget, Emilie; Pandit, Anjali; Verbavatz, Jean-Marc; Bordes, Luc; BoisdÃ©, Isabelle; Cherif-Cheikh, Roland; Artzner, Franck; Paternostre, MaitÃ©\n\n2008-01-01\n\nLanreotide, a synthetic, therapeutic octapeptide analog of somatostatin, self-assembles in water into perfectly hollow and monodisperse (24-nm wide) nanotubes. Lanreotide is a cyclic octapeptide that contains three aromatic residues. The molecular packing of the peptide in the walls of a nanotube has recently been characterized, indicating four hierarchical levels of organization. This is a fascinating example of spontaneous self-organization, very similar to the formation of the gas vesicle walls of Halobacterium halobium. However, this unique peptide self-assembly raises important questions about its molecular origin. We adopted a directed mutation approach to determine the molecular parameters driving the formation of such a remarkable peptide architecture. We have modified the conformation by opening the cycle and by changing the conformation of a Lys residue, and we have also mutated the aromatic side chains of the peptide. We show that three parameters are essential for the formation of lanreotide nanotubes: i), the specificity of two of the three aromatic side chains, ii), the spatial arrangement of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and iii), the aromatic side chain in the Î²-turn of the molecule. When these molecular characteristics are modified, either the peptides lose their self-assembling capability or they form less-ordered architectures, such as amyloid fibers and curved lamellae. Thus we have determined key elements of the molecular origins of lanreotide nanotube formation.

The management of such effusions is often challenging. We present the case of a 15-year-old girl with bilateral chylothoraces and lymphoedema of her limbs. A clinical diagnosis of Generalised Lymphatic Dysplasia was made and long-term treatment with somatostatin analogues (somatostatin initially followed by monthly octreotide) was initiated. Over 12 months there was symptomatic benefit with some objective improvement in lung function and no adverse effects. After a year of treatment there was some reaccumulation of fluid, however this did not require any intervention. This is the first paediatric report of the use of somatostatin analogues to manage chylothorax in Generalised Lymphatic Dysplasia and we conclude that they represent a potentially useful treatment modality. Experience is only anecdotal however and further studies are required to establish an evidence base with regard to efficacy and safety.

However, sensitivity to rapamycin is reduced by Akt activation that results from the ablative effects of rapamycin on a p70 S6K-induced negative feedback loop that blunts phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated support for Akt activity. Thus, sensitivity to rapamycin might be increased by imposing an upstream blockade to the PI3K/Akt pathway. Here, we investigated this model using the somatostatin analogue octreotide as a tool to decrease levels of activated Ser(473)-phosphorylated Akt (pAkt-Ser(473)) in pituitary tumor cells that express somatostatin receptors. Octreotide increased levels of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 that were suppressed by rapamycin, subsequently decreasing levels of pAkt-Ser(473) through effects on phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. Octreotide potentiated the antiproliferative effects of rapamycin in immortalized pituitary tumor cells or human nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma cells in primary cell culture, sensitizing tumor cells even to low rapamycin concentrations. Combined treatment of octreotide and rapamycin triggered G(1) cell cycle arrest, decreasing E2F transcriptional activity and cyclin E levels by increasing levels of p27/Kip1. These findings show that adjuvant treatment with a somatostatin analogue can sensitize pituitary tumor cells to the antiproliferative effects of rapamycin.\n\nAntiproliferative effects of lanreotide autogel in patients with progressive, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours: a Spanish, multicentre, open-label, single arm phase II study\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Somatostatin analogues (SSAs) are indicated to relieve carcinoid syndrome but seem to have antiproliferative effects on neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). This is the first prospective study investigating tumour stabilisation with the long-acting SSA lanreotide Autogel in patients with progressive NETs. Methods This was a multicentre, open-label, phase II trial conducted in 17 Spanish specialist centres. Patients with well-differentiated NETs and radiologically confirmed progression within the previous 6Â months received lanreotide Autogel, 120Â mg every 28Â days over â¤92Â weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were response rate, tumour biomarkers, symptom control, quality of life (QoL), and safety. Radiographic imaging was assessed by a blinded central radiologist. Results Of 30 patients included in the efficacy and safety analyses, 40% had midgut tumours and 27% pancreatic tumours; 63% of tumours were functioning. Median PFS time was 12.9 (95% CI: 7.9, 16.5) months, and most patients achieved disease stabilisation (89%) or partial response (4%). No deterioration in QoL was observed. Nineteen patients (63%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, most frequently diarrhoea and asthenia; only one treatment-related adverse event (aerophagia) was severe. Conclusion Lanreotide Autogel provided effective tumour stabilisation and PFS >12Â months in patients with progressive NETs ineligible for surgery or chemotherapy, with a safety profile consistent with the pharmacology of the class.

Cysteine at positions 3 and/or 14 (SRIF numbering) were/was substituted with d-cysteine, Nor-cysteine, d-Nor-cysteine, Homo-cysteine and/or d-Homo-cysteine. The 3D structures of selected partially selective, bioactive analogues (3, 18, 19 and 21) were carried out in DMSO. Interestingly and not unexpectedly, the 3D structures of these analogues comprised the pharmacophore for which the analogues had the highest binding affinities (i.e., sst4 in all cases).

To estimate the costs to payers associated with 30-mg octreotide LAR and 120-mg lanreotide treatment among patients with metastatic GI-NETs. The costs to payers associated with the 2 drugs were estimated by including the costs of each drug, drug administration, and adverse events. The unit drug costs for octreotide LAR and for lanreotide were obtained from ReadyPrice Wholesale Acquisition Cost; the doses were obtained from published studies. The adverse event rates were obtained from 2 phase 3 clinical trials, PROMID and CLARINET. Deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses were used to assess the impact of modifying assumptions and inputs on the results, including the 2017 Average Sales Price (ASP). All costs were estimated in 2016 US dollars, with a constant discount of 3%. The costs to payers associated with the treatment of GI-NETs during 1-, 3-, and 5-year horizons were $74,566, $180,082, and $262,344, respectively, for octreotide LAR and $84,856, $205,562, and $299,667, respectively, for lanreotide. Thus, octreotide LAR was associated with lower costs by $10,290 (1 year), $25,480 (3 years), and $37,323 (5 years) compared with lanreotide. Over a 5-year horizon, the costs of adverse events and administration accounted for 0.72% of the total cost for octreotide LAR and 0.51% of the total cost for lanreotide. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that the main factor affecting the cost difference was the price of the drugs; analyses using the ASP yielded similar results. For the management of metastatic GI-NETs, the cost to payers of treatment with 30-mg octreotide LAR is considerably lower than with 120-mg lanreotide over 1-, 3-, and 5-year horizons.

Among 601 patients with NET, 140 with a histologically confirmed gastro-entero-pancreatic or thoracic NET or NET with unknown primary were treated with lanreotide autogel or octreotide LAR. An objective tumour response was observed in 11%, stability in 58% and progression in 31%. Objective response and tumour stability were not significantly different between G1 and G2 NETs. Progression free survival was longer but not significantly different in G1 than G2 NETs (median: 89 vs 43 months, p = 0.15). The median PFS was significantly longer in NETs showing Ki67 < 5% than in those showing Ki67 â¥5% (89 vs 35 months, p = 0.005). SSA therapy shows significant antiproliferative effects in well differentiated low/intermediate-proliferating NETs, not only G1 but also in G2 type. A Ki67 index of 5% seems to work better than 3% to select the best candidates for SSA therapy.

Elevated GH and IGF-I levels result in a wide range of somatic, cardiovascular, endocrine, metabolic and gastrointestinal morbidities. Somatostatin analogues (SSAs) form the basis of medical therapy for acromegaly and are currently used as first-line treatment or as second-line therapy in patients undergoing unsuccessful surgery. However, a considerable percentage of patients do not respond to SSAs treatment. Somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-5) and dopamine receptors (DRD1-5) subtypes play critical roles in the regulation of hormone secretion. These receptors are considered important pharmacological targets to inhibit hormone oversecretion. It has been proposed that decreased expression of SSTRs may be associated with poor response to SSAs. Here, we systematically examine SSTRs and DRDs expression in human somatotroph adenomas by quantitative PCR. We observed an association between the response to SSAs treatment and DRD4, DRD5, SSTR1 and SSTR2 expression. We also examined SSTR expression by immunohistochemistry and found that the immunohistochemical detection of SSTR2 in particular might be a good predictor of response to SSAs. Â© 2017 The Authors.

Somatostatin may inhibit neuroblastoma growth and induce apoptosis in vitro and was therefore investigated. Using a radioimmunoassay, we found that all ganglioneuromas contained high somatostatin concentrations (> 16 pmol/g), significantly higher than neuroblastomas (n = 117, median 2.8 pmol/g), healthy adrenals, Wilms' tumours, phaeochromocytomas and other neuroendocrine tumours (P < 0.001). Neuroblastomas contained more somatostatin than control tumours (P < 0.001-0.05). Neuroblastomas amplified for the MYCN oncogene contained less somatostatin than non-amplified tumours (1.2 pmol/g versus 4.0 pmol/g, respectively; P = 0.026). In a clinically unfavourable neuroblastoma subset (age > 12 months, stage 3 or 4) 16 children with high concentrations of somatostatin in primary tumours had a better prognosis than 23 with low somatostatin (46.7% versus 0% survival at 5 years, P < 0.005). Scintigraphy using 111In-pentetreotide identified tumours expressing high-affinity somatostatin receptors in vivo. However, no significant correlation was found between somatostatin receptor expression and peptide content in 15 tumours. Similarly, human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma xenografts grown in nude rats showed low somatostatin concentrations, but were positive for somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Treatment of these rats with the somatostatin analogue octreotide seemed to upregulate in vivo receptor expression of somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal peptide more effectively than 13-cis retinoic acid. In conclusion, somatostatin in neuroblastoma is associated with differentiation to benign ganglioneuromas in vivo and favourable outcome in advanced tumours. Furthermore, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy may identify tumours with high-affinity receptors in children that might benefit from targeted therapy using synthetic\n\nSomatostatin Analogues for Receptor Targeted Photodynamic Therapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKaÅ¡ÄÃ¡kovÃ¡, SlÃ¡vka; Hofland, Leo J.; De Bruijn, Henriette S.; Ye, Yunpeng; Achilefu, Samuel; van der Wansem, Katy; van der Ploeg-van den Heuvel, Angelique; van Koetsveld, Peter M.; Brugts, Michael P.; van der Lelij, Aart-Jan; Sterenborg, Henricus J.

For the treatment of pathologies in certain anatomical sites, improved targeting of the photosensitizer is necessary to prevent damage to healthy tissue. We report on a novel dual approach of targeted PDT (vascular and cellular targeting) utilizing the expression of neuropeptide somatostatin receptor (sst2) on tumor and neovascular-endothelial cells. We synthesized two conjugates containing the somatostatin analogue [Tyr3]-octreotate and Chlorin e6 (Ce6): Ce6-K3-[Tyr3]-octreotate (1) and Ce6-[Tyr3]-octreotate-K3-[Tyr3]-octreotate (2). Investigation of the uptake and photodynamic activity of conjugates in-vitro in human erythroleukemic K562 cells showed that conjugation of [Tyr3]-octreotate with Ce6 in conjugate 1 enhances uptake (by a factor 2) in cells over-expressing sst2 compared to wild-type cells. Co-treatment with excess free Octreotide abrogated the phototoxicity of conjugate 1 indicative of a specific sst2-mediated effect. In contrast conjugate 2 showed no receptor-mediated effect due to its high hydrophobicity. When compared with un-conjugated Ce6, the PDT activity of conjugate 1 was lower. However, it showed higher photostability which may compensate for its lower phototoxicity. Intra-vital fluorescence pharmacokinetic studies of conjugate 1 in rat skin-fold observation chambers transplanted with sst2 + AR42J acinar pancreas tumors showed significantly different uptake profiles compared to free Ce6. Co-treatment with free Octreotide significantly reduced conjugate uptake in tumor tissue (by a factor 4) as well as in the chamber neo-vasculature. These results show that conjugate 1 might have potential as an in-vivo sst2 targeting photosensitizer conjugate.

To overcome the limitations of the octapeptides having affinity only to somatostatin receptor subtypes 2 and 5, HRPC expressing mainly somatostatin receptors 1 and 4, a somatostatin derivative based on the natural somatostatin having affinity to all five somatostatin receptor subtypes, was developed. The in vivo stability of this dextran-conjugated derivative, somatostatin-D70, was confirmed previously in animal studies, and the nanomolar \"panaffinity\" has been shown in in vitro receptor binding studies on cell lines transfected with the somatostatin receptor genes. Sms-D70 was given with subcutaneous injection once a week at dose levels of 5, 10, 20, 35, and 50 mg. For pharmacokinetic studies, sms-D70 was labeled with 131I. Fourteen patients were treated, of whom 10 had prostate and 4 renal cell cancer. The kinetic data revealed high stability with a long half-life in the blood. The drug was well tolerated, and no grade 4 (WHO) toxicity was observed. The maximal tolerated dose could not be established due to the lack of dose-limiting toxicities. Objective PSA responses were not recorded in these heavily treated patients, but subjective stabilization of pain was observed and urinary symptoms were alleviated in four patients. Three patients with metastatic HRPC received 5-10-mg intravenous injections of sms-D70 once weekly for 4-14 months on a compassionate use basis. In all cases, serum PSA values decreased more than 50% from the pretreatment level, but these results are difficult to interpret due to concomitant treatments given to these patients. In conclusion, sms-D70 was well tolerated in the treatment of metastatic prostate and renal cell cancer, but no responses were found in these heavily treated patients.\n\n[Therapeutic use of somatostatin analogues in endocrinology].\n\nPubMed\n\nFaglia, G; Arosio, M\n\n1992-11-01\n\nThe recent availability of the long-acting somatostatin analogue, octreotide, has allowed its therapeutical use in a wide variety of human diseases, including some digestive, neoplastic and autoimmune disorders. This review focuses on the treatment of some endocrine disorders with octreotide. Evidence is accumulating that octreotide treatment is effective in improving the cure rate of pituitary surgery in acromegaly by shrinking the tumour size, and in lowering GH and IGF-I levels in the vaste majority of patients. Octreotide is also effective in ameliorating TSH-induced hyperthyroidism in patients with TSH-secreting adenomas. Moreover, octreotide has proved useful in the management of endocrine tumours of the gastroenteropancreatic tract (vipomas, glucagonomas, gastrinomas, insulinomas, and carcinoids) by reducing hormone levels and in some instances the size of the primary and/or metastatic lesions. Besides the above well-established indications there are some other potential indications (non-secreting pituitary tumours, medullary thyroid carcinoma, ectopic Cushing's syndrome, diabete mellitus, Graves' ophthalmopathy, tall children and polycystic ovary syndrome) that still await further investigation. Side-effects of octreotide, particularly the formation of gallstones, should be carefully monitored.\n\nThe effect of thyroid hormone and a long-acting somatostatin analogue on TtT-97 murine thyrotropic tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nWoodmansee, W W; Gordon, D F; Dowding, J M; Stolz, B; Lloyd, R V; James, R A; Wood, W M; Ridgway, E C\n\n2000-07-01\n\nThyroid hormone inhibits thyrotropin (TSH) production and thyrotrope growth. Somatostatin has been implicated as a synergistic factor in the inhibition of thyrotrope function. We have previously shown that pharmacological doses of thyroid hormone (levothyroxine [LT4]) inhibit growth of murine TtT-97 thyrotropic tumors in association with upregulation of somatostatin receptor type 5 (sst5) mRNA and somatostatin receptor binding. In the current study, we examined the effect of physiological thyroid hormone replacement alone or in combination with the long-acting somatostatin analogue, Sandostatin LAR, on thyrotropic tumor growth, thyrotropin growth factor-beta (TSH-beta), and sst5 mRNA expression, as well as somatostatin receptor binding sites. Physiological LT4 replacement therapy resulted in tumor shrinkage in association with increased sst5 mRNA levels, reduced TSH-beta mRNA levels and enhanced somatostatin receptor binding. Sandostatin LAR alone had no effect on any parameter measured. However, Sandostatin LAR combined with LT4 synergistically inhibited TSH-beta mRNA production and reduced final tumor weights to a greater degree. In this paradigm, Sandostatin LAR required a euthyroid status to alter thyrotrope parameters. These data suggest an important interaction between the somatostatinergic system and thyroid hormone in the regulation of thyrotrope cell structure and function.\n\nCombination therapy of ethinylestradiol and somatostatin analogue reintroduces objective clinical responses and decreases chromogranin a in patients with androgen ablation refractory prostate cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nDi Silverio, Franco; Sciarra, Alessandro\n\n2003-11-01\n\nWe evaluated whether a combination therapy of ethinylestradiol and somatostatin analogue can reintroduce objective clinical responses in patients with metastatic androgen ablation refractory prostate cancer (PC). Ten patients with stage D3 disease and bone metastases who had progression despite initial responses to combined androgen blockade and in whom antiandrogen withdrawal subsequently failed discontinued combined androgen blockade and received 1 mg ethinylestradiol orally daily and 73.9 mg lanreotide acetate intramuscularly every 4 weeks. Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), chromogranin A (CgA), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and bone pain scores were assessed at regular intervals. Median followup was 18 months (range 10 to 24). Nine of the 10 cases (90%, 95% CI 55.5 to 99.8) had an objective clinical response, defined as a greater than 50% PSA decrease (median 87.1%, range 50.2% to 94.4%). PSA normalization (less than 4 ng/ml) was achieved in 3 cases. All patients reported significant and durable improvement in bone pain (median duration 17.5 months) and performance status (median duration 18 months) without major treatment related side effects. Two patients with disease progression died secondary to PC at 16 and 10 months, respectively. All other patients were without progression. We observed a statistically significant decrease in serum CgA during administration and at the response to therapy (median 38.4%, range 28.6% to 64.9%, (p <0.0001). Interestingly CgA was not increased at relapse. This combination therapy seems to reintroduce an objective clinical response and symptomatic improvement in androgen ablation refractory PC cases.\n\nSomatostatin receptor PET in neuroendocrine tumours: 68Ga-DOTA0,Tyr3-octreotide versus 68Ga-DOTA0-lanreotide.\n\nPubMed\n\nPutzer, Daniel; Kroiss, Alexander; Waitz, Dietmar; Gabriel, Michael; Traub-Weidinger, Tatjana; Uprimny, Christian; von Guggenberg, Elisabeth; Decristoforo, Clemens; Warwitz, Boris; Widmann, Gerlig; Virgolini, Irene Johanna\n\n2013-02-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of (68)Ga-labelled DOTA(0)-lanreotide ((68)Ga-DOTA-LAN) on the diagnostic assessment of neuroendocrine tumour (NET) patients with low to moderate uptake on planar somatostatin receptor (SSTR) scintigraphy or (68)Ga-labelled DOTA(0),Tyr(3)-octreotide ((68)Ga-DOTA-TOC) positron emission tomography (PET). Fifty-three patients with histologically confirmed NET and clinical signs of progressive disease, who had not qualified for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) on planar SSTR scintigraphy or (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET (nâ=â38) due to lack of tracer uptake, underwent (68)Ga-DOTA-LAN PET to evaluate a treatment option with (90)Y-labelled lanreotide according to the MAURITIUS trial. The included patients received 150âÂ±â30Â MBq of each radiopharmaceutical intravenously. PET scans were acquired 60-90Â min after intravenous bolus injection. Image results from both PET scans were compared head to head, focusing on the intensity of tracer uptake in terms of treatment decision. CT was used for morphologic correlation of tumour lesions. To further evaluate the binding affinities of each tracer, quantitative and qualitative values were calculated for target lesions. (68)Ga-DOTA-LAN and (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC both showed equivalent findings in 24/38 patients when fused PET/CT images were interpreted. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (68)Ga-DOTA-LAN in comparison to CT were 0.63, 0.5 and 0.62 (nâ=â53; pâ<â0.0001) and for (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC in comparison to CT 0.78, 0.5 and 0.76 (nâ=â38; pâ<â0.013), respectively.

We then addressed our work to investigate if SMS inhibits PHA activation of PBL by a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic mechanism. Consequently, we studied the cell cycle distribution and the activation of caspase-3, measuring the presence of the cleavage product of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP), and we evaluated the presence of apoptotic DNA by using a monoclonal antibody specific for the single-stranded regions of DNA. All our results indicate that SMS induces apoptosis in activated lymphocytes.\n\nBudget impact of somatostatin analogs as treatment for metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in US hospitals.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrtendahl, Jesse D; Pulgar, Sonia J; Mirakhur, Beloo; Cox, David; Bentley, Tanya Gk; Phan, Alexandria T\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWith the introduction of new therapies, hospitals have to plan spending limited resources in a cost-effective manner. To assist in identifying the optimal treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, budget impact modeling was used to estimate the financial implications of adoption and diffusion of somatostatin analogs (SSAs). A hypothetical cohort of 500 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patients was assessed in an economic model, with the proportion with metastatic disease treated with an SSA estimated using published data. Drug acquisition, preparation, and administration costs were based on national pricing databases and published literature. Octreotide dosing was based on published estimates of real-world data, whereas for lanreotide, real-world dosing was unavailable and we therefore used the highest indicated dosing. Alternative scenarios reflecting the proportion of patients receiving lanreotide or octreotide were considered to estimate the incremental budget impact to the hospital. In the base case, 313 of the initial 500 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patients were treated with an SSA. The model-predicted per-patient cost was US$83,473 for lanreotide and US$89,673 for octreotide. With a hypothetical increase in lanreotide utilization from 5% to 30% of this population, the annual model-projected hospital costs decreased by US$488,615. When varying the inputs in one-way sensitivity analyses, the results were most sensitive to changes in dosing assumptions. Results suggest that factors beyond drug acquisition cost can influence the budget impact to a hospital. When considering preparation and administration time, and real-world dosing, use of lanreotide has the potential to reduce health care expenditures associated with metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor treatments.\n\nTreatment adherence and persistence with long-acting somatostatin analog therapy for the treatment of acromegaly: a retrospective analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nGurel, Michelle H; Han, Yi; Stevens, Andrea L; Furtado, Aaron; Cox, David\n\n2017-04-04\n\nMany patients with acromegaly require medical treatment that includes somatostatin analogs (SSAs). Long-acting SSA formulations are widely used, due in part to increased patient convenience and increased treatment adherence vs daily medications. Although medication compliance can be poor in patients with chronic conditions, adherence and persistence with these SSAs in patients with acromegaly has not been evaluated. This analysis utilized claims data to estimate treatment adherence and persistence for lanreotide depot and long-acting octreotide in this population. This retrospective analysis used the MarketScanÂ® database (~100 payors, 500 million claims in the US), which was searched between January 2007 and June 2012 to identify patients with acromegaly taking either lanreotide depot or long-acting octreotide. Patients switching treatments were excluded. Treatment adherence was assessed using medication possession ratio (MPR; number of doses dispensed in relation to dispensing period; â¥80% is considered adherent), injection count, and treatment time. Persistence was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards modeling. A washout period, defined as no acromegaly-related prescription activity 180 days prior to the index date, was employed to minimize effects of prior therapy and focus on patients more likely to be treatment-naÃ¯ve. Altogether 1308 patients with acromegaly receiving a single SSA for treatment (1127 octreotide, 181 lanreotide) who had not switched treatments were identified. Mean MPR in patients with a 180-day washout (nâ=â663) was 89% for those receiving octreotide (nâ=â545) and 87% for those receiving lanreotide (nâ=â118). Median number of days on therapy was 169 (95% CI 135-232) for octreotide patients and 400 (95% CI 232-532) for lanreotide patients. The point estimate of the Cox proportional hazard ratio for stopping treatment was 1.385 for octreotide vs lanreotide (95% CI 1.079-1.777), suggesting a 38\n\nExpression and function of somatostatin receptor subtype 1 in human growth hormone secreting pituitary tumors deriving from patients partially responsive or resistant to long-term treatment with somatostatin analogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatrone, C; Pivonello, R; Colao, A; Cappabianca, P; Cavallo, L M; Del Basso De Caro, M L; Taylor, J E; Culler, M D; Lombardi, G; Di Renzo, G F; Annunziato, L\n\n2004-03-01\n\nThe role of somatostatin (SS) receptor subtype 1 (SSTR(1)) in mediating the inhibitory effect of SS on growth hormone (GH) secreting pituitary tumors has been recently demonstrated. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the selective SSTR(1) agonist BIM-23745 on in vitro GH secretion in GH-secreting pituitary tumor cells, deriving from patients resistant or partially responsive to octreotide long-acting release (octreotide-LAR) or lanreotide therapy in vivo and expressing SSTR(1) mRNA. In addition, the inhibiting effect of BIM-23745 on the GH secretion was compared with that of octreotide. Our data demonstrate that (1) SSTR(1) receptor was present in 56.25% (9/16) of the GH-secreting adenomas examined; (2) in all GH-secreting pituitary tumors that expressed SSTR(1), BIM-23745 significantly inhibited GH secretion in vitro, and (3) when SSTR(1) subtype was present in tumors from patients resistant to octreotide-LAR or lanreotide therapy, BIM-23745 was able to inhibit the in vitro GH secretion. In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that SS analogs selective for the SSTR(1) may represent a further useful approach for the treatment of acromegaly in patients resistant or partially responsive to octreotide-LAR or lanreotide treatment in vivo.

Endometrial tissue was implanted onto the abdominal peritoneum of 26 rats that were randomized into 3 groups. The rats in group 1(n = 9) were subcutaneously administered with 0.02 mg/kg/d of octreotide (a short-acting analog)for 28 days . The rats in group 2 (n = 8) were subcutaneously injected with 20 mg/kg of a single dose of a long-acting analogue lanreotide The rats in group 3 were given no medication and served as controls (n = 9). Mean volume and histologic score of implants in groups 1 (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively) and 2 (P < .01and P < .05, respectively) were significantly lower than that in group 3. There were significant reductions in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) immunoreactivities in group 1 (0.67 Â± 0.50 and 1.22 Â± 0.44, respectively; both P < .01) and group 2 (0.71 Â± 0.48 and 0.86 Â± 0.69, respectively; both P < .01) when compared with the control group (1.78 Â± 0.83 and 2.11 Â± 0.78, respectively). Somatostatin analogs has regressed significantly the size of the endometriotic implants and caused atrophy of these lesions in rats by decreasing explant levels of VEGF and MMP-9.\n\nEffect of a long-acting analogue of somatostatin, SMS 201-995, on the development of intestinal tumours in azoxymethane-treated rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nSavage, A P; Matthews, J L; Adrian, T E; Ghatei, M A; Cooke, T; Bloom, S R\n\n1987-04-01\n\nThe effect of daily parenteral administration of a long-acting analogue of somatostatin (SMS 201-995) on the development of intestinal tumours and the rate of crypt cell proliferation in azoxymethane-treated rats has been studied. SMS 201-995 had no significant effect on the number of colonic tumours induced. In the duodenum, SMS 201-995 administration was associated with a change in the number of tumours from 1.4/rat in saline-treated animals to 2.4/rat in animals treated for the last third of the study and 2.8/rat in animals treated with SMS for the entire duration of the study (P less than 0.02). SMS had no significant effect on the rate of cell proliferation in the duodenum, ileum or colon. The inhibition of release of gastrointestinal trophic hormones by this analogue of somatostatin thus does not appear to reduce the number of tumours in the intestine of azoxymethane-treated rats.\n\nExperience with indium-111 and yttrium-90-labeled somatostatin analogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nVirgolini, I; Traub, T; Novotny, C; Leimer, M; FÃ¼ger, B; Li, S R; Patri, P; Pangerl, T; Angelberger, P; Raderer, M; Burggasser, G; Andreae, F; Kurtaran, A; Dudczak, R\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe high level expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTR) on various tumor cells has provided the molecular basis for successful use of radiolabeled octreotide / lanreotide analogs as tumor tracers in nuclear medicine. Other (nontumoral) potential indications for SSTR scintigraphy are based on an increased lymphocyte binding at sites of inflammatory or immunologic diseases such as thyroid-associated ophthalmology. The vast majority of human tumors seem to over-express the one or the other of five distinct hSSTR subtype receptors. Whereas neuroendocrine tumors frequently overexpress hSSTR2, intestinal adenocarcinomas seem to overexpress more often hSSTR3 or hSSTR4, or both of these hSSTR. In contrast to In-DTPA-DPhe(1)-octreotide (OctreoScan(R)) which binds to hSSTR2 and 5 with high affinity (Kd 0.1-5 nM), to hSSTR3 with moderate affinity (K(d) 10-100 nM) and does not bind to hSSTR1 and hSSTR4, (111)In / (90)Y-DOTA-lanreotide was found to bind to hSSTR2, 3, 4, and 5 with high affinity, and to hSSTR1 with lower affinity (K(d) 200 nM). Based on its unique hSSTR binding profile, (111)In-DOTA-lanreotide was suggested to be a potential radioligand for tumor diagnosis, and (90)Y-DOTA-lanreotide suitable for receptor-mediated radionuclide therapy. As opposed to (111)In-DTPA-DPhe(1)-octreotide and (111)In-DOTA-DPhe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide, discrepancies in the scintigraphic results were seen in about one third of (neuroendocrine) tumor patients concerning both the tumor uptake as well as detection of tumor lesions. On a molecular level, these discrepancies seem to be based on a \"higherrdquuo; high-affinity binding of (111)In-DOTA-DPhe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide to hSSTR2 (K(d) 0.1-1 nM). Other somatostatin analogs with divergent affinity to the five known hSSTR subtype receptors have also found their way into the clinics, such as (99m)Tc-depreotide (NeoSpect(R); NeoTect(R)).

These substances are usually responsible for the distinct clinical features observed in patients with such tumors. Although most are relatively slow growing tumors, they may lead in early stages to dramatic symptoms such as hypoglycemia, gastric ulcerations, or watery diarrhea. Unfortunately they are often difficult to localize precisely at that stage. Somatostatin, a tetradecapeptide that inhibits peptide hormone release in various sites such as the pituitary, the pancreas, and the gastrointestinal tract, hasmoreÂ Â» been shown recently to have beneficial effects when given chronically in the form of a stable non-degradable octapeptide analogue (SMS 201-995) in such gastrointestinal endocrine tumors. This essay demonstrates with autoradiographic techniques the very high density of somatostatin receptors in one case of human gastrinoma. A hematoxylineosin-stained histologic section reveals a well-defined, 2-mm-long tumor surrounded by normal tissue. After incubation of the section with an iodinated somatostatin analogue (/sup 125/I-(Leu, D-Trp, Tyr)-somatostatin-28), the distribution of somatostatin receptors was visualized on tritium-sensitive films after a one-week exposure of the section in x-ray cassettes.Â«Â less\n\nClinical applications of somatostatin analogs for growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Ji-wen; Li, Ying; Mao, Zhi-gang; Hu, Bin; Jiang, Xiao-bing; Song, Bing-bing; Wang, Xin; Zhu, Yong-hong; Wang, Hai-jun\n\n2014-01-01\n\nExcessive growth hormone (GH) is usually secreted by GH-secreting pituitary adenomas and causes gigantism in juveniles or acromegaly in adults. The clinical complications involving cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic systems lead to elevated morbidity in acromegaly. Control of serum GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 hypersecretion by surgery or pharmacotherapy can decrease morbidity. Current pharmacotherapy includes somatostatin analogs (SAs) and GH receptor antagonist; the former consists of lanreotide Autogel (ATG) and octreotide long-acting release (LAR), and the latter refers to pegvisomant. As primary medical therapy, lanreotide ATG and octreotide LAR can be supplied in a long-lasting formulation to achieve biochemical control of GH and IGF-1 by subcutaneous injection every 4â6 weeks. Lanreotide ATG and octreotide LAR provide an effective medical treatment, whether as a primary or secondary therapy, for the treatment of GH-secreting pituitary adenoma; however, to maximize benefits with the least cost, several points should be emphasized before the application of SAs. A comprehensive assessment, especially of the observation of clinical predictors and preselection of SA treatment, should be completed in advance. A treatment process lasting at least 3 months should be implemented to achieve a long-term stable blood concentration. More satisfactory surgical outcomes for noninvasive macroadenomas treated with presurgical SA may be achieved, although controversy of such adjuvant therapy exists. Combination of SA and pegvisomant or cabergoline shows advantages in some specific cases. Thus, an individual treatment program should be established for each patient under a full evaluation of the risks and benefits.

This produced dramatic improvement in their endocrine related symptoms, in association with a fall in circulating tumour peptides. One of these patients has now been treated for seven months with this analogue which has controlled his previously life threatening diarrhoea caused by a malignant VIP secreting tumour. He gives his own injections twice daily, and has returned to a full and active life. This is a promising agent both for acute treatment of peptide hypersecretion, and for the long term management of some patients who are unresponsive to other available therapy.\n\nEffect of long acting somatostatin-analogue, SMS 201 995, on gut hormone secretion in normal subjects.\n\nPubMed\n\nKraenzlin, M E; Wood, S M; Neufeld, M; Adrian, T E; Bloom, S R\n\n1985-06-15\n\nSMS 201 995 is a new long acting analogue of somatostatin.

Except for the usual brief discomfort of an injection, no symptoms or untoward effects were observed.\n\nRole of somatostatin and its analogues in the treatment of acute and chronic pancreatitis.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBÃ¼chler, M W; Binder, M; Friess, H\n\n1994-01-01\n\nAcute pancreatitis is caused by the activation of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and a possible treatment, therefore, is the inhibition of enzyme secretion. This approach is somewhat controversial, however, as it is not clear whether pancreatic secretion continues to occur during the course of acute pancreatitis. Animal studies show an appreciable reduction of secretion in the inflamed pancreas, but studies in humans are not conclusive. The use of somatostatin or its analogue, octreotide, has been investigated in several clinical studies. A meta analysis of six individual studies in which somatostatin was given for acute pancreatitis showed that somatostatin significantly reduces mortality. A trial in patients with moderate to severe acute pancreatitis showed a lower rate (although not statistically significant) of complications in patients treated with 3 x 200 and 3 x 500 micrograms/day octreotide, compared with controls and patients receiving a lower dose of octreotide. A further study showed a significant reduction in patient controlled analgesics in patients treated with octreotide compared with controls. Pain is the important clinical symptom of chronic pancreatitis, possibly resulting from an increased intraductal pressure during secretion. The effect on pain of the inhibition of pancreatic secretion by octreotide has been investigated in two studies. One showed no significant reduction in pain after treatment with octreotide for three days. In the other, in which octreotide was used for three weeks, significantly less pain and analgesic use was recorded during octreotide treatment than during placebo. The most common complication of chronic pancreatitis is the formation of pseudocysts. There is some evidence that octreotide may be useful in their treatment.

SST-14, SST-28, and peptide analogs (octreotide, lanreotide, and vapreotide) stimulated clathrin- and dynamin-mediated internalization of SSTR2A, which colocalized with ECE-1 in endosomes and the Golgi. After incubation with SST-14, SSTR2A recycled to the plasma membrane, which required active ECE-1 and an intact Golgi.

Since their molecular cloning, the role of PTPs is emerging as a major regulator of different cell functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, cell to cell interactions, cell matrix adhesion and cell migration. It was demonstrated that PTPs possess high substrate specificity and their activity is tightly regulated. Importantly, different G protein-coupled receptors transduce their biological activities through PTPs. PTPs were identified as down-stream effectors of SSTRs to transduce antiproliferative signals, and so far, three family members (SHP-1, SHP-2 and DEP-1/PTPeta) have been identified as selective SSTR intracellular effectors. Here, the molecular mechanisms leading SSTRs to regulate PTP activity are discussed, focusing on recent data showing a close interplay between PTPs and tyrosine kinases to transduce tumoral cell growth arrest following SST analogs administration.\n\nNovel, potent, and radio-iodinatable somatostatin receptor 1 (sst1) selective analogues.\n\nPubMed\n\nErchegyi, Judit; Cescato, Renzo; Grace, Christy Rani R; Waser, Beatrice; Piccand, VÃ©ronique; Hoyer, Daniel; Riek, Roland; Rivier, Jean E; Reubi, Jean Claude\n\n2009-05-14\n\nThe proposed sst(1) pharmacophore (J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 523-533) derived from the NMR structures of a family of mono- and dicyclic undecamers was used to design octa-, hepta-, and hexamers with high affinity and selectivity for the somatostatin sst(1) receptor. These compounds were tested for their in vitro binding properties to all five somatostatin (SRIF) receptors using receptor autoradiography; those with high SRIF receptor subtype 1 (sst(1)) affinity and selectivity were shown to be agonists when tested functionally in a luciferase reporter gene assay. Des-AA(1,4-6,10,12,13)-[DTyr(2),DAgl(NMe,2naphthoyl)(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF-Thr-NH(2) (25) was radio-iodinated ((125)I-25) and specifically labeled sst(1)-expressing cells and tissues. 3D NMR structures were calculated for des-AA(1,4-6,10,12,13)-[DPhe(2),DTrp(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF-Thr-NH(2) (16), des-AA(1,2,4-6,10,12,13)-[DAgl(NMe,2naphthoyl)(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF-Thr-NH(2) (23), and des-AA(1,2,4-6,10,12,13)-[DAgl(NMe,2naphthoyl)(8),IAmp(9),Tyr(11)]-SRIF-NH(2) (27) in DMSO.

The motor effects of somatostatin-14 (SRIF), and several SRIF peptide analogues were investigated on the rat isolated distal colon. The objective of these studies was to characterize the receptor mediating the contractile action of SRIF by comparing the relative agonist potencies of a range of SRIF analogues. 2. SRIF (1 nM-1 microM) produced concentration-dependent contractions with an EC50 value of approximately 10 nM. Contractile responses induced by SRIF were insensitive to atropine (1 microM) or naloxone (1 microM) but abolished by tetrodotoxin (1 microM). Somatostatin-28 (SRIF28), also induced concentration-dependent contractions and was equipotent with SRIF. Phosphoramidon (1 microM) and amastatin (10 microM) did not increase the potency of either SRIF or SRIF28. 3. The SRIF peptide analogues, octreotide, SRIF25, seglitide, angiopeptin and CGP23996 (1 nM-1 microM) produced contractile responses in the rat distal colon, each having similar potency and maximal activity relative to SRIF. The SSTR2 receptor-selective hexapeptide, BIM23027 (0.1 nM-1 microM), and the SRIF stereoisomer, D-Trp8-SRIF (0.1 nM-1 microM), were the most potent agonists examined being approximately 12 and 7 times more potent than SRIF, respectively. In contrast, the SSTR5 receptor-selective analogue, L362,855, was approximately 120 times weaker than SRIF, whilst the SSTR3 receptor-selective analogue, BIM23056, was inactive at concentrations up to 3 microM. 4. The putative SRIF receptor antagonist, (cyclo(7-aminoheptanoyl Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr[Bzl]))(CPP) (1 microM), had no agonist activity and had no effect on contractions induced by SRIF. 5. The contractile actions of BIM23027 and seglitide were subject to pronounced desensitization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) PMID:7834217\n\nPreclinical evaluation of [99mTc/EDDA/tricine/HYNIC0, 1-Nal3, Thr8]-octreotide as a new analogue in the detection of somatostatin-receptor-positive tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nGandomkar, Mostafa; Najafi, Reza; Shafiei, Mohammad; Mazidi, Mohammad; Ebrahimi, Sayed Esmaeil Sadat\n\n2007-08-01\n\nRadiolabeled somatostatin analogues are important tools for the in vivo localization and targeted radionuclide therapy of somatostatin-receptor-positive tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate a new somatostatin analogue designed for the labeling with (99m)Tc: [6-hydrazinopyridine-3-carboxylic acid (HYNIC(0)), 1-Nal(3), Thr(8)]-octreotide ([HYNIC]-NATE), using ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (EDDA) and tricine as coligands. Synthesis was preformed on a solid phase using a standard Fmoc strategy. Labeling with (99m)Tc was performed at 100 degrees C for 10 min using SnCl(2) as a reductant. Radiochemical analysis involved ITLC and high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Peptide conjugate affinity was determined in AR4-2J cell membranes. The internalization and externalization rates were studied in sstr(2)-expressing AR4-2J cells. Biodistribution of radiopeptide was studied in rats bearing the AR4-2J tumor. Radiolabeling was performed at high specific activities, and radiochemical purity was >95%. Peptide conjugate showed high affinity binding for sstr(2). The radioligand showed a moderate and specific internalization into AR4-2J cells (14.13+/-0.61% at 4 h). In animal biodistribution studies, a receptor-specific uptake of radioactivity was observed in somatostatin-receptor-positive organs. After 4 h, uptake in the AR4-2J tumor was 1.33+/-0.23%ID/g (percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue). These data show that [(99m)Tc/EDDA/tricine/HYNIC]-NATE is a specific radioligand for the somatostatin-receptor-positive tumors and is a suitable candidate for clinical studies.\n\nTruncated somatostatin receptor 5 may modulate therapy response to somatostatin analogues--Observations in two patients with acromegaly and severe headache.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarina, Djordje; Burman, Pia; Klose, Marianne; Casar-Borota, Olivera; Luque, RaÃºl M; CastaÃ±o, Justo P; Feldt-Rasmussen, Ulla\n\n2015-10-01\n\nSomatotropinomas have unique \"fingerprints\" of somatostatin receptor (sst) expression, which are targets in treatment of acromegaly with somatostatin analogues (SSAs). However, a significant expression of sst is not always related to the biochemical response to SSAs. Headache is a common complaint in acromegaly and considered a clinical marker of disease activity. SSAs are reported to have an own analgesic effect, but the sst involved are unknown. We investigated sst expression in two acromegalic patients with severe headache and no biochemical effects of octreotide, but a good response to pasireotide. We searched the literature for determinants of biochemical and analgesic effects of SSAs in somatotropinomas. Case 1 had no biochemical or analgesic effects of octreotide, a semi-selective SSA, but a rapid and significant effect of pasireotide, a pan-SSA. Case 2 demonstrated discordance between analgesic and biochemical effects of octreotide, in that headache disappeared, but without biochemical improvement. In contrast, pasireotide normalized insulin-like growth factor 1. Both adenomas were sparsely granulated and had strong membranous expressions of sst2a in 50-75% and sst5 in 75-100% of tumor cells. The truncated sst5 variant TMD4 (sst5TMD4) showed expression in 20-57% of tumor cells. A poor biochemical response to octreotide may be associated with tumor expression of a truncated sst5 variant, despite abundant sst2a expression, suggesting an influence from variant sst5 on common sst signaling pathways. Furthermore, unrelated analgesic and biochemical effects of SSAs supported a complex pathogenesis of acromegaly-associated headache. Finally, assessment of truncated sst5 in addition to full length sst could be important for a choice of postoperative SSA treatment in somatotropinomas. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

At baseline from our combination therapy, his prostate-specific antigen level was 21.30 ng/mL and serum chromogranin A level was 816 ng/mL. The patient discontinued complete androgen deprivation therapy and underwent combination therapy with oral estramustine 420 mg/day plus lanreotide acetate 73.9 mg intramuscularly every 4 weeks. After 33 months of follow-up, the patient was alive without clinical disease progression, and his prostate-specific antigen and chromogranin A level was 0.10 and 12 ng/mL, respectively.\n\nLanreotide in the treatment of patients with thyroid eye disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrassas, G E; Kaltsas, T; Dumas, A; Pontikides, N; Tolis, G\n\n1997-04-01\n\nOctreotide, a potent synthetic somatostatin (SM) analogue, was recently evaluated and found to have a beneficial effect in thyroid eye disease (TED), mostly in those patients with a positive Octreoscan-111. Lanreotide (LRT; Somatuline-Ipsen), a new SM long-acting analogue, is more active than natural SM and shows a much longer duration of action. The aim of the present preliminary study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LRT in the treatment of TED. Five patients, three males and two females, mean age 50.6 +/- 7.6 S.D. (45-64) years, all with severe symptoms of TED were studied. A similar number of patients, matched for age, sex and severity of ophthalmopathy served as controls. All the patients and controls were investigated with orbital scintigraphy using 111 In DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide (Octreoscan-111) and selected on the basis of positive octreoscan. The NOSPECS system, as adapted by Donaldson et al. (Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 1973 37 276-285) and a disease activity score, as proposed recently by an International Workshop, have been followed in this study in order to evaluate the response to treatment. The five patients who comprised the treatment group received 0.04 g LRT i.m. once every 2 weeks over a period of 3 months, after which the Octreoscan-111 was repeated. The control patients were given an injection of water i.m., also once every 2 weeks for 3 months, after which they were evaluated clinically. No Octreoscan-111 was performed in the controls. All patients and controls were evaluated by the same physician, who was unaware of the type of treatment used. A decrease in the NOSPECS score and the clinical activity score was regarded as a positive response, while no change or an increase in the NOSPECS score along with no clinical improvement was regarded as a negative response. After 3 months of treatment with LRT, four patients showed a statistically significant improvement in ophthalmopathy in both eyes and one in one eye\n\nPeripheral nervous system assessment in acromegaly patients under somatostatin analogue therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlibas, H; Gogas Yavuz, D; Kahraman Koytak, P; Uygur, M; Tanridag, T; Uluc, K\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAcromegaly is known to affect peripheral nervous system (PNS) causing carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and polyneuropathy. The frequency of these disorders and the evaluation methods vary among studies. In the present study, we aimed to examine PNS of acromegaly patients under somatostatin analogue (SSA) therapy. Forty-eight acromegaly patients (26 F/22Â M, 45.58Â Â±Â 11.6Â years) under SSA treatment and 44 healthy controls (25 F/19Â M, 47.46Â Â±Â 8.7Â years) were assessed by symptom questionnaires, neurologic examination and electrophysiological studies. 87.5Â % of the acromegaly patients had at least one abnormal finding regarding PNS. With the incorporation of palm-wrist median nerve conduction velocity method, we detected CTS in 50Â % of patients. Polyneuropathy was less frequent (29.2Â %). Both conditions were independent from the coexisting diabetes mellitus (pÂ =Â 0.22 for CTS, pÂ =Â 0.71 for polyneuropathy). Polyneuropathy but not CTS was more common among biochemically uncontrolled acromegaly patients rather than those under control (pÂ =Â 0.03; pÂ =Â 0.68, respectively). Our findings emphasize the high prevalence of peripheral nervous system involvement in acromegaly patients under SSA therapy and importance of neurological evaluation of these patients. Early diagnosis and treatment of the disease may reduce the PNS involvement.\n\nSafety, Pharmacokinetics and Dosimetry of a Long-Acting Radiolabeled Somatostatin Analogue 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE in Patients with Advanced Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Jingjing; Wang, Hao; Jacobson Weiss, Orit; Cheng, Yuejuan; Niu, Gang; Li, Fang; Bai, Chunmei; Zhu, Zhaohui; Chen, Xiaoyuan\n\n2018-04-13\n\nRadiolabeled somatostatin analogue therapy has become an established treatment method for patients with well to moderately differentiated unresectable or metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The most frequently used somatostatin analogues in clinical practice are octreotide and octreotate. However, both peptides showed suboptimal retention within tumors. The aim of this first-in-human study is to explore the safety and dosimetry of a long-acting radiolabeled somatostatin analogue, lutetium-177-1, 4, 7, 10-tetra-azacyclododecane-1, 4, 7, 10-tetraacetic acid-Evans blue-octreotate ( 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE). Methods: Eight patients (6 males and 2 females; age range, 27-61 y) with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors were recruited. Five patients received a single dose 0.35-0.70 GBq (9.5-18.9 mCi) of 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE and underwent serial whole body planar and single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) scans at 2, 24, 72, 120 and 168 h after injection. The other 3 patients received intravenous injection of 0.28-0.41 GBq (7.5-11.1 mCi) of 177 Lu-DOTATATE for the same imaging acquisition procedures at 1, 3, 4, 24 and 72 h after injection. The dosimetry was calculated using the OLINDA/EXM 1.1 software. Results: Administration of 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE was well tolerated, with no adverse symptoms being noticed or reported in any of the patients. Compared with 177 Lu-DOTATATE, 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE showed extended circulation in the blood and achieved 7.9-fold increase of tumor dose delivery. The total body effective doses were 0.205 Â± 0.161 mSv/MBq for 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE and 0.174 Â± 0.072 mSv/MBq for 177 Lu-DOTATATE. Significant dose delivery increases to the kidneys and bone marrow were also observed in patients receiving 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE than those receiving 177 Lu-DOTATATE (3.2 and 18.2-fold, respectively). Conclusion: By introducing an albumin binding moiety, 177 Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE showed remarkably higher uptake and retention in NET\n\nSomatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism: Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in AD\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTundo, Grazia; Ciaccio, Chiara; Sbardella, Diego; Boraso, Mariaserena; Viviani, Barbara; Coletta, Massimiliano; Marini, Stefano\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe deposition of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting AÎ², and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy. We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells. A similar effect can also "
