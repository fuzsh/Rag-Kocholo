        "text": "Differential diagnosis of orofacial pain and temporomandibular disorder.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumar, Anil; Brennan, Michael T\n\n2013-07-01\n\nWhen a patient complains of orofacial pain, health care providers must make a correct diagnosis. Doing this can be difficult, since various signs and symptoms may not be specific for 1 particular problem or disorder. One initially should formulate a broad differential diagnosis that can be narrowed after analysis of the history and examination. In this article, orofacial pain is categorized as being caused by: intracranial pain, headaches, neuropathic pain, intraoral pain, temporomandibular disorder, cervical pain, pain related to anatomically associated structures, referred pain, or mental illness.

Many of these lesions can be clinically interpreted before surgery as adnexal or uterine neoplasms. Although some lesions are similar to those arising in other mÃ¼llerian sites, there are unique lesions as well. The lesions are uncommon and may prove challenging to clinicians. The purpose was to review the scope of lesions affecting the broad ligament. A literature review was conducted. A Medline search was performed using the terms broad ligament, mesosalpinx, and mesovarium. A review of the scope of broad ligament lesions is presented to assist in developing a differential diagnosis if a patient with such a lesion is encountered. Copyright Â© 2015 AAGL.

A diagnosis of chronic hepatitis is usually made when inflammation and liver cell necrosis persist for longer than 6 months. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic patients to those with advanced hepatic failure. Both sexes and all age groups are affected. Chronic hepatitis may emerge as a sequelae of hepatitis C and less often after hepatitis B. Both diseases are treatable and require rapid and exact diagnosis. The differential diagnosis must exclude autoimmune hepatitis, chronic steatohepatitis, congenital metabolic hepatopathies and drug-induced hepatopathies. Laboratory tests, histologic investigations and clinical differential diagnosis must exclude other causes of chronic liver disease.\n\nDiagnosis and Differential Diagnosis of Hydrocephalus inÂ Adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nLangner, SÃ¶nke; Fleck, Steffen; Baldauf, JÃ¶rg; Mensel, Birger; KÃ¼hn, Jens Peter; Kirsch, Michael\n\n2017-08-01\n\nPurpose âHydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance of production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or obstruction of its pathways, resulting in ventricular dilatation and increased intracranial pressure. Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and planning of treatment. Methods âThis review article presents the different types of hydrocephalus und their typical imaging appearance, describes imaging techniques, and discusses differential diagnoses of the different forms of hydrocephalus. Results and Conclusion âImaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of hydrocephalus. While magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the first-line imaging modality, computed tomography (CT) is often the first-line imaging test in emergency patients. Key points â Â· Occlusive hydrocephalus is caused by obstruction of CSF pathways.. Â· Malabsorptive hydrocephalus is caused by impaired CSF absorption.. Â· The MR imaging protocol should always include sagittal high-resolution T2-weighted images.. Â· When an inflammatory etiology is suspected, imaging with contrast agent administration is necessary..

They affect nearly 80 thousand of Brazilians. In recent years, the increased scientific knowledge on NF has allowed better clinical management and reduced complication morbidity, resulting in higher quality of life for NF patients. In most cases, neurology, psychiatry, dermatology, clinical geneticists, oncology and internal medicine specialists are able to make the differential diagnosis between NF and other diseases and to identify major NF complications. Nevertheless, due to its great variability in phenotype expression, progressive course, multiple organs involvement and unpredictable natural evolution, NF often requires the support of neurofibromatoses specialists for proper treatment and genetic counseling. This Part 1 offers step-by-step guidelines for NF differential diagnosis. Part 2 will present the NF clinical management.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis: a consensus approach\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiller, DH; Weinshenker, BG; Filippi, M; Banwell, BL; Cohen, JA; Freedman, MS; Galetta, SL; Hutchinson, M; Johnson, RT; Kappos, L; Kira, J; Lublin, FD; McFarland, HF; Montalban, X; Panitch, H; Richert, JR; Reingold, SC; Polman, CH\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground and objectives Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) requires exclusion of diseases that could better explain the clinical and paraclinical findings. A systematic process for exclusion of alternative diagnoses has not been defined. An International Panel of MS experts developed consensus perspectives on MS differential diagnosis. Methods Using available literature and consensus, we developed guidelines for MS differential diagnosis, focusing on exclusion of potential MS mimics, diagnosis of common initial isolated clinical syndromes, and differentiating between MS and non-MS idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases. Results We present recommendations for 1) clinical and paraclinical red flags suggesting alternative diagnoses to MS; 2) more precise definition of âclinically isolated syndromesâ (CIS), often the first presentations of MS or its alternatives; 3) algorithms for diagnosis of three common CISs related to MS in the optic nerves, brainstem, and spinal cord; and 4) a classification scheme and diagnosis criteria for idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system. Conclusions Differential diagnosis leading to MS or alternatives is complex and a strong evidence base is lacking. Consensus-determined guidelines provide a practical path for diagnosis and will be useful for the non-MS specialist neurologist. Recommendations are made for future research to validate and support these guidelines. Guidance on the differential diagnosis process when MS is under consideration will enhance diagnostic accuracy and precision.

Molecular analysis by PCR and sequencing represents the only reliable tool to date to identify these parasites to the species level. Due to the recent spread of human diphyllobothriosis in several countries, a correct diagnosis has become crucial to better understand the distribution and the life cycle of human-infecting species as well as to prevent the introduction of parasites to disease-free water systems. Nevertheless, PCR and sequencing, although highly precise, are too complicated, long, and expensive to be employed in medical laboratories for routine diagnostics. In the present study we optimized a cheap and rapid molecular test for the differential identification of the most common Diphyllobothrium species infecting humans (D. latum, D. dendriticum, D. nihonkaiense, and D. pacificum), based on a multiplex PCR with the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene of mitochondrial DNA.

Fifty-six CSF samples from 46 patients were studied during the year 1995. Genes coding for bacterial 16S and/or 23S rRNA genes could be amplified from the CSF samples from five patients with a clinical picture consistent with acute bacterial meningitis. For these patients, the sequenced PCR product shared 98.3 to 100% homology with the Neisseria meningitidis sequence. For one patient, the diagnosis was initially made by PCR alone. Of the remaining 51 CSF samples, for 50 (98.0%) samples the negative PCR findings were in accordance with the negative findings by bacterial culture and Gram staining, as well as with the eventual clinical diagnosis for the patient. However, the PCR test failed to detect the bacterial rRNA gene in one CSF sample, the culture of which yielded Listeria monocytogenes. These results invite new research efforts to be focused on the application of PCR with broad-range bacterial primers to improve the etiologic diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. In a clinical setting, Gram staining and bacterial culture still remain the cornerstones of diagnosis.

The theme of this paper is the differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia. Schneiderian first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia are common in dissociative disorders, especially in dissociative identity disorder (DID). Many DID patients have been misdiagnosed as schizophrenics and treated with neuroleptics. We compared and examined Schneiderian symptoms of schizophrenia and those of dissociative disorders from a structural viewpoint. In dissociative disorders, delusional perception and somatic passivity are not seen. \"Lateness\" and \"Precedence of the Other\" originated from the concept of \"Pattern Reversal\" (H. Yasunaga)\" is characteristic of schizophrenia. It is important to check these basic structure of schizophrenia in subjective experiences in differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia.\n\nSpecific phobias in older adults: characteristics and differential diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nCoelho, Carlos M; GonÃ§alves, Daniela C; Purkis, Helena; Pocinho, Margarida; Pachana, Nancy A; Byrne, Gerard J\n\n2010-08-01\n\nDifferential diagnosis implies identifying shared and divergent characteristics between clinical states. Clinical work with older adults demands not only the knowledge of nosological features associated with differential diagnosis, but also recognition of idiosyncratic factors associated with this population. Several factors can interfere with an accurate diagnosis of specific phobia in older cohorts. The goal of this paper is to review criteria for specific phobia and its differential diagnosis with panic disorder, agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder, while stressing the specific factors associated with aging. A literature search regarding specific phobia in older adults was carried out using PubMed. Relevant articles were selected and scanned for further pertinent references. In addition, relevant references related to differential diagnosis and assessment were used. Etiologic factors, specificity of feared stimulus or situation, fear predictability and the nature of phobic situations are key points to be assessed when implementing a differential diagnosis of specific phobia. First, age-related sensory impairments are common and interfere both with information processing and communication. Second, medical illnesses create symptoms that might cause, interfere with, or mimic anxiety. Third, cohort effects might result in underreporting, through the inability to communicate or recognize anxiety symptoms, misattributing them to physical conditions. Finally, diagnostic criteria and screening instruments were usually developed using younger samples and are therefore not adapted to the functional and behavioral characteristics of older samples.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis of Jakob-Creutzfeldt Disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPaterson, Ross W.; Torres-Chae, Charles C.; Kuo, Amy L.; Ando, Tim; Nguyen, Elizabeth A.; Wong, Katherine; DeArmond, Stephen J.; Haman, Aissa; Garcia, Paul; Johnson, David Y.; Miller, Bruce L.; Geschwind, Michael D.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives To identify the misdiagnoses of patients with sporadic Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (sCJD) during the course of their disease and determine which medical specialties saw patients with sCJD prior to the correct diagnosis being made and at what point in the disease course a correct diagnosis was made. Design Retrospective medical record review. Setting A specialty referral center of a tertiary academic medical center. Participants One hundred sixty-three serial patients over a 5.5-year period who ultimately had pathologically proven sCJD. The study used the subset of 97 patients for whom we had adequate medical records. Main Outcome Measures Other diagnoses considered in the differential diagnosis and types of medical specialties assessing patients with sCJD. Results Ninety-seven subjectsâ records were used in the final analysis. The most common disease categories of misdiagnosis were neurodegenerative, autoimmune/paraneoplastic, infectious, and toxic/metabolic disorders. The most common individual misdiagnoses were viral encephalitis, paraneoplastic disorder, depression, vertigo, Alzheimer disease, stroke, unspecified dementia, central nervous system vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, and Hashimoto encephalopathy. The physicians who most commonly made these misdiagnoses were primary care physicians and neurologists; in the 18% of patients who were diagnosed correctly at their first assessment, the diagnosis was almost always by a neurologist. The mean time from onset to diagnosis was 7.9 months, an average of two-thirds of the way through their disease course. Conclusions Diagnosis of sCJD is quite delayed. When evaluating patients with rapidly progressive dementia with suspected neurodegenerative, autoimmune, infectious, or toxic/metabolic etiology, sCJD should also be included in the differential diagnosis, and appropriate diagnostic tests, such as diffusion brain magnetic resonance imaging, should be considered. Primary care physicians and neurologists\n\nOrbital inflammatory disease: Pictorial review and differential diagnosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPakdaman, Michael N; Sepahdari, Ali R; Elkhamary, Sahar M\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOrbital inflammatory disease (OID) represents a collection of inflammatory conditions affecting the orbit. OID is a diagnosis of exclusion, with the differential diagnosis including infection, systemic inflammatory conditions, and neoplasms, among other conditions. Inflammatory conditions in OID include dacryoadenitis, myositis, cellulitis, optic perineuritis, periscleritis, orbital apicitis, and a focal mass. Sclerosing orbital inflammation is a rare condition with a chronic, indolent course involving dense fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltrate. Previously thought to be along the spectrum of OID, it is now considered a distinct pathologic entity. Imaging plays an important role in elucidating any underlying etiology behind orbital inflammation and is critical for ruling out other conditions prior to a definitive diagnosis of OID. In this review, we will explore the common sites of involvement by OID and discuss differential diagnosis by site and key imaging findings for each condition.

The model is a response to a number of requirements, ranging from incorporating essential clinical diagnostic semantics to the integration of data mining for the process of identifying candidate diseases that best explain a set of clinical features. We introduce two major components, which we find essential to the construction of an integral differential diagnosis recommendation model: the evidence-based recommender component and the proximity-based recommender component. Both approaches are driven by disease diagnosis ontologies designed specifically to enable the process of generating diagnostic recommendations. These ontologies are the disease symptom ontology and the patient ontology. The evidence-based diagnosis process develops dynamic rules based on standardized clinical pathways. The proximity-based component employs data mining to provide clinicians with diagnosis predictions, as well as generates new diagnosis rules from provided training datasets. This article describes the integration between these two components along with the developed diagnosis ontologies to form a novel medical differential diagnosis recommendation model. This article also provides test cases from the implementation of the overall model, which shows quite promising diagnostic recommendation results.\n\nThe value of electrocardiography for differential diagnosis in wide QRS complex tachycardia.\n\nPubMed\n\nSousa, Pedro A; Pereira, SalomÃ©; Candeias, Rui; de Jesus, IlÃ­dio\n\n2014-03-01\n\nCorrect diagnosis in wide QRS complex tachycardia remains a challenge. Differential diagnosis between ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia has important therapeutic and prognostic implications, and although data from clinical history and physical examination may suggest a particular origin, it is the 12-lead surface electrocardiogram that usually enables this differentiation. Since 1978, various electrocardiographic criteria have been proposed for the differential diagnosis of wide complex tachycardias, particularly the presence of atrioventricular dissociation, and the axis, duration and morphology of QRS complexes. Despite the wide variety of criteria, diagnosis is still often difficult, and errors can have serious consequences. To reduce such errors, several differential diagnosis algorithms have been proposed since 1991. However, in a small percentage of wide QRS tachycardias the diagnosis remains uncertain and in these the wisest decision is to treat them as ventricular tachycardias. The authors' objective was to review the main electrocardiographic criteria and differential diagnosis algorithms of wide QRS tachycardia. Copyright Â© 2012 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

Recent findings There is an increase of reported cases of FPIES in recent years. As the disease presents with nonspecific symptoms, it can be misunderstood in many ways. The differential diagnosis includes, in acute presentations, the following: sepsis, other infectious diseases, acute gastrointestinal episodes, surgical emergencies, food allergies. In its chronic forms, FPIES may mimic malabsorption syndromes, metabolic disorders, primary immunodeficiencies, neurological conditions, coagulation defects, and other types of non-IgE-mediated food allergy. Summary A thorough clinical evaluation, including symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings, is necessary to lead the clinicians toward the diagnosis of FPIES. The major reason for delayed diagnosis appears to be the lack of knowledge of the disease.

Recent findings There is a continuous expansion of the number of cell surface or synaptic proteins that are targets of autoimmunity. The most recently identified include the mGluR5, DPPX, and the GABAAR. In these and previously known autoimmune encephalitis (NMDAR, AMPAR, GABABR, LGI1, CASPR2), the prodromal symptoms or types of presentations often suggest a viral encephalitis. We review here clues that help in the differential diagnosis with infectious encephalitis. Moreover, recent investigations indicate that viral encephalitis (e.g., herpes simplex) can trigger synaptic autoimmunity. In all these disorders immunotherapy is usually effective. Summary Autoimmune encephalitis comprises an expanding group of potentially treatable disorders that should be included in the differential diagnosis of any type of encephalitis.

In the differential count there was a shift to the left and an increase of monocyte-like cells (35%). Differential diagnosis included leucemoid reaction, infectious mononucleosis, myelo-proliferative disorder with a missing C chromosome and chronic myeloid leucemia. Clinical symptoms, cytochemistry and caryotype of bone marrow cells suggested infantile chronic myeloic leucemia and normal ALP index and possibly normal HbF. Treatment with 6-mercaptopurine was followed by partial remission. The therapeutic consequences of exact differential diagnosis are discussed.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging differential diagnosis of brainstem lesions in children\n\nPubMed Central\n\nQuattrocchi, Carlo Cosimo; Errante, Yuri; Rossi Espagnet, Maria Camilla; Galassi, Stefania; Della Sala, Sabino Walter; Bernardi, Bruno; Fariello, Giuseppe; Longo, Daniela\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDifferential diagnosis of brainstem lesions, either isolated or in association with cerebellar and supra-tentorial lesions, can be challenging. Knowledge of the structural organization is crucial for the differential diagnosis and establishment of prognosis of pathologies with involvement of the brainstem. Familiarity with the location of the lesions in the brainstem is essential, especially in the pediatric population. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive and specific imaging technique for diagnosing disorders of the posterior fossa and, particularly, the brainstem. High magnetic static field MRI allows detailed visualization of the morphology, signal intensity and metabolic content of the brainstem nuclei, together with visualization of the normal development and myelination. In this pictorial essay we review the brainstem pathology in pediatric patients and consider the MR imaging patterns that may help the radiologist to differentiate among vascular, toxico-metabolic, infective-inflammatory, degenerative and neoplastic processes. Helpful MR tips can guide the differential diagnosis: These include the location and morphology of lesions, the brainstem vascularization territories, gray and white matter distribution and tissue selective vulnerability.

Micromorphology alone rarely allows a specific diagnosis, thus confusion is possible between Candida, Aspergillus, Alternaria and Fusarium species or several other fungal agents. If broad, nearly non-septated hyphae are detected histologically mucormycosis can be suspected. Detection of hyphae in tissue is always a cause for concern because therapeutic consequences must follow. Because therapeutic strategies may differ depending on the specific fungal agent, a suspected diagnosis should be supplemented by other methods, e.g. culture of unfixed specimens, by immunohistology or molecular biological methods.\n\nPhocomelia: Case report and differential diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nOsadsky, Captain Rasto\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWhile rarely seen in the present-day Western world, phocomelia is not uncommon in underdeveloped countries. Phocomelia is an abnormality in which the limbs are not fully formed. It may be inherited as an autosomal recessive or dominant disorder. This case concerns a 12-year-old Afghan boy with multiple skeletal anomalies, most prominently of his right arm, including aplasia of the entire proximal humerus, hypoplasia of the clavicle and scapula, and absence of the radial ray and thumb. A hypoplastic left thumb was also present. Other anomalies included thoracic scoliosis, upper thoracic hemivertebrae, and mild cardiomegaly.

The most worrisome diagnosis is that of a lung malignancy. Primary care providers must assess each patient carefully in a logical, precise manner to determine a working diagnosis for acute versus chronic cough in smokers and nonsmokers. Early detection leads to a diagnosis of lung cancer at earlier stages and may offer the only possibility of cure. This article provides primary care providers with an overview of the most common causes of cough, an algorithm to assist with the diagnosis, and a brief overview of the staging, diagnostic workup, treatment, and management of lung cancer.\n\nDifferential diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis-mimicking actinomycosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Nam Ryang; Park, Jun-Beom; Ko, Youngkyung\n\n2012-12-01\n\nActinomycosis is an uncommon chronic granulomatous disease that presents as a slowly progressive, indolent, indurated infiltration with multiple abscesses, fistulas, and sinuses. The purpose of this article is to report on a case of actinomycosis with clinical findings similar to periodontitis. A 46-year-old female presented with recurrent throbbing pain on the right first and second molar of the mandible three weeks after root planing. Exploratory flap surgery was performed, and the bluish-gray tissue fragment found in the interproximal area between the two molars was sent for histopathology. The diagnosis from the biopsy was actinomycosis. The clinical and radiographic manifestations of this case were clinically indistinguishable from periodontitis. The patient did not report any symptoms, and she is scheduled for a follow-up visit. The present study has identified periodontitis-mimicking actinomycosis. Actinomycosis should be included in the differential diagnosis in cases with periodontal pain and inflammation that do not respond to nonsurgical treatment for periodontitis. More routine submissions of tissue removed from the oral cavity for biopsies may be beneficial for differential diagnosis.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis of Stuttering for Forensic Purposes\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSeery, Carol Hubbard\n\n2005-01-01\n\nPurpose: This case study demonstrates the application of an assessment protocol for differential diagnosis of psychogenic stuttering, neurogenic stuttering, developmental stuttering, and malingering.

A 73 year old female is admitted to the hospital because of dyspnea, fatigue and loss of appetite and weight. While previous medical history and physical examination are inconspicuous, laboratory findings show severe pancytopenia with macrocytosis, low reticulocyte count and marked signs of hemolysis. A very low serum level of vitamin B12 and chronic atrophic type A gastritis upon endoscopy with presence of parietal cell antibodies in the serum lead to the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Complete restitution is achieved by parenteral vitamin B12 substitution. Nowadays, severe pernicious anemia is only rarely seen. The differential diagnosis of pancytopenia (with macrocytic anemia) combined with hemolysis and the essential hints to the diagnosis of pernicious anemia are discussed, and thereby practical aspects including therapy actualized.\n\nClinical and histopathological differential diagnosis of eosinophilic pustular folliculitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nFujiyama, Toshiharu; Tokura, Yoshiki\n\n2013-06-01\n\nEosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) is an inflammatory disease characterized by repeated pruritic follicular papules and pustules arranged in arcuate plaques, and folliculotropic infiltration of eosinophils. The diagnosis of EPF is occasionally difficult and problematic because EPF may share the clinical appearance and histological findings with other diseases. Moreover, EPF has several clinical subtypes, including the classical type, infantile type and immunosuppression-associated type. Because the therapies of EPF are relatively specific as compared to eczematous disorders, accurate diagnosis is essential for the management of EPF. Clinical differential diagnoses include tinea, acne, rosacea, eczematous dermatitis, granuloma faciale, autoimmune annular erythema, infestations and pustular dermatosis. Histologically, cutaneous diseases with eosinophilic infiltrates can be differentially diagnosed. Follicular mucinosis, mycosis fungoides and other cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are the most important differential diagnoses both clinically and histopathologically. It should be kept in mind particularly that the initial lesions of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma resemble EPF.

The significant problem in dermatology and pathology is the differential diagnosis of malignant melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions, especially of dysplastic nevi. Malignant melanoma is the most malignant skin neoplasma, with increasing incidence in various parts of the world. It is hoped that the methods of quantitative pathology, i.e. morphometry, can help objectification of the diagnostic process, since early discovery of melanoma results in 10-year survival rate of 90%. The aim of the study was to use fractal dimension calculated from the perimeter-area relation of the cell nuclei as a tool for the differential diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions. We analyzed hemalaun-eosin stained pathohistological slides of pigmented skin lesions: intradermal naevi (n = 45), dysplastic naevi (n = 47), and malignant melanoma (n = 50). It was found that fractal dimension of malignant melanoma cell nuclei differs significantly from the intradermal and dysplastic naevi (p â¤ 0. 001, Steel-Dwass Multiple Comparison Test). Additionaly, ROC analysis confirmed the value of fractal dimension based evaluation. It is suggested that the estimation of fractal dimension from the perimeter-area relation of the cell nuclei may be a potentially useful morphometric parameter in the medical differential diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions.\n\nAnosmia: Differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management.\n\nPubMed\n\nScangas, George A; Bleier, Benjamin S\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe ability to scrutinize our surroundings remains heavily dependent on the sense of smell. From the ability to detect dangerous situations such as fires to the recollection of a fond memory triggered by an odor, the advantages of an intact olfactory system cannot be overstated. Outcomes studies have highlighted the profound negative impact of anosmia and parosmia on the overall quality of life. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders estimates that â¼1.4% of the United States population experiences chronic olfactory dysfunction and smell loss. Efforts have focused on improving both the diagnosis of olfactory dysfunction through olfactory testing and improved reporting of treatment outcomes of olfactory training. The purpose of this article was to review the differential diagnosis, workup, and current treatment strategies of anosmia and smell disorders.\n\nDisease of the year: juvenile idiopathic arthritis--differential diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu-Torres, Sandra; Foster, C Stephen\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this review is to comprehensively explain the differential diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis. Web-based literature review. Main diagnostic decisions are made through a thorough anterior segment exam and a comprehensive exploration of past medical and family history. High clinical suspicion of other uveitic entities occurring in children is necessary and must be excluded by the practitioner before immediate diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is made.\n\n[Differential diagnosis of ulcerated gastric lesions].\n\nPubMed\n\nLlorens, P; Atlschiller, H; Pisano, R; Moya, P\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe semiological characteristics of the ulcerated gastric lesions, benign and malignant, are on study. Its frequency and location is analysed in 32,829 subjects of 40 or more years of age, apparently in good health, finding gastric ulcers in 2.98% been unique in 2.3% and multiple in 0.68%. A symptomatic group of 8,765 people of 40 or more years, showed gastric ulcer in 7.11% been unique in 5.18% and multiple in 1.93%. It is also reported the frequency of gastric cancer in both studied groups, which leads to permanently propose the differential diagnostic with benign lesions, underlying by its frequency those of ulcerated type. The value of the gastric biopsy in differential diagnosis represents finally an aid of major importance because its high yield.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of common tremor syndromes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBhidayasiri, R\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTremor is one of the most common involuntary movement disorders seen in clinical practice. In addition to the detailed history, the differential diagnosis is mainly clinical based on the distinction at rest, postural and intention, activation condition, frequency, and topographical distribution. The causes of tremor are heterogeneous and it can present alone (for example, essential tremor) or as a part of a neurological syndrome (for example, multiple sclerosis). Essential tremor and the tremor of Parkinson's disease are the most common tremors encountered in clinical practice. This article focuses on a practical approach to these different forms of tremor and how to distinguish them clinically. Evidence supporting various strategies used in the differentiation is then presented, followed by a review of formal guidelines or recommendations when they exist.

The main aim of the work is criteria definition and evaluation of diagnostic significance of endosonography in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant common bile duct stenosis. The paper presents a methodology of endoscopic ultrasound and basic criteria for the differential diagnosis of tumors and other lesions of the extrahepatic bile ducts. A comparative analysis of endosonography, ultrasound, CT, MRCP was conducted. The sensitivity of endosonography in determining the nature of the common bile duct stenosis was 97.7%, a specificity 100% and accuracy 98.2%, which is superior to other methods of radiological diagnosis. In comprehensive surgical centers endosonography should be used as a method of specifying the final diagnosis to determine the nature of the common bile duct stenosis, particularly at low constriction location.\n\nPathology and differential diagnosis of chronic, noninfectious gastritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPolydorides, Alexandros D\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe histologic finding of chronic inflammation in an endoscopic mucosal biopsy of the stomach (chronic gastritis) is very common and usually reflects the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, infectious organisms are not always present in biopsy material, and some cases of chronic gastritis do not result from H. pylori infection. Thus, the differential diagnosis of this finding is an important one for pathologists to keep in mind. This review presents the three most common and clinically significant causes of chronic, noninfectious gastritis, namely, autoimmune atrophic gastritis, lymphocytic gastritis, and gastric involvement in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn disease. For each entity, a brief discussion of its etiology and pathogenesis, a review of the clinical and endoscopic features, and a description of the microscopic findings are presented in the context of the differential diagnosis of chronic gastritis with emphasis on helpful histopathologic hints and long-term sequelae.

A tiny prefoveal floater, only detectable by OCT, was found responsible for the symptoms in three patients, one of whom had been referred with unilateral delayed visual evoked potentials. This case series suggests that with increased use of OCT in routine clinical care, entoptic phenomena can be demonstrated as a relevant differential diagnosis to optic neuritis. Patients should be explained the benign nature of their symptoms.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of ritual abuse allegations.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernet, W; Chang, D K\n\n1997-01-01\n\nBecause psychiatrists do not have a consistent way to classify and define the forms of child abuse that may be mistaken for ritual abuse, the objective of this paper is to create a comprehensive differential diagnosis of allegations of ritual abuse. The authors reviewed 60 articles, chapters, and books that contained allegations of ritual abuse or behaviors that might be mistaken for ritual abuse, that were made by patients or caretakers. This paper clarifies the behaviors that represent or may be mistaken for ritual abuse: Cult-based ritual abuse, pseudoritualistic abuse, activities by organized satanic groups, repetitive psychopathological abuse, sexual abuse by pedophiles, child pornography portraying ritual abuse, distorted memory, false memory, false report due to a severe mental disorder, pseudologia phantastica, adolescent behavior simulating ritual abuse, epidemic hysteria, deliberate lying, and hoaxes. The differential diagnosis of allegations of ritual abuse is important in both clinical and forensic psychiatry. In some cases, it will not be possible to tell whether a particular allegation is factual or what the underlying mental processes are. It is important to separate the role of the mental health professional as therapist from the role as an expert witness in court.\n\nThe Differential Diagnosis of Functional Symptoms in Adolescence.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSilber, Thomas J.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nFunctional complaints constitute the major reason why adolescents visit the physician's office.

FE is characterized by diffuse rash and fever. FE is classified in 4 types, depending on the primary skin lesion: macular, maculopapular, vesicular, and bullous exanthema. It is of infectious and non-infectious cause. Among the infectious causes the most frequent is the viral one. FE may affect all ages, but especially children and young people. Usually, FE raises important issues of differential diagnosis, because its clinical and etiological complexity. To decide the most appropriate therapeutic and prophylactic measures for FE, it is important to know the clinical criteria and the specific diagnostic methods.\n\nContrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography in Differential Diagnosis of Benign and Malignant Ovarian Tumors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nQiao, Jing-Jing; Yu, Jing; Yu, Zhe; Li, Na; Song, Chen; Li, Man\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in differential diagnosis of benign and malignant ovarian tumors. Methods The scientific literature databases PubMed, Cochrane Library and CNKI were comprehensively searched for studies relevant to the use of CEUS technique for differential diagnosis of benign and malignant ovarian cancer. Pooled summary statistics for specificity (Spe), sensitivity (Sen), positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+/LRâ), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and their 95%CIs were calculated. Software for statistical analysis included STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) and Meta-Disc version 1.4 (Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain). Results Following a stringent selection process, seven high quality clinical trials were found suitable for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. The 7 studies contained a combined total of 375 ovarian cancer patients (198 malignant and 177 benign). Statistical analysis revealed that CEUS was associated with the following performance measures in differential diagnosis of ovarian tumors: pooled Sen was 0.96 (95%CI = 0.92â¼0.98); the summary Spe was 0.91 (95%CI = 0.86â¼0.94); the pooled LR+ was 10.63 (95%CI = 6.59â¼17.17); the pooled LRâ was 0.04 (95%CI = 0.02â¼0.09); and the pooled DOR was 241.04 (95% CI = 92.61â¼627.37). The area under the SROC curve was 0.98 (95% CI = 0.20â¼1.00). Lastly, publication bias was not detected (t = â0.52, P = 0.626) in the meta-analysis. Conclusions Our results revealed the high clinical value of CEUS in differential diagnosis of benign and malignant ovarian tumors. Further, CEUS may also prove to be useful in differential diagnosis at early stages of this disease.

The manual medical diagnosis can make a valuable contribution in such cases for determination of structural and functional pathology. Early application of manual medical therapies seems to be effective for peracute complaints. The mobilization of restrictions of the pelvic visceral attachments should be included. In the following review manual medical syndromes are presented that summarize the findings from the musculoskeletal and visceral system. This is intended to facilitate the primary differential diagnostic evaluation, as well as treatment planning. The combination with osteopathic methods is very profitable. A necessary specialist differential diagnosis remains essential.\n\nOptical coherence tomography in differential diagnosis of skin pathology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGladkova, Natalia D.; Petrova, Galina P.; Derpaluk, Elena; Nikulin, Nikolai K.; Snopova, Ludmila; Chumakov, Yuri; Feldchtein, Felix I.; Gelikonov, Valentin M.; Gelikonov, Grigory V.; Kuranov, Roman V.\n\n2000-05-01\n\nThe capabilities of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for imaging in vivo of optical patterns of pathomorphological processes in the skin and use of their optical patterns in clinical practice for differential diagnosis of dermatoses are presented. Images of skin tissue 0.8 - 1.5 mm deep were acquired with a resolution of 5, 12 and 20 micrometer using three compact fiber OCT devices developed at the Institute of Applied Physics RAS. The acquisition time of images of skin regions 2 - 6 mm in length was 2 - 4 s. The OCT capabilities were analyzed based on the study of 50 patients with different dermatoses. OCT images were interpreted by comparing with parallel histology. It is shown that OCT can detect in vivo optical patterns of morphological alterations in such general papulous dermatoses as lichen ruber planus and psoriasis, a capability that can be used in differential diagnosis of these diseases. Most informative are OCT images obtained with a resolution of 5 micrometer. The results of our study demonstrate the practical importance of OCT imaging for diagnosis of different dermatoses. OCT is noninvasive and, therefore, makes it possible to perform frequent multifocal examination of skin without any adverse effects.\n\n[Scurvy. A rare differential diagnosis of rheumatic diseases].\n\nPubMed\n\nHofheinz, K; Ganzleben, I; Schliep, S; Wacker, J; Schett, G; Manger, B\n\n2016-03-01\n\nIn December 2014 a patient presented to our clinic with the clinical symptoms of vasculitis. However, treatment with glucocorticoids did not lead to any improvement; therefore, the differential diagnostics were extended to other indications and ultimately led to the diagnosis of scurvy. This article describes the clinical picture of scurvy and its relationship to rheumatic diseases based on a clinical case and additional information from the literature. Differences and similarities with important rheumatological disease symptoms are presented. Scurvy is a rare hypovitaminosis disease which can be manifested in different forms. In addition to vasculitis the symptoms can also resemble arthritis and hemarthrosis is a typical finding. These symptoms can be accompanied by unspecific manifestations, such as muscle pain and due to impaired collagen synthesis characteristic features, such as corkscrew hair can be observed. The causal therapy of scurvy is substitution of ascorbic acid. Scurvy is a rare differential diagnosis in the context of rheumatic diseases. The indications for scurvy can be a lack of response to immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs as well as individual symptoms, such as corkscrew hair.\n\nHIV associated eosinophilic folliculitis--differential diagnosis and management\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSimpson-Dent, S.; Fearfield, L. A.; Staughton, R. C.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nEosinophilic folliculitis (EF) is a chronic, intensely pruritic condition of unknown pathogenesis that causes marked morbidity in those HIV patients whom it affects. There is a wide differential diagnosis of itchy skin conditions in HIV which are amenable to different treatments. It is therefore essential to take a biopsy of each suspected case and examine multiple sections of the biopsy to confirm or refute a diagnosis of EF. Treatment of EF can be difficult but we hope that by suggesting a rational approach to this and considering possible therapeutic options more patients may be helped with this troublesome dermatosis. â¨â¨â¨ PMID:10616350\n\nNeutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in the differential diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMentis, A-F A; Kyprianou, M A; Xirogianni, A; Kesanopoulos, K; Tzanakaki, G\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute community-acquired meningitis is of paramount importance in both therapeutic and healthcare-related economic terms. Despite the routinely used markers, novel, easily calculated, and rapidly available biomarkers are needed particularly in resource-poor settings. A promising, exponentially studied inflammatory marker is the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), albeit not assessed in meningitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of the NLR in the differential diagnosis of acute meningitis. Data on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood leukocyte parameters from more than 4,000 patients diagnosed with either bacterial or viral meningitis in Greece during the period 2006-2013 were retrospectively examined. The diagnostic accuracy of the NLR and neutrophil counts in CSF and blood were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves. The discrimination ability of both the NLR and neutrophil counts was significantly higher in CSF than in blood. The optimal cutoff values of the NLR and neutrophil counts were 2 in CSF vs 8 in blood, and 287 cells in CSF vs 12,100 cells in blood, respectively. For these values, sensitivity, negative predictive value, and odds ratio were statistically significantly higher in CSF than blood for both markers. Logistic regression analysis showed that the CSF NLR carries independent and additive information to neutrophil counts in the differential diagnosis of acute meningitis. This study is the first one to assess NLR in acute meningitis, providing promising results for its differential diagnosis.\n\n[Desmoplastic fibroma.

Mutation in calcium sensing receptor gene (CaSR) clinically manifests as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) or as the much more serious neonatal hyperparathyreosis. Hypercalciuric hypocalcemia is extremely rare. Prognosis for the most frequent mutations in the CaSR gene FHH is considered benign; nevertheless, if overlooked it can lead to an incorrect diagnosis of primary hyperparathyreosis, which has a fundamentally different prognosis and treatment. Familial hypophosphatemia sometimes occurs as hereditary rickets, which is a consequence of insufficient production of vitamin D-hormone or abnormal function of vitamin D receptors (VDR). The disease manifests as X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets or autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets. Autosomal recessive form is very rare. Oncogenic hypophosphatemia should be excluded in differential diagnosis. In this review the issues of pathogenesis, differential diagnosis and treatment of FHH and hypophosphatemic rickets are discussed.\n\nThe neuromuscular differential diagnosis of joint hypermobility.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonkervoort, S; Bonnemann, C G; Loeys, B; Jungbluth, H; Voermans, N C\n\n2015-03-01\n\nJoint hypermobility is the defining feature of various inherited connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and various types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and these will generally be the first conditions to be considered by geneticists and pediatricians in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with such findings. However, several congenital and adult-onset inherited myopathies also present with joint hypermobility in the context of often only mild-to-moderate muscle weakness and should, therefore, be included in the differential diagnosis of joint hypermobility. In fact, on the molecular level disorders within both groups represent different ends of the same spectrum of inherited extracellular matrix (ECM) disorders. In this review we will summarize the measures of joint hypermobility, illustrate molecular mechanisms these groups of disorders have in common, and subsequently discuss the clinical features of: 1) the most common connective tissue disorders with myopathic or other neuromuscular features: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome; 2) myopathy and connective tissue overlap disorders (muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) disorders), including collagen VI related dystrophies and FKBP14 related kyphoscoliotic type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; and 3) various (congenital) myopathies with prominent joint hypermobility including RYR1- and SEPN1-related myopathy. The aim of this review is to assist clinical geneticists and other clinicians with recognition of these disorders.

Because derangements in renal acid-base regulation are a common cause of nongap metabolic acidosis, studies to evaluate renal acidification often serve as the mainstay of differential diagnosis. However, in many cases, information obtained from the history and physical examination, evaluation of the electrolyte pattern (to determine if a nongap acidosis alone or a combined nongap and high anion gap metabolic acidosis is present), and examination of the serum potassium concentration (to characterize the disorder as hyperkalemic or hypokalemic in nature) is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis without more sophisticated studies. If this information proves insufficient, indirect estimates or direct measurement of urinary NH4+ concentration, measurement of urine pH, and assessment of urinary HCO3â excretion can help in establishing the diagnosis. This review summarizes current information concerning the pathophysiology of this electrolyte pattern and the value and limitations of all of the diagnostic studies available. It also provides a systematic and cost-effective approach to the differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis.

Despite increasing incidence, awareness of lung NETs remains low among thoracic specialists who are often involved in the assessment and early treatment of these patients. Successful treatment requires accurate and timely diagnosis; however, classification can be challenging, particularly for well-differentiated and intermediate-differentiated lung NET types (typical carcinoids [TC] and atypical carcinoids [AC]). Diagnosis and management of lung NETs are further complicated by the nonspecificity of symptoms, variable natural history, and lack of high-level clinical evidence; a multidisciplinary approach is required, which has been shownÂ to improve prognosis. Currently, surgery remains the only curative option for TC/AC. Inconsistencies between guideline recommendations for systemic therapies, especially for chemotherapy, result in a lack of consensus on a standardized treatment for unresectable disease. Recent data from the Phase III RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Fourth Trial (RADIANT-4), which contained a large population of patients with advanced, well-differentiated, nonfunctional lung NETs in addition to those with GI NETs, found a reduced risk of disease progression and death with everolimus compared with placebo, leading to US approval of everolimus in these patient populations. This study is the first high-level therapeutic evidence in patients with TC/AC, and everolimus is currently the only agent approved for treatment of TC/AC. Increased awareness, prompt diagnosis, and additional adequately powered controlled clinical trials of patients with well-differentiated and intermediate-differentiated lung NETs are needed to further improve evidence-based care.

Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) is a subset of plasma cell neoplasms which presents as an isolated non-osseous soft tissue mass. Though carotid space neoplasms are commonly encountered, EMP in the carotid space is rare and seldom considered in the initial differential diagnosis of a carotid space mass. These tumors can be treated by surgery or radiotherapy. On the other hand, the commonly encountered tumors in the carotid space are treated surgically. Also, it is mandatory to exclude multiple myeloma in the patients presenting with EMP. Hence, accurate and early diagnosis has therapeutic and prognostic implications. We report a rare case of EMP of the carotid space, describing the imaging features and the differential diagnoses with clues pointing to this rare entity.\n\nThe investigation and differential diagnosis of Asperger syndrome in adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nLehnhardt, Fritz-Georg; Gawronski, Astrid; Pfeiffer, Kathleen; Kockler, Hanna; Schilbach, Leonhard; Vogeley, Kai\n\n2013-11-08\n\nAs a result of the increased public interest in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), certain core manifestations of ASD--impaired social interaction and communication, bizarre interests--are now commonly recognized as being typical of autism, not only in children, but in adults as well. More often than before, general practitioners, neurologists, and psychiatrists find themselves being asked whether a patient is suffering from previously unrecognized Asperger syndrome (AS). The prevalence of ASD is estimated at 1%, and the ratio of diagnosed to undiagnosed cases at about 3:2. Little is known about the diagnostic evaluation of AS in adulthood. We selectively searched the Medline database for pertinent literature, paying special attention to diagnostic manuals and to the guideline of the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Centrally important aspects of the diagnosis of AS include an assessment of the patient's ability to assume the emotional perspectives of others, non-verbal modes of expression, repetitive behavior patterns, and childhood social behavioral history. The autism quotient (AQ) is now established as a simple but nonspecific screening test. Up to 70% of all affected adults have comorbid disturbances, most often depression and anxiety disorders. The differential diagnosis includes personality disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. The diagnostic assessment should proceed in stepwise fashion, starting from simple screening in primary care and then moving on to evaluation of the suspected diagnosis by a mental health care specialist, followed by extensive further investigation in an outpatient clinic specifically devoted to patients with autism spectrum disorders. The diagnostic assessment of autism in adults requires knowledge of the core and accompanying manifestations of autism and of their differential diagnoses.

It can be caused by any of 4 fundamentally different defects that must be distinguished for safe and effective management. They are: (1) pituitary DI, due to inadequate production and secretion of antidiuretic hormone, arginine-vasopressin (AVP); (2) gestational DI due to degradation of AVP by an enzyme made in placenta; (3) primary polydipsia, due to suppression of AVP secretion by excessive fluid intake; and (4) nephrogenic DI due to renal insensitivity to the antidiuretic effect of AVP. This review describes several methods of differential diagnosis, indicates the advantages and disadvantages of each and presents a new approach that is simpler and less costly but just as reliable as the best of the older methods. The various treatments for the different types of DI and recent findings on the genetic basis of the familial forms of DI are also discussed with emphasis on their contributions to improved diagnosis and management.

Here, we list the 12 main topics that could add helpful information and clues for performing an early differential diagnosis to distinguish between these conditions. The early diagnosis of patients with inherited endocrine tumors may be performed either clinically or by mutation analysis in at-risk individuals. Early detection usually has a large impact in tumor management, allowing preventive clinical or surgical therapy in most cases.

Here we report on pre- and postnatal neuroimaging findings in three fetuses with prenatal ventriculomegaly and brainstem kinking. We aim to identify key neuroimaging features that may allow the prenatal differentiation between diseases associated with fetal ventriculomegaly and brainstem kinking. All pre- and postnatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were qualitatively evaluated for infra- and supratentorial abnormalities. Data about clinical features and genetic findings were collected from clinical histories. In all three patients, fetal MRI showed ventriculomegaly and brainstem kinking. In two patients, postnatal MRI also showed supratentorial migration abnormalities and eye abnormalities were found. In these children, the diagnosis of Î±-dystroglycanopathy was genetically confirmed. In the third patient, basal ganglia had an abnormal shape on MRI suggesting a tubulinopathy. The differential diagnosis of prenatal ventriculomegaly and brainstem kinking includes Î±-dystroglycanopathies, X-linked hydrocephalus due to mutations in L1CAM, and tubulinopathies. The prenatal differentiation between these diseases may be difficult. The presence of ocular abnormalities on prenatal neuroimaging may favor Î±-dystroglycanopathies, while dysplastic basal ganglia may suggest a tubulinopathy. However, in some patients the final differentiation between these diseases is possible only postnatally. Copyright Â© 2015 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Practically in most cases abscess of lungs there is a necessity of leadthrough of differential diagnostics with in a number of nosology forms, including with the cavernous form of peripheral cancer of lungs. The features of flow of roentgenologic picture of tumoroidea variant are resulted, alike symptoms, differ ences and signs which allow to set a correct diagnosis, are resulted, the value of follow-up of roent genologic research and use of computed tomography is underlined.\n\nComputational Psychosomatics and Computational Psychiatry: Toward a Joint Framework for Differential Diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetzschner, Frederike H; Weber, Lilian A E; Gard, Tim; Stephan, Klaas E\n\n2017-09-15\n\nThis article outlines how a core concept from theories of homeostasis and cybernetics, the inference-control loop, may be used to guide differential diagnosis in computational psychiatry and computational psychosomatics. In particular, we discuss 1) how conceptualizing perception and action as inference-control loops yields a joint computational perspective on brain-world and brain-body interactions and 2) how the concrete formulation of this loop as a hierarchical Bayesian model points to key computational quantities that inform a taxonomy of potential disease mechanisms. We consider the utility of this perspective for differential diagnosis in concrete clinical applications. Copyright Â© 2017 Society of Biological Psychiatry. Published by Elsevier Inc.

As a result, the development of serum-based differential diagnostic biomarkers is in high demand. In this study, 198 clinical serum samples from non-cancer lung disease and lung cancer patients were analyzed using nLC-MRM-MS for the levels of seven lung cancer biomarker candidates. When the candidates were assessed individually, only SERPINEA4 showed statistically significant changes in the serum levels. The MRM results and clinical information were analyzed using a logistic regression analysis to select model for the best 'meta-marker', or combination of biomarkers for differential diagnosis. Also, under consideration of statistical interaction, variables having low significance as a single factor but statistically influencing on meta-marker model were selected. Using this probabilistic classification, the best meta-marker was determined to be made up of two proteins SERPINA4 and PON1 with age factor. This meta-marker showed an enhanced differential diagnostic capability (AUC=0.915) for distinguishing the two patient groups. Our results suggest that a statistical model can determine optimal meta-markers, which may have better specificity and sensitivity than a single biomarker and thus improve the differential diagnosis of lung cancer and lung disease patients. Diagnosing lung cancer commonly involves the use of radiographic methods. However, an imaging-based diagnosis may fail to differentiate lung cancer from non-cancerous lung disease. In this study, we examined several serum proteins in the sera of 198 lung cancer and non-cancerous lung disease patients by multiple-reaction monitoring. We then used a combination of variables to generate a meta-marker model that is useful as a differential diagnostic biomarker. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to compare the self-confidence of entry-level doctoral student physical therapists during foundational assessment and musculoskeletal differential diagnosis courses and the students' competencies based on skills examinations. Methods using qualitative and quantitative procedures. Student physical therapists (n=27) participated in a basic assessment course followed by a musculoskeletal differential diagnosis course. The students completed confidence surveys prior to skills examinations in both courses. A random sample of students participated in focus groups, led by a researcher outside the physical therapy department. Student confidence did not correlate with competency scores. At the end of the basic clinical assessment course and the beginning of the differential diagnosis course, students' confidence was significantly below baseline. However, by the end of the differential diagnosis course, student confidence had returned to original baseline levels. Over three semesters, the students lost confidence and then regained confidence in their abilities. Additional experience and practice influenced perceived confidence. However, increased competence may have been associated with poor self-appraisal skills instead of increased competency.\n\nDifferential diagnosis in inflammatory bowel disease colitis: State of the art and future perspectives\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTontini, Gian Eugenio; Vecchi, Maurizio; Pastorelli, Luca; Neurath, Markus F; Neumann, Helmut\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDistinction between Crohnâs disease of the colon-rectum and ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) type unclassified can be of pivotal importance for a tailored clinical management, as each entity often involves specific therapeutic strategies and prognosis. Nonetheless, no gold standard is available and the uncertainty of diagnosis may frequently lead to misclassification or repeated examinations. Hence, we have performed a literature search to address the problem of differential diagnosis in IBD colitis, revised current and emerging diagnostic tools and refined disease classification strategies. Nowadays, the differential diagnosis is an untangled issue, and the proper diagnosis cannot be reached in up to 10% of patients presenting with IBD colitis. This topic is receiving emerging attention, as medical therapies, surgical approaches and leading prognostic outcomes require more and more disease-specific strategies in IBD patients. The optimization of standard diagnostic approaches based on clinical features, biomarkers, radiology, endoscopy and histopathology appears to provide only marginal benefits. Conversely, emerging diagnostic techniques in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy, molecular pathology, genetics, epigenetics, metabolomics and proteomics have already shown promising results. Novel advanced endoscopic imaging techniques and biomarkers can shed new light for the differential diagnosis of IBD, better reflecting diverse disease behaviors based on specific pathogenic pathways.

Materials and Methods: Ten patients aged between 19 years and 40 years with periapical lesions associated with anterior maxillary or mandibular teeth were selected and consented for the study. Pre-operative periapical radiographs were obtained. Measurements and provisional diagnoses of the apical areas were made by two specialist observers on two separate occasions. Preoperative ultrasound examinations with Doppler flowmetry were then performed and the images assessed by two specialist observers for the size, contents, vascular supply and a provisional diagnosis made as to whether the lesion was a cyst or granuloma. Endodontic surgery was performed including curettage of the apical tissues to enable histopathological investigation, which provided the gold standard diagnosis. All measurements and findings were compared and statistically analyzed. Results: Total 10 lesions were identified in 10 patients. On periapical radiographs, lesions were readily identified but observers were unable to differentiate granuloma from cyst using either modality. Where sufficient buccal cortical bone had been resorbed, ultrasound imaging was simple but underestimated the size of the lesions compared with periapical radiographs. In all cases, the ultrasound diagnosis agreed with the histopathological gold standard. Conclusion: Ultrasonography (USG) can provide accurate information about the nature of intraosseous lesions of the jaws before any surgical procedure. It is proposed that USG with Doppler flowmetry can provide an additional diagnostic tool without invasive surgery, where treatment option is nonsurgical.

The results showed that at least 80% of benign lymph node enlargements containing small groups of epithelioid cells were associated with high titres of Toxoplasma antibodies. Furthermore, 85--95% of the lymph nodes in association with high Toxoplasma antibodies showed the typical histological appearances of toxoplasmosis. The histological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is thus both fairly specific and sensitive. Other lymph node lesions with small groups of epithelioid cells must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Sarcoidosis and tuberculosis usually have a predominance of distinct large epithelioid cell granulomata. Lymph nodes with sinus histiocytosis showing the formation of small groups of epithelioid cells, do not demonstrate prominent hyperplasia and include sparse germinal centres and were not associated with toxoplasmosis. Lymph nodes with disturbed general structure and small groups of epithelioid cells must be carefully assessed because of the significant possibility of malignancy.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of the scalp hair folliculitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLugoviÄ-MihiÄ, Liborija; BarisiÄ, Freja; Bulat, Vedrana; Buljan, Marija; Situm, Mirna; BradiÄ, Lada; MihiÄ, Josip\n\n2011-09-01\n\nScalp hair folliculitis is a relatively common condition in dermatological practice and a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to the lack of exact guidelines. Generally, inflammatory diseases of the pilosebaceous follicle of the scalp most often manifest as folliculitis. There are numerous infective agents that may cause folliculitis, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, as well as many noninfective causes. Several noninfectious diseases may present as scalp hair folliculitis, such as folliculitis decalvans capillitii, perifolliculitis capitis abscendens et suffodiens, erosive pustular dermatitis, lichen planopilaris, eosinophilic pustular folliculitis, etc. The classification of folliculitis is both confusing and controversial. There are many different forms of folliculitis and several classifications. According to the considerable variability of histologic findings, there are three groups of folliculitis: infectious folliculitis, noninfectious folliculitis and perifolliculitis. The diagnosis of folliculitis occasionally requires histologic confirmation and cannot be based solely on clinical appearance of scalp lesions. This article summarizes prominent variants of inflammatory diseases of the scalp hair follicle with differential diagnosis and appertaining histological features.\n\nOccurrence of dermoid cyst in the floor of the mouth: the importance of differential diagnosis in pediatric patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nPuricelli, Edela; Barreiro, Bernardo Ottoni Braga; Quevedo, Alexandre Silva; Ponzoni, Deise\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLesions in the floor of the mouth can be a challenging diagnosis due to the variety of pathological conditions that might be found in this area. Within a broad range of lesions, attention has to be addressed to those that require specific management, such as a dermoid cyst (DC) and a ranula. Especially in pediatric patients, in whom the failure of diagnosis can postpone the correct treatment and cause sequelae later in life. DC, a developmental anomaly, is managed primarily by surgical resection. On the other hand, ranula is a pseudocyst that may be treated by marsupialization. This article reports a large and painful lesion in the floor of the mouth in a pediatric patient. With a diagnostic hypothesis of ranula, two surgical interventions were performed, but there were recurrences of the lesion. Subsequently, the patient was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Unit for re-evaluation. Computed tomography showed a semi-transparent image suggesting a cystic formation. Another surgical procedure was performed where the lesion was completely removed. Anatomopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of DC. The five-year follow-up showed no signs of recurrence. This article indicates that although DC in the floor of the mouth is rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other diseases in this area. This precaution may be particularly important in the following circumstances: 1) Similar lesions that have different therapeutic approaches and, 2) To prevent future sequelae in pediatric patients.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma: utility of p16 in combination with MDM2 and CDK4 immunohistochemistry.\n\nPubMed\n\nKammerer-Jacquet, SolÃ¨ne-Florence; Thierry, Sixte; Cabillic, Florian; Lannes, Morgane; Burtin, Florence; Henno, SÃ©bastien; Dugay, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; BouzillÃ©, Guillaume; Rioux-Leclercq, Nathalie; Belaud-Rotureau, Marc-Antoine; Stock, Nathalie\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe differential diagnosis between atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDLPS) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) from their morphologic counterparts is challenging. Currently, the diagnosis is guided by MDM2 and CDK4 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and is confirmed by the amplification of the corresponding genes. Recently, p16 IHC has been proposed as a useful diagnostic biomarker. The objective was to assess the utility of p16 IHC in the differential diagnosis of ALT/WDLPS and DDLPS. Our series included 101 tumors that were previously analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization for MDM2 and CDK4 amplification. We compared sensitivity and specificity of p16 IHC to MDM2 and CDK4 IHC in the differential diagnosis of ALT-WDLPS (n=19) versus benign adipocytic tumors (n=44) and DDLPS (n=18) versus mimicking sarcomas (n=20). In the differential diagnosis of ALT-WDLPS, p16 had a sensitivity of 89.5% but a specificity of 68.2%, which was impaired by false-positive lipomas with secondary changes, especially in biopsies. Likewise, in the differential diagnosis of DDLPS, p16 had a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 70%, which hampered its use as a single marker. However, adding p16 to MDM2 and/or CDK4 increased diagnostic specificity. Indeed, MDM2+/p16+ tumors were all ALT-WDLPS, and MDM2-/p16- tumors were all benign adipocytic tumors. Moreover, all MDM2+/CDK4+/p16+ tumors were DDLPS, and the MDM2-/CDK4-/p16- tumor was an undifferentiated sarcoma. Although the use of p16 as a single immunohistochemical marker is limited by its specificity, its combination with MDM2 and CDK4 IHC may help discriminate ALT-WDLPS/DDLPS.

Determine the added diagnostic value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for differential dementia diagnosis as compared to autopsy-confirmed diagnosis. Seventy-one dementia patients with autopsy-confirmed diagnoses were included in this study. All neuropathological diagnoses were established according to standard neuropathological criteria and consisted of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementias (NONAD). CSF levels of AÎ²1Â -Â 42, T-tau, and P-tau181 were determined and interpreted based on the IWG-2 and NIA-AA criteria, separately. A panel of three neurologists experienced with dementia made clinical consensus dementia diagnoses. Clinical and CSF biomarker diagnoses were compared to the autopsy-confirmed diagnoses. Forty-two patients (59%) had autopsy-confirmed AD, whereas 29 patients (41%) had autopsy-confirmed NONAD. Of the 24 patients with an ambiguous clinical dementia diagnosis, a correct diagnosis would have been established in 67% of the cases applying CSF biomarkers in the context of the IWG-2 or the NIA-AA criteria respectively. AD CSF biomarkers have an added diagnostic value in differential dementia diagnosis and can help establishing a correct dementia diagnosis in case of ambiguous clinical dementia diagnoses.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of CNS angiostrongyliasis: a short review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSenthong, Vichai; Chindaprasirt, Jarin; Sawanyawisuth, Kittisak\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe diagnostic criterion for eosinophilic meningitis (EOM) is the identification of an absolute count of 10 eosinophils per ml or more than 10% of the total white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the proper clinical context. The most common cause of EOM is Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection, termed meningitic angiostrongyliasis (MA). Neurognathostomiasis (NG) is the main parasitic disease in the differential diagnosis of meningitic angiostrongyliasis. This short review is based on articles published on Medline between 2000 and 2012 related to EOM. There are three main approaches that can be used to differentiate between MA and NG, involving clinical factors, history of larval exposure, and serological tests. MA patients presented with acute severe headache but without neurological deficit, combined with a history of eating uncooked snails or slugs. NG patients always presented with motor weakness, migratory swelling, radicular pain and had history of eating uncooked poultry or fish. Specific antigenic bands in immunoblot tests are helpful tools to differentiate the two diseases. Other causes of eosinophilic meningitis are neurocysticercosis, cerebral paragonimiasis, Toxoplasma canis, Baylisascaris, tuberculous meningitis, and cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nAntenatal Hydronephrosis: Differential Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment Options\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHerndon, C.D. Anthony\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe diagnosis, evaluation and management of antenatal hydronephrosis has undergone a two stage paradigm shift since the advent of prenatal ultrasonography in the early 1980s. Initially the identification of a large number of asymptomatic infants appeared to afford the surgeon the opportunity for preemptive intervention. However, it has now become apparent that antenatal hydronephrosis (AH) is far more difficult to interpret thanoriginally perceived. The initial enthusiasm for surgery has now been replaced by a much more conservative approach to ureteropelvic junction(UPJ) obstruction, multi-cystic dysplastic kidney(MCDK), vesicoureteral reflux and the non-refluxing megaureter. This review will highlight the postnatal evaluation of AH and include an overview of the Society for Fetal Urology grading system for hydronephrosis. The differential diagnosis and treatment options for UPJ obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, MCDK, duplication anomalies, megaureter, and posterior urethral valves will be discussed.

Methods This study was an institutional review board-approved retrospective study, with a waiver of informed consent. A total of 79 breast papillary lesions in 71 consecutive women underwent ultrasound and SWE prior to biopsy. Ultrasound features and quantitative SWE parameters were recorded for each lesion. All lesions were surgically excised or excised using an ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted method. The diagnostic performances of the quantitative SWE parameters were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Of the 79 lesions, six (7.6%) were malignant and 12 (15.2%) were atypical. Orientation, margin, and the final BI-RADS ultrasound assessments were significantly different for the papillary lesions (p < 0.05). All qualitative SWE parameters were significantly different (p < 0.05). The AUC values for SWE parameters of benign and atypical or malignant papillary lesions ranged from 0.707 to 0.757 (sensitivity, 44.4â94.4%; specificity, 42.6â88.5%). The maximum elasticity and the mean elasticity showed the highest AUC (0.757) to differentiate papillary lesions. Conclusion SWE provides additional information for the differential diagnosis of breast papillary lesions. Quantitative SWE features were helpful to differentiate breast papillary lesions.

However, treatment interventions and aftercare are strongly influenced by clinical primary diagnosis. We compared differential risks of reoffending of patients falling into six primary diagnostic categories following discharge from Medium Secure Units in the UK: schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder; delusional disorder; mania/hypomania; depressive disorder; organic brain syndrome; personality disorder. We followed up 1344 patients, on average 6.2 years (SD=2.1) at risk, discharged from 7 of 14 Regional Medium Secure services in England and Wales. Outcomes were period prevalence, incidence, and cumulative probability of criminal conviction. Established demographic and criminal history predictors of reoffending were observed across different diagnostic categories. Risks of all offending were increased for personality disorder, violence/acquisitive offending for delusional disorder, sexual offending for mania/hypomania and violence/acquisitive offending for organic brain syndrome. Patterns of risk over time differed markedly between categories of mental disorder. Most patients with personality disorder who offended violently did so within 4 years of discharge. A subgroup with delusional disorder demonstrated increased risk of violent offending 5 years after discharge. Differential risks of reoffending are observed between different diagnostic groups. Clinical diagnosis should be included together with established risk measures in risk management following discharge. Close supervision of patients with personality disorder should begin immediately after discharge when risks of reoffending are greatest. For delusional disorder further investigation is needed into the marked increase in risk of violence after 5 years. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Ultrasonography is the imaging technique of choice for diagnosing ovarian cysts because it makes it possible to differentiate them from other cystic lesions. Although most neonatal ovarian cysts regress in the first few months after birth, complications can occur during gestation or after birth. The manifestations of ovarian cysts on ultrasonography will depend on the complications. The management is controversial, although the current trend favors watchful waiting. We describe the different presentations of neonatal ovarian cysts with their complications and their patterns of findings on ultrasonography. We also discuss the differential diagnosis with other cystic abdominal lesions, and finally we discuss the therapeutic management of neonatal ovarian cysts. Copyright Â© 2016 SERAM.

We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of thyrotropin receptor antibodies in the differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) receiving pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin. Retrospective analysis of 274 patients with CHC receiving pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin. Interferon-induced thyrotoxicosis was classified according to clinical guidelines as Graves disease, autoimmune and non- autoimmune destructive thyroiditis. 48 (17.5%) patients developed hypothyroidism, 17 (6.2%) thyrotoxicosis (6 non- autoimmune destructive thyroiditis, 8 autoimmune destructive thyroiditis and 3 Graves disease) and 22 \"de novo\" thyrotropin receptor antibodies (all Graves disease, 2 of the 8 autoimmune destructive thyroiditis and 17 with normal thyroid function). The sensitivity and specificity of thyrotropin receptor antibodies for Graves disease diagnosis in patients with thyrotoxicosis were 100 and 85%, respectively. Patients with destructive thyroiditis developed hypothyroidism in 87.5% of autoimmune cases and in none of those with a non- autoimmune etiology (p<0.001). Thyrotropin receptor antibodies determination cannot replace thyroid scintigraphy for the differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in CHC patients treated with pegylated interferon.

The DSM-IV requires at least five specified symptoms for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe dysphoric form of PMS, while the ICD-10 requires only one distressing symptom for a diagnosis of PMS. Many women who seek treatment fall between these two diagnostic approaches, and standard diagnostic criteria for clinically significant PMS are needed. A diagnosis of PMS consists of determining the timing of the symptoms in relation to menses, meaningful change between post- and premenstrual symptom severity and a clinically significant severity of the symptoms. A differential diagnosis to distinguish PMS from other medical and psychiatric conditions is important for appropriate treatment. No hormone or laboratory test indicates a PMS diagnosis. The current diagnostic standard requires confirmation of subjective symptom reports by prospective daily diaries. Diagnostic criteria for PMS must recognize the broad range of symptoms, the temporal pattern of the symptoms and the critical issue of symptom severity, which differentiates clinically significant PMS from normal menstrual cycle changes.\n\nPerivascular epithelioid cell tumor in the duodenum: challenge in differential diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Zehong; Shi, Huijuan; Peng, Jianjun; Yuan, Yujie; Chen, Jianhui; Song, Wu\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDefined as a family of scarce mesenchymal neoplasm which distinctively co-express melanocytic markers and muscle markers, perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) have been reporte"
