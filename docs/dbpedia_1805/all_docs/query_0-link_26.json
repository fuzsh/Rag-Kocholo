They have a number of significant properties, such as the creation of a chemical bond with enamel and dentin collagen, a coefficient of thermal expansion almost equal to that of dental tissues and, most importantly, the ability to release fluoride ions over a significant amount of time (2,3)…(full text) | (read more)\n\nKeywords: glassionomer cements, bioactive materials, minimally invasive dentistry, fluoride\n\nAESTHETICS\n\nSMILE AESTHETICS APPRECIATED BY LAYPERSONS\n\nAndreea-Virginia Ionescu-Lungu, Mihnea Iacob, Irina Nicoleta Zetu\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.25241/stomaeduj.2015.2(1).art.2\n\nThe term “aesthetic” meets beauty, harmony and balance. As you know, beauty and aesthetics are subject to criteria that can vary infinitely, depending on various parameters including age, environment and trends. In recent years, orthodontists, and even the whole population, interest in aesthetics has grown a lot and is still growing (1). Although aesthetics can be very subjective and variable, depending on ethnicity may be defined characteristics of attractive people (2)…(full text) | (read more)\n\nKeywords: smile, aesthetic, buccal corridor, smile arch, gingival display.\n\nDENTAL MATERIALS\n\nFRACTAL ANALYSIS OF SOME RESTORATIVE NANO-FILLED COMPOSITE MATERIALS MICROSTRUCTURE\n\nIrina Nica, Simona Stoleriu, Gianina Iovan, Galina Pancu, Sorin Andrian\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.25241/stomaeduj.2015.2(1).art.3\n\nThe enormous research on ceramic nanosized particles during the past years has led to numerous innovations. One of these was the development of nano-composite materials, which are a relatively new class of materials of ultrafine phase dispesion, typically ranged between 1 and 100 nm. Experimental studies showed that various types of nano-composites lead to new and improved properties when compared to their micro and macro-composite counterparts (1)…(full text) | (read more)\n\nKeywords: nanofilled composite, microstructure, Filtek Supreme XT, Filtek Ultimate, fractal analysis\n\nORTHODONTICS\n\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT NEED AND ORAL HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN\n\nAbdolreza Jamilian, Alireza Darnahal, Sara Eslami, Bita Kiaee, Zinat Kamali, Letizia Perillo\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.25241/stomaeduj.2015.2(1).art.4\n\nMalocclusion in itself is neither a disease nor a life threatening condition; (1) nevertheless, the appearance of the mouth and a person’s smile plays a significant role in judgments regarding facial attraction. Thus, malocclusion has large physical, social, and psychological impact on the individual and society (2-4).

This chronic disease is caused by pathogenic microorganisms, three organisms in particular, Tanerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola, which have been directly associated with chronic periodontitis (1-3).

Deflective occlusal contacts will induce an irritable condition into the neuromuscular system which will be continuously reinforced with each closure through proprioceptive feedback…(full text) | (read more)\n\nKeywords: occlusal adjustment, occlusal equilibration, dental interferences, centric relation, deflective contacts.\n\nORAL IMPLANTOLOGY\n\nIMPLANT THERAPY DECISION-MAKING FOR ENDODONTICALLY INVOLVED DENTITION\n\nAlberto Monje, Fernando Suarez-Lopez del Amo, Carlos Andrés Garaicoa, Javier Nieto-Salas, Zhihui Tang, Jia-Hui Fu, Hom-Lay Wang\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.25241/stomaeduj.2015.2(1).art.7\n\nIn dentistry, preserving natural dentition is the primary goal of every clinician. However, dental diseases such as caries and periodontitis may influence the fate of the involved tooth. When caries or periodontitis affect pulpal health, endodontic therapy is required, whereby diseased pulpal tissue is removed and the root canal system is sealed from within the tooth With current technology, 94 – 97% of endodontically treated teeth have remained functional over 3.5 to 8 years)…(full text) | (read more)\n\nKeyword: endosseous dental implant, endodontic treatment, root canal, evidence-based science, decision-making.\n\nGERODONTOLOGY\n\nTHE USE OF ROTARY INSTRUMENTS IN ENDODONTIC THERAPY OF OLDER DENTAL PATIENTS\n\nAnastassios Retsas, Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos, Anastassia E.

Summary: Periapical periodontitis is one of the most frequent reasons for endodontic treatments. The outcome of the endodontic procedures can be assessed either by radiographs or Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). The periapical radiolucency can increase, decrease or resolve over a period of time. CBCT, as compared to periapical (PA) radiographs shows higher accuracy in detecting the real extend of periapical lesions, facilitating the visualization of the outcome of the treatment…(full text) | (read more)\n\nKeyword: atrophic maxilla, zygomatic implants, dental implants, surgical technique, implants success criteria\n\nBOOKS REVIEW\n\nKRANIOMANDIBULÄRES UND MUSKULOSKELETTALES SYSTEM: FUNKTIONELLE KONZEPTE IN DER ZAHNMEDIZIN, KIEFERORTHOPÄDIE UND MANUALMEDIZIN\n\nWolfgang Boisserée / Werner Schupp\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.25241/stomaeduj.2015.2(1).bookreview.1\n\n(read pdf)\n\nLES DENTS INCLUSES.
