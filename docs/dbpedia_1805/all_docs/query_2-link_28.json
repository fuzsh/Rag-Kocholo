We looked at the results of similar athletes to determine how quickly the athlete could improve on some stations and where is the path of least resistance to improve Getchis Mark's time.\n\nThe percentile rank is the current position of the athlete compared to the competition. It goes from 0 to 100, where 0 is the best and 100 is the worst. It show the potential improvement for each station. The athlete should focus on the stations with the highest potential improvement and the biggest duration.\n\nA big improvement in the Farmer's carry station will not be as impactful as a small improvement in the wall ball station for instance.\n\nJust click on a station to see how easy it will be to improve and how important it is to focus on it during training.\n\nDifficulty Chart"
