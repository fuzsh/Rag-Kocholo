        "text": "Influence of immune genetic profile in candidiasis\n\nInfection with Candida spp. appears in humans in various ways, such as mucosal or via bloodstream.[12] Genetic sequences have been identified in the human genome, which makes them vulnerable to Candida infections. The immunodeficiency associated with genetic factors involved in anti-Candida host defense could increase the incidence of CMCs.[13] These congenital genetic errors affect various factors and cause various illnesses. For example, a mutation in the phagocyte reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex (chronic granulomatous disease [CGD]), severe congenital neutropenia, and leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I are associated with aspergillosis and candidiasis, or a mutation in IFN-γ causes endemic mycoses. Errors in interleukin-17 (IL-17) and CARD9 lead to CMC and deep dermatophytosis, respectively.[14]\n\nIn a study to identify the genetic factors weakening the immune system, it was found that T helper 17 (Th17) cells play a role in immunity against Candida and Staphylococcus aureus.[15] Loss of skin or mucus, microbial imbalance, or immune system impairment may increase the sensitivity of mucocutaneous or invasive candidiasis.[16]\n\nGenetics is a decisive factor in the production of IL-17.[17] Candida species causes CMC to occur with frequent and persistent infections on the skin and nails or mucus membranes. Genetic abnormalities have the potential to influence the production of IL-17 by Th17 cells in response to Candida.\n\nThe Th17 cells produce IL-17 against Candida which genetic defects could affect. The IL-17 disorder could develop into CMC disease. Also, the germline mutations involved in IL-17 signaling are seen in CMC patients.[18] IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that activates other proinflammatory cytokines by signaling, including antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil chemokines, which have antifungal activity.[19,20] Secretion of autoantibodies against IL-17A, IL-17F, and/or IL-22, which is seen in patients with autosomal recessive (AR) autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), may cause CMC.[21]\n\nHIES is linked to impaired salivary function, which increases the susceptibility to oropharyngeal candidiasis.[22]\n\nBetween 80% and 90% of patients with APECED are affected by CMC. In a 2021 study, a large cohort of APECED patients and a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis were used to examine oral mucosal immune responses in APECED. The findings supported a theory that exaggerated immunopathology may increase susceptibility to mucosal fungal infection by compromising the integrity of the epithelial barrier, and that abnormal type 1-associated T-cell responses can be harmful to antifungal mucosal immunity.[23]\n\nAccording to a research on a family with three siblings who had chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis, a full deficiency of dectin-1 resulted in mucosal fungal infections. This is consistent with a previous study that showed dectin-1–knockout mice are susceptible to mucosal candidiasis.[24]\n\nResults from a 2019 study demonstrated that dectin-1 is necessary for the host immune response to Candida krusei in vitro and in vivo, and also that dectin-1–deficient mice are more susceptible to C. krusei infection.[25] Dectin-1–deficient mice were also previously shown to be more susceptible to Candida glabrata infection.[26]\n\nde Medeiros et al.[27] conducted an experiment on a Turkish family. In this family, there were three patients with CMC. The first patient had a treatment-resistant, cutaneous dermatophytosis, the second one had deep dermatophytosis, and the third patient had CMC with Candida encephalitis and endocrinopathy. In the genetic test, R70W CARD9 mutation was observed on them, and a decrease in IL-17, IL-22, IL-6, and Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secretion was observed.\n\nIL-23–deficient mice were found to be extremely vulnerable to Candida albicans. This occurs due to a decline in all myeloid cell subsets in the infected kidney, which then triggers fungal overgrowth and damages the renal tissue.[28]\n\nInfluence of immune genetic profile in aspergillosis\n\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is seen in patients with susceptible immunity, such as those with bronchial asthma and cystic fibrosis.[29] Polymorphism in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) allele G on Asp299Gly was observed to increase susceptibility to pulmonary aspergillosis. Also, the association between allele C on T-1237C and ABPA was observed.[30] SNPs have been identified in TLR3, IL4R, and IL13, which were associated with susceptibility to ABPA.[31] Early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) plays a role in the phagocytosis of fungi, so it is essential in the process of clearing fungi. Increased phagocytosis and acidification represent overactive monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in patients with ABPA, which causes a high cellular response to Aspergillus fumigatus in the airways.[32] The incidence of ABPA is 2%–15% in people with cystic fibrosis. The main treatment, including corticosteroids and itraconazole, has long-term complications, so monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, using agents like omalizumab, has improved asthma control in patients and is a treatment for ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis.[33]\n\nThe polymorphisms rs5743611 (R80T) and rs4833095 (N248S) in TLR1 and rs5743810 (S249P) in TLR6 have been linked to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, according to earlier investigations. The variation rs5743836 in the promoter of TLR9 has been linked to the development of ABPA. The development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis has been shown to be linked to the presence of SNP leading to an early stop codon (R392X) in TLR5 in Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients.[34] A 2021 study employed a mouse model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis to validate the involvement of TREM1 in antifungal host defense against A. fumigatus. The immunosuppressed mouse host was more vulnerable to infection when TREM1 was deficient.[35]\n\nCARD9, a signaling adaptor protein, has an important antifungal effect in people with AR CARD9 deficiency, as it activates antifungal immune responses.[36] Patients with recurrent fungal infections should be checked for CARD9 gene mutations in the absence of known immunodeficiencies.[14]\n\nOver the past several years, as human genome sequencing has been recognized, the relationship between fungal infections and CARD9 deficiency has become more pronounced.[37] CARD9 contributes to neutrophil accumulation in extrapulmonary tissues infected with Aspergillus, but does not play a role in neutrophil-intrinsic chemotaxis and anti-Aspergillus effector functions.[38] The function of CARD9 depends on different receptors, including immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing or ITAM-coupled receptors in myeloid cells or dectin-1 receptors. It also plays a role in the cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors by activating p38 and JNK kinases.[39] In a rare instance, CARD9 mutation is also seen in a patient with subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis caused by Corynespora cassiicola, which has various symptoms, including tissue necrosis.[40]\n\nA study published in 2021 showed that patients with CARD9 deficiency demonstrated selectively impaired innate and adaptive antifungal responses as well as increased vulnerability to A. fumigatus infection. Additionally, CARD9 KO mice were susceptible to pulmonary and cutaneous aspergillosis.[41]\n\nOverton et al.[31] conducted an experiment on SNPs in 95 ABPA patients, and 195 tagging SNPs were analyzed for genetic association with ABPA. Seventeen ABPA-associated SNPs (ABPA vatopic asthma) were identified, and three of them, including IL13 rs20541, IL4R rs3024656, and TLR3 rs1879026, remained significant after correction for multiple testing.\n\nIn response to proinflammatory signals and microbial moieties, stromal and myeloid cells synthesize the long pentraxin PTX3, which is crucial for the host’s resistance to A. fumigatus infections and is linked with higher susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Possible links between invasive mold infections, which are primarily caused by Aspergillus species, were discovered in a 2015 cohort study. The results indicated a significant association between invasive mold infection and PTX3 polymorphisms, including the rs3816527 AA genotype.[42]\n\nWeakened adaptive immune responses to A. fumigatus infection are linked to STAT3 deficiency. Additionally, STAT3-deficient patients are more vulnerable to endemic mycosis including cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis, as well as other fungal diseases, mainly CMC, and also pneumocystosis and fusariosis. According to an analysis of 74 STAT3-deficient patients (HIES) in the French National Cohort, 13 of them experienced at least one episode of pulmonary aspergillosis.[43]\n\nCGD is a primary immune disease that is an inherited disorder of NADPH oxidase that may be associated with fungal infections and the fungi that cause the disease are mostly Aspergillus species. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the most common way to treat CGD. Antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis and recombinant interferon-γ are other suggested ways.[44,45] In the examination of white cells of people with CGD, especially granulocytes and monocytes, it has been shown that the infection is caused by a defect of these cells in killing bacterial or fungal microbes.[46] In one patient with CGD, pulmonary infection was seen with Arthrographis kalrae, a hyaline fungus, which was not treated with antibacterial and antifungal medicines and posaconazole was needed. In this regard, new experiments have been performed on lung computed tomography (CT) scans for early diagnosis of pulmonary fungal infection in CGD. Pulmonary nodules smaller than 30 mm are the first signs of pulmonary fungal infection.[47,48] The genetic factors found to interfere with the production and function of T cells that produce IL-17 are STAT3-deficiency and AD-STAT1 gain-of-function mutations, which are seen in patients with autosomal dominant (AD) HIES.[21] IFIs, including Pneumocystis, Cryptococcus, and other endemic dimorphic fungi, as well as CMC, have been linked to STAT1 gain-of-function and STAT3 loss-of-function mutations.[49] CGD and HIES are most frequently associated with Invasive fungal diseases. Fungal infections are common among 28% of HIES patients, which are chiefly Aspergillus species. Invasive aspergillosis is crucial among these patients and could be located in the aspirate of the lymph node.[50,51]\n\nIt has been previously shown that IL-1 gene cluster polymorphisms are linked to an increased risk of developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.[52] In a 2014 research, it was also demonstrated that SNPs in IL-1B, IL-1RN, and IL-15 were associated with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA), supporting a role for the IL-1 pathway and implicating the IL-15 gene in CCPA susceptibility.[53]\n\nMannose-binding lectin (MBL) has been shown to be more prevalent in invasive aspergillosis patients. Surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2) has also been linked to susceptibility to CCPA and ABPA.[54,55]"
