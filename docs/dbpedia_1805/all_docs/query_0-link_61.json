        "meta_description": "Downloadable! This study investigates for the first time how the use of different information messages (i.e., health, sensory, and convenience benefits) about hybrid meat shapes British, Spanish, and Danish consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for such products. Hybrid meats are products whereby a proportion of the meat has been replaced by plant‐based proteins. Using a choice experiment (CE) involving hybrid burgers that vary across four attributes (i.e., ingredient, fat content, Carbon Trust label, and price), our results show that consumers are generally not yet willing to pay a premium for such new products. Furthermore, we found that consumer valuation for hybrid burgers strongly depends on the type of information provided and consumer characteristics. These findings provide useful guidelines on how information can be used in communicating the nature of the hybrid meats to the public in a cross‐country context.",
