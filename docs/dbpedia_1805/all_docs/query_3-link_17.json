A written consent was obtained from all patients. All data were retrospectively collected and recorded according to the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nChief complaints\n\nCase 1, 2 and 4: Abdominal pain.\n\nCase 3: Abdominal pain and vomiting.\n\nHistory of present illness\n\nCase 1: A 14-year-old boy was admitted with a 1-year history of recurrent pancreatitis. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, previously performed at another center, showed a cyst within the duodenal lumen.\n\nCase 2: A 16-year-old girl was admitted to our emergency room with abdominal pain.\n\nCase 3: A Chinese 11-year-old girl was admitted for 1-year history of epigastric pain with vomiting and weight loss.\n\nCase 4: An 11-year-old girl was admitted to our unit with abdominal pain and vomiting.\n\nHistory of past illness\n\nCase 1: His previous history was unremarkable.\n\nCase 2: In the past 2 years she had suffered from recurrent abdominal pain due to pancreatitis.\n\nCase 3: The girl was previously examined in her country, and a CT scan showed a cyst in the second part of the duodenum.\n\nCase 4: Unremarkable.\n\nPersonal and family history\n\nUnremarkable.\n\nPhysical examination upon admission\n\nCase 1: On inspection, the abdomen was distended with tenderness in epigastrium upon superficial and deep palpation.\n\nCase 2: Physical examination at admission showed a mild distended abdomen and diffuse tenderness upon superficial and deep palpation.\n\nCase 3: Physical examination showed mild diffuse abdominal tenderness upon superficial and deep palpation.\n\nCase 4: Physical examination showed severe tenderness upon superficial and deep palpation of the upper abdomen.\n\nLaboratory examination\n\nCase 1: Laboratory values revealed an increased serum levels of lipase (1077 UI/L; normal value (n.v.) 70-280 UI/L), amylase 514 UI/L (n.v. 15-53 UI/L) and C-reactive protein 168 mg/dL (n.v. < 5 mg/L), while gamma glutamyl transferase 69 U/L (n.v. 6-42 UI/L), count of blood cells, white cell count, total and conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase level, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were normal.\n\nCase 2: Blood samples revealed increased serum levels of lipase (2365 UI/L; n.v. 70-280 UI/L); the full panel of liver tests including cholestasis indexes were normal. US showed the presence of an anechoic cystic lesion within the pancreatic head. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts were normal.\n\nCase 3: Laboratory values revealed increased serum levels of lipase (43440 UI/L; n.v. 70-280 UI/L). The full panel of liver tests was normal.\n\nCase 4: Biochemical investigation revealed hyperlipasemia (5497 UI/L; n.v. 70-280 UI/L) and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (5.3 x n.v.), alanine aminotransferase (9.2 x n.v.) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (169 UI/L, n.v. 6-42).\n\nImaging examination\n\nCase 1: The radiological workup first included an abdominal ultrasound (US) that showed a heterogeneous hyperechogenicity of the whole pancreas and an intraluminal duodenal cyst (5.8 cm x 4.5 cm x 4.0 cm in size) near the pancreas head. An 8.5 mm dilatation of the main common bile duct (CBD) was also detected. Intrahepatic biliary ducts and gallbladder were normal.\n\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on HASTE T2-w sequence showed a homogeneously hyperintense cyst below the pancreatic head, located within a partially occluded duodenum (Figure 1A). On cholangiographic reconstruction the intrahepatic bile ducts were normal, the cystic duct appeared dilated with a tortuous course and the common hepatic duct presented saccular dilation. CBD had a caliber at the upper limits of the normal range with a regular course; the Wirsung duct was normal (Figure 1B).\n\nFigure 1 Magnetic resonance imaging on HASTE T2 w sequence. A: Homogeneously hyperintense cyst located within the duodenum, which was partially occluded (arrow); B: On 3D cholangiographic reconstruction, intrahepatic bile ducts were normal, cystic duct was dilated with tortuous course and common hepatic duct presented saccular dilation. Common bile duct had a caliber at the upper limits of the normal range with a regular course and was in communication with periampullary duodenal duplication cysts.\n\nCase 2: An MRI on HASTE T2 w sequence revealed (Figure 2) a round homogeneous hyperintense lesion on the pancreas uncinate process, determining a major compression of the second portion of the duodenum. At cholangiographic reconstruction, the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree along with the pancreatic ductal system were normal (Figure 2B).\n\nFigure 2 Magnetic resonance imaging of case 2. A: Round homogeneously hyperintense lesion at the level of uncinate process of the pancreas determined a major compression on the second portion of duodenum (arrow); B: At cholangiographic reconstruction, the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree and pancreatic ductal system were normal.\n\nCase 3: An MRI on HASTE T2 w sequence showed an oval heterogeneous hyper intense lesion, measuring 4.5 cm x 3.5 cm, containing multiple stones and located in the second part of the duodenum. Cholangiographic reconstruction indicated a normal/physiologic gallbladder as well as intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. The lesion, irregularly hyperintense, was located below the gallbladder and laterally to the CBD and pancreatic duct (Figures 3 and 4).\n\nFigure 3 Magnetic resonance imaging of case 3. A: An oval heterogeneously hyperintense lesion containing multiple stones and located in the second part of the duodenum; B: Cholangiographic reconstruction showed normal gallbladder and intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts.\n\nFigure 4 Magnetic resonance imaging showed periampullary duodenal duplication cysts filled with stones.\n\nCase 4: US examination found a cyst (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 1.6 cm) sharing bowel wall stratification with the second part of the duodenum and full of hyperechogenic debris. An MRI on HASTE T2 sequence detected an oval mass, located below the gallbladder and laterally to the CBD and pancreatic duct (Figure 5), adjacent to the pancreatic head. The cyst was filled with fluid and multiple stones. Cholangiographic reconstruction indicated a normal gallbladder and intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts.\n\nFigure 5 Magnetic resonance imaging. A: Oval mass is located below the gallbladder and lateral to the common bile duct and pancreatic duct, adjacent to the pancreatic head. The cyst was filled with fluid and multiple stones; B: Cholangiographic reconstruction showed normal gallbladder and intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nDuodenal duplications are uncommon congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract, which usually present during the first decade of life[4,5]. They represent 5%-7% of all gastrointestinal duplications and result from disturbances in the embryonic development, probably due to duodenal epithelial pinching during the outgrowth of the dorsal pancreatic bud or secondary to an epithelial sequestration[4]. The majority of them are cystic, adherent and located on the mesenteric side of the second or third portion of the duodenum, with an epithelial mucosal lining and a smooth muscle layer[10,21]. A communication with the duodenal lumen has been reported in up to 25% of cases[1], and some authors have also described the possibility of a pancreato-biliary involvement in 30% of patients, although this cannot always be the only explanation of pancreatitis[5,6].\n\nThree different mechanisms have been reported as responsible for pancreatitis: (1) External papilla obstruction by duplication enlargement; (2) Presence of an aberrant pancreatic duct within the duplication, which can become obstructed by mucus and debris; and (3) Migration of biliary sludge and/or microstones from the cyst into the bilio-pancreatic duct[3,4]. Migration of biliary sludge and/or microstones from the cyst to the bilio-pancreatic duct is possible only due to a communication between the duplication and the bilio-pancreatic duct with stone formation due to the bile stasis within the duplication seeing as its peristalsis is intermittent[2]. For this reason, the presence of stones or biliary sludge inside a duodenal mass do not ruled out the possibility of a DD.\n\nDD can be divided into two subgroups: periampullary (PADDC) and non-periampullary duplication cyst. According to Tröbs et al[4] periampullary duodenal duplication is defined as a duplication cyst located near the major papilla and the biliary-pancreatic ampulla, sometimes with a small aberrant pancreatic duct drained into the cyst[4].\n\nOur experience suggests the possibility of communication between PADDC and the CBD and pancreatic duct, which explains both the possibility of observing sludge or calculi in the cyst and the pancreatitis. Unfortunately, detailed descriptions of the relationships between duplication and major papilla and/or pancreatic ampulla are lacking, and our review found that only 17 out of 49 pediatric patients reported a detailed description of the DD that can be classified as periampullary type (Table 1).\n\nPADDC cases have been reported in childhood with a median age of diagnosis of 14 years (range: 3-18 years); this was consistent also in our series (Table 1).\n\nThe first radiological tool for diagnosis was US, which is highly suggestive for a DD when peristalsis and pathognomonic “double wall sign,” consisting of an outer hypoechoic muscular layer, an internal echogenic mucosal layer and corpuscular fluid inside the lesion, are found[22]. However, this finding should be confirmed with a more exhaustive radiological work-up by abdominal CT scan or preferably by MRCP[23], which provides more information about the location, size, enhancement and multilayered duplication cyst wall as well as anatomical details of the biliary and pancreatic ductal system. Furthermore, ionizing radiation should be limited as much as possible in childhood.\n\nMoreover, we suggest performing an EUS in children with a cystic lesion next to the papilla. In our experience, EUS offered two major advantages: (1) Endoscopic vision allowed a better definition of the intraluminal duodenal lesion and an accurate localization of the papilla; and (2) US vision highlighted the presence of an anechoic structure surrounded by a five layer wall, consisting with the typical echo-endoscopic feature for the gastrointestinal wall, distinguishing DD from the other cystic and neoplastic duodenal or pancreatic masses, including cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall, pseudocysts, cystic lymphangiomas, mesenteric cysts and choledochocele[4,24].\n\nIn particular, the performance of EUS to identify the presence of normal echographic bowel wall stratification at the DD allowed us to make differential diagnosis with choledochocele, where that hallmark is absent, but which represents the most frequent and challenging differential diagnosis. Furthermore, although many authors consider biopsy as the gold standard for the differential diagnosis between DD and choledochocele, duodenal type mucosa has been reported in choledochocele[25-27]. Sarris and Tsang reported 15 cases of choledochocele with duodenal mucosa at pathological examination[27,28].\n\nEventually, EUS can well indicate the relationships between the duplication and biliary-pancreatic duct. Therefore, when a PADDC is suspected, we suggest con sidering radiological (EUS) and anatomic criteria appropriate to confirm the diagnosis. Only 4 out of the 16 patients (25%) that were included in our literature review, underwent a preoperative EUS evaluation (Table 1), but this is partly explainable by the recent EUS availability in pediatrics.\n\nDespite having carried out the EUS, before proceeding with the endoscopic duplication unroofing, ERCP would have to be mandatory in order to obtain a detailed anatomic view of the bilio-pancreatic system and to detect a possible communication between the duplication and the biliary and/or pancreatic duct, particularly in patients with stones or sludge inside the cyst.\n\nEndoscopic treatment of children with PADDC was first described in 2007[8], and a later meta-analysis of the pediatric population confirmed the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of this approach in this population[10]. Our review revealed that 10/20 patients with PADDC (50%) underwent ET[6-9,17,19].\n\nTwo postoperative complications occurred (bleeding) and were both endoscopically treated; this point stresses the importance of ensuring a careful coagulation of the severed edges of the duplication. When planning an ET we thereby advise that a thorough preoperative radiological imaging encompassing EUS be mandatory, and our experience suggests that the real incidence of PADDC is underestimated because of incomplete preoperative imaging.\n\nThe anatomic location of the PADD and the possible communication with the biliary and/or pancreatic ductal system makes an open surgical approach highly demanding and not necessarily safer than ET. Furthermore, surgery has several disadvantages over ET, including worse postoperative pain, higher risk of postoperative complications, visible scars and longer hospitalization time.\n\nEndoscopic cyst marsupialization was highly effective in relieving symptoms and cyst disappearance even at long-term follow-up.\n\nUndoubtedly endoscopic management of PADDC requires a skilled multidisciplinary team, and the still limited use of the endoscopic strategy in a pediatric setting is probably explained, other than the rarity of PADDC, by the unavailability of a trained ERCP endoscopic team.\n\nWe suggest considering ET as a first line approach after a complete EUS study and reserving a surgical approach only when it is impossible to understand the relationship between PADDC and the pancreato-biliary tree.\n\nET provides marsupialization or incision of PADDC, therefore it is rare, but possible, to leave ectopic gastric or pancreatic tissue with potential risk of malignant degeneration.\n\nEventually, although DD (PADDC included) are generally benign lesions and only a few cases of malignant transformation have been reported in literature[5,29,30], a long-term follow up is mandatory in endoscopically treated patients, even in asymptomatic ones."
