        "text": "Orientations and implementation of Salesian professional schools\n\nZanni Natale, sdb\n\nIntroduction\n\nToday, professional training for technologically advanced companies is considered a strategic lever for competitiveness, an index of a country's industrial development. This was not the case in Piedmont at the time of Don Bosco. At that time vocational schools were poorly developed. Most of the vocational training was done through apprenticeship in the workshop of artisans. There was not much interest in a structured \"vocational school\". Don Bosco himself did not call his works dedicated to the formation of young workers \"Salesian professional schools\" but Laboratories, Workshops, Hospices for arts and crafts, Home for artisans [1] .They were environments in which students were taught a trade like good masons, shoemakers, blacksmiths, tailors, printers and they tried to give a cultural base and a Christian formation. The concern was to give a global education that would allow them to enter the world of work with professionalism and with a certain basic education on the dynamics of this world still very tied to a careful vision for a discourse of social justice. It was not easy also because many young people who came from Don Bosco were practically abandoned to themselves, with a very diversified education that did not allow, at least at the beginning, homogeneous interventions. For many it was important to find temporary accommodation that would allow some recovery of self-esteem,\n\nAs Don Bosco often said, it was important to train good Christians and honest citizens , capable of entering the world of work with professionalism and with a human, cultural and religious preparation to face the challenges of Piedmontese society. Don Bosco was already aware of this educational sensitivity right from the start, aimed at training competent students in their profession but also with a critical awareness of the reality of the world of work, which was rapidly evolving. Don Bosco was always attentive to social changes and tried to organize interventions with young apprentices in a flexible way, continually monitoring the situation in which he worked to grasp the changes.\n\nProfessional education in Piedmont\n\nHistorically it was not Don Bosco who first had the idea of ​​preparing students for a profession outside the world of work, outside the workshop of a craftsman in a school. In the 18th century there were some interesting experiments in the field. In 1820 Carlo Alberto, when he was not yet king of Sardinia and Piedmont, had introduced the Lancasterian schools that tried to give training to a trade albeit informally. In 1830 the Brothers of the Christian Schools introduced the metric system into the program with the related repercussions in vocational training and then in 1845 they opened the first evening technical school for young apprentices and workers. In 1949 the municipality of Turin entrusted, still to the Brothers of the Christian Schools,\n\nSimilar schools were opened outside Piedmont. But it was not the State that was interested in the problem, but enlightened and sensitive people who saw an evolving social world; a world, especially youthful, in great turmoil that demanded radical changes in society. They were religious or at least philanthropic, farsighted people who wanted to respond to social unease by considering it a potential cause of unrest, of protests and above all, for the most sensitive, a dutiful act of social justice. The Piedmontese society of that time was mainly peasant and linked to craftsmanship. Schooling was reserved for the middle class and illiteracy was widespread particularly in the rural world. Moreover, the crops of the earth did not always allow those who were not landowners a dignified life. This fact generated a certain poverty that pushed many people, especially the young, to abandon the countryside, and go in search of fortune or emigration or swelling the mass of generic workers, in the cities creating many problems of social coexistence. The industry was not very developed, particularly in the first half of the 1800s and concentrated almost entirely in the cities. At the beginning, Don Bosco had to clash with this reality and we can also understand how his first schools, laboratories, were not very structured. His speech was addressed to groups of very heterogeneous young people, fruit of that society that was not very sensitive to the precarious conditions in which the great majority of the population lived. and to go in search of fortune or with emigration or swelling the mass of generic workers, in the cities creating not a few problems of social coexistence.

His speech was addressed to groups of very heterogeneous young people, fruit of that society that was not very sensitive to the precarious conditions in which the great majority of the population lived.\n\nA certain revival in this field occurred after the middle of the century, with consequences also in the technical schools of that time. In Turin until the unification of the Italian state (1861) the main industrial activity was closely linked to silk processing. It had about 1000 frames distributed around twenty manufacturers. Then they began to see changes from the industrial point of view and in the training of personnel. In particular in 1860 the Application School for Engineers was founded which, at the beginning of the 20th century, then merged with the High School of the Industrial Museum (born in 1866) giving life to the Polytechnic of Turin. Around the eighties of the century a more visible industrial development began, highlighting the vocationthe mechanics of the city with the creation of Officine Savigliano destined for the production of rolling stock for the railways, and although the construction of the railways began around the 1940s, the workshops were a time of considerable industrial development for Piedmont. Then began the production of electric cables and in 1899, just at the end of the century, FIAT was founded which in the second half of the 20th century became the factoryof Turin. The Piedmontese society, therefore, in the first half of the 1800s did not have particular needs of workers, but of good artisans, while in the second half it changed notably and the professional training done in shop in a little structured way began to prove insufficient and not responsive to the needs of the new industries, therefore had to change considerably to meet the new needs.\n\nSalesian professional schools at the time of Don Bosco\n\nDon Bosco, attentive to the signs of the times, changed the approach of his interventions that went from evening meetings or holidays with unemployed immigrants looking for work, in need of a point of reference against the excessive power of employers to daytime interventions more articulated in real professional schools. Many other initiatives linked both to the industrial world and to the civil world, which became more and more present with new laws and operative proposals, contributed to increasing the will to change. Don Bosco reconsidered the problem of professional education and the training of young workers. The artisans, as the pupils of Salesian professional schools were called then,[2] .\n\nOver time the programs of the Laboratoriesthey are more and more clearly outlined. The demand for \"greater culture\" in the training of the young worker made itself felt more for the new sensibilities that were born in the world of work. To respond to this sensitivity, Don Bosco directed the training of artisans towards the acquisition of a basic human and religious culture and towards the acquisition of good manual skills to make the young man safe in his profession. And in this sense it was distinguished from the technical schools of the time that conceived professional training or as a theory about the trade or as an exclusive manual skill. Shortly before the death of Don Bosco in 1887, the aim of the Salesian Congregation to formulate a religious education was formulated and made more explicit by the chapter of the Salesian Congregation.\n\nThe originality, so to speak, of Don Bosco in this field consists in the attention paid to the real problems of young people. Not interventions calibrated on the average individual but on concrete subjects. Flexible interventions attentive to the initial situation of young students. This aspect was very important because the young people who entered Don Bosco's laboratories, particularly in the early days, had a heterogeneous formation; it was therefore necessary, at least initially, a motivational and cultural recovery, creating successful situations for young people who came from a society where they had had few positive experiences both in the scholastic world and in the working world. Don Bosco wanted to give a global formation to those young people; training attentive to professionalism, but also to the recovery of cultural and religious values. It was a methodological-didactic approach that did not stop at pure manual skills or at the theory of manual work without practical training, but tried to integrate the school with work. He wanted to go beyond a model of apprenticeship conceived as a long period of preparation in the artisan's workshop, where the young man was normally used for simple tasks, sometimes not even tied to the profession and above all he did not have the possibility to recover cultural and religious values.\n\nIt should be remembered that, in the early days, the young people welcomed to Don Bosco's oratory were mostly poor young people, with very diverse personal experiences and a low level of education. This was due to many factors, but fundamentally to the ruling class of the Piedmontese society of the time, linked to the restoration wanted by the Vienna Congress of 1815, after the French revolution. It, except for some laudable exception, had an aristocratic mentality of social organization. With regard to culture in general, he had an unenlightened and democratic opinion. In fact, he believed that:\n\n- culture must be reserved only for the few who hold power;\n\n- education is a danger to the stability of governments.\n\nThe cultural and professional training of the working masses was therefore not a priority. Even in 1861 male illiteracy was around 75% and the female one was even higher.\n\nThe reforms that were made in Piedmont improved things, more in words than in facts and in any case in them the role of technical - professional education was still marginal. [3] Training was not seen as a right of the citizen regardless of wealth or sex, so in a politically restless and expanding industrial society the lack of education was not positive and created many problems for Don Bosco as well. to manage groups of children with a very precarious and heterogeneous initial education. He, however, proposed objectives that he achieved by successive approximations with a didactic and a flexible methodology.\n\nEvolution of Salesian vocational schools\n\nFor D. Bosco, however, the ways in which young people were prepared for the world of work in both public and private vocational schools at the time were not satisfactory. The layout given to these schools seemed to him to be disrespectful and attentive to the reality of the youth world and therefore he experimented with alternative intervention models. \"Between the ancient way of establishing working relationships between the head of the shop master with the apprentices and the new model of the technical school required by the organic law on education, Don Bosco preferred to take his third way: the one of the great laboratories owned by him, whose production cycle, of a popular school level, was also a useful training for young apprentices \". [4] The 19th century was full of changes, sometimes rapid. The Piedmontese society, particularly its ruling class, however, did not prove very open to grasping the demands of innovation and democracy that arose from different parts of society, indeed often contrasted them. Don Bosco himself had to overcome not a few difficulties and misunderstandings both by the civil authorities and by the ecclesiastical authorities, but he succeeded in starting, in professional schools, a flexible and highly appreciated system enough to be proclaimed by Pope Pius XII, Patron of apprentices.\n\nHowever, the consolidation of professional schools took place with his successors. At the death of Don Bosco the Salesian professional schools were 15 and had different educational structures and organization. Don Rua, the first successor of D. Bosco, not only thought to increase them - they reached 88 - but I also try to organize them better and changed the name of the laboratories, workshops, hospices for arts and crafts , houses of artisans , in \"professional schools Salesian. \" These schools increased further. In 1953, the first centenary of Salesian professional schools, they were among vocational schools and agricultural schools 263 [5]. Few works, such as vocational and agricultural schools, have had admirers and supporters and have proven themselves guessing in their structuring. Sometimes born with modest means and to respond to situations of poverty and youthful unease, they have grown and updated, almost always earning a good reception from the population and the authorities. The worldwide development of such schools over time has not always been linear, but almost always growing not in individual countries but globally. In a century from 1856, when Don Bosco founded the first internal laboratories for shoemakers and tailors in 1953 a century later, however, they had a remarkable development. Only as an example do we see development under the various successors of Don Bosco.\n\nIn 1888, the year of Don Bosco's death, he was succeeded by Don Rua: there are 15 professional schools. In 1910 Don Rua died and was succeeded by Don Albera: there were 88 professional schools. In 1922 Don Albera died and was succeeded by Don Rinaldi: the there are 102 vocational schools. In 1931 Don Rinaldi died and he succeeded Don Ricaldone: there were 147 professional schools. In 1953, as a successor, Don Ziggiotti had 263 vocational schools. rarely of decrease. In 1963 there were about 277, in 2001 (367) and nowadays about 400.\n\nThese are data that could vary slightly: it depends on how a Salesian work is cataloged, a professional school; in the different countries, however, they clearly show the trend line. After the years 1960/1970, with the development of the post-industrial society, these schools had to face the new challenges that imposed radical changes in the world of work and therefore also in professional training. They, although with many difficulties, had to adapt to technological, IT and telematic innovations and to the emergence of new skills. It was a long and sometimes expensive process, still in progress today. The world of vocational training is, even today, continually evolving to update or change activities, both for economic problems and for social problems.\n\nOrganization of vocational schools\n\nWhile still living, Don Bosco felt the need to better structure these schools with unifying programs and schedules to be followed in all Salesian works that dealt with vocational training to better succeed in preparing young workers capable of overcoming the difficulties of modern civil society. without failing either justice or charity [6] .\n\nThese programs had to incorporate the demands: professional preparation and human and Christian preparation of young people. Despite the fact that there had been a number of debates about the need to give Don Bosco unified programs to these schools, it was only in 1902 that the proposals came to fruition with experimental programs, published later in a final draft in 1910. The areas of intervention and the hours to dedicate to each of them in all Salesian professional schools. They thus acquired a more defined and articulated structure, attentive to a global formation of the person in a rapidly changing society. The press of 1910 opens with a suggestive phrase that gives, in a certain way, the key to reading the publication: Coi tempi e con Don Boscoto emphasize the attention that we want to give to technological evolution and to global training. [7]\n\nCertainly in these changes the new sensitivities on the world of work had a great influence both in the ecclesial sphere where, with the publication of the encyclical Rerum Novarumof Pope Leo XIII (1891), the attention was strongly drawn to the reality of this world and to the problems related to it, both in the civil sphere, where in 1902 he legislated about the work of women and minors; and finally, in the Salesian sphere with deliberations made by the governing bodies of the Salesian Society. Great attention was given in any case to the learning of a concrete profession, which would allow a rapid, but at the same time critical, insertion in the world of work. Sometimes it was a necessity given the type of young people who accessed it; however in most cases it was a choice made by the educators of professional schools, aware of the educational value of the experience of manual labor. This approach to vocational schools continued and continues today in most schools. There are at least two reasons for this. The first concerns the capacity for motivational recovery of manual labor, where it is necessary. The second concerns his training capacity.\n\nHowever, learning a concrete profession is always seen as a part of the intervention, which must be completed by a cultural and religious formation. In these 160 years or so that separate us from Don Bosco's first laboratory, Salesian professional schools have come a long way with ups and downs. Many structures still continue to train workers; others have stopped; all however sought, and seek, to draw inspiration from an educational maxim that Don Bosco made explicit in an article drawn up in the IV General Chapter of the Salesians shortly before his death in 1886: “The purpose that the Salesian Society proposes to welcome and educate these young artisans are to raise them so that coming out of our homes, completed the training,[8] . These are indications that practically influenced the educational aims of Salesian professional schools in various parts of the world.\n\nThe festive oratory of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians for the integral education of girls (1888-1950)\n\nMara Borsi, fma\n\nThe formation of enterprising and responsible women in front of themselves, the family, society and the Church is the goal that directs the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians [9] in the animation of the oratories, schools, associations, training projects at work and assistance [10] .\n\nFrom the origins of the Institute the oratory is an important field of promotional and educational activity, but it is not the only one. In fact, in the first fifty years of history, a remarkable diversification of works was recorded [11] ; however, it is the environment that best shows the specificity of non-formal education proposed by the FMA in different cultural contexts. More than other works, the oratory connotes the preventive activity addressed to girls, girls and young people of the popular class and potentially exposed to inconvenience and risks.\n\nThe Institute pays constant attention to the expansion and animation of this educational environment, as shown, for example, by the journal Da mihi animas [12] , and currently, the process of re-launching the oratory-youth center - Ecco your field - promoted by the Youth Ministry Sector [13] testifies to the importance of this educational environment and its constant capacity to transform and renew itself [14] .\n\nThe sources of this study are the Constitutions, the regulations, the circular letters of the General Councilors, the chronicles of some works, the unpublished documentation conserved in the General Archive of the Institute concerning the speakers and some particularly significant studies for the period of time considered in this research.\n\n1. The FMA oratory in the wake of the charism\n\nIn the early decades of the twentieth century in Italy there are different educational experiences in the field of oratory that share the intention of providing for the Christian education of boys and girls. The Congresses of festive orators during this period are important forums for comparing current experiences that aim to identify the most effective Oratorian model [15] . Significantly, several of these conferences are organized by the Salesians [16]. In all of them the theme of the female oratory is discussed and its importance from an educational, social and religious point of view. It should be noted that in the same years the Masonic recreationists spread and a little later the socialist ones spread. Another element to keep in mind is the progressive recognition for girls of being able to take advantage of an extra domestic free time. [17]\n\nA significant influence on the development of speakers has the orientations of Salesian superiors and superiors who succeed one another in the time frame considered by this research.\n\n1.1. The general chapters (1884-1947)\n\nIn the deliberations of the first three General Chapters of the Institute, presented by Don Michele Rua, Don Bosco's first successor, clear references to the educational work of the oratory can be seen. The text in fact contains the Regulations for the installation and development of festive oratories at the Sisters' houses (1894) which hopes for the presence of the oratory in newly opened houses as well as in those that are already functioning and active [18] .\n\nIn 1895 the Regulation of the festive oratory is published which contains elements of affinity with the male of the Salesians and specific elements [19] . The text presents the identity and purpose of the oratory on the horizon of Christian education: the aim is the sanctification of holidays and the education of girls, especially the most abandoned and ignorant. In those of 1912 the aim is re-expressed in the following way: \"To promote the good among the maidens of the people, instructing them in the practice of our Religion by gathering them on holidays and offering them honest and pleasant recreation, far from the dangers of the world\" [20] .\n\nIn the General Chapters taking place in the first half of the twentieth century, attention is paid to the organizational aspects of youth associations, considered the \"soul\" of the oratory, to the relationship with the parish and with Catholic Action to avoid entering into competition or in conflict. The importance of using past pupils and benefactors to accompany the girls most in danger and least followed by families is recalled, to promote the Mutual Aid Fund among the young and the need to make every FMA capable of teaching catechism is reiterated in the oratory [21] .\n\nAfter the Second World War the rapid changes in mentality due to the diffusion and development of the means of social communication, in particular radio and cinema, are particularly felt. The need for speakers not only festive, but daytime begins, a summer practice now quite widespread in the FMA Provinces [22] .\n\n1.2. The circular letters (1917–1950)\n\nThe circular letters of the General Councilors (1917–1950) also propose interesting guidelines and stimuli for the care of this educational environment, considered crucial to safeguard fidelity to the spirit of Don Bosco.\n\nRecent studies show that in the first decades of the twentieth century the widespread use of colleges attached to schools absorbed the attention of the FMA and led to a certain rigidity of criteria and method at the expense of the Salesian tradition based on the implementation of the preventive system [23 ] . Here then is the invitation on the part of the General Councilor, Elisa Roncallo [24] , to welcome and treat the Oratorians \"precisely to the Salesian\" so that they can provide the Institute with their contact with society and the family that benevolence which is needed. to do good [25] .\n\nCaterina Daghero [26] , Superior General, calls the FMA to reawaken enthusiasm and commitment to the festive oratory and stresses that it is \"the Salesian institution par excellence\": it is not enough for every house to have an oratory, but it is necessary that it be considered really as the most important of the works. The invitation for each FMA is to dedicate oneself to the oratory \"with ardor and love\" so that the girls may attend it willingly. It recalls the preventive identity and the function of social regeneration [27] .\n\nIn the circulars, the General Councilors call for a reconsideration of the FMA Handbook on the festive oratory and the related regulations at the community level, recalling its social and Christian value [28] , recalling the commitment to increase it with creativity and recall that the best attraction the oratory is the gentle and sweetness of educators [29] . They also stress the importance of each FMA constantly asking God for the gift of predilection for youth, to get to know the young, to understand their disposition, their inclinations, to know how to take into account the characteristics of different ages and their diversified needs [30]. A veritable hotbed of Salesian vocations, the oratory is not a recreation center \"where young girls can find the entertainment their age requires and loves; but it is a happy and yet serious school of religion and virtue \" [31] .\n\nAfter the Second World War, the General Councilor Carolina Novasconi [32] recommended, in the event that the oratory is connected to a college, not to absolutely mortify the educational program: “College and oratory can and must live together fraternally: participate of the same rights, enjoy the same loving care as the staff, the same predilections as those of the Superiors, and do not be charitable if only the crumbs of what is profound for the benefit of the college are left to the oratory \" [33] .\n\nThe analysis of the circular letters underlines the commitment of the General Council to always keep the attention focused on the oratory, considered as the work that ensures in a privileged way the fidelity of the Institute to the Salesian charism.\n\n2. Nature and organizational elements of the FMA oratory\n\nIn 1902, on the occasion of the Congress of Speakers, there is a significant presence of FMA at the public and ecclesial level. In that important gathering the physiognomy of the Oratory of Nizza Monferrato, located in the Motherhouse of the Institute, is outlined and, thanks to a report by Luisa Vaschetti, then provincial, also those of Argentina are presented, one of the first nations in Latin America, where the experience of the FMA women's oratory has spread [34] .\n\n2.1. The Argentina speakers\n\nWith regard to the layout and organization of the oratory, it is essential in the various contexts to have an essential similarity in terms of spirit and method. Moreover, the Constitutions, the Manual and the regulations are detailed, with very little margin for the ambiguity of interpretations, and as we have seen, the invitations of the superiors to observe the norms are constant [35] .\n\nIn the festive oratory, Sunday is organized so that girls, preadolescents and young people can spend the day reconciling the presence in the oratory with the needs of family life. After the Eucharistic celebration, in the early morning, the girls return to the family to return later in the afternoon, which is characterized by play, walks, catechesis in groups, followed by a recreation that precedes the evening prayer. At the end of the day the girls have the freedom to stop again at the oratory before returning to the family.\n\nThe presence of youth associations or companies, considered as a school of Christian life, enriches the environment. Essays, catechetical competitions, Lenten catechisms, walks, lotteries, singing contribute to making the oratory different and attractive. The true secret of success is the good trait of educators towards girls, characterized by charity, benevolence, creativity [36] .\n\nLuisa Vaschetti, giving an account of the 23 speakers from Argentina, attended by 4500 young people aged 7 to 25, confidently states:\n\n\"While it was found that the festive Oratory is a table of salvation both for countries such as the great centers of our Italy, I would say that for Argentina it is the most effective of the means placed by the divine Providence at the disposal of the unsafe youth to guide it to salvation. The working-class youth especially, on holidays, pours into the streets, eager for outbursts and amusements that the perversity of the times do not fail to offer on a large scale in order to reach its perfidious end: \"the corruption of morals\". If one of these girls finds the door of an Oratory, she is safe and happy, because she has achieved her purpose, found the games and pastimes she sought, but found them in a healthy atmosphere, and without her having any see, you will feel driven to the practice of virtue \" [37] .\n\nThe chronicles of the communities of Buenos Aires, Almagro and Boca highlight the contemporary opening of the school and the oratory, the liveliness of the associative life on the model established by the official documents, activities and initiatives similar to those carried out by the Italian communities. [38] The girls who attend the oratory are generally workers in factories or in service as waitresses or students of state schools. Religious instruction is always at the center of the training proposal [39] .\n\nIn the Monograph published in 1906, which presents the Institute as the work of Don Bosco in its development and expansion in Italy and abroad, it is reiterated that the essential work that is not lacking in any of the houses is the festive oratory, place a serene and joyful meeting place for girls, an environment that keeps away from evil [40] . In the aforementioned monograph there is also a new way of being religious: the FMA are the soul of the games, they are surrounded by girls and noisy girls, they dedicate hours to deafening recreations and for this reason they are faced with different prejudices: seeing religious participate to the games of girls and girls is unusual [41] .\n\n2.2. Differentiated roles\n\nThe key figure of the oratory is the director . Called to collaborate with the director, who is normally the parish priest or another priest in charge [42] , she is responsible for the organizational and pedagogical aspects, in particular for the formation of catechists, assistants and anyone with an office in the oratory. A particularly significant moment is the formative conference with a fortnightly or monthly deadline: it is a useful meeting to build among educators that indispensable unity of purpose and convergence that makes the environment truly educational [43] .\n\nNext to the director there are other educational figures with clearly defined roles and tasks. Significant presences are those of the benefactors or patronesses who undertake to support the oratory economically and to follow the girls even outside the educational environment, in school life, work, trying to safeguard their dignity [44] .\n\nThe assistants of the oratory through loving vigilance maintain order and discipline in moments of prayer, during catechism, in recreation. The tasks of the catechist do not only concern the formal moment of religious instruction; it keeps itself informed about the girls' behavior and tries to set a good example in everything [45] .\n\nTo monitor attendance at the oratory, the figure of the chancellor is foreseen , who holds a general register of the oratory where the names, the data of the girls, the presences, the votes in conduct, the reasons for the definitive exit of a girl are marked from the oratory [46] .\n\nAnother role mentioned by the regulation is that of the concierge who, in addition to welcoming the girls with cordiality, controls their frequency. Attentive to those entering and leaving, it also plays a role of custody and protection in the face of families [47] .\n\nThe festive oratory is a real \"microcosm, well organized and regulated by clear and verifiable norms: even if on the one hand they would seem to stifle the spontaneity that must characterize a Salesian oratory, on the other they guarantee a serene and joyful oratorian life, in an alternation of play and commitment, catechism and study, associative and recreational life \" [48] .\n\nThe good performance of the oratory, and its success can be said, finds its nodal point in the educational relationship. Relationships inspired by the preventive system are the condition for achieving the goals of the project of integral education of the Salesian charism, which is expressed in a relationship of esteem and trust towards each girl, known in her personal reality. Relationships lived in an educational environment rich in stimuli, in which familiarity is lived and the aim is to involve and make the girls protagonists [49] .\n\n3. The experience between creativity and adaptation\n\nTo make Oratorian life appear in the ordinary fabric of educational experience I use a significant and authoritative source - the Chronology of Oratories - and some studies [50] .\n\n3.1. The female oratory \"Maria Ausiliatrice\" of Turin\n\nIn the first decades of the twentieth century, the boarding school and the school established themselves in the house of Nizza Monferrato; in Turin the oratory emerges, as a typically Salesian proposal suited to the urban context. The oratory stands out for its educational intervention style compared to the changes caused by industrialization in the daily life of the girls of the popular classes.\n\nThe female oratory \"Mary Help of Christians\", initially named after Saint Angela Merici, has a gradual development. The most significant period is that of Don Rinaldi, director of the oratory from 1907 to 1922, and of Sister Giuseppina Guglielminotti, director from 1911 to 1917 as documented by the study of Alessia Civitelli [51] .\n\nThe inclusion of young Catholics in society passes through moral training and cultural promotion. The intense associative life, which the oratory proposes from the beginning, forms young people open to emerging social issues, educated from a religious point of view, consistent in living Christian values, aware of the importance and responsibility of their future maternal function, whether it is lived in the vocation to marriage or in the consecrated life.\n\nChristian formation takes place through catechesis and religious practices, marked by fixed appointments during the liturgical year, and the proposal of spiritual exercises. This training is cleverly complemented by a plurality of educational proposals: evening and festive folk schools to combat illiteracy and offer a more rational education for domestic and family life, social conferences, the Filiae Sion gymnastics school , the theater, the academies, the school of singing \"Maria Ausiliatrice\", the walks, the awards and the parties. We also find, starting in 1909, specific initiatives for the protection of women workers such as the Labor Secretariat, the Mutual Aid Society and the Savings Bank [52] .\n\n3.2. The Sicilian speakers\n\nThe significant documentation we have on the Sicilian speakers allows us to highlight the essential elements of this educational experience rooted in a context so different from the Piedmontese one. Maddalena Morano, head of the houses on the island, asks that brief reports be drawn up on the progress of the festive oratories, which she herself promotes and disseminates in a widespread manner [53] .\n\nConcetta Ventura, in her documented study, notes that in Sicily the oratory opens at the same time as the other works and the strategies to start it are similar to those already experienced in Piedmont. The beginnings, however, are not easy because of the mentality of the time that wants the woman withdrawn at home and dedicated solely to the family. Workshops for the poorest girls are open in several speakers so that they can learn to sew and acquire a professionalism that allows them to earn a living. The development of speakers follows the line of adaptation to the situation of the context. In fact we find sewing and embroidery workshops rather than festive schools. The FMA with the speakers in their educational works or in the parishes try to promote quality religious education. Ignorance in this field is not only for the girls of the popular classes but in general for the whole youth population. Where the Salesians are not present, the nuns do not exist to take on children and adolescents, despite the rigid separation between the sexes present in the culture of the time.\n\nThe development of the day, the organization of the groups does not present many differences compared to those of Piedmont, but it should be noted a greater participation in the activities of the local Church and great attention to involve the best young women for the catechesis of the smallest [54] .\n\n3.3. Fragments of life from the history of the speakers\n\nThe Chronology of Oratories offers other important elements to capture the intensity of life that takes place in this educational environment.\n\nAs for the typology, the festive oratory prevails, but there are other interesting ways. In Brescia, for example, the oratory is identified with the evening school of the good housewife and the daily laboratory for the Oratorians who have finished the elementary course [55] . At Battaglia Terme (Padua) in 1938 the oratory continued all the time [56] ; in Padua, Istituto Don Bosco, from 1920 to 1924 a summer school is active [57] ; in Lugagnano (Piacenza) the oratory is daytime and festive [58] ; in Genoa it is daily [59] .\n\nThe source generally presents the humble and poor beginnings of the different speakers, gradual development thanks to the initiative of the FMA and to the support of benefactors and patronesses [60] , alternate events, difficulties [61] .\n\nThe Chronicle also informs about the relationship and the not always easy collaboration with the parish [62] . Other difficulties reported as a cause of crisis, of less presence and participation of girls in the oratory are linked to the alternation of educators, the advent of cinema and the spread of social life [63] . The source also shows the widespread dissemination of this educational environment on the Italian territory, its location in rural and urban contexts and in these preferably in peripheral and popular neighborhoods. What we read in the History is indicativethe oratory of Genoa: “Our work still retains a popular character, as is required by the Ward in which we live, the people who attend our house and the work to which we dedicate ourselves. The population feels at his disposal at all hours of the day without time limits, this if it often costs us discomfort and disturbance, gives us the satisfaction of being able to do a little good \" [64] .\n\nAt the heart of the training proposal is catechesis, addressed to the different age groups. It takes place in a path of religious and moral formation, deepened through religious schools or courses in religious culture. Among the educational and recreational activities, theater, singing, declamation and gymnastics stand out. There are numerous proposals to support the acquisition of professional skills through sewing workshops, the schools of home economics and the good housewife.\n\nThe Chronicle of Oratories also documents the charitable and charitable activities and highlights the missionary character of the oratory [65] . In fact, in several cases the chronicles declare that sisters and girls provide their services for the catechisms of the parishes of their territory or city [66] .\n\nThe young people are the protagonists together with the educators in the educational environment and feel the oratory as their home [67] . The testimony of this oratorian is significant: \"Every Sunday there was something new as if during the week the Sisters had nothing else to do but to think of us! How we liked to learn new games, find small surprises for reward and especially recite! In short, we became simple and casual little actresses and, apart from humility because it was all thanks to the Sisters, we surprised the public that we knew daughters of the people and factory workers, unable until yesterday to put together two words in Italian \" [68 ] .\n\nConclusion\n\nThe path developed in this study delivers the image of an educational environment in search of the most suitable proposals for the education of girls, boys and young people with diversified needs. The oratory's attention to the needs coming from the world of work, education, culture and spiritual formation makes the educational environment capable of promoting the girls of the popular class and those of greater social risk at the educational level. The oratory, more than a response to an explicit request of the context, is an unpublished proposal, an initiative characterizing the identity of the FMA.\n\nAn evolving society is reflected in the microcosm of this educational environment and a committed and enterprising female world develops, in fact, a lively association. Religious practices, socialization, acquisition of skills suitable for insertion into adult life, fun, characterize an environment strongly rooted in Christian principles. With socialization, the oratory favors a certain integration between social classes. In several places the extraction of the Oratorians is not in fact homogeneous, even if the popular one prevails.\n\nWe follow a pedagogical line adhering to the needs of girls. It is the people with their needs who dictate the choices, to stimulate the creativity of the FMA who work in the oratory and pursue specific goals: to train confident young people through reflection on current issues, to initiate them into a profound spirituality, to orient them towards forms ecclesial and social associations with high apostolic value.\n\nThese objectives are achieved in various ways: weekly or monthly conferences for the members of the associations present in the oratory, formation of the leaders and consequent involvement in the proposed activities, dissemination of the good press, courses in religious culture, quality catechesis at various levels, representations theatrical, various essays with clear formative messages, participation in liturgical celebrations, care of spiritual direction, experience of associative life according to personal interests and inclinations.\n\nIn the period of time considered, the oratory is placed in the wake of the ecclesial mentality that does not cease, in comparison with social evolution, to recall the female world to its first responsibility: that of working for the salvation of the family, the basis of society and the first nucleus of the Church. Participation in social life, supported and encouraged to bring Christian values ​​into it, is always subordinated to the presence and the roles played in the family. The girls' duty to make their own contribution to domestic work is not neglected.\n\nIf by emancipation and liberation of women we intend to work so that the dignity of the person is recognized and the society is more humanized, we can certainly say that the FMA speakers have made a positive contribution to a conscious inclusion of young women in the social reality of first part of the twentieth century in remarkable ferment and change.\n\nThe type of education of the FMA oratory is based on a project inspired by Don Bosco's preventive system declined for women. As constituent elements the priority of the person and attention to growth dynamics emerge, religious formation, the pedagogy of the sacraments, the environment permeated by human and Christian values, the vocational proposal, openness to social challenges, a wise presence educational and the climate of familiarity in interpersonal relationships.\n\nThe oratory is an institution appreciated and effective from an educational point of view as indicated by its constant and gradual numerical growth since the death of Don Bosco in 1950. The official statistics of the Institute indicate that in 1908 there are 131 speakers in Europe and in America 80. In 1928 in Europe there are 255 and in America153; in 1950 in Italy we find 410 speakers, 94 in other European nations, 296 in America and 32 indicated in the \"missions\" heading which includes those of the works opened in Asia and Africa [69] .\n\nThe oratory is an educational environment characterized by an integral formation in which convictions of reason and faith converge, and a relational style, proper to the preventive system, aimed at humanizing the people who interact and the responsible contribution they can give to society and to the ecclesial community.\n\nThe face and mission of the Salesian educational theater\n\nTadeusz (Tadek) Lewicki, sdb\n\nIt is well known and studied the intuition and pedagogy of St. John Bosco to recognize the educational value of the theater and to introduce it in the daily life of the educational institutions he founded; and the activity of the Saint as an adapter-writer of theatrical works and related productions, on different occasions, has provided an excellent example for the Salesian educators who followed in the footsteps of the founder in their theatrical activities, both as writers and as directors, or to use the expression of the constitutions of that time, as directors of the theater.\n\nThe present study would like to be an ideal continuation of the research started on the occasion of the Congress dedicated to Don Michele Rua (Turin 2009), focusing on some aspects of the Salesian educational theater, more specifically on the works of the most prolific author between 1884 and 1914, that is, of Don Giovanni Battista Lemoyne. He was entrusted with the editorial care and direction of the series \"Dramatic Readings\", for which the study of the dozens of dramas and comedies published under his direction could give an answer to the subject of my essay. What aspect of the Salesian educational theater emerges from the works then published and represented, and how could we outline, today with a historical distance, the characteristics of its educational mission, in the moral ethical sense wanted by Don Bosco? Which communicability of different contents reaches the boys-protagonists and actors of the Salesian theater and the internal public, that is, composed of peers-spectators, and the external public, that is, participating in the theatrical performances offered for the local communities in which the speakers and schools operated Salesian? One aspect of the mission of the Salesian theater is the social aspect, from the perspective of the most recent paradigms on theatrical studies that would like to rediscover the social incidence of contents, of the performative modalities characterizing this type of theater. If the study of contents is greatly facilitated thanks to the collection of texts, otherwise the problem of representation appears. The chronicles of the houses,\n\nDistinct features of the Salesian educational theater between 1884 and 1918 [70]\n\nIn the period that interests us we observe the significant passage from the form known as \"theater\" to the now theatrical forms, closer to the philodramatic model. This passage is mainly due to the dramaturgical seriousness of the works represented, even in the case of comedies. The dramas published above all in the series \"Letture Drammatiche\" but, in some cases, also from other Salesian publishing centers sprung up in that period, are now full-bodied works, with a well-elaborated dramaturgy, with significant themes ranging from biblical adaptations, through stories hagiographic of ancient Christianity, to historical dramas dedicated to the great figures of Christianity (also in Latin), up to the dramas that we could call social with ethical-moral intent and dramas dedicated to the missionary activities of both the Salesians and the Catholic Church. The repertoire of the Salesian theater also included the adaptations of known theatrical works and opera, but edited according to the possibilities of a youth theater for male boarding schools.\n\nAnother distinctive trait is the institutionalization of theatrical activities within the educational works, begun already by Don Bosco, but seriously developed by the figures responsible for the theater understood both as guides of the companies, and as curators of theatrical rooms. The Piedmontese model of the Salesian college, exported to various parts of the world, contained in its architecture real theatrical rooms with backstage, dressing rooms, technical equipment and wardrobe. In many cases of speakers and colleges it is possible to reconstruct a real seasonal proposal for theaters that also involved an ad intra and ad extra organizationactivities. In some speakers, above all in the houses of Northern Italy, philodramatic companies were born, composed of ex-pupils and Salesian cooperators. The congresses of the cooperators, in their final documents, underlined the theatrical activity, cultural as a very important field of the mission of the cooperators in the civil society.\n\nThe perspective of educational theatrological studies borders on the field of studies on Salesian communication, however always oriented to the education of young people, more specifically to religious education and in many cases ethical-social dramas to civic education. The theatrical activities of that period were also characterized by a significant aesthetic-artistic level of the productions, often enriched by specially composed music. A very special kind of Salesian educational theater was also born: the operetta, whose representation involved young actors, theatrical technicians and musicians. The publishing for cultural use included, besides the dramatic works, also the publications of the scores signed by different composers and masters of the Salesian environment and not only.\n\nThe analytical reading of the most popular dramas of the time reveals that dramaturgical writers realized in the proposed contents the fundamental principle of Don Bosco's \"theater\", that is, they represented the emblematic figures, exemplary in Christian behavior ready to sacrifice, healthy in moral conduct, responsible of others, above all of evangelization and civil progress. The positive figures of the represented adults corresponded to the principle of preventing and not repressing according to the educational thought of Don Bosco (the opinion expressed above all in the studies of Don Pietro Braido).\n\nThe young protagonists of the dramas lived their lives as teenagers increasingly responsible for their own personal decisions, sometimes going through moments of conversion that represented the dramatic highlight of the works. The dialogues between young people and adults, the positive figures in the dramas, echoed dialogues written by Don Bosco himself which concerned the defense of the Catholic faith and its true representation in the face of the threats deriving from the enemies of the Catholic Church and from the ignorance of the so-called pagan peoples.\n\nThe theatrical representation in the life of the college and civil society was traditionally included in the various religious and civil holidays. It was, after the liturgical celebration, the true center of the feast preceded by interventions of the religious and civil authorities and concluded with a final comment by the authorities of the college and / or oratory in a moral ethical key derived from the representation.\n\nAt that time the Salesian congregation opened its homes in many countries of Europe, in the Middle East and in various countries of Latin America and Asia. In the construction of many colleges dominated the model now experimented in Italy and composed of school buildings, interiors, the inner chapel or the parish church and the theater hall, also prepared for the musical activities of the works. The new houses were opened above all by those who had been trained in the houses of Piedmont and thus brought with them the experience of doing theater both in the style of work and above all in the dramatic literature proposed in that period, often translated into national languages.\n\nIt can even be noted that the Salesian educational theater of that period, 1880-1918, from the point of view of the repertoire is very homogeneous: many works, above all dedicated to the education and training of the children of Italian emigrants in different countries, also taught the Italian language and literature. Italians were also taught in formation houses. Thus, some popular dramas in Italy have been represented in Italian abroad, provoking a real appreciation especially in the civil societies of immigrants. In some cases, where the Salesian theater began to use the local (national) language, in complicated socio-political situations, theatrical representation in one's own language was perceived as a sign of resistance, of national identity.\n\nMost significant contents of the works of the Salesian educational theater\n\nThe dramatic works published in that period and popular on the stages of the Salesian theater belonged to the pens of many Salesian authors: let us pause, in this essay, on two most significant authors: Fr Giovan Battista Francesia and Fr Giovanni Battista Lemoyne. The first remains important in the history and mission of the Salesian theater for his works in Latin (for a linguistic analysis of the style of Don Francesia and in part of the contents, we refer to the article by Roberto Spataro “Giovan Battista Francesia author of theater Latin \", in\" Salesianum \"74/2 (2012), pp. 277-305).\n\nDon Francis Desramaut dedicated his studies to the life and work of Don Lemoyne in his doctoral dissertation, later published as \"Les Memoirs I by John the Baptist Lemoyne: étude d'un ouvrage fundamental on the jeunesse de saint Jean Bosco\" (Lyon , Maison d'Études Saint Jean Bosco, 1962). His main objective was the study of Don Lemoyne as co-author of the \"Biographical Memoirs\" of St. John Bosco. The novels and dramas find in that search just a hint and a few pages of attention.\n\nDon Francesia the Latin drama\n\nDon Giovanni Battista Francesia (1838-1930), a graduate in Literature at the University of Turin, distinguished himself in Latin studies, is characterized by Salesian historians as a prolific and versatile writer in the various literary forms. For the theater he composed a whole series of works in Latin. Some works, named by the author 'actio dramatica', are very short and dedicated to the great figures in the history of the Church. We remember their titles: De s. Aurelio Augustino drama actio in duas partes distincta (1886), Leo I (1888), Leo III (1892). The last two have been successfully represented on various jubilee occasions by Pope Leo XIII and the Holy Year. The \"Leo I\" was set to music by don Raffaele Antolisei and transformed into a melodrama. These dramas resumed the most important moments in the history of the Church faced by two popes: the invasion of the Huns and the Roman peace achieved by Leo the Great in the fifth century and, in the second case, the painful persecution of Leo III by his opponents, the miracle and meeting of the Pope with Charlemagne in which forgiveness and Christian clemency win.\n\nOther dramas have been dedicated to the figures of the young martyr saints of Christian antiquity: Ephisius, actio dramatica plautinis versibus conscripta (1895, later translated and published in Italian), Saturio , comoedia latinis versibus conscripta (1897?), Tarcisius, actio dramatica versibus senariis conscripta (1907), Euplius, actio dramatica versibus senariis conscripta (1911). The educational purpose of offering young people examples of fidelity to the point of sacrificing their lives for the Christian faith in times of persecution under Diocletian is clear.Ephisius tells the story of the conversion, of the martyrdom of the commander of the Roman army sent by the emperor Diocletian against the Christians.\n\nThe great event in the Christian history of Rome, the arrival of Constantine and his personal adherence to the Christian faith, expressed in a long monologue in the third act are represented in the drama Ad Romam, actio dramatica versibus Plautinis composita et in tres actus distributa , in to which Fr Francesia, inspired by the great Roman playwright Plautus, largely tells the story in the soldiers' dialogue (Act II and Act III), thus making the drama more popular in expression.\n\nThe author used an interesting dramaturgical intent in the drama Ad Golgotam, sacra actio dramatica versibus senariis conscripta (1910), narrating the story of the passion of Jesus Christ through the prism of the betrayal of Judas and his struggle with the devil Barbaal. The positive thread and the growing faith is instead led through the vicissitudes of Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea.\n\nThe plays of Fr Francesia represent the successful attempt to make educational theater in a didactic key, not only with historical contents, based on research in ancient sources of Christian history, but offering a valuable aid to the teaching of the Latin language. These works were written during the author's most active period, that is, his teaching in various Salesian schools. The dramatic structure of these actiones is well balanced, built from lively dialogues, with monologues of the protagonists full of pathos. The inspiration of Plautus ( imitatio plautina ) is clear, which in an active way helps to know the genre of drama according to the canons of ancient Greek and Roman drama.\n\nDon Lemoyne is the educational drama par excellence\n\nOur author, Giovanni Battista Lemoyne (1839-1916) writer and playwright, is generally recognized as the first historian and later biographer of San Giovanni Bosco. His biographers (Francis Desramaut, Eugenio Valentini, Pietro Stella) have dedicated numerous pages to his historical work, to his language and style, only by mentioning fiction and theatrical works. Through brief comments they recognized their educational, ethical and moral values ​​in a Salesian key and in full agreement with Don Bosco's pedagogical insights.\n\nAfter years of educational and training work, in 1883 Don Lemoyne joined the Saint of Turin and dedicated his life to the activities of historical writer, editor of magazines but he also wrote and published dramas first in the \"Letture Cattoliche\" and then in the series \"Readings Drama \"wanted by Don Bosco and entrusted to him.\n\nHis dramas are distinguished by the variety of themes undertaken, by the mature dramaturgical construction, the psychological depth of the characters and by the lively and so captivating dialogues for the young actors, directed by him and by other Salesians, who put them on the stages of Italy, Salesian Europe and colleges in the lands of Salesian missions.\n\nThe themes of the dramas vary: from biblical events ( David anointed king ) to those inspired by the New Testament ( Prodigal Son, The painting of the Madonna , The onomastic of the mother ), the stories of the martyrs of the persecutions of the first centuries of Christianity ( Sant ' Eustachio, Vibio Sereno, Seiano, Le Pistrine), the dramas dedicated to historical events and characters, in some cases well documented ( Christopher Columbus ), in others leaving more space to the poetic licentia ( Guilt and forgiveness ), to end with the dramas that They told the adventures of the missionaries ( A hope, or the past and the future of Patagonia). In his repertoire there is no lack of comedies that cheerfully depict human deficiencies and enjoyed great popularity both among the young actors and among their audience ( Who does good, well finds ; Who sleeps does not catch fish ).\n\nParticular attention deserves an allegorical cantata dedicated to Don Bosco for his 1888 name day, unfortunately never seen by the Saint (he died on 31 January 1888). This short work entitled L'Officina Amore e Riconenza , embellished by the compositions of the maestro Giovanni De Vecchi, was later known also with the title Giovanni, the factory , with the specification of the genre \"melodramma\".\n\nHis works were performed by Salesian students all over the world. In short, we only want to point out the contents of the works of that playwright-father of the Salesian educational theater.\n\nThe five-act drama, entitled Le Pistrine (The Triumph of Religion), is set in Christian Rome in the fourth century and narrates the slavery, rebellion and triumph of the Christian faith; some parts have been set to music and sung. Another work, Sant'Eustachio , narrated the history of Christian martyrs and offers young people an example of youthful faith ready for sacrifice and faithful to Christian ethical and moral principles. The definition of \"grandiose sacred drama\" was assigned by the critics of the time to the drama Seiano (composed in five acts), also set in Roman Christian antiquity.\n\nDon Lemoyne revealed love for history and a certain poetic vein in the play Colpa e perdono , set in the east of the 16th century: the action becomes lively in many protagonist-actors, warriors and pirates, and the drama has become very popular for its adventurous nature, pleasant for young people.\n\nFollowing the biography of Christopher Columbus (1892), in 1993 (published in 1894) Don Lemoyne also wrote the drama dedicated to the great Genoese. The adventures follow one after the other and in such an attractive but historically well documented way: the work narrates the 'discovery' of America also offering a picture of the main protagonists, and has been enriched by the cantatas composed by the maestro Giovanni Dogliani and for decades reigned on Salesian stages.\n\nThe Salesian missionary spirit of those years found correspondence in the play La Patagonia , which initially bore the title A Hope, or Patagonia's Past and Future . Also this work was written in a historical key to adventure and a certain pleasant poetic freedom in the youth theater.\n\nDon Lemoyne's works include comedies ( Giandujotto in college ), short comic sketches, comic poems often recited during the festivities in Salesian institutions.\n\nThis essay is intended as a trace for further research dedicated above all to the work of Don Giovanni Battista Lemoyne. The next paper written for the publication will be dedicated to the theatrological analysis of the dramas, hoping that the subsequent research, in the archives of the oldest Salesian houses, may also offer a picture of the activities of the Salesian theater in the civil communities.\n\nThe FMA and the education of young women in North-East India\n\nA historical study of the thirty years: 1923 - 1953\n\nBernadette Sangma, fma\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis article is a presentation of the study on the first thirty years (1923 - 1953) of the presence and installation of the Salesian charism in the north east of India. The first group of six FMA missionaries [71] came to this region on 8 December 1923. [72] Over the years, taken into consideration in this study, there were eight foundations, of which seven were scattered in different parts of the northern region east and one in the adjacent state of West Bengal.\n\nThe article aims to focus the study on the foundations, on the consolidation and growth of the educational works of the FMA with special attention to the performance of educational services and to the human promotion of children, girls, young women and women of the class poorer and rural areas.\n\n1. The FMA in the north east of India\n\nThe role played by the FMA in the missions of north-eastern India emerges from the many reports made on the life and growth of local churches in the region. Of particular importance and significance is the letter of Mons. Stefano Ferrando entitled: The Salesian Sister on a mission. [73] Referring to one of the communities, the letter offers a precise view of the various evangelizing and catechizing activities of the missionary FMA. It first of all underlines the systematic visits to the villages as a double-edged initiative allowing the FMA to play the role of precursors of the same Salesian priests in the kerygmatic mission and in the sustained process of evangelizing education and catechesis of the new Christians of remote villages in the remote areas of the region .\n\nIn the period in which the FMA arrived in northeastern India, education, even at primary level, was the privilege of a few semi-urban inhabitants who could afford it. The scenario was worse with regard to the education of girls and women, especially in rural areas. The FMA together with the Sisters of the Congregations of Loreto (IVBM) and the Daughters of Our Lady of the Missions (RNDM) can be considered pioneers in the education of young women in the region.\n\n2. The role of the FMA in the field of education\n\nThe educational mission of the eight communities scattered in the various parts of north-eastern India and West Bengal has taken on various institutional forms. Each community was designed to respond to the urgent needs of the context in which it was located. From the point of view of ethnic diversity, the communities were included among the different populations belonging both to the various ethnic-cultural groups and to the Indian majority. Thus, each community was implanted in a context that carried specific characteristic traits with regards to culture, tradition, language and customs. This involved learning a language, different customs and traditions in each of the communities.\n\nHowever, some common characteristics could be noted in the whole region such as: the general condition of illiteracy, the educational demand especially in the female world, the almost total lack of health care services. The entire region suffered from the lack of schools and the consequent general illiteracy; but the situation was worse especially for women and girls and for rural populations. Moreover, the region was pervaded by many infectious and, in many cases, deadly diseases. Hinting only at one of the consequences of this situation, it is important to remember the high mortality of the mothers that caused the existence of numerous orphans.\n\nIn such a context, the FMA response necessarily had to take various forms. However, it must be affirmed that the privileged attention was directed to the foundation of schools and to the physical, cultural and educational care of the orphans. To this end, the FMA have opened orphanages, especially for girls, formal schools for girls, offering a priority option for rural areas, which would never have had the opportunity to access such educational opportunities. The choice made necessarily required the establishment of boarding schools to meet the need for food and lodging for both formal schools and vocational schools. It is impressive to note the priority given to the education and cultural empowerment of rural young women and girls since the early years of the presence of the FMA in the region.\n\nThe initiatives in favor of adult women constituted the other side of the coin in complementarity with the formal and professional education of girls and young women. While the younger generations entered formal and professional education, the adult generations of the villages were recipients of informal actions aimed at improving the quality of life on a personal level, the care of children, families and communities in general.\n\n2.1. Schools for formal education\n\nThe field of work, in which the communities have invested more energy, creativity and personnel, has undoubtedly been the organization of formal schools. The momentum towards opening schools considered as an indispensable means of improving people's living conditions can also be measured by the efforts to organize more than one school by various communities. For this reason the sisters have bravely faced the obstacles posed by distance, harsh weather conditions, lack of personnel and financial support. It is moving to note the funding research effort described by the Jowai community for the construction of the second school. The chronicle describes the situation in these terms:\n\nOur purse is empty, there remain Rs.10 with which to face all the expenses up to the end of the month. At home we have nothing more ... we also sold our personal items. \"Stockings, sweaters, underpants, Sottane ... Let us pray ... Today Our Lady will also want to console us who are her daughters ... She who aroused Salesian work today, will also help us ... Please, yes he prays again and resolves to give the only Catholic in the village of Mentadu [sic!] miserable 8 Rs, with whom to provide some bamboo to start building the school, promising that we would give him another 12 to the finished work. .. Our wild, satisfied, immediately begins the construction of the school in a given ground purposely ceded for the school by Rangbah . [74]\n\nTeaching in schools was mainly carried out in the local languages: Hindi, Assamese, Khasi, Bengali, taking on the challenge of organizing them in a language they barely knew. The courage to face these challenges almost with an exciting naturalness and the creative method emerge from one of the letters of Sr. Giulia Berra to Mother Luisa Vaschetti:\n\n«... but you know, my beloved Mother, that my time is taken by assault: in the morning I have Assamese lessons in three sections of students, which are 48; and in the afternoon I teach Hindi in two sections of 16 students. Then, now, I must also teach a little Hindi to the newly arrived Sisters, I am in charge of preparing the tables for teaching reading in the Assamese language, and I am still without the Dictionary to explain the reading. I'll fix it as best I can; Our Lady makes up for what is missing to me and so far, the Authorities who visited us have been very satisfied with the progress of our students and our teaching method. They had special words of praise for this and for the progress of the girls in writing and drawing. I have already prepared eight folders with figures, under each figure, the letter in colors. But I would need sixty at least, that is as many as there are simple letters; and the same thing I should do for Hindi. But time passes here even faster than in Italy. I wanted to send you one of the texts used here in the school, so that you can get an idea of ​​these languages, but I can't send you anything other than a page of a syllabar script \".[75]\n\nFrom the aforementioned letter, the appreciation and recognition of the civil authorities for the surprising organizational efficiency already emerge from the first years of the beginning of the different schools. In addition, some communities immediately launched schools in English. The school in English, which began as Sr. Maria Bricarello in Guwahati, had shaky moments due to her untimely death in less than two years after arrival, since she was the only one who spoke and understood English. Other schools in English have been started by the communities of Dibrugarh and Bandel since the early days, while in other communities these schools were launched only later.\n\n2.2. Short teaching period in secondary school and in the female college of Guwahati\n\nBeyond the opening of formal schools by communities, an interesting and rich field for its context was the educational involvement of some sisters in government high schools. The request made by the government itself is first of all the sign of the recognition of educational competence and the positive image created in less than twenty years of presence in the place. The willingness of the FMA to accept and undertake the task almost immediately is impressive.\n\nThe first time the FMA were required to teach in the governmental secondary school and in the female faculty affiliated to the University of Calcutta [76] both in Guwahati was the month of August 1941. The teaching subjects entrusted to them were: English , Home Economics, Cutting and Sewing, Sacred Scripture, Rhetoric and Metric.\n\nThe echoes of the Second World War and the Indian Independence movement constituted the greatest obstacle in giving continuity to these promising and enriching services. In fact, on November 29, 1942, the principal of the college was obliged to request the dismissal of the FMA as a preventive measure in order to avoid consequences that could have been worse. [77]\n\n2.3. Professional schools for girls and young women\n\nVocational schools were founded primarily for older girls and young women who had passed school age. The main purpose of these schools was to offer basic skills in the field of literacy, that is: reading, writing, calculation, together with the purchase of some professional skills, basic knowledge of the household economy, health, hygiene and above all education to the faith. The different training areas were: weaving, sewing, embroidery and knitting.\n\nThis school began in 1924 in Guahati. The second vocational school was opened by the Jowai community. The chronicle of 8 May 1926 underlines the fact that, despite the absolute lack of means, the community has launched itself into the construction of a hall in which it was possible to start the professional school, on 1 October of the same year, with 12 young people. Unfortunately, there is no documentation on the professional school in Tezpur. From the chronicles it emerges, however, that it is one of the main activities of the community, which began as early as the first week of the arrival of the FMA on the spot. The other professional school began in October 1940 at Mawlai - Shillong.\n\n2. 4. Training of nurses in the hospitals of Guwahati and Ganesh Das\n\nFrom the various writings of the FMA we note that the mission serving the two hospitals of Guwahati and Shillong was not easy. The lack of personnel to deal with many tasks, especially in the context of cleaning the environment and the care of patients, weighed heavily on the nuns. The spirit with which the FMA lived their service attracted great respect from patients and above all from the authorities. A form of formative recognition of their presence can be measured by the request made to them to follow the practical training of the students. [78] This decision was certainly a sign of the appreciation both of their nursing competence and of their educational abilities.\n\nThe same request was also made in the Ganesh Das hospital in Shillong, in which, one year after the start of hospital service, the educational organization of the nursing school was entrusted to the FMA. The offer was accepted with a great sense of responsibility and with the knowledge that it could offer great opportunities for the young students of the school. [79]\n\nConclusion\n\nThe study of the first thirty years of the history of the FMA in north-eastern India shows that pioneers were animated by a strong charismatic educational momentum. Theirs was a story of great passion, of freshness of energy, enthusiasm and missionary sense. It is observed that they embarked on this mission with incomparable zeal, without calculating the needs and the sacrifices it entailed.\n\nIn almost all the missionary centers opened by the FMA, in the first years of their arrival in the region, they were the first religious to follow the thresholds of those places. Considering the fact that the majority of young women in schools and boarding schools came from rural areas, the FMA together with the Congregation of Mary Queen of the Missions ( Queen of the Missions ), can be considered the first ever to be committed to education and the promotion of young people and women in rural areas in the region.\n\nFrom the early days of arrival until today, the FMA have played the role of pioneer in the various contexts of North East India in the education of women and young women. The study of the educational role of the FMA, therefore, is an integral part of the study of the history of education in general in the region and of the education of women and young people in particular.\n\nMeaningful educational experiences\n\nof the Salesians in India from 1906 to 1951-1952\n\nScaria Thuruthiyil, sdb\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the missionary dream, which Don Bosco made on April 9, 1886, he saw his sons working in Calcutta.\n\nDon Bosco founded the Salesian Society in 1859 and, at the time of his death, in 1888, there were more than a thousand Salesians working in 57 institutions in Italy, France, Spain, England, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The first Salesian missionary expedition was sent to Argentina in 1875. In 1876 and 1877, after his visits to Pope Pius IX, Don Bosco seriously thought of sending his sons to India, to take possession of the apostolic vicariate of Mangalore. But Don Bosco failed to carry out this project due to lack of personnel.\n\nDon Bosco's fame as educator of the young, especially the poorest and most abandoned, spread far and wide, as well as in Italy, in Europe and in some Latin American countries. In 1883-1884, Monsignor Goethals, apostolic vicar of Calcutta, invited Don Bosco to take care of an orphanage in Giridih (Bihar). It was a very attractive offer, but Don Bosco could not accept, just for lack of personnel. It was after several years of correspondence, as well as personal contacts and negotiations, first between Bishop Antonio de Souza Barroso of the Padroado diocese of Mylapore and then, after his death in 1899, among his successor, Mons. Teotonio Manuel Ribeiro Vieira de Castro , who had personally known Don Bosco at Mathi in 1885, and Don Rua in Turin on December 19, 1904,They went to Tanjore (which was part of the Diocese of Mylapore), a province of the Presidency of Madras, India, on January 14, 1906, to take possession of an orphanage with the attached elementary school (St. Francis Xavier) and a school technique (S. Saverio Industrial School).\n\nIn this intervention I intend to present some of the salient features of the Salesian educational experiences in India from the beginning of their presence, that is from 1906 to 1951-1952, based on the available historical documents. In a word, we can say that the Salesian missionaries, who were invited and sent to manage some existing works: orphanages, elementary and high schools, and technical schools (vocational, orientation), turned them into iterations of Valdocco, walking on in the footsteps of Don Bosco and following the educational charism transmitted by Don Bosco to his children. In the same way, each new presence, started for elementary and high school students, as well as for students of technical schools, was permeated with the same spirit as Valdocco. The preference was always for orphans and poor boys, and for disadvantaged young people, most of whom were Christians. In all the missionary centers / stations in which the Salesians were involved in the mission of evangelization (preaching, conversion, baptism, teaching of catechism and other pastoral ministries) there existed and still exist schools today, from the elementary to the superior , often with boarding schools for children, especially for young people who attended vocational and / or technical schools. Many of these colleges were annexed to the residence of the Salesians, and in all these centers / institutes, the spirit of Valdocco reigned and still reigns. The first Salesian missionaries were imbued with the spirit of Valdocco and transmitted that spirit wherever they went and wherever they were present. I have had the fortune and the joy of knowing and living with some of the first Salesian missionaries and they are a fruit and a witness of their educational presence in India.\n\n1. Schools :. elementary, middle and high schools and technical schools\n\nSalesian missionaries left for India with two specific purposes, in harmony with the charism transmitted by Don Bosco: 1. education of the young and 2. evangelization of peoples, aimed not only at pastoral ministry and taking care of the faithful (Catholics) of the dioceses and parishes entrusted to them, but to the first evangelization: direct announcement / proclamation of the Word of God, focusing on Jesus Christ and his Gospel to the non-Christians, who for the most part belong to various tribal ethnic groups, on their conversion and baptism. In the field of evangelization the Salesian missionaries were men full of missionary zeal, who had risked everything, including health (some of whom died young even in the first years of their arrival and missionary commitment), like Saint Paul, to preach Jesus Christ and his Gospel. They were men of great faith in Jesus Christ, Mary Help of Christians and Don Bosco. They have had great success; the number of converts increased, Christian communities flourished; new centers and new parishes were opened; new dioceses were entrusted to the Salesians. (A true miracle of evangelization, perhaps one of the greatest in the recent history of the church?).\n\nEducation of young people, especially poor and abandoned children, was the primary objective of Salesian missionaries who arrived in India. Indeed, it is noteworthy that the first Salesian missionary expedition, in 1906, was in Tanjore, to take possession and manage an already existing work: an orphanage (boarding school), with an annexed elementary school and technical school (orientation), and this for a specific and explicit reason, that is, that the Salesians were known to be good educators, that they had and put into practice a particular system of education which they had received as a charism from their Father and Founder Don Bosco. And Don Bosco had dedicated his whole life to educating and taking care of young people, especially the poorest and most abandoned with the aim of training them as \"\n\nIn an analogous form the original project of the Salesians in different parts of India, especially in the cities (Don Bosco Liluah in Calcutta - Kolkata -, St. John in Bandel, Don Bosco in Krishnagar, Don Bosco in Tardeo, Don Bosco in Matunga-Bombay, Don Bosco in Velletri, St. Liceo Maria and the School of St. Gabriel in Madras, etc.) was to impart education especially to poor and abandoned children. In reality, an orphanage and a technical school were annexed to almost all the schools that the Salesians accepted. The Salesians were invited to reactivate, renew and improve these works both in terms of quantity and quality, transforming them into good schools, precisely Don Bosco schools , such as the Valdocco school, putting into practice the Educational System (Preventive System) transmitted by Don Bosco.\n\nIn fact, Don Bosco schools soon qualified among the best schools in India, not only for the number of students they attended (number of day scholars from 500-1000-1500-2000 and more, boardersfrom 50-100-150-200), but also for academic results, discipline, good conduct and for many other extracurricular activities. Even today, most Salesian schools in India, in competition with public and private schools, are at the top of the list for curricular and extra-curricular activities. In fact, it has been and still is more difficult to obtain admission for children and young people to Don Bosco schools than to get a good job. Likewise, even the technical schools of Don Bosco were considered among the best and most of them had received the official recognition of the State, and the pass-outsstudents have easily found jobs in various businesses, companies and other sectors. Even those who had only completed some training in a non-formal technical profession could find jobs.\n\nThe vast majority of the students of the boarding school, who attended Salesian schools, especially those in the cities, were Catholics, especially Anglo-Indians, but there were also Protestants, Jews, Hindus and Muslims, such as in the Don Bosco school in Liluah, Kolkata. Most day scholars, on the other hand, were non-Christians: Hindus, Muslims and others. In the same way, many of the Salesian school teachers were lay people, Catholics, some of them Salesian Cooperators, and non-Catholics (Hindus and Muslims). St. John's High School, annexed to Bandel Church, for example, as highlighted in the report (report of the Extraordinary Visitation) of Don Candela in 1937, was practically in the hands of the teachers, who were all Hindus and Muslims.\n\nThe Salesians had a particular fondness for young people in technical schools (technical school = vocational training school), most of whom were Christians, orphans and / or poor, who needed technical and / or professional training, in order to get jobs, necessary to fit into normal social and political life. The addresses offered were mainly those of mechanics: turner, fitter, driller, auto-mechanics and others such as: electrical engineering, carpentry, cabinet making, printing and bookbinding. An interesting aspect was that young people, while learning a trade, also contributed to some monetary gain for the school itself. For example, the Salesians, like Don Bosco, knew the importance of the apostolate of the press and in 1924 they opened a printing house in the technical school of Tanjore, and many of the typography students were orphans. The typography (of Don Bosco Technical School, Tanjore) printed and published Catholic literature, at the request of the dioceses, parishes, schools, single persons, etc .; also undertaken print jobs ordered by various government departments of the state, such as for example government, decrees, ordinances, sentences, publications for railways, etc. This was an important means of advertising also for the Salesians: for example, the also undertaken print jobs ordered by various government departments of the state, such as for example government, decrees, ordinances, sentences, publications for railways, etc. This was an important means of advertising also for the Salesians: for example, the also undertaken print jobs ordered by various government departments of the state, such as for example government, decrees, ordinances, sentences, publications for railways, etc. This was an important means of advertising also for the Salesians: for example, thethe life of Don Bosco and the life of Domenico Savio , translated into Tamils ​​by a certain Mr. TS D'Sami, were printed and published. The typography has a privileged place among the addresses of the Salesian technical schools (for example, Don Bosco Technical School in Shillong, the Catholic Orphan Press / COP in Calcutta, etc.). The Salesians used the printing of their technical schools for their publications: books, pamphlets, pastoral literature, diocesan magazines and newspapers, Salesian news, the Salesian bulletin, etc.\n\nA special feature of the technical schools was to take care of the humanistic formation of the students and, for this reason, the Salesians invented the Don Bosco Night School (evening school). Gradually, with vocational training, in the evening school, students received a general education in the various courses managed for them, such as English, sociology, economics, geography, history, human education, etiquette, religious education, theater, music, etc. For example, already in 1910, Don Mederlet started the Don Bosco Night School, in which technical school students, after technical training courses, received regular general education courses in the evening, which lasted from 5.30 pm to 8.00 pm. Similar evening courses became a particular feature also in the other Salesian technical schools, such as,\n\nAnother interesting and important aspect of the Salesian educational commitment was that in practically every missionary center (parishes and villages) entrusted to the Salesians - for example, almost in every village or at least in every parish of Tanjore, Mylapore, Shillong and North - East India, Calcutta, Krishnagar, Madras and Bombay - there were at least elementary schools, often middle schools and even high schools for Christian children (and not only) of the villages, who were poor, many belonging to the lower castes (dalit , scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Other Backward Classes - OBC). Practically, in every Salesian parish residence there was a boarding school for children, who attended public or private schools during school hours and for the rest spent time in the boarding school,\n\nThe education of young people was the absolute priority of every Salesian presence.\n\n2. Educational method (Preventive System)\n\nWhat could have been the reason for the vast growth and expansion of Don Bosco schools in India in such a short time? The answer lies in the educational method that the Salesians followed. In imparting education to children the Salesians put into practice the Preventive System, the educational method transmitted by Don Bosco. This characteristic, specific to the Salesian charism, was the main reason for the Salesians to have been invited to take or start new schools. The Salesians were known as good educators endowed with a particular spirit and method, experts above all in the offer of professional training (technical schools), and this was the main reason for being called to the mission of the schools. Don Bosco's educational method, an absolute novelty, put into practice by the Salesians,\n\nThe Salesians transformed their schools, particularly orphanages and boarding schools into educational communities where the preventive system of Don Bosco, based on reason, religion and kindness, reigned supreme. Both Salesians and children interacted with each other; Salesian assistance, carried out with children in the traditional roles of a Salesian community - director, prefect bursar, catechist, prefect of studies, assistants - became emblematic and felt they were forming a family. The boys felt they were loved, the foundation of the preventive system and the basis of every success. The Salesians loved their boys and in return they honored and loved them as fathers and older brothers.\n\n3. Schools imbued with the spirit of Valdocco\n\nIn every school, especially in boarding schools, the Salesians sought to actualize the spirit of Valdocco in the field of education and training. Thus, for example, when the Salesians took over the responsibility of the orphanage San Thome Orphanage in Mylapore, which had existed for over a century and was intended for Anglo-Indian children, on 10 January 1909, there were only 30 boys, who lived in conditions very poor and precarious. The three Salesians immediately began to manage the orphanage in the Salesian manner, following Don Bosco's method of education, which included, among other things, the time of daily prayer, participation in Holy Mass, the blessing of the Blessed Sacrament every Sunday, the daily recitation of the holy rosary, the frequent confession and communion, catechism teaching, including catechism competitions, preparation for the first communion and for the other sacraments; solemn liturgical celebrations, with a procession of songs, band music, fireworks, etc., in the feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary (above all of the Immaculate Conception, of the Assumption and of Mary Help of Christians), of Corpus Christi - all of which they were important and dear to Don Bosco and therefore also to the Salesians, and, of course, the solemn celebration of the feast of Don Bosco (January 31 after his canonization)! Thus the Salesians brought a new life for the children of the orphanage and in the technical school. They transformed them into communities (houses) where the boys and Salesians lived together as a family. Year by year the number of boys increased from 50 (1907) to 180 (1924). Naturally the Salesians have not spared, indeed they have done everything possible to improve the food, meet the material needs of the children (clothes, shoes, handouts, etc.), repair, improve, enlarge, build new buildings necessary for their home and for school. These were the commitments of the Salesians not only in the orphanage of Mylapore, but in all the other Salesian centers.\n\nThus, for example, in the first year of their arrival in Shillong, in 1922, the Salesians were entrusted, together with the parish, the orphanage (St. Anthony's Orphanage), which had been managed by the Congregation of the Holy Cross until then, and the former technical school which was run by the Salvatorians. In a short time, the orphanage S. Antonio was transformed into a house of Don Bosco imbued with Salesian spirit and customs. Apart from those mentioned, there were also other usual practices in every Salesian house (Valdocco and others in Italy) such as the evening prayer followed by the \"good night\", the hanging paintings of Mary Help of Christians on the walls of the classrooms, the hall of study etc. The boys were exhorted to recite the traditional three Hail Marys before going to bed, to wear a medal of Mary Help of Christians around the neck,\n\nSuch was the Salesian spirit, precisely that of Valdocco, which permeated all the other schools of Don Bosco (orphanages, boarding schools and technical schools): Don Bosco Liluah, Don Bosco Krishnagar, Don Bosco Tardeo, Don Bosco Matunga, Don Bosco Madras, etc. .\n\n4. Centers in continuous boiling for training activities\n\nEach Don Bosco school was a center in continual boiling with various educational activities, in addition to the academic one. The Salesians had given great importance to various types of extra-curricular activities.\n\n4.1\n\n\"A Salesian house without music is a dead house\". Following the example of Don Bosco and the first Salesians of Valdocco, the Salesians in India gave great importance to this particular feature of the educational formation of young people. Practically, in every orphanage (boarding school) and Don Bosco school, especially in the cities, there was a musical band. The Salesians were known to be good collectors of funds (also here following the example of Don Bosco) and they received help from benefactors for many projects, including that of buying musical instruments for the band, almost all brought or imported from Italy. The San Thome Orphanage by Mylapore, for example, obtained financial aid from benefactors from the British aristocracy of Madras for the extra expenses of the orphanage, and, although they were insufficient, they bought 25 new musical instruments from Italy to start a musical band - the San Thome Orphanage Band - in 1913, which became famous throughout the Madras Presidency and was invited to play in different places in Madras and around Madras. In the same way other Don Bosco Bands (Don Bosco Band Tanjore, Don Bosco Band Vellore, Don Bosco Band Shillong, Don Bosco Band Krishnagar, Band and Choir of Our Lady's House Shillong, Don Bosco Band Tardeo, etc.) were all famous and were also invited to play in official functions of the Church and the civil state. Apart from the educational and educational value of music, the Don Bosco bands have carried out good propaganda for the Don Bosco schools. With the introduction of the band, the Salesians offered the children not only the\n\n4.2\n\nSport has had a prominent place in the various extra-curricular activities of the Don Bosco schools. The Salesians were well aware of the educational value of sport. Organizing a sports day in schools every year became a tradition. The birth and organization of Don Bosco Club for Sport in Salesian schools took priority among extra-curricular activities. Some of these clubs became famous, for example, the Don Bosco Athletic Club Laitumkhrah, which began in 1923, became the number one sport in all of Northeast India. Athletes from various schools of Don Bosco participated in many sports competitions organized by civil and scholastic authorities, and often Don Bosco's boys won most of the trophies and returned home proud of their prizes.\n\n4.3\n\nThe Salesians gave great importance to the games and in Don Bosco schools there was every kind of game: football, basketball, cricket, hockey, etc. The boarding boys, for example, had at least an hour for team games every day. Football, basketball, cricket and hockey teams were also organized for outside students (day-scholars). Even in these games, the Don Bosco teams were the best in their districts (provinces) and also in the federal state. For example, Don Bosco Hockey Team of Matunga, Don Bosco Football Team of Krishnagar, were considered the best teams in their districts. Likewise other Don Bosco school teams, scattered in various parts of India, were among the best.\n\n4.4\n\nTheatrical performances, acting, musical competitions and singing competitions, both at school level and in school competitions, were of great importance in Don Bosco's schools.\n\n5. Internationality: one family\n\nOne of the first features that were noted was the internationality of the first, second and other groups of Salesian missionaries who came to India. They came from different countries: Italy, Belgium, France, Spain, Poland, Slovenia, England, Ireland, Australia, etc. and formed one and only family: the Salesian Family. They represented and witnessed the universality and catholicity of the Salesian Congregation.\n\nFrom the beginning the Salesians began to promote indigenous vocations. Already in the second year of their presence in Tanjore, in 1907, two adults, Ignazio Muthu of 28 years and Maria Arulsamy, educators in the orphanage, were admitted as aspirants, and in the following years they did the novitiate and philosophy in Portugal and Italy; they returned to India in November 1911 and were sent to Mylapore as Salesian assistants in the orphanage and at the same time studied theology at the San Thome Seminary and were ordained priests - a new edition of the formation of the first Salesians at Valdocco under the guidance of Don Bosco! Soon, other young people followed them not only from Tanjore, but also from other Salesian presences, such as the Don Bosco School (boarding) Liluah, the cradle of the first Anglo-Indian Salesians.\n\nThis particular characteristic, specific to the Salesians, was one of the main reasons for the many vocations and the expansion of the Salesian Congregation in India. In fact, several religious congregations (of European origin) in India have not grown or developed, some ha"
