This webinar aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these models, exploring their inner workings, training processes, and potential limitations. We propose an engaging session where learning meets practical application in a dynamic environment. Our goal is to show how these models can help us enhance and be more productive in our jobs, by helping us do the routinary tasks quicker leaving us more time to focus on the creative and challenging tasks.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Whitley Yi, Member Services Sr Manager of Delivery and Analytics, Adjunct Lecturer Well Digital, University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, AI Collective, USA\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Florencia Ojeda, Machine Learning Engineer, Professor Tryolabs ORT University, Uruguay\n\nSelf-care spans the wellness spectrum, from disease prevention to managing symptoms and common ailments, and the use of non-prescription medicines and medical devices. Globally, people are taking greater responsibility for their physical and mental health and are actively seeking reliable information to make informed decisions. Promoting self-care means empowering individuals to responsibly engage in managing their own health in an informed manner, rather than leaving them with no care. As pharmacists increasingly enable patients to make better health decisions, they must assure them that they may always count on their professional advice. To learn about this increasingly important role, join us on this event on International Self-care Day, 24 July 2024.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Luís Lourenço, Professional Secretary, FIP, The Netherlands\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Austen El-Osta, Director, Self-Care Academic Research Unit (SCARU), UK\n\n- Charlie Benrimoj, Emeritus Professor, University of Sydney, Australia\n\n- Jurate Svarcaite, Director General, Association of the European Self-Care Industry, Belgium\n\n- Bisi Bright, CEO/ Board Member, Live well Initiative/ International Alliance of Patients’ Organizations (IAPO), Nigeria\n\n- Kai Zhen Yap, Lecturer, National University of Singapore, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Singapore\n\nGlobal healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chains during humanitarian crises have become increasingly critical issues, requiring urgent attention to ensure the timely and safe delivery of medications and pharmaceutical products to patients in need. The importance of this issue is underscored by the consequences of supply chain disruptions, particularly during times of crisis. All stakeholders in the health and humanitarian supply chain, including pharmacists, play a key role in ensuring that safe and high-quality medicines are dispensed to patients during these critical situations. FIP is hosting a digital event to explore challenges and opportunities in maintaining a resilient supply chain, focusing on how to better equip the global healthcare system, particularly pharmacists, to respond to emergencies and crises, saving lives and improving patient outcomes.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Ruben Viegas, FIP Humanitarian and Sustainability Programme Manger FIP, The Netherland\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Wilson Chandomba, Consultant CMCOMMS, Zimbabwe\n\n- Ronald Guse, International Digital Health Consultant National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (United States), Canada\n\n- Eiko Kobayashi, Chief Pharmacist Japanese Red Cross Medical Center, Pharmacy / International Medical Relief Department, Japan\n\n- Lucas Ercolin, Area Manager IDA Foundation, Brazil (Currently living in Netherlands)\n\nInhalable therapies provide a unique advantage by offering both targeted, localized treatment and systemic therapy. Despite the many benefits of inhalable drug administration, current treatment for pulmonary disorders often rely on other delivery routes, resulting in suboptimal therapeutic effects and off-target toxicities. This preference is influenced, in part, by the presence of defense mechanisms in the lungs that are actively involved in clearing foreign materials including drugs entering the lungs. Inhalable nanoparticle-based drug delivery carriers, when optimized, have shown promise in delivering therapies in a targeted and sustained manner to the deep lung tissue for the treatment of several lung disorders including cancer, inflammation and fibrosis. This webinar will explore current strategies in the development and surface modification of inhalable nanoparticles to overcome barriers and deliver therapies effectively to the lungs. Specifically, we will discuss our recent efforts in developing polymer- and lipid-based nanoparticles designed to evade macrophage recognition and uptake in the lungs.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Mathew Cherian PhD, VP of Operations & Development ReVive Biotechnology, United States\n\n- Nikolina Biskic, Manager Regulatory Affairs, Switzerland\n\nPanellist:\n\n- Jyothi Menon PhD, Associate Professor, Biomedical, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Chemical Engineering University of Rhode Island, USA\n\nEn la Región de las Américas, el 16,6% de las personas mayores de 15 años son consumidores de tabaco. Dada la prevalencia y carga global y regional del consumo de tabaco, particularmente como factor de riesgo de enfermedades no transmisibles, es importante que se amplíe y consolide el papel de los farmacéuticos en la prevención y la deshabituación del consumo de tabaco. La FIP y su Foro Farmacéutico de las Américas le invitan a participar en este evento para conocer la carga del consumo de tabaco en la región de las Américas y el papel que pueden desempeñar los farmacéuticos en la deshabituación tabáquica.

Self-care is at the basis of healthier lives and populations, and therefore it is a pillar of more sustainable health systems and universal health coverage. As people around the world take greater responsibility for their physical, mental, and emotional health, they are actively seeking comprehensive and reliable information to make informed decisions, with or without the assistance of healthcare professionals, including pharmacists. This event will explore global self-care initiatives and highlight how pharmacists can utilise these in their practice and empower the public to promote self-care practices.\n\nModerators:\n\n- Dalia Bajis, Senior Programme Lead International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), The Netherlands\n\n- Gonçalo Sousa Pinto, Lead for Practice Transformation\n\nInternational Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), The Netherlands\n\nFacilitator:\n\n- Mfonobong Ekpoh, Practice Development and Transformation Projects Coordinator International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), Netherlands\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Manjulaa Narasimhan, Lead, Self-care for health and well-being\n\nWHO Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research, including the UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training (HRP), Switzerland\n\n- Judy Stenmark, Director General Global Self-Care Federation (GSCF), Switzerland\n\n- Hussain Jafri, Executive Director World Patients Alliance, Pakistan\n\n- R (Sham) Moodley, Pharmacist Pharmaceutical Society of South Africa (PSSA) /Independent Community Pharmacy Assoc (ICPA), South Africa\n\nIn the European Region, 25.3% of people aged 15 years and over were current tobacco users.

Their ability to perform quality work is also presumed to be compromised due to their pregnancy or motherhood responsibilities. Insufficient support and workplace policies exacerbate these challenges, including the absence of flexible work arrangements and adequate accommodations like maternity leave.\n\nThese inequities impact women across various sectors; however, they are particularly evident within the health and pharmacy workforce since women represent over 70% of the workforce in the health and social sectors1. To address these issues and inequities, it is crucial to challenge and dismantle the gender biases and stereotypes that perpetuate discrimination against pregnant women and mothers. EquityRx and FIPWiSE (Women in Science and Education) are hosting a digital event to highlight and address some of these issues, particularly those related to maternity leave policies.\n\nE-labelling, also known as electronic labelling, represents a significant step towards digital transformation in providing medication information electronically rather than through traditional paper information leaflets (PILs). At the 2023 FIP Congress in Brisbane, Australia, an insight board was convened to delve into the value, benefits, and barriers associated with e-labelling, its role in promoting health equity and equitable access to health information as well as the role of pharmacists in facilitating e-labelling adoption. Subsequently, a report summarising key insights and recommendations from the board was produced. FIP is hosting a digital event to build on the results of the report and to further explore e-labelling as a solution for improving accessibility and equity in health information, whilst also addressing challenges associated with the technology and regulatory aspects.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Dalia Bajis, FIP Senior Programme Lead, FIP, The Netherlands\n\nFacilitator:\n\n- Nour Eltahla, FIP Equity and Humanitarian Programme Manager, FIP, The Netherlands\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Ema Paulino, President, National Pharmacy Association (ANF), Portugal\n\n- Brett Simmonds, Chair FIP Regulators Advisory Group, Australia\n\n- Lars-Åke Söderlund, FIP Vice President International Pharmaceutical Federation, Sweden\n\nAs the pharmacy profession provides services to diverse patient populations, new pharmacy services and approaches that address social determinants of health and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals need to be designed with principles related to global health. Also, services must reflect the communities' needs by applying principles of global health and ensuring that communities' cultural and linguistic needs are considered to provide care for the whole person, integrating traditional practices, language, and health beliefs.\n\nThis session is designed to discuss examples of developing programs and services that achieve these goals, explore mutual benefits between multinational and interprofessional collaborators, and explore non-traditional means to enhance our effectiveness and recognition in service provision by patients and communities. This presentation aims to empower pharmacists worldwide with knowledge and strategies to develop services that reflect these principles.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Jeanine Abrons, Co-Director UI Mobile Clinics, Director, University of Iowa, College of Pharmacy, International Student Pharmacist Experiences, USA\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Ashleigh Wallace-Lacey, Consultant, Travel Medica, Dominica\n\n- Jane Boyd, Laboratory Instructor, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, USA\n\n- Carlton Languedoc, Head of Sales, Public Health, and Public Relations, Jollys Pharmacy, Dominica\n\n- Deb Dunkhase, Adjunct Instructor, Management and Entrepreneurship, Co-Founder, Open Heartland, University of Iowa, Tippie College of Business and Open Heartland, USA\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a preventable and curable disease.

This is coupled with the emergence of concern with respect to climate change. However, sustainability is more than environmental consciousness. Sustainable development requires consideration of all three pillars of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental.\n\nGlobal spending on healthcare is increasing more rapidly than the global economy, now accounting for 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP). The WHO note that this is of particular concern in low- and middle-income countries where health care costs are increasing more rapidly than in high-income countries. As public money funds the majority of healthcare expenditure, this gives rise to ethical concerns with respect to universal access and equality in the provision of health care to populations.\n\nSustainability has been further described in the Brundtland report as “meet(ing) the needs of the present without\n\ncompromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” (United Nations, 1987).\n\nThis session will provide an opportunity to discuss ethical considerations with respect to sustainable provision of healthcare for current and future\n\ngenerations.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Betty Chaar, Associate Professor The University of Sydney, Australia\n\n- Carl Schneider, Associate Professor in Pharmacy Practice\n\nThe University of Sydney School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Australia\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Cicely Roche, Associate Professor in Practice of Pharmacy & Trinity College Dublin Fellow in Education for Sustainable Development, Ireland\n\n- Sharon Pfleger,Professor Consultant in Pharmaceutical Public Health NHS Highland, United Kingdom\n\n- Sanya Ram, Senior Lecturer Auckland University, New Zealand\n\nJoin our digital event featuring FIP experts and specialists in Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA) for a key discussion on the evolving role of pharmacists in IDA prevention and management.

Fungal resistance poses a great challenge in the treatment of dermatophyte infections. To treat dermatophyte infections antifungal medications are prescribed which are usually given without confirmatory mycological testing. Moreover, they are overprescribed due to widespread use and availability of inexpensive topical antifungal preparations or corticosteroid–antifungal–antibacterial combinations.\n\nPharmacists can play a crucial role in appropriate antifungal prescribing through antifungal stewardship. They can educate patients, increase awareness and be effective stewards of antifungal prescriptions.\n\nThis webinar will focus on the growing issue of drug resistant fungal infections and highlight the role of pharmacists in this issue.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Manjiri Gharat, FIP AMR Commission Chair FIP, India\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Dallas Smith, Epidemiologist Mycotic Diseases Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States\n\n- Valeria Gigante, Technical Officer at AMR Division WHO, Switzerland\n\n- Darija Kuruc Poje, Vice President European Association of Hospital Pharmacists, Croatia\n\n- Anna Khanina, Antifungal Stewardship Project Officer National Centre for Infections in Cancer (NCIC), Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Australia\n\nThe World Health Organization has emphasised the importance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) education. The first objective of the Global Action Plan on AMR is to improve awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education, and training. To address AMR, all clinicians and health-care workers must become stewards of antimicrobials by prescribing them appropriately and educating their patients and colleagues on the proper use of this increasingly scarce medical resource.\n\nHowever, there is limited evidence regarding the educational needs of the pharmaceutical workforce at a global level. Both HCPs and students express a desire to enhance their knowledge and competency through targeted and effective education and training on AMR. Therefore, FIP developed an online survey to identify the educational needs of pharmaceutical students, practitioners and educators. This webinar will focus on the results of this FIP AMR education survey.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Catia Caneiras, Professor and Coordinator, Microbiology Laboratory of Environmental Health University of Lisbon, Portugal\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Rula Darwish, Dean School of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Jordan\n\n- Maarten Lambert, PhD Candidate University of Groningen, The Netherlands\n\n- Hamisi Msagama, Master Student in Global Health Pharmaceutical Society of Tanzania, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Tanzania\n\n- Souheib Kirat, Chairperson of Internal Relations IPSF, Algeria\n\n- Alison Etukakpan, PhD student Monash University, Australia\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic respiratory disease that requires comprehensive care.

Self-care interventions promote individuals’ active participation in their own healthcare. To support them on this journey, pharmacists are equipped with knowledge and skills to better their self-determination, self-efficacy, autonomy, and engagement in health.\n\nThis digital event is designed as a collection of three CPB Bites to equip early career pharmacists with essential self-care knowledge in the context of reflux management, irritable bowel syndrome, and respiratory symptoms (including sore throat). Issues around gender biases in patient interactions and during treatment will be highlighted.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Sham Moodley, Community Pharmacist Vice Chair Independent Community Pharmacy Assoc NEC on Pharmaceutical Society of SA - South Africa\n\nCo-moderator:\n\n- Gonzalo Miquel Adsuar-Meseguer, Community Pharmacist in Rojales, Alicante, FIP ECPG, Spanish Society of Clinical, Familiar and Pharmacy (SEFAC) - Spain\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Veronica Kihugi, Pharmacist Anaya Pharmaceuticals - Kenya\n\n- Anja St. Clair Jones, Consultant Pharmacist Gastroenterology University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust - United Kingdom\n\n- Leonila Ocampo, President Asia Pacific Institute for Medication Management (APIMM) - Philippines\n\nFacilitator:\n\n- Alison Etukakpan, Educational partnerships and projects manager - FIP\n\n- Genuine A.

This event is delivered as part of a new FIP programme supported by Pfizer, which aims to provide our members with approaches and tools for tackling key policy enablers that determine equity, access and sustainability of pharmacy-based life-course immunisation.\n\nThe success of pharmacy-based vaccination depends on various policy factors, one of which is access to data and vaccination records. FIP data shows that pharmacists’ access to patient vaccination records vary widely across countries and regions. Understanding the different models and country experiences is key to wider implementation. This event will feature pharmacy leadership bodies from across the world explaining their progress with access to records and how this impacts access to vaccination through pharmacies.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Lina Bader, FIP Lead for Equity, sustainability policy and development International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) - Netherlands\n\nFacilitator:\n\n- Nour Eltahla, FIP Projects coordinator for Equity, sustainability policy and development FIP - Netherlands\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Fei Sim, National President Pharmaceutical Society of Australia - Australia\n\n- Daphné Holt, Chair Coalition for Life-course Immunisation - France\n\n- Sarah Sorum, Executive Vice President & CEO Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin, an ASHP state-affiliate - United States\n\n- Catherine Duggan, FIP CEO FIP - The Netherlands\n\nMental health is a critical aspect of overall health and well-being. Mental health disorders are common affecting one in four people worldwide. However, mental health patient care services are often inaccessible, leading to negative outcomes such as disability and poor physical health. Pharmacists play a vital role in providing mental health patient care services, as they are often the first contact for the patients asking for help. Developing competency in delivery of mental health services is thus essential for pharmacy students and practitioners. To obtain a high level of knowledge and skills, but also attitudes and values required for these roles, a variety of teaching and learning methods can be used. As indicated in FIP-GCFE, teaching methods should be aligned with participants' needs and the context of learning. This webinar aims to provide an overview of pharmacists' roles in not just promoting mental health and well-being, but to highlight strategies to really deliver mental health patient care services among practitioners and students, and showcase experiences of capacity building programs in the mental health care.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Arijana Mestrovic, Director, Professional services Pharma Expert - Croatia\n\nCo-moderator:\n\n- Arinola E.

As compared to adults, children may be at greater risk of medication errors and potential adverse drug events due to individualized weight-based dosing, differences in compounded formulations and concentrations, inability of children to communicate adverse effects, and confusion between units of measure (e.g. milligrams versus milliliters). This session will provide “need to know” information about how to care for a paediatric patient throughout the care continuum (inpatient considerations, transitions between inpatient and outpatient care, outpatient considerations, and transitions from paediatric to adult care) as well as more advanced information regarding innovative approaches and technology implementation in paediatric pharmacy.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Juliane Mayette, PharmD, BCPS Clinical Staff Pharmacist Carondelet St. Joseph’s Hospital - United States\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Lauren Kormelink, PharmD, BCACP, Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Pharmacist University of Kentucky HealthCare - United States of America\n\n- Jorge Alberto Robledo, Biochemist, Pharmacist and PhD in Health Sciences, Director del Programa Interinstitucional de Prevención y Educación en Salud (PIPES) Bioquímico y Farmacéutico - Doctor en Ciencias de la Salud - Argentina\n\n- Sherif Kamal, RPh, MSc, DHCM, Pharmacy Program Director Health Sciences Academy Children’s Cancer Hospital Egypt - Egypt\n\n- Dr Régis Vaillancourt, OMM, CD, B.Pharm, Pharm D, FCSHP, FFIP, FOPQ Director of Pharmacy/ Directeur de la Pharmacie\n\nChildren’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario - Canada\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent and severe condition that progresses silently in most patients. As such, many patients are not diagnosed until the late stages of CKD, resulting in a greater risk of poor outcomes, such as end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or transplant. Community pharmacists and their teams are ideally placed to raise CKD awareness, identify those at risk and be the driving force behind earlier detection and referral to primary care partners for screening, diagnosis and intervention. At this event, the “Chronic kidney disease - Toolkit Guide” to support pharmacists in providing a range of CKD pharmacy services will be presented.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Lars-Åke Söderlund, FIP Vice President International Pharmaceutical Federation - Sweden\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Connie Marshall, Director of Expert Content IPG Health - Canada\n\n- Alfonso Pereira Céspedes, Adjunct professor Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Costa Rica, and University of Granada Spain - Costa Rica\n\n- Ronald Castelino, Associate Professor in Pharmacy University of Sydney - Australia\n\nIn this episode of our FIP CEO Interviews Podcast, FIP CEO Catherine Duggan and Shelita Dattani, senior vice president of pharmacy affairs, Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association of Canada, discuss the meaning of resilience at both individual and collective levels within pharmacists' workplaces and the broader system. The objective is to build resilience within these environments, enabling pharmacists to allocate more time directly engaging with their patients.\n\nThe focal point of this discussion pertains to fostering resilient workplaces, referred to as pharmacy homes, wherein pharmacists and their teams aspire to work. The objective is to cultivate resilience within these environments, enabling pharmacists to allocate more time directly engaging with their patients. Within this framework, speakers seek to explore the meaning of resilience at both the individual and collective levels within the workplace and the broader system.\n\nTobacco use is a global health problem with 1.13 billion smokers and 8 million deaths annually, including 1.2 million from second-hand smoke. It is a burden on individuals, communities and economies, causing various diseases and preventable deaths. Tobacco is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases such as chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes. At this event, FIP will launch a new handbook to support pharmacists and their organisations in providing a range of tobacco cessation services. This will be accompanied by a reference guide identifying the knowledge and skills pharmacists need to provide such services.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Lars-Åke Söderlund, FIP Vice President International Pharmaceutical Federation - Sweden\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Dongbo Fu, Medical Officer for Tobacco Cessation World Health Organization - Switzerland\n\n- Tan Ching Siang, Dean, School of Pharmacy KPJ Healthcare University College - Malaysia\n\n- Darush Attar-Zadeh, Clinical Fellow Respiratory Pharmacist North West London Integrated Care Board, RightBreathe - United Kingdom (England)\n\n- Inês Nunes da Cunha, FIP Practice Development and Transformation Projects Manager FIP - The Netherlands\n\n- Dalia Bajis, Lead for provision and partnerships FIP - The Netherlands\n\nDigital health has transformed clinical practice in many ways, and pharmacists need to be ready to use, create, and benefit from the new technologies. The 2021 FIP report on digital health in pharmacy education showed the importance of designing courses, materials, and practical experiences to train a pharmacy workforce with digital skills.\n\nAt this event, we will reflect on the progress made to date, launch the revised digital health in pharmacy course, and how this initiative builds on FIP competency frameworks and reports.\n\nCo-Moderators:\n\n- Jaime Acosta, Community pharmacist Farmacia Acosta - Spain\n\n- Dalia Baijs, FIP Lead for Provision and Partnerships - Bahrein\n\nPanellists:\n\nNaoko Arakawa, Assistant Professor in International Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, UK\n\nAukje Mantel-Teeuwisse, Professor of Pharmacy and Global Health, Utrecht University, the Netherlands\n\nWhitley Yi, Adjunct Lecturer, University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences\n\nMohamed Baraka, Associate professor of Clinical Pharmacy\n\nAl Ain University, UAE\n\nNatasa Jovanovic Ljeskovic, Dean Faculty of Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nBarry A.

They are also useful strategies when mentoring and communicating with persons of varied backgrounds to promote gender and racial equity and increase comfort levels of mentors and mentees who are varied in their background.\n\nModerator:\n\n-Shane Deselle, Associate Dean for Research and Professional Affairs Touro University California College of Pharmacy-USA\n\nPanellists:\n\n-Brooke Clubbs, Coordinator, MA in Higher Education Southeast Missouri State University, Department of Leadership, Middle & Secondary Education-UA\n\n-Efi Mantzourani, Reader in Pharma;cy Practice University of Cardiff School of Pharmacy-Wales\n\n-Imbi Drame, Amine Global LLC-USA\n\n-Heiko Spallek, University of Sydney School of Dentistry-Australia\n\nStress is defined as any type of change that causes physical, emotional or psychological tension, and it has been dubbed as “the health epidemic of the 21st century” by the World Health Organization. Stress is the body's response to any situation that requires attention or action, and everybody experiences some level of stress. However, high levels of stress may lead to various physical, mental, and emotional symptoms such as muscle tension, headaches, fatigue, sleep disorders, irritability, increased heart rate, and difficulty in breathing. Chronic stress is also a risk factor for the development or exacerbations of non-communicable diseases. Pharmacists have an important role in helping people prevent and manage stress though pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Filipa Alves da Costa, Assistant Professor Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lisbon - Portugal\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Carole Spiers, Chair International Stress Management Association - UK\n\n- Hahn, Martina, Clinical pharmacist University hospital Frankfurt and Department of mental health, varisano hospital Frankfurt Hoechst - Germany\n\n- Ricardo Cintra, Clinical Phycologist Farmácia Moreira Barata, Lda - Portugal\n\nEmpowering patient self-care improves health outcomes and reduces the burden of diseases. Improving health and self-care literacy is key to empowering pharmacy-based self-care. This is especially important when it comes to the management of minor ailments through pharmacy. Consisting of a series of five events focusing on common health issues, this new FIP digital programme aims to examine how pharmacists can be enabled to improve health and self-care literacy. Approaches for each of the five areas of minor ailments will be discussed including embedding health and self-care literacy into education and training, developing self-diagnosis and self-medication protocols, widening access to patient information, and improving referral strategies.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Lina Bader, FIP Lead for Equity, sustainability policy and development International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) - Netherlands\n\nCo-moderator:\n\n- Nour Eltahla, FIP Projects coordinator for Equity, sustainability policy and development FIP - Netherlands\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Muriel Schneider, Program director Global Self-Care Federation - Global but based in Switzerland\n\n- Jonathan Penm, Senior Lecturer The University of Sydney - Australia\n\n- Iqbal Fahs, Clinical Assistant Professor Lebanese International University - Lebanon\n\nSleep is a basic human need and it is essential for optimal health and well-being. However, lifestyle and environmental factors are increasingly causing sleep disturbances or sleep disorders. The negative effects of sleep deprivation include physical effects (e.g., sleepiness and fatigue), decline in cognitive function (e.g., diminishment of mental concentration and performance, increasing the risk of accidents and injuries), and mental health complications (e.g., increasing feelings of irritability, anxiety, sadness, and anger, and difficulty to manage stress). Sleep deprivation also increases the risk of chronic diseases. Pharmacists can play a role in managing and supporting people in dealing with sleep disorders through pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches .\n\nModerator:\n\n- Jaime Acosta-Gómez, Community pharmacist Farmacia Acosta - Spain\n\nPanellist:\n\n- Erna Sif Arnardóttir, Associate Professor Reykjavik University - Iceland\n\n- Bingqian Zhu, Research Associate Professor, Associate Dean for Research Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Nursing - China\n\n- Zaswiza Mohamad Noor, Associate Professor, Academic\n\nFaculty of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Universiti Kuala Lumpur Royal College of Medicine Perak - Malaysia\n\n- Julie Ann Dopheide,Professor of Clinical Pharmacy, Psychiatry and the Behavioral Sciences University of Southern California Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences - United States of America\n\nVaccination is one of the most effective measures to prevent disease transmission and protect populations from a variety of diseases that heavily impact individuals and health systems.

When pregnant individuals are vaccinated, they create antibodies that are transmitted to the fetus. Often, this immunity will protect the infant until they are old enough to receive vaccines themselves.\n\nAmong the different special-risk population groups for vaccine-preventable diseases, people that are pregnant have particular vaccination needs that will be highlighted at this event. Pharmacists can play a key role in raising awareness of the importance of vaccination among this population group.\n\nModerator:\n\n- Rúben Viegas, Practice Development and Transformation Projects Coordinator, FIP\n\nPanellists\n\n- Pat O'Brien, Chair, Vaccine Committee of the RCOG & RCM, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists - UK\n\n- Natalie Gauld, Consultant, Natalie Gauld Ltd - New Zealand\n\nFIPWiSE (Women in Science and Education) is a programme that was launched by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) on 11 February 2020 on the United Nations’ International Day of Women and Girls in Science.

It results in the underestimation and undertreatment of women’s pain worldwide. This is often referred to as the “gender pain gap”.\n\nRegarding the gender pain gap, self-awareness and training are not issues owned only by pharmacists; they should be shared with all healthcare professionals and the public.\n\nPharmacists can be supported to address the gender pain gap through education and partnerships. Good understanding of the variety of pain symptoms can support unbiased pain management. Pharmacists also have a responsibility to educate the public on where and how to seek help for pain management, thus further addressing the gender pain gap.\n\nThe event aims to\n\nDefine the gender pain gap\n\nIncrease awareness about gender pain gap\n\nDescribe how pharmacists can be supported to address the issue\n\nDescribe the knowledge and training for pharmacists to close the gender pain gap\n\nLearning objectives:\n\nUnderstand the gender inequalities in pain research\n\nIncrease their awareness of gender gap in treatment offers for pain management\n\nDescribe knowledge and training status on unconscious bias towards women in pain management\n\nDefine knowledge, attitudes and practices that pharmacists have, to close the gender pain gap\n\nDescribe how pharmacists can be supported with e.g. training, tools to address gender inequalities in pain management, bring close the gender pain gap, achieve behavioural change towards women\n\nChair:\n\n- Parisa Aslani, Professor, The University of Sydney School of Pharmacy, Australia\n\nFacilitator:\n\n- Aysu Selcuk, FIP Education and Primary Health Care Policies Specialist, The Netherlands\n\nPanellists:\n\n- Catherine Duggan, FIP CEO, The Netherlands\n\n- Jonathan Penm, Senior lecturer, The University of Sydney School of Pharmacy, Australia\n\n- Jack Collins, Postdoctoral Research Associate, The University of Sydney, Australia\n\n- Leticia Caligaris, Community pharmacist lead, Executive committee member, member of Pharmacist Association of Uruguay\n\n- Miranda Sertic, Associate Professor, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb, Croatia\n\n- Roger Knaggs, Associate Professor in Clinical Pharmacy Practice, University of Nottingham, UK\n\nPharmacists have an important role in supporting the management of minor ailments in the community and promoting informed and responsible self-care.
