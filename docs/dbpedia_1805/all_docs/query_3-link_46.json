        "text": "O1 Tumour heterogeneity: what does it mean?\n\nDow-Mu Koh\n\nRoyal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 5PT, UK\n\nCancers arise from unregulated cellular growth and exhibits a range of pathophysiological characteristics and behaviour. The term “tumour heterogeneity” encompasses a broad range of tumour features that have arisen as a result of different mechanistic processes including stem-cell origin, tumour evolution (linked to genetic mutations and adverse tumour microenvironment) and clonal resistance (as a consequence of treatment). Tumour heterogeneity may be intra-tumoural (i.e. within the same tumour), inter-tumoural (i.e. between lesions in the same patient) and inter-individual (i.e. between patients).\n\nThe understanding of tumour heterogeneity is important because it is a barrier to curing cancers; and improved understanding can lead to better individualised treatments. Tumour heterogeneity is linked to treatment resistance and the emergence of aggressive tumour phenotypes. There is thus a need for biomarkers to identify relevant tumour sub-clones to which specific therapies may be directed.\n\nCurrent approaches to enhance our understanding of tumour heterogeneity include genomics analysis using either multi-tumoural region and/or longitudinal tumor tissue sampling. However, non-invasive imaging using CT, MRI and PET imaging can provide an overview of the imaging characteristics of multiple disease sites across the body, thereby provide critical information about intra- and inter-tumour heterogeneity.\n\nUsing functional and molecular imaging techniques, imaging can be used to quantitatively measure different aspects of tumour biology; thus identifying imaging phenotypes linked to different stem-cell origins, gene expression, tumour evolution, treatment efficacy (including differential treatment response) and the emergence of clonal resistance. The emerging evidence for the use of imaging to explore and understand tumour heterogeneity will be presented and discussed.\n\nO2 Skeletal sequelae in adult survivors of childhood cancer\n\nSue Creviston Kaste1,2,3 (sue.kaste@stjude.org)\n\n1Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, MSN #220, Memphis, TN 38105, USA; 2Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA; 3Department of Radiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, 920 Madison Ave, Memphis, TN 38103, USA\n\nImproved diagnostic methods, treatment and understanding of the biology of childhood tumors over the past several decades have led to improved patient survival. In 2009, the U.S. population of childhood cancer survivors was estimated at one in 570 young adults aged 20 to 34 years [1]. This rapidly growing population underscores the importance of studying long-term complications of cancer therapy. While childhood cancer patients are returning to the mainstream of life, toxicities from prior therapy may compound or potentiate changes typically seen with the normal aging process. Physical consequences of disease and therapy (e.g., surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy) such as scoliosis, craniofacial dysplasia, and limb-length discrepancy, may present functional limitations, psychosocial challenges, and require extensive surgical interventions.\n\nHowever, skeletal toxicities [2] such as osteonecrosis [3-5] and deficits in bone mineral density [6, 7] are typically silent until they reach advanced stages when attempts at amelioration may be unsuccessful. These two sequelae result from multifactorial interactions including genetic predisposition, disease, therapy (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and physical activity. As both bone mineral density deficits and osteonecrosis may occur in a single patient, therapeutic interventions may be complex and standard treatment practices for one of these sequel may exacerbate the other toxicity.\n\nOsteonecrosis is an important long-term toxicity that can compromise joint functionality and, thus, quality of life in survivors of childhood cancer in whom it develops. Its development is multi-factorial but understanding of this process in pediatric oncology is complex and incomplete. Osteonecrosis affects up to one-third of pediatric leukemia patients and is typically asymptomatic in its early stage when most susceptible to treatment [3]. Despite this fact, it is only when pain occurs that osteonecrosis is typically suspected. MR imaging is the diagnostic modality of choice for screening, follow-up and risk prediction of functional deterioration in early stages and readily demonstrates osteonecrotic parameters such as size of the lesion, involvement of articular surface, presence of a crescent sign, etc. Clinical symptoms and demographics are predictive of disease progression in pediatric steroid-induced hip osteonecrosis [3].\n\nThis presentation will concentrate on what is known, factors as yet unknown, and potential implications of such toxicity. It will focus on bone mineral density deficits which may predispose childhood cancer survivors to earlier onset and more severe osteopenia and osteoporosis than the normal population. Also detailed, will be osteonecrosis which predisposes survivors to impairment of joint function. Therapeutic interventions for osteonecrosis are currently limited and ultimately, may lead to joint resurfacing or replacement at a young age.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSupported in part by grant P30 CA-21765 from the National Institutes of Health, a Center of Excellence grant from the State of Tennessee, the Le Bonheur Foundation (Memphis TN), and the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

However, the majority of breast cancers are still treated with a combination of surgery and radiotherapy, generally with some form of axillary procedure. Thus, the commonest locoregional effects of breast cancer treatment are secondary to surgery and to a lesser extent, radiotherapy.\n\nSurgical effects can be acute or chronic. Acute effects include post-operative seromas, haematomas, and infection. Postoperative seromas are extremely common and can persist for years [2]. Occasionally they may be very uncomfortable, especially in the axilla, necessitating ultrasound-guided aspiration, often repeated. Rare consequences of autologous reconstructions secondary to inadequate tissue perfusion include wound breakdown and necrosis, but in the chronic phase, the commonest complication of surgery by far is fat necrosis, which can present with a symptomatic lump. Though the imaging appearances of mature fat necrosis are characteristic, it can cause diagnostic confusion initially, with solid-appearing masses on mammography, ultrasound and MRI, and indeterminate or suspicious mammographic microcalcification [3]. Together with the less common epidermal inclusion cysts, the major issue with these benign complications is the resultant patient anxiety, since the main differential diagnosis is obviously local recurrence [4]. However, post-surgical complications tend to occur earlier than recurrent disease and the imaging differentiation is usually straightforward.\n\nThe short-term effects of whole breast radiotherapy are predictable, with radiation-induced oedema, skin and trabecular thickening, which is readily apparent at mammography and ultrasound. Such changes peak around 18 months post radiotherapy and then generally diminish. However, patients may be symptomatic with tenderness and focal thickening for years after radiotherapy. The longer-term effects are less predictable, particularly the development of radiation induced angiosarcoma [5]. The latency for this condition ranges from 3 to 20 years but with breast cancer increasingly becoming a chronic disease, it is likely that it will be seen more often. The other devastating effect of radiation to the axilla and supraclavicular fossa is radiation induced brachial plexopathy [6]. This highly debilitating iatrogenic complication is mercifully much less common with modern conformal radiotherapy techniques and careful observance of fields and dosages. Nonetheless the differentiation between radiation induced and malignant plexopathy can be challenging and may necessitate MRI and PET scanning [7, 8].\n\nRecognition of the long-term sequelae of conventional treatment of breast cancer has resulted in a move towards more breast conservation, (with oncoplastic surgical techniques if necessary), less axillary intervention (with less resultant lymphoedema) and accelerated partial breast irradiation techniques. These all result in specific imaging findings on surveillance mammography which the breast radiologist needs to be aware of, for example more frequent fat necrosis at the site of the surgical excision after intra-operative radiotherapy [9]. Finally, it is important for the general cross-sectional radiologist to be aware of the spectrum of normal imaging findings at CT after complex reconstructive surgery and to recognise when a finding needs further evaluation [10].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Advanced imaging modalities such as, Diffusion Weighted Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Perfusion Weighted Imaging, as well as Positron Emission Tomography with amino-acid tracers, may substantially improve the ability to orient a proper diagnosis and to guide patient management. When MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, Computerized Tomography (CT) remains an alternative diagnostic tool, even though its role in acute settings is mainly limited to rule out haemorrhage.\n\nEvaluation and depiction of the most common neuroimaging patterns of brain injury induced by cancer therapy is the focus of the present work.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Herold\n\nDepartment of Biomedical Imaging and Image Guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna/Vienna General Hospital, 1090 Vienna, Austria\n\nThe most compelling evidence supporting the use of low dose computed tomography in the screening of high risk populations for lung cancer was generated by the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial carried out in the United States by the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network. This trial was a randomised prospective study which included over 53,000 participants. Data from the NLST demonstrated that screening reduced mortality by 20 % in the CT arm [1]. Other smaller studies carried out in Europe have reported no mortality benefit. However, these studies included a younger screening population, had a smaller number of participants and probably did not have the power to show a mortality benefit. Major medical societies and US government agencies such as US Preventative Services Task Force and the Center for Medicare Services have now recommended LDCT. These decisions not only recommend screening but require US insurance companies and Medicare in the US to provide reimbursement.\n\nIn the United States, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) decision to provide reimbursement for lung cancer screening with low dose CT included a number of specific criteria for the establishment of lung cancer screening programs [2]. It requires a written order from a physician for the initial and subsequent screens and a required office visit with the referring physician in which the patient would be counseled concerning lung cancer screening and a shared decision making would be implemented. Also included are criteria for radiologist eligibility including certification by the American Board of Radiology or equivalent and the interpretation of at least 300 chest CTs in the past 3 years and documentation of continuing medical education. Radiology imaging centers must be accredited as well. The American College of Radiology is providing such accreditation. CMS is also requiring collection and submission of data by an approved national registry for each screen performed.\n\nThe American College of Radiology has developed a reporting system for lung cancer screening designated “Lung Rads” [3]. It is very similar to Bi-Rads that includes numeric categories. It associates CT findings with guideline based management decisions. LDCT findings are categorized from 1-4 according to the likelihood of malignancy. 1 and 2 are considered benign findings and 3 and 4 have a higher probability of malignancy. There are descriptions for each of the 4 categories plus an enumeration of findings. The categories include characterization of nodules including size and density (solid, part-solid, or non- solid ground glass). In addition to the categories and findings there are guidelines for management in each category with estimates of the probability of malignancy and the estimated population prevalence.\n\nSome of the caveats of screening result from the limits of generalization of the NLST results based on risk groups and demographics. There are also potential harms and complications from the LDCT screening which include radiation exposure, overdiagnosis/overmanagement, the use of invasive procedures for diagnosis and the high false positive rate [4]. Nevertheless, these potential limitations, harms and complications seem to be outweighted by the benefits of screening.\n\nIn the future, we will see a consolidation of the body of evidence and gain new insights through the pooling of the European trial data (Nelson [5]), and the UK Lung Cancer Screening trial pilot study [6].\n\nReferences:\n\n1) Aberle DR, Adams AM, Berg CD, Black WC, Clapp JD, Fagerstrom RM, et al, National Lung Screening Trial Research Team.

McLoud\n\nDepartment of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA\n\nRisk stratification is important for large and small nodules. Special issues arise with small pulmonary nodules defined as less than 8 mm. The vast majority of these are benign.\n\nThere are both clinical and imaging risk factors for malignancy that should be taken into account. Clinical risk factors include older age, history of smoking, history of extrathoracic cancer within 5 years, and family history of cancer. The CT characteristics that indicate risk from malignancy include a size of greater than 8 mm, certain border characteristics, density features, growth, and location. A presumptive benign diagnosis can be made on the basis of 2 year stability excluding ground glass nodules which require longer follow-up. Benign calcification (diffuse, central, laminated, and popcorn), the presence of fat, a size less than 4 mm and perifissural location are very strong predictors of benignity and no further evaluation of such nodules is required.\n\nAdequate evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules requires thin section CT with a 1.5 to 2 mm slice thickness.\n\nThe solidity of nodules is important in determining their malignant potential. Among purely solid nodules, a size greater than 8 mm, location in the upper lobes, spiculated or lobulated contour, and internal characteristics such as eccentric calcification, air bronchograms and cavitation are helpful predictors of malignancy in addition to the growth rate. Small nodules less than 4 mm have less than a 0.5 % chance of malignancy even in smokers. Nodules in the range of 8-10 mm or greater have a 10-20 % chance of malignancy. The management of small solid nodules less than 8 mm often consists of imaging follow-up according to current recommendations by the Fleischner Society.\n\nSubsolid nodules represent the spectrum of peripheral adenocarcinomas of the lung and may be mixed part solid/part ground glass or pure ground glass nodules. Part solid nodules have the highest likelihood of malignancy in the range of 60 to 70 %. Malignancy in subsolid nodules is associated both with lesion growth and the development and growth of the solid component.\n\nIn summary, small solitary pulmonary nodules commonly detected on CT are mostly benign. It is imperative that clinical risk factors which are mostly socio-demographic be evaluated. Important imaging findings in determining the risk of malignancy includes size, location, morphology and classic benign features, growth rate, and solidity.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

It is evident that FDG-PET does not replace the need for pathologic examination, but contributes to decisions about when to obtain tissue and from what location(s). Studies have shown repeatedly that overall patient survival and progression-free survival in NSCLC are predicted by the lesion intensity in FDG-PET at initial characterization [2-4]. Thus, although many non-neoplastic lesions can be FDG-avid, and while many instances of low-grade malignancy may be FDG “negative”, use of serial anatomic imaging in the latter patients may suffice to characterize lesions, without significant risk of upstaging when malignancy is found in a growing lesion. Presence of avid FDG uptake in a new pulmonary lesion identifies cases where tissue diagnosis should be expedited, and may serve simultaneously to stage the malignancy. More recent evidence suggests an added role of FDG-PET in directing needle biopsy of pulmonary lesions, improving diagnostic yield [5].\n\nAn emerging application of FDG-PET in NSCLC is in the assessment of therapeutic response [6], and in the possibility of applying individualised, adaptive therapy. Studies in the use of external beam radiotherapy have identified predictive value of initial FDG activity patterns in NSCLC lesion(s) with the likelihood of post-therapeutic relapse [7]. Other studies have identified that early tumor response to radiotherapy may be predicted well before completion of dose delivery [8], supporting the novel development of protocols based on re-planning and re-targeting of remaining radiation dose midway during treatment. A similar strategy can be envisioned surrounding the use of targeted chemotherapies in advanced stage NSCLC, where FDG-PET monitoring of response at all sites of involvement could distinguish effective versus futile treatments.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Therapeutics usually used for transarterial tumour therapy are usually small particles, chemotherapeutics and radionuclides. Transarterial tumour therapy is most often performed in primary and secondary liver tumours, and less often in other organs, like kidney, lung, prostate, uterus, etc.\n\nFor primary or secondary hepatic tumours either transarterial (bland) embolisation (TAE), transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) therapy or transarterial radioembolisation (RE) are the typical transarterial tumour therapies. A recent method that is still experimental is chemosaturation [1].\n\nTransarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment for intermediate stage (BCLC B) hepatocellular cancers (HCC). TACE utilises the fact that HCCs are perfused to 80 % by the liver artery and only to 20 % by the portal venous system. TACE uses the arterial perfusion of HCCs to introduce ischemia and chemotherapeutics into the tumour to kill tumour cells and to minimise systemic effects for the patient. TACE was developed in the early 1980s in Japan and traditionally was a mixture of lipiodol (ethyl ester of iodized fatty acids of poppy seed oil) and a chemotherapeutic agent (water-in-oil emulsion) [2]. This so called conventional or lipiodol TACE (cTACE) is usually completed by intraarterial application of gelatin sponge and this technique is established as the standard treatment for HCCs without portal vein invasion as a result of 2 randomised studies using doxorubicin [3] or cisplatium [4] as a chemotherapeutic agent. Both studies demonstrated a significant superiority of cTACE compared to best supportive care.\n\nIn the last 15 years 2 new TACE techniques were developed, TACE with drug-eluting microspheres (DEB-TACE) and TACE using degradable starch microspheres (DSM-TACE). In DEB-TACE the chemotherapeutic agent is released slowly from the embolising microparticles reducing the systemic side effects of TACE [5]. This technique showed a reduction of post-procedural abdominal pain, but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit compared to cTACE [6].\n\nTACE is also used to stabilize HCC tumors in patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation, so called “bridge to transplantation”, and as an adjunctive to thermal local ablative techniques (e.g. radio frequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA)). The addition of a TACE before thermal ablation reduces the perfusion induced “cooling” of the ablation zone and significantly increases local tumour control and survival when combined with thermal ablation in HCCs from 3.5 to 7 cm [7].\n\nIn recent years TACE spread to other secondary liver tumour, specially to liver metastasis from gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and from colorectal cancers (CRC) [8, 9]. In GEP-NET either a transarterial bland embolisation (TAE) without chemotherapeutic agent or a cTACE with doxorubicin is performed in specialised centers. For CRC liver metastasis DEB-TACE using irinotecan as loading drug is the established technique for TACE.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Vogl TJ, Zangos S, Scholtz JE, Schmitt F, Paetzold S, Trojan J, et al.

In many centres image-guided biopsy has essentially replaced surgical biopsy for the diagnosis of extracranial solid tumours in children.\n\nAttempts to introduce newer therapeutic techniques into paediatric practice have been hindered by practical, legislative and cultural obstacles [2]. Although a 2014 systematic review found reports of only 28 children treated with ablation techniques for malignant or aggressive benign lesions [3], many more relevant publications have appeared since then. For the present, at least, the most likely application of such techniques is in children with recurrent (or perhaps unresectable) tumors. Other indications may appear as paediatric oncologists become more familiar with the value of these procedures. One such possibility would be the use of radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation as an alternative to partial nephrectomy for treatment of bilateral nephroblastoma (Wilms’ tumour).\n\nTreatment of malignant liver tumours in children with chemoembolization (TACE) was investigated as long ago as the early 1990s, with promising results [4]. Three principal indications for TACE in children have been identified: conversion of unresectable tumours to resectability, as a bridge to transplantation, and as a part of palliation. Despite this, chemoembolization has not so far been incorporated into any major paediatric liver tumour trial.\n\nSome other IR procedures have an occasional role in the palliative care of children with cancer [5]. These include techniques for the management of malignant pleural effusions or ascites, and methods for delivering analgesic drugs or nerve blocks.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Fütterer\n\nDepartment of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, 6500HB, The Netherlands\n\nWith the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen screening and increasing life expectancy, more men are being diagnosed with localized, low-risk, low-grade prostate cancer [1]. As a result, men with localised prostate cancer and physicians who advise them face a difficult therapeutic dilemma: surveillance versus radical whole-gland therapy [2]. The available evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates that there is little to no difference between these choices in terms of overall and cancer-specific survival after a median of 10 years of follow-up [3]. Consequently, deferred treatment such as active surveillance is an appealing management solution which maximize the quality of life [4]. Conversely, radical treatment options, i.e. definitive radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy, come with considerable side effects such as erectile dysfunction and/or incontinence. Focal therapy is a strategy by which the overtreatment burden of the current prostate cancer pathway could be reduced [2]. This therapy concept has already been successfully applied to kidney [5], liver, breast, and lung cancer.\n\nFocal therapy is an emerging local treatment option, which offers great hopes in term of decreased morbidity associated with standard whole-gland therapy without jeopardising cancer control [6]. The challenge of focal therapy is to treat the tumour, sparing the rest of the prostate, especially near the neurovascular bundles, bladder neck, rectum and the urethral sphincter, to minimize the potential morbidity. Concern regarding focal therapy has centered on the knowledge that prostate cancer is multifocal in origin. In prostate cancer, a larger dominant lesion is often accompanied by two or three smaller low-grade lesions. A hypothesis has emerged that the largest lesion in the prostate — the index lesion — drives disease progression [7]. The index lesion tends to be associated with the highest Gleason grade, harbours other pathological determinants of progression, and has been associated with lymph node metastases on genetic profiling. If the index lesion could be isolated with reasonable precision and treatment directed to it alone, then the oncological efficacy of whole-gland treatment might be matched while minimizing the risk of side effects.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Towbin\n\nCincinnati Children’s Hospital, Department of Radiology, 3333 Burnet Avenue, MLC 5031, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA\n\nOver the past five decades, researchers have begun to unravel many of the molecular pathways that lead to development of cancer. Through this work we have learned that 90 % of cancers occur as a result of an acquired somatic mutation while the remaining 10 % of cancers occur as a result of a hereditary, germline mutation [1]. Patients with a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome often present younger in life than those patients with a somatic mutation [1].\n\nTo date, there are at least 114 known cancer predisposition syndromes [2]. The purpose of this talk is to describe several of the more common cancer predisposition syndromes including Li-Fraumeni syndrome, DICER 1 syndrome, Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Down syndrome [3-7]. For each syndrome, the common tumours will be described and the current guidelines for screening will be discussed.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Saletta F, Dalla Pozza L, Byrne JA.

Correct diagnosis of chest or chest wall masses is often challenging. Differentiation between malignant and benign processes including congenital abnormalities is of essential importance. Overall, primary pediatric pulmonary malignancies are uncommon. However, mediastinal masses and chest wall masses are not uncommon and should prompt thorough investigation.\n\nIn this interactive session we will use a case based approach to discuss various common and rare pediatric chest neoplasms as well as non-neoplastic differential diagnoses. In particular we will discuss the value of correlating the most likely primary site or epicenter of the lesion with the imaging characteristics as seen on radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging as well as the age and gender of the child in narrowing down the differential diagnosis.\n\nO13 Abdominal masses: good or bad?\n\nAnne MJB Smets (a.m.smets@amc.uva.nl)\n\nDepartment of Radiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n\nImaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of an abdominal mass in a child. Imaging studies need to be performed and interpreted in the light of the age of the child, clinical presentation and history, physical examination and laboratory results.\n\nUltrasound is a valuable technique for examining the pediatric abdomen and should always be the first imaging test to be performed. Both CT and MRI are modalities with a high burden for the child. The dose of ionizing radiation that comes with an abdominal CT is considerable. For abdominal MR, young children will need to be sedated or anaesthetized.\n\nAbdominal malignancies in children are rare, with an incidence of 1-9 per million children per year. The most frequent malignant abdominal tumours of childhood are neuroblastoma, originating from the adrenal gland or anywhere from the sympathetic nervous system, nephroblastoma (Wilms’ tumour) from the kidney, hepatoblastoma from the liver [1-3]. Benign lesions of hemorrhagic, inflammatory or infectious origin as well as congenital malformations may mimic a malignancy and a malignant tumour may be mistaken for a benign lesion [4].\n\nIn some cases ultrasound imaging will demonstrate the benign nature of a mass, and exposure of the child to imaging modalities with a high burden will hence be unnecessary. Whenever ultrasound findings are inconclusive or suggestive of a malignancy, complementary cross-sectional imaging studies are necessary. CT or MRI should then be carried out with the highest possible yield of diagnostic information and with the ALARA principle in mind [5].\n\nIn order to avoid pitfalls, it is important to be aware of the complementarity of the different imaging modalities and to include all information in the conclusion of the report.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

HCC is the endpoint of a serial transformation beginning from a dysplastic nodule, often triggered by chronic liver inflammation and cirrhosis. The progression from dysplastic nodule to HCC implies not only morphological changes but also vascular transformations, with process of neoangiogenesis leading to an increased number of unpaired arteries, progressive reduction of hepatocellular function [1].\n\nDynamic T1w during the arterial phase is of outmost importance for the detection of small HCCs [2]. Typically, HCCs demonstrate arterial enhancement and venous washout showing later hypointensity. However, HCCs smaller than 2 cm and well-differentiated HCCs frequently have atypical enhancement patterns [3]. In these situations, the use of liver-specific contrast agents (Gd-BOPTA or Gd-EOB-DTPA) can be helpful. While dynamic imaging of HCC with liver-specific MR contrast agents is similar to what observed with conventional CA, delayed hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging reveals a number of different enhancement patterns, with both iso-, hypo- and hyperintense patterns possible.\n\nThe signal intensity of HCCs on the HBP images has been recently considered as a potential imaging biomarker [4]. HBP hyper-intense HCCs have been reported to have histologic features related with favorable outcomes more frequently than HBP hypointense HCCs, showing higher grades of tumor differentiation, a lower rate of microvascular invasion [4], lower levels of expression of several kinds of poorer prognostic immunohistochemical markers [5].\n\nThe hepatobiliary phase images can increase the value of Gd-enhanced MRI in the diagnosis of early stage HCC. The use of liver specific contrast agents increase the sensitivity and accuracy for small HCCs either with Gd-EOB-DTPA [6] and with Gd-BOPTA [7].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Recent developments of US including ultrasound elastography (USE) and multimodality fusion imaging may play an important role for management of patients with chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis [1, 2]. Prognosis of patients with chronic liver disease is determined by the extent and progression of liver fibrosis, which may ultimately lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [3]. Although liver biopsy (LB) is regarded as the gold standard to estimate the extent of liver fibrosis, it has several limitations, the foremost being its invasiveness and sampling bias due to its limited sampling volume. Among the several non-invasive methods for assessing liver fibrosis recently developed, MR elastography and USE techniques including transient elastography (TE), point or two-dimensional shearwave elastography (SWE) provide an accurate representation of the extent of liver fibrosis [2, 4]. Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of USE for assessing the risk of HCC development and HCC recurrence after curative treatment, and developed novel models to calculate the risk of HCC development based on stiffness values. In addition, with the technical development of ultrasonography (US), electromagnetic tracking-based fusion imaging of real-time US and computed tomography/magnetic resonance (CT/MR) images has been used for percutaneous hepatic intervention such as biopsy and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) [5]. Real-time multimodality fusion imaging can enhance lesion detectability and reduce the false positive detection of focal hepatic lesions with poor sonographic conspicuity, and may improve efficacy of the percutaneous RFA of liver tumors using an overlapping ablation technique or multi-electrode technique [1]. Volumetric and fusion imaging should improve the therapeutic management of malignant liver lesions and particularly percutaneous guidance of thermo-ablation procedures.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Lee MW.

However, various recent hardware solutions have been developed by different vendors which permit simultaneous or near simultaneous PET and MR acquisition. However, the clinical translation of this modality for oncologic imaging requires not only identifying the appropriate clinical indications, but also understanding various components involved in establishing a PET/MR service which include physical installation of the system, equipment safety, clinical workflow, technician and physician training, and monetary reimbursement.\n\nThe current and potential clinical indications for imaging of metastatic disease can be broadly classified as follows:\n\n(1).\n\nSimultaneous local and distant staging of cancers such as rectal cancer and gynecologic malignancies. Here high spatial resolution of MRI provides information about local extent of the disease and PET is used predominantly for distant staging.\n\n(2).\n\nProblem solving for potential metastatic disease such as for small liver lesions, small lymph nodes, or bone marrow involvement. Additional information provided by MRI and PET can better characterize lesions and improve confidence in diagnosing presence or absence of metastatic disease.\n\n(3).\n\nAssessment of treatment response. Use of quantitative MR and PET information can potentially provide synergistic information in assessing treatment response.\n\nTo address these clinical need there are number of operational considerations such as:\n\n(1).\n\nProtocol optimisation.\n\n(2).\n\nWorkflow in scanning and interpretation of studies.\n\nSome of the technical challenges and limitations that need to be considered include:\n\n(1).\n\nLimitation of MRI for lung lesion detection.\n\n(2).\n\nAttenuation correction.\n\n(3).\n\nRegistration of free-breathing PET and breath-hold thoacoabdominal MR data.\n\nWhile FDG PET/CT remains the workhorse for diagnosis and management of oncologic diseases, early experience shows that PET/MR may have a complementary role. PET/MR could potentially play a significant role in diagnosis and management algorithms of several malignancies.\n\nO17 Diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and follow-up of lymphoma\n\nMarius E. Mayerhoefer1, Markus Raderer2, Alexander Haug1\n\n1Dept. of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, 1090, Austria; 2Dept. of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, 1090, Austria\n\nCorrespondence: Marius E. Mayerhoefer (marius.mayerhoefer@meduniwien.ac.at) – Dept. of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, 1090, Austria\n\nIntegrated PET/MR (positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) devices have only been recently introduced into routine clinical practice. Compared to PET/CT (computed tomography), the most widely utilised hybrid imaging technique at present, for which the total scan duration is only about 20-25 min, the scan duration is rather long for PET/MR, with 45-60 min for a whole-body examination. Therefore, a justification for the use of PET/MR, which is more cost intensive while providing a lower patient throughput, is required.\n\nFor malignant lymphoma, a heterogeneous family of cancers for which PET/MR has already been evaluated, the most obvious advantage, compared to PET/CT, is the low radiation exposure (about 6-8 mSv, compared to at least 20 mSv for a fully diagnostic, contrast-enhanced PET/CT examination). This topic is of relevance because lymphoma is one of the more common malignancies among children and adolescents, for whom life-long monitoring may be required, and for whom the risk of development of secondary, radiation-induced neoplasms must therefore be minimised.\n\nA less frequently recognised advantage of PET/MR is the fact that DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) can be incorporated in the examination. In lymphoma, DWI – even as a stand-alone whole-body technique – has shown to be only moderately inferior to [18F]-FDG-PET/CT – both in terms of pre-therapeutic staging and post-therapeutic restaging/treatment response assessment [1, 2]. Similar to the quantification of glucose metabolism on [18F]-FDG-PET, DWI offers the ability to quantify diffusion restriction by means of apparent diffusion coefficients, and thus, indirectly quantify cell density. Notably, DWI has also performed particularly well in some of the lymphoma subtypes for which [18F]-FDG-PET is currently not recommended by the ICML (International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma), which includes marginal zone lymphomas, SLL/CLL (small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia), Morbus Waldenström, and mycosis fungoides [3]. It is thus not surprising that the current literature suggests not just a non-inferiority of [18F]-FDG-PET/MR, compared to [18F]-FDG-PET/CT, but a moderate superiority, at least when the entire spectrum of lymphomas is taken into account [4].\n\nAnother advantage of PET/MR lies in the fact that dynamic or multiple time-point PET can be easily integrated into the work-flow. Delayed time-point [18F]-FDG-PET, for instance, has been shown to improve the detection of slowly-growing, indolent lymphomas with no, or low, FDG uptake, such as MALT lymphoma [5], the third most-common type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nWith regard to MALT lymphoma, SLL/CLL, and possibly, several other lymphoma subtypes for which [18F]-FDG is of limited value, novel PET tracers might be used in the context of PET/MR. This includes [68Ga]-Pentixafor, a radiotracer that specifically attaches to CXCR4 chemokine receptors [6]. CXCR4 receptors are overexpressed on the cell surfaces of different tumours, including those derived from the lympho-proliferative system, and regulate, among other things, cell migration. In an ongoing study presently performed at our institution, [68Ga]-Pentixafor has, so far, shown a very high sensitivity for detection of MALT lymphomas.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Positron emission tomography (PET) has became increasingly important in the work-up of prostate cancer. In the past, the use was mainly limited to radiolabbeled Choline-derivates which showed considerable limitations and did not always meet the diagnostic needs.\n\nRecently, a 68Gallium-labelled ligand of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA) has been introduced in PET-imaging of PCa with first promising results. Due to relatively exclusive expression of PSMA in prostatic tissue as well as increased expression in PCa 68Ga-PSMA was reported to exhibit a favourable lesion to background ratio compared to presently used choline- or fluorodesoxyglucose-based PET examinations. Together with the novel development of combined PET/MR, the combination of excellent morphological detail, multiparametric functional information and molecular PET data might lead to a significant improvement in detection and staging of PCa and thus may help to optimise oncological treatment.

So response evaluation criteria, like WHO, RECIST or Lugano criteria, used for evaluation of response to chemotherapy rely on tumour shrinkage as a sign of efficacy [1-4]. Additionally in these criteria the appearance of new lesions or progressing non-target lesions is indicating progress of disease independent of the changes in the target lesions.\n\nIpilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA 4), was the first immunotherapeutic agent that showed in clinical phase II trials survival benefits and successful tumour therapy in patients with advanced malignant melanoma [5]. In the study treating malignant melanoma it was shown that superficial and organ metastasis in some patients even increase in size or new lesions appear, whereas these patients later show very good response and survival benefit in the following course of the study. Following traditional response criteria these patients would have been assessed as progressive disease (PD) and excluded from the study (or dropped out from the progression free survival (PFS) group). This increase of size and appearance of the lesions is thought to be a result of lymphocyte and macrophage invasion into the tumour and is called “pseudoprogression”.\n\nUsing the results from the mentioned study new criteria, immune-related response criteria (irRC), were defined by Wolchok et al. [5]. These criteria base on bi-dimensional target lesion measurements analogue to WHO criteria. In contrast to other criteria new tumour lesions not directly trigger progressive disease (PD). The bi-dimentional measurements of new appearing lesions will be included into the sum of product tumour diameters (SPD) of the defined target lesions at baseline. Additionally every progressive disease (PD) must be confirmed by a repeated imaging with minimum 4 weeks interval. Both new rules should reduce the pseudoprogression in the tumour response assessment in immunotherapy.\n\nIn the last years these new rules have been integrated into the mono-dimensional RECIST criteria to evaluate immunotherapy. For these new mono-dimensional criteria no commonly accepted term exists. This modification is called immune-related RECIST (irRECIST), immune-modified RECIST, modified RECIST (mRECIST) or irRC 2014. Personally I prefer the term immune-related RECIST (irRECIST), because it best reflects the immunotherapeutic modification of the established RECIST system.\n\nIn the last years many new immunotherapeutic agents have been investigated in clinical studies, like pembrolizumab, nivolumab (anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) antibodies), atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death-ligand 1)), ipilimumab (anti-CTLA 4), alemtuzumab (anti CD52), ofatumumab and rituximab (anti-CD20).\n\nCurrent studies are investigating these checkpoint inhibitors of the immune system in colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma, breast cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma and leukaemia.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This applies to daily practice as well as to patients taking part in clinical trials. The main difference between these two settings is that the recording of response in the trial setting needs to be done in a highly uniform and rigorous manner that is standardised and reproducible.\n\nThe detection of response, whether for clinical trial reporting or for daily practice, requires a few important pieces of information:\n\n1.\n\nWe need to know the date of baseline scan immediately prior to a new treatment being started.\n\n2.\n\nWe need to know what disease was present at the time of the baseline scan. In the case of clinical trial reporting, we need to know which target lesions were selected at baseline.\n\n3.\n\nWe need to know if there were any important events that could alter the scan appearances (for example drainage of ascitic fluid or interval surgical resection during the course of treatment).\n\n4.\n\nWe need to be aware of the findings on each scan from baseline to the time of the scan that is currently being reported, in order to be certain that the nadir (the smallest recorded diameter of target lesions) is correctly identified.\n\nFor the purposes of clinical trial reporting, it is essential to know which reporting criteria are being used for the trial. Most trials use RECIST 1.1; this updated version addresses some of the issues with the first RECIST, such as defining the measurement of lymph nodes. However, some trials do still use the original RECIST, usually in diseases that have a predominance of metastases in one organ, such as the liver in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours. In this case, being restricted to only two lesions in one organ becomes restrictive and potentially not representative of changes that may be occurring.\n\nThe initial selection of target lesions at baseline lays the foundation for the future reports. Clear guidance on the selection of lesions should be adhered to. The target selection rules will be reviewed in the course of the workshop. Clear recording of the selected target lesions and the recording of the sum of target lesions will help in future reports.\n\nA very helpful aspect of the RECIST 1.1 paper is the section on “Frequently asked questions”. Several of these more challenging aspects of trial reporting will be reviewed, together with examples.\n\nO21 Challenges of RECIST in oncology imaging basics for the trainee and novice\n\nAslam Sohaib\n\nThe Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Sutton, London, UK\n\nResponse Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumours (RECIST) guidelines were introduced in 2000 and updated in 2009 to provide a standardised method for assessing response to treatments [1,2]. Tumour burden is measured using sum of the diameters with uni-dimensional measurements. The response categories are those of complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. Though the RECIST criteria are intended for use in the clinical trial setting, onocologist increasingly rely on RECIST based measurements to make clinical management and therapeutic decisions in daily clinical practice.\n\nRECIST guidelines are therefore widely employed, however, they have well recognised limitations and pitfalls. Tumours that are irregular, or show diffuse infiltration or poorly visualised eg with fatty liver, can all be difficult to measure in a reliable and reproducible way. Tumour with non-spherical growth pattern can be difficult to serially follow up and assess response. The categories for the response criteria are arbitrarily defined and may not correlate with clinical outcome. Morphological characteristics and tumour heterogeneity are not taken into consideration. Functional or physiological change with response is not assessed / measured in RECIST. Reliance of response is based exclusively on tumour size and clinical beneficial chemotherapeutic effects may occur without reduction in tumour size eg many new targeted therapies have anti-angiogenic effects and result in symptomatic improvement in patients. Similar immue mediated response may artificially result in short term increase in tumour size or small new lesions. Treatment effects such as necrosis, cystic change and haemorrhage can result in artificial change in tumour size. Mixed and differential response is simplified in the response assessment in RECIST. Bone disease without significant soft tissue and cystic tumour it can be difficult to assess change with the tumour.\n\nThe limitations in RECIST guidelines have led to the publications and developments in modified RECIST and other response criteria to overcome these shortfalls.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The scale originated from a scoring system developed at St Thomas’ Hospital and was at that time named the SELCN (South East London Cancer Network) Score. Following initial work confirming high concordance of the reporting criteria between reporters, particularly with respect to use in clinical trials [1], the scoring system was adopted as the preferred method for reporting of response assessment in lymphoma at the First International Workshop on PET in Lymphoma in Deauville, France, in 2009 [2]. Its use has subsequently been validated in Hodgkin, diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphomas [3,4,7].\n\nSince then the DS has been increasingly used in clinical practice and in national and international trials as a simple, quick and reproducible method to assess response to treatment in lymphoma, with good interobserver agreement reported in several studies [5, 6, 7]. It has also been shown to have predictive and prognostic significance.\n\nHow to use the Deauville Score: To use the DS, the reader makes an initial visual assessment to identify the residual area(s) of focal uptake at original sites of disease, in comparison to a pretreatment baseline scan and measures the maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) of these areas. The reader then draws two background regions of interest. The first is drawn within the aortic arch (taking care to exclude vessel walls and associated calcification) and represents mediastinal blood pool. A second region is drawn in a large region of normal liver to determine the normal liver SUVmax.\n\nThe five-point scale scores the most intense uptake in a site of initial disease as:\n\n1.\n\nno uptake.\n\n2.\n\nuptake ≤ mediastinal blood pool.\n\n3.\n\nuptake > mediastinal blood pool but ≤ liver.\n\n4.\n\nuptake moderately higher than liver*.\n\n5.\n\nuptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions**.\n\nX new areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma.\n\n*moderately is uptake up to 3 times greater than the SUVmax in a large region of normal liver.\n\n**markedly is uptake greater than 3 times the SUVmax in a large region of normal liver.\n\nWhen to use the Deauville Score: Recently published guidance recommends that the DS is used for reporting response assessment both at interim and end of treatment [8]. Whilst the majority of lymphomas are FDG-avid, published experience is predominantly with Hodgkin, diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphomas. Furthermore, in specific circumstances, there is now evidence that interim PET assessed using the DS can be used to guide response adapted therapy [9, 10].\n\nReporting template: The presentation will also introduce the idea of a reporting template for response assessment in lymphoma incorporating the ideas discussed in the talk.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI am grateful to all my colleagues at PET Imaging Centre at St Thomas’, in particular Professor Sally Barrington for her invaluable guidance and expertise.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

New York, NY, USA\n\nThere is no doubt that imaging is a central tool in contemporary cancer care. From staging to assessing treatment response and follow-up, it would be difficult to imagine a patient with cancer in 2016 who has not undergone some form of imaging as part of their disease evaluation. This paradigm has solidified the place of oncologic imaging as a sub-specialty, but it has also lead to challenges related to augmenting the knowledge of those practicing it in areas that are not classically considered mainstream radiology. These continuously evolving topics are definitely relevant to oncologic imaging, such as molecular biology, genomics, proteomic and immunotherapy, just to name a few. All these have direct or indirect implications on the imaging findings or their interpretation, and as such should be part of the opportunities for lifelong learning. In this session, we will discuss resources for increasing radiologists’ knowledge of these topics.\n\nO24 ICIS e-portal and the online learning community\n\nDow-Mu Koh\n\nRoyal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 5PT, UK\n\nLife long learning in medicine is a process of continuously scrutinising our practice, recognising gaps in our understanding and actively acquiring new knowledge to ensure that we are practicing medicine to the highest professional standards. Life long learning is self-directed, personal, active, participatory and reflective. However, the busy working life and competing demands for our time may make it difficult to realise these aims. The key barriers to success include difficulty with personal reflection, environment strain, competing demands, difficulty with goal generation, and problems with plan generation and implementation. In addition, lack of access to high-quality learning materials may also impede progress.\n\nE-learning is increasingly recognised as an effective way to deliver learning material for continuous medical education. As Oncologic Imaging is an emerging sub-speciality discipline, there are few sites dedicated to cancer imaging. The ICIS e-portal aims to address this gap by providing high-quality carefully curated learning material to the Society Membership. This will include dedicated online cancer imaging course, cases crowd-sourced from the ICIS Online Learning Community and development of the ICIS Ring of Excellence case archives.\n\nO25 Benign lesions that mimic pancreatic cancer\n\nJay P Heiken (heikenj@mir.wustl.edu)\n\nMallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA\n\nChronic inflammatory processes involving the pancreas, normal anatomic variants and some benign neoplasms can mimic pancreatic malignancy. Some of these processes are discussed below.\n\nIntrapancreatic splenule appears as a round enhancing mass within the tail of the pancreas. Because of its vascularity it can be mistaken for a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. One of the keys to diagnosis is recognition that the mass has enhancement, attenuation and/or signal intensity characteristics that parallel the spleen on all image acquisitions. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a technetium 99 m heat-damaged red blood cell scan, which demonstrates radiotracer uptake within the mass.\n\nMass-forming chronic pancreatitis, particularly autoimmune pancreatitis, frequently is misdiagnosed as pancreatic adenocarcinoma or a neuroendocrine tumour. Most commonly mass-forming chronic pancreatitis is isoattenuating/isointense during both the pancreatic and hepatic parenchymal phases of contrast enhancement. In contradistinction, pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically is hypoattenuating/hypointense during both enhancement phases; however, approximately 10 % of pancreatic adenocarcinomas are isoattenuating/isointense during both phases. On MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) the pancreatic duct within the mass-forming pancreatitis may be visible but narrowed (duct-penetrating sign), whereas the duct within pancreatic carcinoma often is occluded. One study has shown the duct-penetrating sign to be 94 % accurate in distinguishing the two entities. Elevation of serum IgG4 is the best serological marker for autoimmune pancreatitis (sensitivity 73-75 %; specificity 93-95 %); however, approximately 10 % of patients with pancreatic cancer may have elevated IgG4.\n\nPancreatic serous cystadenoma is a benign mass that consists of numerous tiny cysts separated by glandular tissue and fibrous stroma. On CT it appears as a well-circumscribed hypoattenuating mass with varying degrees of contrast enhancement, depending on the size of the cysts and the proportion of cystic to glandular tissue. In most cases it is not difficult to distinguish this multicystic lesion from a solid pancreatic neoplasm; however a small proportion of serous cystadenomas consist largely of glandular tissue and fibrous septa with only a small proportion of tiny cysts. Such lesions appear hypervascular and may mimic a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Clues to the diagnosis include precontrast attenuation value within the range of fluid and the presence of small cystic areas with the enhancing mass. Heavily T2 weighted images may help demonstrate the microcystic nature of the mass in some cases. In addition, this diagnosis should be considered if the mass is found incidentally in an elderly individual or a patient with von Hippel Lindau disease.\n\nFocal fatty replacement of the pancreas occasionally can mimic a pancreatic tumor, appearing as a focal hypoattenuating area on CT. The most common location is the anterior portion of the pancreatic head. Clues to the correct diagnosis include triangular shape and absence of mass effect or ductal obstruction. The presence of fat can be confirmed by demonstrating reduction in signal intensity on the opposed phase of chemical shift MR imaging.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Only a minority (15-20 %) of patients with pancreatic carcinoma is resectable at the time of presentation and patients with a curative resection with margin negative resections have a better prognosis than those with residual macroscopic disease after resection. So it is crucial to separate these tumors into those who are resectable, borderline resectable and unresectable and metastatic groups. The commonly used staging systems in the United States are those put forward by the American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]. The AJCC system is based on the TNM system, with the T based on location and size and local extent, N, nodal and M, distant metastasis. Vascular contact/abutment is described as + or < or > 1800. However there are a few pertinent findings that are not included in these staging systems which are essential for surgical planning and determining resectability status. These include the presence of venous thrombus, tumour contact with common hepatic artery to the origins of the right and left hepatic arteries, tumour contact with first SMA branch and most proximal draining vein into the SMV, as well the presence of arterial variants.\n\nDespite the preference of standardized structured or template reporting over conventional reporting by referring clinicians, its adoption into daily clinical practice has been slow in coming. The most commonly used type of conventional or free style reporting, tends to either “bury” the pertinent information needed for patient management in lengthy reports which include irrelevant incidental findings or fail to mention aspects of the findings that are crucial the treatment and management of the current condition for which the patient was imaged. Structured or template reports on the other hand can provide relevant information that is essential for patient management and this is especially true for patients with pancreatic carcinoma, given the variability in expertise and definition of disease extent amongst different readers.\n\nIn an effort to move the concept of structured reporting, a consensus statement was issued in 2014 by both the Society of Abdominal Radiology and the American Pancreatic Association, regarding a reporting template for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This has been jointly published simultaneously in two major journals: the American Journal of Gastroenterology and Radiology.\n\nSome initial studies have shown the value of standardized structured reporting in tumour staging and surgical planning, both to our referring clinicians as well as radiologists and radiology trainees. Brook and colleagues compared the results of structured versus nonstructured reporting of findings of MDCT (multidetector computed tomography) for the staging and subjective assessment of resectability for pancreatic cancer and showed that surgeons were confident regarding decisions regarding tumor resectability when structured reports were available than with nonstructured reports. We and others have now started to work on developing a similar working reporting template with the Society of Abdominal Radiology through disease-focussed panels (DFP’S) s for cystic pancreatic lesions.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.\n\nKee D, Zalcberg JR.

There are significant differences in frequencies of malignancy in IPMNs according to the morphological types, higher for MD-type (mean 61.6 %) and lower for BD-type (25.5 %) [3].\n\nA clear differentiation between IPMN lesions with different pathologic expression can be difficult, unless clear evidence of malignancy is present. However, some imaging findings can be suggestive of aggressive behavior of the IPMN [3].\n\nHigh risk stigmata suggest the high possibility that the lesion is malignant, thus requiring surgical resection if Patient is fit: main duct diameter > 10 mm for MD-IPMN, the presence of solid enhancing nodules within the cyst in BD-IPMN, or obstructive jaundice in presence of a cystic lesion of the pancreatic head. Worrisome features suggest the possibility that the lesion could evolve in malignant, thus requiring further workup by EUS, to better risk-stratify the lesion, and a strict follow-up: cyst > 3 cm, thickened enhanced cyst walls, MPD size of 5-9 mm, non-enhancing mural nodules, abrupt change in the MPD caliber with distal pancreatic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy.\n\nThe management of IPMN is mainly based on the location (MD- and mixed type-IPMN versus BD-IPMN), the size of the largest cyst in BD-IPMN, the presence of “high risk stigmata” (main duct diameter > 10 mm for MD-IPMN, the presence of solid enhancing nodules within the cyst in BD-IPMN, or obstructive jaundice in presence of a cystic lesion of the pancreatic head) or “worrisome features” (cyst of > 3 cm, thickened enhanced cyst walls, MPD size of 5-9 mm, non-enhancing mural nodules, abrupt change in the MPD caliber with distal pancreatic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy). Moreover, risk stratification for age and fit for surgery must be considered.\n\nPatients with BD-IPMN and cysts of >3 cm and no “worrisome features” can also be considered for EUS to verify the absence of thickened walls or mural nodules, particularly if the patient is elderly, while if patient is young and fit for surgery, surgery should be strongly considered. Patients with BD-IPMN and cysts of <3 cm and no “worrisome features” should be considered for observation according to size stratification [3].\n\nMD-IPMN with MPD dilation of 5-9 mm can also be considered as a worrisome feature, with a recommendation of evaluation, but no immediate resection [3].\n\nImaging plays a pivotal role in the management of patients with IPMNs, with the different imaging techinques offering specific imaging features. However, MRI with MRCP is the leading imaging technique, either in the initial assessment and in the follow-up [4-7].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Scuro 10, 37134, University of Verona, Verona, Italy\n\nPancreatic neoplasms are a wide group of solid and cystic lesions with different and sometimes characteristic imaging features, clinical presentations and management.\n\nCystic pancreatic neoplasms comprise serous neoplasms, which are almost always benign, mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, which can vary from benign to frankly malignant lesions, and solid pseudopapillary tumours.\n\nSerous cystadenoma (SCA) is a cystic tumour with a typical multilocular “honeycomb” architecture due to the presence of multiple microcysts (<20 mm), thin walls and multiple septa oriented toward a central scar. The typical lobulated, “cloud-like” morphology is usually clearly depictable at imaging. The cystic content is anechoic at US, hypodense at CT and hypointense on T1-weighted images at MR; T2-weighted images clearly demonstrates the microcystic pattern.\n\nAfter intravenous administration of contrast material, the hypervascularization of the central scar and of internal thin septa may be seen.\n\nSCA does not communicate with the pancreatic ductal system and this can be well demonstrated at MRCP: this finding remains crucial for the differential diagnosis in respect to branch duct IPMNs.\n\nSCA uncommon presentations are: macrocystic and unilocular; pseudosolid; huge dimensions.\n\nMucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) are pancreatic cystic tumors with different degress of malignancy.
