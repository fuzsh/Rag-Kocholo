        "text": "The climate of Russia\n\nRussia is the largest country in the world; therefore it has several different climate zones. There is no other country that has as many differences in temperature as this immense country that stretches out over two continents: Asia and Europe. During the winter temperatures may plummet to -50 degrees Celsius; during the summer temperatures may reach 40-50 degrees Celsius. A difference of (almost) 100 degrees Celsius, a phenomenon that occurs only on a few places in the world.\n\nClimate types\n\nDespite its enormous size Russia only has a few climate types according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. The largest part of the country has a cold continental climate or a moderate continental climate, types Dfb and Dfc. Parts of Siberia have a cold continental climate with dry winters (type Dwc) or a cold (subarctic) continental climate with dry winters. In the south-westerly tip of the country steppe climates and sea climates occur. The north-easterly tip of the country has a high mountain climate. The northern strip of Russia has a Tundra climate (type ET) with a transition zone where it becomes an ice climate (type EH)\n\nClimate information of places and areas in Russia\n\nThe climate information given on this page is only brief. Specific information on weather and climate can be found on the pages per region or city. The following climate information is available for Russia:\n\nIrkutsk\n\nKaliningrad\n\nKhabarovsk\n\nKrasnojarsk\n\nMoscow Murmansk\n\nNovosibirsk\n\nOmsk\n\nPerm\n\nPetropavlovsk-Kamchatsky Rostov-on-Don\n\nSaint Petersburg\n\nSamara\n\nSochi\n\nTyumen Vladivostok\n\nVolgograd\n\nYakutsk\n\nYekaterinburg\n\nDark Winters\n\nWinters in Russia are dark and cold. In the areas with a moderate climate light to medium frost can be expected during the night. During the day temperatures may rise above freezing point. The further you move away from the Black Sea and Europe the lower temperatures will be. During the coldest months of the year temperatures in the capital Moscow are -12 degrees Celsius during the night and -6 degrees Celsius during the day. However, these are averages. Bear in mind that temperatures may drop much lower than these averages. Temperatures of -20 degrees Celsius during the day are not uncommon in Moscow. In Siberia it even gets much colder. In Yakutsk temperatures are -37 degrees Celsius during the day and -45 degrees Celsius during the night. Only from April temperatures will rise above freezing point again to reach summer or even tropical temperatures during the summer. Winters in Russia are not only cold, they are dark as well. December, January and February only get one hour of sunshine per day on average. The northern tip of Russia doesnt even get one hour of sunshine per day. Here you have a really dark and cold period. Low precipitation figures during the winter are also a striking phenomenon. More than 90% of Russia only gets 30 millimeters of precipitation per month from December till February; almost all of which falls in the form of snow. However, low temperatures are responsible for quite a thick layer of snow in most places in Russia.\n\nWarm summers\n\nThe largest part of Russia doesnt get the cooling effect of the sea, so temperatures may rise. After a long winter spring is only short (April-May). After this temperatures start to rise to summer values. In June temperatures are above 20 degrees Celsius in most places. Exceptions are the areas above the polar circle and the mountainous areas in the eastern part of Russia. In July and August temperatures rise even higher. The European part of Russia is reasonably moderate with maximum temperatures of 22-23 degrees Celsius. The further you move east the higher temperatures get. The places that are coldest during the winter record tropical temperatures during the summer. Summers are also wetter than winters. Despite the high temperatures Siberia has a large surface area where only the upper layer of the soil thaws. The deeper parts have permafrost. Scientists predict that the permafrost will also thaw in the future due to global warming, with dire consequences for the environment and the climate. The part of Russia below the Arctic Circle gets 40-80 millimeters of rain per month during summer. Thunderstorms are uncommon in Russia. Russia gets about 10-20 thunderstorm days.\n\nWind\n\nHurricanes and heavy storms are uncommon in Russia. This is because the land is situated in the north. There are no strong wind currents flowing across Russia so heavy winds are uncommon. However, fierce winds may blow along the north-westerly coasts and in the areas surrounding the Black Sea. Cold gusts of wind may cause relatively strong winds here during the winter.\n\nClimate figures\n\nThe figures below are for the city of Moscow. These climate figures cannot be seen as an average for Russia. Because the climate of Russia is so diverse please go to the individual pages for climate information on other places and regions in Russia and use them as a reference.\n\naverage\n\nmaximum\n\ntemperature (°C)\n\naverage\n\nminimum\n\ntemperature (°C) average\n\nhours of sunshine\n\nper day average days with precipitation\n\nper month average\n\nmm precipitation\n\nper month average\n\nsea\n\ntemperature (°C) January -6 -13 1 13 n/a February -5 -12 3 11 n/a March 1 -6 4 10 n/a April 10 2 6 12 n/a May 19 8 9 13 n/a June 22 12 9 14 n/a July 23 13 9 15 n/a August 22 12 8 13 n/a September 16 7 5 14 n/a October 8 2 3 15 n/a November 1 -3 1 12 n/a December -4 -9 1 12 n/a = 0-5 mm ● = 6-30 mm ● = 31-60 mm ● = 61-100 mm ● = 101-200 mm ● = over 200 mm\n\n= 0-0.2 inches ● = 0.2-1.2 inches ● = 1.2-2.4 inches ● = 2.5-4 inches ● = 4.1-8 inches ● = over 8 inches\n\nMore climate information\n\nClimate tables are useful but they dont give an overall picture of the climate and possible weather conditions during a period of time. How high the chances are of hot or cold weather or hurricanes can often not be found in these tables. This is why we offer extra climate information per month. The information below is an average for Moscow centrally situated in the western part of Russia.\n\nPlease visit the individual pages for climate information on other places and regions in Russia and use them as a reference.\n\nchance of\n\n(very) hotweather\n\nchance of\n\n(very) cool\n\nweather chance of\n\nlong-termprecipitation chance of\n\nhurricanes\n\n(cyclones) chance of\n\nsunny days\n\nUV-index\n\nJanuary February March April May June July August September October November December click here for the explanation of the symbols"
