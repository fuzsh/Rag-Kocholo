        "text": "Over the past 50 years, the Bryan-College Station area’s average summer temperature has increased by over 4 degrees Fahrenheit, bringing along dangerous, record-breaking heat that is projected to continue, according to experts.\n\nFrom 1970 to 2023, the average summer temperature in Bryan-College Station has increased by 4.3 degrees during the day and 3.8 degrees during the night, according to the 2024 summer package released by Climate Central, a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit. The Bryan-College Station area is already more vulnerable to heat-related impacts, according to data from the Center for Disease, Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Heat and Health Index.\n\nThe CDC’s Heat and Health index breaks down heat vulnerability by ZIP code across the entire U.S. According to this data, the 77840 ZIP code area of College Station is in the top 87% nationwide for vulnerability to heat-related impacts. The same region is also in the top 90% of areas in the country in terms of historical heat and health burden. Parts of Bryan — such as the 77803 ZIP code — fair even worse, being in the 99 percentile for heat vulnerability, according to the CDC data.\n\nThe Eagle reached out to the Brazos County Health District for data on local heat-related deaths in recent years but did not receive any numbers before publication.\n\nShel Winkley, who worked previously as a meteorologist in Bryan-College Station for 14 years, said five of the 10 hottest days ever recorded in the area were recorded after 2009.\n\n“I think the afternoon temperatures get the biggest attention because that’s what you feel and experience the most; 112 Fahrenheit was our hottest temperature ever recorded, and then last summer we did that two or three times,” said Winkley, now a weather and climate engagement specialist for Climate Central. “The nighttime temperatures are [also] exceptionally warmer than they used to be. Nighttime warmth is a big fingerprint of climate change.”\n\nWarmer nighttime temperatures can be dangerous for the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, Winkley said, especially for those living near or under the poverty line.\n\n“A lot of us are lucky enough and well off enough to have air conditioning in our homes,” he said. “For those that don’t have adequate air conditioning, when you go through several nights like that, and the heat builds up in your house, that’s where those health risks come into effect. … Some of us, you can run an air conditioner all day, and get a higher bill and say, ‘Oh, that’s a bummer.’ There’s families who literally have to decide between feeding their family, keeping the AC running or paying their mortgage.”\n\nWith Texas being such a large state with a diversity of climates, Texas State Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said the effects of climate change can vary from region to region.\n\n“Global temperatures are increasing because we’re getting energy faster than we can lose it to space as a planet and that’s primarily because of greenhouse gases,” he said. “Temperatures are expected to go up faster over land than over water and Texas has been increasing and expecting to increase at a rate of about 25% to 30% faster than the global average temperature.”\n\nDespite being above the global average, Nielsen-Gammon, a Texas A&M University Regents Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, said Texas is actually experiencing slower warming than other parts of the U.S.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“We’re sort of at the low to medium end; temperatures tend to increase faster toward the pole,” he said. “We’re not rising quite as rapidly here as they are further inland, but of course we’re starting at a higher value than most other places.”\n\nRising temperatures are also partially responsible for unpredictable rainfall patterns, Nielsen-Gammon said.\n\n“Since a warmer atmosphere can hold more water, we’ve seen an increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall,” he said. “We’ve probably seen a decrease in soil moisture, but we don’t have long term observations of that, but it stands to reason with the higher temperatures and climate models are very consistent about that.”\n\nThe science behind the rising temperatures has been known for decades, and two Texas A&M University atmospheric scientists published a research article last year showing heat-related deaths in the U.S. could increase by a factor of five if these current warming trends continue.\n\nTexas A&M Atmospheric Science Professor Andrew Dessler, who co-authored the article with professor Langho Lee, said although places with relatively mild summers are expected to have a more difficult time adapting to rising temperatures, areas like Texas will still be impacted.\n\n“Our study was of the U.S. and it looked like [a five-fold increase] would happen around 3 degrees [Celsius] of warming, which is kind of where we’re heading for right now,” he said. “If you think about it in the U.S., we’ve spent an enormous amount of money adapting to high temperatures. Every house in College Station is air-conditioned and that’s very expensive … and we can afford to do that. A lot of places, they haven’t done that and therefore, when the temperature rises, they’re going to have a much harder time adapting.”\n\nEarlier this month, the World Meteorological Organization announced that the annual average global temperature will likely temporarily exceed the 1.5 C [2.7 F] warming target set by the Paris Climate Accord. Dessler said this is an issue people should be worrying about now.\n\n“This is not an end-of-the-century problem,” he said. “A lot of the time talking about mortality, and certainly deaths are terrible. … But even if that doesn’t happen to you, the high temperatures are still affecting you. You’re paying a lot more for electricity because you have to run your air conditioner more, and that could be hundreds of dollars a year. Climate change affects everything in your life. I always caution people not to just focus on the absolute worst-case scenarios because it’s always chipping away at our lives.”\n\nAt the current rate of heating, Dessler said the Earth is predicted to reach the deadly 3 degrees C (6 degrees F) increase by 2100, if nothing is done to combat the effects of climate change.\n\n“We need to stop emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and you do that by transitioning our energy system to renewable energy, and in Texas we’re doing that,” he said. “We just have to do it as fast as we possibly can and not let fossil fuels, fossil fuel interests, slow us down. It’s certainly realistic. … It’s really a political question. It’s not a scientific question. It’s not a technical question. It’s whether we are strong enough to overcome the fossil fuels industry.”\n\nFor the majority of his over three decades in climate research, Dessler said he always thought more people would believe in climate change as the results began affecting their lives in a more direct way. Now, however, he said there will always be people who are too ideologically stubborn to acknowledge humanity’s effect on the climate.\n\n“I always thought that at some point, people would look out the window, they would see what’s going on and say, ‘Wow, that is a problem, we should do anything about it,’” he said. “It’s quite clear that’s never going to happen. People’s ability to rationalize and deny what’s happening directly in front of their face is apparently limitless.”\n\nLocal Weather\n\nGet the daily forecast and severe weather alerts in your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nKyle McClenagan\n\nNews reporter — crime, courts and more\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
