        "text": "An investigation of characteristics parameters of Ag/p-Si Schottky diodes based on I-V-T and C-V-T measurements\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSelcuk, A.B.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe current-voltage (I-V) measurements on Ag/p-Si Schottky barrier diodes in the temperature range 125-300 K were carried out. The experimental values of n and Î¦ b 0 were determined from intercepts and slopes of the forward bias In I-V plot at each temperature. The Î¦ b 0 and n determined from semilog-forwaid I- V plots were found to be a strong function of temperature. The ideality factor n was found to increase, while the Î¦ b 0 decrease with decreasing temperature. The flat-band barrier height Î¦ b f and series resistance R s are also determined from the I-V measurements. Furthermore, the diffusion potential V D , experimental carrier doping density N A , Fermi level E F and barrier height Î¦ C V are determined from the C- V measurements. It is shown that the values of R s estimated from Cheung's method were strongly temperature dependent decreased with increasing temperature\n\nTemperature dependence of frequency dispersion in IIIâV metal-oxide-semiconductor C-V and the capture/emission process of border traps\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nVais, Abhitosh, E-mail: Abhitosh.Vais@imec.be; Martens, Koen; DeMeyer, Kristin [Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven (Belgium); IMEC, Kapeldreef 75, B-3001 Leuven (Belgium); Lin, Han-Chung; Ivanov, Tsvetan; Collaert, Nadine; Thean, Aaron [IMEC, Kapeldreef 75, B-3001 Leuven (Belgium); Dou, Chunmeng [Frontier Research Center, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama 226-8502 (Japan); Xie, Qi; Maes, Jan [ASM International, B-3001 Leuven (Belgium); Tang, Fu; Givens, Michael [ASM International, Phoenix, Arizona 85034-7200 (United States); Raskin, Jean-Pierre [Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, UniversiteÃ© Catholique de Louvain, B-1348 Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium)\n\n2015-08-03\n\nThis paper presents a detailed investigation of the temperature dependence of frequency dispersion observed in capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements of III-V metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices. The dispersion in the accumulation region of the capacitance data is found to change from 4%â9% (per decade frequency) to â¼0% when the temperature is reduced from 300âK to 4âK in a wide range of MOS capacitors with different gate dielectrics and III-V substrates. We show that such significant temperature dependence of C-V frequency dispersion cannot be due to the temperature dependence of channel electrostatics, i.e., carrier density and surface potential. We also show that the temperature dependence of frequency dispersion, and hence, the capture/emission process of border traps can be modeled by a combination of tunneling and a âtemperature-activatedâ process described by a non-radiative multi-phonon model, instead of a widely believed single-step elastic tunneling process.\n\nTemperature dependent I-V characteristics of an Au/n-GaAs Schottky diode analyzed using Tungâs model\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKorucu, Demet; Turut, Abdulmecit; Efeoglu, Hasan\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of Au/n-GaAs contacts prepared with photolithography technique have been measured in the temperature range of 80-320 K. The ideality factor and barrier height (BH) values have remained almost unchanged between 1.04 and 1.10 and at a value of about 0.79 eV at temperatures above 200 K, respectively. Therefore, the ideality factor values near unity say that the experimental I-V data are almost independent of the sample temperature, that is, contacts have shown excellent Schottky diode behavior above 200 K. An abnormal decrease in the experimental BH Î¦b and an increase in the ideality factor with a decrease in temperature have been observed below 200 K. This behavior has been attributed to the barrier inhomogeneity by assuming a Gaussian distribution of nanometer-sized patches with low BH at the metal-semiconductor interface. The barrier inhomogeneity assumption is also confirmed by the linear relationship between the BH and the ideality factor. According to Tungâs barrier inhomogeneity model, it has been seen that the value of ÏT=7.41Ã10-5 cm2/3 V1/3from ideality factor versus (kT)-1 curve is in close agreement with ÏT=7.95Ã10-5 cm2/3 V1/3 value from the Î¦eff versus (2kT)-1 curve in the range of 80-200 K. The modified Richardson ln(J0/T2)-(qÏT)2(Vb/Î·)2/3/[2(kT)2] versus (kT)-1 plot, from Tungâs Model, has given a Richardson constant value of 8.47 A cm-2 K-2which is in very close agreement with the known value of 8.16 A cm-2 K-2 for n-type GaAs; considering the effective patch area which is significantly lower than the entire geometric area of the Schottky contact, in temperature range of 80-200 K. Thus, it has been concluded that the use of Tungâs lateral inhomogeneity model is more appropriate to interpret the temperature-dependent I-V characteristics in the Schottky contacts.\n\nAngular-dependent I-V characteristics in borocarbide superconductor YNi2B2C\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChu, R M; Chen, Q Y; Chu, W K\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe present angular-dependent current-voltage (I-V) measurements in borocarbide YNi 2 B 2 C single crystals near the vortex-glass irreversible line. External magnetic fields are applied along the angle Î¸ with respect to the c-axis. The nonlinear I-V curves reveal scaling behaviour near the transition. Using the scaling analysis, the relevant critical exponents and vortex transition temperatures are determined for all orientations. The data agrees well with the vortex-glass (VG) model. No evidence was found that supports the existence of a Bose-glass (BG) type of transition\n\nKinetic study of time-dependent fixation of U\"V\"I on biochar\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAshry, A.; Bailey, E.H.; Chenery, S.R.N.; Young, S.D.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBiochar, a by-product from the production of biofuel and syngas by gasification, was tested as a material for adsorption and fixation of U\"V\"I from aqueous solutions. A batch experiment was conducted to study the factors that influence the adsorption and time-dependent fixation on biochar at 20 Â°C, including pH, initial concentration of U\"V\"I and contact time. Uranium (U\"V\"I) adsorption was highly dependent on pH but adsorption on biochar was high over a wide range of pH values, from 4.5 to 9.0, and adsorption strength was time-dependent over several days. The experimental data for pH > 7 were most effectively modelled using a Freundlich adsorption isotherm coupled to a reversible first order kinetic equation to describe the time-dependent fixation of U\"V\"I within the biochar structure. Desorption experiments showed that U\"V\"I was only sparingly desorbable from the biochar with time and isotopic dilution with \"2\"3\"3U\"V\"I confirmed the low, or time-dependent, lability of adsorbed \"2\"3\"8U\"V\"I. Below pH 7 the adsorption isotherm trend suggested precipitation, rather than true adsorption, may occur. However, across all pH values (4.5-9) measured saturation indices suggested precipitation was possible: autunite below pH 6.5 and either swartzite, liebigite or bayleyite above pH 6.5.\n\nTemperature dependence and effects of series resistance on current and admittance measurements of Al/SnO2/p-Si MIS diode\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAltindal, S.; Tekeli, Z.; Karadeniz, S.; Sahingoez, R.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nTemperature dependency and the series resistance effect on I-V, C-V and G-V characteristics of Al/SnO 2 /p-Si MIS diode were investigated in the temperature range 150-350 K. The current-voltage (I-V) analysis in this temperature range gives the saturation current (10''-''9 - 10''-''5 A), the ideality factor (6-1.8), the barrier height Î¦ B (I-V) (0.3-0.65 eV) the density of interface states D it (8x10''1''3 - 1x10''1''3 eV''-''1cm''-''2) and the series resistance R s (500-100 Î©). The decreases with increasing temperature of density of interface states is the result of molecular restructuring and reordering at the metal-semiconductor interface. The value of series resistance 520 Î© was calculated from the admittance measurement at room temperature and enough high frequency (500 khz) when the diode is biased in strong accumulation region. The admittance frequency (C-V and G-V) measurement confirmed that the measured capacitance (C m ) and conductance (G m ) varies with applied voltage and frequency due to the presence of density of interface states in the MIS diode, interfacial insulator layer and enough high series resistance. Similar results have been observed on MIS type Schottky diodes\n\nTemperature dependence of the beam-foil interaction\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGay, T.J.; Berry, H.G.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThe beam energy dependence between 50 and 200 keV of the linear polarization fraction (M/I) of the 2s 1 S--3p 1 P, 5016 A transition in He I on temperature was measured. The thin carbon exciter foils were heated externally by nichrome resistance elements. The measurements of Hight et al. are duplicated; the energy and current dependences are the same for corresponding between beam heating and external heating. It was also observed that Î³, the number of slow secondary electrons produced per incident ion, decreases with increasing foil temperature. These two effects, in conjunction, offer a plausible explanation for the variation of polarization with beam current density. 5 figures\n\nTemperature dependent electrical characteristics of Zn/ZnSe/n-GaAs/In structure\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSaÄlam, M.; GÃ¼zeldir, B.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWe have reported a study of the I-V characteristics of Zn/ZnSe/n-GaAs/In sandwich structure in a wide temperature range of 80-300 K by a step of 20 K, which are prepared by Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) method. The main electrical parameters, such as ideality factor and zero-bias barrier height determined from the forward bias I-V characteristics were found strongly depend on temperature and when the increased, the n decreased with increasing temperature. The ideality factor and barrier height values as a function of the sample temperature have been attributed to the presence of the lateral inhomogeneities of the barrier height. Furthermore, the series resistance have been calculated from the I-V measurements as a function of temperature dependent.\n\nComparison between steady-state and dynamic I-V measurements from a single-cell thermionic fuel element\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWernsman, Bernard\n\n1997-01-01\n\nA comparison between steady-state and dynamic I-V measurements from a single-cell thermionic fuel element (TFE) is made. The single-cell TFE used in this study is the prototype for the 40 kW e space nuclear power system that is similar to the 6 kW e TOPAZ-II. The steady-state I-V measurements influence the emitter temperature due to electron cooling. Therefore, to eliminate the steady-state I-V measurement influence on the TFE and provide a better understanding of the behavior of the thermionic energy converter and TFE characteristics, dynamic I-V measurements are made. The dynamic I-V measurements are made at various input power levels, cesium pressures, collector temperatures, and steady-state current levels. From these measurements, it is shown that the dynamic I-V's do not change the TFE characteristics at a given operating point. Also, the evaluation of the collector work function from the dynamic I-V measurements shows that the collector optimization is not due to a minimum in the collector work function but due to an emission optimization. Since the dynamic I-V measurements do not influence the TFE characteristics, it is believed that these measurements can be done at a system level to understand the influence of TFE placement in the reactor as a function of the core thermal distribution\n\nKorekcija temperature v tunelski peÄi\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nDOLENC, PETER\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCilj diplomske naloge je bil programsko odpraviti problem preveÄ zapeÄenih izdelkov v serijski proizvodnji peke kruha.

In order to clarify the effect of atmosphere on photoconductivity, measurements have been performed under helium and nitrogen gas flow in the temperature range from 10 K to room temperature (RT and from 100 K to RT, respectively. Photoconductive response monotonously increases with a decrease in temperature and tends to saturate around 10 K. No clear difference in photoconductive response under different atmosphere was observed. We discuss the mechanism of photoconductivity at 0.7 eV.\n\nTemperature dependence of CsI(Tl) gamma-ray excited scintillation characteristics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1993-01-01\n\nGamma-ray excited emission spectrum, absolute scintillation yield, rise and decay time constants, and thermoluminescence emissions of CsI(Tl) were measured at -100 to +50 C, for crystals from 4 different vendors. The thermoluminescence glow curves were the only property that varied significantly from crystal to crystal; room temperature operation in current mode could be susceptible to temperature fluctuations. The CsI(Tl) emission spectrum has emission bands peaking around 400 and 560 nm; the former band disappears between -50 and -75 C. The RT absolute scintillation yield was calculated to be 65,500Â±4,100 photons/MeV. The two primary decay time constants increases about exponentially with inverse temperature. An ultra-fast decay component was confirmed. Applications are discussed\n\nThe temperature dependent amide I band of crystalline acetanilide\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nCruzeiro, Leonor [CCMAR, Universidade do Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro (Portugal); Physics Department, FCT, Universidade do Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro (Portugal); Freedman, Holly [CCMAR, Universidade do Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro (Portugal)\n\n2013-10-01\n\nThe temperature dependent anomalous peak in the amide I band of crystalline acetanilide is thought to be due to self-trapped states.

Films are prepared by drop casting AuNPs and UMCP in desired manner on silicon substrates. Samples are further analyzed for morphology under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). STS measurements performed in temperature range of 33 Â°C to 142 Â°C show systematic variation in current versus voltage (I-V) curves, exhibiting semiconducting to metallic transition/Schottky behavior for different samples, depending upon preparation method and as function of temperature. During current versus time (I-t) measurement for AuNPs, random telegraphic noise is observed at room temperature. Random switching of tunneling current between two discrete levels is observed for this sample. Power spectra derived from I-t show 1/f2 dependence. Statistical analysis of fluctuations shows exponential behavior with time width Ï â 7 ms. Local density of states (LDOS) plots derived from I-V curves of each sample show systematic shift in valance/conduction band edge towards/away from Fermi level, with respect to increase in temperature. Schottky emission is best fitted electron emission mechanism for all samples over certain range of bias voltage. Schottky plots are used to calculate barrier heights and temperature dependent measurements helped in measuring activation energies for electron transport in all samples.\n\nAngle and Polarization Dependent Fluorescence EXAFS Measurements on Al-doped Single Crystal V_2O3 Above and Below the Transition Temperature\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMÃ¼ller, O.; Pfalzer, P.; Schramme, M.; Urbach, J.-P.; Klemm, M.; Horn, S.; Frenkel, A. I.; Denboer, M. L.\n\n1998-03-01\n\nWe present angle and polarisation dependent flourescence EXAFS measured on Al-doped single crystal V_2O3 below and above the structural phase transition from monoclinic to trigonal. Strong self-absorption distorted the spectra; this was corrected by using the procedure described by TrÃ¶ger et al. (L. TrÃ¶ger, D. Arvantis, K. Baberschke, H. Michaelis, U. Grimm, and E. Zschech, Phys. Rev. B,.46), 3238 (1992), generalized to the Lytle detector employed in our work. The spectra show pronounced dependence on the angle between the threefold symmetry axes and the polarization of the incident photons, making it possible to measure the local atomic distances in different directions. We compare our results with the measurements of Frenkel et al. (A. I. Frenkel, E. A. Stern, and F. A. Chudnovsky, Sol. State Comm.102), 637 (1997) on pure V_2O3 They found that locally the monoclinic distortion persists in the trigonal metallic phase.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the characteristics of crystalline-silicon-based heterojunction solar cells\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSachenko, A. V.; Kryuchenko, Yu. V.; Kostylyov, V. P.; Korkishko, R. M.; Sokolovskyi, I. O.; Abramov, A. S.; Abolmasov, S. N.; Andronikov, D. A.; Bobyl', A. V.; Panaiotti, I. E.; Terukov, E. I.; Titov, A. S.; Shvarts, M. Z.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTemperature dependences of the photovoltaic characteristics of ( p)a-Si/( i)a-Si:H/( n)c-Si singlecrystalline- silicon based heterojunction-with-intrinsic-thin-layer (HIT) solar cells have been measured in a temperature range of 80-420 K. The open-circuit voltage ( V OC), fill factor ( FF) of the current-voltage ( I-U) characteristic, and maximum output power ( P max) reach limiting values in the interval of 200-250 K on the background of monotonic growth in the short-circuit current ( I SC) in a temperature range of 80-400 K. At temperatures below this interval, the V OC, FF, and P max values exhibit a decrease. It is theoretically justified that a decrease in the photovoltaic energy conversion characteristics of solar cells observed on heating from 250 to 400 K is related to exponential growth in the intrinsic conductivity. At temperatures below 200 K, the I-U curve shape exhibits a change that is accompanied by a drop in V OC. Possible factors that account for the decrease in V OC, FF, and P max are considered.\n\nElectrical Characterization of Graphite/InP Schottky Diodes by I-V-T and C-V Methods\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTiagulskyi, Stanislav; Yatskiv, Roman; Grym, Jan\n\n2018-02-01\n\nA rectifying junction was prepared by casting a drop of colloidal graphite on the surface of an InP substrate. The electrophysical properties of graphite/InP junctions were investigated in a wide temperature range. Temperature-dependent I-V characteristics of the graphite/InP junctions are explained by the thermionic emission mechanism. The Schottky barrier height (SBH) and the ideality factor were found to be 0.9 eV and 1.47, respectively. The large value of the SBH and its weak temperature dependence are explained by lateral homogeneity of the junction, which is related to the structure of the graphite layer. The moderate disagreement between the current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements is attributed to the formation of interfacial native oxide film on the InP surface.\n\nTemperature-dependent photoluminescence analysis of 1-MeV electron irradiation-induced nonradiative recombination centers in GaAs/Ge space solar cells\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTiancheng, Yi; Pengfei, Xiao; Yong, Zheng; Juan, Tang; Rong, Wang, E-mail: wangr@bnu.edu.cn\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe effects of irradiation of 1-MeV electrons on p{sup +}ân GaAs/Ge solar cells have been investigated by temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements in the temperature range of 10â290 K. The temperature dependence of the PL peak energy agrees well with the Varnish relation, and the thermal quenching of the total integrated PL intensity is well explained by the thermal quenching theory. Meanwhile, the thermal quenching of temperature-dependent PL confirmed that there are two nonradiative recombination centers in the solar cells, and the thermal activation energies of these centers are determined by Arrhenius plots of the total integrated PL intensity. Furthermore, the nonradiative recombination center, as a primary defect, is identified as the H3 hole trap located at E{sub v} + 0.71 eV at room temperature and the H2 hole trap located at E{sub v} + 0.41 eV in the temperature range of 100â200 K, by comparing the thermal activation and ionization energies of the defects.\n\nA modified phase coherence model for the non-linear c-axis V-I characteristics of highly anisotropic, high temperature superconductors\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLuo Sheng; Huang Sai Jun; He Yu Sheng; Li Chun Guang; Zhang Xue Qiang\n\n2003-01-01\n\nA modified Ambegaokar-Halperin thermal-fluctuation model has been developed to describe the c-axis V-I characteristics and low-current ohmic resistance of highly anisotropic superconductors in a magnetic field parallel to the c-axis. The model assumes loss of phase coherence across the CuO-planes associated with the correlated motion of pancake vortices in the liquid state. The predicted V-I characteristics in the current-induced transition from the superconducting to the resistive state are in good agreement with measurements on a 2212-BSCCO single crystal as a function of temperature and field, provided the effect of the interlayer capacitance is taken into account. The measurements are consistent with a flux pancake correlation length within the CuO-planes varying as xi sub 0 /(T/T sub 0 - 1) supnu, where xi sub 0 = 1.57 +- 0.08 mu m and nu = 0.50 +- 0.01. Our measurements imply a current-dependent interlayer resistance above and below T sub c.\n\nTemperature dependent charge transport studies across thermodynamic glass transition in P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction: insight from J-V and impedance spectroscopy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSarkar, Atri; Rahaman, Abdulla Bin; Banerjee, Debamalya\n\n2018-03-01\n\nTemperature dependent charge transport properties of P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction are analysed by dc and ac measurements under dark conditions across a wide temperature range of 110-473âK, which includes the thermodynamic glass transition temperature (Tg Ë320 K) of the system. A change from Ohmic conduction to space charge limited current conduction at higher (â©¾1.2âV) applied bias voltages aboveâââ©¾200âK is observed from J-V characteristics. From capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurement at room temperature, the occurrence of a peak near the built-in voltage is observed below the dielectric relaxation frequency, originating from the competition between drift and diffusion driven motions of charges. Carrier concentration (N) is calculated from C-V measurements taken at different temperatures. Room temperature mobility values at various applied bias voltages are in accordance with that obtained from transient charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage measurement. Sample impedance is measured over five decades of frequency across temperature range by using lock-in detection. This data is used to extract temperature dependence of carrier mobility (Î¼), and dc conductivity (Ï_dc ) which is low frequency extrapolation of ac conductivity. An activation energy ofââË126 meV for the carrier hopping process at the metal-semiconductor interface is estimated from temperature dependence of Ï_dc . Above T g, Î¼ levels off to a constant value, whereas Ï_dc starts to decrease after a transition knee at T g that can be seen as a combined effect of changes in Î¼ and N. All these observed changes across T g can be correlated to enhanced polymer motion above the glass transition.\n\nInvestigation of temperature dependent barrier height of Au/ZnO/Si schottky diodes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAsghar, M.; Mahmood, K.; Rabia, S.; BM, S.; Shahid, M. Y.; Hasan, M. A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn this study, temperature dependent current-voltage (I-V) measurements have been performed to investigate the inhomogeneity in the temperature dependent barrier heights of Au/ZnO/Si Schottky barrier diode in the temperature range 150 - 400K. The room temperature values for ideality factor and barrier height were found to be 2.9 and 0.60 eV respectively indicating the inhomogenity in the barrier heights of grown samples. The Richardson plot and ideality factor verses barrier height graph were also drawn to verified the discontinuity between Au and ZnO. This barrier height inhomogenity was explained by applying Gaussian distribution model. The extrapolation of the linear Fap (n) plot to n= 1 has given a homogeneous barrier height of approximately 1.1 eV. Fap versus 1/T plot was drawn to obtain the values of mean barrier height for Au/ZnO/Si Schottky diode (1.1 eV) and standard deviation(ds) (0.02 V) at zero bais.

At the lowest temperatures we can identify in the magnetic excitation spectra the following features: (i) a dominant line at Î=12 meV with a shoulder at 11.1 meV, and (ii) two weak lines at 3.8 and 5.5 meV. The temperature dependence of the average position Î of the dominant line follows roughly the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization of Y 2 Fe 14 B indicating that the energy of this mode is substantially fixed by the molecular fields of the surrounding Fe moments. Slight deviations, however, indicate that the Dy level spacing is not equidistant due to crystal field effects.

The nanoheterojunctions have been constructed by three layers: the upper layer being a nc-CdS thin films, the intermediate layer being the interface region including nc-CdS and nanocrystal silicon (nc-Si), and the bottom layer being nc-Si layer grown on sc-Si substrate. The room temperature and temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) have been measured and analyzed to provide some useful information of defect states. Utilizing the Gauss-Newton fitting method, five emission peaks from the temperature-dependent PL spectra can be determined. From the high energy to low energy, these five peaks are ascribed to the some luminescence centers which are formed by the oxygen-related deficiency centers in the silicon oxide layer of Si-NPA, the band gap emission of nc-CdS, the transition from the interstitial cadmium (I{sub Cd}) to the valence band, the recombination from I{sub Cd} to cadmium vacancies (V{sub Cd}), and from sulfur vacancies (V{sub s}) to the valence band, respectively. Understanding of the defect states in the CdS/Si nanoheterojunctions is very meaningful for the performance of devices based on CdS/Si nanoheterojunctions.

The photoluminescence feature of the zero phonon line of silicon-vacancy (Si-V) centers in Si-doped chemical vapor deposited single crystal diamond (SCD) with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced by gold nanoparticles has been studied at temperatures ranging from liquid nitrogen temperature to 473âK, as compared with that of the SCD counterpart in absence of the LSPR. It is found that with LSPR the emission intensities of Si-V centers are significantly enhanced by factors of tens and the magnitudes of the redshift (width) of the emissions become smaller (narrower), in comparison with those of normal emissions without plasmon resonance. More interestingly, these strong Si-V emissions appear remarkably at temperatures up to 473âK, while the spectral feature was not reported in previous studies on the intrinsic Si-doped diamonds when temperatures are higher than room temperature. These findings would lead to reaching high performance diamond-based devices, such as single photon emitter, quantum cryptography, biomarker, and so forth, working under high temperature conditions.\n\nNoise measurements of YBa2Cu3O7 thin film high-temperature superconductors\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHall, J.J.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe characteristics of thin-film YBa2Cu3O7 superconductors were studied from the superconducting region through the transition region and into the normal region. The properties studied included the resistance-temperature, current-voltage, and electrical noise with concentration of measurements in the transition region. The resistance vs. temperature measurements show a zero resistance followed by a small rise in magnitude at the onset of resistance followed by a sharp increase until the resistance tapers off in the fully normal region. The a-axis films had a larger normal resistivity, a lower critical temperature, and a broader transition than the similar c-axis films. The current(I) - voltage(V) measurements were concentrated in the transition region. A power relation between I and V was found to be V varies as I a(T) where a(T) is temperature dependent starting high the onset of vortex formation, approaches 3 at the vortex unbinding temperature, and goes to 1 when fully normal. This behavior was predicted by the Kosterlitz-Thouless theory and was found experimentally in all four films measured. The current-induced electrical noise characteristics were measured for four samples varying in thickness and axis orientation. Each film exhibited a widely varying magnitude of the noise voltage spectral density (S V ) in the transition region with a leveling off when fully normal. The normalized noise (S V /V squared) showed a sharp decrease in magnitude from the onset of measurable noise continually decreasing until flattening out when fully normal. The a-axis films exhibited S V /V squared over 3 order of magnitude larger than the c-axis films in the transition and normal regions. The normalized temperature coefficient of resistance (beta) was plotted against S V /V squared on a log-log scale to see if the noise generated was due to temperature fluctuations (slope = 2)\n\nTemperature dependence of mobility in silicon (100) inversion layers at low temperatures\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKawaguchi, Y.; Suzuki, T.; Kawaji, S.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nElectron mobility of Si(100) n-inversion layers in MOSFETs having Î¼sub(peak) (4.2 K) = 4000.6500 and 12000 cm 2 /V x s has been measured at temperatures between 1 and 80 K.

A way to infer the microscopic scattering mechanism(s) in MAPbI3 is through the measured temperature dependence of carrier mobility. To this end, how does the carrier effective mass depend on temperature, m* = m*(T), is a useful information since the mobility is a function of m*. By atomistic first principles, we report the calculated m*(T) due to the thermal expansion of MAPbI3 materials, in the experimentally relevant range of 130 K to room temperature. The calculated results suggest m* = m*(T) to be linear in T. The increase of m* versus temperature is predominantly due to the expansion of the longitudinal atomic spacing that weakens the s/p hybridization between the I/Pb atoms.\n\nA fully automated temperature-dependent resistance measurement setup using van der Pauw method\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPandey, Shivendra Kumar; Manivannan, Anbarasu\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe van der Pauw (VDP) method is widely used to identify the resistance of planar homogeneous samples with four contacts placed on its periphery. We have developed a fully automated thin film resistance measurement setup using the VDP method with the capability of precisely measuring a wide range of thin film resistances from few mÎ© up to 10 GÎ© under controlled temperatures from room-temperature up to 600 Â°C. The setup utilizes a robust, custom-designed switching network board (SNB) for measuring current-voltage characteristics automatically at four different source-measure configurations based on the VDP method. Moreover, SNB is connected with low noise shielded coaxial cables that reduce the effect of leakage current as well as the capacitance in the circuit thereby enhancing the accuracy of measurement. In order to enable precise and accurate resistance measurement of the sample, wide range of sourcing currents/voltages are pre-determined with the capability of auto-tuning for Ë12 orders of variation in the resistances. Furthermore, the setup has been calibrated with standard samples and also employed to investigate temperature dependent resistance (few Î©-10 GÎ©) measurements for various chalcogenide based phase change thin films (Ge2Sb2Te5, Ag5In5Sb60Te30, and In3SbTe2). This setup would be highly helpful for measurement of temperature-dependent resistance of wide range of materials, i.e., metals, semiconductors, and insulators illuminating information about structural change upon temperature as reflected by change in resistances, which are useful for numerous applications.\n\nShunt and series resistance of photovoltaic module evaluated from the I-V curve; I-V tokusei kara hyokashita taiyo denchi no shunt teiko to chokuretsu teiko\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAsano, K; Kawamura, H; Yamanaka, S; Kawamura, H; Ono, H [Meijo University, Nagoya (Japan)\n\n1997-11-25\n\nWith an objective of discussing I-V characteristics when a shadow has appeared on part of a photovoltaic module, evaluations were given as a first stage of the study on saturation current, shunt resistance and series resistance for the solar cell module. As a result of measuring change in amount of power generated in a sunny day with a shadow appearing over the solar cell module, reduction in power generation capability of about 23% was verified. In other words, the I-V characteristics of the solar cell module change largely because of existence of the shadow caused on the module. The I-V characteristics curve may be expressed and calculated as a function of the shunt resistance and series resistance. By curve-fitting measurement data for a case of changing insolation without existence of partial shadow, values of the shunt resistance and series resistance were derived. As a result, it was found that the calculations agree well with measurements. It was made also clear that each parameter shows temperature dependence. 6 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.\n\nAnalysis on temperature dependent current mechanism of tunnel field-effect transistors\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, Junil; Kwon, Dae Woong; Kim, Hyun Woo; Kim, Jang Hyun; Park, Euyhwan; Park, Taehyung; Kim, Sihyun; Lee, Ryoongbin; Lee, Jong-Ho; Park, Byung-Gook\n\n2016-06-01\n\nIn this paper, the total drain current (I D) of a tunnel FET (TFET) is decomposed into each current component with different origins to analyze the I D formation mechanisms of the TFET as a function of gate voltage (V GS). Transfer characteristics are firstly extracted with fabricated Silicon channel TFETs (Si TFETs) and silicon germanium channel TFETs (SiGe TFETs) at various temperatures. The subthreshold swings (SS) of both Si TFETs and SiGe TFETs get degraded and the SSs of SiGe TFETs get degraded more as temperature becomes higher. Then, all the I Ds measured at various temperatures are decomposed into each current component through technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulations with a good agreement with experimental data. As a result, it is revealed that Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination mainly contribute to the I D of a TFET before band to band tunneling (BTBT) occurs. Furthermore, the SS degradation by high temperature is explained successfully by the SRH recombination with electric field dependence.\n\nTemperature dependent current transport of Pd/ZnO nanowire Schottky diodes\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGayen, R. N.; Bhattacharyya, S. R.; Jana, P.\n\n2014-09-01\n\nZinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire based Schottky barrier diodes are fabricated by depositing Pd metal contact on top of vertically well-aligned ZnO nanowire arrays. A vertical array of ZnO nanowires on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates is synthesized by hybrid wet chemical route. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement confirm the formation of stoichiometric well-aligned hexagonal (h-ZnO) nanowire arrays with wurtzite structure. Temperature dependent current-voltage (I-V) measurements on palladium-ZnO (Pd/ZnO) nanowire Schottky junctions in the temperature range 303-383 K exhibit excellent rectifying character. From these nonlinear I-V plots, different electrical parameters of diode-like reverse saturation current, barrier height and ideality factor are determined as a function of temperature assuming pure thermionic emission model. The ideality factor is found to decrease while the barrier height increases with the increase in temperature. The series resistance values calculated from Cheungâs functions also show temperature dependency. Such behavior can be attributed to the presence of defects that traps carriers, and barrier height inhomogeneity at the interface of the barrier junction. After barrier height inhomogeneity correction, considering a Gaussian distributed barrier height fluctuation across the Pd/ZnO interface, the estimated values of mean barrier height and modified Richardson constant are more closely matched to the theoretically predicted value for Pd/ZnO Schottky barrier diodes. The variation of density of interface states as a function of interface state energy is also calculated.\n\nEnergy- and temperature dependences of secondary electron emission of CsI- and CsBr layers doped with Cd\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGalij, P.V.; Tsal', N.A.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe energy and temperature dependences of the secondary electron emission coefficient (SEEC) of CsI-Cd-, CsBr-Cd-, CsI-CsBr layers have been studied. The effect of bivalent cadmium impurity on the SEEC value is investigated. It is shown that implantation of small amounts of Cd 2+ impurity into the lattice of the initial monocrystals might increase the SEEC values of the layers. Temperature dependences (TD) of SEEC are measured and the possibility of comparing experimental results with the Dekker formula is analyzed. A conclusion is drawn that the Dekker model well describes the TD of SEEC of doped layers at temperatures T < or approximately 100 deg C. At elevated temperatures., along with secondary electron scattering on phonons, one should take into account their scattering on vacancies\n\nTemperature and humidity dependence of air fluorescence yield measured by AIRFLY\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAve, M.; Bohacova, M.; Buonomo, B.; Busca, N.; Cazon, L.; Chemerisov, S.D.; Conde, M.E.; Crowell, R.A.; Di Carlo, P.; Di Giulio, C.; Doubrava, M.; Esposito, A.; Facal, P.; Franchini, F.J.; Hoerandel, J.; Hrabovsky, M.; Iarlori, M.; Kasprzyk, T.E.; Keilhauer, B.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe fluorescence detection of ultra high energy cosmic rays requires a detailed knowledge of the fluorescence light emission from nitrogen molecules over a wide range of atmospheric parameters, corresponding to altitudes typical of the cosmic ray shower development in the atmosphere. We have studied the temperature and humidity dependence of the fluorescence light spectrum excited by MeV electrons in air. Results for the 313.6, 337.1, 353.7 and 391.4 nm bands are reported in this paper. We found that the temperature and humidity dependence of the quenching process changes the fluorescence yield by a sizeable amount (up to 20% for the temperature dependence in the 391.4 nm band) and its effect must be included for a precise estimation of the energy of ultra high energy cosmic rays.\n\nSurface temperature measurements for ion-bombarded Si and GaAs at 1.0 to 2.0 MeV\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLowe, L.F.; Kennedy, J.K.; Davies, D.E.; Deane, M.L.; Eyges, L.J.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nSurface temperatures of ion-bombarded silicon and gallium arsenide have been measured using an infrared detector.

In low temperature spectra, the iodine ions appear to be in nearly static environments in agreement with the low temperature crystal structure. However, at higher temperatures, substantial broadening of the central transition linewidth is consistent with the presence of two types of Ag + diffusion with activation energies of 0.17 and 0.0080 eV.

The temperature dependence of the critical Hall electric field F cr (T) for the collapse of R H (4) measured in these Hall bars is approximated using F cr (T) = F cr (0)(1 - (T/T cr ) 2 ). Here, the critical Hall electric field at zero temperature depends on the magnetic field B as F cr (0) â B 3/2 . Theoretical considerations are given on F cr (T) on the basis of a temperature-dependent mobility edge model and a schema of temperature-dependent inter-Landau level tunneling probability arising from the Fermi distribution function.

A relative decrease in the dissipation measured in V-H curves was observed as dH/dt is increased, which implies that the time spent to plot the whole cycle has an importance on the evolution of the V-H curves. Thus, it could be possible to observe the relaxation effects in magnetovoltage measurements. In addition, the several significant steps and plateaus in V-H curves evolve depending on the magnitude of the transport current and also dH/dt. These observations were attributed to locking of the flux lines to decrease or increase in size of the easy motion flow channels. The strong hysteresis effects in V-H curves were discussed mainly by means of the flux trapping within the granularity of sample and the different degree of the inhomogeneous flux motion with respect to the sweeping of the external magnetic field up and down\n\nLow-temperature mobility measurements on CMOS devices\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHairpetian, A.; Gitlin, D.; Viswanathan, C.R.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe surface channel mobility of carriers in eta- and rho-MOS transistors fabricated in a CMOS process was accurately determined at low temperatures down to 5 Î. The mobility was obtained by an accurate measurement of the inversion charge density using a split C-V technique and the conductance at low drain voltages. The split C-V technique was validated at all temperatures using a one-dimensional Poisson solver (MOSCAP), which was modified for low-temperature application. The mobility dependence on the perpendicular electric field for different substrate bias values appears to have different temperature dependence for eta- and rho-channel devices. The electron mobility increases with a decrease in temperature at all gate voltages. On the other hand, the hole mobility exhibits a different temperature behavior depending upon whether the gate voltage corresponds to strong inversion or is near threshold\n\nTemperature and Magnetic Field Driven Modifications in the I-V Features of Gold-DNA-Gold Structure\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNadia Mahmoudi Khatir\n\n2014-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The fabrication of Metal-DNA-Metal (MDM structure-based high sensitivity sensors from DNA micro-and nanoarray strands is a key issue in their development. The tunable semiconducting response of DNA in the presence of external electromagnetic and thermal fields is a gift for molecular electronics. The impact of temperatures (25â55 Â°C and magnetic fields (0â1200 mT on the current-voltage (I-V features of Au-DNA-Au (GDG structures with an optimum gap of 10 Î¼m is reported. The I-V characteristics acquired in the presence and absence of magnetic fields demonstrated the semiconducting diode nature of DNA in GDG structures with high temperature sensitivity. The saturation current in the absence of magnetic field was found to increase sharply with the increase of temperature up to 45 Â°C and decrease rapidly thereafter. This increase was attributed to the temperature-assisted conversion of double bonds into single bond in DNA structures. Furthermore, the potential barrier height and Richardson constant for all the structures increased steadily with the increase of external magnetic field irrespective of temperature variations. Our observation on magnetic field and temperature sensitivity of I-V response in GDG sandwiches may contribute towards the development of DNA-based magnetic sensors.\n\nOptical band gap demarcation around 2.15 eV depending on preferred orientation growth in red HgI{sub 2} films\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTyagi, Pankaj, E-mail: pankajtyagicicdu@gmail.com\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThermally evaporated stoichiometric films of red HgI{sub 2} show preferred orientation growth with either (102) or (002) orientation. The as grown films shows a change from one preferred orientation to another depending on their thickness, open-air heat-treatment and in-situ heat treatment of films. The in-situ heat-treatment of thermally evaporated stoichiometric films of red HgI{sub 2} with preferred growth of (102) orientation shows a gradual linear decrease in film thickness with in-situ heat-treatment temperature. On in-situ heat-treatment above 80 Â°C, it is found that HgI{sub 2} films become thinner than 900 nm, which are otherwise difficult to grow due to high vapor pressure of HgI{sub 2}. For these films the preferred orientation also changed from (102) to (002). The optical band gap (E{sub g}) also found to increase linearly with in-situ heat-treatment temperature. It is interesting to note that in-situ heat-treated films having (002) orientation had higher values of optical band gap than (102) orientation films. On combining these results with those of as grown and open-air heat-treated red HgI{sub 2} films reported in the literature, it is evident that there exists an optical band gap demarcation around 2.15 eV for red HgI{sub 2} thin films depending on their preferred orientation growth. Films with (102) orientation are found to have optical band gap less than 2.15 eV and those with (002) orientation are found to have optical band gap more than 2.15 eV. This is irrespective of the physical mean of obtaining the preferred orientation. The preferred orientation can be achieved by either physical means such as growing films with higher thickness, heat-treating them for short duration in open air or heat-treating them in-situ.\n\nTemperature-dependent optical absorption of SrTiO3\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKok, Dirk J.; Irmscher, Klaus; Naumann, Martin; Guguschev, Christo; Galazka, Zbigniew; Uecker, Reinhard\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe optical absorption edge and near infrared absorption of SrTiO 3 were measured at temperatures from 4 to 1703 K. The absorption edge decreases from 3.25 eV at 4 K to 1.8 eV at 1703 K and is extrapolated to approximately 1.2 eV at the melting point (2350 K). The transmission in the near IR decreases rapidly above 1400 K because of free carrier absorption and is about 50% of the room temperature value at 1673 K. The free carriers are generated by thermal excitation of electrons over the band gap and the formation of charged vacancies. The observed temperature-dependent infrared absorption can be well reproduced by a calculation based on simple models for the intrinsic free carrier concentration and the free carrier absorption coefficient. The measured red shift of the optical absorption edge and the rising free carrier absorption strongly narrow the spectral range of transmission and impede radiative heat transport through the crystal. These effects have to be considered in high temperature applications of SrTiO 3 -based devices, as the number of free carriers rises considerably, and in bulk crystal growth to avoid growth instabilities. Temperature dependent optical absorption edge of SrTiO 3 , measured, fitted, and extrapolated to the melting point. (copyright 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

Here, we report the temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL of strained and unstrained GaSe flakes. It is found that, as the temperature increases, the PL from both the strained (wrinkled and unstrained (flat positions show a prominent red-shift to low energies. However, for the flat case, the slope of PL energy versus temperature at the range of 163â283 K is about â0.36 meV/K, which is smaller than that of the wrinkled one (â0.5 meV/K. This is because more strain can be introduced at the freestanding wrinkled position during the temperature increase, thus accelerates the main PL peak (peak I, direct band gap transition shift to lower energy. Additionally, for the wrinkled sheet, three new exciton states (peaks III, IV, and V appear at the red side of peak I, and the emission intensity is highly dependent on the temperature variation. These peaks can be attributed to the bound exciton recombination. These findings demonstrate an interesting route for optical band gap tuning of the layered GaSe sheet, which are important for future optoelectronic device design.\n\nDiffractometric measurement of the temperature dependence of piezoelectric tensor in GMO monocrystal\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBreczko, Teodor; Lempaszek, Andrzej\n\n2007-04-01\n\nFunctional materials, of which an example is ferroelectric, ferroelastic monocrystal of molybdate (III) gadolinium (VI), are often used in the micro-motor operators (micro-servo motors) working in changeable environment conditions. Most frequently this change refers to temperature. That is why the important practical problem is the precise measurement of the value of piezoelectric tensor elements in dependence on the temperature of a particular monocrystal. In the presented article for this kind of measurements, the use of X-ray diffractometer has been shown. The advantage of the method presented is that, apart from precise dependence measurement between the temperature of a monocrystal and the value of piezoelectric tensor elements, it enables synchronous measurement of the value of thermal expansion tensor elements for a monocrystal.\n\nAnalysis of series resistance effects on forward I - V and C - V characteristics of mis type diodes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAltindal, S.; Tekeli, Z.; Karadeniz, S.; Tugluoglu, N.; Ercan, I.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nIn order to determine the series resistance R s , we have followed Lie et al., Cheung et al. and Kang et al., from the plot of I vs dV/dLn(I) which was linear curve over a wide range of current values at each temperature. The values of Rs were obtained from the slope of the linear parts of the curves and then the series resistance at each temperature has been evaluated at Ln(I) vs (V-IR s ) curves. The curves are linear over a wide range of voltage. The most reliable values of ideality factor n and reverse saturation current Is were then determined. In addition to role of series resistance on the C-V and G-V characteristics of diode have been investigated. Both C-V and G-V measurements show that the measured capacitance and conductance seriously varies with applied bias and frequency due to presence of R s . The density of interface states, barrier height and series resistance from the forward bias I-V characteristics using this method agrees very well with that obtained from the capacitance technique. It is clear that ignoring the series resistance (device with high series resistance) can lead to significant errors in the analysis of the I-V-T, C-V-f and G-V-f characteristics\n\nTemperature dependent characterization of gallium arsenide X-ray mesa p-i-n photodiodes\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLioliou, G., E-mail: G.Lioliou@sussex.ac.uk; Barnett, A.

The randomly selected diodes were fully etched and unpassivated. The diodes were 200âÎ¼m in diameter and had 7âÎ¼m thick i layers. The leakage current density was found to increase from (3âÂ±â1)ânA/cm{sup â2} at 0âÂ°C to (24.36âÂ±â0.05)âÎ¼A/cm{sup â2} at 120âÂ°C for D1 and from a current density smaller than the uncertainty (0.2âÂ±â1.2)ânA/cm{sup â2} at 0âÂ°C to (9.39âÂ±â0.02)âÎ¼A/cm{sup â2} at 120âÂ°C for D2 at the maximum investigated reverse bias (15âV).

Angewandte Physik - Sensorik\n\n2009-07-01\n\nThe influence of an annealing step on the parameters of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells is investigated. In order to fabricate the solar cells we use glass coated with ITO (indium-tin oxide) as a substrate on which the active layer consisting of P3HT and PCBM is spincoated. Al-electrodes are evaporated on top of the active layer. We use PEDOT:PSS as buffer layer. Each sample is annealed at different temperatures for a short time. Between every temperature step the I-V characteristic of the cell is measured. The following parameters are derived afterwards: FF, I{sub sc} (density), V{sub oc}. Also the efficiency is estimated. The results show a maximum cell efficiency for drying at 100 C for 20sec. A further important step for preparation is the drying procedure of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Here an improvement of about 50% in cell efficiency is measured after drying at 50 C for 5 days under inert gas atmosphere.\n\nFrequency and temperature dependent dielectric properties of TiO2-V2O5 nanocomposites\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRay, Apurba; Roy, Atanu; De, Sayan; Chatterjee, Souvik; Das, Sachindranath\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this manuscript, we have reported the crystal structure, dielectric response, and transport phenomenon of TiO2-V2O5 nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were synthesized using a sol-gel technique having different molar ratios of Ti:V (10:10, 10:15, and 10:20). The phase composition and the morphology have been studied using X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscope, respectively. The impedance spectroscopy studies of the three samples over a wide range of temperature (50 K-300 K) have been extensively described using the internal barrier layer capacitor model. It is based on the contribution of domain and domain boundary, relaxations of the materials, which are the main crucial factors for the enhancement of the dielectric response. The frequency dependent ac conductivity of the ceramics strongly obeys the well-known Jonscher's power law, and it has been clearly explained using the theory of jump relaxation model. The temperature dependent bulk conductivity is fairly recognized to the variable-range hopping of localized polarons. The co-existence of mixed valence state of Ti ions (Ti3+ and Ti4+) in the sample significantly contributes to the change of dielectric property. The overall study of dielectric response explains that the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss are strongly dependent on temperature and frequency and decrease with an increase of frequency as well as temperature.\n\nOn the temperature dependence of flammability limits of gases.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKondo, Shigeo; Takizawa, Kenji; Takahashi, Akifumi; Tokuhashi, Kazuaki\n\n2011-03-15\n\nFlammability limits of several combustible gases were measured at temperatures from 5 to 100 Â°C in a 12-l spherical flask basically following ASHRAE method. The measurements were done for methane, propane, isobutane, ethylene, propylene, dimethyl ether, methyl formate, 1,1-difluoroethane, ammonia, and carbon monoxide. As the temperature rises, the lower flammability limits are gradually shifted down and the upper limits are shifted up. Both the limits shift almost linearly to temperature within the range examined. The linear temperature dependence of the lower flammability limits is explained well using a limiting flame temperature concept at the lower concentration limit (LFL)--'White's rule'. The geometric mean of the flammability limits has been found to be relatively constant for many compounds over the temperature range studied (5-100 Â°C). Based on this fact, the temperature dependence of the upper flammability limit (UFL) can be predicted reasonably using the temperature coefficient calculated for the LFL. However, some compounds such as ethylene and dimethyl ether, in particular, have a more complex temperature dependence. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In each case I have used my personal computer at home and publicly available data and codes. I have used these in combination to produce the temperature dependent cross sections used in applications and presented in this report. I should mention that today anyone with a personal computer can produce these results. The latest ENDF/B-VII.1 beta2 data library was recently and is now freely available through the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC), Brookhaven National Laboratory. This release completely supersedes all preceding releases of ENDF/B. As distributed the ENDF/B-VII.1 data includes cross sections represented in the form of a combination of resonance parameters and/or tabulated energy dependent cross sections, nominally at 0 Kelvin temperature. For use in our applications the ENDF/B-VII.1 library has been processed into cross sections at eight neutron reactor like temperatures, between 0 and 2100 Kelvin, in steps of 300 Kelvin (the exception being 293.6 Kelvin, for exact room temperature at 20 Celsius). It has also been processed to five astrophysics like temperatures, 1, 10, 100 eV, 1 and 10 keV. For reference purposes, 300 Kelvin is approximately 1/40 eV, so that 1 eV is approximately 12,000 Kelvin. At each temperature the cross sections are tabulated and linearly interpolable in energy. All results are in the computer independent ENDF-6 character format [R2], which allows the data to be easily transported between computers. In its processed form the POINT 2011 library is approximately 16 gigabyte in size and is distributed on one compressed DVDs (see, below for the details of the contents of each DVD).\n\nThe validity, reliability, and utility of the iButtonÂ® for measurement of body temperature circadian rhythms in sleep/wake research.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHasselberg, Michael J; McMahon, James; Parker, Kathy\n\n2013-01-01\n\nChanges in core body temperature due to heat transfer through the skin have a major influence on sleep regulation. Traditional measures of skin temperature are often complicated by extensive wiring and are not practical for use in normal living conditions. This review describes studies examining the reliability, validity and utility of the iButtonÂ®, a wireless peripheral thermometry device, in sleep/wake research. A review was conducted of English language literature on the iButton as a measure of circadian body temperature rhythms associated with the sleep/wake cycle. Seven studies of the iButtton as a measure of human body temperature were included. The iButton was found to be a reliable and valid measure of body temperature. Its application to human skin was shown to be comfortable and tolerable with no significant adverse reactions. Distal skin temperatures were negatively correlated with sleep/wake activity, and the temperature gradient between the distal and proximal skin (DPG) was identified as an accurate physiological correlate of sleep propensity. Methodological issues included site of data logger placement, temperature masking factors, and temperature data analysis. The iButton is an inexpensive, wireless data logger that can be used to obtain a valid measurement of human skin temperature. It is a practical alternative to traditional measures of circadian rhythms in sleep/wake research. Further research is needed to determine the utility of the iButton in vulnerable populations, including those with neurodegenerative disorders and memory impairment and pediatric populations.

Three main luminescence bands are observed, with peaks at approx. 2.30, 2.20, and 2.00 eV at 77 K. At 4.2 K, the highest energy peak shows considerable structure. The temperature dependence of these lines indicates both free and bound exciton recombination, and very small exciton binding energies (approx. 3 to 5 MeV) have been estimated. A comparison of the results of sublimation and doping experiments suggests that the lowest energy band may be related to impurities, whereas the middle-energy band is related to I content. The two strongest bound exciton lines comprising the high-energy band show systematic correlations with the middle-energy, I-related band. Further correlations between these spectral features and the performance of nuclear radiation detectors fabricated from these samples are also noted. The temperature coefficient of the band gap is estimated from the spectral shift of luminescence lines to be approximately -1.13 x 10 -4 eV/K between 32 K and 45 K\n\nIrradiation and annealing effects of deuteron irradiated NbTi and V3Ga multifilamentary composite wires at low temperature\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSeibt, E.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nTo study the effects of low-temperature irradiation on technological type II-superconductors, NbTi and V 3 Ga multifilamentary composite wires, the critical current I/sub c/ and transition temperature T/sub c/ were measured before and after irradiation with 50-MeV deuterons at 10 and 15 0 K, respectively. While the irradiation effects on I/sub c/ and T/sub c/ of NbTi are substantially unaffected, the V 3 Ga wires undergo a reduction in I/sub c/ of about 50 percent and T/sub c/ decreases from 14.7 +- 0.1 0 K to 12.3 +- 0.1 0 K at a total deuteron flux of 2.6 x 10 17 cm -2 . Annealing experiments at room temperature and 100 0 C show only a small recovery of the superconducting properties up to 15 percent. The field dependence of the volume pinning force densities P/sub V/ was determined and the results are shown to be consistent with a qualitative dynamic pinning model\n\nIntegrated Amorphous Silicon p-i-n Temperature Sensor for CMOS Photonics\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSandro Rao\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H shows interesting optoelectronic and technological properties that make it suitable for the fabrication of passive and active micro-photonic devices, compatible moreover with standard microelectronic devices on a microchip. A temperature sensor based on a hydrogenated amorphous silicon p-i-n diode integrated in an optical waveguide for silicon photonics applications is presented here. The linear dependence of the voltage drop across the forward-biased diode on temperature, in a range from 30 Â°C up to 170 Â°C, has been used for thermal sensing. A high sensitivity of 11.9 mV/Â°C in the bias current range of 34â40 nA has been measured. The proposed device is particularly suitable for the continuous temperature monitoring of CMOS-compatible photonic integrated circuits, where the behavior of the on-chip active and passive devices are strongly dependent on their operating temperature.\n\nYBCO single crystals I-V characteristics nonlinearity and Nelson-Kosterlitz jump\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKuzmichev, N.D.; Vasyutin, M.A.; Golovashkin, A.I.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTemperature dependences of I-V characteristics and voltage harmonics V n (T) (n = 2, 3, ...) have been investigated in magnetic fields up to 200 Oe for single crystals YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-x . It was shown that V n (T) had asymmetric peak form with maximum at T* = 92.0 K. Amplitudes of V n (T) were decreased in magnetic fields. The results were explained on the base of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition model. It was shown that T* coincided with the BKT transition temperature T BKT . The asymmetric peaks of V n (T) are a consequence of the Nelson-Kosterlitz jump\n\nHepatic 123I-insulin binding kinetics in non-insulin-dependent (Type 2) diabetic patients after i.v. bolus administration\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOolbekkink, M.; Veen, E.A. van der; Heine, R.J.; Hollander, W. den; Nauta, J.J.P.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nInsulin binding kinetics in the liver were studied in non insulin dependent (Type 2) diabetic patients, by i.v. bolus administration of 123 I-insulin. Eight Type 2 diabetic patients were compared with six male volunteers. Uptake of 123 I-insulin by liver and kidneys was measured by dynamic scintigraphy with a gamma camera during 30 min. Images of liver and kidneys appeared within 2-3 min after administration of 123 I-insulin at a dose of 1 mCi (37 MBq). Peak radioactivity for the liver was found 7.5Â±0.2 and 6.9Â±0.3 min after injection for the healthy and the diabetic subjects, respectively (N.S.). The percentage 123 I-insulin hepatic uptake was not significantly different for the diabetic and the healthy subjects. Although a large variation exists for maximal uptake of radioactivity within both groups, the data suggest that binding differences in the liver in Type 2 diabetic patients, as compared to healthy subjects, may not account for hepatic insulin resistance.

It was found that I DS,max and g m,max have weak temperature dependence with a power-law relation of T -0.5, owing to suppressed optical phonon scattering. The threshold voltage ( V th) was found to be stable under increasing temperatures owing to the use of a semi-insulating AlInN:Mg barrier. This indicates that AlInN:Mg/GaN HEMTs are promising candidates for high-temperature electronics applications.[Figure not available: see fulltext.\n\nROTATIONâACTIVITY CORRELATIONS IN K AND M DWARFS.

Simultaneous measurements were performed of strain, electric field and polarization to form a complete response map from room temperature up to 200 {sup 0}C. An electrostrictive model is shown to provide an accurate description of the electromechanical response to high levels of induced polarization and electric field. This provides a method for decoupling strain contributions from thermal expansion and polarization changes. Direct measurements of electrostriction and thermal expansion, above and below the Curie temperature, are reported. Electrostriction coefficients are shown to be temperature dependent in these ceramic materials, with different values above and below the Curie temperature.\n\nTemperature response of soil respiration is dependent on concentration of readily decomposable C\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA. A. Larionova\n\n2007-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Temperature acclimation of soil organic matter (SOM decomposition is one of the major uncertainties in predicting soil CO2 efflux associated with the increase in global mean temperature. A reasonable explanation for an apparent acclimation proposed by Davidson and colleagues (2006 based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics suggests that temperature sensitivity decreases when both maximal activity of respiratory enzymes (Vmax and half-saturation constant (<i>Ks> cancel each other upon temperature increase. We tested the hypothesis of the canceling effect by the mathematical simulation of data obtained in incubation experiments with forest and arable soils. Our data support the hypothesis and suggest that concentration of readily decomposable C substrate (as glucose equivalents and temperature dependent substrate release are the important factors controlling temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. The highest temperature sensitivity of soil respiration was observed when substrate release was temperature dependent and C substrate concentration was much lower than <i>Ks>. Increase of substrate content to the half-saturation constant by glucose addition resulted in temperature acclimation associated with the canceling effect. Addition of the substrate to the level providing respiration at a maximal rate Vmax leads to the acclimation of the whole microbial community as such. However, growing microbial biomass was more sensitive to the temperature alterations. This study improves our understanding of the instability of temperature sensitivity of soil respiration under field conditions, attributing this phenomenon to changes in concentration of readily decomposable C substrate.\n\nTemperature dependent admittance spectroscopy of GaAs/AlGaAs single-quantum-well laser diodes (SQWLDs)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBengi, A.; Uslu, H.; Asar, T.; Altindal, S.; Cetin, S.S.; Mammadov, T.S.; Ozcelik, S.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nResearch highlights: â It is well known the quantum-well (QW) lasers are the most important optoelectronic devices in many application fields. The temperature dependent I-V and C-V measurements allow us to understand the different aspects of conduction mechanisms of these devices. The C-V and G/Ï-V measurements should be done over a wide range of temperature in order to have a better understanding of the nature of barrier height and conduction mechanisms. Therefore, in this study, the main electrical parameters of GaAs/Al x Ga 1-x As single quantum well (SQW) laser diodes were determined from the admittance spectroscopy C-V and G/Ï-V method in the temperature range of 80-360 K. In addition, the capacitance and conductance values measured under both reverse and forward bias were corrected in order to eliminate the effect of R s to obtain the real diode capacitance. - Abstract: In this study, the main electrical parameters, such as doping concentration (N D ), barrier height (Î¦ CV ), depletion layer width (W D ), series resistance (R s ) and Fermi energy level (E F ), of GaAs/Al x Ga 1-x As single quantum well (SQW) laser diodes were investigated using the admittance spectroscopy (C-V and G/Ï-V) method in the temperature range of 80-360 K. The reverse bias C -2 vs. V plots gives a straight line in a wide voltage region, especially in weak inversion region. The values of Î¦ CV at the absolute temperature (T = 0 K) and the temperature coefficient (Î±) of barrier height were found as 1.22 eV and -8.65 x 10 -4 eV/K, respectively. This value of Î± is in a close agreement with Î± of GaAs band gap (-5.45 x 10 -4 eV/K). Experimental results show that the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and conductance-voltage (G/Ï-V) characteristics of the diode are affected by not only temperature but also R s . The capacitance-voltage-temperature (C-V-T) and conductance-voltage-temperature (G/Ï-V-T) characteristics confirmed that temperature and R s of the diode have effects on the\n\nTemperature-Dependent Electrical Characteristics of Au/Si3N4/4H n-SiC MIS Diode\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYigiterol, F.; GÃ¼llÃ¼, H. H.; BayraklÄ±, Ã.; YÄ±ldÄ±z, D. E.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nElectrical characteristics of the Au/Si3N4/4H n-SiC metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) diode were investigated under the temperature, T , interval of 160-400 K using current-voltage (I-V), capacitance-voltage ( C {-} V ) and conductance-voltage ( G/Ï {-} V ) measurements. Firstly, the Schottky diode parameters as zero-bias barrier height ( Î¦_{B0} ) and ideality factor ( n ) were calculated according to the thermionic emission (TE) from forward bias I-V analysis in the whole working T . Experimental results showed that the values of Î¦_{B0} were in increasing behavior with increasing T while n values decreased with inverse proportionality in n versus Î¦_{{{{B}}0}} plot. Therefore, the non-ideal I-V behavior with inhomogeneous barrier height (BH) formation has been discussed under the assumption of Gaussian distribution (GD). From the GD of BHs, the mean BH was found to be about 1.40 eV with 0.1697 standard deviation and the modified Richardson constant A^{*} of this diode was obtained as 141.65 A/cm2 K2 in good agreement with the literature (the theoretical value of A^{*} is 137.21 A/cm2 K2). The relationship between Î¦_{B0} and n showed an abnormal I-V behavior depending on T , and it was modeled by TE theory with GD of BH due to the effect in inhomogeneous BH at the interface. Secondly, according to Cheung's model, series resistance, R_{{S}} values were calculated in the T range of 160-400 K and these values were found to decrease with increasing T . Finally, the density of interface states, D_{{it}} was calculated and the T dependence of energy distribution of D_{{it}} profiles determined the forward I {-} V measurements by taking into account the bias dependence of the effective BH, Î¦_{{e}} and n . D_{{it}} were also calculated according to the Hill-Coleman method from C {-} V and G/Ï {-} V analysis. Furthermore, the variation of D_{{it}} as a function of frequency, f and T were determined.\n\nDetermination of the temperature dependence of tungsten erosion\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMaier, H.; Greuner, H.; Toussaint, U. von; Balden, M.; BÃ¶swirth, B.; Elgeti, S.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe present the results of erosion measurements on actively cooled tungsten samples at quasi-constant surface temperature conditions performed in the high heat flux facility GLADIS. The samples were exposed to a H beam at a central power density of 10 MW/m 2 up to a fluence of 10 26 m â2 . We observe a weak temperature dependence of the erosion yield. The data are compared with similar data obtained from loading with a H beam with He admixture. Both datasets are analysed in a probabilistic approach. We obtain activation energies of 0.04 eV and 0.06 eV for the cases with and without He, respectively\n\nTemperature dependence of electron mean free path in molybdenum from ultrasonic measurements\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAlmond, D P; Detwiler, D A; Rayne, J A [Carnegie-Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, Pa. (USA)\n\n1975-09-08\n\nThe temperature dependence of the electronic mean free path in molybdenum has been obtained from ultrasonic attenuation measurements.For temperature up to 30 K a T/sup -2/ law is followed suggesting the importance of electron-electron scattering in the attenuation mechanism.\n\nTemperature-dependent Photoluminescence of Boron-doped ZnO Nanorods\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKim, Soaram; Park, Hyunggil; Nam, Giwoong; Yoon, Hyunsik; Leem, Jaeyoung [Inje Univ., Gimhae (Korea, Republic of); Kim, Jong Su; Lee, Sangheon [Yeungnam Univ., Gyeongsan (Korea, Republic of); Kim, Jin Soo [Chonbuk National Univ., Jeonju (Korea, Republic of); Son, Jeongsik [Kyungwoon Univ., Gumi (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2013-11-15\n\nBoron-doped ZnO (BZO) nanorods were grown on quartz substrates using hydrothermal synthesis, and the temperature-dependence of their photoluminescence (PL) was measured in order to investigate the origins of their PL properties. In the UV range, near-band-edge emission (NBE) was observed from 3.1 to 3.4 eV; this was attributed to various transitions including recombination of free excitons and their longitudinal optical (LO) phonon replicas, and donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination, depending on the local lattice configuration and the presence of defects. At a temperature of 12 K, the NBE produces seven peaks at 3.386, 3.368, 3.337, 3.296, 3.258, 3.184, and 3.106 eV. These peaks are, respectively, assigned to free excitons (FX), neutral-donor bound excitons (D{sup o}X), and the first LO phonon replicas of D{sup o}X, DAP, DAP-1LO, DAP-2LO, and DAP-3LO. The peak position of the FX and DAP were also fitted to Varshni's empirical formula for the variation in the band gap energy with temperature. The activation energy of FX was about â¼70 meV, while that of DAP was about â¼38 meV. We also discuss the low temperature PL near 2.251 eV, related to structural defects.\n\nExperimental investigation of the energy and temperature dependence of beryllium self sputtering\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKorshunov, S.N.; Guseva, M.I.; Stolijarova, V.G.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe low-Z metal beryllium is considered as plasma facing material (PFM) for the ITER. It is expected that operation temperature range of beryllium PFM will be (670 - 1070) K. While experimental Be-sputtering data bases exist for H + , D + and He + -ions, the self-sputtering yields of Be have only been estimated by computer simulation. In this paper we report the experimental results on the energy and temperature dependence of the beryllium self-sputtering yield (S). The energy dependence of S s in the energy range (0.5 - 10.0) keV was measured at 670 K. The self-sputtering yield of Be attains its maximal value at the ion energy of 1.5 keV, being equal to 0.32 Â± at./ion. Comparison of the experimental results and theoretical prediction shows a good agreement for energy dependence of S s . The temperature dependence of S s in the temperature range (370-1070)K was obtained for 0.9keV Be + -ions. The value of S s is not changed up to 870 K. It sharply increases at the temperatures above 870 attaining the value of 0.75 at./ion at 1070 K\n\nROTATIONâACTIVITY CORRELATIONS IN K AND M DWARFS. I.
