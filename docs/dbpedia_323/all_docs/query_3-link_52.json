        "text": "MANILA: The Philippines is bracing for more blistering weather as temperatures in the capital region rose to a record high over the weekend.\n\nUnusually hot temperatures have been recorded across South and Southeast Asia in recent days, forcing schools to close and authorities to issue health warnings.\n\nIn Metro Manila on Saturday, the mercury hit 38.8 degrees Celsius, surpassing the previous record set in 1915.\n\nElsewhere in the country, the weather has been even hotter, with Tarlac province seeing the mercury hit 40.3 degrees earlier in the year.\n\nThe hottest ever temperature recorded in the Philippines was 42.2 degrees in 1912.\n\nGlaiza Escullar of state weather agency PAGASA told Arab News it was likely that some parts of the country would continue to see temperatures of 40 degrees and above until the second week of May.\n\nMarch, April and May are typically the hottest and driest months of the year, but conditions this year have been exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon.\n\nThe heat index, which also takes into account humidity, reached 45 degrees on Saturday, which the weather agency classifies as “danger.” It said it could hit 46 degrees on Monday.\n\n“We are issuing a heat index warning just to emphasize that apart from the hot weather or high temperature, relative humidity has a factor in terms of health,” Escullar said.\n\n“If (a person) is dehydrated or he is not in a good condition, the body tends to overheat because the sweating process is slowed down by the high relative humidity.”\n\nIn response to the searing heat and a nationwide transport strike, the Department of Education announced on Sunday that all public schools would be closed on Monday and Tuesday but that classes would be held remotely.\n\nJeepney drivers are staging a three-day strike in protest at the government’s plan to phase out the iconic vehicles.\n\nMany schools in the Philippines do not have air conditioning and several were forced to close earlier this month and hold remote classes in a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHigh school student Ivan Garcia told Arab News the soaring heat was affecting his studies.\n\n“The weather is annoyingly hot … I cannot focus on doing my school work,” he said.\n\nNinth-grader Adrian Reyes said he preferred to work from home.\n\n“I usually leave the house around noontime and it’s really a challenge especially for me and others like me who have to commute to get to school,” he said.\n\n“I prefer the asynchronous mode of learning because we have aircon at home.”\n\nJAKARTA: Indonesian President Joko Widodo held on Monday his first Cabinet meeting in the country’s new capital of Nusantara, showing the latest progress in the ambitious $33 billion megaproject just a few months before the end of his presidency.\n\nWidodo formally launched the capital relocation project in 2019, in what has been widely viewed as an attempt to seal his legacy before the end of his second and final term in October.\n\nThe outgoing leader has been working since late July from the city, located in the East Kalimantan province on Borneo island, which will hold its first Indonesian Independence Day celebration in less than a week.\n\n“The Nusantara capital is a canvas that carves the future. Not all countries have the opportunity and the ability to build their capital city starting from zero,” Widodo told his ministers during a livestreamed meeting held in the massive, eagle-shaped new state palace.\n\n“Nusantara is developed with a forest city concept, a city filled with greenery. It is not a concrete city or city of glass. It is also a smart city, supported by technology across all the city’s activities, and a livable city.”\n\nLocated more than 1,200 km away from the current capital Jakarta, the move to Nusantara was intended to ease the burden on the old center of government, which faces chronic traffic congestion, overpopulation, and heavy pollution and is one of the world’s fastest-sinking cities.\n\nIt is also aimed at redistributing wealth across Indonesia, as Java, the island on which Jakarta is located, is home to around 56 percent of the country’s population and nearly 60 percent of economic activity. The relocation process is scheduled for completion by 2045.\n\nWidodo said investors have so far committed about IDR 56.2 trillion ($3.53 billion) in investments across various projects, including in transportation, housing and education. Last month, Widodo secured a deal to involve Dubai’s financial hub in developing Nusantara’s financial center.\n\nThe government expects to cover only 20 percent of the planned $33 billion budget, relying heavily on private sector investment to build key infrastructure and public facilities. The government launched new capital incentives earlier this month in a bid to lure investment, including granting land rights of up to 190 years.\n\nAs construction of Nusantara only began in mid-2022, buildings in the new city are still unfinished, with the new state palace about 88 percent complete while several ministry buildings are usable only on their lower levels.\n\nThe project, which is using land carved out of Borneo’s jungle, has also faced criticisms from environmentalists and indigenous communities, who have previously warned that the new capital was rushed without consultation.\n\nSpeaking to the press alongside Widodo, Indonesia’s President-Elect and Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto vowed to continue work on the new capital after he takes office on Oct. 20.\n\n“Construction is ongoing and it should continue, and we should even speed it up, if possible,” Subianto said.\n\n“We will definitely finish it, although the outline plan is dozens of years long, like other capital cities also took a very long time. We should not force it, but I am optimistic that in five years, I think, it will function very well.”\n\nPARIS: France bid a reluctant farewell on Monday to an “enchanted” fortnight of Olympic sport as athletes headed home from Paris praising a dazzling edition of the Games that has breathed new life into the biggest show on earth.\n\nHollywood star Tom Cruise delivered stardust at the closing ceremony on Sunday evening — and a link with the next Games in Los Angeles — by abseiling into the national stadium.\n\nThe “Mission Impossible” star descended on a wire in front of 71,500 spectators, grabbed the Olympic flag and jumped onto a motorbike, to the delight of thousands of dancing athletes and awe-struck fans.\n\nThe final act of the Paris Olympics brought relief that an event foreshadowed by worries about terror attacks, strikes or protests had passed off with barely a hitch.\n\nBut there was also sadness that two weeks of high-spirited celebration had come to an end.\n\n“Keep the flame alive,” urged the front-page headline of France’s biggest sports newspaper, L’Equipe, which featured new national swimming hero Leon Marchand and urged French people to maintain the spirit “of this enchanted fortnight.”\n\nAt the Athletes’ Village in northern Paris, bleary-eyed athletes were packing their bags after a late night, with the French capital’s two main airports braced for a huge influx of travelers and sports equipment.\n\nMagda Skarbonkiewicz, a Team USA fencer, said she would return home filled with memories of competing inside the Grand Palais, one of the historic venues used around the French capital.\n\n“It’s such an iconic venue and just nothing like I’ve ever seen before,” she told AFP. “It’s amazing to see so many people care about fencing the way the French people do.”\n\nDuring Sunday night’s closing ceremony, which stressed the Olympics’ core message of peace and cooperation, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach had praised the Paris Games for being “sport at its best.”\n\n“These were sensational Olympic Games from start to finish,” Bach said. “Or dare I say: Seine-sational Games,” the IOC chief quipped in a pun about the river flowing through Paris which was a sometimes fickle star of the event.\n\nObservers had seen Paris 2024 as essential for the Olympics brand as a whole, coming after a Covid-affected edition in Tokyo and a corruption-tainted version in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nAround 9,000 athletes flooded into the Stade de France on Sunday night for a show that featured music from French electro act Air, guitar band Phoenix, Belgian singer Angele and the Cambodian rapper VannDa.\n\n“We knew you would be brilliant, but you were magic,” Paris 2024 organizing chief Tony Estanguet told the crowd during a triumphalist speech.\n\nHe said the Games had transformed “a nation of implacable complainers” into “unbridled supporters who don’t want to stop singing.”\n\nMuch of the media commentary has focused on the uplifting impact of the Games on the generally morose national mood.\n\nJust weeks before the Olympics, snap elections called by President Emmanuel Macron delivered a hung parliament and a historic number of seats for the far-right National Rally party.\n\n“The Paris Games offered the capital and the entire country more than two weeks of fervor and happiness that were so unexpected and appreciated given that they came after a political period dominated by the sad passions of decline and xenophobia,” said an editorial in Le Monde newspaper.\n\n“For 17 days the stereotype of the indifferent, grumpy Frenchman went missing,” wrote sports writer Owen Slot in The Times newspaper, adding that Paris had “made the Olympic Games look more beautiful than ever before.”\n\nThe closing spectacle marked the beginning of the four-year countdown to the LA Games, and American gymnastics icon Simone Biles joined Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass as the Olympic flag was formally handed over.\n\nThe ceremony followed 17 days of drama-filled sporting action lit up by Biles, American sprinter Noah Lyles, Pakistan’s javelin king Arshad Nadeem and casual Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec, who has become an Internet sensation.\n\nThey also featured a damaging gender row about two female boxers, Imane Khelif of Algeria and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, who both went on to win gold.\n\nThe last day of sporting action saw the United States pip China for top spot in the battle for medals after the US women’s basketball team squeezed past France 67-66 to clinch the last gold of the Games.\n\nThe win — the eighth consecutive Olympic women’s basketball title won by the USA — ensured the Americans finished level with China on 40 golds each.\n\nThe USA however finished on top of the overall medal table with a total of 126 medals, with China in second place on 91.\n\nDHAKA: Bangladeshi police resumed patrols of the capital Dhaka on Monday, ending a weeklong strike that left a law and order vacuum following the abrupt ouster of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.\n\nOfficers vanished from the streets of the sprawling megacity of 20 million people last week after Hasina’s resignation and flight abroad ended her 15-year rule.\n\nPolice were loathed for spearheading a lethal crackdown on the weeks of protests that forced her departure, with 42 officers among the more than 450 people killed.\n\nPolice had vowed not to resume work until their safety on duty was guaranteed, but they agreed to return after late-night talks with the new interim government, helmed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.\n\n“It’s good to be back,” assistant commissioner Snehasish Das said while standing at a busy intersection directing traffic.\n\n“As we feel secure now, we are back on duty.”\n\nStudent-led protests against Hasina’s government had been largely peaceful until police attempted to violently disperse them.\n\nAround 450 of the country’s 600 police stations were targeted in arson and vandalism attacks over the past month, according to the national police union.\n\nSome began reopening late last week under guard by the army, an institution held in higher esteem for largely refusing to participate in the crackdown.\n\nIn the police’s absence, the students who led the protests that toppled Hasina volunteered to restore law and order after looting and reprisal attacks in the hours after her departure.\n\nThey acted as traffic wardens, formed overnight neighborhood watch patrols and guarded Hindu temples and other places of worship, quickly settling the unrest.\n\nDas said there was “no tension” between police and the students who had been performing their duties.\n\n“Students have done a tremendous job in the past few days,” he added. “Our thanks to them.”\n\nThe volunteers, for their part, said they were relieved to yield back their responsibilities.\n\n“It’s too difficult for us to manage the vehicles,” Chanu Abdullah, 27, said. “I’m really thankful the police came back.”\n\nYunus’s de facto cabinet now administering the country said it had noted with “grave concern” some attacks on Hindus and other minorities.\n\nIn its first official statement on Sunday night, the cabinet said it would work to “find ways to resolve such heinous attacks.”\n\nBangladeshi Hindus account for around eight percent of the country’s 170 million people and have regularly been the targets of violence during periods of upheaval.\n\nHundreds have arrived on India’s border since last week, asking to cross.\n\nThe leadership of Jamaat, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, said it would meet with representatives of the Hindu community and other minority leaders later Monday in a bid to ease tensions.\n\nHasina, 76, fled by helicopter to neighboring India a week ago as protesters flooded Dhaka’s streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure.\n\nHer government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents.\n\nBut new home minister Sakhawat Hossain said the government had no intention of banning Hasina’s Awami League party, which played a pivotal role in the country’s independence movement.\n\n“The party has made many contributions to Bangladesh — we don’t deny this,” he told reporters.\n\n“When the election comes, (they should) contest the elections.”\n\nInterim leader Yunus returned from Europe on Thursday to head a temporary administration facing the monumental challenge of steering democratic reforms.\n\nThe 84-year-old won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.\n\nHe took office as “chief adviser” to a caretaker administration — all fellow civilians bar Hossain, a retired brigadier-general — and has said he wants to hold elections “within a few months.”\n\nThe Daesh group has claimed a bombing on a minibus that killed one person and wounded 11 in a Shiite-dominated neighborhood of the Afghan capital.\n\nThe jihadist group said on its Telegram channel late Sunday that “one Shiite was killed in a bombing by Caliphate soldiers in the Afghan capital.”\n\nKabul police said on Sunday the blast occurred in a western Kabul neighborhood home to many Shiite Muslims, a historically persecuted minority in Afghanistan and a frequent target of the Daesh group that considers them heretics.\n\nItalian nongovernmental organization Emergency NGO, which operates a hospital in Kabul, said on social media platform X that it had received eight people wounded in the blast, with seven in need of surgery and one “in a serious condition.”\n\nThe number of deadly bomb blasts and suicide attacks in Afghanistan has declined markedly since the Taliban ended their insurgency after seizing power in August 2021. However, a number of armed groups, including Daesh-Khorasan, remain a threat.\n\nDaesh-Khorasan, or Daesh-K, is the group’s Afghanistan branch, “Khorasan” referring to a historical region that included parts of Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia.\n\nThe group also claimed an attack targeting tourists in Afghanistan in May that killed six people, including three foreigners.\n\nIt has also claimed responsibility for an attack on a Moscow concert hall in March that killed 145 people.\n\nA UN counter-terrorism official warned this month that Daesh-K poses the greatest external terrorist threat to Europe, having “improved its financial and logistical capabilities in the past six months.”\n\nChief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the concerns raised were “driven by propaganda” and that the group had been “significantly weakened” in Afghanistan.\n\n“The Islamic Emirate (of Afghanistan) does not allow anyone to use Afghan soil against the security of any other country or to pose threats from Afghanistan,” he wrote on X."
