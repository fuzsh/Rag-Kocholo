        "text": "Seventy-five years ago today, area residents were saying goodbye to the hottest month on record — then and now. The heat wave of 1936 included an unbroken stretch of 14 days — July 4-17 — with temperature reaching 100 or more degrees. For the entire month, the average high was a jaw-dropping 99.8 degrees.\n\nDuring the summer of 1936, North America experienced a heat wave the likes of which has not been matched in modern history. In addition to the heat, much of the continent suffered moderate to extreme drought conditions, best exemplified by the Dust Bowl of the southern Great Plains. Needless to say, this meteorologically wrought misery occurred in the midst of the Great Depression, so for many hard-pressed Americans, it was a matter of “out of the frying pan and into the (figurative — though not by much!) fire.”\n\nSaturday, July 11, was a typical day during the heat wave. It reached 104 degrees by noon, a high of 109 by 4 p.m., and didn’t return to double digits until 7 p.m. It’s nearly impossible for us to relate to the torment felt by nearly everyone back then, since at the time most stores, office buildings and hospitals — to say nothing of homes and factories — lacked air conditioning, meaning folks heated up and stayed hot all day, with little prospect of relief.\n\nThus deaths from sunstroke and heat exhaustion were inevitable, and it just wasn’t the elderly at risk. On Friday, July 10, for example, middle-aged farmhand Henry Carlson, working on the John Murray farm two miles north of Gridley, died of “heat prostration” on the way to the afternoon meal. That weekend Bloomington reported at least five deaths related to the heat.\n\nMeetings were cancelled, ice dealers worked overtime, children congregated around open fire hydrants, transients were found dazed or unconscious, and the Bloomington Fire Department handled a record number of alarms, many of which were grass fires. At the McLean County Jail, prisoners were freed from their overheated cells and allowed to sleep in the adjacent corridor.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThis long, hot summer comes to life in the daily entries of carpenter and handyman Charles Morgan, a Bloomington resident who kept a series of journals (now held by the McLean County Museum of History) for most of his adult life. “A blazing sun makes existing a torture,” Morgan recorded July 11. “We all swelter in the terrific heat,” he wrote the following day. “People lay around everywhere”— backyards, benches, parks—“anywhere to keep cool.”\n\nIn an era before public pools, Lake Bloomington, Miller Park, Anglers Club, Shalain Park (now State Farm Park) and Lakeside Country Club offered some relief, though many local swimming holes betrayed their origins as clay pits for brick and tile works by offering tepid, less-than-invigorating water.\n\nAt the Guy Hilton farm outside Bloomington, wife Lena found the oven-like temperatures had cooked a barn lot egg to soft-boiled perfection. In the city, East Washington Street homeowners Roy and Margaret Stanger and boarders Abby Jolly and Caroline Morrison escaped stifling bedrooms for a small stretch of flat roof and a hoped-for breeze. Since Jolly was a sleepwalker, they tied one of her ankles a post to keep her from “stalking off the edge.” Just a few blocks away downtown, Justice of the Peace A.M. Campbell and constables William Peterson and Edgar R. Anderson jerry-rigged a primitive air conditioner by blowing an electric fan across a galvanized washtub filled with 100 pounds of block ice.\n\nThe intense heat made some poor souls senseless, as was the tragic case of Dr. O.A. Kyle. On July 14, the Bloomington veterinarian drove his automobile into a ditch on the city’s far west side. He had no idea where he was or what he was doing, and by the time he was taken to St. Joseph’s Hospital his temperature was 108.5 degrees. He died shortly thereafter.\n\nOn July 15, it reached 114 degrees in Bloomington, which 75 years later remains the city’s all-time high. At a Funk Bros. Seed Co. corn breeding plot near Shirley, it was hotter yet — 115 degrees. Both temperatures were recorded by “government thermometer” stations run by J.W. Hardin, a weather observer with the USDA.\n\nYet a week-and-a-half later, the worst of the hot weather was over. On Saturday, July 25, the area received three-quarters of an inch of rain. Cool temperatures arrived the evening of July 29, and the following morning the thermometer dipped to a lovely low of 55 degrees.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n1\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n2\n\nAngry\n\n3\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
