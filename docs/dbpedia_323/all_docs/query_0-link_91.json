        "text": "Welcome to Moodie Davitt Pax Index, a regularly-updated feed featuring the latest passenger traffic results from airports around the world as the figures are announced.\n\n19 MARCH\n\nUK. Edinburgh Airport saw a small -0.4% year-on-year drop in February passengers to 935,455. The airport has warned that it is predicting a period of zero or close-to-zero passenger demand in the near future because of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n18 MARCH\n\nSPAIN. February traffic at Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport was up +6% year-on-year, as 4.4 million passengers were handled by the airport. The figures were announced by AENA, the operator of Spain’s major public airports. The airports across AENA’s network handled more than 16.9 million passengers during the month, a +4% year-on-year increase.\n\n17 MARCH\n\nNETHERLANDS. A total of 4.7 million passengers travelled to, from or via Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in February 2020, a -2.6% drop year-on-year. Asian traffic was down -31.6% compared to February 2019 at 249,600. In its forward-looking outlook, the airport said traffic would be further impacted in March.\n\n16 MARCH\n\nSINGAPORE. Singapore Changi Airport handled 3.45 million passengers in February 2020, a decrease of -32.8% compared to the same period last year as the COVID-19 crisis escalated. Traffic to major travel markets declined across the board, including China (-92%), Hong Kong (-75%), South Korea (-46%), Taiwan (-38%) and Thailand (-33%).\n\nFRANCE. Passenger traffic at Paris’ two major airports climbed marginally in February, with Paris Charles de Gaulle handling 5.1 million travellers (+0.1%) and Paris Orly 2.2 million (+1.3%). However, March figures show a sharp fall to date, with traffic down -29% in the first two weeks.\n\nIn February, Chinese traffic plummeted -71.4% at the two airports, however, although US volumes leapt by +9.3% in the period. These markets make up 1.4% and 6.9% respectively of the total Paris Aéroport market but the Chinese retail spend is disproportionately higher.\n\nBy region, Asia Pacific traffic fell -28.1% in the month, but other regions grew: North America (+10.8%), the Middle East (+7.8%), Africa (+6.2%), the French Overseas Territories (+5.0%) and Latin America (+1.4%).\n\n15 MARCH\n\nHONG KONG. Passenger traffic at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) fell by -68% year-on-year in February, to 1.9 million, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nFor the first two months of this year, HKIA handled 7.6 million passengers, a year-on-year decrease of -38.5%.\n\nThe combined decline of passenger volume in January and February was mainly caused by a 63% year-on-year slump in visitor traffic.\n\nAirport Authority Hong Kong said: “Passenger traffic was particularly impacted in February due to weak travelling demand amid the outbreak of COVID-19, in addition to immigration restrictions and quarantine measures implemented by authorities in different countries and regions.\n\n“Traffic to and from Mainland China and Southeast Asia recorded the most significant decreases in the month. It is expected to see continued drop in traffic figures in March as airlines have suspended more flights, and authorities in different markets continue to implement immigration restrictions and quarantine measures.”\n\n12 MARCH\n\nGERMANY. Frankfurt Airport recorded a -4.0% decline in passenger numbers to 4.4 million in February. For the first two months of 2020, accumulated passenger traffic decreased by -2.3%. Demand was strongly impacted by the coronavirus outbreak in the last week of February (24 February to 1 March), with passenger volumes declining -14.5%. That negative trend accelerated in the first week of March. Weather-related flight cancellations due to Storm Ciara (named ‘Sabine’ in Germany) further impacted traffic in February.\n\nPassenger traffic within Germany, which fell by -10.8% in February 2020, was hit particularly hard by weakening demand. Intercontinental traffic also contracted by -2.3% with growth on North American and North African routes unable to offset the “massive reduction” in flight offerings to/from China and other Asian destinations. Without the positive effect of the extra leap day, passenger numbers would have declined by -7.2% in the month.\n\nMALAYSIA. There was a sharp decline in February traffic at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The airport handled 3.65 million passengers, a -24.2% year-on-year fall. This large decline was consistent across international and domestic travel, down -25.7% and -20.5% respectively. The airport said the impact was felt as soon as China imposed a lockdown on certain provinces and COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nAUSTRIA. Vienna Airport said there was limited COVID-19 impact on its February traffic, which was up +8.3% year-on-year at 2,017,461. However, the airport said passenger figures for early March are down -30% compared to March 2019 as the outbreak begins to hit European airports.\n\n11 MARCH\n\nSWITZERLAND. Zürich Airport handled 2.01 million passengers in February, down by -1.2% year-on-year, and a solid result considering the COVID-19-affected travel environment. European traffic was marginally down (-0.6%), offsetting a sharper -2.7% fall in long-haul traffic. As with many European airports, March numbers are likely to tell a different story.\n\nDENMARK. COVID-19 is beginning to have a profound effect on Copenhagen Airport. The Danish gateway first felt the impact of the outbreak in February as passenger volumes fell slightly on last year, reaching almost two million. The impact of the crisis has deepened in March with passenger traffic slumping by close to one third during the first ten days of the month.\n\nA total of 1,987,766 passengers travelled through Copenhagen Airport in February, a decline of -0.4%. However, with 2019 being a leap year, February had 29 days. Adjusted for the extra day, the decline was -3.7%.\n\nThe main casualties were passenger volumes related to long-haul intercontinental routes out of Europe, resulting from considerably fewer departures and lower demand on departures to and from Asia. Towards the end of February, short-haul European routes were also affected, and in early March that trend has sharply accelerated.\n\n“During the first ten days of March, the number of departures and travellers in and out of Denmark have dropped by one third,” said Copenhagen Airport CEO Thomas Woldbye. “This is something we’ve never seen before. The situation is developing much faster and more dramatically than what happened during the financial crisis, after 9/11, the ash cloud and any other event that has impacted on aviation since the Second World War.\n\n“The crisis will impact not only airlines and airports. It will also affect large parts of the business community. For example, 32 per cent of Danish exports by value is moved via air freight. The crisis has also been a major blow to the experience economy, impacting hotels, cultural events and venues as well as restaurants.\n\n“There are much fewer tourists and business people flying to Denmark these days and the effect is really noticeable. In Denmark, many people have cancelled their trips, and the drop in demand has made the airlines cancel more and more departures and arrivals,” said Woldbye. He warned that the crisis may have long-lasting and damaging consequences for the country.\n\n“We have to make sure that fear doesn’t overtake common sense,” he continued. Fortunately, the Danish government and the rest of parliament are very concerned with tackling the current health crisis, and they are also making every effort to prevent the situation from becoming a full-blown economic crisis. Businesses, the government and the labour market must join forces and work to curb the impact of the crisis and steer the country through it, limiting the damage as much as possible and preparing the country for when the Corona crisis subsides.”\n\nCANADA. Total traffic at Vancouver International Airport was down slightly year-on-year in January. The airport authority says 2,021,535 passengers used the airport during the month, a drop of -0.3% compared to January 2019.\n\nUK. Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s key travel retail locations, today reported a -4.8% decline in February passenger numbers to 5.4 million (after adjusting for the 2020 leap day), due to lower demand on Asian and European routes. Demand has continued to weaken going into March and Heathrow expects a further year-on-year decrease in coming weeks.\n\nHeathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said: “The threat of Coronavirus is an increasing challenge for the UK and we are working day and night to ensure Britain’s front door is open and safe for our people and passengers. We will continue to work with the Government to limit the impacts this will have on UK plc.”\n\n10 MARCH\n\nAUSTRALIA. Total passenger traffic at Sydney Airport was down -9.3% year-on-year in February to 3.1 million. Sydney Airport CEO Geoff Culbert said: “Like our airline partners, we are also experiencing the financial impacts of the coronavirus. There is a direct link between passenger arrivals and departures and our aeronautical revenues, so we share the pain of every flight cancellation. Everyone in the aviation and tourism industry is hurting and we are in discussions with all of our partners about the best way to support each other during this period.”\n\nFor the first nine days of March, provisional data indicates a -25% decrease in international passenger traffic and a -6% decrease in domestic passenger traffic at Australia’s busiest airport.\n\nBELGIUM. The COVID-19 outbreak had a limited impact on passenger numbers at Brussels Airport for February as traffic for the month grew +6% year-on-year to 1,738,988. However, the airport put this in perspective, saying the leap year and the Spring break for Belgian schools moving forward to February from March positively impacted performance for the month. Brussels Airport Company CEO Arnaud Feist said: “The aviation industry is going through difficult times. Brussels Airport’s performance during the month of February fell below the forecasts as result of the impact of the coronavirus. With numerous flights cancelled, the effects will be felt more severely in the months of March and April.”\n\n8 MARCH\n\nGERMANY. Traffic across the two Berlin airports – Schönefeld and Tegel – was down -10.2% year-on-year in February.\n\nAt Tegel Airport, there were 1,538,758 passengers (-9.3%) and Schönefeld had 741,290 passengers (-11.9%). Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg (FBB) CEO Engelbert Lütke Daldrup commented: “It is not yet clear whether, and to what extent, the worldwide spread of the coronavirus has so far affected the development of air traffic in the capital city region.\n\n“Cancellations of major events such as the ITB, as well as the cancellation of flights by airlines, will influence the development in the coming weeks and months. What is clear, however, is that the development of passenger numbers throughout the entire year and the achievement of the FBB’s economic goals will depend on the further progression of the pandemic.”\n\n6 MARCH\n\nGREECE. Athens International Airport reported that February traffic grew +2.8% year-on-year to 1,364,450, down from a +5.7% increase in January. While the airport was not heavily impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak in the first two months (year-to-date traffic for the period rose +4.3%), March numbers may tell a very different story.\n\n5 MARCH\n\nLATIN AMERICA. Traffic across Aeropuertos del Sureste’s (ASUR) portfolio of Mexican, Colombian and Puerto Rican airports grew +12.7% year-on-year in February 2020 to 4,687,426. The busiest airport operated by ASUR, Cancún International Airport, saw traffic increase +7.4% compared to February 2019 to 2,913,166.\n\nIRELAND. Just over 2.1 million passengers travelled through Dublin Airport in January, a +2% increase compared to 2019. Passenger volumes to and from Continental Europe increased +2%, UK traffic was up +1% and North America increased +4%, but other international traffic declined by -10%.\n\n4 MARCH\n\nUS. Charlotte Douglas International Airport passed the 50 million passenger mark for the first time in 2019. A total of 50,168,783 passengers used the North Carolina airport during the year, a +8% year-on-year increase. “Reaching 50 million passengers is a huge milestone for the airport,” said Charlotte Douglas International Airport Aviation Director/CEO Brent Cagle. “It’s the biggest jump in passenger traffic we’ve had since 2010, which shows our tremendous growth just within the past year.”\n\n3 MARCH\n\nJORDAN. Queen Alia International Airport received 679,791 passengers in January, a +3.9% increase year-on-year. Airport International Group CEO Nicolas Claude said: “As the January results kickstart our year on a high note, we are pleased to see the collective efforts of our employees, partners and shareholders come to fruition, adding a new success to our impressive track record.”\n\nUS. In its traffic report for January 2020, Boston Logan International Airport said total traffic was up +8.5% year-on-year at 2,940,985. The increase compared to January 2019 came from both domestic (+7.9%) and international (+11.2%) travel.\n\nUS. Passenger traffic at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport reached a record high of 36,769,279 in 2019, a +4.3% year-on-year increase.
