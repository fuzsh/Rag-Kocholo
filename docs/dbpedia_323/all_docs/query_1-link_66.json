        "text": "Based on the criterion adopted (t ≤ t av. − 2σ), a total of 103 ECWs were identified in 18 years of the 60-year period between 1951 and 2010 (Table 1).\n\nECWs were recorded by all the stations, with their number ranging from 1 to 3 per station and reaching 4 at 3 stations only (Table 1); in southern and western Europe, their number tended to be 1–2, whereas the equivalent figure was 2–3 in Northern and Eastern Europe. Isolated cases of large differences between neighbouring stations are perhaps attributable to local circumstances. Overall, the largest number of ECWs recorded in Northern and Eastern Europe is explained by a greater degree of climatic continentalism in these regions entailing much colder winters than those recorded in maritime climates of the southern and western parts of the continent. The number of ECWs and EMWs found at individual stations (3 ± 2) differed from their normal distribution (ca. 5 % or 3). The difference is explained by the fact that as a natural phenomenon, the wintertime distribution of average daily temperature does not follow the normal distribution pattern. Indeed, it is to be expected that a single case of an extremely high or low average temperature may occur thus significantly altering the standard deviation and, consequently, the number of anomalous values identified.\n\nThe highest frequency of ECWs was observed in the decade 1960/1961–1969/1970 (Table 2)—the period saw 6 out of the 18 ECWs and nearly half of the cases (48 out of 103). This decade saw the ECW with the widest coverage (24 stations) in 1962/1963. Even though the decade 1980/1981–1989/1990 ranked second in terms of the number of ECWs (4 ECWs, 15 cases), it was the 9-year period 1951/1952–1959/1960 that ranked second in terms of the number of cases (3 ECWs, 28 cases). The 1953/1954 season of the 9-year period recorded the ECW ranking second in terms of coverage (16 stations), but ranking first in terms of the negative air temperature anomaly. Both the frequency of ECWs and the number of cases clearly declined after 1990. Between 1986/1987 and 2009/2010, there were only three ECWs over very limited areas (1–3 stations).\n\nEMWs were much less frequent than ECWs (Table 2) and in the six decades under study, there were altogether 40 EMWs recorded in 13 years. Other researchers also confirm the lower frequency of EMWs compared to ECWs (Dobrovolný et al. 2010). EMWs were recorded by only half of the stations (30) in western and Southern Europe and in its northernmost and easternmost territories. There were no EMWs in the decade 1970/1971–1979/1980 or strictly speaking, between 1966/1967 and 1981/1982. The frequency of EMWs started to increase from the end of the 1980s. Half of the EMWs occurred in the last 20 years of the 60-year period, but among the 22 seasons between 1988/1989 and 2009/2010, as many as nine were EMWs, with the 2006/2007 EMW covering that largest territory in the 60-year period (11 stations).\n\nAs can be seen, the number of thermally anomalous winters differs across Europe. This is attributable to the differences in temperature of the air masses carried into Europe in winter. These can be relatively warm maritime polar air masses (mP) and strongly cooled continental polar (cP) or Arctic (A) air masses. The overall predominance of western circulation causes the former (mP) to occur more frequently, in particular over Western and Central Europe, leading to mild winters with temperatures above average but not changing much over time. Meanwhile, the predominance of cP and A leads to very sharp periodic falls in temperature to much below the average. Thus, the statistical distribution of the average temperature in winter is asymmetrical and very large negative deviations are offset by a larger number of more moderate positive deviations, which means that the number of anomalies on both “tails” is different (Dobrovolný et al. 2010). The asymmetry grows eastwards (Fig. 1). This results not only in a higher frequency of ECWs than EMWs but also in greater values of extreme negative anomalies than positive ones, e.g. in the belt stretching between Valentia and Yekaterinburg, they ranged from −2.6 and +1.6 to −8.0 and +4.3 °C. This asymmetry also means that there are more EMWs with no EMMs (due to an accumulation of slight monthly anomalies) than ECWs with no ECMs (due to a higher contribution of very low temperatures in a single month to the average temperature for winter as a whole). It should be noted that the non-symmetry is much more pronounced for individual winter months: The 60-year period saw twice as many ECMs (67) as EMWs (34).\n\nAs mentioned above, most of the ECWs (82.5 %) saw exceptionally cold months (ECMs), and in extreme cases, all 3 months were ECMs. By contrast, the EMWs were characterised by less frequent exceptionally mild months (EMMs).\n\nOver the 60 years under study, two winters proved to be ECWs and EMWs at the same time. They were the winters of 1965/1966 which was an ECW in the Scandinavian Peninsula (7 stations) and an EMW in the southeasternmost parts of Europe (3 stations), and that of 1997/1998 which was an ECW in the northeast in Naryan-Mar and an EMW in 3 disparate stations in the west and north of Europe (Tables 3 and 4).\n\nThe years with ECWs and EMWs, as well as the number of the stations with their codes (as listed in Table 1), are shown in Tables 3 and 4 (Calendars of ECWs and EMWs). As mentioned above, ECWs were recorded in 18 years over areas varying in size, i.e. by different numbers of stations—from 1 to 24. However, for the most part, ECWs were recorded by only a single station or by two neighbouring stations; there were seven such winters (Table 3). Those winters which were recorded by 1–2 stations, i.e. fewer than 5 % of all the stations, will be disregarded in this study. The analysis will focus on those winters that were recorded concurrently by at least three stations, i.e. by at least 5 % of the stations). There were 11 such ECWs.\n\nEMWs were identified in 13 years. Most of them were also only recorded by 1 or 2 stations (7 EMWs in total), even though not always by neighbouring ones. As it turned out, there were cases when ECWs were observed by stations distant from each other—three or even more altogether.\n\nThis study will focus on those EMWs that were recorded by at least three stations in the same part of Europe. There were four such EMWs. The one covering the largest area was recorded by 11 stations (Table 4).\n\nThe characteristics of the ECWs and EMWs described in this study comprise their location in Europe and the indicative area covered, number of stations, average air temperature and degree of anomaly (i.e. air temperature deviation from the corresponding multi-annual average), as well as the average maximum and minimum temperatures and the number of days with a minimum temperature below 0 °C and maximum temperature below 0, −10 and −20 °C.\n\n4.1 Exceptionally cold winters\n\nThe ECW of 1953/1954 was the winter with the second largest coverage (16 stations) and with the greatest negative air temperature anomaly in the 60-year period (the coldest winter in the study area). The winter covered the area of Southeastern Europe (Fig. 2), stretching from Belgrade and Debrecen in the west to Kazan and Orenburg in the east and from the Black Sea and foreland of the Caucasus in the south to Kazan in the north. For most of the stations, January and/or February were exceptionally cold months (ECMs) plus December in the southernmost area (3 ECMs in Istanbul and Simferopol). The temperature anomaly Δt in 5 southern stations exceeded 3 standard deviations; everywhere, except for Sochi, it exceeded −4 °C, reaching −5 to −7.0 °C in the east and −8.6 °C in Rostov-on-Don. It was the greatest negative winter temperature anomaly in the years 1951–2010 in Europe and one of 5 cases when the negative anomaly exceeded −8 °C (Table 5). The entire area saw days with 24-h temperatures below −10 °C (approx. 30 more than on average in the central and eastern parts) and in the east even below −20.0 °C.\n\nThe ECW of 1955/1956 covered the area of northeastern Europe, where it was recorded by ten stations (Fig. 2). It may be presumed that the area of the ECW was not much larger than during the winter 2 years previous to it whereby the clearly lower number of weather stations resulted from the lowest density of the network of stations in that part of Europe. The ECW was recorded by stations from Kursk and Saratov in the south to Saint Petersburg and Ivdel in the north, as well as in Vardö, and from Saint Petersburg in the west to Ivdel and Yekaterinburg in the east. December and February were ECMs. Everywhere, except for Vardö, the temperature anomaly Δt was greater than −5.0 °C, exceeding −7.0 °C in the north and reaching its highest value in Vologda where it was −8.2 °C. In Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Vologda and Kazan, it was the coldest winter in the six decades (Table 5). The entire area, except for Vardö, saw days with 24-h temperatures below −20.0 °C; they were more numerous than on average, between 10 days in Saint Petersburg and 25 days in Ivdel.\n\nUnlike the ECW discussed above, the ECW of 1962/1963 was recorded in Western Europe by a record number of 24 stations, from Madrid to Rome in the south to Edinburgh and Bergen in the north and from La Coruña and Valentia in the west to Warsaw, Chernivtsi and Sofia in the east (Fig. 2). January was an ECM at nearly all locations. In the northwest, December and/or February were also exceptionally cold months; three ECMs were recorded in Paris, Würzburg and De Bilt. The only areas with no ECM were the Iberian Peninsula and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nEven though most of the temperature anomalies in the northeast of the continent reached three standard deviations (t ≥ t av. + 3σ), the absolute value of anomalies was lower than for the above ECWs in the east of Europe with Δt usually ranging between ca. −2.0 and −5.0 °C and its highest value recorded in Warsaw Δt = −6.7 °C (Table 5). Western Europe owes its lower negative air temperature anomalies in winter to the mitigating effect of the waters of the Atlantic Ocean (Hirschi and Sinha 2007), in contrast to the cooled land in central, and even more so, Eastern Europe which is largely responsible for the significant falls in air temperature. Over most of the area, the winter of 1962/63 was the coldest in all the 60 years and was the only anomalously cold winter in the south and west, even though the average temperature in the southern- and westernmost areas remained above zero.\n\nThe ECW of 1963/1964 was observed by three stations in Central Europe: in Vienna, Debrecen and Belgrade. December and January were ECMs. The temperature anomalies ranged between −3.9 °C in Vienna and −5.4 °C in Debrecen (the latter experienced its coldest winter in the six decades).\n\nThe ECW of 1965/1966 covered the Scandinavian Peninsula (7 stations; Fig. 3). In most cases, February was an ECM, with no ECM recorded by the southern stations. It was the coldest winter in the area, with the temperature anomaly Δt between −3.0 °C in Vardö and −7.5 °C in Vaasa (Table 5). In the northern, inner part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, there was not a single winter day when the maximum temperature exceeded 0 °C, with more than 20 days recording 24-h air temperatures below −20 °C (fewer than 10 days on average).\n\nThe ECW of 1968/1969 covered the easternmost areas of Europe (8 stations) and Minsk (Fig. 3). January and December were ECMs in Ivdel and Yekaterinburg. The air temperature anomaly Δt was higher than −5.0 °C across the stations, exceeding −8.0 °C in Pechora and Orenburg (Δt = −8.1 and −8.2 °C, respectively). It was the coldest winter in the 60 years for nearly all the stations. The average temperature of −25.4 °C in Pechora was the lowest of all the cases studied here (Table 5) Here too maximum temperatures remained below −20.0 °C for over half the days in that winter (20 days on average). Such a strong decline in air temperature in the area was due to a block caused by a ridge of high pressure over western Russia (Hirschi and Sinha 2007).\n\nThe ECW of 1969/1970 was observed by four stations in central Europe: in Berlin, Warsaw, Stockholm and Liepāja. December was an ECM and February too, but only in Stockholm. The temperature anomaly Δt ranged between −4.6 °C in Vienna and −5.6 °C in Liepāja. In the weather stations on the Baltic Sea, it was the coldest winter in the 60-year period.\n\nThe ECW of 1978/1979 was recorded by six stations in the north of Europe: De Bilt and Bergen, Liepāja and Arkhangelsk, Syktyvkar and Pechora. In the last four stations, December was the ECM. Given the high latitudinal span of the ECW, the thermal conditions within its coverage differed greatly: in the westernmost areas, the average air temperature was approx. −1.0 °C (Δt −3.0 to −4.0 °C), and in the easternmost ones, it was lower than −20.0 °C (anomaly Δt −7.0 to −8.0 °C). In the west, there were only 30 days with 24-h temperatures below zero, whereas in the east they were recorded throughout the winter; often, there were days with maximum temperatures below −20.0 °C. For Pechora, it was one of the two coldest winters in the 60 years, with the temperature reaching −25.4 °C on average, i.e. as low as during the winter of 1968/1969 (Fig. 3, Table 5).\n\nThe ECW of 1980/1981 was recorded by three stations on the Italian Peninsula and on the Adriatic Sea: in Rome, Crotone and Split. December and January were ECMs in Crotone, but it was the coldest winter in the 60 years for Rome alone. The air temperature anomaly was approx. −2.0 °C.\n\nThe ECW of 1984/1985 was recorded in two areas: in the south—from Belgrade and Sofia to Kiev and Simferopol (6 stations), and in the north—within the Kajaani-Arkhangelsk-Vologda triangle (3 stations). In Belgrade and Sofia, there were no ECMs, and February was an ECM for the remaining stations. In the two northernmost stations, January was also an ECM. For these last stations, it was the coldest winter in the 60-year period, with the temperature anomaly Δt reaching −7.1 °C in Kajaani and −8.0 °C in Arkhangelsk. For the remaining stations, Δt ranged from −2.6 °C in Sofia to −5.5 °C in Kiev and −6.4 °C in Vologda (Fig. 3, Table 5). Days with 24-h temperatures below −10 °C were observed in both areas: in the south, there were fewer than 20 such days (in the west, even fewer than 5), and in the north, there were up to 60 days, including approx. 30 days with maximum temperatures below −20 °C.\n\nAnother ECW recorded by at least three stations appeared only 25 years later—in the 2009/2010 season; it was the only ECW in the twenty-first century, i.e. “a cold extreme in a warming climate” (Cattiaux et al. 2010). It was observed by three seaside stations in the northwest of Europe: in Valentia and Edinburgh (with no ECM, temperature anomaly Δt of −2.1 and −2.4 °C, respectively) and in Bergen (ECM = January, Δt = −3.4 °C; here, it was the coldest winter in the 60-year period).\n\nStrongly negative air temperature anomalies in Western and Northern Europe are observed at the time of negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (Cattiaux et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010; Ouzeau et al. 2011; Buchan et al. 2014). During such spells, Central and Eastern Europe sees more anticyclonic circulation from the north and east or the formation of highs directly over the area (Kossowska-Cezak 1997).\n\n4.2 Exceptionally mild winters\n\nThe EMW of 1954/1955 was observed at four stations in the southernmost and easternmost parts of Europe: in Rome, Athens, Istanbul and Sochi, with January and/or February providing EMMs. The temperature anomaly was 2.1 °C in the west and from 3.0 °C in the east. It was the warmest winter in the six decades under study.\n\nThe EMW of 1965/1966 was recorded in the eastern part of the same area as the EMW of 1954/1955 by three stations—Athens, Simferopol and Sochi. January was an EMM in Sochi, while February was in Athens. The temperature anomaly ranged from 1.9 °C in Athens to 4.1 °C in Simferopol. In Simferopol and Sochi, it was the warmest winter in the 60 years.\n\nThe EMW of 1989/1990 ranked second in terms of the area covered—it was recorded by six stations in the Iberian Peninsula and Southern France, as well as the distant station of Chernivtsi (Fig. 4). February was an EMM, plus December in the Iberian Peninsula. The temperature anomaly in the main area was between 1.4 °C in Lisbon and 3.0 °C in Bordeaux (Table 6). Apart from Lisbon, it was the warmest winter in six decades across the locations. In the main area, there were nearly no cases of temperatures dropping below 0 °C. These were observed in Chernivtsi, but to a much lesser extent than on average Table 6).\n\nThe EMW of 1994/1995 was recorded by only three stations in two areas far apart from each other: Brest in the west and Naryan-Mar and Pechora in the north-east. However, this EMW is noteworthy because the two last stations recorded the greatest positive air temperature anomaly in the 60-year period, Δt = 7.3 and 7.7 °C respectively; these were the only cases of an anomaly greater than 6.0 °C.\n\nThe EMW of 1997/1998 was recorded by three stations in different parts of Europe that were located far apart from one another (Table 4).\n\nThe EMW of 2006/2007 covered the greatest area in the 60 years (Fig. 4). It was recorded by 11 stations across the belt stretching from Paris and De Bilt in the northwest and Crotone, Sofia and Constanţa in the southeast, as well as in the distant station of Orenburg. There was no EMM in the western stations, and January was an EMM in the eastern stations. The temperature anomaly Δt ranged between 2.0 °C in Crotone and 4.3 °C in Vienna and Belgrade. It was the warmest winter in the 60 years (Table 6). For some parts of Western Europe, it was the warmest winter since temperature records using instruments began (Hirschi 2008). That winter, there was not a single day with a 24-h temperature below 0.0 °C (except for Orenburg; Table 6). The mild winter was followed by a warm spring, which greatly accelerated the growth of plants (Maignan et al. 2008). As is asserted by many researchers, mild winters in Western and Northern Europe tend to accompany positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is attributed to higher than normal pressure differences between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. At such times, Central and Eastern Europe sees an increased frequency of cyclonic types of circulation from the west and a fall in or even absence of circulation from the north and the east (Kossowska-Cezak 1997; Jaagus 2006; Isayev and Sherstyukov 2008; Sidorenkov and Orlov 2008; Anisimov et al. 2011)."
