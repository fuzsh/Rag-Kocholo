        "text": "It is not a matter of record high temperatures falling by the wayside day after day this week. It will be the longevity of this heat wave, combined with high dew points and humidity and the warm overnight lows, that will test our tolerance for muggification in Western New York.\n\nMonday will end up being the break-in day, as heat first topped off in the upper 80s to near 90, and dew points rose from Sunday’s dry low 50s to the upper 60s. By precise National Weather Service criteria, conditions for a heat advisory won’t specifically be met until Tuesday.\n\nThe advisory runs through 8 p.m. Thursday, but you can take my word that there will be no magical relief arriving by Friday. NWS advisory specifics are here.\n\nTo make things a little more difficult for outdoor activities, an air quality alert for excess ground ozone went up for Monday afternoon and early evening for all but Allegany County, meaning those with chronic lung or heart disease should avoid outdoor activity during that time period. There may be additional alerts for ozone as the week progresses, with such a stagnant, heated air mass in place.\n\nThe NWS Weather Prediction Center has done some regional calculations for its experimental HeatRisk index this week. You’ll note our region has been placed in the extreme category.\n\nIt will be a gorgeous start to the weekend, with afternoon highs reaching the low 70s on Saturday, writes Don Paul.\n\nThe peak heating will be most notable from Tuesday through Thursday. On those days, the metro area heat index (a measure of how the heat feels when humidity is factored in) will reach the mid-90s, and some locations may edge up into the upper 90s. A few interior locations, particularly north and northeast of the metro area, may approach a heat index of 100, which is quite rare in our region. Here is a valuable set of heat index tools and information people and managers can access from the NWS.\n\nIn general, when the low-level flow is from the southwest, the hottest locations in our region can be found in parts of Niagara and Orleans counties, where any limited Lake Erie influence cannot reach. As you might expect, any Lake Erie breeze will keep things a little more comfortable closer to the shoreline, though the higher humidity will still be in place. As for the Buffalo lake temperature, it has reached 67 degrees. That is 5 degrees above average, but it is still low enough to afford a bit of air conditioning closer to the water.\n\nLast week, it appeared most days this week would be mainly sunny. However, nature is now throwing some clouds into the mix, which may hold peak temperatures down a couple of degrees, though they will still firmly be in the hot range during afternoons. In addition, along the edges of the weak Lake Erie breeze, a few isolated showers and thunderstorms may develop during peak heating hours, as seen in Tuesday modeling, mainly well away from the metro area.\n\nSimilar conditions may develop Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThroughout this period, dew points will remain uncomfortably high, as modeled.\n\nDespite the current chilly start to this week, the June mean Buffalo air temperature is still running 3 degrees above average as of late Sunday.\n\nThe other problem, particularly for the elderly and infants in non-air-conditioned housing, will be the warm and sticky overnight low temperatures. The projected low for Wednesday night/Thursday morning tells the story, similar to lows on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday mornings.\n\nThese temperature and heat index values would be routine in the South, where the population is somewhat acclimated to sultry heat and humidity. That is not the case in the eastern Great Lakes and Northeast, and may be analogous to how extra cold Floridians feel when they face wintry temperatures.\n\nBy Friday, a frontal boundary will draw closer, with more cloud cover and a better chance of a few scattered showers and thunderstorms, keeping high temperatures beneath 90, though dew points will still be sticky, in the upper 60s-low 70s.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAs for Saturday and the Ride for Roswell, it currently appears that frontal boundary will push back to the north again, keeping us in a muggy southwest flow.\n\nThe sunrise temperature won’t be bad.\n\nWhat most excites much of the public is the potential for viewing a possibly spectacular display of the northern lights. If we are to see the northern lights in our region, Friday night is the night for viewing. Saturday night is more likely to be mainly overcast, and there may be a few showers around.\n\nBut as the day progresses, the very warm temperatures and humidity will keep pouring it on.\n\nRiders will deal with a southwest breeze, which may afford a bit of improved ventilation, seen in this “peak gust” modeled depiction by late morning.\n\nDepending on the position of that frontal boundary, there is a small chance for a few stray showers, but it will be mainly rain free.\n\nOn Sunday, an actual cold front will be approaching from the northwest, increasing the chance for developing scattered showers and thunderstorms by afternoon. High temperatures will simmer down in advance of the front to be humid mid-80s, with improvement beginning to develop behind the front Sunday night.\n\nBy Monday, a welcome (I would think) northwest flow will clear out the heat and humidity behind the front, dropping our high temp back to the seasonable mid-to-upper 70s, after the first better sleeping weather in a week, Sunday night.\n\nIn the most recent Canadian drought survey, the extent of drought or abnormally dry conditions is worrisome across much of the country. Even the currently lower risk regions on Ontario and Quebec have extensive dry areas, writes Don Paul.\n\nBy early next week, we will have seen an adjustment in the position and amplitude of an unusually strong heat dome of high pressure, stacked up in the atmosphere. Under such a dome, the greater density and weight of high pressure brings sinking air, which heats up by compression as it moves to the surface. The Wednesday dome position is very strong and dominating the Northeast.\n\nBy early next week, the dome will have weakened and relocated to the southwest, replaced by a weak cooler trough over the Great Lakes.\n\nThere are some early signs of hot high pressure rebuilding aloft closer to the Great Lakes near the end of the month.\n\nIt appears that the NWS Climate Prediction Center sees similar trends in the extended range, into early July.\n\nMany of the precautions we can take to deal with this week’s heat wave seem matters of common sense, but some are less so, such as wearing light color clothes, as well as lightweight fabrics. Here is a rather inclusive link on what we can do to protect the more vulnerable.\n\nTropics continue to grow more active\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is continuing to monitor 2 tropical disturbances, one in the southwest Gulf of Mexico and the other off the southeast U.S. coast. The latter is expected to approach the coast by Thursday or Friday with heavy rain, and has a 30% probability of becoming a tropical depression or storm. The other in the western Gulf has a 70% probability. This link updates automatically.\n\nThe Gulf system, regardless of its winds, is expected to increase the risk of flooding rain in the northwest Gulf coast into southeast Texas and possibly southwest Louisiana by Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nWe need only be reminded of last week’s destructive flooding in south Florida from a disorganized disturbance and a rich supply of tropical moisture as to how much impact can develop just from the rainfall. The progression of the Gulf system can be tracked on this GOES satellite imagery.\n\nLocal Weather\n\nGet the daily forecast and severe weather alerts in your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nDon Paul\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
