        "text": "YEKATERINBURG, Russia: US reporter Evan Gershkovich is set to appear in a Russian court on Thursday for the second hearing of his trial for espionage, a charge that his employer and the White House have labelled a sham.\n\nThe 32-year-old became the first Western journalist in Russia to be charged with spying since the Soviet era when he was detained in March 2023 on a reporting trip to the Urals city of Yekaterinburg.\n\nHe has spent almost 16 months in Russian detention and faces a prison sentence of up to 20 years if found guilty.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to resume behind closed doors in Yekaterinburg’s Sverdlovsk Regional Court at 11:00 am (0600 GMT), almost a month earlier than expected at the request of his defense team.\n\nMoscow and Washington have both said they are open to exchanging the Wall Street Journal reporter in a deal, but neither side has given clues as to when this might be.\n\nThe Kremlin has provided no public evidence for the spying allegations against Gershkovich, saying only that he was caught “red-handed” and was working for the US Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nProsecutors accuse him of spying on Russian tank maker Uralvagonzavod.\n\nWashington has said the claims are fabricated, and a United Nations expert panel declared in July that he was being held arbitrarily.\n\nHis last public appearance in court was on June 26, when he spoke only briefly to greet journalists and his head was fully shaven.\n\nThe Russian penitentiary service refused to disclose to AFP where he would be held after the proceedings or why his hair had been cut.\n\nRaised in New Jersey and a fluent Russian speaker, Gershkovich had reported from Russia for six years.\n\nHe carried on visiting the country on journalistic trips even after dozens of other Western reporters left in the wake of Russia’s Ukraine offensive and the introduction of strict military censorship laws.\n\nIn 2017, he moved to the Russian capital to work for an English-language newspaper, The Moscow Times, where he produced some of the outlet’s biggest stories on a shoestring budget.\n\nHe then worked for AFP before becoming a Moscow correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, weeks before the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine.\n\nIn the role, he covered how the conflict affected ordinary Russians, including by speaking to the families of dead soldiers.\n\nThere has been a major campaign to release Gershkovich, who spent almost 15 months in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo prison following his arrest.\n\n“He is managing the best way he can,” his mother, Ella Milman, told The Wall Street Journal in March.\n\nRussia holds other American citizens in its jails, including marine Paul Whelan, in prison for more than five years on spying charges, and US-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, who was detained last year while visiting family.\n\nThe White House has warned US citizens still in the country to “depart immediately” due to the risk of wrongful arrest.\n\nGLENDALE, Arizona: Vice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, attracted thousands of supporters to a campaign rally as the new Democratic ticket continued their tour of battleground states.\n\nAs Beyonce’s “Freedom” blasted throughout the arena, Harris walked onto the stage to cheers and roars from the crowd of more than 15,000 people.\n\n“As exciting as this is, we cannot lose sight of a really important fact: we are definitely running as the underdog,” Harris said. “We are the underdog. We are out in great numbers, but we got a lot of work to do.”\n\nThe rally was held in a state represented by Democrat Mark Kelly in the US Senate, whom Harris passed over as a running mate. The former astronaut and gun control advocate had been a top contender for running mate. He’s won two tough races in politically divided Arizona.\n\nIn passing over Kelly, Harris may have also lost the chance to win over people like Gonzalo Leyva, a 49-year-old landscaper in Phoenix. Leyva plans to vote for former President Donald Trump, a Republican, but says he would have backed a Harris-Kelly ticket.\n\n“I prefer Kelly like 100 times,” said Leyva, a lifelong Democrat who became an independent at the beginning of Trump’s term in office. “I don’t think he’s that extreme like the other guys.”\n\nIn Arizona, every vote will be critical. The state is no stranger to nail-biter races, including in 2020 when President Joe Biden bested Trump by fewer than 11,000 votes. Both parties are bracing for a similar photo finish this year.\n\n“These last few months are going to feel like years, and it is tough to see anyone winning by a large margin,” said Constantine Querard, a veteran Republican strategist in the state.\n\nHarris acknowledged how tough the race will be, as she and Walz toured a campaign office in North Phoenix Friday afternoon and thanked volunteers, who were making signs with sayings such as “This Mamala is Voting for Kamala” and “Kamala and the Coach.” (Walz has been a high school football coach).\n\n“It’s gonna be a lot of work,” Harris told volunteers of winning in November.\n\nDemocrats profess confidence that Harris is in solid shape in the state even without Kelly on the ticket. The senator is expected to remain a strong advocate for Harris and is already mentioned for possible Cabinet posts or other prominent roles should the vice president ascend to the Oval Office. Kelly is expected to attend the Arizona rally.\n\n“Not picking Kelly hasn’t put the brakes on support for Harris,” said Stacy Pearson, a Democratic strategist in Phoenix. She said she feels the same enthusiasm for the new ticket that has led to giant crowds greeting Harris and Walz at prior stops on their tour, including the home of another running mate also-ran, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nAnother Democratic strategist in Arizona, D.J. Quinlan, agreed. “There’s a ton of enthusiasm on the ground. It’s the closest thing to me to what 2008 felt like,” he said, referring to former President Barack Obama’s first run, which electrified Democratic voters.\n\nArizona is something of a magnet for Midwesterners seeking to escape the cold. So, several observers say, Walz may still play well there. Scott Snyder, who moved to Phoenix three years ago from Detroit, wasn’t too familiar with Kelly’s background or his politics, but said Harris made the right choice with Walz.\n\n“He reminds me a lot of my dad,” said Snyder, an electrician. “You see pictures of him out there coaching high school football. That’s something that resonates with me. You see him out there duck hunting. Same thing. That’s fairly common in Michigan, where I’m from.”\n\nArizona was reliably Republican until Trump’s combative approach to politics went national.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won Arizona, then quickly started feuding with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a political icon in the state. That sparked a steady exodus of educated, moderate Republicans from the GOP and toward Democrats in top-of-the-ticket contests.\n\nIn 2018, Democrats won an open Senate race in the state, foreshadowing Kelly’s 2020 win and Biden’s victory there as well. In 2022, Kelly won again, and Democrats swept the top three statewide races for governor, attorney general and secretary of state, defeating Republican candidates who hewed to Trump’s style and his lies about fraud costing him the 2020 presidential election.\n\nChuck Coughlin, a Republican strategist and former McCain staffer, said the same voters who tipped the state to Democrats in the past few cycles remain lukewarm, at best, on Trump.\n\n“Trump’s not doing anything to embrace that segment of the electorate,” he said.\n\nThe campaign is already being fought over familiar turf in Arizona — its border with Mexico. Trump and his allies have been hammering Biden over the influx of migrants during his term and are shifting their attacks to Harris.\n\n“It’s very easy for us to segue and switch our sights and focus on her,” said Dave Smith, Pima County’s Republican party chairman.\n\nKari Lake, who is running against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego for an open Senate seat in Arizona, unveiled an ad late last week bashing Gallego for supporting what the ad calls Biden and Harris’ “radical border agenda,” featuring repeated clips of the vice president chortling.\n\nOn Thursday, Lake argued to reporters that Harris is less popular in Arizona than Biden. “They like Kamala Harris even less,” Lake said. “They understand that she hasn’t done anything on the border.”\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is targeting the state’s fast-growing Latino population with her own ad highlighting how Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, rose to the highest echelons of American politics.\n\nHarris’ background and comparative youth have put Arizona and other Sun Belt states back in play in a presidential race that had been narrowing to the trio of “blue wall” swing states, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThough it has a robust younger population, Arizona is also known for its vast swaths of retirement communities. Pearson contended that Biden’s age, 81, put him at a disadvantage in the state.\n\n“Fellow retirees were the first to say this is not OK,” Pearson said of Biden’s age. “I’m so much more optimistic with Harris and Walz at the top of the ticket.”\n\nRussia moved extra tanks, artillery and rocket systems to its southern Kursk region on Friday as it battled a shock incursion by Ukraine’s military, while Ukrainian forces posted a video purporting to show them in control of a town near the border.\n\nIn new evidence of the damage inflicted in the Ukrainian counter-offensive, video posted on social media and verified by Reuters showed a convoy of about 15 burnt-out Russian military trucks spaced out along a highway in the Kursk region.\n\nSome contained dead bodies.\n\nThe acting governor of Kursk region, Alexei Smirnov, said drone debris had fallen on a power substation near Kurchatov, site of one of Russia’s largest nuclear power stations with four reactors. Power to the area was cut for a time.\n\nThe head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency urged both sides to show restraint in view of the proximity of the conflict to the station, 60 km (35 miles) from the border.\n\nRussian diplomats in Vienna told the IAEA that fragments, possibly from downed missiles, had been found, though there was no evidence of an attack on the station.\n\nUkrainian forces broke across the border on Tuesday in a thrust that caught the Russian military by surprise after months of gradual advances in eastern Ukraine by Moscow’s forces.\n\nPoliticians and the military are referring to a Ukrainian “invasion,” nearly two and a half years after Russia launched its own full-scale invasion of its neighbor.\n\nAuthorities declared a federal state of emergency in Kursk.\n\nTwo days after Military Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov reported to President Vladimir Putin that the advance had been halted, Russia’s defense ministry said its forces “continue to repel an attempted invasion by the Armed Forces of Ukraine into the territory of the Russian Federation.”\n\nInterfax news agency quoted the ministry as saying that Russia was sending in columns of reinforcements with Grad multiple-launch rocket systems, artillery and tanks.\n\nThe video purporting to show Ukrainian forces in control of a gas measuring facility run by Russian concern Gazprom in the town of Sudzha was Ukraine’s first pictorial acknowledgement of its troops’ advance into Kursk region.\n\n“The town is controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the town is calm, all buildings are intact,” a soldier in the video said, adding that the “strategic Gazprom facility” was under the control of a Ukrainian battalion.\n\nReuters could not verify the video and the Ukrainian military’s General Staff made no comment.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has maintained a strict silence on the operation, though he dropped some clear hints on Thursday, without referring to Kursk.\n\nHe praised his army’s ability “to surprise.” And in his nightly video address, he thanked army units who had taken Russian servicemen prisoner, to be used in later negotiations.\n\n“This is extremely important and has been particularly effective over the past three days,” he said.\n\nBen Barry, land warfare analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that while its wider strategic goals remained unclear, Ukraine had exposed Russian shortcomings and overturned the conventional wisdom on the war that neither side could advance without heavy losses.\n\n“They clearly have achieved a degree of surprise which suggests that Russia’s ability to do intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance is inadequate,” he said in a phone interview.\n\nA Ukrainian Telegram channel that posted the video of the destroyed Russian trucks said they had been hit by a US-supplied HIMARS rocket system.\n\nRussian bloggers also blamed a HIMARS strike, and one said whoever had given the order for military vehicles to move in exposed columns was an “asshole” who should be shot.\n\nReuters was not able to establish how the vehicles were destroyed.\n\nThe United States announced a new $125 million package of aid for Ukraine, including Stinger missiles, artillery ammunition, and anti-armor systems. Zelensky expressed thanks, saying the equipment was “vital for our forces to counter Russian assaults.”\n\nRussia’s defense ministry released its own video which it said showed a drone destroying a Ukrainian tank and howitzer near Sudzha. Reuters was able to verify the location.\n\nThe ministry said that in the previous 24 hours, Russian troops, air strikes and artillery had “suppressed raid attempts by enemy units deep into Russian territory in the Kursk direction.”\n\nIt said that Ukraine had lost up to 945 soldiers and 102 armored vehicles in total during the Kursk fighting, without mentioning any losses on the Russian side.\n\nReuters could not verify the battlefield accounts. On Wednesday, Gerasimov had said the Ukrainian attack was mounted by up to 1,000 troops.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said in an overnight report that geolocated footage and Russian accounts indicated that Ukrainian forces had “continued rapid advances.”\n\nThere were unconfirmed reports from Russian sources of Ukrainians pushing as deep as 35 km (22 miles) from the border.\n\nRybar, a Russian military blog, said Ukrainian units had been entering village after village and staging ambushes against arriving Russian reinforcements.\n\nThe Russian rouble was down 2.5 percent against the dollar and traders said the Ukrainian attack on Kursk region was one of the factors behind the currency’s weakness.\n\nVINHEDO, Brazil: An airplane carrying 57 passengers and four crew crashed Friday in Brazil’s Sao Paulo state, killing everyone on board, the airline said.\n\nThe aircraft, an ATR 72-500 operated by Voepass airline, was traveling from Cascavel in southern Parana state to Sao Paulo’s Guarulhos international airport when it crashed in the city of Vinhedo.\n\nVoepass initially said the plane was carrying 58 passengers, but a statement later on the airline’s website revised the figure to 57.\n\nImages broadcast on local media showed a large plane spinning as it plummeted almost vertically, while other footage showed a large column of smoke rising from the crash site in what appeared to be a residential area.\n\n“There were no survivors,” the city government in Valinhos — which was involved in the rescue and recovery operation in nearby Vinhedo — said in an email sent to AFP.\n\nVinhedo, with about 76,000 residents, is located approximately 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.\n\n“The bodies are being taken to the morgue,” the Vinhedo city government told AFP.\n\nBefore an official death toll was given, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said during an event in Santa Catarina state that it appeared there were no survivors, and called for a moment of silence for the victims.\n\nIn a statement, Voepass reported “an accident involving flight 2283.”\n\nThe company said it was cooperating with authorities to “determine the causes of the accident,” while giving full assistance to victims’ families.\n\nThe plane, a twin-engine turboprop, took off “without any flight restrictions, with all its systems operational,” the statement added.\n\nATR, a Franco-Italian aircraft maker and Airbus subsidiary, said its experts were working to help investigators.\n\nNathalie Cicari, who lives near the crash site, told CNN Brasil the impact was “terrifying.”\n\n“I was having lunch, I heard a very loud noise very close by,” she said, describing the sound as drone-like but “much louder.”\n\n“I went out on the balcony and saw the plane spinning. Within seconds, I realized that it was not a normal movement for a plane.”\n\nCicari was not hurt but had to evacuate her house, which was filled with black smoke from the crash.\n\n“I arrived at the scene and saw many bodies on the ground — many of them,” another witness, Ricardo Rodrigues, told local Band News.\n\nFirefighters, military police and state civil defense were deployed at the scene.\n\nMilitary police on the ground told local media that the accident had not caused any additional casualties at the crash site, and that the fire sparked by the crash had been brought under control.\n\nThe plane’s black box “has already been found, apparently preserved,” Sao Paulo state security official Guilherme Derrite told reporters at the scene.\n\nThe doomed plane recorded its first flight in April 2010, according to the website planespotters.net.\n\nAir safety has improved dramatically in recent decades, with deadly passenger plane crashes becoming ever-more rare worldwide, though still more frequent in developing nations.\n\nIn January 2023, another ATR 72 operated by Yeti Airlines crashed after stalling in Nepal, killing all 72 on board.\n\nNepalese authorities attributed the incident to pilot error."
