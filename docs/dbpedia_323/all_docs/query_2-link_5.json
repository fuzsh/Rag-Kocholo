        "text": "On a sizzling hot day in April, Cairo meteorologist Amira Nasser points to a written chronicle of Egypt’s weather in the 1800s. Outside, the temperature is 41°C (105°F), or 46°C in the sun — hot enough to have killed the battery on Nasser’s phone. Inside, the records at the museum of meteorology have a page from April 1874, when the temperature in Cairo was 24°C.\n\n“It’s only April and we’re dealing with heat waves already,” she says. “This was unheard of decades ago.”"
