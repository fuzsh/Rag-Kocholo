However, despite the low temperatures, it is a country worth visiting, at least once in a lifetime.\n\nBest time to travel to Russia\n\nThe north and east of Russia are the coldest areas in this immense country. After the winter freeze, comes the thaw, so avoid the months between March and May if you're not prepared for a little mud. Autumn, on the other hand, is perfect for enjoying the landscapes and visiting the sights without being too cold.\n\nIf you prefer warmer weather, undoubtedly July and August are the ideal months. Keep in mind however that, precisely for this reason, this is when more tourists visit the country. If you want to travel with fewer crowds, ideally choose a departure date between September and November.\n\nAs for the climate, being such an extensive country, it can vary from arid to polar, depending on the region in question. In the most populated part of Russia, between Moscow and St. Petersburg, the temperature in winter is usually -6ºC, and in summer 19ºC.\n\nOn the other hand, temperature contrasts are also common in this country, a clear example of which is the city of Khabarovsk, with 21ºC in July, and -20ºC in January. For its part, Sevastopol in Crimea reaches 35ºC in July, the hottest month in Russia!\n\nContinue reading to find out the best time to travel to Russia according to the region you plan on visiting.\n\nTo visit St. Petersburg, located in the northwest of the country, take advantage of the good temperatures of summer and autumn. On the other hand, between May and September would be the best months to visit the city. If you want to see the famous white nights celebration, you must travel in June, but keep in mind that you will be joined by a large number of tourists.\n\nAt the end of May, the temperature is 15ºC on average, and this is when the shows and concerts begin in the city. It is a good month to travel since visitor numbers are still quite low.\n\nTo visit the great museums and the opera in peace and without queues, it is best to travel in October and November. The average temperatures are between 2ºC and 11ºC, and the prices are much more affordable outside of the peak season."
