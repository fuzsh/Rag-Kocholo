        "text": "Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich issued an interview request to Russian President Vladimir Putin through his exit paperwork from Russian prison, WSJ .\n\nA Thursday prisoner swap deal freed both Gershkovich and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan from Russian captivity As part of the deal, Germany will send Russian agent Vadim Krasikov back to his home country.\n\nKrasikov was sentenced to life in prison by German authorities in 2021 after he was convicted of killing Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a militant who fought Russia in Chechnya.\n\nIn his release, Gershkovich was asked to complete an official request for clemency addressed to Putin. The form reportedly included a blank section where the reporter added his request.\n\n“The pro forma printout included a long blank space the prisoner could fill out if desired, or simply, as expected, leave blank,” WSJ reported. “In the formal high Russian he had honed over 16 months imprisonment, the Journal’s Russia correspondent filled the page. The last line submitted a proposal of his own: After his release, would Putin be willing to sit down for an interview?”\n\nREAD MORE |\n\nPutin’s last interview with an American journalist was when he sat down with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in February. The two-hour was Putin’s first with a Western journalist since the Russian invasion of Ukraine commenced.\n\nThe Russian leader during that interview said he would swap Gershkovich for a Russian \"patriot\" who had \"eliminated a bandit\" in a European capital, an apparent reference to Krasikov.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, on Thursday the prisoner swap involving the U.S. and Russia negotiated by the Biden administration is a result of “Trump’s strength.”\n\n“We certainly want these Americans to come back home,” the senator said. “It was ridiculous that they were in prison to begin with, but we have to ask ourselves why are they coming home? And I think it’s because bad guys all over the world recognize Donald Trump is about to be back in office, so they’re cleaning house.”\n\n“That’s a good thing, and I think it’s a testament to Donald Trump’s strength,” he added.\n\nJackson Walker on X at @_jlwalker_ for the latest trending national news.
