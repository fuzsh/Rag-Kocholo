        "meta_description": "Objectives In this study a prototype of a new health forecasting alert system is developed, which is aligned to the approach used in the Met Office’s (MO) National Severe Weather Warning Service (NSWWS). This is in order to improve information available to responders in the health and social care system by linking temperatures more directly to risks of mortality, and developing a system more coherent with other weather alerts. The prototype is compared to the current system in the Cold Weather and Heatwave plans via a case-study approach to verify its potential advantages and shortcomings.   Method The prototype health forecasting alert system introduces an “impact vs likelihood matrix” for the health impacts of hot and cold temperatures which is similar to those used operationally for other weather hazards as part of the NSWWS. The impact axis of this matrix is based on existing epidemiological evidence, which shows an increasing relative risk of death at extremes of outdoor temperature beyond a threshold which can be identified epidemiologically. The likelihood axis is based on a probability measure associated with the temperature forecast. The new method is tested for two case studies (one during summer 2013, one during winter 2013), and compared to the performance of the current alert system.   Conclusions The prototype shows some clear improvements over the current alert system. It allows for a much greater degree of flexibility, provides more detailed regional information about the health risks associated with periods of extreme temperatures, and is more coherent with other weather alerts which may make it easier for front line responders to use. It will require validation and engagement with stakeholders before it can be considered for use.",

        "text": "Prototype system\n\nA crucial point in the design criteria for the proposed new method was to make it consistent with the NSWWS system [17], where risk is the product of a measure of the likely impact of the hazard and the uncertainty of the underlying weather forecast (e.g. [22]). Thus:\n\na refined “local approach” to be applied to both the cold weather and heatwave alerts;\n\nan impact range that depends on epidemiological evidence (i.e. mortality-temperature relationship);\n\nan uncertainty range that depends on the properties of the forecast (e.g., the forecast lead time, which is the length of time between the issue of a forecast and the occurrence of the phenomenon that is predicted).\n\nIn this study we will mainly focus on points 1 and 2, which are more relevant from a public health point of view, and discuss possible ways of implementing point 3, which depends on the operational weather forecasting system in use and which is likely to change as this system is updated.\n\nFig 1A shows a schematic of the concept, whereby the alert level is associated with a measure of impact and likelihood. The latter (y-axis in the matrix of Fig 1A) is given by the confidence of the temperature forecast. In this example this is related to the amount of time between the forecast being issued and when the event is due to occur. This is a rather crude approach, which is based on the assumption that a forecast accuracy is much greater when closer to the event occurrence. At the end of the Results Session an example will be provided whereby the likelihood of an extreme event is calculated more objectively via the EPS approach in use at the Met Office (it is worth noting that at present uncertainties in the weather forecast are routinely being assessed using EPS giving probabilistic forecasts—e.g. [23]).\n\nThe impact (x-axis in the matrix of Fig 1A) is based on the severity of the predicted mortality RR. Fig 1B shows in greater detail how the risk is derived from existing epidemiological evidence linking mortality RR with temperature. A RR of 1 implies no excess deaths and a RR of 1.04 implies a 4% increase in deaths. For this example, a yellow alert occurs when the RR lies between 1.04 and 1.08. It is noted that this example is only illustrative, as the appropriate relative risk of death thresholds at which yellow, amber and red warnings for heat and cold are issued will need to be determined in discussion with stakeholders. The colour code in the example follows that of the NSWWS, to make the two systems as consistent as possible.\n\nThis approach allows us to derive a mean temperature range over which this enhanced risk would occur, based on the relationship between RR of death and temperature. The same approach can be used for both extreme heat and cold and it is possible to incorporate regional variation in temperature-mortality relationships, as long as the epidemiological data are available. Although other systems make use of more complex biometeorological indices, the reason for choosing surface mean temperature is twofold. Firstly, its relationship with mortality has already been clearly demonstrated (see below). Secondly, this proof-of-concept system has been created to be as simple as possible, using the most basic meteorological variable, with known predictability characteristics and that is known to impact human health. The novelty of the proof-of-concept system is the incorporation of the vulnerability and likelihood dimensions of risk into one system. The proof-of-concept is sufficiently flexible that should it be necessary to incorporate more complex epidemiological information into a future version, this could be done at minimal cost.\n\nFor England, RR-temperature relationships are derived from [21] and [12]. [21] analysed the relationship between the RR and temperature in the summer period for the nine government regions of England (plus Wales), using daily counts of all-cause mortality and measures of ambient temperature between 1993 and 2006. Individual death record data were obtained from the Office for National Statistics, including date of death and postcode of residence at time of death, while the temperature values were downloaded from the British Atmospheric Data Centre for all available monitoring station data. For each region a linear model has been fitted with a good approximation (particularly for a RR<1.2). Using the linear model, we can derive a temperature range for each of the nine regions, which is associated with a fixed interval in excess deaths. For the illustrative purpose of this study, we have derived temperature intervals for four RR bands (1.0–1.04, 1.04–1.08, 1.08–1.16, greater than 1.16), but the thresholds can be easily modified according to operational needs (for example to balance the need to warn the public and responders with the risk of alert fatigue).\n\nIt is noted here that there is limited evidence of an increase RR of death as a function of event persistence (e.g. [24]), although some studies have used two day mean temperatures as the exposure variable in modelling temperature mortality relationships (e.g. [21]). For the sake of simplicity, the prototype system was developed and tested using single day mean temperatures. The previously referred case-study (summer 2014) at the end of the Results Session introduces a persistence criterion based on the mean of the maximum temperatures on each pair of consecutive days. If such a criterion is proved to be useful, it could potentially be applied to the winter season as well, where the “lag effect” is well documented in the literature.\n\nVulnerability to extreme temperature is known to vary across the population, with higher vulnerability in very young and elderly population. The RR used in the proof-of-concept system is not age dependent in common with the existing operational system. As always when designing an operational system there has to be a balance between the complexity and comprehensiveness of the system with its ubiquity and utility for the broadest possible group of end users. Our judgement is that because the system is used for the broad range of stakeholders identified in S1 Table rather than targeted at a particular sector with a skewed age profile the choice of a generic RR applicable to all the population is most appropriate. As above, the design of the proof-of-concept system is sufficiently flexible that adapting this for more highly age differentiated age profiles would be a low-cost adaptation should this be desired.\n\nCase studies\n\nTwo case studies have been considered, both of which occurred during 2013, one during the winter season 2012/13, and one during summer. As the prototype is a proof-of-concept, the case studies provided here are not intended to comprehensively test the new system or to objectively assess its performance against the existing approach, rather they are useful to compare advantages and possible shortcomings of the former. The first guess alerts produced by the prototype will be analysed against the recorded alerts of the current system, to highlight the major differences in the timing and space distribution of the alerts. A particular attention will be given to the way such alerts are provided with the potential new system, where detailed geographical information can be visualised to deliver the results effectively and compellingly.\n\nThe first guess alerts for the summer case have been based on the temperature at noon, whereas the first guess alerts for the winter cases are associated with the mean temperature, T ([T(midnight)+T(noon)]/2), in order to be consistent with [21] and [12]. One could certainly make other choices (for example, deciding that the night temperature for summer is equally important), however we would like to reiterate that such decisions are not paramount for the results of this research, as the main focus is to demonstrate that the proof-of-concept is an overall advancement over the current system. We also note that winter temperatures associated with a RR>1 (ranging from 4 to 8°C depending on the region–[12]) are not that infrequent during English winter, and certainly higher than the current 2°C threshold. Considering the winter temperature climatology over the UK, this means it would be quite common to have yellow, amber and red alerts if the thresholds were to be set at the levels used in this example (for example, a RR of 1.16 is associated with temperatures ranging between -2 and 4°C for different regions).\n\nThe summer case study uses 1 August 2013, where high maximum temperatures (above 30°C) were recorded over south-eastern and central England. The days before and after the maximum temperatures barely exceeded 25°C over the southern part of the country, the event is therefore associated with a single day spike in high temperatures. The winter case is profoundly different as it represents particularly cold conditions on the 11 and 12 March which occurred during an extremely cold month, which was “the coldest March since 1962 and the equal second-coldest in the series from 1910” [25]. On the 11 and 12 of March, the temperature remained at the freezing level (and below) for the entire day and over almost all of the UK, in particular on the 11th.\n\nSummer case: Prototype\n\nResults from the new method are shown in Fig 2. Four different maps are produced for each forecast, on the 29, 30 and 31 of July. These show the four days ahead of the forecast, and in Fig 2 they are shifted along the forecast day’s time-axis by 1 place each day in order to have the same (forecast) day aligned in each column. The colour scheme is the same as that used in the NSWWS.\n\nThe first guess alerts generated by the prototype system are shown along each row (for the day after up to 4 days ahead). The days are rearranged to be always the same along the columns. The color scheme is explained with the matrix at the bottom right of the figure (where the forecast lead time is used as a proxy for forecast uncertainty). The bottom left panel illustrates an example of a detailed regional alert for the South-West. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are left blank as they do not share the same alert system for health forecasting.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137804.g002\n\nThe new alert system forecasts a RR risk of death of between 1.08 and 1.16 (amber) three days in advance (forecasts issued on the 29 of July for 1 August) for the entire south-eastern side of the country, including the East Midlands. The amber alert is confirmed the day after (forecasts issued on the 30 July for 1 August) and further extended over the South-West, West Midlands and the Yorkshire. Finally, on the day before the event (forecast issued on 31 July for 1 August), the alert level is raised to its maximum (red, RR of death >1.16) for all of South and Central England, whereas it remains “amber” for Yorkshire. No other red first guess alerts are generated during this period, and a single amber alert is raised for the South-Eastern region on the 2nd of August.\n\nA further advantage of the new approach is the possibility to explore in more detail how the regional alert might vary within region based on detailed temperature information present in the MO forecasts. For example, a Local Resilience Forum (LRF) in the South West might be interested in understanding why the region has been assigned with an amber alert for the forecast issued on the 30 of July. The panel at the bottom left of Fig 2 shows the potential for an end-user to zoom in on any given region to observe the spatial distribution of the alert code. It is evident that most of the South-West is labelled with an amber alert, however the western side of the region has a lower level of risk, with alert levels down to green (or even a complete absence of warnings). The threshold chosen here to label the entire South-West region with the amber alert is set to 15% of its territory. That is, if starting from the highest level, at least 15% of the region is in a given alert category, the entire region will be assigned with that alert level. The authors are aware that such an approach is rather cautious, and could lead to a higher frequency of first guess alerts. However, this is done specifically to test how the new system could have worked, always bearing in mind that the thresholds for issuing region wide alerts are for illustrative purposes and can be easily modified.\n\nSometimes a given alert code may result from different combinations of impact and likelihood in the matrix (see for example the upper-right corner for the amber first guess alerts). The implementation of the system on a graphical interface will always allow the end-user to view from which point of the matrix, the alert has been generated, for example with a tick mark in the relevant box (as used in [26]). Specifically for this example, the majority of the amber region falls in the matrix box with a RR between 1.08–1.16 for a 2 days lead-time forecast."
