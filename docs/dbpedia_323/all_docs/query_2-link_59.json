        "text": "The Yamal LNG plant is located in the Yamal peninsula, farÂ north of Nenets Autonomous Okrug. In the ethnic Nenets people'sÂ language, \"yamal\" means \"land's end\". In the mid-1900s, geologicalÂ explorers discovered this vast expanse of ice was sitting on theÂ world's largest natural gas reserves. The huge reserves, shallow inÂ depth and containing high-purity natural gas, account for more thanÂ 80 percent of Russia's total natural gas reserves.\n\nHowever, the extreme geographical and climatic conditionsÂ in the polar region prevented access to this treasure. In the wastelandÂ 400 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, where the YamalÂ LNG plant is located, the weather is freezing. In winter, the averageÂ temperature drops between minus 20 degrees and minus 40 degreesÂ Celsius and can even fall to minus 52 degrees Celsius. The polar nightÂ lasts 88 days when there is no sun. Even in August, the warmestÂ month, the average temperature is minus 3 degrees Celsius. DuringÂ summer, there are 103 days of uninterrupted daylight, making one's head spin.\n\nÂ Â Workers of the Yamal LNG project\n\nIt is never an easy task for humanity to conquer the Arctic. Russian President Vladimir Putin once said that since work started on the Yamal project, the naysayers came up with a long list of the reasons why they thought it was bound to fail.\n\nTo make the mission impossible possible, the four major shareholders of the project â Novatek of Russia, Total S.A. of France, and CNPC and the Silk Road Fund of China â founded the Joint Stock Company Yamal LNG and invited builders from a dozen of countries for international cooperation so that the oil and gas reserves under ice in the freezing Arctic coud be explored efficiently.\n\nAt the plant, the builders speak many languages â Russian, Chinese, French, English and more, since Sabetta has become an international cooperation platform.\n\nDue to the harsh conditions in the frozen desert, such a megaproject construction was unprecedented in human history. Novatek's CEO Leonid Mikhelson, who was once the chief engineer of a company that builds oilfields, called a coordination meeting of the leaders of all sides to find a solution to the technological problems. The experts proposed modular construction.\n\nIt meant breaking down a part into different units or modules, which would be manufactured in factories across the globe, and then shipped back to the construction site in Yamal for installation. This building-block-by-block approach effectively solved the difficulties of on-the-spot construction.\n\nSeven Chinese enterprises, including CNPC, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, Sinopec and Qingdao McDermott Wuchuan Offshore Engineering Co., undertook to build 120 of the 142 modules required. The total weight of the 120 would be more than 400,000 tons. The biggest module was 7,500 tons, almost as heavy as the Eiffel Tower.\n\nBut thanks to the innovative model and joint efforts of the engineering teams from different countries, the project progressed faster than expected, outpacing the LNG projects in tropical and subtropical regions, where construction is possible throughout the year.\n\nIn December 2017, Yamal's first production line went into operation and on July 19, 2018, the icebreaking LNG carrierÂ Vladimir RusanovÂ arrived at the LNG receiving terminal in Rudong County in east China's Jiangsu Province, where the temperature was a contrasting 40 degrees Celsius. The vessel carried 75,000 tons of LNG from Yamal. This maiden voyage was a critical moment in the history of Sino-Russian energy cooperation. In August 2018, Yamal's second production line became operational, followed by the third production line in December the same year, a year ahead of schedule.\n\nIn 2017, the construction site had been sunless for days during the polar night. Xu Shengjun, deputy director of the Yamal plantâs capital construction department, and his colleagues from other countries walked in steady steps towards the plant in the light of the aurora borealis. They were weighed down by their polar uniform, helmet, shoes, gloves and goggles, which weighed tens of kilograms.\n\nThey had arrived at the plant after taking two flights for more than 10 hours. To ensure the greatest work efficiency in the sub-zero temperature, they had to get ready for work immediately after arrival. Once the work started, there was no time for regular meals. TheyÂ were served Russian cold meals. The bread was so hard that it was too tough to bite into. Though their protective clothing kept their bodies warm, their faces would freeze and they would take turns to warm themselves up. A thick layer of frost encrusting their faces â this became the daily image of the Yamal staff.\n\nÂ The first icebreaking carrierÂ Vladimir RusanovÂ sails out of the Arctic bearing LNG from the Yamal plant, December 2017.\n\nNevertheless, they overcame the physical and mental challenges posed by the North Pole, and completed the construction, which, despite made easier by modular construction, was still hard.\n\nAt the same time, manufacturing the modules outside the Arctic was equally challenging as there were a huge variety of and a large number of components. They all required high precision and complex techniques, which was far more difficult than the other projects in the industry. To build the 36 core modules, the Chinese companies had to lay 215,000 meters of pipeline, equivalent to the length of the Sixth Ring Road in Beijing. Besides, they had to install 3,300 kilometers of cables, which was long enough to connect Beijing with the Arctic Circle. The files detailing the completed work ran into more than one million pages.\n\nIn spite of the difficulties, the Chinese enterprises participatingÂ in the construction were the first contractors to deliver the LNGÂ modules, on schedule and with the quality guaranteed. In addition,Â they created a new safety record of working 38.63 million hoursÂ on a single item at a single site without any accident. It set a newÂ benchmark in international building history.\n\nTo transport the modules to the Arctic, Chinese shipping andÂ shipbuilding enterprises produced a series of firsts.\n\nGuangzhou Shipyard International Co. builtÂ AUDAX, theÂ worldâs first polar heavy load carrier. It was 206.3 meter long, biggerÂ than two football fields, and could transport a modular of more thanÂ 10 stories high.Â AUDAXÂ could sail at the super low temperatureÂ of minus 50 degrees Celsius, carrying LNG modules to Sabetta. ItsÂ icebreaking ability is higher than Chinese icebreaking research vesselÂ Xue Longâs and meets Russiaâs highest ice class standard Arc7.\n\nChen Ming, Chinese professor and top constructor, flew toÂ Yamal with his team to direct logistics for the giant modules, workingÂ at minus 50 degrees Celsius on a vast expanse of white ice in theÂ North Pole. From all over the world, 142 giant modules were being shipped to the North Pole and a slight error in their arrival sequence would cause serious congestion in the port, affecting others. This kind of work had never been done before and Chen had to be extremely careful.\n\nThe office and residential area at the main campsite\n\nPutting their research into practice, Chen and his team improved the transportation plan and meticulously organized the complex logistics to tightly coordinate the construction process. During the years of construction, he became a frequent flier, flying from the seven domestic module manufacturers to Moscow and back almost every month.\n\nWith his colleagues from all over the world, Chen made large-scale use of the Northeast Passage, the shipping route to the Pacific. More than half of the modules and goods were sent to the construction site via the passage, which remarkably reduced transport costs.\n\nThe Yamal LNG project can be called a touchstone of perseverance, dedication and professionalism, as well as courage to make innovations and overcome difficulties. The people on the job worked in freezing temperatures and without any precedential experience to draw on when they faced unforeseen complex factors. A model of international energy cooperation in the Arctic, it is a milestone in international pragmatic cooperation.\n\nAt the 5th China-Russia Expo held in Yekaterinburg in Russia in July 2018, the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug booth presented an arresting sight. Its fur tents, display of ethnic clothes and deer models brought elements of the mysterious Arctic with its vast tundras. TheÂ pristine region has remained unchanged for thousands of years, andÂ the builders of the LNG project had to ensure that no harm wouldÂ befall the region during their work.\n\nThe project, besides its commercial successes, also took meticulousÂ measures to ensure the Arctic ecology was protected.\n\nIt undertook construction following the Equator Principles, theÂ framework used by corporate institutions to assess and manage environmentalÂ and social risks in their projects. The standards followed atÂ Yamal were higher than national and general business standards. TheÂ drilling cuttings, mud and waste liquid generated during constructionÂ and operation were treated comprehensively to mitigate environmentalÂ damage. Yamal LNG invested over USD40 million toÂ build a recycling station for the mud produced during drilling, usingÂ environmentally friendly technology in the Arctic.\n\nTo save energy and reduce emissions, a campsite was built at theÂ site. It can accommodate 30,000 people and has greatly improvedÂ commute, living and food conditions for the staff. While meetingÂ environmental and work requirements, it also embodies a peopleorientedÂ concept.\n\nÂ Â A bird's eye view of the Yamal LNG project\n\nThe Yamal LNG project has its roots in the Arctic. It hasÂ honored that by developing the region and meeting the needs of theÂ local people.\n\nIt has built a kindergarten, a boarding school for the childrenÂ of the nomadic local tribes and a church. There have been otherÂ infrastructural benefits for the community like a water treatmentÂ facility, a small power station, a hospital, a venison processing plantÂ and apartments. It also collaborates in science and innovation withÂ the Arctic Research Center, has sponsored a international forumÂ for indigenous people, and taken part in public welfare activitiesÂ including supporting veterans in Yamal.\n\nThe project has been localized as far as possible without compromisingÂ on technology and cost control. During construction, YamalÂ LNG signed contracts worth USD10 billion with 650 enterprises in 55 Russian federal areas, creating more than 60,000 jobs.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Yamal LNG site had become a brilliantly illuminated area full of people. Due to the joint efforts of all the players, the three production lines of the project were put into operation ahead of schedule. Builders of different nationalities embraced one another, celebrating the realization of common goals.\n\nWith the development of the Yamal LNG project, more and more people are venturing to cross the polar circle, visiting the plant and living in tents. The project protects the unique ecology of the Arctic while illuminating the night sky, a symbol of international cooperation with bright prospects."
