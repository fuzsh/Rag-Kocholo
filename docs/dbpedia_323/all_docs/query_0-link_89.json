        "text": "As winter showcased its lingering presence despite bouts of spring-like warmth in recent weeks, hundreds of cars were stranded along Interstate 90 near Bozeman Pass Wednesday with snowdrifts as high as 3 feet.\n\nAround 1 p.m. on Wednesday, the Gallatin County Sheriff Search and Rescue dispatched, assisting the Montana Department of Transportation and providing food, water and fuel, urging motorists to keep their vehicles running — some of whom were stuck for over 10 hours.\n\nSome locals also took it upon themselves to help, including Joshua Rhynard, who lives near the Jackson Creek exit.\n\nAfter his wife learned of a family on a Greyhound bus that was running out of baby formula for their infant child via a local Facebook group, Rhynard told the Chronicle that he got on his snowmobile and headed for the interstate.\n\n“It was a lot of snow and it was wet snow,” he said. “A lot of people were not super prepared and were very thankful — they were stuck out there all night, they were tired.”\n\nReceiving approval from law enforcement, Rhynard made his way from vehicle to vehicle, his snowmobile stocked with snacks, granola bars and water.\n\n“It was a wild scene seeing cars stranded with a foot of snow between each of them... It was enough snow to snowmobile down the interstate,” he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWith a child of his own, he said “we know what that would be like,” to run out of baby formula. Luckily, the Rhynards still had some formula at their home and he was able to bring it to the family, telling the Chronicle he was happy to be close by and to be able to help them.\n\nThe Chronicle was unable to reach a media contact with Greyhound.\n\nAccording to the Gallatin County Sheriff’s Office, nobody was injured but motorists were stuck on the eastbound side of the highway for well over 10 hours, while the westbound lanes were partially open throughout the day. The standstill stretched for about 5 miles between the 19th Avenue exit in Bozeman and Jackson Creek Pass.\n\n“We ended up with a perfect storm, at the right time of year and the right amount of snow,” Gallatin County Undersheriff Jeremy Kopp said during a Wednesday evening press conference.\n\nBy 7 p.m. on Wednesday, those stuck between the Bear Canyon exit and the Trail Creek exit had been safely moved off the highway and the county sheriff’s office was continuing to support safety operations while the Montana Department of Transportation worked to clear the interstate.\n\nThree hours later, the sheriff office’s Facebook page notified the public that all lanes along I-90 over Bozeman Pass were open again and that traffic was flowing.\n\nGeno Liva, the Butte District administrator for the Montana Department of Transportation told the Chronicle that the reason why it took so long to clear the highway was that the department’s snowplows got stuck behind miles of traffic as the storm worsened and snow continued to accumulate.\n\n“We knew the storm was coming... I don’t know if we fully realized the intensity that it was going to hit,” Liva said. “We were spread out a little bit to stay on top of the storm of that magnitude that hit that fast... as soon as we got behind it, it ran over us pretty quick.”\n\n10 things out-of-towners learn quickly after moving to Montana\n\nMy wallet thanks you, Montana.\n\nIt's really cold here.\n\nEveryone knows everyone.\n\nImportant people live here (or have vacation homes here).\n\nMontana is huge.\n\nIf you’re not into the outdoors, Montana isn’t for you.\n\nThere are American big cities, and then there are Montana big cities.\n\nThe summers make up for the winters 10 times over and then some.\n\nPolitics as usual.\n\nMontana is absolutely gorgeous."
