        "meta_description": "This is the first study exclusively dedicated to the study of Hebeloma in Greenland. It is based on almost 400 collections, the great majority of which were collected by three of the co-authors over a period of 40 years and were lodged in the fungarium of the Natural History Museum in Copenhagen. The material was identified using molecular and morphological methods. In total, 28 species were recognized, 27 belonging to three sections, H. sects Hebeloma, Denudata and Velutipes. One species sampled was new to science and is here described as H. arcticum. For all species, a description, a distribution map within Greenland and macro and microphotographs are presented. A key is provided for the 28 species. The distribution of species within Greenland is discussed. The findings are placed in the context of studies of arctic and alpine Hebeloma from other parts of the world where comparable data exist. Notably, H. grandisporum, H. louiseae and H. islandicum, previously only known from Romania, Svalbard, Iceland or Norway, respectively, have been found in Greenland. The latter is also the only species encountered that does not belong to any of the above sections. Hebeloma excedens and H. colvinii – for the latter we here publish the first modern description – are to date only known from continental North America and now Greenland.",
