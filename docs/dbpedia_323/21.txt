The climate of Yekaterinburg (Russia)

Yekaterinburg is located in the southern part of Russia on the banks of the river Iset situated in the Asian part of the country. Yekaterinburg is the administrative center of the Sverdlovsk region. Between 1924 and 1991, the city was named Sverdlovsk. Yekaterinburg has played an important role in the history of Russia. Tsar Nicolas II Aleksandrovitsj was banned to this city. He and his family including his daughter Anastacia were murdered which meant the end of the Romanov dynasty. The Cathedral of blood or Church on the Blood was built on the place the Romanov family was executed. Yekaterinburg has a continental climate with distinct seasons. Summers are warm or even hot. Winters are extremely cold. Most of the rain falls during the summer. Because the city is situated at the foot of the Ural mountain range fierce winds are not uncommon in Yekaterinburg.

More climate information

Climate figures are very useful but dont present a general impression of the climate and the eventual weather circumstances within a certain period. The figures dont always reflect the chance of wintry weather, extreme heat or hurricanes. That is why we offer useful extra climate information for each month of the year:
