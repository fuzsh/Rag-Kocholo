        "text": "ON THIS DAY IN 1912, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported, “The Roosevelt campaign managers feel confident that they will capture at least seven of the Congressional districts in the Massachusetts campaign tomorrow. They seemed to be inclined, nevertheless, to believe that the Colonel may get two additional districts, which will split the national delegation from the Bay State in half. Taft may carry the state, as far as the popular vote is concerned, but the Roosevelt campaign managers declare that from a betting standpoint it is a 100 to 1 shot that he will not have the solid Massachusetts delegation to the Chicago convention.”\n\n***\n\nON THIS DAY IN 1928, the Eagle reported, “New York City today opened its arms wide in welcome to the first airplane fliers that safely crossed the North Atlantic from east to west. River craft sirens shrieked their welcome. Hoarse whistles of great liners in the bay roared their welcome. Airplanes overhead sailed and dipped a welcome. At the Battery, up Broadway and in and around City Hall Park, packed thousands shouted and waved and cheered and threw streams of joyous ticker tape from windows to show these men that New York was overjoyed that they had come through their adventure triumphant and alive. And at City Hall, on an outdoor platform in the view of hundreds of thousands shouting ‘Hoch!’ and ‘Go Bragh!’ Mayor Walker hailed them as men who had done a great deed in the interest of aviation and of science, and who were now welcomed by ‘all the peoples of New York.’ Here the city presented the three — Koehl, Fitzmaurice, Huenefeld — with embossed scrolls recording the occasion; and the State, through Maj. Gen. William N. Haskell, representing Governor Smith, who was ill, handed them gold medals of merit and honor for what they had done.”\n\n***\n\nON THIS DAY IN 1928, the Eagle reported, “ST. LOUIS (AP) — Col. Charles A. Lindbergh took the Spirit of St. Louis on its last flight today. He left Lambert-St. Louis Field at 9 a.m. for Washington, where the monoplane which spanned the Atlantic will be placed in the Smithsonian Institution as an exhibit along with other history-making airplanes. This will end the famous partnership of ‘We,’ composed of Colonel Lindbergh and his silver monoplane. The ship, which was flown slightly more than 40,000 miles under the hand of its famous pilot in a score of countries in its year of existence, carried Lindbergh through his epoch-making New York-to-Paris flight, a tour of the United States and Canada, and the goodwill flight to Latin America. Millions of people, craning to catch a glimpse of its flashing silver wings, have thrilled to the sound of its motor, knowing that it was part of a matchless combination that has written air history. Thousands of miniature copies were built for mantels of homes, show windows and public places. Built in San Diego, Cal., early last year, the trim monoplane first took flight under the hand of ‘Slim’ Lindbergh, then airmail pilot, and aspirant to transatlantic honors on May 11. A non-stop flight to St. Louis and then to New York brought Lindbergh and the Spirit of St. Louis to Roosevelt Field, L.I., where the takeoff on the New York-to-Paris flight was made May 20. After landing at Le Bourget Field on May 21, it was flown to Belgium, May 28, and to London, England, on the following day.”\n\n***\n\nON THIS DAY IN 1963, the Eagle reported, “A major league baseball contingent representing players of past and present vintage, and a mixture of high echelon executives headed by Commissioner Ford C. Frick, will participate in the official opening day dedication of Gil Hodges Field, new home of the South Highway Little League, this Saturday, starting at 10 a.m. This season will mark the 10th anniversary of the popular Borough group which has become a leader in sandlot little league baseball. The new twin fields constructed over the winter months by the adult members of the organization, and which must rank as the most modern in the Metropolitan area, are fitting tributes to Hodges, Brooklyn’s adopted son, who has become a symbol of fair play to every youngster who ever swung a bat in a local sandlot. The fields are complete with drainage and sprinkler systems, concrete spectator stands to accommodate 1,200 and a modern lighting plant for night baseball. Eighteen teams with an overall roster of more than 350 will play under the auspices of the league this summer.”\n\n***\n\nNOTABLE PEOPLE BORN ON THIS DAY include “Ringworld” author Larry Niven, who was born in 1938; baseball player and manager Phil Garner, who was born in 1949; Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, who was born in 1954; Basketball Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas, who was born in 1961; “Heroes” star Adrian Pasdar, who was born in 1965; former N.Y. Giants running back Dave Meggett, who was born in 1966; “The Big Bang Theory” star Johnny Galecki, who was born in 1975; The Dresden Dolls founder Amanda Palmer, who was born in 1976; “Spider-Man” star Kirsten Dunst, who was born in 1982; actor and singer Drew Seeley, who was born in 1982; “Wonder Woman” star Gal Gadot, who was born in 1985; “Glee” star Dianna Agron, who was born in 1986; “Blonde” star Ana de Armas, who was born in 1988; and N.Y. Rangers left-winger Chris Kreider, who was born in 1991.\n\n***\n\nSpecial thanks to “Chase’s Calendar of Events” and Brooklyn Public Library.\n\nQuotable:\n\n“I like the lasso of truth. There is something so beautiful about the fact that people have to tell the truth when they have the lasso around them.”\n\n— “Wonder Woman” star Gal Gadot, who was born on this day in 1985"
