        "text": "Well, I'm coming in way late to this party, but I just got around to listening to the best of the Brooklyn Bridge on Collectables. Now, everyone knows \"Worst That Could Happen\". Great song, great performance. But I always figured it was more the song and the producer than the singer, good though he was--a classic one hit wonder. (Yeah, I know they bubbled under with a few other tracks, but they never made the radio where I lived).\n\nBut after listening to the 12 track best-of, I realize this group was far better than a one hit wonder. I'd say half the collection is steller, and most of the rest is good. I could live without their version of \"Piece of My Heart\", but that's the only track I skip automatically in the car...\n\nOK, so my question is: Is the group deeper than the material on the greatest hits? Is it worth getting the 2 CD \"For Collectors Only\" comp on Collectables, which more than doubles the amount of material (although it repeats everything on the 1 CD best of, unfortunately).\n\nI'm not entirely satisfied with the sound quality of the Collectables best-of (no surprise; their collections are usually pretty lame unless their just reissues of stuff done elsewhere), and the liner notes are worthless...\n\nSo can someone comment on the Brooklyn Bridge discography? (I actually have 2-3 of those albums on vinyl somewhere, but they're buried so deep in the basement, I don't know when I'll ever find them!)\n\nI hear that Johnny Maestro is still good in concert. He sure had a good voice back then...\n\nKwad\n\nJohnny started with the Crests when he was 16...His voice is still incredible! The first BB Collectables re-issue was mastered from a crappy record! They later corrected it with the proper tape source. I've been eying that 2 BB set for years...not much BB available on Cee Dee . Johnny's voice is the key element in the BB...most of the key BB players still perform in the live shows! If you get the chance, check them out, you'll be floored! If you do pick up the FCO set, please let us know what you think."
