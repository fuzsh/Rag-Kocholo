        "text": "On a very cold wintry day, in Sussex County , New Jersey\n\nwe were warmed by the appearance at the Newton Theatre of\n\nNot the Brooklyn Bridge that spans the East River and\n\nconnects Brooklyn & Manhattan\n\n...but the Brooklyn Bridge musical group including\n\nthree remaining members from the original Brooklyn\n\nBridge, Rosica, Ruvio & Cauchi. Joe Esposito is the\n\nonly new face, a member of the Bridge about six\n\nyears! The rest of the band has been together longer\n\nthan most marriages, Jimmy Sarle, some forty years,\n\nMarty D'Amico, forty five years and Lou Agiesta,\n\nforty seven years.\n\nPhoto by Sonny Maxon\n\nThe Bridge Members Are Standing - Les Cauchi - Vocalist * Lou Agiesta - Drummer\n\nMartin D'Amico - Keyboard & Vocalist * Joe Ruvio - vocals, HHS 1966 Joe (Bean) Esposito - Lead Vocalist\n\nKneeling - James (Jim) Rosica - bass & vocals, HHS 1965 & James Sarle - Lead Guitarist HHS 1974\n\nWe had three Nor'easters in 2 weeks in March;\n\ntrees were on houses and on cars...\n\nroads still closed due to damage\n\nand power lines down; people were without electric\n\nand water for two weeks and there was three and a\n\nhalf feet of snow still on the ground.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge presented a show that lifted\n\npeoples spirits and made them forget about the past\n\nseveral weeks. As ticket holders were led to their seats,\n\nmany were somber and probably shell shocked by what\n\nthey had endured. Then it happened! On stage The Bridge\n\nbegan to perform and the audience transformation\n\nwas incredible.\n\nClick the below hyperlink to hear \"The Worst That Could Happen\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP6xaSSYCRM\n\nSmiles abounded, arms were waving and people were\n\nback in the late 60's and 70's. They forgot all their\n\nproblems - they forgot all the Nor'easters - they stepped\n\nout for an evening to forget it all and relived their youth.\n\nThe photographer I recruited to take candid photographs\n\nnoticed the change in everyone's demeanor. When the\n\nthrong of \"old timers\" left the theatre, they were singing & humming the songs of the past that was a big part of their\n\nlives.\n\nClick the below hyperlink to hear \"Unchained Melody\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BTw2heoKHA\n\nTheir songs were amazing and flawless. The energy\n\nwith which they performed was incredible. Don't\n\nforget, many of them are in their 60's & 70's but they\n\nseemed to feed off the energy of the audience.\n\nClick the below hyperlink to hear \"Step By Step & Sixteen Candles\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhgTp1BObh0\n\nHow were they originally named \"The Brooklyn Bridge\"?\n\nThe Manager of Johnny Maestro and The Del Satins,\n\na woman by the name of Betty Sperber, met with \"The Rhythm Method\" - Sullivan, Wood, Rosica, Ruvio,\n\nDavis & Catanzarita (All are Hicksville Grads) and Richie Macioce who hailed from Rockville Center. Betty Sperber asked if they would join with Johnny Maestro of the Crests, Fred Ferraro, Les Cauchi and Mike Gregorio from the Del Satins as a new group.\n\nBetty Sperber called Dave Zahn, President of Banner Talent to give him the news. When Dave Zahn heard there would be eleven members he replied \"trying to sell that is like trying to sell The Brooklyn Bridge\". Betty hangs up the phone and says to Jim and Tommy the name of the group is The Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nShown below is James Sarle who is also a Hicksville Grad and is in the current Brooklyn Bridge\n\nTom Sullivan Carolyn Wood Jim Rosica Joe Ruvio\n\nShelley Davis Artie Catanzarita James Sarle\n\nAfter Johnny Maestro and Fred Ferraro passed on\n\nthe remaining group members decided to be continue\n\nAs \"The Brooklyn Bridge \". After their show at the Newton\n\nI had a chance to speak with some of the group and had\n\na photo taken with them."
