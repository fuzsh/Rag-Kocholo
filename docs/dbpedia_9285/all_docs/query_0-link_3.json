        "text": "Johnny Maestro, the pure-toned tenor who as the lead singer for the Crests, the Del-Satins and the Brooklyn Bridge recorded rock ’n’ roll hits like “Sixteen Candles” and “The Worst That Could Happen,” died Wednesday at his home in Cape Coral, Fla. He was 70 and had lived in Islip, N.Y., until seven years ago.\n\nThe cause was cancer, said Les Cauchi, an original member of the Brooklyn Bridge, which continues to perform before graying audiences, swaying to the tunes of their teenage years.\n\n“The original Brooklyn Bridge had 11 members, singing and playing,” Mr. Cauchi said. “Now there are six members, without Johnny.”\n\nThe Bridge, as the group is often called, was a merger in 1968 of two bands, the Del-Satins and the Rhythm Method. It was originally billed as Johnny Maestro, the Del-Satins and the Rhythm Method. A bit too bulky.\n\n“So we decided we’d pick a new one,” Mr. Maestro told The New York Times in 1994. “We were sitting around the office, and someone said: ‘This is going to be difficult. We have 11 people. That’s hard to sell. It’s easier to sell the Brooklyn Bridge.’ We said, ‘That’s the name!’ ”\n\nWith their strong vocal and horn arrangements, the Bridge recorded a series of hits, including “Welcome Me Love,” “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and “Your Husband, My Wife.” But lightning struck for the band with the songwriter Jimmy Webb’s “Worst That Could Happen.”\n\nIn December 1968, the Brooklyn Bridge performed the song on “The Ed Sullivan Show” (with Mr. Sullivan mispronouncing Mr. Maestro’s name as MAY-stroh, not MY-stroh). In the song, a man sings about the impending marriage of a woman he still loves, and reluctantly wishes her well.\n\n“If he loves you more than me,” Mr. Maestro sings, “maybe it’s the best thing, maybe it’s the best thing for you, but it’s the worst that could happen to me.”\n\nThat Sullivan show appearance, Mr. Cauchi said, “launched our career.”\n\nMr. Maestro’s career had taken off before. In the late 1950s he was the lead singer for the Crests, fronting hits like “Sixteen Candles,” “Trouble in Paradise,” “The Angels Listened In” and “Step by Step.”\n\nJohn Peter Mastrangelo was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan on May 7, 1939, one of three children of Salvatore and Grace Mastrangelo. He is survived by his wife, Grace; his brother, Ronald; two daughters, Tracy and Lisa; a son, Brad; and four grandchildren.\n\nThe Crests were a band of street kids from the Lower East Side, and quite a mix. “There were three blacks, one Puerto Rican,” Mr. Maestro said, “and I was the Eye-talian.” They performed at parties and dances and rode the subway for the drop of a few coins. One day a rider handed them a business card; that led to a record contract.\n\nOn the Coed label, they recorded “Beside You.”\n\n“The B side was ‘Sixteen,’ ” Mr. Maestro said. “Who knew?”"
