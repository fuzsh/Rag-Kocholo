        "text": "Co-heading the Oldies Spectacular, this band is sure to keep your head bobbing.\n\nFormed by combining the Crests’ lead singer, Johnny Maestro, the Del-Satins (Dion’s backup singers) and the horn players from the Rhythm Method, they had many hits in the late 1960’s, including “The Worst That Could Happen” (#3 on the charts), “Welcome me Love,” “Blessed is the Rain,” “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and “Your Husband, My Wife.” The world lost the incomparable Johnny Maestro (“16 Candles,” “The Angels Listened In” and “Step by Step”) fifteen years ago, but Joe Esposito in an amazing lead singer. He performed “Lady, Lady, Lady” in the hit movie “Flashdance” and “You’re the Best” in “Karate Kid” and collaborated with Donna Summer on “Heaven Knows” and “Bad Girls.”"
