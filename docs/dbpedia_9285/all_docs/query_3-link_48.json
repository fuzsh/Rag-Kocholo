        "text": "The Brooklyn Bridge\n\nOn a very cold wintry day, in Sussex County, New Jersey we were warmed by the appearance at the Newton Theatre of The Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nNot the Brooklyn Bridge that spans the East River and connects Brooklyn & Manhattan, but The Brooklyn Bridge musical group including three remaining members from the original Brooklyn Bridge, Rosica, Ruvio & Cauchi. Joe Esposito is the only new face, a member of the Bridge about six years! The rest of the band has been together longer than most marriages, Jimmy Sarle, some forty years, Marty D'Amico, forty five years and Lou Agiesta, forty seven years.\n\nThe Bridge Members Are\n\nStanding - Les Cauchi - Vocalist * Lou Agiesta - Drummer\n\nMartin D'Amico - Keyboard & Vocalist * Joe Ruvio - vocals, HHS 1966 Joe (Bean) Esposito - Lead Vocalist\n\nKneeling - James (Jim) Rosica - bass & vocals, HHS 1965 & James Sarle - Lead Guitarist HHS 1974\n\nWe had three Nor'easters in 2 weeks in March. Trees were on houses and on cars, roads were still closed due to damage, and power lines down. People were without electric and water for two weeks and there were three and a half feet of snow still on the ground.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge presented a show that lifted peoples spirits and made them forget about the past several weeks. As ticket holders were led to their seats, many were somber and probably shell shocked by what they had endured. Then it happened! On stage The Bridge began to perform and the audience transformation was incredible.\n\nSmiles abounded, arms were waving and people were back in the late 60's and 70's. They forgot all their problems - they forgot all the Nor'easters - they stepped out for an evening to forget it all and relived their youth. The photographer I recruited to take candid photographs noticed the change in everyone's demeanor. When the throng of \"old timers\" left the theatre, they were singing & humming the songs of the past that was a big part of their lives.\n\nTheir songs were amazing and flawless. The energy with which they performed was incredible. Don't forget, many of them are in their 60's & 70's but they seemed to feed off the energy of the audience.\n\nHow were they originally named \"The Brooklyn Bridge\"? The Manager of Johnny Maestro and The Del Satins, a woman by the name of Betty Sperber, met with \"The Rhythm Method\" - Sullivan, Wood, Rosica, Ruvio, Davis & Catanzarita (All are Hicksville Grads) and Richie Macioce who hailed from Rockville Center. Betty Sperber asked if they would join with Johnny Maestro of the Crests, Fred Ferraro, Les Cauchi and Mike Gregorio from the Del Satins as a new group.\n\nBetty Sperber called Dave Zahn, President of Banner Talent to give him the news. When Dave Zahn heard there would be eleven members he replied \"trying to sell that is like trying to sell The Brooklyn Bridge\". Betty hangs up the phone and says to Jim and Tommy the name of the group is The Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nShown below is James Sarle who is also a Hicksville Grad and is in the current Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nAfter Johnny Maestro and Fred Ferraro passed on, the remaining group members decided to be continue As \"The Brooklyn Bridge \". After their show at the Newton I had a chance to speak with some of the group and had a photo taken with them.\n\nI can never thank them enough for what they did for the people this evening. I am sure to them it was just another gig; however, to us nothing could have been better for our spirits.\n\nWell Done - Thank you \"The Bridge\"!!!\n\n~ Linda Piccerelli Hayden, Class of 1960"
