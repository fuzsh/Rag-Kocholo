        "text": "Singer Johnny Maestro, who performed the 1958 doo-wop hit “16 Candles” with The Crests and enjoyed a decades-long career with The Brooklyn Bridge, has died of cancer. He was 70.\n\nLes Cauchi, a friend and original Brooklyn Bridge member, said Maestro — born in Brooklyn as John Mastrangelo — died late Wednesday in Florida.\n\nAfter beginning his career in the 1950s with The Crests — one of the first interracial singing groups — Maestro joined a local New York group, The Del-Satins. It merged with a Long Island band, The Rhythm Method, to form Johnny Maestro and The Brooklyn Bridge in 1968.\n\nHits by the rock ‘n’ roll and doo-wop group included “The Worst That Could Happen,” which earned “gold record” status with a million sales.\n\n“Johnny was a class act. He was truly a gentleman,” singer Dion DiMucci said on Facebook. “He sang ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ like an angel . . . We thank you for the beautiful trip you took us on. Love and peace.”"
