        "text": "The Brooklyn Bridge\n\nis a pop group from Long Island, New York. The group was made up of a vocal quartet and a seven-piece band. The Del-Satins are Johnny Maestro-lead vocals. Johnny who needs no introduction was the lead singer of the fabulous “Crests”. Other members of the Del-Satins include Fred Ferrara, Les Cauchi and Mike Gregorie. The Rhythm Method are Richie Macioce, Tom Sullivan, Joe Ruvio, Shelly Davis, Carolyn Wood, Jimmy Rosica and Artie Catanzarita. Together they formed The Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nOn December 21, 1968 the group charted their first hit record. “WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN” on Buddah Records was a very successful single. It was a #3 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 1 million records, earning the new group a “Gold Record”. Johnny Maestro’s vocals soared over the beautiful arrangement and full horn section to propel this record to the top. “Worst That Could Happen” was on the Hot 100 for 12 weeks.`\n\nIn March of 1969 The Brooklyn Bridge would chart their next hit record, “BLESSED IS THE RAIN”. The single would climb the Hot 100 to the #45 spot on the Hot 100. The “B” side of the single was “WELCOME ME LOVE”. As “Blessed Is The Rain” was falling on the chart, radio stations turned the record over and found “Welcome Me Love”, it entered the Hot 100 on May 10, 1969 and found its own market on its way to #48 and was actually on the Hot 100 for 9 weeks, 3 weeks longer that the “A” side.\n\nIn July another Brooklyn Bridge record made its chart debut. “YOUR HUSBAND-MY WIFE”, began a climb up the chart to #46. To close out 1969 a dramatic version of “YOU’LL NEVER WALK ALONE” became a hit in October, the record peaked at #51. The Brooklyn Bridge charted Hot 100 hits through 1970. By 1972 they had sold over 10 million records and had made appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and other top TV programs. The group was featured on Doo-Wop 50, on PBS. They performed 16 Candles and “The Worst That Could Happen”. The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall Of Fame in 2005 and into the South Carolina Music Hall Of Fame in 2006 and into the Long Island Music Hall Of Fame in 2006.\n\nThe lead voice of The Crests and The Brooklyn Bridge, Johnny Maestro lost his battle with cancer on March 24, 2010 at the age of 70. To say he’ll be missed is so understated, his beautiful voice and passion for his music and his love for his fans, well you just can’t put that in words. He is one of the greatest voices from the “Golden Era of Rock and Roll”. (Source: Joe Troiano‘s Blog)"
