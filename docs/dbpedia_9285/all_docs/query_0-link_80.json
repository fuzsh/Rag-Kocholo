        "text": "1955: Elvis Presley performed at the Peabody Auditorium in Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\n1955: Although \"Rock Around The Clock\" was not a hit when released the year before, it had picked up renewed interest by virtue of its inclusion in the movie The Blackboard Jungle, and was consequently re-released by Bill Haley & His Comets. And a new era was born. If you like rock music in any of its forms, you have this song to thank. It convinced DJ's, radio station management, and most importantly executives at record companies that rock & roll was a viable form of music.\n\n1958: The Champs performed their #1 smash \"Tequila\" on American Bandstand.\n\n1964: The Searchers scored their third #1 song in the U.K. with \"Don't Throw Your Love Away\".\n\n1966: The Rolling Stones released the single \"Paint It Black\" in the United States.\n\n1966: The #1 album continued to be Going Places by Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass, followed closely by the group's Whipped Cream & Other Delights. Color Me Barbra by Barbra Streisand was #3. The rest of the Top 10: Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass) by the Rolling Stones, the Soundtrack to \"The Sound of Music\" was #5, Ballads of the Green Berets by SSgt. Barry Sadler fell to #6, Nancy Sinatra had #7 with Boots, the Supremes' I Hear a Symphony was #8, The Dave Clark Five's Greatest Hits was #9 and If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears by the Mamas and the Papas was #10.\n\n1966: The Percy Sledge classic \"When A Man Loves A Woman\" was on top for the first of four weeks on the R&B chart.\n\nBoise, Idaho's Paul Revere & the Raiders...\n\n1966: The Mamas and the Papas rose to #1 with \"Monday, Monday\", displacing \"Good Lovin'\" by the Young Rascals. \"Sloop John B\" by the Beach Boys was #3, followed by \"(You're My) Soul And Inspiration\" from the Righteous Brothers and \"Kicks\", the great anti-drug song by Paul Revere & the Raiders.\n\n1967: Jimi Hendrix played two concerts at Brian Epstein's Saville Theatre in London.\n\n1968: Aretha Franklin recorded a live album at the Olympia Theatre in Paris, France.\n\n1968: Reginald Dwight changed his name to Elton John. (Note: some websites insist this happened in 1972. The na√Øve website owners just might be tipped off by the 1969 album 'Empty Sky', which just happens to be the debut solo release by Elton John. 'Gold Mine' magazine and the newspaper 'The Examiner' are among the credible sources which confirm the correct year as 1968.)\n\n1970: The fabulous Temptations released the single \"Ball Of Confusion\".\n\n1970: Pink Floyd performed at the home of UCLA, Pauley Pavilion, in Los Angeles.\n\n1971: Three Dog Night chalked up a fourth week at #1 with \"Joy To The World\".

The Soundtrack to A Star Is Born was third with Marvin Gaye Live at the London Palladium in fourth. Stevie Wonder's epic Songs in the Key of Life edged out the debut from Boston--three of the all-time Top 10 albums were out at the same glorious time. The rest of the Top 10: The Soundtrack to \"Rocky\", the Isley Brothers with Go For Your Guns, Jethro Tull edged up with Songs from the Wood and Kansas grabbed #10 with Leftoverture.\n\n1977: The Eagles moved to #1 with \"Hotel California\". Leo Sayer was right behind \"When I Need You\" while previous #1 \"Southern Nights\" from Glen Campbell slipped. Stevie Wonder's \"Sir Duke\" was hot (moving 9-4), former #1 \"Don't Leave Me This Way\" from Thelma Houston came in fifth and newcomer Jennifer Warnes had \"Right Time Of The Night\".

Sure! was #1 on the R&B chart.\n\n1988: Terence Trent D'Arby reached #1 in his 17th week with \"Wishing Well\".

(Note: several websites claim that Taylor and Cole received their degrees on May 6. This is impossible, since the official website for Berklee reports that the commencement ceremony in 1995 was held May 7. Taylor and Cole received their honorary degrees on that date.)\n\n1998: Steve Perry left Journey to embark on a solo career.\n\n1998: Eddie Rabbitt died of lung cancer in Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 56.\n\n1999: Lisa Stansfield made her acting debut in the U.K. comedy Swing at Leicester Square in London.\n\n2002: Stanley, Idaho's Carole King was a guest star for a third time on the WB Networks show Gilmore Girls.\n\n2003: TNT and TBS announced they had signed Justin Timberlake to cover sports for the two cable channels.
