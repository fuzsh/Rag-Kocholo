        "text": "American doo-wop and pop singer (1939–2010)\n\nMusical artist\n\nJohn Peter Mastrangelo (May 7, 1939 – March 24, 2010), known as Johnny Maestro, was an American pop singer. He was the lead vocalist for the doo-wop group The Crests, whose song \"16 Candles\" went to number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[1] He later lead The Brooklyn Bridge, who are best known for their cover of the Jimmy Webb song \"Worst That Could Happen\".\n\nMaestro continued singing as frontman for the Brooklyn Bridge. With this group, they were inducted into three major music hall of fames. After his death from cancer in 2010, a section of Mason and Midland avenue in Staten Island was remained to \"Johnny Maestro Way\" in his honor in 2011.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Peter Mastrangelo was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City on May 7, 1939, one of three children of Salvatore and Grace Mastrangelo.[2] Salvatore was born on December 17, 1913, and died on December 26, 1994, also in New York. Grace was born on April 27, 1913, in America and died on April 15, 1993, in New York. His paternal grandparents were Giovanni \"John\" Mastrangelo (born November 17, 1887, in Italy – died June 1964 in Staten Island) and Porcia Maria \"Mary\" Mastrangelo (née Morano) (born January 8, 1888, in Italy – died August 1978 in Staten Island).\n\nOne of his main influences was singer Johnnie Ray: \"When I was a youngster, I would listen to him, he was one of the first white soul singers. He put a lot of feeling into his songs and let it all hang out. I would also listen to Alan Freed, and the groups that really impressed me were Willie Winfield and the Harptones, the Flamingos and the Moonglows. It was such a great sound. I really got into harmonies.\"[3]\n\nMastrangelo graduated from Charles Evans Hughes High School (later renamed to Bayard Rustin Educational Complex[4]) in 1956.[5] He then attended Borough of Manhattan Community College.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Crests\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1956, seventeen-year old Mastrangelo (performing as Johnny Maestro) formed The Crests. The band was formed by J.T. Carter and other street kids living in Manhattan, including first tenor Talmadge “Tommy” Gough, second tenor Harold Torres, and tenor Patricia Van Dross (the older sister to Luther Vandross), all residents of the Alfred E. Smith housing project in the lower east side of Manhattan.[3] In 1956, Mastrangelo, who lived on nearby Mulberry Street, met the group at the Henry Street Settlement House. \"The three background singers had originally formed the group themselves. When I met them, they were learning harmonies from a gospel singer. They were looking for a lead singer, and they lived in the same neighborhood as I did. They had heard I was singing with a couple of friends in the neighborhood, approached me and asked if I would sing with them. I was very impressed with the sound they were getting and joined them. We’d sing in the park and at dances and on the trains.\"[3]\n\nIn 1958, they recorded the song \"16 Candles\", that went to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 that same year.[1] They were one of the first multi-racial groups. In just more than four years, the group placed 13 records on Billboard's pop chart, six inside the Top 20 including \"Step By Step\" and \"The Angels Listened In\", defining examples of the rock ’n’ roll vocal group genre.[3] At one point, it was said that Tony Orlando was a member of the Crests.[6] After leaving the Crests in the early 1960s, Maestro performed briefly as a solo singer.[5]\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1968, Maestro joined The Del-Satins. The same year, Maestro combined the Del-Satins, and Long Island group The Rhythm Method to become the group The Brooklyn Bridge. Johnny told The New York Times in 1994 about choosing the name \"Brooklyn Bridge\": \"So we decided we’d pick a new one, we were sitting around the office, and someone said: ‘This is going to be difficult. We have 11 people. That’s hard to sell. It’s easier to sell the Brooklyn Bridge.’ We said, ‘That’s the name!’\".[2]\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge (also credited as \"Johnny Maestro and the Brooklyn Bridge\", \"Johnny and the Bridge\" and \"The Bridge\") rehearsed their unusual combination of smooth vocal harmonies and full horns, and signed a recording contract with Buddah Records.[7] Their first release, a version of the Jimmy Webb song \"Worst That Could Happen\" (previously recorded by The 5th Dimension), reached No. 3 on the Billboard pop chart.[7] It sold over one and a quarter million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A.[8] The follow-up, \"Welcome Me Love\", and its flip side, \"Blessed is the Rain\" — both by Tony Romeo —[9] each reached the Top 50. A dramatic version of \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" and the controversial \"Your Husband, My Wife\" also reached the middle ranges of the chart. The group sold over 10 million records by 1972, including LP sales, mostly produced by Wes Farrell. Appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Della Reese Show, and other programs helped to bring the group to the national stage.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge performed Worst That Could Happen on the Ed Sullivan Show in December 1968. Host Ed Sullivan mispronounced Maestro's surname as MAY-stroh instead of MY-stroh.[2] At first, the Bridge had eleven members, but after the fame of \"Worst That Could Happen\" started to die down, the guitarists, bassist, organist, and brass members were kicked out, and Maestro, the three backing vocalists, and the drummers remained, and all but the latter began playing additional instruments on stage. Johnny played rhythm guitar on stage. Maestro carried on with the Brooklyn Bridge, despite the band claiming a one-hit wonder status.\n\nIn the following decades, the Brooklyn Bridge performed at many fundraising events on Staten Island such as the Borough President's \"Back to the Beach'' concert. He also performed for the New York City Fire Department and Police Department, the United States Military, Italian American Association, as well as church and school fundraisers.[5] He performed on the Jerry Lewis Telethon.\n\nWhen Johnny died in 2010, the band carried on without him in his honor, and his spot as lead vocalist was replaced by Joe Esposito, best known for his song \"You're the Best\", featured in the 1984 film The Karate Kid.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nHis first wife was Alma Jean Degler Mastrangelo-Ferguson, who he married in 1964. She was born on November 24, 1942, in Middletown, Pennsylvania and died on July 5, 2000, in Billings, Montana. He married his second wife, Grace, in December 1985.[10] They remained married until Johnny's death.\n\nMaestro was a Humanitarian.[5]\n\nJohnny lived in Islip, New York until 2003, when he moved to Cape Coral, Florida, where he died of kidney cancer on March 24, 2010.[2] He was 70. He is survived by his wife Grace and three children Lisa, Brad, and Tracy.[2] He had been diagnosed with the cancer in 2009. His last performance was at Connecticut's Mohegan Sun Arena in January 2010, nine weeks before his death, as part of Bowzer's Rock ’N’ Roll Party.[3]\n\nJohnny had kept his illness hidden from the public.[11] Brooklyn Bridge bassist Jim Rosica said: \"He was frail and a little jaundiced, and he had torn the ligaments in his shoulder, so he had his arm in a sling underneath his jacket, we hadn’t disclosed to anyone that he had cancer, but it didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out something was seriously wrong. But when Johnny went onstage, he just nailed it.\"[3]\n\n\"The Great Physician\", a song Maestro recorded in 1960, was believed to be lost for more than fifty years, before a record of it was recovered. It was showcased in the \"From the Vault\" series that focuses on Coed Records’ lost master tapes.[3]\n\nHonors\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2005.[12][13] They were inducted into the South Carolina Music (Rhythm & Blues) Hall of Fame in May 2006 and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on October 15, 2006.[5]\n\nOn March 26, 2011, the City of New York honored him by renaming the intersection of Mason Avenue and Midland Avenue on Staten Island as \"Johnny Maestro Way\".[5][14]\n\nOn May 9, 2012, Johnny Maestro was honored by the House of Representatives of the United States of America. Congressman Jerrold Nadler of New York, whose district includes the neighborhood where Maestro was born and where he began his music career, introduced an Extension of Remarks in the House of Representatives. This posthumous honor is now a permanent part of the Congressional Record. The Extension of Remarks includes the original members of The Crests.[15]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Crests' singles\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Peak chart positions Record label Notes US Hot 100 US R&B A: \"Sweetest One\"\n\nB: \"My Juanita\"\n\n1957 86 — Joyce Recorded in early 1957\n\nRecorded in early 1957\n\nA: \"No One To Love\"\n\nB: \"Wish She Was Mine\"\n\n1957 — — Recorded on May 22, 1957,\n\nRecorded on May 22, 1957\n\nA: \"Pretty Little Angel\"\n\nB: \"I Thank The Moon\"\n\n1958 — — Coed Recorded on June 25, 1958,\n\nRecorded on June 25, 1958\n\nA: \"16 Candles\" (originally the B-side)\n\nB: \"Beside You\"\n\n1958 2[16] 4 Recorded on August 12, 1958,\n\nRecorded on June 25, 1958\n\nA: \"Six Nights A Week\"\n\nB: \"I Do\"\n\n1959 28 17 Recorded on January 14, 1959,\n\nRecorded on January 14, 1959\n\nA: \"Flower Of Love\"\n\nB: \"Molly Mae\"\n\n1959 79 — Recorded on January 14, 1959,\n\nRecorded on August 12, 1958\n\nA: \"The Angels Listened In\"\n\nB: \"I Thank The Moon\"\n\n1959 22 14 Recorded on March 24, 1959,\n\nRecorded on June 25, 1958\n\nA: \"A Year Ago Tonight\"\n\nB: \"Paper Crown\"\n\n1959 42 — Recorded on October 11, 1959,\n\nRecorded on October 11, 1959\n\nA: \"Step By Step\"\n\nB: \"Gee (But I'd Give The World)\"\n\n1960 14 — Recorded on January 18, 1960,\n\nRecorded on January 18, 1960\n\nA: \"Trouble In Paradise\"\n\nB: \"Always You\"\n\n1960 20 — Recorded on May 4, 1960,\n\nRecorded on May 4, 1960\n\nA: \"Journey Of Love\"\n\nB: \"If My Heart Could Write A Letter\"\n\n1960 81 — Recorded on January 18, 1960,\n\nRecorded on May 4, 1960\n\nA: \"Isn't It Amazing\"\n\nB: \"Molly Mae\"\n\n1960 100 — Recorded on May 4, 1960,\n\nRecorded on August 12, 1958\n\nA: \"I'll Remember (In The Still Of The Night)\"\n\nB: \"Good Golly Miss Molly\"\n\n1960 — — Recorded on March 24, 1959 A: \"Say It Isn't So\"\n\nB: \"The Great Physician\"\n\n1960 — — Recorded on January 18, 1960,\n\nRecorded on January 18, 1960\n\nA: \"Model Girl\"\n\nB: \"We've Got To Tell Them\"\n\n1961 20 — Recorded on December 29, 1960,\n\nRecorded on December 29, 1960\n\nA: \"What A Surprise\"\n\nB: \"The Warning Voice\"\n\n1961 33 — Recorded on December 19, 1960,\n\nRecorded on December 29, 1960\n\nA: \"Little Miracles\"\n\nB: \"Baby I Gotta' Know\"\n\n1961 — — Recorded late 1961, released December 1961;\n\nTony Middleton singing lead\n\nA: \"The Actor\"\n\nB: \"Three Tears In A Bucket\"\n\n1962 — — Trans Atlas James Ancrum singing lead A: \"Guilty\"\n\nB: \"Number One With Me\"\n\n1962 — — Selma James Ancrum singing lead A: \"Did I Remember\"\n\nB: \"Tears Will Fall\"\n\n1963 — — James Ancrum singing lead A: \"A Love To Last A Lifetime\"\n\nB: \"You Blew Out The Candles\"\n\n1964 — — Coral James Ancrum singing lead\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge discography\n\n[edit]\n\n(See full discography at The Brooklyn Bridge discography)\n\nSelected singles\n\n\"Worst That Could Happen\" (1968)\n\n\"Welcome Me Love\" (1969)\n\n\"You'll Never Walk Alone\" (1969)\n\nSelected albums\n\n\"Brooklyn Bridge\" (1968)\n\n\"The Second Brooklyn Bridge\" (1969)\n\n\"The Bridge in Blue\" (1972)\n\n\"For Collectors Only\" (1992)\n\n\"Johnny Maestro and The Brooklyn Bridge\" (1993)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nAdditional\n\n[edit]"
