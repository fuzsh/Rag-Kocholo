        "text": "He collaborated with Donna Summer on “Bad Girls.” He sang “You’re the Best Around” on the original 1980s hit movie, “The Karate Kid.” Now he fronts the band formerly led by the late Johnny Maestro, which still plays about 30 concerts a year across the country.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge Band is bringing its show to Tyrone on May 6 for the 16th annual Tyrone-Snyder Township Public Library fundraiser, and Joe Esposito promised “just good-time music.”\n\n“They’ll want to get up and dance,” said Esposito, lead singer. “They’ll have a lot of fun.”\n\nConcert organizer Chuck Banas said the concert at the Tyrone Area High School Auditorium typically sells out fast. The $35 tickets are available from the library or by calling (814) 684-2030.\n\n“The auditorium seats slightly over 1,000,” Banas said. “It is suggested that tickets are purchased as soon as possible.\n\nEsposito said the shows reflect the history of the band as well as his personal career.\n\nOriginally known simply as The Brooklyn Bridge, the group was formed in 1968 by Maestro, who was known for his early recordings, including “16 Candles,” with one of the first racially integrated groups named The Crests.\n\nThe band remained active through 2010, when Maestro died, and reorganized in 2013 when Esposito joined.\n\n“The band feels that the responsibility to carry on the music is something that cannot be ignored,” according to its website.\n\nEsposito’s own career as a singer and songwriter had early success. In addition to Donna Summer, he collaborated with the likes of Aretha Franklin, Stephen Stills and others.\n\nWhat was the highlight?\n\n“It’s all a highlight,” he said. “Donna Summer, Brenda Russell, Sylvester Stallone. It’s all part of the experience. The D onna Summer stuff was great, wonderful.”\n\nJoining The Brooklyn Bridge Band made for a great union, he added.\n\n“Because of Johnny Maestro, people followed us for 40 years. We’ve got some die-hard fans,” he said. “Some people know me through (the 1983 hit musical film) ‘Flashdance,’ ‘The Karate Kid.'”\n\nHe said the band’s current sets include “a lot of the old stuff,” such as Ike and Tina Turner’s “River Beat — Mountain High” from 1966 and “Take Me in Your Arms” by the Doobie Brothers from 1975.\n\n“A little bit of rock, a little bit of doo-wop, some pop,” Esposito said. “Most of our fans are doo-wop hardcore fans and it’s an older audience. But we’re getting some younger ones, too.”\n\nBanas said it’s a great opportunity to enjoy quality entertainment while helping a good cause.\n\nHe said the annual concerts have raised nearly $300,000 in the first 15 years to help retire the mortgage on the new public library in downtown Tyrone. The shows previously featured The Drifters, The Letterman, the Four Seasons and other nationally known groups.\n\nDoors open at 6:30 p.m. with Ricky Howsare, a regional vocal talent from Bedford, taking the stage an hour later. Afterward, Howsare and The Brooklyn Bridge Band members will participate in a meet-and-greet, according to Banas.\n\n“My goal since the very first concert has been to give those who are giving their money to support the public library something of quality in return and the community as a whole the chance to hear, see and meet all of these nationally famous groups right here in Tyrone while paying down the mortgage on the library at the same time,” he said.\n\n“Come join us for a tremendous evening of entertainment and support a public library at the same time.”\n\nMirror Staff Writer Cherie Hicks is at 949-7030.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Brooklyn Bridge Band in concert, with Ricky Howsare\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. May 6\n\nWhere: Tyrone Area High School Auditorium\n\nAdmission: $35\n\nTickets: Tyrone-Snyder Township Public Library or by calling (814) 684-2030"
