Johnny Maestro would have been 70 years old at the time of his death.\n\nWho was johnny maestro first wife?\n\nMy best friend Angela DeSimone was Johnny Maestro's cousin. We would go and listen to him rehearse at his house in Staten Island (1964) and that is where I met his first wife, Alma-Jean.\n\nDo you have any idea what happened to Eddie Liscandro who used to be with Johnny Maestro and the Brooklyn Bridge?\n\nI read that Ed developed cancer and stopped performing, except for something big, like the Long Island Music Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Johnny Maestro and The Brooklyn Bridge were inducted in October 2006 (past and current members).\n\nList of johnny Maestro greatest hits?\n\nThe Crests: 16 Candles Step by Step Trouble in Paradis The Angels Listened In Six Nights a Week\n\nHow many years was johnny maestro married to first wife?\n\nGo to Johnny's Legacy.com memorial and view the photos. I think the attractive dark haired lady who is in a couple of the photos with Johnny is probably is his wife."
