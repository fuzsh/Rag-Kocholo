        "text": "In the South The Crests were refused service in diners and Maestro had to sleep at a hotel with the white artists and his group in another with the black artists. “I couldn’t believe it,” said Maestro. “And there was nothing I could do about it.”\n\nAt a rock and roll seminar held recently at Long Island University, members of many early R&B groups such as the Teenagers and The Willows were in attendance. One of the guys told a story about the time Bo Diddley had to go to the black hotel where Maestro had decided to stay with his group to tell him that the locals were coming to get him. According to the story, Bo put Johnny in the trunk of his car and drove him to the safety of the “white-only” hotel.\n\nThe Crests followed up the success of “16 Candles,” with “Step by Step,” “The Angels Listened In,” and “Trouble in Paradise,” but in ‘61 Maestro left for a solo career. “Nobody really knew what to do with us” he stated. “We were integrated. We couldn’t appear on television together.”\n\nAs a solo artist he signed with the Coed label and The Crests continued to back him vocally. He had three singles on the charts: the Top 20, “Model Girl,” the Top 40, “What a Surprise,” and the lesser entry, “Mr. Happiness.”\n\nAround this time there was another group consisting of Les Cauchi (first tenor), Keith Koestner (second tenor), Fred Ferrara (baritone), his brother Tom Ferrara (bass), and Stan Ziska (lead vocals) called The Del-Satins. They put their name together as a tribute to The Dells and The Five Satins.\n\nThe Del-Satins\n\nTheir manager heard that Dion, who had split with The Belmonts, was looking for a new backup group to record with and The Del-Satins auditioned with a tune called “Beside My Love.” A short time later Dion and the group recorded the #1 smash hit, \"Runaround Sue,\" which was followed by “The Wanderer,” “Lovers Who Wander,” “Little Diane,” “Love Came to Me,” “Ruby Baby,” “Donna the Prima Donna,” and “Drip Drop.” Dion and the Del-Satins were a winning combination yet the backup singers never received any credit as these were Dion’s solo hits.\n\nThe group became regulars on the extremely popular Clay Cole TV Show and released the single, “Teardrops Follow Me” which went Top 10 in several Eastern cities.\n\n\"Teardrops Follow Me\" by The Del-Satins\n\nWhat happened next is rock and roll history. On the concert DVD titled, \"Johnny Maestro and The Brooklyn Bridge – Pop Legends Live,\" the group explains how they got together.\n\nThe members of the Del-Satins used to play a lot of basketball and in between periods they sang doo wop in the bathrooms. As Kenny Vance sings, they were “looking for an echo.” In the mid 60’s they were also looking for a new lead singer as Les Cauchi recalls, “We walked into this gym and we saw this guy singing on stage all by himself, plucking away on his guitar. It was Johnny Maestro.”\n\nThey asked if he’d like to join the group. At first he turned them down, but later he changed his mind. For the next few years they were backed by a guitarist and a drummer. Then they found a seven piece horn group and Maestro explains, “We decided to merge.”\n\nImpressed with each other's skills and talents, The Del-Satins and the Rhythm Method decided to join forces, but there was still one unresolved task, and that was coming up with a name for the newly-formed unit. From The New York Times: “We were sitting around the office and someone said: 'this is going to be difficult. We have 11 people. That’s a hard sell. It’s easier to sell The Brooklyn Bridge.' We said, “That’s the name.”\n\nThe original Brooklyn Bridge featured a solid brass musical backing along with beautiful and amazing harmonies behind Maestro's powerful vocals. It consisted of Johnny Maestro (lead vocals), Les Cauchi (vocals), Fred Ferrara (vocals), Mike Gregario (vocals), Tom Sullivan (sax), Shelly Davis (trumpet & Piano), Carolyn Wood (organ), Jimmy Rosica (bass), Richie Macioce (guitar), Artie Cantanza (drums), and Joe Ruvio (sax).\n\nThey became a hot attraction especially at The Cheetah, one of the hippest nightclubs in Manhattan at the time. Wes Farrell who was involved with The Cowsills and The Partridge Family wanted to produce the band and Neil Bogart signed them to Buddah Records in ‘68. Their first single was Jim Webb’s dramatic ballad, “The Worst That Could Happen,” a tune recorded by The Fifth Dimension on their “The Magic Garden” LP. Maestro said, “I liked The Fifth Dimension. We took the song and put our own arrangement on it.”\n\nThe band appeared on several TV shows including The Ed Sullivan Show which helped attain the group a national audience and within weeks their version of “The Worst That Could Happen” soared to the #3 spot on the Billboard Pop Charts.\n\nThe first two albums, “Brooklyn Bridge,” and “The Second Brooklyn Bridge” are perfect examples of mid-60’s pop. They were unique with a horn section that rivaled Blood, Sweat & Tears, East Coast harmonies that created their own sort of Doo Wop Pop sound, and an amazing lead singer.\n\nTheir version of “You’ll Never Walk Alone” featuring Maestro’s emotional lead vocal is simply the best-ever recording of that tune. It is equal in its production and performance to anything ever done by The Righteous Brothers and yet The Bridge did it without Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound.\n\nOn their third album, “The Brooklyn Bridge,” they covered some of the more progressive and thought-provoking tunes of the day. Material that Murray the K on WOR-FM used to call “attitude music.” They did Neil Young’s “Down By The River,” Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth,” and the Moody Blues' “Nights In White Satin.” The results were stunning and these interpretations hold up very well today. They are beautiful recordings.\n\nThere is a cut on their fourth album, “The Bridge In Blue” called “Man In A Band” that stands up to anything Blood Sweat & Tears or Chicago ever recorded. In fact, when you listen to all of the Bridge’s Buddah albums there can be no doubt that they had a huge influence on Chicago. Cream’s “I Feel Free” also gets the Bridge’s harmony and horns treatment on this album as well.\n\n\"You'll Never Walk Alone\" by The Brooklyn Bridge\n\nThey remained hot for the next several years with chart singles “Welcome Me Love,” “Blessed Is the Rain,” “You'll Never Walk Alone,\" and the controversial “Your Husband, My Wife.”\n\nLes Cauchi: “We were riding on about 3 or 4 big hit records. We did the Ed Sullivan Show. We did a variety of big shows at the time like The Hollywood Palace; we toured throughout the country, constantly in the studio recording. It was a very active time musically in our career.”\n\nA few years later when the hits stopped, The Bridge downsized to a five-man group with the vocalists playing their own instruments. Later when the Rock and Roll Revival took hold they became an eight-piece group and their set included The Crests, Brooklyn Bridge and even the Dion hits that The Del-Satins had performed on.\n\nIn 2005 the band released a full concert-length DVD, “Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge Pops Legends Live,” and was featured on PBS's “Doo Wop 50,” doing “Sixteen Candles” and “The Worst That Could Happen.” That show is also available on DVD."
