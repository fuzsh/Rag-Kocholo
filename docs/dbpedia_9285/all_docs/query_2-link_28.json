Johnny Maestro has a hospice set up in his home. The liver cancer appears to be terminal. Johnny is now down to 90 Pounds. With a heavy heart Johnny continues to put all of his fans first. He has issued the following message:\n\n<b>\"I would like to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for their thoughts, get well wishes and prayers while I am undergoing treatment for cancer.\n\nI have been fortunate to be able to perform before the \"best audiences\", our loyal fans, for over 7 decades dating back to the late 1950's. There have been no better times for myself and the Brooklyn Bridge then when we are performing, singing the music that brings back memories of times that we all cherish and hold dear to our hearts. I am very grateful for the opportunity that has allowed me to do something that \"I love\" and to be able to share our music with so many people.\n\nI want everyone to know that when I read your messages, it brightens my day and gives me strength and determination to get back on stage. Your support is the best medicine.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nJohnny Maestro\"\n\n</b></i>\n\nRe: '50s-'60s singer Johnny Maestro in failing health\n\nThe funny part is that a whole lot of them can still bring it. Some are obviously on their last leg and a little weak, but many haven't even lost a step"
