In the autumn of 1961, The Crests recorded \"Guilty\" and \"Baby I Gotta Know\". The single was released in December 1961 and peaked at #102 on Billboard's Hot 100. It is widely thought that James Ancrum sang lead on those two songs, but it was actually Tony Middleton (lead singer of The Willows ~ \"Church Bells May Ring\") who sang lead.\""
