        "text": "On the night of Jan. 18, as some of doo-wop’s biggest stars paid tribute to singer Johnny Maestro at the Maltz Jupiter Theatre, they knew something the fans did not: At that very moment, the lead singer of The Crests and The Brooklyn Bridge was receiving cancer treatments.\n\n“A lot of the people in the audience didn’t know the depth of his illness,” local promoter and friend Jerry Somma said of Mr. Maestro, who died Wednesday night at age 70. “The tribute was something we wanted to do to put it out there that ‘We’re behind you. We love you. We’re going to be right there for you.’ ”\n\nMr. Maestro, the voice behind classics such as Sixteen Candles and The Worst That Could Happen, was a New York native but lived in recent years in Cape Coral. He performed often in South Florida, including several shows at the Maltz and a surprise performance seven years ago at Jupiter’s Feast of Little Italy festival, which Somma produced.\n\nThe night after Mr. Maestro’s last performance, at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut, he was to have performed at the Maltz, but he canceled because of his illness. That show became a tribute featuring Joey Dee, former lead singer of the Starliters, and Tommy Mara and The Crests.\n\n“I will tell you one thing — Johnny Maestro could sing my songs much, much, much, much, much better than I could sing his songs,” doo-wop legend Dion DeMucci, a Boca Raton resident, wrote on his Facebook page. “He is the Rolls Royce of doo-wop voices.”\n\nMr. Maestro, born John Mastrangelo, was “one of the premier vocalists in rock ’n’ roll — and one of the nicest, most sincere perfectionists in music,” said Les Cauchi, an original member of The Brooklyn Bridge."
