        "text": "I am new to the music of Johnny Maestro. I heard Step by Step and felt compelled to hear more...and know more of his music. What a stunning voice in the early recordings and then up to his last performance in 2010. A pure artist who gave in full measure. He is already Hall of Fame for me and I suspect many....with a voice and gift for entertainment that secured loyal fans and can still gain new fans even after his passing. Johnny was gift on this earth and I am sure in continued journey.\n\nPosted by john mcquaig on Monday, 04/8/2013 @ 14:34pm\n\nHopefully the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame board will reconsider and place this great American singer in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as soon as possible. Its a shame that the board did not give him this honor while he was still with us.\n\nPosted by Ciro Di Donna on Tuesday, 04/16/2013 @ 23:33pm\n\nJohnny Maestro and many others deserve to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame but so much of it is political and what record you recorded on. Johnny represents many aspects of music history starting off as a member in a bi-racial music group recording the Crests. Johnny is widely recognized as one of the great voice of Rock. Who else belongs in? Lesley Gore, Neil Sedaka and Tommy James.\n\nPosted by Robert on Monday, 03/9/2015 @ 13:50pm\n\nIt is a travesty that Johnny has been ignored all this time. When artists that have no where near the talent get in, Johnny, until his death still packed concert venues around the world. It makes me really wonder if the powers that be actually know what music is all about, it doesn't seem so. However we are actively seeking johnny's admission into the hall and our numbers are growing everyday. If you are a fan and I have to assume by looking this up you are, then join us and do your part. https://www.facebook.com/Inductjohnnymaestronow\n\nPosted by Joe Caiola on Sunday, 07/19/2015 @ 15:37pm\n\nWe're 69 years old now, and every dance we go to the group or single performing always pays tribute to two legends....Dion and Johnny Maestro. I just learned of the amazing injustice that Johnny Maestro is not in the R & R Hall of Fame.\n\nHOW IS THAT POSSIBLE???\n\nPlease make things right for those of us who grew up with rock and roll and still treasure it.\n\nThank you.\n\nPosted by Bob Gelles on Wednesday, 10/28/2015 @ 16:50pm\n\nAs a singer, Johnny Maestro's voice is right up there with people like Elvis, Frank Sinatra and Roy Orbison. His songs with the Crests and the Brooklyn Bridge were outstanding. It's a no-brainer to put him in the Hall of Fame.\n\nAnd maybe I'm a bit behind things, but someone posted that Sedaka and Anka are others not in the Hall? Whoa! Come on Hall of Fame, folks, let's get these errors corrected. Please.\n\nPosted by Rex Kirts on Monday, 02/1/2016 @ 21:10pm\n\nI do not understand why Johnny Maestro is not already in the rock and roll hall of fame. Of all the ones I see listed I don't understand it.His voice was amazing. He is now passed and what a lasting tribute this would be. Who went to a dance without hearing 16 candles or the worst that could happen ?????? His time to be recognized for the performer he was even at his sickest times in his life and nomination is way over due. Do the right thing...\n\nPosted by Pat H on Monday, 07/17/2017 @ 11:24am\n\nIt just may be that the Hall of Fame doesn't know just HOW to induct Johnny.\n\nShould they induct him with The Brooklyn Bridge ?\n\n(Hardly likely, because the BB only had 7 charting singles , and ONE major hit.) Should they induct him solo ? That probably wouldn't happen either. (only 3 chart hits alone).\n\nJohnny's best chance for induction would probably be as a member of The CRESTS, where he had his greatest success, charting some 13 times with that group between 1957 and 1963.If they induct him alone, it would be just the latest in a series of unfair snub offenses that HoF has historically committed; pulling people out of successful GROUPS,and inducting them SOLO.\n\nThe CRESTS should be inducted ...and Johnny WITH them.\n\nThat's the BEST way to get him in.\n\nPosted by Bill G on Tuesday, 07/18/2017 @ 14:15pm\n\nThe Hall of Fame is a sham outfit controlled by super snob Jann Wenner who treats the nominee process in dictatorial fashion, allowing only his personal favorites entry. It has zero credibility especially after bypassing Johnny Maestro all these years. When Wenner gives up his total control then perhaps others who are more in the know about Rock & Roll greatness will recognize the incredible artists who have been left out.\n\nPosted by Jack Albert on Wednesday, 06/12/2019 @ 01:26am\n\nJohnny Maestro - Great artist, singer, friend. Can someone out there start a nationwide petition to have him inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame that I am sure not hundreds but millions will sign it. Thank goodness the EAST COAST ROCK & ROLL HALL OF FAME IN NEW JERSEY has formed in June 5 2019 and is building its own museum and inductees. Look it Up. We are all counting on this Hall of Fame to induct Johnny Maestro as should be.\n\nThank you to all Fans out there.\n\nPosted by Jan Z on Wednesday, 06/26/2019 @ 13:00pm\n\nI grew up with Johnny' and Sam Cooke' music. I am shocked today 2/2/2021, when I checked that he is not in R&R Hall. As an African American growing up around singers. Singers sang. Johnny' omission form the hall is a pure travesty. Petitions will not do it .Because this is a power play. I listen to him most of the day. The talent this man possessed brings me near tears. I wished Johnny could have lived to see his Induction . I am 79 and I am hopeful to see him in the East Coast R&R Hall of Fame. Thank you\n\nPosted by Joyce on Tuesday, 02/2/2021 @ 19:37pm\n\nI visited the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was shocked to find that Johnny Maestro was not a member. Growing up in the 50's 60's I loved his music. He had a fantastic voice. In my High School Yearbook of 1960 I listed my favorite song which was \"Step by Step\" by the Crests with Johnny Maestro lead singer. He should definitely be inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nPosted by Henry Winkler on Friday, 01/13/2023 @ 20:13pm\n\nThe fact that Johnny and the Crests or The Brooklyn Bridge are not in the Hall Of Fame is a tragedy.\n\nI went there about six years ago. I ask one of the people there why he wasn't acknowledged.\n\nShe didn't even know who he was. I will not go back. big disappointment.\n\nThe voice alone should have gotten him in.\n\nThe collection of songs is immense.\n\nThere are others that have gotten who can't sing or record without autotune .\n\nThe politics at the hall of fame suck.\n\nIn the present climate, I don't think it matters to the hall.\n\nAt 79 I don't have much hope that I will see it happen\n\nPosted by John Zomisky on Monday, 03/13/2023 @ 20:34pm\n\nIt is a travesty that Johnny Masetro, along with his groups the Crests and the Brooklyn Bridge, are not in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Unfortunately, selection to the Hall of Fame is much more of a political process than one based upon merit and achievement. For example, look how long it took Pat Benatar to be elected. And, as others have pointed out, there are groups and individual performers that have been inducted that don't even come close to being qualified objectively. In fact, a number of them were not even rock and roll singers. Some examples include Eminem, Foo Fighters, Kiss, Metallica, N.W.A, The Notorious BIG, Radiohead, Ramones, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Roxy Music, Sex Pistols, Small Faces, T. Rex, and I could go on and on.\n\nJohnny was a man of integrity. He was also humble and had a wonderful personality. He was respected and liked by all. He was generational talent who had a magnificent tenor voice, and many top hits. He performed commencing as a teenager with the Crests and then, after he left the Crests, with the Brooklyn Bridge throughout the rest of his life until he passed away shortly after his last concert in CT, when he lost his courageous battle with cancer. It is abundantly clear that this incredible man, Jonny Maestro, and the groups he sang with, should be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nPosted by Pat Caulfield on Sunday, 07/16/2023 @ 21:15pm\n\nWhat does it take to be inducted into the R&R Hall of Fame? Johnny was a tremendous credit to music. There are so many that should not have been considered for this honor. Along with so many fans I am very disappointed that Johnny and the Brooklyn Bridge have been overlooked for so many years. This is one mistake that needs to be rectified! Joann\n\nPosted by Joann on Thursday, 08/10/2023 @ 10:57am\n\nThere's a big void in not having selected Johnny Maestro into the R &R HOF. Unfortunately, the pseudo experts voting today never heard of him, are unaware of his accomplishments, and are too busy electing people into the HOF who are being pushed by people with political clout. Lest we forget, Johnny Maestro's \"Crests\" were one of the first, if not the first, integrated singing group. That being said, their songs are timeless, still always being played daily on oldies radio. His voice ranks up there with some of the greatest singers of all time. His time within the Rock and Roll world began when he was 16, singing 16 Candles, until his early death at 71. Realistically, not having a long standing R & R icon such as Johnny Maestro in the HOF is the HOF's loss. In fact, when one looks who has been inducted into the HOF, you see a clear political bias…that those with political clout are there without much merit. So, I'll finish be saying the R&R HOF does not I've up to it's name without Johnny Maestro included in the pack.\n\nPosted by Jim Cappola on Monday, 08/21/2023 @ 05:07am\n\nProbably the best lead singer in a \"doo wop\" group during the inception of rock and roll. Yes…\"the best\". I listen to 50's and 60's Serius radio and not 30 minutes can go by before you hear Johnny Maestro's voice belting out a song. He led the Crests, Brooklyn Bridge, and several other groups. His singing makes his songs magical and more than worthy of recognition for the R&R HOF. Wake up and induct a very worthy terrific singer who placed several bricks in the foundation building housing the R&R HOF in the R&R HOF…NOW!\n\nPosted by Jimmy Cap on Monday, 03/4/2024 @ 21:21pm"
