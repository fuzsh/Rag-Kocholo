        "text": "The Bridge formed when Johnny Maestro, the Crests’ lead singer, joined with Dion’s backup singers and the Rhythm Method’s horn players. In addition to Johnny’s Crest hits (“16 Candles,” “The Angels Listened In” and “Step by Step),” the Bridge’s hits include “The Worst that Could Happen,” “Welcome Me Love,” “Blessed is the Rain,” “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and “Your Husband, My Wife.” Lead singer Joe Esposito is amazing as he carries on Maestro’s legacy. Joe sang “Lady, Lady, Lady” in the 1983 hit movie Flashdance and “You’re the Best” in “Karate Kid” as well as collaborating with Donna Summer on “Heaven Knows” and “Bad Girls.”"
