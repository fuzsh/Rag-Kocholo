Music Lover: N. Jim Batty from Wilmington, DE US -- August, 22, 2007\n\nRecently received this CD & it is by far one of the best in my collection. Johnny's voice is actually better, richer, stronger than back in the beginning. The group harmony is nothing short of spectacular. If you have never seen them in live concert, you should go out of your way to find them. They are every bit as good live as in this current CD. Their Acapella versions are surely some of the best in the entire industry. Absolutely 5 stars +++. So PLEASE bring on \"Today - Volume 2\".\n\nToday CD Music Lover: Anonymous from U.S.A. -- July, 26, 2007\n\nGreat songs ! great value !

Frank McKinnon Sr. , Oak Crek , Wisconsin .\n\njohnny maestro and the brooklyn bridge - today Music Lover: FEU CHRISTOPHE from French Riviera -- May, 27, 2006\n\nWhat a wonderful thrill !!! Is there someone better than Johnny Maestro ? I don' t think.\n\nI'm only a 36 years old french guy, wondering every day why I was born so late... Thank you Johnny for giving me such great hours listening to you since I' m a teenager.\n\nJOHNNY MAESTRO AND THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - TODAY Music Lover: RUSS HANSEN from FORT COLLINS, CO US -- March, 5, 2006\n\n5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS C.D. \"TODAY\" IS THE BEST ALBUM (C.D) I HAVE IN MY COLLECTION. IT IS THE PERFECT MIX OF DOO WOP AND ACEPPELLA. iF YOU APPRECIATE PERFECTLY BLENDED HARMONY AND TONES THIS IS THE C.D. TO BUY!!!\n\nYOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!\n\nJOHNNY MAESTRO TODAY, TOMORROW AND FOREVER! Music Lover: PATRICK MEEHAN from JERSEY CITY, NJ US -- January, 29, 2006\n\nThis CD is a master piece. Johnny Maesstro is a true giant of Doo Wop. Johnny's voice is as great now as ever and that's saying something. The best compliment I can give is that this CD has helped fill the giant hole left by the loss of the one and only WCBS OLDIES 101.1. God bless you Johnny and the Brooklyn Bridge. Hey how about a TODAY 2?\n\nA TRIP BACK IN TIME Music Lover: Michael Rhoadarmer from Moline, IL US -- September, 28, 2005\n\nLISTENING TO JOHNNY MAESTRO AND THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE SWEPT ME BACK TO A TIME THAT WE REFER TO AS THE GOOD OLD DAYS. SATURDAY NIGHTS,BLIND DATES,CRUISING ENDLESSLY GOING NOWHERE,4 PEOPLE IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR SNEAKING INTO THE DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATER. ALL OF THOSE AND JOHNNY MAESTRO. THOSE WERE THE GOOD OLD DAYS. WHILE TIME MAY HAVE TAKEN IT'S TOLL ON MOST OF THOSE THINGS THE ONE THING THAT TIME HAS MADE BETTER IS THE VOICE OF JOHNNY MAESRTO. TALENT? A GIFT WOULD MORE APTLY DESCRIBE THIS MAN. FOR A TRIP THAT EVERYONE WILL ENJOY DON'T MISS THIS FANTASTIC CD BY ONE OF LIVING TRUE STARS OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.\n\nJohnny Maestro & The Brooklyn Bridge \"TODAY\" Music Lover: HENRY BROOKS from Lexington, Kentucky -- October, 17, 2004\n\nThis \"TODAY\" CD gives further evidence (as if more evidence were needed) that Johnny Maestro, after all of the years, remains one of, if not the finest vocalists in the music business. Johnny's voice sounds as good now as it did back in the early days. The accapella sides alone are worth the price of the CD, not to mention the great re-recordings of Crests sides (\"16 Candles\", \"The Angels Listened In\", \"Trouble In Paradise\", \"Step By Step\", \"What A Surprise\", etc.) and Broolyn Bridge sides (\"Worst That Could Happen\", \"Welcome Me Love\", \"Blessed Is The Rain\", etc.), which are truly outstanding. The Bridge's rendition of other artists' material further testifies to their versatility. Having heard recent recordings by other artists from that era, Johnny is still clearly head and shoulders above the crowd in pure vocal ability. The years have not diminished his skills in the slightest. If you're a fan of great vocal prowess by an outstanding lead vocalist and smooth harmonies by talented backing vocalists, don't pass this CD up. I'd sure love to see a live DVD and CD from this wonderful group. Why is this man not yet in the Hall of Fame?\n\nTHE GREAT JOHNNY MAESTRO Music Lover: Richie Gee from NYC -- June, 21, 2004\n\nJOHNNY MAESTRO IS LIKE A FINE BOTTLE OF ITALIAN WINE. AS HE AGES, HE GETS BETTER AND BETTER. HE BY FAR IS THE BEST VOICE IN THE MUSIC WORLD TODAY. HIS VERSIONS OF UNCHAINED MELODY AND MY PRAYER. PROVES THE GREAT VOICE OF JOHNNY MAESTRO CAN HANDLE JUST ABOUT ANY SONG. I AS WELL FEEL HE DOESN'T PERFORM YOUR HUSBAND, MY WIFE ENOUGH AT HIS CONCERTS. THAT SONG IS IN THE TOP 500. THAT GOES TO SHOW YOU IT'S LOVED BY THE FANS. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE BAND TO COME OUT WITH A LIVE CD AND DVD. THAT WOULD BE A GRERT TREAT FOR THEIR TRUE FANS. THE ANGELS HAVE LISTENED IN, THEY BROUGHT US THE ANGELIC VOICE OF JOHN \"JOHNNY MAESTRO\" MASTRANGELO. GOD BLESS YOU JOHNNY\n\nA Great Addition...but... Music Lover: Jeremie Arthur from Edwards, CA -- June, 10, 2004\n\nLet's face it, Johnny Maestro sounds as good today as he did in 1968 (if not better) and this album makes a great addition to any collection. My only problem is that this collection is missing so many of their greatest hits. I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I noticed that this album did not contain \"Your Husband, My Wife.\" By far this remains one of the band's greatest yet unappreciated songs. I was fortunate enough to hear a live performance when Johnny came to Connecticut last year and I know that it deserved to be on this album. The album is missing other great hits such as the \"Dion\" tribute and the Brooklyn Bridge version of \"Little Bitty Pretty One.\" This album should have contained fewer cuts from the \"Acapella\" disc that came out last year and should have focused on the hits that made the Brooklyn Bridge famous. Let's hope for a better selection on the next album."
