        "text": "I went to his concert at the (former, but I still call it) Westbury Music Fair Saturday night, not expecting a whole lot, and I cannot believe how fantastic he still sounds. And he's pushing 70! I am pleasantly surprised.\n\nHe doesn't seem to be well represented, definitively at least, on CD. There was a 2CD comp he was selling that night, but it looked to be re-recordings so I stayed away.\n\nOf the scraps that are available, is there anything recommendable?\n\nJohnny is great - I saw him play a show in NJ years ago - got to meet him too.\n\nScraps is right - seems Johnny's catalog is hard to come by. My mother's a huge fan and all she's got on CD is a disc called The Crests Greatest Hits (no idea what label) and the double album of re-recordings with the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nIf you find any good releases I'd be interested, too!\n\nI've seen Mr. Mastrangelo several times, and he's always sounding just fine - not much different than when he was a youngster. Very smooth.\n\nTwo discs to find for the period during which he was lead singer for the Crests:\n\nFor the hits - THE BEST OF THE CRESTS FEATURING JOHNNY MAESTRO (Murray Hill/Rhino 70948). Alternatively, there's another collection issued by Ace (UK) called THE BEST OF THE CRESTS.\n\nFor the rest of it, including alt takes, some very good B-sides and overlooked tunes like Paper Crown - THE BEST OF THE REST OF JOHNNY MAESTRO & THE CRESTS (Ace 322).\n\nI also have a bunch of Coed 45's by the Crests and they sound very good.\n\nThere was a Collectables CD on the Brooklyn Bridge.Has most of their singles (including \"Your Husband,My Wife\").Sounds pretty good.But you gotta be carefull---As with a lot of the old Collectables CDs there are two versions of this.The first version was HORRIBLE needledrops.The second was from tapes.\n\nI believe the second press is the one with the silver disc,no colors,with the Collectables in black on top.(I'm sure it's out of print by now.)\n\nI also remember seeing the first album on CD c.'87/'88.On Buddah.If it's anything like the Lovin' Spoonful CD from that period,I'm glad I never bought it!\n\nThe Crests disc on Murray Hill/Rhino is EXCELLENT!!--There was also a budget disc from one of those labels you see in the cheap bin at Kmart-only five tracks(the big hits) + five by the Duprees--it uses the same masters.For $6,you can't go wrong!!\n\nAlso absent from everything is the cover they did of Neil Young's \"Down By The River\" in 1970. That track was on the vinyl release of The Brooklyn Bridge comp that came out in the 1980's, but it was left off the CD release for some reason (maybe Neil Young insisted?). All that stuff needs to be given a bonafide release on a major label, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nVarese put out a nice-sounding Johnny Maestro and the Crests compilation in 2001 entitled \"20 All-Time Greatest Hits\" mastered by Marty Wekser.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Johnny-Maestro-Crests-All-Time-Greatest/dp/B00005MK7V\n\nCollectables released a 2 CD Brooklyn Bridge collection in 1992 entitled \"For Collector's Only\" which sounds nice and should be enough Brooklyn Bridge for anyone who is interested, except it does not contain \"Down By The River\"!\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Collectors-Jo...B00000096E/ref=m_art_li_2/102-9970707-3580906"
