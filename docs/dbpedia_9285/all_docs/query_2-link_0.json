        "text": "Doo-Wop, Pop | 2006\n\nBrooklyn native Johnny Maestro began his career singing with a group from Manhattan called The Crests. Their first records (including “My Juanita” and “Sweetest One”) generated some regional response, but it was the breakthrough of “Sixteen Candles” that brought them national recognition. A string of hits followed, including “Trouble In Paradise,” “Step By Step,” “The Angels Listened In,” and “Six Nights A Week.” The group disbanded in 1962. In 1968, Maestro combined two groups—the Del-Satins and a Long Island group called Rhythm Method—into an 11-piece band. He renamed them The Brooklyn Bridge. With their trademark vocal and horn arrangements, Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge’s powerful performance of Jimmy Webb’s “The Worst That Could Happen” led to a gold record and countless concert and television appearances for the band. Other hits followed, including “Welcome Me Love,” “Blessed Is the Rain,” “Your Husband My Wife,” and “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” By 1972, the group had sold over 10 million records. Johnny Maestro died in March 2010 at the age of 70.\n\nhttp://www.thebrooklynbridgeband.fourfour.com/\n\nJohnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge Playlist - The Long Island Music Hall of Fame"
