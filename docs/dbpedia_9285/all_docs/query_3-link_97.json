        "text": "REFLECTIONS\n\nAlfred 'Alf' Innella\n\nJerry 'Speedo' Frulio\n\nJoey Orlando\n\nDennis Harrington\n\nBob Zelenka\n\nAlan 'Mr Tone' Tohn\n\nThe REFLECTIONS all came from the same Rosedale, Queens neighborhood. After many years, they have reunited to once again perform as the REFLECTIONS.\n\nAs in many neighborhoods at the time, singing groups were formed, dissolved and reformed with singers moving about to find the right combination of sound and dedication. Alfred, Jerry, Joey, Dennis and Bob had all been members of other groups and they came together to form the REFLECTIONS.\n\nEcho, electricity, heat in the winter and air conditioning in the summer - Rosedale Station was the perfect place to sing. This was the place the REFLECTIONS practiced on a regular basis. Practice paid off - with releases on Crossroads Records. They released two 45rpms - 'Maybe Tomorrow' b/w 'I Really Must Know' and 'Because of You' b/w 'Rocket to the Moon'\n\nThe records received some air play and the group made personal appearances, catching the attention of a New York disc jockey who wanted to promote the group REFLECTIONS. Management and the disc jockey could not come to terms and so the group became disenchanted and broke up a short time later. About a year later, REFLECTIONS reformed and practiced on a regular basis. Families and life took precedence and once again the group was dissolved - everyone going in their own direction.\n\nIn 1986, a Rosedale Reunion was being planned. By this time, most of the group members lived in other states and hadn't been in touch for years. The band that perfomed at the reunion was the Satins - Joe Orlando of the Satins was an original member of the group REFLECTIONS! And all of the members of the orignal group were at the reunion also! They found a place to sing in the building and much to their surprise, their first attempt was on-key and never sounded better!! The united REFLECTIONS even performed a few songs with the Satins that night. Later that week, they all revisited the Rosedale Station only to find it locked - but the underpass of the station had a nice echo and they spent the rest of the afternoon singing.\n\nEven though they all lived in different states, the guys kept in touch by telephone. Once in a while they would reunite and sing together. In the spring of 2002, the guys decided to get back together again as the group - REFLECTIONS. At this time, they added the newest member - Alan Tohn - songwriter and arranger.\n\nBe sure to check out Rosedale Station Revisited, Reflections latest CD.\n\nDiscography:\n\nMaybe Tomorrow b/w I Really Must Know - Crossroads Records # 401 - 1961\n\nBecause of You b/w Rocket to the Moon - Crossroads Records # 402 - 1962\n\n\"Rosedale Station Revisited\" CD (click on title to see track listing).\n\nTo contact the Reflections, please call Bobby at 603-536-4769.
