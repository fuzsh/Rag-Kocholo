        "text": "COUSIN-BRUCIE-ARTICLE-Jimmy-Rosica\n\nROCK & ROLL CALL\n\nTHE BROOKLYN BRIDGE was formed by piecing together a couple of talented groups and one of Rock and Rolls greatest performers -Johnny Maestro. In 1968, Betty Sperber (President of a NYC talent and booking agency) after a successful Battle of the Bands event, decided to put Johnny Maestro, The Del Satins and a seven piece band called The Rhythm Method together as a band. It worked beautifully, an eleven piece ensemble.\n\nAccording to Rock & Roll mythology – they got their name by someone in the talent agency saying:”it would be easier selling The Brooklyn Bridge than to book an eleven piece act.”\n\nJohnny and The Bridge rehearsed, developed their unique sound and signed a recording contract with Buddha Records. Their first release, was a Jimmy Webb song:”Worst That Could Happen” – reached number three on the charts and sold more than a million copies.\n\nThe follow-up, “Welcome Me Love”, and its flip side, “Blessed is the Rain” — each reached the Top 50. A dramatic version of “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and the controversial “Your Husband, My Wife” also charted. By 1972, the group sold over 10 million records.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2005, the South Carolina Music (Rhythm & Blues) Hall of Fame in May 2006 and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in October, 2006.\n\nJoin us this Saturday 2/24/24 when we welcome original Brooklyn Bridge member Jimmy Rosica to MusicRadio WABC. An amazing music industry story."
