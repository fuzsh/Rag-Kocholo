        "text": "Legends Promotions Featuring\n\nA Night of Music & Memories VIIPresents Back to the Sixties\n\nSaturday, October 13, 7:30pm\n\nSpringer Concert Hall\n\nRunning Time: 3 hours (including 20 minute intermission)\n\nTickets: $60, $55, $45, $30\n\nLegends Promotions presents a back to the 60s concert at the CSI Center for the Arts Springer Concert Hall. There is no question that the late Johnny Maestro was one of the greatest singers of all time, starting out as the lead singer of the Crests, Johnny Led the group to great success in the late 50s and early 60s with hits including, “The Angels Listened In,” “Step By Step,” “Trouble In Paradise” and of course the monster hit “16 Candles” which spent 21 weeks at the #2 position on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. After leaving The Crests to pursue a solo career in 1961, Maestro hooked up with original members of the Del Satins and formed The Brooklyn Bridge in 1967. Producing more great hits such as, “Welcome Me Love,” “Blessed is the Rain,” “Your Husband, My Wife,” “You’ll Never Walk Alone,” and their 1968 #3 Billboard hit, “Worst That Could Happen.” Unfortunately, we lost Johnny Maestro eight years ago but originals from the group still perform today to keep the legacy alive. Today, The Brooklyn Bridge contains three original members, Les Cauchi, Jimmy Rosica, and Joe Ruvio and features the incredible vocals of Joe Esposito as lead. The rest of the Brooklyn Bridge band includes Marty D’Amico, Jimmy Sarle, and Lou Agiesta.\n\nDennis Tufano, a native of Chicago, is the original voice of The Buckinghams. The Chicago-based group scored with a string of five Top Ten hits in the late 60s including, the 1967 #1 hit “Kind of a Drag,” and “Don’t You Care,” “Hey Baby They’re Playing Our Song,” “Susan,” and “Back in Love Again.” Today, Dennis travels all over the country performing all those hits by The Buckinghams and his tribute to the late great Bobby Darin.\n\nGary Lewis and the Playboys were discovered in the summer of 1964 and in 1965 they had their first single, “This Diamond Ring,” that went straight to number one. Their second single “Count Me In” reached number 2 followed by five more top ten hits, “Save Your Heart for Me,” Everybody Loves a Clown,” “She’s Just My Style,” “Sure Gonna Miss Her,” and “Green Grass.” With eight gold singles, 17 top 40 hits, four gold albums and 45 million records sold world-wide, Gary Lewis and the Playboys are still one of the hottest acts around. Gary Lewis, along with the Playboys, continues to tour and entertain fans across the country and abroad.\n\nThese three groups have amassed 14 top ten hits in total. Johnny Maestro had one top ten hit each with the Crests and the Brooklyn Bridge. Dennis Tufano with the Buckinghams had five top ten hits and Gary Lewis & the Playboys had seven top ten hits. When you hear these three groups perform these hits, it will take you back on a nostalgic journey to the past.\n\nOur MC/host for the show is Vito Picone who co-wrote “Little Star” which reached number one back in 1958; this year marks 60 years since it became number one and sold over four million copies to date."
