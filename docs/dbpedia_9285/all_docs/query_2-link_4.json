        "text": "Lately, I’ve been getting into Johnny Maestro and The Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nYears ago, I read that the “Bridge” had been a group of teen musicians from Hicksville, Long Island (I lived there before moving to the Bronx; so did Billy Joel), who hooked up with Johnny.\n\nActually, this is not quite true.\n\nThe teen musicians were the instrumentalists, but the vocal backup for Johnny was The Del Satins — the same professional Doo Wop/vocal group that Dion had recorded with after leaving The Belmonts. Knowing that, I began to listen more carefully.\n\nFirst — Johnny is a great lead singer. I didn’t entirely appreciate him back then because, although I loved The Crests, “Bridge” came out in the late 60’s, when there was a lot of wilder stuff going on. I think Johnny’s artistic goal was to put on a great live show, with good “pop” melodies; not necessarily to do the most experimental recordings or the most introspective songs. Listening to him now, I’m knocked out by his range, his phrasing and the feeling he brings to the pieces he sings. Again — he’s not a performer who puts on the most eclectic physical show (a là David Bowie or Alice Cooper). He just stands there and sings; no needless movement, no excessive, unnecessary vocal ornamentation or “showmanship.” I find I can listen to him over and over again.\n\nThe Del-Satins/Bridge vocally backing him are equal to him. They’re not really his “backup singers;” they’re all a group, singing together, in which he’s the lead. Their vocal harmony adds to the performance immeasurably. Billy Davis’ version of “The Worst That Could Happen” doesn’t have that strong vocal accompaniment; his singing is fantastic, but the Del-Satins are an irreplaceable part of the performance.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Del-Satins\n\nIn a way, “Bridge” can be compared to “Chicago” and “Blood, Sweat and Tears,” in that they all expanded the standard rock band to include brass as a regular part of the group (rather than just some extra musicians hired for the recording). “Bridge” doesn’t compare to the other groups technically in the instrumental area, nor do the songs they play demand that of them. But again — I think the focus of this entire group was always the live performances of pop-level songs, supported by the recordings, rather than the other way around.\n\n“Bridge” had some great material; some less-than-great. It’s too bad that some of the top songwriters — Brian Wilson, for example — didn’t see their potential and write for them. Jimmy Webb wrote “The Worst that Could Happen,” but for Billy Davis of The 5th Dimension. “Bridge” simply covered it and had the hit. Such is the music business. But how cool would it have been if Carol King had written for “Bridge,” or Ellie Greenwich, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, etc. Or even Billy Joel?\n\nAnyway, when I listen to YouTube videos of Bridge now, without comparing them to other groups, I just kvell. It’s such a great sound.\n\nI remember seeing Johnny Maestro in a R&R revival concert many years ago; I can’t remember if he was with the Bridge that night. I remember him singing “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” Again — compared to other stuff that was being done, this was kind of a passé choice of an American songbook “standard,” at a time when Billy Joel, et al, were creating entirely new “American Songbook” “standards.” Still, if I just take Johnny’s performance for itself — he puts on a great show and was a really, really good singer. It’s also to his credit that he protected his voice, and was still able to sing well in 2010, shortly before he passed away.\n\nOf Italian male lead rock & roll singers, he had less “Sinatra” aspirations than Darin or Rydell (maybe), and less “Blues” aspirations than Dion. He also seemed to be satisfied being the front man of a group, rather than a stand-alone star; Franki Valli would be an example of someone who balanced both in his own career.\n\nThere’s an up-coming young Italian singer named Chris Ruggiero, who is making a career singing “oldies.” He’s got a great voice and his live performances get better and better. I emailed him to suggest that he look into doing some of the songs by “Bridge,” as Johnny is gone and the remaining Del Satins are probably around 80. I said, “The world needs someone who can do a really good version of ‘The Worst That Could Happen’ now.”\n\nHere’s Johnny singing “The Worst That Could Happen” in 1968:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXSUEuG1Ba8\n\n(That’s the Del-Satins to his right)\n\nHere’s a stereo-version of “Welcome Me, Love”:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jQ-W_APZ0I\n\nThis guy could sing!"
