        "text": "About this event\n\nJoin hosts Scott Samuelson + Eddie Dudek as The Bradstan Cabaret Series continues with Patti Greco Sunshine + opener John Pizzi on June 25 at 7 p.m.\n\nA dynamic entertainer who performs a varied selection of classics, Patti Greco Sunshine puts her signature on each one. She is real, funny, and obviously loves what she does—which is apparent the moment she hits the stage. You may hear influences of Streisand, Bassey, and Vaughan, but never an impersonation. She has her own original sound that is uniquely PATTI GRECO SUNSHINE.\n\nOne of the most innovative and multi-faceted comics in the industry, opener John Pizzi treats audiences of all ages to an incomparable one-man show of stand-up, magic, comedy mentalism, and ventriloquism featuring his feisty sidekicks Andy, Uncle Smiley, Smokey, Baby Princess… and YOU!\n\n6 p.m. doors open | 7 p.m. showtime\n\nFull bar, light bites + desserts available | No drink minimum\n\nArrive early to grab a cocktail at the Cabaret Bar before the show!\n\nBONUS: Tickets include access to our Bradstan Meet + Greet with the evening’s performers, and the opportunity to purchase autographed CDs.\n\nABOUT PATTI\n\nBorn and raised in Sullivan County, N.Y., Patti Greco started singing at the impressionable age of eight, sitting in with some of the best musicians in the business. Channeling her father, singer/entertainer/comedian Johnny Greco, one of the Catskills’ greatest tummlers, she took up the guitar and added an intimate segment to her high energy show of just guitar and vocals.\n\nPatti honed her craft by observing some of the greatest acts in the business and learned what it took to entertain an audience. Her vast experience includes lead vocalist for the Ed Gerlach Society Orchestra in Houston, Texas, and opening for Marvin Hamlisch, Vic Damone, Steve Lawrence + Eydie Gorme, and many others before stepping out on her own. She began headlining on cruise ships and soon was performing in Las Vegas and even Atlantic City, where she was joined onstage by Robert Goulet. Patti’s most cherished performances include duets with Buddy Greco and Robert Clayton Thomas, as well as opening for Rich Little and Red Buttons.\n\nABOUT john\n\nComedian • Magician • Ventriloquist • Mentalist\n\nJohn’s high energy sleight-of-hand tricks, comedy telepathy, and hilarious puppet characters are a favorite at comedy clubs, performing arts centers, theater venues, corporate events, resorts, and colleges across the country.\n\nA national headliner who has opened for Joy Behar, Jerry Vale, Weird Al Yankovic, Johnny Maestro and the Brooklyn Bridge, The Trammps, The Regents, Al Martino, and Clint Holmes, John performs regularly in Las Vegas and the Borgata in Atlantic City. He appeared on two seasons of “America’s Got Talent,” “The Late Show with David Letterman,” ABC’s “What Would You Do?” and numerous celebrity events at the legendary Friars Club in Manhattan. John recently taped his first comedy special at the Borgata Hotel, soon to be released."
