        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Nearly every Staten Island girl who has come of age with a party at a catering hall can tip her tiara to the memory of Johnny Maestro, the doo-wop star from Midland Beach and member of the group Johnny Maestro and the Brooklyn Bridge, who recorded \"Sixteen Candles.\"\n\nMaestro, who was born John Mastrangelo in Brooklyn but called the Island home from 1957 until 1972, died of cancer Wednesday in Florida. He was 70.\n\nBefore changing his name to Maestro, he began his career in the 1950s with The Crests, when he sang as Johnny Mastro. In 1960, three of his singles placed on the charts: \"Model Girl,\" \"What a Surprise\" and \"My Happiness.\"\n\nMaestro later joined the Del-Satins, which merged with The Rhythm Method, a Long Island band, to form Johnny Maestro and the Brooklyn Bridge in 1968.\n\nThe band got its name after a manager declared it would be \"harder to sell than the Brooklyn Bridge,\" Maestro once said.\n\nAmong their hits were \"The Worst That Could Happen,\" which band-mate Les Cauchi said earned \"gold record\" status with a million sales. The group performed that song on \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" Cauchi said. The group’s other hits included \"Blessed is the Rain,\" \"Welcome Me Love\" and \"You’ll Never Walk Alone.\"\n\nMaestro, along with Vito Picone of Vito Picone and The Elegants fame, and Bobby Cassotto, better known as Bobby Darin, all spent time hanging out at the South Beach Boardwalk in the 1950s, and all went on to score chart-topping hits.\n\nMaestro performed locally at the Richmond County Bank Ballpark at St. George, the St. George Theatre, the College of Staten Island and a Back to the Beach concert, as well as other fundraising events at Island schools. The band toured throughout the U.S. and Europe, playing arenas, amphitheaters and casinos.\n\nFriend and fellow band-member Jimmy Rosica remembered the drill for those road trips: The tour bus would stop first in Hicksville, L.I., to pick up several band members, then in Queens, and finally cross the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to pick up Maestro and fellow Islanders Freddy Ferrara and Mike Gregorio.\n\n\"Picking them up was an experience,\" Rosica said. By the time everyone loaded their gear and got ready to hit the road, \"before we even got to the Goethals Bridge, we’d already been in the bus for 14 hours.\"\n\nLocally, Cauchi remembered gigs at the former Crocitto's nightclub and the Lincoln Lounge, along with playing a lot of proms and other Island shows.\n\nHe remembered Maestro as \"one of the premier vocalists in rock ‘n’ roll — and one of the nicest, most sincere perfectionists in music.\"\n\n\"Of all the talent, Johnny was the smoothest,\" said Bruce (Cousin Brucie) Morrow, who worked with Maestro many times. \"He probably sounded more like his recordings live than any other performer. He always held true to the music and treated it with great respect.\"\n\nMaestro’s last performance was Jan. 17, when The Brooklyn Bridge was among groups appearing at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut. It was billed as \"Bowzer’s Ultimate Doo-Wop Party.\"\n\n\"As frail and weak as Johnny seemed, I knew he didn’t want to have to cancel,\" host Jon (Bowzer) Bauman said in an e-mailed statement. \"I told him afterward it was the most courageous performance I’d ever seen. As frail as he looked, that’s how strong he sounded.\n\n\"It was a privilege to have known him, and it was thrilling to have listened to him,\" said Bauman.\n\nA memorial service is tentatively planned for Friday on Long Island, Rosica said, directing fans to the group’s Web site, www.j-maestro-bklyn-bridge.com, for more information."
