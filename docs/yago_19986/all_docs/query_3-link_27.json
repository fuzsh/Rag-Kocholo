        "text": "Jack Lemmon is back. Almost.\n\nThe legendary actor’s son, Chris Lemmon, does an enchanting job of channeling his dad in “Jack Lemmon Returns,” which runs through Feb. 1 at the Broad Stage’s black-box Edye theater in Santa Monica. For 90 minutes rich with memories, music and film clips projected above a black piano, Lemmon does more than just act like his father; he seems to be possessed by him.\n\n“I do a good Jack Lemmon,” says Chris, whose physical resemblance to his dad has often been remarked upon. “But I really, honestly, don’t think it’s as much of an impersonation as it’s sort of a channeling thing. I really do feel, and hope, that he inhabits me for an hour-and-a-half onstage.”\n\nBased on Chris’ memoir “A Twist of Lemmon,” which he wrote partially as a way to cope with his father’s 2001 death at age 76, “Jack Lemmon Returns” charts the elder Lemmon’s life in his distinctive voice and with a battery of his even more particular physical mannerisms. It goes all the way from Jack’s Massachusetts childhood through his days as a struggling New York actor and musician (a passion Jack passed on to Chris, who has a California Institute of the Arts degree in classical piano and composition).\n\nIt further delves into Jack’s early success in Hollywood (he won the first of two Oscars for his fourth movie, “Mister Roberts,” in 1955) and his classic collaborations with director Billy Wilder (“Some Like It Hot,” “The Apartment”) and his great buddy Walter Matthau (Wilder’s “The Fortune Cookie,” “The Odd Couple,” “Grumpy Old Men”), to his maturation into a substantial dramatic (“Days of Wine and Roses,” “Missing,” his other Oscar-winner “Save the Tiger”) as well as comic actor.\n\nChris restages some of his father’s unforgettable scenes from those films and other movies throughout the one-man show (Chris delivers Joe E. Brown’s climactic “Nobody’s perfect” line from “Some Like It Hot” perfectly), along with behind-the-scenes moments involving the likes of Marilyn Monroe, James Cagney, Gregory Peck and many, many more.\n\n“The real interesting challenge of this was the other imitations,” reveals Chris, who at 60 has more than 40 TV and film acting credits himself. “I do over 50 characters in the show. But it’s not me doing those characters; I did them as my father doing those characters. That’s kind of a fun twist; there’s lots of little stuff going on underneath that performance that makes it the most challenging form of acting that there is.”\n\nThe idea to play the production through the elder rather than the younger Lemmon’s persona came more or less simultaneously to Chris and writer-director Hershey Felder, the renowned Canadian composer and playwright known for headlining a similar kind of show about George Gershwin (Jack Lemmon’s favorite music guy, by the way).\n\nThough packed with warmth and laughs, “Jack Lemmon Returns” isn’t all fun. Jack and actress Cynthia Stone, Chris’ mother, divorced when their son was 3 years old. Though he remained a great and involved dad, Jack as Chris plays him repeatedly expressing guilt about putting his career first as well as leading a Hollywood bachelor lifestyle that eventually led to a second marriage to actress Felicia Farr and a drinking problem.\n\nChris recalls all that along with abundant good times.\n\n“I adored Dad, he really was my best friend,” Chris says. “This is a story, in my humble opinion, that deserves to be told, a fairly tragic at its core father-son story that was unique yet, in very many ways, universal. There are going to be bumps in any road and it’s my duty as a storyteller to show those bumps as well. But there are no wire coat hangers in here; I have no bones to pick.”\n\nChris appeared in three films along with his father: “Airport ’77,” “That’s Life!” and the appropriately titled “Dad.” Chris also had regular roles on such TV series as “Knots Landing” and “Duet,” but eventually moved his family to Connecticut so his three children, now all in college, could have a more traditional upbringing than he did. Chris and his wife of 26 years, Gina Raymond, produce documentaries, among them the award-winning “Day by Day.”\n\nTo Chris, however, his book and “Jack Lemmon Returns” stand out among his creative accomplishments.\n\n“I miss him an awful lot,” Chris says of his father. “So for 90 minutes every night, I get to be on stage with him. That’s the way it feels to me. I even call out to him. I say, ‘Pop, here we go’ right before I come on. Then I say ‘Magic Time,’ which was his line. Then I go out there and I just have a ball for 90 minutes. It’s so much fun.”"
