        "text": "The golden age of Hollywood is long gone but the entertainers who made it possible like Felicia Farr still pique our interest. Though she is now retired, in her active years, Farr was a stellar actress and model. She is notable for modeling lingerie in the 50s and 60s as well as roles in 3:10 to Yuma(1957), Kiss Me, Stupid(1964), and Charley Varrick(1973).\n\nApart from her professional career, Farr was married two times. Her first marriage was with Lee Farr. Her next marriage with Jack Lemmon lasted till his death. Also, she is the mother of two daughters, Denise Farr and actress, Courtney Lemmon.\n\nThe 91-year-old Actress was Born and Raised in Westchester\n\nFelicia Farr was born Olive Dines on October 4, 1932, in Westchester County, New York. Regarding other members of her family, not much has been revealed by Felicia. However, from what we gathered, she started following a career in the entertainment industry at a young age.\n\nNonetheless, it did not affect her education as she attended Erasmus Hall High School, in New York. She proceeded to the Pennsylvania State University where she obtained a degree in sociology.\n\nFelicia Farr Started Her Professional Career as a Model\n\nLooking at her pictures, Felicia sure gives the vibe of real beauty during her prime. True to this assessment, she started her career as a lingerie model at the age of 15. Reportedly, she was discovered by Louis Shur, a talent agent. He had been served by Felicia at a restaurant but beyond the meal, he was captivated by her looks and the hope of seeing her in motion pictures. However, she did not start with acting, instead, it was modeling that launched her.\n\nAccording to her, she was underage but the agency lied about it and reported her age as 19 because a state law made it necessary for underage lingerie models to be supervised.\n\nShe became quite successful and a well-recognized face in the 50s and 60s. Added to her shoots, she also posed for adverts and unsurprisingly, she signed a 7-year contract with the media giant Columbia Pictures in 1955.\n\nSoon enough, modeling paved the way for an acting career. Felicia’s earliest screen roles were in three Westerns directed by Delmer Deaves; The Last Wagon(1956), Jubal(1956), and 3:10 to Yuma(1957).\n\nOver the next few years, Felicia took more screen roles that made her a notable actress. Per IMDB, she is credited with 45 screen roles. The same source lists her last appearance as The Player in 1992. However, Wikipedia lists the 2014 Loser’s Crown as her latest work. Since that last appearance, she has not appeared in more roles. Based on this, we may not be wrong to say she is retired.\n\nShe Has Been Married Two Times\n\nThe famed actress married her first husband, Lee Farr in 1949. Through this marriage, she retains the Farr surname. Moving on, Farr was also an actor who is notable for The Detectives(50s and 60s) which he acted the part of Lt. Jimmy Conway. More on their marriage, the pair welcomed a daughter, Denise Farr during their marriage that lasted for 6 years as they parted ways in 1955.\n\nApparently, no report was heard about Lee getting married again but this was not the case for Felicia. Though she still kept the Farr name, she moved on with the actor, Jack Lemmon whom she married in 1962.\n\nAt the time, Lemmon was filming Irma La Douce, a romantic comedy that was released in 1963. Like Felicia, this marriage was also a second for Lemmon. He was previously married to Cynthia Stone.\n\nFelicia and Jack’s marriage produced their only daughter together, Courtney Lemmon. Felicia also became the stepmother to Chris Lemmon, Lemmon’s son with his ex-wife. Also, the marriage lasted longer than Felicia’s first as they were together till Lemmon’s sad demise in 2001 from cancer.\n\nSee Also: Makenzie Moss: How Old Is She And What Is She Known For?\n\nWhat are the Former Model’s Children up to?\n\nUnlike her parents who had a career in the limelight, not much is known about Felicia’s oldest daughter, Denise. However, her love life is quite interesting. She was married to American actor, Don Gordon till his death in 2019 at the age of 90.\n\nGordon who was born on November 13, 1926, was actually older than Denise and her parents. Her mother was born in 1932 while her late father was born in 1927. Needless to say, age was not a hindrance as they enjoyed a long marriage that outlived Gordon. Moreso, there are many celebrities that have huge age gaps such as Alec Baldwin and Hilaria, and Paul Nassif and Brittany Nassif.\n\nUnlike her sister, Felicia’s youngest daughter, Courtney took her parent’s footsteps as an actress. IMDB credits her with roles in Yes, Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus(1974), and Hollywood Greats(1977). Aside from her professional life, she has been married to Peter McCrea since March 2001."
