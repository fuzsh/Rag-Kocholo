        "text": "(1925–2001). In his portrayal of a wide variety of characters, many of whom experience an awakening in relation either to their own personal lives or to the corrupt nature of the world in which they live, Jack Lemmon was equally adept at comedy and drama. His versatility earned him Academy awards for both comic roles (Mister Roberts, 1955) and dramatic parts (Save the Tiger, 1973).\n\nJohn Uhler Lemmon III was born on Feb. 8, 1925, in Newton, a suburb of Boston, Mass., to John Uhler Lemmon II and Millie LaRue Lemmon. He was given his father’s name but would always be known as Jack. His father made a fortune in the doughnut industry, and thus Lemmon’s childhood was privileged and his surroundings affluent. He developed a love for music at an early age and learned to play piano at the age of 11. His other great passion was acting, and he performed in school plays throughout high school.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Lemmon attended college at Harvard University. There he joined both the naval branch of the college’s cadet corps and the dramatic group known as the Hasty Pudding Club. In 1945 he was elected president of the club and wrote their 1945 show, The Proof of the Pudding. That same year his college career was briefly interrupted when the Navy commissioned him to be an ensign. After his service ended, Lemmon returned to Harvard and received his degree in 1947.\n\nAfter graduation, Lemmon moved to New York to become an actor. He left with 300 dollars in his pocket and, once there, supported himself playing the piano in bars and waiting tables. He soon found work as an actor in both plays and radio soap operas. It was also in New York that he met his first wife, Cynthia. They married in 1950 and had a son, Christopher, but later divorced. Lemmon later married actress Felicia Farr, and they had a daughter, Courtney. Before long, Lemmon realized that he had to move to Hollywood to establish his film career.\n\nOnce in Hollywood, Lemmon enjoyed moderate success, making two films, It Should Happen to You and Phffft in 1954. But it was not until he made Mister Roberts the following year that his career began to take off. In 1956 he won the Academy award for best supporting actor for his role as Ensign Pulver in that movie. Three years after winning the award, Lemmon enjoyed another wildly successful film, Some Like it Hot directed by Billy Wilder and costarring Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe. In 1960 he worked with Wilder again, in the film The Apartment, which earned Lemmon another Academy award nomination.\n\nUntil 1962, Lemmon’s career seemed to be based on romantic comedies. He changed all that, however, by playing a tortured alcoholic in the film Days of Wine and Roses. His dramatic role in that film won him another Academy award nomination. Lemmon continued to show his versatility as an actor by starring both in comedies, such as the popular The Odd Couple, and in dramas, such as Save the Tiger, for which he won another Oscar in 1974. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Lemmon continued to make films that were both critically acclaimed and box office successes, such as The China Syndrome (1979) and Missing (1982). He debuted as director in Kotch (1971) and in 1985 on Broadway in Long Day’s Journey into Night. He was awarded the American Film Institute’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 1988.\n\nThe 1990s brought Lemmon a whole new range of roles. He received critical accolades for such films as Glengarry Glen Ross and the documentary Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy (both 1992), and he enjoyed great commercial success with Grumpy Old Men (1993) and Grumpier Old Men (1995), both of which featured his longtime costar Walter Matthau. Lemmon’s other films included Irma la Douce (1963), The Front Page (1974), The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1975), That’s Life (1986), Dad (1989), Kenneth Branagh’s Hamlet (1996), My Fellow Americans (1996), Out to Sea (1997), and The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000).\n\nLemmon also enjoyed success in television specials and in films made for television. Some of his more memorable Emmy-nominated roles include Tuesdays with Morrie (1999; for which he won the award), Inherit the Wind (1999), 12 Angry Men (1997), The Murder of Mary Phagan (1988), The Entertainer (1976), and Jack Lemmon in ’S Wonderful, ’S Marvelous, ’S Gershwin (1972). Lemmon died from complications related to cancer on June 27, 2001, in Los Angeles."
