        "text": "Actor Jack Lemmon's name is synonymous with his best friend and co-star, Walter Matthau, and their unforgettable films of \"Grumpy Old Men.\" You smile when you think of the two and their antics in the movies and on TV.\n\nYet Chris Lemmon, author of this new book, and the devoted son of Jack, does not focus so much on this part of his father's life because there is much more to tell.\n\nJack Lemmon died in 2001, and after many brushes with cancer, it was pneumonia that took him at the age of 76.\n\nIn these years, Jack Lemmon did a whole lot of living. With his son, he played golf on some of the world's most spectacular courses, he raced around in some of the sportiest (and most expensive) cars, together they went on many fishing trips to Alaska, and father and son, as talented musicians, played the piano professionally and just for fun. Chris and Jack Lemmon were a team. The reader can sense Chris Lemmon's grieving process has continued as \"A Twist of Lemmon\" is read.\n\nRemember, this is not a tell-all Hollywood celebrity book, but a son's memoir of the sad and glad times with one of America's most loved stars.\n\nChris Lemmon writes: \"Though writing this book was a cathartic experience for me, it didn't make it any easier to handle those feelings of loss that come from time to time; the time I spent with Pop (Jack) in reminiscence, however, did in some small way help to heal the deep loss I felt. I adored my father ...\"\n\nChris Lemmon certainly never recovered from the sadness when his mother and father divorced when he was just 3 years old. Jack Lemmon married Felicia Farr six years later and neither Jack nor stepson Chris ever got along with the volatile woman, yet Chris' mother, the wealthy Cynthia Stone, years later married actor Cliff Robertson, who, Chris says, \"continues to be a friend and like a father to me.\"\n\nFew of Jack Lemmon's flaws are mentioned, but I could have done without the alcoholism that plagued him. Yet the story of how he faced his weakness, with the help of AA, and got the demons out of his life, is part of the book's truth.\n\nThe book includes details of the making of the movie \"Some Like It Hot,\" with the hilarious cross-dressing of Lemmon and Tony Curtis.\n\nLemmon's friends had much to say Neil Simon said, \"I don't remember how many films I wrote for Jack Lemmon, but I know it wasn't enough. I gladly would have done it forever.\"\n\nShirley MacLaine said, \"Jack was extraordinary, yet Ã”normal,' a credit to the human species who strive to be normal like him. It was magic to be ... in his presence.\"\n\nBlake Edwards (husband of Julie Andrews) said, \"If I were restricted to only one actor I could work with for the rest of my career, without a doubt it would be Jack Lemmon.\"\n\nJulie Andrews said, \"Off camera, he was a member of our extended film family - without ego and self-effacing, playing our grand piano ... chatting up the cast and crew, all of whom adored him ... I miss him very much.\"\n\n\"A Twist Of Lemmon\" will have a special place on the shelf with your other Hollywood star books.\n\nNow let's turn from the sublime (Lemmon) to the ridiculous.\n\n\"Finn,\" by Jon Clinch, is being touted as a good summer read. Here is my take on it.\n\n\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\" published in 1884, is Mark Twain's masterpiece. This new book is by a new writer, who is a creative ad director in Philadelphia.\n\nClinch is a very fine writer. Therefore, I don't understand why he would spend his time and talent on such a warped, make-believe character as Huckleberry Finn's father. Huck Finn is an outstanding fictional character, made up in the brilliant mind of Mark Twain. Huck is the village outcast - and herein lies a great moral story. \"Finn\" is dreadfully dark and disappointing."
