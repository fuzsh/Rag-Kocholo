        "text": "Felicia Farr (born Olive Dines; October 4, 1932) is an American former actress and model.\n\nEarly years\n\nFarr was born in Westchester County, New York. She attended Erasmus Hall High School and studied sociology at Penn State.\n\nCareer\n\nFarr began modeling lingerie at age 15. In 1955, she told a wire-service reporter: \"I was under age and over-developed ... The agency claimed I was 19 because a state law required underage lingerie models to be chaperoned\".\n\nShe appeared in several modeling photo shoots and advertisements during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1955, she signed a seven-year contract with Columbia Pictures.\n\nHer earliest screen appearances date from the mid-1950s. They include three westerns directed by Delmer Daves: Jubal (1956) and 3:10 to Yuma (1957), both starring Glenn Ford, and The Last Wagon (1956), starring Richard Widmark.\n\nFarr's later film appearances include the Billy Wilder farce Kiss Me, Stupid (1964) with Dean Martin and Ray Walston as her husband (a role originally intended for Jack Lemmon); Walter Matthau's daughter-in-law in Kotch (1971) (Lemmon's only film as director); and the Don Siegel bank-heist caper Charley Varrick (1973) with Matthau.\n\nShe had more than 30 TV appearances on The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, Wagon Train, Bonanza, Ben Casey, Burke's Law, Harry O, and many others.\n\nPersonal life\n\nOn September 2, 1949, she married actor Lee Farr, a marriage which produced a daughter, Denise Farr, who later became the wife of actor Don Gordon. Farr's second husband was actor Jack Lemmon; they married in 1962 while Lemmon was filming the comedy Irma La Douce in Paris. They remained married until his death in 2001.\n\nDuring her marriage to Jack Lemmon, Farr gave birth to a daughter, Courtney, in 1966. She is also the stepmother of Lemmon's son, actor and author Chris Lemmon, from his first marriage.\n\nFilmography\n\nYear Title Role 1955 Big House, U.S.A.
