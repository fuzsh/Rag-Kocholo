        "text": "This image could have imperfections as it’s either historical or reportage.\n\nAug 18, 1962 - Paris, FRANCE - John Uhler Lemmon III, better known as JACK LEMMON during his wedding with a TV actress Felicia FARR. Lemmon was one of the most award-winning American actors of his generation. A private school-educated everyman who could play outrageous comedy and wrenching tragedy, Jack Lemmon burst onto the movie scene as a 1950s Columbia contract player and remained a beloved star until his death in 2001. Whether through humor or pathos, he excelled at illuminating the struggles of average men against a callous world; as director Billy Wilder once noted, 'There was a little bit of genius in everything he did.'
