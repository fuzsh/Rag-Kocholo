        "text": "Jack Lemmon, the brash young American Everyman who evolved into the screen's grumpiest old everyman during a movie career that lasted a half century, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 76.\n\nThe cause was complications from cancer, said a spokesman, Warren Cowan.\n\nThrough most of his more than 60 movies, Lemmon was the least glamorous and most approachable of movie stars -- the good-natured, ordinary guy next door with a slightly skewed moral compass. He was a master of sardonic comedy and could convey urban frustrations so deftly that audiences identified with him and thus were able to laugh at themselves.\n\nAs C.C. Baxter in The Apartment, Billy Wilder's Academy Award-winning film, he created the definitive comic hero for an age of anxiety, a salary man so eager to win a promotion that he lends his apartment to his married bosses for weekly trysts with their secretaries. As Ensign Pulver in Mister Roberts, a performance that gained him an Oscar for best supporting actor, he was a callow but likable wheeler-dealer.\n\nAnd in one of his most memorable roles, as a musician forced to dress up as a woman to escape gangsters in Wilder's Some Like It Hot, Lemmon got engaged to another man because it was his only chance to marry a millionaire.\n\nThe critic Pauline Kael found him \"demonically funny,\" while Stanley Kauffmann described him as \"easily one of the most expert American actors of his generation.\"\n\nBut Lemmon did not settle for simply being a skillful clown. In 1962, after making 15 comedies, one Western and one adventure film, he sought out the role of a young alcoholic husband in Blake Edwards' Days of Wine and Roses.\n\n\"The movie people put a label attached to your big toe -- \"light comedy' -- and that's the only way they think of you,\" Lemmon said in a 1984 interview. \"I knew damn well I could play drama. Things changed following Days of Wine and Roses. That was as important a film as I've ever done.\"\n\nThings changed even more in 1973 when Lemmon took home another Academy Award, this time for best actor, for his performance as a desperate garment manufacturer who hires someone to torch his warehouse in Save the Tiger. The actor had been so eager to get the movie made that he relinquished his usual large salary and worked for scale, then $165 a week, after studio executives limited the film's budget to $1-million.\n\nWith that Oscar, Lemmon became the first male actor to win Academy Awards in both the supporting and star categories. (Helen Hayes was the first female actor to do it.)\n\nLemmon received six other Academy Award nominations -- for Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Days of Wine and Roses, The China Syndrome, Tribute and Missing.\n\nWilder, who wrote and directed seven films with Lemmon, once said: \"Jack Lemmon is a ham. And you can always trim a ham. Jack Lemmon always gives you everything.\"\n\nIn a second classic collaboration, Lemmon starred with Walter Matthau in 10 movies, many of them directed by Wilder. Their first pairing, in 1966, was The Fortune Cookie, their last The Odd Couple II in 1998. Matthau died almost exactly a year ago, on July 1, at 79.\n\nLemmon almost always played the timid, neurotic schnook to Matthau's tricky whirlwind. He was Stan Laurel to Matthau's blustering Oliver Hardy and Bob Hope to Matthau's smoothly conniving Bing Crosby.\n\nMatthau, the son of immigrants, grew up in poverty on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Lemmon was a child of privilege who was destined for Harvard. Jack Lemmon, Matthau once said, \"is a clean-cut, well-scrubbed Boston choirboy with quiet hysteria seeping out of every pore.\"\n\nThey were friends in real as well as reel life. Both men always insisted that during their 40 years of friendship, they never had a single argument.\n\nIn the '90s, the two became major movie stars again with the unexpected box-office success of Grumpy Old Men, Grumpier Old Men, Out to Sea, and The Odd Couple II.\n\nLemmon was also a perfect actor for bringing Neil Simon's neurotic characters to the screen, among them the fastidious hypochondriac Felix in The Odd Couple; the hysterical visitor to New York in The Out-of-Towners, and the jobless paranoid in The Prisoner of Second Avenue.\n\nJohn Uhler Lemmon III was born on Feb. 8, 1925, to a life-of-the-party mother and a father who was an executive with the Doughnut Corp. of America and an amateur soft-shoe dancer. An only child, he was sent to the best private schools in Boston. Later he was made an unwilling witness to the disintegration of his parents' marriage. His fun-and-games facade and clownish cheerfulness, he acknowledged, were his way of coping with the complexity of his parents' relationship.\n\nA track star in prep school, Lemmon fell in love with the piano at 14 and taught himself to play. In 1943, he entered Harvard, where he was an indifferent student.\n\nDuring the last days of World War II, he spent seven months in the Navy without seeing action.\n\nHe returned to Harvard in 1946 and graduated in 1947. Borrowing $300 from his father, Lemmon went to New York to act. For more than a year, most of his earnings came from playing piano at a bar.\n\nEventually, the young actor began getting roles on radio soap operas and live television dramas. He made his Off Broadway debut in 1947 as the star of Tolstoy's Power of Darkness, but television paid the bills. He appeared in more than 400 live television roles and was a familiar face on the leading dramatic shows of the period.\n\nLemmon thought his Broadway career was finally getting under way in 1953 when he won a role in a revival of Room Service. Instead, a talent scout for Columbia Pictures, who had noticed the actor on television, plucked him for Hollywood.\n\nHe was handed the role of the boyfriend of Judy Holliday's character in It Should Happen to You.\n\nLemmon began returning to the stage in the early 1960s, and would do so throughout his career.\n\n\"After eight years of doing a few minutes of film a day, I wanted the satisfaction of really working and building on a scene,\" Lemmon told the New York Times Magazine.\n\nIn 1986 he tackled Long Day's Journey Into Night, to play James Tyrone, the father in Eugene O'Neill's searing disintegration of a family. Walter Kerr wrote in the New York Times that the one deficit of Lemmon's performance was that \"this star still can't quite bring himself to let an audience hate him.\"\n\nLemmon's career took a new turn in the 1990s with critically praised ensemble roles in Oliver Stone's JFK, David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, and Robert Altman's Short Cuts.\n\nHis last major role was on television as the dying university professor in Tuesdays with Morrie.\n\nLemmon's first marriage ended in divorce %% WARNING %%in 1956. His second wife, Felicia Farr, an actor whom he married in 1962, survives him, along with their daughter, Courtney McCrea; a stepdaughter, Denise Gordon; a son from his first marriage, Christopher; and three grandchildren.\n\nLemmon's films\n\nSelected film and television credits for Jack Lemmon:\n\nFilms:\n\n\"Phffft!\" 1954\n\n\"It Should Happen to You,\" 1954\n\n\"My Sister Eileen,\" 1955\n\n\"Mister Roberts,\" 1955\n\n\"Three for the Show,\" 1955\n\n\"Hollywood Bronc Busters,\" 1956\n\n\"You Can't Run Away from It,\" 1956\n\n\"Fire Down Below,\" 1957\n\n\"Operation Mad Ball,\" 1957\n\n\"Bell, Book and Candle,\" 1958\n\n\"Cowboy,\" 1958\n\n\"It Happened to Jane,\" 1959\n\n\"Some Like It Hot,\" 1959\n\n\"Pepe,\" 1960\n\n\"The Wackiest Ship in the Army,\" 1960\n\n\"The Apartment,\" 1960\n\n\"Days of Wine and Roses,\" 1962\n\n\"The Notorious Landlady,\" 1962\n\n\"Under the Yum Yum Tree,\" 1963\n\n\"Irma la Douce,\" 1963\n\n\"Good Neighbor Sam,\" 1964\n\n\"The Great Race,\" 1965\n\n\"How to Murder Your Wife,\" 1965\n\n\"The Fortune Cookie,\" 1966\n\n\"Luv,\" 1967\n\n\"There Comes a Day,\" 1968\n\n\"The Odd Couple,\" 1968\n\n\"The April Fools,\" 1969\n\n\"The Out-of-Towners\", 1970\n\n\"Kotch,\" 1971\n\n\"Avanti!\" 1972\n\n\"The War Between Men and Women,\" 1972\n\n\"Save the Tiger,\" 1973\n\n\"The Front Page,\" 1974\n\n\"The Prisoner of Second Avenue,\" 1974\n\n\"The Gentleman Tramp,\" 1975\n\n\"Wednesday,\" 1975\n\n\"Alex & the Gypsy,\" 1976\n\n\"Airport '77,\" 1977\n\n\"The China Syndrome,\" 1979\n\n\"Tribute,\" 1980\n\n\"Buddy Buddy,\" 1981\n\n\"Missing,\" 1982\n\n\"Mass Appeal,\" 1984\n\n\"Macaroni,\" 1986\n\n\"That's Life!\" 1986\n\n\"Dad,\" 1989\n\n\"JFK,\" 1991\n\n\"Chaplin,\" 1992\n\n\"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" 1992\n\n\"The Player,\" 1992\n\n\"Grumpy Old Men,\" 1993\n\n\"Short Cuts,\" 1993\n\n\"Grumpier Old Men,\" 1995\n\n\"The Grass Harp,\" 1995\n\n\"Hamlet,\" 1996\n\n\"My Fellow Americans,\" 1996\n\n\"Getting Away With Murder,\" 1996\n\n\"Puppies for Sale,\" 1997\n\n\"Out to Sea,\" 1997\n\n\"Odd Couple II,\" 1998\n\n\"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" 2000\n\nTelevision:\n\n\"Studio One,\" 1949\n\n\"That Wonderful Guy,\" 1949\n\n\"Toni Twin Time,\" 1950\n\n\"The Frances Langford-Don Ameche Show,\" 1951\n\n\"The Ad-Libbers,\" 1951\n\n\"Heaven for Betsy,\" 1952\n\n\"Alcoa Theatre,\" 1957\n\n\"The Entertainer,\" 1976\n\n\"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" 1987\n\n\"The Murder of Mary Phagan,\" 1988\n\n\"For Richer, for Poorer,\" 1992\n\n\"A Life in the Theater,\" 1993\n\n\"A Weekend in the Country,\" 1996\n\n\"12 Angry Men,\" 1997\n\n\"The Long Way Home,\" 1998\n\n\"Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays With Morrie,\" 1999\n\n\"Inherit the Wind,\" 1999"
