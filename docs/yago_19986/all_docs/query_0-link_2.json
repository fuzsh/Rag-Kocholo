        "text": "Of Russian/Romanian and Jewish ancestry, sultry, amber-eyed Olive Felicia Dines grew up in Westchester County, New York. She was the daughter of Max Dines and his wife Sylvia Schwartz. According to differing sources, Max may have been a journalist or an attorney.\n\nFelicia began in movies after first working as a teenage lingerie model in order to afford her dancing lessons. She then studied sociology at Pennsylvania State University (graduating with a B.A. in 1954), acted in college plays, attended drama school and eventually appeared in live TV commercials. As to her modeling bathing suits, negligees, bras and girdles, she later remarked \"There is nothing very sexy or exciting about standing around in undergarments under hot lights\" and \"Modeling was hard work for me. I never liked it very much because I kept thinking I was in a rut\".\n\nFelicia's situation improved after a talent agent spotted her playing the female lead in William Inge's play Picnic at The Players Ring Theater in 1955 (Kim Novak starred in the film version that year). Columbia executives were impressed and signed the budding starlet to a seven-year contract. Initially billed as Randy Farr, Felicia found her niche as an intelligent and sexy western leading lady, first showcased in a trio of classics directed by the veteran Delmer Daves: Der Mann ohne Furcht (1956), Zähl bis drei und bete (1957) and (in her best role yet) Der letzte Wagen (1956), opposite Richard Widmark. For the next two decades, she essayed a wide variety of characters, ranging from religious types to barmaids, from party girls to the occasional femme fatale.\n\nSandwiched in between frequent TV guest spots, Felicia excelled in just a handful of comedies and action films, notably in Billy Wilder's Küss mich, Dummkopf (1964) (as an unfaithful wife), in the poignant, idiosyncratic Jack Lemmon-directed comedy-drama Opa kann's nicht lassen (1971) (as Walter Matthau's daughter-in-law) and in the slick heist thriller Der große Coup (1973) (this time as Matthau's love interest). A talented, much underused actress, she left show biz in 1992 but made a brief comeback 22 years later to co-star in a little known comedy drama, Loser's Crown (2014).\n\nFelicia divorced her first husband, the actor Lee Farr, in 1955. Her second marriage was to Jack Lemmon, whom she had first met while he was filming Cowboy (1958). They married in 1962 in Paris during his work on Das Mädchen Irma la Douce (1963). A daughter, Courtney, was born in 1966. Latterly known as Felicia F. Lemmon, she has resided in Los Angeles, devoting time and money to various philanthropic endeavours and to her much loved feline pets."
