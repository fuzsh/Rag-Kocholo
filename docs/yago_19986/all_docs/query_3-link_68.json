        "text": "By Rita Moran\n\nChris Lemmon has a special gift — the ability to channel his famous father, Jack Lemmon, in style and substance. Chris shared many things with his father, even though his parents divorced while he was still a toddler.\n\n‘Jack Lemmon Returns’\n\nThe one-man show, starring Chris Lemmon, runs through March 29 at Rubicon Theatre, 1006 E. Main St., Ventura. Performances are at 2 and 7 p.m. Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturdays, and 2 p.m. Sundays. There is no 2 p.m. March 28 performance due to a previously scheduled event. Ticket prices generally range from $44 to $54; lower prices are available on some shows for seniors 65 and older, students 22 and younger, and groups of 12 or more. Call 667-2900 or visit rubicontheatre.org.\n\nAs Chris tells it in a 90-minute performance now at Ventura’s Rubicon Theatre, he and his dad never lost contact over the years until the senior Lemmon died in 2001. Warm reminiscences include that of the father and son sharing happy times at the piano, with Chris ultimately following his father’s fascination with the keyboard by graduating from California Institute of the Arts with degrees in classical piano and composition, along with a degree in theatrical arts. Chris also followed in his father’s footsteps onto stages and screens. Now living in New England, he writes, including a new novel, and produces feature films and television projects.\n\nBoyhood moments when they went fishing or were otherwise bonding resonate throughout “Jack Lemmon Returns,” which is written and directed by Hershey Felder, known for slice-of-life, single actor productions that peer into interesting personalities from past to present times.\n\n88 Entertainment\n\nChris Lemmon mixes music, memories and photos to pay tribute to his late father in \"Jack Lemmon Returns.\" Behind him is a shot of his dad marrying actress Felicia Farr in 1962. They would remain together until Lemmon's death in 2001.\n\nWhile Chris Lemmon is taller and calmer than Jack Lemmon appeared onstage and off, he smoothly slips into his dad’s slippers when he switches from looking back at his own life to suddenly becoming the antic actor Jack was throughout much of his onstage or screen life, and the still intense but dramatically powerful actor of his later films. To see Chris become Jack is utterly convincing. The quick, quirky movements, that rat-a-tat line delivery, the ability to turn it on for the acting gigs that distinguished Jack are convincingly recreated by Chris.\n\nThe son’s obvious talent at the keyboard blends in and out of the memory piece and giant photos of Jack Lemmon in popular roles form a well-timed backdrop for all that Chris reveals. Intermingled with the happy times are references to Jack Lemmon’s bout with alcoholism, but the primary concentration is on what a good and infinitely well-meaning father he was to Chris.\n\nBeyond the father-son tale, the show offers old-time film buffs an opportunity to relive, if briefly, vivid moments from memorable films like “Some Like It Hot,” “Mister Roberts,” “Days of Wine and Roses,” Grumpy Old Men” and “The Odd Couple, the latter two fondly rendered by Chris as his father and Matthau so effectively worked together.\n\n88 Entertainment\n\nIn this shot from \"Jack Lemmon Returns,\" Chris Lemmon recreates one of his dad's scenes in \"The Apartment\"\n\n“Jack Lemmon Returns” is a short play that Rubicon brought in when “The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe” wasn’t ready to be staged. It helped a lot that Chris Lemmon had been in Southern California with the piece earlier this year. Even more importantly, Rubicon’s producing artistic director had met Jack Lemmon years ago at an awards ceremony in Los Angeles, and he had given her his phone number in case Rubicon ever needed to contact him. Later she did call and he and his wife Felicia Farr agreed to to join a rotating cast for Rubicon’s “Love Letters,” his final onstage appearance. So a theater bond was built with Lemmon and the Rubicon.\n\nBurns mentioned before Saturday afternoon’s performance that Chris Lemmon had just returned from the West Coast to New England when he was contacted to be the replacement show. He turned right around, she said, and boarded a plan back to California, a boon for the company, and audiences as well."
