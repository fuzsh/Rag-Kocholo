Set in Norway and Iceland at the beginning of the eleventh century, Gunnar&#39;s Daughter is the story of the beautiful, spoiled Vigdis Gunnarsdatter, who is raped by the man she had wanted to love. A woman of courage and intelligence, Vigdis is toughened by adversity. Alone she raises the child conceived in violence, repeatedly defending her autonomy in a world governed by men. Alone she rebuilds her life and restores her family&#39;s honor--until an unremitting social code propels her to take the action that again destroys her happiness.<br /> <br /> First published in 1909, Gunnar&#39;s Daughter was in part a response to the rise of nationalism and Norway&#39;s search for a national identity in its Viking past. But unlike most of the Viking-inspired art of its period, Gunnar&#39;s Daughter is not a historical romance. It is a skillful conversation between two historical moments about questions as troublesome in Undset&#39;s own time--and in ours--as they were in the Saga Age: rape and revenge, civil and domestic violence, troubled marriages, and children made victims of their parents&#39; problems.",
