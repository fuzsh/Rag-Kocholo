        "text": "(1882–1949). When Germany invaded Norway in 1940, the author Sigrid Undset fled and began writing and lecturing on behalf of her war-torn country. She went first to Sweden and then to the United States, where she remained for five years. She wrote of her flight from Nazi-occupied Norway in Return to the Future (1942).\n\nSigrid Undset was born on May 20, 1882, in Kalundborg, Denmark, of Norwegian ancestry. Her father was Ingvald Martin Undset, a renowned archaeologist. Sigrid grew up in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. She worked for an electrical engineering firm for 10 years before she married artist Anders Svarstad. Only after her marriage did she begin to write. Her early novels dealt with the place of women in the middle class. They included Jenny (1911) and Images in a Mirror (1917).\n\nAfter these early books, Undset turned her attention to writing the historical novels on which her reputation rests. The author’s greatest work was the trilogy Kristin Lavransdatter. The first volume, The Bridal Wreath, appeared in 1920; the second, The Mistress of Husaby, in 1921; and the third, The Cross, in 1922. A grim and foreboding novel about a determined and strong-willed woman in the Middle Ages, it won world acclaim. Undset became a Roman Catholic convert shortly after the third novel was published. Her next large novel was The Master of Hestviken (1925–27). She was given the Nobel prize for literature in 1928. She died on June 10, 1949, in Lillehammer, near Oslo."
