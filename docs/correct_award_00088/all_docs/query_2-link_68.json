        "text": "February 9, 2017\n\nIt is very hard to do justice to the magnificence of The Master of Hestviken. And there is no question that Sigrid Undset totally deserved the Nobel Prize that she was awarded in 1928. The M of H is a tetralogy in about 1000 pages. Believe it or not, I first read it way over 55 years ago when this bookish teen found the one-volume Knopf edition on the library shelves. And it lasts! The grip was a real grip - a golden hook, and not just an old rusty one destined to disappoint. Indeed, the M of H is far better 55 years later.\n\nSome people may say: \"A tretalogy about medieval Norway? Yuk!\" But the point is that, although the M of H takes place in medieval Norway, it is really about characters who are definitely humans like you and me and for whom Ms. U claims our empathy and sympathy, for their complex struggles, their heartbreak, their endurance, their complex interior lives, and their humanity in all its good and bad. You know, people in the Middle Ages were, in fact, people. They worried about money, they wanted to get a good night's sleep, they asked themselves whether they had married wisely and/or were good parents, they suffered from angst and insecurity, they doubted their moral worthiness, and so forth..\n\nMs. U pulls us towards these people through her focus on their actions, words, and thoughts. She does not ever explain their cultural environment. Rather, their environment speaks silently only through the characters' actions. In this way, we see them in context, but we do not ever lose sight of them as persons. For example, there is a brief passage in which the protagonist realizes that his friendship has been unbalanced in the sense that his true and reliable friend is forbearing of self and has always given more to the friendship than has the protagonist. It does not matter that this significant realization takes place while the friends are talking before an open hearth in a lonely wooden manor house on the edge of a forest.\n\nHowever, I have to note that Ms. U is a mistress of the explicit description of the natural environment and the weather. And I think this is a tool of bringing us closer to the characters because, with them, we also can sense what it is like to feel snow against our faces, to ski, if we have been so fortunate, through a winter forest, to lie on a warm rock in autumn, to shudder when bed blankets freeze to the wall, etc.\n\nThere are few essential characters in the books although there are numbers of persons who appear in it and take roles at one time or another. But there are only four characters with a complete backstory, and only two of these with a completely described interior life. The four are a family consisting of mother, father, daughter, and son. The latter two are the father and son. The other characters are well drawn, but Ms. U creates a deep sense of the reality of personhood by focusing her greatest energies on these four. Like her reticence on cultural environment, this spareness creates humans who are alive on the page.\n\nAlso, as to characterization, it is a marvelous thing that Ms. U creates male characters who ring true and are actually men and not caricatures of men. This for me is an example of Ms. U's power as an artist - her ability to create full-fleshed and primary characters who are not of her gender.\n\nOtherwise, it is all here - love, hate, jealousy, diagnosable madness, dysfunction, regret, love.\n\nI won't give plot details for fear of spoiling, But I can say that, all four of the books can be categorized as the bildungsroman of the protagonist Olav Audunsson. We meet him at about age 16 as a foster son and orphan. We say farewell when he seems to be far along into his fifties. He is intensely alive. As a young man, he is beautiful, stubborn, yet insecure and aware of his youthfulness, and passionate. He is called upon - and calls upon himself - to be self-sacrificing. As a mature man he is ruthlessly introspective and harsh in his judgments of himself. His self-examination uses the tools of religion which I would expect were the tools available at the time. (Be prepared for this!) But the use of the tools adds a layer of rock-solid emotional intensity to the self-analysis. Just magnificent.\n\nAs for the first two books of the tetralogy, we have young love and young sex, accompanied by stubbornness, anger, resistance, and violence; we have waywardness, ambiguous unfaithfulness and regret; we have separation that requires immense loyalty and endurance; we have friendship and abandonment; we have the bitterness of success. We have a girl, but essentially shunned, by her family (hey! Just like today.). We have success and bitterness together. We have the hero's intensely tender conscience and his love and loyalty that requires him not to ease it. We have immense sacrifices that touch on the integrity of personhood.\n\nAs for the second two books of the tetralogy, we have grief and an increasing sense of self-recrimination and renunciation. We have a situation that essentially brings about his death when he regards himself or his past life as the cause of the situation. But, at the end, we see that, in the world as opposed to in eternity, his life has been never understood by others and that his memories and his interior life disappear like smoke. The last pages of this book are exalted, but heart-breaking.\n\nNovember 5, 2015\n\nSigrid Undset, winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1928, seems to have been largely forgotten in America. And that is truly a shame. While she experienced success in her native Norway with her early modern novels, it his her pair of Medieval epics, \"Kristin Lavransdatter\" and \"Master of Hestviken\" (the latter was published as \"Olav Audunsson\" in Norway; its English translation was given the the title seen above. More marketable to American readers that way, I suppose was the logic) that are her great works and the source of her global acclaim.\n\nIt is not lightly that I hand out 5-star ratings, but I feel confident declaring that Master of Hestviken is one of the greatest novels I have ever had the pleasure to read. It is nothing less than the entire life story of one 13th century Norwegian man, Olav. Undset has a deft touch with her characters, they are so utterly human that they seem to jump off of the page and into the readers' hearts. I'm not sure I have ever empathized with a novel's characters more easily than I did with Olav and those dear to him. Undset's prose, as translated into English by Arthur G. Chater, is effortlessly evocative, drawing us right into its setting.\n\nWhile much of this tale is deeply sad, even heartbreaking, the payoff that comes in the last 30 pages left me teary eyed. The major theme is that of the echoing ramifications of living with unshriven sin. Never once did the book lag, over the length of its near 1000 pages. These sorts of books don't really get written anymore, at that is to our collective loss. \"Master of Hestviken\" is a masterpiece.\n\nMarch 20, 2010\n\nThis book is actually a series of four: The Axe, The Snakepit, In the Wilderness, and The Son Avenger. It's the tale of the life of Olav Audunsson, a member of the landed gentry in late 13th century Norway. It's very long and filled with plenty of beautifully written detail about medieval life in Norway. The main concerns of the book seem to be the ways in which a man's sins can shape his life, and about the balance of good and bad in a person's character. The story also explores to a lesser degree a society caught between the laws and ethics of two systems: the old ways of pagan times (as in many of the sagas) and the newer ways organized around Christianity. Some of Olav's moral dilemmas stem from the conflicts between the two ways of judging between right and wrong. There is also quite a bit of exploration of sin, repentance, redemption, and forgiveness. However, the writing is never preachy.\n\nUnfortunately, I did find that while it was very interesting in most parts, some places really dragged. The Master of Hestivken is not quite as good as Kristin Lavransdatter, Undset's other work set in medieval Norway. The characters in The Master of Hestikven are not as strong - not in Undset's portrayal of them, but in their natures. Olav and his family are just not as interesting or dynamic, which causes the narrative to lose some drive.\n\nJanuary 26, 2024\n\nA monumental, beautiful novel that has it all! There’s love, there’s crime, there’s redemption and there’s longing. A beautiful depiction of first love and a beautiful, extraordinary relationships between the characters. The story is set in medieval Norway but the characters’ emotions feel so modern and real. A novel that makes you wish you had never ended it. Because, when you finish the last page, you feel empty and fulfilled at the same time. One of a kind book and well-deserved Nobel prize!\n\nMarch 31, 2014\n\nSigrid is an AMAZING epic tale weaver--this series is like the \"Kristin Lavransdatter\" series--so incredibly freaking GOOD. I NEVER get tired of her writing!! I spend my free time on a quest for books like these. Elusive....\n\nDecember 2, 2022\n\nI read Sigrid Undset's masterful \"Kristen Lavransdatter\" several years ago, and I think I may have not been mature enough -- spiritually and artistically -- to have appreciated it properly. This tetrology (four books, and about a thousand pages!) has not received the same acclaim, but it seriously blew me away and was well worth the time it demanded of me. The medieval world of rural Norway in which it is set reminded me of \"A Game of Thrones\" or \"The Lord of the Rings\" but Unset's command of human emotion, spiritual struggle and the complex interplay between individual desire, the pangs of conscience and the demands of society is far more impressive. I hesitate to give away many details, but this work traces the way in which a youthful misdeed, quite understandable in itself, can fester if left unacknowledged until it blights the lives of entire generations. Nevertheless, Unset's affection for her characters and her keen insight into their sufferings casts a bright glow of kindness and the hope of redemption over it all.\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nNarra la vida de Olav Audunssøn desde su infancia, cuando muere su padre y es criado por Steinfinn bajo la única condición de que en el futuro se case con su hija Ingunn, hasta su adultez como un rico hacendado, amado por unos y odiado por otros.\n\nPese a su ambientación histórica, no esperen una historia con batallas épicas a lo \"Game of Thrones\". Al contrario, es un análisis a los pormenores de una vida común: la familia, el matrimonio, la paternidad, la muerte, etc. Además, es un retrato muy detallado de la vida y las costumbres en la Noruega medieval.\n\nAugust 19, 2022\n\nWonderfully evocative of 13th-14th century Norway. A bit wordy at time and a LOT of focus on Catholicism (apparently Undset had just converted when she wrote this), but it reminded me a lot of the old sagas.\n\nOctober 1, 2023\n\nAn epic masterpiece of writing. The story of one man’s life and his three family members, and how his youthful actions effect the rest of his life and impact those whom he loves.\n\nI only wish there had been a map, a list of characters , and genealogy included.\n\n.\n\nJune 4, 2024\n\nI honestly need to recover from the three months that it took to devour this tome. Sigrid Undset, you slay me.\n\nFebruary 7, 2016\n\nThis is an amazing book. I read it 20 years ago and still the emotions attached to it are haunting. SUCH a picture of a faraway world.\n\nOne bit I liked:\n\nWhen he had finished his prayers, he seated himself in a corner to hear the singing to the end. He thought of what Asbjorn had told him one day of the art of reckoning - how the nature of God was revealed in figures, through the law and order that reigned in them. Arithmetica , he thought it had such a fine sound and all that the priest had expounded about the harmony of figures - how they swelled and cleft one another according to mystic and immovable laws; it was like being given an insight into one of the heavenly kingdoms; on golden chains of numbers the whole of creation was suspended, and angels and spirits ascended and descended along the links. And his heart was exalted in longing that his life also might rest in Gods hand like one of these golden links - a reckoning in which there was no fault. When that which now weighed upon him should be effaced like false notches upon a tally-stick.\n\nDecember 19, 2019\n\nfour novels in one binding - the first one is really cool, has lots of violence/action parts, talks about honor, interesting look at nordic traditions, cool plot developments. with all the talking about honor, family names, one's house, etc, it reminds one of all of those klingon episodes on star trek next generation. in contrast, books 2 and 3 are brutally slow and depressing, and while things start to pick up at the end of book 3 and beginning of book 4, the final act feels a bit anticlimactic. not bad by any means, but i think that books 2 - 4 could have been cooler if set a couple centuries prior and written by someone who wasn't so heavily religious\n\nRead\n\nJune 25, 2016\n\nThis is a novel in 4 parts, and I have only read part 1 \"The Axe\" so far (separate review). I am so reluctant to put this down, because it is excellent. But I have to finish The Brothers Karamazov before a book club meeting, and it was a little insane to try to read this one at the same time. But I will definitely come back and finish the other three parts. It is classic Undset-- beautifully written, gripping, challenging. An epic with deep insight into human nature. So far, I do not like this as well as Kristin Lavransdatter, but it is definitely worth tackling if you are a fan of Undset's work.\n\nApril 8, 2016\n\nConsists of 4 novels - The Axe, The Snake Pit, In the Wilderness and The Son Avenger. The first book is action packed from start to finish - a bloodthirsty tale of seduction, revenge and thwarted love - themes carried on throughout. The novels trace the life of the hero Olav and his family. Very strong narrative and characterisation, with immense detail on working a huge family estate in 13th Century Norway. Conflict between his religious faith and a deed committed early in his life haunts him forever. The middle two books have much less action and more reflective, building up to climax. A very profound book. The Axe is a favourite and a compulsive read.\n\nApril 26, 2008\n\nOk so I didn't actually finish it... I kind of skipped ahead to the end, near the end of the third book. The ending is much more hopeful than Kristin Lavransdatter and for that I am thankful.\n\n3 stars because the parts that are good are amazingly excellent but it was just too dense to read for fun at this point for me.\n\nI'd recommend it to anyone doing their masters or PhD in Lit, Religion or Norse history.\n\nAugust 30, 2011\n\nThis volume includes The Ax, The Snake Pit, In the Wilderness, and The Son Avenger. Although a bit dark, I enjoyed these tales tremendously and find Sigrid Undset to be a master story teller.\n\nMay 12, 2012\n\nUndset knows how to get across the fact that choices we make in our youth affect our days. Another Norwegian medieval tale.\n\nRead\n\nMay 22, 2014\n\nSomehow I got distracted while reading this fabulous book. I will return to it. Undset creates an entire world deep characters."
