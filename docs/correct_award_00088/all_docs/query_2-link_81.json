        "text": "Sigrid Undset’s trio of novels set in 14th-century Norway tells the story of a young woman named Kristin, daughter of the prosperous farmer, Lavrans (hence the name Lavaransdatter). The first novel, The Wreath, translated by Tina Nunnally, was published in 1920, with new novels published in subsequent years. Undset received a Nobel prize, and the series is considered a classic in Norwegian literature. I saw a movie adaptation years ago and had always wanted to read the books, and I enjoyed the first book quite a bit.\n\nIn The Wreath, Kristin’s family has been beset by tragedy in the death of multiple baby boys and the nearly fatal injury of Kristin’s little sister, Ulvhild. But the family maintains a strong Christian faith, albeit one that makes room for the ministrations of a local witch when it’s clear that her herbal remedies have the potential to save a life or ease pain.\n\nKristin is eventually betrothed to a man named Simon, but a scandal that ensues after Kristin is nearly raped forces her into a convent in Oslo, where she meets Erlend Nikulaussøn, who comes from wealth but was excommunicated when he had an affair with a married woman and had two children with her. He claims the relationship is over, and Kristin, despite her devout faith, can’t keep herself from falling in love with him. And so it goes.\n\nOne thing that occurred to me as I was reading was how the family’s concern for respectability kept them from equipping Kristin with the ability to seek the right kind of happiness. She was taught to prize happiness but was given few tools for seeing through scoundrels. In the early chapters of the book, she has more than one opportunity to marry a decent man, but, in one case, he was assumed to be too far below her station. In another, he was too decent to properly woo her, choosing instead to treat their potential marriage as a business arrangement. (Although, for my part, as a grown-up woman, I was impressed at Simon’s reaction to Kristin’s near-rape. Maybe having Tess of the D’Urbervilles and Angel Clare on my mind lowered my standards.)\n\nAs the book ends, everything seems to be going downhill. There are portents of misery everywhere. I put the book down feeling worried for Kristin and sad for her parents, who are having to deal with their own realizations. I hope to read the next book, The Wife, soon. (Much to my annoyance, my library has all three volumes cataloged as a single record and none are at my local branch, so it’ll be a bit of a chore to get the next two books. I actually thought I was getting the omnibus edition when I reserved this one. A minor annoyance, but still…)"
