        "text": "By Sigrid Undset\n\nThe Wild Orchid, the first volume of Nobel Prize-winning Undset’s novel The Winding Road, is the story of Paul Selmer, a typical child of the experientially emancipated, intellectually enlightened modern age. The son of upper middle class Protestant parents, who divorced when he was a teenager, Paul is raised along with his sister and two brothers by his mother to be a freethinker. Amidst the prosaic trappings of his work and play, the pursuit of a mistress and then a marriage, and with the threat of a world war looming over Norway, Paul yearns for a deeper, more abiding meaning and order for his hopes and loves.\n\n“Let me not be allowed to extinguish the spark that has again begun to glow within me.”\n\nSigrid Undset (1882–1949) was a Norwegian novelist and essayist and a convert to Catholicism. Her work is renowned for its realism and poignancy, and she is best known for her three-volume novel Kristin Lavransdatter. In 1928, Undset was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nPaperback & E-book: 360pp.\n\nE-book: Immediately following purchase, an .epub file and a .mobi (Kindle) file are available for download."
