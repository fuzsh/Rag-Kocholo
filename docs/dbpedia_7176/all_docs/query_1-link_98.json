Heavy downpours also inundated streets and homes in low-lying areas of #Kolkata city. Cyclone Remal weakened considerably after making landfall in Bangladesh’s Patuakhali district early in the morning with sustained 111 kph (69 mph) winds. The Meteorological Department in #Dhaka said the winds were now 90 kph (56 mph) with gusts to 120 kph (75 mph).
