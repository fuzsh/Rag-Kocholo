        "text": "The following exchange of letters gives an interesting picture of the three personalities involved in a knotty administrative tangle: Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Lieutenant General F.J. Halliday and Gordon Young.\n\nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar’s letter to Lieutenant General F.J. Halliday, 1857\n\nCalcutta, Sanskrit College,\n\nMay 1857.\n\nSir,\n\nWhen I had the honour to wait on you on Saturday last and solicited your permission to make a few suggestions regarding the appointment of an Inspector for South Bengal, you were pleased to direct me to submit a written memorandum upon the subject. I have accordingly availed myself of the permission and beg respectfully to suggest that if you should feel inclined to transfer me to that post, the appointment of my successor in the Sanskrit College may be made in consultation with me, as from an intimate personal knowledge of the several parties from whom the selection may be made, I think I will be best able to recommend the most proper person for the place.\n\nIf however it should be thought inexpedient to place the division under my charge on account of the Government English colleges and schools in it, I would earnestly solicit that at least the districts in which there are model schools, vis, Hooghly, Midnapur, Burdwan and Nuddea may be placed under me, the colleges and schools being without inconvenience in charge of the person who may be appointed Inspector of the Division.\n\nI have so often troubled you with the subjects connected with the Vernacular Education that I really feel ashamed to intrude any further on your valuable time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\n(Sd). “Isvar Chandra Sarma.\n\nTo the Hon’ble F. J. Halliday.”\n\nLieutenant Governor Halliday’s reply on the subject to Ishwarchandra, 1857\n\nDarjeeling\n\n27th May, 1857.\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nYou will have seen that before the receipt of your letter I had nominated Mr. Lodge to the vacant Inspectorship.\n\nIt was at first offered to Lieutenant Lees who is in Europe, but he has refused it. I shall hope soon to see you, as I am on my way to Calcutta, and it will give me much pleasure to talk to you again on the subjects which interest us both.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(Sd). “Fred. Jas. Halliday.\n\nTo Pundit Iswar Chandra Sarma, Calcutta.\n\nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar’s letter to Gordon Young, 1857\n\nCalcutta, Sanskrit College,\n\n29th August, 1857.\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nAs you are about to leave town for 3 months, I consider this a fitting occasion to intimate to you that I have made up my mind to retire from the public service in a short time. The reasons which have induced me to come to this determination are more of a private than of a public nature, and I therefore refrain from mentioning them.\n\nThe new arrangements for the Sanskrit College have not yet been fully developed and as I am desirous of completing them which will occupy two or three months more, I wish to continue in my present office until the end of December next, when I shall tender my resignation in due form.\n\nMy object in addressing you now is that you may have ample time to consider the arrangements that you may deem most desirable for supplying my place in the Education Department.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sd.) Isvar Chandra Sarma.\n\nTo W. Gordon Young Esq ,\n\nDirector of Public Instruction.\n\nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar’s letter to F.J. Halliday, 1857\n\nCalcutta, Sanskrit College,\n\n31st. August, 1857.\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nSometime ago while talking on the subject of education you were pleased to ask me for a memo, on the state of Vernacular Education in Bengal under the present system of management and I agreed at the time, though with reluctance, to submit it. On subsequent consideration however, I feel the task a very delicate one in as much as the required memo, cannot but reflect on the actions of my brother-officers and others. I therefore earnestly beg to be pardoned for not submitting the memo, as I had promised.\n\nI may here be permitted to state that I have made up my mind to retire from the public service from January next and that I have intimated my intention to Mr. Young in a demi-official note of which I venture to enclose a copy for your information also.\n\nI remain, My dear Sir,\n\nWith every sentiment of respect and esteem,\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n(Sd). Isvar Chandra Sarma.\n\nTo The Hon’ble F. J. Halliday.\n\nHalliday’s reply to Ishwarchandra, 1857\n\n31st Aug. 1857.\n\nMy Dear Pundit,\n\nI am really very sorry to hear of your intention.\n\nCome and see me on Thursday and tell me why it is that you have come to this determination.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(Sd). Fred. Jas. Halliday.\n\nTo Pundit Isvar Chandra Sarma\n\nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar’s resignation letter to Gordon Young, 1857\n\nTo W. Gordon Young Esq.,\n\nDirector of Public Instruction.\n\nSir,\n\nThe unceasing mental exertion required by the discharge of my public duties has now so seriously affected my general health, as to compel me to tender my resignation of the Education service to the Honorable the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal.\n\n2. I feel that I can no longer devote the assiduous attention to my duties which their due performance necessitates. I need repose, and in justice to the public interests, as well as to my own comforts and happiness, can only secure that repose by retiring into private life.\n\n3. The moment my health is restored, it is my intention to devote my time and attention to the composition and compilation of useful works in the Vernacular language of Bengal. Thus, although my direct official connection with the education and enlightenment of my countrymen will have ceased, I venture humbly to hope that my remaining years will still be devoted to the advancement of a great and sacred cause in which my deep and earnest interest can only close with my life.\n\n4. Among the minor causes that have led to my taking so serious a step, are the absence of all further prospects of advancement and the want of that immediate personal sympathy with the present system of education, which every conscientious servant of the Department, should possess.\n\n5. With regard to the former, I can occupy my time more profitably and with infinitely less strain upon mind and body, than in my present position. It would be idle to deny that such considerations must have weight with one who has not yet been able to make any permanent provision for his family and who fears that failing health will prevent his doing so, if he delays longer the severance of his connection with the arduous and onerous duties that belong to the offices he holds.\n\n6. With respect to the other, I feel that I have no right to obtrude my views and opinions upon the Government; yet I could not conceal from those I serve, the fact that my heart is not in my work, and that thereby my efficiency is, and must be, impaired. More I am unwilling to say, less I could not express, with the maintenance of the honesty of purpose which I deem to be an essential quality of a conscientious public servant.\n\n7. I retire with the conscious gratification that I have always labored earnestly to discharge my duties to the best of my humble ability and I trust that I shall not be deemed presumptuous in tendering my most sincere and heartfelt acknowledgments for the unvarying kindness, indulgence and consideration, which I have always experienced at the hands of the Government.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour most obedient servant\n\n(Sd.) Isvara Chandra Sarma.\n\nThe Sanskrit College\n\n5th August 1858.\n\nGordon Young’s reply to Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar’s resignation, 1858\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nIs it the case that you desire to make some alteration in your letter dated 5th of last month? If so perhaps you had better look in here some day soon and you can either do as you wish in that way or take back the letter and send another (corrected) in its place. But whatever is done should be done on an early day. I shall be here on Saturday and again on Tuesday.\n\nAs I understood from you on Saturday that you did not wish to press your application for leave, I have not sent it on to Government.”\n\n9th September. 1858.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sd.) “W. Gordon Young.\n\nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar’s letter to Halliday, 1858\n\nAfter mature deliberation I find that I cannot either with consistency or propriety omit the parts of my letter which appear objectionable to you. It is true that ill-health is one of the principal causes which have induced me to resign. But I cannot conscientiously say that that is the sole cause. If it were so, I could have applied for a long leave and renovated my health. I had often represented to you, that I frequently felt it disagreeable and inconvenient to serve Government under existing circumstances and that I considered the present system upon which the Department of Vernacular Education was conducted, was a mere waste of money. You are aware that I often met with discouragement in my way. I saw besides no prospects of advancement and more than once I felt my just claims passed over. Thus I hope you will be pleased to admit that I had reasonable grounds of complaint: but I would nevertheless have continued in my present post for sometime longer, if I were not forced to take the step I have taken by prolonged ill-health, which has made me unfit for my responsible duties, and when the above considerations had such a considerable share in the decision to which I have come, their omission in my letter would certainly have made me liable to the charge of disingenuousness. For the same reasons, I feel it very difficult to alter it now.\n\nFurther the contents of my letter, since it left my hands, have become known to a great many people and there is as much chance of the fact of the alteration becoming equally known, in which case I shall not only be lowered in the estimation Of my friends, but of the public generally.\n\n***\n\nNothing can exceed the deep regret which I have felt since I have heard from you, that the passage in question may possibly put you to some inconvenience; but words cannot express my feelings of distress when I think that unwillingly I should have given you the least cause for trouble and inconvenience. I should certainly have felt it a great relief if circumstances had permitted me to retract with any degree of consistency; but I humbly hope that you will be pleased to admit after a due consideration of circumstances I have explained at length, in what an awkward position I have been placed and how delicate and difficult it is for me now to make any alteration in my letter.\n\nWith much deference and respect and with many apologies for troubling you in a matter so purely personal to myself.\n\nI remain,\n\n15th Sep. 1858.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n(Sd.) Isvara Chandra Sarma.\n\nTo The Hon’ble F. J. Halliday.\n\nHalliday’s reply to Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar’s letter, 1858\n\n15th Sep. 1858,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your letter of this day’s date. You are mistaken in supposing that the retention of the paragraph to which you allude in your letter of resignation is likely to put me to any inconvenience. To me it is indifferent whether the paragraph be retained or not.\n\nI mentioned that I thought it possible you might be asked to explain the cause of your dissatisfaction with the administration of the department and as you expressed an insuperable objection to do this in a public form I suggested that it might be better to omit what you were unwilling to account for and merely allude to your illness which though not the sole was certainly a sufficient reason for resignation.\n\nYou ask me to admit that you have had reasonable grounds of complaint. I am quite unable to admit this as to what is now assigned as your grievance—namely (1) that you thought the present system of Vernacular Education a waste of money, (2) that you often met with discouragement and (3) that your just claims to promotion have been passed over.\n\nIt will be sufficient to say that I quite differ with you as to the last point and as to the second can see nothing in which you have ever been discouraged by me but the contrary, as to the first point it is a mere matter of opinion and moreover cannot relate to the special system of Vernacular Education with which only you had to do.\n\nI remain\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sd.) Fred Jas. Halliday.\n\nTo Pundit Isvara Chandra Sarma.\n\nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar’s letter to Halliday, 1858\n\n18th September, 1858\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nI am very glad to learn from your note that the retention of the para in my letter of resignation therein alluded to, will, in no way, put you to any inconvenience. As far as I can remember I was led to believe from the tenor of our conversation of the other day that the para might occasion such inconvenience, and were it not for that idea, I would never have alluded to it, in my letter of the 15th instant. 1 feel now, however, a great weight removed from my mind.\n\nThere is only one point upon which I would wish to say a few words. I regret I did not sufficiently explain it in my last. I never for a moment meant to say that I was ever discouraged by you. On the contrary, I am fully sensible of the encouragement which I often received from you, and I think I have given vent to my feelings on this point at the conclusion of my letter of resignation. In referring to the discouragement I met with, I meant to say, that obstruction, I often met with, in my way to remove which I was frequently obliged to trouble you. You were always pleased to lend an attentive ear to my representations and very often those obstacles were removed by your kind interference. I always felt it very disagreeable to my feelings thus frequently to trouble you. But it was merely from absolute necessity that I did so.\n\nI would not again have troubled you, if I did not think it my duty to offer an explanation upon so delicate a point concerning myself.\n\n18th Sept. 58.\n\nI remain\n\nWith great respect and esteem\n\nYours most faithfully\n\n(Sd.) Isvara Chandra Sarma.\n\nTo the Hon’ble F. J. Halliday.\n\nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar’s letter to Gordon Young, 1858\n\nMonday, 20th Sept. 58.\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nAfter a mature deliberation I find that I cannot consistently make any alteration in my letter of resignation.\n\nHoping to be excused for the delay in replying to your note.\n\nI remain\n\nWith great respect and esteem\n\nYours most faithfully\n\nSd. Isvara Chandra Sarma.\n\nTo W. Gordon Young Esq.\n\nDirector, Public Instruction.\n\nExtract of Letter of Junior Secretary to the Government of Bengal to Gordon Young, Sep 25, 1858\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 2097, dated the 18th ultimo, with its enclosure, and in reply to state that the Lieutenant Governor is pleased upon your recommendation to accept the resignation tendered by Pundit Isvara Chandra Sarma, Principal of the Sanskrit College and Special Inspector of Schools. It is to be regretted that the Pundit should have thought fit to make his retirement somewhat ungraciously, especially as he can have no fair reason for dissatisfaction. You will, however, be good enough to inform him, that he carries with him the acknowledgments of the Government for his long and zealous service in the cause of Native Education.\n\nTrue Extract\n\nSd. W. Gordon Young\n\nDirector of Public Instruction\n\nTo Pundit Isvar Chandra Sarma\n\nPrincipal, Sanskrit College.\n\nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar’s letter (extract) to Gordon Young, Oct 5, 1858\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\n“I received your letter No. 2461 yesterday noon communicating the acceptance of my resignation.\n\n***\n\n“I am already in a very disagreeable position for not having yet been able to pay the Pundits of the Female schools, and I am afraid that I will be more so, as soon as I leave my post. And though it is very desirable, in consideration of the present state of my health, that I should cease from work as soon as possible, yet I would wish on the above account to defer making over charge, if you see no particular objection, till the decision of Government on my application for the payment of the bill of the Female Schools is ascertained.\n\nSd. Iswa Chandra Sarma\n\nGordon Young’s reply to Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, 1858\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\n“As various arrangements have been made and orders issued in regard to the charge of the College, Normal School, Vernacular Schools &c., which it would be very inconvenient now to cancel, and especially as it is uncertain within what time the Supreme Government may issue final orders in the matter of Female Schools, I do not think it will be expedient on public grounds to defer, carrying out the new arrangements any longer. Had your note of the 5th been written a week or two ago I dare say your request could have been complied with, but now I think it is too late.\n\n“I trust the matter of the Female Schools will be dealt with justly and generously by the Supreme Government and that before long you will be relieved from your present awkward position in regard to these schools.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sd) W.Gordon Young\n\nTo Pundit Isvar Chandra Sarma\n\nThe Hon’ble C. E. Buckland, in his ’Bengal under the Lieutenant-Governors’ stated:\n\n“In January 1851, he” (Pundit Isvar Chandra Vidyasagar) “was appointed Principal of that” (Sanskrit) “College and introduced various reforms in the educational course and management of that Institution. In 1855 he was appointed special Inspector of Schools for the Districts of Hooghly, Burdwan, Midnapore and Nadia in addition to his duties as Principal, on a consolidated salary of Rs. 500 a month, and helped in establishing a number of model vernacular schools at a cost of Rs. 50 a month each, and also a number of girls’ schools. It was in connection with these latter that he came into conflict with the Director of Public Instruction and threw up the appointments under Government in 1858. But for some years after he continued to be an unofficial adviser of Government, being consulted by successive Lieutenant Governors… As a Government Officer he worked with remarkable zeal and intelligence and the Sanskrit College was, under his guidance, made an Anglo-Sanskrit Institution, English studies being introduced with a view to modernize the ideas of the students and render them fit for public service.”\n\nSource of letters:\n\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Isvar_Chandra_Vidyasagar,_a_story_of_his_life_and_work/Chapter_17\n\nIllustrations:\n\nVidyasagar\n\nThe Bangla Alphabets Primer created by Vidyasagar\n\nF.J.
