        "text": "Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar: India’s Renaissance Luminary\n\nIshwar Chandra Bandyopadhyay, also known as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, was a well-known figure in nineteenth-century India. Vidyasagar was born on September 26, 1820, in West Bengal, and earned the title Vidyasagar in 1839 for his extensive knowledge of Sanskrit and philosophy. He made significant contributions as an educator, linguist, and social reformer throughout his life, leaving a lasting impression on Indian society.\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar: Early Years and Scholarly Journey\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a major figure in 19th-century Bengal. His extraordinary early life and education formed the groundwork for his later achievements. Here is a look at his life and education.\n\nVidyasagar completed his law exam in 1839 and graduated from Sanskrit College in Kolkata in 1841.\n\nHis education included Sanskrit grammar, literature, dialectics, Vedanta, Smruti, and Astronomy, among other subjects.\n\nHe became the head of the Sanskrit department at Fort William College when he was twenty-one years old.\n\nHe was also instrumental in assisting renowned Bengali poet Michael Madhusudan Dutta during his studies in England.\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar: Pioneer of Inclusive Education Reform\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a trailblazing educationist who made significant contributions to education in the 19th century. Here is a look at his life and work.\n\nVidyasagar oversaw tremendous advances in administration and education as the Principal of Sanskrit College from 1851 to 1858.\n\nHe was a staunch supporter of universal education, believing that everyone, regardless of caste or gender, deserved to learn.\n\nHe opened the Sanskrit College’s doors to persons from lower castes and founded 20 model schools in various locations.\n\nVidyasagar instituted monthly exams, English, Western Sciences, Mathematics, entrance and tuition fees, and a redesigned curriculum. He changed the way Bengali was written and taught, revolutionizing the Bengali education system.\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar: Transforming Bengali Language & Letters\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a 19th-century linguist who made significant contributions to the field. Here’s a look at his life and work.\n\nVidyasagar made important contributions to linguistics, notably with respect to the Bengali language. He rebuilt the Bengali alphabet, reducing Bengali typography to 12 vowels and 40 consonants by removing Sanskrit phonemes. ‘BornoPorichoy’ (Introduction to the Letter), his book, is still used as an introductory text for learning the Bengali alphabet.\n\nHe was a key figure in the Bengal Renaissance, a cultural and intellectual movement in Bengal in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Vidyasagar’s literary works on Bengali history and literature became Bengali literary classics.\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar: Advocate of Women’s Rights & Social Change\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a social activist who challenged societal norms, championed women’s rights, and advocated for progressive reforms in the 19th century.\n\nVidyasagar was a polymath reformer who worked persistently to advance women’s rights in Indian society. His research into ancient writings convinced him that the subjugation of Hindu women was not sanctioned by religion but was the outcome of existing power dynamics.\n\nIn 1856, the Government of India passed the Widow Remarriage Act as a result of his efforts. Vidyasagar urged his own son to marry a widow in order to get support for widow remarriage.\n\nHe also battled against child marriage, building 35 girls’ schools across Bengal. Vidyasagar opposed Kulin Brahmin polygamy, which mistreated widows and fostered inequality and misery.\n\n#PW-OnlyIAS Edge\n\nSignificant Works Of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar\n\nVidyasagar’s achievements were wider than education and social reform. He created biographical notes on notable individuals in order to inspire the next generation with examples of endurance, hard work, honesty, patience, perseverance, courage, determination, and life philosophy.\n\n“Betaal Panchavinsati” (1847), “Banglar Itihaas” (1848), “Jivancharita” (1849), “Shakuntala” (1854), “Mahabharata” (1860), and “Ratnopariksha” (1886) are among his notable works. “Bidhobabivah” (1855) on widow remarriage, “Bahubivah” (1871) on prohibiting polygamy, and “Balyabivah” on the defects of child marriage are among his works on social reform.\n\nConclusion\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar, also known as the Ocean of Knowledge, made an indelible mark on Indian society as an educator, linguist, and social reformer. His efforts to promote universal education, transform Bengali education, empower women, and challenge regressive social practices have inspired future generations. Vidyasagar’s legacy as a Bengal Renaissance pioneer and champion of progressive ideals is unparalleled.\n\nPrevious Year’s Questions (Prelims)\n\nQ1. Who among the following was associated as Secretary with Hindu Female School which later came to be known as Bethune Female School?\n\nAnnie Besant\n\nDebendranath Tagore\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar\n\nSarojini Naidu"
