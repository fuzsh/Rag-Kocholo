        "text": "Today I came across an interesting read by P.E Eluu and S.N Ikwumelu on the role teaching Christian Religious Studies has played and is still playing in shaping the soul of the multi diverse country Nigeria. From a reflective viewpoint, I came to the conclusion that the teacher and the teaching method used in the classroom play a pivotal role in the students interest in the subject and lifelong memory of the teacher and the subject learnt. I among others see teaching as a called profession like priesthood where the priest is very passionate to win and indoctrinate souls to align with set spiritual beliefs and moral compass. I want to also believe the teacher of maths and English for example work with the rules governing maths principles and grammar to come up with teaching methodologies best suited for their students. I remember one strategic teacher- family meetings in my child‚Äôs primary school where I ignorantly shared concern about the teachers task and ability to take on all the subjects at the same time, forgetting how it used to be for me as a pupil in primary school. Probably I must have asked the question bearing in mind how our world is fast changing. Maybe my subconscious mind played some trick on me by asking how a teacher can be so passionately knowledgeable in all subjects. Which ever way, the point remains that the ideal teacher sets a standard and teaches from a framework of interest and passion to make learners learn something new, continually revisit shared knowledge and skills as well as independently or collaboratively come up with new ideas. What seems to be the role of the school, family unit, community, spiritual bodies(churches, mosques, other spiritual organizations and centers), children recreational centers in shaping the heart, soul and perspective of our children? Can one effectively work independently of the other or do they need each other to systematically nurture and program the adult of the future? Needless to say, I‚Äôm still researching the difference between independent, catholic and public schooling in Australia. Anyway, the point remains that education starts immediately one is born and never does this notion called education dies. Unless maybe one mentally or accidentally decides to shut him/herself out. As parents, adults, teachers? we learn from the child and vice versa. We also understand their perspective and the way they perceive the world around them are important in constructing their identity of now and the future. In solemnity to the education sector and our dearest world, I will beg to not confuse education as simply being an academic venture. Education seek to build a broad learner that is ready to contribute to the now demands of the world and not just learners that will be ready for the society of the future.

It may be noted that the HC has, in October 2019, referred certain essential questions surrounding the concerns of the functioning and structure of the Madrasa board to a Larger Bench (Writ Petition No.29324 (S/S) of 2019: Mohammad Javed Vs. State of U.P. and others). The questions referred to a larger bench are: \"(i) Since the Madarsa Board is constituted for education in 'Arbic, Urdu, Parsian, Islamic-studies, Tibb Logic, Philosophy and includes such other branches of learning as may be specified by the Board from time to time', how come persons of a particular religion are provided to be member of the same? It does not talks about exponence in the aforesaid fields, for the purposes of which the Board is constituted, but persons of specific religion. It It was put to learned Additional Chief Standing Counsel as to whether the purpose of the Board is to impart religious education only, to which he submits that a perusal of the Madarsa Education Act, 2004 does not indicate so. (ii) With a secular constitution in India can persons of a particular religion be appointed/nominated in a Board for education purposes or it should be persons belonging to any religion, who are exponent in the fields for the purposes of which the Board is constituted orsuch persons should be appointed, without any regard to religion, who are exponent in the field for the purposes of which the Board is constituted? (iii) The Act further provides the Board to function under the Minority Welfare Ministry of State of U.P., hence, a question arises as to whether it is arbitrary for providing the Madarsa education to be run under the Minority Welfare Department while all the other education institutions including those belonging to other minorities communities like Jains, Sikhs, Christians etc being run under the Education Ministry and whether it arbitrarily denies the benefit of experts of education and their policies to the children studying in Madarsa? https://lnkd.in/gPs3zDHm\n\nReligious Education in Schools Last week I took part in a debate in the UK House of Lords about religious education in schools. My fellow peers explored the role and importance of RE in modern Britain with its ever-shifting religious demographic. The role of RE in the curriculum is about more than faith. It can develop a child‚Äôs sense of our values and traditions, which in turn leads to a greater understanding of those values others hold dear. It is obviously important that children learn to be tolerant and respectful of a wide range of world views. This is why every school has a duty to deliver RE and it is a compulsory subject in all state-funded schools in England for each pupil up to the age of 18. A number of Peers queried whether we had enough RE teachers in our schools. They pointed out that this year only 44% of the recruitment target for RE was reached. Initial teacher training recruitment is challenging at the moment because of a competitive graduate labour market and we know there is work to be done here. This is why we are working to boost teacher recruitment and training. Teachers who are confident in their subject are key to maintaining standards. To address this, we are offering a ¬£10,000 bursary for RE trainee teachers who start initial teacher training in 2024-25, which we hope will encourage more people to consider RE as a subject specialism when they are looking at a career in teaching. We want more teachers signing up to teach RE because it is an integral part of the world-class education we want every child to receive. Young people have always felt the urge to question and challenge the world they are brought up in and RE gives them the means to do it. It has a vital role to play in giving children an appreciation of the richness and diversity of what makes us all human. For more information: https://lnkd.in/euavAzBb\n\nHow are we raising our children? Are we human beings or fragmented beings?! ‚ÄúWhere there is love, there is instantaneous communion with another, on the same level and at the same time. Because we are so dry, empty, and without love, we have allowed governments and systems to take over the education of our children and the direction of our lives. But governments want efficient teachings, not human beings because human beings become dangerous to governments and organised religions. That is why governments and religious organisations seek to control education. However life cannot be made to conform to a system; it cannot be forced into a framework. A mind that has merely been trained in factual knowledge is incapable of meeting life with its variety, subtlety, depths, and great heights. When we train our children according to a system of thought or a discipline, when we teach them within departmental divisions, we prevent them from growing into integrated people. Therefore they are incapable of thinking intelligently, which is to meet life as a whole.‚Äù Krishnamurti Education and the Significance of Life\n\nAll of us would perhaps agree that we need to promote education into the Indian Muslim society which has a meagre(~1%) representation at elite Indian institutes compared to its demography(~16%). And I do get messages/ideas reagrding educating the masses. I would like to share some of my thoughts regarding the same. ------- In 2019, just a year into my initiative to network Muslim educational institutes and hence promote trust and cooperation, thereby promoting education; a (BTech/MTech) student from IITM wanted to meet me. To my surprise, he travelled to Bangalore and we met at my home. He informed that he had an idea, which, when implemented would educate the entire Qawm. And, he was sad that no one was giving a heed and implement his idea. He wanted me to convince the students IITM to oblige to his ideas. I was curious but, I asked what was he planning to do with his life? He replied: I wish to get a PhD from abroad and get a job at a good institute. I asked: Will you take sometime off your job and work to develop your idea? He said: No, people can implement my idea. I will only research. If our ideas are not worthy of giving our own life, time, money and effort into, think, what we are heading into! For the last 6 years, since I have visited several schools/colleges/universities/missions run by Muslims, many of \"our\" people have stopped the conversation after they came to know that I am a Bihari. Some were explicit to say that they are turned off by religious people. Some of these places wouldn't allow me to buy things to eat(mehmaan) and they weren't on time either(not organized), so had to go hungry for hours. Upshot: There has to be groundwork to bring a change. Perhaps none of us are Hazrat Khawajah Moinuddin Chisti RA that mere writing a post would do the job. We need to dedicate even our degrees/PhDs, our comforts and aspirations to the aspiration to uplift the community. Bear the taunts and turbulations and move on. Searching for satisfaction(s) in our offices/hostels/homes won't change the condition of the Qawm. Our degrees have to serve beyond our bellies.\n\nDelhi University is introducing Manusmriti for its undergraduate students. The Teachers and students are protesting against it. Many says, it is an unconstitutional book hence can not be taught in the schools and colleges. I think, it is a wrong assumption. Manusmriti came in Post Mauryan time as many historian suggest to put Brahmins on the top of social order and ensure they are not punished for anything wrong like others. It is the 'rule based order' of a brahmanical system which the current power elite want us to consume as it seems to have never liked the idea that student read and understand Constitution of India. Why cant our students be taught from primary level, the importance of constitution and about the rights enshrined in the constitution. Times of changed now. It reflect how all those who were wearing the chola of progress and modernity actually are naked. Back to culture for them is back to unquestioned brahmanical hegemony. Back to culture, could also mean Buddhism, Jain values or Lokayat Darshan as espoused by Charvaka but it is clear those who intend to bring Manusmiriti at the helm of our education system want to justify the statue of Manu at the premises of Rajasthan High court. It is the same forces who normalised Parsuram Jayanti and put his statues everywhere. Once upon a time, there were no takers for him but today Parsusram as become the Brahmin pride. I think Delhi University should also introduce Jagadayal Goyanka of Geeta Press, Gorakhpur to the students. Goyanka's book, ' naariyo ke liye shiksha' and many other books written by him are 'short'' and ''crispy'. Student can read those book easily and understand what exactly is written for them in these text. We must not be frighten with these text. We should demand all religious text be made available to students. Let them read it. Let them find out why Buddha revolted against it. Let them understand why Raidas, Kabir, Nanaka, Tukraram and many more spoke against the oppressive social order. Let the student read Dhammapada and treatise of Carvaka. We know they wont do it because that will give students different ideas. They will ask questions and today educational system and its propagators dont want our students to debate and discuss. They dont want them to question hence they are being introduced to such text that leitimise the social and gender oppression. How can a student who read all people are born equal in our Constitution go and study a text that categorically say some people are above others. It is nothing but justification of inequality based on caste and gender in our society? Let the university explain as whether any discussion took place among its acidemia related to its introduction to students. Vidya Bhushan Rawat July 12th, 2024\n\nTangled Threads of Education: School and Society Let us remind ourselves that for a long time, thousands of teachers and various aspects of our education system have been exhibiting tendencies that run grossly contrary to the fundamental purposes of education. Educational institutions do not serve as transformative spaces for a significant portion of our child and youth population. Instead, they are sites of violence, unequal treatment, and marginalization. After all, schools and universities are not entirely independent zones operating in a vacuum. They are inextricably intertwined with the broader societal context, replete with prejudices and discrimination. Incitement to violence against specific religious or caste groups, such as advocating harm toward ‚Äúlower‚Äù castes and Muslims, has remained the order of the day. Nevertheless, in recent times, Muslims have emerged as the most dutifully chosen targets for Hindus (cutting across caste groups) to marginalize or inflict mindless violence. Our zealous Hindu society‚Äôs hatred-filled demeanor seeps through classrooms‚Äô walls and floors, desks and durries, chairs and curricular materials. In schools, private or public, our Hindu teachers may command Hindu children to beat up a Muslim child. And the schooled Hindu children follow the command without questioning the teacher. We do not learn to challenge. Irrespective of religion, we generally learn to submit in the name of respect. Or we cave in out of perceived or real fear of reprisals. Or else, we do what we are asked to do, simply to save our asses ‚Äì and we are too many of this last kind. Some of us, a tiny portion of the schooled mind (in schools), grandly ‚Äúprogress‚Äù to universities. In today‚Äôs India, universities are often the hotbeds of Hindu radicalization, in a way where the majoritarian cry of ‚ÄúGarv sey kaho hum Hindu hain‚Äù [Say it with pride that we are Hindus] has become dangerously ordinary and familiar. In this context, educators engaging critically with prevailing issues are subjected to harassment and aggression or sent to prison by networked vigilantes and Central government authorities. One after the other. No stopping. No hope in sight. The following article states ‚Äì ‚ÄúWithout the freedom of honest speech, the classroom will no longer be a place of genuine and open learning. It will instead become a space for propaganda‚Äù. Only that, anything and everything is now propaganda, and the line between ideologies and outright falsehoods, obeisance, and deceit has blurred so much that no discernment is seemingly possible. This is a July article on Tejaswini Desai‚Ä¶just one among many that illustrates and underscores the degeneration of our educational landscape. https://lnkd.in/dgs5VdwE\n\n***Is Religion the Real Challenge, or Is It Education?*** The debate between the impact of religion versus education on society is ongoing. Let's explore some data-driven insights to understand which issue poses a greater challenge. üîç **Literacy Rates Across Religions:** Higher literacy rates are often associated with reduced religious extremism. For instance, in India, literacy rates vary significantly among different religious communities, with some lagging behind. This gap highlights the crucial role education plays in shaping perspectives. üìà **Education and Social Development:** Education is a powerful driver of economic growth and social progress. Countries with strong education systems tend to have higher GDPs and more cohesive societies. Education fosters critical thinking, tolerance, and understanding‚Äîessential elements for a harmonious society. üöß **Religion's Influence on Social Policies:** In some regions, religious beliefs have influenced restrictive policies, particularly concerning women's rights and scientific progress. Countries where religion heavily influences politics often struggle to implement progressive social policies. ü§î **The Bigger Challenge:** While religion can be divisive, especially when intertwined with politics, the root of many societal issues often lies in education. A lack of access to quality education exacerbates religious extremism and hinders overall progress. Addressing educational disparities is key to building more inclusive and forward-thinking societies. üí° **Conclusion:** Education, not religion, should be the focal point of our efforts. By prioritizing education, we can mitigate the challenges posed by religious extremism and create a more equitable and prosperous world. #EducationMatters #SocialDevelopment #EconomicGrowth #CriticalThinking #Inclusion #Equality #Progress #LiteracyRates #Society #ReligionAndPolitics #EducationForAll"
