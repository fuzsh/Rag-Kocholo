        "text": "Iswarchandra Vidyasagar was one of the leading lights of the nineteenth century Bengal Renaissance. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he was truly secular in his life & works. He involved himself in a number of social and educational reform activities responding to the necessities of the time. Vidyasagar was the crusader for the rights of the women. He successfully led the movement for the rights of the widows to remarry. He also fought against the practices of polygamy and child marriage prevalent during the time. In matters of education, he was the first to introduce modern concepts of knowledge in the courses of the Sanskrit College. He also introduced various measures for giving the system of education in the Sanskrit College a modern look. Vidyasagar felt the necessity of spreading education in vernacular language and, therefore, took upon himself the responsibility of writing Bengali primers. In those primers, he tried to inculcate liberal values among the minds of the young learners. He also penned a number of books in Sanskrit and Bengali for the students of the higher classes. Vidyasagar took active interests in the spread of female education too. On his own initiative, he established forty girls’ schools in the four districts of Bengal. In the later part of his life, he took the responsibility of the Metropolitan College (presently, Vidyasagar College) and turned this college, managed fully by the Indians only, as the largest college of Bengal. In this article, an attempt has been made to delineate some of the activities of Vidyasagar in the realm of education for which we are still remaining grateful to him.\n\nDifferent scholars in their studies have pointed out that the bulk of the earliest colonial literature was aimed at highlighting ‘the peculiarities of Hindu tradition’ and especially the ‘barbarities’ Indian women were subjected to. Colonial literature abounds with images of the Indian woman/girl as a victim of different kinds of gendered oppression. Many scholars have pointed out that a society’s treatment of its women was frequently held as evidence of its degree of civilization. Thus, one of the ways in which the Colonizers tried distinguish themselves from the Colonized was by promoting a discourse of gendered difference, where the Colonizers were projected as ‘paternalists’ who would help in liberating the Indian women from the shackles of traditional oppression. The reformist resolution of the question of enforced ascetic widowhood, thus, needs to be placed in the larger context of Colonial Agenda."
