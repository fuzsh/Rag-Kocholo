        "text": "The West Bengal Assembly passed the Sanskrit College and University, West Bengal Bill 2015 to create a nodal centre in learning Sanskrit in the nation. The 191 year old Sanskrit College in the state would get complete upgradation by this bill and its properties and liabilities would be with the university.\n\nThe objective of creating such a university is to create a nodal centre for Sanskrit language studies among the students of the present generation. The university would also undergo teachings in various other Indian Languages, Indology, Indian Philosophy, Comparative Literature, Humanities and Cognitive Science. It would include some of the foreign languages as course material as well, which has close associations with the Sanskrit language.\n\nThe Sanskrit College foundation stone was laid way back in the British regime by the recommendations of James Prinsep and Thomas Babington Macaulay in the year 1824. It is situated near the Presidency College (now Presidency University) at the famous College Street, better known as the Oxford of the East in Kolkata.\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar, the eminent scholar was the principal of Sanskrit College. He was a key figure in Bengal Renaissance and has been an eminent scholar for the British India. The college has luminous alumni including the father of Bengal School of Painting, Abanindranath Tagore. The college has long been an epitome of literature, pride and culture for the people of the state. The deliberations regarding the passing of the bill was on for a long time now, which finally got green light in the assembly."
