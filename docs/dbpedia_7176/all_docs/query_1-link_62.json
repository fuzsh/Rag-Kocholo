        "text": "Bethune College, a centre for academic excellence and achievement, started its journey in 1879. Being the first women's college in India as well as in Asia, Bethune College produced the first two female graduates of the entire British colonial Empire who made their mark, left significant contributions and inspired generations to come. Since its establishment, Bethune College has helped in enlightening women's lives by playing a pivotal role in women's education and emancipation.\n\nThe journey of Bethune College began on 16th June, 1879. The Calcutta Gazette published the news of appointment of Baboo Sosi Bhusan Dutt, (Lecturer of Ravenshaw College, Cuttack) on 16th June, 1879 as the First Lecturer of the College Department of Bethune School. Therefore, 16th June, 1879 has been accepted as the foundation day of Bethune College.\n\nIn 1879, Bethune College classes started with one student Kadambini Bose in First Year Arts and very soon Chandramukhi Bose also joined the class in 1881 after completing her First Year Arts from Free Church Normal School. Since 1880, Bethune College was open to the female students of all religious backgrounds.\n\nBoth Chandramukhi Bose and Kadambini Ganguly (Bose) were students of Bethune College in 1881 as they were studying for the Degree Examination. Special scholarships of Rupees 25 and Rupees 20 were awarded to them for that purpose. In 1883, both Chandramukhi Bose and Kadambini Ganguly passed in the BA examination from Bethune College and thus they became first female graduates of the Calcutta University as well as the entire British Colonial Empire. Since then Bethune College made a mark in producing notable students.\n\nBethune College got affiliation from University of Calcutta in 1888 and made rapid progress in the following decades. Students of Bethune College performed well at University examinations from Entrance to BA. They were awarded with gold and silver medals and also scholarships of junior and senior grade. Prize distribution ceremony was observed with great zeal. Renowned personalities visited the College and recorded their appreciations of its teaching- learning process. Meetings and conferences as well as exhibition of handicrafts were held on regular basis. Bethune College thus was turning into a venue for various activities of women.\n\nIn connection with the Annual Session of Indian National Congress held in December, 1906 in Calcutta, a huge women's meeting was held in Bethune College where different problems regarding the condition of women in society were discussed.\n\nTill session 1915-16, Bethune College was not affiliated in any Honours subject. Students had to appear as non-collegiate students and then sit for the Honours examinations. But success of Tatini Gupta (Das) in Sanskrit and Sita Chattopadhyay and Sujata Basu in English paved the way for the affiliation of Honours in Bethune College in Sanskrit and English in 1917.\n\nIn this session of 1916-17, Bethune College was also affiliated in Mathematics upto the IA (Intermediate) standard. The affiliation received by Bethune College upto 1921-22 were as follows : English, Vernacular Composition, Sanskrit, History, Logic, Botany and Mathematics in Intermediate, English, Philosophy, History, Sanskrit, Vernacular Composition, Economics and Mathematics in BA Pass, and English and Sanskrit in BA Honours.\n\nIn the session 1923-24, Philosophy and Mathematics (Mathematics being the First Science Honours Subject) were added to the Honours subjects. In the same session, Bethune College secured affiliation upto I.Sc standard; a laboratory was also equipped for this purpose.\n\nIn the session 1923-24, Bethune College had its first Muslim student on its roll as Fazilatunnesa Zoha (after finishing her studies from Eden Female School, Dhaka) joined the College and passed from the college in 1925. She later also became the first Bengali Muslim woman to earn a post graduate degree and to go abroad for higher studies.\n\nIn 1935, Bethune College received affiliation to the Honours course in Economics also.\n\nPolitical currents in colonial India had major repercussions on educational institutions. The political unrest of the late colonial era had its effect on the student strength particularly in the 1930s. During the Civil Disobedience Movement, specially in 1932, student enrolment in Bethune College was highly affected. The rise and fall in student enrolment continued also in the following tumultuous years of the Second World War. During the Second World War, various extra-academic activities of the College were necessarily curtailed. But 1949 onwards, the rolls of Bethune College once again started swelling.\n\nIn the following decades, Bethune College continued to disseminate knowledge with much warmth and vigour and the students of the College performed well in both Arts and Science streams."
