Bethune College Sammilani fought for this recovery. Both Chandramukhi Bose and Kadambini Ganguly (Bose) were students of college classes of Bethune School in 1881 as they were studying for the Degree Examination. In 1883, both Chandramukhi Bose and Kadambini Ganguly passed in the BA examination from the College department of the Bethune School and thus they became first female graduates of the British Colonial empire.
