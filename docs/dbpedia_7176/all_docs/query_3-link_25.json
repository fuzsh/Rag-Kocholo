        "text": "Manifest Pedagogy:\n\nIssues and personalities in news are a good trigger for UPSC to pick questions from. In both preliminary and mains, the role and ideologies of personalities are taking centre stage. The Questions in the new pattern are looking at very detailed events in individual personalities life and comparing ideologies of various personalities.\n\nIn news\n\nViolence in Calcutta during election and damage to the statue of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar\n\nPlacing it in the syllabus\n\nModern Indian History\n\nDimensions\n\nHis time period\n\nContributions to widow remarriage\n\nContributions to women’s education\n\nRole as Sanskrit scholar\n\nContent\n\nHis time period\n\nHe was born on 26 September 1820 in Midnapore district of Bengal Presidency(now in West Bengal.\n\nFrom 1829 to 1841 Vidyasagar learned Vedanta, Vyakaran, Literature, Rhetoric’s, Smriti and Ethics in Sanskrit college.\n\nMeanwhile, he took part in a competition testing knowledge in Sanskrit in 1839 and earned the title of ‘Vidyasagar’ meaning Ocean of Knowledge. In the same year, Ishwar Chandra cleared his Law examination.\n\nVidyasagar joined the Fort William College as the Head Pandit in the Sanskrit department in 1841.\n\nIn 1846, Vidyasagar left Fort William College and joined the Sanskrit College as ‘Assistant Secretary’.\n\nIn 1849 he supported John Elliot Bethune to establish the first permanent girls’ school in India, the Bethune School.\n\nIn 1851, Vidyasagar became Principal of Sanskrit College.\n\nIn 1854, Vidyasagar started his campaign for widow remarriage.\n\nIn 1854, he began writing against the practice of ascetic widowhood for Tattvabodhini Patrika, a progressive journal.\n\nVidyasagar assumed the responsibilities as a special inspector of schools with additional charges and travelled to remote villages in Bengal to oversee the quality of education in 1855.\n\nHis arguments with the British brought Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act in 1856\n\nVidyasagar died at the age of 70 in 1891.\n\nContributions to widow remarriage\n\nVidyasagar was always vocal about the women who were subjected to oppression by society at that time.\n\nHe was very close to his mother, a woman of great character, who once instructed him to do something to alleviate the pain and helplessness of Hindu widows, who had to live a life of self-denial.\n\nThe women were denied basic pleasures of life, marginalized in the society, often exploited unfairly and treated as a burden by their family.\n\nThe compassionate heart of Vidyasagar could not take their plight and he made it his mission to improve the quality of life for these helpless women.\n\nIshwar Chandra challenged the Brahminical authorities and proved that widow remarriage is sanctioned by Vedic scriptures.\n\nVidyasagar took his arguments to the British Authorities and his pleas were heard when the Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act, 1856 or Act was decreed on July 26, 1856.\n\nTo set an example Vidyasagar initiated several matches for child or adolescent widows within respectable families and even married his son Narayan Chandra to an adolescent widow in 1870.\n\nContributions to women’s education\n\nIshwar Chandra was a keen advocate of education for women. He rightly viewed education as the primary way for women to emancipate themselves from all the social oppression they had to face at the time.\n\nHe exercised his power and lobbied hard for opening of school for girls and even outlined a suitable curriculum that not only did educate them but also enabled them to be self-reliant through vocations like needlework.\n\nHe went door to door, asking family heads to allow their daughters to be enrolled in schools. Throughout Bengal, he opened 35 women’s schools and succeeded in enrolling 1300 students.\n\nTo support women education Vidyasagar organized a fund called Nari Siksha Bhandar.\n\nHe supported John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune to establish the first permanent girls’ school in India, the Bethune School, on May 7, 1849.\n\nVidyasagar expressed his ideas through regular articles he wrote for periodicals and newspapers. He was associated with prestigious journalistic publications like ‘Tattwabodhini Patrika’, ‘Somprakash’, ‘Sarbashubhankari Patrika’ and ‘Hindu Patriot’.\n\nRole as Sanskrit scholar"
