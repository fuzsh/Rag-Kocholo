        "text": "In the period of the 19th century, India has given birth to a starlike personality in the name of Ishwar Chandra Bandopadhyay. He was a real hero and down to earth in his habit. He dedicated his life for draw out the nation to light from the darkness. He was a polymath, educator, social reformer, writer, and philanthropist. He was one of the greatest intellectuals and activists of the 19th century and one of the pillars of the Bengal Renaissance who had given a shape and direction. Above All, he is a strong symbol of a versatile personality. He is called in the name of Vidyasagar (The Ocean of Knowledge) and Dayarsagar (The Ocean of Kindness) for her dignified thoughts and works. Researchers have highlighted the versatility of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in their theoretical research. From their research, Vidyasagar will be known as such a meritorious student; Similarly, there will be an opportunity to know Vidyasagar&#39;s philosophical thoughts, educational thoughts, social reform, ...\n\nVidyasagar was a polymath and a key figure of the Bengali renaissance | Wikimedia During the bicentennial year of the birth of Vidyasagar, what does it mean to celebrate the man and honour his legacy? This year India celebrates the 200 th birth anniversary of Ishvarchandra Vidyasagar (1820-1891), the great reformer, educator, printer-publisher and prose stylist. Since his birthday last year on 26 September, there have already been numerous events dedicated to remembering and honouring his life, from his birthplace in Birsingha to the rural retreat he built for himself in Karmatar, and, of course, in Kolkata where his professional career largely unfolded. Politicians, scholars, artists, and a host of ordinary citizens have all found ways to recognise the achievements of a tireless change agent who advocated on behalf of Hindu widows, opened up new pathways in vernacular education, experimented with new models for Bengali publishing, and placed his stamp on the very character and style of modern Bengali culture. But the man we celebrate was also something of an enigma: he was famously elusive on questions of faith, curiously wed to projects of radical change framed in relation to scriptural authority, and simultaneously both a social elite and a man of the people. In the past it has been fashionable to engage in wordplay around the relative balance of tradition and modernity in Vidyasagar. It is time to be done with all that. Let us just say it: he was a thoroughly modern individual, even if also a colonial subject. Instead of focusing on tradition and modernity, I propose we consider recognising two important dimensions of the man, what I call the major and the minor Vidyasagar.\n\nIswar Chandra Vidyasagar as a philanthropist and humanist has evoked interest in various research fields and conversations across generations. When it comes to the pathos of the Indian society during the nineteenth century it is inclusive of the efforts undertaken to deal or fight the same. In this context, a polymath stands as a primary factor and an exemplary figure for the much-needed awakening of young and new generations. Vidyasagar not only as a humanist but also as a human being has been at the forefront of the renaissance we are acquainted with as far as the Bengal chapter in the nineteenth century is concerned. His academic and philosophical endeavours have gathered attention of scholars, officer-administrators, etc. time and again. His adventures and experiences may be evaluated in various ways; in one aspect as a coming of age game changer in the Indian society, and, in the other as a humanist who brought in shades of life in every undertaking he was associated with or displayed immense passion about. This paper is meant to highlight the exceptionality of Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, based on primary and secondary sources, and how his endeavours have left an impression in the minds of potential radicals.\n\nAbstractAmbedkar was a beckoning leader of the Untouchables, but he was also much more- patriot, scholar, thinker and Founding Father of the Indian Constitution. Babasaheb&#39;s contribution to the advancement of education in the country is multifarious. Educate, Organize and Agitate was his burning message. His empowerment refers to increase in the spiritual, political, social, racial, educational, gender or economic strength of individuals and communities. The term empowerment covers a vast landscape of meanings, interpretations, definitions and disciplines ranging from psychology and philosophy to the highly commercialized self-help industry and motivational sciences. Ambedkar wanted the people to cultivate the values of freedom and equality among themselves; it is possible only through education. He regarded education as a means to reach the doors of light and perception to remove the regions of darkness and ignorance. Ambedkar emphasized on secular education for social emancipa...\n\nDr. Ambedkar was a champion of social justice and an intellectual personality who made efforts to lead the society on the way to equality, liberty and fraternity. He learned from his experiences and all through his life raised voice for downtrodden. He advocated to break down all obstacles in the way of advancement of marginalized in India. He laid the foundation of concrete base for education and empowerment of the masses in the Indian society. There is need to revisit his educational philosophy in present times. This paper is a modest attempt to describe the Dr. B. R. Ambedkar’s idea on education in India and his works for educational empowerment of the peoples. It will examine the methodological and theoretical aspect of his educational philosophy and its new tone as well as strength. Finally, this paper will pay attention to the thoughts of Dr. Ambedkar on need of education in India and its relevance contemporary time and space.\n\nDr Babasaheb has been one of the most influential politicians, economists, thinkers, philosophers, lawyers, leaders and educationists in India whose contribution in drafting the Indian Constitution is Hyperion. He has been a great thinker on Indian education system.Being the architect of modern India, his contributions in every field are of greater significance. The present paper attempts to anaylze the thoughts of Dr Ambedkar on education. Dr Ambedkar advocat ed for education as a to ol for emancipation and social justice, particularly for marginalized communities. Dr Ambedkar's considers education as a means to challenge caste-based oppression, promote equality and empower individuals to assert their rights and dignity. He has triggered several educational practices, principles, highlighting initiatives that aim to take apart systematic inequalities and foster inclusive learning environments. Dr Ambedkar has been a visionary for education in fostering liberation and social transformation."
