        "text": "Isvar Chandra Vidyasagar (born Sept. 26, 1820, Birsingha, Midnapore district [India]—died July 29, 1891) was an Indian educator and social reformer considered the father of Bengali prose.\n\nHe was a brilliant student at Sanskrit College, Calcutta (now Kolkata), where he received the title Vidyasagar (“Ocean of Learning”), and in 1850 he was appointed head pandit (scholar-teacher) of Fort William College, Calcutta. A year later he became principal of Sanskrit College, where he promoted the study of English and admitted students of lower castes.\n\nVidyasagar was well-read in English literature and was influenced by Western ideas. Although an orthodox high-caste Brahman, he took a leading part in social reform movements, notably a successful campaign to legalize remarriage of widows, many of whom had been married for the first time in childhood. He opposed child marriage and polygamy and did much to promote the education of girls, but his reforming zeal met with much opposition from orthodox Hindus."
