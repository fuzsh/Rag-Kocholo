He also fought for women's education and vigorously challenged the barbaric practice of child marriage. Standing tall against the conservative power centres of Hindu society, Vidyasagar was a man who was way ahead of his times. In light of the desecration of his statue, it is time to remind ourselves about this visionary of modern Indian history. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's pioneering work in Bengali prose certainly deserves the very best of appreciation. He mostly devoted his time writing reformist literature and textbooks. Vidyasagar cannot be judged as one of the best pure literary figures of Bengal but his simplification of idiomatic expressions and clarification of the writing style provided the sound base on which latter Bengali writers like Tekchand Thakur, Pyarichand Mitra and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee built their literary superstructures. Vidhyasagar also wrote biographical notes on numerous noteworthy personalities in the history of the world so that the young generation could be inspired by reading the great examples of their endurance, hard work, honesty, patience, perseverance, courage, determination and philosophy of life. Disillusioned by the lack of tangible public support, he spent the last two decades with the Santhal tribes in present-day Jharkhand. There, he opened the first school for tribal girls. The present book offers a comprehensive insite of the life and legacy of the Indian reformer and intellectual, Ishvarchandra Vidyasagar (1820-91).

At present he is Lecturer in the Department of Political Science at M.J.K. College, Champaran, a unit of B.R.A. Bihar University, Muzaffarpur.

He has also attended many national and international seminars.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a legendary educationist, a Sanskrit scholar and a social reformer who not only changed the Bengali alphabet and type but also challenged Hindu orthodoxy by playing a pivotal role in passing the Widow Remarriage Act. He also fought for women's education and vigorously challenged the barbaric practice of child marriage. Standing tall against the conservative power centres of Hindu society, Vidyasagar was a man who was way ahead of his times. In light of the desecration of his statue, it is time to remind ourselves about this visionary of modern Indian history. Born on 26 September 1820 into a poor Brahmin family in Birsing village of Midnapore district, West Bengal, Ishwar Chandra Bandyopadhyay was only six-years-old when he was sent to be educated in Kolkata. He was no ordinary student, passing each exam with flying colours, while also finding a way to support himself financially as a tutor for kids in another wealthy household. With limited means, he continued his education at the Sanskrit College of Kolkata, where he studied for 12 years. He then picked up a law degree and went on to join Fort William College as the head of their Sanskrit Department. After five years, in 1846, Vidyasagar joined the Sanskrit College as principal.\n\nIshwar Chandra's Philosophy of Education was based on humanity. He deeply observed the problems and weakness in the then education system. He knew to change the fate of crore of Indians, education is the only weapon. As that time, he studied in the Sanskrit college he closely observed the situation of Indian Education System. So, he dedicated himself for the reconstruction of education system. As a principal, he opened the door of Sanskrit college for all. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's pioneering work in Bengali prose certainly deserves the very best of appreciation. He mostly devoted his time writing reformist literature and textbooks. Vidyasagar cannot be judged as one of the best pure literary figures of Bengal but his simplification of idiomatic expressions and clarification of the writing style provided the sound base on which latter Bengali writers like Tekchand Thakur, Pyarichand Mitra and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee built their literary superstructures. Vidhyasagar also wrote biographical notes on numerous noteworthy personalities in the history of the world so that the young generation could be inspired by reading the great examples of their endurance, hard work, honesty, patience, perseverance, courage, determination and philosophy of life. It was in 1854 that Vidyasagar began his campaign for widow remarriage. The 19th century was a particularly terrible time for women, especially for pre-pubescent girls from poor families, who were forced into marriages with older men. Once their husbands died, they had to spend the rest of their lives wearing white saris, give up all material comforts and live a stigmatised and isolated existence. Seeing this unprogressive practice play out before his own eyes, Vidyasagar was determined to stamp it out. The following year, he filed a petition before the government of the day, seeking legislation that would allow widow remarriage. Although support for his campaign came from influential figures like the Maharaja of Bardhaman Mahtabchand Bahadur, a lot of back lash came from powerful conservative groups within Hindu society. In fact, the government received more than 30,000 signatures challenging Ishwar Chandra's petition. However, his sustained efforts, alongside fellow social reformers finally resulted in the passing of the Widow Remarriage Act on 26 July 1856. Despite their success in passing a law, the real challenge was getting society to accept widow remarriage. Ishwar Chandra took the challenge and performed the first widow remarriage in Kolkata on 7 December 1856 on his own dime. Disillusioned by the lack of tangible public support, he spent the last two decades with the Santhal tribes in present-day Jharkhand. There, he opened the first school for tribal girls.\n\nThe present book offers a comprehensive insite of the life and legacy of the Indian reformer and intellectual, Ishvarchandra Vidyasagar (1820-91). A must read book for all who are interested in the social life of british raj and reformers struggle in bengal.\n\n**Contents and Sample Pages**"
