        "text": "The world today we live in is a world of material ease and comfort, of luxury and abundance. And in such a society education plays a vital role in achieving the country's vision of attaining the status of a fully developed nation in terms of economic development, social justice, spiritual, moral and ethical strength towards creating a society that is united democratic, liberal and dynamic. But the scenario was altogether different in the eighteenth century Bengal. Education was then not considered as compulsory and there was no concept of universal education or state-sponsored education. People were then naive and ignorant but this ignorance was not a bliss for them. Being devoid of education they were then controlled and dictated by religious orthodoxy and tyranny, various rituals, customs and degrading superstitions. Casteism, untouchability were very much in practice."
