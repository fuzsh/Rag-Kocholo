        "text": "Growing up in poverty\n\nThakurdas Bandopadhyay, his father, made a meager Rs 8 per month. Since his family could not afford a gas lamp, Vidyasagar studied under the streetlights. He spent his early years in his hamlet before moving to Calcutta to further his education. Receiving many educational scholarships he attended the Sanskrit College in Kolkata (then Calcutta). Later, he worked as a publisher, writer, and bookseller paralelly.\n\nBringing educational reform\n\nHe had previously held positions at Sanskrit College as an assistant secretary and a professor of literature before taking the helm as its principal in 1851. Vidyasagar and other reformers opened numerous schools for women throughout Bengal between 1851 and 1855. He opened 35 schools with his own money and accepted 1,300 students. He also helped establish the Calcutta Metropolitan Institution for Higher Education.\n\nFrom Ishwar Chandra Bandhopadhyay to Vidyasagar\n\nHis excellence in Sanskrit and philosophy at the Sanskrit College, earned him the honorific title \"Vidyasagar,\" meaning \"Ocean of Knowledge.\" Vidyasagar's fight against child marriage resulted in the Age of Consent Act, 1891 setting a minimum consummation age of 12.\n\nEnabling education for all\n\nWhen he saw the issues with the educational system, Vidyasagar committed himself to its reconstruction. He welcomed everyone into the Sanskrit College in his capacity as principal. It was previously a Brahmin and Vaidya-only institution. He also fixed the weekly holiday and nominal fees. He used the mother tongue to expand education and made English and Bengali the medium instead of Sanskrit.\n\nHis work towards girls' education\n\nVidyasagar advocated for equal educational opportunities for men and women, regardless of caste. Although he faced rejection, he stood his ground and advocated for the right to education. He spent his last 18 years working with tribal people, establishing a school for women, and attempting to educate adults in Jamtara, in modern-day Jharkhand. He even proposed the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856 in India.\n\nWhy is he still honored?\n\nVidyasagar can be regarded as the first architect of national education, he also streamlined the Bengali alphabet. At a time when the value of education was underestimated, he paved the way for making education accessible to all. While attending college is still a distant reality for certain rural Indians today, education has undergone a radical change. This transformation owes itself to visionaries like Vidyasagar."
