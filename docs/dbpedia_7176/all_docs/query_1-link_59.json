        "text": "Social Capital in Virtuous Organization: Diagnosis Components of Social Capital in Religious Holy Places https://lnkd.in/eun5mwCa Authors: Hamzeh Ramezani Bidgoli Mohammad Hossein Rahmati Sedigheh Tootian Esfahani 1 Department of Public Administration, Faculty of Management and Economic, Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch, Tehran, Iran 2 Department of Public Administration, Faculty of Management, Farabi Campus, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran 3 Department of Public Administration, Faculty of Management, Islamic Azad University, West Branch, Tehran, Iran Abstract: Among the virtuous organizations, the organizations in charge of religious holy places, despite their impact on creating and maintaining social capital, have received less attention in scientific researches related to organization and management, especially from the dimension of diagnosis components. Therefore, the present study has investigated the components of social capital in the holy shrine of Razavi and the holy shrines of Hazrat Fatima Masoumeh and Hazrat Abdulazim Hasni, with a qualitative approach. In this research, a comprehensive combination of meta-synthesis, theme analysis and interviews were used. Theoretical data were collected from 22 diagnosis models and some selected documents from the studied organizations. Operational data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 18 selected experts using judgmental and snowball samplying until theoretical saturation. The validity of the research was confirmed by referring to various methods, including the quality of the primary studies, using independent analysts, reviews and transparency. The validity of interviews was confirmed by the retest method. This research is the first attempt on religious holy places in Islamic Republic of Iran, in which 258 themes extracted from library data were combined with themes derived from ideas and opinions of experts. Based on the findings, the components of social capital diagnosis in religious holy places include fundamental values, symbolic capital, organizational competencies, spiritual capital, people's capital and cultural capital. These components strengthen social capital and high human values in the Islamic society by creating trust, interaction, and cooperation among the members of the society and influencing the hearts and souls.

Alpha-Defensive is the one side of society‚Äôs normal Social Dualism. The other side is Omega-Passive with the centre being the optimal social growth path. The status wavers between Omega and Alpha depending on external social stresses imposed on a sub-society. Sub-societies self-monitor and self-correct while alternating between Omega and Alpha. Idealy they should be on the more stable Omega side, just off centre from the central position for emotionally stable economic growth, although society could stagnate in the long term without challenges. Within these limits improving amenity grows strong bonds and dwindling enmity weakens contentions. To extend these to the outer edges of Omega-Passive and Alpha-Defensive limits is neither easy of quick although, from the outside, they may be seen as excessively emotional sensitive, sudden situations this is not the observation of the build-up of stresses and challenges that hit a breaking point. Emotional Excursions occur when the internal moderation is overwhelmed by external stimulation. Omega-Passive becomes Omega-Exuberant and Alpha-Defensive becomes Alpha-Panic while emotions overwhelm rational processes. To stabilise the situation economists need to apply tools that will calm the emotions and bring the sub-society into rational self-control. This implies winning the trust of the sub-society so that they respond to positive stimulation although they are emotionally unstable. The longer an Emotional Excursion endure, inter-social bonds break and more likely undesirable reactionary bonds form. Looking deep into the sudden socio-economic crises events occurring, external controls and stimulations cause the self-moderation to fail. With the Alpha-Defensive becoming Alpha-Panic. Increasingly leaders have to either bribe or suppress sub-societies so that they don‚Äôt Delaminate. This suppression hardens as resistance grows past an easy means to roll back the situation. The pressure high all that is needed is a trigger. The longer this remains unresolved the more opportunists and undesirable allies join in and the lesser the requirements for what is a hair-trigger. The pent-up power grows with the trigger event parameters weakening. The pushback starts with passive demonstrations, civil disobedience but as more unsavoury parties pile in the Alpha-Panic becomes Alpha-Delamination as the sub-society separates from the local legal entity and rebels. The Southport Girls were murdered in a provocatively brutal manner by an outsider in a time where sub-societies were under economic pressure, crimes and attacks from an illegal foreign group. Somewhere, somehow there was a rumour and false fact that exacerbated the situation that was not addressed until the situation had escalated. A large chunk of UK Society has just Delaminated!!!\n\nEmpowering Youth to speak up and embrace their well-being! üåüHello everybody! Im pleased to announce that I‚Äôm starting my productive journey with ASEAN Youth Organization - India Chapterüåü Wondering what is AYO‚ùì For those unfamiliar, AYO India is the Indian chapter of the ASEAN Youth Organization, an ASEAN approved non-profit youth organization that aims to foster a sense of community and collaboration among the youth of ASEAN member countries and their global counterparts and engage the youth in cross-cultural connections, building a better future together. ‚ùóMy Focus: Mental Health #ItsOkayToNotBeOkay I will be dedicating my time at AYO on breaking the stigma surrounding youth mental health. Young people often face academic pressure, social media stress, family issues, depression, and anxiety, yet they keep their emotions bottled up due to fear of judgment and societal barriers. According to WHO, one in seven adolescents aged 10‚Äì19 experiences a mental disorder, representing 13% of the global disease burden in this age group. The National Mental Health Survey of India (NMHS) estimates that 7.39% of people aged 18‚Äì29 in India have a mental disorder. The COVID-19 pandemic and increased social media use have worsened this crisis. Mental health is a crucial global issue, and creating supportive environments for those in need is essential. Its absolutely normal to suffer from a mental issue, and i would say whoever is reading this, reach out to your family and peers and have an open, heartfelt conversation with them! We all can make a change by doing the bare minimum! I am grateful to AYO for providing a platform to address such a pivotal issue. A special mention to AYO India Volunteer Head Lolad Pegu and Country Director Taneesha Kaur Sethi for giving us the right direction towards making an invaluable impact on society. Let's amplify the voices of the youth and break the taboo!! BREAK THE SILENCE, BREAK THE STIGMA! üí™ #ASEANYouth #MentalHealthMatters #volunteerimpact\n\nInfantilization! Why Relationships Won't Last in India A. Non-Accountable Population a. Travel: You buy a train, bus, or air ticket. You manage to board in time. Thereafter it is the headache of the driver to take you to your destination safely. You have no accountability. Tours?Travel agency's accountability. b. Housing From lifts to electricity to water, to safety, housing society is accountable. c. Acting Education It is the system that decides what are the books that children must mug up. None of the 140 crore Indians can and have used Ohm's law in their daily lives. Read script(notes) and vomit in the show(exam). d. Entertainment When you come back home, Netflix and TV are accountable for giving you a \"good feeling.\" They are to take care of your relaxation. e. Health Even sneezing and the so-called doctors have to take accountability for not sneezing. f. Essentials Electricity, food production, water, and sewage, all are governed by the system and you are not accountable. g. Money When money was with women, they had to do some small businesses, rotate money in the market, and be responsible. But now it is with banks, who are just Niravly lending to Vijayi corporates. Sudkhor sambhalenge paise! B. The Perfect Dependency From scalp hair to the toenail, from eating to shitting, from water to energy the population is puppet robots of the system without accountability. C. The Fear of Helplessness i) Can you manage food for your family if there is a strike by farmers for six months? ii) Can you manage to complete your morning rituals if the cleaning community goes on strike? The common people can not even survive, if the system collapses. Veg, water, energy, health, the population can't arrange any of own. D. Sentimentalism The fear of not being in control in any part of life is real. The brain knows it, In order to feel safe from the questions above one has to convince oneself \"Aisa hota hai kya?\" To overcome fear, one has to tell multiple stories to oneself and look for validation of the stories. This creates a fake world in the head, called a \"Belief system.\" Feelings one gets are sentiments(not emotions ok?) E. Infantilism Only children of 2 years [believe] that they are the center of the world with perfect dependency on everything on parents. This childish sentiment of being perfectly dependent and yet feeling privileged is called Infantilism, the body grows, brain doesn't. F. Desire for Love When the population is infantilized, each then is just a struck kid within. What does a kid seek? üôÑ unconditional love, what else? Irrespective of age, people then desire, expect, and seek love from others(children, parents, partners) but no accountability. G. Conclusion The brain doesn't work in two ways. So everyone has a list of wants but doesn't know what to give. Champa Mom's Prince Chumps and Pop's Strong Independent Princess Chamelis act like adults, expecting others to discover their inner kid and love it!\n\nIdea of Social Problem: Social problem in South Asia is a very collective and solution able. Some people in South Asia are thoroughly concerned about the problem and they are not interested in the believing that it is not solution able and it is impossible unless people changed their habits, attitudes, and values of their faith in outlook the remain in concerned about finding alternative possibilities of treatment. Characteristics: We can find some characteristics of social problem in South Asian Countries. Such as: 1. All problems have situations, which have injurious consequences for society. 2. All social problems are deviations from the ‚ÄúI‚Äù lead situation. 3. All social problems have some common basis of origin. 4. All social problems are caused by pathological social conditions. 5. All social problems are inter connected. 6. All social problems are social in their results that is they affect all sections of society. 7. The responsibility for social problems are social that they require a collective approach for their solution. 8. All social problems occur in all societies. Reactions: Sometimes the social people own their individual problems, like ‚Äì family tentions, job pressures or individual people keep their engagement or the persons do not find times to be interested in what affects others, etc. It lies an attitude of unconcern. Sometimes we see the person only has his/her interests, which involved his/her agitated and start taking interest in the problem. Sometimes we see fatalism in the society. Here attributes of everything to identify the issues create problems. The issues like poverty and unemployment, are explained in terms of manifest returns and past ‚Äúkarma‚Äù. The affected people suffer for their misfortune quality and wait for some miracle to happen. Sometimes we see the vested interest of people. Some people take no interest in the existing problems because they stand to gain so long as the problem exists. Motivated by the self-interest, they describe the problem as insoluable and talk about its eradication as a waste of time. Sometimes we see the problem is the problem. There is not solution due to absence of expert knowledge. People change their attitudes and values. The changes indicated by the change in outlook the remain unconcerned about the finding alternative possibilities of treatment. In the south Asian countries the dowry, child marriage, female genital mutilation, different kinds of violation of rights and so on social problem exists as the problem of our society.\n\nGoing through Chapter 2 Understanding and relaring to the power of the middle of the diamond India The biases are so well articulated, and resonate to my present journey of social development in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, and I have tried to understand them and reflect as I could relate to Bias 1 - the elite (top of the diamond) consider those in the middle as poor, ignore their self worth and ability to raise themselves. What they need is perhaps an opportunity, not doles and grants which makes them dependent. Bias 2 - middle of diamond India lacks in aspirations. In my personal experience the expectation of quality and efficiency of the middle is not different from any other region, this bias which is akin to stereotyping the tier 2 or 3 regions where the middle of diamond India resides which has been challenged time and again. Perhaps we underplay the aspirations with equality. Having seen the quality of Jagriti Enterprise Centre - Purvanchal has been an example that may well set a benchmark to counter the bias and not allow the aspirations of middle of diamond India to be lessened from any other Bias 3 - talks about social trauma for regions who took the initiative and were suppressed purposefully to perhaps kill the spirit or aspirations. Recognising the innate spirit and not being biased of a region being behind another part of the country without understanding the reasons behind the same is what is again well represented. Reading the chapters one by one, at a slow pace, being able to relate to instances and experiences I have seen or gone through, digesting the content and trying to reflect is quite interesting. In case one may wish to dive into what it may take to implement sustainable development, the book perhaps will be very useful, and a book that I would recommend to consider. Once again I thank Shashank Mani for authoring and sharing his experiences so lucidly with examples which help to relate to the theory behind. PS - and what better place to read and write than being on another train yatra, recalling Jagriti Yatra times of reflection\n\nRich-poor Divide in India worse than British Era. This is how the anti-national forces play with your mind! First let's see what the report says and then will try to decode it and see how they have twisted the facts against India. I won't consider this as an attack against Modi Government but this is an deliberate attempt to discredit India and Indians. So, this report by the World Inequality Lab says that the top 1% of rich Indians have around 22.6% of India's wealth. And further says that during British Time the top 1% had around 21% of India's wealth. Thereby suggesting that today's governance model is even worse than the British. The report simply is trying to say Modi Government is worse than British Raj. So first of all thank you to World Inequality Lab for accepting that British Raj was the worst part of Indian history. It is like in an attempt to malign the image of India, this Western organisation ended up accepting the fact which the Western World has long denied. Yes! Colonizers destroyed India. Secondly, the report says income distribution is not equitable. Let's understand this by example. Suppose Pooja is a senior employee of a company and Robert, Muskan and Raj are junior employees. Pooja earns 2 lakh Rs/ month, Robert earns 30k/month, Muskan earns 40k/ month and Raj earns 30k/month. The total wealth generated over one month by these employees is Rs 3 lakh (2lakh + 40k +30k +30K). Pooja has around 66% of the total wealth with us whereas the rest three have 33% with them. Difference between Pooja and others is 3 lakh - 2 lakh = 100k. This year increment happens and all the employees receive 20% increment. So, the salary will be as follows - 1. Pooja = 2 lakh +20% of 2 lakh = 2 lakh 40 thousand. 2. Robert = 30k + 20% of 30k = 36k 3. Muskan = 40k + 20% of 40k = 48k 4. Raj = 30k + 20% of 30k = 36k Now the total wealth is (240k + 36k +48k + 36K) = 360k Difference between Pooja and others is 360 - 240 = 120k. Last time the difference was 1 lakh, but this year its 120k. Does this mean that injustice is done with Robert, Muskan and Raj? They all have got a 20% hike. With normal company functioning the difference in earning does not necessarily mean there is injustice. As per multidimensional Poverty Index around 24.82 crore people have come out of poverty since 2014. Secondly, PM Awas Yojana (78 lakh houses completed out of 1 crore 18 lakh sanctioned. PM Ujjwala Yojana, Mudra Loans, PM Svanidhi scheme all have been for the benefits of the downtrodden. While doing all this it is not that the Central Government is doing unminded socialism. This period, dubbed India's \"golden age of billionaires\". Today India has 271 Billionaires (94 added in 2023). We acknowledge there's much to do, requiring time. Many in need will be helped, but it hinges on faith in leadership and a higher power. But the report does not provide a full picture and simply aims to malign the image of our incredible land - India.\n\nBreaking the Bias: Why Indian Families Must Support Daughters in Business Ventures In India, the societal fabric often supports sons to venture into businesses while daughters face hurdles, reflecting deep-rooted gender biases. This disparity stems from traditional mindsets, where sons are seen as the bearers of family legacy, responsible for economic stability. Daughters, however, are frequently nudged towards domestic roles or conventional careers, despite their capabilities and aspirations. Historically, Indian families have viewed male offspring as long-term providers. This belief translates into substantial financial and emotional support for sons in their entrepreneurial endeavors. Sons are groomed from a young age to take over family businesses or start new ventures, receiving mentorship and resources. Conversely, daughters often face skepticism and discouragement, deemed more suitable for roles within the home or secure, less risky professions. This bias is not merely an individual family issue but a societal one. The undercurrent of patriarchy dictates women‚Äôs roles, limiting their opportunities in the business world. Education for daughters is prioritized, but often with the expectation that it will enhance their marriage prospects rather than empower them for entrepreneurship. The fear of societal judgment, concerns over safety, and the pressure to adhere to traditional gender roles further dissuade families from supporting their daughters in business ventures. The consequences of this bias are far-reaching. Talented, ambitious women are denied the chance to innovate, lead, and contribute to the economy. This not only stifles individual potential but also hampers societal progress. Encouraging daughters to pursue business requires a shift in mindset, valuing their aspirations equally and providing them with the same support and opportunities as sons. Only then can we foster a more inclusive, progressive society where every individual‚Äôs potential is recognized and nurtured."
