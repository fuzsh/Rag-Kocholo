        "text": "Remembering Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, one of the icons of the Bengali renaissance. His actual surname was Bandopadhyaya, but he used his title Vidyasagar when he became a law Graduate. True to his name, he was truly an Ocean of Knowledge.\n\nThere were so many facets to Vidyasagar , author, thinker, activist, social reformer. And above all a true humanist..\n\nFrom school I remember 2 stories about him.\n\nWhen he was travelling to a village, to give a lecture. In the same train another young man, was also travelling, to listen to his lecture, but unaware that Vidyasagar was also in the same train. When the train reached the station, the young man looked for a coolie. Vidyasagar asked him \"Why do you need a coolie to carry such a small suitcase, can’t you carry it yourself and save the money?\". The youngster haughtily replied it was beneath his dignity to do so. He then carried the young officer’s suitcase, and did not accept any money too. The young officer left for the venue of the lecture, and there he was stunned by what he saw. The \"porter\" was none other than the great Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar himself, he felt ashamed. The young officer felt remorseful and fell on his asking for an apology, ashamed of himself. Vidyasagar told him smilingly “Son, there is no harm in doing one’s own job, I only wanted to show you that”.\n\nOn another occassion, Vidyasagar was invited to a dinner, he went in dhoti and kurta. He was not allowed in, as he was in Indian clothes. He changed to a suit and tie. However during the dinner, he kept urging his tie and suit to eat, the hosts were astonished. When the hosts asked him, why he did so, Vidyasagar replied, \"When I came in Indian dress, I was turned away. However when I came in a suit and tie, I was immediately invited, I felt it was my dress being invited, not me\". The hosts felt embarassed and apologized."
