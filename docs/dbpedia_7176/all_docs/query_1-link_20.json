        "text": "Ishwar Chandra Bandopadhyay, better known as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, was born in a small village near Midnapore, Bengal; in 1820. He was one of the most prominent faces of the Bengal Renaissance which was a cultural, artistic, social and intellectual movement. It spanned from the early 18th century to 20th century. It revolutionised education, which was erstwhile, a monopoly of the elite. The Bengal Renaissance also marked a series of reforms across the society and numerous social evils were eliminated. Other eminent people in this phase include Rabindranath Tagore and Raja Ram Mohan Roy.\n\nHe was given the title of ‘Vidyasagar’(ocean of knowledge) because he was well-versed in numerous subjects- English, Sanskrit, Bengali, Law, Philosophy and History. He translated ancient texts such as Ramayana and Mahabharata into comprehensible Bengali, to diversify literary taste. He joined Fort William College as a teacher. He would join Sanskrit College later. He was strongly against the archaic system of education which was hopelessly elitist. Consequently, he was met with opposition from the administration in the Sanskrit College. Soon enough, he would bring radical changes in the institution.\n\nContributions of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar\n\n1. Champion of Women's Education:\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar recognized the pivotal role education plays in societal progress. He ardently advocated for women's education at a time when it was largely neglected. He rallied behind John Elliot Bethune in establishing the first all-girls school- Bethune School, 1849. He believed that educating women was the most effective way in making them aware of their rights. It would also enable them to object to the social oppression they were subjected to. He opened 35 women’s colleges across Bengal.\n\n2. Revolutionizing the Education System:\n\nVidyasagar was instrumental in overhauling the traditional Sanskrit education system prevalent in India. He championed the cause of vernacular languages and worked towards making education accessible to the masses. His efforts led to the establishment of schools that used Bengali as the medium of instruction, ensuring that education reached beyond the elite and permeated all sections of society. He allowed lower-caste students to enrol, and changed the mode of education from Sanskrit to English and Bengali. He published two works- ‘Samaskrita Byakaraner Upokromonika’ and ‘Byakaron Koumudi.’ Complex Sanskrit grammar was explained into legible, vernacular Bengali. He also started a Sanskrit publication. Books in Sanskrit were sold at cheap prices.\n\n3. Advocacy for Widow Remarriage:\n\nVidyasagar wrote a number of articles on the evils of early marriage. Vidyasagar wrote a pamphlet on widow remarriage. He introduced new arguments in favour of the same, and proved that Vedic scriptures sanctioned widow remarriage. The pamphlet sparked controversy, only to further strengthen his resolve. He played an incredibly important role in legislating the Hindu Widow Remarriage Act, 1856. The initiative of the same had been taken by J. P. Grant, a British member of the Legislative Council. He also wrote in prestigious, progressive publications like the Tattvabodhini Patrika about widows and their rights. He was consistently committed to his values, and even married his own son to a widow. He also launched several petitions against polygamy.\n\n4. Literary Contributions:\n\nApart from his social reforms, Vidyasagar was a prolific writer and scholar. The first book he wrote was Borno Porichoy (introduction to the letter) in 1855. Even in the 21st century, considered to be the most influential primer of Bengal. He converted the Bengali alphabet into an easily printable form which led to the simplification of reading and writing, and made education more accessible. Children in preschool are taught using Borno Porichoy till date. Through his writings, Vidyasagar aimed to simplify education, making it accessible to the common man and contributing to the cultural and intellectual enrichment of society.\n\n5. Advocacy for Social Equality:\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar vehemently opposed the caste system and untouchability, striving for a more egalitarian society. His endeavors to eradicate social discrimination and promote unity among different sections of society reflected his commitment to building a harmonious and inclusive nation.\n\n6. Philanthropy and Social Service:\n\nVidyasagar's life exemplified the principles of philanthropy and selfless service. He established numerous charitable institutions, including schools and hospitals, to serve the needs of the underprivileged. His philanthropic endeavors went beyond theoretical advocacy, translating into tangible improvements in the lives of countless individuals. In fact, he was often called Daya Sagar for his philanthropic nature. Countless colleges and teacher’s training institutes in India are named after him. He is a gem who will always be remembered. His efforts were also lauded by Rabindranath Tagore-\n\n\"One wonders how God, in the process of producing forty million Bengalis, produced a man!\"\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar's legacy is etched into the fabric of Indian society as a beacon of enlightenment and societal transformation. His tireless efforts in the realms of education, women's rights, and social equality have left an enduring impact, shaping the trajectory of India's social evolution. Vidyasagar's life serves as an inspiration for future generations, reminding us of the transformative power of vision, courage, and unwavering commitment to societal progress.\n\nAUTHOR"
