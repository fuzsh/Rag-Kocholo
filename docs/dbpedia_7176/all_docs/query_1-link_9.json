        "text": "By Bhaskar Sur\n\n\"If someone says the Manusamhita was written by all wise Manu and the principal scripture of the land and if he asks me to throw it away, I'll say it is nothing short of atrocious audacity.\" -- Iswarchandra Vidyasagar\n\nIswarchandra Vidyasagar's 200th birthday is being observed by Hindu progressives in Bengal in the usual spirit of uncritical idol worship. Vidyasagar does not belong to the Bengali pantheon but lately there is an attempt to induct him with much fanfare. Vidyasagar (1820-91) was, by any account, an extraordinary man -- a classical scholar in the humanist tradition, a reformer, an educationist, an author and, above all a personality larger than life.\n\nIn many respects he reminds one of Dr Samuel Johnson with a streak of Quaker reformer. He was born in a Brahmin family of the highest rank (kulin) which would tell us a lot about the course of his life ,the opportunities he availed of and the the reforms he initiated.\n\nHe could never, despite all his protestations, rise above his caste. Another thing mattered -- the fact of Calcutta being the capital of the British Indian Empire. This brave new world had much to offer -- new institutions, knowledge jobs and some space for activism.\n\nContrary to the legend, he was not born poor. His father Thakurdas was earning a 'princely' Rs 10 a month. Takurdas got the job with the help of Bhagabatcharan Sinha, a Sudra who had earlier provided him free food and shelter.Young Iswarchandra also enjoyed this favour, not as a human being but as a Brahmin.\n\nWealthy Shudras considered such acts would win them merits for the afterlife. Iswar was admitted to the Sanskrit College founded in 1824 for the preservation of the oriental learning much to the annoyance of Rammohun Roy. This college was exclusively meant for two highest castes -- Brahmin and Vaidya -- and reluctant students were bribed with scholarships.\n\nIt was a white elephant which ate up a sizeable portion of the East India Company's meagre educational allocations. The college's curriculum included English, some science and even a anatomy, besides Sanskrit literature, grammar, Hindu philosophy and law.\n\nIswar was a bright student who developed here a passion for scholarship. He passed the final examination in 1841 and his academic attainments won him the title 'Vidyasagar ' to the Sea of Learning in the true oriental manner. The capital of the Indian Empire offered many opportunities to such ambitious young men.\n\nHe became a teacher of Bengali at Fort William College founded to teach British civilians Indian languages and traditional jurisprudence that they might carry out their administrative responsibilities better. For the next years we see him writing textbooks and editing Sanskrit texts along the lines of western scholarship. His primarily Varnaparichaya bore the imprint of new scholarship.\n\nHe left out many obsolete letters and rationalized orthography. His closeness to British officials of the Department of Public Instruction ensured that they became the set text books for all government schools. Vidyasagar seized upon this opportunity to set up his own printing house and get the texts printed there ,making even a greater profit .Nobody, I suppose, will smell any nepotism in this nexus.\n\nVidyasagar was one of the makers of the Bengali prose. His syntax was that of English and the vocabulary was preponderingly Sanskrit. It was a sinuous prose capable of nuances but distant from the Bengali of everyday use .In other words, it was a hieratic prose bearing close resemblance with that of Dr Johnson, better known as Johnsonese.\n\nActually, Vidyasagar was consciously or unconsciously following a Brahminical agenda of ridding Bengali of all the words and expression of Persian and Arabic origin which enjoyed the blessings of Fort William College authorities. This was also a part of a wider theoretical construct involving interpretation of the Indian history that Company historians like James Mill advanced.\n\nAccording to Mill, the British rule was the beginning of a new age of prosperity, peace and progress after centuries of Muslim despotism, exploitation and slavery. Vidyasagar presented this interpretation in a summaried and lucid form in his “Banglar Itihas” (1848) which chiefly drew upon Mill's work.Vidyasagar therefore was working as an interpreter of the imperialist ideology, othering the Muslim.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that in his textbooks there is hardly any Muslim name, not to speak of any glimpse of Muslim life, even though Muslims constituted the majority of the Bengali speaking people. In this he contrasts sharply with Rammohun Roy who was an Islamic scholar and a warm admirer of Muslim culture.\n\nAs a educationist Vidyasagar worked in twin capacities -- as a textbook writer which fetched him money and as an inspector founding schools, so often going beyond his official responsibilities. Contrary to the popular belief he was not very enthusiastic about taking education to the Shudra masses which British policy makers like Wood insisted.\n\nIn a letter written in September 1859 Vidyasagar expressed his deep resentment and fears that it would bring down the quality of education. He still clung to Lord Macaulay's ' filtration theory ' which the British authorities had found unworkable and rejected. The poet Nabin Chandra Sen in his autobiography writes about Vidyasagar's regret for having founded schools which were encouraging the boys of peasants and artisans to leave their traditional calling.\n\nBrahminism wants Shudras to stay at their respective traditional professions to maintain the social harmony .That was also the tenor of Tilak and Gandhi and, curiously enough, some environmentalists of our day. As an inspector he founded a number of schools to carry out the government policy. By contrast a reformist movement among Chandals, led by Harichand Thakur, founded no less than 3,800 educational institutions on their own without much government support and against much upper caste opposition.\n\nContrary to popular belief Vidyasagar was not very enthusiastic about taking education to Shudras which British policy makers insisted\n\nVidyasagar wanted to take education mainly to upper caste Hindus who were still left out. However, it must be admitted that he was a proponent of secular, liberal education when the space was being contested between missionaries and Hindu revivalists.\n\nVidyasagar's fame as a social reformer rests on the movement leading to the enactment of Widow Remarriage Bill in 1856 in the last days of the Company rule. The widows of Hindu upper castes had a miserable existence .Not only could the child widows remarry but they were subjected to a painful austere life with severe dietary and sartorial restrictions.\n\nThey were also vulnerable to sexual exploitation often by the members of the family .To avoid scandals they were sometimes murdered and worse still ,sold to the brothels. A survey conducted in 1851 showed that out of nearly 20000 prostitutes in Calcutta ,almost half came from the three upper castes, particularly Brahmins .This must have shocked many Brahmin intellectuals including Vidyasagar. In prostitution, laws of market work, not that of caste. A Brahmin woman's body can be hired by a Muslim or a Dalit if he can pay for it.\n\nAt the bottom of Vidyasagar's moral indignation there was an exaggerated caste feeling. He worked tirelessly writing tracts with pungent irony and quoting from forgotten scriptures such as Parasara Samhita. This, naturally, led to much acrimony and hostility. One ballad writer of the time (kabial) even accused Vidyasagar of having f**ed the great Parasara, the ancient law giver, to suit his end.\n\nThere was another problem: The scripture enjoined that only virgins could be remarried and strange as it may sound, Vidyasagar was fighting for the remarriage of virgins. One of his opponents remarked with mischievous wit” \"We find the Honourable Company would have to appoint an Inspector of the Vagina to decide the matter.\"\n\nThe law could be enacted not because of Vidyasagar's forceful tracts as his opponents led by Radhakanta Deb enjoyed far larger support, but because of Whig liberalism and enlightened paternalism of the Company that ultimately led to the what Britishers call Great Mutiny. Any law without social consent is useless as was this one.\n\nIn his whole lifetime Vidyasagar could arrange only three such marriages but not before bribing the bridegroom with hefty amount from his own pocket. This huge failure embittered him and he became a Bengali hater, retreating like a wounded animal to the remote Karmatar, inhabited mostly by tribals.One disturbing incident was that when Dayamoyi, a Chandal woman, remarried and fought spiritedly and successfully a prolonged legal battle for share in the property of first husband in 1876 in his own district, Vidyasagar remained indifferent. After all, she was a lowly born Chandal, not worth bothering about!\n\nVidyasagar's ignominious moral defeat came during the debate preceding Age of Consent Bill was passed overcoming all the vehement conservative outcry on March 19,1891 raising the age of consumption to 14. Phulmani Das, a married girl of 11, died when her 35 years old husband brutally forced himself on her. Such incidents were common in those days though the husband, enjoying the protection of the sastras, always got away with the heinous crime.\n\nHindu reformers, Brahmos, Liberals in the major cities demanded legislation to stop such abuse. Side by side ,it was a focal point for the mobilization of Hindu conservatives and fundamentalists. Tilak in his his influential journals “Keshri” and “Mahratta” stood strongly against any legislation raising the age of marriage.To put it differently, he supported marital rape and murder.\n\nWhat was the position of Vidyasagar whose heart was going out for the victims of Hindu patriarchy? This time, grown wise with years, he could not give his consent to the bill on the plausible ground that girls reach puberty at different ages in different regions. The same crooked Nayaik logic he masted in his student day with so much diligence! So how could this Brahmin be the icon of the whole Bengali speaking people?\n\nHe had no concern for the poor and mostly illiterate Bengali Mulims ,nor the Shudras who were 96%of the Hindu population, not even the ordinary Hindu women suffering from marital rape. Neverthess he was a wonderful human being very kind,generous,warm with an astonishingly wide intellectual range.\n\nDr Johnson, whom he resembled on so many counts, was extremely humane to his black servant but not against slavery .So was Vidyasagar: He never uttered a single word against caste slavery which was more widespread and vicious than Trans-Atlantic slavery. He was after all a Brahmin Pandit with his heart apparently in the right place but his head stil in the thrall of old Brahminical habits.\n\n---\n\nSource: Bhaskar Sur's Facebook timeline\n\nLabels\n\nBy Our Representative New York City (NYC) mayor Eric Adams has condemned the decision of the Indian Consulate of New York and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America (VHPA) , a U.S. offshoot of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), for planning what several diaspora human rights groups call an anti-Muslim float planned for this year’s upcoming NYC India day parade on August 18.\n\nBy Rajiv Shah* The other day, I was searching on Google a quote on Maha Shivratri which I wanted to send to someone, a confirmed Shiv Bhakt, quite close to me -- with an underlying message to act positively instead of being negative. On top of the search, I chanced upon an article in, imagine!, a Nashik Corporation site which offered me something very unusual.\n\nBy Harsh Thakor* Bernard De Mello, the former assistant editor of the \"Economic and Political Weekly\", stands as a prominent defender of Marxism and revolutionary democracy. Few progressive writers articulate their views with such balance, managing to convey depth without resorting to empty rhetoric. With a fusion of passion and intellectual clarity, Bernard has skillfully revived the essence of the Naxalbari movement and Maoism, exposing the myths propagated by pro-corporate and imperialist forces.\n\nCounterview Desk In a strongly worded statement, the Ambedkar University Delhi Faculty Association (AUDFA), even as insisting on the need to protect the top public institution, has said that the university \"is now on the brink of collapse and fragmentation\", accusing the administration for operating \"with increasing impunity, subjecting faculty to harassment amid deteriorating working conditions.\"\n\nBy Deepika* Dog bites and Rabies Vaccines are in the news these days. Every other day there is a news report mentioning the death of a child following a dog bite despite the child being vaccinated against Rabies. The news reports erroneously and intentionally mention that the child died due to “Rabies” and do not question the role of the vaccines.\n\nBy Shamsul Islam* First time in the history of independent India, the in-charge minister of the Cultural Ministry in the current Modi government, Prahlad Singh Patel, has glorified MS Golwalkar, second supremo of the RSS and the most prominent ideologue of the RSS till date, on his birth anniversary, February 19. In a tweet he wrote : “Remembering a great thinker, scholar, and remarkable leader #MSGolwalkar on his birth anniversary. His thoughts will remain a source of inspiration & continue to guide generations.”\n\nBy Bhabani Shankar Nayak The successful 1979 Iranian working-class struggle against the monarchical dictatorship was eventually snatched away from people and hijacked by reactionary religious forces, with the covert support of imperialist and colonial powers led by the CIA.\n\nBy Bhaskar Sur* Swami Vivekananda now belongs more to the modern Hindu mythology than reality. It makes a daunting job to discover the real human being who knew unemployment, humiliation of losing a teaching job for 'incompetence', longed in vain for the bliss of a happy conjugal life only to suffer the consequent frustration.\n\nBy Fr. Cedric Prakash SJ* India cries for Freedom: Thanks to the relentless struggles and sacrifices of our freedom fighters, on 15 August 1947, India made her tryst with destiny! After years of colonial rule, she finally became an independent nation. Ever since (during these past 77 years), India has made rapid strides in every sphere, and this fact must be applauded; however, one must also humbly admit that, India still has an unimaginable long way to go in the internalisation and actualisation of her freedom! Today, India and her people, cry for a freedom from everything that negates the very idea of India. They yearn for a society built on justice, liberty, equality, fraternity, pluralism, harmony, dignity, integrity and unity of all!"
