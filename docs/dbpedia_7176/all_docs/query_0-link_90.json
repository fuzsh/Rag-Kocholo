        "text": "Vidyasagar was a polymath and a key figure of the Bengali renaissance | Wikimedia During the bicentennial year of the birth of Vidyasagar, what does it mean to celebrate the man and honour his legacy? This year India celebrates the 200 th birth anniversary of Ishvarchandra Vidyasagar (1820-1891), the great reformer, educator, printer-publisher and prose stylist. Since his birthday last year on 26 September, there have already been numerous events dedicated to remembering and honouring his life, from his birthplace in Birsingha to the rural retreat he built for himself in Karmatar, and, of course, in Kolkata where his professional career largely unfolded. Politicians, scholars, artists, and a host of ordinary citizens have all found ways to recognise the achievements of a tireless change agent who advocated on behalf of Hindu widows, opened up new pathways in vernacular education, experimented with new models for Bengali publishing, and placed his stamp on the very character and style of modern Bengali culture. But the man we celebrate was also something of an enigma: he was famously elusive on questions of faith, curiously wed to projects of radical change framed in relation to scriptural authority, and simultaneously both a social elite and a man of the people. In the past it has been fashionable to engage in wordplay around the relative balance of tradition and modernity in Vidyasagar. It is time to be done with all that. Let us just say it: he was a thoroughly modern individual, even if also a colonial subject. Instead of focusing on tradition and modernity, I propose we consider recognising two important dimensions of the man, what I call the major and the minor Vidyasagar.\n\nIswar Chandra Vidyasagar as a philanthropist and humanist has evoked interest in various research fields and conversations across generations. When it comes to the pathos of the Indian society during the nineteenth century it is inclusive of the efforts undertaken to deal or fight the same. In this context, a polymath stands as a primary factor and an exemplary figure for the much-needed awakening of young and new generations. Vidyasagar not only as a humanist but also as a human being has been at the forefront of the renaissance we are acquainted with as far as the Bengal chapter in the nineteenth century is concerned. His academic and philosophical endeavours have gathered attention of scholars, officer-administrators, etc. time and again. His adventures and experiences may be evaluated in various ways; in one aspect as a coming of age game changer in the Indian society, and, in the other as a humanist who brought in shades of life in every undertaking he was associated with or displayed immense passion about. This paper is meant to highlight the exceptionality of Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, based on primary and secondary sources, and how his endeavours have left an impression in the minds of potential radicals.\n\nIswarchandra Vidyasagar was one of the leading lights of the nineteenth century Bengal Renaissance. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he was truly secular in his life & works. He involved himself in a number of social and educational reform activities responding to the necessities of the time. Vidyasagar was the crusader for the rights of the women. He successfully led the movement for the rights of the widows to remarry. He also fought against the practices of polygamy and child marriage prevalent during the time. In matters of education, he was the first to introduce modern concepts of knowledge in the courses of the Sanskrit College. He also introduced various measures for giving the system of education in the Sanskrit College a modern look. Vidyasagar felt the necessity of spreading education in vernacular language and, therefore, took upon himself the responsibility of writing Bengali primers. In those primers, he tried to inculcate liberal values among the minds of the young learners. He also penned a number of books in Sanskrit and Bengali for the students of the higher classes. Vidyasagar took active interests in the spread of female education too. On his own initiative, he established forty girlsâ€™ schools in the four districts of Bengal. In the later part of his life, he took the responsibility of the Metropolitan College (presently, Vidyasagar College) and turned this college, managed fully by the Indians only, as the largest college of Bengal. In this article, an attempt has been made to delineate some of the activities of Vidyasagar in the realm of education for which we are still remaining grateful to him."
