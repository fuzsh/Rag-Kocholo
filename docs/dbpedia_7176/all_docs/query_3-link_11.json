        "text": "Educational Reform\n\nIn 1846, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar assumed the role of ‘Assistant Secretary’ at the Sanskrit College.\n\nDuring his time as the Principal of the Sanskrit College from 1851 to 1858, Vidyasagar introduced significant reforms in both administrative and educational aspects.\n\nIn an era when the concept of universal education was virtually non-existent, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar strongly advocated that education should be accessible to all, regardless of caste or gender.\n\nHe opened the doors of the Sanskrit College to individuals from lower castes.\n\nAdditionally, he supported scholars to study ancient sacred texts and reinterpret them for contemporary relevance.\n\nFurthermore, Vidyasagar established 20 model schools across regions like Hooghly, Midnapore, Burdwan, and Nadia.\n\nHe oversaw these schools, recruited teachers, and devised their curricula.\n\nHe transformed the examination system by replacing annual exams with monthly ones.\n\nHe introduced the study of English, Western Sciences, and Mathematics and introduced admission fees and tuition fees.\n\nVidyasagar also implemented a ‘Sunday’ weekly holiday and designated May and June as the summer vacation months.\n\nVidyasagar brought about a revolution in the Bengali education system by reforming the way the Bengali language was both written and taught.\n\nSocial Reform\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar was a polymath reformer of the nineteenth century whose remarkable contributions played an important role in transforming the status of women in India.\n\nUpon studying ancient texts, he became convinced that the lowly position of Hindu women in his era was not justified by scriptures but rather stemmed from prevailing power dynamics in society.\n\nThrough his relentless efforts, the government of India passed the Widow Remarriage Act in 1856. In order to garner public support for this provision, he even encouraged his own son, Narayan Chandra Bandyopadhyaya, to marry a widow.\n\nUnlike other reformers who aimed to establish alternative societies or systems, Vidyasagar sought to effect change from within society itself.\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar courageous initiatives were instrumental in introducing widow remarriage into the conservative Hindu Brahmin society of Bengal.\n\nHe advocated for women’s education and passionately opposed the cruel practice of child marriage.\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar founded 35 girls’ schools throughout Bengal, including the Metropolitan School of Calcutta, with the primary goal of making women self-sufficient and empowered.\n\nVidyasagar also waged a determined campaign against the prevailing social custom of Kulin Brahmin polygamy.\n\nThis practice allowed some men to have as many as eighty wives, leading to situations where elderly individuals married teenage girls or even children.\n\nThe unfortunate widows resulting from these marriages were sentenced to lives of suffering.\n\nThey faced severe restrictions, doncning plain white cotton sarees and shaving their heads. Some widows were even cast out of their homes, ending up as prostitutes, victims of rape, or unsupported mothers.\n\nVidyasagar stood resolute against the entrenched conservative powers in Hindu society, displaying a progressive outlook that was far ahead of his times.\n\nHis efforts to push women, promote their self-sufficiency, prosperity, and empowerment, alongside his tireless work for women’s education, stand as a unique and enduring legacy."
