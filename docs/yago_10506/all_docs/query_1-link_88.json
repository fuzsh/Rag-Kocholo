        "text": "Who is Ola Rapace?\n\nOla Rapace is a Swedish actor. He is most famously known for his amazing portrayal of Lasse in 2000 movie together, as well as starring in Rancid (2004) as Bob.\n\nBirthday\n\nDecember 3, 1971\n\nBirth Place\n\nSweden\n\nZodiac Sign\n\nSagittarius\n\nEarly life and rise to fame:\n\nOla Rapace was born in Tyresö, Stockholm County, in Sweden. His full name is Pär Ola Norell. Both of his parents are academics. Ola was raised by his father, as his mother was mostly traveling and had very little time to look after Ola. He grew up in Stockholm, a middle-classed region of Vallentuna. When Ola was only a year old, his parents sadly separated, and they decided that Ola should stay with his father. While growing up, he was playing football, as well as enjoyed listening to heavy metal music, among other hobbies.\n\nHow did he begin acting?\n\nOla Rapace decided to study philosophy, so he went to the esteemed University of Montpellier, which is located in France. After studying there for two years, Ola discovered a local acting class that he decided to take on. After a few short months there, he became increasingly interested in pursuing acting on a more serious level, ultimately deciding that he wanted to become an actor when growing up.\n\nHis career beginnings:\n\nOla’s first role was in Lukas Moodysson’s film “Together,” it’s a Swedish comedy-drama film that was released in cinemas on August 25, 2000. It was a bittersweet comedy about a couple of hippie-socialists set in the homeshare commune in Stockholm. The film was a commercial and critical success and even won several awards at various international film festivals, including the Philadelphia Film Festival’s Jury Award, as well as Paris Film Festival’s award.\n\nAfter that, Ola received an offer to star in the popular TV series Tusenbröder, which followed a group of handymen who wanted to become involved in organized crime. After this role, Ola also played Stefan Lindman in the Swedish television series Wallander, based on a book series “Kurt Wallander” by Henning Mankell.\n\nOla Rapace’s acting career has mostly seen police and crime-related TV roles, including playing Daniel Nordström in the Danish police TV show Anna Pihl.\n\nAlthough Ola has mostly starred in cop-related TV shows, he doesn’t like the genre himself and thinks the whole premise is usually pretty cheesy.\n\nPrivate life and relationships:\n\nOla Rapace was married to movie actress Noomi Rapace (best known for her roles in Prometheus, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest, and The Girl Who Played with Fire), they were married in 2001 and even starred together in the 2010 film Beyond. But after a little more than ten years in marriage, they decided to part ways and got divorced in 2011. The couple has had two children. Their daughters’ names are Lin and Lev Rapace."
