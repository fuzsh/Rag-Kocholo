        "text": "Hollywood’s rolled out the red carpet for Noomi Rapace, who stars in next Friday’s “Prometheus” by “Alien” director Ridley Scott. Rapace follows in “Alien” actress Sigourney Weaver’s footsteps as archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw, who with her scientist boyfriend (Logan Marshall-Green) receives a summons from another planet. They travel on the spaceship Prometheus to a distant world where some very, very bad things happen — of the malevolent creature variety.\n\nThe Swedish actress came to international fame as Lisbeth Salander in the 2009 Swedish language versions of Steig Larsson’s Millennium trilogy that began with “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.”\n\nThen she hit the big-budget American movie scene.\n\nFirst, Rapace, 32, co-starred with Robert Downey Jr. as a wily gypsy in the “Sherlock Holmes” sequel, her first English movie.\n\n“And I didn’t speak English like three years ago,” she noted, in flawless English.\n\nFrom “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” she went “amazingly enough, straight into Ridley’s ‘Prometheus.’\n\n“I was in that movie for six months. So it was a really intense year.”\n\nRapace (pronounced rah-pahs) is the name Noomi Noren and her now ex-husband, actor Ola Norell, gave themselves when they married 11 years ago. It means “bird of prey” in French.\n\nDivorced, they share custody of their son Lev, 8. Ola Rapace is a Bond villain in this fall’s “Skyfall.”\n\nA fan of action movies as a child, Noomi took judo classes at 11 and left home for drama school in Stockholm at 15.\n\nTo play Lisbeth Salander she learned Thai kick boxing. For “Sherlock,” it was gypsy dancing. For “Prometheus” she worked with a London trainer to gain an explosive, catlike energy.\n\n“I like doing fight scenes. Those more physical scenes, I try to do as much as they allow me to do of the stunt stuff.\n\n“You just have to kind of crack on and do it. Of course, you’re bruised and your body is aching and you hurt yourself a lot sometimes. But that’s part of it.\n\n“I always find it quite amusing,” she added, “the emotional situations that are more tricky. Because I don’t like to pretend, I try to use things in me and translate them into the situation and the character. It always needs to run through my own veins in a way.”"
