        "text": "A host of stars were desperate to play bisexual computer hacker Lisbeth Salander alongside Daniel Craig in David Fincher's Hollywood remake of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.\n\nNoomi Rapace - who portrayed the part to great acclaim in the Swedish film versions of Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium books - wasn't interested in the project.\n\nAnd, after much speculation about big names such as Scarlett Johansson, it is the little-known Rooney Mara who has won the hottest role around in the Tinseltown version, due next year.\n\nHere we compare the two actresses, Rooney and Noomi, the latter of whom can be seen from today in The Girl Who Played With Fire - the second part of the trilogy.\n\nNOOMI RAPACE\n\nAGE 30\n\nBorn Hudiksvall, Sweden\n\nPICKLED HERRING OR NEW YORK DELI?\n\nHer mother was Swedish actress Nina Noren, her dad Spanish flamenco singer Rogelio Duran. Noomi rarely saw her father before he died in 2007. Her mum remarried and moved from Sweden to Iceland.\n\nHACKER OR SLACKER?\n\nNoomi won her first film role at the age of seven in an Icelandic film. The non-speaking role sparked her love of acting and when the family returned to Stockholm she quit school at 15 to study theatre. In 1996, she made her TV debut playing the part of Lucinda Gonzales in the TV series Tre Kronor. She is married to Swedish actor Ola Rapace and they have a son, Lev.\n\nFAKE ACCENT OR NATIVE SPEAKER?\n\nLong before Stieg Larsson's books became a global sensation, Swedish director Niels Arden Ople bought the film rights. In September 2007, he interviewed young Noomi.\n\n\"At first, he said no,\" she recalls. \"It may even have been that he thought I was too good looking. I said, 'If you trust me, I'll do anything you want me to do to become her'. And he finally agreed.\"\n\nNoomi went on a strict diet to get Salander's ultra-skinny look. \"I wanted to get rid of my female softness,\" she says. \"I wanted to be more like a boy in my body.\n\nLisbeth's athletic, but she can fight.\"\n\nDespite the lure of Hollywood, Noomi had no interest in getting involved in the big-money remake.\n\n\"I've been very clear on that point from the beginning,\" she says. \"It doesn't matter who is going to play Mikael Blomkvist, I'm finished.\n\n\"I think Fincher is one of the few directors in the world that can do something really good with this. I love Fight Club and I think Se7en is an amazing film, but I'm done with Lisbeth.\n\n\"I don't have this dream about Hollywood. I know many actors will do anything to get there. But for me it's more important to work with people and do projects that I deeply believe in and feel like I really have to do.\"\n\nROONEY MARA\n\nAGE 25\n\nBorn Bedford, New York\n\nPICKLED HERRING OR NEW YORK DELI?\n\nShe may be relatively unknown as an actress but her family are almost American sporting royalty.\n\nTwo of her great grandfathers founded the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants American football teams.\n\nOne grandfather, Wellington Mara, co-owned the Giants, passing the club onto her Uncle John. The other grandfather, Tim Rooney, ran the Yonkers Raceway in New York. Rooney herself went to New York University and studied psychology, international social policy and nonprofits.\n\nHACKER OR SLACKER?\n\nIt wasn't until she finished university five years ago that Rooney decided to follow her sister Kate into acting.\n\nShe appeared in several indies including Youth In Revolt and the boarding-school drama Tanner Hall.\n\nHer slow-burn career culminated in landing the lead in the Nightmare On Elm Street remake and then The Social Network - about the early days of Facebook - directed by the man who will oversee The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, David Fincher.\n\nFAKE ACCENT OR NATIVE SPEAKER?\n\nA raft of young actresses auditioned for the coveted role of Lisbeth Salander including Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman, Ellen Page and Carey Mulligan.\n\nFight Club director Fincher made them all perform a screen test in full make-up while speaking in a Swedish accent.\n\nAnd in order to audition, the finalists had to agree deals with salaries in the $150,000 to $200,000 range, as well as options for the second and third movies with big pay rises built in."
