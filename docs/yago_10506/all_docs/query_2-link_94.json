        "text": "Noomi Rapace as Colin Farrell’s accident-scarred neighbour, looks as sullen as she did in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (I’m guessing that was the idea; the producers even hired Niels Arden Oplev, director of the original Tattoo, the first, and,in my opinion, the best of the Swedish language trilogy based on the books by Stieg Larsson). But without the signature Lisbeth Salander look she is just not as effective.\n\nAs for Irish actor Farrell as a Hungarian born family man breaking bad so he can exact a revenge on an American gangster (Terrence Howard), well, all I can say is … give me a break!\n\nSome worthy character actors (F. Murray Abraham, Dominic Cooper, Armand Assante) and a certifiable international star (France’s Isabelle Huppert) are wasted in this bleak thriller.\n\nMr. Farrell was allegedly The Next Big Thing in the early 90s (remember him in Minority Report? ) . However, in recent years he seems to be spending the majority of his time in smaller features. Some are great (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths); others are merely mediocre (Triage, London Boulevard).\n\nDead Man Down is, regrettably, in the latter category.\n\n(The less said about Alexander , Horrible Bosses and the recent ill-fated reboot of Total Recall the better.)\n\nMaybe I’m old school but when it comes to Sherlock Holmes I prefer to see English actors in the role of the iconic English detective.\n\nNothing against the skills of Robert Downey Jr. In fact, the American actor seems to immerse himself body and soul in whatever role he is playing. He even made me believe in Iron Man. And, of course, his performances in 1992’s Chaplin, 1997’s Two Girls and a Guy and 2008’s Tropic Thunder are the stuff of legend.\n\nIf any American actor could pull it off it should have been the gifted and chameleonic Downey.\n\nAs it is, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous fictional detective comes across as a sort of steam punk James Bond.\n\nThere are far too many (highly physical) fight scenes, gadgets and goofy set-ups (Holmes painted up as a drag queen?) for a reviewer who grew up with sane and sensible Basil Rathbone playing Sherlock Holmes (and Nigel Bruce as a bumbling Dr. Watson). Later, in the 1980s, Jeremy Brett gave Rathbone a run for his money in a series of mysteries filmed for British television and aired on PBS in North America.\n\nEven the current BBC series Sherlock, despite its outrageous premise (Sherlock Holmes alive and texting in modern day London!) is more true to the essential spirit of Conan Doyle’s character thanks to young (and previously unknown) Benedict Cumberbatch’s lightning-in-a-bottle performance and the ingeniousness of series creators Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffatt. (Incidentally, the latter was also one of the prime movers in reinventing Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde as BBC-TV’s 2007 triumph Jekyll! If you enjoy Sherlock you gotta see Jekyll!)\n\nKudos as well to the marvelous Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson. I even prefer Andrew Scott’s “Jim Moriarty” in Sherlock to Jared Harris’ commendable performance as the infamous Professor M in Game of Shadows.\n\nLet’s face it, casting Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes is like casting a well-known British actor as a quintessentially American private eye (uh, Hugh Grant as Mike Hammer?)\n\nBut then , director Guy Ritchie has never let common sense get in the way of an intriguing idea (after all, this is the man who married Madonna.)\n\nAccording to Internet Movie Database it took five writers to cobble together the plot. When it comes to capturing the essence of what makes the Holmes stories so successful they obviously don’t have a clue.\n\nBut, you may be saying, you already knew Downey Jr, was playing a rock’em sock’em version of the famous fictional sleuth in 2009’s Sherlock Holmes.\n\nSo why watch the sequel (even if it was only five bucks at your local video shop.)\n\nOkay, true confessions time. I rented the sequel to see Noomi Rapace.\n\nLike many thinking horndogs I was curious to see how the actress who played Lisbeth Salander in Girl With the Dragon Tattoo would look and sound in her first English language feature.\n\nAnd, just as I suspected, even though film biz execs were knocked out by her performance in the original Swedish language version of the thriller they didn’t know what to do with her. And so she is wasted in a role (as a shady gypsy fortune teller) that anyone could have played.\n\n(Fortunately, director Ridley Scott makes better use of her formidable strengths as a performer in a key role in the new sci-fi thriller “Prometheus”. )\n\nWhy can’t American filmmakers leave perfectly good Scandinavian thrillers alone?\n\nLast year we had director Matt (Cloverfield) Reeves’ well-intentioned remake of Let the Right One In.\n\nY’know, the one about the little girl who turns out to be a vampire (“I’m twelve years old but I’ve been twelve for a very long time”) and saves her new best friend, a young and all too mortal male, from a pack of bullies.\n\nTrue, Reeves transplanted the scenario from Sweden to New Mexico in a presumed bid to make the film more relatable for American audiences.\n\nIt is hard to argue with the casting of Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee in the roles played to eerie perfection by Lina Leandersson and Kare Hedebrandt in the Swedish language original.\n\nBasically, though, Reeves’ remake is a note for note version of director Tomas Alfredson’s far superior 2008 film.\n\nNow, we have an English language version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nTo his credit director David Fincher hasn’t tweaked the title (Let the Right One In was changed to Let Me In for the English language version) and he didn’t transplant the story to an American location (like, say, Minneapolis.)\n\nInstead, the film (like the Stieg Larsson novel on which it is based) remains rooted in Sweden.\n\nCritics have been uncharacteristically kind (“this retread finds new traction and explores the core issues of morality, affluent entitlement, and the petty urge for payback” – Postmedia News film reviewer Katherine Monk).\n\nStill, to quote (famed sports figure) Yogi Berra (in a somewhat different context): “This is deja vu all over again.”\n\nDaniel Craig takes over from Michael Nyquist as disgraced investigative reporter Mikael Blomqvist. Christopher Plummer plays Henrik Vanger, the aging industrialist willing to pay Blomqvist big bucks to investigate the disappearance of his favorite niece, Harriet, 40 years ago.\n\nThe Hollywood hype machine went into overdrive as director David Fincher auditioned some of Hollywood’s hottest young actresses in a widely publicized search to find a new Lisbeth Salander. (In case you have been living in a cave for the past few years, Salander is the goth punk hacker with the distinctive tattoo helping Blomqvist in his search for clues.)\n\nScarlett Johansson, Ellen Page and Natalie Portman were among the names rumored to be interested in the part.\n\nIn the end the role went to relative newcomer Rooney Mara (best known as the girl who dumps Mark Zuckerberg in the opening scenes of The Social Network)\n\nIt wasn’t long before Ms. Mara was gracing magazine covers in Salander mode and photos from the set were being leaked online.\n\nThere were intriguing teaser trailers in theatres and online.\n\nAmerican movie marketers and media types have turned pre-release hype into something of a pop culture art form.\n\nSometimes it works (The Hunger Games). Sometimes it doesn’t (MGM recently announced the studio will apparently lose money on the Tattoo remake.)\n\nI rented the Swedish language version of Tattoo again a few days after watching the English language remake.\n\nMaybe I’m prejudiced in favor of the original but it seems to me Scandinavian director Niels Arden Oplev moves the plot along more quickly while injecting genuine tension into the proceedings.\n\nI also think the original Swedish title of the film “Men Who Hate Women”, is more representative of the film/novel’s content.\n\nAnd, while we’re at it, let me say that I have no problem reading subtitles. In fact, hearing the characters converse in the language in which the book was originally written makes the film feel more authentic.\n\nWith all due respect to Ms. Mara, who earned Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for her work in the remake, her character seems to lack the feral intensity of Noomi Rapace’s Salander in the 2009 film. (Although she was bypassed by both award committees, Ms. Rapace did win a BAFTA Award – the Oscars of the British film biz.)\n\nYou gotta hand it to Ms. Mara though – she does a great cover version.\n\nScreenwriter Steven Zaillian also deserves credit for including characters mentioned in Larsson’s novel but not in the Swedish screenplay (credited to Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg.) For example, in the book, Blomqvist has a daughter, Pernilla (played in the remake by an actress named Josefin Asplund) and, just like in the novel, it is Pernilla in the Zaillian screenplay who unlocks the secrets of Harriet’s diary.\n\nHowever, despite a dream cast, Jeff Chenoweth’s wintry Oscar-nominated cinematography and Fincher’s grim efficiency behind the camera, that is exactly what the English language remake is … a great cover version.\n\nY’know, one of those polished all-star renditions of a pop classic. You hafta admire the thought, dedication and expense that went into the production. But all it really does, in the end, is remind you of all the reasons you liked the original version more.\n\nWhy is ROONEY MARA up for an Oscar as Lisbeth Salander in the American remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo when NOOMI RAPACE was not even nominated?\n\nOkay, I’ll admit it. I haven’t had the opportunity to see director David Fincher’s English language adaptation of the first book in the best-selling trilogy by the late STIEG LARSSON. (The film never played in our little burg).\n\nStill, I have a problem believing Ms. Mara is somehow better than Ms. Rapace, who, after all, originated the role. (Maybe I am prejudiced. I immersed myself in all three books in the Larsson trilogy and have seen all three Swedish language films based on the novels.)\n\nOh well, at least Ms. Rapace was nominated for a BAFTA (the U.K. equivalent of an Academy Award) for her efforts.\n\nIt’s nice that Ms. Rapace has been flooded with offers since her breakthrough role in Tattoo (she can be seen in Guy Ritchie’s latest Sherlock Holmes adventure and Ridley Scott’s upcoming Aliens prequel, to name two) but it would be still be interesting to know why she was passed over for Oscar honors.\n\nI would hate to think it is because Ms. Mara speaks English in the remake and American audiences do not like to read subtitles. (Was Ms. Rapace’s performance somehow less compelling because she delivered it in her native language?)\n\nIf you’re like me and have a cinematic turn of mind you probably visualize the characters of the book you are reading in your mind.\n\nFrankly, I saw MILLA JOVOVICH as Lisbeth Salander when I first read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I mean, she’s the one who said:\n\n“I love to feel powerful. Maybe it’s my Yugoslavian background from, like, always ready for battle, that barbarian thing coming from the abyss of my DNA (snarls).”\n\nAnd, no, this isn’t a line of dialogue. It’s a personal quote from her commentary track on the Resident Evil DVD.\n\nObviously, this is one action movie heroine who walks it like she talks it.\n\nUnfortunately, Milla doesn’t speak Swedish. And, besides, NOOMI RAPACE did a bang up job as the sulky hacker babe in the Swedish language version of the Millenium trilogy authored by the late Stieg Larsson.\n\nOf course, there is an obligatory English language version coming out later this year with American-born actress ROONEY MARA in the title role. Hopefully for the movie’s investors the flick will do better at the box office than Let Me In, the American remake of the Swedish vampire film Let the Right One In.\n\nFortunately, DAVID FINCHER is directing the English language version of Tattoo and as the guy behind films like Fight Club, Se7en and Alien 3 he knows dark when he reads it. (So, I guess if we absolutely must have an English language Tattoo he’s the best guy for the job.)\n\nThe film is set for release in December and as you can see from the magazine cover below the marketing campaign has begun:\n\nGuess the Swedish title wasn’t catchy enough. Too bad. It captures the horror that is at the heart of this moody Scandinavian noir.\n\nAs the movie opens disgraced reporter Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) has resigned as publisher of Millennium after losing a libel suit filed by the subject of one of his journalistic exposes in the monthly magazine.\n\nYou know the old saying “One door closes and another door opens.”\n\nMikael has barely packed up his laptop when he gets an offer he can’t refuse from wealthy retired industrialist Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) who is willing to pay Mikael big bucks to investigate the disappearance of his favourite niece forty years ago. Seems Harriet Vanger vanished without a trace from the family’s private island in the north of Sweden in the fall of 1966 and the case has never been solved.\n\nLuckily the bemused middle aged journalist has 24 year old goth punk computer hacker Lisabeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) to help him figure out some of the clues. As any good reporter can tell you one good story invariably leads to another. Soon the unlikely crime solving couple are navigating their way through a dark twisty mystery involving Swedish Nazis, ritualistic murders and a nasty dysfunctional family with sinister secrets.\n\nThe movie is based on the first book in a trilogy by the late Swedish journalist Stieg Larsson. Working with screenwriters Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg, director Neils Arden Oplev has reduced Larsson’s mammoth 800 page best seller to a fighting trim 152 minutes.\n\nHowever, you don’t have to read the book to get sucked into the story. Oplev wastes no time introducing us to the main characters in revelatory ways and plugging us into the plot.\n\nIf you are a fan of the books, you won’t be disappointed by the casting. Nyqvist gives Mikael a kind of brooding, understated charm that befits our journalist hero and Rapace is a real find as the titular character. The actress plays Lisbeth with an almost feral intensity while at the same time revealing hints of the whipsmart intelligence and bruised psyche lurking just beneath the surface of that fearsome facade.\n\nIt is almost a shock to see the real Rapace who confides in an exclusive-to-Blu-Ray interview that she worried that producers would consider her “too girlish and feminine” for the role “even though I knew I could transform” into the character.\n\nThe onscreen chemistry between Nyqvist and Rapace does a lot to sell the idea of their improbable professional and romantic pairing.\n\nKudos as well to cinematographers Jens Fischer and Eric Kress who make the frigid settings and locations in the book come alive. I especially liked the way the natural beauty of the Swedish countryside acts as a kind of counterpoint to the unsettling feeling that something is deeply wrong with the people who inhabit this pristine landscape.\n\nBoth DVD and Blu-Ray discs come with the original Swedish audio track (with English subtitles) and an English dubbed track.\n\nHaving heard both tracks I have to say that the art of dubbing a foreign language film into English has come a long way from those badly synced Asian karate flicks of yore.\n\nStill, I prefer hearing actors talk in their native language. If you want to get a feeling for the culture that could serve as a setting for such a unique thriller you really have to experience it firsthand in its original Swedish language version (yes, that means reading subtitles.)\n\nNOTE: There is a relentlessly ugly (but mercifully brief) scene of sexual assault in this film. Viewers concerned with the scene should know that Lisabeth refuses to be a victim and exacts a brutal revenge on her oppressor. (The novel tends to be more graphic in its depictions of sexual violence.)"
