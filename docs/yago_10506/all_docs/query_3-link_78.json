        "text": "Yes me, although I haven't seen this week's or last week's yet but have recorded them.\n\nI was expecting it to be more like The Bridge etc. It couldn't be more different but I've really enjoyed it so far. For some reason DH fell asleep during the 2nd and 3rd ones and I don't know anyone in rl that watches so glad you have mentioned it!\n\nI watched it last Saturday - it took me a while to work out that the main policeman is my favourite Swedish actor! The smoking was hilarious though, they were lighting up every 2 minutes - I'm sure people didn't smoke quite so furiously in the 1950s!\n\nUnfortunately I fell asleep in the middle of last night's episode.\n\nThanks for replies. I can't put my finger on why I like it, I just do. It looks good and has the quirkiness of being Swedish nostalgia, I suppose. Can understand the nodding off too, though\n\nI really enjoy this programme too!! I think of it as a kind of Swedish \"Agatha Christie\" style thing.\n\nI love Puck's outfits and the fact that she is radically different to all the other women who are 1950s housewives. There is definitely a frisson between her and Christer.\n\nI agree that the smoking is constant!\n\nI enjoy it but laughed at the immaculately painted houses and brighter than bright colours in many of the episodes.\n\nI don't get why she gets to hang around Christer and the police as much though, she's supposed to be a literature student. She should get her act together and join the police or study forensic science or something. I'm not surprised her husband wonders wtf she is playing at, although it's hard to see what she sees in him except his money.\n\nI just had to re-join this thread in one of my old names (from a few years ago) to say how much I lurve Ola Rapace\n\n('Tis me, FruVikingessOla!)\n\nThe smoking is almost comical isn't it? I'm warming to it and enjoyed the last 2 episodes. Ola Rapace is an odd looking chap though and has an unfortunate habit of smirking.\n\nI had no idea Ola Rapace was Stefan in the original Wallander series. I did an images search and was a bit gob smacked. Am somewhat embarrassed to admit I prefer the Christer incarnation..\n\nThe uber smocking is as hilarious/annoying as it is in Mad Men and Puck's open access to crime scenes takes license surely.\n\nOla as Stefan was gorgeous in Wallander - that series was made in 2005 & 2006, I think. He's clearly aged a bit (but haven't we all?!) although I preferred him then.\n\nHis ex wife, Noomi, played Lisbeth Salander in the Girl With A Dragon Tattoo etc.\n\nI think I'd better set it to record tonight - it's the last one and I bet I fall asleep again"
