        "text": "In 2007, Noomi Rapace read for the part of Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish film version of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” as a long-shot contender. Though she was a smart and seasoned actress who had worked in film as well as onstage, she was known mainly to Stockholm theatergoers. Her name barely surfaced in the lively public debate in Sweden over who should play Lisbeth, one of the most sought after film roles for a Swedish actress in recent memory. Moreover, the film’s director, Niels Arden Oplev, feared that Rapace was too attractive to portray the androgynous Lisbeth. After working through a scene with her, though, he changed his mind. “When she’s Lisbeth and you put a camera on her, and she’s just sitting there looking at you, you think, Oh, my God, what is she going to do?” he says. “There’s an unpredictable, dark, dangerous energy that flows from her.”\n\nOnce he cast her, she gave herself over to the task of transforming into the alienated hacker-heroine of Stieg Larsson’s “Millennium” trilogy, even as the novels’ popularity began to snowball outside of Sweden. (The English translation of the first novel came out in 2008.) She trained with a Thai-boxing coach, submitted to multiple piercings and lopped off her hair. Then she shot the three films, one right after the other, over an 18-month period. When the first film opened, in February 2009, journalists from all over Europe descended on Stockholm to see it — and to see her, the unknown actress charged with interpreting what had suddenly become one of the world’s most popular characters."
