        "text": "My little sister, Lucy, has been guiding me to some worthy films and series that are featured on Netflix. When Lucy told me that Noomi Rapace was starring in The Trip,I knew that this was going to be a great film.\n\nThe Trip\n\nI’ve been following Noomi Rapace ever since I first saw her in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and later in Prometheus. She did not disappoint me in this Norwegian dark comedy, The Trip. Directed by Tommy Wirkola, and starring Aksel Hennie, Atle Antonsen, Christian Rubeck, Andre Erikesen, Stig Frod Henriksen, and Nils Ole Oftebro, the film is a study on a marriage gone bad…very bad.\n\nLars (Aksel Hennie) and his wife, Lisa (Noomi Repace), are at that stage in marriage when they get on each other’s last nerve, but instead of resorting to a safer solution like adultery, Lars decides to get his friend Viktor to assist in the murder and dismemberment of his wife. Lars directs soap operas on television, and Lisa does TV commercials and small parts in theatre. Lars talks Lisa into going up to his family’s cabin in the mountains to work on their marital problems, but first Lars visits his dad at a senior facility. Mikkel (Nils Ole Oftebro) wants to make sure that Lars takes good care of the cabin.\n\nThe car ride up is filled with tension and bickering…you know…the type of bickering where you chat, but each sentence carries a concealed dagger. Anyone married for a long time understands this kind of spousal tit for tat. Usually it is harmless, but on this trip, Lars has a plan to get rid of Lisa…permanently…but even though the hammer he bought will definitely do the job of murder, Lars doesn’t have the stomach for the dismembering part…and that is why he talks his friend Viktor (Stig Frod Henriksen) into helping dispose of the body. What Lars doesn’t count on is that Lisa had agreed to the trip with the same dark intentions. She is fed up with Lar’s gambling debts, and the bills…and the lack of sex…her weapon: a taser.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe film immediately goes from funny to scary after Lisa and Lars sort of cancel out each other’s murderous plans with the discovery of three dangerous criminals hiding in their attic.\n\nThe three criminals – Petter (Atle Antonsen), Dave (Christian Rubeck) and Roy (Andre Eriksen) – are comical at first. They are like the Norwegian version of the Three Stooges, but the comedy soon turns to horror as the three escaped convicts plan to torture, then kill Lisa and Lars.\n\nThe film is devilishly good because of the top shelf acting, the fast-paced action, and the unexpected disasters of which there are many. Each scene is more outlandish that the previous scene, but the viewer is never disappointed.\n\nSometimes love dies a slow and tortuous death, and sometimes…a massacre will bring a couple closer. Watch the show on Netflix. Granny promises that The Trip is a keeper."
