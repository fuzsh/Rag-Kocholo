        "text": "Birth Name: Noomi Norén\n\nPlace of Birth: Hudiksvall, Gävleborg, Sweden\n\nDate of Birth: 28 December, 1979\n\nEthnicity:\n\n*father – Spanish, possibly Romani\n\n*mother – Swedish\n\nNoomi Rapace is a Swedish actress. She starred as Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish films The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest. Her other roles, many of which are international productions, include the films Daisy Diamond, Beyond, The Monitor, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, Prometheus, Dead Man Down, The Drop (2014), Child 44, Unlocked, What Happened to Monday, Bright, Rupture, Stockholm (2018), Close, Angel of Mine, The Secrets We Keep, Lamb, The Trip (2021), You Won’t Be Alone, and Black Crab, and the show Jack Ryan.\n\nNoomi is the daughter of Nina Norén and Rogelio Durán Ramos. Her father was a Spanish Flamenco singer from Badajoz. Her mother is a Swedish actress. Her sister is photographer Særún Norén.\n\nNoomi has said that her father may have been of part Romani descent, and though she is “not sure if it is true,” she has “always been interested in the culture.”\n\nNoomi has a son with her former husband, actor Ola Rapace. They both selected Rapace as their stage surname. The word means “bird of prey” in Spanish and Italian.\n\nNoomi’s maternal grandfather was Holger Gustaf Norén (the son of Gustaf Emanuel Norén and Hilda Wilhelmina Engberg). Holger was born in Adolf Fredrik, Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden. Noomi’s great-grandfather Gustaf was born in Potchefstroom, South Africa, the son of Swedish parents, Viktor Emanuel Norén and Hilda Emerentia Helling, who were from Lidköping, Västra Götaland. Noomi’s great-grandmother Hilda was the daughter of Gustaf Engberg and Hulda Wilhelmina Olsson.\n\nNoomi’s maternal grandmother was Svea Elisabet Andersson, later changed to Antelius (the daughter of Karl Anatolius Andersson, later Antelius, and of Ellen Elisabeth Johansson). Svea was born in Katarina, Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden. Karl was the son of Karl Vilhelm Andersson and Karolina Vilhelmina Persdotter. Ellen was the daughter of Carl August Johansson and Anna Maria Petersdotter.\n\nNoomi’s matrilineal ancestry can be traced to her fifth great-grandmother, Elin Månsdotter (1755, Anglemåla – 1824)."
