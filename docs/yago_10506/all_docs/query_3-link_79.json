        "text": "Winning a career-making role in the Dragon Tattoo films brought a strange mixture of pleasure and pain to rising star Noomi Rapace.\n\nThe 30-year-old actress knew she had to nail the part of androgynous anti-hero Lisbeth Salander - or risk offending the many fans of the creator, best-selling author Stieg Larsson.\n\nSo to really convince as the punky, chain-smoking, kick-ass computer hacker, Noomi embarked on a remarkable transformation.\n\nShe went on a strict diet, trained in kickboxing and Thai boxing and even took her motorcycle licence. A non-smoker, she began puffing her way through \"thousands of cigarettes\" both on-set and off it.\n\nAnd she wouldn't even consider faking all those piercings in Salander's ears and nose because, as Noomi puts it, \"I wanted to feel those piercings in myself.\"\n\nBefore the make-up artists and piercers got to work, Noomi - who plays Salander in the original Swedish movie adaptation of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and reprises it in the sequel The Girl Who Played With Fire, out in cinemas here on Friday - looked nothing like the hard-bitten Salander.\n\nBut the sweet-faced star, who is laid back and engaging, offering to fetch food and drink when we meet for a chat in a Stockholm hotel, has always been a rebel at heart.\n\nShe admits she used to drink herself into oblivion, desperate to be the last person standing. She also left home to live with a boyfriend at 14, and moved alone to Stockholm a year later to enrol in drama school. \"I've always felt like I don't really fit in,\" says Noomi with a shrug. \"When I was a kid everyone was watching Beverley Hills 90210 or Baywatch and I'd be thinking, 'What do you see in it because I don't really care?'\n\n\"I only had one close friend. Now I have more but I'm still selective. And I had my first boyfriend pretty young and lived with him when I was 14.\n\n\"I was a total disaster as a kid. I just wanted to be drunk. Everybody would be partying and I'd be with the guys, drinking whiskey. I wanted to drink more than they could and to be awake longer than anyone else. I was always trying to see how far I could take things.\n\n\"Now I can do it in my acting, but then I did it with alcohol. Now I go running to clean myself, but when I was younger I used alcohol to relax and clean my brain.\n\n\"I always felt it was up to me to do what I want to do. Nobody else was going to help me or fix it for me.\n\n\"When I met my husband Ola I was totally surprised that life wasn't lonely. I'd felt lonely up to then.\"\n\nBut despite feeling secure at home, Noomi was still worried about her portrayal of Salander.\n\nAn early fan of Larsson's books, which have sold 32 million copies worldwide, she knew that if she got it wrong a lot of people would be very upset. It made the first premiere a nerve-racking affair.\n\n\"I was terrified,\" says Noomi with a laugh.\n\n\"I was in total panic when the first film opened in Stockholm. It was horrible.\n\n\"I thought everybody would hate it and hate me because everybody loved the books and liked Salander so much. The pressure felt like a suicide mission.\n\n\"Slowly during the weeks afterwards, I met people who'd seen it and I realised, 'It's OK, they don't hate me. I can go outside and they won't kill me'.\"\n\nThere is already talk of a Best Actress Oscar nomination and she's been in meetings with Hollywood directors, including Ridley Scott, about her blossoming career.\n\nShe also got a big thumbs up from Eva Gabrielsson, Larsson's partner of 30 years.\n\nNoomi says: \"I've never met Eva but at the premiere of The Girl Who Played With Fire a friend of hers gave me a rose from Eva, as a thank you. I was overwhelmed.\"\n\nTORMENTED\n\nBut not everyone was thrilled by the effort she put in to transform herself into the tormented Salander, including her actor husband Ola and their son Lev, six.\n\nShe explains: \"Sometimes I'd be short or moody and my friends and family would ask, 'Why are you being like this?' but at the time I couldn't see it.\n\n\"Did my husband like the transformation? No! Not so much. He asked me, 'How far are you going with this?' \"I wanted to get rid of my female body, to become like a boy. He understands and respects the way I work, but he likes me better when I'm feminine.\"\n\nBorn in Hudiksvall, a city two hours drive north of Stockholm, Noomi was raised by her Swedish mother and Icelandic stepfather.\n\nSadly, she only got to know her biological father, a Spanish flamenco singer, a short time before he died of cancer in 2007. Noomi says: \"I met my father when I was grown up and I was always wondering who he was and what do I have from him.\n\n\"I was always wondering who this other person was that I looked like because I didn't look like anybody else. I was trying to figure out who he was and why he wasn't part of my life.\n\n\"Yeah, I did get answers. I met him when he was dying and I think I understood.\n\nHis life was complicated. When I was younger the most difficult thing for me was to forgive. I believed it made you vulnerable to admit to needing anyone. But I forgave him and we came to something good together.\"\n\nTROUBLED\n\nHer character Salander also has a troubled relationship with her father, which is explored more deeply in the second film. The three Swedish Larsson films were filmed in quick succession and now Hollywood is remaking the trilogy with Bond star Daniel Craig as journalist Mikael Blomkvist.\n\nTwilight's Kristen Stewart and Harry Potter's Emma Watson were battling it out to play Salander, but the role has gone to unknown actress Mara Rooney - much to Noomi's relief.\n\nShe says: \"Lisbeth had been inside me for one-and-a-half years. When we finished the last scene the producers came with champagne. I'm never sick, but I said 'I have to go to the bathroom,' and then I started to throw up.\n\n\"I couldn't stop. I was throwing up for an hour. It was like my body was throwing Lisbeth out of my system.\n\nBrutal, but I left her at that moment.\"\n\nThe Girl Who Played With Fire opens in UK cinemas on Friday."
