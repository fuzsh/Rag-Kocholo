        "text": "I’m happy to introduce a new site special that will allow me to keep up with screencaptures from Noomi’s films that haven’t been added in the last couple of years. While there are a couple of films to wrap up, I’ve decided to do it weekly with one update posted every Sunday from now on until Christmas (which will have a great surprise for all visitors) Let’s start with the first in line – 2019’s “Stockholm” about the bank robbery that gave birth to the “Stockholm Syndrome”. The Canadian film, starring Ethan Hawke, Noomi Rapace and Mark Strong, was shelfed for more than two years after being theatrically released in the US and the UK (titled “The Captor”, for whatever reason). “Stockholm” is not a documentary and a bit too focused on the absurdity of the story, in my opinion, but it’s still worth a watch, especially for Noomi’s performance. High quality screencaptures from the Blu-Ray can be now found in the photo gallery. Next week: Angel of Mine.\n\nRelated Media\n\nPhoto Gallery – Career Photography – Feature Films – Stockholm – Blu-Ray Screencaptures\n\nOn Thursday, Noomi Rapace and Ethan Hawke have attended the Tribeca Film Festival alongside director Robert Budreau to celebrate the world-premiere of “Stockholm.” So far, only The Hollywood Reporter has posted a review, so let’s wait for more to drop. In the meantime, lots of pictures from the premiere have been added to the photo gallery with many thanks to Joan for sending them in. Edit: More reviews have been added, and it’s great to see good reviews for the film and especially praise for Noomi’s performance!\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter, John De Fore (April 19, 2018)\n\nAs the hostage who will come to most closely identify with the outlaws, Rapace has the film’s biggest job. She’s not so insensitive as to make it look easy. Bianca is married with two young children, and, judging solely from Rapace’s mien, harbors no fantasies about running away with a rogue. But she notices every thing Lars does to make this ordeal easier for her, sees how he is subtly disrespected by the man he’s trying to rescue, and, late in the plot, realizes Lars is the same criminal who once saved the life of an old man while robbing his house. And just as important, Bianca is allowed a few bits of contact with her husband (one of which is a nervously comic highlight), and that decent, frightened man lets her down in banal but telling ways.\n\nVariety, Owen Gleiberman (April 21, 2018)\n\nEnough filmmakers have nailed the early ’70s that even if you didn’t live through it, you can tell when a movie misses the era. In “Stockholm,” the hair and clothes are accurate in a costume-shop way, but the atmosphere is too slick and bright and punchy. The one performer with the right desultory presence is Noomi Rapace, under big glasses and long straight sandy blonde hair held back in a bun. Her Bianca just wants to stay alive and get home to her two children. The question is, what’s her best strategy?\n\nSlash Film, Hoai-Tran Bui (April 21, 2018)\n\nThe movie goes out of its way to convince us that Lars is a sympathetic character, flying into a panic over his hostages’ well-being as often as he flies into a rage. In another person’s hands, Lars would have probably veered toward comic relief or even mentally disabled, but this incompetent, outrageous robber is given pathos by Hawke’s no-holds-barred performance. He’s supported by a revelatory turn by Rapace, who lends a quiet strength to Bianca, and Mark Strong’s stoic straight man.\n\n“Stockholm” will have its world-premiere today at the Tribeca Film Festival. Directed by Robert Burdreau, the film is based on a 1973 bank heist and hostage crisis that was documented a year later in a New Yorker article titled “The Bank Drama” by Daniel Lang. Lars Nystrom (Hawke) dons a disguise to raid a central Stockholm bank. He then takes hostages, one of them being Bianca (Noomi Rapace), a wife and mother of two, in order to spring his pal Gunnar (Mark Strong) from prison. Negotiations with detectives come to a halt when the police refuse to let Lars leave in a getaway car with the hostages. As hours turn into days, Lars alternates between threatening the hostages and making them feel comfortable and secure. The hostages develop an uneasy relationship with their captor, which is particularly complex for Bianca, who develops a strong bond with Lars as she witnesses his caring nature. The Bianca-Lars relationship gives rise to the psychological phenomenon known as “Stockholm Syndrome” — hence the title of the film. Make sure to check back for reviews tomorrow.\n\nThe Tribeca Film Festival is now going into its 17th year, and while it still doesn’t command the respect of a Sundance or Cannes or Toronto, it’s certainly been able to find its identity in recent years. This April, the Noomi Rapace-starring “Stockholm” will have its world-premiere at the festival. A definite date has not been set – the festival runs from April 18-29. A new production still featuring Ethan Hawke and Noomi Rapace has been added to the photo gallery. Many thanks to Marinka for the heads-up.\n\nStockholm, directed and written by Robert Budreau. Produced by Nicholas Tabarrok, Robert Budreau, Jonathan Bronfman. (Canada, Sweden, USA) – World Premiere. In 1973, an unhinged American outlaw walked into a bank in Sweden demanding millions in cash in exchange for his hostages. The events that followed would capture the attention of the world and ultimately give a name to a new psychological phenomenon: Stockholm syndrome. With Ethan Hawke, Noomi Rapace, Mark Strong, Christopher Heyerdahl, Bea Santos, Thorbjorn Harr.\n\nDarius Films has released a first production still and on-set picture from the upcoming thriller “Stockholm”, starring Ethan Hawke, Noomi Rapace and Mark Strong. Both pictures can be found in the photo gallery. Written and directed by Robert Budreau, the film follows the drama chronicled in the New Yorker article “The Bank Drama” by Daniel Lan about the hostages who bonded with their captors and turned against the authorities, giving rise to the psychological phenomenon known as “Stockholm Syndrome.” “Stockholm will offer moviegoers a raw glimpse into intense events that transpired over four decades ago coining a psychological condition that still intrigues the world today,” said Jonathan Kier, Sierra/Affinity’s President of International Sales & Distribution. “With Robert’s creative direction coupled with Ethan and Noomi’s tremendous talents, we are certain audiences around the globe will be captivated by this thrilling true story.”\n\nAccording to Deadline, Ethan Hawke and Noomi Rapace have been set to star in Stockholm, a thriller written and to be directed by Robert Budreau, who wrote and directed Hawke in the Chet Baker biopic Born To Be Blue. Production is now set to begin in April with Sierra/Affinity to handle international sales beginning at the European Film Market next month in Berlin. The pic is based on the true story of a 1973 bank heist and hostage crisis in Stockholm that was documented in a 1974 New Yorker article “The Bank Drama” by Daniel Lang. The hostages bonded with their captors and turned against the authorities, and gave rise to the psychological phenomenon “Stockholm syndrome.” Scott Aversano and Will Russell-Shapiro are exec producing and overseeing via Aversano Films along with Jason Blum via Blumhouse Productions. Nicholas Tabarrok will produce via his Darius Films banner, with Budreau via his Lumanity banner, and Jonathan Bronfman via his JoBro Productions banner. William Santor, John Hills and Andrew Chang-Sang are also executive producing for financier Productivity Media. Here’s hoping that “Stockholm” will move forward faster than “Unlocked” or “What Happened to Monday?”"
