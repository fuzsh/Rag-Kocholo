        "text": "As ‘Alien: Covenant’ edges closers, its director Sir Ridley Scott is gradually revealing more and more about the hugely anticipated follow up to 2012′s ‘Prometheus’.\n\nThe latest piece of info comes in a recent interview with the Daily Mail, where Scott talks frankly about the first film’s star Noomi Rapace.\n\nWhen asked about Rapace’s inclusion in the sequel, he simply replied, “no.”\n\n“We’re still casting the main roles,” Scott shared. Presumably he’s talking about the female lead, as it’s believed that Michael Fassbender - arguably the best thing about ‘Prometheus’ - will return to the series as David.\n\nIt was believed that Rapace’s Elizabeth Shaw would be joining him, but clearly things have changed.\n\nWhile it seems Rapace. for whatever reason, is to be replaced, it appears Scott is still planning to cast a female lead, and a strong one at that, if his comments are anything to go by: “I’ve been married to strong women; and three out of the four people I work closely with are women,” he said.\n\nYet he doesn’t reveal the reason why Rapace has been dropped. Could it be because her character (and indeed acting) wasn’t quite up to the task in the first film?\n\nPersonally speaking, it’d be great to see Charlize Theron’s Meredith Vickers return because her character was particularly interesting, considering her connections to Peter Weyland and the speculation whether she was human or not. Going on what Scott shows us, she’s dead and buried (or more specifically squashed) underneath the rolling ship. But you never know…\n\nScott’s already signed on to executively produce Neill Blomkamp’s ‘Alien’ movie (currently dubbed ‘Alien 5′), where a host of original cast, including Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn, will reprise their roles.\n\n- Disney Characters Reimagined As Tim Burton Creations\n\n- Christoph Waltz To Return To Bond?\n\n- Quentin Tarantino Hints At Kill Bill 3"
