        "text": "With production underway on new Bond film Skyfall , a bit of casting news has been announced through the film’s official Twitter feed, with Helen McRory and Ola Rapace joining the impressive ensemble.\n\nMcRory is probably best recognised for her work on the Harry Potter films where she played Draco Malfoy’s mother, Narcissa. She’ll soon be known for another fantasy epic in due course, when she appears in Martin Scorsese’s Hugo .\n\nRapace on the other hand, is a bit of an unknown, at least to the US market. He’s worked primarily in his native Sweden, although he was married (they’re now divorced) to crossover star Noomi Rapace.\n\nThe pair will appear alongside a raft of big names, including Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Bérénice Marlohe, Judi Dench, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Ben Whishaw. Quite the lineup, we think you’ll agree.\n\nAnd just in case you’ve been living under a rock these last few weeks, here’s the official synopsis for the new film: “In Skyfall , Bond's loyalty to M is tested as her past comes back to haunt her. As MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.” Skyfall will arrive in UK screens on 26 October 2012."
