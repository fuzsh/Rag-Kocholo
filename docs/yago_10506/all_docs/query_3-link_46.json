        "text": "Karen Olsson, a journalist and novelist, wrote this week’s cover article on the actress Noomi Rapace. She last wrote for the magazine about Mike Judge, the creator of ‘‘Beavis and Butt-Head.’’\n\nDid you find Rapace very different from the intense characters she plays?\n\nAll her characters are so different, and none of them come across the way she does. In the first scene of ‘‘Beyond,’’ in which her character wakes up in bed with her husband (played by Ola Rapace, who was then her actual husband, though they’ve since divorced), she strikes me as somewhat Noomi-like. In part because she’s smiling.\n\nHow did she explain the fact that she had thrown up after filming ‘‘Girl With a Dragon Tattoo’’? Did she dislike the character?\n\nI don’t think she would put it that way. I think it was tough to be possessed by such an isolated, alienated character.\n\nRidley Scott fans will be curious about any movie that ‘‘shares DNA’’ with ‘‘Alien.’’ Did Rapace tell you anything further about her character, the movie or how she prepared for the part?\n\nWe spoke some about her character Elizabeth Shaw’s background: she grew up in Africa, her father was a priest, she graduated from Oxford at 17, her parents were killed and she’s searching for answers. Noomi said that in order to play a religious character, she had to take herself back to feelings she had when she was a child — to a sense she had then that she was being watched by an angel, to spiritual instincts from her childhood. About the film itself she was circumspect, as everyone involved has been.\n\nWill Rapace stay in Berlin, or is it likely she’ll migrate to Hollywood because of her expanding career?\n\nNoomi has spoken of herself as a nomad — able to go anywhere. I think that while she was in Berlin, she was quite focused on her work, spending time with her son and going to yoga. So while she seemed perfectly comfortable there, I don’t know how much of Berlin she was experiencing. Coincidentally, I had brought my son to Berlin earlier this year, and we talked about our shared sense that Germans (or some Germans, anyway) believe that kids should keep quiet, stay in their designated kid zones and not disturb the order of things. And that’s not so comfortable.\n\nAs for Hollywood: while she doesn’t plan to live in L.A., she has come to feel that there are good opportunities for her there.\n\nThe detail about her not going to the gym — because it was wrong for her ‘‘Sherlock Holmes’’ role — was reassuring.\n\nShe wants to keep things as authentic as possible. We talked about how lame it is when female characters wake up in the morning wearing full makeup. I think there has been at least one story online about the fact that in “Prometheus,” when it was relevant, she encouraged the makeup artist to add more blood, more sweat, more dirt — she didn’t want to look pretty for her big-ordeal scenes."
