Paris has been dating DJ Afrojack, but he's nowhere near the fame league that Kanye is in, and adding to that, the relationship has now cooled. He didn't accompany Paris to Cannes and he didn't go with her to Las Vegas for Memorial Day while he was working in Atlantic City,\" the source added.\n\nTools:\n\nPermalink\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nComments (0)\n\nEmail this story\n\nKim Kardashian banned Rihanna from Kanye West's dressing room during his recent London concerts.\n\nThe reality TV starlet doesn't want her 34-year-old boyfriend hanging out with other women on his own and with Rihanna's flirtatious reputation, she wasn't taking any chances when she wasn't at The O2 arena for his Watch the Throne tour shows with Jay-Z.\n\nKim is believed to have not been a fan of the \"You Da One\" singer since she was romantically linked to her brother Rob Kardashian several months ago. \"Kim doesn't want women near him unless she is there - even friends. The fact Rihanna was linked to Rob probably didn't help,\" a source said.\n\nHowever, it's not just Rihanna that Kim, 31, is jealous of. She is also said to have ordered him to leave a party in London last week after he spent too much time with other revellers instead of her. \"Kim was all over Kanye at the start, but when he started to mix with other people she had a stern word and took him away from the party. He followed her orders with minimum fuss. He knows the deal,\" a source said.\n\nTools:\n\nPermalink\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nComments (0)\n\nEmail this story\n\nNoomi Rapace still loves her ex-husband. The 32-year-old actress and Ola Rapace - who have nine-year-old son Lev together - separated in September 2010 and despite claims their 10-year marriage ended in animosity, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo star insists they still get on well.\n\n\"The Swedish press was really nasty about it, and has written a lot of things that aren't true. There was no war. We're still close, and I love him. But we're both quite intense, and it could be quite explosive. We were fighting a lot, and it just felt like it was best to change things. So we did. And we're both happier today.\"\n\nNoomi was just 20 when she and Ola, who is now 40, tied the knot and she admits her family thought she was \"crazy\" to marry so young. \"Everyone said, 'What, are you crazy?'\" she said.\n\nThe Prometheus actress has previously admitted she was rebellious when she was younger and left school when she was just 15 years old: \"When I was 14, I had piercings, I dyed my hair blonde, I looked terrible. I just wanted to get drunk every day.\"\n\nTools:\n\nPermalink\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nComments (0)\n\nEmail this story\n\nLindsay Lohan still hasn't paid the $41,031 she owes to a tanning company.\n\nNine months ago, the troubled actress was ordered by a judge in Nevada to pay Tanning Vegas - run by entrepreneur Lorit Simon - what was owed and now the company is trying to get the case moved to California so they can cite her assets and force her to pay up, according to TMZ. Lindsay racked up the huge bill between 2007 to 2009 when she was a client of the tanning company.\n\nThis is the latest in a long line of legal disputes for the 25-year-old actress, who was recently reported to have paid off a member of staff at the Betty Ford rehab clinic who is she is accused of being violent towards.\n\nDawn Holland sued Lindsay following the incident where she was apparently opposed to taking a breathalyzer test. According to the prosecutor, the actress appeared intoxicated at the time and Holland says she grabbed her right wrist, \"twisting and pulling it for eight to 10 seconds.\" However, the case was closed for an undisclosed amount.\n\nTools:\n\nPermalink\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nComments (0)\n\nEmail this story\n\nDemi Moore and Ashton Kutcher have reportedly met up to discuss the future of their relationship.\n\nThe estranged couple - who split last year following claims Ashton cheated on Demi - have seen each other at least twice in the past month to talk about what is going to happen in the future. According to RadarOnline.com, the pair were together last week for the birthday party of the man who officiated at their wedding, Rabbi Yehuda Berg.\n\n\"They have met up to discuss where to go next. Whether it be to divorce, or if there is a journey to travel together ... they both feel it's important to have spiritual guidance to accomplish it. I know they met up with Rabbi around the time of the Gemini New Moon last Monday, it signifies a time of new beginnings, especially when it comes to communication, so they met again before the party, at least once, maybe twice,\" a source said.\n\nHowever, they are still unclear about what to do. \"The idea was to discuss, where do they go from here. They're by no means getting back together but equally no decision has been made to end things for good so everything is to play at this stage,\" the source added.\n\nTools:\n\nPermalink\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nComments (0)\n\nEmail this story\n\nJustin Bieber has been accused of assault.\n\nThe 18-year-old pop star was allegedly involved in a physical altercation with a photographer at The Commons mall in Calabasas, California - where he has just purchased a $6.5 million mansion - after a paparazzo attempted to take pictures of the \"Boyfriend\" singer and his girlfriend Selena Gomez.\n\nFollowing the incident, the photographer called the police before he was taken to hospital complaining of chest pains, but he was discharged shortly afterwards, TMZ.com reports.\n\nWhen police arrived at the scene Justin and Selena had already left the shopping center - where they had gone to watch a film - but the officials are hoping to speak to the \"Never Say Never\" hitmaker and any other witnesses about the altercation after the snapper filed a report to the police naming Justin as the culprit. Witnesses, however, have claimed the paparazzo was blocking Justin's car in as he was trying to leave the shopping center, and the singer is then said to have got out of the vehicle to ask him to move away but he didn't so a scuffle broke out.\n\nClick to continue reading Justin Bieber Accused of Assault\n\nTools:\n\nPermalink\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nComments (0)\n\nEmail this story\n\nKim Kardashian has accused British Airways of stealing from her luggage.\n\nThe reality star has recently been on a promotional trip to London and to film scenes for her latest TV show, and she claimed the visit ended on a sour note after \"sentimental\" items were removed from her suitcase.\n\n\"Very disappointed in British Airways for opening my luggage & taking some special items of mine!
