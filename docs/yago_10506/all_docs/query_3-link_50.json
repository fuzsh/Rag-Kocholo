        "text": "Noomi Rapace (/ˈnoʊmi rəˈpɑːs/ noh-mee rə-pahss;[1] née Norén; born December 28, 1979) is a Swedish actress.[2] She is best known for her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish/Danish film adaptations of the Millennium series: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest.[3] She is also known for playing Leena in Beyond (2010), Anna in Babycall (2011), Madame Simza in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011), and the lead role of Dr. Elizabeth Shaw in theRidley Scott science fiction film Prometheus (2012).\n\nRapace was born in Hudiksvall, Sweden. Her mother, Nina Norén (born Kristina Norén; 1954) is a Swedish actress, and her father, Rogelio Durán (November 10, 1953 – November 4, 2006), was a Spanish Flamenco singer from Badajoz.[4] She has said that her father may have been of part Roma descent, and though she is \"not sure if it is true,\" she has \"always been interested in the culture.\"[5][6] Rapace's sister, Særún Norén, is a photographer.[3] Rapace has said she saw her father only occasionally before his death. At the age of five, she moved from her native Sweden to Flúðir, Iceland with her mother and stepfather. Two years later, she made her film debut in a minor role in In the Shadow of the Raven.\n\nIn 1996, she made her television debut playing the part of Lucinda Gonzales in the series Tre kronor. From 1998 to 1999, Rapace studied at Skara Skolscen. She has been engaged at Theater Plaza 2000–01, Orionteatern 2001, Teater Galeasen 2002, Stockholms stadsteaterin 2003 as well as at the Royal Dramatic Theatre. In 2007, she won acclaim for her award-winning portrayal of a troubled teen mother in the Danish film Daisy Diamond, directed bySimon Staho. She won the two top film awards in Denmark (the Bodil and Robert prize) for Best Actress for her role in the film, which was also selected for the main competition at theSan Sebastián International Film Festival. The film was criticized for the abuse a baby actor was subjected to during production.\n\nFilmography Credits[]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noomi_Rapace#Film\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noomi_Rapace#Television\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noomi_Rapace#Awards_and_nominations\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAt the age of seven, Rapace was given her first film role, which was a non-speaking part in the film Í skugga hrafnsins by Hrafn Gunnlaugsson. This experience made her decide to be an actress.\n\nShe left home at age 15 and enrolled in a Stockholm theatre school.\n\nRapace married Swedish actor Ola Norell in 2001. Together, they chose the surname Rapace after they were married; it means \"bird of prey\" in French and Italian. The couple has a son named Lev. In September 2010, the couple filed for divorce, taking effect during 2011.\n\nReferences[edit][]\n\n^ Noomi Rapace Pronunciation in Swedish audio link (Retrieved 10 June 2012)\n\n^ Karen Olsson, Noomi Rapace Arrives in Hollywood, by Way of Outer Space, The New York Times Magazine, 27 May 2012, p. 26.\n\n^ a b Peter Howell (26 March 2010). \"Rising star became the girl with the dragon tattoo\".
