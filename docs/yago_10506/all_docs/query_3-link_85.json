        "text": "\"Sambo\" in Swedish is short for \"samboende\", meaning cohabitation. And now Swedes have chosen their favorite “sambo”: Carina Berg, a TV-host. In a poll conducted by Svensk Fastighetsförmedling (Swedish Real Estate Ltd), Berg tops the list of who Swedes would most like to move in with during 2013, beating both Princess Madeleine and her fellow TV-host Gina Dirawi. Berg is most popular among both men and women, coming in first among women and second among men. Men put the Princess at the top followed by Berg then Dirawi sharing third place with Noomi Rapace while women put André Pops (TV-host, sports journalist) and Ola Rapace after Berg,\n\nCarina Berg has won the hearts of Swedes through the popular TV-series “Berg flyttar in”, in which she moves into the homes of famous Swedes and get to live with them for a few days. She is popular among both men and women. In “Berg flyttar in” (literally “Berg moves in”), she tries to get closer to the famous people, following them during their day-to-day business.\n\nThe next most popular “sambo” is Princess Madeleine, followed by Gina Dirawi, a blogger, TV-host and comedian.\n\nDirector of the Press Department at Svensk Fastighetsförmedling, Bessie Wedholm, says: “(Singer) Sarah Dawn Finer is also among the top, which may have to do with the fact that she was the 2012 Christmas TV-host.” The least popular “sambo” was Gunilla Persson, from the reality TV program “Svenska Hollywoodfruar” (Swedish Hollywood Wives)."
