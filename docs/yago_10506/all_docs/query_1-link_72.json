        "text": "Forget Tom Hiddleston and Idris Elba — could the 37-year-old Swedish actress Noomi Rapace be the outside bet to be the next James Bond? I wouldn’t have asked, but in her new film, Unlocked, she plays a fearsome spy dashing around London being endlessly double-crossed in her attempts to thwart a biological weapons attack. Orlando Bloom plays her sexy bit of fluff, she goes for power cocktails with Michael Douglas, and almost manages to make jumping a fence in 4in heels look like a credible character choice. In short, it is the perfect audition tape for 007, albeit minus the one appendage traditionally associated with the role.\n\nSo what do you reckon, Noomi? Are you up for Bond? “Yes, I think the world is ready"
