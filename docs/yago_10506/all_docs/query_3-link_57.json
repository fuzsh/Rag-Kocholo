She achieved fame with her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish film adaptations of the Millennium series: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. In 2011, she was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actress for her performance in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nContents\n\nPrometheus interviews with noomi rapace and michael fassbender\n\nDp 30 the girl with the dragon tattoo actress noomi rapace\n\nEarly life\n\nEarly work\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\n\nHollywood\n\nPersonal life\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nShe is also known for playing Anna in Daisy Diamond (2007), Leena in Beyond (2010), Anna in The Monitor (2011), Madame Simza Heron in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011), the lead role of Dr. Elizabeth Shaw in the Ridley Scott science-fiction film Prometheus (2012), Beatrice in Dead Man Down (2013), Nadia in The Drop (2014), Raisa Demidova in Child 44 (2015) and the 7 lead roles in What Happened to Monday (2017).\n\nDp 30 the girl with the dragon tattoo actress noomi rapace\n\nEarly life\n\nRapace was born in Hudiksvall, Sweden. Her mother, Nina Norén (born Kristina Norén; 1954), is a Swedish actress, and her father, Rogelio Durán (10 November 1953 – 4 November 2006), was a Spanish Flamenco singer from Badajoz. She has said that her father may have been of part Romani descent, and though she is \"not sure if it is true,\" she has \"always been interested in the culture.\" Rapace's sister, Særún Norén, is a photographer. Rapace has said she saw her father only occasionally before his death. At the age of five, she moved from her native Sweden to Flúðir in Iceland with her mother and stepfather. Two years later, she made her film debut in a minor role in the Icelandic film In the Shadow of the Raven. Rapace speaks fluent Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian, and English in addition to her native Swedish.\n\nEarly work\n\nAt the age of seven, Rapace was given her first film role, a non-speaking part in the Icelandic film In the Shadow of the Raven by Hrafn Gunnlaugsson. This experience prompted her to be an actress. She left home at age 15 and enrolled in a Stockholm theatre school.\n\nIn 1996, she made her television debut playing the part of Lucinda Gonzales in the long-running soap series Tre kronor. From 1998 to 1999, Rapace studied at the acting school Skara Skolscen. She has been engaged at Theater Plaza 2000–01, Orionteatern 2001, Teater Galeasen 2002, Stockholms stadsteater in 2003, as well as at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, all in Stockholm.\n\nIn 2007, she won acclaim for her award-winning portrayal of a troubled teen mother in the Danish film Daisy Diamond, directed by Simon Staho. She won the two top film awards in Denmark (the Bodil and Robert prize) for Best Actress for her role in the film, which was also selected for the main competition at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. The film received some criticism for the supposed abuse occurring to a baby actor during production.\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\n\nIn 2009, she played the role of Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish-produced film adaptation of the best-selling novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, for which she won the Guldbagge Award (Sweden's top film award) and was nominated for a BAFTA Award and European Film Award. She reprised this role in the sequels The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest (all three were subsequently recut as a six-part miniseries aired on Swedish television called Millennium).\n\nHollywood\n\nOn 11 September 2010, Entertainment Weekly reported that Rapace had been cast in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, her first English-speaking role, as a French-Romani woman; the film was released in 2011.\n\nHer international fame has earned her leading roles in American cinema. She was cast in Ridley Scott's blockbuster hit Prometheus, where she played the leading role, a scientist named Elizabeth Shaw. She had met Scott for the first time following the release of the Millennium trilogy movies, at which point he expressed a willingness to work with her and encouraged her to improve her accent. Prometheus was released in June 2012. She did not appear in the final cut of the film's sequel Alien: Covenant (2017), but did act in a short related prologue.\n\nIn November 2012, she appeared in a Rolling Stones video for the single \"Doom and Gloom\" shot in the studios of the Cité du Cinéma by Luc Besson in Saint-Denis.\n\nIn 2013, she starred alongside Rachel McAdams in Brian De Palma's erotic thriller Passion, which is the English-language remake of 2010's French psychological thriller Love Crime. They both appeared in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, but did not share scenes. Rapace also appeared in Niels Arden Oplev's crime thriller Dead Man Down, alongside Isabelle Huppert and Colin Farrell.\n\nIn 2014, she appeared as Nadia in Michael Roskam's thriller The Drop, alongside Tom Hardy, Matthias Schoenaerts, and James Gandolfini. On September 2014, she was the subject of the short film A Portrait of Noomi Rapace, directed by artist and designer Aitor Throup and scored by Flying Lotus. In the same year, Rapace appeared in the video for the single \"eez-eh\" by Kasabian.\n\nIn 2015, she starred as Raisa Demidova in Daniel Espinosa's Child 44, opposite Tom Hardy (her co-star in The Drop) also starring Gary Oldman, Vincent Cassel, Jason Clarke, and Joel Kinnaman.\n\nRapace will be in the upcoming sci-fi thriller Brilliance, although her role is not known yet. She will also star in the spy thriller Unlocked, with Michael Douglas, John Malkovich, Orlando Bloom, and Toni Collette; will lead the sci-fi/actioner Seven Sisters (released on Netflix under title \"What Happened to Monday\") opposite Glenn Close and Willem Dafoe and the sci-fi/thriller Rupture by Steven Shainberg.\n\nOn 12 May 2015, it was announced that she will play opera singer Maria Callas in a biopic directed by Niki Caro. On 5 November 2015, it was announced that Rapace is in talks to portray Amy Winehouse in a new biopic about the late singer's life directed by Kirsten Sheridan.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRapace married Swedish actor Ola Norell in 2001. Together, they chose the surname \"Rapace\" after they were married, which means \"bird of prey\" in French. They have a son who was born in 2003. In September 2010, the couple filed for divorce, taking effect in 2011.\n\nFilmography\n\nActress\n\n-\n\nConstellation (TV Series) (filming) as\n\nJo\n\n-\n\nHearts of Stone (Short) (post-production) as\n\nPaula\n\n2022\n\nDjango (TV Series) as\n\nElizabeth\n\n- Masquerade (2023) -
