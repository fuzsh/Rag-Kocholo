        "text": "Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen, Twilight, Red Riding Hood) will direct Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) in a biopic of Swedish singer Anita Lindblom and her romance with boxer Bosse Högberg, to be played by Ola Rapace, the actress’ husband, whose been training as a boxer for this role four years (during the project’s long development stage). Their love affair often found its way to the tabloids. Of the project, Hardwicke told Screen: “”I immediately fell in love with the script [from Peter Birro] – it throws us back into Swedish celebrity culture of the 1960s, where the name is more important than the person.” Hardwicke calls Lindblom “glamourous” and Högberg “charismatic.” The project echos the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton love-affair-biopic we’re following.\n\nHelena Danielsson and Maria Dahlin of Hepp Films are producing, alongside Malte Forsell, of Garagefilm International, in collaboration with Nordisk Film (Lone Korslund), and Paradox Entertainment (Fredrik Malmberg, Gudrun Giddings). Scandinavian distribution in late 2012 will be handled by Nordisk Film. Shooting is slated for this fall.\n\nAmong Rapace’s other projects are Ridley Scott’s Prometheus (currently filming with Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba, Charlize Theron; out June 2012) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (in post, out December 16).\n\n[Image: Noomi and Ola Rapace, courtesy of Expose]"
