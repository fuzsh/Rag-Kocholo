        "text": "Though happily married, I’ve become infatuated with a rather dangerous young woman. She’s a Goth computer hacker with rings in her nose. She rides a motorcycle, and she’ll kick your teeth out if you get in her space. If you’re a guy.\n\nHer name is Lisbeth Salander, and we’ve just spent two frenzied weeks together, mostly at my kitchen table, but also on the train to and from work. I’m not alone. Lisbeth has about 50 million fans across the world.\n\nShe’s the heroine of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,” the first novel in “The Millennium Trilogy” written by the late Stieg Larsson. He was a Swedish journalist who finished his manuscripts and then died of a heart attack just before his novels became a worldwide publishing sensation.\n\nPoor guy. But that’s his problem. The problem for the rest of us is that Hollywood is making the movies based on the blockbuster “Nordic Noir” novels. And they’re already filming the first one, directed by David Fincher. Like many fans, I live in dread of what Hollywood will do to Lisbeth.\n\nWe don’t want Lisbeth Salander played by some Hollywood cutie with perfect teeth and skin like peaches who does Pilates. Salander smokes. She lives on coffee and frozen pizza. She hardly ever speaks. She hardly ever smiles. Besides, the perfect Salander is already on film. The “Millennium” movies were made in Sweden and released last year, starring the fine actress Noomi Rapace. Rapace does an excellent minimalist job with this fascinating feminist heroine who doesn’t compromise and who refuses to be a victim in a world where women are often brutally treated by men.\n\nSo why Hollywood wants to make its own “Millennium” series is beyond me. Maybe it has something to do with the gazillion dollars to be made after producers market those Lisbeth bisexual action figures for the Happy Meals. Or the Lisbeth lunch boxes and the Lisbeth mace canisters and body-piercing set.\n\nAfter devouring the books of the trilogy one after the other, I watched the first two Swedish movies back to back. You might say I’m borderline obsessed. But after all that scientific research, I conclude that the only actress to play Lisbeth is Noomi Rapace.\n\nSadly, the Hollywood version will star the porcelain-skinned Rooney Mara, who I’m sure is a fine actress, having just played in that angst-ridden picture about the origins of Facebook. But Salander isn’t your Facebook friend. She might hack into your computer and ruin your life if you aggravate her. But she’s not going to build cyberfarms with you or share photos of her bff or constantly update her “likes.” Rapace was supportive of Mara. “She has to find her Lisbeth inside of her own self, make her own personal Lisbeth,” Rapace told E! network.\n\nWell, my personal Lisbeth is you, Noomi. And most of us who’ve seen the Swedish movies agree.\n\nWhat worries Millennium fans is that this could be another example of bad Hollywood casting. Like the time Brad Pitt played the noble Achilles in the movie “Troy.” One look at Brad, simpering and pouting across the plain of Troy like some surfer with a bad hair weave, and countless audiences offered burnt offerings to almighty Zeus so that Hector would run him through.\n\nCenturies ago, moviegoers were assaulted by John Wayne as Genghis Khan. The idea of John Wayne leaving his yurt to lead his barbarians across Asia was simply too much. The actor who could have done a better job as Khan was Ricardo Montalban, but only if he’d been equipped with those plastic pectorals he used to terrifying effect in “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.”\n\nHollywood often ruins things when it remakes good foreign films. For example, the decent French flick “La Femme Nikita” was savaged by casting Bridget Fonda as the assassin and changing the title to “Point of No Return.” It was a terrible remake.\n\nThe list goes on. Ben Affleck as a CIA analyst. Michelle Pfeiffer as a Mafia wife. Jennifer Lopez as anything.\n\nJournalists who like “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” and the two other books probably wanted George Clooney or Johnny Depp to play Salander’s friend, the burned- out investigative reporter Mikael Blomkvist.\n\nInstead, Hollywood signed actor Daniel Craig, the buff 007, with his fancy martinis and his license to kill. Anyone out there ever see a devilishly handsome print journalist who is ripped and has that James Bond thing going? OK, I mean, besides me.\n\nActually, in the name of realism, Danny DeVito can play me anytime.\n\nRight now, we’re waiting for the real Lisbeth Salander.\n\nJohn Kass: jskass@tribune.com\n\nDenver Post columnist Tina Griego is on assignment."
