        "text": "The best statements tend to be genuine and specific from the very start. You'll be on the right track if you show your enthusiasm for the subject or course, your understanding of it, and what you want to achieve.\n\nAdmissions tutors – the people who read and score your personal statement – say don’t get stressed about trying to think of a ‘killer opening’. Discover the advice below and take your time to think about how best to introduce yourself.\n\nWe spoke to admissions tutors at unis and colleges – read on for their tips.\n\n1. Don't begin with the overkill opening\n\nTry not to overthink the opening sentence. You need to engage the reader with your relevant thoughts and ideas, but not go overboard.\n\nTutors said: ‘The opening is your chance to introduce yourself, to explain your motivation for studying the course and to demonstrate your understanding of it. The best personal statements get to the point quickly. Go straight in. What excites you about the course and why do you want to learn about it more?’\n\nBe succinct and draw the reader in, but not with a gimmick. This isn't the X Factor.\n\nAdmissions tutor\n\n2. Write about why you want to study that course\n\nThink about why you want to study the course and how you can demonstrate this in your written statement:\n\n’Your interest in the course is the biggest thing. Start with a short sentence that captures the reason why you’re interested in studying the area you’re applying for and that communicates your enthusiasm for it. Don't waffle or say you want to study something just because it's interesting. Explain what you find interesting about it.’\n\nIt's much better to engage us with something interesting, relevant, specific and current in your opening line… Start with what's inspiring you now, not what inspired you when you were six.\n\nAdmissions tutor\n\n3. Avoid cliches\n\nTry to avoid cliches and the most obvious opening sentences so you stand out from the very first line. UCAS publishes a list of common opening lines each year. Here are just some overused phrases to avoid using in your personal statement:\n\nFrom a young age…\n\nFor as long as I can remember…\n\nI am applying for this course because…\n\nI have always been interested in…\n\nThroughout my life I have always enjoyed…\n\nAnd try not to use quotes. Quotations are top of the list of admissions tutors' pet hates.\n\n4. Maybe don't begin at the start?\n\n’Concentrate on the main content of your statement and write the introduction last. I think the opening line is the hardest one to write, so I often say leave it until the end and just try and get something down on paper.’\n\nIt may be easier to get on with writing the main content of your statement and coming back to the introduction afterwards –that way you will also know what you’re introducing.\n\nI often advise applicants to start with paragraph two, where you get into why you want to study the course. That's what we're really interested in.\n\nAdmissions tutor"
