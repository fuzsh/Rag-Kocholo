        "text": "Day 5 of 30 Days OTP Challenge\n\n=====\n\nThe first time was pure accident.\n\nIt had happened in the middle of a mission. They’d been sent to take care of some troublesome bunch that had been messing around in Mafia territory. Other groups had been sent before them, but they were all unsuccessful. As a last resort, Mori had sent Dazai and Chuuya.\n\nThey finished the job in ten minutes.\n\n“I’m disappointed,” Chuuya said, kicking one of the fallen men in his way. “From the way Mori-san described these guys, I thought they’d be tougher.”\n\nDazai was inspecting the enemies’ bodies. “Me too,” he agreed, “which is why I think something is wrong. But I haven’t found anything of importance in my search.”\n\nChuuya crossed his arms in front of his chest. “Yeah? Then there’s nothing left to see. Let’s get out of here.”\n\nDazai stood, his frown an obvious sign of dissatisfaction. “This is strange,” he said as he made his way to Chuuya, “It’s too easy. Even Hirotsu-san’s team couldn’t take these guys down. But it only took us ten minutes. Why? Maybe they weren’t expecting us. There’s fewer men here than what was reported. Maybe their main force was out?” Dazai’s eyes widened. “Then –“\n\nThen came the ridiculous part.\n\nDazai tripped when he was within Chuuya’s reaching distance. Because his attention was elsewhere, he wasn’t prepared for it, so he stumbled forward and grabbed his partner’s shoulders for balance. But Chuuya wasn’t expecting that, so he lost his balance and they both fell.\n\nOf course, their lips had to meet. But it wasn’t sweet or warm or anything like people described, nor did it feel like time had stopped for them. No, they tumbled to the ground gracelessly, teeth knocking with a loud clack. Chuuya felt sharp pain on his bottom lip and realized that he had a split lip after tasting blood.\n\nAs much as Chuuya wanted to hit Dazai right then, he would have to wait, because a bullet whizzed past where Chuuya’s head had been just a moment ago. Chuuya cursed loudly and threw his partner off of him as a rain of bullets flew right at them. He could deal with Dazai after this.\n\nThe second time was a set-up of some sort.\n\nThe Port Mafia is a strange group. On the outside, they’re just a bunch of scary people who rule Yokohama’s underworld. On the inside, you’ll see many quirks of the members that make you go, “Oh, they’re humans too.”\n\nOne of the strange things of the Mafia is the men’s unusual fancy toward celebrating festivities, especially Christmas. Every December, a banquet would be held at the headquarters with all the members invited, except for those who are under 16. That’s not really the legal age for people to start drinking, but they’re the Mafia. They’ve broken many laws.\n\nBecause the upper echelons have a strange sense of humor, the attendees had to come in pairs. No outsider was allowed, so the choice was limited. Partners are recommended to come together because it would be more convenient.\n\nChuuya wasn’t sure what to feel about this arrangement. On one hand, he didn’t have to worry about asking someone out. On the other hand, he was stuck with Dazai as his companion for the evening. He couldn’t decide which was worse.\n\n“You should be happy, Chuuya,” Dazai said as they walked together to the banquet hall. “The girls were dying to be my date.”\n\nChuuya threw him a withering glare. “Shut it.” He pinched the bridge of his nose with a sigh. Honestly, he really didn’t want to attend this thing. It’s not that he had anything against Christmas, no, he liked it a lot. But he didn’t like milling in with people. And Dazai, gods. If Kouyou hadn’t specifically told him to come, he would’ve skipped out on this entirely.\n\nAt least there would be alcohol. Kouyou had guaranteed him this.\n\nDazai and Chuuya’s arrival was greeted with cheers from the attendees. Not used to the attention, Chuuya paused as he wondered if he should just continue on his way or greet everyone. Dazai was already doing the latter and waving energetically at the attendees.\n\nSomewhere among the people, Chuuya spotted Kouyou. She was smiling and pointing up. The ceiling? What’s on the ceiling? Chuuya looked up.\n\n“Oh hell no.”\n\n“What?” Dazai looked up too. “Oh.”\n\nMistletoe. Someone had hung mistletoe above the entrance. Dazai and Chuuya were standing underneath it.\n\n“Chuuya.”\n\n“No. Stay away from me.”\n\n“It’s a tradition.” Dazai grabbed Chuuya before the latter could escape. “Don’t blame me for this.”\n\nAnd then Dazai kissed him.\n\nIt was more a brush of lips than a kiss, actually. It lasted for only one second, which wasn’t enough time for Chuuya to decide if he liked it or not.\n\nThe attendees cheered again as the two of them broke away. Chuuya immediately took three steps back, mind reeling.\n\nDazai just kissed him.\n\nThe man in question already had his attention elsewhere. He was happily chatting up one of the older members whom Chuuya recalled seeing around Dazai a few times. Oda-something, if he remembered correctly.\n\nChuuya dragged a hand down his face and sighed. It was just a stupid kiss. Nothing important.\n\nThe third time was fully intentional on Dazai’s part.\n\nOn that particular day, Tachihara had approached Chuuya looking like a nervous wreck. Right when Chuuya was going to ask if he was okay, Tachihara blurted out loudly, “Chuuya-san, will you go out for a drink with me tonight?” and bowed.\n\nChuuya jumped and took half a step back. Tachihara had his eyes squeezed shut. His face was so red Chuuya was genuinely worried that his subordinate would pass out. “Tachihara, are you alright? Your face is really red.”\n\nTachihara turned redder, if that was even possible. “I’m perfectly fine. So, will you go out with me, Chuuya-san?”\n\nChuuya looked at Tachihara in concern, not quite believing his words but uncertain whether he should pursue the issue. In the end, he decided to drop it. He was free that evening, so he could go out with Tachihara. But he didn’t understand why his subordinate was so nervous about asking him out. It’s just a drink, isn’t it?\n\n“Yo, Chuuya, Tachihara-kun.” An arm was thrown across Chuuya’s shoulders. “What’s up?”\n\nChuuya growled and shrugged the arm off. “Dazai, I told you not to do that, you creep.”\n\nDazai faked being offended. “I’m not a creep,” he said. “Anyway, what are you guys doing?”\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, Chuuya saw Tachihara turn pale, but paid it no mind. “Tachihara was asking me to go out for a drink with him.”\n\n“Eh,” Dazai glanced at Tachihara. “Are you going?”\n\nChuuya shrugged. “Why not?”\n\n“This is why.”\n\nThat was all the warning Chuuya had before Dazai kissed him. This time it lasted long enough for Chuuya to feel it, but he was too stunned to do much more than let Dazai do as he pleased. Dazai’s lips were chapped but soft as they pressed against Chuuya’s. There was a hint of mint in it. Something Dazai ate earlier?\n\nAfter a moment, Dazai pulled away with a cheeky grin. “So, don’t go around on dates with other people, yeah?”\n\nChuuya could only blink stupidly as his partner ran off. “Huh?!” he exclaimed. “What do you mean by that?”\n\nBut Dazai was already gone by then. Tachihara’s wide-eyed look was really comical. When he noticed that Chuuya was looking at him, he made a strange sound and started blabbing excuses before running off too.\n\nChuuya remained rooted on the spot as he tried to make sense of the most recent events. Tachihara asked him out. Dazai interrupted and kissed him. Then Dazai told him not to go on dates with other people.\n\nOh, so Tachihara was asking Chuuya to go on a date with him. No wonder he was so nervous.\n\nBut why did Dazai tell him not to go around on dates with other people? Why did he have to kiss Chuuya?\n\nThe Port Mafia executive pinched the bridge of his nose. He’d better not read too deeply into Dazai’s words and actions, because he doesn’t understand that guy sometimes.\n\nExtra: The one time Chuuya kissed Dazai\n\nThe Christmas banquet wasn’t very interesting. Dazai found himself bored about one hour into the event. Chuuya had made it his mission to avoid Dazai like a plague for the rest of the evening, so he couldn’t bother the shorter male to get rid of his boredom.\n\nDazai sighed as he swayed the glass in his hand. It’s champagne, maybe. Or gin? He forgot. It was mostly to keep his hand occupied anyway.\n\nA voice came from behind him. “Dazai!”\n\nThe corners of Dazai’s lips curled into a smile. His source of entertainment had come to find him. He turned, smile widening upon seeing his partner. “Yo, Chuuya. Miss me?”\n\nThe flush on Chuuya’s cheeks and his unsteady stance were more than enough to show that he was drunk. “You,” Chuuya growled, “Why are you so infuriating?”\n\nMost of the Mafia were used to Chuuya’s drunk antics (which was interesting, because he was barely old enough to drink), so not many people bothered to look at them. Dazai grinned. “Me, infuriating? What makes you say that, Chuuya?”\n\nThat attracted the attention of some. Dazai could feel some heat rising up to his cheeks against his will. So he took Chuuya’s first kiss? He’d never really planned for that. After all, their first kiss had been an accident, but it gave him no small amount of pleasure to know that he was the first person to ever kiss Chuuya.\n\nMore people turned to them. Dazai could now feel himself blushing furiously. Drunk Chuuya’s honesty is really cute and all, but Dazai really didn’t know what to feel about him announcing their kisses for everyone to hear.\n\nFor the first time in a while, Dazai Osamu was speechless.\n\nDazai’s silence seemed to tick Chuuya off. “Why aren’t you saying anything, Mackerel?” Chuuya stomped toward Dazai and grabbed his collar to pull his face down. “Since you’ve kissed me twice, I have the right to kiss you now.”\n\nDazai blinked. Huh? What did he just say? Before he could fully make sense of Chuuya’s words, the shorter male had pulled him into a sloppy kiss. Chuuya tasted and smelled like liquor. He was also really bad at kissing. But Dazai found that he didn’t particularly mind those and started kissing back.\n\nWhen they finally pulled away, the room erupted in cheers and whistles. Neither of them paid the audience any mind.\n\n“Dazai,” Chuuya murmured, barely audible in the midst of the ruckus, “Don’t go around kissing other people, you hear me?”\n\nBefore Dazai could answer, Chuuya had collapsed against him and promptly started snoring into his shoulder. Laughter bubbled up Dazai’s chest as he finally regained his bearings.\n\nReally, Dazai thought as he picked Chuuya up and prepared to leave, his partner could be really unpredictable at times.\n\n=====\n\nI’m not lying\n\nThis is the first time I’ve ever written anyone doing anything beyond holding hands."
