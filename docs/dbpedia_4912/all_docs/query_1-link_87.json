        "text": "I acquired this game in early Feb when it first released, and I played it so much that I unlocked all the songs within 2 days of playing, but I was holding back just because I wanted to finish the ASAS review first before heading on to this. That’s right, Utapri’s back with another music game with another round of songs, this time trying to ruin your lives with more tricky beatmaps that you can’t seem to play even when you remember yourself almost perfecting a Pro mode on the last game on PSP, Music 2. Oh well, more details and rants about the game under the cut. Continue reading →\n\nAnd here I am with the fandisk to the All Star game of Utapri! In this game, we have both the senpais and the Kouhais, both which start of as Saotome’s announcement that they’re all gonna have new songs! Thus we follow on Haruka & her lover’s adventures of making a new song while they spend a good time together! For the content, Senpais continue after All Star, while Kouhais continue off from Debut where they are already longtime lovers. THE BOOTLEG STARISH ENDS DO NOT EXIST. I REPEAT. THEY DO NOT EXIST, Spoilers under the cut! Continue reading →\n\nAlmost about a year after debut, and 1 1/2 half year after the actual release of the game, here am I back with Utapri All Star! All Star covers the shitty senpais which shitted up debut by adding drama and they get routes cuz they’re ikemens. In this game, Haruka has made it through, Repeat. AA & SS and Debut WITHOUT A STARISH MAN! She has made it into the agency without the help of a Starish guy but she hasn’t debuted, and she’ll get booted if she doesn’t debut in 6 months. There comes Saotome, who offers her to compose the song for the new senpai unit Quartet Night for the Christmas party, and win in the Music Festival Competition by partnering up with them, and she has to win or else her contract will expire and she’ll be booted from the agency. Continue reading →\n\nOkay here goes my best attempt at trying to play the game called Amnesia, a series which has been heavily milked by our awful friend Otomate. Well enough about how bad the milk is, since this is only just the first game anyway. Our story is about a girl who loses her memories, and ends up in this weird realm seeing a boy named Orion. Turns out their souls clashed on 1st August, causing her memories to poof and fly away. So now orion’s job is to help her get back her memories, and she has to choose the world that she belongs to. Let’s get on our journey for the most dense, and most Mary-Sue heroine in the entire otome game universe!! Continue reading →\n\nMonths after playing the 2nd fandisk for all the dudes I”m back with another review for utapri!!! Basically means that I’m back to playing utapri again with more raburabu goodness. As per usual, I will be playing from my least favourite to most favourite, and no senpai/friend ends. ESPECIALLY THIS TIME BECAUSE THERE’S HOMO no thank you please I do not want a homo game.\n\nEitherway Haruka & her menz are ready to debut into show business when Saotome jumps out and tells them that they have to go to a Master Course to debut. They will also have to group with a senpai to earn the “brothers emblem” and some other medal, and also making a unit song together with the senpai. The guys end up moving in with their senpai leaving Haruka alone composing herself well dammit. Eitherway watch out for mad rage under the cut, that’s all. Continue reading →\n\nAt last, I’m finally reaching the end of Bloody Nightmare. Gullian’s route is only unlocked if you clear both ends for Rath, but he’s actually worthwhile doing so!! Gullian’s very violent, in a way where he wants to kill all his enemies, but he’s actually a ball of cute!! He’s pretty much like a kid every time, but his childishness actually makes him cute. Okay lets leave it at that and get on with the review, shall we? Continue reading →\n\nThis is the fandisk to Uta no Prince-sama which covers the A class boys and Cecil. Welp the S Class boys are busy filming a movie so you get to screw and have fun with the A Class ones~ Each route only has 4 Chapters and are all quite short. I played them according to my least favourite guy to most favourite.\n\nContinue reading →"
