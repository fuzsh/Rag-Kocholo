        "text": "JKA Female Karate-Ka And Competition Success\n\nAlthough the JKA Championships began in 1957, women did not compete in them until 1974 in the case of kata and 1985 for kumite. Similarly, The World Championships (which started in 1970 see separate note), only allowed women to compete in kata in 1980 and kumite in 1982.\n\nIt is very rare to see women compete in both kata and kumite competitions and there have been no Grand Champion female competitors in the JKA-run All Japan Championships.\n\nAll Japan JKA Kata Champions\n\nIn the 45+ year history of these competitions, only 15 names appear as winners. The most successful are shown below.\n\nSensei Kobayashi won the first kata competition in 1974; Saito (Toshiko) won in 1975.\n\nSensei Kawashima won this kata competition 7 times from 1976 to 1982, and the 2nd & 3rd IAKF in 1977 and 1980.\n\nSensei Nakamura (Yoko) is by far the most successful JKA competitor, having won this 9 times – 1984-1987 & 1992-1996; plus the Shoto Cup four times (1985, 1992, 1994 & 1996).\n\nSensei Mimura won from 1988-1991 (plus the 3rd Shoto Cup in 1990) AND the World Championships four times 1988, 1990, 1992 & 1996. She was coached by Nakayama Mei (of Shito-ryu, see World Championship Females).\n\nSensei Nakata dominated every year from 2000 to 2004, and won the 8th and 9th Shoto Cup.\n\nSensei Oshima won 2007, 2008 2010 and 2011, and the 12th Funakoshi Cup in 2011.\n\nSensei Nakamachi won in 2012, 2013 and 2014, as well as the 13th Funakoshi Cup in 2014.\n\nSensei Nakamura (Ayano) won the past 4 years (2016-2019 & 14th Funakoshi Cup in 2017).\n\nAll Japan JKA Kumite Champions\n\nThe 34+ year history of kumite is dominated by a limited number (19) of names, for example:\n\nSensei Hasama (Yuko) won the first kumite competition in 1985 (and the 3rd Shoto Cup in 1990), and the 9th & 10th WKF Championships.\n\nSensei Saito (Rika) won the JKA kumite championship in 1986.\n\nSensei Kono won four times in 1987, 1988 & 1992, 1993.\n\nSensei Yoneda won 3 times 1989-1991 (plus the 4th Shoto Cup in 1992).\n\nSensei Hasama (Hiromi) won five times: 1994 & 1997-2000 (as well as the 5th, 6th and 8th Shoto Cups in 1994, 1996 and 2000) plus the 14th & 15th WKF Championships (1998 & 2000).\n\nSensei Okuie won the kumite 4 times : 2005 & 2007-2009 (as well as the 9th Shoto Cup in 2004). She is a JKA 5th Dan.\n\nSensei Shiina won 3 times: 2011,2015,2016(+14th Funakoshi Cup in 2017). A JKA 4th Dan.\n\nThe most recent winner (2019) was Sensei Sugimoto, who also won in 2017.\n\nJKA National Kata Champions - YouTube\n\nSensei Kawashima Hiromi\n\nChinte, 1982: https://ne-np.facebook.com/Bushidokarateshotokanbr/videos/1426206987538846/\n\nSensei Nakamura (Yoko)\n\nEmpi & Unsu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moH2ZFakJQo\n\nJapan women’s kata 1995: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4CBhxRA5U4\n\nSensei Mimura Yuki\n\n1988 Kata Unsu (4 minutes in): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP9LNU1wmRY\n\nKata Unsu, 1995: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mr9e-l2nQY\n\nKata Kanku dai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnPxzgfa8Lg\n\nSensei Oshima Nozomi\n\n12th Gichin Funakoshi Cup in 2011: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgj79du3190\n\nSensei Nakamachi Miki\n\nHeian Nidan, Kanku Dai & Sochin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOXT1W2iF9I\n\nSensei Nakamura (Ayano)\n\n14th Shoto Cup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB0OIpcD_0U\n\nJKA National Kumite Champions - YouTube\n\nSensei Hasama (Yuko)\n\n10th WKF final: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Paro6FNLS0s\n\nSensei Yoneda Yukiko\n\n4th Shoto Cup, 1992: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb9Qm59RS3g\n\nSensei Hasama (Hiromi)\n\n5th Shoto Cup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I662fSyNTwg\n\nSensei Okuie Satomi\n\nThe 9th Shoto Cup, 2004: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h5RfW-LycY\n\nSensei Shiina Mai\n\nThe 14th Funakoshi Cup in 2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGAI4CBHp-I\n\nSensei Sugimoto Risa\n\n2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U30riAHEotg\n\nFemale JKA Kumite And Kata Competition Winners 1974-2019\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia\n\nJKA website http://www.jka.or.jp\n\nFemale Karate-Ka: World Championships (WKF)\n\nWorld Championships are run by the World Karate Federation (WKF). They started in 1970 but only allowed women to compete in kata in 1980 and kumite in 1982. There are many other competitions, e.g. JKF All Japan Championships, but these are not covered here.\n\nIt is very rare to see women compete in both kata and kumite competitions and therefore there are no Grand Champion female competitors. And by its nature, a large proportion of WKF successful competitors has been non-Japanese.\n\nKata Champions\n\nSensei Okamura(-Hamazaki) Suzuka (Goju-ryu)\n\nOkamura holds a special place in tournament karate history. She was the first Women’s World Champion in kata in 1980 and ushered in a dominance of the kata event by Japanese women that lasted from 1980 to 2004. She began Goju-ryu at age 6 under her father, who was a direct student of Gogen Yamaguchi.\n\nOkumura’s other major honours include: World Games – Individual kata – 1st place (1981) and All Japan Goju-ryu Championships – Individual kata – 1st place (1981, 1982).\n\nOkamura’s book, “My Life with Karate-Do” was published in 2011.\n\nSensei Nakayama Mei (Shito-ryu, Inoue-ha)\n\nNakayama can be considered one of the greatest kata competitors, male or female, of all time. A three-time consecutive world champion, she is ranked in many top ten lists of the best ever Karate competitors. Her signature kata is Nipaipo. One of the Karate world’s most prominent women, she has successfully made the transition from competitor to coach. Some of her students have also gone on to become world champions. She began training at age 18 and, like Okamura and Usami (see below), was trained by Inoue Yoshimi (founder of the Inoue style).\n\nFrom 1982 to 1987 Mie Nakayama was the most dominant force in women’s kata. Her major honours include:\n\nWorld Championships – Individual kata – 1st place (1982, 1984, 1986)\n\nWorld Championships- Individual kata – 2nd place (1980)\n\nWorld Games – Individual kata – 1st place (1985)\n\nWorld Games – Individual kata – 2nd place (1981)\n\nWorld Cup – Individual kata – 1st place (1987)\n\nHayashi-Ha Shito-ryu World Champions – Individual kata – 1st place (1982 – 1987)\n\nSensei Mimura Yuki (Shotokan, JKA)\n\nFollowing on from Okamura and Nakayama, Mimura was the next great female Japanese kata champion. Like her predecessor, Nakayama, she was the winner of three consecutive World titles, plus World Games and World Cup titles. See JKA Female Karate-ka.\n\nSensei Yokoyama Hisami (Shito-ryu)\n\n1st in the1994 and 2nd place in the 1988 and 1990 WKF kata Championships\n\nSensei Wakai Atsuko (Goju-ryu)\n\nOne of the greatest of the Japanese champions was Atsuko Wakai, the only woman to win four consecutive world kata titles (earning her an entry in the Guinness Book of Records and making her one of the most dominant world champions, male or female at that time).\n\nAged only four years she was involved in a serious car accident. She was hospitalized for four months after suffering head injuries. The accident also affected her nervous system, which led to coordination problems. Her parents believed that studying karate would help strength and co-ordination. At the age of six Wakai began studying Seigokan Goju-ryu Karate under Yasufumi Ono.\n\nWakai’s major honours include:\n\nWorld Championships – Individual kata – 1st place (1998, 2000, 2002, 2004)\n\nWorld Games – Individual kata – 1st place (1997, 2001, 2005)\n\nWorld Cup – Individual kata – 1st place (1997)\n\nAsian Karate Championships – 1st place (1997, 1999, 2001, 2004)\n\nAsian Games – Individual kata – 1st place (1998, 2002)\n\nAll Japan Karate-Do Championships – Individual kata – 1st place (1997-2004)\n\nSensei Usami Rika (Shito-ryu, Inoue-ha) (b. 1986)\n\nAt the age of 12 Usami took part in her first tournament as a green belt. She won her first major honour, the Junior World Championship, at the age of 17, eventually becoming a student of Sensei Inoue.\n\nHer major honours include:\n\nFirst place – WKF Junior World Championship (2005) Limassol, Greece\n\nFirst place – All-Japan National Championship (2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012)\n\nThird place – WKF World Championship (2010) Belgrade, Serbia\n\nFirst place – Paris Open (2011)\n\nFirst place – Asian Games (2011) Quanzhou, China\n\nFirst place – Salzburg Open (2011)\n\nFirst place – Paris Open (2012)\n\nFirst place – Dordrecht Open (2012)\n\nFirst place – Jakarta Open (2012)\n\nFirst place – Istanbul Open (2012)\n\nFirst place – World Championship (2012)\n\nIn answer to the question “What is your message for everyone who aspires to achieve your high skill level in kata?”, she replied:\n\n“Everyone has a goal. Whether that is to become a world champion or not doesn’t really matter. Although your goal may often look hard to achieve at first, if you continually make efforts toward your goal, then your time, energy and commitment will never have been wasted. So, keep it up as much as you can. Stay strong until you win against yourself. And at the end of the day, you will always be the winner.”\n\nSensei Shimizu Kiyou\n\nShe won the 2014 and 2016 WKF Championships, and came second in 2018 to Sensei Sanchez of Spain. She will represent Japan at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nSensei Sanchez (Sandra) (b. 1981)\n\nWinner of the 2018 WKF, she will represent Spain at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nShe first stepped on a Tatami mat at four years of age but even had to fight to get that far; she was brought to ballet classes as a little girl while her brother Paco did karate. \"My brother was two years older than me and if he wanted to do something, then so did I, if he could do something then I thought, so can I!\" Sandra cried so hard that the Sensei told her parents: \"let her try it for a week until she stops crying and gets over the tantrum.\" She never did.\n\nAfter a degree in sports science in Madrid, Sanchez left to work in Australia, but while she was getting away from home, there was no getting away from karate. She continued training and teaching extra karate classes in a school in Brisbane, but something kept calling her back.\n\nShe knew that to fulfil her dream she needed to focus 100% and train full-time, and moved back to the family home near Madrid with one clear goal: to convince near-mythical kata master and internationally renowned trainer Jesus del Moral to train and believe in her. Sensei Del Moral declined. Then he said no again. And again. And again. And again.\n\nSanchez started going to Del Moral's gym in central Madrid every single day to train and persuade Del Moral that even though she was already in her thirties and struggling with money, support and sponsorship, that she had what it takes to make it as a kata champion. And that she wouldn't quit. Ever. \"You don't know me\", Sanchez challenged the great teacher. Del Moral couldn't keep saying no forever. He drew up the first training schedule that included a shock - he expected her to train on January 1st. Sanchez thought it was a mistake, or a joke. He told her \"Winners train on January 1st, losers stay in bed”.\n\nThis new training program and Sandra's application to it was an instant success. She became national champion at her first attempt after she began training under Sensei Del Moral.\n\nTold time and time again that she was too old and it'd never happen for her, Sanchez refused to listen and found her path to the podium. \"Of course I had my moments of doubt, I have my little heart too, particularly when people in the world of karate that I respected told me that I was good, but not good enough to win nationals or a world championship.\"\n\nThe fact that her success came relatively late in life means the 37-year-old is enjoying every moment. Even if she won gold at Tokyo, \"I'll never stop doing karate, it's made me who I am and helps me to grow and improve as a person every day.”\n\nHer major honours include:\n\nFirst place – WKF (2018)\n\nBronze medal winner (2016)\n\nFive times European Champion (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019)\n\nEuropean Games Champion, Minsk, 2019\n\nFive times Spanish Champion (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019)\n\nKumite Champions\n\nSensei Hasama (Yuko) of the JKA won the 9th & 10th WKF Championships (1988, 1990) in the under 53kg category (see JKA Female Karate-ka).\n\nBritish karate-ka Senseis Molley Samuel and Juliet Toney won the 11th and 13th WKF Championships respectively.\n\nSensei Hasama (Hiromi) of the JKA won the 14th & 15th WKF Championships (1998, 2000) in the under 53kg category (see JKA Female Karate-ka).\n\nSensei Araga Tomoko (b 1985) won the 17th & 18th WKF Championships (2004, 2006) in the under 53kg category.\n\nSensei Uekusa Ayumi (b 1992) won the 23rd WKF Championships (2016) in the above 68kg category.\n\nSensei Miyahara Miho (b 1996) is the most recent Japanese winner in kumite, winning gold in the WFK 2018 under 50kg category.\n\nFemale Karate-Ka: World Championships (WKF) - YouTube\n\nKata Champions\n\nNakamura-Hamasaki Suzuko Recent Interview (first 7 minutes): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDtGHINAl0Q\n\nSensei Nakayama Mei\n\nKata Nipaipo 1987: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pJ_Kt136dM\n\nSame Kata 2007: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FGvzsIEtUA\n\nSensei Yokoyama Hisami Kata Chatan Yara Kusanku: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y-Sr7QaiA4\n\nSensei Rika Usami\n\nInterview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPdp-BkCUlw\n\n2012 WKF Final: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JBOfJB8mw\n\n2012 WKF Final: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiiznDpoapQ\n\nKata Bassai Dai instructional: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIUUr9wxH8c\n\nDominoes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBpG58ngj0M\n\nSensei Shimizu Kiyou vs Sensei Sanchez (Sandra) of Spain 2019 Kata finals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eab4_Uk1Yl4\n\nTop 10 kata champions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdSRq_pH7nc\n\nKumite Champions\n\nSensei Toney (Juliet), UK (1995): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLgSitxGgr4\n\nSensei Tomoko Araga (2008): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7875dmY_tY\n\nSensei Uekusa Ayumi (2019): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TwLI4PmKn4\n\nSensei Miyara Miho (vs Recchia of France, 2016 WKF): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHXJ_06ouDU\n\nJKA Male Karate-Ka And Competition Success (1988-present)\n\nThe JKA Championships between 1957 and 1987 have already been covered.

He was coached by Sensei Sakamoto (see above).\n\nWKF Kumite Champions\n\nThe individual kumite winners in this period were varied, with no one country or person dominating.\n\nIn the 1980s, the key British winners were:\n\nGeoff Thompson MBE (80kg+ weight category, 1982).\n\nJim Collins (70kg, 1983).\n\nVic Charles MBE (80kg+ 1986).\n\nTim Stephens (65kg, 1988).\n\nAbdu Shaher (60kg, 1988).\n\nWayne Otto OBE (kumite open sanbon, 1990 & 75kg, 1996).\n\nOther Noteworthy Champions\n\nApart from the JKA-run All Japan Championships (and Shoto Cup etc), and the WKF-run World Championships, there are many other competitions: KUGB National Championships, European Championships, World Games, and many Open competitions, to name a few.\n\nThere have been some exceptional French and British champions and fighters of note:\n\nDomique Valera (b 1947) of France was awarded his 1st Dan in February 1964 by Hiroo Mochizuki (son of Minoru Mochizuki) after four years of training. He is arguably Europe’s best-known Karate competitor from the 1960s and 1970s, dominating the tournament scene of the era. Fighting as a heavyweight, he was a multiple French and European champion and held in high regard by other fighters of the era, such as Ticky Donovan. His ashi-barai (leg sweep) technique would eventually become one of his signature moves.\n\nHe was also one of the first European karate-ka to make the successful transition to full-contact Karate (in 1976).\n\nTicky Donovan OBE (b. 1947) began his training in 1965 with Sensei Suzuki (Wado-ryu) and then with Senseis Kanazawa and Enoeda, then with Sensei Arneil (Kyokushin-kai). He received his 2nd Dan from Kyokushin-kai founder Sensei Oyama and in 1973 he developed his own style Ishin-ryu (not the same as the Okinawan style of Isshin-ryu).\n\nAs a competitor he won the British Karate Championship, at the time considered one of the toughest tournaments in Europe, three years in a row (1973-1975) and at the WKF Championships in 1975 he was part of the winning All Styles Karate squad (coached by Steve Arneil).\n\nIn 1977 Donovan became the coach and manager of both the English and British teams and between 1982 and 1996 Donovan’s teams won a total of fifty-three medals, twenty-three being gold. He has coached some of the best British talent (see above): Pat McKay, Geoff Thompson, Vic Charles, Wayne Otto, Molly Samuel and Aidan Trimble (see below).\n\nHe served on the board of the EKF between 2008-2013.\n\nAidan Trimble (b 1960) began training in 1972 and was awarded is 1st Dan by Sensei Asano (of Kanazawa’s SKIF) in 1977. He is one of the best British kumite competitors and became the SKIF’s first World Champion in 1983. He formed his own association, the FSK, in 1986.\n\nDave Hazard (b 1952) began training in 1969 at the Blackfriar’s dojo, with Senseis Enoeda and Kato. He joined the KUGB and was awarded 1st Dan in 1972. In 1977 he trained in the JKA’s Instructors’ Class, training with some of the top JKA instructors (Kanazawa, Abe, Yahara, Tanaka, Asai, Osaka) and was awarded 3rd Dan by Sensei Nakayama. He is head of his own association, Academy of Shotokan Karate.\n\nKUGB Senior Instructors\n\nAndy Sherry (b. 1943) was a pioneer of Shotokan Karate in the United Kingdom. He joined the BKF in 1961 and trained with Vernon Bell in London. He was awarded 1st Dan in 1966 by Sensei Enoeda and graded to 2nd Dan (along with Eddie Whitcher) in 1967. From 1967 to 1970 he won the KUGB Championships kata title four times and the kumite title twice. He eventually retired from active competition in 1977.\n\nHe then became coach and manager of the KUGB National Team which, with superb karate-ka like Frank Brennan, he led to victory at the 1990 World Shotokan Karate Championships. His team defeated a JKA team that contained the likes of Masao Kagawa. The feat was repeated the following year and in 2007 under his guidance the England Squad won European and World titles.\n\nIn 1970 Sherry became the first man in Britain to be awarded a JKA 3rd Dan by Sensei Enoeda and is currently ranked 9th Dan.\n\nTerry O’Neill (b 1948) started training in 1963 and was awarded 1st Dan in 1966 by Sensei Enoeda. Between 1967 to 1980 he won seven KUGB kata finals and four KUGB kumite finals: he was KUGB Grand Champion on three occasions. He was part of the All Styles Kumite team (along with Ticky Donavan) that won the WKF team kumite championships in 1975. He is ranked 8th Dan.\n\nFrank Brennan (b 1960) is one of the most technically gifted karate-ka of his generation, winning many kumite and kata titles in the 1980s and 1990s. Masahiko Tanaka (JKA), once said that part of the Japanese team’s training strategy was how to beat Brennan.\n\nHis honours include:\n\nJKA World Championships (2nd Shoto Cup) - Individual kumite – 2nd place (1987)\n\n(1st place went to Imamura)\n\nJKA World Championships (3rd Shoto Cup) - Team kumite – 1st place (1990)\n\nJKA World Championships (3rd Shoto Cup) - Individual kata – 2nd place (1990)\n\n(1st place went to Aihara)\n\nJKA World Championships (4th Shoto Cup) - Individual kumite – 2nd place (1992)\n\n(1st place went to Imamura – see Youtube section)\n\nWSKA World Championships – Individual kata – 1st place (1991)\n\nWSKA World Championships – Team Kumite – 1st place (1991)\n\nWSKA World Championships – Individual kumite – 3rd place (1991)\n\nEuropean Kata Champion – 3 times\n\nEuropean Kumite Champion – 3 times\n\nKUGB National Kata Champion – 14 times\n\nKUGB National Kumite Champion – 10 times\n\nHe retired from active competition in 1993.\n\nOther seniors include Bob Poynton (1949-2020), Billy Higgins (b 1945) and Bob Rhodes (b 1946).\n\nWKF (and Other) Male Karate-Ka and Competition Success - YouTube\n\nKata Champions\n\nSensei Sakamoto Kata Anan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SugmDuEwhzo\n\nSensei Milon Kata Unsu 1996 WKF winner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZKsYV22ryM\n\nSensei Valdesi\n\nKata Gankaku (2010): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb8jVEpH1xc\n\nKata Empi (2012): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsByJxZZBGk\n\nSensei Diaz Kata Anan Dai (2019) 3 minutes in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6MN_lM8h6o\n\nSensei Kiyuna Kata Anan (2016): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYCyB1a8sy4\n\nKumite Champions"
