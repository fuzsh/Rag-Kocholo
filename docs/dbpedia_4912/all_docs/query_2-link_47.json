        "text": "Requested by squad3taichou\n\n~\n\nHaving an anime crush is a normal thing for him, usually the looks could only be found in 2D world. Going to anime convention, yes he could see them, wearing his ideal girl's costume. But they only have the looks not the personality and ability. Also, he wanted natural looks, not from make-ups and wigs. His ideal girl's personalities and abilities could be seen in schools, or gyms, but not with the looks.\n\nFor him, he wanted to meet someone with the looks, and of course along with the personality, and ability. A sporty girl, who wear her hair short, who could make him smile being just with her, and of course cheering him up. An innocent mind and reckless actions.\n\nBut as people found out his ideal girl, they eventually told him to date Hinata Shouyou. But he rarely see this kind of person, not once in his life. And, Hinata Shouyou was a character in anime, and was a male.\n\n~\n\nIshikawa Kaito was walking on a street in Tokyo with his senpais Murase Ayumu, Nishiyama Koutarou and Ono Kenshou. They were heading towards Kenshou's place.\n\n\"Good thing we four don't have work today\" Ayumu excitedly said as he was walking beside Kenshou.\n\n\"Let's hurry up and play games in Kenshou-san's place!\" Nishiyama added who was walking behind the two of them, beside Ishikawa.\n\nIshikawa remained silence and just listened to the three talking.\n\nAs they were about to turn right, they all froze up, and back out as someone wearing a black jeans and black zip-up jacket landed in front of them. The person looked at them in surprised and hurriedly stood up.\n\n\"Kenshou-nii?!\"\n\n\"(F/N)?!\" Kenshou called, and it was revealed that Kenshou know the person, and it was a girl. \"What are you doing here?!\"\n\n(F/N) was about to answer when they heard voices approaching them. She took off the hoodie of her jacket, revealing her face clearly, and she was wearing a black and white cap. The four were surprised when she suddenly unzip her jacket in front of them. Underneath her jacket was a pink printed shirt. She wore her jacket inside out, showing the white side of her jacket. She also took off her cap, revealing her long (h/c) hair. She shook her head to fix it, and immediately put the cap on Kensho's bag.\n\nShe smiled and her appearance really changed in which the three were surprised and dumbfounded, except for Kensho.\n\n\"(F/N) did you do anything again?\" Kenshou asked suspiciously. She blinked innocently as four male college students appeared in front of them\n\n\"Did you see a guy wearing a black jeans with black jacket?\"\n\n\"He was wearing his hoodie too!\"\n\nThe four hastily asked, catching their breath. Ishikawa, Murase, and Nishiyama looked at each other, asking to who should answer\n\n\"He passed us a while ago and went straight there then turned left\" Kensho answered pointing behind them\n\n\"Thank you! Let's go!\" They said and hurriedly left.\n\nThe four looked at (F/N) who amazingly transformed in front of them.\n\n\"Then Kenshou-nii, who are these three?\" She asked as if nothing happened, tying her hair up, waiting for their answer \"seiyuu buddies?\"\n\nKenshou nodded and introduced them to her \"and this is (L/N) (F/N), my neighbor and also my cousin\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you!\" She excitedly greeted them \"I'm (L/N) (F/N)!\" She introduced, getting her cap on Kenshou's bag, and put it back on her head"
