I don't know a lot of japanese so I wont come up with a name but it will have Baten in it. No card mechanic, that's your action game.\n\nIn all seriousness, now that ToTK is coming out, I wonder what the staff that was on that game will do, move to their next project or supp other games?\n\nInstro\n\nLike Like\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#856\n\nNot surprised that TotK was the action game. Been saying that for years. The recruitment sites for the \"action game\" and for Zelda were listing the same job postings.\n\nProbably safe to assume that production unit 2 will also be working on Zelda DLC. Meanwhile Koh Kojima and whoever else didn't work on Future Reconnected have probably been in planning and early dev for Xeno-something.\n\nDark Cloud\n\nWarpstar Knight\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#857\n\nThat old man who told me he had contacts in Monolith years ago said they told him they weren’t making any new action game and it was just for recruitment.\n\nKartina\n\nTHE PROCESS WON\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/him\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#858\n\nLet's add the monolith switch action game to the list of monolith games that never existed and were only concept arts together with the 3ds game and I think another game for the wiiU, we should just stop hyping non existent games based on concept arts and recruitment arts.\n\nCan't wait for xenoblade 4.\n\nDark Cloud\n\nWarpstar Knight\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#859\n\nWell I’ll take XCX remaster now after this sad interpretation.

Paying another company to make a sequel to with such a small fanbase? This isn’t a Bayonetta situation where it brings something to Nintendo that they don’t have.\n\nThey are his games though. If Nintendo is at all involved, which seems reasonable given that their copyright is listed on the game page, it seems likely that he would have some involvement as well.\n\nThat said, people are making a big assumption about him moving back to Tokyo, when it could have nothing to do with game dev. Or his position at Kyoto was always intended to be temporary.\n\nAlso worth noting that he was heavily involved in the original Xenosaga, and did concept work for Xenoblade. If the brain trust has been working out where to head next with the Xeno series, I could imagine him having some significant involvement.\n\nLast edited: May 5, 2023\n\npachamelon\n\nRattata\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#870\n\nDoes anyone keep track of the people at Monolith Soft who don't appear in any game, now that the credits of Zelda have been seen?\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#871\n\nYeah I think someone brought that up a while ago, but maybe it was just a general set of jobs.\n\nWe don't have the graphics section yet, so if Monolith devs aren't on UI, then it still makes another title likely. At the very least, some of the Xenoblade leads have been up to something else since last year and potentially as far back as 2020.\n\nI think it's only logical that Xenoblade leads missing from FR moved on to the next game in that saga while a \"B-team\" completed FR.\n\nOf course that doesn't disprove the existence of an action game.\n\nAoiHana\n\nNINTENDOOMED\n\nPronouns\n\nShe/they\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#872\n\nSo TotK credits are partially out and there's good news and bad news.\n\nThe bad news is that this is the \"action game\" that Andrzej Zamoyski was working on. Well it's great for him lol. Hiroshi Ando worked on it too.\n\nThe good news is that none of the absent staff I mentioned in the Future Redeemed post are here except for maybe Shigekazu Yamada and Mamoru Ohta, as the full credits haven't been posted on Kyoto Report yet.\n\nDid Honne show up anywhere? He’s the big mystery with respect to “what Monolith Soft might do next” right now.\n\nSlightly disappointed Zamoyski seems to have been working on TOTK all along, but I always figured that was a possibility. In hindsight, his previous experience being level design probably should have tipped us off.\n\nEDIT: So apparently Honne is credited under “Special Thanks” for TOTK, which is interesting. IIRC he doesn’t show up in XC3’s credits at all, so while it’s possible he’s just running Monolith Tokyo’s PG2, this also means he hasn’t had a full credit since like… Xenoblade 2 or thereabouts? That’s quite a while to not have been doing any non-Special Thanks stuff. We’ll see if he shows up in the credits for the Baten Kaitos remasters.\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#873\n\nDoes anyone keep track of the people at Monolith Soft who don't appear in any game, now that the credits of Zelda have been seen?\n\nNobody, even Shingo Kawabata who wasnt credited seince Xenoblade X in 2015 worked on TOTK\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#874\n\nthis was very weird, the blue bar is the xenoblade 3 staff,a lot of staff didnt work\n\nmonolith more than doubled it size and xenoblade 3 wasnt that much bigger than 2,it made sense that another project was in development because we supposed that TOTK would take from monolith a team of the same size as BOTW, but it ended being several times bigger,while 50-60 devs from monolith worked on BOTW i counted over 130 developers from monolith on TOTK\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#875\n\nthis was very weird, the blue bar is the xenoblade 3 staff,a lot of staff didnt work\n\nmonolith more than doubled it size and xenoblade 3 wasnt that much bigger than 2,it made sense that another project was in development because we supposed that TOTK would take from monolith a team of the same size as BOTW, but it ended being several times bigger,while 50-60 devs from monolith worked on BOTW i counted over 130 developers from monolith on TOTK\n\nI'll look over TotK's credits eventually but it might be a while since I still haven't checked the credits of Future Redeemed.

I remember that being Monolith’s principal involvement in BOTW (though they were also brought onto that project much later, with TOTK it seems they were working with Nintendo from the start.)\n\nEither way, I doubt most people missing from a Xenoblade project are working on TOTK. I think after this info we sadly have to conclude the action game probably isn’t real (but never say never…), but it’s probably a fair assumption to say that PG1 has started pre-planning on… whatever comes next for the Xenoblade series. (Xenoblade X2 please be real.)\n\nN75\n\nLike Like\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#879\n\nYeah, Kojima and Mamoru Ohta not working on Future Redeemed/ along with Genki Yokota not directing on the EPD side means that something else from PG1 has been in the works since at least last year. That isn't surprising, but Yamada not being credited since DE in 2020 is another oddity.\n\nWe know that Xenoblade 3 started pre-production after 2 and then entered full production as soon as Torna was finished. The difference is that Kojima/Yokota/etc. stayed on. It makes me wonder how far along the next PG1 game is.\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\n#880\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nHidemaro Fujibayashi\n\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR\n\nYuya Sato\n\nGAME DESIGN\n\nYohei Fujino\n\nYasutaka
