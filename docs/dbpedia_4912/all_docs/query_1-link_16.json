        "text": "FIVE MUST VISIT DOJOS IN JAPAN\n\nEvery Budo practitioner ultimately should aspire to visit Japan at least once in their life, the place where their art was born or perhaps inspired. The physical surroundings, historical background and even the climate at certain dojos could have very well influenced some characteristics in the arts practiced today. Regardless of one’s style, there are certain dojos that exude a special aura, making them worth a visit or even better; having a practice session in them.\n\nHere is a selection of some of our favourite must visit dojos around Japan.\n\nRemember, etiquette is very important in Japan and specially in Budo. This isn’t a tourist guide.\n\nPeople will be very happy to welcome you but contact the dojo before visiting.\n\nTENRI UNIVERSITY JUDO DOJO\n\nLocated in Nara Prefecture and founded in 1925, Tenri Daigaku is almost synonymous to Judo in Japan as the university’s founder Shozen Nakayama. Tenri Daigaku supported the movement to introduce Judo as an official Olympic event in the 1964 Olympic Games held in Tokyo.\n\nThe Judo program at Tenri, as the university is commonly known has been home to one of the most powerful teams in Japan. They have won a total of 11 national university Judo championships and the Judo dojo of Tenri Dai has produced many Olympians like the legendary Nomura Tadahiro as well as current superstar Shohei Ono.\n\nThe current dojo was completed in 1978, displaying an impressive 760m training area. Many international teams visit the university and hold their training camps there as well as cross-train with the local team; for instance, in 2017 when the revered France Judo Union visited.\n\nFeeling pumped? Thinking of joining the guys for training? Well, hopefully you had a light breakfast, as the average program is 10 randoris of 6 minutes, followed by ne-waza (8 randoris of 3 minutes), or a motodachi of 10 randoris of 2 minute (the later being a trademark Tenri warm up). The tatami in the Tenri University Dojo is world famous. It boasts six surfaces, two of which are still the traditional types made of braided rice straw, watered before the start of each training session. Two others are also made of rice straw but synthetic. Tatami mats are as hard as wood and believe it or not are laid on large springs!\n\nThe university’s philosophy is closely linked to the beliefs of the Tenrikyo religion, a belief that is based on asceticism and stripping. When visiting Tenri’s Judo Dojo, you will feel this philosophy reflected in the physical structure of the building as well as in the hardcore training sessions that take place inside.\n\nHOW TO GET THERE\n\nTenri University is located in the Nara basin, just an hour by train from both Osaka and Kyoto, using either Japan Railways or the Kintetsu Railways, followed by a quick 8 min bus ride.\n\nSHORINJI KEMPO HOMBU DOJO\n\nAs you come out from the Japan Railways station of Tadotsu-eki, in Shikoku, you will be welcomed by a giant sign reminding you that you have reached the birth town of Shorinji Kempo.\n\nCarry on for 15 minutes on foot and you will arrive at the mighty red gate of the global headquarters of Shorinji Kempo.\n\nFounded in Japan in 1947 by So Doshin, Shorinji Kempo is a way of developing individuals, largely based on Buddhist practises, hence why this dojo known as Kanjo Zengaku Shosendaji, is considered a sanctuary rather than just a training facility. As you pass the main entrance, a beautiful green lawn spreads all over, contrasting perfectly with the red and gold of the main hall. In the centre of the garden, the statue of the founder stands distinctly, watching and welcoming visitors.\n\nThe first Dojo was built by the founder in his house in a six-tatami room, and after years and several relocations is currently at Toryo Park in Kagawa. The Hombu Dojo has been transformed into a complete structure, housing the Hondo or main Dojo where most of the physical training takes place. Its wide space so seamlessly amplifies the sound and energy of the practitioners.\n\nThe facility also includes a Kodo or lecture hall, where the bones and ashes of Doshin So are buried and a Zenrin Gakuen or research centre, where students from all over the world come to train.\n\nHOW TO GET THERE\n\nFrom Tokyo take the Tokaido · Sanyo Shinkansen towards Okayama, then on local train to Takashi Tsutsu Station, then it’s a 15 - 20 minutes’ walk (about 1km) to the Dojo.\n\nKASHIMA JINGU KYUDO DOJO\n\nKashima-jingu Shrine is one of the oldest shrines in eastern Japan. Located in the centre of Kashima, it is believed to have been built during the 6th century B.C. by Japan's first emperor.\n\nFilled with many smaller shrines and historical sites, one will also find a special site for martial arts practices here.\n\nKashima Jingu has a deep connection with martial arts (check our guide to sacred Budo places in Japan) and lately has become a popular “power spot” for Japanese people looking to tap into mystical energies at traditional temples.\n\nThis amazing Dojo gives you the chance to feel for yourself the ‘way of the bow’. The Kyudo Dojo has a history of over 60 years. Wonderfully filled with silence surrounded by a Shinto shrine, this unique environment allows you to concentrate, watch and even practice the way of the arrow in absolute peace. You can watch people practicing in regular bases or if you are fortunate enough, you may even get to watch a tournament.\n\nA Kyudo priest lives in the Dojo and is in charge of ceremonies and competitions, adding an enigmatic feeling to the whole experience. The Dojo is not in any way big or has impressive construction, but its environment alone makes it worth the visit.\n\nHOW TO GET THERE\n\nKashima-jingu shrine is a 10-minute walk from Kashima-Jingu Station. A train from Tokyo station on the Kashima Line will get you to Kashima-Jingu Station in just over two hours.\n\nA Keisei Bus that runs from Tokyo Station's Yaesu exit directly takes you to Kashima-jingu shrine in about two hours.\n\nTakushoku University karate dojo\n\nThis Karate Dojo may appear modest compared to the previous mentioned ones, but the history surrounding Takushoku university and its strong relationship with Budo makes visiting it a must. In fact, this Dojo could be one of the main reasons why you should take the trip to the original building in the Bunkyō district and the modern satellite campus in Hachiōji city.\n\nNo other university in Japan can claim to be the alma mater of at least 31 famous martial artist, which includes 2 style founders, Kyokushin ’s Oyama, Masutatsu Sensei and Yoshinkan’s Shioda Gozo Sensei. Legendary Judoka Kimura Masahiko Sensei and many other senior instructors from the Japan Karate Association are graduates from Takushoku Daigaku, such as Kanazawa Hirokazu Sensei, Nakayama Masatoshi Sensei, and ‘Great journey to Karate’ and ‘Kuro obi’ star Tatsuya Naka Sensei who currently serves as the general advisor for the Karate club at the university.\n\nThe history of the Karate club at Takushoku University goes back as far as the 1930s when it was founded by Takagi Masato, senior student at the time of Funakoshi Gichin Sensei. The university (and the club) have gone thought many changes, from being a centre of strong support for militarism, producing future leaders for the expansionist ideas for pre-war Japan to a more international thinking university. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that the best times of the university and the club are no longer comparable to its past glory days when Takushoku was ranked amongst the top university along with landmark names such as the Tokyo University and Waseda.\n\nThe current dojo is located in the International Campus, protected by the natural surroundings in the quiet neighbourhood of Hachioji. While the training room is the normal size of an average Dojo, there’s nothing average about their training because while many sports clubs at Japanese universities are just an excuse to socialise and drink, here the intensity of the training is intense and very serious, conducted under the strict and watchful eye of Chief Instructor Taniyama Takuya Sensei; a 5 time JKA Grand Champion and General Manager of the Japan Karate Association as well as an Instructor at the JKA Honbu Dojo.\n\nHOW TO GET THERE\n\nTo Bukyo campus (historical visit)\n\nA three-minute walk from Myogadani Station on the Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line.\n\nTo Hachioji campus (current dojo)\n\nTwenty-minute walk or five-minute bus ride from the south exit of Takao Station on the JR Chuo Line and Keio Line.\n\nButokuden\n\nIf there’s a Dojo that visually epitomises the spirit of Budo, it has to be the Botokuden in Kyoto.\n\nBotokuden which translates to “The Hall of Martial Virtues” is part of a comprehensive martial arts facility known as Kyoto’s Budo Center, with areas dedicated to the practice of Kyudo, Sumo and other sports activities. At the heart of the entire complex is the Botokuden, considered the oldest martial arts centre in Japan, dating back to 1895.\n\nOriginally the headquarters of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, a group endorsed by the Meiji Emperor to solidify, promote and standardise martial disciplines and systems throughout Japan until the end of the WW2 when it was dissolved by American Occupation forces. While closed, the main building was used as the municipal police school and as a school facility of the Kyoto City University of Arts.\n\nAfter 7 years of renovation and different plans to bring it back to its original martial arts use, Butokuden was finally considered a valuable building and became Kyoto City’s designated cultural asset in 1996 as well as ‘Japan’s cultural property’.\n\nThe architectural style of Butokuden is based on traditional Japanese-style architecture but with a modern Japanese-style touch and also Western-style architecture influence after the Meiji era. Design work was handled by Shigemitsu Matsumuro, who was a Kyoto prefectural engineer and who also worked on other Kyoto Designated Cultural Properties such as Kyoto’s Orthodox Cathedral and the Kyoto Prefectural Government Building.\n\nThe Butokuden sits on the north-west side of the Heian Jingu shrine. While walking through the beautiful Shrine gardens, you can hear the unique sounds common to Budo practices coming from the dojo near by.\n\nThe entire complex is home to everything Budo and represents an unforgettable experience. If you happen to visit in May, consider yourself lucky, as the Botokuden hosts a 4 day All Japan Kendo tournament, where 3000 of the strongest fencers (minimum requirement is 6 dan) come together for fierce competition in what is considered the mecca of martial arts in Japan.\n\nHOW TO GET THERE\n\nWhile in Kyoto, the dojo is a one-minute walk from Kumano Jinja Mae bus stop or a 3-minute walk from the Kyoto Kaikan Bijutsukan Mae bus stop."
