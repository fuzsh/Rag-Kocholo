(as of currently) I will add a read more since this will be long!\n\nOk first up is Toyonaga Toshiyuki & Uchiyama Kouki!\n\nI love these two a lot! They work so dang well with each other! Ever since I heard them both in the anime Kimi to Boku and then watched the events for them, they had some pretty great interaction with each other. As well watching the Kimi to Boku Specials too, since they were on the same team at one point :D I also got to listen in on their radio show as well for a bit (I haven’t listened to everything because there’s so many things I have to catch up with xP But I know I will bound to catch up on their radio show, one day!) It’s really amusing when Toshi bullies Ucchi at times, especially during that one time where the staff invited this European girl and Ucchi had to speak in english to her! It was so dang amusing xD\n\nThen when they worked on Zetsuen no Tempest together! That was awesome, I just loved it :D Got to hear Toshi use a rough and deep tone that I never usually hear him in, mixed in with Ucchi being all cool, calm, collective (as always). I was so dang pleased when I got to see and hear them work on an anime together as main’s! The seiyuu event was of course amusing to watch! It wasn’t a dull moment :D\n\nAs well I noticed that whenever Toshi is with Ucchi, Ucchi’s tension tends to rise a bit more xD (if anybody notices that xP) Since usually Ucchi has low tension when he talks, the only time where you hear him have high tension is when he voice acts!\n\nNext up Taniyama Kishou & Shimono Hiro!\n\nOk I must say I just love seeing these two no matter what, they always make my day xD I always have a good laugh seeing these two together! I believe I got into them ever since watching Uta no Prince-sama (Utapri) because of Shou and Natsuki and they’re fun interactions. Then watching the Quiz no Prince-sama with Shimono and Kishou, now that was amusing! I just love it when Kishou tends to bully Shimono. Then seeing them paired up on the Radio Misty live event and yet again Kishou teasing Shimono, wanting him to embrace him from behind. A battle between fan-service, Team Shimono & Kishou vs. Team Kaji & Yonaga! And the standing winners were team, Shimono & Kishou. But what really takes the cake was seeing Kishou get invited on to Shimono’s show, Omotemoshimo! That episode was the best, it made me laugh so much!! And seeing Kishou in the kitchen working with that saran wrap and then failing. Then seeing Shimono get zapped multiple times because of Kishou, never a dull moment.\n\nNext is Hino Satoshi & Tachibana Shinnosuke!\n\nThis match up is deadly (well for me anyways, when it comes to their singing as well drama cd’s too). The Elekter Round 0 team, is an awesome team! I should also mention they’re also part of the Axl One team as well~ Woo hoo Axl One! Anyways these two are very amusing as well to watch and listen too~ From hearing little clips from their radio show to seeing how they interact with each other in various videos ^__^ (Their sword match in PROJECT DABA - HORSE LIFE GAME was so intense!!! I would totally want to see another re-match!!) I could say that they could be very silly and serious at the same time! Another thing I would like to mention is that these two could be pretty DO-S at times xD (which is good and bad xD) Over all they’re pretty much a solid team! I totally recommend that you watch Marine Super Wave R, Jinrou Game, and PROJECT DABA :D (if you wanna see these guys in action!)\n\nThere goes another day! (Man I’m so far behind xP Oh well~)\n\nDay 27 done!"
