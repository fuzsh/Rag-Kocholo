        "text": "Cash flow statements are also required by certain financial reporting standards.\n\nWhat makes a cash flow statement different from your balance sheet is that a balance sheet shows the assets and liabilities your business owns (assets) and owes (liabilities). The cash flow statement simply shows the inflows and outflows of cash from your business over a specific period of time, usually a month.\n\nLet's take a closer look at what cash flow statements do for your business, and why they're so important. Then, we'll walk through an example cash flow statement, and show you how to create your own using a template.\n\nWhat is the purpose of a cash flow statement?\n\nA cash flow statement is a regular financial statement telling you how much cash you have on hand for a specific period.\n\nWhile income statements are excellent for showing you how much money youâve spent and earned, they donât necessarily tell you how much cash you have on hand for a specific period of time.\n\nCash flow statement vs. balance sheet\n\nA balance sheet shows you your businessâs assets, liabilities, and ownerâs equity at a specific moment in timeâtypically at the end of a quarter or a year.\n\nWhat it doesnât show is revenue or expenses, or any of the businessâs other cash activities that impact your companyâs day-to-day health. Those activities are recorded on your cash flow statement.\n\nCash flow statement vs. income statement\n\nUsing only an income statement to track your cash flow can lead to serious problemsâand hereâs why.\n\nIf you use accrual basis accounting, income and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurredânot when the money actually leaves or enters your bank accounts. (The cash accounting method only records money once you have it on hand. Learn more about the cash vs. accrual basis systems of accounting.)\n\nSo, even if you see income reported on your income statement, you may not have the cash from that income on hand. The cash flow statement makes adjustments to the information recorded on your income statement, so you see your net cash flowâthe precise amount of cash you have on hand for that time period.\n\nFor example, depreciation is recorded as a monthly expense. However, you've already paid cash for the asset you're depreciating; you record it on a monthly basis in order to see how much it costs you to have the asset each month over the course of its useful life. But cash isn't literally leaving your bank account every month.\n\nThe cash flow statement takes that monthly expense and reverses itâso you see how much cash you have on hand in reality, not how much you've spent in theory.\n\nWhy do you need cash flow statements?\n\nSo long as you use accrual accounting, cash flow statements are an essential part of financial analysis for three reasons:\n\nThey show your liquidity. That means you know exactly how much operating cash flow you have in case you need to use it. So you know what you can afford, and what you canât.\n\nThey show you changes in assets, liabilities, and equity in the forms of cash outflows, cash inflows, and cash being held. Those three categories are the core of your business accounting. Together, they form the accounting equation that lets you measure your performance.\n\nThey let you predict future cash flows. You can use cash flow statements to create cash flow projections, so you can plan for how much liquidity your business will have in the future. Thatâs important for making long-term business plans.\n\nOn top of that, if you plan on securing a loan or line of credit, youâll need up-to-date cash flow statements to apply.\n\nNegative cash flow vs. positive cash flow\n\nWhen your cash flow statement shows a negative number at the bottom, that means you lost cash during the accounting periodâyou have negative cash flow. Itâs important to remember that long-term, negative cash flow isnât always a bad thing. For example, early stage businesses need to track their burn rate as they try to become profitable.\n\nWhen you have a positive number at the bottom of your statement, youâve got positive cash flow for the month. Keep in mind, positive cash flow isnât always a good thing in the long term. While it gives you more liquidity now, there are negative reasons you may have that moneyâfor instance, by taking on a large loan to bail out your failing business. Positive cash flow isnât always positive overall.\n\nWhere do cash flow statements come from?\n\nIf you do your own bookkeeping in Excel, you can calculate cash flow statements each month based on the information on your income statements and balance sheets. If you use accounting software, it can create cash flow statements based on the information youâve already entered in the general ledger.\n\nKeep in mind, with both those methods, your cash flow statement is only accurate so long as the rest of your bookkeeping is accurate too. The most surefire way to know how much working capital you have is to hire a bookkeeper. Theyâll make sure everything adds up, so your cash flow statement always gives you an accurate picture of your companyâs financial health.\n\nStatements of cash flow using the direct and indirect methods\n\nIn order to figure out your companyâs cash flow, you can take one of two routes: The direct method, and the indirect method. While generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) approve both, the indirect method is typically preferred by small businesses.\n\nThe direct method of calculating cash flow\n\nUsing the direct method, you keep a record of cash as it enters and leaves your business, then use that information at the end of the month to prepare a statement of cash flow.\n\nThe direct method takes more legwork and organization than the indirect methodâyou need to produce and track cash receipts for every cash transaction. For that reason, smaller businesses typically prefer the indirect method.\n\nAlso worth mentioning: Even if you record cash flows in real time with the direct method, youâll also need to use the indirect method to reconcile your statement of cash flows with your income statement. So, you can usually expect the direct method to take longer than the indirect method.\n\nThe indirect method of calculating cash flow\n\nWith the indirect method, you look at the transactions recorded on your income statement, then reverse some of them in order to see your working capital. Youâre selectively backtracking your income statement in order to eliminate transactions that donât show the movement of cash.\n\nSince itâs simpler than the direct method, many small businesses prefer this approach. Also, when using the indirect method, you do not have to go back and reconcile your statements with the direct method.\n\nIn our examples below, weâll use the indirect method of calculating cash flow.\n\nHow the cash flow statement works with the income statement and the balance sheet\n\nYou use information from your income statement and your balance sheet to create your cash flow statement. The income statement lets you know how money entered and left your business, while the balance sheet shows how those transactions affect different accountsâlike accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.\n\nSo, the process of producing financial statements for your business goes:\n\nIncome Statement + Balance Sheet = Cash Flow Statement\n\nExample of a cash flow statement\n\nNow that weâve got a sense of what a statement of cash flows does and, broadly, how itâs created, letâs check out an example.\n\nThereâs a fair amount to unpack here. But hereâs what you need to know to get a rough idea of what this cash flow statement is doing.\n\nRed dollar amounts decrease cash. For instance, when we see ($30,000) next to âIncrease in inventory,â it means inventory increased by $30,000 on the balance sheet. We bought $30,000 worth of inventory, so our cash balance decreased by that amount.\n\nBlack dollar amounts increase cash. For example, when we see $20,000 next to âDepreciation,â that $20,000 is an expense on the income statement, but depreciation doesnât actually decrease cash. So we add it back to net income.\n\nYouâll also notice that the statement of cash flows is broken down into three sectionsâCash Flow from Operating Activities, Cash Flow from Investing Activities, and Cash Flow from Financing Activities. Letâs look at what each section of the cash flow statement does.\n\nThe three sections of a cash flow statement\n\nThese three activities sections of the statement of cash flows designate the different ways cash can enter and leave your business.\n\nCash Flow from Operating Activities is cash earned or spent in the course of regular business activityâthe main way your business makes money, by selling products or services.\n\nCash Flow from Investing Activities is cash earned or spent from investments your company makes, such as purchasing equipment or investing in other companies.\n\nCash Flow from Financing Activities is cash earned or spent in the course of financing your company with loans, lines of credit, or ownerâs equity.\n\nUsing the cash flow statement example above, hereâs a more detailed look at what each section does, and what it means for your business.\n\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nFor most small businesses, Operating Activities will include most of your cash flow. Thatâs because operating activities are what you do to get revenue. If you run a pizza shop, itâs the cash you spend on ingredients and labor, and the cash you earn from selling pies. If youâre a registered massage therapist, Operating Activities is where you see your earned cash from giving massages, and the cash you spend on rent and utilities.\n\nCash Flow from Operating Activities in our example\n\nTaking another look at this section, letâs break it down line by line.\n\nNet income is the total income, after expenses, for the month. We get this from the income statement.\n\nDepreciation is recorded as a $20,000 expense on the income statement. Here, itâs listed as income. Since no cash actually left our hands, weâre adding that $20,000 back to cash on hand.\n\nIncrease in Accounts Payable is recorded as a $10,000 expense on the income statement. Thatâs money we oweâin this case, letâs say itâs paying contractors to build a new goat pen. Since we owe the money, but havenât actually paid it, we add that amount back to the cash on hand.\n\nIncrease in Accounts Receivable is recorded as a $20,000 growth in accounts receivable on the income statement. Thatâs money weâve charged clientsâbut we havenât actually been paid yet. Even though the money weâve charged is an asset, it isnât cold hard cash. So we deduct that $20,000 from cash on hand.\n\nIncrease in Inventory is recorded as a $30,000 growth in inventory on the balance sheet. That means weâve paid $30,000 cash to get $30,000 worth of inventory. Inventory is an asset, but it isnât cashâwe canât spend it. So we deduct the $30,000 from cash on hand.\n\nNet Cash from Operating Activities, after weâve made all the changes above, comes out to $40,000.\n\nMeaning, even though our business earned $60,000 in October (as reported on our income statement), we only actually received $40,000 in cash from operating activities.\n\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nThis section covers investments your company has madeâby purchasing equipment, real estate, land, or easily liquidated financial products referred to as âcash equivalents.â When you spend cash on an investment, that cash gets converted to an asset of equal value.\n\nIf you buy a $10,000 mower for your landscaping company, you lose $10,000 cash and get a $10,000 mower. If you buy a $140,000 retail space, you lose $140,000 cash and get a $140,000 retail space.\n\nUnder Cash Flow from Investing Activities, we reverse those investments, removing the cash on hand. They have cash value, but they arenât the same as cashâand the only asset weâre interested in, in this context, is currency.\n\nFor small businesses, Cash Flow from Investing Activities usually wonât make up the majority of cash flow for your company. But it still needs to be reconciled, since it affects your working capital.\n\nCash Flow from Investing Activities in our example\n\nPurchase of Equipment is recorded as a new $5,000 asset on our income statement. Itâs an asset, not cashâso, with ($5,000) on the cash flow statement, we deduct $5,000 from cash on hand.\n\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\n\nThis section covers revenue earned or assets spent on Financing Activities. When you pay off part of your loan or line of credit, money leaves your bank accounts. When you tap your line of credit, get a loan, or bring on a new investor, you receive cash in your accounts.\n\nCash Flow from Financing Activities in our example\n\nNotes payable is recorded as a $7,500 liability on the balance sheet. Since we received proceeds from the loan, we record it as a $7,500 increase to cash on hand.\n\nCash flow for the month\n\nAt the bottom of our cash flow statement, we see our total cash flow for the month: $42,500.\n\nEven though our net income listed at the top of the cash flow statement (and taken from our income statement) was $60,000, we only received $42,500.\n\nThatâs $42,500 we can spend right now, if need be. If we only looked at our net income, we might believe we had $60,000 cash on hand. In that case, we wouldnât truly know what we had to work withâand weâd run the risk of overspending, budgeting incorrectly, or misrepresenting our liquidity to loan officers or business partners.\n\nUsing a cash flow statement template\n\nDo your own bookkeeping using spreadsheets? In that case, using a cash flow statement template will save you time and energy.\n\nOur Free Cash Flow Statement Template is easy to download and simple to use.\n\nHow to track cash flow using the indirect method\n\nFour simple rules to remember as you create your cash flow statement:\n\nTransactions that show an increase in assets result in a decrease in cash flow.\n\nTransactions that show a decrease in assets result in an increase in cash flow.\n\nTransactions that show an increase in liabilities result in an increase in cash flow.\n\nTransactions that show a decrease in liabilities result in a decrease in cash flow.\n\nIf youâve already gone through the example statement above and you feel like you have a pretty good grasp of how to create a cash flow statement, go ahead and start experimenting with our Free Income Statement Template and Free Cash Flow Template.\n\nBut if youâd like to get a clearer idea of how it all works, this quick example should help.\n\nCreating a cash flow statement from your income statement and balance sheet\n\nLetâs say weâre creating a cash flow statement for Gregâs Popsicle Stand for July 2019.\n\nOur income statement looks like this:\n\nNote: For the sake of simplicity, this example omits income tax.\n\nAnd our balance sheet looks like this:\n\nRemember the four rules for converting information from an income statement to a cash flow statement? Letâs use them to create our cash flow statement.\n\nOur net income for the month on the income statement is $3,500 â that stays the same, since itâs a total amount, not a specific account.\n\nAdditions to Cash\n\nDepreciation is included in expenses for the month, but it didnât actually impact cash, so we add that back to cash.\n\nAccounts payable increased by $5,500. Thatâs a liability on the balance sheet, but the cash wasnât actually paid out for those expenses, so we add them back to cash as well.\n\nDecreases to Cash\n\nAccounts receivable increased by $4,000. Thatâs an asset recorded on the balance sheet, but we didnât actually receive the cash, so we remove it from cash on hand.\n\nOur net cash flow from operating activities adds up to $5,500.\n\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nGreg purchased $5,000 of equipment during this accounting period, so he spent $5,000 of cash on investing activities.\n\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\n\nGreg didnât invest any additional money in the business, take out a new loan, or make cash payments towards any existing debt during this accounting period, so there are no cash flows from financing activities.\n\nCash Flow for Month Ending July 31, 2019 is $500, once we crunch all the numbers. Greg started the accounting period with $5,500 in cash. After accounting for all of the additions and subtractions to cash, he has $6,000 at the end of the period.\n\nâ"
