It is the strongest form the DigiDestined can become, wielding the ZERO ARMS: Orochi.\n\nWhen Koichi sacrifices himself to save the others from Lucemon Chaos Mode, he gives his Spirits of Darkness to his brother Koji. Using the combination of Light and Darkness as a catalyst, Takuya and Koji bring all twenty Spirits together and become Susanoomon. The Brothers Yin and Yang In this form, they fight against Lucemon, whose Ultimate Sacrifice they defeat by splitting back into humans and Spirits before the attack can hurt them. Susanoomon then cleaves him with Celestial Blade and scans the light side of his fractal code. Lucemon on the Loose\n\nUnfortunately, the dark side of his fractal code takes the form of the enormous Lucemon Shadowlord Mode, who proceeds to try to enter the human world. Defeated in their lesser forms, the remaining DigiDestined lose hope until the Ten Legendary Warriors and the Celestial Digimon manifest in order to give them strength. Together, the five of them combine to form Susanoomon once more. Right as Lucemon enters the human world proper, Susanoomon drags Lucemon back into the Digital World, where they strike his Gehenna, a dark sphere in which Lucemon Larva hides. With the knowledge that Lucemon's true form is hiding in that sphere, Susanoomon manages to shatter the Gehenna and then destroy the now berserk Shadowlord Mode body. However, Susanoomon is blindsided by Lucemon Larva, so the Ten Legendary Warriors eject the DigiDestined from Susanoomon and remove the core sword from the ZERO-ARMS: Orochi. They split into their individual Human forms to finally strike down Lucemon Larva. End of the Line\n\nIn Digimon Fusion, legendary heroes from across the multiverse are called to aid against Quartzmon. Among those heroes is Takuya, who spirit evolves to Aldamon. When he needs more power against the VenomMyotismon and MaloMyotismon copies Quartzmon creates, Kumamon and the others give Takuya the rest of the Spirits, which allows him to ancient spirit evolve to Susanoomon with the aid of his allies. A Great Legendary Hero Gathering! The Digimon All-star Showdown!! Susanoomon and Takuya then give their power to Tagiru Akashi and Arresterdramon so they can retrieve the Brave Snatcher and defeat Quartzmon once and for all. Burn up Tagiru! A Glorious Digimon Hunt!\n\nSusanoomon appears in Digimon BattleSpirit 2 as the ancient spirit evolution for ExAgunimon and ExLobomon.\n\nAttacks\n\nCelestial Blade (天羽々斬, Ama-no-Habakiri?, lit. \"Slash of Heavenly Wings\")[2]: Slices and stabs everything in the world with the ZERO-ARMS: Orochi.\n\nHeaven's Thunder (八雷神, Yakusa-no-Ikadzuchi?, lit. \"Eight Thunder Gods\"): Points the ZERO-ARMS: Orochi at the heavens, which then rain incessant bolts of lightning upon the ground.\n\nAllies[]\n\nGotsumon[]\n\nJapanese: Yasuhiro Takato (Gottsumon, Admirer of the Ten Warriors), Ryō Naitō, Yūsuke Oguri (Gottsumon)\n\nEnglish: R. Martin Klein ([1])\n\nGotsumon are inhabitants of Gotsumon Village terrorized by Grumblemon. One particular Gotsumon is an admirer of the Ten Legendary Warriors as well as an archeologist who seeks the three jewels to unlock the B Spirit of Light. Gigasmon attacks him, but he is saved by Koji Minamoto as Lobomon, though he loses the battle. Gotsumon takes Lobomon back to his village to recover, but an argument leads Gotsumon to head out on his own to become a Legendary Warrior. He finds the last jewel needed just as Gigasmon attacks, and holds Gigasmon off as Koji unlocks the Spirit and becomes KendoGarurumon. When Koji's inability to control his bestial instincts sends him and Gigasmon off of a cliff, Gotsumon saves Koji, and the two part on amicable terms. Can't Keep a Grumblemon Down\n\nGotsumon later tries to protect his home from the Royal Knights but ultimately fails, though the DigiDestined manage to prevent him from losing his life as well. Gotsumon joins them in defending Seraphimon's Castle, distracting the attacking Knightmon before Crusadermon shows up. Feeling useless, he digivolves to Meteormon to join the battle and destroys the Knightmon, but it is for naught—Dynasmon manages to scan the castle. Wounded heavily in the fight, Meteormon degenerates to Gotsumon and leaves the future in the DigiDestined's hands. Now You See It, Now You Don't\n\nAttacks\n\nAs Gotsumon\n\nRock Fist (Angry Rock): Summons then hurls a number of heavy rocks from his head.\n\nAs Meteormon\n\nGalactic Flare (Cosmo Flash): Unleashes orbs of energy which defeats his foes instantly.\n\nPandamon[]\n\nJapanese: Umi Tenjin\n\nEnglish: Michael Sorich ([1])\n\nPandamon is an inhabitant of Toy Country who remembers its original purpose. When Cherubimon subverted the ShadowToyAgumon, he went into hiding underneath Toy Country's castle. When Takuya and Koji attempt to storm the castle to rescue Tommy, the ShadowToyAgumon pull the bridge from underneath them. Pandamon saves them from the moat and takes them to a hidden underground route. He explains Toy Country's history, and when the battle is finished and the ShadowToyAgumon, purified, Pandamon thanks the DigiDestined for their help. Island of Misfit Boys\n\nSorcermon[]\n\nJapanese: Kazunari Kojima\n\nEnglish: Dave Wittenberg ([1])\n\nSorcermon is Seraphimon's retainer and caretaker of Seraphimon's Castle. When Cherubimon went rogue and invaded, Sorcermon was the one who informed the other two Celestial Digimon of the attack. Operation: Free Ophanimon After Seraphimon is put to sleep, Sorcermon guards the castle from any and all intruders, up until the DigiDestined arrive under Ophanimon's auspices and awaken his lord. Sorcermon is gladdened by Seraphimon's revival and moves to aid in his retaking of the Digital World, up until Cherubimon's fallen warriors arrive and attack. Seraphimon is defeated in the resulting struggle, and Sorcermon, disheartened though not defeated, realizes that as long as Seraphimon's Digi-Egg remains free with the DigiDestined, there is still hope. He activates a hidden route and gives his life to buy enough time for the DigiDestined to escape. Better An Egg Than An Egg Shell When the Royal Knights are far into their campaign to scan the Digital World, his spirit erects a barrier to protect the castle, containing the Forest Kingdom's key, from harm. When the DigiDestined arrive, Sorcermon opens a hole in the barrier and guides them to the key through Takuya's D-Tector. In the face of Dynasmon's ultimate attack, Sorcermon uses the last of his energy to shield the DigiDestined and the key, fading away after entrusting the future to them. Now You See It, Now You Don't\n\nAttacks\n\nCrystal Barrage (Crystal Cloud): Fires a multitude of ice crystals from his snowflake staff.\n\nWhamon[]\n\nJapanese: Kōhei Kowada\n\nEnglish: Peter Spellos ([1])\n\nWhamon is a traveler of the Digital World's oceans. While on his own, he discovers a shining object that he eats, but before he can leave, Grumblemon comes and breaks some of the land for scanning. Caught in the resulting void, he is dragged into the Blue Cave. Whamon thrashes out from a pain and claustrophobia, accidentally hurting J.P. and Tommy. Agunimon and Lobomon force him to calm down, where he explains his story, just as Grumblemon catches up to the DigiDestined after their defeat at Seraphimon's Castle. Grumblemon summons an army of Golemon, and everyone is forced into the resulting battle. When Grumblemon is about to attack a defenseless J.P., Whamon attacks. The resulting blast of water reveals the B Spirit of Thunder from where it had been lodged in Whamon's body. J.P. takes the Spirit and spirit evolves to MetalKabuterimon, defeating Grumblemon for good but also damaging the cave. Whamon uses the opportunity to take the DigiDestined to the open sea. No Whamon Whamon leaves them on a safe island, parting on good terms. Beastie Girl\n\nAttacks\n\nBlasting Spout (Jet Arrow): Shoots a jet of water from his blowhole.\n\nDatamon[]\n\nJapanese: Yūichi Nagashima\n\nEnglish: Tom Fahn ([1])\n\nDatamon is a merchant at the Autumn Leaf Fair. He trades a camera for the four D-Tectors that the Toucanmon had stolen from the DigiDestined. When Tommy visits his shop, he aids Datamon in finishing a computer game. In response, Datamon makes a deal with Tommy. If Tommy can get a object of worth to trade by a certain time, he'll return the D-Tectors. Arbormon instead drags back the Toucanmon to reverse their trade. Datamon sees through the camera that the Toucanmon had been saved by Tommy and then ditched him. Feeling Tommy to be worthy, Datamon upholds his end of the deal. Arbormon doesn't just take this insult and attacks; Datamon defends himself and his shop, though he is no match for Petaldramon. When Tommy comes back, Datamon returns the D-Tectors with an upgrade for Tommy: the B Spirit of Ice, won from the video game Tommy helped him with. With that Spirit and the others' help, Tommy deals with Petaldramon, to Datamon's gratitude. Bizarre Bazaar When the Royal Knights near the end of their campaign against the Digital World, Datamon helps set up defenses at the Autumn Leaf Fair. He does his best and then entrusts the future to the DigiDestined, evacuating with the rest of the Digimon. All Aboard The Tag Team Express\n\nAttacks\n\nNano Swarm (Plug Bomb): Fires several computer viruses from his fingers.\n\nSepikmon[]\n\nJapanese: Satoshi Taki\n\nEnglish: Michael McConnohie ([1])\n\nSepikmon is an inhabitant of the Continent of Darkness and somewhat of a seer. He tries to make friends by attacking Neemon and Bokomon when three of the DigiDestined are captured by Mercurymon and Ranamon after the disastrous battle against Duskmon. Agunimon arrives to catch his Spirit Boomerang attack, and Sepikmon says he wants to make friends. After having friendship explained to him and then having Agunimon accept his offer to be friends, Sepikmon uses his boomerang to help Agunimon find the others. Sockit Takuya The same Sepikmon returns to help the Legendary Warriors, Datamon, and the Toucanmon build a defense before the Royal Knights invades the recently-evacuated Autumn Leaf Fair. He uses his seer powers to view and relay the Royal Knight's massacre of the aerial Digimon force led by Zanbamon before joining the evacuation. All Aboard The Tag Team Express\n\nAttacks\n\nSpirit Boomerang: Throws his boomerang.\n\nOryxmon[]\n\nJapanese: Keiichi Sonobe\n\nEnglish: Derek Stephen Prince ([1])\n\nOryxmon is one of Cherubimon's servants and performs his duty in his castle. Though he is Cherubimon's servant, Oryxmon has not been corrupted by his influence and remains dedicated to the Celestial Digimon as a whole. When the DigiDestined are infiltrating the castle and run into trouble in the Hall of Shadows where Cherubimon's shades are kept, Oryxmon's holy bell forces the prisoners to leave the DigiDestined alone. Though the DigiDestined initially do not trust him, Patamon is at peace with him, and so they agree to follow him. He sneaks Ophanimon's DigiDestined to the Light Barrier where the Celestial Digimon is being kept. Operation: Free Ophanimon The meeting is all according to Cherubimon's plan, however, and though Oryxmon is faultless for the discovery, Cherubimon declares that he has outlived his usefulness and strikes down his servant. Takuya and Koji's Evolution Revolution\n\nBaromon[]\n\nJapanese: Kazuya Ichijō\n\nEnglish: Neil Kaplan ([1])\n\nBaromon is a historian for the Digital World. He attacks the DigiDestined when they approach the area he protects, believing them to be intruders. When he sees them evolve to become avatars of the Ten Legendary Warriors however, he stops his attack and bids them entrance into the Tunnel of History, in which he replays the entirety of the Digital World's history, from Lucemon's quelling of the Human-Beast war to the Ten Legendary Warriors' uprising and the advent of the Celestial Digimon. He then treads onto the present, with Cherubimon's defeat and the current scanning of the world by unknown agents. Baromon ends with a prophecy of the future—the total destruction of the Digital World. Disheartened by this prediction, he tells the DigiDestined to return home, just for the Royal Knights to come and scan the Tunnel.\n\nBaromon watches as the DigiDestined battle Lucemon's knights, slowly believing that they can change the future he saw. The Royal Knights prove to be much too powerful even for their new Unified Spirit Evolution forms, and Baromon gives his life to protect the unevolved DigiDestined from the Royal Knights' combined assault. It Can't Be! Lucemon Reappears\n\nAttacks\n\nMeteor Dance: Dances to summon meteors that fall upon his enemies.\n\nAngemon[]\n\nJapanese: Hikaru Midorikawa\n\nEnglish: Dave Mallow ([1])\n\nAngemon is one of Ophanimon's servants. After she calls the human children to the Digital World, attempting to find those who can wield the Spirits, she sends back those who were not chosen. Katsuharu, Teppei, Chiaki, and Teruo refuse to return, and Angemon is assigned a mission to watch over them. He attempts many times to convince them to go back to the Human World but is rebuffed each time, and so he continues to guard them from the Digital World's dangers. Angemon and the children settle into Steel Town, where he clashes with a Sagittarimon bandit. In their second battle, Angemon saves the DigiDestined, who are surprised at seeing fellow humans. The two groups argue, with the DigiDestined attempting to convince the children that they should return while being also rebuffed. Angemon meets with the DigiDestined afterward, recognizing them as those who inherited the Spirits, and explains the other children's background. They are interrupted by Sagittarimon once more, who brings with him a Centarumon army. He heads into battle by himself, refusing to put the last hope of the Digital World in any danger. Unfortunately, Sagittarimon has another Centarumon team ambush them from behind, and the bandit clashes with Angemon to prevent him from helping. The DigiDestined spirit evolve to take care of the Centarumon, leaving Angemon to defeat Sagittarimon. Seeing the DigiDestined's strength and recognizing the true danger, the children Angemon guard now decide to leave. Angemon is about to say farewell when the Royal Knights arrive, seeking the children. He attempts to protect them, but Angemon is killed in one strike, with his fractal code scanned by Dynasmon. The Bully Pulpit\n\nAttacks\n\nHand of Fate (Heaven's Knuckle): Strikes the opponent with his fist shining gold.\n\nKatsuharu, Teppei, Chiaki, and Teruo[]\n\nJapanese: Kentaro Ito (Katsuharu), Yuko Tachibana (Teppei), Ken Nakamura (Chiaki), Rieko Nakayama (Teruo)\n\nEnglish: Brad MacDonald (Katsuharu[1]), Joshua Seth (Teppei[1]), Tifanie Christun (Chiaki[1]), Brian Donovan (Teruo[1])\n\nKatsuharu (勝春, Katsuharu?), Teppei (鉄平, Teppei?), Chiaki (千晶, Chiaki?) and Teruo (照男, Teruo?) are four kids who were also called by Ophanimon to come the Digital World on the chance that they could inherit the Spirits of the Ten Legendary Warriors. Chiaki is the only girl among them.\n\nKatsuharu and Teppei bully Tommy in the Shibuya Train Station and force him into Trailmon (Worm), All Aboard and, along with Chiaki and Teruo, decide to ride on one to go to the Digital World. When all the other children are ordered to return to the Human World, these four decided to stay. In response, Ophanimon has Angemon attempt to convince them to leave, but he is unsuccessful. He remains with them and protects the children while trying to convince them to leave, but this only gives them the impression that he is their Digimon partner. The Bully Pulpit\n\nThe group stop by the Beanstalk Village, where in spite of the fact that the Mamemon inhabitants have fallen on hard times, they are treated well and even given the last beans of the village. The children decide to plant them right there, and when they leave, a gigantic beanstalk sprouts almost immediately, bringing bounty to the previously dry land. Jerks And The Beanstalk\n\nKatsuharu's group shows up when Sagittarimon approaches the DigiDestined demanding them to give their possessions, and their guardian Angemon intervenes in what would have turned into a battle. The DigiDestined soon learn that Katsuharu and Teppei were the two boys who bullied Tommy at the beginning of the journey, and Tommy begins to retreat into himself at the sight of them. The DigiDestined try to convince the humans to return back to the Human World, citing the increasing danger, but they refuse to believe them. Chiaki explains to Zoe and J.P. that she feels she could grow stronger in the Digital World, while Teruo enjoys the freedom from monotony that the Digital World brings. Tommy is confronted by Teppei, who tries to bully Tommy into returning, but Katsuharu stops him, saying that they've grown past that. He does, however, tell Tommy that he's too weak to stay in the world, though Tommy denies this accusation. Before the confrontation can continue, Sagittarimon attacks once more, this time with a Centarumon army. Angemon faces them head-on, but an ambush by a second Centarumon squad to the vulnerable humans forces them to flee. Teppei trips while running and pleads for Katsuharu to save him, but Katsuharu freezes in fear. Tommy, on the other hand, dives in to save Teppei from a Centarumon's attack, showing his growth and strength. He spirit evolves to Korikakumon, prompting the others to spirit evolve as well. Once the Legendary Warriors and Angemon drive off Sagittarimon, Katsuharu makes peace with Tommy, deciding to return home and convincing the others as well. Before they can, the Royal Knights come, kill Angemon, and kidnap the children, while Tommy hitches a ride. The Bully Pulpit\n\nThe Royal Knights bring them back to the Beanstock Village, which they have since conquered and imprisoned its inhabitants, seeking the village's key to unlock its fractal code. When the children prove to know nothing about the key, the Royal Knights lock them in with the Mamemon, who reveal how the seeds the children planted grew into the beanstalk. They stage a rebellion, but it fails in the face of the Royal Knights' overwhelming might, and the Royal Knights threaten the Mamemon Elder. Katsuharu's group stand up to the Royal Knights, remembering their kindness, but Crusadermon instead threatens Katsuharu's fractal code, wondering what the results of scanning a human would be. Before this can come to pass, the other DigiDestined crash in. Even their strength is no match for the Royal Knights, and in order to prevent deaths, the Mamemon Elder tells the Royal Knights the location of the key at the top of the beanstalk. The Royal Knights scan the village as the inhabitants evacuate, but once they are at a safe harbor, the Mamemon Elder assures the children that they can rebuild, revealing a bean from that beanstalk.\n\nUltimately, the children return home on the Trailmon, now convinced of the increasing danger. To make up for his bullying in the past, Katsuharu tells Tommy to push him into the train, which Tommy does with no hard feelings. As they leave, Katsuharu's group waves goodbye to the DigiDestined, entrusting the safety of their friends and this world to them. Jerks And The Beanstalk\n\nAfter the DigiDestined save the Digital World, Katsuharu and Teppei nurture their new friendship with Tommy as they play soccer together. End of the Line\n\nSwanmon[]\n\nJapanese: Mari Adachi\n\nEnglish: Wendee Lee ([1])\n\nSwanmon is the overtaxed but passionate caretaker of the Village of Beginnings and its babies as well as its Digi-Eggs. When the DigiDestined travel to the village, Swanmon sees them as intruders, but once the DigiDestined explain that they are not there to harm the children, she accepts their help in caring for the babies and feeds them in return. She directs the DigiDestined to the Trailmon who should service the Village, but the Royal Knights attack, and she is heavily injured attempted to protect the village and its inhabitants. Though the village itself is lost, Swanmon is successfully evacuated along with the children and eggs on the Trailmon. Glean Eggs And Scram\n\nAttacks\n\nDown Tornado: Unleashes a tornado made of her feathers.\n\nNefertimon[]\n\nJapanese: Ai Nagano\n\nEnglish: Bridget Hoffman ([1])\n\nNefertimon is the caretaker of Ophanimon's Castle who acknowledges the DigiDestined when they come to the castle to protect the final area from the Royal Knights' rampage. Though she claims not to know where the key is, she allows the DigiDestined free rein in searching the castle's many books. They search through the night but ultimately come up empty—the Royal Knights reveal why when they attack. Nefertimon herself is the key, and, under attack from the Royal Knights, pleads for the DigiDestined to kill her, as that would protect the area forever. The DigiDestined refuse, instead deciding to attack the Royal Knights head on. Lucemon, however, intervenes in the resulting battle from the Dark Area, defeating the DigiDestined. This action allows the Royal Knights to scan Nefertimon and, with her, the area. To Make The World Go Away\n\nAttacks\n\nBeam of Isis (Curse of Queen): Shoots beams of light from her headdress.\n\nRosetta Stone: Fires stone slabs from a light issuing from her back.\n\nMajor Antagonists[]\n\nCherubimon[]\n\nMain article: Cherubimon (Frontier)\n\nCherubimon's Army[]\n\nEvil Legendary Warriors[]\n\nCerberumon[]\n\nJapanese: Fumihiko Tachiki\n\nEnglish: Steve Kramer ([1])\n\nCerberumon is one of Cherubimon's servants, sent to the Flame Terminal to find a Spirit. He ravages the Terminal and attacks Takuya, only for the H Spirit of Flame to be revealed. Cerberumon attempts to take the Spirit for himself, but the Spirit chooses Takuya instead, allowing him to spirit evolve to Agunimon. After a tough battle, Cerberumon is defeated, his Fractal Code scanned and purified by Takuya's D-Tector. All Aboard The resulting digitization of his fractal code restores a significant portion of the Flame Terminal. Lobomon: Warrior of Light\n\nAttacks\n\nPortals of Darkness (Inferno Gate): Opens a \"Hell Gate\" engraved in the earth, then casts the opponent through it to the jet-black Dark Area.\n\nEmerald Blaze (Hellfire): Spews a green jet of flames.\n\nMushroomon[]\n\nJapanese: Yoshikazu Nagano, Masahito Yabe (Mushmon), Hiroaki Ishikawa (Woodmon)\n\nEnglish: Brian Donovan, Paul St. Peter (Mushroomon[1]), Neil Kaplan (Mushroomon; Woodmon[1])\n\nMushroomon are former inhabitants of Breezy Village who have been subverted by Cherubimon. Disgusted by the Floramon's relentless work to save their village, they do nothing but bully them and destroy their achievements. Zoe refuses to stand for this injustice, and this action draws the H Spirit of Wind to her, letting her become Kazemon. Kazemon is more than a match for the Mushroomon, but they band together to become Woodmon, whom Kazemon needs Lobomon's help to defeat. After Lobomon scans Woodmon, he reverts back to the three Mushroomon, who wonder what they have been up to. The Floramon welcome them back into the village, and all is forgiven.

They initially worked together to play with children, but Cherubimon's influence led to them turning evil. They desire to go to the Human World to take revenge on children for discarding them. When the DigiDestined appear in Toy Country, the ShadowToyAgumon watch and wait in the background, eventually turning Monzaemon evil to kidnap Tommy.

The dreams cause Tommy to attack the others, and when that isn't enough, Bakumon attempt to infect Takuya in the same way. Takuya is strong enough to overcome the dreams, however, and realizes that he needs to snap Tommy out of it. Takuya attacks and purifies Bakumon, which releases his hold over Tommy.

It is destroyed when a rampaging BurningGreymon furiously blasts it. A Hunka Hunka BurningGreymon When Grumblemon catches up to the DigiDestined after Seraphimon's defeat, he summons an entire army of Golemon, which manage to take down Kumamon and Beetlemon.

The Toucanmon take the opportunity to steal the boys' D-Tectors and flee but are caught leaving. When Ranamon shows up to retrieve the Spirits, Zoe attacks her, but Ranamon manages to locate her B Spirit of Water during the battle. She uses her newly acquired spirit to slide evolve to Calmaramon, but Calmaramon's ugliness disgusts the Toucanmon, who quickly abandon their idol. Beastie Girl They decide to sell the D-Tectors rather than simply throw them away and head to the Autumn Leaf Fair. The Swiss Family Digimon At the Fair, they trade the Digivices to Datamon for a camera, but Tommy catches sight of them and gives chase. The Toucanmon fall into a weakness in the ice, but Tommy saves them. Rather than be grateful, the Toucanmon quickly flee with the camera until they are caught by Arbormon, who takes them to Datamon to have their camera returned for the D-Tectors. The Toucanmon then escape in confusion during the resulting battle.

A battle ensues, but Kazemon, Beetlemon, and Kumamon have trouble fighting the Chamelemon due to their ability to camouflage their location.

Beetlemon takes form as the shadow of Beetlemon and continues Volcamon's psychological assault. He further questions whether J.P.'s friends are actually his friends by bringing up how lonely J.P. was in school, with only fair weather friends despite his best efforts. The shadow summons a fighting ring and fills the stands with copies of J.P.'s friends, who hurl insults at J.P. He brings J.P. to his knees, but before he can do the finishing blow, the other DigiDestined arrive and provide encouragement for J.P., who takes that strength and becomes MetalKabuterimon. The shadow slide evolves to MetalKabuterimon as well, but J.P. uses a close-range Electron Cannon to wipe out both the shadow and the surrounding copies with little regard to his own well-being in order to protect his friends. Because he was formed from J.P.'s shadow, Beetlemon has no fractal code to scan.

When Tommy is trapped in the area, he is attacked by a Digimon and unable to spirit evolve. Asuramon appears to save him in a hooded form, and he tells Tommy that he wants to help him look for the other DigiDestined. Asuramon is overly friendly the entire time, forcing Tommy to depend on him before demanding his Spirits in recompense. Tommy rejects this idea of friendship, and, enraged, Asuramon burns his cloak away, revealing his true form as the Digimon who had attacked Tommy. Kumamon is at a great disadvantage due to the environment, and despite all of his tricks, Asuramon manages to trap him in a circle of flames. When Tommy realizes the lessons on true friendship his brother tried to impart, Tommy slide evolves into Korikakumon and uses his power to defeat and scan Asuramon.

A master tactician who has dedicated his life to training, he can read Koji's heart with his abilities. He can dodge and block every one of Lobomon's moves, and he inflicts psychological damage at the same time, calling out Koji's lone wolf tendencies and intense loneliness. Though he does have great skill, Karatenmon pushes Koji too far, and when he becomes KendoGarurumon, the Beast Spirit's speed proves to be too much for his reactionary abilities. Koji defeats and scans Karatenmon, winning exit from the Wind Area.

They attempt to lay traps for Zoe in their idol's everlasting vendetta against the Warrior of Wind, but they prove to be so incompetent that Zoe has to help them when they get inevitably caught in their own attempts. Due to these repeated rescues, the Honeybeemon become enamored with Zoe, and when Ranamon gives them a poisoned apple to give to Zoe, they only reluctantly do so. In the resulting fight between Zoe and Ranamon, they unenthusiastically cheer for Ranamon before they give in to their true feelings and root for Zoe.

Normally a proud, heroic being, Cherubimon's control renders him cold and unwilling to go against orders. Takuya gets into a fierce battle against him as Agunimon, and they are evenly matched.

He is harsh and mean, doing anything he can to win the race. His very participation scares off all of the other racers, leading to the DigiDestined taking over. ShadowWereGarurumon's frustration at being passed by Takuya leads to him taking out a fragile bridge and then confronting Takuya himself in battle. Though he is warded off, ShadowWereGarurumon has his revenge in the final tunnel, when Doggymon derails the Trailmon (Worm) he is riding on then ignites the DemiMeramon within. Takuya evolves to BurningGreymon, however, and knocks Buffalo off track, leading to ShadowWereGarurumon's loss. Trailmon vs. Trailmon During the Royal Knights' campaign to scan the Digital World, ShadowWereGarurumon and Doggymon are two of the Digimon who are evacuating Autumn Leaf Fair.

He became so powerful that it took an army to defeat him and was sentenced to eternal imprisonment beneath Cherubimon's Castle, as not even Cherubimon could destroy him. However, when the DigiDestined face Cherubimon in his home base and temporarily defeat him, their battle destroys a large portion of the castle and accidentally releases him. IceDevimon begins his next massacre by fighting the DigiDestined. He takes out Takuya and Koji early by sealing their D-Tectors in ice and then sadistically plays with the others. When he begins torturing Koji with ice, JagerLoweemon grows incensed and rallies the troops. Unable to stand against the combined assault from four Beast Spirits, IceDevimon is scanned by Loweemon. Ice Ice Baby\n\nDave Wittenberg voices IceDevimon in the style of Christopher Walken[4].\n\nSagittarimon[]\n\nJapanese: Yoshikazu Nagano (Sagittarimon)\n\nEnglish: Beau Billingslea (Sagittarimon[1]), Michael Sorich, Tom Fahn, Dave Mallow (Centarumon[1])\n\nSagittarimon is a bandit who rampages around Steel Town. He is sought after by Katsuharu, Teppei, Chiaki, and Teruo, who style themselves as guardians, and their protector, Angemon. Sagittarimon holds up the DigiDestined, who have just returned from the Blue Moon and are worried about the Royal Knights. Upon determining that he isn't under the Royal Knights' control, they start their attempt to take them out when Katsuharu and his group intervene, and Angemon drives off Sagittarimon. Angered, Sagittarimon returns, this time with a Centarumon army. Angemon attempts to take them on alone, unwilling to risk the Digital World's last hope, when another Centarumon army ambushes them from behind and strike at the vulnerable humans. The DigiDestined spirit evolve, taking care of the Centarumon army, and Angemon drives off Sagittarimon once more. The Bully Pulpit\n\nOne of the recurring jokes in the American English is Sagittarimon's mix up between the words \"obsessions\" and \"possessions\", while in Japanese it's \"kigurumi\" (着ぐるみ, \"kigurumi\"? lit. \"costumed performers\") and \"migurumi\" (身ぐるみ, \"migurumi\"? lit. \"all of one's possessions\").\n\nAttacks\n\nJudgement Arrow: Fires an arrow made of Chrome Digizoid.\n\nSubordinates\n\nCentarumon: Sagittarimon's subordinates, centaur Digimon who can fire the \"Solar Ray\" (Hunting Cannon) attack from their arms.\n\nLucemon[]\n\nMain article: Lucemon (Frontier)\n\nLucemon's Army[]\n\nRoyal Knights[]\n\nMain article: Knightmon (Frontier)\n\nSkullSatamon[]\n\nJapanese: Masaya Onosaka, Kazunari Kojima, Yoshikazu Nagano\n\nEnglish: Dave Guerrie, Dave Mallow, Jamieson Price ([1])\n\nA pair of SkullSatamon are servants of Lucemon who are tasked when scanning and collecting the data around the Village of Flames.

They eventually attack the Village itself, but EmperorGreymon and MagnaGarurumon stand against them. EmperorGreymon and MagnaGarurumon are too strong for the pair, so they reveal that they aren't just a pair—they are a trio. After summoning the third SkullSatamon, their superior numbers give them the upperhand. One of the SkullSatamon threatens a Biyomon into revealing the location of the key. EmperorGreymon's and MagnaGarurumon's desperate defense inspires the Village of Flames Residents to take up arms themselves, going headfirst into battle. By combining their attacks, they manage to get the SkullSatamon into position for a finishing blow that takes out all three at once, after which they are scanned. Bad To The Bones\n\nAttacks\n\nBone Blaster (Nail Bone): Fires a powerful light from the jewel at the end of its staff, disrupting and obliterating the opponent's data.\n\nMurmukusmon[]\n\nMain article: Murmukusmon (Frontier)\n\nOrnismon[]\n\nOrnismon is an ancient Digimon who was sealed away on the Lost Island by AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon when he terrorized the Digital World. A prophecy is left in his resting place that foretells the means of his revival through sacrifice of fractal code. When the villainous Murmukusmon hears of this, he plans on reviving Ornismon to get revenge on the ones who banished him. To do so, Murmukusmon starts a war between the Human and Beast Digimon on the island to get the Fractal Code needed to revive Ornismon. Although the DigiDestined find out his plans, they are a step too late, as Murmukusmon has harvested enough data to bring back Ornismon. The two then go on a killing spree on the Lost Island, but the DigiDestined as well as the tanks of both factions are able to cause some damage to the powerful Digimon. Kotemon's prayers and eventual sacrifice finally allow AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon to appear, and they destroy Ornismon, this time for good.

His elder brother is Dinohyumon, who is in the upper echelons of the Human Digimon. Kotemon dislikes this, however, because he is best of friends with Bearmon, a member of the Beast Digimon. He and Bearmon also lead the children of the island when they gather.\n\nKotemon greets Takuya, J.P., Tommy, Bokomon, and Neemon when they end up on the Lost Island's Human Digimon Area. He then takes them to a neutral point to meet with Bearmon, where they reunite with Koji and Zoe. The DigiDestined get into an argument around the war, which Kotemon, Bearmon, and the children of the island stop by pleading with them. In return, Kotemon takes them to a cave they found bearing the symbol of Ornismon, the alleged guardian spirit of the island. They are found by Grizzlymon and Dinohyumon, who begin to fight each other, only to be stopped by KendoGarurumon and Agunimon. The divisions between the two camps are wide, however, and Kotemon is forced to part with his friend.\n\nWhen the war reaches a critical point and a massive battle begins, the DigiDestined manage to distract the leaders long enough to reunite Kotemon and Bearmon. The two, along with the other children, help Bokomon, Neemon and Tommy to reassemble the shattered hieroglyphics in Ornismon's chamber, only to discover that the ancient Digimon was not a protector at all but an evil force—one which is then unleashed by Murmukusmon, who fostered the conflict on the island to gather the necessary amount of Fractal Code to revive Ornismon. Kotemon begs for AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon to save them, only to be killed by a blast from Ornismon. The sadness of his passing and Bearmon's anguish summons phantasms of two Legendary Warriors, who use their power to defeat Ornismon.\n\nIn the wake of the DigiDestined's departure, Kotemon is reborn and reunited with Bearmon, and they make a mural of the DigiDestined on the cave wall.

He is first encountered by the DigiDestined as he attempts to stop a Beast-type Digimon attack on the Human-type settlement in vain. Later, when attempting to drive Bearmon, a friend of his younger brother Kotemon, away, he gets into a big fight with Grizzlymon. Agunimon stops Dinohyumon, who tries to recruit him in preparation for the impending climactic battle. Takuya agrees, as part of the DigiDestined's plan to stop the fight.\n\nWhen Zoe and J.P. reveal the connection between the two faction's leaders, Dinohyumon challenges their claim, but Takuya counters by asking him where Darcmon is, forcing Hippogriffomon to transform into Darcmon before Dinohyumon's eyes and revive Ornismon. Spurred on by Kotemon's sacrifice, Dinohyumon and Grizzlymon join forces and have their armies weaken Ornismon, allowing AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon to destroy the demon bird once and for all.\n\nWith the Lost Island back on the Digital World, Dinohyumon gives his thanks to the DigiDestined, apologizes for his actions, and becomes friends with Grizzlymon.

He and Kotemon also lead the children of the island when they gather.\n\nKoji and Zoe wind up in the Beast Digimon Area, where Bearmon takes care of them, telling them about the conflict. When the DigiDestined are reunited, the kids begin to take sides themselves, each having seen the war from one side's point of view. Bearmon and Kotemon reveal their friendship to the kids and, as a \"reward\" for not fighting amongst each other, take them to a cave they had found bearing the symbol of Ornismon, the alleged guardian spirit of the island. They are found by Grizzlymon and Dinohyumon, who begin to fight each other, only to be stopped by KendoGarurumon and Agunimon. The divisions between the two camps are wide, however, and Bearmon is forced to part with his friend.\n\nWhen the war reaches a critical point and a massive battle begins, the DigiDestined manage to distract the leaders long enough to reunite Bearmon and Kotemon.

Kotemon begs for AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon to save them, only to be killed by a blast from Ornismon. Bearmon's anguish combines with Kotemon's sacrifice to summon phantasms of two Legendary Warriors, who use their power to defeat Ornismon.\n\nIn the wake of the DigiDestined's departure, Bearmon is reunited with the reborn Kotemon, and they make a mural of the DigiDestined on the cave wall. Island of Lost Digimon\n\nBearmon and the children are depicted on Bo-144t: Let's Stop Fighting.\n\nGrizzlymon[]\n\nJapanese: Kenta Miyake (Gryzmon), Eiji Itou (Moosemon), Kazuhiko Nishimatsu (Bullmon), Nobuaki Kanemitsu (Prairiemon)\n\nEnglish: Peter Spellos (Grizzlymon[1])\n\nGrizzlymon is the second-in-command of the Beast-type Digimon on the Lost Island and rival of Dinohyumon. He is first encountered by the DigiDestined when he wards off an attack on the Beast Digimon settlement by Dinohyumon, who is retaliating from a suicide strike by the Beast Digimon. Later, Grizzlymon comes to his younger brother, Bearmon's, aid when he is being attacked by Dinohyumon for his friendship with Kotemon. KendoGarurumon stops Grizzlymon, who tries to recruit him in preparation for the impending climactic battle. Koji agrees, as part of the DigiDestined's plan to stop the fight.\n\nWhen Zoe and J.P. reveal the connection between the two faction's leaders, Grizzlymon challenges their claim, only to watch as his leader Hippogriffomon turns into Darcmon and revive Ornismon. Spurred on by Kotemon's sacrifice, Grizzlymon and Dinohyumon join forces and have their armies weaken Ornismon, allowing AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon to destroy the demon bird once and for all.\n\nWith the Lost Island back on the Digital World, Grizzlymon gives his thanks to the DigiDestined, apologizes for his actions, and becomes friends with Dinohyumon.

Their leaders are essentially Bearmon and Kotemon. They help the DigiDestined upon their arrival on the Lost Island and reunite them on neutral ground. When the DigiDestined begin to fight among themselves, they stop them by threatening to cry and then bring them to the ruins bearing the symbol of Ornismon, the alleged guardian spirit of the island. They are interrupted by the fighting of Dinohyumon and Grizzlymon who force their younger brothers apart. The children's fear at the fighting is what prompts Takuya and Koji to intervene, though they are unable to prevent the increasing divide between the two camps.\n\nWhen the war reaches a critical point and a massive battle begins, the children aid the DigiDestined in reuniting Bearmon and Kotemon. They, along with their leaders, Bokomon, Neemon and Tommy, help to reassemble the shattered hieroglyphics in Ornismon's chamber, only to discover that the ancient Digimon was not a protector at all but an evil force—one which is then unleashed by Murmukusmon, who fostered the conflict on the island to gather the necessary amount of fractal code to revive Ornismon. Kotemon begs for AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon to save them, only to be killed by a blast from Ornismon.

The residents are terrorized by Cherubimon's servants, and their Village is only part of its former glory with so much of its fractal code taken. Takuya manages to defeat Cerberumon and restore the village. All Aboard All of its inhabitants celebrate its restoration. Lobomon: Warrior of Light\n\nDuring the Royal Knights' rampage, Poyomon bring word that the village is being attacked, and so the DigiDestined quickly return. The SkullSatamon are scanning data here, and they destroy the Palmon who get in their way. A watching Gazimon gives up the location of the surrounding forest's key, only to be killed in response. The rest of the residents intend to flee when the DigiDestined arrive, expressing disappointment that, despite holding the Spirits of the Ten Legendary Warriors, they haven't been able to stop the destruction. The DigiDestined ask they to continue to believe, and the residents watch as the DigiDestined battle the SkullSatamon, though a Biyomon gives up the location of the key after being threatened. Eventually realizing that they can't simply wait around, they participate in the battle themselves, distracting the SkullSatamon long enough for the DigiDestined to get in finishing blows. The residents have renewed faith in the DigiDestined, such that even when Crusadermon comes at the last moment to scan the area, they continue to place their hopes in the DigiDestined.

All Aboard After the following battle with Cerberumon, J.P. and Tommy attempt to find a way back to the Human World, and J.P. bribes a Pagumon with chocolate for help. The Pagumon directs them toward a Trailmon (Angler) who refuses to help them, and then a group of Pagumon proceeds to harass them for more chocolate. The two are eventually driven to the underground labyrinth, where Koji fends them off. One of the Pagumon, however, is angered enough to digivolve to Raremon, which requires Takuya's intervention as Agunimon. His evolution gives out, however, and Koji discovers the H Spirit of Light, which he uses to become Lobomon and handily defeat Raremon, scanning its Fractal Code. Lobomon: Warrior of Light\n\nWhen the DigiDestined receive word that the Flame Terminal is under attack by the SkullSatamon, they rush back to defend it. Pagumon are among the few remaining residents, and one Pagumon is the most vocal in its disappointment in the DigiDestined's inability to protect the Digital World. When the DigiDestined show their resolve, the Pagumon regain their motivation and faith, aiding in the battle against and eventual defeat of the SkullSatamon.

Heading toward the Forest Terminal, the DigiDestined stumble across the village because the bridge crossing the valley is out. The Candlemon attack them for trespassing, accusing them of trying to steal their artifact, but Bokomon reveals that Takuya holds the H Spirit of Flame. Drunk on their power, however, the Candlemon Elder tricks DigiDestined with sleep clover, and they are forced to flee. Amid their attacks, Takuya spirit evolves to Agunimon to buy them some time, but Tommy refuses to be weak. His courage brings him the H Spirit of Ice, which lets him become Kumamon. A Candlemon steps up his game by digivolving to Wizardmon, but Kumamon sees through his illusions and allows Agunimon to win. Afterward, the Elder apologizes to the DigiDestined, as the battle was a test to see if they truly wielded the Spirits.

They are forced to work in the factory generating wind, and they live in a rundown conditions.

When they reveal they are the Legendary Warriors, however, the KaratsukiNumeon hold them hostage in order to force Grumblemon to release his own hostages. Grumblemon, however, is under Cherubimon's employ and couldn't care less about what happens to the DigiDestined. The KaratsukiNumemon free the DigiDestined and battle ensues, except Grumblemon plows through them when he reveals his Beast Spirit form, Gigasmon.

The ShadowToyAgumon contract him to take care of the children, but Monzaemon refuses, forcing them to turn him into the evil WaruMonzaemon. WaruMonzaemon kidnaps Tommy and takes him to the castle, but Tommy's innocent and trusting nature wins WaruMonzaemon over.

The DigiDestined bond with her students but discover that Tsunomon is ostracized for his ability to digivolve. As they speak, however, heavy rains threaten to flood the school, and so Zoe and J.P. work to create a safe spot for the school and its students. During the flood, Kapurimon falls out, and Tsunomon digivolves to Gabumon to save him.

Unfortunately, he is unable to control himself, and while he drives off Grumblemon and destroys his Golemon, he attacks the DigiDestined.
