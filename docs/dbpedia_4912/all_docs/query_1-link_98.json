        "text": "9\n\nMay\n\nKiiyan fun facts, please~ (ps: the weirdest ones too)\n\nAnonymous\n\nparanoid-rhythm:\n\nFirst, let me refer you to this person: tsuminiochiiru​, she’s the mother ship of the Kiiyan fans over here. So regarding Kiiyan’s official stats and stuff, go ask her! She has all the important information regarding Kiiyan~!! So if you want the latest info on Kiiyan, be sure to follow her! >w<)v\n\nBut for now, I would just put in some funny info from him >A<)b\n\nHe’s a big fan of the LA Lakers and Kobe Bryant.\n\nAlso, he likes tennis a lot, a lot of his tweets recently is full of reactions/thoughts on Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer.\n\nIn one episode of his radio show, Mr. Tambourine Man, he described his ideal woman’s height to be “Around 150 to 165cm, because the height would be just perfect when you xxxx from behind”.\n\nHis “wife” is Joy Max.\n\nQuite a number of the younger male seiyuus seem to be rather enamored with him, most noticeably, Ono Yuuki and quite recently, Eguchi Takuya.\n\nHe calls Ono Yuuki “Hobgoblin” or “Tomoki”.\n\nHe is very fond of the Kadokawa Horror Book Collection.\n\nAnother from Mr. Tambourine Man, while in front of a live audience, he recounted the story of how he was caught by his mom while err… playing with himself… He said that while his hand is in his pants, he forgot to lock his room and his mom came in, announcing that some of his friends are in to visit him. After the shock, he zipped up so fast, he almost caught his…little Kiiyan in his pant’s zipper.\n\nWhen made to choose on who between Miyano Mamoru, Kaji Yuuki and Shimono Hiro to “seme”, he said he’ll choose Yonaga Tsubasa, because Wing can totally sound like a girl, but ultimately chose Namikawa Daisuke. And when asked who he would like to be his “seme”, he chose Nagai Val Ichirou, GRANRODEO’s drummer during live stints. lol\n\nWhen his beloved bicycle first got delivered to him, he was so happy about it that he took it at once, for a ride into the streets of Tokyo. He got so engrossed that he forgot that he had work that day, he was supposed to do a commentary on a GRANRODEO DVD and he completely missed the staff calling him again and again on his phone.\n\nHe has a fetish on ladies’ toes and he likes it when they have prettily shaped toes and made up toenails.\n\nIn Mr. Tambourine Man, a fan sent a letter asking Kiiyan if he believes that men with prettily shaped fingers also have prettily shaped err… d**ks. His response was “Yes of course, many people tell me that I have pretty fingers and I have witnesses, like Joy Max and Iwata Mitsuo-san as to how pretty my “asoko” is. And as for my “asoko”, you really should see how pretty (hard) it is every morning when I wake up!”\n\nHe does have beautiful fingers. Proof:\n\nKiiyan gained infamy of not wearing underwear, even onstage, because of one comment he made that he’d want to be just like Fukuyama Masaharu, a prominent actor, who’s also kind of infamous for not wearing underwear, so much that he started emulating him, even the no underwear part.\n\nHis character in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Kittan was originally supposed to die early in the series, but when the GAINAX team saw Kiiyan and knew that he was the one who would voice Kittan, they decided to extend his role and gave him more screen time.\n\nHe’s allergic to cats. And his family’s dog always bites him when he comes home. lol\n\nWhen filming for the music video of 変幻自在のマジカルスター / Hengenjizai no Magical Star, he said that they were emulating the classic rock era and it would’ve been great if he had some chest hair then, for a more realistic feel.\n\nTo ease off nerves during live shows, he and e-ZUKA dance to Perfume songs backstage.\n\nMiyano Mamoru looks up to him, as a seiyuu and as a powerful singer. But most of time when they’re together, they just end up acting like dorks.\n\nIf it’s not obvious enough, he really enjoys messing with Shimono Hiro, up to the point of giving him hickeys.\n\nHe really, really, really hates frogs. See?\n\nAnd check out GR in drag~!\n\nAnd I leave you with shots of his great booty. Enjoy.\n\nSo, ah, thanks to everyone who followed me after my niece’s lovely recommendation!\n\nA few more Kiiyan tidbits, many of which were learned through paranoid-rhythm along the way. Heh.\n\nKiiyan has, at various times, on Mr. Tambourine Man, stated his preference in sexual positions. Girl on top and animal-style are his two preferred, we can assume.\n\nWhen asked by a fan on Twitter if he likes big boobs or small boobs, he said “both.”\n\nHe’s also told fans which g-pan (g-strings) he likes to wear and where to buy them. So fans sent them in to Mr. Tambourine Man.\n\nJoy earned that “wife” status back when he and Kiiyan were doing the KimiNozo radio show. Kiiyan invited Joy over for dinner and offered him a place to stay for the night. In thanks, Joy cleaned his apartment. And in return … Kiiyan hand over his key. Joy still periodically cleans Kiiyan’s place, particularly in spring.\n\nIn a recent drama CD free talk, Kiiyan compared performing live to sex, as in how he feels afterward.\n\nKiiyan will occasionally arrange karaoke nights with Nitro staff. Who find it rather daunting to have to sing after Kiiyan and e-zuka. Heh.\n\nOne reporter (who did a report on Kiiyan in his home town) went out for karaoke with Kiiyan and one of his younger brothers (he has 2) and said that Kiiyan sings karaoke like there’s no tomorrow.\n\nKiiyan is no stranger to being ribald on stage, whether it’s those loose hips, that naughty tongue or … the things he says. At last year’s Y.W.F. show at FujiQ Highland, during Go For It!, he urged the Rodeo Boys to make Mt. Fuji erupt … and for all us Rodeo Girls to make their (the four of them on stage) Mt. Fujis erupt! Not long after, he thanked all the RG for wearing swimsuits, and that he was going to need a shower after the show. At the 2nd G8 show last year, during Go For It!, he called out for RB who were “no pan” and told the RG to stay away from them, but then he called out for RG who were “no pan” and urged Takita-san to go get those who responded.\n\nAt the original Otoko Matsuri, he claimed to have the biggest, ah … cock in the room. Proof was not given!\n\nWhen Kiiyan was first starting out as a seiyuu and he lived in Yokohama, his neighbors would complain when he rehearsed at home. Lucky bastards didn’t know when they had it good.\n\nDespite his reputation for liking much younger women, he gives Val heck about his lolicon, going so far as to say he worries about the fate of Japan… Pfffft.\n\nHe has no qualms about talking about BL on stage, teasing Sakamoto-chan (when he was subbing for Takita-san) or Val about BL things.\n\nAt the Inazuma Rock Festival last year, in their pre-performance interview, Kiiyan was asked about the whole “no pan” thing (where he brought up Fukuyama Masaharu) and the camera zoomed in on his crotch … causing Kiiyan to demand that they apologize to his crotch!\n\nMore mundane things … he’s named for a famous architect, his family come to Granrodeo lives, he feels he’s from the sticks (Ube, Yamaguchi, which has about 100,000 residents, so not tiny)\n\nKiiyan doesn’t think he’s attractive (Zakki is someone he holds up as being naturally attractive to women), so works hard at it. DUDE!\n\nHe will not discuss his relationships on Twitter, and who can blame him? (the last time I remember it coming up was when he’d come home from singing karaoke and was comparing his scores on GR songs to those of the person he was singing with, and folks were trying to get him to say if it was a guy or a girl, and he was having none of it.)\n\nAnd … I know there’s more, but I’m starving and need to run to the grocery store for a bento. I leave you with … my dorky, sexy god of shining thunder~\n\nNotes\n\nShow more notesLoading..."
