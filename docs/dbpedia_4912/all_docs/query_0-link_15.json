        "text": "Re: Born\n\nRE:BORN リボーン 「RE:BORN Ribo-n」\n\nRunning Time: 115 mins.\n\nDirector: Yuji Shimomura\n\nWriter:Benio Saeki (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Tak Sakaguchi, Orson Mochizuki, Yura Kondo, Issei Ishida, Mariko Shinoda, Takumi Saitoh, Hiroko Yashiki, Hitomi Hasebe, Masaya Kato, Akio Otsuka, Makoto Sakaguchi, Kenta, Rina Takeda (voice),\n\nIMDB Website\n\nRe:Born stars Tak Sakaguchi, a fighter, action-director, director and actor. Since his debut in Ryuhei Kitamura’s 2000 zombie action film Versus, he has been a staple of the cult cinema scene. Even if the films he acts in are comedic gore-fests from the likes of Yudai Yamaguchi (Deadball) and Yoshihiro Nishimura (Tokyo Gore Police) he tends to make an impact because he has the charisma and martial arts skills needed by a good action hero. He can act and has shown this in works that stretch across genres with Osaka Snake Road: Snake of Violence, Alive, Shinobi: Heart Under Blade and Meatball Machine: Kodoku. His best role was as a failed-actor given one more shot in Sion Sono’s Why Don’t You Play in Hell? which, if you had to watch one performance, is the one I’d recommend. Re:Born gives him the stage he deserves to show his martial-arts skills.\n\nTak Sakaguchi plays Toshiro a withdrawn guy who runs a convenience store in a small coastal town. He lives a quiet life with his young “niece” Sachi (Yura Kondo) but in the past Toshiro was a super-soldier known as “Ghost” and was a lethal member of a PMC’s special forces unit. He decided to strike out on his own when he got tired of the shady business dealings and war crimes but his ex-comrades want to keep him pinned down and move in on him. To do this they kidnap Sachi and hold her hostage knowing that Toshiro will strike back to get the girl. Toshiro does just that but he isn’t alone and gets help from former brothers in arms and as he unleashes his inner beast to rescue Sachi.\n\nJapanese action movies tend to be housed in genre fare such as sci-fi, horror or fantasy. Think Versus, Returner, Garo, Rurouni Kenshin etc. The films that do go for full-blooded action in realistic contemporary settings tend to be from the indie scene and use the same tropes: foreign agents (typically Russians), lots of fighting in forests, authentic-looking weapons and uniforms found in airsoft shops for weapon porn, flashbacks to combat in jungles, and gunfights that go on for way too long. Most of these elements are thrown into Re:Born but the martial-arts is cranked up all the way and used by experts which makes a major difference.\n\nThe plot is serviceable and forgettable. It uses flashbacks to jungle combat to link all of the characters together in the first half of the film. Despite the set up of backstory the bad guy’s intentions are unclear and seem to be to get Ghost to fight. It is unsatisfying but works for triggering action scenes. The second half of the film gets punch drunk with an extended battle in a forest where 200 men and women are taken out by Toshiro and comrades in a range of fights which vary from close-quarters fisticuffs to running and gunning and stabbings. Inter-cutting between different set-piece kills keeps the film pacey for so long before the repetition of stabbings and take-downs becomes exhausting.\n\nPlot isn’t the main draw, it’s the action and most of it is good. Prolific action director and stunt coordinator named Yuji Shinomura has worked on major video games and films like Library Wars, Strayers Chronicle, and I Am a Hero as well as directing Tak Sakaguchi in the action flick Death Trance. All of that experience shows in the way he films many of the sequences in efficient ways with a clear focus on setting up a selection of goons for our heroes to take down and luxuriating in the execution as Sakaguchi and company pull off some audacious kills with fists, knives, and guns at varying ranges but mostly as close as it gets at zero range. Shinomura’s editing and directing is punchy and quick but legible with the actors easy to keep track of and admire as they execute their movements with what looks like grace and skill.\n\nThe film showcases Yoshitaka Inugawa’s martial art, the Zero Range Combat System – a series of dynamic techniques focused around extremely quick and efficient movements at close range. It is a fighting style akin to jujutsu to my untrained eye as heavily armoured and armed opponents are taken out by using their own force against them. Whatever the background of the actor, whether a trained fighter or a normal thespian, the athleticism bursts from the screen as the combatants bodies are all loose but compact with tightly controlled staccato movement exploding out from them. Punches, knife strikes and weapon disarms are common while grappling and kicks are thrown in. This list of adjectives and nouns might not be inspiring but watching the film and seeing it in action is pretty thrilling to witness for the most part.\n\nThe best action involve short and sharp encounters that take place in everyday settings such as a crowded plaza where Sakaguchi advances directly towards an assailant with a gun in a briefcase and jinks around the crowd which mills about to dodge the shots which strike nearby objects. Oblivious people pass by not knowing they were centimetres from death as Sakaguchi strides through the area towards his would-be killer and dispatches him in a quick and efficient way that conjures up memories of the best of Jason Bourne. Another highlight is the convenience store fight which takes two to three minutes, enough time for a microwave to nuke a bento Toshiro sets up before the clash and then devours after the fight.\n\nThere are a set of great character actors brought in to give what are one-note characters spirit so they are exciting to watch. Prolific voice actor Akio Otsuka (Snake in the Metal Gear Solid games) is the main antagonist and puts in a few appearances but his greatest asset is his vocal presence which he uses to give a solid villain for Tak to chase after while the most memorable of his cohort of killers are played by Mariko Shinoda (Newt), Hiroko Yashiki (Eagle) and Makoto Sakaguchi (Casper). Mariko almost steals the show with her brief close-quarters tussle with Tak in a phone booth which takes the Zero Range fighting style as literally as possible. Hiroko (looking good with braided hair) is a sniper and Makoto is a short lunatic killer and both take Toshiro on during the extended forest battle and each shine amidst the 200 man massacre which the film gets bogged down in. Yoshitaka Inugawa also makes an appearance as an assassin named Abyss Walker and gets to look cool with some well coordinated action scenes shared with Sakaguchi which sell his skills.\n\nI think the one downside to the film is that the usually charismatic Tak Sakaguchi tones his presence right down and only cracks a few mordant jokes usually after he has cracked a few skulls but this is fitting for an ultra-deadly special forces guy. He essays a type of cunning and efficiency that leads to some efficient kills and this makes him an intimidating package to watch.\n\nOverall, this is a good action film that should get Sakaguchi and company more work with bigger budgets so they can really explore varied action set-pieces. At two hours, the action can get tiresome but it is well shot and worth watching to see Sakaguchi fight again.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nHappy weekend, everyone!\n\nI hope you are all doing fine!\n\nLife has been a bit of a trudge recently.

Yoshimasu began composing in his twenties and has since been on the cutting edge of contemporary poetry for the past sixty years. Contemporary Japan seems to be hanging onto the back of a dragon as politics reeks of war, radiation, tsunami, and earthquakes. . . Yoshimasu, who witnessed the devastation caused by the massive tsunami of the Great Earthquake of 2011, was at a loss for words upon seeing the impact of “water” strip everthing away.After the earthquake, and as if dismantling his own “framework of the mind,” Yoshimasu began to cut out words, ruled lines, and notes of all sizes and shapes he kept in his “diary.” He then started to paste Japanese and manuscript paper together to make one large piece of paper, and with pencil and pen, words and colors, wrote whatever what was on his mind onto that paper, collaging onto the paper mailed letters he had received that day. By further adding more color to his work, a new styled diary was born. This was his new “poetry.”Yoshimasu doesn’t simply “write.” He turns on a lamp, burns an incense, plays a cassette tape, and listens to himself “chanting” . . . At times he is blindfolded and at other times he listens to the sound of a rock, pouring ink onto paper.\n\nKaijuu Girls (Black): Ultra Kaijuu Gijinka Keikaku\n\n怪獣娘～ウルトラ怪獣擬人化計画～ 「Kaijuu Girls Kuro: Ultra Kaijuu Gijinka Keikaku」\n\nRelease Date: November 23rd, 2018\n\nRunning Time:58 mins.\n\nDirector: Yasutaka Yamamoto\n\nWriter: Kento Shitayama (Screenplay), Tsuburaya Productions (Original Creator),\n\nStarring:Hiyori Nitta (Commander Black), Yuki Yagi (Alien Pegassa), Minami Takahashi (Silver Bloome), Kaori Ishihara (Nova),\n\nAnimation Production: Yumeta Company,\n\nMAL ANN Website\n\nSynopsis: The war between humanity and kaiju has ended, and a new era of peace has started.

Nowhere is this more evident than with gender roles. This is what Ryo Kawasaki’s debut feature examines through a light and witty drama surrounding little-explored issues and indignities suffered by women who don’t adhere to society’s demand to have children at a young age.\n\nThe film takes place around Christmas. The religious aspect of the season is irrelevant for most people in the country who consider it a time for lovers to be romantic. Rather, the New Year period is the biggest celebration in the winter when people return home and pay a visit to a shrine. That said, various aspects of Christmas are impossible to escape such as decorations, chicken dinners at KFC and Christmas cake. In the past, this seemingly innocuous confection proved to be a powerful metaphor for wealth and, derisively for women who are unmarried after the age of 25, someone who is past their prime. For some of the characters in the film, the season is a sad reminder that they are nearing their romantic expiration date.\n\nOne such woman is the film’s lead, Junko (Mitsue Terasaka). She lives in Tokyo and works as an office lady and she is on the verge of turning 30. She is a quiet and pretty woman, not too tall and not too gregarious, and she seems to be in control of herself. However, underneath her shell, she is wracked with doubt. Unsure about marriage, children, and her future and with no partner in sight she feels increasing pressure to act, not least because her mother pesters her about getting married and she isn’t getting any younger. Indeed, her birthday is at the end of the year, so the clock is ticking. In a bold move, she decides to become an egg donor. If she won’t have children herself then at least some part of her will go on into the future with someone else. If her eggs are chosen by a couple, she will receive a free trip to Hawaii to undergo the procedure and 500,000 Yen. What she doesn’t count on is meeting her cousin at the same fertility clinic.\n\nAoi (Sora Kawai) is a young woman in need of money. Having just split up with her girlfriend and without a place to stay, meeting her cousin is fortuitous and they are soon cohabiting. However, it isn’t exactly smooth since Aoi is a messy youngster who some might consider selfish and irresponsible while Junko is a little uptight. Kawasaki teases multiple inter-generational misunderstandings in a montage but resists making a comedy out of proceedings and shows how the women are united by their femininity.\n\nThe film compares both women by briefly cutting between their routines, Junko with friends and co-workers and Aoi with her ex-lover, but their shared interests, travails and time together are what really mark them and a gradual accumulation of scenes crescendos in an extended outing around Shibuya. Both Junko and Aoi’s voices give their thoughts and feelings in narration that compliment each other, although Aoi has the added complication of being a lesbian in a conservative country. This invites the audience to engage with and enjoy female companionship as we understand that society’s expectations of women cut across class, age, and sexuality.\n\nStill, hidden tensions soon hatch as the year reaches its end. With the expectation of a predictable clash undermined we see that something more insidious lurks under Junko’s calm surface. An anxiety based on the social conditioning demanding women have kids young is shaking her psyche and the closer she gets to Christmas the more violent it becomes and prompts an unhealthy competition that fractures Junko and Aoi’s relationship.\n\nBy the end we feel for the two ladies. Kawasaki’s concise direction positions us in the viewpoint of modern women through well-written characters. Junko is something of an every-woman and easy to sympathise with. Aoi’s background is a little darker, her romantic history sketchy, but she is equally a sincere person, as seen in the moments when she expresses genuine sorrow and resentment over prejudice experienced, moments which make the viewer deliberately uncomfortable in her presence and sympathise with her. Ultimately, anxieties over their inability to conform to some idealised femininity and other issues are discussed throughout in conversations that never feels contrived or like a diatribe. We are immersed in what it is like to experience the constant demand to conform, the pressure it exerts on individuals, and how it shapes their perception of themselves.\n\nA graduate of Waseda University’s Theatre and Film Arts course, Kawasaki has worked steadily on various television dramas and films and she has made several short films. Wasted Eggs is an assured debut feature with good performances from the leads that allow the viewer to experience the world from a different point of view. In this case, it is a distinctly female one where all of the major roles go to women and only one man gets a line of dialogue. Through this entertaining and quietly affecting story, we understand the difficulties faced by women searching for their own identity in a conservative society.\n\nMy review was originally published on V-Cinema on November 26th.\n\nSnake Beneath the Flower Petals\n\n湖底の蛇 「Kotei no ja」\n\nRelease date: 2016\n\nRunning Time:59 mins.\n\nDirector: Rina Tanaka\n\nWriters: Rina Tanaka (Screenplay)\n\nStarring: Mika Kuroiwa, Midori Kimura, Hikari Shinoda, Ryuki Nishimoto, Seiji Okabe, Kensaku Tamura, Hono Miyabe, Yasumi Yajima,\n\nWebsite Website 2\n\nRina Tanaka is a directing talent to watch out for based on the short Filled With Steam (2017) which I saw at the Osaka Asian Film Festival 2018. It was a film that had breathtaking moments of painful loneliness that were skilfully shot that I still remember clearly even as the year draws to an end. Snake Beneath the Flower Petals was at Nippon Connection 2017 and is one of the works she made in order to complete the master’s degree course at Tokyo University of the Arts’ Graduate School of Film and New Media where she studied under Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Nobuhiro Suwa and here she captures the isolation of people in a filmwhich displays a superb sensitivity for translating emotions onto the screen.\n\nYamakita village (I’m assuming in Kanagawa) is located by a lakeside between heavily forested mountains. It is a picturesque and tranquil place as we can see from the panning shots that Rina Tanaka starts the film with but there is a big and noisy event going on. After seeing the setting from a distance we get up close with the opening ceremony of a new bridge and people are gathering to walk over the structure. This is a symbolic as well as physical act because it is known as the “first-crossing ceremony” and it involves having families with three generations, something meant to signify a strong family bond, cross the bridge in order to usher in an auspicious future but the women of one family are undergoing a period of strife where the bonds are fragmenting.\n\nAmidst the happy faces is that of 50-something Yumi Misono (Mika Kuroiwa) and her appearance is of a tired and fed-up person suffering this event when she has something else on her mind. Stood to her side is her mother Kazuko (Midori Kimura) who seems to be genuinely happy but one can tell it is something of a performance as fleeting looks of concern appear every so often and her words are shadowed with dark meanings. Yumi’s daughter Yoh (Hikari Shinoda) brings up the rear and she beams with a bright smile but this newly wed is also putting on a facade and there is something going on with her.\n\nThe film jumps back in time to take us into the lives of these three women, each of whom have different secrets which isolates them and acts as a weakness.\n\nYumi is lonely. She lives with a husband who no longer looks at her and there is a massive lack of affection on his part as seen in multiple exchanges and dialogue where he values Yumi as caretaker alone. When an old flame from her college days enters the picture, she becomes a new person with a grin and a potentially dangerous passion takes root and slithers around in her mind.\n\nIf home life can be empty for a woman, a career can be a trap for someone unprepared for hardship. Koh’s luminous smile masks the fact that her life as an illustrator is tough because her career doesn’t live up to her hopes. Dialogue from other characters full of praise about her success primes us for the gritty reality that market demands ignore her artistic talent but she maintains her facade.\n\nBoth women lives a fantasy of some sort and it helps them keep their sanity. We learn their lies and anticipate some disaster but this story is less about dramatic fireworks and more about meaningful change and this comes from Kazuko who has a secret herself, one that allows her to be open, blunt, ignore custom and be real, and she exercises her experience and genuine love for her family to bring her daughter back to reality and make her aware of Koh’s struggles.\n\nRina Tanaka patiently sets up how Yumi and Koh’s secret/lie acts like a delightful delusion and defensive behaviour through dialogue and dream sequences, intercutting between stories and allowing the camera to settle on actors who show different shades of emotions and then takes the characters on an easily understandable journey to a positive change of sorts through a script that builds up to an intriguing ending. The revelations are real and relatable and there is no sentimentality in the way Tanaka depicts them. Her camerawork patiently watches Yumi run the house solo and it is an emotionally barren space. For Koh, home life is good but Tanaka’s script shows the facade she puts on when talking about work quite neatly by contrasting a dream sequences with reality and we see that facade crumble as her frustrations bubble up. There are other examples especially through the actors whose body language speaks volumes, one example being sight lines which are noticeable when we realise they barely look at each other. When they do look at each other, characters are pushed out of their comfort zones.\n\nOne of the loneliest places to be is in a relationship where nobody knows or understands you and Tanaka shows the little lies and the barriers people throw up in order to get through the day. We see that truth on screen in this story and there is some catharsis at the end of the narrative despite the open ending, the sense that the characters will find the right path.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThe Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On\n\nゆきゆきて、神軍 「Yuki yukite, shingun」\n\nRunning Time: 122 mins.\n\nRelease Date: August 01st, 1987\n\nDirector: Kazuo Hara\n\nWriter: N/A\n\nStarring: Kenzo Okuzaki, Shizumi Okuzaki,\n\nIMDB\n\nThe Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On is regarded as one of the finest documentaries ever made. It derives its power from its subject, a World War II veteran and political agitator named Kenzo Okuzaki who is on a quest to expose a possible war crime as well as the irresponsible actions of Emperor Hirohito, the military, and post-war governments who carelessly tossed away the lives of their people and have imposed a sort of nation-wide amnesia over the wrongs committed during the war including the killing of their own soldiers.\n\nOkuzaki is quite a character to follow. Within the opening five minutes we learn he is an anti-authoritarian who served jail time for murder, for hurling pachinko balls at the Emperor and for distributing pornographic flyers outside the Imperial Palace. He also has a history of assault and has developed a mean moralistic streak. He shows no signs of slowing down at the age of 62, which is when we join him, as he sidelines his plot to assassinate a prime minister to search for the truth of a dark chapter in his past.\n\nHe was in the 36th Regiment in World War II which was stationed in New Guinea. It seems he was always something of a rebel even during his time in the army where he claims he beat up his superiors and states resistance helped him survive. Good fortune saw him captured by Allied forces a year before the end of the war while the rest of his fellow soldiers who continued to fight were crammed into a small area and almost completely cut off from food and water supplies. At a time when soldiers were suffering from starvation there were dubious “executions” including those of privates Tetsunosuke Yoshizawa and Jinpei Nomura who were shot 23 days after the Emperor gave his radio address telling the Japanese that hostilities were over.\n\nOkuzaki wants to find out the truth and so with Kazuo Hara and a documentary film crew in tow he shuttles from his home in Kobe to various places the length of Honshuu. The camera unflinchingly records him travelling from Hyogo Prefecture to Hiroshima, Tokyo and Saitama and interviewing ex-NCOs who may have been involved in the killings. What he gets are excuses, equivocations and elusiveness as the former soldiers lie and demonstrate a convenient collective amnesia and dodge responsibility. Lines like, “it was a military order. Orders always came first”, and, “for the sake of these souls, we shouldn’t dig up the past”, are uttered which infuriates Okuzaki who unearths evidence that cannibalism may have taken place and wants someone to take responsibility.\n\nOkuzaki’s rebelliousness and violence hovers over each interview and with the truth just out of grasp he becomes more single-minded and resorts to bizarre tactics and violence as his own nasty streak emerges.He works with relatives of the victims to force out confessions and then actors to trick interviewees and goes as far as to slap and punch them while the camera crew continues to recording everything. Watching men in their sixties fight each other in bursts of violence is alarming and yet as the awful details of the privations of war and the crimes committed come to light (and we’re talking cannibalism and murder), audience members may find themselves willing Okuzaki on to continue shaking shocking confessions out of men bound to the more socially acceptable action of forgetting and parroting a sanitised version of events.\n\nMany moral quandaries emerge from the film such as how the filmmakersbecome part of the action and help Okuzaki search for his truth. It was shot over a number of years but it is raw and immediate thanks to the way Hara edits the film and this editing is used to almost lionise Okuzaki and make him seem like a righteous avenger even though he is clearly unpredictable and violent. At some points he starts a fight, the action slows down, the camera zooms out while others awkwardly watch on. He clearly uses the camera crew to get into people’s lives and the camera crew use him for material but we begin to wonder if he is goaded on to more extremes due to the presence of the camera and question whether the filmmakers should step in at points to stop the fighting. They do, towards the end, and the most violent parts of the story happen off-screen as we are told with title cards. However, could the filmmakers have facilitated Okuzaki’s obsession that lead him to those fateful actions?\n\nWhat stands out more is how uncomfortably funny some scenes are. The flashes of violence can be funny as we see a formal Japanese greeting upturned by some wrestling as tempers flare or polite language used as people punch each other. The camera records everything without bias and so the absurdity comes out naturally. Seeing the reactions of families and nonplussed police officers standing around scuffles comes off as amusing as they ask in a typically polite Japanese way for Okuzaki to stop. The length Okuzaki goes while surprising can also be amusing such as enlisting his wife Shizumi and a friend to do some acting after he is abandoned by relatives of the victims. Seeing him give a briefing to them about their characters as they meekly look on and then act with the domineering man is funny. Shizumi also emerges as a hero as she puts up with her husband’s actions with the patience of a saint. More importantly Hara, through Okuzaki, shows that the Japanese character is not the quiet and calm stereotype and he has exposed some uncomfortable truths that the Japanese state would rather forget with regards to the way the military brutalised and cannibalised its own people. For this, however violent he is, Okuzaki does come across as a hero for trying to get someone to take responsibility.\n\nThe Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On is a powerful film about violence and obsession.Both Okuzaki and the filmmakers are unethical and unkind at points but we feel their mission is important. With intelligent editing to create a focused narrative and exact staging and interactions to make it as visceral as possible, both the filmmakers and Okuzaki root out the truth from a horrific episode in Japan’s past and pose difficult questions for the audience watching their work forcing people to fully confront the horrors of war. Their work will always be relevant because armed conflicts, unthinking obedience and blind nationalism are ever present threats for humanity.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nOyster Factory\n\n牡蠣工場 「Kaki kouba」\n\nRelease Date: February 20th, 2016\n\nDuration: 145 mins\n\nDirector: Kazuhiro Soda\n\nStarring: Shinsuke Hirano, Koichi Watanabe, Yukiko Watanabe\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nEarlier in 2018 I had the chance to see three of Kazuhiro Soda’s early films which he made as a student at New York’s School of Visual Arts in the 90s and was surprised to discover he started out making a comedy and dramatic short films with well-contained stories and acting. He is still based in New York but is now renowned for observational documentaries having produced works of the cinema vérité variety that look at communities in Japan starting with Democracy (2007). The Oyster Factory was one I first encountered in the 2015 run of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This 145 minute film looks at life inside an oyster factory and as Soda explores this environment he discovers wider issues about the generational divide through the lack of young people entering the industry and Chinese-Japanese relations as Chinese workers are brought in to help keep two oyster factories running.\n\nKazuhiro Soda, along with his wife and producer Kiyoko Kishiwagi, takes audiences into the town of Ushimado in Okayama Prefecture. Here he finds the Hirano oyster factory which is run by Shinsuke Hirano. It is one of a number of small places where local men and women have traditionally shucked oysters in modest conditions over many hours of trying physical labour but due to population decline and a lack of fresh blood entering the industry the workers are drying out. There has been a recent influx of workers from China flowing into the area and although Hirano has never employed any outsiders he finally decides to bring in two young men. We meet them as well as other workers at other factories and get a snapshot of the production chain and life in a fading fishing community.\n\nWith a handheld camera Soda gets close to his subjects and lets them be themselves. Although they are aware of his presence and interact with him, they are natural and so is he. There is no narration or music to influence us, we simply observe a set of characters over a series of long takes as they go about their days in the tranquil port town. Situations involving the mirthful fishermen and their families unfold quietly as Soda follows interesting characters and listens to them as and when they appear. While there is a lot of the daily grind and repetition, a given since we are watching people at work, there is some drama as the charmingly amusing and active fishermen have to rescue a man who falls into the sea.\n\nThrough Hirano Oyster Factory, the outfit hosting Soda, we see the chain of oyster fishing from hauling in oysters to shucking them to market and we see that the industry is dominated mostly by middle-aged and elderly people, the ladies delightfully spicy in their language and the men a little more blunt. As such we get all sorts of views of the Chinese, outright prejudice from one chap to the older ladies offering gentle encouragement to new starters. The quayside is where we see charming elderly people who are open and amusing and tell a little about the area, Soda is also in on the act, engaged and friendly with the people, probing and he allows the workers to put their own personalities on film, some even teasing Soda about his constant filming of them in one amusing sequence full of miming and laughter.\n\nOne person we follow at length is Koichi Watanabe from Miyagi Prefecture, a stout and good-natured “tsunami refugee” who has a wife named Yukiko and three daughters. Although not related to Hirano he takes on the responsibility of running the factory and we come to learn, through hearing his experiences and those of other people, how inheritance taxes make sustaining a family business tough and also see having seen the laborious process of shucking, understand why sometimes kids don’t want anything to do with oysters which makes it doubly hard. One cannot imagine Koichi’s cute kids sailing the seas to haul up their catch as they tumble around deck intent on having fun instead of learning.\n\nKoichi’s conversations with fellow oyster farmers provide a lot of background not just to the local industry in and around Okayama/Hiroshima but also the situation in the Tohoku region both in terms of fishing and also in terms of the continuing fallout from the Great East Japan Earthquake as we understand Koichi’s reasons for being there and the plight of others who have fled Miyagi. On the opposite end we learn of the Chinese and part of the process of recruiting them. At 150,000 yen for travel and training it isn’t cheap for the factories to bring these people in and we hear tall tales of their behaviour but also get to see the Chinese at work. They welcome being filmed and are relaxed and natural and so we see the good-natured side of them which belies the fear some of the older people had expressed.\n\nPerhaps the biggest sense the film managed to imbue was of longing. There is a longing for the vitality of an earlier age when the industry was a bigger draw but there is also a competing longing to escape. The wife of a fisherman about to take over a factory asks Soda about life abroad and in one revealing line she says, “It’s better to see the world than be stuck in Japan.”\n\nCommunities which the young have fled are increasingly common. There is an oddly stifling atmosphere where time moves slowly and there is a tranquillity that can be experienced in the pace generated by the long sequences. This isn’t to say places like this are boring. They are not. They are full of lively people with experience and thanks to the film we get to know the community who teach us about life in their part of the world and that includes Shiro, a cat who hangs around the film crew and provides delight as he gets familiar with his new friends from America, sort of returning the gaze of the filmmakers.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nHappy weekend, people!\n\nWe made it to another one and we are half-way to Christmas (YAY!)\n\nI’ve finished another 12-day work week and I’m feeling dandy. I’ve started my Christmas shopping and card writing late but it is under control and I’m looking forward to having time off work to relax and eat and play games. I hope everyone is going to be doing something fun as well.\n\nI managed to post reviews for two documentaries, the first being The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On (1987) and the second was The Oyster Factory (2016).\n\nWhat is released this weekend?\n\nKeita Never Die\n\nケイタネバーダイ 「Keita Neba- Dai」\n\nRunning Time: 80 mins.\n\nRelease Date: December 15th, 2018\n\nDirector: Tomonori Nakamura\n\nWriter: Tomonori Nakamura, Kana Yamaguchi, (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Shigeo Oosako, Han Arai, Maki Nishiyama, Kaori Takeshita, Yoshifumi Aoki, Makoto Oose, Ryu Shinoda, Momo Takenoshita,\n\nIMDB\n\nSynopsis: Keita Shimabukuro and his older sister Aki are both involved with the Kimura gang.

The tour lasts from February 02nd to March 28th and the theme that connects them all is “love”. The stories address that emotion in a variety of ways through a broad variety of relationships. Love can be found in all shapes and sizes and it can also be an absence. What cannot be denied is that it is a powerful emotion and there are many powerful films that display this.\n\nAmidst the works are stories of couples struggling to relate to each other, a father and his children overcoming differences, brothers and sisters who barely get along, a wife struggling with a husband that has no affection for her, a gay couple who run a law firm who support those on the margins of society and more.\n\nExpect to understand the complexities of Japan, from Tokyo to Osaka and Aguni (an island off Okinawa) and further afield. I’m definitely going to see some of these before I jet off to Japan again.\n\nHere are the films:\n\nOf Love & Law\n\n愛と法 「Ai to hou」\n\nRunning Time: 94 mins.\n\nRelease Date: 2018\n\nDirector: Hikaru Toda\n\nWriter: N/A\n\nStarring: Kazuyuki Minami, Masafumi Yoshida, Yae Minami, Kazumi Tsujitani, Rokudenashiko, Hiroko Tsujitani, Masae Ido, Natsuo Yamamoto,\n\nWebsite IMDB JFDB\n\nHikaru Toda is a documentary director/editor based in London and Osaka who has had her worked screened on BBC Storyville, France Televisions, NHK, The Guardian and at major international film festivals, including Hot Docs, CPH DOX and Melbourne International Film Festival.

It explores the “senkotsu ceremony”, an Okinawan custom involving the cleansing of the bones of the dead by relatives and loved-ones in seawater or sake after burial in the ground or open air, and then re-burying the bones. This ceremony passes on life from the dead to the living and the film uses it to show how a matriarch unites a family even in her death. Here’s my review.\n\nTrailer for the feature:\n\nHere’s one for the short:\n\nSynopsis:Yuko Shinjo (Ayame Misaki) has taken a vacation from her job as a hairdresser in Nagoya to head home. She is pregnant and alone but that’s not going to stop her journey to Aguni Shima, a small island which lies to the west of the Okinawa. It is here that Senkotsu is still performed even though it is a tradition that has largely died out. Her mother Emiko recently passed away and so she will perform the ceremony with her family, her father Nobutsuna (Eiji Okuda), who is quietly devastated and nursing his grief with alcohol while living alone, and her argumentative older brother Tsuyoshi (Michitaka Tsutsui). Rumours swirl around the family but friends come to their defence as the trio find the time to face each other and themselves and overcome their individual hardships.\n\nTremble All You Want\n\n勝手にふるえてろ 「Katte ni Furue tero」\n\nRunning Time: 117 mins.\n\nRelease Date: December 23rd, 2017\n\nDirector: Akiko Ooku\n\nWriter:Akiko Ooku (Screenplay), Risa Wataya (Original Novel)\n\nStarring: Mayu Matsuoka, Daichi Watanabe, Takumi Kitamura, Anna Ishibashi, Kanji Furutachi, Hairi Katagiri,\n\nIMDB Website\n\nA person obsessed with ammonites? How quaint. However, I can’t ready the synopsis for this and not think about the Junji Ito manga Uzumaki. This one was at the Tokyo International Film Festival where it won the Audience Award.\n\nSynopsis: Yoshika (Mayu Matsuoka) is 24-years-old with a fairly unique hobby: she likes researching ammonite fossils and collects them. Perhaps this explains why she doesn’t have a boyfriend in her life. Or maybe the lack of a man is down to the fact that she pines for her first love, a guy from school named Ichi. One day, Ni, a guy who works at the same company, confesses his feelings for her.\n\nThicker Than Water\n\n犬猿 「Kenen」\n\nRunning Time: 106 mins.\n\nRelease Date: February 10th, 2018\n\nDirector: Keisuke Yoshida\n\nWriter: Keisuke Yoshida (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Masataka Kubota, Hirofumi Arai, Keiko Enoue, Miwako Kakei, Ryohei Abe, Aisa Takeuchi, Katsuya Kobayashi, Takenori Goto,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nKeisuke Yoshida is good at dramedies featuring mismatched people or awkward individuals. Sankaku, The Workhorse & Big Mouth, and My Little Sweet Pea which I saw at an earlier instalment of the Japan Foundation’s Touring Film Programme. His latest looks really good.\n\nSynopsis: Hard-working and smart Yuria Ikuno (Keiko Enoue) runs a small printing company. Despite her best efforts, she can’t seem to attract the attention of a polite but aloof client named Kazunari Kanayama (Masataka Kubota). Kazunari really likes Yuria’s younger sister Mako Ikuno (Miwako Kakei) who is attractive and outgoing and a little ditzy. Meanwhile, Kazunari has his hands full with Takuji (Hirofumi Arai), his rough-hewn brother who was recently released from prison and is crashing at his apartment.\n\nPumpkin and Mayonnaise\n\n南瓜とマヨネーズ 「Kabocha to Mayone-zu」\n\nRunning Time: 93 mins.\n\nRelease Date: November 11th, 2017\n\nDirector: Masanori Tominaga\n\nWriter: Masanori Tominaga (Screenplay), Kiriko Nananan (Original Manga)\n\nStarring: Asami Usuda, Taiga, Joe Odagiri, Ryuya Wakaba, Koudai Asaka, Ritsu Otomo, Kurumi Shimizu, Ken Mitsuishi, Sario Okada, Emina Kondo,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nMasanori Tominaga (Rolling) assembles a great cast with Asami Usada (The Woodsman and the Rain) in a love triangle with Joe Odagiri (Mushishi, Over the Fence) and Taiga (Japanese Girls Never Die).\n\nSynopsis: Tsuchida (Asami Usuda) lives with her boyfriend Seiichi (Taiga).

It’s held down by standout performances by Tadanobu Asano (Bright Future, Survive Style 5+) and Shinobu Terajima (Vibrator). Here’s my review.\n\nSynopsis: Dear Etranger is based on a novel by Kiyoshi Shigematsu and tells the tale of 40-year-old Makoto Tanaka (Tadanobu Asano), an assistant manager at a company trying to balance two families and be an ideal father at a time when others give him or are going through crises. Free from melodrama and idealism, it paints a believable picture of the stresses and strains of maintaining a loving family unit built from the scraps of past relationships.\n\nDestiny: The Tale of Kamakura\n\nDESTINY 鎌倉ものがたり 「DESTINY Kamakura Monogatari」\n\nRunning Time: 129 mins.\n\nRelease Date: December 09th, 2017\n\nDirector: Takashi Yamazaki\n\nWriter: Takashi Yamazaki (Screenplay), Ryohei Saigan (Original Manga)\n\nStarring: Masato Sakai, Mitsuki Takahata, Shinichi Tsutsumi, Sakura Ando, Min Tanaka, Tamao Nakamura, Mikako Ichikawa, Jun Kunimura, Tomokazu Miura,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nMasato Sakai (Key of Life) and Mitsuki Takahata (Japanese Girls Never Die) take the lead in this charming-looking magical mystery film.

It has a fantastic cast such as Mikako Ichikawa (Rent-a-neko) and Ryuhei Matsuda (Gohatto, Before We Vanish) but Ryo Nishikido is the big draw for many because he’s an idol. Here’s my review.\n\nSynopsis: Thanks to a government program, the small seaside town of Uobuka gets six strangers into the community. They include a scary fisherman (Kazuki Kitamura), a methodical cleaning woman (Mikako Ichikawa), and a simple-minded deliveryman (Ryuhei Matsuda). All are under the supervision of local government official Hajime Tsukisue (Ryo Nishikido) who gets reports of suspicious behaviour. When he finds out who these people are and their criminal backgrounds, a body is discovered in the harbour and Tsukisue suspects one of the newcomers committed murder…\n\nBlindly In Love\n\n箱入り息子の恋 「Hakoiri Musuko no Koi」\n\nRelease Date: June 08th, 2013\n\nRunning Time: 117 mins.\n\nDirector: Masahide Ichii\n\nWriter: Masahide Ichii, Takahiro Tamura (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Gen Hoshino, Kaho, Sei Hiraizumi, Ryoko Moriyama, Ren Osugi, Hitomi Kuroki, Shuntaro Yanagi, Honoka, Kanji Furutachi, Miyako Takeuchi\n\nIMDB Website\n\nI saw the trailer for this a couple of months back. It’s blend of romance and drama looked interesting primarily because of the two leading characters, one who is an introvert and the other who is blind. Around all of the shouting and crying looked to be a story where and it has some great comedy moments as the trailer reveals. It stars Gen Hoshino (Why Don’t You Play in Hell), Kaho (Puzzle), Ren Osugi (Exte), Hitomi Kuroki (Kaidan, Dark Water), and Kanji Furutachi (The Woodsman and the Rain, GFP Bunny).\n\nSynopsis: Kentaro Amanoshizuka (Hoshino) is a 35-year-old with no friends and a modest job in city hall. His life seems stuck in a rut as he still lives with his parents and there are of signs of him getting a promotion in work or socialising with anyone. His parents (Hiraizumi and Moriyama) worry and so they go to a parental matchmaking event hoping to find a woman for their son. Only one couple approaches them. The husband is Akita Imai (Osugi), a man who runs a successful company and after exchanging profiles with Toshi Amanoshizuka he believes that Kentaro is not worthy of his daughter who is blind. Kentaro and Kaho still meet up one fateful day. Can they be together?\n\nThree Stories of Love\n\n恋人たち 「Koibito-tachi」\n\nDuration: 140 mins\n\nDirector: Ryosuke Hashiguchi\n\nWriter: Ryosuke Hashiguchi\n\nStarring: Atsushi Shinohara, Toko Narushima, Ryo Ikeda, Ken Mitsuishi, Lily Franky, Hana Kino, Tamae Ando, Chika Uchida,\n\nWebsite IMDB\n\nThis one was at the Vancouver International Film Festival 2015 and I have seen one review but it’s a glowing one that talks up the great characters, drama, and originality. The three central characters on screen are a frumpy put-upon housewife, a gay lawyer, and a repairman/widower and their stories interconnect. Non-professional/untried actors are in the lead roles but they are surrounded by character actors such as Tamae Ando (Ordinary Everyday), and Ken Mitsuishi and also Lily Franky.\n\nSynopsis from Japan Foundation: The film is made up of three vignettes that tell very different stories of love.\n\nUnfulfilled and exploited housewife, Toko (Toko Narushima), is trapped in a loveless marriage with a husband disinterested in how his mother treats his wife. An encounter with a sympathetic scam artist offers respite from a life lacking all affection.\n\nAn intuitive bridge inspector (Atsushi Shinohara) had been widowed in a brutal and random murder of his wife three years prior. Grief-stricken and obsessed with fantasies of revenge, his heartbreak sends his life in a downward spiral.\n\nShinomiya is an elite lawyer with an inflated ego who enjoys mistreating his younger male lover. But when his life comes crashing down, he seeks refuge with a school friend he once loved.\n\nHer Love Boils Bathwater\n\n湯を沸かすほどの熱い愛 「Yu wo wakasuhodo no atsui ai」\n\nRun"
