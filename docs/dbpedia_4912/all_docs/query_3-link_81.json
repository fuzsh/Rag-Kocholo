        "text": "Wells Fargo Online comes with the ability to receive and view statements for most of your accounts online. Simply enroll to set up a username and password to access your personal and business accounts online.\n\nIf you already have a username and password, sign on to view your statements online. Or, to change how you wish to receive your statements and other documents, access Manage Delivery Preferences from Statements and Documents.\n\nYes, your Wells Fargo Online statement is the same as your paper statement and is considered an official document. It contains all the information that is included on your paper statements. A printed version of a Wells Fargo Online statement is the same as a paper statement mailed via U.S. Mail.\n\nNo, the delivery preference for statements applies to all account holders. While any account holder can change the delivery preference, it will apply to all account holders. For example, if a delivery preference of “Online Only” is selected, no paper statements will be produced and mailed.\n\nBoth your Account Activity screen and your Wells Fargo Online statements show your transaction history. Here are the key differences:\n\nThe Account Activity screen shows all of your recent and pending transactions for the past 60-90 days.\n\nWells Fargo Online statements are electronic versions of the monthly paper statements that you receive by mail. They include transactions from a set period of time (a statement cycle) and do not include any pending transactions.\n\nFor example: Your credit card statement shows the transactions you made before the statement closing date and the current amount owed. Your credit card Account Activity screen shows the past 60 days of activity, including pending transactions and transactions that occurred after the statement closing date.\n\nSimply sign on to view your statements online.\n\nYou can select only one statement at a time.\n\nWhen you select one of these documents, your device or browser may download and save it. If you have any problems finding or opening the file, check your download folder or consult your device help.\n\nTo print your statements, you may need to sign on to Wells Fargo Online from a computer.\n\nSaving Wells Fargo Online statements\n\nOnce you open your Wells Fargo Online statement, you can save it to your computer. Provide a name for the file using a .pdf extension and a descriptive name that will help you identify the statement (for example: “CheckingMarch2019.pdf”).\n\nPrinting Wells Fargo Online statements\n\nOnce you’ve opened your statement, you can print it by using the Print function in your browser, or if you’ve saved your statement onto your computer, you can print directly from your PDF reader.\n\nWells Fargo retains statement copies for up to seven years for most checking accounts.\n\nThe length of time Online Statements are available to view and download varies depending on the product: up to 12 months for auto loans; up to 2 years for credit cards, home equity lines of credit, and personal loans and lines of credit; and up to 7 years for deposit accounts, home mortgage accounts, and trust and managed investment accounts. The length of time the specific product statements are available online can be found in Wells Fargo Online in Statements & Documents.\n\nWe'll automatically send you an email at the close of each statement cycle to let you know that your current statement is ready. You must maintain a valid email address to receive your notification. We will also send a notification to your Wells Fargo Secure Inbox through the Message Center.\n\nSign on to confirm your email address is current and correct. Then check to see if your email account is filing notifications in your spam or bulk folders. If it is, add Wells Fargo to your address book to ensure that notifications go to your regular inbox.\n\nEven if you have not received an email notification from us, you can sign on and view your statements.\n\nIf your eligible account is not listed on your Manage Delivery Preferences page, you will need to link it to your Wells Fargo Online or Wells Fargo Business Online account. To link your account, simply sign on and click Account Settings through the Profile & Settings menu.\n\nIf your account isn’t listed, please call us at 1-800-956-4442.\n\nIf you choose Online Only as your delivery preference for eligible accounts (most checking and savings, trust, mortgage, personal lines and loans, and credit card accounts), you won’t receive paper statements. You can view, save, and print your online statements anytime, and they are legally the same as the paper version we mail to you.\n\nIf you wish to receive paper, visit Statements and Documents and choose Manage Delivery Preferences.\n\nSign on to Wells Fargo Online, and select Portfolio, then Statements & Docs in the Brokerage menu.\n\nYou will continue to receive your paper statements in the mail. If you want to save paper by turning off your paper statements, click Delivery Preferences on the Statements & Docs page and follow the simple instructions.\n\nIf you have any problems viewing your brokerage statement online, call us at 1-800-956-4442.\n\nA printed version of a Wells Fargo Online statement is the same as a paper statement mailed via U.S. Mail.\n\nOnline Statements require Adobe® Acrobat® PDF reader. The length of time Online Statements are available to view and download varies depending on the product: up to 12 months for auto loans; up to 2 years for credit cards, home equity lines of credit, and personal loans and lines of credit; and up to 7 years for deposit accounts, home mortgage accounts, and trust and managed investment accounts. The length of time the specific product statements are available online can be found in Wells Fargo Online® in Statements & documents. Availability may be affected by your mobile carrier's coverage area. Your mobile carrier’s message and data rates may apply."
