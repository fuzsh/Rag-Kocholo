        "text": "So I realized but we‚Äôre hitting our 3 month anniversary for this game and I figured it‚Äôs time for an update. Since Nier Reincarnation is ending in about 12 days this is now my exclusive gacha game so I‚Äôm pretty invested at this point but let‚Äôs see how things are going.\n\nI‚Äôve hit max level a while back, I‚Äôve completed all the available story chapters and my current affection level as of this post is Rafayel: 78, Zayne and Xavier: 51. The majority of my affection building has actually been from events and gachas. Doing dailies is hardly anything and you might be able to get a few affection points from doing the weekly crane/card games. (Also I stupidly only realized about 2 weeks ago that you can do more than 1 LI per week for crane/card games and I missed out on a LOT OF CHOCOALTES FML.)\n\nTruth be told, the game is not in a great state. I‚Äôm not even talking about the ‚Äúhorrible for F2P‚Äù people part that many people have complained about. I get it, it‚Äôs a gacha, the devs need to make money, so not everything will be free and most 5 star cards will be paid. That said there‚Äôs a couple glaring issues I want to go over that have really not been addressed as we hit the 90 day mark:\n\nMaterials are scarce regardless of your level and it plateaus very fast after your cards are level 60\n\nEvery single new gacha has been a limited run for 11 days or less and has not been added to the general permanent pool.\n\nMany free events only run about 1 week and there‚Äôs a lot of downtime with nothing to do in game.\n\nOnly a couple new features have been added since release.\n\nI will now go through the above issues in detail.\n\nMaterials are scarce regardless of your level and it plateaus very fast after your cards are level 60\n\nWhen you are first joining the game you get a ton of new player bonuses, exp materials, awakening rocks etc. Once you get further in and you have more cards, leveling becomes VERY PAINFUL. It‚Äôs absolutely insane how much materials you need to get a 5 star card to level 80 and awaken it. We‚Äôre talking like 2000. When you only get about 9-10 stones per bounty hunt that requires 8 stamina it takes WEEKS to upgrade cards. So basically you are forced to pick your man and only focus on his 5 stars. This then makes Deepspace Trials for the other guys impossible to complete because their cards just aren‚Äôt high level enough. The amount of stamina you get has been capped at 120 for a LONG time. I hit level 80 yesterday and my stamina has been at 120 for like the last 30 levels. Ridiculous. There is no reward for leveling up your character‚Äôs level. You don‚Äôt even get stronger! Everything is relying on your gacha cards and the affection level with the guy. I seriously don‚Äôt even understand what the purpose of the level system is other than gating the story chapters at the start of the game.üòí\n\nEvery single new gacha has been a limited run for 11 days or less and has not been added to the general permanent pool.\n\nEvery new gacha they have released since February has been a limited run. That means if you don‚Äôt obtain the card in the 7-11 days that it‚Äôs in the pool, you‚Äôre screwed. It basically forces you to spend money and people who save up their gems are not rewarded unless they had been saving for over a month. Even then, your luck may be bad and even though I had 9000 gems saved up for Raf‚Äôs new outfit gacha, I ended up having to spend $50 to get the 2nd card and go all the way to the end of the hard pity. This is what makes the game not F2P friendly ‚Äì but it‚Äôs fine. I understand you can‚Äôt have everything. Still 7-11 days is a ridiculous amount of time. Some people may need to save money IRL from their job before they can just throw it in the wind on digital pixels. The fact that none of the cards go into the permanent pool also makes the Xspace Echo tickets basically useless. I had been saving them for a while, but after months of limited run cards I went and just blew them all in order to complete some 4/5 star cards for the other characters. üòí\n\nMany free events only run about 1 week and there‚Äôs a lot of downtime with nothing to do in game.\n\nThe free events in this game are kind of a joke. I mean the Raf birthday/fish one was nice, the Valentine was nice but then that walk in the park one ? That was so freaking dumb. You literally just went to a place, had a short conversation and that‚Äôs all you would do that day. Wtf? And in between events there is nothing to do except grind measly trickles of materials. The only real good thing they did was give everyone a free 5 star card of Xavier. Things like Core Hunt cost 20 stamina so I basically never even bother doing it because I‚Äôm too busy trying to level up all the 5 star cards I have sitting around. Right now as of this post, Raf‚Äôs event ended and there is nothing new except a gacha coming up. So now it‚Äôs back to login, do some dailies that take maybe 1 hour or less for all 3 guys and then logout until it‚Äôs time for your stamina replenish which is a measly 30 in the afternoon and 60 at night. üòí\n\nOnly a couple new features have been added since release.\n\nThe game is becoming stale very quickly. The only notable features they added were the work/study/exercise where you can watch them stare at you as you work or stare at their sweaty arms (or Zayne‚Äôs PP) as they exercise. At this point I am only doing it because if you exercise with them for 30 days, you get their exercise outfit, which would increase their bond levels as any outfit addition does. Am I actually exercising with them every day? Hell naw. In fact you don‚Äôt even need to have the app open when it does. Just press the exercise button and turn your screen off and go about your day. They recently added more social posts within the phone and a couple new lines in the screen but otherwise nothing. A new AR photo mode has been added but that got boring really fast and the AR camera quality is 100x worse than my default Samsung camera lol. Needless to say, it hasn‚Äôt really made the game more interesting and in fact the most stale thing right now is the combat. The combat has had like 0 updates since release and at this point it feels like it basically relies on high leveled gacha cards with the exception of when you‚Äôre really close sometimes it pays to try to clear something manually. That said, even though I have several cards at level 80 and 70, because they are not the right color, I can‚Äôt even clear Lemonette level 9. TL;DR ‚Äì battle balance is bad and Infold should feel bad. üòí\n\nI still like this game, I still login daily, and I still complete pretty much all my dailies every day. It gives me a weird sense of accomplishment and since it‚Äôs very quick it doesn‚Äôt take up much of my time. Still, I want them to do more than just give us new gachas. Some of the gachas are beginning to feel lacking too because everything cuts off at the good part. Like JFC you gave us kissing in a 4 star card, why does it ‚Äúcut off‚Äù in the 5 star ones??? Please stop treating the game like it‚Äôs meant for 12 year olds‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs the old hags like me who are funding the game with our wallets. ü•≤ü•≤ I‚Äôm not asking for R-18 pr0n level, but man give me something a little more suggestive than zooming faces into the screen before it fades out. I‚Äôm talking about like Xavier Valentine‚Äôs Day or Rafayel‚Äôs Your Fragrance. I know it‚Äôs only been 3 months, and I‚Äôm hoping the developers will take all the complaints into consideration but when I see them continuously releasing limited run gachas and nothing else going on in the game I slowly lose hope. I will still keep playing and re-evaluate the game state after a year has passed. After all, I want to see all the guys giving me presents for my birthday. ü§£"
