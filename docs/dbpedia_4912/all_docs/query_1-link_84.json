        "text": "I stumbled upon a series of posts on Tumblr about “30 Days Seiyuu Challenge” and I got interested as I also love seiyuu-related stuff. But I’m not a frequent user of Tumblr and I most likely will forget one of the days I should post, so I put all the challenges (or questions) in this single post. There! (All of the pictures are not mine, credits to the original uploaders.)\n\n01. Favourite male seiyuu: Kamiya Hiroshi, Sakurai Takahiro, Fukuyama Jun, Miyano Mamoru, Nakamura Yuichi. All of them are prominent names in seiyuu world and they have succeeded in making me a seiyuu otaku (I personally dislike the term “otaku” but I couldn’t find any other).\n\nI love Kamiya Hiroshi ever since I heard him in Durarara! as Orihara Izaya, the somewhat sadistic and manipulative information broker. His character is super annoying (especially when he’s laughing) but in contrast, it makes me love him more (does it makes me a masochist???). Actually I first heard him in fate/stay night as Matou Shinji (which is also annoying) but Izaya is the character that makes me love him this much. So does Levi from Shingeki no Kyojin.\n\nSOLDIER 1st Class Cloud Strife needs a magnificent voice actor. He is Seiyuu 1st Class, Sakurai Takahiro! To be honest I’ve never played Final Fantasy VII, I only watched FFVII: Advent Children but it always reminds me of him. Those glasses make him look super hot. Not to mention he has such an alluring voice.\n\n“Yes, milord.” Fukuyama Jun’s regal voice makes everyone comply to every demand he makes. Yes, he’s the voice actor of our prince Lelouch Lamperouge/Vi Britannia from Code Geass. He also made appearances in several other series with different characters.\n\nMamo is everyone’s favourite, I think. Good looking, has awesome voice (in voice acting and singing), has nice style, a loving father, but an extreme funnyman to the bone. Looking at his pictures or watching his funny videos makes me feel better. Another thing I like from him is how he laughs heartily.\n\nI first heard his voice in Macross Frontier when he portrayed Alto Saotome. I like him after I watched Clannad, he played Tomoya so well that I shed tears like there’s no tomorrow. I like him more after seeing him in Tokyo Encounter, a gaming show with his best buddy Sugita Tomokazu, I find him amusing and smart (he won the games most of the time). He usually voices handsome characters, which is befitting for him.\n\n02. Least favourite male seiyuu: none, I think.\n\n03. Favourite female seiyuu: Sakamoto Maaya, Sawashiro Miyuki.\n\nThis beautiful neesan is amazing. Aside of being a successful voice actor, she’s also an Oricon chart top singer-songwriter. I don’t remember the first time I heard her voice, but I’ll always remember her as Aerith in FFVII and Bakemonogatari‘s cute vampire, Oshino Shinobu. I’ve collected most of her albums and singles, I must say her voice as a singer is pretty as well.\n\nAnother amazing neesan. I think the word “kawaii” was invented to describe Sawashiro Miyuki. She’s also a Gemini like me, hehe. Celty Sturluson is her alter ego in my mind. I like the way she behaves during seiyuu live event, she’s indeed a kawaii neesan. I always wait for series with her in it.\n\n04. Least favourite female seiyuu: Yuuki Aoi. She’s cute, but soon after I watched Tokyo Encounter with her as the guest, I dislike her. She made Youkyan and Sugitan wore weird clothes and laughed at them and somehow that made me upset (even though Youkyan and Sugitan are a pair of derps in real life).\n\n05. Seiyuu I’d watch in anything: Kamiya Hiroshi and Sakurai Takahiro. Their voices are unique and enticing.\n\n06. Seiyuu that always makes me laugh: Sugita Tomokazu & Miyano Mamoru. Both are silly yet adorable seiyuu. You can see it in those pictures…\n\n07. Seiyuu I recognize the easiest: all my favourite seiyuu (of course), Ono Daisuke, Hanazawa Kana.\n\n08. Seiyuu I recognize the hardest: Nojima Kenji. I never realise it was him until I see the cast.\n\n09. Seiyuu I’d rather not watch in anything: none in particular.\n\n10. Seiyuu with best singing voice: Miyano Mamoru, Suzuki Tatsuhisa, Taniyama Kishou, Sakamoto Maaya, Mizuki Nana.\n\n11. Seiyuu with worst singing voice: Hoshi Souichiro. The only song I heard him singing was Kira Yamato from Gundam Seed‘s “Ima Kono Shunkan ga Subete” and I didn’t like it. And Nakai Kazuya. Say no to Roronoa Zoro singing! I like him the way he is, but not while he’s singing.\n\n12. Seiyuu I have a crush on: Sakurai Takahiro and Eguchi Takuya. Hot, tall guys in glasses with voice which makes you melt. They also play games. Perfect.\n\n13. Seiyuu I’d pick to play me: Hikasa Yoko. The first name that flashed in my mind when I read the question, hahaha.\n\n14. Favourite role from my favourite male seiyuu: Orihara Izaya AND Levi, Cloud Strife, Lelouch Lamperouge, Okabe Rintarou, Okazaki Tomoya.\n\n15. Favourite role from my favourite female seiyuu: Oshino Shinobu, Celty Sturluson.\n\n16. Series with best cast overall: Durarara for sure! Arakawa Under The Bridge, too.\n\n17. Series I wouldn’t watch had my favourite seiyuu didn’t play a role in it: Captain Earth. In fact I put the series on hold, never intending to finish it in the meantime.\n\n18. First seiyuu I remember liking: Morita Masakazu, when he played Kurosaki Ichigo (Bleach). Later, when I watched Baccano! I was surprised that he fitted well with his character, Claire Stanfield/Rail Tracer (which is my favourite character in the series).\n\n19. Seiyuu with most acting range: Fukuyama Jun, from the prince of Britannia to a waiter in family restaurant who has “small-and-cute-things complex”, and Sawashiro Miyuki with her wide vocal range.\n\n20. Seiyuu with least acting range: Nakata Jouji. Every role he played sounds the same, like old man, hahaha.\n\n21. Cool dude seiyuu: Sakurai-san and Egutaku. Definitely.\n\n22. Seiyuu I make fun of: Miyano Mamoru. I bet everyone does, hahaha. Well, he’s extremely good looking and his voice is also awesome, but he’s a total clown. Shimono Hiro, too. Object of bullying, every time, every where.\n\n23. Seiyuu that makes me like any character they portray: Kamiya Hiroshi (Matou Shinji is an exception, I totally hate him) and Hosoya Yoshimasa. I don’t know why, but Hosoya-san’s deep voice is alluring, no matter what kind of character he portrays.\n\n24. Seiyuu I’d hang out with: Kamiya Hiroshi, because he loves cat, and Ono Daisuke, he has good style and exceptional sense of humour. And maybe when we go to shops or restaurants they will give us discount (after a bit seducing from OnoD, or threats from HiroC, which is most likely, hahaha).\n\n25. Best seiyuu match-ups: HiroC-OnoD, Youkyan-Sugitan. I dare to say everyone mentions at least one of these couples.\n\n26. Best seiyuu romance match-ups: Sakamoto Maaya-Suzumura Kenichi. They married to each other, in fact. How adorable!\n\n27. Seiyuu who surprised me with their non-voice acting skills: Morita Masakazu. He was a motion capture actor for FFVII: Advent Children and FFVIII. Isn’t that amazing!?\n\n28. Seiyuu that creeps me out: Fujiwara Keiji, hahaha. Sonchou/Village Chief/Kappa (Arakawa Under The Bridge), Regan (Log Horizon), Togane Sakuya (Psycho-Pass 2) are his roles that made me shiver because of unknown reason.\n\n29. Newly known seiyuu who impressed me: Ishikawa Kaito (Zankyou no Terror‘s Nine & Haikyuu!!‘s Kageyama Tobio) and Hanae Natsuki (Tokyo Ghoul‘s Kaneki Ken & Aldnoah.Zero‘s Kaizuka Inaho). Young and talented. I’m waiting for their next works.\n\n30. Favourite seiyuu ever: KAMIYA HIROSHI."
