        "text": "Under Texas law, voters who possess one of the seven acceptable forms of photo ID must present that ID at the polls when voting in person. Voters who do not possess and cannot reasonably obtain one of the seven approved forms of photo ID may fill out a Reasonable Impediment Declaration (RID) (PDF) at the polls and present an alternative form of ID, such as a utility bill, bank statement, government check, or a voter registration certificate.\n\nHere is a list of the acceptable forms of photo ID:\n\nTexas Driver License issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS)\n\nTexas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS\n\nTexas Personal Identification Card issued by DPS\n\nTexas Handgun License issued by DPS\n\nUnited States Military Identification Card containing the person’s photograph\n\nUnited States Citizenship Certificate containing the person’s photograph\n\nUnited States Passport (book or card)\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. Citizenship Certificate, which does not expire, for voters aged 18-69, the acceptable form of photo identification may be expired no more than four years before being presented for voter qualification at the polling place. For voters aged 70 or older, the acceptable form of photo identification may be expired for any length of time if the identification is otherwise valid.\n\nElection Identification Certificates are available from DPS driver license offices during regular business hours. Find mobile station locations here.\n\nHere is a list of the supporting forms of ID that can be presented if the voter does not possess one of the forms of acceptable photo ID and cannot reasonably obtain one:\n\ncopy or original of a government document that shows the voter’s name and an address, including the voter’s voter registration certificate;\n\ncopy of or original current utility bill;\n\ncopy of or original bank statement;\n\ncopy of or original government check;\n\ncopy of or original paycheck; or\n\ncopy of or original of (a) a certified domestic (from a U.S. state or territory) birth certificate or (b) a document confirming birth admissible in a court of law which establishes the voter’s identity (which may include a foreign birth document).\n\nAfter presenting one of the forms of supporting ID listed above, the voter must execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration.\n\nProcedures for Voting\n\nWhen a voter arrives at a polling location, the voter will be asked to present one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo ID that is current or, for voters aged 18-69, expired no more than four years. Voters aged 70 or older may present one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo ID that is expired for any length of time that is otherwise valid. If a voter does not possess one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo ID and cannot reasonably obtain one, the voter may present a supporting form of ID and execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration, noting the voter’s reasonable impediment to obtaining an acceptable form of photo identification, stating that the information contained in the declaration is true, that the voter is the same individual personally appearing at the polling place to sign the declaration, and that the voter faces a reasonable impediment to procuring an acceptable form of photo identification.\n\nElection officials are still required by State law to determine whether the voter’s name on the identification provided (acceptable photo ID, or supporting form of ID, if applicable) matches the name on the official list of registered voters (“OLRV”). After a voter presents their ID, whether it’s an acceptable form of photo ID or a supporting form of ID (if applicable), the election worker will compare it to the OLRV. If the name on the ID matches the name on the list of registered voters, the voter will follow the regular procedures for voting.\n\nIf the name does not match exactly but is “substantially similar” to the name on the OLRV, the voter will be permitted to vote as long as the voter signs an affidavit stating that the voter is the same person on the list of registered voters.\n\nIf a voter possesses an acceptable form of photo ID but does not have it at the polling place, the voter will still be permitted to vote provisionally. The voter will have six (6) days to present an acceptable form of photo identification to the county voter registrar, or fill out the natural disaster affidavit referenced in the Exemption/Exceptions section below, or the voter’s ballot will be rejected. Alternatively, a voter who possesses an acceptable form of photo ID but does not have it at the polling place may choose to leave the polling place and return before the close of the polls on election day with said acceptable form of photo ID to, if the voter would otherwise qualify, vote a regular ballot at that time.\n\nExemptions:\n\nVoters with a disability may apply with the county voter registrar for a permanent exemption to presenting an acceptable photo identification or following the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure in the county. The application must contain written documentation from either the U.S. Social Security Administration evidencing the applicant’s disability, or from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs evidencing a disability rating of at least 50 percent. The applicant must also state that he/she does not have a form of identification prescribed by Section 63.0101 of the Texas Election Code. Those who obtain a disability exemption will be allowed to vote upon display of their voter registration certificate reflecting the exemption, and will not need to execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. Please contact your county voter registrar for more details.\n\nVoters who have a consistent religious objection to being photographed or who do not present an acceptable form of photo identification listed above or follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure because of certain natural disasters as declared by the President of the United States or the Texas Governor, may vote a provisional ballot, appear at the voter registrar’s office within six (6) calendar days after election day, and sign an affidavit swearing to the religious objection or natural disaster, in order for the voter’s ballot to be counted. Please contact your county voter registrar for more details.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat kind of photo identification is required to qualify to vote in person?\n\nThe following is a list of acceptable photo IDs at the polling place:\n\nTexas Driver License issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS)\n\nTexas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS\n\nTexas Personal Identification Card issued by DPS\n\nTexas Handgun License issued by DPS\n\nUnited States Military Identification Card containing the person’s photograph\n\nUnited States Citizenship Certificate containing the person’s photograph\n\nUnited States Passport (book or card)\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. Citizenship Certificate, which does not expire, for voters aged 18-69, the acceptable form of photo identification may be expired no more than four years before being presented for voter qualification at the polling place.

The application must contain written documentation from either the U.S. Social Security Administration evidencing the applicant’s disability, or from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs evidencing a disability rating of at least 50 percent. The applicant must also state that he/she does not have a form of identification prescribed by Section 63.0101 of the Texas Election Code.

However, in order to have the provisional ballot counted, the voter will be required to visit the voter registrar’s office within six calendar days of the date of the election to present one of the above forms of photo ID; OR, if applicable, submit one of the temporary affidavits addressed in these FAQs (e.g., religious objection or natural disaster); OR, if applicable, qualify for the disability exemption addressed in these FAQs, in the presence of the county voter registrar. Alternatively, the voter may choose to leave the polling place and return before the close of the polls on election day with an acceptable form of photo ID to, if they otherwise qualify, vote a regular ballot at that time.\n\nVoters who have a consistent religious objection to being photographed or who do not present an acceptable form of photo identification listed above or follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure because of certain natural disasters as declared by the President of the United States or the Texas Governor, may vote a provisional ballot, appear at the voter registrar’s office within six (6) calendar days after election day, and sign an affidavit swearing to the religious objection or natural disaster, in order for the voter’s ballot to be counted. Please contact your county voter registrar for more details.\n\nWhat is a reasonable impediment?\n\nReasonable impediments identified on the Reasonable Impediment Declaration are: lack of transportation, disability or illness, lack of birth certificate or other documents needed to obtain acceptable photo ID, work schedule, family responsibilities, lost or stolen ID, or acceptable form of photo ID applied for but not received. You must qualify for one of these reasonable impediments in order to execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. A person is subject to prosecution for perjury under Chapter 37, Penal Code, or Section 63.0013 of the Texas Election Code for providing a false statement or false information on a Reasonable Impediment Declaration.\n\nWhat if a voter does not have any form of ID with them at the polling place and they do not have a disability exemption when they visit the polling place?\n\nIf a voter does not possess an acceptable form of photo ID, cannot reasonably obtain one, and does not have or does not bring a supporting form of ID to present in connection with a Reasonable Impediment Declaration, or if the voter does not possess an acceptable form of photo ID and can reasonably obtain an acceptable form of photo ID, or if the voter possesses, but did not bring with them, an acceptable form of photo ID, the voter may cast a provisional ballot at the polls. However, in order to have the provisional ballot counted the voter will be required to visit the county voter registrar’s office within six calendar days of the date of the election to present an acceptable form of photo ID; OR, if the voter does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain an acceptable form of photo ID, follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure; OR, if applicable, submit one of the temporary affidavits addressed in these FAQs (religious objection or natural disaster) in the presence of the county voter registrar; OR, if applicable, qualify for the disability exemption addressed in these FAQs with the county voter registrar.\n\nAlternatively, a voter who possesses an acceptable form of photo ID but does not have it at the polling place, or a voter who does not possess an acceptable form of photo ID, and is reasonably able to obtain one, may choose to leave the polling place and return before the close of the polls on election day with an acceptable form of photo ID to vote a regular ballot at that time. In addition, a voter who does not possess, would otherwise not be able to reasonably obtain an acceptable form of photo ID, but did not bring a supporting form of ID to the polling place, may choose to leave the polling place and return before the close of the polls on election day with said supporting form of ID to fill out the Reasonable Impediment Declaration and, if they otherwise qualify, vote a regular ballot at that time.\n\nWhat if my acceptable form of photo ID was lost, stolen, suspended, revoked or is expired more than four years?\n\nA voter whose photo identification has been lost, stolen, suspended, revoked or, for voters aged 18-69, expired more than four years does not possess one of the acceptable forms of photo ID, and, if the voter cannot reasonably obtain a replacement of the identification that was lost, stolen, suspended, revoked or expired or another form of acceptable photo ID, the voter is eligible to present a supporting form of ID, execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration, and, assuming they otherwise qualify, vote a regular ballot.\n\nMy name on my approved photo ID or my supporting ID (if applicable) does not exactly match my name on my voter registration card. Can I still vote?\n\nElection officials will review the ID and if a name is “substantially similar” to the name on their list of registered voters, you will still be able to vote, but you will also have to submit an affidavit stating that you are the same person on the list of registered voters.\n\nWhat does “substantially similar” mean?\n\nA voter’s name is considered substantially similar if one or more of the following circumstances applies:\n\nThe name on the ID is slightly different from one or more of the name fields on the official list of registered voters.\n\nThe name on the voter’s ID or on the list of registered voters is a customary variation of the voter’s formal name. For example, Bill for William\n\nThe voter’s name contains an initial, middle name, or former name that is either not on the official list of registered voters or on the voter’s ID.\n\nA first name, middle name, former name or initial of the voter’s name occupies a different field on the presented ID document than it does on the list of registered voters.\n\nIn considering whether a name is substantially similar, election officials will also look at whether information on the presented ID matches elements of the voter’s information on the official list of registered voters such as the voter’s residence address or date of birth.\n\nIs the DPS Election Identification Certificate still going to be available?\n\nYes. The Election Identification Certificate is now available, and will be still be a form of acceptable photo ID. Information regarding how to obtain an election identification certificate can be found at www.dps.texas.gov. You may also contact DPS by telephone at (512) 424-2600 for more information.\n\nShould you need additional information, please contact our office via telephone at 1-800-252-VOTE (8683) or email us."
