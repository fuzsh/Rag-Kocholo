        "text": "TOKYO (December 22)--Moe KIYOOKA went to this year's World Championships as a warm-up partner for Ikuei University teammate Tsugumi SAKURAI, but that was never her original intention.\n\nKiyooka had planned to go as a competitor, and on Friday, she got revenge on the person who not only kept that from happening, but had come home with the world gold that she had been aiming for.\n\nKiyooka avoided the mistakes that cost her the last time she faced Haruna OKUNO and held on for a 5-1 victory in the women's 55kg final at the Emperor's Cup All-Japan Championships on the second day of the four-day tournament in Tokyo.\n\n\"I got revenge, so that's good,\" said Kiyooka, who had lost to Okuno in a playoff last July for the 55kg spot for the world team to Belgrade.\n\n\"[Losing in the playoff] was really hard to take. I really blew my chance after getting so close. I had to go back and determine what was the problem and work it out. Little by little I was able to overcome my issues and this was the result.\"\n\nWith the victory, Kiyooka earned a ticket to the Asian Championships in Bishkek in April, which will mark her senior debut on a major international stage.\n\nThe 20-year-old Kiyooka had gone into this year with such promise. She captured golds at both the world U20 and U23 championships, and won her first All-Japan title, albeit it came at 55kg while most of the top competitors had funneled into the Olympic weight classes.\n\nKiyooka eventually made her Olympic bid by dropping down to 53kg for the Meiji Cup All-Japan Invitational Championships, the second domestic qualifier for Belgrade held in June, but failed to depose the invincible Akari FUJINAMI.\n\nShe then entered the wrestle-offs for the world team spot at 55kg, but lost a heartbreaking 2-2 decision to Okuno, who then beat Rino KATAOKA for the ticket to Belgrade. There, Okuno won her third world gold and first since 2018, while Kiyooka went along to help Sakurai capture the 57kg gold and a place in Paris.\n\nIn between, Kiyooka had suffered another setback, when she surprisingly failed to defend her world U20 title in Jordan. She was leading Georgiana LIRCA (ROM) in the semifinals when she got caught and lost by fall, and had to settle for a bronze medal.\n\n\"My disappointment faded a little after the playoff, but I became lax and left myself open,\" Kiyooka said. \"A lot of people said to me, 'It's a good thing that didn't happen at the All-Japan or an Olympic qualifier.' The important thing was what I learned from it.\"\n\nMoe KIYOOKA gets behind for a takedown against Haruna OKUNO in the women's 55kg final. (Photo: Takeo Yabuki / Japan Wrestling Federation)\n\nAt the World Championships, Kiyooka remained dedicated to the task at hand, but deep down the torment of being left out on the sidelines ate at her. \"I had intended to go as a competitor, and to be in that place was agonizing,\" Kiyooka said. \"Every night when I went back to the hotel in Serbia I was close to tears.\"\n\nStill, her relationship with Sakurai, one year her senior, has been nothing but positive and goes back to their days together as kids in the Kochi Club. It also made her opt to go to Ikuei, bypassing current powerhouse Nippon Sports Science University which older brother Kotaro attends.\n\n\"Tsugumi and I have been wrestling together since we were small,\" Kiyooka said. \"She was behind my going to Ikuei. I train with the aim of getting to her level. I try my best to score on her when we are sparring. That's something I wouldn't get at another university. So I feel blessed with the training environment.\"\n\nIn the final against Okuno, Kiyooka gave up an activity point in the first period, but quickly went ahead in the second when she countered a sudden lunge by Okuno and got behind for a takedown. After Kiyooka picked up an activity point to go up 3-1, it became a matter of avoiding a costly mistake.\n\nWith time running out, she latched onto Okuno's lower leg, but wasn't able to finish off the takedown. Okuno tried with all of her might to counter lift, but in the end, Kiyooka stepped over to get a 2-point exposure in the final seconds.\n\n\"My style is to step it up in the second period,\" Kiyooka said. \"I have confidence in myself in that. I was behind by a point, but I believed I could turn it around. My body reacted naturally and that led to the points.\"\n\nIkuei coach Yoshimaro YANAGAWA revealed that Kiyooka was not in top shape heading into the tournament, and praised her outstanding performance under the circumstances.\n\n\"Before the tournament, her condition was not so good, but I'm glad she could endure and end up winning,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead, Yanagawa said, \"The Kiyooka of today has to be looking at the Los Angeles Olympics [in 2028]. She can no longer go to Paris, so she had to regard this tournament as the start and had to win first in Japan.\"\n\nSosuke TAKATANI keeps Tatsuya SHIRAI in bounds before finishing up a takedown in their freestyle 86kg semifinal. (Photo: Takeo Yabuki / Japan Wrestling Federation)\n\nTakatani barely keeps Olympic hopes alive\n\nIn Olympic weight classes in which Japan has not yet secured a place in Paris, the tournament is also serving as the qualifier for the Asian Olympic qualifying tournament that will also be held in Bishkek, the week after the Asian Championships.\n\nVeteran Sosuke TAKATANI, aiming to make it to his fourth Olympics and a first in tandam with his younger brother, moved a step closer by making it to the final of freestyle 86kg, but he still has a big wall to get over.\n\nTakatani was his own worst critic after he eked past 2022 world U23 champion Tatsuya SHIRAI 2-0 in the semifinals to set up a clash with defending champion Hayato ISHIGURO.\n\n\"It wasn't my wrestling at all,\" said the 34-year Takatani, who is also seeking his 13th consecutive All-Japan title. \"If I'm going to be like that, it's meaningless to aim for the Olympics. I'm really mad at myself. It's been awhile since I felt like that.\"\n\nTakatani grabbed a low single and keep Shirai in bounds for a takedown midway through the first period. That was the lone score and Takatani manged to make it hold up as he held off Shirai's late charges.\n\nThe win earned Takatani a shot at the title against Ishiguro, who beat him 3-0 in the Meiji Cup final in June to clinch a place on the team to Belgrade. Ishiguro placed 13th in the world after starting the year by taking a silver medal at the Zagreb Open and a bronze at the Asian Championships.\n\n\"I'm the challenger,\" Takatani said. \"There is the fact that I'm 34. But I prepared to win this and I'm determined to do just that.\"\n\nTakatani's younger brother Daichi already has a ticket to Paris after winning a bronze medal in Belgrade at 74kg--the same weight class that Sosuke won a world silver medal in back in 2014.\n\nSo SAKABE, left, and Masato SUMI square off in the Greco 87kg final. (Photo: Takeo Yabuki / Japan Wrestling Federation)\n\nJapan's entrants for the Asian Olympic qualifier in the three upper weights of Greco were also decided, with So SAKABE pipping teammate and longtime rival Masato SUMI 3-1 for the spot at 87kg, Yuri NAKAZATO filling the 97kg place by capturing his first national title, and Sota OKAMURA repeating at 130kg to earn his ticket.\n\nSakabe and Sumi, teammates on the Self-Defense Forces Physical Training School team, have completely dominated the 87kg division in recent years, with Sumi more often getting the best of his comrade.\n\nSumi came into the tournament with a 5-2 lead in head-to-head meetings with Sakabe, winning their most recent encounter in a playoff for the world team spot in July. Sumi lost in the second round in Belgrade, but bounced back to take a bronze medal at the Asian Games.\n\nIn Friday's final, Sakabe was trailing on criteria 1-1 after each were hit with a passivity call. He was then put in the top position in the third par terre of the match and took advantage with a gut wrench to snatch the win.\n\n\"We're on the same team and we're always thinking about what the other is up to,\" Sakabe said. \"I knew it would come down to getting points on the ground, not from standing. I was able to defend. I made a mistake at the Meiji Cup and that cost me a place at the World Championships.\"\n\nSakabe realizes the burden he now shoulders as he tries to become the first Japanese since 2012 to qualify for an Olympics in a Greco weight class over 80kg.\n\n\"I will be going to the Asian Olympic qualifier as a representative of Japan,\" he said. \"In the time I have left, I want to raise my level a notch or two and bring back the Olympic berth.\"\n\nNakazato scored a second-period stepout to defeat Takahiro TSURUTA 2-1, while Okamura beat Shion OBATA 1-1 after getting the second of the match's two passivity points.\n\nIn other action, a day after joining his father as a national champion by winning the freestyle 61kg title, Kaisei TANABE was back on the mat for the Greco 63kg competition.\n\nTanabe, who acknowledged he only practiced one or two times over the past 10 days, held his own pretty well, winning his opening match before losing a close 3-2 decision to Yamato HAGIWARA in the quarterfinals. His bid for a medal ended with a loss in the repechage.\n\nTanabe said he was inspired to try the double by Nippon Sports Science University head coach Shingo MATSUMOTO. Matsumoto won nine straight All-Japan titles in Greco from 1999 to 2007, then capped his career by taking the freestyle 98kg gold on a lark in 2008.\n\nAt women's 62kg, Yuzuka INAGAKI won her first title since 2018 and second overall with a 7-0 victory in the final over Kiwa IWASAWA.\n\nInagaki is among that group of Japanese women who have been wildly successful overseas, but can't seem to break into the elite at home. Inagaki won her second world U23 title this year, and won previously on the cadet (U17) and junior (U20) levels.\n\nHer only loss to date in 11 career overseas touraments came in her lone appearance at a senior World Championships in 2019, when she fell 11-8 to Pooja DHANDA (IND) in the third round at 59kg and left Nur-Sultan without a medal.\n\nRyusei FUJITA, left, and younger brother Hosei go at it for a bronze medal at freestyle 125kg. (Photo: Takeo Yabuki / Japan Wrestling Federation)\n\nFamily matters crop up throughout day\n\nWith a number of weight classes having siblings among the entrants, it seemed only a matter of time before two would meet on the mat, and that's what happened in a bronze-medal match at freestyle 125kg.\n\nNihon University's Ryusei FUJITA kept his pride intact by defeating high schooler and younger brother Hosei 4-0, adding the bronze to the silver medal he won last year.\n\n\"It was fun,\" Fujita said of the brothers' first-ever clash in an official match. Acknowledging the pressure of being expected to beat his younger sibling, he said, \"Yeah, that's true. I just tried to keep my legs moving.\"\n\nHe said the two practice together and as kids had the usual occasional fight. Comparing the two, Fujita said, \"He's taller and heavier, but I have the better technique.\"\n\nFreestyle 57kg also had a pair of brothers in the draw, and while they didn't face each other, Akito MUKAIDA may have thought he was seeing double when he faced them in consecutive matches.\n\nMukaida, the younger brother of women's Tokyo Olympic champion Mayu MUKAIDA (now SHIDOCHI), edged Haruto YUMIYA 3-2 in the quarterfinals to set up a semifinal against Yumiya's twin brother Kento.\n\nIn a wild battle in which the lead changed hands several times, Yumiya emerged with a 14-10 win, putting him into Saturday's final against Rikuto ARAI.\n\nAnother noticeable name to fall was Hiyori MOTOKI, whose older sister Sakura secured a place at the Paris Olympics by winning the silver medal at 62kg at the World Championships. Like the eight other Paris-bound wrestlers, Sakura is sitting out this tournament, which meant giving up the title she won last year.\n\nHiyori, however, was left empty-handed when she lost in the semifinals Thursday to Iwasawa, then in a bronze-medal match to high schooler Shirin TAKEMOTO.\n\nIshii, Ozaki drawn in 1st-round clash\n\nMeanwhile, the fireworks will start early in the stacked women's 68kg division that gets underway Saturday when Ami ISHII was drawn to face Nonoka OZAKI in the first round.\n\nIshii, the reigning champion, secured Japan's ticket to Paris in the weight class by placing fifth at the World Championships in Belgrade. But because she did not win a medal, the berth remains lone women's one up for grabs.\n\nIshii will clinch the berth by winning the tournament. If she loses, she will face the eventual champion in a playoff at a date to be determined.\n\nShe will be facing an Ozaki who is not lacking for motivation. Ozaki lost out to Motoki at 62kg, then won the world gold at 65kg as a sort of consolation. Second chances are few and far between in the sport, and Ozaki will be determined to take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nThe winner will face Mei SHINDO, with the winner of that bout getting a possible semifinal clash with Tokyo Olympic 62kg gold medalist Yukako KAWAI.\n\nOn the other side of the draw, world 72kg champion Miwa MORIKAWA will likely have to get by 2021 world silver medalist Rin MIYAJI and 2021 world 72kg champion Masako FURUICHI to make the final.\n\nDay 2 Results\n\nFreestyle\n\n57kg (17 entries)\n\nSemifinal--Rikuto ARAI df.
