The standard versus intEnsive statin therapy for hypercholesteroleMic Patients with diAbetic retinopaTHY (EMPATHY) study examines whether intensive lipid-lowering therapy is superior to standard therapy in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with hyperlipidemia and diabetic retinopathy, but without a history of coronary artery disease.\n\nMethods\n\nPatients who had elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and diabetic retinopathy without a history of coronary artery disease were eligible for the study. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intensive or standard therapy. Patients are being treated with monotherapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) for a maximum of 5.5 years to achieve the following LDL-C target: <70 mg/dL for the intensive therapy group or ≥ 100 and <120 mg/dL for the standard therapy group. The primary endpoint is a composite of incidence of CVD and death from CVD.\n\nResults\n\nBetween May 2010 and October 2013, 5,995 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 5,144 were assigned to the study treatment (2,571 and 2,573 in the intensive and standard therapy groups, respectively), and baseline data were analyzed from 5,107 (2,550 in the intensive therapy group and 2,557 in the standard therapy group).\n\nConclusions\n\nThis is the first study assessing the benefits of intensive statin therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia and diabetic retinopathy in a primary prevention setting. Furthermore, this study evaluates the appropriateness of the treat-to-target approach because all patients are treated to achieve specific LDL-C targets by titrating statin therapy.\n\nClinical Trial Registration Number: UMIN000003486.\n\nKeywords: Dyslipidemia, Diabetic retinopathy, Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, Randomized controlled trial, Primary prevention\n\nIntroduction\n\nElevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Previous results of randomized controlled trials have indicated that lipid-lowering therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) is effective for reducing the event rate of CVD in a wide range of individuals1). On the basis of these findings, a recent clinical guideline has identified elevated LDL-C as the primary target of lipid-lowering therapy and has recommended several therapeutic approaches2).\n\nHyperglycemia is another major risk factor for CVD3). The results of observational studies suggest that diabetic patients without previous myocardial infarction have as high a risk of myocardial infarction as nondiabetic patients with previous myocardial infarction4, 5). Elevated LDL-C is a powerful risk factor for coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM)6), and the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy in this population has been established by meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials7). These findings provide a rationale for intensive lipid-lowering therapy in patients who have both hypercholesterolemia and DM, and these high-risk patients have been treated to achieve strict target LDL-C goals2, 3). However, previous randomized studies have included only a limited number of patients with DM7), and the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy in such subpopulations has not been completely clarified, particularly in those with diabetic complications.\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is a common chronic microvascular complication of DM8). In patients with type 2 DM and retinopathy, the risk of incident coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke is elevated independently of known risk factors9, 10). Diabetic retinopathy is strongly associated with all-cause mortality8). Therefore, this form of microvascular disease may contribute to the development of CVD. This concept is supported by study results showing that approximately 25% of patients with diabetic retinopathy had significant stenotic coronary artery disease11). Based on these findings, diabetic patients with retinopathy may need more intensive therapy than those without retinopathy.\n\nThe effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy in reducing the event rate of CVD has been well established in Japan12–15), and elevated LDL-C is a powerful risk factor for CVD in patients with DM16). However, for primary prevention of CVD in patients with DM, the target level of LDL-C in the Japanese guidelines17) is not as low as in guidelines in the United States2, 3). This suggests that the appropriateness of the Japanese target level should be reconsidered.\n\nFurthermore, the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing the events of CVD18). This guideline calls for adjusting the intensity of statin therapy based on individual patient risk rather than lowering lipid levels to prespecified targets18, 19). It also recommends moderate-intensity statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD in patients with DM 40–75 years of age18). These statements in the guideline are derived from the fact that most clinical studies have used fixed-dose regimens, and few studies have investigated the effect of high-intensity statin therapy in a primary prevention setting. However, there is a possibility that more aggressive lipid target levels or high-intensity statin therapy may benefit high-risk patients, particularly those with diabetic retinopathy.\n\nAim\n\nThe standard versus intEnsive statin therapy for hypercholesteroleMic Patients with diAbetic retinopa-THY (EMPATHY) study is currently being conducted to determine whether intensive statin therapy is superior to standard therapy in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with hypercholesterolemia and diabetic retinopathy who have no history of coronary artery disease. In this study, we compare the effectiveness of different target LDL-C levels by titrating statin therapy to achieve specific targets. This article reports the design of the study in detail.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy Design and Ethical Considerations\n\nThis multicenter, prospective randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study is being conducted in Japan in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Japanese ethical guidelines for clinical studies. A total of 769 centers (325 hospitals and 444 clinics) are participating in the study. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of each participating center. All patients provided written informed consent. This study has been underway since May 2010, and patient recruitment ended in October 2013. The study is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network clinical trials registry, number UMIN000003486.\n\nStudy Population\n\nshows the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients aged at least 30 years who had no history of coronary artery disease were eligible for the study if they had diabetic retinopathy and elevated LDL-C with or without lipid-lowering therapy.\n\nTable 1.\n\n1) Inclusion criteria\n\nInclusion criteria for the run-in period\n\nPatients who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for the run-in period.\n\nHave given written informed consent to participate in this study\n\nAge at least 30 years (at the time of giving informed consent)\n\nMan; or woman who not of child-bearing potential during the study\n\nOutpatient\n\nHypercholesterolemia with LDL-C§ ≥120 mg/dL for previously untreated patients or ≥100 mg/dL for those treated with a single statin† or other lipid-lowering drug\n\nType 2 diabetes\n\nNo history of CAD (myocardial infarction, angina, or coronary revascularization)\n\nInclusion criteria for the treatment period Patients who meet the inclusion criteria for the run-in period and have documented diabetic retinopathy are eligible for the treatment period.\n\n2) Exclusion criteria\n\nExclusion criteria for the run-in period\n\nPatients who meet any of the following criteria are excluded from the study.\n\nHistory of hypersensitivity to statins\n\nHistory of drug-associated muscle disorder\n\nHistory of CAD (myocardial infarction, angina, or coronary revascularization)\n\nHistory of stroke (including revascularization)\n\nSymptomatic PAD (Fontaine class II or higher)\n\nUncontrolled hypertension with DBP −120 mmHg or SBP ≥200 mmHg, or hypertensive emergency\n\nNew York Heart Association class IIUM or higher\n\nValvular heart disease with serious hemodynamic abnormality\n\nHypercholesterolemia treated with two or more lipid-lowering drugs\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia\n\nSerious coexisting illness such as malignant tumor, or severely limited life expectancy (patients are eligible if they received no treatment for at least 5 years and have experiences no relapse of malignancy)\n\nRenal failure necessitating transplantation or dialysis\n\nPatient is pregnant, could be pregnant, or wishes to become pregnant during the study\n\nPatient is considered ineligible by the investigator\n\nExclusion criteria for the treatment period\n\nPatients who meet any of the following criteria are withdrawn from the study.\n\nIschemia confirmed by resting electrocardiogram\n\nAspartate aminotransferase ≥100 IU/L or alanine aminotransferase ≥100 IU/L\n\nSerum creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dL or eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2\n\nNephrotic syndrome\n\nSerum TG ≥1000 mg/dL\n\nPatient is considered ineligible by the investigator\n\nTreatment\n\nsummarizes the study design. The study consists of a run-in period (4–8 weeks) and a treatment period (2–5.5 years). During the run-in period, patients received statin monotherapy to achieve a target LDL-C level of ≥ 100 and <120 mg/dL and were assessed for eligibility. The diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy was confirmed by an ophthalmologist by the end of the run-in period. Thereafter, eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intensive or standard therapy. The allocation sequence was computer generated by a data center and stratified by sex, age (<60 or ≥ 60 years), and baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level (< 8.4% or ≥ 8.4%). If eligibility of the patient was confirmed at the end of the run-in period, the investigator contacted the data center and was notified of the allocated treatment. The person generating the allocation sequence was not involved in patient enrollment.\n\nDuring the treatment period, patients receive statin monotherapy to achieve an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL for the intensive therapy group or ≥ 100 and < 120 mg/dL for the standard therapy group. LDL-C levels are calculated from the Friedewald formula. These LDL-C targets are based on guidelines in the United States and Japan, respectively3, 17). Statin dose escalation and switching to another statin are permitted in both groups. Individual investigators are permitted to select the statin of their choice as mono-therapy, during the run-in and treatment periods.\n\nConcomitant treatment with the following lipid-lowering drugs is prohibited: fibrates, ezetimibe, ethyl icosapentate, anion exchange resins, probucol, nicotinic acid derivatives, phytosterols, elastase, dextran sulfate sodium sulfur, pantethine, and polyenephosphatidylcholine.\n\nPatients are treated with antidiabetic drugs to achieve a target HbA1c level of < 6.9% in both groups20). They are also treated with antihypertensive drugs to achieve a blood pressure target of < 130/80 mmHg21).\n\nOutcomes\n\nMedical histories, physical examination findings, and laboratory data were obtained for all patients at the beginning of the run-in period. During the treatment period, body weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, and laboratory data are measured every 6 months. Laboratory data include lipids (total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, and small dense LDL); HbA1c; glucose; insulin; hematology, hepatic, and renal function tests; serum electrolytes (Na, K, and Cl); creatine kinase; and urinalysis (albumin, creatinine, protein, and urinary sugar). In addition, pleiotropic effects, including antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, have been reported to contribute to the effects of statins in treatment to reduce LDL-C22, 23). For an auxiliary report of the usefulness of the treatment, explored in this research, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and high-molecular weight adiponectin are measured every 12 months. Lipid levels, BNP, hsCRP, high-molecular weight adiponectin, and serum creatinine are analyzed at a central laboratory (SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Electrocardiograms are recorded every 6 months. Funduscopy is performed every 12 months. Statin treatment compliance, concomitant use of other drugs, and adverse events are periodically investigated throughout the study.\n\nThe study endpoints are shown in . The primary endpoint is defined as a composite of incidence of CVD and death from CVD. Most of the previous large-scale clinical studies of statins have used coronary artery disease and stroke as primary endpoints. However, beginning in the 2000s, there has been increasing recognition of the concept of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a growing understanding that ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and renal impairment are ischemic conditions stemming from arteriosclerosis, and that these conditions are associated with each other. Based on this growing understanding, we set a wider range of primary endpoints of such pathologies based on arteriosclerosis. This range included renal events, which are rarely used in composite endpoints. The clinical significance of establishing the necessity of lipid control in terms of the onset and progression of renal events is based on the findings of a meta-analysis of randomized control and crossover studies of statins, which showed inhibition of proteinuria and mild inhibition of progression of nephropathy24). Similar findings have also been reported in Japanese patients25). The secondary endpoints are defined as follows: all-cause mortality; occurrence of cardiac, cerebral, renal, and vascular events; occurrence of stroke; prespecified changes in laboratory variables associated with CKD; and safety (adverse events and adverse drug reactions). Primary and secondary endpoints are adjudicated by an event evaluation committee whose members are unaware of the treatment allocation. Definition of events and items assessed for safety are listed in and .\n\nTable 2.\n\n1) Primary endpoints\n\nThe primary endpoint is the combined incidence of cardiovascular events or death associated with cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular events are defined as follows.\n\nCardiac events: myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring unscheduled hospitalization, or coronary revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting)\n\nCerebral events: ischemic stroke or cerebral revascularization\n\nRenal events: initiation of chronic dialysis, increase in serum creatinine level by at least 2-fold (and > 1.5 mg/dL)\n\nVascular events: aortic disease or PAD (aortic dissection, mesenteric artery thrombosis, severe lower limb ischemia [ulceration], revascularization, or finger/lower limb amputation caused by arteriosclerosis obliterans)\n\n2) Secondary endpoints\n\nThe secondary endpoints are defined as follows.\n\nDeath from any cause\n\nIndividual incidence of cardiac, cerebral, renal or vascular event as defined for the primary endpoint\n\nIncidence of stroke (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage)\n\nChange in laboratory variables related to chronic kidney disease (eGFR, urinary albumin, or urinary protein)\n\nSafety\n\nTable 3.\n\nMyocardial infarction\n\nMyocardial infarction is defined as an increase in cardiac biomarkers (preferably troponin or, if unavailable, CK-MB), as well as any one of the following:\n\nChest pain\n\nNew ischemic ECG changes\n\nLoss of myocardial viability or the presence of wall motion abnormality on imaging\n\nIf more than 30 days has elapsed since onset, evidence of any of the following:\n\nNew pathological Q wave on ECG\n\nNew myocardial thinning, loss of myocardial viability, and contractile dysfunction on imaging\n\nIf pathological findings indicate the occurrence of new myocardial infarction, that occurrence will be considered to satisfy the myocardial infarction endpoint.\n\nUnstable angina requiring unscheduled hospital admission\n\nUnstable angina requiring unscheduled hospital admission is defined as the occurrence of either typical chest pains or new ischemic ECG changes, in combination with significant stenotic lesions on coronary angiogram (or filling defect evident on scintigram, if coronary angiography is not possible). This is equivalent to severity class II or III and clinical circumstances class B under the Braunwald classification of unstable angina (1989).\n\nCoronary arterial revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting) All revascularizations by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) will be included, unless already scheduled at the time of acquisition of informed consent. Such prescheduled procedures will be excluded from consideration.\n\nCerebral infarction\n\nCerebral infarction is clinically defined as new local neurological symptoms with appropriate lesions confirmed on CT or MRI (MRA).\n\nCerebral hemorrhage\n\nCerebral hemorrhage is clinically defined as new-onset local neurological symptoms with fresh hematoma in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and/or brain stem evident on MRI/CT scans of the head. Cerebral hemorrhage does not include cerebral infarction.\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage\n\nOnset is characterized by sudden headache and disturbed consciousness with bleeding and hematoma in the subarachnoid cavity or blood-stained cerebrospinal fluid evident on MRI/CT scans of the head.\n\nCerebrovascular reconstruction\n\nCarotid endarterectomy, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery, unless already scheduled at the time of acquisition of informed consent. Such prescheduled procedures will be excluded from consideration.\n\nPermanent dialysis\n\nPatients who require permanent dialysis, unless the introduction of dialysis is clearly due to other diseases (chronic glomerulonephritis, etc.); such dialysis due to other diseases will be excluded from consideration.\n\nSerum creatinine increased ≥ 2-fold\n\nSerum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL with increase .2-fold above the value at registration, as measured in verified testing at onset or within 6 months after onset, and results from hematology and urinalysis rule out other disease (heart failure, bladder cancer, renal calculus, infection, etc.)\n\nLarge artery disease or peripheral arterial disease (aortic dissection, mesenteric artery thrombosis, occurrence of critical lower limb ischemia [ulcers], revascularization or amputation of digit or lower limb due to obstructive arteriosclerosis)\n\nAortic dissection: Refers to evidence of aortic splitting on imaging (transesophageal echocardiogram, CT, MRI/MRA, etc.). Mesenteric artery thrombosis: Refers to evidence of ischemic findings in the superior mesenteric artery (mainly the origin of the artery) on abdominal ultrasound, CT, or angiogram.\n\nOccurrence of critical lower limb ischemia [ulcers] due to obstructive arteriosclerosis, revascularization or amputation of digit or lower limb will refer to the occurrence of any of the following: Critical lower limb ischemia (Fontaine grade IV) with ulceration due to obstructive arteriosclerosis, revascularization (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, bypass grafting), or amputation of digit or lower limb.\n\nDeath: To be confirmed by death certificate if at all possible.\n\nDeath due to events: This category includes death due to events stipulated by endpoints in the study protocol. However, deaths will be excluded if other clear causes are identified in the relationship between the death and the event.\n\nTotal mortality: All deaths will be included. The cause of death, if other than death due to events, will be identified wherever possible.\n\nTable 4.\n\n1) Definition of an adverse event\n\nAn adverse event is defined as follows.\n\nAn “adverse event” is defined as “any unfavorable medical event experienced by a patient or subject receiving a drug. It does not necessarily refer only to those events for which there is a clear causal relationship with the said drug. Briefly, an adverse event means any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease associated with the use of a drug that may or may not be considered related to, or caused by, the drug.”\n\nDevelopments such as a change in blood glucose, etc., aggravation of diabetes mellitus, or a change in serum lipid levels associated with the target disease (diabetic retinopathy complicated by hypercholesterolemia) do not constitute adverse events unless the change is excessive and contraindicates continuation of the study. In addition, if abnormal changes in laboratory findings, vital signs, or ECG results associated with signs, symptoms, or disease are observed, the sign, symptom, or disease will be reported as an adverse event. Laboratory findings outside the range specified in the Study Protocol will be reported as additional information regarding the adverse event.2) Definition of a serious adverse event\n\nThose adverse events that satisfy any of the following definitions will be regarded as “serious adverse events.”\n\nEvents resulting in death\n\nEvents that are life-threatening\n\nEvents requiring hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for treatment\n\nEvents resulting in a permanent or significant disability/incapacity\n\nEvents resulting in a congenital abnormality\n\nEvents or reactions resulting in another medically significant condition\n\nf) refers to medically significant events or reactions that may put patients at risk and require action or treatment to prevent an outcome such as those described in a) to e), even if they are not immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or hospital admission.\n\n3) Definition of an adverse reaction\n\nAll adverse events other than those classified as “not related” to statin therapy will be handled as adverse reactions due to statin therapy.\n\nIf an adverse event occurs, the investigator will record the name of the adverse event, date of onset, severity, seriousness/non-seriousness, changes (if any) in statin therapy, changes (if any) in treatment with drugs other than statin, outcome and date outcome confirmed, causal relationship with statin, and causal relationship with concomitant drugs. The survey of adverse events will be performed during the observation period and the study treatment period.\n\nDiscontinuation or Suspension of the Entire Study\n\nThe principal investigators will examine the feasibility of continuation of the study if any of the following situations are encountered: (1) Important safety or efficacy information associated with the study is obtained. (2) On the basis of the results of the interim analysis, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee deems that the study has achieved its objective(s) prior to the scheduled number of subjects being reached or completion of the scheduled study period. (3) If changes to the protocol, as specified by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, are difficult to accommodate. If the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommends or requires that the study be discontinued, the principal investigators will discontinue the study. In the event that the principal investigators decide to discontinue or suspend the study, the principal investigators will promptly communicate that fact and the reason for suspension in writing to the heads of the participating test sites.\n\nQuality Management\n\nDuring the study, the participating institutions and investigators are periodically monitored by contract research organizations. In addition, a prespecified proportion of the institutions is scheduled to undergo data audit including direct access to source data. This study is conducted under contract among the following organizations: the funder (Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Osaka, Japan), participating institutions, and the contract research organizations.\n\nStatistical Considerations\n\nA sample size of 5,000 patients (2,500 in each group) was selected to detect the superiority of intensive therapy with a power of 80% and a two-sided significance level of 5%. Based on earlier reports in the literature26–29), we estimated that the incidence of CV events during the 3-year treatment period would be 4.1% and 2.7% for the standard and intensive therapy groups, respectively. The sample size was chosen based on these estimates, assuming a withdrawal rate of 15%, and a study period of 4.5 years was selected.\n\nThe main analysis set for efficacy will be the full analysis set (FAS). For primary and secondary endpoints, the same analysis will be performed in the per-protocol set (PPS) as in FAS, and the consistency of results for the two sets will be examined. FAS will consist of all randomly allocated subjects except for those for whom efficacy endpoints were not observed. PPS will consist of FAS less nonqualifying cases, untreated cases, protocol violations, and noncompliance cases. The safety analysis set will consist of those subjects who receive the study treatment at least once and from whom any information pertaining to safety is obtained. In all analyses, each subject will be included in the allocation group.\n\nA log-rank test, stratified by sex, age, and baseline HbA1c, will be used to compare the primary endpoint between the treatment groups. The hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated using the stratified Cox proportional hazards model. During the study, an interim analysis is planned once at a prespecified time point adjusted by the Lan-DeMets α spending function with O'Brien-Fleming boundaries. Results of the interim analysis are to be assessed by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee.\n\nResults\n\nshows a flow chart of the study patients. Between May 2010 and October 2013, 5,995 patients were enrolled into the run-in period, and 5,144 patients were randomized to treatment (2,571 to the intensive therapy group and 2,573 to the standard therapy group). Of that number, 37 were excluded from analysis because of unavailability of baseline information; reasons included data loss due to the major earthquake in eastern Japan in March 2011, major deviations from study ethics, and withdrawal of patient consent. The analysis population was thus 5,107 patients (2,550 in the intensive therapy group and 2,557 in the standard therapy group).\n\nThe baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled into the treatment period are shown in . The baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups. Mean LDL-C levels decreased from the run-in period to the beginning of the treatment period in both groups. Retinopathic complications were present in less than 100% of subjects because 20 subjects had previously undergone laser therapy for retinopathy and 8 subjects were erroneously registered as having retinopathy at the time of enrollment. Those patients were included in the FAS analysis.\n\nTable 5.\n\nIntensive therapy group (n = 2,550) n (%)Standard therapy group (n = 2,557) n (%)Sex, Male1,213 (47.6%)1,219 (47.7%)Age (mean ± SD)63.0 ± 10.863.2 ± 10.4Body mass index (kg/m2) (mean ± SD)25.69 ± 4.2525.59 ± 4.36Anti-hyperlipidemia medicine§ None1,122 (44.0%)1,053 (41.2%) One drug1,421 (55.7%)1,501 (58.7%) Two drugs7 (0.3%)3 (0.1%)Smoking†465 (18.2%)490 (19.2%)Family history of CAD326 (12.8%)318 (12.4%)Family history of cerebrovascular disease497 (19.5%)531 (20.8%)Duration of diabetes (yr, mean ± SD)12.8 ± 8.613.0 ± 9.0Diabetic complication Retinopathy2,543 (99.7%)2,546 (99.6%) Neuropathy756 (29.6%)764 (29.9%) Nephropathy1,320 (51.8%)1,270 (49.7%)Hypertension1,769 (69.4%)1,791 (70.0%)PAD117 (4.6%)98 (3.8%)Funduscopy Simple retinopathy1,706 (66.9%)1,692 (66.2%) Preproliferative retinopathy424 (16.6%)480 (18.8%) Proliferative retinopathy396 (15.5%)368 (14.4%)Hemoglobin A1c (%)6 [mean ± SD (n)]7.77 ± 1.27 (2,550)7.77 ± 1.25 (2,557)LDL-C (mg/dL)‖ [mean ± SD (n)] Beginning of the run-in period§§ Patients who had not received lipid-lowering therapy previously143.1 ± 23.5 (714)140.4 ± 22.9 (666) Patients who had received previous therapy120.5 ± 22.1 (917)120.9 ± 23.5 (958) Beginning of the treatment period Patients who had not received lipid-lowering therapy previously98.4 ± 25.8 (1,101)97.7 ± 24.6 (1,033) Patients who had received previous therapy112.3 ± 25.8 (1,398)112.0 ± 25.0 (1,460) All106.2 ± 26.7 (2,499)106.0 ± 25.8 (2,493)SBP (mmHg)†† [mean ± SD (n)]134.7 ± 16.9 (2,526)134.5 ± 16.2 (2,536)DBP (mmHg)†† [mean ± SD (n)]74.9 ± 11.6 (2,526)74.7 ± 11.1 (2,536)\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nWe are conducting this study to determine whether intensive statin therapy is superior to standard therapy in reducing CV events in patients who have hypercholesterolemia and diabetic retinopathy in a primary prevention setting.\n\nAlthough the risk of CV events is as high in diabetic patients with no previous history of CV events as in nondiabetic patients with previous myocardial infarction4, 5), few studies have investigated the benefits of intensive statin therapy for the primary prevention of CVD in these high-risk patients, especially those with diabetic complications. In previous randomized controlled trials that assessed the benefits of intensive therapy, only a limited proportion of patients with DM were included, and the studies assessed the benefits of statins in secondary prevention30–34). Thus, the benefits of intensive therapy for primary prevention in high-risk patients remain poorly elucidated. It may be desirable to reconsider the currently recommended lipid-lowering targets in Japan, in light of international recommendations based on the study results described above.\n\nThere is also clear evidence that diabetic patients with retinopathy have a higher risk of CVD than those without retinopathy. In the previous cohort studies in patients with type 2 DM, the presence of diabetic retinopathy was associated with a higher risk of incident coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke9, 10). To our knowledge, however, no studies have assessed the effectiveness of statin therapy in this subpopulation. Our results will add new findings to the existing data, because approximately 5,000 patients with diabetic retinopathy will be followed for 2–5.5 years.\n\nIn our study, we treat all patients to achieve specific LDL-C targets by titrating statin therapy instead of using fixed-dose regimens. In other words, we aim to compare the effectiveness of different LDL-C targets. Recently, the 2013 ACC/AHA Task Force Guideline was unable to find evidence to support titrating statin therapy to achieve LDL-C targets, because most clinical studies confirming the effectiveness of statins have used fixed-dose regimens18). However, the treat-to-target approach was recommended in a guideline from the Adult Treatment Panel III2) and a related Japanese guideline also adopted this approach17). Under these circumstances, it is worthwhile to conduct a clinical study to determine the appropriateness of the treat-to-target approach.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of study records, a prespecified proportion of the institutions are scheduled to undergo data audit including direct access to source data. Although data audit should be conducted in all interventional clinical trials, it has been omitted in some Japanese clinical trials except for those aimed at new drug applications. Especially in large-scale, longterm trials in patients with chronic disease, data audit has seldom been scheduled. Thus, our results may also give some insights into the quality of clinical trials in Japan.\n\nWithin the category of baseline characteristics, mean LDL-C levels decreased during the run-in period in both groups.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the first study assessing the benefits of intensive statin therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia and diabetic retinopathy who do not have a history of coronary artery disease. It also evaluates the appropriateness of the treat-to-target approach by titrating statin therapy to achieve specific LDL-C targets.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe study is funded by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.
