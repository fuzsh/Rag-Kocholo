Please note that this privacy statement will regularly be updated to reflect any changes in the way we handle your personal data or any changes in applicable laws.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, this privacy statement applies to all of Accenture’s externally facing applications, services, games, tools, websites and other data processing activities where Accenture is acting as a data controller (or any local equivalent).\n\nIf you are a California or Texas resident, please see our specific privacy statement for California and the Privacy Supplement for Texas residents below.\n\nIf you are a California or Texas resident, you have specific privacy rights under California and Texas law. You can opt-out here from any selling of your personal information.\n\nIn case you have special accessibility needs to access the content of this statement, we recommend that you or someone on your behalf, consult our Accessibility Statement and recommendations.\n\nThis page and its sub-pages tell you everything you need to know about how Accenture PLC and/or its affiliates, subsidiaries and newly acquired companies (\"Accenture\"; \"we\") protect the personal data we process and control relating to you (“your personal data”; \"your data\") and which rights you have in relation to the processing of your personal data.\n\nIf the Accenture entity acting as the controller of your personal data is located outside the European Union and Switzerland, if applicable, Accenture Global Holdings Limited will represent it in data privacy matters.\n\nBelow, we first give a general description of how Accenture protects your personal data. Further below, we also include specific information on the following:\n\nHow do we use personal data when you visit Accenture’s website?\n\nHow do we use cookies (and other tracking technologies)?\n\nHow do we use personal data when you visit our offices?\n\nHow do we use personal data for marketing purposes?\n\nWe also may derive inferences about you based on the information described above and also collect other information about you as described in this privacy statement. If you provide us with personal information of another person (for instance, a potential employee/referral), you are responsible for ensuring that such person is made aware of the information contained in this privacy statement and that the person has given you his/her consent for sharing the information with Accenture.\n\nThe above-mentioned categories of personal data have been obtained either directly from you (for example, when you provide information to sign up for a newsletter or register to comment on a forum website) or indirectly from certain third parties (for example, through our website’s technology). Such third parties include our affiliates, public authorities, public websites and social media, suppliers, clients and vendors. Except where certain information is required by law or by Accenture policies (including management of an employment relationship with Accenture), your decision to provide any personal data to us is voluntary. Please note that if you do not provide certain information, we may not be able to accomplish some or all of the purposes outlined in this privacy statement, and you may not be able to use certain tools and systems which require the use of such personal data.\n\nWill we share your personal data with third parties?\n\nWe may transfer personal data to our service providers and professional advisors, public and governmental authorities, Accenture companies/affiliates or third parties in connection with Accenture’s operation of its business, including any (potential) corporate or commercial transaction and including clients if the data has been processed to provide client services. Such third parties may be located in other countries. Before we do so, we shall take the necessary steps to ensure that your personal data will be given adequate protection as required by relevant data privacy laws and Accenture’s internal policies. Accenture may also transfer your personal data to any of its global affiliates/partners in furtherance of any visits to our Accenture locations.\n\nFor example, we may disclose personal information to third parties for other business purposes as follows:\n\nWe share your information with third-party service providers that provide services to us, including billing, payment processing, customer service, email deployment, advertising and marketing, security and performance monitoring, maintaining or servicing accounts, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, research, data hosting, auditing, and data processing;\n\nTo protect and defend the legal rights, safety, and security of Accenture, our affiliates, users, or the public, including to protect against fraud and malicious activity; and\n\nFor other business purposes described in this privacy statement or for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or pursuant to your consent.\n\nWe may also share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a website, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, initial public offering, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy.\n\nUnless you are otherwise notified, any transfers of your personal data from within the European Economic Area (EEA) to third parties outside the EEA will be based on an adequacy decision or are governed by the standard contractual clauses (a copy of which can be obtained through the contact information included below). Any other non-EEA related transfers of your personal data will take place in accordance with the appropriate international data transfer mechanisms and standards.\n\nWhich rights do you have with respect to the processing of your personal data?\n\nYou are entitled (in the circumstances and under the conditions, and subject to the exceptions, set out in applicable law) to:\n\nRequest access to the personal data we process about you: this right entitles you to know whether we hold personal data about you and, if we do, to obtain information on and a copy of that personal data.\n\nRequest a rectification of your personal data: this right entitles you to have your personal data be corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nObject to the processing of your personal data: this right entitles you to request that Accenture no longer processes your personal data.\n\nRequest the erasure of your personal data: this right entitles you to request the erasure of your personal data, including where such personal data would no longer be necessary to achieve the purposes.\n\nRequest the restriction of the processing of your personal data: this right entitles you to request that Accenture only processes your personal data in limited circumstances, including with your consent.\n\nRequest portability of your personal data: this right entitles you to receive a copy (in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format) of personal data that you have provided to Accenture, or request Accenture to transmit such personal data to another data controller.\n\nTo the extent the processing of your personal data falls in scope of our BCR, you may also want to review your rights under our BCR.\n\nTo the extent that the processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time by contacting Accenture’s Data Privacy Officer. Please note that this will not affect Accenture’s right to process personal data obtained prior to the withdrawal of your consent, or its right to continue parts of the processing based on other legal bases than your consent.\n\nIf, despite our commitment and efforts to protect your personal data, you believe that your data privacy rights have been violated, we encourage and welcome individuals to come to Accenture first to seek resolution of any complaint. You have the right at all times to register a complaint directly with the relevant supervisory authority or to make a claim against Accenture with a competent court (either in the country where you live, the country where you work or the country where you deem that data privacy law has been infringed).\n\nContact us to exercise any of your rights.\n\nIf you would like to exercise your erasure, rectification, or access rights in reference to your data as a job applicant, you may also click here. Any other rights can be exercised by contacting us.\n\nWe also may derive inferences about you based on the information described above and also collect other information about you as described in this privacy statement. If you provide us with personal information of another person (for instance, a potential employee/referral), you are responsible for ensuring that such person is made aware of the information contained in this privacy statement and that the person has given you his/her consent for sharing the information with Accenture.\n\nThe above-mentioned categories of personal data have been obtained either directly from you (for example, when you provide information to sign up for a newsletter or register to comment on a forum website) or indirectly from certain third parties (for example, through our website’s technology).

Where the above table states that we rely on our legitimate interests for a given purpose, we are of the opinion that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests, rights or freedoms, given (i) the transparency we provide on the processing activity, (ii) our privacy by design approach, (iii) our regular privacy reviews and (iv) the rights you have in relation to the processing activity. If you wish to obtain further information on this balancing test approach, please contact Accenture’s Data Privacy Officer.\n\nWe will process your personal data for the purposes mentioned above based on your prior consent, to the extent such consent is mandatory under applicable laws.\n\nTo the extent you are asked to click on/check \"I accept\", \"I agree\" or similar buttons/checkboxes/functionalities in relation to a privacy statement, doing so will be considered as providing your consent to process your personal data, only in the countries where such consent is required by mandatory law. In all other countries, such action will be considered as a mere acknowledgement and the legal basis of the processing of your personal data will not be your consent but any other applicable legal basis.\n\nWe will not use your personal data for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes of which you have been informed, unless it is required or authorized by law, or it is in your own vital interest (e.g. in case of a medical emergency) to do so.\n\nWhere we maintain or use deidentified information, we will continue to maintain and use that information only in a deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information.\n\nWhich rights do you have with respect to the processing of your personal information?\n\nYou may be entitled, where provided for under applicable law, to:\n\nRequest access to the personal information we process about you: this right entitles you to know whether we hold personal information about you and, if we do, to obtain information on and a copy of the specific pieces and categories of personal information.\n\nRequest a rectification of your personal information: this right entitles you to have your personal information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nObject to the processing of your personal information: this right entitles you to request that Accenture no longer processes your personal information.\n\nRequest the erasure or deletion of your personal information: this right entitles you to request the erasure or deletion of your personal information, including where such personal information would no longer be necessary to achieve the purposes.\n\nRequest the restriction of the processing of your personal information: this right entitles you to request that Accenture only processes your personal information in limited circumstances, including with your consent.\n\nRequest portability of your personal information: this right entitles you to receive a copy (in a portable and, if technically feasible, readily usable format) of your personal information, or request Accenture to transmit such personal information to another data controller.\n\nCalifornia law provides California residents with the right to receive a privacy notice with information about what we have collected, disclosed for business purposes, and sold during the preceding 12 months. This Accenture Privacy Statement for California Residents provides information about the categories of information that we have collected, the sources of that information, the purposes for which we have used the information, and the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed the information for business purposes.\n\nCalifornia law also affords California residents a right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information. This right is applicable to the extent that Accenture is engaging in a “sale” of your personal information as that term is defined under applicable law. While Accenture generally is not in the business of selling information, there are limited circumstances where we share personal information with our clients, third-party partners, or others that we treat as a sale for which California residents have the right to opt out. We do not sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.\n\nIf you choose to exercise your rights, we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your personal information or otherwise permitted by law.

For this reporting period, Accenture does not qualify for the CCPA 11 CCR § 999.317(g) reporting requirement.\n\nAccenture may offer certain financial incentives for the collection, sale, or deletion of personal information. Where we would do so, we will provide California residents additional information where required by California law.\n\nTo the extent that the processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time by contacting .
