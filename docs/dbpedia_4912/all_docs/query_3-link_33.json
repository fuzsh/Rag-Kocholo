Through data collection tools\n\nWhen permitted or you have provided consent, Moderna automatically will collect information about use of the Services through data collection tools, such as web beacons and cookies. A \"web beacon\" is a piece of code that enables us to monitor user activity and website traffic. A \"cookie\" is a randomly generated unique numeric code stored in the user’s web browser settings or computer’s hard drive. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires), as well as the randomly generated unique numeric code.\n\nFor more details, please see .\n\nWe use the information collected through data collection tools to monitor usage patterns, store information about user preferences and to improve the Services. For example, your Personal Data may be used to create customized offers, information and services tailored to your interests and preferences.

Moderna reserves the right to request that you provide information that will enable us to confirm that the User Contribution that you want removed was created and posted by you.\n\nModerna will make a good faith effort to delete or remove your User Contribution from public view as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note, however, that your request that we delete your User Contribution does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your User Contribution. Your User Contribution may remain on backup media, cached or otherwise retained by Moderna for administrative or legal purposes, or your User Contribution may remain publicly available if you or someone else has forwarded or re-posted your User Contribution on another website or service prior to its deletion. Moderna may also be required by law to not remove (or allow removal) of your User Contribution.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits individual California residents to request certain information regarding Moderna’s disclosure of personal data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please write or send an email to the address below.\n\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act - Notice for California Residents\n\nIf you are a California resident, this Privacy Notice supplements the information above regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal data.\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) gives California consumers the right to know what personal data is collected about them, how it will be used and to whom it is disclosed. California consumers may have the right to request access to and deletion of their personal data, and the right to request that their personal data not be sold to the extent applicable under the CCPA.\n\nThe purpose of this notice is to describe our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of personal data and instructions for submitting CCPA data privacy requests. Some of the Personal Data that we collect, use, and disclose may be exempt from the CCPA because it is regulated by other federal and state laws that apply to us.\n\nWe collect personal data from you when you interact with us online (through our Site, our other websites, Apps and Services) or offline (such as through your health care providers, if you are a patient, with your authorization as applicable.) The personal data we may collect from you will depend on the nature of our interaction with you, but can include the following categories that we have collected in the preceding twelve (12) months:\n\nYour Rights\n\nCalifornia residents are provided specific rights subject to certain exceptions.\n\nThe Right to Know. You have the right to request that we disclose what personal data we collect, use, disclose, and sell. The process for exercising this right is describe below under How to Submit a Data Privacy Request.\n\nThe Right to Deletion. You have the right to request deletion of any personal data about you that we have collected from you. The process for exercising this right is describe below under How to Submit a Data Privacy Request\n\nThe Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal data.\n\nThe Right to Non-Discrimination. You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your rights.\n\nHow to Submit a Data Privacy Request\n\nYou may exercise your Right to Know and Right to Deletion by visiting our or calling (844) 971-2551.\n\nTo process your request for access or deletion, we must be able to verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty. We will ask you to provide your contact information and additional identifiers based on your relationship with us.\n\nYou may designate an authorized agent to make a request to access, delete, or opt-out of the sale of your information on your behalf. When you use an authorized agent to submit a request for access or deletion, you must provide the authorized agent with written permission to do so, and, in certain circumstances, we may ask you to verify your own identity directly with us. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.\n\nRight to Know:\n\nPlease note that we may not be required to provide you access to the specific pieces of information we have collected about you or delete information if we are unable to verify your identity.\n\nRight to Delete:\n\nWe may not be required to delete information under certain circumstances. Specifically, the CCPA includes exemptions that provide that we do not have to delete data that, for example, is necessary to comply with legal obligations including those pertaining to the quality, safety or effectiveness of a product or activity regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), complete a transaction, detect security incidents, or for certain other internal purposes.\n\nSale or Disclosure of Personal data: The CCPA defines “sale” broadly to include sharing, transferring, disclosing or otherwise communicating personal data with a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. We share personal data with service providers who work on our behalf and agree not to use or sell your personal data for other purposes or if you have intentionally directed us to share information with a third party. In addition, with your approval, we share certain internet tracking data, including cookies and the IP address used to access our websites.\n\nNotice of Financial Incentive:\n\nModerna does not offer financial incentives in exchange for the collection or sale of personal data. However, we do provide discounts and incentives to individuals who use our products and services and enroll in incentive programs that we offer from time to time; enrolling in these programs requires you to provide certain of your personal data so that we may administer the programs and, in some cases, provide marketing and advertising to you. Under CCPA, this could be considered an offer of a “financial incentive” and so we provide this notice to you to describe our practice and to provide a good faith estimate of the value of your personal data that we may collect related to the programs.\n\nIn the normal course of our business, we do not assign monetary or other value to personal data, but in accordance with CCPA, we make a good faith estimate that the value of the personal data collected and used is equivalent to the value of the discount or financial incentive we provide in these programs. To make this good faith estimate, we may consider among other factors, the (i) categories of personal data collected, (ii) the discount or incentive offered, (iii) the sales or use of our products and services by those who enroll versus those who do not, and (iv) the cost and expenses we incur in offering the programs.\n\nThe incentive programs require you to opt-in to participate as set forth on the page where you can enroll or opt-in to the programs. You can opt-out either by contacting us at the information set forth below, or by following the terms and conditions provided when you are enrolling in the program. While we will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under CCPA, if you request deletion of your personal data, we may not be able to delete such information if it is necessary to administer the incentive or discount you requested and still provide you such incentive or discount.\n\nPersonal data Collected from Employees, Contractors, Applicants, and Health Care Providers\n\nEmployees – If you are an Moderna employee and would like more information about the categories of personal data we collect from you and the purposes for which the personal data will be used, please contact us at\n\n.\n\nContractors – If you are a contractor performing services for Moderna and would like information about the categories of personal data we collect from you as a contractor and the purpose for which the personal data will be used, please visit our .\n\nJob Applicants – If you are applying for a position with Moderna and would like information about the categories of personal data Moderna collects from you as a job applicant and the purposes for which the personal data, please view our Privacy Statement\n\nHealth Care Providers – If you are a health care provider with whom we have a contractual arrangement and would like information about the categories of personal data we collect from you and the purposes for which the personal data will be used, please visit our .\n\nChildren’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)\n\nConsistent (COPPA), if we learn that a child under age 13 has provided Personal Data to or through the site without first receiving his or her parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that he or she cannot use the services and subsequently we will dispose of such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement.\n\nCalifornia residents who are unable to review or access this CCPA Notice due to a disability may contact us to request access this CCPA Notice in an alternative format. Please call 1-844- 971-2551 or email us at .\n\nHow can you access, correct or delete the personal data about you that we process?

We will provide you with access to the information we hold about you, correct/update, and or delete that information that was provided to us by a Healthcare Professional or a consumer regarding an adverse drug event.\n\nIt is not technologically possible to remove from our servers each and every record of your information. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of information about you (including your health-related interests) may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate.\n\nNevertheless, when permitted by law, Moderna will delete your personal data (including health information) stored in the databases Moderna actively uses for research and daily business activities or stored in other readily searchable media. In addition, we will use reasonable efforts not to disclose any personal data stored in a non-erasable format after receiving your request for removal, except as required by law.\n\nHow can you exercise the right to data portability?

Where Moderna processes data relating to transfers of value made to you, Moderna relies on the legal basis of legitimate interests to process that data. Moderna’s compliance with the IPHA Code and these further objectives cannot be met without processing personal data about you and the transfers of value that you have received from us. We have carried out a Legitimate Interests Assessment and consider that this processing is necessary, proportionate and without unjustified harm to you.\n\nIf you do not agree to the disclosure of data relating to transfers of value made to you by Moderna, you can raise an objection via ."
