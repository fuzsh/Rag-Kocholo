Thoughtful thinker, dreams up schemes

Adventurous spirit, wild in your dreams

Notorious for snacks, you always have more

A Fun Roast for Taniyama

Too busy posing, thinking you're fly,

Always craving attention, but we wonder why.

No substance found, just a surface flair,

Insecure inside, hiding behind that hair.

You think you’re slick, but you stumble and trip,

Always lost in delusions, a self-pitying script.

Mediocre at best, and we’re losing the fight,

Actually, please go home; let’s end this tonight.

Tender whispers dance beneath the stars,

A symphony woven with love's sweet guitars.

Nurtured in laughter, our souls intertwine,

In gardens of passion, your heart calls to mine.

Your gaze, like the sunrise, ignites all my fears,

A journey together through joy and through tears.

Moments we cherish, like petals in bloom,

Awaits us a future where love finds its room.
