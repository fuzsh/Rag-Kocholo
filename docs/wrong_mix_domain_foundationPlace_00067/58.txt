ATLANTA : April 4, 2006

GeoFields, Inc., today announced that the company has been awarded the 2006 Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Foundation Partner of the Year Award for the Charlotte region. GeoFields received the honor from ESRI, the world-leader in GIS software, for its hard work and dedication in maintaining a strong, dependable relationship with ESRI and its consistent effort in building GIS-based applications for the pipeline industry. The award was presented at ESRI’s March 2006 Worldwide Business Partner Conference.

“When a company like ESRI recognizes our ability to build GIS-based applications, it confirms to our clients they will receive world-class solutions that maximize GIS technology,” said Gary A. Waters, executive vice president of GeoFields. “An award of this nature not only speaks to the complete integration with ESRI’s product family, but the overall quality and innovation of our pipeline solutions. We believe that we share this award with our clients who have helped us build the best collaborative pipeline solutions in the market.”

GeoFields delivers pipeline solutions that track the rapidly progressing offerings from ESRI. GeoFields has utilized the Geodatabase extensively along with ArcIMS, RouteMap IMS, ArcGIS Desktop (ArcInfo, ArcEditor and ArcView), ArcSDE and ArcEngine to build a family of commercial software products. Research and development at GeoFields also continues to incorporate the contribution of standard data models from ESRI, such as the ArcGIS Pipeline Data Model (APDM), ArcGIS Server, and utilizes ArcGIS Desktop to maintain the intricacies of a pipeline data model.

In addition to software development, GeoFields also provides clients with professional services. GeoFields has built the most sophisticated set of High Consequence Area (HCA) definition tools taking advantage of national geographic databases and sophisticated spatial analysis functions provided with the ESRI product family. The company’s unique blend of spatial data and data analysis for HCA definition produces the most comprehensive and defendable HCA segment process available to pipeline operators.

GeoFields plans to continue to emphasize its enterprise-class business partnership with ESRI.
