If you data is classified or unclassified, you could also extract buildings from the lidar itself. You will need Spatial Analyst and 3D Analyst extensions for this.\n\nLocal Government 3D Basemaps (Making buildings LOD2 with lidar)\n\nhttp://solutions.arcgis.com/local-government/help/local-government-scenes/\n\nLocal Government 3D Basemaps is an ArcGIS Pro project that can be used to author high-quality 3D scenes for your local government. These scenes are organized in different Levels of Detail (LOD) and derived from 2D operational data managed by a department or agency within a local government. Once authored, the 3D scenes are a foundation for 3D workflows and applications; and provide a consistent geographic context across local government departments and agencies.\n\n3D Mapping with Lidar Point Clouds (Extracting Buildings)\n\nhttp://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=06dfb37ca4b94e05bd3507cc4424804f\n\nIncluded in this download are all the scripts, tools, geodatabases, sample data, and documentation needed to complete the exercises for the hands-on workshop \"3D Mapping with Lidar Point Clouds\" presented at Esri's 2017 Imaging and Mapping Forum. The exercises include:\n\nExtracting Building Footprints from Classified Lidar\n\nExtracting Building Footprints from Unclassified Lidar\n\nHere's an example of some lidar extract buildings (Classified for buildings) that was run through the Local Government 3D Basemaps process in a scene layer:\n\nhttp://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=087a3ad1029946ea81c811bd3f2dbfa3\n\nCheck out my blog for how to apply the colors to the buildings.\n\nThanks,\n\nArthur Crawford - Esri Content Team"
