I joined the faculty at Clemson University as a part time lecturer after obtaining my PhD in Forest Resources. I enjoy teaching and assisting with research projects at the technical level. Currently I teach both graduate and undergraduate courses both online and in person modalities. My field experience in Forest Management and Geospatial services over the last 30 years provides a significant and unique contribution to the students classroom experience.\n\nI was born, raised and still reside in Western North Carolina. I have undergraduate degrees from Oregon State University and Haywood Community College in Forest Management, GIS and GPS Technologies. I am a registered Forester in North Carolina, a Professional GIS Surveyor in South Carolina, a nationally certified GIS Professional, an International Certified Arborist and Qualified Tree Risk Appraiser.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nGIS Analysis\n\nRemote Sensing\n\nData Extraction from UAV derived Products\n\nSilviculture\n\nExtension and Outreach\n\nI have spoke to forestry groups on UAV applications\n\nParticipated in Grants:\n\n-Haywood Community College Community Forest Grant: Development of courses for online delivery\n\n-Clemson University Extension Tree Inventory Grant: Recommendation of GPS technology and developed training classes on using GPS\n\nPublications\n\nRitter, Brian A., Threatt, Jimmy.
