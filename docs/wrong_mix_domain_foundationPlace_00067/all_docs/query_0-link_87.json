As part of his job, communication was key as he needed to help ensure different agencies didn’t impede on one another’s investigations (i.e., conduct proper deconflictions). After seven years with the agency, Neil continued his career as a trainer, helping multiple law enforcement agencies improve their analytical and investigative processes.

Michelle shares an ordinance that was implemented to hold landlords accountable for the crimes and disturbances that occur at their property in order to reduce those respective activities; the extra level of responsibility (or rather, fines) prompted landlords to be more vigilant, which in turn reduces the odds of criminality. Over her 25+ years career with the Green Bay Police Department, Michelle had the opportunity to help shape the agency, including selecting a suitable RMS, developing crime prevention programs, and training new employees. Michelle is currently a crime analyst for the Green Bay PD.\n\nCHALLENGE: There are Easter eggs in one of the tables of the Excel chapter that Jason wrote for the IACA textbook.

Svetlana shares how she capitalized on her advanced mathematical skills to secure a position as a crime analyst, and why she preferred her transition to a business analyst for the Oakland Police Department. While Svetlana had worked on a variety of investigations, including homicides, drugs, and gang violence, Svetlana focuses on her ability and fascination with finding patterns and series within a seemingly random dataset of criminal activities. Svetlana and Jason discuss the phenomenon of most agencies focusing heavily on basic descriptive analysis, when there’s so much more powerful analytics that an analyst can focus on in order to address crime reduction and public safety policies. Svetlana is currently a business analyst for the Oakland Police Department and teaches Power BI for Law Enforcement through the IACA.\n\nCHALLENGE: There are Easter eggs in one of the tables of the Excel chapter that Jason wrote for the IACA textbook.
