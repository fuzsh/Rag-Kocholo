        "text": "Early Specialization in Interventional Radiology (ESIR) is a training option for diagnostic radiology residents and medical students who identify an early desire to specialize in interventional radiology.\n\nESIR training is completed within the four-year diagnostic radiology residency. It requires a total of 11 interventional radiology or interventional radiology-related rotations (minimum of 44 weeks) and an ICU rotation of at least four continuous weeks. Of the 11 required interventional radiology or interventional radiology-related rotations, at least eight rotations (minimum of 32 weeks) will take place in the interventional radiology section under the supervision of interventional radiology faculty members.\n\nESIR candidates must still complete an independent IR residency to finish their IR training and be eligible for the American Board of Radiology (ABR) IR/DR Certifying Exam. Completion of the ESIR requirements allows advance placement into the 2nd year of the independent IR residency, reducing the total training time to only six years. Independent residency program directors retain the authority to determine whether ESIR training was adequate for advance placement in their program; however, requiring two year of independent residency training for a resident with ESIR will be uncommon.\n\nPlease visit the independent IR residency webpage for more information.\n\nTypically, to be considered for ESIR, you must match into a diagnostic radiology residency program with an ACGME approved ESIR designation and then apply for ESIR after beginning your diagnostic radiology residency, although there are variations in the candidate selection process among different programs. It is important that prospective diagnostic radiology residents talk with individual programs to get more information about their specific ESIR selection process."
