        "text": "What is CommandCentral Aware Enterprise?\n\nMotorola Solutions created the first and only end-to-end security technology ecosystem that unifies voice, video, data, and analytics on one, single platform â providing you with the foundation of safety you need by addressing the unique challenges of your organization.\n\nCommandCentral Aware Enterprise is one of the command center software applications within this platform designed to streamline critical and non-critical security and service operations to improve decision-making and accelerate response.\n\nMap Personnel and Incidents\n\nin One Complete Operating Picture\n\nEnsure that your teams see pertinent information of personnel equipped with MOTOTRBO radios and WAVE devices at any moment with customizable map data layers to prioritize information on the map. For example, view camera locations, CAD incidents, personnel status via GPS device location, and alerts from a single position â organized the way you work. Or incorporate other Esri-based map layers from your operations for enriched spatial orientation such as property boundaries, landmarks, buildings, and asset locations. Add streaming and stationary weather layers for enhanced visual awareness. These typically disparate sources of data can be viewed simultaneously on one map with an activity monitor, providing you with a complete operating picture of any incident.\n\nMotorola Solutions' integrated ecosystem allows you to address everyday concerns as well as emerging situations through four pillars â Detect, Analyze, Communicate, and Respond & Report.\n\nDetect\n\nReceive real-time alerts from sensors to keep personnel and assets safe and secure.\n\nAnalyze\n\nPopulate live video feeds and view real-time GPS location from users to make decisions with confidence.\n\nCommunicate\n\nShare gathered data with real-time personnel in the field to enable an informed response.\n\nRespond & Report\n\nContinuously monitor the response in real-time and recreate the incident with synced video and historical mapping to enable seamless communication, documentation, and future analysis.\n\nCommandCentral Aware Enterprise aggregates and integrates streaming video, real-time alerts, advanced data analytics, personnel and device tracking, records information, and more into a single, intuitive interface. Aware Enterprise improves outcomes by helping streamline incident response with informed decision-making and documenting past incidents to prevent incidents from becoming tragedies.\n\nManage Post Incident Data Collection and Analysis\n\nRe-create and uncover insights from past workflows to improve future emergencies, incident, or service responses. Aware Enterprise provides your organization with the ability to access a 90-day lookback at historical data including device locations, incidents, service requests, or emergencies. Review historical data to verify security patrol compliance and identify opportunities to improve incident responses. For further analysis, tag and bookmark for investigations and export video for review and evidence."
