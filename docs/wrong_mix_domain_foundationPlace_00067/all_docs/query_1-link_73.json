As established by U.S. Treasury Department guidance, the state, through TDEM, will distribute two tranches of payments to eligible non-entitlement units of local government (NEUs), which are local governments typically serving populations of under 50,000. The total funding amounts were determined by formula as directed by federal law and Treasury guidance. The state did not have discretion in determining these funding amounts, the eligibility of the NEUs, or how these funds must be spent.\n\nThe state will formally apply for funding on August 2, or when 90 percent of the NEU required information is received.\n\n*Immediate Action Needed*\n\nComplete the required steps included within the following timeline by August 2, 2021:\n\nCoronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Timeline Check-In\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act includes a short timeframe for the distribution of funding to participating NEUs. All NEUs should begin preparing the information necessary to upload their submission packages as soon as possible when the application portal is opened. NEUs that have not uploaded a complete submission package or are nonresponsive may lose access to these funds.\n\nPayment Timelines\n\nAs required by Treasury, the state, through TDEM, will distribute the first tranche of funding to NEUs after reviewing and approving the required program documentation provided above by each NEU. Per Treasury requirements, the state, through TDEM, will distribute the second tranche approximately one year later.\n\nParticipant Responsibilities\n\nNEUs participating in the program will have direct obligations to the Treasury Department, including reporting and recordkeeping requirements. All costs are subject to audit by the Treasury Office of Inspector General and Government Accountability Office and improperly used funds will be subject to recoupment by Treasury.\n\nCost Eligibility\n\nNEUs may use these funds for eligible purposes, please consult Treasury and TDEM websites for information:\n\nTo respond to the public health emergency with respect to COVID-19 or its negative economic impacts, including assistance to households, small businesses, and nonprofits, or aid to impacted industries such as tourism, travel, and hospitality;\n\nTo respond to workers performing essential work during the COVID-19 public health emergency by providing premium pay to eligible workers of the State, territory, or tribal government that are performing such essential work, or by providing grants to eligible employers that have eligible workers who perform essential work;\n\nFor the provision of government services to the extent of the reduction of revenue of such State, territory, or Tribal government due to the COVID-19 public health emergency relative to revenues collected in the most recent full fiscal year of the State, territory, or tribal government prior to the emergency; or\n\nTo make necessary investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure.\n\nAdditional allowable uses can be found in this FAQ document located at https://tdem.texas.gov/clfrf/. The Treasury Department will also update their draft rule which determines eligible uses. Please periodically check the TDEM website for updates.\n\nCost Period of Eligibility\n\nCLFRF funds may be used to cover costs incurred from March 3, 2021, through December 31, 2026.

The FAQ update provides answers to questions from stakeholders on eligible broadband infrastructure investments. The update clarifies that states and localities may invest in areas where not all households or businesses are unserved or underserved, as long as an objective of the project is to provide service to unserved or underserved households or businesses. Further, it clarifies that the use of “reliably” in the broadband provision of the IFR provides states and localities with significant discretion to assess the actual experience of users on the ground.\n\nThe FAQs regarding water, sewer and broadband infrastructure begin on page 16 of the document linked here and above.\n\nCoronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Frequently Asked Questions on Distribution of Funds to Non-entitlement Units of Local Government as of June 7, 2021.\n\nThe document linked here and above contains answers to frequently asked questions regarding the distribution of funds to non-entitlement units of local government (NEUs) under the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (CSFRF / CLFRF, or Fiscal Recovery Funds). This document serves as a supplement to the main document of frequently asked questions (available here), which is also available on the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)’s website. Treasury will be updating this document periodically in response to questions received from stakeholders. Recipients and stakeholders should consult the Interim Final Rule (IFR) for additional information.\n\nFunding for non-entitlement units of local governments (For more information, visit treasury.gov.)\n\nThe Coronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery Fund will provide $19.53 billion to support tens of thousands of non-entitlement units of local government, which are local governments typically serving a population under 50,000.\n\nNon-entitlement units of local government (NEUs), defined in section 603(g)(5) of the Social Security Act, as added by section 9901 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, are local governments typically serving populations of less than 50,000. NEUs include cities, villages, towns, townships, or other types of local governments. NEUs should expect to receive Coronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery Fund payments through their state governments. State governments will receive a specific allocation of these funds from Treasury for this purpose and are responsible for distributing these funds to NEUs within their state. Award amounts are based on the population of the NEU.\n\nNon-Entitlement Local Government defined in section 603(g)(5) of the Social Security Act as:\n\nNONENTITLEMENT UNIT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.—The term ‘‘nonentitlement unit of local government’’ means a ‘‘city’’, as that term is defined in section 102(a)(5) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5302(a)(5))), that is not a metropolitan city.\n\nDefinition from 42 USC 5302(a)(5):\n\nThe term “city” means (A) any unit of general local governmentwhich is classified as a municipality by the United States Bureau of the Census or (B) any other unit of general local government which is a town or township and which, in the determination of the Secretary, (i) possesses powers and performs functions comparable to these associated with municipalities, (ii) is closely settled, and (iii) contains within its boundaries no incorporated places as defined by the United States Bureau of the Census which have not entered into cooperation agreements with such town or township to undertake or to assist in the undertaking of essential community development and housing assistance activities.\n\nNational Association of Counties\n\nNaCO Interactive Tool\n\nThe National Association of Counties has created an interactive tool (linked above)to assist with understanding the funding available through the American Rescue Plan Action of 2021 (H.R. 1319) The tool is designed to help navigate the roughly $1.5 trillion in county related funding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Programs that may provide counties with additional funding are denoted as “county eligible.” As federal guidance for the various new and existing programs are released, this information will be updated.\n\nNACo Q&A\n\nNACo staff are answering questions on the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund through the NACo COVID-19 Recovery Clearinghouse. See the most frequently asked questions below, and click here to ask your question.\n\nWhat is the deadline to submit comments on Treasury's Interim Final Rule?\n\nThe new deadline to submit comments on Treasury’s Interim Final Rule is July 16, 2021. You must submit comments electronically through the Federal eRulemaking Portal.\n\nMay recipients use funds to cover the costs of consultants to assist with managing and administering the funds?\n\nRecipients may use funds for administering the Fiscal Recovery Fund program, including costs of consultants to support effective management and oversight, including consultation for ensuring compliance with legal, regulatory and other requirements.\n\nIs revenue loss calculated in the aggregate or on a source-by-source basis?\n\nIn calculating revenue loss, recipients will look at general revenue in the aggregate, rather than on a source-by-source basis. Given that recipients may have experienced offsetting changes in revenues across sources, Treasury’s approach provides a more accurate representation of the effect of the pandemic on overall revenues.\n\nFor broadband infrastructure investments, what does the requirement that infrastructure “be designed to” provide service to unserved or underserved households and businesses mean?\n\nDesigning infrastructure investments means to prioritize unserved or underserved households or businesses (speeds below 25 Mbps download/3 Mbps upload). To meet this requirement, counties can use funds to deploy broadband infrastructure projects whose objective is to provide service to unserved or underserved households or businesses.\n\nFor broadband infrastructure to provide service to “unserved or underserved households or businesses,” must every house or business in the service area be unserved or underserved?\n\nIt suffices that an objective of the project is to provide service to unserved or underserved households or businesses. Doing so may involve a holistic approach that provides service to a wider area in order to make the ongoing service of unserved or underserved households or businesses within the service area economical. Unserved or underserved households or businesses need not be the only households or businesses in the service area receiving funds.\n\nNational League of Cities\n\nThe National League of Cities has compiled several resources to assist with understanding about Coronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery Fund grants.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nLocal Allocations in the American Rescue Plan\n\nMay 19, 2021\n\nGovernor Abbott Issues Executive Order Prohibiting Government Entities from Mandating Masks\n\nIn the event you are not aware, the Governor issued Executive Order GA-36 yesterday.

For context, this is twice the amount EDA received via the CARES Act ($1.5 billion) and nearly ten times EDA’s typical annual appropriation. EDA has not yet published guidance dictating how these funds can be used. In addition, NADO sent this NADO letter to Department of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo emphasizing recommendations for distributing the American Rescue Plan funds, and highlighting the need for additional funds for EDDs and NADO members.\n\nBelow are the NADO and NARC slide decks containing some additional information and resources.\n\nNADO Slides\n\nNARC Slides\n\nNational Association of Counties (NACO)\n\nThe National Association of Counties has set up a Frequently Asked Questions page which is available at the link below.\n\nhttps://www.naco.org/resources/featured/naco-recovery-fund-faqs\n\nNational League of Cities (NLC)\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response & Relief - National League of Cities (nlc.org)\n\nJanuary 3, 2021\n\nState Preservation Board Reopens Capitol\n\nGovernor Abbott, DSHS Encourage Nursing Facilities To Take Advantage Of COVID-19 Treatments\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) are alerting nursing facilities to the availability of monoclonal antibody therapies that can be used to treat residents who have been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n\"These live-saving monoclonal antibody therapies play a critical role in our fight against COVID-19, and I urge nursing facilities across the state to take advantage of these treatments,\" said Governor Abbott. \"Thanks to our partnership with the federal government, these therapeutics are readily available for nursing facilities and other health care settings to help us treat COVID-19 patients and reduce hospitalizations.\"\n\nClick here to view the full press release\n\nDepartment of State Health Services\n\nTexas COVID-19 Vaccine Information\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has several resources available, including updates to the Texas Vaccination Plan, available on its COVID-19 Vaccine Information website: https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/coronavirus/immunize/vaccine.aspx.

They urge everyone to exercise increased due diligence and caution when dealing with new suppliers or vendors, especially when using a third-party broker.\n\nAs demand for PPE increases, scammers may advertise equipment they do not actually have in attempts to make a quick profit. These PPE products may be counterfeit and mislabeled, and some may not exist at all. Some fraudsters reach out directly to consumers and government entities through email or social media to push their products. Red flags that a seller may be engaging in a scam include:\n\nUnusual payment terms\n\nLast-minute price changes\n\nLast-minute excuses for delay in shipment\n\nUnexplained source of a large quantity of material\n\nEvidence of re-packaging or mislabeling\n\nThere are ongoing federal and state prohibitions on charging exorbitant prices for PPE during this time of national emergency.

For additional information on disaster scams, please visit our disaster scams website.\n\nMore information on unapproved or counterfeit PPE can be found at cdc.gov/niosh.

If you have information about PPE-related fraud, or about hoarding or price gouging of critical supplies, you can report it without leaving your home to the National Center for Disaster Fraud by calling the National Hotline at (866) 720-5721 or by submitting the NCDF Web Complaint Form.\n\nEDA Fraud Alert\n\nEDA is aware of recent incidents of fraudulent emails, letters, or other communications sent to individuals offering to provide EDA grants in exchange for money or personal information.

More information on the Coronavirus Relief Fund can be found here.\n\nNote Treasury’s July 8 revisions regarding whether CRF payments can be used to cover increased administrative leave costs of public employees who could not telework in the event of a stay at home order or a case of COVID-19 in the workplace. Per the updated FAQ’s, “the statute requires that payments be used only to cover costs that were not accounted for in the budget most recently approved as of March 27, 2020. As stated in the Guidance, a cost meets this requirement if either (a) the cost cannot lawfully be funded using a line item, allotment, or allocation within that budget or (b) the cost is for a substantially different use from any expected use of funds in such a line item, allotment, or allocation. If the cost of an employee was allocated to administrative leave to a greater extent than was expected, the cost of such administrative leave may be covered using payments from the Fund.”\n\nFEMA Releases Guidance on Federal Cost Share for Public Assistance Program\n\nOn July 2, the Federal Emergency Management Agency released clear guidance on how FEMA will treat the multiple sources of funding as they relate to the public assistance program and its cost share requirements. Generally, funding from other federal agencies cannot be used to meet the FEMA public assistance non-federal cost share requirement. For COVID-19, however, there are two exceptions: Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) dollars – mentioned above – and Department of House and Urban Development’s Community Disaster Block Grant (CDBG-CV).\n\nHUD COVID-19 Webinar Series\n\nJuly 13- Responding to the Housing Challenges Posed by the Pandemic Session 1\n\nRegister (Session 2 TBD) Information on HUD’s “Responding to COVID-19: A Webinar Series for Local Governments Serving Small Communities – Summer 2020”.\n\nJuly 1 2020\n\nOperational Resources\n\nSETRPC Updated Guidance\n\nBelow is a link to Addendum 5 to the SETRPC Guidelines for Returning to Work (previously Guidelines for Returning to Work – SETRPC Offices – COVID-19).

Employers should take particular care to reduce workers’ risk of exposure to COVID-19, while making sure to be compliant with relevant Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) regulations. First and foremost, this means following CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidance for reducing workplace exposure for all employees. All decisions about following these recommendations should be made in collaboration with local health officials and other state and local authorities who can help assess the current level of mitigation needed based on levels of COVID-19 community transmission and the capacities of the local public health and healthcare systems. CDC has released interim guidance, laid out in a series of three steps, to inform a gradual scale up of operations.

Distribution of funds is based on a calculation of $55 per capita.\n\nThe Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) will manage the distribution of funds, review of expenses and reimbursement. Initially, each eligible jurisdiction will receive an immediate distribution of 20 percent (20%) of the allocations listed in this document.
