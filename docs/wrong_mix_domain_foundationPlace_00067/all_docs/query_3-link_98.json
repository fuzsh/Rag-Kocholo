        "text": "In an office tucked under the stairs, Patricia Bridges sits, pen in hand, surrounded by black-and-white photographs of ridges, ravines and craters. Bridges’ talent with an airbrush is known well enough to her colleagues at the Aeronautical Chart and Information Center in St. Louis. But her work is secret.\n\nShe’s in hiding, professionally-speaking. It’s 1959. Bridges, only a few years out of art school, knows U.S. government mapping organizations are competing to see which can create the most detailed and accurate maps of the moon’s surface. She’s working on a prototype, a chart of the Copernicus Crater, one of the moon’s more prominent geographic features.\n\nCopernicus the astronomer revolutionized the Renaissance world when he declared that the Earth orbits the Sun. Bridges’ rendering of the crater Copernicus will become part of another revolution in science, culminating in humans orbiting, landing on and walking on the moon. It’s a revolution that will also enable Bridges to earn a reputation as the world’s foremost planetary illustrator. Her face will appear in newspapers. Her work will be purchased and displayed across the United States.\n\nBut that’s another decade away. For now, Bridges sketches, in secret, under the stairs.\n\nThe first known map of the moon was created in 1609 by English mapmaker Thomas Harriot, with the help of his telescope. By the late 1950s, as Americans warily eyed the skies for the Soviet’s Sputnik satellite, the newly formed U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration asked ACIC, which would later become the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, to make a new set of maps.\n\nThese maps needed to be much more detailed than any produced by Harriot or his selenographing successors. These maps needed to provide NASA the information needed to allow a human to land on, explore and return from the moon.\n\nBy 1959 plenty of photographs existed of the moon’s surface, taken through telescopes much more powerful than Harriot’s, but photographs don’t have coordinates. They don't indicate how wide a plain is, how deep a crater, or how tall a ridge. If the United States was going to successfully land a human on the moon, ACIC needed to create lunar charts more detailed than any made before – and quickly.\n\nBy 1960 ACIC’s special projects lead Bill Cannell, one of Bridges’ supervisors, is out touring the United States in search of the best telescope to view the surface of the moon. Or, more precisely, the best telescope to view the surface of the moon that’s available.\n\nHe finds one in Arizona at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff.\n\nCannell plans for a three-person ACIC team – himself, Bridges and a cartographer named Jim Greenacre -- to move from St. Louis to Flagstaff, where they can photograph, observe, sketch and chart, all in the same place.\n\nBridges had come to ACIC in 1956, not necessarily out of a passion for mapping. While in art school at Washington University in St. Louis, Bridges, a painter, had worked restoring murals in St. Louis’ historic Old Courthouse. “They didn’t think any women would do that, because you have to climb around on scaffolding, and you had to climb way up in the dome,” Bridges will say in 2015. “I loved it.”\n\nShe’d heard there was a place in St. Louis, a couple miles south of the Old Courthouse, where the government hired art majors to make maps, so she’d applied. She was assigned to ACIC’s special projects team and eventually ushered under the stairs with a stack of lunar photographs.\n\nBridges, who had grown up across the river from St. Louis in Alton, Illinois, is excited about the move to Arizona. She and her husband, Al, had honeymooned in Flagstaff, and both had “fallen in love” with the area, she’ll later tell historians.\n\nThe ACIC team that first arrives at Lowell in 1961 consist of only three people. Bridges, who goes by “Pat'” is the only woman on the team. Those who don’t know her often assume ACIC’s “Pat” is a Patrick. She surprises more than a few.\n\nEach person has a role: Greenacre takes lunar photos and provides lunar observations to Bridges, Bridges draws the maps, and Cannell oversees the project.\n\nPhotographs provide the foundation for the team’s lunar charts, but they also film movies of the moon. Each recording contains hundreds and hundreds of still images, which allow the team to choose photos least distorted by air turbulence. The best photos are sent to ACIC St. Louis, where the photos are “rectified,” or altered to make allowances for the curvature of the moon’s surface and other distorting factors, and then sent back to the Lowell team.\n\nBut photographs aren’t enough to capture the level of detail ACIC needs. The map-making team also spends nights at the Clark telescope observing the moon’s surface, because a human can see more through the telescope than with photos – “about 4 times as much,” Cannell tells a reporter for the Arizona Daily Sun. The ACIC team discovers thousands of small craters on what previously had been thought of as a smooth surface – important details if you’re choosing a landing site.\n\nCannell and Greenacre sit at the telescope with photos of the lunar surface, filling in details photographs miss. Their notes go to Bridges, who also often makes observations herself to confirm or clarify her team members’ notes. Sessions at telescope often last several hours at a time, depending on how much of the area the team is charting is illuminated. “If it was illuminated, we were there,” Bridges said in 2015.\n\nACIC public affairs officer Mel Kramer writes about his experience visiting the ACIC team at Lowell for ACIC’s publication, Orienter. “Separate, small sections are brought into focus [through the telescope], and observations on it are annotated on corresponding sections of photographs,\" Kramer writes. \"The next day, these annotations are interpreted and airbrushed into the master shaded relief drawings. In that way, literally, pore by pore, the moon’s portrait is being painted.”\n\nIt’s winter when Kramer visits, and the dome that houses the telescope is not heated. Bridges wears earmuffs and a jacket to work. Kramer notes the ACIC team dresses like “polar explorers.”\n\nStructures that house telescopes weren’t, and still aren’t, heated, said Schindler, the Lowell historian. That’s because warm air rising from the top of the dome, where the telescope juts out to the sky, would cause more air turbulence, and therefore more image distortion, than might naturally occur.\n\nThe average low in January in Flagstaff is 11 degrees Fahrenheit and temperatures are typically at their lowest at night – the best time for viewing.\n\nFortunately, Bridges could draw in the heated ACIC office, a structure a few minutes’ walk from the telescope. While much of modern map-making is digital, ACIC’s lunar charts had to be hand-drawn. Artists such as Bridges, called scientific illustrators, were a vital part of the map-making process, using pens and airbrushes to fill in details of lunar craters, ravines, mountains and plains.\n\nMore illustrators joined the ACIC team at Flagstaff as the team of three grew to a team of 15 by 1965, but Bridges was widely known to be best at her craft, Schindler said.\n\n“Like a stonemason, everyone has their own particular technique,” Schindler said. “Patricia Bridges was very accurate in her drawings and had a good eye for detail. Her charts were highly regarded.”\n\nIn 1963, a dozen or so American astronauts, including Neil Armstrong, come to Lowell for crash-course in lunar geography – which, to Bridges, feels akin to a visit from rock stars. The astronauts, the same ones on TV, who will someday visit the moon, looking at pictures she drew – incredible!\n\nBridges isn’t the only one starstruck by the American astronauts. The entire United States is caught up in the drama, the adventure, to get an American on the moon.\n\nThe government starts offering Bridges’ charts to the public for purchase; anyone can buy one by sending $3 to the Government Printing Office. Soon Bridges’ work is on display in homes and offices, across the United States. It is pored over by both professional and aspirational scientists, astronauts and cartographers.\n\nWith the charts created by Bridges and her team, NASA selects a landing spot for the Apollo 11 astronauts: a flat location in the area known as the Sea of Tranquility.\n\nIn July 1969, Bridges watches with the rest of the United States as Neil Armstrong, the astronaut who had visited her office and looked at her charts, became the first human to step foot on the moon. She’s amazed – and proud. She is part of something really important, really special.\n\nBy the next year, Bridges will take a new job, with the U.S. Geological Survey, charting the United States’ next projected destination in space: Mars.\n\nBridges’ daughter, Laura Ball, was 3 years old during the moon landing. Growing up in Flagstaff, Ball understood her mom did something special.\n\nBack then, it was still a bit of a novelty to have a mother with a career, Ball said. Ball remembered her mother came to career days at school to talk about her work. Bridges brought home Mars rock props, left over from exercises with potential Mars rovers and painted dusty red. They were the subject of one of her favorite practical jokes. “She would pretend they were heavy, and carry them to people,” Ball said. “Then, once she handed the rocks to them, they’d realize they were Styrofoam and weigh next to nothing.”\n\nBall said even as a small child, she noticed the pride in her mother’s voice when Bridges talked about her work. “It was in the way she carried herself,” Ball said. “She loved her job and was happy to show it off; not like in a bragging way, but teaching, in a way to inspire.”\n\nBridges retired in 1992. In 2015, she told interviewers that the enthusiasm she developed for her lunar and planetary mapping work surprised her. “This work, which I never had any idea I would do as an art major, it turned out that it was just really fascinating to me,” she says. “I felt very fortunate.”\n\nA painter helped show the way to one of humanity’s most significant scientific achievements. Bridges passed away in 2021, and humans still haven’t made it to Mars. But maybe future generations will – and will look back at Bridges’ charts to help guide them.\n\nWritten by: Jessica Daues"
