SBTEX contains hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) that are released from the petrochemical industry, combustion process, transport emission, and solvent usage sources. Although several SBTEX toxic assessment studies have been conducted, they have mainly relied on ambient measurements to estimate exposure and limit their scope to specific locations and observational periods. To overcome these spatiotemporal limitations, an air quality modeling system over the US Gulf region was created, predicting the spatially and temporally enhanced SBTEX modeling concentrations from May to SeptemberÂ 2012. Due to the incompleteness of SBTEX in the official US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Emission Inventory (NEI), the Hazardous Air Pollutions Imputation (HAPI) program was used to identify and estimate the missing HAP emissions. The improved emission data were processed to generate the chemically speciated hourly gridded emission inputs for the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) chemical transport model to simulate the SBTEX concentrations over the Gulf modeling region. SBTEX pollutants were modeled using the Reactive Tracer feature in CAMx that accounts for their chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere. The data show that the major SBTEX emissions in this region are contributed by mobile emissions (45â%), wildfire (30â%), and industry (26â%). Most SBTEX emissions are emitted during daytime hours (local time 14:00â17:00), and the emission rate in the model domain is about 20â40âtâhâ1, which is about 4 times higher than that in the nighttime (local time 24:00â04:00, about 4â10âtâhâ1). High concentrations of SBTEX (above 1âppb) occurred near the cities close to the I-10 interstate highway (Houston, Beaumont, Lake Charles, Lafayette, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and Mobile) and other metropolitan cities (Shreveport and Dallas). High styrene concentrations were co-located with industrial sources, which contribute the most to the styrene emissions. The HAPI program successfully estimated missing emissions of styrene from the chemical industry. The change increased total styrene emissions by 22â%, resulting in maximum ambient concentrations increasing from 0.035 to 1.75âppb across the model domain. The predicted SBTEX concentrations with imputed emissions present good agreement with observational data, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.75 (0.46 to 0.77 for individual SBTEX species) and a normalized mean bias (NMB) of â5.6â% (â24.9â% to 32.1â% for the individual SBTEX species), suggesting their value for supporting any SBTEX-related human health studies in the Gulf region. The SBTEX data were published at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7967541) (Wang et al., 2023), and the HAPI tool was also published at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7987106) (Wang and Baek, 2023).",

The SBTEX data were published at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7967541) (Wang et al., 2023), and the HAPI tool was also published at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7987106) (Wang and Baek, 2023).\n\nStyrene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (SBTEX) are listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Declet-Barreto et al., 2020) and can be detected in unhealthy amounts in the ambient environment. SBTEX are primarily from industrial emission sources and can be found in the petrochemical, construction, and manufacturing industries (Polvara et al., 2021; Declet-Barreto et al., 2020), with 98â% of the benzene emissions attributed to coal and petroleum sources (ATSDR, 2007a, b, 2010a, b, 2017). Exposure studies of the total SBTEX at industrial sources in the Middle East, Europe, and western Asia have shown that workers experience a cumulative yearly environmental exposure of 25â176âppb (Al-Harbi et al., 2020; Rajabi et al., 2020; Christensen et al., 2018; Rahimpoor et al., 2022; Niaz et al., 2015; Moshiran et al., 2021). The inhalation reference concentration for benzene shows low-dose linearity utilizing a maximum likelihood estimate E-5 risk level of benzene (1 in 100â000); the range is 0.4â1.4âppb of the air concentration for leukemia (USEPA, 2000).\n\nGiven the importance of SBTEX from industrial sources, the heavily industrialized Gulf region of the US could be a significant source of exposure for the population living there. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) report, the petrochemical industry in the Gulf region states contributes approximately 52â% (â¼5.3âmillionâtâyrâ1) of benzene production capacity in the US (ATSDR, 2007a) and â¼75â% (â¼â6.2âmillionâtâyrâ1) of xylene production capacity (ATSDR, 2007b). Texas and Louisiana have significant production of styrene and ethylbenzene, with annual productions of 5.5 and 7.2âmillionâtâyrâ1, respectively (ATSDR, 2010a). A recent study of SBTEX exposures in the US Gulf region, conducted within the Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study (GULF Study) cohort (NIEHS, 2021), observed associations of blood concentrations and annual average air concentrations of these chemicals with neurological symptoms (Werder et al., 2019, 2018). The average blood BTEX concentration among the 146 tobacco-smoke-unexposed participants with blood measurements in this study was 255ângâLâ1 (Doherty et al., 2017; Werder et al., 2018). This value is similar to that for a representative nationwide sample assessed as part of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2005â2008 (NCHS, 2021), which measured an average of 247ângâLâ1. In GULF Study, however, the 95th percentile of the BTEX concentrations was 991ângâLâ1, which is 23â% higher than the 95th percentile for the NHANES nationwide sample of 803ângâLâ1. The mean blood concentration of styrene for the GULF Study sample was 52ângâLâ1 (95th percentile: 882ângâLâ1) or twice the NHANES nationwide mean of 25ângâLâ1 (95th percentile: 55ângâLâ1) (NCHS, 2021). Due to the short biological half-lives of SBTEX species, the study concluded that this high average SBTEX concentration in blood in the Gulf region resulted from recent, presumably local, emission sources.\n\nMost ambient exposure studies of SBTEX have relied directly on local measurements from the field or at existing ambient monitors. These measurements can then be used in statistical models to spatially predict exposures to SBTEX (Pankow et al., 2003; O'Leary and Lemke, 2014; Miller et al., 2018; Hsieh et al., 2020). For example, Hsieh et al.Â (2020) developed multivariate linear regression (MLR) models to estimate SBTEX concentrations using correlations with other criteria air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM), and meteorological conditions (temperature, wind speed). The MLR model predicted a strong correlation with NOx and CO. The limitations of the statistical model are that they require measurement data, and they assume that the measurements originate from a single source in a relatively small region. The use of a dispersion model is another way of estimatinng ambient SBTEX concentrations when local measurements are lacking. Chen et al.Â (2016) applied a dispersion model to predict SBTEX and other toxicant concentrations in two industrial complexes in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The dispersion model performed better for stationary point sources than a statistically based model and predicted up to â¼78â% of the ambient observation. These dispersion models, however, only account for exposures at a smaller spatial scale (USEPA, 2022, 2023) and thus cannot support regional-scale (e.g., state-level) application. Furthermore, these models assumed that the exposure rate to SBTEX is linear without considering any chemical destruction and wet or dry deposition losses in the atmosphere.\n\nAn accurate SBTEX assessment in the Gulf region must address the known uncertainties associated with current statistical, biometric, and dispersion model approaches. Improved accuracy in exposure estimation is dependent on the inclusion of all industrial emission sources, must capture the temporal and spatial variability known to occur in industrial emission rates, and should include the chemical and physical decay processes of the atmosphere. These issues can be addressed using a regional-scale chemical transport model (CTM), like the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extension (CAMx) (Ramboll, 2021) coupled with an emission inventory that provides a comprehensive account of all the SBTEX sources. In addition, the Reactive Tracer function, which is one of the CAMx probing tools, allows the model to explicitly simulate SBTEX concentrations. Currently, SBTEX emission data can be found in the EPA's National Emission Inventory (NEI), which includes data from the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program database (USEPA, 2021d). Unlike for benzene sources, the TRI data for the other four species (STEX) are based on voluntary reports, and as a result, the 2011 NEI has emission rate data for these air toxicants only for a limited set of emission sources (USEPA, 2021a).\n\nThe following work describes the development of a new STEX emission inventory for the Gulf Coast region that includes the emission sources absent from the 2011 NEI. Missing emission rate data of STEX were provided by analyzing NEI emissions of similar industrial sources that did provide emission rates and by applying their rates to the missing source. Diurnal profiles for STEX were based on the hourly profiles of other pollutants with the same type of industrial source. This study then applied the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) model system (Baek and Seppanen, 2021) to generate a CAMx-ready emission inventory. Since STEX is not included as an explicit species in the chemical mechanisms used by CAMx, a reactive tracer was included to account for chemical losses. This new emission inventory was then utilized in CAMx to predict STEX concentrations over the Gulf region for 5Â months in 2012.\n\n3.1âSBTEX emissions\n\nThe 2012 annual total SBTEX emissions in the model domain are shown in TableÂ 1. The emission sectors include agriculture fire (afgire), commercial marine vessel (cmv), non-point source (nonpt), non-road vehicle (non-road), on-road vehicle (on-road), fire emission (ptfire), rail road (rail), residential wood combustion (rwc), non-point oil gas industry (np_oilgas), electricity power plant unit (ptegu), point source emission other than the electricity generation unit (ptnonipm), and the point source of the oil and gas industry (pt_oilgas). The largest contributor of SBTEX emissions in the 12âkmâÃâ12âkm model domain is indicated as being from the âon-roadâ sector, with 89â204âtâyrâ1 representing about 36â% of the total SBTEX emissions. The on-road sector contributes most to the total xylenes (46â%), toluene (48â%), and ethylbenzene (60â%) emissions but much less to benzene (13â%) and styrene (6.8â%). The second largest contributor to the SBTEX emissions is the âwildfireâ sector (61â316âtâyrâ1), contributing about 25â% of the total SBTEX. The wildfire contributes most of the total benzene (57â%), 12â% of the total toluene and 7â% of the total xylenes but no ethylbenzene and styrene due to the missing explicit profiles in the 2012 wildfire emission inventory. The ânon-roadâ sector ranked third (35â375âtâyrâ1), contributing about 14â% of the total SBTEX over our modeling region. Non-road contributes largely to xylenes (15â%), toluene (21â%), and ethylbenzene (21â%). Compared to the other sectors, emissions from non-electricity generation unit industrial point sources (ptnonipm) contain a larger portion of styrene, 2911âtâyrâ1, which is 69â% of the total styrene emission. Our study successfully identified missing styrene emissions from the chemical industry process (see TableÂ S7), leading to a 34â% increase in the total styrene emissions.\n\nThe individual and total SBTEX annual emission spatial plots in the 12âkmâÃâ12âkm model domain are presented in Fig.Â 3. The grid cell with the highest SBTEX emissions is found in Houston near the ship channel (1059âtâyrâ1), which is about 35 times higher than the average emission (28âtâyrâ1) across the domain, followed by one in San Antonio in Texas (1022âtâyrâ1) and one near Sabine Lake in Louisiana (1022âtâyrâ1). In Fig.Â 3b, the missing sources of SBTEX emissions in the NEI are mostly located in Texas and Louisiana, particularly for the grid cells in Lake Charles (increased by 373âtâyrâ1, +282â%) and Baton Rouge (167âtâyrâ1, +31â%) in Louisiana; Belton (61âtâyrâ1, +21â%), Fort Worth (50âtâyrâ1, +85â%), and Dallas (44âtâyrâ1, +52â%) in Texas; and some rural areas in Texas. These missing sources of SBTEX are mostly from the np_oilgas and ptnonipm emission sectors (detailed in Supplement Sect.Â S3.1 and S3.2). Although the total SBTEX emission increased by only 2â% based on the domain average (TableÂ 1), the localized impacts for certain areas can be up to 60â% of the total SBTEX emissions.\n\nThe SBTEX emissions exhibit strong diurnal variations across a day, as presented in Fig.Â 4a. The daytime hourly emission (up to 77âtâhâ1) is about 4.3 times higher than the nighttime emission rate, mainly due to the larger emissions from on-road and off-road mobile sources (half of the total emissions) during the daytime. The diurnal variations in the chemical composition of the total SBTEX also suggested the increased percentages of toluene and xylenes (indicating the transport sources) during the morning (06:00â10:00âLT) and evening (19:00âLT) rush hours. The inclusion of the missing sources will slightly reduce the emission variation across a day, as most of the missing sources come from industrial manufacturing and oil processes (detailed in the Supplement), whose diurnal profiles are much flatter (about only a 20â% increase during the daytime) compared to the total emission (see Fig.Â 4b), with much smaller differences between the day (0.86âtâhâ1) and night (0.69âtâhâ1). The chemical compositions of the missing emission sources were relatively constant throughout the day, with about 50â% comprised of xylenes, 30â% of toluene, and 10â%â15â% of styrene. The relative amount of missing styrene was higher than that found in the total emissions.\n\n3.2âModel performance\n\nCAMx simulations predicting SBTEX concentrations were completed using two sets of emissions: the National Emission Inventory (âBaseâ) and the emission scenario adjusted in this study (âAdjâ). The differences between the two scenarios can be regarded as impacts of the missing emission sources in the original NEI, suggesting the importance of the completeness of emissions.\n\nThe simulated concentrations were compared with the observations to evaluate the accuracy of the SBTEX emissions and concentrations estimated in this study. The NMB (%) and correlation coefficient (R) of both the Base and Adj cases are compared in TableÂ 2. Overall, the CAMx model can capture the pollution level and spatiotemporal variation of all the SBTEX species. More specifically, the model reproduced the daily variation of SBTEX concentrations, with R 0.65 (0.54â0.65 for individual SBTEXs) for all the daily observational records (N=2717) as well as their spatial distribution across the observational sites (N=46, averages of the whole simulation period), with R 0.75 (0.46 to 0.77 for the individual SBTEX species) and NMB â5.6â% (â24.9â% to 32.1â% for the individual SBTEX species).\n\nThe inclusion of emissions can slightly improve the overall model performance, with decreased NMBs for toluene (+3.5â%), xylenes (+5.7â%), ethylbenzene (+3.8â%), and the total SBTEX (+3.2â%). The NMB for styrene is increased from 17.4â% to 32.1â%, while R is increased by 0.01, suggesting better correlations with the newly estimated emission data, while uncertainties associated with the emission factors or other parameters lead to the overestimation of SBTEX. FigureÂ 5 shows the spatial distribution of the average concentration simulated in the Adj case, overlapping the average observational data for the total SBTEX (Fig.Â 5a) and individual species (Fig.Â 5b to f). The observational data (diamond shapes) show a high concentration at industrial or city sites and a lower concentration at rural sites. The model results showed a continual concentration gradient pattern from cities to a rural area with a 4âkmâÃâ4âkm resolution, and the results are close to the observational data in Houston, Dallas, Beaumont, and Baton Rouge.\n\nWe further classified the observation sites into four groups, including âAirportâ, âIndustryâ, âRuralâ, and âUrbanâ, based on their geographical locations (TableÂ S8). For the total SBTEX (Fig.Â 6a), the correlation coefficient (R) is 0.75 (R2 is 0.56) across all the locations, and the black solid line is the regression line for all the sites (N=46). The red dots indicated that the industrial sites have a higher concentration in both the model and observational results, and the cities (blue diamonds) showed that their concentrations are slightly overestimated and lower than the industrial sites. Airport (black squares) and Rural (green triangles) have lower SBTEX concentrations than City and Industry, and Rural is the lowest group. FigureÂ 6b to f are similar plots for explicit benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, and styrene. R ranges from 0.46 to 0.77. Benzene (R is 0.68), toluene (R is 0.46), and styrene (R is 0.64) are overestimated, but xylenes (R is 0.77) and ethylbenzene (R is 0.77) are close to the observational data. Although toluene has the lowest R (0.46), this is caused by two industry sites that largely underestimate in Houston (site ID: 482011015) and Nederland (site ID: 482450014). In case we remove these two industrial sites' data, the R for toluene in Fig.Â 6c will become 0.7 (Fig.Â S7). This phenomenon is probably caused by the missing toluene industrial sources near those two sites. The inclusion of missing emission sources definitively improved the model performance (TableÂ 2), especially in the Rural (+5.4â%) and Airport groups (+6.8â%), which suffered the most due to the missing industrial sources. The NMBs for xylenes are also reduced across all the emission groups (Industry: +3â%, Urban: +12â%, Airport: +20â%, and Rural: +13â%).\n\nBecause only a few sites have hourly data, this study compared the diurnal variation of SBTEX concentrations for the Houston industrial area (using data from only three monitoring sites) in Fig.Â S8. The hourly data show that benzene, ethylbenzene, and styrene are overestimated (the NMB for benzene is 69â%, ethylbenzene is 36â%, and styrene is 27â%) during nighttime hours (21:00 to 06:00âLT). Toluene is underestimated at nighttime (the NMB is â45â%), whereas xylenes closely align with the observed data (â16â%) range. On the other hand, all species experience underestimation during daytime hours (the NMB for benzene is â25â%, toluene is â65â%, xylenes are â51â%, ethylbenzene is â46â%, and styrene is â82â%) (from 10:00 to 17:00âLT). Such results indicate that the hourly emission rate may overestimate during nighttime but underestimate during daytime in the Houston industrial area.\n\n3.3âSBTEX concentration patterns\n\n3.3.1âSpatial distribution\n\nFigureÂ 7a presents the spatial distribution of SBTEX concentrations during the model period (1Â May to 30Â September) in the Adj scenario. The highest SBTEX concentration (3.07âppb) occurs near Lake Charles, followed by Baton Rouge (2.06âppb), the Houston ship channel (2.04âppb), Shreveport (1.69âppb), and Beaumont (1.59âppb). The spatial distribution patterns of the individual SBTEX compounds exhibit similarities due to the shared emission sources, except for styrene. Styrene primarily originates from ptnonipm, while the other species predominantly arise from vehicle emissions and wildfires. Benzene (maximum 1.06âppb), toluene (maximum 1.01âppb), and ethylbenzene (maximum 0.16âppb) reach their highest concentrations in Houston, reflecting their significant emissions. Further, xylenes (0.78âppb) originate from the sources in Shreveport. Remarkably, elevated concentrations of styrene (reaching 1.97âppb) are conspicuously identified as being proximal to Lake Charles, a locale characterized by an abundant emission of styrene from non-electricity-generating unit point sources, which were absent in the original NEI records.\n\nThis study further investigated the influence of missing emission sources in the original NEI on the SBTEX concentrations by taking the differences between the Adj and Base scenarios. The majority of the missing emissions are associated with the np_oilgas and ptnonipm sectors, with increased contributions geographically concentrated in Texas and Louisiana (Fig.Â 7b). In particular, the largest impact on the SBTEX concentrations is shown near Lake Charles by up to 1.82âppb (+68â%), which is mostly related to the increase in the styrene concentration (by 1.75âppb, +5315â%). This increase is due to the NEI missing one large point source (364.12âtâyrâ1) in the ptnonipm sector near Lake Charles. The inclusion of the missing emission sources also led to the increase in styrene concentrations in other cities, such as Baton Rouge (0.07âppb, +389â%), LA, and Houston, TX (0.03âppb, +62â%). Baton Rouge, LA, also suffers the highest increase in toluene concentrations by 0.44âppb (+92â%) due to the inclusion of missing emissions, followed by Beaumont (0.07âppb, +50â%) and Carthage (0.048âppb, +66â%), TX. Fort Worth, TX, exhibits the highest increase in xylene concentrations by 0.07âppb (+95â%), followed by Center (0.06âppb, +273â%), Teague (0.06âppb, +340â%), and Beaumont (0.036âppb, +70â%), TX. The largest increase in the ethylbenzene concentration occurred at Longview (0.01âppb, +85â%), followed by Beaumont (0.009âppb, +40â%) and Houston (0.006âppb, +9â%), TX.\n\n3.3.2âThe diurnal variation\n\nIn general, the diurnal variations of SBTEX concentrations are primarily influenced by various factors (such as ventilation, emissions, diffusion, deposition, and chemical reactions). These variations typically manifest with lower concentrations during the daytime compared to the nighttime due to increased ventilation, diffusion, and chemical loss, even though the emissions are about 4 times higher during the daytime, as presented earlier (Fig.Â 4). Diurnal meteorological and emission patterns suggest more sensitivity of the concentrations to the emissions during nighttime than daytime, implying that implementing emission controls to reduce the concentrations at night would be most effective. The variation of emission sources might also modulate the diurnal pattern in the concentrations. To demonstrate this, here we selected two industrial locations and one city location with high SBTEX concentrations to compare the diurnal variation of the concentrations.\n\nThe first one is Channelview city (latitude 29.8, longitude â95.12), located in the Houston ship channel industrial area on the eastern side of downtown Houston. Driven by both emission temporal profiles and meteorological conditions, the peak SBTEX concentration (about 12âppb) in Channelview city occurs at 23:00 to 01:00âLT, contributed mostly by benzene (56â%), which indicates industrial sources with small amounts of toluene (19â%), xylenes (13â%), styrene (4.8â%), and ethylbenzene (7â%) (Fig.Â 8a). The second case, Bayland Park (latitude 29.69, longitude â95.49), located nearby on the western side of Houston, presents the same level of the peak SBTEX concentration (about 12âppb) (Fig.Â 9a) as Channelview city. In contrast to Channelview city, the peak concentration of Bayland Park occurs at the traffic rush hour (07:00 to 08:00âLT), contributed mostly by toluene (53â%) and xylenes (23â%) (indicating mobile vehicle sources) rather than benzene (18â%). Meanwhile, the adjusted industry emission sources, as presented in TableÂ S5, play a significant role in driving the peak concentration (0.4âppb) in Channelview city (Fig.Â 8b) yet exhibit a reduced impact on Bayland Park (Fig.Â 9b), which is far from the industry area.\n\nA similar pattern is also shown in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (latitude 30.46, longitude â91.17), located near downtown Baton Rouge (affected by on-road sources) and also close to the industry area (â¼1.6âkm from the north). Like the Houston industry area, the daytime SBTEX concentration is much lower (<3âppb) than nighttime, and the peak SBTEX concentration (about 9.4âppb) occurs at 22:00âLT (Fig.Â 10). Because Baton Rouge is impacted by both traffic and industrial sources, emissions differ from Houston in that both benzene (35â%â40â%) and toluene (35â%â40â%) become the major portion of SBTEX (Fig.Â 10a). The missing emission sources (Fig.Â 10b) will further enhance the peak concentration by 2âppb at 05:00â08:00âLT, with the largest chemical contribution from toluene (about 70â%â85â%), followed by the styrene (about 7â%â20â%) associated with the industrial sources.\n\nTo address the urgent need for health assessment of SBTEX exposures in the Gulf region, this study developed high spatiotemporally resolved emissions and concentrations of the individual SBTEX. The HAPI program was developed and implemented to identify and gap-fill the missing SBTEX inventory for the SMOKE emission modeling system. Then, the state-of-the-science chemical transport modeling system, CAMx, was applied to generate the high temporal and spatial resolution predictions of explicit SBTEX concentrations based on the improved SBTEX emission inventory and the Reactive Tracer (RTRAC) feature. The modeled average SBTEX concentrations exhibit good agreement with observational data (R is 0.75 and NMB is improved in the Adj case to â5.6â% for the total SBTEX), suggesting that the emissions and concentration estimates developed in this study can be used to support well the SBTEX-related human health studies in the Gulf region.\n\nThis study found that the on-road sector contributes the most to the total xylenes (46â%), toluene (48â%), and ethylbenzene (60â%) emissions, while the styrene emissions are mostly contributed by non-EGU point sources (ptnonipm, 69â%) but were substantially underestimated in the original NEI data, resulting in 34â% underestimation of total styrene emissions. The highest SBTEX concentration (3.07âppb) occurs near Lake Charles, followed by Baton Rouge (2.06âppb), Houston ship channel (2.04âppb), Shreveport (1.69âppb), Beaumont (1.59âppb), corresponding to a large amount of SBTEX emissions in these cities.\n\nThe 5-month average SBTEX modeled concentrations are close to the average measurement data (R of total SBTEX is 0.74, benzene is 0.68, toluene is 0.45, xylenes is 0.77, ethylbenzene is 0.77, and styrene is 0.64). These spatiotemporally fine modeled air SBTEX concentrations can be used for conducting epidemiologic analyses or in risk assessment. The diurnal variation of SBTEX concentrations that is opposite to its emissions pattern indicates that the concentration is more sensitive to emission at night than daytime. The high SBTEX concentration during nighttime affects individuals who engage in more nighttime activities or reside in houses lacking isolation of outdoor air. Therefore, the HAP emission control policy should also focus on nighttime emissions. Further, the hourly SBTEX data can be used in epidemiologic analyses to investigate effects of acute exposures and short-term changes in those exposures.\n\nThis study acknowledges the considerable uncertainties in this approach, including the accuracy of emission data, the meteorological condition data, oxidant concentrations (OH radical, O3, and NO3) simulation in the CB6 mechanism. There are limited observational data to verify the model performance. This study is mainly based on the bottom-up NEI dataset, thus the uncertainties in the original NEI emissions and SMOKE process influenced on this study. For example, despite our implementation of imputation for the HAP annual data, the emission activity within hourly, daily, and monthly temporal profiles as well as parameters (e.g., emission rates, and compositions) also remains unchanged. The emergency emissions from unreported flaring (such as final treatment equipment) or leakage events that have not been considered in the original NEI, also not included in this study. Further, the concentrations of oxidants are simulated in the CAMx model with the CB6r4 mechanism; this mechanism is designed to simulate ozone and PM. Therefore, the model species OH radical, NO3, and O3 may differ from the actual concentrations. These oxidant concentrations affect the chemical decay rate, especially in big metropolitan cities with higher NOx emissions. Nevertheless, the high spatiotemporally resolved emissions and concentrations of individual SBTEX developed in this study, with acceptable performance, can be a good reference dataset to support SBTEX-related human health studies in the Gulf region.Â In addition, this approach can be extended to other chemical compounds to estimate their concentrations. The US EPA provides emission data for approximately 100 HAPs in the NEI for certain emission sources. Those emission data can also be processed to derive HAP concentrations. The dataset provided in this study will facilitate epidemiologic studies of SBTEX exposures in relation to a range of health outcomes in the Gulf region and can be extended to provide similar health research opportunities elsewhere.\n\nAl-Harbi, M., Alhajri, I., AlAwadhi, A., and Whalen, J.
