What exactly to you want to create or analyze?

Hello Abinaya,

I would suggest downloading the following for use in ArcGIS Pro to make 3D building from your footprints. If you data is classified or unclassified, you could also extract buildings from the lidar itself. You will need Spatial Analyst and 3D Analyst extensions for this.

Local Government 3D Basemaps (Making buildings LOD2 with lidar)

http://solutions.arcgis.com/local-government/help/local-government-scenes/

Local Government 3D Basemaps is an ArcGIS Pro project that can be used to author high-quality 3D scenes for your local government. These scenes are organized in different Levels of Detail (LOD) and derived from 2D operational data managed by a department or agency within a local government. Once authored, the 3D scenes are a foundation for 3D workflows and applications; and provide a consistent geographic context across local government departments and agencies.

3D Mapping with Lidar Point Clouds (Extracting Buildings)

http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=06dfb37ca4b94e05bd3507cc4424804f

Included in this download are all the scripts, tools, geodatabases, sample data, and documentation needed to complete the exercises for the hands-on workshop "3D Mapping with Lidar Point Clouds" presented at Esri's 2017 Imaging and Mapping Forum. The exercises include:

Extracting Building Footprints from Classified Lidar

Extracting Building Footprints from Unclassified Lidar

Here's an example of some lidar extract buildings (Classified for buildings) that was run through the Local Government 3D Basemaps process in a scene layer:

Check out my blog for how to apply the colors to the buildings.
