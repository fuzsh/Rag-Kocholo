        "text": "President of Russia (1999–2008, 2012–present)\n\n\"Putin\" redirects here. For other uses, see Putin (disambiguation).\n\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is Vladimirovich and the family name is Putin.\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich Putin[c] (born 7 October 1952) is a Russian politician and former intelligence officer who is the president of Russia. Putin has held continuous positions as president or prime minister since 1999:[d] as prime minister from 1999 to 2000 and from 2008 to 2012, and as president from 2000 to 2008 and since 2012.[e][7] He is the longest-serving Russian or Soviet leader since Joseph Stalin.\n\nPutin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsin's resignation, Putin became acting president and, in less than four months, was elected to his first term as president. He was reelected in 2004. Due to constitutional limitations of two consecutive presidential terms, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev. He returned to the presidency in 2012, following an election marked by allegations of fraud and protests, and was reelected in 2018.\n\nDuring Putin's initial presidential tenure, the Russian economy grew on average by seven percent per year,[8] driven by economic reforms and a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas.[9][10] Additionally, Putin led Russia in a conflict against Chechen separatists, reestablishing federal control over the region.[11][12] While serving as prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw a military conflict with Georgia and enacted military and police reforms. In his third presidential term, Russia annexed Crimea and supported a war in eastern Ukraine through several military incursions, resulting in international sanctions and a financial crisis in Russia. He also ordered a military intervention in Syria to support his ally Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war, ultimately securing permanent naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean.[13][14][15]\n\nIn February 2022, during his fourth presidential term, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which prompted international condemnation and led to expanded sanctions. In September 2022, he announced a partial mobilization and forcibly annexed four Ukrainian oblasts into Russia. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes[16] related to his alleged criminal responsibility for illegal child abductions during the war.[17] In April 2021, after a referendum, he signed into law constitutional amendments that included one allowing him to run for reelection twice more, potentially extending his presidency to 2036.[18][19] In June 2023, he survived the Wagner Group rebellion. In March 2024, he was reelected for another term.\n\nUnder Putin's rule, the Russian political system has been transformed into an authoritarian dictatorship.[20][21][22] His rule has been marked by endemic corruption and widespread human rights violations, including the imprisonment and suppression of political opponents, intimidation and censorship of independent media in Russia, and a lack of free and fair elections.[23][24][25] Putin's Russia has consistently received low scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, The Economist Democracy Index, Freedom House's Freedom in the World index, and the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index.\n\nEarly life\n\nPutin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia),[26] the youngest of three children of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin (1911–1999) and Maria Ivanovna Putina (née Shelomova; 1911–1998). His grandfather, Spiridon Putin (1879–1965), was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.[27][28] Putin's birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and Viktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 during the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi Germany's forces in World War II.[29][30]\n\nPutin's mother was a factory worker, and his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. During the early stage of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, his father served in the destruction battalion of the NKVD.[31][32][33] Later, he was transferred to the regular army and was severely wounded in 1942.[34] Putin's maternal grandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941, and his maternal uncles disappeared on the Eastern Front during World War II.[35]\n\nEducation\n\nOn 1 September 1960, Putin started at School No. 193 at Baskov Lane, near his home. He was one of a few in his class of about 45 pupils who were not yet members of the Young Pioneer organization. At the age of 12, he began to practise sambo and judo.[36] In his free time, he enjoyed reading the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Lenin.[37] Putin attended Saint Petersburg High School 281 with a German language immersion program.[38] He is fluent in German and often gives speeches and interviews in that language.[39] Putin learned English as an adult, and he is not as fluent in English as he is in German.\n\nPutin studied law at the Leningrad State University named after Andrei Zhdanov (now Saint Petersburg State University) in 1970 and graduated in 1975.[40] His thesis was on \"The Most Favored Nation Trading Principle in International Law.\"[41] While there, he was required to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU); he remained a member until it ceased to exist in 1991.[42] Putin met Anatoly Sobchak, an assistant professor who taught business law,[f] and who later became the co-author of the Russian constitution. Putin was influential in Sobchak's career in Saint Petersburg, and Sobchak was influential in Putin's career in Moscow.[43]\n\nIn 1997, Putin received a degree in economics (kandidat ekonomicheskikh nauk) at the Saint Petersburg Mining University for a thesis on energy dependencies and their instrumentalisation in foreign policy.[44][45] His supervisor was Vladimir Litvinenko, who in 2000 and again in 2004 managed his presidential election campaigns in St Petersburg.[46] Igor Danchenko and Clifford Gaddy consider Putin to be a plagiarist according to Western standards. One book from which he copied entire paragraphs is the Russian-language edition of King and Cleland's Strategic Planning and Policy (1978).[46] Balzer wrote on the Putin thesis and Russian energy policy and concludes along with Olcott that \"The primacy of the Russian state in the country’s energy sector is non-negotiable,\" and cites the insistence on majority Russian ownership of any joint-venture, particularly since BASF signed the Gazprom Nord Stream-Yuzhno-Russkoye deal in 2004 with a 49–51 structure, as opposed to the older 50–50 split of British Petroleum's TNK-BP project.[47]\n\nKGB career\n\nIn 1975, Putin joined the KGB and trained at the 401st KGB School in Okhta, Leningrad.[48][49] After training, he worked in the Second Chief Directorate (counterintelligence), before he was transferred to the First Chief Directorate, where he monitored foreigners and consular officials in Leningrad.[48][50][51] In September 1984, Putin was sent to Moscow for further training at the Yuri Andropov Red Banner Institute.[52][53][54]\n\nFrom 1985 to 1990, he served in Dresden, East Germany,[55] using a cover identity as a translator.[56] While posted in Dresden, Putin worked as one of the KGB's liaison officers to the Stasi secret police and was reportedly promoted to lieutenant colonel. According to the official Kremlin presidential site, the East German communist regime commended Putin with a bronze medal for \"faithful service to the National People's Army.\" Putin has publicly conveyed delight over his activities in Dresden, once recounting his confrontations with anti-communist protestors of 1989 who attempted the occupation of Stasi buildings in the city.[57]\n\n\"Putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press clippings, thus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the KGB,\" Russian-American Masha Gessen wrote in their 2012 biography of Putin.[56] His work was also downplayed by former Stasi spy chief Markus Wolf and Putin's former KGB colleague Vladimir Usoltsev. Journalist Catherine Belton wrote in 2020 that this downplaying was actually cover for Putin's involvement in KGB coordination and support for the terrorist Red Army Faction, whose members frequently hid in East Germany with the support of the Stasi. Dresden was preferred as a \"marginal\" town with only a small presence of Western intelligence services.[58] According to an anonymous source who claimed to be a former RAF member, at one of these meetings in Dresden the militants presented Putin with a list of weapons that were later delivered to the RAF in West Germany. Klaus Zuchold, who claimed to be recruited by Putin, said that Putin handled a neo-Nazi, Rainer Sonntag, and attempted to recruit an author of a study on poisons.[58] Putin reportedly met Germans to be recruited for wireless communications affairs together with an interpreter. He was involved in wireless communications technologies in South-East Asia due to trips of German engineers, recruited by him, there and to the West.[51] However, a 2023 investigation by Der Spiegel reported that the anonymous source had never been an RAF member and is \"considered a notorious fabulist\" with \"several previous convictions, including for making false statements.\"[59]\n\nAccording to Putin's official biography, during the fall of the Berlin Wall that began on 9 November 1989, he saved the files of the Soviet Cultural Center (House of Friendship) and of the KGB villa in Dresden for the official authorities of the would-be united Germany to prevent demonstrators, including KGB and Stasi agents, from obtaining and destroying them. He then supposedly burnt only the KGB files, in a few hours, but saved the archives of the Soviet Cultural Center for the German authorities. Nothing is told about the selection criteria during this burning; for example, concerning Stasi files or about files of other agencies of the German Democratic Republic or of the USSR. He explained that many documents were left to Germany only because the furnace burst but many documents of the KGB villa were sent to Moscow.[61]\n\nAfter the collapse of the Communist East German government, Putin was to resign from active KGB service because of suspicions aroused regarding his loyalty during demonstrations in Dresden and earlier, though the KGB and the Soviet Army still operated in eastern Germany. He returned to Leningrad in early 1990 as a member of the \"active reserves,\" where he worked for about three months with the International Affairs section of Leningrad State University, reporting to Vice-Rector Yuriy Molchanov, while working on his doctoral dissertation.[51]\n\nThere, he looked for new KGB recruits, watched the student body, and renewed his friendship with his former professor, Anatoly Sobchak, soon to be the Mayor of Leningrad.[62] Putin claims that he resigned with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 20 August 1991,[62] on the second day of the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt against Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev.[63] Putin said: \"As soon as the coup began, I immediately decided which side I was on,\" although he noted that the choice was hard because he had spent the best part of his life with \"the organs.\"[64]\n\nPolitical career\n\nSee also: Politics of Russia\n\n1990–1996: Saint Petersburg administration\n\nIn May 1990, Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to the mayor of Leningrad Anatoly Sobchak. In a 2017 interview with Oliver Stone, Putin said that he resigned from the KGB in 1991, following the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev, as he did not agree with what had happened and did not want to be part of the intelligence in the new administration.[65] According to Putin's statements in 2018 and 2021, he may have worked as a private taxi driver to earn extra money, or considered such a job.[66][67]\n\nOn 28 June 1991, he became head of the Committee for External Relations of the Mayor's Office, with responsibility for promoting international relations and foreign investments[69] and registering business ventures. Within a year, Putin was investigated by the city legislative council led by Marina Salye. It was concluded that he had understated prices and permitted the export of metals valued at $93 million in exchange for foreign food aid that never arrived.[70][40] Despite the investigators' recommendation that Putin be fired, Putin remained head of the Committee for External Relations until 1996.[71][72] From 1994 to 1996, he held several other political and governmental positions in Saint Petersburg.\n\nIn March 1994, Putin was appointed as first deputy chairman of the Government of Saint Petersburg. In May 1995, he organized the Saint Petersburg branch of the pro-government Our Home – Russia political party, the liberal party of power founded by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. In 1995, he managed the legislative election campaign for that party, and from 1995 through June 1997, he was the leader of its Saint Petersburg branch.\n\n1996–1999: Early Moscow career\n\nIn June 1996, Sobchak lost his bid for re-election in Saint Petersburg, and Putin, who had led his election campaign, resigned from his positions in the city administration. He moved to Moscow and was appointed as deputy chief of the Presidential Property Management Department headed by Pavel Borodin. He occupied this position until March 1997. He was responsible for the foreign property of the state and organized the transfer of the former assets of the Soviet Union and the CPSU to the Russian Federation.[43]\n\nOn 26 March 1997, President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin deputy chief of the Presidential Staff, a post which he retained until May 1998, and chief of the Main Control Directorate of the Presidential Property Management Department (until June 1998). His predecessor in this position was Alexei Kudrin and his successor was Nikolai Patrushev, both future prominent politicians and Putin's associates.[43] On 3 April 1997, Putin was promoted to 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation – the highest federal state civilian service rank.[73]\n\nOn 27 June 1997, at the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute, guided by rector Vladimir Litvinenko, Putin defended his Candidate of Science dissertation in economics, titled Strategic Planning of the Reproduction of the Mineral Resource Base of a Region under Conditions of the Formation of Market Relations.[74] This exemplified the custom in Russia whereby a young rising official would write a scholarly work in mid-career.[75] Putin's thesis was plagiarized.[76] Fellows at the Brookings Institution found that 15 pages were copied from an American textbook.[77]\n\nOn 25 May 1998, Putin was appointed First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff for the regions, in succession to Viktoriya Mitina. On 15 July, he was appointed head of the commission for the preparation of agreements on the delimitation of the power of the regions and head of the federal center attached to the president, replacing Sergey Shakhray. After Putin's appointment, the commission completed no such agreements, although during Shakhray's term as the head of the Commission 46 such agreements had been signed.[79] Later, after becoming president, Putin cancelled all 46 agreements.[43] On 25 July 1998, Yeltsin appointed Putin director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the primary intelligence and security organization of the Russian Federation and the successor to the KGB.[80] In 1999, Putin described communism as \"a blind alley, far away from the mainstream of civilization.\"[81]\n\n1999: First premiership\n\nFurther information: Vladimir Putin's First Cabinet\n\nOn 9 August 1999, Putin was appointed one of three first deputy prime ministers, and later on that day, was appointed acting prime minister of the Government of the Russian Federation by President Yeltsin.[82] Yeltsin also announced that he wanted to see Putin as his successor. Later on that same day, Putin agreed to run for the presidency.[83]\n\nOn 16 August, the State Duma approved his appointment as prime minister with 233 votes in favor (vs. 84 against, 17 abstained),[84] while a simple majority of 226 was required, making him Russia's fifth prime minister in fewer than eighteen months. On his appointment, few expected Putin, virtually unknown to the general public, to last any longer than his predecessors. He was initially regarded as a Yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of Boris Yeltsin, Putin did not choose ministers himself, his cabinet was determined by the presidential administration.[85]\n\nYeltsin's main opponents and would-be successors were already campaigning to replace the ailing president, and they fought hard to prevent Putin's emergence as a potential successor. Following the September 1999 Russian apartment bombings and the invasion of Dagestan by mujahideen, including the former KGB agents, based in the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Putin's law-and-order image and unrelenting approach to the Second Chechen War soon combined to raise his popularity and allowed him to overtake his rivals.\n\nWhile not formally associated with any party, Putin pledged his support to the newly formed Unity Party,[86] which won the second largest percentage of the popular vote (23.3%) in the December 1999 Duma elections, and in turn supported Putin.\n\n1999–2000: Acting presidency\n\nMain article: Putin's rise to power\n\nOn 31 December 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and, according to the Constitution of Russia, Putin became Acting President of the Russian Federation. On assuming this role, Putin went on a previously scheduled visit to Russian troops in Chechnya.[87]\n\nThe first presidential decree that Putin signed on 31 December 1999 was titled \"On guarantees for the former president of the Russian Federation and the members of his family.\"[88][89] This ensured that \"corruption charges against the outgoing President and his relatives\" would not be pursued.[90] This was most notably targeted at the Mabetex bribery case in which Yeltsin's family members were involved. On 30 August 2000, a criminal investigation (number 18/238278-95) in which Putin himself,[91][92] as a member of the Saint Petersburg city government, was one of the suspects, was dropped.\n\nOn 30 December 2000, yet another case against the prosecutor general was dropped \"for lack of evidence,\" despite thousands of documents having been forwarded by Swiss prosecutors.[93] On 12 February 2001, Putin signed a similar federal law which replaced the decree of 1999. A case regarding Putin's alleged corruption in metal exports from 1992 was brought back by Marina Salye, but she was silenced and forced to leave Saint Petersburg.[94]\n\nWhile his opponents had been preparing for an election in June 2000, Yeltsin's resignation resulted in the presidential elections being held on 26 March 2000; Putin won in the first round with 53% of the vote.[95][96]\n\n2000–2004: First presidential term\n\nThe inauguration of President Putin occurred on 7 May 2000. He appointed the minister of finance, Mikhail Kasyanov, as prime minister.[97] The first major challenge to Putin's popularity came in August 2000, when he was criticized for the alleged mishandling of the Kursk submarine disaster.[98] That criticism was largely because it took several days for Putin to return from vacation, and several more before he visited the scene.[98]\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004, Putin set about the reconstruction of the impoverished condition of the country, apparently winning a power-struggle with the Russian oligarchs, reaching a 'grand bargain' with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support for – and alignment with – Putin's government.[99][100]\n\nThe Moscow theater hostage crisis occurred in October 2002. Many in the Russian press and in the international media warned that the deaths of 130 hostages in the special forces' rescue operation during the crisis would severely damage President Putin's popularity. However, shortly after the siege had ended, the Russian president enjoyed record public approval ratings – 83% of Russians declared themselves satisfied with Putin and his handling of the siege.[101]\n\nIn 2003, a referendum was held in Chechnya, adopting a new constitution which declares that the Republic of Chechnya is a part of Russia; on the other hand, the region did acquire autonomy.[102] Chechnya has been gradually stabilized with the establishment of the Parliamentary elections and a Regional Government.[103][104] Throughout the Second Chechen War, Russia severely disabled the Chechen rebel movement; however, sporadic attacks by rebels continued to occur throughout the northern Caucasus.[105]\n\n2004–2008: Second presidential term\n\nOn 14 March 2004, Putin was elected to the presidency for a second term, receiving 71% of the vote.[107] The Beslan school hostage crisis took place on 1–3 September 2004; more than 330 people died, including 186 children.[108]\n\nThe near 10-year period prior to the rise of Putin after the dissolution of Soviet rule was a time of upheaval in Russia.[109] In a 2005 Kremlin speech, Putin characterized the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century.\"[110] Putin elaborated, \"Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself.\"[111] The country's cradle-to-grave social safety net was gone and life expectancy declined in the period preceding Putin's rule.[112] In 2005, the National Priority Projects were launched to improve Russia's health care, education, housing, and agriculture.[113][114]\n\nThe continued criminal prosecution of the wealthiest man in Russia at the time, president of Yukos oil and gas company Mikhail Khodorkovsky, for fraud and tax evasion was seen by the international press as a retaliation for Khodorkovsky's donations to both liberal and communist opponents of the Kremlin.[115] Khodorkovsky was arrested, Yukos was bankrupted, and the company's assets were auctioned at below-market value, with the largest share acquired by the state company Rosneft.[116] The fate of Yukos was seen as a sign of a broader shift of Russia towards a system of state capitalism.[117][118] This was underscored in July 2014, when shareholders of Yukos were awarded $50 billion in compensation by the Permanent Arbitration Court in The Hague.[119]\n\nOn 7 October 2006, Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist who exposed corruption in the Russian army and its conduct in Chechnya, was shot in the lobby of her apartment building, on Putin's birthday. The death of Politkovskaya triggered international criticism, with accusations that Putin had failed to protect the country's new independent media.[120][121] Putin himself said that her death caused the government more problems than her writings.[122]\n\nIn January 2007, Putin met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at his Black Sea residence in Sochi, two weeks after Russia switched off oil supplies to Germany. Putin brought his black Labrador Konni in front of Merkel, who has a noted phobia of dogs and looked visibly uncomfortable in its presence, adding \"I'm sure it will behave itself,\" causing a furor among the German press corps.[123][124] When asked about the incident in a January 2016 interview with Bild, Putin claimed he was not aware of her phobia, adding \"I wanted to make her happy. When I found out that she did not like dogs, I of course apologized.\"[125] Merkel later told a group of reporters \"I understand why he has to do this – to prove he's a man. He's afraid of his own weakness. Russia has nothing, no successful politics or economy. All they have is this.\"[124]\n\nIn a speech in February 2007 at the Munich Security Conference, Putin complained about the feeling of insecurity engendered by the dominant position in geopolitics of the United States, and observed that a former NATO official had made rhetorical promises not to expand into new countries in Eastern Europe.\n\nOn 14 July 2007, Putin announced that Russia would suspend implementation of its Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe obligations, effective after 150 days,[126][127] and suspend its ratification of the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which treaty was shunned by NATO members abeyant Russian withdrawal from Transnistria and the Republic of Georgia. Moscow continued to participate in the joint consultative group, because it hoped that dialogue could lead to the creation of an effective, new conventional arms control regime in Europe.[128] Russia did specify steps that NATO could take to end the suspension. \"These include [NATO] members cutting their arms allotments and further restricting temporary weapons deployments on each NATO member's territory. Russia also want[ed] constraints eliminated on how many forces it can deploy in its southern and northern flanks. Moreover, it is pressing NATO members to ratify a 1999 updated version of the accord, known as the Adapted CFE Treaty, and demanding that the four alliance members outside the original treaty, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovenia, join it.\"[127]\n\nIn early 2007, \"Dissenters' Marches\" were organized by the opposition group The Other Russia,[129] led by former chess champion Garry Kasparov and national-Bolshevist leader Eduard Limonov. Following prior warnings, demonstrations in several Russian cities were met by police action, which included interfering with the travel of the protesters and the arrests of as many as 150 people who attempted to break through police lines.[130]\n\nOn 12 September 2007, Putin dissolved the government upon the request of Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov. Fradkov commented that it was to give the President a \"free hand\" in the run-up to the parliamentary election. Viktor Zubkov was appointed the new prime minister.[131]\n\nOn 19 September 2007 Putin's nuclear-capable bombers commenced exercises near the US, for the first time since the downfall of the USSR.[132]\n\nIn December 2007, United Russia – the governing party that supports the policies of Putin – won 64.24% of the popular vote in their run for State Duma according to election preliminary results.[133] United Russia's victory in the December 2007 elections was seen by many as an indication of strong popular support of the then Russian leadership and its policies.[134][135]\n\nOn 11 February 2008 while Putin addressed the 15th anniversary party of Gazprom, its employees threatened Ukraine with a stoppage of flow.[132]\n\nOn 4 April 2008 at the NATO Bucharest summit, invitee Putin told George W. Bush and other conference delegates: \"We view the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our border as a direct threat to the security of our nation. The claim that this process is not directed against Russia will not suffice. National security is not based on promises.\"[132]\n\n2008–2012: Second premiership\n\nSee also: Presidency of Dmitry Medvedev\n\nPutin was barred from a third consecutive term by the Constitution. First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was elected his successor. In a power-switching operation on 8 May 2008, only a day after handing the presidency to Medvedev, Putin was appointed Prime Minister of Russia, maintaining his political dominance.[136]\n\nPutin has said that overcoming the consequences of the world economic crisis was one of the two main achievements of his second premiership.[114] The other was stabilizing the size of Russia's population between 2008 and 2011 following a long period of demographic collapse that began in the 1990s.[114] It was during this premiership that the 2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute occurred, and Putin controlled the Gazprom chess-board, according to Andriy Kobolyev, who was then an advisor to the CEO of the Ukrainian Naftogaz utility. Putin observed at a German trade show in 2010 that if his hosts did not want Russia's natural gas nor nuclear power they could always heat with wood, and for that they would need to log Siberia.[132]\n\nAt the United Russia Congress in Moscow on 24 September 2011, Medvedev officially proposed that Putin stand for the presidency in 2012, an offer Putin accepted. Given United Russia's near-total dominance of Russian politics, many observers believed that Putin was assured of a third term. The move was expected to see Medvedev stand on the United Russia ticket in the parliamentary elections in December, with a goal of becoming prime minister at the end of his presidential term.[137]\n\nAfter the parliamentary elections on 4 December 2011, tens of thousands of Russians engaged in protests against alleged electoral fraud, the largest protests in Putin's time. Protesters criticized Putin and United Russia and demanded annulment of the election results.[138] Those protests sparked the fear of a colour revolution in society.[139] Putin allegedly organized a number of paramilitary groups loyal to himself and to the United Russia party in the period between 2005 and 2012.[140]\n\n2012–2018: Third presidential term\n\nShortly after Medvedev took office in 2008, presidential terms were extended from four to six years, effective with the 2012 election.[141]\n\nOn 24 September 2011, while speaking at the United Russia party congress, Medvedev announced that he would recommend the party nominate Putin as its presidential candidate. He also revealed that the two men had long ago cut a deal to allow Putin to run for president in 2012.[142] This switch was termed by many in the media as \"Rokirovka,\" the Russian term for the chess move \"castling.\"[143]\n\nOn 4 March 2012, Putin won the 2012 Russian presidential election in the first round, with 63.6% of the vote, despite widespread accusations of vote-rigging.[144][145][146] Opposition groups accused Putin and the United Russia party of fraud.[147] While efforts to make the elections transparent were publicized, including the usage of webcams in polling stations, the vote was criticized by the Russian opposition and by international observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe for procedural irregularities.[148]\n\nAnti-Putin protests took place during and directly after the presidential campaign. The most notorious protest was the Pussy Riot performance on 21 February, and subsequent trial.[149] An estimated 8,000–20,000 protesters gathered in Moscow on 6 May,[150][151] when eighty people were injured in confrontations with police,[152] and 450 were arrested, with another 120 arrests taking place the following day.[153] A counter-protest of Putin supporters occurred which culminated in a gathering of an estimated 130,000 supporters at the Luzhniki Stadium, Russia's largest stadium.[154] Some of the attendees stated that they had been paid to come, were forced to come by their employers, or were misled into believing that they were going to attend a folk festival instead.[155][156][157] The rally is considered to be the largest in support of Putin to date.[158]\n\nPutin's presidency was inaugurated in the Kremlin on 7 May 2012.[159] On his first day as president, Putin issued 14 presidential decrees, which are sometimes called the \"May Decrees\" by the media, including a lengthy one stating wide-ranging goals for the Russian economy. Other decrees concerned education, housing, skilled labor training, relations with the European Union, the defense industry, inter-ethnic relations, and other policy areas dealt with in Putin's program articles issued during the presidential campaign.[160]\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Putin and the United Russia party backed stricter legislation against the LGBT community, in Saint Petersburg, Archangelsk, and Novosibirsk; a law called the Russian gay propaganda law, that is against \"homosexual propaganda\" (which prohibits such symbols as the rainbow flag,[161][162] as well as published works containing homosexual content) was adopted by the State Duma in June 2013.[163][164] Responding to international concerns about Russia's legislation, Putin asked critics to note that the law was a \"ban on the propaganda of pedophilia and homosexuality\" and he stated that homosexual visitors to the 2014 Winter Olympics should \"leave the children in peace\" but denied there was any \"professional, career or social discrimination\" against homosexuals in Russia.[165]\n\nIn June 2013, Putin attended a televised rally of the All-Russia People's Front where he was elected head of the movement,[166] which was set up in 2011.[167] According to journalist Steve Rosenberg, the movement is intended to \"reconnect the Kremlin to the Russian people\" and one day, if necessary, replace the increasingly unpopular United Russia party that currently backs Putin.[168]\n\nAnnexation of Crimea\n\nIn February 2014, Russia made several military incursions into Ukrainian territory. After the Euromaidan protests and the fall of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian soldiers without insignias took control of strategic positions and infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. Russia then annexed Crimea and Sevastopol after a referendum in which, according to official results, Crimeans voted to join the Russian Federation.[169][170][171] Subsequently, demonstrations against Ukrainian Rada legislative actions by pro-Russian groups in the Donbas area of Ukraine escalated into the Russo-Ukrainian War between the Ukrainian government and the Russia-backed separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. In August 2014,[172] Russian military vehicles crossed the border in several locations of Donetsk Oblast.[173][174][175] The incursion by the Russian military was seen by Ukrainian authorities as responsible for the defeat of Ukrainian forces in early September.[176][177]\n\nIn October 2014, Putin addressed Russian security concerns in Sochi at the Valdai International Discussion Club.\n\nIn November 2014, the Ukrainian military reported intensive movement of troops and equipment from Russia into the separatist-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine.[178] The Associated Press reported 80 unmarked military vehicles on the move in rebel-controlled areas.[179] An OSCE Special Monitoring Mission observed convoys of heavy weapons and tanks in DPR-controlled territory without insignia.[180] OSCE monitors further stated that they observed vehicles transporting ammunition and soldiers' dead bodies crossing the Russian-Ukrainian border under the guise of humanitarian-aid convoys.[181]\n\nAs of early August 2015, the OSCE observed over 21 such vehicles marked with the Russian military code for soldiers killed in action.[182] According to The Moscow Times, Russia has tried to intimidate and silence human-rights workers discussing Russian soldiers' deaths in the conflict.[183] The OSCE repeatedly reported that its observers were denied access to the areas controlled by \"combined Russian-separatist forces.\"[184]\n\nIn October 2015, The Washington Post reported that Russia had redeployed some of its elite units from Ukraine to Syria in recent weeks to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.[185] In December 2015, Putin admitted that Russian military intelligence officers were operating in Ukraine.[186]\n\nThe Moscow Times quoted pro-Russian academic Andrei Tsygankov as saying that many members of the international community assumed that Putin's annexation of Crimea had initiated a completely new kind of Russian foreign policy[187][188] and that his foreign policy had shifted \"from state-driven foreign policy\" to taking an offensive stance to recreate the Soviet Union. In July 2015, he opined that this policy shift could be understood as Putin trying to defend nations in Russia's sphere of influence from \"encroaching western power.\"[189]\n\nIntervention in Syria\n\nOn 30 September 2015, President Putin authorized Russian military intervention in the Syrian civil war, following a formal request by the Syrian government for military help against rebel and jihadist groups.[190]\n\nThe Russian military activities consisted of air strikes, cruise missile strikes and the use of front line advisors and Russian special forces against militant groups opposed to the Syrian government, including the Syrian opposition, as well as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda in the Levant), Tahrir al-Sham, Ahrar al-Sham, and the Army of Conquest.[191][192] After Putin's announcement on 14 March 2016 that the mission he had set for the Russian military in Syria had been \"largely accomplished\" and ordered the withdrawal of the \"main part\" of the Russian forces from Syria,[193] Russian forces deployed in Syria continued to actively operate in support of the Syrian government.[194]\n\nRussia's interference in the 2016 US election\n\nSee also: Russia–United States relations\n\nIn January 2017, a U.S. intelligence community assessment expressed high confidence that Putin personally ordered an influence campaign, initially to denigrate Hillary Clinton and to harm her electoral chances and potential presidency, then later developing \"a clear preference\" for Donald Trump.[195] Trump consistently denied any Russian interference in the U.S. election,[196][197][198] as did Putin in December 2016,[199] March 2017,[200] June 2017,[201][202][203] and July 2017.[204]\n\nPutin later stated that interference was \"theoretically possible\" and could have been perpetrated by \"patriotically minded\" Russian hackers,[205] and on another occasion claimed \"not even Russians, but Ukrainians, Tatars or Jews, but with Russian citizenship\" might have been responsible.[206] In July 2018, The New York Times reported that the CIA had long nurtured a Russian source who eventually rose to a position close to Putin, allowing the source to pass key information in 2016 about Putin's direct involvement.[207] Putin continued similar attempts in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[208]\n\n2018–2024: Fourth presidential term\n\nPutin won the 2018 Russian presidential election with more than 76% of the vote.[209] His fourth term began on 7 May 2018,[210] and will last until 2024.[211] On the same day, Putin invited Dmitry Medvedev to form a new government.[212] On 15 May 2018, Putin took part in the opening of the movement along the highway section of the Crimean bridge.[213] On 18 May 2018, Putin signed decrees on the composition of the new Government.[214] On 25 May 2018, Putin announced that he would not run for president in 2024, justifying this in compliance with the Russian Constitution.[215] On 14 June 2018, Putin opened the 21st FIFA World Cup, which took place in Russia for the first time. On 18 October 2018, Putin said Russians will 'go to Heaven as martyrs' in the event of a nuclear war as he would only use nuclear weapons in retaliation.[216] In September 2019, Putin's administration interfered with the results of Russia's nationwide regional elections and manipulated it by eliminating all candidates in the opposition. The event that was aimed at contributing to the ruling party, United Russia's victory, also contributed to inciting mass protests for democracy, leading to large-scale arrests and cases of police brutality.[217]\n\nOn 15 January 2020, Medvedev and his entire government resigned after Putin's 2020 Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly. Putin suggested major constitutional amendments that could extend his political power after presidency.[218][219] At the same time, on behalf of Putin, he continued to exercise his powers until the formation of a new government.[220] Putin suggested that Medvedev take the newly created post of deputy chairman of the Security Council.[221]\n\nOn the same day, Putin nominated Mikhail Mishustin, head of the country's Federal Tax Service for the post of prime minister. The next day, he was confirmed by the State Duma to the post,[222][223] and appointed prime minister by Putin's decree.[224] This was the first time ever that a prime minister was confirmed without any votes against. On 21 January 2020, Mishustin presented to Putin a draft structure of his Cabinet. On the same day, the president signed a decree on the structure of the Cabinet and appointed the proposed ministers.[225][226][227]\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Russia\n\nOn 15 March 2020, Putin instructed to form a Working Group of the State Council to counteract the spread of COVID-19. Putin appointed Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin as the head of the group.[228]\n\nOn 22 March 2020, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Putin arranged the Russian army to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy, which was the European country hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.[229] Putin began working remotely from his office at Novo-Ogaryovo. According to Dmitry Peskov, Putin passed daily tests for COVID-19, and his health was not in danger.[230][231]\n\nOn 25 March, President Putin announced in a televised address to the nation that the 22 April constitutional referendum would be postponed due to COVID-19.[232] He added that the next week would be a nationwide paid holiday and urged Russians to stay at home.[233][234] Putin also announced a list of measures of social protection, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and changes in fiscal policy.[235] Putin announced the following measures for microenterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses: deferring tax payments (except Russia's value-added tax) for the next six months, cutting the size of social security contributions in half, deferring social security contributions, deferring loan repayments for the next six months, a six-month moratorium on fines, debt collection, and creditors' applications for bankruptcy of debtor enterprises.[236][237]\n\nOn 2 April 2020, Putin again issued an address in which he announced prolongation of the non-working time until 30 April.[238] Putin likened Russia's fight against COVID-19 to Russia's battles with invading Pecheneg and Cuman steppe nomads in the 10th and 11th centuries.[239] In a 24 to 27 April Levada poll, 48% of Russian respondents said that they disapproved of Putin's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic,[240] and his strict isolation and lack of leadership during the crisis was widely commented as sign of losing his \"strongman\" image.[241][242]\n\nIn June 2021, Putin said he was fully vaccinated against the disease with the Sputnik V vaccine, emphasising that while vaccinations should be voluntary, making them mandatory in some professions would slow down the spread of COVID-19.[244] In September, Putin entered self-isolation after people in his inner circle tested positive for the disease.[245]\n\nAccording to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Putin's inner circle of advisors shrank during the COVID-19 lockdown to a small number of hawkish advisers.[246]\n\nConstitutional referendum and amendments\n\nMain article: 2020 Russian constitutional referendum\n\nPutin signed an executive order on 3 July 2020 to officially insert amendments into the Russian Constitution, allowing him to run for two additional six-year terms. These amendments took effect on 4 July 2020.[247]\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, protests were held in the Khabarovsk Krai in Russia's Far East in support of arrested regional governor Sergei Furgal.[248] The 2020 Khabarovsk Krai protests became increasingly anti-Putin over time.[249][250] A July 2020 Levada poll found that 45% of surveyed Russians supported the protests.[251]\n\nOn 22 December 2020, Putin signed a bill giving lifetime prosecutorial immunity to Russian ex-presidents.[252][253]\n\nIran trade deal\n\nSee also: Iran–Russia relations\n\nPutin met Iran President Ebrahim Raisi in January 2022 to lay the groundwork for a 20-year deal between the two nations.[254]\n\n2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis\n\nIn July 2021, Putin published an essay titled On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians, in which he states that Belarusians, Ukrainians and Russians should be in one All-Russian nation as a part of the Russian world and are \"one people\" whom \"forces that have always sought to undermine our unity\" wanted to \"divide and rule.\"[255] The essay denies the existence of Ukraine as an independent nation.[256][257]\n\nOn 30 November 2021, Putin stated that an enlargement of NATO in Ukraine would be a \"red line\" issue for Russia.[258][259][260] The Kremlin repeatedly denied that it had any plans to invade Ukraine,[261][262][263] and Putin himself dismissed such fears as \"alarmist.\"[264] On 21 February 2022, Putin signed a decree recognizing the two self proclaimed separatist republics in Donbas as independent states and made an address concerning the events in Ukraine.[265]\n\nPutin was persuaded to invade Ukraine by a small group of his closest associates, especially Nikolai Patrushev, Yury Kovalchuk and Alexander Bortnikov.[266] According to sources close to the Kremlin, most of Putin's advisers and associates opposed the invasion, but Putin overruled them. The invasion of Ukraine had been planned for almost a year.[267]\n\nFull-scale invasion of Ukraine (2022–present)\n\nOn 24 February, Putin in a televised address announced a \"special military operation\"[268] in Ukraine,[269][270] launching a full-scale invasion of the country.[271] Citing a purpose of \"denazification,\" he claimed to be doing this to protect people in the predominantly Russian-speaking region of Donbas who, according to Putin, faced \"humiliation and genocide\" from Ukraine for eight years.[272] Minutes after the speech, he launched a war to gain control of the remainder of the country and overthrow the elected government under the pretext that it was run by Nazis.[273][274]\n\nRussia's invasion was met with international condemnation.[275][276][277] International sanctions were widely imposed against Russia, including against Putin personally.[278][279] The invasion also led to numerous calls for Putin to be pursued with war crime charges.[280][281][282][283] The International Criminal Court (ICC) stated that it would investigate the possibility of war crimes in Ukraine since late 2013,[284] and the United States pledged to help the ICC to prosecute Putin and others for war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine.[285] In response to these condemnations, Putin put the Strategic Rocket Forces's nuclear deterrence units on high alert.[286] By early March, U.S. intelligence agencies determined that Putin was \"frustrated\" by slow progress due to an unexpectedly strong Ukrainian defense.[287]\n\nOn 4 March, Putin signed into law a bill introducing prison sentences of up to 15 years for those who publish \"knowingly false information\" about the Russian military and its operations, leading to some media outlets in Russia to stop reporting on Ukraine.[288] On 7 March, as a condition for ending the invasion, the Kremlin demanded Ukraine's neutrality, recognition of Crimea as Russian territory, and recognition of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.[289][290] On 16 March, Putin issued a warning to Russian \"traitors\" who he said the West wanted to use as a \"fifth column\" to destroy Russia.[291][292] Following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022,[293] Russia's long-term demographic crisis deepened due to emigration, lower fertility rates and war-related casualties.[294]\n\nAs early as 25 March, the UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights reported that Putin ordered a \"kidnapping\" policy, whereby Ukrainian nationals who did not cooperate with the Russian takeover of their homeland were victimized by FSB agents.[295][296] On 28 March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was \"99.9 percent sure\" that Putin thought the Ukrainians would welcome the invading forces with \"flowers and smiles\" while he opened the door to negotiations on the offer that Ukraine would henceforth be a non-aligned state.[297]\n\nOn 21 September, Putin announced a partial mobilization, following a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv and the announcement of annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine.[298]\n\nOn 30 September, Putin signed decrees which annexed Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson Oblasts of Ukraine into the Russian Federation. The annexations are not recognized by the international community, and are illegal under international law.[299] On 11 November the same year, Ukraine liberated Kherson.[300]\n\nIn December 2022, he said that a war against Ukraine could be a \"long process.\"[301] Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the Russo-Ukrainian War since February 2022.[302][303] In January 2023, Putin cited recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the annexed territories as a condition for peace talks with Ukraine.[304]\n\nOn 20–22 March 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Russia and met with Vladimir Putin both in official and unofficial capacity.[305] It was the first international meeting of Vladimir Putin since the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest.[306]\n\nIn May 2023, South Africa announced that it would grant diplomatic immunity to Vladimir Putin to attend the 15th BRICS Summit in Johannesburg despite the ICC arrest warrant.[307] In July 2023, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that Putin would not attend the summit \"by mutual agreement\" and would instead send Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.[308]\n\nIn July 2023, Putin threatened to take \"reciprocal action\" if Ukraine used US-supplied cluster munitions during a Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russian forces in occupied southeastern Ukraine.[309] On 17 July 2023, Putin withdrew from a deal that allowed Ukraine to export grain across the Black Sea despite a wartime blockade,[310] risking deepening the global food crisis and antagonizing neutral countries in the Global South.[311]\n\nOn 27–28 July, Putin hosted the 2023 Russia–Africa Summit in St. Petersburg,[312] which was attended by delegations from more than 40 African countries.[313]\n\nAs of August 2023, the total number of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers killed or wounded during the Russian invasion of Ukraine was nearly 500,000.[314]\n\nPutin condemned the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that sparked the Israel–Hamas war and said Israel had a right to defend itself, but also criticized Israel's response and said Israel should not besiege the Gaza Strip in the way Nazi Germany besieged Leningrad. Putin suggested that Russia could be a mediator in the conflict.[315][316] Putin blamed the war on the United States' failed foreign policy in the Middle East and expressed concern over the suffering of Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip.[317] In a December 2023 call between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Putin, Netanyahu expressed displeasure over Russia's conduct at the United Nations and described its growing ties to Iran as dangerous.[318]\n\nOn 22 November 2023, Putin claimed that Russia was always \"ready for talks\" to end the \"tragedy\" of the war in Ukraine, and accused the Ukrainian leadership of rejecting peace talks with Russia.[319] However, on 14 December 2023, Putin said \"there will only be peace in Ukraine when we achieve our aims,\" which he said are \"de-Nazification, de-militarization and a neutral status\" of Ukraine.[320] On 23 December 2023, The New York Times reported that Putin has been signaling through intermediaries since at least September 2022 that \"he is open to a ceasefire that freezes the fighting along the current lines.\"[321]\n\nICC arrest warrant\n\nOn 17 March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin's arrest,[322][323][324][325] alleging that Putin held criminal responsibility in the illegal deportation and transfer of children from Ukraine to Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[326][327][328]\n\nIt was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of one of the five Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council,[322] (the world's five principal nuclear powers).[329]\n\nThe ICC simultaneously issued an arrest warrant for Maria Lvova-Belova, Commissioner for Children's Rights in the Office of the President of the Russian Federation. Both are charged with:\n\n...the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation,...[324]\n\n...for their publicized program, since 24 February 2022, of forced deportations of thousands of unaccompanied Ukrainian children to Russia, from areas of eastern Ukraine under Russian control.[322][324] Russia has maintained that the deportations were humanitarian efforts to protect orphans and other children abandoned in the conflict region.[322]\n\n2023 Wagner rebellion\n\nMain article: Wagner Group rebellion\n\nOn 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, rebelled against the government of Russia. The revolt arose amidst escalating tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defense and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner.[330]\n\nPrigozhin portrayed the rebellion as a response to an alleged attack on his forces by the ministry.[331][332] He dismissed the government's justification for invading Ukraine,[333] blamed Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu for the country's military shortcomings,[334] and accused him of waging the war for the benefit of Russian oligarchs.[335][336] In a televised address on 24 June, Russian president Vladimir Putin denounced Wagner's actions as treason and pledged to quell the rebellion.[332][337]\n\nPrigozhin's forces seized control of Rostov-on-Don and the Southern Military District headquarters and advanced towards Moscow in an armored column.[338] Following negotiations with Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko,[339] Prigozhin agreed to stand down[340] and, late on 24 June, began withdrawing from Rostov-on-Don.[341]\n\nOn 23 August 2023, exactly two months after the rebellion, Prigozhin was killed along with nine other people when a business jet crashed in Tver Oblast, north of Moscow.[342] Western intelligence reported that the crash was likely caused by an explosion on board, and it is widely suspected that the Russian state were involved.[343]\n\n2024–present: Fifth presidential term\n\nPutin won the 2024 Russian presidential election with 88.48% of the vote. International observers did not consider the election to be either free or fair,[344] with Putin having increased political repressions after launching his full-scale war with Ukraine in 2022.[345][346] The elections were also held in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.[346] There were reports of irregularities, including ballot stuffing and coercion,[347] with statistical analysis suggesting unprecedented levels of fraud in the 2024 elections.[348]\n\nOn 22 March 2024, the Crocus City Hall attack took place, causing the deaths of at least 144 people and injuring at least 551 more.[349][350] It was the deadliest terrorist attack on Russian soil since the Beslan school siege in 2004.[351][352]\n\nOn 7 May 2024, Putin was inaugurated as president of Russia for the fifth time.[353] According to analysts, replacing Sergei Shoigu with Andrey Belousov as defense minister signals that Putin wants to transform the Russian economy into a war economy and is \"preparing for many more years of war.\"[354][355] In May 2024, four Russian sources told Reuters that Putin was ready to end the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire that would recognize Russia's war gains and freeze the war on current front lines, as Putin wanted to avoid unpopular steps like further nationwide mobilization and increased war spending.[356]\n\nDomestic policies\n\nPutin's domestic policies, particularly early in his first presidency, were aimed at creating a vertical power structure. On 13 May 2000, he issued a decree organizing the 89 federal subjects of Russia into seven administrative federal districts and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of those districts (whose official title is Plenipotentiary Representative).[357]\n\nAccording to Stephen White, under the presidency of Putin, Russia made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a \"second edition\" of the American or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions and circumstances.[358] Some commentators have described Putin's administration as a \"sovereign democracy.\"[359][360][361] According to the proponents of that description (primarily Vladislav Surkov), the government's actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular support within Russia itself and not be directed or influenced from outside the country.[362]\n\nThe practice of the system is characterized by Swedish economist Anders Åslund as manual management, commenting: \"After Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, his rule is best described as 'manual management' as the Russians like to put it. Putin does whatever he wants, with little consideration to the consequences with one important caveat. During the Russian financial crash of August 1998, Putin learned that financial crises are politically destabilizing and must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, he cares about financial stability.\"[363]\n\nThe period after 2012 saw mass protests against the falsification of elections, censorship and toughening of free assembly laws. In July 2000, according to a law proposed by Putin and approved by the Federal Assembly of Russia, Putin gained the right to dismiss the heads of the 89 federal subjects. In 2004, the direct election of those heads (usually called \"governors\") by popular vote was replaced with a system whereby they would be nominated by the president and approved or disapproved by regional legislatures.[364][365]\n\nThis was seen by Putin as a necessary move to stop separatist tendencies and get rid of those governors who were connected with organised crime.[366] This and other government actions effected under Putin's presidency have been criticized by many independent Russian media outlets and Western commentators as anti-democratic.[367][368]\n\nDuring his first term in office, Putin opposed some of the Yeltsin-era business oligarchs, as well as his political opponents, resulting in the exile or imprisonment of such people as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky; other oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich and Arkady Rotenberg are friends and allies with Putin.[369] Putin succeeded in codifying land law and tax law and promulgated new codes on labor, administrative, criminal, commercial and civil procedural law.[370] Under Medvedev's presidency, Putin's government implemented some key reforms in the area of state security, the Russian police reform and the Russian military reform.[371]\n\nEconomic, industrial, and energy policies\n\nSergey Guriyev, when talking about Putin's economic policy, divided it into four distinct periods: the \"reform\" years of his first term (1999–2003); the \"statist\" years of his second term (2004 – the first half of 2008); the world economic crisis and recovery (the second half of 2008–2013); and the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russia's growing isolation from the global economy, and stagnation (2014–present).[372]\n\nIn 2000, Putin launched the \"Programme for the Socio-Economic Development of the Russian Federation for the Period 2000–2010,\" but it was abandoned in 2008 when it was 30% complete.[373] Fueled by the 2000s commodities boom including record-high oil prices,[9][10] under the Putin administration from 2000 to 2016, an increase in income in USD terms was 4.5 times.[374] During Putin's first eight years in office, industry grew substantially, as did production, construction, real incomes, credit, and the middle class.[375][376] A fund for oil revenue allowed Russia to repay Soviet Union's debts by 2005. Russia joined the World Trade Organization in August 2012.[377]\n\nIn 2006, Putin launched an industry consolidation programme to bring the main aircraft-producing companies under a single umbrella organization, the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC).[378][379] In September 2020, the UAC general director announced that the UAC will receive the largest-ever post-Soviet government support package for the aircraft industry in order to pay and renegotiate the debt.[380][381]\n\nIn 2014, Putin signed a deal to supply China with 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Power of Siberia, which Putin has called the \"world's biggest construction project,\" was launched in 2019 and is expected to continue for 30 years at an ultimate cost to China of $400bn.[383] The ongoing financial crisis began in the second half of 2014 when the Russian ruble collapsed due to a decline in the price of oil and international sanctions against Russia. These events in turn led to loss of investor confidence and capital flight, though it has also been argued that the sanctions had little to no effect on Russia's economy.[384][385][386] In 2014, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project named Putin their Person of the Year for furthering corruption and organized crime.[387][388]\n\nAccording to Meduza, Putin has since 2007 predicted on a number of occasions that Russia will become one of the world's five largest economies. In 2013, he said Russia was one of the five biggest economies in terms of gross domestic product but still lagged behind other countries on indicators such as labour productivity.[389] By the end of 2023, Putin planned to spend almost 40% of public expenditures on defense and security.[390]\n\nEnvironmental policy\n\nIn 2004, Putin signed the Kyoto Protocol treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[391] However, Russia did not face mandatory cuts, because the Kyoto Protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from 1990 levels and Russia's greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the Soviet Union.[392]\n\nReligious policy\n\nMain article: Religion in Russia\n\nPutin regularly attends the most important services of the Russian Orthodox Church on the main holy days and has established a good relationship with Patriarchs of the Russian Church, the late Alexy II of Moscow and the current Kirill of Moscow. As president, Putin took an active personal part in promoting the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate, signed 17 May 2007, which restored relations between the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia after the 80-year schism.[393]\n\nUnder Putin, the Hasidic Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia became increasingly influential within the Jewish community, partly due to the influence of Federation-supporting businessmen mediated through their alliances with Putin, notably Lev Leviev and Roman Abramovich.[394][395] According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Putin is popular amongst the Russian Jewish community, who see him as a force for stability. Russia's chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, said Putin \"paid great attention to the needs of our community and related to us with a deep respect.\"[396] In 2016, Ronald S. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, also praised Putin for making Russia \"a country where Jews are welcome.\"[397]\n\nHuman rights organizations and religious freedom advocates have criticized the state of religious freedom in Russia.[398] In 2016, Putin oversaw the passage of legislation that prohibited missionary activity in Russia.[398] Nonviolent religious minority groups have been repressed under anti-extremism laws, especially Jehovah's Witnesses.[399]\n\nOne of the 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia has a constitutional reference to God.[400]\n\nMilitary development\n\nMain article: 2008 Russian military reform\n\nThe resumption of long-distance flights of Russia's strategic bombers was followed by the announcement by Russian Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov during his meeting with Putin on 5 December 2007, that 11 ships, including the aircraft carrier Kuznetsov, would take part in the first major navy sortie into the Mediterranean since Soviet times.[401][402]\n\nWhile from the early 2000s Russia started placing more money into its military and defense industry, it was only in 2008 that full-scale Russian military reform began, aiming to modernize the Russian Armed Forces and make them significantly more effective. The reform was largely carried out by Defense Minister Serdyukov during Medvedev's presidency, under the supervision of both Putin, as the head of government, and Medvedev, as the commander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces.[citation needed]\n\nKey elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million, reducing the number of officers, centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres, creating a professional NCO corps, reducing the size of the central command, introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff, elimination of cadre-strength formations, reorganising the reserves, reorganising the army into a brigade system, and reorganising air forces into an airbase system instead of regiments.[citation needed]\n\nAccording to the Kremlin, Putin embarked on a build-up of Russia's nuclear capabilities because of U.S. President George W. Bush's unilateral decision to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.[404] To counter what Putin sees as the United States' goal of undermining Russia's strategic nuclear deterrent, Moscow has embarked on a program to develop new weapons capable of defeating any new American ballistic missile defense or interception system. Some analysts believe that this nuclear strategy under Putin has brought Russia into violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.[405]\n\nAccordingly, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would no longer consider itself bound by the treaty's provisions, raising nuclear tensions between the two powers.[405] This prompted Putin to state that Russia would not launch first in a nuclear conflict but that \"an aggressor should know that vengeance is inevitable, that he will be annihilated, and we would be the victims of the aggression. We will go to heaven as martyrs.\"[406]\n\nPutin has also sought to increase Russian territorial claims in the Arctic and its military presence there. In August 2007, Russian expedition Arktika 2007, part of research related to the 2001 Russian territorial extension claim, planted a flag on the seabed at the North Pole.[407] Both Russian submarines and troops deployed in the Arctic have been increasing.[408][409]\n\nHuman rights policy\n\nMain article: Human rights in Russia\n\nNew York City-based NGO Human Rights Watch, in a report entitled Laws of Attrition, authored by Hugh Williamson, the British director of HRW's Europe & Central Asia Division, has claimed that since May 2012, when Putin was reelected as president, Russia has enacted many restrictive laws, started inspections of non-governmental organizations, harassed, intimidated and imprisoned political activists, and started to restrict critics. The new laws include the \"foreign agents\" law, which is widely regarded as over-broad by including Russian human rights organizations which receive some international grant funding, the treason law, and the assembly law which penalizes many expressions of dissent.[410][411] Human rights activists have criticized Russia for censoring speech of LGBT activists due to \"the gay propaganda law\"[412] and increasing violence against LGBT+ people due to the law.[413][414][415]\n\nIn 2020, Putin signed a law on labelling individuals and organizations receiving funding from abroad as \"foreign agents.\" The law is an expansion of \"foreign agent\" legislation adopted in 2012.[416][417]\n\nAs of June 2020, per Memorial Human Rights Center, there were 380 political prisoners in Russia, including 63 individuals prosecuted, directly or indirectly, for political activities (including Alexey Navalny) and 245 prosecuted for their involvement with one of the Muslim organizations that are banned in Russia. 78 individuals on the list, i.e., more than 20% of the total, are residents of Crimea.[418][419] As of December 2022, more than 4,000 people were prosecuted for criticizing the war in Ukraine under Russia's war censorship laws.[420]\n\nThe media\n\nScott Gehlbach, a professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, has claimed that since 1999, Putin has systematically punished journalists who challenge his official point of view.[422] Maria Lipman, an American writing in Foreign Affairs claims, \"The crackdown that followed Putin's return to the Kremlin in 2012 extended to the liberal media, which had until then been allowed to operate fairly independently.\"[423] The Internet has attracted Putin's attention because his critics have tried to use it to challenge his control of information.[424] Marian K. Leighton, who worked for the CIA as a Soviet analyst in the 1980s says, \"Having muzzled Russia's print and broadcast media, Putin focused his energies on the Internet.\"[425]\n\nRobert W. Orttung and Christopher Walker reported that \"Reporters Without Borders, for instance, ranked Russia 148 in its 2013 list of 179 countries in terms of freedom of the press. It particularly criticized Russia for the crackdown on the political opposition and the failure of the authorities to vigorously pursue and bring to justice criminals who have murdered journalists. Freedom House ranks Russian media as \"not free,\" indicating that basic safeguards and guarantees for journalists and media enterprises are absent.\"[426] About two-thirds of Russians use television as their primary source of daily news.[427]\n\nIn the early 2000s, Putin and his circle began promoting the idea in Russian media that they are the modern-day version of the 17th-century Romanov tsars who ended Russia's \"Time of Troubles,\" meaning they claim to be the peacemakers and stabilizers after the fall of the Soviet Union.[428]\n\nPromoting conservatism\n\nPutin has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural, and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and neoliberalism and is identified by scholars with Russian conservatism.[429] Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by the conservative right-wing journalist Alexander Prokhanov, stresses (i) Russian nationalism, (ii) the restoration of Russia's historical greatness, and (iii) systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.[430] Vladislav Surkov, a senior government official, has been one of the key economics consultants during Putin's presidency.[431]\n\nIn cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012 stating Putin's terms were like \"a miracle of God.\"[432] Steven Myers reports, \"The church, once heavily repressed, had emerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions... Now Kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state.\"[433]\n\nMark Woods, a Baptist Union of Great Britain minister and contributing editor to Christian Today, provides specific examples of how the Church has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.[434] Some Russian Orthodox believers consider Putin a corrupt and brutal strongman or even a tyrant. Others do not admire him but appreciate that he aggravates their political opponents. Still others appreciate that Putin defends some although not all Orthodox teachings, whether or not he believes in them himself.[435]\n\nOn abortion, Putin stated: \"In the modern world, the decision is up to the woman herself.\"[436] This put him at odds with the Russian Orthodox Church.[437] In 2020, he supported efforts to reduce the number of abortions instead of prohibiting it.[438] On 28 November 2023, during a speech to the World Russian People's Council, Putin urged Russian women to have \"seven, eight, or even more children\" and said \"large families must become the norm, a way of life for all of Russia's people.\"[439]\n\nPutin supported the 2020 Russian constitutional referendum, which passed and defined marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman in the Constitution of Russia.[440][441][442]\n\nInternational sporting events\n\nIn 2007, Putin led a successful effort on behalf of Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics,[443] the first Winter Olympic Games to ever be hosted by Russia. In 2008, the city of Kazan won the bid for the 2013 Summer Universiade; on 2 December 2010, Russia won the right to host the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup, also for the first time in Russian history. In 2013, Putin stated that gay athletes would not face any discrimination at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.[444]\n\nForeign policy\n\nGenerally, Putin's tenure experiences tensions with the west.[445][446] Anna Borshchevskaya, in her 2022 book, summarizes Putin main foreign policy objectives as originating in his 30 December 1999 document which appeared on the government's website, \"Russia at the Turn of the Millenium.\"[447] She presents Putin as orienting himself to the plan that \"Russia is a country with unique values in danger of losing its unity – which... is a historic Russian fear. This again points to the fundamental issue of Russia's identity issues – and how the state had manipulated these to drive anti-Western security narratives with the aim of eroding the US-led global order... Moreover, a look at Russia's distribution of forces over the years under Putin has been heavily weighted towards the south (Syria, Ukraine, Middle East), another indicator of the Kremlin's threat perceptions.\"[448][449]\n\nLeonid Bershidsky analyzed Putin's interview with the Financial Times and concluded, \"Putin is an imperialist of the old Soviet school, rather than a nationalist or a racist, and he has cooperated with, and promoted, people who are known to be gay.\"[450] Putin spoke favorably of artificial intelligence in regards to foreign policy, \"Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\"[451]\n\nAsia\n\nIn 2012, Putin wrote an article in Indian newspaper The Hindu, saying: \"The Declaration on Strategic Partnership between India and Russia signed in October 2000 became a truly historic step.\"[452][453] India remains the largest customer of Russian military equipment, and the two countries share a historically strong strategic and diplomatic relationship.[454] In October 2022, Putin described India and China as \"close allies and partners.\"[455]\n\nUnder Putin, Russia has maintained positive relations with the Asian states of SCO and BRICS, which include China, India, Pakistan, and post-Soviet states of Central Asia.[456][457] In the 21st century, Sino-Russian relations have significantly strengthened bilaterally and economically – the Treaty of Friendship, and the construction of the ESPO oil pipeline and the Power of Siberia gas pipeline formed a \"special relationship\" between the two great powers.[458]\n\nPutin and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe frequently met each other to discuss the Japan–Russia territorial disputes. Putin also voiced his willingness of constructing a rail bridge between the two countries.[459] Despite numerous meetings, no agreement was signed before Abe's resignation in 2020.[460][461]\n\nPutin made three visits to Mongolia and has enjoyed good relations with its neighbor. Putin and his Mongolian counterpart signed a permanent treaty on friendship between the two states in September 2019, further enhancing trade and cultural exchanges.[462][463] Putin became the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit Indonesia in half a century in 2007, resulting in the signing of an arms deal.[464] In another visit, Putin commented on long-standing ties and friendship between Russia and Indonesia.[465] Russia has also boosted relations with Vietnam after 2011,[466] and with Afghanistan in the 2010s, giving military and economic aid.[467][468] The relations between Russia and the Philippines received a boost in 2016 as Putin forged closer bilateral ties with his Filipino counterpart, Rodrigo Duterte.[469][470] Putin has good relations with Malaysia and its then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.[471] Putin also made the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit North Korea, meeting Kim Jong-il in July 2000, shortly after a visit to South Korea.[472]\n\nPutin criticized violence in Myanmar against Rohingya minorities in 2017.[473] Following the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état, Russia has pledged to boost ties with the Myanmar military regime.[474]\n\nPost-Soviet states\n\nSee also: Commonwealth of Independent States\n\nUnder Putin, the Kremlin has consistently stated that Russia has a sphere of influence and \"privileged interests\" over other Post-Soviet states, which are referred to as the \"near abroad\" in Russia. It has also been stated that the post-Soviet states are strategically vital to Russian interests.[475] Some Russia experts have compared this concept to the Monroe Doctrine.[476]\n\nA series of so-called colour revolutions in the post-Soviet states, namely the Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan in 2005, led to frictions in the relations of those countries with Russia. In December 2004, Putin criticized the Rose and Orange revolutions, saying: \"If you have permanent revolutions you risk plunging the post-Soviet space into endless conflict.\"[477]\n\nPutin allegedly declared at a NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine joined NATO Russia could contend to annex the Ukrainian East and Crimea.[478] At the summit, he told U.S. President George W. Bush that \"Ukraine is not even a state!\" while the following year Putin referred to Ukraine as \"Little Russia.\"[479] Following the Revolution of Dignity in March 2014, the Russian Federation annexed Crimea.[480][481][482] According to Putin, this was done because \"Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia.\"[483]\n\nAfter the Russian annexation of Crimea, he said that Ukraine includes \"regions of Russia's historic south\" and \"was created on a whim by the Bolsheviks.\"[484] He went on to declare that the February 2014 ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had been orchestrated by the West as an attempt to weaken Russia. \"Our Western partners have crossed a line. They behaved rudely, irresponsibly and unprofessionally,\" he said, adding that the people who had come to power in Ukraine were \"nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and anti-Semites.\"[484]\n\nIn a July 2014 speech during a Russian-supported armed insurgency in Eastern Ukraine, Putin stated he would use Russia's \"entire arsenal of available means\" up to \"operations under international humanitarian law and the right of self-defence\" to protect Russian speakers outside Russia.[485][486] With the attainment of autocephaly by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in December 2018 and subsequent schism of the Russian Orthodox Church from Constantinople, a number of experts came to the conclusion that Putin's policy of forceful engagement in post-Soviet republics significantly backfired on him, leading to a situation where he \"annexed Crimea, but lost Ukraine,\" and provoked a much more cautious approach to Russia among other post-Soviet countries.[487][488]\n\nIn late August 2014, Putin stated: \"People who have their own views on history and the history of our country may argue with me, but it seems to me that the Russian and Ukrainian peoples are practically one people.\"[489] After making a similar statement, in late December 2015 he stated: \"the Ukrainian culture, as well as Ukrainian literature, surely has a source of its own.\"[490] In July 2021, he published a lengthy article On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians[491] revisiting these themes, and saying the formation of a Ukrainian state hostile to Moscow was \"comparable in its consequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against us,\"[492][493] – it was made mandatory reading for military-political training in the Russian Armed Forces.[494]\n\nIn August 2008, Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili attempted to restore control over the breakaway South Ossetia. However, the Georgian military was soon defeated in the resulting 2008 South Ossetia War after regular Russian forces entered South Ossetia and then other parts of Georgia, then also opened a second front in the other Georgian breakaway province of Abkhazia with Abkhazian forces.[495][496]\n\nDespite existing or past tensions between Russia and most of the post-Soviet states, Putin has followed the policy of Eurasian integration. Putin endorsed the idea of a Eurasian Union in 2011;[497][498] the concept was proposed by the president of Kazakhstan in 1994.[499] On 18 November 2011, the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement setting a target of establishing the Eurasian Union by 2015.[500] The Eurasian Union was established on 1 January 2015.[501]\n\nUnder Putin, Russia's relations have improved significantly with Uzbekistan, the second largest post-Soviet republic after Ukraine. This was demonstrated in Putin's visit to Tashkent in May 2000, after lukewarm relations under Yeltsin and Islam Karimov who had long distanced itself from Moscow.[502] In another meeting in 2014, Russia agreed to write off Uzbek debt.[503]\n\nA theme of a greater Soviet region, including the former USSR and many of its neighbors or imperial-era states – rather than just post-Soviet Russia – has been consistent in Putin's May Day speeches.[504][505][506]\n\nOn 22 December 2022, Putin addressed the Security Council in a speech where he did not use the term \"Special Military Operation\" but instead called the fighting in Ukraine a \"war.\" Anti-Putin activists have called for Putin to be prosecuted for breaking a law passed to stop people calling the Special Military Operation a war. This law carries a penalty of up to 15 years in jail.[507]\n\nOn 25 December, he openly declared in a TV interview that the goal of the invasion is \"to unite the Russian people.\"[508]\n\nOn 14 December 2023, President Putin held a press conference where he indicated that Russian would only negotiate with Ukraine \"when we achieve our objectives.\" He stated that another mobilization wasn't required as \"617,000\" Russian soldiers were fighting in Ukraine.[509]\n\nUnited States, Western Europe, and NATO\n\nUnder Putin, Russia's relationships with NATO and the U.S. have passed through several stages. When he first became president, relations were cautious, but after the 9/11 attacks Putin quickly supported the U.S. in the War on Terror and the opportunity for partnership appeared.[511] According to Stephen F. Cohen, the U.S. \"repaid by further expansion of NATO to Russia's borders and by unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,\"[511] but others pointed out the applications from new countries willing to join NATO was driven primarily by Russian's behavior in Chechnya, Transnistria, Abkhazia, Yanayev putsch as well as calls to restore USSR in its previous borders by prominent Russian politicians.[512][513]\n\nFrom 2003, when Russia strongly opposed the U.S. when it waged the Iraq War, Putin became ever more distant from the West, and relations steadily deteriorated. According to Russia scholar Stephen F. Cohen, the narrative of the mainstream U.S. media, following that of the White House, became anti-Putin.[511] In an interview with Michael Stürmer, Putin said there were three questions which most concerned Russia and Eastern Europe: namely, the status of Kosovo, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and American plans to build missile defence sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, and suggested that all three were linked.[514] His view was that concessions by the West on one of the questions might be met with concessions from Russia on another.[514]\n\nIn a January 2007 interview, Putin said Russia was in favor of a democratic multipolar world and strengthening the systems of international law.[516] In February 2007, Putin criticized what he called the United States' monopolistic dominance in global relations, and \"almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations.\" He said the result of it is that \"no one feels safe! Because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them. Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race.\"[517] This came to be known as the Munich Speech, and NATO secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called the speech \"disappointing and not helpful.\"[518]\n\nThe months following Putin's Munich Speech[517] were marked by tension and a surge in rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic. Both Russian and American officials, however, denied the idea of a new Cold War.[519] Putin publicly opposed plans for the U.S. missile shield in Europe and presented President George W. Bush with a counterproposal on 7 June 2007 which was declined.[520] Russia suspended its participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty on 11 December 2007.[521]\n\nPutin opposed Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, warning that it would destabilize the whole system of international relations.[522][better source needed] He described the recognition of Kosovo's independence by several major world powers as \"a terrible precedent, which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations, developed not over decades, but over centuries,\" and that \"they have not thought through the results of what they are doing. At the end of the day it is a two-ended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face.\"[523] In March 2014, Putin used Kosovo's declaration of independence as a justification for recognizing the independence of Crimea, citing the so-called \"Kosovo independence precedent.\"[524][525]\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. in 2001, Putin had good relations with American President George W. Bush, and many western European leaders. His \"cooler\" and \"more business-like\" relationship with German chancellor, Angela Merkel is often attributed to Merkel's upbringing in the former DDR, where Putin was stationed as a KGB agent.[526] He had a very friendly and warm relationship with the former Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi;[527] the two leaders often described their relationship as a close friendship, continuing to organize bilateral meetings even after Berlusconi's resignation in November 2011.[528] When Berlusconi died in 2023, Putin described him as an \"extraordinary man\" and a \"true friend.\"[529][530]\n\nThe NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011 prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders, including Putin, who said that the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 is \"defective and flawed,\" adding: \"It allows everything. It resembles medieval calls for crusades.\"[531]\n\nIn late 2013, Russian-American relations deteriorated further when the United States canceled a summit for the first time since 1960 after Putin gave asylum to American Edward Snowden, who had leaked massive amounts of classified information from the NSA.[532][533] In 2014, Russia was suspended from the G8 group as a result of its annexation of Crimea.[534][535] Putin gave a speech highly critical of the United States, accusing them of destabilizing world order and trying to \"reshape the world\" to its own benefit.[536] In June 2015, Putin said that Russia has no intention of attacking NATO.[537]\n\nOn 9 November 2016, Putin congratulated Donald Trump on becoming the 45th president of the United States.[539] In December 2016, US intelligence officials (headed by James Clapper) quoted by CBS News stated that Putin approved the email hacking and cyber attacks during the U.S. election, against the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. A spokesman for Putin denied the reports.[540] Putin has repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton, who served as U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 of interfering in Russia's internal affairs,[541] and in December 2016, Clinton accused Putin of having a personal grudge against her.[542][543]\n\nWith the election of Trump, Putin's favorability in the U.S. increased. A Gallup poll in February 2017 revealed a positive view of Putin among 22% of Americans, the highest since 2003.[544] Putin has stated that U.S.–Russian relations, already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War,[545] have continued to deteriorate after Trump took office in January 2017.[546]\n\nOn 18 June 2020, The National Interest published a nine-thousand-word essay by Putin, titled \"The Real Lessons of the 75th Anniversary of World War II.\"[547] In the essay, Putin criticizes the Western historical view of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as the start of World War II, stating that the Munich Agreement was the beginning.[548]\n\nOn 21 February 2023, Putin suspended Russia's participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States.[549]\n\nOn 25 March, President Putin announced the stationing of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Russia would maintain control of the weapons. President Putin told Russian TV: \"There is nothing unusual here either. Firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades. They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries.\"[550]\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn 2003, relations between Russia and the United Kingdom deteriorated when the United Kingdom granted political asylum to Putin's former patron, oligarch Boris Berezovsky.[551] This deterioration was intensified by allegations that the British were spying and making secret payments to pro-democracy and human rights groups.[552] A survey conducted in the United Kingdom in 2022 found Putin to be among the least popular foreign leaders, with 8% of British respondents holding a positive opinion.[553]\n\nPoisoning of Alexander Litvinenko\n\nMain article: Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko\n\nThe end of 2006 brought more strained relations in the wake of the death by polonium poisoning in London of former KGB and FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who became an MI6 agent in 2003. In 2007, the crisis in relations continued with the expulsion of four Russian envoys over Russia's refusal to extradite former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi to face charges in the murder.[551] Mirroring the British actions, Russia expelled UK diplomats and took other retaliatory steps.[551]\n\nIn 2015, the British Government launched a public inquiry into Litvinenko's death, presided over by Robert Owen, a former British High Court judge.[554] The Owen report, published on 21 January 2016, stated \"The FSB operation to kill Mr. Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr Patrushev and also by President Putin.\"[555] The report outlined some possible motives for the murder, including Litvinenko's public statements and books about the alleged involvement of the FSB in mass murder, and what was \"undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism\" between Putin and Litvinenko.[556]\n\nPoisoning of Sergei Skripal\n\nOn 4 March 2018, former double agent Sergei Skripal was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent in Salisbury.[557] Ten days later, the British government formally accused the Russian state of attempted murder, a charge which Russia denied.[558] After the UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats (an action which would later be responded to with a Russian expulsion of 23 British diplomats),[559] British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on 16 March that it was \"overwhelmingly likely\" Putin had personally ordered the poisoning of Skripal. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegation \"shocking and unpardonable diplomatic misconduct.\"[560]\n\nLatin America\n\nPutin and his successor, Medvedev, enjoyed warm relations with Hugo Chávez of Venezuela. Much of this has been through the sale of military equipment; since 2005, Venezuela has purchased more than $4 billion worth of arms from Russia.[561] In September 2008, Russia sent Tupolev Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela to carry out training flights.[562] In November 2008, both countries held a joint naval exercise in the Caribbean. Earlier in 2000, Putin had re-established stronger ties with Fidel Castro's Cuba.[563]\n\n\"You express the best masculine qualities,\" Putin told Jair Bolsonaro in 2020. \"You look for solutions in all matters, always putting above all the interests of your people, your country, leaving out your own personal issues.\" Political scientist Oliver Stuenkel noted, \"Among Brazil's right-wing populists, Putin is seen as someone who is anti-woke, and that is seen as something that is definitely appealing to Bolsonaro. He is a strongman, and that is very inspiring to Bolsonaro. He would like to be someone who concentrates as much power.\"[564]\n\nAustralia and the South Pacific\n\nSee also: Australia–Russia relations\n\nIn September 2007, Putin visited Indonesia, the first Russian leader to do so in over 50 years.[565] In the same month, Putin also attended the APEC meeting held in Sydney, Australia, where he met with Prime Minister John Howard and signed a uranium trade deal for Australia to sell uranium to Russia. This was the first visit by a Russian president to Australia.[566] Putin again visited Australia for 2014 G20 Brisbane summit. The Abbott government denounced Putin's use of military force in Ukraine in 2014 as \"bullying\" and \"utterly unacceptable.\"[567]\n\nAmid calls to ban Putin from attending the 2014 G20 Summit, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he would \"shirtfront\" (challenge) the Russian leader over the shooting down of MH17 by Russian-backed rebels, which had killed 38 Australians.[568] Putin denied responsibility for the killings.[569]\n\nFollowing Putin's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the invasion was \"unprovoked, unjust and illegal\" and labeled Putin a \"thug.\"[570] New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern denounced Putin as a \"bully.\"[571] Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama tweeted \"Fiji and our fellow Pacific Island Countries have united as nations of peace-loving people to condemn the conflict in Ukraine,\" while the Solomon Islands UN ambassador called the invasion a \"violation of the rule of law.\"[572]\n\nMiddle East and Africa\n\nOn 16 October 2007, Putin visited Iran to participate in the Second Caspian Summit in Tehran,[573][574] where he met with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.[575][576] This was the first visit of a Soviet or Russian leader[577] to Iran since Joseph Stalin's participation in the Tehran Conference in 1943, and marked a significant event in Iran–Russia relations.[578] At a press conference after the summit Putin said that \"all our (Caspian) states have the right to develop their peaceful nuclear programmes without any restrictions.\"[579]\n\nPutin was quoted as describing Iran as a \"partner,\"[514] though he expressed concerns over the Iranian nuclear programme.[514]\n\nIn April 2008, Putin became the first Russian president to visit Libya.[580] Putin condemned the 2011 foreign military intervention in Libya, referring to the UN resolution as \"defective and flawed,\" and added \"It allows everything.
