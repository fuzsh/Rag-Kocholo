        "text": "A decade after flight MH17 was shot down, 101 East investigates alleged connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNATO allies accuse China of being a ‘decisive enabler’ of Russia’s war on Ukraine at their Washington, DC, summit.\n\nMoscow court accused Navalnaya of participating in an ‘extremist’ group and she faces two months in jail if she returns.\n\nUS intelligence assessments found Russia tried to influence campaigns to help Trump win in 2016, and 2020 against Biden.\n\nRussia and India have a long history of collaborating on defence. What weapons have they traded before?\n\nThe killing of children is ‘unbearable’, Modi says, a day after a deadly strike on a children’s hospital in Ukraine.\n\nThe duo founded central Asian security summit as counterpoint to Western might.\n\nTwo leaders signed mutual defence pact during Putin’s high-profile visit to North Korea, his first in 24 years.\n\nAt least two people jumped to their deaths after a fire engulfed a former research facility outside Moscow.\n\nPolicemen and civilians were killed in a series of ‘terrorist attacks’ in Dagestan’s Makhachkala and Derbent.\n\nHis comments come after South Korea says will consider supplying arms to Ukraine after Russia and North Korea sign deal.\n\nRussian president says strengthening strategic partnership with Vietnam is one of his country’s priorities."
