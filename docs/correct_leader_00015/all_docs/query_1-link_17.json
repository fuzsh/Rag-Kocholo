        "text": "Exactly one month after the suspicious death of Alexei Navalny, a prominent critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, in a penal colony, the country gears up for its presidential election. Four candidates are in the race, and voting will happen Friday to Sunday. Putin, 71, is expected to claim his fifth tenure.\n\nBacked by state-run media and an intensified crackdown on free speech and public dissent, Putin’s approval rating inside Russia has reached 80% ahead of the vote, according to the Levada Center, a Russian nongovernmental polling and sociological research organization.\n\nIt is not clear, however, how popular the president really is, considering that citizens are afraid of opposing the regime. Research has shown that pressure to conform helps account for Putin’s large approval increase after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and the same happened after the invasion of the rest of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nWho is running against Vladimir Putin?\n\nRussia’s registration of candidates closed on Feb 10, with Putin and three other candidates approved for the ballot. All the candidates support the war in Ukraine, and the most outspoken anti-war candidate, Boris Nadezhdin, was barred from running because of “flaws in the collection of signatures,” according to the Russian Central Election Commission.\n\nCan't see our graphics? Click here to reload the page.\n\nHow does this election echo abroad?\n\nYulia Navalnaya, the widow of Navalny, has accused Putin of having her husband murdered and called on the European Union to refuse to recognize the results of the vote, saying that “a president who assassinated his main political opponent cannot be legitimate by definition.\"\n\nWestern leaders, including President Joe Biden, also have blamed Putin for Navalny's death and warned of consequences. They have provided no evidence.\n\nFor the first time, elections also will take place in what Russia calls its new territories − parts of Ukraine now controlled by Russian forces. Baltic NATO countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania criticize that in a joint statement, calling Russia’s plan to hold elections in \"temporarily occupied and illegally annexed\" Ukrainian territory \"a grave violation of international law, the UN Charter, and Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.\"\n\nHow do presidential elections work in Russia?\n\nThe president is elected by a popular vote in a two-round system every six years. The original 1993 Russian Constitution specified a four-year term, but in 2008, Dmitry Medvedev, who was president between Putin’s tenures from 2008 to 2012, passed an amendment extending the term by two years.\n\nIf no one wins an absolute majority in the first election, a second round is held between the two leading contenders, and the winner is required to win more than 50% of the vote. Elected presidents have a two-term limit.\n\nSo why can Putin run again?\n\nThe 2008 Medvedev amendment wasn’t the only constitutional change. A constitutional referendum in 2020 effectively allowed Putin to run for a further two six-year terms after 2024 by removing “in a row” from the article regulating presidential term limits. That discounted his previous and current terms and made it possible for Putin to theoretically remain in the Kremlin until 2036 instead of having to step down this year.\n\nThe amendment also placed the Russian Constitution above international law.\n\nHow long has Putin been president of Russia?\n\nAfter working as a KGB agent in Dresden, East Germany, from 1985 to 1990, Putin returned to Russia and switched careers, working in administration in St. Petersburg and later Moscow. In 1999, he was appointed prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin.\n\nWhen Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, Putin was handed the presidency on the last day of 1999 and has since been leader of the Russian Federation for longer than any other ruler since Josef Stalin, besting even Leonid Brezhnev’s 1964-1982 tenure.\n\nAre elections in Russia free?\n\nAccording to Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) election observers, the last presidential election in Russia in 2018 was well-administered but restricted in terms of fundamental freedoms and lack of competition.\n\nThe OSCE report stated that “while candidates could generally campaign freely, the extensive and uncritical coverage of the incumbent president in most media resulted in an uneven playing field,” and it added that media owned or supported by the state remains the dominant source of political information in Russia.\n\nApart from benefiting from preferential media treatment, Putin’s 2018 reelection campaign also benefited from procedural irregularities during the vote count and the disqualification of his most influential rival, Navalny, according to Freedom House, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization that rates democracies across the world. Navalny was not allowed to run for office because of a politically motivated criminal conviction. Other prominent critics who could challenge Putin on the ballot are either in jail or living abroad.\n\nAfter the crackdown on free speech in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, most independent media organizations have been banned, many Russian journalists are in exile, and foreign correspondents have either been expelled or jailed, including The Wall Street Journal’s Evan Gershkovich.\n\nPrevious election results\n\nWhat is the political system in Russia?\n\nThe 1993 Constitution established a semi-presidential system for the Russian Federation."
