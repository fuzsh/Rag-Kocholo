        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nToday, in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin declared his intention to advance deeper into Ukraine and issued new threats against the West, one day after he secured his fifth term in office.\n\nIt was an election with no suspense, the outcome of which was preordained.\n\nHere now is Nick Schifrin.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nPutin's nearly 88 percent of the vote and record 77 percent turnout made this a Potemkin plebiscite, especially since at least one city offered voters a chance to win expensive Western electronics and another offered motorcycles and even apartments.\n\nAnd Putin has launched the harshest crackdown on dissent since the Soviet Union. Putin critics say the country has moved from authoritarian to a dictatorship. But some Russian voters, especially those old enough to remember the chaos of the 1990s, say Putin symbolizes a successful effort to make Russia great again.\n\nIrina Ivshina, Resident of Vladivostok, Russia (through translator): I am interested in what is being done now. And I would like it to be continued and even improved, because the younger generation must live in peace and harmony.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nPutin's critics call that propaganda and voted with gasoline and a match, including one woman who lit her own ballot after writing: \"Bring my husband back.\" Those who believe the ballot was already spoiled an entire box.\n\nAnd others wrote in one name, Navalny. Alexei Navalny, the country's leading opposition figure before he died in mysterious circumstances in prison, had called for Russians to protest by all voting at the same time. And they showed up for Noon Against Putin, as seen on this video posted by Navalny's team, strength through numbers.\n\nThat included expats in Berlin, where Navalny's widow, Yulia, who'd echoed her husband's protest call, waited for six hours to vote. For Putin, Navalny had been he who must not be named until today, when he said he was willing to include Navalny in a prisoner swap.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nBut there is nothing moderate about Putin, who gets another turn to continue the policies that define his Russia, a nation at war with freedom and its citizens.\n\nJoining me now is Fiona Hill. She was the senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council staff during the Trump administration. She's now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of \"Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin.\"\n\nAnd Evgenia Kara-Murza is advocacy director at the Free Russia Foundation, which seeks to promote a free, democratic and peaceful Russia. Her husband, Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza, is a political prisoner in Russia.\n\nThanks very much to both of you. Welcome back to the \"NewsHour.\"\n\nEvgenia Kara-Murza, let me start with you.\n\nWhat's your assessment of how the election went, as well as the calls for protest, the Noon Against Putin that we saw people in some parts of Russia, but also across the world?\n\nEvgenia Kara-Murza, Advocacy Director, Free Russia Foundation:\n\nWell, first of all, thank you for the invitation.\n\nAnd as to the election, so-called election, I don't think that this process that took part in Russia over three days can be called an election, because it has nothing to do with a democratic protest that is called election in any normal democratic country.\n\nThis was Vladimir Putin reappointing himself yet again for the fifth time, as the president of the Russian Federation, in violation of many international laws, and having completely destroyed the Russian Constitution through the so-called referendum in 2020, which basically made him into its czar forever.\n\nSo, this process, I don't believe that it can be considered and accepted as a legitimate process by the international community. And I definitely call on the international community to call Vladimir Putin for who he is. He is a dictator and a usurper, and a criminal, actually, wanted by the ICC, definitely not a legitimate leader of the Russian Federation.\n\nFiona Hill, Former National Security Council Official:\n\nWell, it's definitely a re-anointment, because it's not just being a dictator, but, as Evgenia has said, he's almost a self-styled czar at this point.\n\nAnd, in fact, these are the people that he associates himself with in Russian history. In terms of his legacy now, we're all talking about how he will be — been in office longer than Catherine the Great, certainly any of the other previous czars. And if he, in fact, extends his term again beyond this current six-year, after 2030, after 2036, he will have been in power longer than Stalin.\n\nSo I think that those legacies, even those terms, tell you enough.\n\nEvgenia Kara-Murza:\n\nWell, to create this image of universal support of the Russian population of Vladimir Putin and his policies, both domestic policies and the aggression against Ukraine, because a lot — this regime depends a lot on this image, on this very warped image of reality.\n\nAnd this is why the call for the Noon Against Putin, because this was the only way the Russian population was able to show how many Russians were actually opposing these policies, because there are no free and fair elections. We understand that, whatever we put on those ballots will be counted differently.\n\nAnd, of course, there was no surprise in Vladimir Putin's winning, maybe in a little bit in the fact that he gave himself over 87 percent of the vote, which is — I mean, he could be slightly more modest. But, no, he had to go that high. And these results were called unprecedented and record by the Russian authorities.\n\nSo the only way for Russians to actually show what they think of it was to come at the same time, at noon, to polling stations and see how many of us there are actually in reality.\n\nFiona Hill:\n\nLook, I think it was symbolically very important.\n\nWe will have to see how we judge success over time. But the very fact that there was signaling that people were dissatisfied, in the only way that they could, given the repressive constraints on them, is very important, because there were certainly hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nWe saw hundreds of thousands of people turning out for Alexei Navalny's funeral, and not just on the day of the funeral, but on the days afterwards.\n\nFiona Hill:\n\nBut all of this is very important, because the people who have the courage to do these small acts of defiance are also standing in for, let's just say, all of the other people behind them who just don't have either the wherewithal or are too frightened in fact to show their dissatisfaction.\n\nSo I think we can say from this that it isn't a monolith that Putin is presiding over. And it's 87 percent of what?\n\nFiona Hill:\n\nWell, it's certainly going to give him confidence. And I think we're going to see him use that externally as well. It's the second-year anniversary, or just there afterwards, of the full-on invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAnd Ukraine itself was also supposed to have an election coming up. So I would just predict right now that Putin will use the very fact that he's been re-anointed as the czar from here to eternity, at least his eternity perhaps, to make the case that other elections are not being done in the same way, that there's a lack of legitimacy in Ukraine.\n\nEvgenia Kara-Murza:\n\nThis is the alternative, and Vladimir Putin is doing everything to completely annihilate this alternative, so that the world is left to deal with him alone.\n\nAnd this is why I believe it would be so important right now for the international community to do everything to show support and solidarity with those Russians who represent a vision for a different Russia, for Russia, democratic Russia, a normal country, a European country that understands and respects the freedoms and rights of its own citizens and lives in peace with its neighbors.\n\nI just understand that, for as long as Vladimir Putin remains in the Kremlin, there will be warmongering and there will be repression. And those two things in Russia have always been interconnected. Internal repression always leads to external aggression. And this will go on and on for as long as this regime is allowed to survive.\n\nFiona Hill:\n\nWell, that is an issue for us to contend with.\n\nAnd I think it's actually a difficult one. We have to be honest about it. And it's something that we have to keep working on as well. And I think part of the problem that we always face, again, is questions about our own electoral system, which we're right in the middle of right now, also showing insufficient, I would say, dedication and resilience when it comes to dealing with foreign policy.\n\nAnd the key for thinking about the answer to this question is how we basically conduct ourselves at this particular point. Now, by we, I mean the United States.\n\nFiona Hill:\n\nThat's right, and also strengthen its relationship with its allies and partners.\n\nAnd that's not just with European countries. It's also with countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand. There are a whole host of countries, including countries like India, that have somewhat ambiguous relationships with Russia, that we need to keep reaching out to and trying to kind of push back against the threat that Vladimir Putin poses, not just to — domestically in Russia or to Ukraine, but to the larger world system that many other countries have benefited from.\n\nSo that's the challenge for us. And Putin's thrown that challenge down. I don't think we should give up hope, because I do think that that signaling from inside of Russia that Evgenia has talked about shows that it isn't a monolith inside of Russia and there are vulnerabilities. And, actually, he is quite isolated domestically, right?\n\nI don't think he even knows himself quite how much support he has. But people around him will know how many ballots they stuffed. They will know how many people they bussed out or forced to vote. And, eventually, if he shows any kind of weakness internally, there might be another reaction.\n\nWe have already seen that with Prigozhin and that episode several months ago. And we have seen it with the outpouring of emotion and support for Alexei Navalny.\n\nEvgenia Kara-Murza:\n\nHe's doing as well as he can.\n\nHe's — he still sounds — well, sounds. I haven't talked to him since last summer. But, in his letters, he is optimistic, and he sends us words of support. But that's what Russian political prisoners do, amazingly. They are the ones mistreated. They are the ones denied medical care. They are the ones in solitary confinement.\n\nAnd they say about Russia — about the hope for a different Russia, and about that hope living on even after the murder of Alexei Navalny. They say that Vladimir was able to address us during a recent court hearing. And it happened right after Alexei's murder. And he said that, of course, he was absolutely devastated by what had happened, and this was not the first political assassination in Russia's history.\n\nBut he also said that we cannot give in to despair, because this is exactly what they want us to do. And we need to fight even more. And this is what we owe to our fallen comrades, to continue the fight to make sure that Russia does become what they fought for and died for, a normal, European, free, democratic country.\n\nSo, Vladimir sitting in this solitary punishment cell in Western Siberia sends us words of support and encouragement."
