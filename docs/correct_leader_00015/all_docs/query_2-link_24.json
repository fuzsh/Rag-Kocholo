        "text": "As predictions go, a Putin landslide was the easy one.\n\nNo crystal ball or tea leaves required there.\n\nAfter all, in Russia the Kremlin tightly controls the political system, including elections.\n\nBut what will Vladimir Putin do with his 87%? What will a fifth Putin term look like?\n\nPutin 5.0 may not be so different from Putin 4.0\n\nDon't expect an \"Abracadabra moment\" where, with a wave of a magic wand, the hawk suddenly turns into a dove.\n\nChances are that President Putin will continue along his current path of conflict abroad and crackdown at home.\n\nLooking ahead, that probably means a continuation of the war in Ukraine - and confrontation with the West - plus an ideological campaign on the domestic front as Putin pushes on with his transformation of Russia into an increasingly militaristic society.\n\nAs for Russian civil society, that's already under intense pressure. That may well intensify.\n\nThat 87% is an astronomical figure.\n\nTrue, it won't convince Western leaders that it is a genuine reflection of Putin's current level of popularity.\n\n\"This is not what free and fair elections look like,\" commented British Foreign Secretary David Cameron about Russia's presidential vote.\n\nBut domestically, it allows the Kremlin to argue that the whole nation has united around Vladimir Putin and that the Russian president has the full support of his people.\n\nCrucially, he can now claim to have a popular mandate for his war in Ukraine and for the direction in which he's leading Russia.\n\nWatch Live: Putin Claims Russian Election Landslide\n\nVladimir Putin claims a landslide election victory, but faced no credible opposition.\n\nWatch Live now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)\n\nThe 87% also sends a clear message to Russia's political elite: \"Take note, there's still only one man in charge here, in control - and that's not going to change any time soon.\"\n\nAnd that's important for Vladimir Putin, less than a year after the brief, but dramatic mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group. That uprising, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, had posed a direct challenge to Putin's authority.\n\nIn the end, it was the Kremlin leader who came out on top. Two months after the mutiny, Prigozhin was dead, killed in a plane crash.\n\nOne more thing about 87% - it's a great confidence booster. When you're president, and you're told you've won yet another landslide, it can make you feel even more powerful, invincible even.\n\nIn Putin's victory news conference on Sunday night, that confidence shone through.\n\nIt was the confidence of a leader who's already been in power for a quarter of a century and is set to become the longest-serving Russian leader since Catherine the Great.\n\nThe confidence of a leader who has constructed a political system which delivered him 87% of the vote and a fifth presidential term."
