        "text": "Vladimir Putin has been in power since 2000, longer than any Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.\n\nNow into his fifth term as president, aged 71, all semblance of opposition to his rule is gone and there is little to stop him staying on, if he wants, until 2036.\n\nAnd yet, it was almost by accident that this little-known, former KGB man was hand-picked for the Kremlin. A case of being in the right place at the right time in predecessor Boris Yeltsin's inner circle.\n\nVladimir Putin was a street-fighting boy whose early years were spent in a communal flat, or kommunalka, in communist Leningrad.\n\nAlthough he appeared to embrace liberal, democratic Russia, he later described the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union as \"the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the [20th] Century\".\n\nDetermined to prevent Ukraine from leaving Russia's orbit, he unleashed Europe's biggest war since World War Two, with a full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022.\n\nHe often justifies his actions with an outlandish perception of history and a keen resentment of Nato.\n\nBefore the invasion, and since, he falsely claimed that Ukraine was an artificial state populated by neo-Nazis. And he sought to stop Ukraine getting closer to Nato.\n\nThe Western leader who arguably knew him best was Germany's former chancellor Angela Merkel, who is once reputed to have described him as out of touch with reality and \"in another world\".\n\nThe young Putin got into fights with local boys who were often bigger and stronger. Later, he would look back on that time and describe himself as a \"hooligan\". He took up judo, which he continued as a black belt during his presidency, and the Russian martial art of sambo, and stayed close to his childhood partners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.\n\nIn 2015, he reflected on his early experiences on the streets of what is now St Petersburg: \"Fifty years ago the Leningrad street taught me a rule: if a fight is inevitable, you have to throw the first punch.\"\n\nAfter studying at Leningrad State University, in 1975 he went straight into the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB. It was a natural step for a law graduate, and it suited him perfectly.\n\nFrom the KGB headquarters across the road, he watched as crowds stormed the headquarters of the East German secret police, the Stasi. When a small group approached his building, he warned them off.\n\nBut when he called a Red Army tank unit for protection, he realised Russia was of no help: \"We cannot do anything without orders from Moscow. And Moscow is silent.\"\n\nThe next year, he returned to a political system in free fall. He was given the rank of lieutenant-colonel, but never excelled at the KGB. One of his superiors, Nikolai Leonov, considered him a \"mediocre agent\".\n\nTo this day, he retains a small circle of KGB colleagues from Leningrad as his closest confidants - long-standing allies such as Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia's Security Council.\n\nIt was not because of their \"pretty eyes\" he recruited them, his old judo coach Anatoly Rakhlin once recalled, \"but because he trusts people who've proved themselves\".\n\nThose he trusts, he often enriches. He handed childhood friend Arkady Rotenberg a $3.5bn (Â£2.7bn) contract to build a bridge from Russia to occupied Crimea.\n\nHe is intensely private about his personal life, and divorced his wife Lyudmila in 2013 after 30 years of marriage.\n\nThey had two daughters, widely named as Maria Vorontsova, an academic and businesswoman, and Katerina Tikhonova, head of a research foundation.\n\nAs Yeltsin's presidency faded away, Moscow was hit by a series of deadly but unexplained bombings. Vladimir Putin responded with a full-scale land offensive to recapture the mainly Muslim Russian republic of Chechnya from separatist rebels.\n\nHis popularity soared and on 31 December 1999 he was appointed acting president, winning his first presidential term three months later.\n\nThousands of civilians died in the Chechen campaign and, as he often does, Vladimir Putin used crude language to describe how he would wipe out the rebels \"even in the toilet\".\n\nThe capital Grozny was devastated; Russia's leader had his victory.\n\nFour years later, Chechen rebels took 1,000 hostages, most of them children, at a school in Beslan, North Ossetia. When Russian special forces stormed the building, 330 people died. It later emerged that Russia had intelligence of a planned attack but had failed to act.\n\nThe first years of the Putin presidency were both bloody and turbulent, but the Russian economy was doing well, buoyed by high oil prices.\n\nHe won public support for taking on the billionaire oligarchs who had run rife in Russia in the 1990s. Summoning them to the Kremlin, he said they could keep their money as long as they kept out of politics and backed him.\n\nHe acted fast against those who didn't, such as Russia's then-wealthiest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was arrested at gunpoint and jailed in Siberia.\n\nRussia's president had something of a honeymoon with the West. He was one of the first foreign leaders to ring President George W Bush after the 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks on the US. He even helped the US launch its ensuing campaign in Afghanistan.\n\n\"I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy,\" said President Bush.\n\nBut Vladimir Putin soon became disillusioned with the US and its allies. Relations with the UK soured when a former KGB agent and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London using radioactive polonium-210. A UK inquiry found later that the Russian leader had \"probably approved\" the KGB attack.\n\nOn a visit to the Munich Security Conference in 2007, Putin made his feelings towards the US clear.\n\nIn 2011, the biggest mass protests since the collapse of the Soviet Union erupted in Russia's major cities in response to widespread allegations of fraud in parliamentary elections.\n\nAmong the protest leaders was Boris Nemtsov, a liberal, former deputy prime minister in the 1990s. Another rising figure was anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, who labelled Mr Putin's United Russia \"the party of crooks and thieves\".\n\nNow, genuine opposition has all but vanished.\n\nNemtsov was shot dead on a bridge, in view of the Kremlin, in 2015. Navalny survived a nerve agent poison attack in 2020, before he was thrown in jail in January 2021 and died three years later. His widow has accused Vladimir Putin of murder.\n\nPutin has secured the support of the Orthodox Church and he has built a National Guard, or Rosgvardiya, that reports direct to him.\n\nActs of public defiance are few and far between, and newly created offences targeting those who discredit the military and disseminate fake news are widely used to silence dissent.\n\nRussia's media is largely pliant and controlled by the Kremlin, which has become consumed by an all-out war in Ukraine.\n\nThe night that Ukraine's pro-Moscow leader fled violent protests in Kyiv and was effectively ousted, the Russian president said he held an all-night meeting and told his colleagues it was time to \"bring Crimea back into Russia\".\n\nPro-Russian agitators then seized swathes of Ukraine's Donbas region and war took hold in the east for eight years - until Putin decided he would invade from the north, south and east in a bid to overthrow Ukraine's elected government and seize Kyiv, with the invasion in 2022 .\n\nHe has repeatedly sought to justify the war. He writes long historical essays, gives speeches and lectures the few foreign visitors that come. But it is a distorted, selective history that brooks no dissent.\n\nCivil rights group Memorial, which has devoted decades to remembering the victims of Soviet repression, has been banned.\n\nIts veteran co-president Oleg Orlov was jailed for this description of the Putin era: \"They wanted fascism, and they got it.\""
