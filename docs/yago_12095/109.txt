Sweet Land: Regional filmmaking at its best, Ali Selim's love story is about a German mail-order bride (Elizabeth Reaser) who has trouble assimilating into a southern Minnesota farming community after World War I. Selim transports us to a time when love, like that year's crop, took time to germinate.

Released this week: After the Wedding, The Astronaut Farmer, The Last Mimzy, Sweet Land.
