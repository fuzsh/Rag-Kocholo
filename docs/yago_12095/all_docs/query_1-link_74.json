        "text": "Seasoned actor Gil Bellows is a well respected television and film veteran. Honing his craft for over twenty years, the Vancouver native has starred in countless films and television series including, Love in a .45, Shawshank Redemption, Ally McBeal, Law and Order, 24, The Weather Man and Unthinkable. He’s got several projects in the works but a few years ago Bellows decided it was time to try his hand at directing, so he and his good friend and fellow actor Tony Pantages wrote a script which they decided to co-direct, resulting in the dark comedy crime thriller, Days in Havana. Bellows also stars as Jack, a man on a business trip to the Cuban capital who gets more than he bargained for thanks to a few “interesting” locals and some not-so-helpful tips from strangers. As he finds himself wrapped up in an assassination plot, kidnapping, and more, Jack starts to think that his three days in Havana won’t end quickly enough. Talking to Bellows during a promotional stop in Toronto he told me that after having acted for so many years, he’s often thought about directing but it wasn’t something that has always been on his radar. “I’ve always been interested in producing but directing was something I was curious about. Collaborating on this film (with co-director and friend) Tony Pantages made the process a little easier and more palatable for a first try. I have to say that directing is very humbling.” He continues, “one thing you become painfully aware of when you’re directing is that you understand what the goal is, and the goal is perfection and you’re never going to achieve that goal. You are the steward for everyone, you’re the parent and ultimately the film is your child so there’s a different kind of ownership that goes along with that.” Although collaborating with Tony Pantages, his long time friend of over 25 years had it’s advantages, Gil can’t say that every day they worked together was a bed of roses. “There are going to be moments where you are going to push each other in ways that aren’t neccessarily positive. Like in a marriage or any long friendship there are things about the other person that you understand but you don’t enjoy yet you figure out a way to accept and get past it. Yeah, there were moments for sure he wanted to kill me and for sure I wanted him dead, but for the most part it worked out very well. I couldn’t be happier with the result.”The film also stars a who’s who of familiar faces which includes Don McKellar, Robin Dunne, Moneca Delain, John Cassini, Philida Law and Greg Wise all good friends of Bellows who literally jumped on board as soon as they got the call. “We were so lucky to have these people on board and getting someone like the great Phillida Law was extraordinary. She’s sharp as a tack and her scene is actually one of my favorites in the movie.” Shooting in Havana was a dream come true and Bellows and his team could not believe how beautiful and accessible it was for them to film there and being Canadian helped that along. As for those Cuban cigars Gil admits he was never a cigar smoker before making the film but he now knows the secret as to why so many people enjoy a good Cuban cigar. “First of all it’s the leisure element of it. If you were to smoke a cigarette it only takes 2 to 3 minutes, but when you have a cigar it takes a good hour or so of smoking something and it’s a way of saying we’re going to sit here and be together for a while.” Also a gifted producer, Bellows has been involved in several projects but working on the acclaimed, award winning HBO movie Temple Grandin ranks right up there as one of his best professional experiences, “That was an amazing project and opportunity. I will never forget working on Temple Grandin and more importantly, how many people it touched in so many different ways.” Bellows is confident that he will direct again infact he’d like to see another 10 projects in his future but for now he’s got a pretty full roster in front of the camera. Up next he has a number of films coming out including a few he is really excited for people to see. “I just shot a film, Kill the Messenger with Jeremy Renner which I think is going to be big. I have one coming up, The Calling with Susan Sarandon, Donald Sutherland and Ellen Burstyn. Plus we are going to see him in an episode the upcoming Season 14 of CSI,that will introduce characters for its planned spin-off. In the episode, Bellows will play Mr. Berman, a wealthy and powerful casino mogul with many secrets. He becomes the prime suspect when his wife is murdered.\n\n3 Days in Havana is now playing in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. It opens in Ottawa and Calgary on April 4th.\n\nClick here to listen to my entire interview interview with Gil Bellows about, 3 Days in Havana and more.\n\nA bit about Gil Bellows… Gil Bellows is an Emmy & Peabody winning and Golden Globe nominated producer for the HBO film, “Temple Grandin”.
