        "text": "The &ldquo;alarmist&rdquo; media coverage in relation to the Irish link to the London terror attack last Saturday &ldquo;bears no relation&rdquo; to the jihadi threat level to Ireland, according to a terrorism expert.\n\nThese are the faces of two of the three terrorists who carried out the London Bridge attacks &mdash; one of whom had lived in Ireland.\n\nMuslim, Quaker, and Christian groups have called for a &ldquo;conscience clause&rdquo; to be included in the marriage equality referendum which would allow people to ignore gay marriage rights in certain circumstances.\n\nMuslim leaders in Ireland are calling on the media here not to publish images of the new issue of Charlie Hebdo which goes on sale today.\n\nNewsagents have said they &ldquo;cannot act as a censor of what people want to access&rdquo; after it emerged the current edition of Charlie Hebdo, containing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, will be on sale in Ireland.\n\nT&aacute;naiste Joan Burton and a leading Islamic cleric are at odds over whether the Irish media has the right to show controversial cartoons featuring the prophet Muhammad in the wake of the Paris massacre.\n\nGarda&iacute; are aware of an estimated 30 Irish people who have gone to fight in war zones in Syria and Iraq, with the potential that some may pose a terrorist threat.\n\nIt is nearly 17 years since terrorist zealots as evil &mdash; and as utterly wrong &mdash; as those who brought carnage to the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris on Wednesday inflicted an atrocity of similar scale, impact and immorality on the people of Omagh.\n\nIt is sad to think that Dr. Ali Selim&rsquo;s attempt to stifle free speech - through threat of legal action against any Irish publication that reprints Charlie Hebdo&rsquo;s front page depiction of the Prophet Muhammad &ndash; can currently be supported by our nation&rsquo;s laws.&nbsp;\n\n&quot;I remember her as a little child in my garden, she played together with my kids. And this is what was ahead. It&rsquo;s heartbreaking.&quot;\n\nTwo predictable events suggested this week that by choosing not to acknowledge that this society has changed utterly, we seem set on ensuring that an avoidable and destructive conflict becomes an inevitable one. Both events focussed on the place of religion in education and highlighted deeply-held but conflicting beliefs around this issue. Both events highlighted the complexity involved and suggested that as society becomes more diverse, this problem will become even more fraught.\n\nA leading Muslim cleric has dismissed fears that armed groups are trying to recruit children from Ireland for fighting units abroad after a Co Meath schoolboy was killed on active duty in Syria.\n\nTHE country’s largest Islamic organisation has rejected reports that an Irish Muslim named in a British intelligence dossier on Libyan extremists is a “leading figure” in the community here."
