And today, \"America House\" still stands proudly in commemoration of this patriotic verse. Thus, it is especially appropriate to use this song for the celebration of Andover's 350th anniversary.\n\nSweet Land takes the original melody and elaborates it within a 20th-century American musical language. This work might be described as a contemporary excursion based on a historical source. Elements of folk, jazz, blues and rock styles can be heard throughout.\n\nThe formal structure is a theme and four variations -- Theme (stately), Variation I (lively), Variation II (in a 'blues' style), Variation III ('furtively') and Variation IV (triumphantly). And although the theme is transformed to the limits of recognition in the 'blues' section, it reappears more noticeably in the 'furtive' motives and asserts itself forcefully at the end.\n\nThe intention in creating Sweet Land was to bring renewed energy and affection to a song which has endured for centuries as part of our American heritage.\n\nNotes by the composer"
