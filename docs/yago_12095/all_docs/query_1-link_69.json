I apologize thousands of times for such a delay in writing to you. I would really not want you to be upset about this.READ MORE\n\nSeptember 6, 2019\n\nA Drop of Ink, A Drop of Persian Culture\n\nOne thing I enjoy about TypeCon, the annual conference hosted by the Society of Typographic Aficionados (SOTA), an international organization dedicated to the promotion, study, and support of typography and related arts, is the opportunity to take workshops. Workshops provide an intense, hands-on way to learn something new from experts; this year’s workshops included an intro to Chinese calligraphy, a wood type printing primer, instruction on the construction of brush majuscules, an introduction to Hangul (Korean) type, reduction block printing, hot glass experiments (attendees got to make a neon letter!), and a day trip to the Hill Manuscript Museum in St. Cloud.READ MORE\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nQ & A with Mamta Chaudhry, author of Haunting Paris\n\nWhen an author writes a book proposal, they often invent profiles of prospective readers; the purpose is to help a publisher envision what type of reader might buy that book. When I first heard about Mamta Chaudhry’s forthcoming novel, HAUNTING PARIS, it felt as if my picture should have been used in her book proposal. The book checks off just about every topic I could ask for: Paris? Check. An old, handwritten letter? Check. WWII? Check! A compelling history-mystery? CHECK!\n\nREAD MORE\n\nMay 20, 2019\n\nBook Marketing: What Worked (So Far)\n\nLast week I had a conversation with a friend whose book, Crackerjack Bands and Hometown Boosters: The Story of a Minnesota Music Man, is coming out in July. She’s at the point in the process where the writing is done, the book is in production, and she’s facing the daunting next step: launching her book.READ MORE\n\nMay 14, 2019\n\nMay 14/15, 1942: “…my greatest ambition is to get home to you…”\n\nLetter 52\n\nWednesday, 13th May, 1942\n\n1887416 Sgt. Leigh AA, RE\n\nTransportation\n\nHeadquarters\n\nSudan\n\nMy Darling Sweetheart,\n\nHow long it is since I last wrote you. I don’t know but it is longer than it should have been. I am extremely sorry to keep you of all people waiting but I am sure you must know and realise that I have an excellent reason, so please forgive me darling. I must confess that I have been frightfully busy and working hard in the intense heat produces a tiredness which hinders all attempts to write but the smallest of letters. Since my precious you are worth far more to me than a few scrappy lines I just wait my opportunity. READ MORE\n\nMay 9, 2019\n\nHandwriting Writing Prompt\n\nI found this delightful, mystery-filled handwriting sample on eBay for just a few dollars. I love the loopy handwriting, the flourished initial letters, and the extra-long cross bars on the t’s. Most of all, I love the sternness of the note. I’m dying to know what was so unworthy! The note was written on the front of the envelope; unfortunately the envelope doesn’t include any other clues.\n\nIt struck me as a fantastic writing prompt. What do you think was such a failure and that was so “untrustworthy” that it required courage to send? Do tell!\n\nMay 3, 2019\n\nMay 3, 1944: “These are our best years and they are flying by…”\n\nMay 3, 1944\n\nMy beloved little darling wife,\n\nI am happy tonight because I have mail like a notary clerk—nine letters in two days, not all from you, of course, but still, I have four—from March 23, March 26, April 2 and April 13.
