        "text": "Dr. Julie Sweetland is a sociolinguist and a senior advisor at the FrameWorks Institute.\n\nSince joining FrameWorks in 2012, Dr. Sweetland has designed and led reframing initiatives on climate change, education equity, childhood adversity, and more. Her skill in translating framing research into communication strategy has helped advocates, policymakers, and scientists drive change at the national, state, and grassroots levels. Since 2017, Julie has worked primarily with the public health sector, bringing the science and strategy of framing to health topics like health equity, tobacco control, maternal mortality, and childhood vaccination.\n\nPrior to joining FrameWorks, Julie spent over a decade working in education reform as a classroom teacher, teacher educator, and advocate. At Center for Inspired Teaching, she designed an innovative teacher residency which has since trained hundreds of progressive educators who work throughout DC public schools.\n\nJulieâ€™s linguistic research has focused on the intersection of language and race, with a particular focus on how language can be used to disrupt racism in schools and beyond. Her research has appeared in Journal of Sociolinguistics, Educational Researcher, and she is the co-author of African American, Creole, and Other Vernacular Englishes in Education.\n\nDr. Sweetland is a graduate of Georgetown University and completed her MA and PhD in linguistics at Stanford University."
