        "text": "Hours after the release of the finale, director and executive producer Ali Selim spoke to Insider about Emilia Clarke leaning into the physicality of G'iah and Gravik's (Kingsley Ben-Adir) big fight, Olivia Colman subverting expectations as Sonya Falsworth, and how long that Skrull has been masquerading as Rhodey (Don Cheadle).\n\nHow are you feeling now that the whole show is finally out and you can talk about it entirely freely?\n\nOh, it's a really good question, but my feeling doesn't much change before or after. I feel like my work is done and I don't ever need to talk about it because it's all there on the screen, but I understand your question has to do more with this interview than with my friends across the street.\n\nSo, I guess the feeling is freeing and we can talk about everything now and I don't have to hide behind the Fifth Amendment.\n\nFor you, coming from a background of directing various different kinds of projects, what were the biggest challenges or adjustments that you made going into a Marvel project?\n\nI think one has to familiarize themselves with the MCU and be very knowledgeable about what came from where and who is connected to who.\n\nBut once I've done that, I feel like it's simply telling a story in the best way I can. And I don't change much because I think my job is to tell the story and not worry about external forces that might inform the story or not inform the story.\n\nSo in a way, it's very simple. You familiarize yourself, you familiarize yourself with the scripts and the characters, and then you simply tell the story. So, I think my job was particularly interesting and challenging in the MCU in that really you have to shepherd the brand, which is an incredibly powerful and beloved brand. You have to shepherd it, you have to honor it, and yet you have to keep the audience surprised.\n\nThat's what I can bring to it, is not to be so anchored in the MCU, but to sort of move it forward.\n\nWhat kind of knowledge or expertise did Samuel L. Jackson bring to this? Because this is a character that he's played for over a decade now, and he's an executive producer as well. So was there anything in particular that he contributed to this?\n\nHe contributes a tremendous amount. Not only does he know so much about acting and has such great experience acting with some of the great actors and some of the great directors, but he also is a great collaborator. And he comes in with a sense of, \"I know what's going on and let's explore what's going on.\"\n\nAnd he also, I think, was particularly interested in exploring how the Nick Fury in the story related to his own life, his own sense of other, his own sense of aging, and his own sense of constantly redefining himself. And that's kind of what Nick was doing.\n\nSo in some ways, Sam is a great collaborator and in some ways, Sam is Nick Fury, and we just have to rely on him.\n\nLet's get into the specifics of the finale. It's strongly suggested that a Skrull has been posing as Rhodey since \"Captain America: Civil War.\" That's what fans have interpreted from that one scene. So can you definitively clear that up and share how long a Skrull has been posing as Rhodey?\n\nI think that it's gonna be a lot of fun for fans to unpack as they revisit all the Rhodey moments since the \"Captain America\" moment when he was in the hospital, and to see how they feel about it.\n\nI don't know if I wanna say it's definitive or not definitive, but I think Rhodey has been a Skrull a lot longer than we suspected.\n\nBut do you personally have the answer to that question and you're guarding it?\n\nOh, interesting. No. I think that's a question for the MCU at large, probably for Kevin Feige himself.\n\nWhat was presented to me was a lot of fun, and I think we made a lot of fun out of it. But for those definitive answers, I defer to Kevin Feige or I defer to the fans.\n\nIn the finale, there's a fight scene between G'iah and Gravik, a Super Skrull face-off. So what was it like to film that sequence? I have to imagine there's a lot of CGI and effects involved in that.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe most fun for me is that, actors like Emilia Clarke, who is amazing at what she does, I can witness what she does and I'm completely mystified by what she does.\n\nI think scenes like this are a little bit of a reprieve for her after putting so much of herself out on the screen in the quiet little scenes. Now she gets to just do fun shit. She gets to hang from ropes and swing through the air and throw punches at people.\n\nThere's a lot of detail that goes into those scenes. They're storyboarded for months on end. We follow the storyboards in great detail, but then there's just a lot of fun because it's a release moment for actors.\n\nAnd you're right, a sequence like that comes together with hundreds of hours of stunt people and second unit people, and visual effects people. It couldn't happen without any of them. And so it's a lot to coordinate on my end to keep all those departments moving in the same direction.\n\nBut ultimately your question is, what was it like to shoot that sequence? And honestly, it's fun. By the time you come to shooting, as I said, it's storyboarded and the stunts have been rehearsed to the point that they're precise and you really just get the precision of it, you get the details of it, but you have a lot of fun.\n\nAnd then with G'iah killing Gravik, I think it positions her to be one of the most, if not the most powerful, person in the MCU right now. I mean, she has all these powers at her disposal. So beyond this show, how are we gonna see the ripple effects of her new position of power as a Skrull leader and this agreement that she's made with Olivia Colman's character, Sonya?\n\nI promise you, I am not deflecting your question, but once again, I think what happens outside the confines of the walls of these six episodes is really a question for Marvel. I don't know where it's gonna go.\n\nIt would be exciting if it went somewhere because those are two incredible actors and two incredibly strong, interesting women to follow.\n\nAt the same time, I do think that that pact they made, it could be a launching point for their characters and I think it's also a great resolution for this story. So I'm satisfied with it as an ending. And if it continues on in some way, I can't imagine anything better.\n\nI feel like Olivia Colman just seemed like she was having a blast playing this kind of character, or at least I enjoyed it as a viewer. So what do you think that she brought to this role that really made her stand out for people?\n\nI know Olivia a little bit. We've stayed in touch and I can tell you that she has fun no matter what she's doing. She just loves life and seems to have fun across the board.\n\nShe brought a very surprising element to this series because people think of her as a thespian. People think of her as a serious Oscar winner, and here she is torturing Skrulls and cutting their fingers off, and having a blast doing it.\n\nShe brought some sense of subversion, almost. She just tweaked the MCU, where if we had had an actress who was more well versed in things like that, badassery and torture-y and stuff like that, I don't think it would've been as surprising or subversive.\n\nSam Jackson and Emilia Clarke were dying to work with her. So it brought an energy that you don't get when it's just another scene.\n\nAfter watching the finale, some people have been wondering whether or not it was necessary to kill off Maria Hill at the start of the show. From your perspective, how did her death impact Fury's actions across the show and just the progression of the series in a way that really justified such a shocking moment like that?\n\nThat's a really good way to phrase the question because I do think it motivates Fury in a deeply personal way that wouldn't have thrust the story forward had it been more abstract or more distanced from him. Making it personal was really a valuable way to dive into this story.\n\nWhy she's killed is another question for the MCU. I just did the best I could making it feel truthful and emotional, and I am grateful that I have not yet received death threats for killing off Maria Hill.\n\nNow this next question, I know you may have to deflect, but just answer it as best as you can, because I know that this show is a bridge and a precursor to the next \"Captain Marvel\" movie, especially with that last scene showing Fury going off-world yet again. So, what can you share about how the show sets up that movie? Especially because the villain of that movie is a Kree revolutionary.\n\nI'm not gonna deflect, I'm gonna say I can't shine any light on it.\n\nMy participation in that was to make sure that Nick Fury goes up at the end of this series, so I made sure that he went up. And where they capture him in the next, it's entirely up to them.\n\nRelated stories\n\nI really have to focus on what I'm doing in these six episodes, so I'm curious, but I'm actually a little more curious as an audience member than as a filmmaker.\n\nI think this is the first Marvel/Disney+ show that doesn't have a single post-credit scene at all. I know you're the director, but what can you share about that? Was that an intentional move? Was there ever anything considered for a tag scene?\n\nThat's a good question. I think everything that you see on the screen is intentional.\n\nA decision has been made about every coffee mug and every undergarment and everything. Decisions are made all along the way. I don't have an answer. I think Marvel uses those things expertly to launch something new or to conclude something.\n\nI know that this series is a bridge, like you said, but I don't know what it's launching. And as long as the story feels complete, I feel like I did my job. If you wanna write a post-credit sequence, maybe we'll reconsider.\n\nThat's above my pay grade. I'll leave that to the experts. From what other Marvel directors and actors have said, sometimes things in the scripts change at the last minute or the day of filming. What was your experience like for \"Secret Invasion?\" How closely did it follow all the scripts and how much room was there for improvisation or adjustments?\n\nI don't wanna play semantic games, but I think of it as an evolution. As you hunt down story, everything is constantly evolving. And it's a fascinating process.\n\nI guess there are moments of improv, like between Sam and Don, between Sam and Ben. There are really rich moments of improv. There are actors who rely more on the script. And I think as we are editing, we're still finding the story. We were finding the story on episode six up until episode one had already aired.\n\nThat's part of the beauty of it, is that Marvel just keeps hunting it down and using the resources they have to come up with the best story possible, and that quest never ends.\n\nDo you remember any of those improv moments that you mentioned between Sam and Don or Ben? Did any of those make the cut from what you remember?\n\nI think it depends on how we're using the word improv.\n\nThere's a scene on the train where Nick Fury is sitting with Talos and he talks about his past, his experience with his mother riding the train, and the food they brought. And it's not really improv, but Sam wrote that, and Sam wrote it in a way that was deeply personal to him.\n\nSeveral days before, he recounted it and it ended up on the page so that Ben would understand it and wasn't responding to last-minute improv. So that's in there.\n\nBen is a very musical guy and he brings a lot of music to his performance, a sense of rhythm. And to that end, he's always singing. And a lot of times other actors would have to leave the room when he was singing just to let him do his process, but Sam would sing with him and we would end up shooting both sides of the song for the duet.\n\nWe tried to put it in, but with those two guys running around killing people, it didn't make sense that they would take a pause and sing an old Motown hit. [Laughs.]\n\nFrom a directing standpoint, do you have a favorite episode or even a scene that you're most proud of in terms of how it came together?\n\nI'm proud of the whole damn thing, the six hours. I'm proud that I've survived. I'm proud that people are enjoying it. I love the scale and scope of it, the fact that I got to work on cars flipping over and explosions.\n\nBut ultimately for me, it boils down to the emotional truth that's passing between two characters, the electricity passing between two characters. And so Don and Sam in the bar when Rhodey fires Fury, I love that. Olivia Colman and Sam Jackson in the library in episode one. I love that.\n\nSo I'm not gonna come up with the exciting scenes for you, but the scenes that really move me are the ones where it's two people talking and finding a truth. Emilia Clarke and Sam Jackson in episode five talking about Talos' death and where to bury him, I just love those moments.\n\nAnd like I said, then the other stuff becomes more fun, like a relaxing moment to blow shit up and cut people's fingers off.\n\nMarvel fans, I'm sure you know this, they love dissecting these projects and theorizing. Sometimes they're accurate, sometimes theories completely miss the mark. So was there a theory about \"Secret Invasion\" that made you laugh the hardest, impressed you, or just surprised you by how accurate or how off-base it was?\n\nOh, it's a good question. We test the episodes with a diehard insider audience and you hear a lot of interesting comments that come out of those meetings. But then when it's released, I don't spend a lot of time reading what the fans are saying. I know there's a valuable element to that, but it doesn't really help me as a storyteller.\n\nThat said, I really got a kick out of somebody online, who made their own version of the trailer for \"Secret Invasion,\" and they had Julia Louis-Dreyfus in it. And I thought, well, that's fun misdirect. And I'm sure there are still people, some friends of mine, who are waiting for her to show up in episode six, which I'll tell you she's not gonna do.\n\nMaybe that could have been the end credits scene, just her popping up.\n\nMaybe it is the end credits scene. I don't know.\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir is obviously the main villain, but also he is playing a Ken in the \"Barbie\" movie. Did you see \"Barbie\" and his performance? It's so jarring seeing him on \"Secret Invasion\" one week and then seeing him in \"Barbie,\" just hamming it up.\n\nHe's a great shape-shifting — no pun intended or pun intended — actor who I think has done a lot of great work. I loved him in \"The OA,\" I loved him in \"The Comey Rule\" playing Obama. He's really, really brilliant. I think he's got a brilliant career ahead of him.\n\nHe did an incredibly nuanced job playing Gravik. I am excited to see \"Barbie,\" but I devoted my weekend to \"Oppenheimer,\" because as you can tell, that's a little more my mindset, but I'll be at \"Barbie\" very soon.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. \"Secret Invasion\" is now streaming on Disney+."
