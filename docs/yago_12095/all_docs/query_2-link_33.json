        "text": "The process of creating Sweet Land in rehearsals was chaotic, creative, uplifting and tiring. The performers, along with directors Yuval Sharon and Cannupa Hanska Luger and composers Du Yun and Raven Chacon were basically workshopping the piece in rehearsal and creating it from scratch. Blocking and music changed daily in rehearsal, and if you missed one (I think I only had to miss one rehearsal), you came back and had to learn a section over again because of the recent changes. This process could be frustrating at times but was also extremely rewarding because of how deeply involved I felt with the creation of this brand new opera. I really enjoyed being in the room while Yuval and Cannupa went back and forth about what a particular passage of the libretto (written by Aja Couchois Duncan and Douglas Kearney) should really mean and how it should be portrayed in the blocking. I loved seeing Du Yun and Raven frantically rewriting an orchestration or rethinking a vocal passage so that it would fit with the new blocking. I learned so much from being a witness to this process. As far as my roles went, I was lucky enough to be involved in almost every scene in the opera in some way. I was cast as Scribe, a character from the “Train” scenes, and was to split that role with an incredible performer - Peabody Southwell. I was also cast as Rosa, a character only present in the final scene, during which she told the tragic story of her murder through a beautiful aria written by Du Yun. Last, but not least, I was a member of the ensemble in the “Feast” scenes. The original plan was that I’d be switching from “Feast” to “Train” (these are the two tracks in the opera, which occurred in different spaces - the audience split up and got different experiences depending on their track) halfway through the performance schedule. However, our schedule was cut short by COVID 19, and I did not end up getting to perform in the “Train” track as Scribe, even though I prepared and rehearsed the role. This was a bit of a blow for me, but again, after having time to adjust and reflect, I am left without bitterness about this, and only gratitude for the experience I did have performing in the “Feast” track and as Rosa in the final scene in every show. I felt deeply connected to those two characters.\n\nThe second scene was different - I could hardly see due to the white bag over my head. I was no longer hungry, but the greed and entitlement to my character was so strong that I continued to eat, filling my plate whenever it was empty, on repeat. On the table in front of me, just beyond my plate, was the last remaining host, “Makwa”, writhing and gasping and trying to escape her impending marriage to Jimmy Gin.\n\nIn the closing scene, while performing the “Rosa” aria, I was surrounded by three women who really became my sisters by the end of the show. We all had different stories to tell, but the intensity with which we all felt for our characters permeated the room, and we fed off of each other’s performances. During this ending scene, we were separate from the audience, unseen ghosts, singing into microphones with our voices projected out to the audience who sat on bleachers outside, watching the words of our stories projected on billboards and bridges in the background. Each night, I felt that I learned more about my character through the performance. Rosa was an indentured servant who was purchased for a modest price, and eventually brutally murdered by her master, Mrs. Basset, with a broom, and left to rot in a dumpster. Though the story is so extreme that it was hard to find something to relate to, I felt close to Rosa through her fragility and anger that was expressed brilliantly through Du Yun’s writing. I was given permission to do my own thing with the piece vocally, and my performance morphed throughout the run of the show as I grew closer to the character. I still feel sad and angry when I think of the stories of the women depicted in the final scene, especially because I know that there have been many women throughout history who’ve been treated horribly. I’m thankful to have had the opportunity to communicate one of those stories through Sweet Land.\n\nRight before the quarantine began, we were able to spend a day filming all of Sweet Land, so that the opera can live on beyond just our memories and the myriad of great reviews. It’s good that we did, because we were then shut down (just as all other performance projects were in Los Angeles) and are now able to offer a streamed version of the show to those who were planning to come see it in person! It’s a different experience to watch it on a screen rather than in person, of course, but I think the story was communicated beautifully through the film, and that’s what counts. You can stream it here: stream.sweetlandopera.com for just $14.99 and you’ll be able to watch both tracks of the opera. I hope that anyone who reads this takes the time to stream the show, because The Industry needs the support in order to be able to keep creating important and innovative art."
