        "text": "Secret Invasion has all of the weaknesses that the MCU Disney+ shows so far have had, squandering some excellent ideas with a leaden pace, pedestrian directing, and a reliance on lazy reveals. It’s somewhat laughable that the big reveal at the end of this episode is that Nick Fury is married to a Skrull, a reveal that might have had some impact if the series had done anything so far to establish what’s at stake for Fury in this context. Indeed, when Fury gets fired earlier in the episode, it’s frustrating to be reminded that we’ve still never had any clear indication about which organizations even exist in the post-blip universe. What has been his job, anyway, since SHIELD was taken down?\n\n‘Promises’ picks up in the wake of Maria Hill’s death (which feels weirdly anticlimactic, despite Juliet Stevenson turning up with an utterly bizarre accent demanding answers) and gets to reckoning with the aftermath of the explosion in Moscow after a Skrull secret agent claims American responsibility, a claim supported by Fury and Hill’s presence at the scene of the blast. Embittered Skrull dissident Gravik is working to set humans fighting one another, and the episode reveals not only that several high-profile figures (including the British Prime Minister!) are Skrulls in disguise – who in this episode throw their support behind Gravik – but that there are about a million Skrulls on Earth, far in excess of what Fury believed.\n\nSo much has been made of the ‘anyone could be a Skrull, trust no-one’ gimmick of this show, which is definitely cool. But the MCU has completely confused any understanding of what the global order actually is these days. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier painted a picture of a world where borders had collapsed and national allegiances had changed, in ways that caused chaos when half the world’s population returned during the events of Endgame; but Wakanda Forever seemed to suggest a world still effectively the same as it was at the end of Black Panther with Wakanda as the destabilising threat, while the other MCU shows have largely implied life and politics continuing as normal. The fact that we’re introduced to the Skull Council mere seconds after we’ve first heard of the existence of these politicians and news figures doesn’t give a lot of weight to the reveal – does the British Prime Minister even have much power? The implication in separating her out from EU states suggests that Brexit happened in the MCU, which (a) is depressing and (b) is a reminder of just how little world-building the MCU has done post-Phase 3, which bodes ill for a series trying to challenge that world.\n\nStill, the larger stakes aside, there is some good stuff in this episode. Gravik’s plan has momentum, especially as he’s elected the supreme Skull leader and announces that the Skrulls are now on a war-footing. G’iah is still badly defined – Emilia Clarke is doing everything she can with the role, but she spends most of her time moving around silently and inscrutably, a witness to the Skrull plans – but she discovers secret DNA-harvesting plans this week that suggest that Gravik is looking for ways to harvest the powers of superpowered creatures that have come to Earth, including Groot, Cull Obsidian, and the frost monster from Thor: The Dark World, as well as the Iron Man 3 Extremis soldiers. All of this is ramping up the stakes for a new Endgame-level threat on Earth.\n\nMeanwhile, the main players are largely stuck this week with shifting loyalties. Don Cheadle is by far the best thing about the show, getting a good couple of scenes this week in which he snarkily represents America to European leaders (though with zero diplomatic tact), and then faces off with Fury and sacks him. Rhodey has always been the most ambivalent of the Avengers in his specific loyalty to the nation state, and it makes sense that he would be an antagonist for Fury. Fired by Rhodes, and falling out badly with Talos when he discovers that Talos has been lying about the Skrull presence on Earth, Fury himself is on the outs this week. He’s tired, coughing, and washed up – and going home to his secret wife at least seems to give him the opportunity for a restart.\n\nThe other wild card is Olivia Colman’s Sonya Falsworth, who this week gets to interrogate the Skrull secret agent and then escape before Gravik can rescue him. Colman, at least, is a lot of fun, playing up the performed dottiness of the character before gruesomely severing her prisoner’s finger. If nothing else, she’s always great to watch. But the series needs to very quickly stop depending on shocks without substance and twists that don’t actually change what is already a nebulous situation, and instead get on with clarifying its own story."
