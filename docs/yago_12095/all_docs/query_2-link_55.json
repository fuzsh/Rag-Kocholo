STATE HISTORIC PARK HAS A PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT TONGVA VILLAGE YAANGA.\n\nCARMELO: SO YAANGA WAS A PLACE OF INFLUENCE, IT WAS A PLACE OF PROSPERITY, IT WAS A PLACE OF A LOT OF HUSTLE AND BUSTLE JUST AS IT IS TODAY.\n\nTHE SPANISH INVADERS CAME IN, AND THEY SAW THAT IT WAS RIGHT BY THE PAAYME PAXAAYT, WHICH IS THE LOS ANGELES RIVER, AND THEY SAW THAT IT WAS A GOOD PLACE TO BRING THEIR ZANJA MADRE, WHICH IS THE MOTHER DITCH, WHICH WAS LARGELY BUILT WITH INDIGENOUS LABOR, AND THAT WAS THE FIRST MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEM FOR LOS ANGELES.\n\nFURTHER, IT ALSO BECAME ONE OF THE ROUTES OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD, AND THAT BROUGHT IN EVERYBODY FROM ALL DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES AND BEYOND, AND THAT IS WHY WE CURRENTLY HAVE LOS ANGELES AS WE KNOW IT TODAY BUT STARTING WITH THE TONGVA PEOPLE.\n\nSHARON: BECAUSE OF THE NOTION OF THE STORIES THAT WE WERE TELLING, BECAUSE OF THE LAYERS OF HISTORY, IT FELT LIKE THE PERFECT CONVERSATION PARTNER FOR EXACTLY WHAT THE--WHAT THE OPERA NEEDED TO MAKE SURE IT FELT ROOTED AND DID NOT JUST FEEL LIKE WHAT WE WERE DOING WAS GOING TO BE AN ARTISTIC EXERCISE THAT DOESN'T REALLY GRAPPLE WITH THESE ISSUES IN ANY HARD-HITTING.\n\nWAY.\n\nWE DIDN'T WANT TO LET THE AUDIENCE OFF THE HOOK, AND THE MAIN WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO INVITE THEM INTO A DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF THE LAND ITSELF.\n\nCARMELO: IT'S A

ABOUT A SORT OF SELF-MYTHOLOGIZATION.\n\nCHACON: IF WE'RE CONSIDERING THAT THESE EARLY ENCOUNTERS ARE NOT ACCURATELY TOLD, THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS CREATIVE PEOPLE TO MAKE UP NEW MYTHOLOGIES,

COLONIZING COUNTRY THAT HAS ENGAGED IN EITHER SETTLER COLONIALISM OR EXTRACTIVE COLONIALISM ARE TELLING THESE STORIES AND HAVEN'T EVER SHOWN US THE REDACTED STATEMENT OF THE EXPERIENCE.\n\nTHEY EVEN UNDERMINED THEIR OWN SUFFERING IN THESE STORIES, IN THE RETELLING OF A STORIES.\n\nTHEY'VE DEVELOPED A MYTH THAT IS THEIR HISTORY, AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DEVELOP MORE AND MORE MYTH TO STACK ON TOP OF THAT TO CREATE SOMETHING CONTRARY TO OUR--OUR LEARNED EXPERIENCE AND REINFORCE THE IDEA THAT WHAT WE KNOW AS HISTORY IS ILLUSION.\n\n[WOMEN SINGING OVERLAPPING MELODIES] WOMAN: MOST PEOPLE THINK OF OPERA ONE WAY, VERY EUROCENTRIC, VERY AUSTERE, YOU KNOW.\n\nSHARON: I THINK WE HAVE TO FACE IT.\n\nOPERA CAN FEEL LIKE A VERY COLONIALIST ART FORM, ESPECIALLY HERE IN AMERICA.\n\nMOST OF THE WORKS PERFORMED HERE ARE PREDOMINANTLY ITALIAN, GERMAN, AND FRENCH.\n\nI THINK PEOPLE IMAGINE THAT IT IS THIS HIERARCHICAL AND IMPERIAL TYPE ART FORM WHERE IT'S ALL ABOUT A SOLE POINT OF VIEW OR A SOLE VISION, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT TRADITIONAL OPERATIC THEATERS, THEY REINFORCE THAT NOTION BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE HIERARCHICAL BALCONIES WITH--YOU KNOW, WITH PEOPLE KIND OF IN DIFFERENT LEVELS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP, AND THE REALLY THE ONE PRIVILEGED PERSPECTIVE WAS RESERVED FOR THE KING.\n\nYOU KNOW, WHEN YOU CREATE OPERAS THAT WAY, YOU REINFORCE SOCIAL IDEAS, YOU REINFORCE POLITICAL IDEAS, AND YOUR REINFORCE THE IDEA THAT THIS IS HOW THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN SHOULD BE ORGANIZED.\n\nWOMAN: ♪ COME ON ♪ I'M CLASSICALLY TRAINED, AND I FIND THAT A LOT OF THE TRADITIONAL OPERAS ARE OBVIOUSLY EUROCENTRIC.\n\nI REALLY DIDN'T SEE MYSELF DOING LARGE-SCALE OPERAS BECAUSE I THOUGHT, \"OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO SPACE FOR THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOUNDS.\"\n\nWASHINGTON: YES, THERE IS A LOT OF CLASSICAL SINGING, AND, YES, THERE'S A LOT OF CLASSICAL SOUNDS, BUT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.\n\n[SINGING IN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE] HA HA HA!\n\nHOW'S THAT FOR OPERA?\n\nHA HA HA!\n\n[VOCALIZING] SHARON: THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS IN WHICH WE BASICALLY TRIED TO COMPLETELY DECONSTRUCT ANY NOTION OF HIERARCHY WITH THIS.\n\nCERTAINLY, ONE REALLY EASY WAY IS THE FACT THAT THERE'S TWO OF EACH OF US.\n\nYOU KNOW, THERE'S TWO DIRECTORS.\n\nTHERE ARE TWO COMPOSERS, TWO WRITERS, TWO SET DESIGNERS.\n\nTHERE'S THAT SENSE THAT NO ONE PERSON CAN DO THIS BY THEMSELVES, THAT NO ONE PERSON HAS THE PRIVILEGED PERSPECTIVE OF SAYING, \"HISTORY IS THE WAY THAT I SEE IT AND ONLY THE WAY THAT I SEE IT.\"\n\nMAN: WE HAVE 3 INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ON THE ARTISTIC TEAM.\n\nI AM MANDAN, HIDATSA,

DIFFERENT.\n\nWE ALL SPEAK TOTALLY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, OUR CULTURAL PRACTICES ARE DIFFERENT, AND SO WHEN YOU START TELLING STORIES AROUND AN INDIGENOUS/NON-INDIGENOUS NARRATIVE, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU REMEMBER HOW DIFFERENT EACH OF US ARE.\n\nWE NEEDED TO DEVELOP COMPLEXITY UNDER SOME OF THESE UMBRELLAS, YOU KNOW, AND SO WORKING WITH DOUGLAS AND YUVAL AND DU YUN, EVERYBODY'S COMING TOGETHER TO
