But, he says, the furore was not all of his own creation.\n\nThe spokesman for the Islamic Cultural Centre in Clonskeagh, Dublin and its imam, Shaykh Hussein Halawa, came under fire after Dr Selim, on RTÃ‰'s Prime Time, apparently made a distinction between FGM and female circumcision.\n\nHe said the latter should be allowed but only in instances where this was recommended and allowed by doctors, creating an assumption that he was arguing in favour of FGM, but by another route.\n\nHe says this was never the case: \"I condemn FGM and I condemn circumcision that gives the same meaning as FGM. I totally apologise for the confusion.\""
