        "text": "American animator and filmmaker (born 1974)\n\nDoug Sweetland is an American animator and filmmaker. He wrote and directed the Pixar short film Presto (2008), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1994, Sweetland joined Pixar. His first assignment was as an animator on Toy Story. He continued as animator on A Bug's Life,[3] and Toy Story 2. He was nominated for an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Character Animation for the film.\n\nSweetland was awarded Annie Awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Character Animation for Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo.[2] He was supervising animator on Bud Luckey's Boundin'[4] and worked as an animator and storyboard artist on The Incredibles. Sweetland followed this being supervising animator on John Lasseter's Cars.[3]\n\nIn 2007, Sweetland pitched a short film about a sympathetic magician who gets \"dumped\" by his rabbit. This eventually evolved to a more slapstick film (and a throwback to Warner Bros. classic Looney Tunes). Teddy Newton was brought on board to design the characters; it emerged as Sweetland's directorial debut, Presto, which preceded WALL-E in theaters.[2] It was nominated in 2008 for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2008. After finishing Presto, Sweetland left Pixar in 2009.\n\nOn September 24, 2010, it was reported that Sweetland had been hired by Sony Pictures Animation to direct an animated film adaptation of The Familiars novel series;[3] that project has been cancelled. In January 2013, Warner Bros. developed the animated feature film Storks under their newly created Warner Animation Group banner, conceived and written by Nicholas Stoller and directed by Sweetland.[5] In April 2015, Warner Bros. announced that the film, which Sweetland co-directed with Stoller, would be released on September 23, 2016.[6]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nToy Story (1995) (animator)\n\nA Bug's Life (1998) (animator)\n\nToy Story 2 (1999) (animator)\n\nMonsters, Inc.
