        "text": "SOME PEOPLE WOULD KILL FOR THREE DAYS IN HAVANA\n\n3 Days in Havana is the testament of a life-long collaboration between two friends and the directorial debut for both Gil Bellows and Tony Pantages\n\nGil Bellows and Tony Pantages are pleased to announce that the feature film ‘3 Days in Havana’ will open in Cineplex Theatres across Canada on March 28th, 2014 via leading Canadian distributor Entertainment One (eOne). 3 Days in Havana is the directorial debut of filmmakers, Gil Bellows & Tony Pantages and is the testament of a life-long collaboration between two friends with a shared vision and the talented family of artists and technicians that joined them on the ride. The film stars Gil Bellows (Ally McBeal, Shawshank Redemption), Greg Wise (Sense and Sensibility), Robin Dunne (Sanctuary), Michael Eklund (The Call, True Justice), Christopher Heyerdahl (Hell on Wheels, True Blood) and John Cassini (Continuum, Blackstone)\n\nAbout The Film\n\nJack Petty (Gil Bellows) gets more than he bargained for when he travels to Havana on business and gets caught up in an assassination conspiracy with his new friend Harry Smith (Greg Wise).\n\nJack Petty sits in an airport bar, nursing a drink. He’s on a stopover halfway to Havana, and so is the sexy lady who chats him up, giving him travel tips and whispering something scary in his ear. He’ll meet her again, in the midst of a conspiracy that includes assassination, kidnapping and more.\n\nThis a film with a lot of tradition behind it: some major Hitchcock (particularly Strangers on a Train and The 39 Steps); the wised-up dialogue of old film noir; and the gritty detail and sharp plot twists of contemporary thrillers. It’s all put across with high spirits, and the cast is stellar—highlights include Christopher Heyerdahl as a slick member of the Canadian Consulate, John Cassini as a ruthless mob boss, and Phyllida Law as… well, you’ll see. And there are many other colourful characters, none of them trustworthy, most of them with their sights set on poor Jack. He’ll have to outwit, outrun or outfight them all—a tall order for a mere businessman on a conference trip. But he’s surprisingly cool under pressure. The fun here comes not just from the close shaves and slick repartee but from the knowledge, quickly acquired, that nothing is what it seems.

Gil also steered Ali Selim’s “Sweet Land” to win the Best First Feature trophy at the Independent Spirit Awards. Best known for creating the role of ‘Billy Thomas’ in the Emmy and Golden Globe Award winning FOX series “Ally McBeal,” Gil first gained international attention among filmgoers and critics for his portrayal of an inmate with a penchant for knowledge in the critically lauded “Shawshank Redemption,” opposite Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. In recent years, Bellows has found himself starring in several Canadian Independents including Paul Gross and Niv Fichman’s Canadian War-time Drama “Passchendaele” and “Toronto Stories”.\n\nTony Pantages is an award-winning director of music videos, commercials, documentaries and short films with trophies and nominations for MTV, MuchMusic, Clio & Juno awards. Pantages studied acting at the Loft Studio in LA under Peggy Feury where his classmates included Sean Penn, Matthew Broderick, Krispin Glover and Meg Ryan. After ten years of working with some of the top directors in the business, Tony switched to the other side of the lens, assisting the Oscar winning director John Schlesinger (Midnight Cowboy, Marathon Man) for two years before launching his own successful career directing number one music videos for INXS, Sarah McLachlan and Our Lady Peace and commercials for Lee Jeans & Canadian Airlines. His Behind The Scenes documentary “Beyond the Yellow Brick Road” about the Syfy Channel’s miniseries “Tin Man” broke their viewership record and aired 14 times. Mr. Pantages’ short film Passages was an official selection at the Vancouver International film Festival.\n\nSocial Media Handles\n\nTwitter: @3DaysInHavana, @realgilbellows, @tonypantages, @eOnefilms\n\nFacebook: facebook.com/3daysinhavana, facebook.com/eOnefilms\n\nMovie Trailer: vimeo.com/86457182\n\nIMDb: imdb.com/title/tt1842371/?ref_=nv_sr_1\n\nContact The Promotion People\n\nLesley Diana – Founder, President and Publicist\n\nlesley@thepromotionpeople.ca\n\n604.726.5575"
