        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAI or Artificial Intelligence to hone its creativity and imagination with technical skills to tell a story in ‘Secret Invasion’.\n\nAfter Marvel’s shows like ‘Loki’, ‘Ms. Marvel’ and ‘Moon Knight’, Method Studios has come out with ‘Secret Invasion’. But the main difference is that it has used AI or Artificial Intelligence to hone its creativity and imagination with technical skills to tell a story.\n\nDirector and Executive Producer Ali Selim has told journalists that Method Studios has used AI to design the intro sequence. The AI was prompted by the concept of Skrull cubism in the sequence of Skrull green. Selim also said that though he did not understand how the AI worked, he was fascinated by the way it reproduced the situation he wanted.\n\n‘Secret Invasion’ comes out with thousands of Skrulls that keep on shapeshifting, Nick Fury now and someone else the very next second. Nick Fury uncovers a secret invasion of Earth by Skrulls.\n\nThe striking Writers’ Guild of America has already expressed its concerns over the use of AI and many other stakeholders too have pointed out it might affect creativity. But director Ali Selim said that he felt the use of AI was ‘exciting and inevitable’.\n\nMarvel Comics created Skrulls as a race of extraterrestrial face-shifters. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the Skrulls who are from the planet Skrullos, situated in Andromeda Galaxy. But they infiltrated Earth, and this is the main event in ‘Secret Invasion’.\n\nThe Skrulls made their cinematic debut with the Marvel Cinematic Universe film, Captain Marvel in 2019. They also appeared in Spider-Man: Far from Home in 2019 and the Disney+ series WandaVision and What If...? in both 2021.\n\nFAQs:\n\nQ1:What are skrull?\n\nThe Skrulls are a race of extraterrestrial face-shifters from planet Skrullos and their empire is situated in Andromeda Galaxy.\n\nQ2:When the Skrulls made their cinematic debut?\n\nThe Skrulls made their cinematic debut with the Marvel Cinematic Universe film, Captain Marvel in 2019.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
