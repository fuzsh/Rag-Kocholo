        "text": "In today’s episode of Bingeworthy, our TV and streaming podcast host Mike DeAngelo returns from the stars to discuss Marvel’s latest Disney+ series, “Secret Invasion.” The show follows Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) as he beams back from outer space in order to stop a rogue faction of Skrulls that are hell-bent on taking Earth for themselves. The series also stars Emilia Clarke, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Don Cheadle, Martin Freeman, Olivia Colman, and more.\n\nLISTEN: ‘Justified: City Primeval’: Timothy Olyphant On Returning To Raylan Givens, Dabbling In ‘Star Wars’ & Almost Becoming Iron Man [Bingeworthy Podcast]\n\nJoining Bingeworthy to discuss the show is the director of all six episodes of the series, Ali Selim. Originally, Selim was only supposed to direct the last few episodes of the series, but scheduling conflicts put Marvel in a precarious position just before shooting began, resulting in Selim jumping on board to direct the entire series.\n\n“When I came on, there were two of us. I was going to do [episodes] four, five, six, and my friend, Tom Bezucha, was going to do [episodes] one, two, three,” Selim said. “And then he prepped for a while, but then we got into scheduling constraints for him or something, because I think the show got delayed a couple of times and he had to depart for the new season of ‘Fargo.’ So, he had to depart for that. And it was great for me. I think maybe a little bit ill-timed for Marvel, and so I was part of the scramble to fill those episodes.”\n\nLISTEN: Elgin James Goes Deep Into The ‘Mayans’ Finale, Different Potential Endings & The Possibility Of More To Come [Templo Talk]\n\nThe show has been heavily debated and contested amongst fans due to some big swings Marvel is taking away from the source material. The show has also come under fire for unceremoniously killing off multiple fan-favorite characters including Cobie Smulders’ Maria Hill. Many are questioning why the death had to occur and perhaps if the character will somehow miraculously return in the future. During the interview, Selim was quick to downplay his role in killing off Hill and discussed the possibility of a return.\n\n“If there was a debate [on killing off Hill], it happened before I showed up,” he explained. “And that was the big turn at the end of episode one. And my job was to make it emotional and truthful and an appropriate goodbye to her. I don’t know how the conversation began, but I’m sure that there will be ongoing conversations about bringing her back. This story takes place in 2023 – if they made a movie that takes place in 2021, she’ll be there, of course.”\n\nBut did Selim and company receive any directives from Marvel, seeing as Nick Fury is already planned to show up in the upcoming film, “The Marvels” at the end of this year? Apparently, there were very few requirements when all is said and done.\n\n“The only conversation I had was, ‘We just need Nick [Fury] to go up at the end,” Selim shared. “So, that was it – just make him go up. However he gets up, make him go up.”\n\nFan backlash or not, Selim is contently looking towards the future, even sharing the next Marvel project he’d like to head up if given the chance.\n\n“If I were lucky enough to receive the call, I would say let’s call Olivia Colman and Emilia Clarke,” Selim said. “I just think there’s a really strong story in that, you know? Is that ‘Secret Invasion’ Season 2? Is that something unto itself? I just think those two are incredible actors and those two incredible characters could really take us somewhere.”\n\n“Secret Invasion” is currently streaming in its entirety on Disney+.
