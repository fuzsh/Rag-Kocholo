Jon Fosse won the Nordic Council's literature prize and the international Ibsen prize, similar to the Nobel Prize in theater.\n\nFosse's novels have been translated into more than 40 languages, and his plays have been staged in many different countries. In 2007, the Daily Telegraph called Fosse a \"living genius\". Besides writing books, he is also a translator.\n\nBefore the results were announced, he was ranked second on the betting list of bookmaker NicerOdds, with a prediction rate of 5/1 (one to 5).\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is the fourth prize announced in the 2023 Nobel season and the 116th Nobel Prize in Literature since 1901.\n\nIn 2022, the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to French writer Annie Ernaux for “the courage and cold sensitivity with which she explored the roots, dissonances and limitations of personal memory.” core\".\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is one of six categories of the Nobel Prize, awarded to authors from any country, according to the will of chemist Alfred Nobel. The Swedish Academy will select the winner.\n\nThe prize was first awarded to French poet Sully Prudhomme in 1901.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature was designed by Swedish sculptor Erik Lindberg, with the image representing a young man sitting under a laurel tree.\n\nMeanwhile, Nobel certificates are unique works of art, created by Swedish and Norwegian artists and calligraphers."
