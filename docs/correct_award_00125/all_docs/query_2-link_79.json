        "text": "A child named Alfred Nobel was born in Sweden in 1833. His father’s occupation was to extract stones from the mountains and sell them. Alfred Nobel also used to go with his father. He wanted to work less and earn more money.\n\nHe was studying Chemistry. Because of that, he had set up a laboratory at home where he used to experiment. In 1866, Nobel was away from his home when his laboratory exploded, destroying his house and killing one of his brothers.\n\nNobel was overjoyed that his experiment had succeeded.\n\nHe rebuilt a new laboratory. In 1867, it exploded again and was named Dynamite. That’s why he is called the discoverer of Dynamite.\n\nNobel planted dynamite in the mountains. The explosion of it yielded many rocks (stones). Also, he earned a lot of money.\n\nAfter some time, Nobel started selling his dynamite and earning profit. People started misusing his dynamite and all of this created a negative image of Alfred Nobel. He was called “The Merchant of Death”.\n\nWhen his brother died in 1888, the French newspapers published that “The Merchant of death is no more”. There was a great celebration everywhere. When Nobel came to know the fact, he was very disappointed.\n\nTo improve his image, he wrote a will in 1895, stating that his wealth would be devoted to the people doing extraordinary things in 5 categories: Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Peace and Literature. While the 6th category, Economics, was added to the list in the 1960s.\n\nNobel died on December 10, 1896. The Royal Bank of Sweden made a mechanism and the first Nobel Prize was awarded in 1901 in 5 categories. At present, it is conferred on the expected people on 10th December every year.\n\nComposition of the Nobel Prize\n\nNobel Prize consists of the following things:\n\nA certificate\n\n11 million Swedish Krone(1 million USD)\n\n1 Gold Medal(worth 8000 USD)\n\nThe Nobel Prize in the field of peace is awarded in Oslo, Norway, while the other 5 are in Sweden.\n\n1st Nobel Awards in the History (1901)\n\nPeace\n\nHenry Durant, the founder of the Red Cross, and Fredric Passay were awarded the 1st Nobel Prize for peace.\n\nPhysics\n\nOn the discovery of X-rays, William Rontgen was given the 1st Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nChemistry\n\nVan T. Hoff was the 1st winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.\n\nMedicine\n\nEmile Von Behring won the 1st Nobel Prize in the field of medicine.\n\nLiterature\n\nSully Prudhomme(French poet) was the 1st winner of the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nEconomics\n\nThe 1st Nobel Prize in the field of economics was awarded to both Tan Tinberg and Norwegian economist Ranger Frisch.\n\nFirst Woman Winner of the Prize\n\nMadam Marie Curie was the 1st woman who won the Nobel Prize twice for the discovery of Radium and Polonium. She, along with her husband Pierri Curie, got the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. And she won the 2nd Prize in Chemistry in 1911.\n\nMoreover, the Curie family is the only one which got 5 Nobel Prizes — 2 by Marie, 1 by her husband, 1 by her daughter and 1 by her granddaughter.\n\nCountries with Most Nobel Prizes\n\nThe USA, UK, and Germany are the countries that have won Nobel Prizes for most of the times.\n\nNobel Prizes to the Muslim World\n\nThe Muslim countries have been awarded 16 Nobel Prizes so far. Of them, Egypt holds 5 and Pakistan possesses 2.\n\nAnwar Sadat, the president of Egypt, was the 1st Muslim to receive Prize in 1978 on the basis of the Camp David Agreement. Whereas, 2 persons, Abdus Salam and Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan, won the Prize in 1979 and 2014 respectively.\n\n1st Winners in Asia/South Asia\n\nRabindranath Tagore was the 1st Asian to win Nobel Prize in the field of literature for his magnum opus ‘Gitanjali’ in 1913.\n\nMoreover, the 1st Asian woman, Mother Teresa got the Nobel Prize for peace in 1979.\n\nPersons Who Declined Nobel Prize\n\nJean Paul Sartre, who was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize for literature, refused to receive it. Le Duc Tho and US Secretary Of State Henry Kissinger were jointly awarded the 1973 Nobel Prize, but the former declined it.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is clear that if you put your efforts into anything valuable, you are remembered for centuries. It is very true in the case of Alfred Nobel. No matter how many centuries go by, he will be in the memory of the people. So, you should take such valuable steps in your life that can keep your presence alive forever."
