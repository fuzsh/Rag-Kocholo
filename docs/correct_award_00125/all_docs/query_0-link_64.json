        "text": "Sully Prudhomme was pseudonym of RENÉ-FRANÇOIS-ARMAND PRUDHOMME (b. March 16, 1839, Paris, France--d. Sept. 7, 1907, Châtenay), French poet who was a leading member of the Parnassian movement, which sought to restore elegance, balance, and aesthetic standards to poetry, in reaction to the excesses of Romanticism. He was awarded the first Nobel Prize for Literature in 1901. Prudhomme studied science at school but was forced by an eye illness to renounce a scientific career. His first job was as a clerk in a factory office, which he left in 1860 to study law. In 1865 he began to publish fluent and melancholic verse inspired by an unhappy love affair. Stances et poemes (1865) contains his best known poem, Le vase brisé (\"The Broken Vase\"). Les Épreuves (1866; \"Trials\"), and Les Solitudes (1869; \"Solitude\") are also written in this first, sentimental style."
