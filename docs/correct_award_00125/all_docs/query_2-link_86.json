        "text": "Mary Evans Picture Library Photo Prints and Wall Art\n\nSully Prudhomme\n\nRENE-FRANCOIS-ARMAND pseudonym SULLY PRUDHOMME French poet Date: 1839 - 1907\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 14106439\n\n© Mary Evans Picture Library\n\n1839 Armand Francois Pseudonym Rene Sully 1907 Prudhomme\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nThis portrait captures the introspective and thoughtful nature of René-François-Armand Sully Prudhomme (1839-1907), a renowned French poet whose literary contributions left an indelible mark on the literary world. Born on January 20, 1839, in Paris, France, Prudhomme began writing poetry at a young age, and his works were first published in 1858. He adopted the pseudonym \"Sully Prudhomme\" later in life, and it was under this name that he gained international acclaim. Prudhomme's poetry was characterized by its deep introspection, emotional depth, and masterful use of language. He was a pioneer of the Symbolist movement, which emphasized the importance of emotion and the subconscious mind in art. Some of his most famous works include \"L'Amour et la Gloire\" (Love and Glory), \"L'Amour des Lettres\" (Love of Letters), and \"Les Belles Dames et les Bonnes Filles\" (Beautiful Women and Good Girls). Prudhomme's literary achievements were recognized with numerous awards, including the prestigious Prix Goncourt in 1882 for his collection of poems \"Les Belles Dame sans Merci et autres Poèmes.\" He was also awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901, making him the first French laureate in this category. This photograph, taken likely in the late 19th century, captures the poet in thoughtful contemplation, reflecting the deep introspection that characterized both his poetry and his persona. With his piercing gaze and serious expression, Sully Prudhomme appears lost in thought, as if pondering the depths of human emotion and the mysteries of the universe. This image serves as a fitting tribute to a poet whose works continue to inspire and captivate readers around the world.\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nFREE COLORIZATION SERVICE\n\nYou can choose advanced AI Colorization for this picture at no extra charge!\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
