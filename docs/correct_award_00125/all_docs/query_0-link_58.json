        "text": "Maryse Condé\n\nGiving Voice to Guadeloupe\n\nI am glad, and deeply proud, to be one Guadeloupean who has made her voice heard, thanks to the New Academy Prize. This gives me hope that Guadeloupe’s voice, despite the island’s misfortunes, remains powerful, remains magical, and still has the power to say no.\n\nFebruary 6, 2019\n\nMo Yan\n\nThe People's Liberation Army\n\nGetting into the People’s Liberation Army was hard, but not as hard as getting into college.\n\nDecember 10, 2012\n\nTim Parks\n\nA Game Without Rules\n\nIn 1904, three years after the first Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to the French poet Sully Prudhomme, the English Football Association chose not to participate in the formation of an International Football Federation (FIFA). They could not see the point. Nor in 1930, the year in which Sinclair Lewis won the Nobel, did England participate in the first World Cup: the English objected to the prospect of a ten-day ocean crossing to Uruguay to play teams that meant nothing to them. The first international football game, they pointed out, had been between England and Scotland, in 1872—a time when Alfred Nobel was still focused on improving his dynamite. Who needs Argentina or Brazil when you have Scotland to play?\n\nNovember 8, 2012\n\nTim Parks\n\nWhy the Nobel Prize is Silly\n\nSo the Swedish poet Tomas Tranströmer wins the Nobel prize for literature. Aside from a couple of long poems available on the net, I haven’t read Tranströmer, yet I feel sure this is a healthy decision in every way. Above all for the Nobel jury. Let me explain.\n\nOctober 6, 2011\n\nLi Xiaorong\n\nBeijing's Human Rights Problem\n\nOn January 13, President Obama invited me and four other activists and scholars to meet with him at the White House to discuss the current state of human rights and reform in China. The meeting, which lasted more than an hour, took place as the president prepares for this week’s meeting with Chinese president Hu Jintao in Washington. He wanted to know whether we think his approach on these issues is working, and how that approach might be improved.\n\nJanuary 18, 2011\n\nPerry Link\n\nAt the Nobel Ceremony: Liu Xiaobo's Empty Chair\n\nOn December 10, I attended the award ceremony in Oslo, Norway, for the Nobel Peace Prize, which the government of China had a few days earlier declared to be a “farce.” The recipient was a friend of mine, the Chinese scholar and essayist Liu Xiaobo, whom Oslo was now referring to as a Laureate and Beijing as a “criminal” serving an eleven-year sentence for “incitement to subvert state power.”\n\nDecember 13, 2010\n\nIan Johnson\n\nSigns of Reform in Beijing?\n\nOver the past six weeks, China’s thin class of the politically aware has been gripped by a faint hope that maybe, against all odds, some sort of political opening might be in the cards this year. Monday’s conclusion of a key Communist Party meeting didn’t exactly crush this hope, but it did put things in a much more sober perspective.\n\nOctober 20, 2010"
