        "text": "Jon Fosse, 64, the Norwegian dramatist and author, has written over forty plays, not to mention his extensive catalog of novels, poems, and other prose. Born in Haugesund, Norway, the author was in his native homeland when he received the call from the Nobel Committee that he had been awarded the prize. During the announcement, the Commitee said Fosse was chosen “for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable.”\n\nRead more on the works of the winner.\n\nWho was the winner of the award last year?\n\nAnnie Ernaux is a French author known for her autobiographical and semi-autobiographical works.\n\nHer writing style is characterised by its stark and unadorned prose, which often combines personal reflection with a sociological and historical perspective. Her works are known for their exploration of memory, identity, and the way in which individual experiences intersect with broader social and cultural contexts.\n\nWhich countries have seen the greatest number of Nobel prize winning laureates?\n\nFrance has a rich history of Nobel Prize laureates in literature, having the most with sixteen.\n\nSully Prudhomme was the first-ever recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was awarded the prize \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection, and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect.\""
