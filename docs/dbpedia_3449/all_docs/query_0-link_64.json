        "text": "The films of Catherine Breillat are haunted by the figure of a teenage girl. In her new feature, L’été dernier (Last Summer), it’s not immediately clear how this presence will play out but there is no doubt Breillat is once again exploring the transgressive, the unacceptable, the taboo. Since her 1976 debut, Une vraie jeune fille (A Real Young Girl), Breillat, 75, has tackled stories of sex, desire, power, violence and shame, always in her own distinctive fashion and with a disturbing precision and willingness to push boundaries.\n\nLast Summer is the story of a sexual relationship between a woman and her teenage stepson. A work of disconcerting elegance and shifting emotional ground, it’s one of the highlights of the Alliance Française French Film Festival, which runs nationally during March and April. It marks Breillat’s return to filmmaking after a 10-year absence. It was selected in competition at Cannes and she was nominated for the first time for best director at the Césars, France’s major screen awards.\n\nThe project – an adaptation of a 2019 Danish movie, Dronnigen (Queen of Hearts) – was brought to Breillat by producer Saïd Ben Saïd, who had acquired the rights. She wasn’t initially interested, but she watched Queen of Hearts and was immediately taken by a crucial scene in which the film shifts on its axis. “The lie!” she says, almost exultantly, recalling the moment that convinced her this was a film for her. “You know, I work a lot on denial. And on the lies people tell themselves.” She agreed to write a new screenplay and to direct it. It is the first time she has filmed a remake.\n\nHer version takes place in a comfortable bourgeois household outside Paris. The film is bathed in the golden light of summer, in a kind of unclouded, almost timeless present. Anne (Léa Drucker) is a lawyer who specialises in sexual assault cases. Her husband, Pierre (Olivier Rabourdin), overwhelmed by work, does his best to be attentive and available. They have two adopted children, Serena and Angela (Serena Hu and Angela Chen), whom they dote on. Anne drives a vintage Mercedes convertible and wears sleek dresses and matching heels. She is a figure of cool poise: as Breillat says, “a Hitchcockian heroine”.\n\nPierre tells Anne his troubled teenage son from his first marriage is coming to stay. He wants to make amends for having been a distant father to the 17-year-old Théo (Samuel Kircher). Théo, who is playful and warm with his little sisters, treats Anne with the same indifference and hostility he directs at his father. She catches him out in an act of theft and deception but tells him she will cover for him. In this moment of complicity, their relationship begins to develop.\n\nWe first see Anne at work, at the very beginning of the film, preparing a trembling teenager (Romane Violeau) for a court case in which she will have to face probing, brutal questions from lawyers for the accused. “It’s so important to the understanding of the rest of the film,” Breillat says of this scene. “There is Léa, very Bergmanian, very frozen” – in stark contrast to the visible distress of the young woman.\n\nLater we are given hints about Anne’s adolescence. There is a moment when, in bed with her husband, she recalls her adolescent obsession with an older friend of her mother, a man she was repulsed by yet drawn to. Later, in a conversation with Théo, she reveals some things about her youth but withholds others, making it clear she doesn’t want to talk about her first sexual experience.\n\nWhen Anne is with Théo, it is as if she becomes a version of her adolescent self, Breillat says. During the shooting of a scene, she recalls, she gave Drucker a cinematic reference point that would make this clear to her. To the actor, that made sense and offered her something to work with. “It was very exciting to play that, like she’s 16 again,” Drucker says. “She has a strong relationship with her own youth, something she probably doesn’t want to explore too much. But [Théo] brings it alive and that’s how they connect.” She feels Anne is “trying to repair herself”, without any real sense of the consequences.\n\nIn its treatment of sex, lies and adolescence, Last Summer has curious resonances with a little-seen film, Brève Traversée (Brief Crossing), that Breillat made in 2001 for a television series. It’s the story of a teenage French boy (Gilles Guillain) who meets an Englishwoman in her 30s (Sarah Pratt) on a cross-Channel ferry.\n\nBreillat’s adaptation closely follows aspects of Queen of Hearts, but also transforms it. A scene that echoes the original almost verbatim takes on an entirely different aspect in Breillat’s hands. “The words are the same, the meaning is different,” she says. “The script is word, the actor is flesh, it’s so different. I create always in the moment, and it’s so enjoyable. The pleasure of making a film is that you find the film in the instant that you’re shooting it, and with the actors you’ve chosen, who give you in the moment things you could never have imagined.\n\n“I tell my actors, what I want is for them to astonish me! If they perform exactly what’s written, there’s nothing interesting in that. To make the film is to create, and the screenplay is suddenly no longer important.” But, she adds, “they do say the words, the words are important. I don’t want people to improvise.” She tells her cast that dialogue operates in three ways: there’s the everyday truth; the lie told to deceive; and the lie of self-deception. She is fond of quoting a line from Jean Cocteau: “I am a lie that always tells the truth.”\n\nBreillat might want actors to astonish her, but as a director she likes to retain control, to choreograph and place them. She is very clear and precise about the image in the frame: it’s what defines cinema, she says. Key reference points in her films come from visual art, from painting. In Last Summer, it’s Raphael and Caravaggio – in particular, for a sex scene, Caravaggio’s Mary Magdalene in Ecstasy.\n\nLast Summer is not explicit in the way that some of her features have been. “This time I told my actors, ‘What I want … to shoot is the nudity of the face. It is much more intimate than the nudity of the body,’ ” Breillat says. She has, however, always been fascinated by the expressive power of the face in close-up. She explored this in striking ways, in film after film. In Sale comme un ange (Dirty Like an Angel) from 1991, what seems to be a gritty drama about a middle-aged cop is transformed into a completely different movie by an extended sex scene focusing on the shifting expressions of a young woman’s face. In À ma sœur! (Fat Girl, 2001), a 12-year-old girl, seen in close-up, becomes a remarkable conduit for the ambiguities and complexities of the movie.\n\nIn talking about her influences, Breillat always refers to a film she saw at the age of 12, Ingmar Bergman’s 1953 circus drama, Gycklarnas afton (Sawdust and Tinsel). She wrote about the experience for Cahiers du Cinéma in 2003. “When I saw this film, I immediately decided to be a filmmaker. Not out of love for the cinema. Out of necessity. In order to save myself. I did not decide to make films because I was a cinephile but because there was no life elsewhere. This film invented me when I was 12 years old. It awakened me to myself.” Soon afterwards, she watched Luis Buñuel’s Viridiana. The two central female characters in these films became crucial figures to her.\n\nBreillat’s sense of what it is to be a young girl – or a version of her – is a familiar yet perpetually unsettling element of her work. It is to be confined by boredom, impatience, trapped in the feeling of being observed yet ignored, feeling the burden of one’s own body, the tyranny of virginity, the sexualisation of the gaze of others, full of the desire to become someone, to become something other than what is expected. Breillat often talks about the “gaze of shame” she felt was imposed on her as a young woman and her imperative to explore and transcend it.\n\nWhen she looked at the possibility of going to film school, the directing course wasn’t open to women. Breillat was offered screenwriting or editing. She decided instead to write novels that she would go on to film. At the age of 17, she found a publisher for her first book, L’homme facile (A Man for the Asking). Her third novel, Le Soupirail, became her first feature, Une vraie jeune fille, in 1976. A combination of censorship problems and a producer’s bankruptcy meant the film was not released until 1999.\n\nThere is a kind of indomitability to Breillat, right from the very beginning. She says she has never felt welcome in the world of French cinema and has always seen herself as an outsider. Twenty years ago, shortly after she made one of her most controversial works, Anatomie de l’enfer (Anatomy of Hell, 2004), Breillat suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and a stroke that left her with partial paralysis on her left side. Her recovery was long and painful. She managed to return to work, directing Une vieille maîtresse (The Last Mistress, 2007), a period piece she adapted from the novel by 19th-century author Jules-Amédée Barbey d’Aurevilly. Her crew rallied around her: actors from many of her previous films signed on for minor roles.\n\nSubsequently she made two films for television, Barbe bleue (Bluebeard) and La belle endormie (The Sleeping Beauty), for a projected fairytale trilogy. She also had long-term plans to adapt one of her novels, Bad Love, with model Naomi Campbell in the lead. To play opposite Campbell, she sought out a man named Christophe Rocancourt, a serial con artist with a gift for storytelling whom she saw on television and became fascinated by. He told her he would appear in her movie, then ended up swindling her out of more than €700,000.\n\nIn 2009 she wrote a memoir, Abus de faiblesse (Abuse of Weakness), detailing what happened: her stroke, her recovery, her obsession with Rocancourt, his exploitation of her. Four years later she filmed a version of the story with Isabelle Huppert playing the central character. It’s a compelling work, and a tour de force for Huppert, but it was also a commercial failure. It left her wondering if she would ever make a film again. There was a 10-year hiatus until Last Summer came her way.\n\nIt took a while to get the movie off the ground, and delays in putting all the financing in place cost Breillat the actor she had cast as Théo. She considered many others for the role. “They were beautiful, and good actors, but they bored me. They played what I wrote, and me, I want champagne.” Fortunately, she says, her original choice, Paul Kircher, came up with an idea for a replacement: his younger brother, Samuel. The pair come from an acting family: their mother is Irène Jacob (The Double Life of Véronique, Three Colours: Red) and their father, actor Jérôme Kircher, makes a fleeting appearance in Last Summer as Anne’s boss.\n\nBreillat loves and celebrates her actors but she freely admits she can be demanding on set. Drucker, who gives a mesmerising, tightly controlled performance as Anne, recalls the challenges of her director’s expectations. “Her direction is sometimes very tough, because she is exploring very complex, very difficult things, then suddenly she says, ‘I want a tear, but from the left eye.’ And you feel like you’re going on a merry-go-round.” Drucker decided the best approach was to simply go with it, “to jump in”. “She has strong visions, and not everyone understands – sometimes I’m not sure I did – but I know it’s going to be interesting. It was a big adventure. With other directors I would say, ‘Do you think my character would really do that? Is that realistic?’, but with her if you do that, it’s just losing time.”"
