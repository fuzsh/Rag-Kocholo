You didn't break me. You opened your heart to me. We're soul mates, Joe. „ ~ Love Quinn to Joe.\n\n“ I'm not the problem... my husband is the problem... „ ~ Love Quinn in season three.\n\nLove Quinn is the main antagonist of the Netflix television series You.\n\nAt first, she seemed to be kind and intelligent, which made Joe Goldberg fall in love with her due to her idyllic sense and the fact that she was protective of her brother Forty. However, she is actually an obsessed, cunning, and manipulative serial killer just like Joe, and she would do whatever she could to get Joe close to her.\n\nShe is portrayed by Victoria Pedretti and Olivia Ragan as a child.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nLove was born in September 4th, in 1991 to the rich powerful Quinn family. She grew up with her twin brother Forty Quinn. Her parents were distant and mostly absent in raising their kids. Love and Forty were mostly dependent on each other and helped each other get through. When their parents established Anavrin when Love and Forty were around 12, they were constantly away and hired an au pair to look after them. She has a close bond with her brother, and the two were abused by their parents in their youth. Love eventually learned that Forty was raped by their babysitter Sofia, killed her, and allowed Forty to believe that he had committed the crime. Afterward, Sofia's death was covered up by their parents, while Forty suffered from a decline that caused him to become an addict and later enter a twelve-step program. It's assumed that Love did this not only to protect her brother but also to make him rely on her when he needed to, as it's shown that he relies on Love's support and attention.\n\nLove married a deaf man named James Kennedy in July 2016, but the two later divorced for unknown reasons. Kennedy later died in 2017 due to cancer, and Love became filled with grief, and when meeting Joe, she saw that he had suffered as well. However, it's theorized that Love might have killed her husband for unknown reasons, due to her manipulative nature. But this theory was soon confirmed later on, because it's revealed that Love actually did kill James for wanting a divorce, and he died because she poisoned him. It's also theorized that Kennedy might have learned of Love's possessive nature, or she possibly stalked James before they met and later married.\n\nLove later becomes an employee at the Anavrin, a marketplace owned by her parents, and is also an aspiring chef. She is also friends with literary agent Lucy Sprecher, blogger Sunrise Darshan Cummings, and acupuncturist Gabe Miranda. In addition, Love isn't interested in social media or branding and wants to live an interesting life after experiencing grief from her childhood and from her marriage.\n\nBefore the events of season two, Love was secretly stalking Joe, presumably before or after he came to Los Angeles.\n\nYou[]\n\nLove meets the protagonist of the show, Joe Goldberg, early on in the second season. Joe falls in love with her and attempts to be in a relationship with her. They engage in an on-and-off relationship throughout the series but seem to still have strong feelings for one another. Candace Stone, an ex-girlfriend of Joe’s whom he unsuccessfully tried to kill, later reveals Joe's past to Love, who later confronts him about the accusations, but he states that he left New York to get away from Candace.\n\nIn the season finale, it is revealed that Love has been stalking Joe and is researching him behind his back. She has also been manipulating many of the things he experienced throughout the season to happen, such as killing Delilah Alves. When Candace traps Joe in a cage he owns with the corpse of Delilah, she calls Love to see it with the intention of exposing Joe.\n\nLove pretends to storm off, crying and upset, as Joe confesses to everything he did previously and wants to be held accountable for his own actions. Candace follows her to console her, and by surprise, Love quickly slits Candace's throat, killing her. Love returns and reveals to Joe that she was stalking him and murdered Delilah herself. Afterward, Love also tells Joe that she is pregnant with their child when he attempts to kill her, and the two decide to stay together for the sake of the unborn child. Afterward, the two eventually stayed together and married, and they are seen living in a suburban neighborhood. Love is shown to be pregnant with their child, but Joe has become interested in their neighbor, Natalie Engler.\n\nMonths later, Love gives birth to a baby boy, whom she and Joe name Henry. Life is far from idyllic because of their duplicitous neighbors and marital strife. Joe becomes obsessed with Natalie, starts stalking her, and eventually kisses her. Love discovers Joe's infidelity, and after buying a vacant lot from her, she murders Natalie with a fire axe, forcing Joe to bury her body. Love then starts a bakery, \"A Fresh Tart.\" Henry later becomes sick with the measles, barely recovering. When one of their neighbours, Gil Brigham, confesses that his daughters got Henry sick and argues that vaccines are toxic, Love furiously smashes a rolling pin on Gil's head, knocking him out.\n\nWorried that Gil would report Love for assault, Joe and Love imprison Gil in their bakery's basement while they scribble up dirt on him. They eventually uncover that his son is a rapist, but the guilt of the revelation prompts Gil to hang himself. Love proceeds to frame Gil for Natalie's murder.\n\nJoe eventually falls in love with Marienne Bellamy, a local librarian. He attempts to make Love lose interest in him by convincing her to have an open marriage and inviting the neighbours, the Conrads, for an orgy. Love is overwhelmed and ultimately yells that she killed Natalie, forcing her and Joe to kidnap the Conrads. She even went as far as to enforce one of them to either kill themselves, or each other so that one can go free. But she is angered by the fact that neither of them would do such a thing, showing that their bond was stronger than Love's bond with Joe. Theo Engler finds out about the true nature of both Joe and Love when he stops by at the bakery, and although he was in denial due to his feelings for Love, he still tried to save the Conrads, which ultimately fails as Love finds and attempts to murder him out of impulse by smashing his head in with a fire extinguisher. Fortunately, this wasn't fatal.\n\nElsewhere, Joe murders Marienne's abusive ex-husband, Ryan Goodwin, and then decides to come clean about his feelings for Love dying out, while also wanting a divorce. This angers Love, who not only reveals that she killed her last husband, but she paralyses Joe and prepares to kill Marienne, but changes her mind after seeing Marienne's daughter, Juliette. She then attempts to kill Joe by slitting his throat, but he instead enacts a contingency plan that he devised by injecting her with aconite, killing her slowly and painfully. And all of those who were unjustly and undeservingly killed by Love were avenged. (Except for Sofia; she deserved it.)\n\nLegacy[]\n\nOnce she died, everything got better for the people of Madre Linda. Matthew and Theo Engler reconciled, and the bond between the Conrad couple became stronger than ever. They pursued a career of writing books for couples as well as making a game show out of their horrific experience of being in that cage. And everyone healed from all the horror, especially when more people started showing up at the Fresh Tart bakery once someone else took possession of it, which implied that so many people weren't fond of Love Quinn when she was still alive.\n\nHer actions had a large impact on Joe in Season 4, since Joe was forced to escape America and travel to Europe to lay low so that he could forget her awful memory and start anew, while also faking his death to make it look like she killed him and then herself, with Joe setting the house on fire to make it seem like Love burned it down before her \"suicide\". Joe also had to give his son up to Dante so that Henry wouldn't grow up to become as sick and twisted as his parents. And her father, Ray Quinn, sent an assassin named Elliot Tannenberg after Joe so that he could avenge the death of his daughter, which failed due to the fact that Elliot decided not to kill Joe. Joe's awful experience with Love left him paranoid and wary of who he chooses to stalk, since he gets immense deja vu of Love when he sees Kate Galvin holding a knife that was lodged into the dead body of her friend Gemma, who Rhys Montrose (Joe's split personality) killed. Her memory also continues to haunt him through his dreams, and her actions become known to Kate's father, Tom Lockwood.\n\nAfter Joe kills Tom Lockwood, following a failed attempt to commit suicide to prevent any more misery that he could cause, Kate Galvin helps clear Joe's name and record after she inherits her father's company and resources, with everyone now thinking that Joe Goldberg was innocent and a survivor of Love's mental instability due to Joe Goldberg lying once more.\n\nBut people continued to remember Love Quinn as a deranged, lovesick, unstable, and obsessive serial killer who acted on impulse.\n\nPersonality[]\n\n“ You are just as broken as I am. You're just a much better liar. „ ~ Forty to Love.\n\nAt first, Love shows herself to be intelligent, kind, and good-natured, as she loves cooking for people and making others happy. She has a close bond with her brother, being protective and caring for his needs, often taking him to places where he needs to be. Once she meets Joe, she shows herself to be outgoing, taking him on adventures but having an on-and-off relationship with him. inside, she shows herself to be saddened by many things that have happened in her life, such as her losing her husband and the abuse she and her brother suffered from their parents. Despite having suffered from a great loss, she is shown to be an idyllic person, as Joe is unable to resist falling in love with her.\n\nHowever, most of Love's compassionate personality is a façade, as she is an obsessive, cunning, manipulative, possessive, and delusional individual. She is willing to go to great lengths to have Joe, wanting him to meet her friends immediately, and was annoyed that he cancelled some of their dates. Love is cunning and analytical; she is able to figure out what the perfect meal is for Joe and manipulate many events for him to stay with her. She is also strategic, as she tells Joe of her plan to have Ellie fall for the murders but knows she won't be arrested because of her family's connections. In addition, she is greatly possessive, wanting her brother to always need her and wanting Joe close to her.\n\nShe is also unnervingly delusional, telling Joe that he was justified in killing Beck and stating that she wasn't special. In addition, she believes that what she does is for Joe's love, as she kills Delilah and Candace and is willing to help cover up Henderson's murder. This is further proven when she admits to stalking Joe and admits that she has loved him since then, causing him to lose his idyllic and perfect view of Love. Something worth pointing out is that as the story in Season 3 progresses, Love becomes more and more unstable, and she finds it harder to hide her true nature. And her shaking and panting when she seemingly kills Theo backs up this claim.\n\nShe is a mirror image of Joe himself, as both have experienced abuse from their childhoods, grieve over loved ones, and are willing to protect someone they care for. Both are also greatly charming and manipulative, being able to put on facades that are kind and nurturing and have a strange idea of romance. However, both are honorable in some ways, as both have protected their loved ones, as Joe killed Ron to protect Paco and Love murdered Sofia to protect Forty.\n\nVictims[]\n\nDireclty\n\nSofia: Throat slit.\n\nJames Kennedy: Poisoned.\n\nDelilah Alves: Throat slit.\n\nCandace Stone: Stabbed in the neck with a broken glass bottle.\n\nNatalie Engler: Killed with an axe to the neck.\n\nIndirecty\n\nGil Brigham: At first, he's knocked out by Love and later imprisoned by Joe Goldberg, who threatened him with some dirt he had on him, which made him to commit suicide.\n\nTotal: 6\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFamily[]\n\nDottie Quinn - Mother (strained)\n\nRay Quinn - Father (disowned)\n\nForty Quinn † - Brother\n\nJames Kennedy † - First Husband (victim)\n\nJoe Goldberg - Second Husband (attempted victim and killer)\n\nHenry Goldberg - Son (with Joe Goldberg)\n\nIvan Mooney - Father-in-Law\n\nRaphael Goldberg - Father-in-Law\n\nSandy - Mother-in-Law\n\nAllies[]\n\nLucy Sprecher - Former Friend\n\nGabe Miranda - Former Close Friend\n\nSunrise Cummings - Former Friend\n\nTheo Engler - Former Neighbor, Former Affair and Attempted Victim\n\nMilo Warrington - Former Boyfriend (best friend of first husband)\n\nEllie Alves - babysitted after her murder of Delilah\n\nAlec Grigoryan - Former Employee\n\nEnemies[]\n\nSofia † - Former au pair turned Victim\n\nCandace Stone † - Former Acquaintance turned Stalkee and Victim\n\nDelilah Alves † - Victim\n\nDavid Fincher - killed her brother Forty\n\nJames Kennedy † - Former Husband turned Victim\n\nJoe Goldberg - Former Husband turned Archenemy, Attempted Victim and Killer\n\nMatthew Engler - Former neighbor turned pursuer.\n\nNatalie Engler † - Stalkee and Victim\n\nTheo Engler - Former Neighbor, Former Affair and Attempted Victim after he tried to rescue the Conrads from captivity.\n\nGil Brigham † - Attempted Victim until his suicide\n\nMarienne Bellamy - Love Rival and Intended Victim (changed mind)\n\nSherry Conrad - Former Best Friend turned Enemy and Attempted Victim\n\nCary Conrad - Former Friend turned Enemy\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn the book, Love doesn't actually kill anyone but discovers Joe's crimes and willingly covers them up.\n\nLove saying the word \"wolf\" as a replacement verb for \"love\" is a foreshadowing of her true nature: being an intelligent predator that hides in sheep's clothing and strategically traps their prey.\n\nLove fits the western example of the Yandere archetype. She's possessive of Joe, but she becomes exceptionally so as she kills Candace and Delilah.\n\nShe possibly suffered from borderline personality disorder, which is also something that most yanderes have.\n\n[]\n\nLove Quinn on the You Wiki\n\nNavigation[]"
