Film Independent President Josh Welsh introduced the prerecorded video announcement, which featured guest presenters Joel Kim Booster (2023 Spirit Award nominee for Fire Island) and Natalie Morales (No Hard Feelings). American Fiction, May December and Past Lives led the film nominations with five each, while I’m a Virgo and The Last of Us garnered the most nominations in the television categories. Watch the announcement here.\n\nThe 39th Film Independent Spirit Awards, hosted by Saturday Night Live alum Aidy Bryant, will take place on Sunday, February 25, 2024. The in-person show, held at the beach in Santa Monica, will be streamed live on the IMDb and Film Independent YouTube channels, and across other social platforms. The Spirit Awards are the primary fundraiser for Film Independent’s year-round slate of programs, which cultivate the careers of emerging filmmakers and celebrate creative independence, diversity, innovation and uniqueness of vision in independent film and television.\n\nThis year will also pay special tribute to the 30th anniversary of Film Independent’s innovative and influential Artist Development program, which supports creative voices and diverse perspectives in film and television by giving filmmakers the resources they need to advance their projects and build sustainable careers. Artists who have received support from the Artist Development program include Elegance Bratton (The Inspector), Siân Heder (CODA), Justin Simien (Dear White People), Lulu Wang (The Farewell) and Chloé Zhao (Nomadland).\n\n“This year’s exciting group of Spirit Award nominees reflect the undeniable strength and vitality of independent storytelling – this is the beating heart of film culture today,” said Josh Welsh, President of Film Independent. “It’s especially thrilling to see so many nominees who have benefited from the support of the Artist Development program. We can’t wait to celebrate the incredible work these artists have created and look forward to everything they have in store for us for years to come.”\n\nThe 2024 Best Feature nominees include All of Us Strangers, American Fiction, May December, Passages, Past Lives and We Grown Now. Showing Up, from director Kelly Reichardt, has been selected to receive the Robert Altman Award, which is bestowed upon a single film’s director, casting director and ensemble cast. The Altman Award was created in 2008 in honor of legendary director Robert Altman, known for populating his films with extraordinary ensemble casts.\n\nOn the television side, the 2024 Best New Scripted Series nominees include Beef, Dreaming Whilst Black, I’m a Virgo, Jury Duty and Slip. In the Best New Non-Scripted or Documentary Series category, the nominees are Deadlocked: How America Shaped the Supreme Court, Dear Mama, Murder in Big Horn, Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawrence and Wrestlers.\n\nNew to the television categories is Best Breakthrough Performance in a New Scripted Series, honoring actors making themselves known to wider audiences through noteworthy character portrayals. The nominees include Clark Backo for The Changeling, Aria Mia Loberti for All the Light We Cannot See, Adjani Salmon for Dreaming Whilst Black, Keivonn Montreal Woodard for The Last of Us and Kara Young for I’m a Virgo.\n\nAmong this year’s nominees, ten have been previously supported by Film Independent’s Artist Development programs. They include Maria Altamirano (Best First Feature for All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt), Tze Chun (Best New Scripted Series for I’m a Virgo), Ruben Fleischer (Best New Scripted Series for Jury Duty), Jomo Fray (Best Cinematography for All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt), Raven Jackson (Best First Feature for All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt), Pamela Koffler (Best Feature for May December and Past Lives), Krista Parris (Best New Non-Scripted or Documentary Series for Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawrence), Kelly Reichardt (Robert Altman Award for Showing Up), Laura Wagner (John Cassavetes Award for Fremont) and Monique Walton (Producers Award).\n\nThis year the Spirit Awards Film Nominating Committees selected nominees from over 27 different countries with budget ranges between $10,000 and $28 million, applying the following guidelines in determining nominees: uniqueness of vision, original and provocative subject matter and economy of means. Of all nominated writers, directors, producers and technical artists, 40% are women and 32% are BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color). Among the nominated performers, 49% are women and 40% are BIPOC. And of all 2024 nominees, 42% are women and 34% are BIPOC.\n\nThe Spirit Awards Nominating Committees are comprised of writers, directors, producers, cinematographers, editors, actors, critics, casting directors, film festival programmers and other working film professionals. This year, the Spirit Awards nominating committees are 56% female, 3% Nonbinary, 3% Transgender, and 49% BIPOC; 29% identify as LGBTQ+ and 3% identify as people with disabilities (PWD).\n\nFilm Independent Spirit Awards are supported by Principal Sponsor IMDb and Official Sponsors Bulleit Frontier Whiskey and FIJI Water.
