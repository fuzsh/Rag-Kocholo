The Hollywood Reporter compiled a list of some of the most recent true-crime series and films available to stream.\n\nThese hit shows and movies have garnered more than 60 Emmy nominations over the last few years, with nearly 20 more coming this year for Griselda, Under the Bridge, The Jinx — Part Two and, though not necessarily true-crime, Feud: Capote vs. the Swans.\n\nA 2022 YouGov poll showed that half of Americans enjoy true-crime content, with one in three saying they consume it at least once a week and one in four admitting that they watch it multiple times per week. The poll also showed that true-crime series and movies tend to make people more empathetic toward victims and safety-conscious, as well as better-versed in how the criminal justice system works.\n\nWith interest in true crime seemingly at an all-time high, as viewers seek content that transports them into real-life stories, it’s no surprise there are constantly more docuseries premiering across several streaming platforms.\n\nSo, what is it about the true crime genre that draws people in so much? According to Jean Kim, M.D., audiences may be entranced by the content because they find comfort in the reassuring narrative formula, its reinforcing sense of moral clarity and how it reminds them of their luck at times.\n\nBelow, find a list of 35 true-crime (or true-crime adjacent) TV shows and movies that can be watched on Max, Netflix, Hulu and more."
