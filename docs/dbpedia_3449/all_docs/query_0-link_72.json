So I'm intrigued to read that, as well as watch the film again on Apple TV - where I think it may work better with access to a pause button.\n\nYeah I got the message - it was the artistic 'vehicle' that was used to convey that message (and the cameo) that came out of the blue for me and took me out of the story.\n\nSame - didn't really work for me.

Marty comes on at the end to gaslight us into believing it was Molly's story all along rather than actually tell the story from a woman's perspective in the first place. God forbid.\n\nMolly looms over the entire film for me. Ultimately her lack of available perspective is there because how could she? A Native American woman in the 1920s, without control of her own finances due to the guardian system (her original being linked to the KKK and then it being Ernest), chronically ill and poisoned. Adding her going to Washington herself was a key break from history but ultimately the story is much about the agency she is denied.\n\nI don't think the heartbreaking reality of her situation would be fixed with some grand speech or Oscar moment.\n\nMolly looms over the entire film for me.

The trip to Washington is a case in point. You could make a whole film about just that story instead it's done away with in a quick montage whereas every moment of her awful husband's story is told in detail. Marty chose to tell the story of a Native woman through the eyes of a white man. Quelle surprise.\n\nPriscilla was a mixed bag for me. It’s very atypical Sofia at its best and at its most stagnant.\n\nHowever, Caitlin Spaeny is such a revelation as Priscilla. She is the strongest part of this and loved her in the role. Much like many of Coppola’s female protagonists, we view Priscilla through a myopic lens. It feels like we see Priscilla’s entire life up to marrying Elvis in the blink of an eye and then she’s trapped in Graceland, just trying to play with her dog without hundreds of pleebs screaming/staring at her through the gates. Spaeny manages to break through these barriers and give a warm, deeply layered performance.\n\nI did have one major gripe that I never thought I’d see in a film made my Sofia: Elvis being painted as a victim. The film goes into overdrive trying to make us feel bad for Elvis and his overnight fame. The pedophilic nature of his age gap with Priscilla is painted as “oh he’s this young man thrust into jumonstrous fame, he couldn’t help who he fell in love with.” A little gross.\n\nI did have one major gripe that I never thought I’d see in a film made my Sofia: Elvis being painted as a victim.

He’s already a massive international star by the time Priscilla meets him. We don’t witness his rise and we only have brief references to Colonel Tom Parker, while Elvis (2022) spends far more time portraying Elvis as Parker’s victim.\n\nYou see the typical grooming talk, “She’s much more mature than her age” and his lies to her from an early stage. He disappears for a year then comes back with extreme attention sweeping her back into his world. They were limited by it being an adaptation of Priscilla’s book, and her still in her 70s having affection for him.\n\nWe hear his point of view as he’s manipulating Priscilla but I never took the film’s viewpoint to ever be that what he’s saying is truthful. Because at the same time he’s controlling her and her appearance and taking away all agency from her."
