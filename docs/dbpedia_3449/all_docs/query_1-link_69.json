        "text": "Ahead of the theatrical debut of Crimes of the Future next month, director David Cronenberg has announced his next feature film, The Shrouds, will reunite him with Vincent Cassel.\n\nThe Shrouds, which will be written and directed by Cronenberg, “centres on Karsh (Cassel), an innovative businessman and grieving widower, who builds a device to connect with the dead inside a burial shroud.”\n\nThe official longline for The Shrouds reads: “Karsh’s revolutionary business is on the verge of breaking into the international mainstream when several graves within his cemetery are vandalized and nearly destroyed, including that of his wife. While he struggles to uncover a clear motive for the attack, the mystery of who wrought this havoc, and why, will drive Karsh to reevaluate his business, marriage and fidelity to his late wife’s memory, as well as push him to new beginnings.”\n\nCronenberg and Cassel previously teamed up on Eastern Promises and A Dangerous Method. Cassel’s other credits include the likes of Doberman, Irreversible, Ocean’s Twelve, Ocean’s Thirteen and Black Swan.\n\n“We are thrilled to be going on a journey into the newest world from the distinctive imagination of David Cronenberg,” said producer Saïd Ben Saïd of SBS Productions. “His ability to write smart and unconventional screenplays and then translate them into unique experiences on screen makes him a unique voice in film.”\n\nSEE ALSO: Red band trailer for David Cronenberg’s Crimes of the Future starring Viggo Mortensen, Lea Seydoux, and Kristen Stewart\n\nFilming on The Shrouds is set to begin in March 2023. Sales will launch at Cannes, where Cronenberg will premiere his latest film, Crimes of the Future starring Viggo Mortensen, Léa Seydoux and Kristen Stewart."
