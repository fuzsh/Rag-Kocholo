        "text": "In 1978, Rodney Alcala appeared on The Dating Game — the popular game show where three eligible bachelors vied for a date with a bachelorette.\n\nThe show was heavy on innuendo. The host introduced Alcala as a “successful photographer who got his start when his father found him in the darkroom at the age of 13, fully developed.”\n\nThroughout the episode, Alcala enthusiastically responded to the bachelorette’s suggestive questions: likening himself to a banana, saying that nighttime is when he “really gets good” and acting out the part of a dirty old man.\n\nHe was charming enough that the woman, Cheryl Bradshaw, chose him for a date.\n\nBut what Bradshaw — and the viewing audience — didn’t know was that Alcala was a serial killer in the midst of a rampage. Here's everything to know about Rodney Alcala and his appearance on The Dating Game.\n\nWho Was Rodney Alcala?\n\nAlcala was selected by the show because he was tall, handsome and charming. Producers did not conduct a background check, so they didn’t know he had also already murdered at least two women in Southern California. Previously, he had served 34 months in prison for the brutal rape and beating of an 8-year-old girl. He had briefly been put on the FBI’s Most Wanted list as well.\n\nSomehow, The Dating Game bachelorette Bradshaw sensed something was wrong. After the show, she refused to go out with him, saying he was too “creepy.”\n\nBy the time of his 1979 arrest, Alcala had killed at least seven women, but authorities believe the body count could be much higher.\n\nProsecutors said Alcala was a cruel killer who toyed with his victims. He would beat or strangle them until they lost consciousness. When they woke up, he would repeat the process before finally killing them.\n\nIn 1980, Alcala was sentenced to death for 12-year-old Robin Samsoe's murder; the judgment was reversed in 1984, though, and he was granted a new trial. He was sentenced to death again in 1986, only for that judgment to be overturned in 2003.\n\nHowever, Orange County prosecutors soon discovered Alcala's DNA matched evidence connected to four other women murdered between 1977 and 1979: Jill Barcomb, 18; Jill Parenteau, 21; Georgia Wixted, 27; Charlotte Lamb, 32.\n\nIn 2010, an Orange County jury convicted Alcala on five counts of first-degree murder, for which he was sentenced to death yet again.\n\nFollowing his conviction, Alcala faced more murder charges in other states. In New York, he was sentenced to 25 years to life in 2012 for the 1970s murders of Cornelia Crilley and Ellen Jane Hover. In 2016, Wyoming prosecutors charged him with killing Christine Ruth Thornton, a 28-year-old woman who was six months pregnant when she died in 1977.\n\nAuthorities continued active investigations into Alcala’s suspected connection to several unsolved murders in states like Washington, New Hampshire and Arizona.\n\nOn July 24, 2021, the serial killer and sex offender died of natural causes at age 77 while on death row in California. Though the true death toll remains unknown, authorities believe Alcala may have killed up to 130 people, according to The Associated Press.\n\nRevisiting the Case\n\nAlcala’s case was examined on the Nov. 18, 2017, episode of the Reelz Channel’s Murder Made Me Famous, which spoke of several people involved in the case, many of whom rarely gave interviews.\n\nDecades after Alcala’s horrific crimes, the victims’ families are still grappling with the pain he inflicted. Robin Samsoe was just 12 years old when Alcala saw her riding her bike to ballet class in 1979. Her mother, Marianne Connelly, recalled what happened when Robin didn’t return home that evening.\n\n“I called the police and said my daughter’s missing,” Connelly told the show. “They told me they couldn’t take a report for 24 hours. By the next morning, they declared it a kidnapping.”\n\nAbout 12 days later, Robin’s decomposed remains had been found, scavenged by animals.\n\nConnelly recalled what happened when the authorities arrived at her house. “The sergeant says, ‘We found Robin,’ ” she recalled. “I grabbed my purse and said, ‘OK, let’s go.’ He said, ‘Where do you think you’re going?’ I said, ‘To go see Robin.’ ”\n\nThe sergeant told Connelly she couldn’t identify the body because it took three days to identify her remains.\n\n“I got so mad,” Connelly recalled. “I said, ‘Three days? How many little girls with long blonde hair disappear in California?’ And he said, ‘There was no hair.’ ”\n\nConnelly didn’t mince words when speaking about Alcala. “He’s the devil himself,” she told the show. “The devil himself.”"
