        "text": "David Cronenberg (A History of Violence, The Fly) has jumped on a new film project to write and direct titled The Shrouds, and it will reunite him with Vincent Cassel, who is set to star in the movie. The two previously worked together on films such as Eastern Promises and A Dangerous Method.\n\nThe story for The Shrouds centers on Karsh (Cassel), “an innovative businessman and grieving widower, who builds a device to connect with the dead inside a burial shroud.” That sounds like the kind of crazy and interesting story that you’d expect from Cronenberg.\n\nThe full plot summary reads: “Karsh’s revolutionary business is on the verge of breaking into the international mainstream when several graves within his cemetery are vandalized and nearly destroyed, including that of his wife. While he struggles to uncover a clear motive for the attack, the mystery of who wrought this havoc, and why, will drive Karsh to reevaluate his business, marriage and fidelity to his late wife’s memory, as well as push him to new beginnings.”\n\nProducer Saïd Ben Saïd said in a statement, “We are thrilled to be going on a journey into the newest world from the distinctive imagination of David Cronenberg. His ability to write smart and unconventional screenplays and then translate them into unique experiences on screen makes him a unique voice in film.”\n\nCronenberg most recently directed the insane-looking film Crimes of the Future, which will premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe Shrouds will begin production in March 2023."
