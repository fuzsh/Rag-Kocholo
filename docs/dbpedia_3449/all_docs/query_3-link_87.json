        "text": "produced by: Gabrielle Tana\n\ndirected by: Steven Cantor\n\nrated: unrated\n\nruntime: 85 min.\n\nU.S. release date: September 16, 2016 (limited) and October 21-27, 2016 (at Gene Siskel Film Center, Chicago, IL )\n\nI have never heard of Sergei Polunin before seeing this documentary. That’s obviously one reason why Steven Cantor directed “Dancer”, which chronicles the rise of the 26-year-old Ukrainian ballet superstar – so viewers like me will be aware who this lean, ripped and heavily-tattooed young man is and what he has done. It’s also a reason why I seek out such documentaries. Like “A Ballerina’s Tale“, earlier this year, the subject intrigues me, which is what gravitates me to this type of doc. Die-hard fans may know all about this extremely talented dancer, but Cantor goes behind-the-scenes, focusing on what it took both Polunin and his family to get him where he’s at right now and it’s quite compelling regardless of what you know prior to viewing. Read more…\n\nTwo documentaries related to aspects of two totally different types of music played at the Chicago International Film Festival (CIFF) recently – both of them look at unsung talents from their own respective eras and both seek to educate viewers as to who they are and what became of them. “Strike a Pose” premiered earlier this year at the Berlin International Film Festival and looks at Madonna’s backup singers from the early 90s, while “Two Trains Runnin'” looks at what transpired back in 1964 when a two different groups of white men drove down to Mississippi in search of two blues legends. Both documentaries deal with talent that has been all but forgotten and they both seek to use their subject material to inform and educate those who were aware of these talents as well as those who had no prior knowledge whatsoever. Read more…\n\n(a little blurry from all the yucks!)\n\nLast night, local Chicago filmmaker Ned Crowley appeared on the red carpet at the 52nd Chicago International Film Festival (CIFF) with actor Jim O’Heir (of “Parks and Recreation” fame) for their film “Middle Man”. The twisted dark comedy is about a nebbish accountant in Peoria, Illinois named Lenny (O’Heir), who has an affinity for old school comedians and decides to head to Las Vegas to after his mother dies to follow his dream of becoming a stand-up comic. As his road trip gets closer to his destination, the story gets bloody and deadly and Lenny soon finds himself in a heap of trouble as he starts to count the cost of newfound success while struggling with doing the right thing. You can read my mini-review here and below you’ll find my red-carpet interaction with these two talented fellas, prior to their Friday night screening of “Middle Man”.

The almost three-hour Romanian drama “Sieranevada” from writer/director Cristi Puiu, which centers on a family gathering on the anniversary of a patriarch’s death took two of the top prizes, for Best Film and Best Director; while another Romanian drama, “Graduation” a complex film about the implications that arise when a parent uses his influence to compromise results that will benefit his daughter’s future, took two awards as well, Best Actor and Best Screenplay. Both films are the Romanian submission for Best Foreign Language Film at next year’s Oscars. Read more…\n\nIt’s always cool to see films by local filmmakers bring their work to the Chicago International Film Festival (CIFF) each year. The dark comedy “Middle Man”, from Chicagoan Ned Crowley is one such film. This is the feature-length debut for the writer and director, who has also published children’s books, written and directed comedy sketches for stage and is a CCO for a commercial ad agency. I’m exhausted just thinking about all that. “Middle Man” is the kind of twisted, humorous tale I grew up watching on “Tales from the Darkside” and it asks questions such as “How far are you willing to go to follow your dream?” and “Once you’ve grabbed your dream, do you go with your feelings or what you know to be right?” Read more…\n\nwritten by: Kleber Mendonça Filho\n\nproduced by: Saïd Ben Saïd, Emilie Lesclaux and Michel Merkt\n\ndirected by: Kleber Mendonça Filho\n\nrated: unrated\n\nruntime: 140 min.\n\nU.S. release date: May 17, 2016 (Cannes) and October 21, 2016 (limited)\n\nAt one point, during something of a family intervention, 65-year-old Clara’s daughter frustratingly declares something we’ve already learned, “You’re so stubborn!”, she says, next to her two brothers, “You’re like an old lady and a child!” Under her breath, Clara agrees and so do we, which is one of the many reasons why we love her in “Aquarius”. Brazilian writer/director Kleber Mendonca Filho has created one of the most soulful and strong characters I’ve seen on-screen all year in Clara and he’s extremely fortunate to have Brazilian-born Sonia Braga portraying her, in what is certainly some career-best work from the radiant and sublime actress. I usually don’t just come out and say this so quickly, but I loved this film. I really and truly did.

The Chicago International Film Festival (CIFF) is usually a great place to experience just that. With all the variety of films to choose from there’s really no way of knowing which film or what kind of film will have that kind of impact on me. On the first official day of the festival, I saw “Futures Past” and it surprised and moved me. Why did I choose a local documentary that was seemingly about Chicago Mercantile Exchange and stocks and trading – things I’m clueless about and almost have no interest in? Well, because I was set on seeing a film that was playing after this one and I realized I would be able to squeeze in a movie before it. Since the director would be there for a Q&A after the screening of “Futures Past”, I decided to give it a try – after all, my goal is to see as many films I can see at CIFF, so when an opportunity arises and I’m not exhausting from fatigue, I should seize it – which is what I did and the result is one of the best festival films I’ve seen so far. Read more…\n\nwritten by: Robert Towne and Sam Peckinpah (from a novel by William Douglas Lansford\n\nproduced by: Ted Richmond\n\ndirected by: Buzz Kulik\n\nrated: R\n\nruntime: 125 min.\n\nU.S. release date: May 29, 1968\n\nDVD/blu-ray release date: october 18, 2016\n\nWith the recent remake of “The Magnificent Seven” and HBO’s reimagining of “Westworld”, there may be some who are curious about actor Yul Brenner’s career, since his name is synonymous with the original releases of those both those properties. I found myself drawn to “Villa Rides!”, because of a newfound curiosity in Brenner and also due to the actors he teams up with in his return to the western genre here. It’s a loud and ambitious movie that was written by the likes of Robert Towne and Sam Peckinpah, both of whom are adapting William Douglas Lansford’s novel Pancho Villa, about the Mexican revolutionary general. Based on that and Brenner’s top-billing, you can guess who’s playing Villa in this movie from Buzz Kulik – a guy who directed nine episodes of “The Twilight Zone”, “Brian’s Song” and Steve McQueen’s last movie “The Hunter”. Read more…\n\nTwo documentaries that recently screened at TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) will be at CIFF (Chicago International Film Festival, which is currently under way, from October 13th thru October 27th, at AMC River East on 322 E. Illinois St. From Romania comes “A Mere Breath” (originally titled: “Doar o rasuflare”), directed by Monica Lazurean-Gorgan, which recently won Best Documentary Film Award at the Heart of Sarajevo Film Festival and the other is the latest film from Oscar-winning American director Errol Morris. That’s where their similarities ends, although you could say that both filmmakers are interested in capturing their subjects “as is” without any flourishes or specific perspective and, in turn, both films succeed because of that approach. Read more…\n\nIt’s time once again for the Chicago International Film Festival! Which means it’s October and that I will be stuck in an endless cycle of manic fatigue and over-caffeinated insanity as I try to cover as many films as possible. So far, it’s not so good. Not because of the quality of the films I’ve seen in advance thus far, but rather because life has gotten in the way (as it does) and I haven’t watched the amount of films I had hoped. Which means I just need to double down and keep plowing through as many festival films as possible. Why? Because I always wind up watching some amazing films each year. Films that broaden my vision of the world and introduce me to new filmmakers and (hopefully) reignite my hope and enthusiasm for film. Read more…"
