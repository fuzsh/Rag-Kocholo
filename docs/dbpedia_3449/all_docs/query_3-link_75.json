        "text": "Paris, 15th of October, 2020\n\n​\n\nBy voting in 1989 for the Television without Frontiers Directive – which later developed into the Audiovisual Media Services Directive – the European Commission has placed the protection of cultural diversity at the heart of its concerns. These Directives, which are the foundation of European audiovisual policy, require traditional broadcasters to invest and promote European content, to the benefit of European and local industries which, as a result, have managed to remain vibrant and produce the great films and TV series known and celebrated worldwide.\n\n​\n\nWe, all European audiovisual authors and producers, call for the European Commission and all EU Member States to level the playing field between all operators and enforce on the online platforms operating in our countries the same commitments towards European Culture that traditional broadcasters have been fulfilling.\n\n​\n\nThe global health crisis has taught us at least two things: first, that the audience’s demand for visual stories has not diminished, and that the main beneficiaries of this continuing demand are, of course, online platforms. Secondly, the vulnerability of our local European audiovisual sector.\n\n​\n\nStrengthened by these lessons and animated by this European momentum, we call on Member States to be ambitious in order to answer to the enormous needs of our sector. We call on imposing an investment obligation of at least 25% of the turnover of these platforms, with at least 80% reserved for independent production companies, and a majority for local language production, to be allocated into European films and TV series. The fulfillment of these obligations must respect the rights of creators and producers and the payment of fair remuneration.\n\n​\n\nToday in France as the first EU country, under the patronage of the French president, intensive talks are taking place with all stakeholders, aimed at the precedent regulation of the place of streaming platforms in the European cultural landscape.\n\n​\n\nWe fully and firmly support the position of French authors, directors and producers, considering that these findings should serve as an example of solutions for all EU countries.\n\n​"
