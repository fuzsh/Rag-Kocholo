        "text": "A new true crime documentary dropped on Netflix last week, and it involves two Iowa women and a love triangle that unraveled into a case of deception, stalking and murder.\n\nIn \"Lover, Stalker, Killer,\" Dave Kroupa became romantically involved with Shanna “Liz” Golyar and Cari Farver in 2012. Golyar was from the Harrison County city Persia and Farver was from the Pottawattamie County city Macedonia, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFarver disappeared in November 2012 and was last seen in Omaha. Yet Kroupa received thousands of emails from her over the course of several years following her disappearance.\n\nBut he wasn’t the only person to be harassed by Farver. Golyar was too.\n\nIt seemed Farver was responsible for years of harassment and escalating criminal incidents that involved breaking into Kroupa and Golyar’s homes and arson.\n\nExcept in 2016, Golyar was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Farver and had apparently posed as the Macedonia woman online and by phone for years, the Associated Press reported.\n\nWho is Dave Kroupa?\n\nKroupa was newly single when he moved to Omaha, Nebraska in 2012 and met Golyar through an online dating website, according to Tudum, Netflix’s companion site. In an interview with People, Kroupa said he’d made it clear to Golyar that he was “not going to be tied down.” He maintained he wasn’t looking for anything serious when he met Farver, who seemed in agreement, according to People.\n\nWho is Shanna ‘Liz’ Golyar?\n\nIt appeared Golyar was also a victim of Farver, including when Golyar’s house was set on fire and led to the death of her pets, USA TODAY reported. Golyar was charged with first-degree murder and second-degree arson in 2016 and convicted on both accounts the following year, USA TODAY reported. Golyar is serving a life sentence at the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women, according to the state’s department of correctional services.\n\nMore: 'Lover, Stalker, Killer' star on Liz Golyar's cruelty: 'The level of cold-heartedness'\n\nWhat happened to Cari Farver?\n\nFarver stayed at Kroupa’s apartment on Nov. 12, 2012. The single mother wasn’t seen again when Kroupa left for work the next morning, according to People.\n\nShe hadn’t been seen for several years when James “Jim” Doty, a sergeant investigator with the Pottawattamie County Sheriff's Office in Council Bluffs, and his colleague, Deputy Ryan Avis, entered the case, USA TODAY reported. The pair traced all digital communications to Golyar, revealing that Golyar was responsible for an insidious case of impersonation and murder.\n\nDid they ever find Cari Farver's body?\n\nGolyar was convicted of murder in 2017, the Associated Press reported. At the time of her conviction, Farver's body had not been found.\n\nAt trial, Golyar's lawyer argued that prosecutors failed to present evidence that a homicide had even occurred. There was no evidence presented of a body, murder weapon or crime scene. But, Goylar was found guilty by a Nebraska judge in a non-jury trial.\n\nWhere can I watch ‘Lover, Stalker, Killer’?\n\n“Lover, Stalker, Killer” is available to stream on Netflix now. A standard plan with ads costs $6.99."
