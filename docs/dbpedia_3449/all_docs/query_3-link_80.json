        "text": "Entertainment One Films (eOne) will handle worldwide sales and distribution in all media and co-finance with Martin Katzs Prospero Pictures the upcoming thriller Maps to the Stars from award-winning director David Cronenberg. Production on the film will begin this July in Toronto and Los Angeles.\n\nThe film’s cast includes Julianne Moore, John Cusack, Robert Pattinson and Sarah Gadon.\n\n“We’re thrilled to secure worldwide sales rights for Maps to the Stars and add it to the lineup in four of our core territories,” said Patrice Théroux. “David is a visionary who continues to attract top talent with his unique style and the masterful quality of his filmmaking. With this all-star cast ‘Maps to the Stars’ is a very exciting international project and we’re looking forward to introducing the project in Cannes.\n\n“‘Maps to the Stars’ marks Prospero’s fourth collaboration with David over the past decade and together with our partners, we are delighted to be launching this audacious new film this year, particularly with eOne,” said Prospero Pictures founder and president, Martin Katz. “The eOne team just gets it and continues to showcase films at the highest levels on the international stage.”\n\nFrom a provocative original screenplay by noted Los Angeles author and screenwriter Bruce Wagner (Wild Palms), Maps to the Stars is both a haunting ghost story and a scathing attack on the celebrity-obsessed society of LA.\n\nThe film is being produced by Prospero Pictures’ Martin Katz together with SBS Productions’ Saïd Ben Saïd. Sentient Entertainment’s Renee Tab, Cronenberg’s manager, will executive produce. Integral Films’ Alfred Hurmer is co-producing.\n\neOne will directly distribute Maps to the Stars in the U.S., Canada, the UK and Australia/NZ. eOne Films International will sell the rest of the world. eOne’s Benedict Carver is executive producing and will oversee the film for the studio.\n\nKatz previously collaborated with Cronenberg on Spider, A Dangerous Method and Cosmopolis and was Executive Producer of Hotel Rwanda. Ben Said produced Carnage andPossession. Tab executive produced Cosmopolis and brought both A History of Violence and Eastern Promises to the filmmaker while representing him as an agent at ICM.\n\n(Photo Credit: WENN.com)"
