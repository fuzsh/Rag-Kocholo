The committees met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m., in room 2172 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Christopher H. Smith (chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations) presiding. Mr. Smith. The subcommittees will come to order. This is an important meeting of two subcommittees, the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations and the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. We are joined by our very distinguished chairman of that committee who is also chairman emeritus of the full committee and who has been absolutely, with a laser beam focus, looking at issues pertaining to and relating to Iran for the entirety of the last decade or more, so I want to thank her for her leadership. At our full committee hearing on Tuesday, the full Foreign Affairs Committee, I asked Secretary of State John Kerry whether he had raised Pastor Saeed Abedini's release during the Iranian nuclear talks. I read him the following advance excerpt of the testimony of Naghmeh Abedini, wife of Pastor Saeed Abedini, who is our very distinguished witness this morning, and as we all know, who remains imprisoned and subject to torture in Iran. And this is what she will say in pertinent part and this is what I had read to the Secretary of State: ``While I am thankful for President Obama's willingness to express concern about my husband and the other imprisoned Americans in Iran,'' she said, ``during his recent phone conversation with Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, I was devastated to learn that the administration didn't even ask for my husband's release when directly seated across the table from the leaders of the government that holds him captive.'' She went on to say, ``My husband is suffering because he is a Christian. He is suffering because he is an American. Yet, his own government, at least the executive and diplomatic representatives, has abandoned him. Don't we owe it to him as a nation to stand up for his human rights, for his freedom?'' Secretary Kerry acknowledged that he had not done that, he had not raised in the negotiations with the Iranians on the nuclear issue, confirming the awful report that Naghmeh had already heard. So as we speak, Pastor Abedini remains imprisoned in Iran, sharing a cell with violent criminals who have more than once surrounded Pastor Abedini as he tried to sleep, wielding knives and threatening his life. Pastor Saeed Abedini is an American citizen. He went to Iran last year to build an orphanage for Iranian children. He had been arrested in Iran before, but released and told he could enter and exit the country for humanitarian aid work if he agreed to cease pastoring house churches. As Pastor Abedini's wife, Naghmeh, will testify today, he accepted that proposal, but Iran did not uphold its end of the agreement. Pastor Abedini was arrested in July 2012, imprisoned, and tried for sharing his religious beliefs and thereby supposedly undermining the security of Iran. Imagine that, you share the good news of the Gospel and you threaten the security of Iran. But he was there to establish an orphanage. He was denied contact with his attorney until just before the trial. The trial was not public, and he and his attorney were barred from participating in key portions of the trial, following which a judge sentenced him to 8 years in prison. His appeals have been denied. In prison, he has been repeatedly beaten, denied medical care, and held in solitary confinement. While nuclear talks played out on the world stage, Iran moved Pastor Abedini to a prison notorious for housing the worst criminals in Iran. It is called Rajai Shahr. The very fact that Pastor Abedini was moved to a dangerous prison than the one he was at previously was certainly dangerous itself, in the middle of negotiations confirms that the Iranians recognized him as a potential factor in the negotiations. Since August 2012, the United States has reportedly released four Iranians, including most recently a high-ranking scientist, who were imprisoned in the U.S. for sanctions violations. Speaking for myself, I question whether these releases are unrelated to the nuclear talks. Were they allowed out in order to create a better atmosphere so the talks could go forward? And yet, American citizen Saeed Abedini remains in a hellhole prison in Iran. The U.S. Government must not waste another opportunity to secure the release of this brave and courageous father of two and devoted husband and a great pastor. His case needs to be front and center in the next round of U.S.-Iranian negotiations. Time is running out. Naghmeh, Rebecca, and Jacob need their husband and father home and they need him home now. I would like to yield to the distinguished gentlelady, the chairman of the other subcommittee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Well, thank you so much, Mr. Smith. We are blessed in Congress to have a leader of human rights with the passion, the intelligence of Chris Smith. We thank him for his on-going and relentless pursuit of liberty throughout the world and respect for human rights. And we are so honored also to look upon this beautiful portrait of our former Chairman Tom Lantos. And Chris Smith and Chairman Lantos were a great team. But he is still with us and we are so fortunate to have one of his daughters carrying on his work. And I would like to thank Ms. Abedini for joining us today. Our thoughts and our prayers are with you. They are with your family, your husband. And we commend you for your determination and perseverance to obtain his release. Last month our Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, and then the full Foreign Affairs Committee, as you know, unanimously passed House Resolution 147, calling on the Iranian regime to immediately release Pastor Saeed and condemning the regime's ongoing persecution of religious minorities. This resolution sends a strong message on behalf of Pastor Saeed, his family, and the Iranian people whose human rights suffer under this brutal and this bill states that we stand with them in solidarity and we will continue to press for Pastor Saeed's release, and it calls upon the Government of Iran to respect the rights of its citizens. Although we are here to discuss in particular the plight of Pastor Saeed, we must also highlight that there are other Americans languishing in Iran's prisons or being held captive by the regime, like South Florida resident and constituent of Congressman Ted Deutch, the ranking member of our subcommittee, and that is Bob Levinson. Last month, Bob became the longest- held American hostage in history, now in captivity in Iran for over 6 years. Earlier this week, I joined as a co-sponsor of House Resolution 435, introduced by Ranking Member Deutch, which calls for Iran's cooperation and immediate return of Bob Levinson. So we are here today because Rouhani's empty promises aren't only about Iran's nuclear programs, but about the reforms that he promised which have gone unfulfilled as the regime continues its policy of systematic and widespread suppression of human rights. On the campaign, Rouhani's charming words indicated that the regime will ease its repression of social freedoms and human rights. However, we must judge this regime not by its words, but by its actions, and in this regard, it has utterly failed. Since Rouhani took office, the rate of executions in Iran has sharply accelerated, with more than 300 executions carried out since August alone. And on September 2012, Pastor Saeed Abedini, an American citizen, was convicted on bogus charges and imprisoned after being accused by the regime of undermining national security. But his only so-called crimes were what? Working to establish an orphanage and practicing his Christian faith. He was supporting and ministering to churches in private homes, one of the only places in Iran where Christians and other religious minorities can practice their faith despite the fear of state persecution. In August, Pastor Saeed's unjust 8- year sentence was upheld, and last month, as we know, he was transferred to a brutal prison reserved for Iran's most violent criminals, where his life is in constant danger. Sadly, the plight of Pastor Saeed is not an isolated incident, but it is symptomatic of the Iranian regime's hostility toward religious minorities. In October, four Iranian Christians were sentenced to 80 lashes for drinking sacramental wine during communion, and this past summer an Iranian Christian convert was sentenced to 10 years in prison for distributing Bibles. And it is not just Christians who are persecuted, but others including Muslim minorities and reformers, who also suffer for their beliefs. For example, the Baha'i community is systematically targeted and persecuted by the regime, and more than 100 members of this community and its leadership are imprisoned. In fact, under Iranian law, Baha'i members can be killed with impunity. For these flagrant violations, the U.S. has designated Iran as Country of Particular Concern since 1999, a regime that does not respect the fundamental human rights of religious freedom. For many persons this is a central aspect of their identity and of their life. This a country that won't respect other freedoms. We saw this when the regime crushed the freedoms of speech and assembly during the Green Revolution of 2009, when the administration sadly missed a critical opportunity to express support for the Iranian people. I was a lead sponsor of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act that was signed into law last August, which expanded sanctions related to human rights abuses in Iran, and though the administration has selectively applied some of these sanctions, more needs to be done. We must enforce all of the sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes on regime officials responsible for committing human rights abuses. If the international community doesn't hold this regime accountable, no one will. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on how we can help bring Pastor Saeed home, reunite him with his wife and his children, where he belongs. I thank the chairman again for holding this important hearing. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much, Chairwoman Ileana Ros- Lehtinen for your very eloquent statement and again for your leadership on all things pertaining to Iran. Mr. Meadows? Mr. Meadows. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Madam Chairman for calling this hearing and I thank each of you for being here. And for some of you who we have had here before, thank you for fighting for those who many times don't have a voice. And so I have got an opening statement, but I am going to speak probably more from the heart instead of going to that. Right now, we are in a critical time. We have negotiations going on with a country that quite frankly is not built on a foundation of trust. We don't trust them. They don't trust us. And yet, here we are fundamentally dealing with an issue with Pastor Saeed Abedini and his detainment and imprisonment in a situation that we would find just deplorable. But more importantly, the message is not getting out because so many times when we think of people in prison, we think of them there for just cause and I had the opportunity to look into this in detail. And yet, here is a man who agreed with the intelligence ministry not to conduct a particular activity for many years ago, would be granted to be able to come back and forth and work to establish an orphanage that was sanctioned by the Iranian Government. And so here he was supposedly working with the government under their approval and yet, he is tried and convicted and put in prison, but really not even with due process. So we are embarking right now on a situation where we are working with a nation on something far greater than that with regards to a nuclear agreement. That can only be negotiated based on mutual respect and trust and yet the foundation of trust has been violated with this particular situation and it is not being rectified. Over 440 days without a husband and a father. How many more Christmases are going to come and pass where this injustice is not rectified? If there is any message that Foreign Minister Zarif and the Iranian Government, if they want to have a message of trust and mutual trust, this request of releasing this individual at a minimum would say we are trying to negotiate in good faith and it would send messages to the entire nation that they want to operate in good faith. And so I think the message needs to be that if they cannot release this individual and others held without due process, then how are we to trust them on much greater positions that have national and international consequences? I would ask Mr. Chairman that my full opening statement be submitted for the record, if possible. Mr. Smith. Mr. Meadows, thank you very much. The chair recognizes Mr. Chabot, the chairman of the Asia and Pacific Subcommittee. We have four subcommittee chairmen here today, again, a testament to the concern that is shared across the aisle and throughout the entire House of Representatives. Mr. Chabot. Mr. Chabot. Thank you. I will be brief. I commend Chairmen Smith and Ros-Lehtinen for holding this timely hearing today. In light of recent developments in U.S.-Iranian relations, the case of Pastor Saeed Abedini and his imprisonment raises very grave concerns. If Iran expects to engage in a more transparent and honest relationship with the U.S. and other members of the global community, it must cease its egregious human rights abuses and adopt standards practiced by most of the civilized world. I think my colleagues would agree that the imprisonment of Pastor Abedini is a prime example of Iran's use of abhorrent practices to deny human rights protections to its religious minorities. If the Obama administration is going to negotiate with Iran concerning economic sanctions, the release of Pastor Abedini must be a priority. It should have been a precondition of negotiations from the start. I yield back. Mr. Smith. Thank you, Chairman Chabot. Ranking Member Deutch. Mr. Deutch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. Thanks for hosting this hearing on Pastor Abedini, detained American citizens, and the broader human rights situation in Iran. I also want to thank our witnesses, especially Ms. Abedini for being here today. Please know that Congress is committed to bringing your husband and all three detained Americans home as soon as possible. Our legislature is divided on many issues, but I am proud to say that Congress has been and always will be united in its support for international religious freedom and for protecting Americans overseas. That is why I am proud to support legislation from Mr. Cassidy, that calls for the release of Pastor Abedini and condemns the Government of Iran for its persecution of religious minorities. At a time when Iran is seeking to reengage with the international community, its ongoing persecution of Pastor Abedini is utterly deplorable. His arbitrary arrest and the complete lack of due process is bad enough, but his transfer to a more dangerous prison that is filled with Iran's most violent criminals demonstrates why the United States must do everything in our power to end his continued and unjust imprisonment. Unfortunately, Pastor Abedini's persecution is just the latest in a string of appalling actions the Iranian regime has taken against American citizens. Mr. Amir Hekmati has also been unfairly detained in Iran for more than 2 years. And Iran is also suspected of having significant knowledge about the whereabouts of my constituent, Robert Levinson. As many of you know, in March 2007, Mr. Levinson was taken hostage while visiting Iran's Kish Island. A retired FBI agent, husband, father to seven children, and grandfather of two, Mr. Levinson has missed 6 years worth of birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and other milestones. November 26th was this 2,455th day in captivity, making him the longest held American hostage in our history. In response to his situation, this week my colleague and friend, Ms. Ros- Lehtinen and I introduced H. Res. 435 urging Iran's Government to cooperate in his case and return Mr. Levinson home to his family as soon as possible. Yet, Iran's egregious human rights record is not limited to American citizens, nor is its vile mistreatment of its people new. Iran routinely imposes severe restrictions on expression, association, and assembly. Political activists and human rights defenders are routinely and arbitrarily arrested. Torture is common and is committed with impunity. Women, religious and ethnic minorities and members of the LGBT community are all routinely persecuted. Since taking office, President Rouhani has spoken about the need to repair Iran's relationship with the world and to ensure the rights of his people. Unfortunately, this rhetoric has not been matched with action. Hundreds of political prisoners remain in prison including former presidential candidates, Mir- Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who recently spent their 1,000th day under house arrest. This year alone, more than 500 Iranians have been executed, yielding Iran's highest number of executions ever in a rate that doubles Ahmadinejad's last year in office. And in the past few months, there has been a stunning wave of repression targeting the media and civil society that included banning of a prominent reformist daily and the arrests of a number of prominent political actors. All of this shows that Iran continues to flagrantly violate basic human rights and is doing nothing to uphold Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of which it is a signatory, that guarantees the right to freedom, religion, conscience, and thought. While most of the world is focused on the nuclear deal with Iran, today provides a timely opportunity to remind the people of Iran that we stand with them in their quest for dignity and for freedom. Preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capabilities is our paramount objective, but it must not, it must not impact our support for human rights in Iran. We must continue to press Iran to treat their people with due process and we must act to ensure the release of all political prisoners including Pastor Abedini, Amir Hekmati, and Robert Levinson. This hearing is an important step in this process, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much, Mr. Deutch. Ms. Walorski, Congressman. Ms. Walorski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairman Ros- Lehtinen for allowing me to sit in on our committee today. I appreciate it. It is a very gracious offer. This case is one of great personal importance to me and I am grateful to all the witnesses for being here today. Ms. Abedini, my family and I pray for you every day and for your husband. My husband and I spent 4 years as missionaries in Eastern Europe involved in orphanage ministry as well and we appreciate your heart and can relate to your heart and we appreciate that. I am a co-sponsor of the resolution calling for your husband's release. I have signed on to multiple letters in his behalf and frankly, I am deeply embarrassed which is why I wanted to be able to come and sit in on this hearing today. Congress should not have to urge the administration to act in a case like this which involves the state sponsor of terrorism imprisoning an American citizen and I am deeply disappointed that the release was not a prerequisite for any Iranian peace deal. Once again, I would like to publicly urge our President and Secretary Kerry to do everything they can to secure the release of not only your husband, but the other Americans being held as well. I would also say that I am deeply, profoundly impacted by the increase in religious persecution under President Rouhani as we in this country so deeply value religious freedom and believe in religions free of persecution around the world that people should be able to hold their beliefs and be able to express their religious opinions as well. So I would just like to thank you for being here today and offer my support and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to graciously sit on your committee. Mr. Smith. Thank you, Ms. Walorski. The chair recognizes the gentlelady from New York, Ms. Meng. Ms. Meng. I would like to thank our subcommittee chairs and ranking members for calling today's important hearing. We must keep our attention on the persecution of Pastor Abedini and insist that our Government officials demand his release in all meetings they have with their Iranian counterparts. Each and every human life is precious and as Members of Congress, we have a particular duty to look out for our citizens who are persecuted and wrongly jailed in distant lands. The Ayatollahs in Iran must know where we stand and must know that we view their continued mistreatment of Pastor Abedini as indicative of a lack of good faith on a range of other issues. Here in Congress, we will do whatever is in our power to bring back your husband, Ms. Abedini, Amir Hekmati, and Robert Levinson back home to their families here in America. Thank you and I yield back. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much, Ms. Meng. I would like to recognize Chairman Frank Wolf, and just before I do, note that last March, Chairman Wolf as chairman of the Lantos Commission welcomed Ms. Abedini to the Congress and she made a point at that hearing that the State Department had said, ``There is nothing that they could do.'' Chairman Wolf's hearing was a catalyst for at least some engagement and some high-level response and I want to thank the chairman for that. And I would also note parenthetically that Dr. Swett is the vice chair of the Commission on International Religious Freedom. That commission was created by Mr. Wolf's bill, the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 and so we do have an expert here and a man who really made a huge difference and I recognize the chairman. Mr. Wolf. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no comments. I just wanted to welcome the witnesses and say hello to Ms. Abedini. Thank you very much. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much. I would like to now welcome our very distinguished witnesses, beginning first with Dr. Katrina Lantos Swett who is the vice chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent U.S. Government commission that monitors the universal rights to freedom of religion or belief abroad. She established the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice in 2008 and serves as its president and chief executive officer. This organization is proudly carrying on the unique legacy of her dad, the late Congressman Tom Lantos with whom many of us served and we are very, very honored to call him friend. She currently teaches human rights and foreign policy at Tufts University and has also worked on Capitol Hill as a consultant. We will then hear from Naghmeh Abedini, wife of Pastor Saeed Abedini. She is a U.S. citizen and was born in Iran and moved to the United States with her family when she was nine. Her husband Pastor Saeed Abedini, as we all know, is currently serving an 8-year sentence in the brutal Rajai Shahr prison in Iran. In 2002, in a visit to Tehran, Naghmeh met Saeed and began assisting him in his ministry to house churches in Tehran and they were married in 2004. She has been apart from her husband for more than a year as he remains imprisoned. They have two young children, Rebecca and Jacob, and no one has done more on behalf of any imprisoned person that I have ever seen, and I have been here 33 years, than this very devoted, and very articulate wife of Saeed Abedini. We will then hear from Mr. Jordan Seulow who is Pastor Abedini's attorney. He is the executive director of the American Center for Law and Justice. He is also the host of radio and television programs featuring elected officials. He oversees much of ACLJ's international work, engaging with government officials and international leaders on human rights issues around the world, including, and especially, religious freedom. We will then hear from Daniel Calingaert who is executive vice president at Freedom House where he oversees contributions to policy debate on democracy and human rights issues and outreach. He previously supervised Freedom House's civil society and media programs worldwide and contributes frequently to policy and media discussions on Internet freedom. Prior to joining Freedom House, Dr. Calingaert was associate director of the American University Center for Democracy and Election Management and associate director of the Commission on Federal Election Reform. He also served as director for Asia and as deputy director of Eastern Europe at the International Republican Institute. Dr. Swett, if you could begin. STATEMENT OF KATRINA LANTOS SWETT, PH.D., VICE CHAIR, U.S. COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM Ms. Lantos Swett. Thank you so much. It is always a great honor for me to appear before this committee and to have the chance to speak with some of the very distinguished colleagues of my late father, and of course, I am always mindful when I am here that I am testifying under his watchful eye and so I will try to be on good behavior. I also want to just say briefly what a privilege it is to testify with Ms. Abedini. She is a towering example of love and devotion and courage. And I just want to say to you that you will prevail in your wonderful mission to free your husband. I remember another beautiful young wife, Avital Sharansky, from another generation who tirelessly worked walking the halls of Congress and meeting with the media to press for freedom for her husband, Natan Sharansky, and she was ultimately successfully. You will be as well and we are all standing with you and behind you and next to you. I want to thank Representatives Smith and Ros-Lehtinen and your subcommittees for holding this hearing and inviting USCIRF to testify. With your approval, I will submit my written testimony for the record. Mr. Smith. Without objection, so ordered. Ms. Lantos Swett. Thank you. I commend your focus on the continued deterioration of religious freedom conditions in Iran, most notably for Christians and other religious minorities and for highlighting the egregious treatment of Pastor Saeed Abedini. USCIRF stands with Ms. Abedini and her family, has called repeatedly for the Pastor's release, and urges the U.S. Government at the highest levels to demand his release. Unfortunately, the appalling treatment of Pastor Abedini reflects the dismal reality of religious freedom and human rights in Iran today. The rights and beliefs defining the Iranian dictatorship's character remains self-consciously religious and inescapably theocratic. Any Iranian dissenting from the government's interpretation of Shia Islam may be considered the state's enemy and a potential target for abuse. Because religion matters significantly to Iran's Government, we must look at how the government treats the right to religious freedom to assess the overall status or direction of human rights. That lends also as necessary to evaluate Iran's current President, Hassan Rouhani. The number of Christians and Baha'is jailed during his short tenure has increased and a crackdown on Protestant Christians has brought numerous arrests. In June 2009, Iran reached a watershed moment when after a national election, citizens protested the legitimacy of its outcome. Tehran responded with brutal repression. Since then, human rights and religious freedom conditions have worsened to levels unseen since the early years after the '79 revolution. The United States, since 1999, annually, has designated Iran a Country of Particular Concern or CPC. Its government continues to rank among the world's worst religious freedom abusers engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations. Members of religious minorities, including Baha'is or Zoroastrians, Christians, Jews, Muslims belonging to minority Sufi and Sunni sects, and even Muslims part of Iran's Shia majority have had their fundamental rights abused. Among Iran's minority religious communities, the Baha'is long have been subject to particularly severe religious freedom abuses. Besides its severe mistreatment of Baha'is, Iran's Government discriminates against and represses Christians. While all of Iran's Christians face the regime that restricts their rights, Tehran reserves particularly harsh treatment for Protestant Christians. Next to Baha'is authorities view the Protestant community as the most serious competitor of the theocratic government for Iranians' hearts and minds. Iranian Christians, including Protestants, constitute less than 1 percent of Iran's 75 million citizens and it reflects the fundamental weakness and insecurity of the regime that they should consider them such a threat. Unlike Iran's ethnic Christian population, the vast majority of Iran's Protestants are converts from Islam. While conversion is a fundamental freedom that international law and covenants guarantee, Iran's Government views conversion from Islam as an act against Islam and Iran's character as an Islamic state, in other words, as an act of apostasy, punishable by death. Revolutionary Courts also charge converts with political crimes such as acting against national security or contact with a foreign enemy. Hundreds of Christians, mostly Protestants, have been arbitrarily arrested and detained. The U.N. special rapporteur's October report found that since 2010 more than 300 Christians have been arrested and detained. As of July, at least 20 Christians were detained or imprisoned. In a particularly outrageous miscarriage of justice, Judge Pir- Abassi, notorious for perpetrating religious freedom violations sentenced Saeed Abedini, an Iranian-born American pastor on January 27, 2013 to 8 years in prison for ``threatening the national security of Iran.'' His crimes? Participating in Iran's house church movement and raising money for an orphanage. Human rights groups view his trial, like those of other condemned, as unfair and the legal process deeply flawed. He spent many weeks in solitary confinement and suffered mental and physical abuse while at Evin Prison. Last month, Pastor Abedini was transferred to the Gohardasht Prison outside Tehran which is known for its harsh and unsanitary conditions. Below are selected USCIRF recommendations. Others and more detailed ones can be found in our written testimony. First, the U.S. Government should continue to designate Iran as a Country of Particular Concern. Second, Congress should reauthorize for multiple years, and the President should sign into law, the Lautenberg amendment which has provided a lifeline for Iranian religious minorities. Third, the U.S. at the highest level should call on the Iranian Government to release all prisoners who have been jailed due to their religion or belief and drop all charges against those with pending cases, including, and I hope you will bear with me as I show the pictures of these individuals, because we must never forget, these are real flesh and blood human beings who are being persecuted. So those we call upon to be released are Saeed Abedini, Farshid Fathi, Benham Irani, Vahid Hakkani, and there are too many others of these Christians, but some of them are noted in my written testimony. Among the Shia Muslims who are persecuted, Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeni Boroujerdi, the Baha'i Seven including Fariba Kamalabadi and Mahvash Sabet, the Baha'i educators, Faran Hesami and Riaz Sobhani; and finally, the Sufi activist, Hamid-Reza Moradi. USCIRF encourages representatives and this is really directed at each one of you, to join the Defending Freedoms Project, an initiative of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in conjunction with USCIRF and Amnesty International. Members adopt a prisoner of conscience and advocate on their behalf and shine a light on the conditions in the country and the government that imprisons them. The U.S. Government should continue to identify Iranian Government agencies and officials responsible for particularly severe violations of religious freedom, bar them from entry into the U.S. and freeze their assets. My written testimony notes nine individuals, including the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Just last week, national security advisor, Susan Rice, reaffirmed the administration's commitment to continue to sanction Iran's human rights abusers. We welcome further action by the Treasury and State Departments, especially given that the European Union has far outpaced the United States in identifying and sanctioning these violators. Iran's religious freedom abuses demand the world's attention and action, especially given that the Iranian Government may use efforts to resolve the nuclear issue to divert attention from the increasing mistreatment of Christians and other religious minorities. We cannot let that happen. If Pastor Abedini and religious minorities in Iran ever needed a voice to condemn Iran's abusive practices it is now. The Obama administration and Members of Congress should insist that Iran demonstrate its commitment to peaceful intentions abroad by ceasing its war at home against its own people and their fundamental rights including the right of freedom of religion or belief. Thank you and I look forward to answering your questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Lantos Swett follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- Mr. Smith. Dr. Swett, I just want to thank you very much for your testimony and for bringing additional focus on all of the other imprisoned individuals who are there because of their faith. Ms. Abedini, it is a high honor and privilege to welcome you to the two subcommittees. STATEMENT OF MS. NAGHMEH ABEDINI, WIFE OF PASTOR SAEED ABEDINI Ms. Abedini. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittees. My name is Naghmeh Abedini. I have submitted my full statement for the record and I would like to use this time to tell the story of our family and ask for your assistance. Mr. Smith. Without objection, your and all the witnesses' full statements and any papers you would like to attach to the record will be made a part of the record. Ms. Abedini. Thank you. When I spoke in front of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in March of this year, I had anticipated that I would battle the Iranian Government for my husband's freedom. I never anticipated that I would also have to battle my own Government and that the journey would become even much more difficult than it had been. My husband is suffering because he is a Christian. He is suffering because he is an American. Yet, his own government did not fight for him when his captors were across the table from them. Saeed converted from Islam to Christianity in the year 2000 after having a radical encounter with Jesus and in that encounter Jesus Christ told Saeed that he was coming back soon and to go preach the Gospel. And from there his life was transformed and if he would sit here to testify today, he would say he found true joy, love, and peace that he could not find in his former religion. So today, Saeed sits in that Iranian prison being tortured for his faith. He will not deny the faith that has saved him, that his given him life. He refuses to deny his faith in Jesus and return to Islam. When the Iranian Government sentenced him to 8 years in prison in January of this year, they went back to the years 2000 and 2005, the year of his conversion and the year where the house churches were started and he was working under a more moderate government. Khatami was the name of the President previous before President Ahmadinejad. And at that time, he was working under the supervision of a government- approved building church. The Iranian Government was well aware of the house church movement and was allowing it. So for them to have arrested him in the year 2012 when he was working with the Iranian Government on a government-approved orphanage and to say that his crime dated back to 13 years earlier when he was working under a different administration, under a different President, was unbelievable. And to say that he was undermining the national security of Iran by having started those house churches, Christian gatherings, and in the court hearing, they actually said he conducted soft war. It is unbelievable that they would consider peaceful gatherings of Christians an act of war. As many of you who have mentioned today, Saeed has been tortured. He has been beaten, abused, and told to deny his Christian faith and that if he would return to Islam, he would be freed. He has been in that prison, and the kids and I have not seen him since June of last year, but he has been sitting in Evin Prison since September. And recently last month, he was moved to Rajad Shahr Prison where his condition has worsened and the kids and I fear for his life. I want to share a little bit of a personal story here. This is the first day of school. It was a very painful time. I am trying to smile. But tears were streaming down my face as I got my two kids ready for school, knowing that their dad was missing. And as I took them to school, I could see their wandering eyes looking at other daddies holding their kids and putting them to school. And I was trying to distract them, but it was a painful time for them to know that their daddy was missing and it was a painful time for me. It has been hard. It has been a struggle as a mom watching as my 7-year-old and my 5-year-old cry themselves to sleep every single night for the last 444 days. And knowing that unless we get Saeed out quickly, he might serve the 8 years, or even more, or he might not even survive that prison sentence. He wrote a recent letter to my daughter on her seventh birthday and he had seen a picture of her and his parents when they visit him in prison, they say that when they hold the pictures of the kids in front of him, he just cries. And he wrote in a letter, he said, ``It is so hard and so heartbreaking for me to see these pictures and to know that I am not there beside you as you grow. I came here to help the kids that did not have mommies and daddies, but my own kids lost their daddy. This breaks my heart so much. I want you to know that I did not want to put so my pressure on your little shoulders, my precious children.'' While I am grateful for the official declaration to national media and public acknowledgment from our Government, it is not enough. We need to see action to back our rhetoric in the living breathing form of Saeed Abedini, alive and well, having been immediately released to the reuniting embrace of our family. Not all Americans are Christians, but every American regardless of their belief, needs to be reassured and know that our Government will take decisive action to protect us if our fundamental rights are violated. An American President who has taken his oath of office with honorable intention and is attuned to the international issues will recognize Iran's treatment of Saeed for the assault that it is on our national security. For Iran's treatment of Saeed Abedini is not about one American citizen experiencing a living nightmare for his religious belief. Iran's treatment of Saeed Abedini is an experiment. Iran is curious. How strong is our American President? How serious is he about American security? Would he act immediately with firm resolve to protect and to defend? Time is of the essence. Iran's experiment for evaluating the integrity of Americans' response to assault on her security is almost complete. And Iran is not the only country watching our reaction. Even if our President can't see the reality, the rest of the world can. In the interest of Americans' confidence in the competency of her government officials, her national security and international standing, Saeed Abedini needs to be released now. I want to say that I can't express how grateful I am to the Members of Congress who have refused to let my husband be forgotten. And I would like to end with as we approach Christmas, it is a joyful time of the year, but it is a painful time for our family to celebrate another year without my husband. I want to end with this, Saeed is in that prison because he believes ``unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government will be upon his shoulder. His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.'' And this season, I not only pray for the release of my husband, but I hope and I pray that our Government would realize where we have fallen from and how far we have fallen and that we would return to the source of blessing. May God bless America, the land that I love. Thank you. God bless you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Abedini follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- Mr. Smith. Ms. Abedini, thank you so very much for those powerful words and that testimony causes every one of us to redouble our efforts to do everything possible to ensure that your husband is released immediately, so thank you so very much. Mr. Sekulow. STATEMENT OF MR. JORDAN SEKULOW, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE Mr. Sekulow. Chairman Smith and Chairman Ros-Lehtinen, the ranking member Deutch, the other co-chairs and chairs of subcommittees that are here today, and members of the subcommittees, I am deeply honored to present this report on behalf of Pastor Saeed and Naghmeh Abedini as their attorney, as an organization that represents them and their two children. They are American children, Rebecca and Jacob. My primary purpose for submitting this testimony is to impress upon Congress the desperate need for great urgency as Pastor Saeed is in a dire predicament. Congress has done more than any branch of government. Congress has been there. And it has been bipartisan. First, let me begin by thanking you and your staffs for having this hearing and we started back in March at the Lantos Commission and now here. Months later, the United States, in an unprecedented move that we did not predict or could not predict then, is now sitting with Iran. And it is important for us to point out right now that we don't see this religious liberty at all as a partisan issue. So I want to recognize that the unbelievable bipartisan efforts that have occurred within this Congress on behalf of Pastor Saeed Abedini we don't forget that and when we speak out on Saeed's behalf and if we are critical of the administration, we always make sure to mention that there has been that bipartisan support. I am hopeful that today's hearing will highlight the commitment to this case that so many of you have shown and the world will hear the U.S. Government speaking with one voice. It is so clear, one voice, in strong defense of our fellow citizen Pastor Saeed Abedini, at such a critical juncture with the U.S. Government literally sitting across the table from Iran. We could never have imagined that would occur when we first testified before the Lantos Commission in March. At the table, for the first time in 34 years. We need to ensure that Pastor Saeed and the other Americans mentioned here today, wrongfully detained, are seen as not a marginal issue, but an essential, of those ongoing diplomatic talks. Pastor Saeed Abedini, a U.S. citizen, has been unnecessarily separated from his wife, Naghmeh and two children for 17 months, 444 days. The Islamic Republic of Iran has arbitrarily detained and imprisoned Pastor Saeed, subjecting him to violence and abuse, violating both Iranian law and international norms. His trial lacked transparency and due process and yet appeals courts in Tehran upheld his conviction, an 8-year prison sentence. Pastor Saeed has exhausted all legal remedies in Iran to appeal this arbitrary conviction and his detention. His freedom now rests solely on the success of diplomatic efforts by the United States Government and world leaders dedicated to human rights. Now Naghmeh has outlined the time line of Saeed's case in a more detailed outline as in my submitted remarks. Allow me to briefly highlight just a couple of more egregious facts about the legal proceedings. First, Saeed was detained arbitrarily and while conducting humanitarian work with the full approval of the Iranian Government. Next, Saeed was imprisoned and subjected to solitary confinement, without even being informed about the charges against him. Third, Saeed was informed of the official charges against him less than a week before his sham trial and denied access to his attorney until less than 24 hours before that trial. Finally, Saeed and his attorney were barred from attending the second half of the trial. The half in which ``key witness testimony'' was taken, thereby denying his legal team the ability to question or even know who those witnesses were. Predictably, this resulted in Saeed's conviction, an 8-year prison sentence on January 27, 2013. Judge Pir-Abassi, who presided over Pastor Saeed's trial, has earned the nickname the hanging judge. Despite the fact that Judge Pir-Abassi has been individually sanctioned by the European Union and that the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom under the chair of Ms. Swett and also now vice chair, has repeatedly made a similar recommendation to the United States Department of State. To date, the U.S. has failed to place any sanctions on Judge Pir-Abassi. The EU has acted. The United States has not. You heard from Naghmeh about the horrific prison conditions that Saeed is enduring, that he is being denied basic medical care and that he has been transferred to a much more difficult prison than Evin Prison. See, this is Rajai Shahr Prison, built for 5,000 violent criminals, real criminals, murderers, rapists, drug dealers, people convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison. Built for 5,000 inmates, it is currently housing approximately 22,000. It is a prison out of control with violence. To define the situation as inhumane would be a gross understatement. In addition to the horrific abuse and torture Pastor Saeed has faced at the hands of his own brutal Iranian captors, Pastor Saeed has not always had the full backing of his own government. And I want to be clear here, I mean the executive branch. Members of Congress have been with us on both sides, Republican and Democrat, since the beginning. When the Iranian Government initially detained Pastor Saeed, the U.S. State Department excused its lack of assistance on the fact that the U.S. lacked any diplomatic ties with Iran. That doesn't work any more. So now when the U.S. has historically communicated with, sits across from the table of the Iranian Government, the U.S. Government has still failed to secure the release of Pastor Saeed and the other Americans in prison. As Naghmeh pointed out, this Congress has spoken with strength and unity on behalf of Pastor Saeed and we are grateful that President Obama expressed his concern about the Americans imprisoned in Iran on his historic phone call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani back in September. But as you all know, as Members of Congress, as principals, if there is no follow up to your discussion, little gets done. Everyone has a lot to do. And you have staff, you have staff that you rely to make sure what you have agreed to on phone calls or said you will do is done. Yet, 2 days ago, Secretary of State Kerry sat at this table and to you Chairman Smith, he said that this matter is a priority for him. But numerous statements from his Department claim that Saeed was either not brought or only discussed on the margins. For us, you can understand the incompetence. Was he brought up? Was he on the margins? If you look at Secretary Kerry's statements to you, Chairman Smith, it is very difficult to tell. He made a pretty broad statement of no. But you have had others including those who were even going before their hearings in the Senate for confirmation yesterday tell Senator Rubio that he was brought up on the margins of the P5+1. So who is telling the truth? We were told he was by the State Department. But then when Secretary Kerry testified and there are other statements we can point to as well, the Deputy National Security Advisory Tony Blinken said on CNN to Wolf Blitzer, no, it was not, it was not part of the agenda. But yet, the National Security Council spokesperson Ben Rhodes later that day on CNN said it was on the margins. On the margins is bad enough, not at all is even worse. We don't know which one of those to believe. And that is why we believe, Mr. Chairman, that that offer from Secretary Kerry to hold that classified briefing for Members of Congress should be absolutely acted upon and we would welcome the opportunity to provide you with the kind of questions and information that we have received from the State Department so that you can get the answers and we can hear back from you at least to know whether you are satisfied with what we believe is our Government's incompetence. Let me just close by expressing my gratitude to both subcommittees for taking an active role in Pastor Saeed's case. And just to highlight again that while our Government sat across the table from the Iranian delegation, Saeed was transferred to a worse prison. Was it on the margins or was it not on the agenda? That is an answer we need from the United States executive branch and from the Obama administration. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Sekulow follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Sekulow, and we will indeed follow up with that classified briefing. I, and I know everyone else who is concerned about Pastor Abedini, will be raising this issue repeatedly going forward at every venue where we have an interface with the administration because there was a sense of conflicting information even as the Secretary of State spoke. So thank you for your testimony and for being an excellent lawyer on behalf of Mr. Abedini. Mr. Calingaert. STATEMENT OF DANIEL CALINGAERT, PH.D., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, FREEDOM HOUSE Mr. Calingaert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Madam Chairman, honorable members. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today. I want to thank you for your leadership in championing the case of Pastor Abedini and pressing for his release. Sadly, the kinds of abuses that he suffers are all too common in Iran. During the campaign for the Presidency of Iran, Hassan Rouhani repeatedly promised to release all political prisoners and to make a change in favor of free speech and media freedom. The record of his first 4 months in office shows otherwise. He has yet to live up to these promises. Fifteen prominent political prisoners were released in September, but approximately 800 dissidents including human rights defenders, journalists, and political activists remain unjustly detained in Iran. The leaders of the Green Movement, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, Mehdi Karroubi, and Zahra Rahnavard are still under house arrest. While some limited space has opened up for women's rights activists, the overall situation for human rights in Iran is as grim under President Rouhani as it was before. In the past few weeks, Iran's Interior Ministry and Revolutionary Guards have carried out a new wave of arrests to stifle free expression. At least 38 people were arrested, including editors and staff of a technology Web site, Narenji, and activists in the Province of Kerman who were accused of receiving foreign assistance to produce online content that undermines the Islamic regime. These arrests come on the heels of a December 3rd court ruling that exonerated government officials accused of murdering Sattar Beheshti, a blogger who was detained by the Iranian cyber police, and was later found dead in his jail cell with bruises on his body. Iran is second only to China in the number of executions it carries out. This year, 668 reported executions have already taken place. Virtually all capital cases lack internationally recognized standards of due process and death sentences are often imposed for relatively minor crimes such as drug possession. The Iranian regime, dominated by Shiite clerics and Revolutionary Guard commanders is highly repressive. It systematically tramples political and civil rights. In Freedom House's annual report on freedom in the world, Iran receives a rating of six on a scale of one to seven, where seven is the lowest score. The election of Rouhani was welcomed by some in Iran and abroad because he was the least conservative of the candidates, but his election was anything but fair. Over 600 candidates had registered to run in that election, but only 6 names appeared on the ballot and who made that decision? The Guardian Council, 12 Islamic clerics and jurists, not the voters. The media environment in Iran is among the most restrictive in the world. Iran ranks 191st out of 197 countries in Freedom House's annual ratings on media freedom. The government directly controls all television and radio broadcasting and print media, blogs, and news Web site are severely censored. Restrictions on online space are equally, if not more severe. In the latest edition of Freedom House's rankings on Internet freedom which covered 60 countries, Iran came in the very last place. With all that is at stake in the negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program, there is a temptation to put aside human rights issues because they might complicate the negotiations. But that would be a mistake. Speaking out for human rights in Iran as elsewhere both reflects U.S. values and serves U.S. interests and it can be done at the same time as we negotiate on nuclear matters. The Iranian people's aspirations for greater freedom are abundantly clear. They were expressed in the votes for Rouhani and his promises for change and they were seen in a recent Zogby poll that showed issues of political reform trumped other concerns. The Iranian regime stifles free expression because the citizens are expressing a desire for political change. They want to modernize their country, to exchange opinions freely, and to become open to the rest of the world. An Iranian Government that is more attuned to the views of its own citizens will be less hostile toward the United States and more constructive in its foreign relations. When faced with international criticism of its human rights abuses, the Iranian Government invariably is defiant, but it does listen. International pressure has, for example, led to the release of former political prisoners such as Maziar Bahari, Roxana Saberi, and most recently in September Nasrin Sotoudeh. One thing is certain, the Iranian Government's record on human rights does not improve when the United States stays silent. The United States can put human rights high on the agenda with its adversaries at the same time as it addresses other sensitive and complex issues. The Reagan administration kept human rights on the agenda while negotiating nuclear arms treaties with the Soviet Union. President Clinton spoke out about the struggle for individual freedom at Beijing University during a state visit in 1998 and still held constructive talks with Chinese Government leaders on a range of security and economic issues. Iranians who want to change their country for the better understand that the struggle for freedom is their struggle. They have to stand up for their rights and demand that their government listen to them. But Iranians notice what we in the United States say and don't say. When we stay silent, we send the message that we don't care about their struggle for freedom and that message is disheartening for Iranians today and it will hurt our credibility with them for a long time to come. The United States needs to put human rights on its agenda with the Government of Iran. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Calingaert follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- Mr. Smith. Mr. Calingaert, thank you very much for your testimony and for your historical perspective as well. As you were speaking, it called to mind the point Dr. Lantos Swett made about Natan Sharansky and his wife who worked tirelessly for his release. Chairman Wolf and I were actually in Perm Camp 35, the infamous prison where Sharansky had been incarcerated, just a few months after he was released. Obviously, many other political prisoners were still there, but the lesson learned from the way we handled human rights with the Soviet Union was that you integrate them, you never stovepipe them. We risked superpower confrontation with a country that was wrestling with nuclear weapons aimed at the United States because we put human rights and the value of human life at such a high level. When Secretary Schultz would visit Moscow, and my first trip to the Soviet Union was in '82 on behalf of Soviet Jewish refusniks, he would always meet with all the dissidents and then meet with the Soviets as well. There was never this stovepiping, this separation, this doing something in another room. And I think you are a reminder of that, Mr. Calingaert. And you did it was well, Mr. Sekulow, you all did, frankly. Because I am very concerned, especially of the response to the question I asked of the Secretary just 2 days ago that and the different versions that we have gotten from other people within the administration. Was it discussed or not? And it would seem if it was discussed at all, it was on the margins, but it should have been center stage. Every conversation we had with the Iranians should have begun with Saeed Abedini and ended with Saeed Abedini. How can we trust the Iranians' signature on a piece of paper if they so callously mistreat not only their own human rights defenders, but if they take pastors like Saeed Abedini, an American, and not only incarcerate him, but as you pointed out, Mr. Sekulow, at the very time when these negotiations are happening, transfer him from one terrible prison to an infamous prison where he is even at greater risk. That was a message sender that seemed to have been missed by the U.S. Department of State and by the administration. And I would agree with all of you who made it very clear, there is no partisanship here. I can tell you having been here 33 years, when we unite in human rights in Congress, no matter who is in the White House, it is all about standing up for the victims and others, their families, like Ms. Abedini and making sure we speak out very loudly and very clearly. We are not in those negotiations face-to-face with, in this case, the Iranians, so again I think your message here today that this has to be integrated, mainstreamed, and not stovepiped is very clear because I, too, like others on this panel, think about and pray about Pastor Abedini every single day. So thank you for reminding us just how important that this is. So the integration issue is very important. If I could ask very quickly, Dr. Lantos Swett, you have asked as a commission that under Section 105 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions and Disinvestment Act that certain Iranian officials be censured because of their mistreatment based on religious persecution. If I could also just ask, when you said, Mr. Sekulow, that Pastor Saeed has exhausted all legal remedies, who now makes the decision? It really does come down to a negotiation with the United States, doesn't it? They have to know that the value is sufficiently high that the relationship with Iran hinges, the tipping point, is how well or how poorly going forward they treat Pastor Abedini. And finally, your statement, Ms. Abedini, was very bold, when you called on the President to reengage, when you called on the Secretary of State to reengage and when you said ``please don't let this case be discussed on the margins and please make his case a priority.'' There will be more negotiations and I think the sooner that reengagement occurs, the better. If you would want to elaborate on that as well. Dr. Lantos Swett? Ms. Lantos Swett. Well, we think that the application of sanctions directed at specific people implicated in human rights and religious freedom abuses is incredibly important. It is part of a long tradition, successful tradition of the human rights movement in general to name and shame and blame, to identify, to pin responsibility on those responsible. And so it really is critically important and the fact is there has been a lot of discussion about President Rouhani's charm offensive, but when we look at what is actually going on in Iran under his leadership, it is actually more offensive than it is charming, particularly again as it relates to religious freedom violations. And so we feel very, very strongly that that step of our Government officially saying you are not welcome here, if you have assets here, they will be frozen, they will be put beyond your reach, those sorts of concrete steps. Send that message, that you are not a political leader, engaging in respectful and appropriate sort of leadership in your country. You are someone who is personally implicated in vile abuses of the human rights of your citizens. We know it. We are saying it and by doing so the rest of the world knows it as well. Ms. Abedini. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In my statement when I discussed that Saeed cannot be left in the margins, I believe that if we do not speak out, if we do not put him at the center stage, then we are sending the world the wrong message about where we stand in terms of human rights issues. We are sending it to Iran, but especially in the Middle East, with the high increase of persecution of the Christians and religious minorities, I believe by putting Saeed as just not a person, it is where we stand, where we put our value in terms of human rights issues. And I think it is very dangerous. Americans are watching our Government to see what we will do and the world is watching to see where we stand in terms of important human rights issues such as religious freedom which has been an important value since this country was founded. So I believe that leaving it at the margins is very dangerous and is sending a very dangerous message to the world. Mr. Smith. Thank you. Mr. Sekulow. Mr. Chairman, I would assert again as in my opening statement, the ineptness of the State Department's relationship with Ms. Abedini. She is represented not just by us but ultimately by the U.S. Government who is sitting at that table. And I will tell you that in conversations with them, they ask us to keep confidential and they ask us to--what updates they are doing around the world. For instance, I will point out something that was news to us. I don't know if Secretary Kerry misspoke when he mentioned the Swedish, but they have never been mentioned to us on any phone calls and there are countries that have. That is not one of them. He may have misspoke, but that would be something to clear up. We have also been told on those phone calls, now this is by lower-level staff, mostly NEA, so the Near East Affairs Department of State, it was absolutely being brought up on the margins. So why would Secretary Kerry have been so broad in that statement that it was not? And then third and finally, the idea that bringing them up would make them hostages or pawns, I would beg to differ and state that Mr. Abedini as well as Mr. Hekmati and Mr. Levinson already are pawns and they already are hostages of Iran. They are American citizens being held by a foreign government. We are sitting at the table with them. Some have been hostages for nearly 7 years, 2 years, or 444 days. They are already at that point. Thank you. Mr. Smith. I would just conclude before yielding to Mr. Deutch that 2 days ago on December 10th, along with Congressman, Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, I chaired a hearing on Coptic Christians and for me it was my fourth hearing in 2 years on Coptic Christians. And many of us fought very hard to get language into the foreign operations appropriations bill that conditioned United States aid, it is properly conditioned on the Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement at Camp David, but we said that on religious freedom, there ought to be conditionality there as well. We got into the foreign operations bill. Mrs. Clinton waived it as the Coptic Christians were being slaughtered, churches decimated, monasteries, many of them hundreds of years old. We looked askance and embraced Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood. It was appalling. And one of the issues that I raised repeatedly again, I think what Ms. Abedini is doing, one of the side issues that will help all others, is pointing out a huge deficiency. Many Coptic Christian girls have been abducted and forced into Islamic marriages. We had a woman who actually did the reporting on it, she is a noted human rights investigator, bring this information forward. And the administration did nothing on it. And that is very disturbing. So there is a larger backdrop issue of disregard for religious freedom issues that has to change and it has to start with Pastor Abedini. Mr. Deutch? Mr. Deutch. I thank the chairman. I have a couple of questions for Dr. Lantos Swett and Dr. Calingaert. Let me start by just telling Ms. Abedini that there is a real commitment by Congress to bring your husband home and there is a real commitment by the entire Government, including the administration to bring your husband home. I didn't come to this hearing this morning to apologize or come to the defense of the administration, but I would respectfully suggest that as we address these human rights issues, the best way for us to address them, starting with your husband and his release is to work in a unified fashion to do it. I don't believe, Mr. Sekulow, that it is helpful for us in this hearing for the hearing to turn on allegations of incompetence and ineptitude by the administration. I just wanted to make that point. I look forward to the classified briefing that we are going to have with Secretary Kerry and others. I can only speak to the briefings with respect to my constituent and I know discussions that we have had on a broader level about human rights, I would just respectfully suggest that there is a real commitment to bringing home--I am sympathetic. I understand your frustration. I don't blame you 1 minute for the immense difficulty and the sadness that you feel every day that your husband is not with you and your family. That commitment as we have all expressed here is very real. Let me just ask Dr. Lantos Swett and Dr. Calingaert a question about not just what happens here in the United States and in this Congress and the administration, but more broadly internationally. First, the Lautenberg amendment here saved the lives of many religious minorities in Iran. But multi- laterally, since--well, every year since 2002, we have worked with the Canadians on the U.N. resolution condemning Iran's human rights record. In 2011, we successfully led an effort to create a Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran. But regardless of what happens and this is the frustration a lot of us feel, regardless of what happens on the nuclear profile, it appears that human rights, since the human rights situation doesn't change, and my question is, even as we are working tirelessly focused on individual cases, starting with Pastor Abedini, how do we expand this? What is the next big step that we can take either domestically or through the United Nations to raise awareness of human rights? Dr. Calingaert, you talked about making human rights matter in Iran for the United States. What is the next big step we can take for the United States to lead, for this Congress to lead, to make human rights really matter internationally? Dr. Lantos Swett, please. Ms. Lantos Swett. Well, it is a critical question, one that I think those involved in the human rights movement grapple with on an on-going basis. But I do think a central part of the answer to that question is that human rights, religious freedom have to be elevated in the public discourse. At the end of the day, we have limited ability to force other governments to do things that we want them to do, but we do have the power still as the world's indispensable nation to raise the profile of their wrongdoing, to make it extraordinarily uncomfortable and unpleasant and unwelcoming for them in the community of civilized nations. And we have to do that. I do think the whole situation with the efforts to reach agreement on Iran's nuclear program is an extraordinary window of opportunity and shame on us if we miss it. I think a lot of people have observed that with sanctions crippling, painful biting sanctions that ultimately brought Iran to the table. Undoubtedly, it was the unspoken threat of military action whether on the part of Israel or other players that have also brought them to the table. So it is vulnerability to some degree on Iran's part that has broken ground in that arena. That vulnerability needs to be exploited, not merely to achieve progress on the nuclear front, but to achieve progress on the human rights front. That vulnerability speaks to the internal situation in Iran specifically. We know that the Iranian people are chafing under the regime that they are living under. And so I very, very strongly believe that we should not let this moment of opportunity slip by. It is as if you had somebody in your neighborhood, as it were, who was a notorious drug dealer, as well as a notorious abuser of their children and their spouse. Well, the drug dealing sort of involves spreading a poison and danger out into the broader community. That would sort of be the nuclear side of what worries us about Iran. The abuse within their home would relate to the human rights issues that are of concern to us. I don't think any of us would be content to say well, for the moment they stopped dealing drugs, so we are good. We are done, you know? Mission accomplished. We would insist that we pursue, in whatever avenues were appropriate, stopping that abuse within the house and I think that that needs to be the approach that we take as a government. Mr. Deutch. Dr. Calingaert, do you have thoughts on how to elevate the issue? Mr. Calingaert. Yes, Mr. Deutch. I very much agree that it is important to address these issues multi-laterally. And I like your starting point, the U.N. Special Rapporteur, his efforts and the resolutions that Canada and the U.S. have pushed are very significant because first of all they put all countries on record where they stand in regard to Iran's human rights abuses and in that process they show that the concern about Iran's human rights record extends far beyond the United States and Western Europe, that there are countries around the world that think that Iran's record is shameful. I think there are many steps that can be taken by the U.S. in cooperation with other democratic governments. I don't think there is any sort of big breakthrough to be had, but I think it is important to push this issue in all these ways on a consistent basis. So even starting with the U.N. Special Rapporteur, he has been trying simply to get access to the country, to be able to have an official visit. I think it is important to keep pushing for that. His mandate will come up and it is important to renew that mandate so that he can continue his important work. The collaboration with the European Union is important from the examples of sanctions that Dr. Lantos Swett mentioned and also bringing attention to individual cases. One of the political prisoners that was released in September, Nasrin Sotoudeh, was a recipient of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize. I don't think that is a coincidence. The fact that there was major attention given to her case put pressure on the Iranian Government to release her. And that is why I think it is important to push on individual cases. It seems like a tough slog, obviously, even the releases are pretty few when you consider there are still 800 dissidents in detention. And many of them aren't known. But for even the few that are released, it sends an important signal to those who are still struggling for human rights on the ground, that there is hope and especially that the outside world cares about their efforts. Mr. Deutch. Thank you. Mr. Sekulow. If I could, Mr. Chairman, respond to one of Congressman Deutch's statements. The incompetence has not been at the level of Republicans and Democrats in Congress. It has been at a bureaucratic level and it is clear because on television, members of the administration of the White House, on the National Security Council say one thing happens in the negotiation. And the Deputy National Security Advisor said something else happens. Secretary Kerry then says something else. And I would add for the Congressman with all due respect, I know he represents his constituent, Robert Levinson. Seven years missing? I don't want to be here 6 years from now. I would say that is incompetent, especially when we have an opportunity. Mr. Deutch. Mr. Sekulow, excuse me. First of all, again, we are here today to focus on human rights in a country that has absolutely no respect for them. And we are focusing on human rights in a country that has immense respect for them. And to bring discredit on the men and women who have spent the last 7 years trying to bring Bob Levinson home, to advance some agenda, unknown agenda that I can't fathom, when we are all trying to work together to focus on human rights and to bring Pastor Abedini home, it is not right. Mr. Sekulow. Congressman, things have significantly changed and as you are walking out, in the last month we are now in negotiations with Iran. That didn't happen 6 years ago, so whatever efforts you are talking about before, it was different. But in the last 6 weeks, we have a new relationship with Iran. We can't think about Iran as, and we still hear this from the State Department: ``We have no diplomatic ties.'' Well, depending on how you define that when you are sitting down at the table regularly, I think the whole situation is fundamentally changed. So to accept what was previously done as satisfactory is no longer satisfactory, that is what I am saying. Mr. Deutch. Mr. Sekulow, since my time has expired and you have claimed some of the time that I no longer had, I would simply tell you that the commitment that exists to bring Pastor Abedini home and Mr. Hekmati home and to bring home my constituent is real. And have things changed? Absolutely they have. And does every one of us here believe that this is an issue that should be raised at every single meeting? Yes. I have said it. We have all said it and we all need to ensure that it happens. Mr. Sekulow. But we all know that it hasn't happened. Mr. Smith. Will the gentleman yield? The reason why I wanted to chair and put together this hearing, along with my distinguished colleague from Florida, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, was precisely because of our concern that it was not being raised, it had not been integrated in a place where it could have made all the difference in the world. And just by way of historical fact, it was Ms. Abedini at Frank Wolf's hearing who was told ``There is nothing we can do'' by the State Department. I have worked human rights issues for 33 years. There is absolutely everything they can do and I would say parenthetically that on Jacob Ostreicher, and I know you have helped us on that as has Congressman Ros-Lehtinen. Jacob Ostreicher is an American being held now under house arrest, but 18 months in Palmasola Prison in Bolivia. Never charged with anything. His rice farm was fleeced from him, taken away. The prosecutors, the rogue prosecutors, many of them are now in prison themselves, but he is still under house arrest. I have tried repeatedly and asked Secretary Kerry himself to intervene. It has not happened yet. We can't get above the level of Assistant Secretary to raise the issue and that man, Jacob Ostreicher, a Jewish man and there is anti-Semitism involved here. I had three hearings to bring this to the attention of the administration and it dropped the ball like a ton of bricks on human rights with an American just like with this American pastor. For the first year they did nothing. As a matter of fact, they were admonished by the administration to gag themselves and say nothing. Absolutely the wrong way to go about it. He at least got out of prison and he is under house arrest, so he is not facing the daily threats that he faced in Palmasola. So I see parallels, that the State Department goes the path of least resistance. Human rights is sidetracked. When we did the International Religious Freedom Act back in 1998, and I don't care who is in the White House, this has been a problem. Religious freedom is always given the back seat. And we put into the legislation, not only the establishment of Dr. Lantos Swett's commission to hold the administration to account with independent verification of what is going on, great reports that they do, particularly on recommendations for CPC countries, but the training of Foreign Service officers who are often clueless, and they are good people, but clueless about the nuances that often occur in countries relative to religious freedom the lack of it, and the persecution of believers. So there has been a backdrop of dropping the ball. I asked Secretary of State John Kerry if it was a mainstream issue and he said it was not part of the negotiation. That is a serious miss. And so I agree. We are working together on this. But we are hoping the administration will take the cue from the wife, Ms. Abedini, and from those who are concerned, including both sides of the aisle to step up, to do more, and especially when you are sitting right across from Iranian interlocutors who can make the difference. They could say free Abedini today and he is on a plane back to his wife and children. Mr. Deutch. Mr. Chairman, I agree wholeheartedly with you that on every occasion we should do as much as we can to bring home Pastor Abedini and to bring home Mr. Hekmati and Jacob and my constituent and that we should do everything we can to make this issue paramount. I agree with you. I simply point out that our goal in addition to bringing home those who have been persecuted and held hostage, that our goal, as well, more broadly, is to elevate human rights. In this debate, here, to elevate human rights in this Congress, to make sure that this, and every administration, of either party, puts human rights squarely, not only on the table, but right up front. That is what we are all striving for. I am simply making the point that as we strive to elevate human rights I just hate to see our efforts to do that amount to a round attack on the administration. And I don't disagree. I think the administration, well, let me just finish. I think the administration needs to be, as I said, the administration needs to be pushed to make sure that human rights matters every single day. That is our job. And we do it well. And we need to continue to do it. And Mr. Chairman, you have been a leader on these issues, as long as you have been in this House. And I am grateful for it. But I respectfully suggest that it becomes more difficult for us to make human rights the fundamental focus that it needs to be internationally if it appears that somehow this has turned into some sort of round of political squabble. And this is the only point I am trying to make. Mr. Smith. Just one very brief point and then I think Ms. Abedini wants to speak and then we will go to the chair. When there is a deficiency, I believe we have a duty to speak out. Mrs. Abedini said at Frank Wolf's hearing that she was told that there was nothing they can do. Chairman Wolf got on the phone, talked to Secretary Kerry. I think he talked to him personally and a statement went out immediately. We applauded the Secretary of State, all of us, and thanked him profusely for doing that. Now several months later, sitting across from the Iranians again, and the issue is not raised and the wife of Pastor Abedini, I think wisely, says ``What is going on here?'' It needs to be integrated. It needs to be part of that discussion and then he will be released. Otherwise, they take their cue by our lack of prioritization. The Iranian issue is over here on nuclear matters, but the issue of human rights is somewhere and we are not sure where. So that was the reason for the hearing. Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Abedini, our prayers to you and to your children and may our Lord continue to give you, your husband, and your children the strength you need to carry on with this important, important case. It is not a case. It is your husband. It is the children's father. But hearings like this one are important because that is the way we can push the administration, whatever administration is in power, to do all that it can, to do more, to ensure that your husband's release is immediate. And you may feel that certain individuals in power have abandoned your husband and we can have disagreements about that, but the members here are united in a bipartisan manner to make sure that we will not remain silent and we will continue to push. We are going to continue to raise your husband's case so that we can pressure all who can have a say in this to make Pastor Saeed's release a higher priority. Dr. Lantos Swett, USCIRF has made recommendations to the U.S. Government regarding religious freedom in Iran, several of which you outlined at a hearing on this same issue in March. What is your assessment of the administration's response to these recommendations? Do you believe that the U.S. has focused so much attention on the nuclear negotiations that it has ignored the abysmal human rights record of Iran out of fear of angering the regime? Also, in October 2010, the Ayatollah Khamenei publicly called non-Muslims, religious minorities, enemies of Islam and accused them of weakening the faith of Iran's Muslim youth. Another leading Ayatollah referred to non-Muslims as sinful animals. Statements like these, they incite violence against religious minorities. Would you agree with that? Have you observed increased violence against these groups following these kinds of provocative statements by so-called leaders? And despite the recommendations of USCIRF and the European Union's decision to individually sanction the judge who gave Pastor Saeed this outrageous 8-year sentence, the U.S. has yet to sanction this judge and it is not a partisan attack, it is a reality. What message does this lack of action send to religious minorities and human rights advocates in Iran? The Iranian regime's human rights record doesn't improve when the U.S. remains silent. It is an issue that doesn't get much attention because of the nuclear topic, but whatever the administration is in power, do you believe that the administration has been silent about Pastor Saeed's case? Do you believe it is spoken enough about this case and the case of others? I have asked a lot of questions and you can just pick whichever one you would like to answer. Otherwise, we would be here forever. So we will start with Dr. Lantos Swett. Ms. Lantos Swett. Well, I think it would be an overstatement to say that they have ignored the human rights situation in Iran. And one of the things that I referenced in my testimony was a relatively recent statement by the National Security Advisor, Dr. Susan Rice. That is a very high-level person within the administration and she said, ``Our sanctions on Iran's human rights abusers will continue and so will our support for the fundamental rights of all Iranians.'' So ignore, I think, would be too strong of a term. But I would also be remiss if I were not to say that we certainly at USCIRF feel that more needs to be done and more can be done. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you. I am going to cut you off just so that we can hear from the others. Ms. Lantos Swett. Absolutely. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you. Ms. Lantos Swett. Thank you. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Ms. Abedini or Mr. Sekulow, whoever would like. Mr. Sekulow. Thank you, Madam Chairman. And I would say, because I do want to clear this up, and Congressman Deutch is no longer with us, but my opening statement was all about this bipartisan support we have had in Congress which has been unprecedented. And it is not an attack, or a Republican or Democrat issue. It is an administration that I think Congress has also got to deal with. Are you being told what is accurate? I hope that briefing, that classified briefing clears what has been so difficult for the administration to communicate to us which is what is actually being done? And what is not. And when is it being done and I would add to that we have been told a number of times well Iran has been told this Iranian official, that Iranian official, from the President on down. What answer have we gotten? We have never been told an answer by Iran. This idea that we may be asking sometimes on the margins, in a phone call. That is wonderful. What is the response? Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. He must not become an asterisk or a footnote. Mr. Sekulow. Exactly right. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you. Yes, Ms. Abedini. Ms. Abedini. I wanted to make sure Mr. Deutch was here to discuss that, but I don't have an agenda. And there is nothing more than I would like to see my country united on an important issue such as human rights. I have been fighting tirelessly for my husband's release for over a year. It has been a lonely road for me and the kids as well. I haven't seen my kids most of this 444 days as well and they haven't had a mom in the last year. But for me, as an American citizen, it was unbelievable. I felt abandoned when we had the chance to not necessarily discuss it at the nuclear, but as a precondition, as a good- faith effort which we have done for the Iranian Government with the easing of the sanctions and the monetary and prisoners and so on. I would have expected my Government as we have done good- faith efforts for Iran to have--I like that example of a drug dealer and he is abusing his wife and kids. But what if he is abusing your child? You don't demand him to release your child before negotiating about the drug dealing? And I expected my Government before shaking hands with the world's number one violator of human rights issues and support of terrorism, that put aside, they have an American citizen---- Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Don't get me started about shaking hands. Ms. Abedini. Before shaking hands, before negotiating, we have done good faith effort. I expected our Government to have Iran show a good-faith effort, that they want to work with us. This would have been a perfect opportunity for Iran to release the three Americans. And again, I don't have an agenda. I am not a political person. I am a mom. I am a wife. And as an American citizen and millions of American citizens who are behind me in this, we do not understand what happened. We do not understand. And we are very much upset by it and I very much feel abandoned and I feel my husband has been abandoned. I do hope he survives that prison and we can bring him home quickly. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you. And the last word to the good doctor. Mr. Calingaert. Every authoritarian government will push back when we bring up human rights. They will fuss. They will make excuses. They will say it complicates everything else we want to do. That is their instinctive reaction. We should know better. The one thing that is clear is that if we don't bring something up, they get the message. They get the message that we don't care. And I would also again point back to specific cases like Maziar Bahari. In 2009, by his own account he felt sort of lost in prison and once then Secretary Clinton raised his case publicly, his treatment in prison immediately improved and that led to his release. So it is critical that we raise these cases. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you very much to all of you. Thank you, Mr. Smith. I am sorry, I am going to have to depart. Thank you. Mr. Smith. Mr. Meadows. Mr. Meadows. Thank you so much for being here for your testimony. I want to ask just a few clarifying questions. Ms. Abedini, if your husband were to be released today, he does not have an intention to go back to Iran and work against the government, is that correct? Ms. Abedini. He does not. Mr. Meadows. I knew the answer to that because you had shared that, but I think it is important to the American people that they realize that this was a pastor working on behalf of an orphanage, of those who were really ministering the Iranian people and that he was convicted and held for a trespass that happened many years prior to that. It was not like he was there violating a law at that particular time. To put it in very mild terms, it is like me speeding 12 years ago and then somebody coming in and changing the speeding law and saying that you actually were going above the speed limit and now we are going to convict you and throw you in jail. And so that is the injustice of it. The other part I guess that I would ask if I know that you have been working with a number of officials in the State Department, in Congress, and throughout. You have expressed appreciation to me personally for many of them working and so I don't want it to get lost today. You do have an appreciation for those that are continuing to work on your behalf, whether it is behind the scenes or out front, is that correct? Ms. Abedini. Yes, very much so. Mr. Meadows. Dr. Lantos Swett, I want to come back to you. We have had a number of hearings where you have been here and you have raised this issue and there has been a number of times I have said, ``Who are the Bonhoeffers, who are the Wilberforces of today?'' and I think that you continue to champion those causes and I just want to say thank you. By raising the issue that we have talked about and raising the issue here today, what more can we do in a bipartisan congressional way to raise the issue, not only of Pastor Saeed Abedini, but of the other families, the pictures of whom you showed us, how can we come alongside the executive branch, the State Department, and encourage them to keep it at the forefront so it is not a picture that happens on one hearing, on 1 day, and doesn't get raised again. How can we best help you in that in a bipartisan manner? Ms. Lantos Swett. Well, I will bring up again the Defending Freedoms Project which is a specific, concrete initiative of Amnesty International, USCIRF, and the Lantos Human Rights Commission which I think would be a wonderful means of engaging more Members of Congress in sort of embracing this work themselves directly. But I would like to say something about the role of the Congress, in general, and I am very sorry that my good friend Congressman Deutch isn't still here because I think Congress has an extraordinary role, has had an extraordinary role historically in being the conscience of our nation when it comes to human rights. It is simply a fact. I actually wrote my Ph.D. dissertation on this subject, so it is something very near and dear to my heart. But if you look at the history of human rights being legislatively enshrined as a principal goal of U.S. foreign policy, it was the work of Congress that brought that about in opposition to many administrations, one after the other, because every administration, every State Department, this isn't a criticism, this is the reality, they are balancing many, many different items on a big plate and sometimes there is a tendency to put human rights in that small box in the corner of the room where it can occasionally get a tip of the hat, but it is not centrally enshrined. And Congress really has historically played that role, going back to the 1970s and saying, ``No, this isn't optional. This is essential.'' This is going to be part of our official policy that the promotion of human rights should be a central and principal goal of American foreign policy. And it is so important because that above all plays to our strengths. It is when we advocate for our deepest values that we are playing to our strengths and playing from our strengths. And so I would say that Congress has an indispensable role. Administrations will always resist and will always push back because there will always be other things on the agenda, whether it is our economic interest or nuclear concerns. Mr. Meadows. Should we tie that to human rights to have an economic element to it? I mean because so many times we negotiate on economics and we negotiate on human rights and they don't come together. Should we tie those together? Ms. Lantos Swett. Well, I am a big believer in the school of linkage and not decoupling of human rights from our other essential foreign policy goals. They are all important, but I think that when we link human rights to our other foreign policy goals we strengthen our position. And I would say just in general and I don't have a specific proposal to put in front of you although we obviously talked about the Lautenberg amendment and the need to reauthorize that on a multi-year basis, but that is an example of Congress acting legislatively to, if you will, force any administration's hand. So Congress is the legislative body in our Government. You are the ones that propose and adopt laws. So I would say a robust human rights legislative agenda so that it is beyond resolutions and statements and hearings, but as with the Sergei Magnitsky bill which again, it was passed over opposition from the State Department, opposition from the administration, not because they don't share the goals, but they never want their hands tied. Well, Congress isn't trying to tie any particular administration's hands, but sometimes they are trying to force our Government's hand in a positive way, to do what we should do, to pursue the goals that the administration shares, but there are always countervailing arguments. So I would say a robust legislative agenda. And most recently, the Sergei Magnitsky Act is a really good example of Congress standing firm, against very bipartisan. Democrats and Republicans were side by side in pushing that forward in the face of opposition. It is now the law and that is, I think, a good example of when Congress is at its best. You have a lot of power when it comes to leading"
