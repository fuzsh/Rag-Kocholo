        "text": "By MICHAEL GINGOLD\n\nWith his genre comeback CRIMES OF THE FUTURE poised for its Cannes premiere and June release, the legendary filmmaker has his next project lined up.\n\nVariety reports that David Cronenberg will write and direct THE SHROUDS for producers Saïd Ben Saïd of SBS Productions, Martin Katz of Prospero Pictures and Michel Merkt. Vincent Cassel (pictured) will star, making his third collaboration with Cronenberg after EASTERN PROMISES and A DANGEROUS METHOD; the French actor has also been seen in SHEITAN, BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF, BLACK SWAN and UNDERWATER, among others.\n\nAccording to the trade, Cassel will play “Karsh, an innovative businessman and grieving widower, who builds a device to connect with the dead inside a burial shroud. Karsh’s revolutionary business is on the verge of breaking into the international mainstream when several graves within his cemetery are vandalized and nearly destroyed, including that of his wife. While he struggles to uncover a clear motive for the attack, the mystery of who wrought this havoc, and why, will drive Karsh to reevaluate his business, marriage and fidelity to his late wife’s memory, as well as push him to new beginnings.” Shooting is set to begin in March 2023.\n\n“We are thrilled to be going on a journey into the newest world from the distinctive imagination of David Cronenberg,” says Ben Saïd. “His ability to write smart and unconventional screenplays and then translate them into unique experiences on screen makes him a unique voice in film.”"
