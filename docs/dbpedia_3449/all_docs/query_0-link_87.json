        "text": "Two Canadian co-productions will compete at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. Twice Colonized and The Longest Goodbye are among the films in the World Cinema Documentary Competition announced today by the festival. Sundance returns to in-person screenings this year with a selection of the films available to U.S. audiences online. Twice Colonized follows Inuk lawyer and activist Aaju Peter as the sudden death of her son inspires a new campaign to address colonial violence. Peter was previously the subject of Hot Docs Audience Award winner Angry Inuk, directed by Alethea Arnaquq-Baril, who serves as producer on Twice Colonized. The film is a co-production between Canada, Denmark, and Greenland with Lin Alluna directing and Emile Hertling Péronard, Stacey Aglok MacDonald, and Bob Moore joining Arnaquq-Baril as producers.\n\nMeanwhile, The Longest Goodbye tells a story that should hit home for most audiences as it explores social isolation. Directed and produced by Ido Mizrahy, The Longest Goodbye follows a NASA scientist as he observes the impact of isolation on astronauts. The Canadian-Israeli co-production credits Nir Sa’ar and Paul Cadieux and lands the Day One slot for Sundance’s World Cinema competition. Mizrahy previously directed the bullfighting doc Gored. Also announced for Sundance on the Canadian front is Brandon Cronenberg’s drama Infinity Pool.\n\n“The program for this year’s Festival reiterates the relevancy of trailblazing work serving as an irreplaceable source for original stories that resonate and fuel creativity and dialogue,” said Kim Yutani, Sundance Film Festival Director of Programming in a statement from the festival. “In so many ways this year’s slate reflects the voices of communities around the world who are speaking out with urgency and finally being heard. Across our program, impactful storytelling by fearless artists continues to provide space for the community to come together to be entertained, challenged, and inspired.”\n\nSundance announced a total of 99 feature films today representing 23 countries. 28% of the feature film directors are first-time feature filmmakers, while 17 of the feature films and projects announced “were supported by Sundance Institute in development through direct granting or residency labs.”\n\n63% of Sundance’s U.S. Documentary Competition titles are by directors who identify as women and 63% who identify as People of Colour. In the World Cinema Documentary Competition, 46% of directors identify as women; 38as People of Colour; 23% as LGBTQ+, and 8% as a person with a disability.\n\nOther docs in today’s announcement from Sundance include new works by Crip Camp co-director Nicole Newnham with The Disappearance of Shere Hite and All In’s Lisa Cortés with Little Richard: I Am Everything in the U.S. documentary competition. The latter gets the Day One slot.\n\nIn the Premieres section, Sundance will host the world premieres of documentaries by Matthieu Rytz with the Jason Momoa-narrated Deep Rising, Laura McGann’s free-diving doc The Deepest Breath, Laura Gabbert’s study of the cost of cheap food in Food and Country, Bethann Hardison and Frédéric Tcheng’s look at Hardison’s career as a fashion trailblazer with Invisible Beauty, Davina Pardo’s look at a beloved author in Judy Blume Forever, Razelle Benally and Matthew Galkin’s inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls with Murder in Big Horn, Lana Wilson’s Brooke Shields doc Pretty Baby, Academy Award winner Davis Guggenheim’s Michael J. Fox profile Still, and Alexandria Bombach’s portrait of the Indigo Girls It’s Only Life After All, which kicks off Sundance’s Premieres slate as the Day One selection.\n\nDocs by Deborah Stratman and Mary Helena Clark and Mike Gibisser break new ground in the New Frontier section at Sundance. The festival hosts world premieres of their works Last Things and A Common Sequence. Anton Corbijn’s music doc Squaring the Circle (The Story of Hipgnosis), meanwhile, headlines the Spotlight program. Many of the documentaries listed below will shape the field in the year to come.
