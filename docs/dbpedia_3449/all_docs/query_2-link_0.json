Her first release in eight years,[1] it was featured in the finale of the TV series Hannibal, broadcast in August 2015.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries creator Bryan Fuller, who had contacted her in November 2014,[2] described the song (composed by Siouxsie with Brian Reitzell) as \"epic\".[3] Reitzell had previously worked for Siouxsie in 2006 for the Marie Antoinette soundtrack when he re-orchestrated the introduction of Siouxsie and the Banshees's debut single \"Hong Kong Garden\" with strings players for Sofia Coppola's film.\n\nOn recording the song, Siouxsie has stated:\n\n\"Since those wonderful shows at The Royal Festival Hall in 2013, it's been a frustrating stop start to feed my soul and make some new music. Then along came a tasty morsel from Brian Reitzell working on the soundtrack for the final Hannibal series. I was already a huge fan and before I knew it, I was taking a nibble out of Hannibal and getting stuck in. Thank you Hannibal – at long last my appetite is back again.\"[4]\n\nReleases\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo different versions of the song were released. \"Love Crime (Amuse-Bouche Version)\" was made available for digital download on 4 December 2015.[4]\n\n\"Love Crime\" (retitled \"Love Crime from the Wrath of the Lamb\") was included on Hannibal Season 3 – Volume 2 (Original Television Soundtrack), which was issued by Lakeshore Records in digital format on 11 December 2015, and on CD in January 2016. A double vinyl edition, was issued by Invada Records on 27 May 2016 on black vinyl,[5] and blue vinyl (the latter being only available on the label website).[6]\n\nThe song became available for streaming in 2022.[7]"
