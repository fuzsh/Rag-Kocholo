        "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard's release from prison has sparked renewed attention on a bizarre case that captivated true crime enthusiasts for years, but what happened to the man behind the killing - Nicholas Godejohn?\n\nBlanchard was convicted of persuading her online boyfriend, Godejohn, to kill her abusive mother, who forced her to pretend for years that she was suffering from leukemia, muscular dystrophy and other serious illnesses. But on Thursday, Blanchard was released early from prison, having been sentenced to 10 years behind bars.\n\nBlanchard's story sparked national tabloid interest when reports first emerged of her mother's death in 2015, but the bizarre case went on to become the subject of several documentary series.\n\nHere's a look at the case and how it unfolded:\n\nWho is Gypsy Rose Blanchard?\n\nGypsy Rose Blanchard is a Missouri woman who convinced her online boyfriend to kill her mother after she suffered years of abuse.\n\nAt age 23, Blanchard had her mother, Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard, killed after the mother essentially held her daughter prisoner, forcing her to use a wheelchair and feeding tube.\n\nIt turned out that Gypsy Blanchard, now 32, was perfectly healthy, not developmentally delayed as her friends had always believed. Her mother had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological disorder in which parents or caregivers seek sympathy through the exaggerated or made-up illnesses of their children, said her trial attorney, Michael Stanfield.\n\nGypsy Rose was subjected to years of unnecessary medical treatment and abuse, which she testified during the trial is what pushed her to suggest that Nicholas Godejohn, her then boyfriend, should kill Dee Dee.\n\nWhat happened to Gypsy Rose Blanchard?\n\nBlanchard was taken to doctors throughout her life to receive treatment for conditions such as leukemia and muscular dystrophy that she did not actually have. According to the Springfield News-Leader, Blanchard's mother forced her to use both a wheelchair and an oxygen tank although she required neither.\n\nStanfield said Gypsy Blanchard's mother was able to dupe doctors by telling them her daughter's medical records had been lost in Hurricane Katrina. If they asked too many questions, she just found a new physician, shaving the girl's head to back up her story. Among the unnecessary procedures Gypsy Blanchard underwent was the removal of her salivary glands. Her mother convinced doctors it was necessary by using topical anesthetic to cause drooling.\n\n“Essentially Gypsy’s mother was holding her a prisoner,” Stanfield said. “Her mother would not allow her to spend any time alone with any other human being. Her mother, when they went to the doctor, did all the talking.”\n\nThrough the ruse, the mother and daughter met country star Miranda Lambert and received charitable donations, a trip to Disney World and even a home near Springfield from Habitat for Humanity.\n\nGypsy Blanchard, who had little schooling or contact with anyone but her mother, also was misled, especially when she was younger, Stanfield said.\n\n“The doctors seem to confirm everything that you’re being told. The outside world is telling you that your mother is a wonderful, loving, caring person. What other idea can you have?” Stanfield said.\n\nBut then the abuse became more physical, Stanfield said. Gypsy testified that her mother beat her and chained her to a bed. Slowly, Gypsy also was beginning to understand that she wasn’t as sick as her mom said.\n\nThe truth about her health — and the abuse she is believed to have suffered — was suspected by some but not entirely exposed until after her mother's murder.\n\nWho is Nicholas Godejohn and how did he and Gypsy Rose Blanchard meet?\n\nGypsy Rose Blanchard said she met Godejohn, of Big Bend, Wisconsin, on a Christian dating website in 2012 and they managed to carry out a secret relationship, often in text messages, which prosecutors read in Godejohn’s trial.\n\nGypsy said she first met Godejohn in person in March 2015, when he visited from Wisconsin. In text messages presented in his trial, Godejohn and Gypsy generally discussed love, sex and planning a life together — until June 2015, when they began discussing needing duct tape and knives in the days before Clauddine Blanchard was killed. Godejohn and Gypsy often referred to each other’s darker impulses, with Godejohn’s discussing his “evil side” that he said “enjoys killing.” Gypsy’s darker side was called “Ruby” in the texts.\n\nWhat did Godejohn do to Blanchard's mother?\n\nClauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard was stabbed to death in June 2015.\n\nAccording to the probable cause statement, Gypsy Blanchard supplied the knife and hid in a bathroom while Godejohn repeatedly stabbed her mother. The two ultimately made their way by bus to Wisconsin, where they were arrested.\n\nClauddine Blanchard’s body was found after her friends noticed a post on her Facebook page stating, “That (expletive) is dead.”\n\nWhat was Godejohn convicted of and what was his sentence?\n\nProsecutors argued that Godejohn plotted for more than a year before he stabbed Clauddine Blanchard. His attorneys argued that he is autistic and therefore does not have the mental capabilities required for premeditation.\n\nWhen she took the stand at his trial, Gypsy Blanchard said “I talked him into it.”\n\n“Nick was so in love with her and so obsessed with her that he would do anything,” Godejohn’s trial attorney Dewayne Perry argued in court, saying his client has autism and was manipulated.\n\nProsecutors, however, argued that he was motivated by sex and a desire to be with Blanchard.\n\n“Things are not always as they appear,” said Greene County Sheriff Jim Arnott as the strange revelations began to emerge.\n\nGodejohn is now serving a life sentence for his role in the killing.\n\nWhat did Godejohn say about his relationship to Gypsy Rose Blanchard?\n\nIn a 2019 interview from prison, Godejohn called Blanchard his soulmate.\n\n“Somehow I just knew, deep within my heart, some way me and her would end up being together in the end. There’s no other option, we gotta do it,” he said in an Oxygen special \"Gypsy Rose & Nick: A Love to Kill,\" referring to the murder. “I wanted to make sure her mom was not going to harm her anymore. I made sure of that.”\n\nHe looked fondly on his days with Blanchard prior to her mother's killing.\n\n“That was, man, probably the best days of my life, that’s the only way I can describe it,” he said in an interview from prison. “I enjoyed every second of it.”\n\nIf they weren't sentenced to prison, Godejohn said he envisioned his life with Blanchard.\n\n“I was gonna get a job and start looking for an apartment. After a little ways down the road, I’d probably end up marrying her and end up having children with her,” he said. “That’s something I’ve never had with someone else. To this day, she’s the only one I’ve ever had that with.”\n\nWhen did Gypsy Rose go to prison and when was she released?\n\nProsecutors cut her a deal because of the abuse she had endured. In exchange for pleading guilty in 2016 to second-degree murder, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2016. The first-degree murder charge she initially faced would have meant a life term.\n\nBlanchard was released from Chillicothe Correctional Center in Chillicothe, Missouri, on Thursday, three years before her original release date.\n\nShe served seven years and was released on Thursday after being granted parole.\n\nWhat did Gypsy Rose say about her release?\n\n\"I'm ready for freedom,\" Blanchard told PEOPLE in an exclusive interview prior to her early release. \"I'm ready to expand and I think that goes for every facet of my life.\"\n\nBut Blanchard said she remains remorseful.\n\n\"No one will ever hear me say I'm proud of what I did or I'm glad that she's dead,\" she told PEOPLE. \"I'm not proud of what I did. I regret it every single day.\"\n\nAre Gypsy Rose Blanchard and Nicholas Godejohn still together?\n\nNo.\n\nEventually, Blanchard got married while behind bars to Ryan Scott Anderson, now 37, of Saint Charles, Louisiana.\n\nAnderson and Blanchard met through her prison's pen pal program, a family-friend and representative for Blanchard told E! News in 2019.\n\nWhat is Factious Disorder Imposed on Another and Munchausen syndrome by proxy?\n\nFactious Disorder Imposed on Another (FDIA) formerly known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, is when someone falsely claims that another person has physical or psychological signs or symptoms of illness, or causes injury or disease in another person with the intention of deceiving others, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThis disorder usually involves a parent claiming a child is in need of medical care that is in fact unnecessary.\n\nThe disorder may be caused by a combination of psychological factors and stressful life experiences, including childhood trauma, serious childhood illness, loss of a loved one, or other conditions.\n\nMunchausen syndrome is a mental health disorder where you falsify, exaggerate, or induce physical, emotional or cognitive disorders, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nWhat else should you know about the case?\n\nGreene County Prosecutor Dan Patterson described it as “one of the most extraordinary and unusual cases we have seen.”\n\nStanfield recalled that the first time he met Gypsy, she got out of breath walking the 75 yards (69 meters) from the elevator to the room where he talked to her. He described her as malnourished and physically frail.\n\n“I can honestly say I’ve rarely had a client who looks exceedingly better after doing a fairly long prison sentence,\" Stanfield said. \"Prison is generally not a place where you become happy and healthy. And I say that because, to me, that’s kind of the evidence to the rest of the world as to just how bad what Gypsy was going through really was.”\n\nGypsy Blanchard later said it wasn’t until her arrest that she realized how healthy she was. But it took time.\n\nThe bizarre case was the subject of the 2017 HBO documentary “Mommy Dead and Dearest,” the 2019 Hulu miniseries “The Act\" and an upcoming Lifetime docuseries “The Prison Confession of Gypsy Rose Blanchard.” Daytime television psychologist “Dr. Phil” McGraw interviewed her from prison. The novel “Darling Rose Gold\" draws upon the story for its premise and Blanchard's own account, “Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom” is set for publication next month."
