        "text": "Entertainment One has acquired all North American rights to Brian De Palma’s “Passion,” which has been a draw for several potential distributors since it had its world premiere in competition at the Venice International Film Festival. The Canada-based company plans an early 2013 release in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nRachel McAdams and Noomi Rapace star in De Palma’s remake of the 2010 French thriller “Love Crime,” which follows two women playing dangerous games with each other in the world of international business. The film, which also screened at the Toronto film festival this month, has prompted mixed reviews but its lurid style and content could prove enticing to audiences.\n\nREAD MORE: Toronto Review: ‘Passion’ Will Please Brain De Palma Fans — And No One Else\n\n“We’re delighted to add ‘Passion’ to the 2013 domestic slate,” said eOne Films North America president David Reckziegel. “Rachel McAdams’ and Noomi Rapace’s performances are captivating, and De Palma delivers another great thriller that audiences have already embraced at Venice and Toronto.”\n\nEOne has recently waded into the U.S. distribution market, with the August release of its Cannes pick-up of David Cronenberg’s “Cosmopolis,” which has not stirred much interest with American audiences. The company plans a release of “A Late Quartet” in November.\n\n“It’s certainly been an exciting and successful freshman year for our growing U.S. theatrical team, and we look forward to the upcoming year and continuing to bring the highest quality independent films with premium talent to the U.S. market,” said Reckziegel.\n\nEOne’s Reckziegel and Sejin Croninger negotiated the deal with SBS Productions’ Saïd Ben Saïd and ICM Partners, which reps De Palma, on behalf of the filmmakers."
