        "text": "The Detroit Pistons are expected by most to pick a center or power forward in the 2009 NBA draft. With the departures of Rasheed Wallace and Antonio McDyess, the need big men is obvious. However, it is my belief that the Pistons should opt to select 6'6 small forward Terrence Williams of Louisville.\n\nTayshaun Prince is the key player that disappears in the playoffs. Joe Dumars has failed to supply the Palace Prince with help at his position. Every other position on the team always usually had a decent backup except the small forward spot.\n\nTerrance Williams brings a totally different style to the Pistons' roster. He is an athlete that has tremendous upside to his game. He has a 37-inch vertical and can provide solid minutes on the floor. He still needs to work on his 3pt. shot but each year at Louisville he improved on his shooting. Players that keep getting better each year is something that the Pistons need at this year from the draft. He displays the ability to run the floor and finish above the rim and plays pretty decent defense. Shooting is his main weakness but that is the easiest thing for a player to learn in the pro's.\n\nThis player may not be a starter but he can definitely fill-in for Tayshuan Prince. Prince seems to wear down as the season and playoffs go along so Terrance Williams seems like a good pick."
