        "text": "The team won the Olympic gold medal in 2004, bronze four years later, and finished third in the 2009 FIBA Americas Championship before winning it all in 2011. This is the third Olympics that the bulk of the team has played together and their experience makes them a formidable competitor in this year's tournament.\n\nIf they were playing three-on-three, the Argentines might have a shot at Olympic gold this year. But they are not, and their lack of depth should keep them out of the final.\n\nIn a recent exhibition game, Argentina lost to Team USA 86-80. If Scola had not missed six free throws, the outcome might have been different.\n\nHe has played on three NBA championship teams with the San Antonio Spurs, won the NBA's sixth-man award in 2008, was named the MVP of the Italian league twice and the MVP of FIBA Americas Championship. He has played on the Argentina national team since 1999 and carried the flag for Argentina in the 2008 Games.\n\nHe has made 150 three-point shots in a season twice in his NBA career. As a two-guard, we can expect him to be taking quite a few three pointers from in this tournament. If he starts to hit treys consistently against Team USA, expect Coach K to put Andres Iguodala out to defend him and try to deny him the ball.\n\nGinobili was the leading scorer with 23 points in the exhibition game against Team USA. In that game, he scored key baskets at crucial moments when the tide seemed to be turning against the Argentine squad.\n\nCarlos Delfino has played professionally in four countries: Italy, Argentina, Russia and USA. He plays either shooting guard or small forward. Regardless of position, he will certainly be counted on for his three-point shooting.\n\nIn his last three seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks, he averaged around 30 minutes, two assists and 10 points per game.\n\nHe might be called on to cover one of the three dynamic point guards that Team USA is expected to use in waves. While he is a strong defender, there's no way he can compete with the speed of Team USA's point guards.\n\nPlaying for the Houston Rockets the last five years, Scola was a consistent 15 points and eight rebounds a night type guy. You can't question his durability, having missed games in only one of those five seasons.\n\nFor a big, he shoots free throws at a decent 75 percent clip but the six he missed during a recent exhibition against Team USA might have cost Argentina the game. He scored 14 points to go along with six rebounds on the night.\n\nIn their furor to acquire Dwight Howard, the Rockets recently played the amnesty card on Scola, who was immediately snatched up by the Phoenix Suns.\n\nAgainst the Americans, Scola should be most dangerous when Tyson Chandler and his defensive prowess are on the bench.\n\nAndres Nocioni plays small forward and spent the 2011-2012 NBA season buried on the Philadelphia 76ers bench. Among his nine years in the NBA, he had four very productive seasons with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nHe has been on the Argentina national team since 1999. His international career wil be best remembered for the 2006 FIBA Worlds where he missed a buzzer-beater that would have defeated Spain."
