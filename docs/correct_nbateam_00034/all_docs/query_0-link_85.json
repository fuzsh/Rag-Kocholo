        "text": "AUBURN HILLS -- The Detroit Pistons saw just enough glimpses of the future to provide some encouragement Wednesday. But after three seasons out of the playoffs -- a streak projected to continue this season -- encouragement only goes so far when the present is so spotty.\n\nThe Pistons got a first-hand look at what a team active in the free-agent and trade markets can do in a 105-96 loss to the Houston Rockets, a team which looks almost nothing like it did at the end of last season, and markedly different than even last week.\n\nJames Harden did more than just collect 37 points, 12 assists, six rebounds and four steals against the Pistons, making him the first player in NBA history to exceed 30 points and 12 assists in his first game with a team.\n\nHe also underscored how difficult it is for the Pistons to improve when they have done so little to overhaul personnel, save through the draft.\n\nThe Rockets got Harden in a blockbuster deal with Oklahoma City this week to complete a backcourt change which started by snagging Jeremy Lin in free agency. None of their five starters -- center Omer Asik and forwards Chandler Parsons and Marcus Morris were the others -- ever had started a season-opener before.\n\nThe Pistons, by comparison, made one offseason trade, dealing Ben Gordon for Corey Maggette in a salary-clearing maneuver. Ben Wallace's veteran presence is gone. Five rookies are here instead.\n\nThat's change, all right. Just not the kind that usually wins.\n\nThings won't always be as bad as Wednesday. Rodney Stuckey won't always shoot 1 of 10 and the Pistons won't always run into a dynamo like Harden.\n\nBut the Pistons lost their opener not because of the bench, which outscored Houston's reserves by nine, but because of their starters, particularly their guards, Brandon Knight and Stuckey, who were outscored 49-24 and had a 20-10 assists disadvantage against Houston's starting backcourt. And that doesn't even include Carlos Delfino, who made four of his five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter off the bench.\n\nRookies Kyle Singler and Kim English combined for 18 points. Rookie Andre Drummond had two, and two other rookies didn't play. That's all to be expected. The rookies will have the ebb-and-flow games.\n\nThe starters' lack of consistency is a bigger concern, and with a six-game western swing up next, this game should have gotten their full attention.\n\nInstead, Pistons coach Lawrence Frank said his team \"had too much herky-jerk in our game,\" and when Houston went small in the fourth quarter and Detroit matched up with three guards and Tayshaun Prince at power forward, the problems only were exacerbated.\n\n\"We were getting into things later than we wanted to,\" Frank said. \"The ball was sticking. We didn't change what we ran. But it was our intent with it -- screening on top of guys so they could go under, over-dribbling, passing and standing, not probing and getting into that paint, playing around the paint.\"\n\nHe let that thought drop without finishing but summarized it all with one sentence: \"We have to put more into the game.\"\n\nPistons owner Tom Gores sat in a mid-court, court-side seat after conducting a pre-game press conference in which he said he's in this for the long haul, which is a good thing, because that's what it's going to be.\n\nGores said he has seen progress in the young Pistons.\n\n\"The ultimate progress is we've got to win,\" he said.\n\nWhen the Pistons undergo real change after this season, they might have a chance. Regardless what anyone thinks about the Rockets' moves, the model is something the Pistons eventually must follow to escape this rut.\n\n--Slava Kravtsov was a healthy inactive. Corey Maggette, who is suffering from a calf strain, also was inactive. Three other Pistons did not play as the rotation took shape for the first time: Austin Daye, Charlie Villanueva and Khris Middleton.\n\n--Tayshaun Prince called it \"a circus out there the whole game\" as the Pistons had runs of 12-2 in the second quarter and 13-0 in the third, but allowed runs of 10-0 to start the third and 19-4 early in the fourth. \"It's something I talked about before with a young team, You have to play consistent basketball. If you don't, this could happen.\"\n\n--Prince praised Harden, who outscored Stuckey 37-9 in the matchup of shooting guards. \"We would've thought that he would've had a tougher time as far as figuring out their offense and whatnot,\" Prince said. \"But they only stuck to a couple of plays the whole entire game, which kind of helped him out and kept him in a good rhythm.\"\n\n--In the fourth quarter, Houston outscored the Pistons 8-0 on second-chance points, 9-3 off turnovers, and had a 13-3 rebounding advantage."
