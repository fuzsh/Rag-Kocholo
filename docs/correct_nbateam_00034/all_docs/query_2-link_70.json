        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nMILWAUKEE — Carlos Delfino still doesn’t remember all the details about a frightening injury that left him lying motionless on the court last week.\n\nNow he’s trying to put the incident aside and help the Milwaukee Bucks make their final push for the playoffs.\n\n\"When I step on the court, I need to try to be 100 per cent,\" Delfino said before the Bucks’ game Saturday night against Phoenix. \"It was a tough week.\"\n\nDelfino fell to the floor in the Bucks’ March 26 loss to Miami, and Heat player Udonis Haslem inadvertently stepped on the back of his head.\n\nAfter spending several motionless minutes on the court surrounded by medical staff and trainers, Delfino was taken off on a stretcher. He missed three games, then returned for the Bucks’ loss at Charlotte on Friday night.\n\nDelfino said he wasn’t officially diagnosed with a concussion.\n\n\"I don’t know,\" he said, joking. \"Maybe they told me and I forgot.\"\n\nBut he did have concussion-like symptoms, including memory loss and sensitivity to light. He said he wanted to come back before Friday night’s game but was unable to pass a memory test earlier in the week.\n\nDelfino said the arena lights even bothered him when he first took the floor in Charlotte on Friday, although the symptoms got better as the game went on.\n\n\"The first couple minutes was tough,\" Delfino said. \"It was kind of tough to concentrate.\"\n\nBucks coach Scott Skiles said Delfino’s play improved as Friday night’s game progressed. He finished with 14 points.\n\n\"We thought he was struggling a little bit early, and rightfully so,\" Skiles said, noting that Delfino wasn’t able to do much while sidelined with the injury.\n\nDelfino, who also had stitches taken out of his chin before Saturday’s game, said one of his first clear memories after the incident was being wheeled off the court on the stretcher, when he saw himself on a stadium video board.\n\nDelfino said he was happy that the game wasn’t televised in his native Argentina, because his family members usually watch most of his games. But he said the incident was troubling for his wife, who was at the game.\n\nStill, Delfino said he won’t play more tentatively as the Bucks try to solidify their playoff status.\n\n\"I can’t think about that now,\" he said. \"First of all, basketball is a sport of contact. It was a crazy situation, a bad luck situation and I’ve been fortunate.\""
