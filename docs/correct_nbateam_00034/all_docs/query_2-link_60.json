        "text": "With Olympic basketball tipping off on Saturday and USA Basketball looking for their sixth gold medal in the past seven Olympics (thanks a lot, Larry Brown), the NBA has an incredible hold on the basketball in Rio. Players of past, present, and future are littered throughout the rosters of the 12 competing countries. Even with so many players sitting out the Olympics this year due to various reasons, the NBA is well represented on the hardwood in Brazil.\n\nThere are 45 current NBA players under contract participating in the Olympics this year. There are 19 former NBA players participating among the 12 teams. And there are seven players who were drafted but either never came over or haven't come over to play in the NBA yet. That's a grand total of 71 players with NBA ties out of 144 players on the 12 rosters. Just think of how many players would be in Rio for the Olympics had it not been for injuries, Zika, or security concerns.\n\nHere are the 71 players from the 12 teams.\n\nArgentina\n\nArgentina has been one of the powerhouses in Olympic and international basketball over the past 16 years. With players like Manu Ginobili, Luis Scola, and Andres Nocioni gracing the hardwood for their country, they've managed to be one of the three or four best countries in basketball during this stretch. They even won the 2004 Olympic gold medal in basketball when Team USA failed to bring home first place.\n\nWhile Pablo Prigioni isn't on the team this year, Argentina still has three current NBA players and two former players to help them seek another medal.\n\nCurrent NBA players: Manu Ginobili (San Antonio Spurs), Luis Scola (Brooklyn Nets), Patricio Garino (San Antonio Spurs)\n\nFormer NBA players: Andres Nocioni (2004-12), Carlos Delfino (2004-13)\n\nOther NBA draft picks: N/A\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralia is still missing young players like Dante Exum and Ben Simmons, but they have more current NBA talent than most teams in this tournament. Their biggest problem though is they don't have a lot of it coming from the wings. Andrew Bogut, Aron Baynes, and Joe Ingles are all big men (Ingles is much more of a stretch-4 than a 3). Their former NBA talent includes three more big men, as well. The size on this team is their biggest strength but they'll need their two NBA point guards to come up with big play in order to challenge for a medal.\n\nNow if only they could have convinced Kyrie Irving years ago to play for the Australian team...\n\nCurrent NBA players: Andrew Bogut (Dallas Mavericks), Aron Baynes (Detroit Pistons), Matthew Dellavedova (Milwaukee Bucks), Joe Ingles (Utah Jazz), Patty Mills (San Antonio Spurs)\n\nFormer NBA players: David Andersen (2009-11), Cameron Bairstow (2014-16), Brock Motum (2014 summer league)\n\nOther NBA draft picks: N/A\n\nBrazil\n\nThe host country isn't quite as dangerous as they used to be, but they still have a health amount of NBA talent on the roster. Leandro Barbosa and Nene will likely lead them on offense. Raul Neto will probably take the reins at point guard from Marcelo Huertas at some point too. Brazil is missing Anderson Varejao and Tiago Splitter this year, but they still have enough talent to maybe sneak into the bronze medal game.\n\nCurrent NBA players: Leandro Barbosa (Golden State Warriors), Nene (Houston Rockets), Raul Neto (Utah Jazz), Marcelo Huertas (Los Angeles Lakers), Cristiano Felicio (Chicago Bulls),\n\nFormer NBA players: Alex Garcia (2003-04), Marquinhos Souza (2006-08)\n\nOther NBA draft picks: N/A\n\nChina\n\nThis team isn't as excited as they used to be when Yao Ming was involved. Now they're relying on former lottery pick Yi Jianlin, along with two young big men who were drafted in the second-round of the 2016 draft. This team doesn't have much talent in the backcourt and that's where they really need the NBA talent to exist for them. Instead, they have three very solid big men that will struggle to have an impact because they're not going to initiate the offense themselves.\n\nCurrent NBA players: N/A\n\nFormer NBA players: Yi Jianlin (2007-12)\n\nOther NBA draft picks: Wang Zhelin (2nd round pick 2016, Memphis), Zhou Qi (2nd round pick 2016, Houston)\n\nCroatia\n\nThis young Croatian team could be a lot of fun, even if they don't make it past group play. The trio of Bojan Bogdanovic (27), Mario Hezonja (21), and Dario Saric (22) makes up their current NBA player list. Those guys will want to get out and run. They'll also want to shoot 3-pointers and try to show the rest of the world they could be a real problem in the 2020 games.\n\nAs for now, they're going to live through some growing pains in group play and soak in the experience for next time around.\n\nCurrent NBA players: Bojan Bogdanovic (Brooklyn Nets), Mario Hezonja (Orlando Magic), Dario Saric (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\nFormer NBA players: Roko Ukic (2008-10)\n\nOther NBA draft picks: N/A\n\nFrance\n\nThere's a real argument that France and their NBA talent could be the biggest threat to Team USA. Tony Parker can be a problem in international play. Boris Diaw gives them the versatility they'll need against the U.S. and Rudy Gobert is the ideal rim protector in this situation. Nicolas Batum becomes the Swiss Army Knife for the group and if his 3-point shot is on then they can challenge Spain and Lithuania as the second best team in the Olympics.\n\nThey'll need one of their other guards (likely Nando de Colo) to step up but France is legit. Anything less than a bronze medal should be considered a failure.\n\nCurrent NBA players: Tony Parker (San Antonio Spurs), Boris Diaw (Utah Jazz), Rudy Gobert (Utah Jazz), Nicolas Batum (Charlotte Hornets), Joffrey Lauvergne (Denver Nuggets)\n\nFormer NBA players: Mickael Gelabale (2006-2013), Nando de Colo (2012-14)\n\nOther NBA draft picks: N/A\n\nLithuania\n\nLithuania hasn't won a bronze medal since 2000 but they're always a huge threat to come out of the Olympics as the third best country in basketball. They'll run everything through Jonas Valanciunas and try to put pressure on other countries to bang with them inside. They'll hope young guys like Mindaugas Kuzminskas (on contract with the Knicks) and Domantas Sabonis (rookie for the Thunder) can become solid contributors.\n\nMostly, Lithuania needs the perimeter players, who don't really have NBA talent at this point, to come up big in order for them to knock off either France or Spain or both.\n\nCurrent NBA players: Jonas Valanciunas (Toronto Raptors), Mindaugas Kuzminskas (New York Knicks), Domantas Sabonis (Oklahoma City Thunder)\n\nFormer NBA players: N/A\n\nOther NBA draft picks: Renaldas Seibutis (2nd round pick 2007, Dallas), Robertas Jovtokas (2nd round pick 2001, San Antonio)\n\nNigeria\n\nNigeria's roster would look so much better if Al-Farouq Aminu and Festus Ezeli were cleared to play. Instead, injuries and insurance concerns will keep the two best current Nigerians from playing in the Olympics this time around. They'll rely on a rookie and a couple of players with former NBA experience to come through and shake up the group play by finding a way to advance. They won their first Olympic game back in 2012.\n\nCan they find another win this year without the better Aminu on the roster?\n\nCurrent NBA players: Michael Gbinije (Detroit Pistons)\n\nFormer NBA players: Ike Diogu (2005-12), Josh Akognon (2013), Ben Uzoh (2010-12)\n\nOther NBA draft picks: N/A\n\nSerbia\n\nSerbia is missing Nemanja Bjelica in a big way from their roster. Bjelica was one of the best players in Europe before he finally came over and joined the Minnesota Timberwolves. Injuries will keep him from participating this year. Instead, Serbia will need to rely on Nikola Jokic and Miroslav Raduljica to beat up opponents inside. They'll need future Phoenix Suns guard Bogdan Bogdanovic to be a threat from the outside.\n\nAnd remember how Nemanja Nedovic was drafted by the Golden State Warriors in the first round a couple of years ago and was called the Serbian Derrick Rose? They need him to be the Serbian good version of Derrick Rose in order to shake up this tournament.\n\nCurrent NBA players: Nikola Jokic (Denver Nuggets)\n\nFormer NBA players: Nemanja Nedovic (2013-14), Miroslav Raduljica (2013-15)\n\nOther NBA draft picks: Bogdan Bogdanovic (1st round pick 2014, Phoenix), Milan Macvan (2nd round pick 2011, Cleveland)\n\nSpain\n\nSpain is the biggest threat nearly every year. Their roster is loaded with seven current NBA players, and that's with guys like Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka already sitting out the competition for Spain. The former NBA players they have with Juan Carlos Navarro and Rudy Fernandez can really put up points as well, so it's not like a couple of has-beens are filling in the roster.\n\nSpain will probably be challenged by France and Lithuania more than they'll challenge the U.S., but USA Basketball knows they can't take Spain lightly. They only won by seven points in the gold medal game in 2012. Spain wants the upset more than anything.\n\nCurrent NBA players: Ricky Rubio (Minnesota Timberwolves), Pau Gasol (San Antonio Spurs), Sergio Rodriguez (Philadelphia 76ers), Jose Calderon (Los Angeles Lakers), Alex Abrines (Oklahoma City Thunder), Nikola Mirotic (Chicago Bulls), Willy Hernangomez (New York Knicks)\n\nFormer NBA players: Juan Carlos Navarro (2007-08), Rudy Fernandez (2008-12), Victor Claver (2012-15)\n\nOther NBA draft picks: Sergio Llull (2nd round pick 2009, Denver)\n\nUnited States of America\n\nSurprise, USA Basketball is made up of 12 NBA players. The scary thing for the rest of the world is this team is the obvious heavy favorites to bring home the gold again and they're going to try it without LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Blake Griffin, Kawhi Leonard, and others.\n\nWhile this year's Team USA resembles much more of a FIBA World Cup roster they may send, it still has 12 of the best players in the world on one team. If you ranked the NBA talent in the Olympics, USA would have 12 of the top 13 or 14 players there. This team is loaded and they have gold in their eyes. Anything less would be a huge failure.\n\nCurrent NBA players: Kyrie Irving (Cleveland Cavaliers), Kyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors), DeMar DeRozan (Toronto Raptors), Jimmy Butler (Chicago Bulls), Klay Thompson (Golden State Warriors), Paul George (Indiana Pacers), Kevin Durant (Golden State Warriors), Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors), Carmelo Anthony (New York Knicks), Harrison Barnes (Dallas Mavericks), DeMarcus Cousins (Sacramento Kings), DeAndre Jordan (Los Angeles Clippers)\n\nFormer NBA players: N/A\n\nOther NBA draft picks: N/A\n\nVenezuela\n\nNormally, Venezuela would have Brooklyn Nets point guard Greivis Vasquez to help them out, but injuries and rehab are keeping him from joining his fellow countrymen in the Olympics this year. Most likely, the lack of NBA talent on this roster will doom them to being the worst team of the group play. However, they weren't expected to come close to winning the FIBA Americas Championship last year to qualify for this year's Olympics and they managed to pull that off.\n\nMaybe this will be like a Disney movie?\n\nCurrent NBA players: N/A\n\nFormer NBA players: N/A"
