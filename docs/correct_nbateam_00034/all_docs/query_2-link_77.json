I thought my team was not too bad, as i had a nice starting line up of kyrie irving, evan turner, metta world peace, serge ibaka, and deandre jordan, along with a solid sixth man of marshon brooks.\n\nNeedless to say, we were awful. I usually like to sim the first season, and in doing so, we had a 20 game losing streak which led to the benching and trading of metta world peace(basically a trade for the Celtics first round draft pick)\n\nBy the end of the season we finished with a record of something like 22-60. Since i drafted a bunch of young players only, my team got much better from the start, and it helped a lot that we won the lottery, and held the 15th pick in the draft. With the first pick, i got SF Anthony Davis, who ended up being a 78(My team led the league in blocking the first year, so Anthony Davis being a beast at blocking too fits in nicely, but may be overkill lol) With the 15th pick, i drafted another SF in Quincy Miller. The logic behind the pick was basically covering me just in case Ibaka leaves. If he does leave, i can move Davis to PF and Miller to starting SF. Im really excited to see what the future holds for my young 76ers team\n\nRookie\n\nOVR: 3\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2011\n\nBlog Entries: 1\n\nRe: NBA 2K12: The Official Association/Online Association Thread\n\nWell after the trade deadline I surveyed the NBA and looked at all 30 teams wondering who I could make the most noise with on 2K. And I looked at the history of the teams and decided to go with the Golden State Warriors - a franchise who finally turned things around with their roster and now look to get back to the playoffs.\n\nAlotta storylines can be played out. Can steph curry show that he can be the man on the team?? Can mark jackson improve these guys in his rookie season as a head coach?? Will bogut and jefferson have the major impact for the organization?? Can the organization with the worst playoff history turn it around??\n\nIm playing 82 games 12 minute qtrs(game freak)\n\nStarting Line up\n\nPg Stephen Curry(36)\n\nSg Klay Thompson(34)\n\nSf Dorell Wright(34)\n\nPf David Lee(34)\n\nC Andrew Bogut(34)\n\n6th man Nate Robinson(18)\n\nSf Richard Jefferson(13)\n\nSg Brandon Rush(13)\n\nSf/Pf Dominic McGuire(11)\n\nC Andris Biedrins(9)\n\nPg Chris Jenkins(2)\n\nPf Jeremy Tyler(2)\n\nThe Miami Heat wasted no time in signing Greg Oden to a one year deal(UGH)\n\n1st Game Golden State 113 - Los Angeles Lakers 117 @ Golden State\n\nThe crowd was rocking the Oracle Arena - excited about the new season.\n\nWe ran the Lakers the first half dominating but the second half was all laker basketball. We exchanged leads in the 4th but the lakers showed why they have the collection of championships. Andrew Bogut lead GSW with 29 pts and 11 boards, Dorell Wright followed with 22 pts, RJ gave us 16 pts off the bench. Steph had 14 pts and 11 asts and David Lee had 13 pts and 14 boards. The Lakers were led by the Black Mamba with 40 pts while their new PG Ramon Sessions gave em 25 pts. If this game has any indication of the what the season is gonna be like than I cant wait to play the rest.\n\na new WE BELIEVE era 2011-2012"
