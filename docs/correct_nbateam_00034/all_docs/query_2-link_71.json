        "text": "Before the 2000-2001 season, Argentine basketball never had a player in the NBA. The country didn’t qualify for the tournament at the 2000 Olympics. But by the 2002 FIBA World Championships, Argentina had enough talent to defeat the host – a U.S. team with a not-so-hot roster – before losing in the finals to Yugoslavia. And in the 2004 Olympics in Athens, it managed to win gold, in the process beating a better USA team featuring prime Tim Duncan and Allen Iverson, and an underutilized young trio of Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, and LeBron James.\n\nBasically, being from the U.S. and having lots of friends from Argentina sucked that summer, because they were rightfully going to talk shit (Also, shoutout to Puerto Rico for being the first to wreck Team USA that year).\n\nYes, the USA squad’s roster didn’t compare to the 1992 Dream Team, and in fact, it kind of stunk (by USA standards). But Argentina hammered home the point that a team could beat a collection of individuals. Had the USA cruised to the gold medal even after losing to Puerto Rico and Lithuania, who knows whether the necessary changes to the Olympic roster construction approach would have been made. In Return of the Gold: The Journey of Jerry Colangelo and the Redeem Team, Dan Bickley described the selection process behind the USA Men’s Sr. Team Managing Director’s 2008 Olympics squad. “Colangelo made it clear that he didn’t want an all-star team, a rotisserie team, or a team that looked good on paper. He wanted role players, chemistry, character, and heart. He wanted grit and he wanted gold,” he wrote. It sounds like what he wanted is a U.S. team that played like Argentina.\n\nIn addition to the impact on the international scene, Argentina’s rise benefited some NBA teams as well. With Luis Scola and Manu Ginóbili now out of the playoffs, it’s possible that the presence of Argentina’s golden generation of basketball in the NBA is coming to an end. If so, it’s a fitting time to look back on how these players, who found the ultimate success at the international level, fared in the Ene-be-a. These guys didn’t just have an effect on the international level. They showed the league that plenty of talent existed in Argentina, and that this country – which had no NBA footprint just four years prior to the 2004 Olympics – now had several players who could contribute in a major way.\n\nHere’s a look at how they fared in the NBA:"
