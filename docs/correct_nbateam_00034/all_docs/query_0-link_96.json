        "text": "Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal agree on one thing: The NBA's new marquee team is ... drum roll, please ...\n\n``It'd have to be Detroit, wouldn't it?'' Bryant said.\n\n``I don't know. I'd probably have to say the Pistons,'' offered O'Neal.\n\nOK, so it's a less-than-convincing argument made by the two superstars, but can anyone blame them?\n\nThe NBA enters unfamiliar territory in its first season following the breakup of the Los Angeles Lakers, unquestionably the league's marquee team for the past half-decade. Play starts tonight with the Lakers hosting Denver, defending champion Detroit hosting Houston, and Sacramento at Dallas.\n\nWith O'Neal now in Miami, coach Phil Jackson in semiretirement, and Bryant the only one of the threesome still remaining with the Lakers, there's a void where there used to be a vortex.\n\nSure, the Pistons are the reigning champs. But they're not the ones headlining the league's Dec. 25 doubleheader - the annual time when commissioner David Stern tries to hook the casual fan into declaring ``I Love This Game.''\n\nNo, the big attraction that day is the first meeting between the former teammates known to many simply as Shaq and Kobe, who were split up over the summer when the Lakers dealt O'Neal to Miami for three starters and a No. 1 draft pick.\n\nNot since 1975, when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was sent from the Milwaukee Bucks to the Lakers, has a dominating center in the prime of his career been traded.\n\nThat assumes, however, that the 32-year-old O'Neal is still at the top of his game.\n\n``Well, any team without Shaq is not as good. I don't care who's left,'' offered San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, whose team is considered by many to be the favorite in the West. ``If (Tim) Duncan wasn't on our team, we wouldn't be as good. If (Kevin) Garnett wasn't on Minnesota, they wouldn't be as good.\n\n``But at the same time it doesn't mean they (Lakers) are a bad team. They're going to be a competitive team, and Kobe's going to want to put them on his shoulders and do some things. And he's such a great player, he's going to have a good amount of success with that.''\n\nBryant remains in the stronger of the two conferences, but there's no question the East is vastly improved - both by the addition of O'Neal, and by the success shown by Larry Brown's team last spring when the Pistons upset the Lakers and became the first team in 25 years to win a title without a true superstar on its roster.\n\nDetroit returns almost the same exact lineup, tinkering only to strengthen its bench with the additions of Antonio McDyess, Derrick Coleman and Carlos Delfino. The last was on Argentina's Olympic championship team.\n\nThe Pistons won over many casual fans last June by picking apart the Lakers behind the efficient playmaking of Chauncey Billups, the mid-range shooting of Richard Hamilton and the beneath-the-boards energy of Ben Wallace.\n\nThe old winning formula - surrounding one or two superstars with role players - no longer sits unchallenged as the best way for NBA teams to build.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the old recipe is dead. What happened to the Pistons, in some minds, might be more indicative of a fluke than a fundamental shift.\n\n``They were a really true team and they played with great balance, they played unselfishly, they had depth and they happened to be in the right place at the right time and maybe catch the Lakers when they were at a point where they were a little off,'' said Indiana coach Rick Carlisle, whose team lost to Brown's in the Eastern Conference finals. ``That's no knock on Detroit, but being opportunistic is one of the things that is really important in this league.''\n\nThe Heat were certainly opportunistic when they seized upon the availability of O'Neal - it first came up in a talk between Lakers owner Jerry Buss and Heat president Pat Riley about Riley's interest in rejoining the Lakers as coach - and acquired him for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler and Brian Grant.\n\nAlso opportunistic were the Houston Rockets, which sent Steve Francis, Cuttino Mobley and Kelvin Cato to Orlando for scoring champ Tracy McGrady."
