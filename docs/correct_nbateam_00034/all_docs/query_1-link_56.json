        "text": "Published July 8, 2013 8:40am\n\nCarlos Delfino will return to the Milwaukee Bucks, agreeing to a three-year deal worth around $10 million, Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski reported, Sunday (Monday, PHL time).\n\nAccording to Wojnarwoski though, the third year is a team option. The contract also cannot be finalized until after the league's July 10 moratorium.\n\nDelfino actually spent three seasons with the Bucks, from 2009-10 to 2011-12. He then signed with the Houston Rockets last season, averaging 10.6 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.0 steals in 67 elimination round games.\n\nHe was later waived at the start of this offseason by Houston to clear cap space to sign free agent center Dwight Howard. - AMD, GMA News"
