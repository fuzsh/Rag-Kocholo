        "text": "AUBURN HILLS – The last time the Pistons had two first-round selections in the annual draft, they chose Darko Milicic and Carlos Delfino.\n\nThat 2003 draft turned out to be a memorable one, but not the way the Pistons had planned. Milicic and Delfino were major busts and got traded.\n\nWith another chance to get a double dose of help for their veteran team, the Pistons cannot afford to misfire on the No. 15 and No. 27 selections tonight.\n\nIf all goes well, the Pistons will wind up with two players who can step right into their rotation.\n\nThis is a pretty deep draft and we’ve been working tirelessly getting ready for it,o president of basketball operations Joe Dumars said.\n\nThey had better be prepared for all kinds of scenarios. Blockbuster deals with the likes of Kevin Garnett, Shawn Marion and Jermaine O’Neal are being discussed around the league, and lottery picks could be part of those trade packages.\n\nSeveral other teams with additional first-round picks, including Atlanta, Charlotte and Philadelphia, are listening to trade proposals. Phoenix and Indiana are among the clubs trying to move into the lottery.\n\nHow that all shakes out will impact what players will be available when the Pistons go on the clock for their first pick, which they acquired from Orlando as part of the Milicic trade in February 2006.\n\nUnless a projected top-10 selection takes an unexpected tumble, the Pistons will pick a small forward, shooting guard or point guard with their mid-first rounder.\n\nFlorida State’s Al Thornton or Georgia Tech’s Thaddeus Young could fill the small forward spot in the rotation created when Delfino was traded to Toronto earlier this month.\n\nUSC’s Nick Young or Eastern Washington’s Rodney Stuckey would provide instant offense as Richard Hamilton’s backup. Texas A&M’s Acie Law and Georgia Tech’s Javaris Crittenton would solve Detroit’s need for a young backup point and perhaps jump into the lineup should Chauncey Billups sign with another team as a free agent.\n\nAt least three of those players figure to go in the 14-team lottery, though the Pistons could get proactive and trade up a few notches if they want one of those players badly enough.\n\nThornton and Law are the most polished players in the group. Thornton showed steady improvement throughout his collegiate career and averaged 23.5 points in the ACC last season. Law was a first-team All-American as a senior and plays a lot like Billups, including a penchant for taking and making big shots.\n\nYoung was the Pac-10’s second-leading scorer as a junior while Stuckey averaged 24.4 points in his two seasons at Eastern Washington.\n\nCollege teammates Thaddeus Young and Crittenton played only one college season and that may temper the Pistons’ enthusiasm to select either one.\n\nDumars doesn’t want a project on his hands, considering the Pistons’ shaky reserve corps.\n\nBut Young, who averaged 14.4 points in his lone season for Georgia Tech, might have the greatest upside of any player the Pistons could be staring at when the clock starts ticking. Crittenton, at 6-foot-5, would be a nice change-of-pace guard for a team that needs more versatility from its bench.\n\nLater in the first round, the Pistons will be crossing their fingers that a proven collegian like USC point guard Gabe Pruitt or Vanderbilt swingman Derrick Byars will drop to their spot.\n\nWhile the Pistons’ draft record has been spotty since Dumars took over in 2000, they have usually enjoyed better success with late first-rounders. Mateen Cleaves (No. 15 in 2000) and lottery-pick Rodney White (No. 9 in 2001) were total busts.\n\nDumars uncovered a gem in 2002, selecting Tayshaun Prince at No. 23. Then came the disastrous 2003 draft. The Pistons didn’t have first-round picks in 2004 or 2006, but their 2005 selection, forward Jason Maxiell (No. 26), proved to be a quality sleeper.\n\nThe Pistons have been careful not to tip their hand as to which players they covet the most in this draft. Dumars hasn’t held a news conference since his annual season-ending sitdown with the media more than two weeks ago.\n\nWhen the Pistons’ first selection comes up sometime after 9 o’clock tonight, they will no longer by flying under the radar. If they want to continue to fly high in the Eastern Conference, they must not repeat the mistakes of 2003.\n\nReserve guard Flip Murray has decided not to exercise the opt-out clause in his contract. Murray signed a two-year, $3.5 million contract last season and bounced in and out of Flip Saunders’ rotation.\n\nThough Murray will remain Pistons property, there’s a good chance he will be traded during the offseason.\n\nContact Dana Gauruder at dana.gauruder@oakpress.com."
