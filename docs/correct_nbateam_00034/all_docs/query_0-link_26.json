        "text": "Biography[]\n\nCarlos Francisco Delfino (born August 29, 1982, in Santa Fe, Argentina) is an Argentine professional basketball player for the NBA's Toronto Raptors. He plays at the shooting guard and small forward positions. He stands 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb).\n\nHe began his professional career playing in the Argentine Basketball League for Olímpia de Venado Tuerto in the 1998-99 season, and then transferred to Unión de Santa Fe in 1999-2000. Delfino moved to Italy in 2000 and played four seasons in the Italian A-1 League, the first two with Reggio Calabria and the other two seasons with Skipper Bologna. He was a member of Argentina's Under-21 National Team and helped Argentina to a third-place at the 2001 World Under-21 Championships in Saitama, Japan.\n\n(2000–2001) In his first season in Italy, played for Reggio Calabria. In just under 21 minutes per game, averaged 8.8 points, 2.5 rebounds and 1.9 steals. Scored a season-high 25 points in his second game against Scavolini Pesaro, making five of eight three-point attempts. Scored 15 points in just 20 minutes against Cordivari Roseto. Tallied 14 points apiece against Paf Bologna, Muller Verona and Kinder Bologna. Hit at least one three-pointer in 19 of 24 games.\n\n(2001–2002) Became a starter for Reggio Calabria, playing 30.8 minutes per game and averaging 13.5 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.4 steals and 1.7 assists. Improved free throw shooting to 79 percent from 64 percent the previous season. Scored a season-high 39 points vs. Metis Varese, including 14-for-14 from the free throw line. Hit for 30 points, including four three-point field goals, vs. Euro Roseto. Scored 21 points on 9-for-15 shooting against Trieste.\n\n(2002–2003) In his first season with Skipper Bologna, moved into the starting lineup in the third game of the season and averaged about 26 minutes. Scored 18 points, including shooting 3-of-5 from three-point range, vs. Euro Roseto. Posted double-doubles against Benetton Treviso (13 points, 13 rebounds), Oregon Scientific Cantù (15 points, 11 rebounds) and Pippo Milano (14 points, 11 rebounds). Suffered torn ligaments in his ankle late in the season, but was expected to return in late May.\n\n(2004–2005) After he recovered from a knee injury, Carlos Delfino averaged 15.3 mpg, 3.9 ppg, 1.8 rpg, and 1.3 apg in 30 games under coach Larry Brown. Many regarded Brown as having limited space for Delfino's offensive creativity. It was perceived that under new coach Flip Saunders, Delfino would thrive.\n\n(2005–2006) In his second season on the Pistons' active roster, Carlos averaged 10.7 mpg, 3.6 ppg, 1.7 rpg, and 0.6 apg. Delfino played off the bench for either Tayshaun Prince or Richard Hamilton. He had three straight games where he scored in double digits before being sidelined for the next 4 with the flu. Delfino became an important change-of-pace player in Flip Saunders' offensive scheme.\n\nDuring the 2005-06 NBA season, Delfino was noted for impressive defensive performances against star perimeter scorers such as Darius Miles, Paul Pierce, Kobe Bryant, Vince Carter, and Dwyane Wade.\n\nHe was part of Argentina's gold medal-winning 2004 Olympic basketball team.\n\nOlympic medal record Competitor for Argentina Men's basketball Gold 2004 Athens Team\n\nPrior to the Olympics, Delfino had been playing as a member of the Italian League and a regular participant in the Euroleague. Beginning in 2004, however, he has signed to play for the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association, who made him the 25th pick in the first round of the 2003 NBA Draft, the first Argentine player ever to be selected in the first round of the NBA Draft.\n\nIn November 2004 Delfino suffered a knee injury that kept him in the injured list for over three months. He had an operation in the USA and then another in Argentina, where he recovered. However, Delfino did not immediately return to form after his rehabilitation, and was left off the Pistons' 2005 playoff roster.\n\nOn June 15, 2007 the Detroit Pistons traded Delfino to the Toronto Raptors for 2nd round picks in the 2009 and 2011 NBA Draft\n\nTransactions[]\n\nStatistics[]\n\nTotals[]\n\nSeason Team G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 2005 DET 30 4 459 42 117 .359 9 35 .257 23 40 .575 13 42 55 38 22 6 23 44 116 2006 DET 68 1 726 91 226 .403 20 60 .333 45 67 .672 28 85 113 44 21 15 36 86 247 2007 DET 82 1 1372 156 376 .415 46 138 .333 70 89 .787 67 199 266 88 46 8 61 97 428 2008 TOR 82 0 1928 251 632 .397 120 314 .382 116 156 .744 66 293 359 145 69 11 75 177 738 2010 MIL Career 290 33 5203 627 1582 .396 233 659 .354 274 376 .729 196 716 912 379 172 49 232 456 1761\n\nPer Game[]\n\nSeason Team G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 2005 DET 30 4 15.3 1.4 3.9 .359 0.3 1.2 .257 0.8 1.3 .575 0.4 1.4 1.8 1.3 0.7 0.2 0.8 1.5 3.9 2006 DET 68 1 10.7 1.3 3.3 .403 0.3 0.9 .333 0.7 1.0 .672 0.4 1.3 1.7 0.6 0.3 0.2 0.5 1.3 3.6 2007 DET 82 1 16.7 1.9 4.6 .415 0.6 1.7 .333 0.9 1.1 .787 0.8 2.4 3.2 1.1 0.6 0.1 0.7 1.2 5.2 2008 TOR 82 0 23.5 3.1 7.7 .397 1.5 3.8 .382 1.4 1.9 .744 0.8 3.6 4.4 1.8 0.8 0.1 0.9 2.2 9.0 2010 MIL Career 290 33 17.9 2.2 5.5 .396 0.8 2.3 .354 0.9 1.3 .729 0.7 2.5 3.1 1.3 0.6 0.2 0.8 1.6 6.1\n\nAwards and Accomplishments[]\n\nSee also[]\n\nWeb Directory[]\n\nStatistics[]\n\nNews, Opinion, and Rumors[]"
