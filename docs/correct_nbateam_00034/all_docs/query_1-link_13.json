        "text": "Jim Mone/Associated Press\n\nFree-agent wing Carlos Delfino is attempting to make his way back to the NBA after not playing in the league for two years.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nDelfino Eyeing a Comeback\n\nFriday, September 18\n\nAccording to Gery Woelfel of the Racine Journal Times, Delfino worked out with the San Antonio Spurs earlier this summer but did not receive an offer from them.\n\nDelfino has not played in the NBA since the 2012-13 season, when he appeared in 67 games for the Houston Rockets. After missing all of 2013-14 with a foot injury, Delfino was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in the Jared Dudley deal and waived before the 2014-15 season.\n\nCapable of playing both the shooting guard and small forward positions at 6'6\", Delfino seemed to have figured his game out after joining the Toronto Raptors in 2007. In the following five seasons, which included stops with the Milwaukee Bucks and Rockets, Delfino averaged 9.0 points or more per game and shot over 36 percent from three-point range.\n\nHis play earned him a starting role in Milwaukee, where he served as a threat both inside and beyond the three-point line. Delfino's defense was a nice asset as well, especially around the perimeter, which made him an attractive target to Rockets general manager Daryl Morey:\n\nThere are no guarantees that Delfino would be able to put up those kinds of numbers at 33 years old with his injury history. If he proves he is able to run the floor and defend the wing like he used to, teams might want to take a chance on him.\n\nHaving a veteran who is capable of shooting from long range with a little bit of size off the bench wouldn't hurt, especially on a younger team that needs some help on the wings on both sides of the ball."
