        "text": "Rookie\n\nOVR: 5\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2013\n\nLocation: Philippines\n\n'04-'05 Detroit Pistons Roster - w/ 2K Share download\n\nHey guys.\n\nI know some of you know the great Detroit team from the '03-'04 season?\n\nSome of you don't know. Probably because it was almost 10 years ago.\n\nSee, the 'greatest' Detroit roster was when they won the NBA championship the season Rasheed Wallace joined the team.\n\nBut since 2K has not created a few cyberfaces for some of the retired players like Chucky Atkins or Tremaine Fowlkes. It's sad.\n\nSo pretty much, I've thought to create the '04-'05 Detroit Pistons roster (12 players in all, all players have cyberfaces.)\n\nRemember, this team is only for the PC version in 2K Share.\n\nWARNING:\n\nPlayer statistics may not be accurate. If you do edit it in a more accurate rating (that is according to the right stats of that player in that specific season) please PM me or reply to this thread with the statistics changes. Thanks guys!\n\nRoster\n\nCarlos Arroyo\n\nChauncey Billups (I used the old Chauncey)\n\nElden Campbell\n\nCarlos Delfino (I don't know if 2K made a cyberface for the young Delfino, so I used the old Delfino cyberface.)\n\nRonald Dupree (I got this as an SF from Free Agency.)\n\nDarvin Ham\n\nRichard Hamilton (I used the old Rip Hamilton.)\n\nLindsey Hunter\n\nAntonio McDyess (Sorry, I used the old McDyess face.)\n\nDarko Milicic (used the old Darko guys. Haha.)\n\nTayshaun Prince (the old Tayshaun)\n\nBen Wallace (Luckily, 2K made a young Ben Wallace w/ afro. Be proud.)\n\nRasheed Wallace (Of course, Sheed's Knicks cyberface.)\n\nI'll try to update if there is more.\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\n\nMedevenx's Ultimate Roster 0.6\n\n-Thanks to Med for putting the Create a Team logos (replacing logos 1-10 with the Trail Blazers, Wizards, Raptors, Bucks, Knicks, etc.) and gave me an idea to come up with this roster. *This link goes to the 0.8 roster preview*\n\nSeriously guys. If it wasn't for Med's Ultimate roster, this wasn't ever going to happen.\n\nGoogle\n\n-This might seem childish but yeah. Google for providing the rosters! :O\n\nWarning: I'll try to update Ben Wallace. He's got 'white-boy' legs. Haha. Sorry 'bout that.\n\nScreenshots:\n\nSpoiler\n\nLast edited by ProtatoPie; 01-14-2013 at 05:03 AM."
