Olympiakos was in game for him too but he accepted rich Russian offer.\n\n1.98 cm, 104 kg and 1982 bor Argentinean NT member began his professional career in 1998 in Argentinean league. In 2000 he moved to Italy, where he played for 4 years with Reggio Calabria and Skipper Bologna. In 2003 he was 25th pick in NBA draft and moved to USA in 2004. He played 3 seasons with Detroit Pistons, who had drafted him, last year he signed with Toronto Raptors. Despite having good season, he?€™s now heading back to Europe.</div>\n\nhttp://www.talkbasket.net/news/carlos-delfino-in-khimki.html\n\nThat's a lot of money. Damn, the Russian League is just getting stronger and stronger.\n\nWell I'm glad that he's not in the league anymore. If we couldn't have him, I didn't want other teams to. I remember he mentioned the possibility of going back to Europe if he couldn't salvage his NBA career in Toronto. I'm not exactly sure what he used as a measure for success (I thought he had a fairly good season), but I guess he just went with what will probably be his biggest payday."
