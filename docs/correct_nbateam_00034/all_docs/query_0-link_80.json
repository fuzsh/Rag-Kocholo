        "text": "St. Francis - Carlos Delfino didn't realize how much he enjoyed playing the NBA game until he spent a year in Russia playing for BC Khimki Moscow.\n\n\"It was a way to learn and understand I was missing the NBA,\" Delfino said during a news conference at the Cousins Center on Thursday. \"I was watching (NBA) games almost every night; my wife can tell you that.\"\n\nThe Bucks acquired the 6-foot-6 Delfino in a trade with the Toronto Raptors earlier this week. The native of Argentina is expected to play primarily at small forward, giving the Bucks a wing shooter and playmaker to complement second-year players Joe Alexander and Luc Richard Mbah a Moute at that position.\n\nDelfino showed a nice sense of humor, joking about all the international players on the Bucks roster. \"We were all talking about what type of language coach Scott (Skiles) would speak,\" he said with a grin.\n\nAnd when asked about his shooting prowess and whether he could give the Bucks another three-point threat to complement Michael Redd, Delfino said, \"Michael is here (holding his hand high in the air), and I am right here (bringing his hand down considerably). I can help. I like to do many different things. Sometimes I can score.\"\n\nDelfino clearly was relieved to be back in the NBA, after being released last week from a multiyear contract he signed with Khimki prior to last season. The global financial downturn had a profound impact on a number of teams in the Russian-A Superleague, making it difficult for them to meet their financial obligations.\n\n\"When I signed the contract, it was a great situation for me,\" Delfino said. \"I could play on the (Argentine) national team and play in the Olympics, and it paid off with a bronze medal. But after the long season and all the problems, I was a little disappointed about it.\"\n\nDelfino agreed to a three-year deal with Milwaukee, with the first year fully guaranteed at $3.5 million, following a sign-and-trade agreement between the Raptors and Bucks. Toronto still held Delfino's NBA rights after he played for the Raptors during the 2007-'08 season.\n\nHe expects to have an opportunity for significant playing time, with the Bucks seeking to fill the small forward spot so ably handled by veteran Richard Jefferson a year ago.\n\n\"I think it's a chance,\" Delfino said. \"Everyone will come here for the pre-season and work for those minutes; I know that.\n\n\"I will get ready to try to get those minutes, but whatever is good for the team is good for everyone. I've been on teams that think that way, and those teams go farther. The Argentine national team is like that. We have many stars, but we just try to win.\"\n\nDue to his fulltime efforts to find a suitable NBA contract, Delfino is not on Argentina's roster for the FIBA Americas Championship, which will be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico starting on Wednesday and running through Sept. 6. The top four teams will qualify for the 2010 FIBA World Championship to be played next summer in Turkey.\n\nDelfino said his comfort level in Milwaukee is helped by his good relationship with general manager John Hammond, an association dating to their days in the Detroit Pistons organization. Hammond was in the Pistons' front office when Delfino was taken by Detroit with the 25th overall pick in the 2003 draft.\n\n\"I think John knows me,\" Delfino said. \"I'm a guy that plays for the team. This is a young team that has a lot of talent.\n\n\"Of course, it will take some time, but I think I'm a guy who can do that (adjust). I will try to do my best from Day One. I know how this league works, and my expectations are to do well from the beginning.\""
