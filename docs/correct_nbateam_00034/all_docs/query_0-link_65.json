        "text": "AUBURN HILLS -- Amid the Detroit Pistons' youth movement, Tayshaun Prince stands uniquely, the second-oldest player, the last remaining link to the 2004 NBA champions, yet still starting.\n\nHe doesn't like preseason games and wishes none existed. But when the bright lights come on tonight for real, in the 7:30 opener against the Houston Rockets at The Palace of Auburn Hills, he will be the one Piston who knows what it takes to play until summer.\n\n\"We need to play the same way every time we step out on the floor,\" Prince said. \"The good teams do that. They play well under any circumstances. We all know that there will be a game here and there where the legs might catch up to you and things like that. But for the most part, every time you step on that floor, it's consistent basketball.\"\n\nThe Pistons, who were 25-41 last season, open a rebuilding season with five rookies against a Houston team which added point guard Jeremy Lin and center Omer Asik via free agency and produced a blockbuster trade this week in acquiring Olympic gold medalist James Harden from Oklahoma City.\n\nThe Rockets gave up a lot to get Harden but hope that the result is an elite backcourt.\n\n\"Adding Harden obviously just adds another prolific scorer,\" Pistons coach Lawrence Frank said. \"But the way they play, they're a very free-wheeling, up and down, outstanding drive-and-kick team, and they've made some very significant additions that have really helped their team.\"\n\nThe Rockets also have ample shooting, a suspect trait for the Pistons, with Harden, Carlos Delfino and Chandler Parsons.\n\nThe immediate problem for most teams will be containing Harden's multi-faceted offensive game, though he'll face starters more frequently now, and won't have the benefit of playing alongside the likes of former Thunder teammates Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and NBA shot-blocking king Serge Ibaka.\n\n\"Harden's a great player,\" Pistons guard Will Bynum said. \"Harden makes great reads, he defends, he can shoot the 3, he can come off the pick-and-roll and make plays for himself or his teammates, he's tough in transition, has a big body, he's crafty. Harden brings the whole package. Definitely, he's an impact player. Every team, going into the game, is going to be focused on stopping him first. He just makes them a different team.\"\n\nFor the Pistons, the beginning of the 82-game regular-season journey doesn't mark the end of the learning process.\n\nFrank, who like many coaches openly prefers practices to games, is emphasizing that point.\n\n\"What do people say when they have a couple bad games? 'Oh, we need to go back and practice,'\" Frank said. \"A great line, I think (former NFL coach) Jon Gruden said, is, 'I don't understand why coaches say they've got to get back to the fundamentals. Where were they? Why would you ever get away from them?'\n\n\"So I think the thing is, every single shootaround, every single practice, every single meeting, there has to be purpose behind getting better. So even though there's going to be more games than practices, every day has to count.\""
