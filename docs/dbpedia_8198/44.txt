Vilhjalmsson failed to make a start in his loan spell at Colchester

Forward Matthias Vilhjalmsson has left Colchester United after he was recalled from his loan by parent club FH.

Vilhjalmsson joined the U's in January but made just three substitute appearances in a brief stay in Essex.

The Icelandic international will now return to Iceland to take part in FH's pre-season preparations.

Colchester boss John Ward said: "We wish him all the best in his footballing future and for his contribution whilst at the club."

Vilhjalmsson has been capped six times by his country and scored six times in the 2010 Icelandic season.
