Vilhjalmsson has played six times for the Iceland senior team

Colchester United are on the verge of signing Iceland international forward Matthias Vilhjalmsson on loan from FH.

He will join the League One side on loan until the end of the Football League season, subject to all the paperwork being cleared.

The 23-year-old, who has played six times for his country, had a trial with the U's in November.

He played for the club in a behind-closed-doors friendly at Championship side Reading on Tuesday.

Vilhjalmsson scored six goals in 21 league appearances for Iceland's top flight side in the 2010 season, which ended in September.

FH vice-president Ludvik Arnarson told BBC Essex last week the move is almost finalised.

"He's a very strong, physical player with very good ball technique, I think his best position is behind the striker or as a second striker," he said.

"I would say he would fit very well into English football."

Colchester manager John Ward revealed he was weighing up an approach for the frontman in December, but added there could be complications.

"It's awkward because it's an international loan and transfer windows are slightly different," he said.

"So it's taking quite a while."
