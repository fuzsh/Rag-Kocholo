        "text": "Compared to other minorities, Jews and anti-Jewish stereotypes remain relatively underresearched in Scandinavia, even though antisemitic stereotypes have been present in the North ever since Christianization. This volume aims to bring the study of antisemitism to the fore, from the Middle Ages to the present day. Contributors from all the Nordic countries describe the status of and the challenges and desiderata for the study of antisemitism. CONTENTS Introduction Cordelia Heß 1.

Bibliography Index LINK https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/510552 SERIES Religious Minorities in the North: History, Politics and Culture 1 The series publishes monographs and collections on the history of religious minorities in all the Nordic countries and their former colonies from the arrival of Christianity to the modern day. RMN takes a wide view of the history of religious minorities and their interactions with each other and the majority society. It promotes scholarship and creates new resources, including source editions, for the study of religious minorities in the North. The volumes encompass various disciplines including the fields of history, theology and religious history as well as literary studies, political science, sociology, social anthropology, and linguistics.\n\nMasculinities are continuously renegotiated, reflecting tensions between various forms of male power. This paper focuses on how events leading up to the international financial crises after 2008 crystallized relationships among different kinds of masculinities, with Iceland as a critical example. To examine the relationships between political and financial elites, we make use of a materialist-discursive approach and Bourdieu's concept of symbolic capital. Data on celebrated men in Icelandic society, primarily based on the Man-of-the-Year Award in Icelandic print media from the 1970s and onward, is analyzed. We discuss the transformation of power and how the media contributes to legitimizing the symbolic capital of certain masculinities. We suggest that the political elite had the upper hand from the 1990s onward but lost their hold prior to the collapse, to the benefit of the business elite. Political masculinity had a short comeback after the collapse. We suggest that the era of strong and decisive political and business masculinities has come to an end in Iceland. Further shifts in masculine power in global capitalism should be researched.\n\nThis is a working paper.

As well as adding a key case-study to research on how writers globally have responded to that crisis, this book is one of the only recent monograph-length examinations of contemporary Icelandic literature, aiming to provide a window for Anglophone readers into Iceland's current literary scene. Chapter 1, 'Opening an account', briefly outlines the history of the Crash in Iceland, discusses key concepts, and outlines the main themes of the book. Chapter 2, 'The crisis of realism', focuses on the handling of high finance in fiction, and particularly the limitations of post-War Western realism when it comes to examining complex social interactions. It explores how one of the main responses to the Crash among Icelandic literary writers, particularly those born in the years around 1980, was pained self-examination. Chapter 3, 'Neomedievalism and a microstate', charts Iceland's post-colonial anxiety about its status in the world, which is perhaps more prominent in Crash-fiction than the Crash itself. It focuses on the use and abuse of medieval and folkloric texts by current fiction-writers and charts changing identities in twenty-first century Iceland, particularly in relation to globalisation, tourism, gender, and Iceland's post-colonial anxieties of identity. Chapter 4, 'Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson, knight of industry', is a case study of writing inspired by the most prominent (though not the most culpable) figure in the boom that preceded the 2008 crash. It focuses on the work of older writers, born around the 1960s, and the ways in which they rewrite Björgólfur Thor's own medievalism to criticise boom-time Icelandic society and its participation in neo-colonialism. Chapter 5, 'Utopianism', seeks finally to examine what ways out of the crisis writers were imagining in the immediate aftermath of the Crash. It focuses on Eiríkur Örn Norðdahl's 2009 novel Gæska. The concluding chapter, 'Interest payments', emphasises that Icelandic Crash-writers have in some ways been ahead of medievalist scholars in thinking about the relationship between traditional, nationalist medievalism and 'neo-medievalist', Islamophobic medievalism. It sketches some of the characteristics of Iceland's literary scene that seem to have been useful to helping it respond to a moment of crisis."
