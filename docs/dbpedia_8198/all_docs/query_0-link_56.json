        "text": "The article constitutes an attempt at developing a new approach to Icelandic national art, supported by an analysis of its role in the process of constructing “Icelandicness” and the Icelandic identity. It enters a dialogue with the study Kryptokoloniale landskaber: tid, sted og rum i billeder af islandsk landskab 1874–2011 by Ann-Sofie Nielsen Gremaud, with a concurrent focus on Icelandic landscape painting of the period 1874–1944 and its relation to Danish art. The Nordic, and especially the Icelandic art was routinely overlooked in the European artistic and historical narration, including the Polish scholarly environment, but it is well worthy of a closer scrutiny. Two fundamental assumptions that define the analysis presented herein are that the modern national art of Iceland derives from the Academic tradition in Denmark and that, concurrently, Icelandic artists participated in the process of developing national identity in opposition to the Danish model. In order to find confi...\n\n\"Artists are peculiar beasts and spirits... No longer are metropolises their Mecca; artists are now descending upon the periphery hosted by members of small communities to create new life and opportunity in their towns via artist residencies, where both artists and hosts orchestrate a durational slow change within the heart of remote Icelandic villages, often rekindling the economies of dwindling hope. In the words of Derrida: \" ​ ...we rediscover the mythopoetical virtue (power) of bricolage. In effect, what appears most fascinating in this critical search for a new status of the discourse is the stated abandonment of all reference to a center, to a subject, to a privileged reference, to an origin, or to an absolute arché. \" Within bricolage, the origin of perception is recaptured; the centre is disseminated. Authority and hierarchies are subject to distant, contorted imaginations as a previous reality twists into new artistic accounts and documentations conceived from deep in the field. The rebellious act of withdrawal and an international 'elsewhere' ethic contributes to a decentralisation of power within the institutional art world and gives flight to new peripheral centres of infamous activity; with a royal finger to the establishment, the periphery almost feels punk.\"\n\nThis article looks at the creation of Iceland's capital, Reykjavík, as an Arctic tourism destination with a focus on souvenir production and consumption. We regard souvenirs to be particularly interesting for investigating the creation and materialization of the Arctic, in the light of how landscapes, in our case the urban landscape of Reykjavík, are constantly performed and narrated through objects. A special attention is given to the Atlantic Puffin that in recent years has become the Icelandic souvenir sine qua non and a veritable symbol for souvenir consumption in Iceland. We explore the urban landscapes of downtown Reykjavík with a focus on puffins in order to introduce the city's tensioned landscapes, especially regarding the complex material composition and meanings of the Atlantic Puffin in order to gain an understanding of its role in shaping the Arctic landscapes of Reykjavík.\n\nThis article looks at the creation of Iceland’s capital, Reykjavík, as an Arctic tourism destination with a focus on souvenir production and consumption.

The two cases are put into context with public discourse on Icelandic design in general, with a particular emphasis on the genre of product design. It discusses the rather recent development of Icelandic design as a cultural commodity, while looking at it as a cultural agent of identity formation. The paper highlights the relationship between product design and souvenir objects and points to issues of the past that seem to prevail, both public discourse and the production of Icelandic contemporary design.\n\nPublished on the occasion of the Nordic Art Association’s seventy-fifth anniversary, this publication is initiated and produced by the Swedish section, and traces some of the association’s activities over many years and across the entire region. The book is both an examination and a celebration of a visual arts organisation from the Nordic region that has aimed at creating collaborative networks between artists since 1945. It includes historical texts and new contributions by researchers and critically engages both with a newly retrieved archive and the Nordic art world at large. The Swedish association’s activities have in recent years primarily gravitated towards the programme of the Nordic Guest Studio. International guests and collaborators share their thoughts on the notion of ‘hospitality’ in the form of a guest book that was collected from CRIS, Curatorial Residency In Stockholm.

In this article, I tease out the parameters that Iceland’s landscape offers for an understanding of the tensions between virtual north and real north. The first part of the article discusses the context of 19th-century antiquarian adventuring to Iceland. Foreign visitors journeyed to Iceland to reconnect with a past that was being lost in the industrializing landscapes of Western Europe. The second part of the article focuses on present-day archaeological surveys of a group of islands in Breiðafjörður, West Iceland. Drawing on a phenomenological approach and a discussion of 19th-century visits to Iceland by travelers, such as William Morris and W. G. Collingwood, the article explores how sagas and other local histories influence the production of archaeological knowledge and placemaking.\n\nThe Icelandic sweater is presented and received as being traditional—even ancient—authentically Icelandic and hand made by Icelandic women from the wool of Icelandic sheep. Even so, the sweater type, the so-called ‘Icelandic sweater’ in English, only dates back to the mid-20th century and is not necessarily made in Iceland nor from indigenous wool. Nevertheless, the sweater is a successful invention of a tradition (Hobsbawm & Ranger, 1983), popular among Icelanders and tourists alike since its introduction in the mid-20th century. It has gained ground as a national symbol, particularly in times of crisis for example in the reconstruction of values in the aftermath of the Icelandic bank collapse of 2008. I traced the development of the discourse about wool and the origins of the Icelandic sweater by looking at publications of the Icelandic National Craft Association, current design discourse in Iceland and its effect on the development of the wool industry. I then tied these factors to notions of tradition, authenticity, national culture, image and souvenirs. Keywords: Lopapeysa / The Icelandic sweater, textiles, souvenir, heritage, image\n\nA museum exhibition communicates meaning at various levels, some more obvious than others. The author of this article spent several weeks at the new permanent exhibition of the National Museum of Iceland, exploring it as a visitor would, and offers a reading of the various meanings that the exhibition conveys, both verbally and non-verbally. Of special interest is the use of everyday objects to convey important themes for the nationalistic agenda of the exhibition."
