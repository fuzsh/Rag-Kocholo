        "text": "Celtic’s Champions League campaign hangs in the balance.\n\nMatthias Vilhjalmsson has told The Daily Mail it was a “delicious feeling” to hear Celtic fans shout at their own players at Parkhead on Wednesday night.\n\nCeltic’s passage to the Champions League playoffs hangs in the balance after Rosenborg held the Scottish giants to a 0-0 draw in Glasgow this week.\n\nBrendan Rodgers’s side were huge favourites to secure a first-leg advantage on what turned out to be a frustrating night for the Hoops, who had no strikers available to them as a result of Leigh Griffiths’s one-match ban and Moussa Dembele’s injury.\n\nParkhead is known for its partisan support during European nights but much of this atmosphere was lacking against the Norwegian side, with The Green Brigade, Celtic’s notorious supporters group, absent due to a two-match ban.\n\n“The atmosphere surprised me. I thought it should have been a lot better. Maybe it was quiet because we played so well,” the Rosenborg striker told The Mail.\n\nCeltic will need their famous support for the return leg in Trondheim next week.\n\nFailing to reach the group stages would represent a massive blow to fans who, of course, got to experience Champions League football last season, with two memorable games against Manchester City.\n\nThey have a taste for it now and it is up to Rodgers to satisfy those urges."
