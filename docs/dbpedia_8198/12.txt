Matthías Vilhjálmsson simply can’t stop scoring for Norwegian 1. division side Start, but he grabbed a double in his team’s 4-0 victory against Alta today.

Vilhjálmsson’s goals came in the 54th and 70th minute of the game, but Start is on the top of the league with 28 points from 13 matches.

The Icelandic international has been one of the league’s best players after joining Start on loan from FH Hafnarfjörður, but another Icelander, Guðmundur Kristjánsson, plays for the same club and played the whole game.

Goalkeeper Haraldur Björnsson was an unused substitute when his team Sarpsborg 08 tied 1-1 with Bodo/Glimt.

Sverrir Gunnarsson was in the starting line-up for Mjondalen when the team won a 2-1 victory against Ranheim.
