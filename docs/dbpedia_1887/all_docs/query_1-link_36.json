The highest chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 46% on January 11.\n\nThe clearest day of the month is January 1, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 57% of the time.\n\nFor reference, on January 11, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 46%, while on August 31, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 74%.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Ibarreta, the chance of a wet day over the course of January is gradually increasing, starting the month at 37% and ending it at 40%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 40% on November 30, and its lowest chance is 9% on August 8.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during January in Ibarreta is essentially constant, remaining about 5.3 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 9.2 inches or falling below 2.2 inches.\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 5.1 inches on January 3.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of January in Ibarreta, the length of the day is gradually decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 25 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 50 seconds, and weekly decrease of 5 minutes, 50 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is January 31, with 13 hours, 16 minutes of daylight and the longest day is January 1, with 13 hours, 41 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Ibarreta is 6:12 AM on January 1 and the latest sunrise is 22 minutes later at 6:34 AM on January 31.\n\nThe latest sunset is 7:54 PM on January 13 and the earliest sunset is 4 minutes earlier at 7:50 PM on January 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is not observed in Ibarreta during 2024.\n\nFor reference, on December 21, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 6:06 AM and sets 13 hours, 43 minutes later, at 7:49 PM, while on June 20, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:44 AM and sets 10 hours, 34 minutes later, at 6:18 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in January in Ibarreta\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in January in IbarretaJan112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMDecFeb00101020202030304040505050606070708080000101020203030304040505060606070708080\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for January 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in January in Ibarreta\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in January in IbarretaJan112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMDecFebDec 128:33 PMDec 128:33 PMDec 269:34 PMDec 269:34 PMJan 118:58 AMJan 118:58 AMJan 252:55 PMJan 252:55 PMFeb 98:00 PMFeb 98:00 PMFeb 249:31 AMFeb 249:31 AM5:22 AM5:22 AM7:46 PM7:46 PM7:55 PM7:55 PM6:22 AM6:22 AM6:07 AM6:07 AM8:31 PM8:31 PM8:12 PM8:12 PM7:05 AM7:05 AM6:03 AM6:03 AM7:55 PM7:55 PM7:24 PM7:24 PM6:47 AM6:47 AM\n\nJan 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 75%-10:59 AMW11:51 PME5:11 AMN251,567 mi 2 67%-11:50 AMW-5:50 AMN251,403 mi 3 57%12:19 AME12:40 PMW-6:29 AMN250,421 mi 4 50%12:47 AME1:31 PMW-7:08 AMN248,615 mi 5 38%1:17 AMESE2:25 PMWSW-7:49 AMN246,045 mi 6 28%1:49 AMESE3:21 PMWSW-8:33 AMN242,849 mi 7 19%2:26 AMESE4:22 PMWSW-9:21 AMN239,235 mi 8 11%3:09 AMESE5:26 PMWSW-10:15 AMS235,480 mi 9 5%4:01 AMESE6:30 PMWSW-11:14 AMS231,907 mi 10 1%5:00 AMESE7:33 PMWSW-12:17 PMS228,851 mi 11 0%6:07 AMESE8:31 PMWSW-1:21 PMS226,602 mi 12 2%7:18 AMESE9:21 PMWSW-2:23 PMN225,350 mi 13 7%8:28 AMESE10:06 PMWSW-3:20 PMN225,150 mi 14 15%9:36 AMESE10:45 PMW-4:13 PMN225,925 mi 15 25%10:40 AME11:21 PMW-5:02 PMN227,501 mi 16 36%11:43 AME11:55 PMW-5:50 PMN229,651 mi 17 47%12:44 PME--6:37 PMN232,145 mi 18 50%-12:30 AMWNW1:45 PMENE7:26 PMN234,783 mi 19 69%-1:07 AMWNW2:46 PMENE8:16 PMN237,413 mi 20 79%-1:47 AMWNW3:48 PMENE9:09 PMN239,938 mi 21 87%-2:31 AMWNW4:49 PMENE10:05 PMN242,306 mi 22 93%-3:20 AMWNW5:48 PMENE11:01 PMN244,493 mi 23 97%-4:14 AMWNW6:42 PMENE11:57 PMN246,486 mi 24 99%-5:11 AMWNW7:30 PMENE-- 25 100%-6:09 AMWNW8:12 PMENE12:50 AMN248,266 mi 26 100%-7:05 AMWNW8:49 PMENE1:39 AMN249,793 mi 27 98%-8:00 AMWNW9:22 PMENE2:25 AMN251,005 mi 28 94%-8:53 AMWNW9:52 PME3:07 AMN251,820 mi 29 89%-9:43 AMW10:20 PME3:47 AMN252,138 mi 30 82%-10:33 AMW10:48 PME4:26 AMN251,860 mi 31 74%-11:24 AMW11:16 PME5:04 AMN250,900 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Ibarreta is gradually increasing during January, rising from 72% to 77% over the course of the month.\n\nThe highest chance of a muggy day during January is 78% on January 26.\n\nFor reference, on January 26, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 78% of the time, while on August 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 2% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in January in Ibarreta\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Ibarreta is essentially constant during January, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 6.8 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on September 7, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.4 miles per hour, while on March 18, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.4 miles per hour.\n\nThe lowest daily average wind speed during January is 6.6 miles per hour on January 11.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Ibarreta throughout January is predominantly from the east, with a peak proportion of 45% on January 1.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nTemperatures in Ibarreta are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms. We nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in January in Ibarreta\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Ibarreta are very rapidly increasing during January, increasing by 932Â°F, from 4,183Â°F to 5,116Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Ibarreta is essentially constant during January, remaining within 0.1 kWh of 7.1 kWh throughout.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Ibarreta are -25.214 deg latitude, -59.859 deg longitude, and 351 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Ibarreta is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 36 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 357 feet. Within 10 miles is also essentially flat (79 feet). Within 50 miles is essentially flat (220 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Ibarreta is covered by shrubs (51%), trees (24%), cropland (14%), and grassland (10%), within 10 miles by trees (69%) and shrubs (22%), and within 50 miles by trees (86%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Ibarreta, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Ibarreta.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Ibarreta according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Ibarreta is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, in addition to a contribution from the MERRA-2 reconstruction, corrected for the difference between the reference elevation of the MERRA-2 grid cell and the elevation of Ibarreta.\n\nThe station weights are proportional to the inverse of the distance between Ibarreta and a given station.\n\nThe weight assigned to the MERRA-2 value depends on the distance from Ibarreta to the nearest station, increasing from 0% at 150 kilometers to 100% at 200 kilometers. In this case, the MERRA-2 weight is 40%.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nPresidencia Roque SÃ¡enz PeÃ±a Airport (SARS, 32%, 114 mi, south, -46 ft elevation change)\n\nFormosa Aerodrome (SARF, 28%, 123 mi, southeast, -157 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Ibarreta and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
