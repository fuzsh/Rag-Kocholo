        "meta_description": "Abstract. The Mediterranean Basin is one of the regions most affected by climate change, which poses significant challenges to agricultural efficiency and food security. While rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation levels already impose great risks, the effects of compound extreme events (CEEs) can be significantly more severe and amplify the risk. It is therefore of high importance to assess these risks under climate change on a regional level to implement efficient adaption strategies. This study focuses on false-spring events (FSEs), which impose a high risk of crop losses during the beginning of the vegetation growing period, as well as heatâdrought compound events (HDCEs) in summer, for a high-impact future scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)Â 8.5). The results for 2070â2099 are compared to 1970â1999. In addition, deviations of the near-surface atmospheric state under FSEs and HDCEs are investigated to improve the predictability of these events. We apply a multivariate, trend-conserving bias correction method (MBCn) accounting for temporal coherency between the inspected variables derived from the European branch of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX). This method proves to be a suitable choice for the assessment of percentile-threshold-based CEEs. The results show a potential increase in frequency of FSEs for large portions of the study domain, especially impacting later stages of the warming period, caused by disproportionate changes in the behavior of warm phases and frost events. Frost events causing FSEs predominantly occur under high-pressure conditions and northerly to easterly wind flow. HDCEs are projected to significantly increase in frequency, intensity, and duration, mostly driven by dry, continental air masses. This intensification is several times higher than that of the univariate components. This study improves our understanding of the unfolding of climate change in the Mediterranean and shows the need for further, locally refined investigations and adaptation strategies.",

        "text": "The latest assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the current climate status has yet again made strikingly clear that human actions have significantly impacted weather and climate on a global scale and continue to do so (Eyring etÂ al.,Â 2021). Among the most significant impacts of ongoing climate change is the intensification of extreme events, especially in terms of temperature and precipitation (Seneviratne etÂ al.,Â 2021). These changes are projected to include not only a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of heat-related extremes, as well as intensified heavy-precipitation events, but also an amplified risk of agricultural drought. Additional consequences of human-induced global warming include negative impacts on agriculture. As stated by BeznerÂ Kerr etÂ al. (2022), there is high confidence that climate change is imposing stress on, among others things, agriculture and forestry. Furthermore, the authors point out that extreme events significantly impair food security and that heat and drought are among the main drivers exacerbating the risk of production losses.\n\nWhile our general understanding of these changes is high on a global level, the level of confidence in these projections varies on a regional to local level. Giorgi (2006) conducted an investigation of regions with the highest exposure to the effects of climate change (climate change âHot-Spotsâ) and demonstrated that the Mediterranean, which includes southern Europe as well as parts of northern Africa and western Asia, is one of the two most vulnerable regions worldwide. As this region is characterized by a high population density and high socioeconomic importance, the effects of climate change must be monitored closely to enable suitable protective and mitigative measures.\n\nTo assess the potential effects of climate change, general circulation models (GCMs) have been extensively used in the past. These models, driven on a global basis, are capable of providing large-scale information on changes in atmospheric predictors, although their spatial resolution is generally low. While GCMs are able to provide reasonable results under specific circumstances, the quality of GCM output proves to be too low to be applied on a sub-global scale (DiÂ Virgilio etÂ al.,Â 2022; Yang and Villarini,Â 2021; Wang etÂ al.,Â 2021; Hardiman etÂ al.,Â 2008). To improve the quality of these projections, regional climate models (RCMs) driven by the GCM output can be consulted by conducting simulations on a regional to local level and in a higher temporal and spatial resolution (Giorgi,Â 2019). While this procedure, also known as dynamical downscaling, can improve the quality of climate projections, systematic model bias may still be inherited, originating from both the GCM and the RCM (Eden etÂ al.,Â 2012). To overcome this limitation, the inherited bias from climate models can be statistically corrected according to a reference data set of a higher quality. This method is referred to as bias correction and can, for example, be performed using station observations, satellite data, or reanalysis. As Cannon (2018), Vrac and Friederichs (2015), and Gudmundsson etÂ al. (2012) have proven, performing statistical bias correction can significantly reduce deviations of one or multiple predictors from a reference data set and therefore improve the reliability of climate projections.\n\nCompound extreme events (CEEs) have moved more and more into scientific focus, as the joint effects of multiple hazards may surpass those of univariate extremes (Zscheischler etÂ al.,Â 2020). In the context of extreme events potentially exacerbating risks to agriculture, water availability, and food security (BeznerÂ Kerr etÂ al.,Â 2022), high demand for robust projections of CEEs in regions with a high vulnerability regarding these aspects becomes evident. Therefore, this study aims at investigating two types of compound event with detrimental effects on agriculture and vegetation in the Greater Mediterranean Region (GMR), a global climate change hot spot. The types of CEEs analyzed in this study include false-spring events (FSEs), which are defined as a freezing event occurring after the start of the crop-related growing season (SGS) (Ault etÂ al.,Â 2013; Gu etÂ al.,Â 2008). Freezing during this highly vulnerable period in the early stages of plant development may cause significant damage, resulting in yield loss or failure. Recently, FSEs have been investigated mostly in moderate mid-latitudinal climate zones. For example, disproportionate changes of the last day of frost (LDF) during spring and the SGS have been shown for central Europe (Vitasse etÂ al.,Â 2018; Zohner etÂ al.,Â 2016) and the United States (Peterson and Abatzoglou,Â 2014). Chen etÂ al. (2021) demonstrated a negative correlation between the SGS date and mean air temperature over temperate China, indicating an earlier SGS under warmer conditions. Therefore, if the risk of spring freezing events does not proportionally decline, the risk of FSEs increases (Labe etÂ al.,Â 2017; Inouye,Â 2008; Gu etÂ al.,Â 2008). Less focus has been put on subtropical climate zones, where the risk of frost events is considerably lower than in moderate climate zones. However, as the GMR is characterized by complex topography, with high mountain ridges adjoining wide lowlands that represent a transition zone between the GMR and coolâtemperate central Europe, the effects of freezing conditions may potentially reach out to the subtropical parts of the domain. A variety of methods to estimate the LDF and SGS exist. One example is to collect and assess crop-specific empirical data, where specific thresholds for freezing and growing conditions can be taken into account (Chamberlain etÂ al.,Â 2019). This is often applied in regionalized studies or for specific plant species. In terms of heatâdrought compound events (HDCEs), many studies have investigated historical periods and demonstrated an increasing trend regarding the frequency and intensity of HDCEs (Ionita etÂ al.,Â 2021; Vogel etÂ al.,Â 2021). Fewer studies have investigated whether these changes will be persistent under future climates. For example, Ruffault etÂ al. (2020) demonstrated that heatâdrought-related weather conditions favoring the ignition of wildfires are likely increased under climate change.\n\nIn this study, we aim at presenting a large-scale overview of the potential of FSEs occurring in the GMR. Therefore, we apply a simplified method derived from Peterson and Abatzoglou (2014) and Leeper etÂ al. (2021) that uses generalized thermal thresholds to determine the LDF and SGS. In terms of HDCEs, we adopt an approach by Ionita etÂ al. (2021), using the 3-monthly Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-3) for drought indexing and percentile-based thresholds for daily maximum temperature. By conducting this study, we seek to increase our knowledge of how the effects of global warming will unfold in terms of FSEs and HDCEs in the GMR, regarding both the frequency and the duration of these events.\n\nBesides the projected changes in FSEs and HDCEs, we also investigated the deviations of crucial near-surface atmospheric predictors from the mean state during these events in order to improve our level of knowledge on what conditions act favorably towards the occurrence of FSEs and HDCEs. Similar works have been done by Ionita etÂ al. (2021) and Mastrantonas etÂ al. (2021), who investigated connections between extreme and compound events and large-scale atmospheric patterns. The inclusion of weather patterns, however, is aggravated in the context of multivariate bias correction, as the conservation of spatial and temporal coherence of multiple variables requires a significantly higher computational effort (Cannon,Â 2018). By considering sea level pressure as well as zonalÂ (u) and meridionalÂ (v) wind speeds in an only temporally coherent bias correction setup, we seek to reduce computational cost while preserving the ability to assess the origin of air masses and estimate pressure deviations under FSEs and HDCEs.\n\nTo obtain these results, we apply a multivariate bias correction method based on the N-dimensional probability density function transform (MBCn) presented by Cannon (2018). A total of 13 GCMâRCM combinations were obtained from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), as well as ERA5 data as the reference for the bias correction procedure. We inspect a late-century future period (2070â2099) under the high-impact Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario 8.5 and compare the results to 1970â1999. The choice of scenario was made to demonstrate potential changes in FSEs and HDCEs on the higher end of the range of emission scenarios (Riahi etÂ al.,Â 2011). These research questions are addressed in the following sections:\n\na.\n\nTo what extent can the quality of climate model output be improved, in the context of reproducing threshold-based metrics for a multivariate and interdependent task?\n\nb.\n\nAre FSEs relevant in the GMR, and how is their occurrence projected to change towards the end of the 21stÂ century? What deviations in the near-surface atmospheric state are connected with FSEs?\n\nc.\n\nHow will the frequency, intensity, and duration of HDCEs change towards the end of the 21stÂ century? What deviations in the near-surface atmospheric state are connected with HDCEs?\n\nd.\n\nWhat implications will the projected changes in FSEs and HDCEs potentially have for vegetation and crop efficiency?\n\nThe use of dynamically downscaled climate model output offers several advantages over the output of general circulation models, foremost a higher spatial and temporal resolution, as well as a higher data accuracy. However, as the results of this study prove for the GMR, a high amount of bias remains in the output of RCMs when compared to state-of-the-art reanalysis data. This bias varies for different variables and is dependent on the underlying GCM and RCM, but it is not distinguishable whether the choice of GCM or RCM contributes more bias. With one exception, temperatures are underestimated in the raw model output, which is in line with former experiences with CORDEX output (Dosio etÂ al.,Â 2022; Top etÂ al.,Â 2021). Precipitation sums, on the other hand, show an almost equal number of over- and underestimating models. However, the magnitude of the bias is higher for models with an overestimation of the precipitation sum. Reasons for the over- and underestimation of precipitation, including the âdrizzleÂ effectâ, have been discussed before, e.g.,Â by Chen etÂ al. (2021), Demory etÂ al. (2020), and DeMott etÂ al. (2007). A bias is present in both the climatology of daily data, i.e.,Â percentiles, and the long-term climatology. After applying QDM, both aforementioned forms of bias are removed to a significant degree, resulting in nearly zero bias in terms of percentiles and minimal deviations in long-term climatology, depending on the selected GCMâRCM combination and variable. Therefore, and by preserving the dependence structure of multiple corrected variables, MBCn proves to be a suitable choice for assessing percentile-threshold-based compound events. The performance of several different multivariate bias correction methods could be evaluated in follow-up studies, similarly to what has been done before for univariate correction methods applied to CORDEX (Olschewski etÂ al.,Â 2023; Laux etÂ al.,Â 2021). An additional limitation of this study lies in the choice of reference data. While ERA5 is proven to be a suitable state-of-the-art reference for temperature and precipitation (Lavers etÂ al.,Â 2022; Mistry etÂ al.,Â 2022; Velikou etÂ al.,Â 2022; Hassler and Lauer,Â 2021), some level of uncertainty regarding extreme events remains, especially for precipitation. When conducting local refinement of the presented results in potential follow-up studies, additional reference data sets, including station-based observations, could be compared to further improve the robustness of the projections.\n\nThe disproportionate behavior of the LDF and the SGS shown in this study has also been demonstrated, for example, for the United States (Allstadt etÂ al.,Â 2015; Peterson and Abatzoglou,Â 2014; Marino etÂ al.,Â 2011). These authors conclude that FSE-related risk varies significantly for different regions. In this context, Chamberlain etÂ al. (2021) discuss potential reasons for the large regional variability, including elevation (Vitasse etÂ al.,Â 2018) and distance from the sea (Ma etÂ al.,Â 2019). The findings of this study also demonstrate these two drivers as decisive when determining the potential future risk of FSEs. However, the nature of the projected change is also strongly dependent on the selected SGS threshold. Regarding the SGS, the presented thresholds are strictly based on atmospheric temperatures and do not include data on, for example, soil temperatures and observations of vegetation. Apart from highly elevated regions, where the onset of the growing season is generally later in the year, the three selected thermal thresholds for the SGS are proven in this study to represent three different sections within the warming period between January and June. This offers a benefit for a future refinement of the presented results, for example for specific crops with specific thermal characteristics referring to one of the sections. However the broad nature of the thermal definitions still imposes a limitation on the results of this study. A more sophisticated approach, e.g.,Â including crop-related modeling or crop-specific thresholds of budburst and freezing damage, for example, discussed by Allstadt etÂ al. (2015) and Chamberlain etÂ al. (2019), may lead to increased preciseness and applicability for practitioners. On the other hand, this study aims to provide a general overview of the potential risk of FSEs within a large domain that has not been previously closely investigated in this regard. This was done using simplified and straightforward thermal definitions. This study proves the spatial resolution to be sufficient to distinguish regional characteristics of FSEs. In terms of agricultural applications on a local level, where crop-specific metrics and local climate characteristics gain in importance, the presented results may be the starting point of local refinement.\n\nThe results regarding the atmospheric deviations under FSEs are in line with our general understanding of climatology in the study domain, and this especially applies to the low-lying areas. During spring, air masses originating from westerly and southerly directions are more and more likely to cause warm conditions, as the level of warming closely follows the northward shift of the subtropical ridge (see Sect.Â 2). However, especially when high-pressure conditions cause clear skies and the nights are still long, a high level of outgoing longwave radiation over land masses causes temperature levels to decrease. Under easterly flows, which this study proves to be predominant under FSEs, these cooled air masses are forced into the study domain and increase the risk of frost events. In a recent study for Europe, Quesada etÂ al. (2023) determined the advection of northerly to easterly air masses to be crucial drivers of cold waves over Europe. These results can be directly linked to the findings of this study, increasing the predictability of FSEs. Over mountainous areas, the predominant winds differ, indicating flows from the mountain ridges towards the lowland. In general, descending air masses are linked to dissolving cloud coverage, resulting in clear skies. As described above, the longwave outgoing radiation can therefore not be retained in the lower atmosphere, contributing to low near-surface temperatures and the occurrence of FSEs. On the other hand, for example, under foehn conditions, descending air masses on the leeward side of a mountain ridge may be linked to warm conditions (Jansing etÂ al.,Â 2022) and therefore contradict the results of this study. To gain further insights into the local conditions caused by the large-scale atmospheric steer flow, additional vertical layers of atmospheric flow that are less sensitive to local orography, e.g.,Â the 500âhPa layer, could be assessed in further studies. For this study, we specifically focused on the near-surface atmospheric conditions, as these are most relevant in the context of crops. A similar gain may also be achieved by considering circulation patterns, for example, based on Jenkinson and Collison (1977) or Hess and Brezowsky (James,Â 2007). However, the application of large-scale circulation patterns is aggravated in the context of multivariate bias correction, as the spatial coherence, alongside the temporal coherence, of all variables must be preserved for the entire study domain. As Cannon (2018) pointed out, this is, in general, possible for MBCn. However, considering the size of the study domain, the additional consideration of spatial coherence required a significantly higher computational effort that was not available within the means of this study.\n\nThe nature of compound extreme events including heat and drought over Europe and the GMR has been extensively studied for historical periods (Vogel etÂ al.,Â 2021; Ionita etÂ al.,Â 2021; DeÂ Luca etÂ al.,Â 2020; Russo etÂ al.,Â 2019). The results presented in this study embody the continuation of the historical trend of increasing HDCEs that all former studies share. Inspecting the relevant variables independently already shows the tendency of each variable to favor the occurrence of HDCEs in the future. As described above, the projected increase in daily maximum temperature for the spatial mean causes extremes exceeding the 99thÂ percentile to be 15Â times more likely. However, as a majority of regions show the potential for persistent drought during summer (JJA), the projected change in the occurrence rate of HDCEs is several times higher. To further increase the robustness of these projections, additional metrics and thresholds to define heat and drought could be considered in a follow-up study.\n\nThe aggravated risk of compounding extremes has, for example, been indicated by Zscheischler etÂ al. (2018). The potential effects of the projected changes in heat and drought behavior are diverse. An increased risk of crop failure, for example, has been shown by He etÂ al. (2022) on a global level and by Ribeiro etÂ al. (2020) for a Mediterranean domain. While it must be noted that crop failure risk is highly dependent on the crop type and local climate factors, accumulated drought and heat nevertheless have negative impacts on the amount of water available for irrigation. Apart from agricultural aspects and natural ecosystems, the projected level of warming will significantly impact human health and mortality (Raymond etÂ al.,Â 2020; Gasparrini etÂ al.,Â 2015). The impact of increased temperatures is also shown to be aggravated in highly urbanized areas (Merkenschlager etÂ al.,Â 2023) and further amplifies socioeconomic disparities (Hsu etÂ al.,Â 2021).\n\nThe results of this study depict that below-average sea level pressure conditions and predominantly northeasterly to easterly flows are accompanied by HDCEs. A reason for below-average pressure could be near-surface thermal lows induced by intense surface warming, as previously described by Lavaysse etÂ al. (2016) and Hoinka and Castro (2003). This, in combination with the advection of dry, continental air masses from eastern Europe, may be crucial for the occurrence of HDCEs. The limitations in terms of drawing conclusions on the large-scale atmospheric circulation, as discussed above, similarly apply to HDCEs. While the results clearly depict significantly differing conditions during HDCEs and offer benefits regarding the predictability of these events, a follow-up study including circulation patterns could improve the quality of these predictions even more. This also applies to the mountainous regions, which show different characteristics during HDCEs than the surrounding lowlands. For both FSEs and HDCEs, the climate projections show an intensification of the pressure anomalies. For FSEs, the already above-average conditions show a projected increase in deviation from the current mean atmospheric state. For HDCEs, there is a less clear picture, although more regions show below-average conditions for historical HDCEs. This below-average deviation is amplified in the future projections for a majority of regions in the study domain. Whether centers of action (Osman etÂ al.,Â 2021) and related blocking systems will intensify in the future is subject to the scientific discourse, as discussed by Kautz etÂ al. (2022).\n\nAllstadt, A.Â J., Vavrus, S.Â J., Heglund, P.Â J., Pidgeon, A.Â M., Thogmartin, W.Â E., and Radeloff, V.Â C.: Spring plant phenology and false springs in the conterminous US during the 21st century, Environ.
