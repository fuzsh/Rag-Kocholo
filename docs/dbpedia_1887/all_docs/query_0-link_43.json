The simultaneous occurrence of extreme events gained more and more attention from scientific research in the last couple of years.\nCompared to the occurrence of single extreme events, co-occurring or compound extremes may substantially increase risks.\nTo adequately address such risks, improving our understanding of compound flood events in Europe is necessary and requires reliable estimates of their probability of occurrence together with potential future changes.\nIn this study compound flood events in northern and central Europe were studied using a Monte Carlo-based approach that avoids the use of copulas.\nSecond, we investigate if the number of observed compound extreme events is within the expected range of 2Â standard deviations of randomly occurring compound events. This includes variations of several parameters to test the stability of the identified patterns. Finally, we analyse if the observed compound extreme events had a common large-scale meteorological driver.\nThe results of our investigation show that rivers along the west-facing coasts of Europe experienced a\nhigher amount of compound flood events than expected by pure chance.\nIn these regions, the vast majority of the observed compound flood events seem to be related to the cyclonic westerly general weather pattern (GroÃwetterlage).",

        "text": "Coastal flooding is one of the most frequent, expensive, and fatal natural disasters. In the US alone, it dealt USDâ199Â billion in flood damages from 1988 to 2017 according to Davenport etÂ al. (2021). For Europe, Vousdoukas etÂ al. (2018) projected an increase in annual costs caused by coastal floods of up to USDâ1Â trillion in 2100 for Representative Concentration PathwayÂ 8.5 (RCP8.5). Furthermore, more than 600Â million people live in coastal areas that are less than 10âm above sea level and less than 100âkm from the shore (United Nations,Â 2017; McGranahan etÂ al.,Â 2007). Drivers for floods are storm surges, waves, tides, precipitation, and high river discharge (Paprotny etÂ al.,Â 2020). The area of the river in which two or more of these drivers influence the water level are called transition zones (Bilskie and Hagen,Â 2018). Additionally, floods can also be the result of failures of critical infrastructure like hydropower dams or flood defences (European Commission and Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, ECHO,Â 2021).\n\nThe IPCC special report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) defined compound events as\n\n(1)Â two or more extreme events occurring simultaneously or successively, (2)Â combinations of extreme events with underlying conditions that amplify the impact of the events, or (3)Â combinations of events that are not themselves extremes but lead to an extreme event or impact when combined. The contributing events can be of similar (clustered multiple events) or different type(s) (Seneviratne etÂ al.,Â 2012).\n\nA more general definition was proposed byÂ Leonard etÂ al. (2014), who defined it as âan extreme impact that depends on multiple statistically dependent variables or eventsâ. This study focuses on compound flood events that occur when large runoff from, for example, heavy precipitation, leading to extreme river discharge, is combined with high sea level (storm surge). Because it is not possible to take local properties like topography into account, we will denote these âpotential compound flood eventsâ as âcompound flood eventsâ in the following text for the sake of readability.\n\nThe occurrence of extreme discharge and storm surge events either simultaneously or in close succession can lead to severe damage, which greatly exceeds the damage those events would cause separately (deÂ Ruiter etÂ al.,Â 2020; Xu etÂ al.,Â 2022). Several studies conducted over previous years have shown the importance and catastrophic nature of compound flood events for various locations. One example is the flooding of Jacksonville (Florida) where the surge caused by the strong winds of Hurricane Irma stalled the fluvial discharge (Juarez etÂ al.,Â 2022). Considering data from 1901â2014 and gauges from northwestern Europe, Ganguli and Merz (2019) found opposing trends in the magnitude of compound flood events depending on the latitude of the gauge. They reported increases at midlatitudes (47 to 60ââN) and decreases for gauges at high latitude (>â60ââN). Svensson and Jones (2002) analysed the dependence of high sea surge, river flow, and precipitation in the UK. They found a higher number of compound flood events on the western coast than on the eastern coast, while Paprotny etÂ al. (2020) demonstrated that hydrodynamic models are capable of identifying real-world compound flood events in northwestern Europe. Many studies found that the assumption of independence between drivers leads to an underestimation of the occurrence rate of compound events.\n\nIn addition to the large-scale studies mentioned above, a large number of studies exist that focus on smaller regions. Examples are the studies of vanÂ den Hurk etÂ al. (2015) and Santos etÂ al. (2021a), which both analysed a near flood event in the Netherlands in January 2012, which was caused by a combination of extreme weather conditions. Additionally, there have been studies modelling compound flood events in rivers on a local scale such as for the Zengwen River basin in Taiwan by Chen and Liu (2014), the Shoalhaven River in Australia by Kumbier etÂ al. (2018), and the Min River in China by Lian etÂ al. (2013).\n\nA direct comparison between different studies is hampered by the use of different approaches, data, analysis periods, and other factors. There are currently no established standards for detecting extreme events. For example, the thresholds for extreme events were calculated by utilising the return period (Bevacqua etÂ al.,Â 2019), utilising a certain number of events per year (Hendry etÂ al.,Â 2019; Ganguli etÂ al.,Â 2020), or utilising a percentile approach (Paprotny etÂ al.,Â 2018a). Other studies chose block maxima to detect extreme events (Engeland etÂ al.,Â 2004). The exact parameters are chosen nearly arbitrarily by the authors, with the only common goal being a low number of events so that they can be declared as âextremeâ. Nonetheless, there have been some studies that investigated the sensitivity of their results. Zheng etÂ al. (2014) compared three classes of statistical methods and found that the point process method overestimated the dependence of extremes while the conditional method underestimated it. In a similar vein, Jane etÂ al. (2022) assessed that their estimates of the potential for compound events were highly sensitive to the statistical model setup. Basically, all studies found a correlation between drivers to a certain extent.\n\nThe influence of climate change on the frequency of compound flood events in Europe has been investigated by different studies. The increasing sea level due to climate change and higher occurrence of strong precipitation pose an increasing threat to important economic centres around the world and the people living there (MÃ¼ller and Sacco,Â 2021). Feyen etÂ al. (2020) projected that in the event of a high-emissions scenario, the damages caused by floods would represent a considerable proportion of some countries' national gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of the century. Studies that investigated the effect of climate change on compound flood events focused on various regions of interest, for example, Bevacqua etÂ al. (2019) on all of Europe, Poschlod etÂ al. (2020) on Norway, BermÃºdez etÂ al. (2021) on the rivers Mandeo and Mendo in Spain, and Ganguli etÂ al. (2020) on northwestern Europe. Bevacqua etÂ al. (2019, 2020) reported a strong increase in the occurrence rate of compound flooding events for the future, especially for northern Europe, mainly due to the stronger precipitation as the result of a warmer atmosphere carrying more moisture. Contrarily, Ganguli etÂ al. (2020) reported a lower risk of compound flooding due to a lower dependence between surges and river discharge peaks.\n\nMany studies utilised multivariate extreme value theory and copulas to describe the data distribution of two or more time series and investigate the dependence between extreme events (Hao etÂ al.,Â 2018). In climate research, the amount of available data points is often very small, with many studies operating at merely 30 extreme events. This can cause large uncertainties when trying to evaluate the tail dependence of the distribution (Serinaldi,Â 2013; Joe,Â 2014). An alternative approach is based on Monte Carlo simulations where the dependence between joint extremes is studied by randomly rearranging one of the time series. Given our small sample size, in the following we used such an approach to avoid the uncertainties associated with the use of copulas in small samples.\n\nIn the present study, we analyse compound flood events by focusing on the question of whether they occur more often than by pure coincidence. Utilising several available large-scale data sets allowed us to conduct this analysis for northern and central Europe, instead of focusing on a single river. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate if spatial patterns occur and if they are caused by one common meteorological driver. To achieve this, we implemented a simple statistical method that avoids the application of copulas. For this, we randomised our data sets in a bootstrap process and investigated the number of compound extreme events in them, which resulted in a probability distribution in case of independence. Rivers with a number of observed compound extreme events outside of the 95â% confidence interval of 2Â standard deviations might have a common large-scale driver. Similar studies have so far only been carried out by vanÂ den Hurk etÂ al. (2015) for the Lauwersmeer in the Netherlands and by Poschlod etÂ al. (2020) for Norway (in this case covering rain on snow events). To our knowledge, this will be the first recent publication investigating compound flooding in northern Europe without the use of copulas. For this, we utilised discharge and sea level data sets that were simulated based on reanalysis and hindcast data. Moreover, we investigated the robustness of the spatial patterns in our results by modifying various parameters of our method, like the thresholds for determining extreme events. Additionally, we investigated potential correlations between a river's catchment size and the number of compound flood events that occur. Finally, we examined possible drivers that could cause the occurrence of compound flood events.\n\nThe first step in determining extreme events is to define which events are considered to be extreme. There are ways to use automatic threshold approaches for detecting extreme events, like the goodness-of-fit pÂ value (Solari etÂ al.,Â 2017) or the characteristics of extrapolated significant wave heights (Liang etÂ al.,Â 2019), but they struggle due to the diverse characteristics in the time series of drivers that cause coastal floods (Camus etÂ al.,Â 2021). River-specific thresholds are only feasible for case studies that can take the local properties, like flood protection or elevation of the surrounding area, into account. Therefore, a more general approach is needed that is applicable to all rivers. As described in Sect.Â 1, there is so far no standardised method that is generally used. Quite the contrary, every study uses its own modus operandi, each having individual reasoning for their choice.\n\nOne option is utilising block maxima for extreme event detection (Gumbel,Â 1958), which provides a well-spaced distribution of extreme events, e.g. one event per year, meaning one annual maximum event. However, it can miss out on events with high values, in case several events happen in the same year (Santos etÂ al.,Â 2021b), while also labelling lower values as extreme in years without any major events.\n\nWe, therefore, chose the peaks-over-threshold (Pickands,Â 1975) method to select extreme events by using percentiles, like in the works of Rantanen etÂ al. (2021), Fang etÂ al. (2021), Lai etÂ al. (2021), Ward etÂ al. (2018), and Ridder etÂ al. (2018). While using the peaks-over-threshold method, it is important to ensure the independence of the events. It has to be prevented that, for example, a single day that slightly drops under the thresholds creates two separate events (Harley,Â 2017). A critical element in the analysis is the definition of a de-clustering window such that subsequent events can be considered independent. A frequently used window size is based, for example, on the typical duration of storms in the area (e.g. Harley,Â 2017; Camus etÂ al.,Â 2021). Here, we chose a de-clustering time of 3âd as used in other studies spanning larger domains (e.g. Bevacqua etÂ al.,Â 2019; Ward etÂ al.,Â 2018; Haigh etÂ al.,Â 2016).\n\nExtreme events should be rare by definition, regardless of the river size, therefore only occurring scarcely throughout the year. This especially prevents the accidental analysis of events that are normally not considered extreme. On the other hand, the choice of our threshold needed to take the limited data availability into account. Hence, we were forced to choose our thresholds low enough to ensure that enough points were available for robust statistical analysis. The number of extreme discharge events can vary strongly depending on the river itself. Large rivers like the Elbe show the tendency of having very long extreme events that can last for several weeks, therefore resulting in a lower number of independent extreme events for a specified quantile threshold. Smaller rivers, however, have usually rather short extreme events and consequently a larger number of independent extremes for the same quantile threshold. While this specific approach might result in nominally different numbers of extreme events for each river, it ensures that for each river the same amount of data points exceed the threshold. Sea level also exhibits variations in event duration, albeit to a lesser extent. For the discharge of rivers we chose the 90th percentile Q90 and for the sea level the 99th percentile S99.\n\nTo test the influence of the extreme event definition on possible patterns, we additionally implemented an automatic threshold tuning that modifies the percentiles and the subsequent thresholds in such a way that they result in an average of two extreme events per year. This was done to test in Sect.Â 4.2 if our results remain stable under much stricter definitions of extreme events. Moreover, the threshold tuning results in an average return period of 0.5 years for extreme discharge and sea level events since the return period can be defined as\n\n(1) RP = L E ,\n\nwhere RP denotes the return period, L the duration of the data set in years, and E the number of extreme events.\n\nAnother factor we had to take into account is the so-called lag, which characterises the temporal delay between variables reacting to the same meteorological event. Such lag can occur; for example, if a storm approaches a coast, it generates increased sea level due to stronger winds, before travelling inland where it causes higher amounts of discharge due to precipitation. Most studies, e.g. Hendry etÂ al. (2019), tested a variety of ranges like Â±5âd, while Ganguli etÂ al. (2020) calculated the delay based on the catchment size of the river.\n\nThere is a valid argument made by Ward etÂ al. (2018) that the delay can put high stress on the flood protection systems if the initial flood water cannot retreat fast enough before the discharge occurs. Due to the large area of our study, it is impossible to quantify the potential consequences of ongoing floods on the coastal protection system for each river. Hence, we decided to focus on joint occurrences of extreme events without any additional lag. Despite that, we tested our results in Sect.Â 4.2 for a lag of 3âd to investigate potential influences on our results. In our case, we used the lag as a temporal search radius around the discharge extreme event rather than a shift of the time series itself.\n\nTo identify rivers that show a higher number of compound flood events than expected by pure chance, we utilised a Monte Carlo approach. Other studies in the past also utilised data permutation; see, for example, Svensson and Jones (2002), Zheng etÂ al. (2013), and Nasr etÂ al. (2021). Rivers with this behaviour might indicate a common large-scale driver that causes extreme discharge and sea level at the same time. For example, Hendry etÂ al. (2019) found that the compound events on the west coast of Great Britain have a different meteorological background than those on the east coast. A randomisation method was used to disrupt possible correlations between the data sets and see how the number of compound flood events changes in the case of independent data. First, we limited the time frame of the data sets to the late fall and entire winter season, as storm surges mostly occur in the winter season in northern Europe; see, for example, (Liu etÂ al.,Â 2022). For the winter season, we used a time frame from December to February, such as also done by Robins etÂ al. (2021). At the same time, most discharge events are also limited to the winter and early spring seasons. Neglecting this seasonality would naturally lead to false-positive dependencies since seasonal events would be spread throughout the entire year instead of being mostly limited to their own season. As a result, we would see a much lower number of compound flood events in the non-randomised data, therefore suggesting a false dependence (Couasnon etÂ al.,Â 2020).\n\nAfterwards, we determined the number of compound flood events by counting the joint occurrence of extreme events in the discharge and sea level data. To deal with the differing duration of discharge events, we counted the occurrence of multiple separate sea level extreme events during the same discharge event as separate compound flood events.\n\nAfter determining the number of compound flood events in the original data sets, we prepared the randomisation of the sea level data. For this, we made sure that events were not split up by grouping data points of the same event together before the shuffling process. This was done to not artificially increase the number of extreme events by separating events that consist of more than a single data point. Every data point that was not an extreme event was put into its own group as the only member. The shuffling process of the groups with NumPy (Harris etÂ al.,Â 2020) assigned every group a weight based on the number of data points inside each group. After the shuffling process, the groups were disbanded and formed a randomised data set based on the new order. Afterwards, we performed the de-clustering process again to ensure that extreme event data points in close proximity were counted as a single event. Then we calculated the number of compound flood events for the combination of discharge data and randomised sea level data. This bootstrap process was repeated 10â000Â times for each river, giving a probability distribution for each of them. The resulting probability distribution was used to determine if the initially observed number of compound flood events is within the 95â% confidence interval of 2Â standard deviations (2Ï).\n\nTo test the robustness of our results in Sect.Â 4.2, we also created an additional randomisation approach by randomly shuffling the order of the winter months throughout the sea level data. This method was easier to implement than the one used for the main analysis. For further testing, we utilised different combinations of data sets to investigate their influence on our results. Finally, we used two different time frames to see if climate change or the choice of time period have an influence on possible spatial patterns.\n\nThe domains of all catchments, regions, and seas that we mention by name for various reasons in this study can be seen in Fig.Â 1.\n\nIn the present study, we conducted a coherent spatial analysis on the dependence of storm surges and discharge extreme events as drivers of compound flood events over northern Europe. For this analysis, we introduced a method to analyse compound events by randomising one of the data sets to generate independent data. To our knowledge, this is the first study on compound flood events over all of Europe that does not utilise copulas. As mentioned in the introduction, copulas add unknown amounts of uncertainty to the analysis. Our method on the other hand is easy to implement, and the uncertainty is given by the standard deviation. One limitation of this method is that it cannot quantify the dependence between discharge and sea level.\n\nUsing different data sets of daily discharge and sea level, we detected a distinct pattern of westward-facing coasts having a higher number of compound flood events than expected by chance (Figs.Â 3, 7). These coasts were located in the European storm-track corridor comprising the British Isles, northern Germany, Denmark, and southern Sweden (Feser etÂ al.,Â 2015). Due to the mostly prevailing western winds, the rivers on the eastern coasts showed a lower number of compound flood events, which are usually within the expected range of 2Â standard deviations. This finding is consistent with the results of Paprotny etÂ al. (2018b), who noted a strong dependency in their rank correlation for west-facing coasts in northern Europe. Khanal etÂ al. (2019) and Kew etÂ al. (2013) likewise reported that the most extreme events in the Rhine delta are connected to westerly winds. Similarly, Svensson and Jones (2004) reported a strong dependence between discharge and storm surge events for western Great Britain. We identified the GroÃwetterlage cyclonic westerly as the common meteorological driver for the occurrence of large-scale compound flood events in North and Baltic Sea regions.\n\nIn parts of the Baltic and west-facing Finnish coasts, the GroÃwetterlage anticyclonic westerly additionally contributed to the generation of compound flood events (about one-third). For Ireland, a distinct GroÃwetterlage could not be identified as a driver of compound flood events. We speculate that this might be because it offers a wide angle of attack for storm surges.\n\nAdditionally, we were able to demonstrate that the detected spatial distribution remains stable for various sources of uncertainty. Our results proved to be robust against the utilisation of different forcing data for the simulation of discharge and sea level data, parameter settings, and randomisation approaches. Furthermore, the pattern remained relatively stable despite the ongoing climate change since the 1960s. There was a certain amount of variation in the pattern, which can be attributed to randomness and the different setups. Due to the limited number of compound flood events, even small variations to their definition, like changes in the allowed lag, have a minor influence on the results. In all cases, the pattern was present, even though it was sometimes more or less pronounced.\n\nIn addition, we demonstrated that regardless of the estuary orientation, the number of compound flood events declined on average with increasing catchment size. The reason for this might be that rivers with smaller catchment areas are capable of reacting faster to precipitation that appears during the storm events, which also causes the storm surges. There is some variation in the distribution, as expected by the design of the test, which resulted in around 5â% of the data points being labelled incorrectly.\n\nOur analysis here is associated with some caveats that have to be considered. We note that the utilisation of the 2Ï interval in our analysis comprises some amount of uncertainty. As a result, it can be expected that five to nine rivers will be incorrectly labelled, based on the size of the data set. Another problem for our analysis was the very short time frame that was accessible with the TRIMâREA6 and ECOSMOâREA6 data of 24 and 21Â years respectively. Furthermore, it is possible that the model-based data sets contain systematic errors. Despite the detected pattern being robust, it is possible that the absolute number of compound flood events may deviate from the actual number. Furthermore, the de-clustering time of 4âd might be too short for some of the longest rivers that may contain very long extreme events. The lack of a parametric model impedes the possibility of deriving engineering quantities such as design events used to assess the level of protection afforded by flood defence structures.\n\nFuture work can further examine these findings by using ensembles from climate models that cover longer time frames, e.g. 50Â years or more. This could enable generating a distribution for the number of compound flood events, based on the compound flood events detected in the individual ensemble members. As a result, it would become possible to calculate how many compound flood events to expect on average in each river. This reduces the influence of randomness by not having to rely on the compound flood event number detected in a single data set. One potential drawback is the reliance on the capabilities of numerical models to adequately generate those compound extreme events correctly. Additionally, future studies could focus on locations in close spatial proximity along the west-facing coasts for which long time series of daily sea level and discharge data are available. They could also attempt to quantify the lag for each catchment individually, which is currently troubling for large rivers since their lag depends on the location of the precipitation. Another interesting question, which needs further investigation, is why the vast majority of compound flood events on the west coasts happen during the cyclonic westerly, while not every one of these GroÃwetterlagen results in compound flood events. Understanding what makes them different might offer opportunities to identify them early and set contingency plans into motion.\n\nIn order to support future risk assessments, it will be important to analyse how compound events will change under different climate scenarios and sea level rises (Zscheischler etÂ al.,Â 2018). First, the frequency change of general flood events with respect to the current standards for extreme events might change especially with increasing sea levels. Second, it will be interesting to analyse if our observed pattern caused by the GroÃwetterlage remains similar or if we will see changes to it due to, for example, changes in the occurrence rate of this specific GroÃwetterlage. This is important since it is well known that there have been frequency changes in the past as reported by Grabau (1987) and Dietz (2019). Hoy etÂ al. (2013) found that the frequency of the cyclonic westerly was declining during the first half of the last century, before strongly rising between 1970 and 2000. This leads to the question of how the frequency of compound flood events might change for all of Europe, which is vital for regional coastal adaptation. Third, the vast majority of compound flood events are currently centred around the winter season. It is important for our general understanding to investigate if the seasonal distribution itself will change, maybe with more events in summer, or if the distribution stays the same with different numbers.\n\nAllen, R.Â G., Pereira, L.Â S., Raes, D., and Smith, M.: Crop evapotranspiration-Guidelines for computing crop water requirements-FAO Irrigation and drainage paperÂ 56, Fao, Rome, 300, D05109, ISBNÂ 92-5-104219-5, 1998.âa\n\nBermÃºdez, M., FarfÃ¡n, J., Willems, P., and Cea, L.: Assessing the effects of climate change on compound flooding in coastal river areas, Water Resour.
