The document defines weather and climate, and explains how latitude and altitude affect climate. It classifies pictures as examples of weather or climate. Weather is the short-term atmospheric conditions of an area, while climate is the average weather over a longer period of time. Latitude affects climate, with areas closer to the equator experiencing warmer temperatures and a tropical climate, while areas farther from the equator have cooler temperatures and polar or temperate climates. The document includes interactive activities asking students to label parts of a diagram showing the sun's rays on the earth and to identify the latitude and climate of different countries.",
