        "text": "Becoming a VP was a big disappointment for me! After 5 years of working my TAIL off... I finally made it! But it wasn't what I expected... The thing that struck me the most about becoming a VP (and then EVP) was this: My colleagues - the people with a seat at the table - were just like me They weren't any smarter, more talented or 'special'... And I was so disappointed. But not in them. IN ME. I was disappointed: - I let my own self-doubt get in the way for too many years - I assumed the people at the table were SO much smarter than I was - I believed the messages I'd received for so long, that the people who belonged at the table WEREN'T LIKE ME It was total BS! So I'm calling it for y'all If you're where I was, and you still believe that you don't belong at the table... This is your wake-up call. The people at the table don't have any special powers They don't have any special knowledge They're just people. Just like you And you can learn how to do all of the things that they do. If you want more info about how to do that, DM me friends Because I've made it my mission in life to help more women get a seat at the table ‚úåÔ∏èüíú PS. If you think more women need to hear this message, give it a repost. #womenleadership"
