        "text": "Hello everyone.\n\nI purchased a Dell Inspiron 3543 laptop 2 months ago. Overall, I am very happy with this product but I have a problem with DVD drive. When I insert DVD disks, the driver reads some DVDs but not others. After trying to play many dvds, I see that the DVD drive doesn't play approximately half of the DVDs that I try. Even thought I have a guarentee, I didn't want to send my laptop to service because I can't work even a single day without my laptop. So, in order to solve the problem, I purchased a new, original DVD drive from Dell (the same dvd drive model, which is Panasonic Matshita DVD+-RW UJ8E2). Today I started to use my new DVD drive, but it also has the exact same problem as my old DVD drive, i.e. it also doesn't play some DVDs.\n\nTo make the issue even more strange, here are some details:\n\n- My dvd disks have no problem and I have tried many original dvds (mostly original movies). And all the dvd disks that don't play on my computer play in other computers without any problem. So, there is no problem with the disks.\n\n- Certainly there is no issue with \"DVD Region Code\". I use original dvds with region code 2, which is the region code for my country.\n\n- All my drivers, operating system and dvd drive drivers are up-to-date. When I look at my DVD drive properties, it is written that \"the dvd drive works properly\".\n\n- When I insert a DVD disk, if my DVD drive plays it, it plays it every time. But if my dvd drive doesn't play a dvd, then it never plays it. So, there is a consistency in playing which dvd disk to play or not. When a DVD disk doesn't play, my DVD drive rolls the disk a few time and then, the DVD drive pretends as if there is no disk in the drive.\n\n- Both my old and newly purchased DVD drives have the exact same problem, so I think there is no problem like a dirty lens. I also think that there is no mechanical problem with any of my DVD drives because my newly purchased, original DVD drive also has the exact same problem.\n\nI thank everyone for any help or advice in advance.\n\nMy Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop was working fine when it suddenly broke down. When it boots, it shows the error message: \"No hard drive detected, please try to resolve the issue by reseating the drive.\"\n\nWhen I went into BIOS, the hard drive was not listed there either. My hard drive is a COSAIR SSD; SATA mode is set to AHCI correctly.\n\nI thought my hard drive died; so I went to buy a brand new one. But after installing the new one, I still got the same error message.\n\nAt this time, I think the motherboard has faulted. What is my option now? Is it possible to repair the motherboard, or is it better to just replace it? Is it even worth replacing it?\n\nHola,\n\nI have an R710 that is perpetually complaining of command time out errors on several disks. OMSA storage commands show all disks in OK status, but the alertlog shows multiple:\n\nSeverity : Non-Critical\n\nID : 2405\n\nDate and Time : Fri May 22 11:56:58 2015\n\nCategory : Storage Service\n\nDescription : Command timeout on physical disk: Physical Disk 0:3:6 Controller 1, Connector 0\n\n... on several disks. There have been complains of service degradation, and nothing else in OMSA seems to correlate.\n\nExported the lsi log, and found multiple instances of:\n\n05/22/15 8:23:43: DEV_REC:Medium Error DevId[6] devHandle 10 RDM=806d0c00 retires=0\n\n05/22/15 8:23:43: MedErr is for: cmdId=19, ld=2, src=1, cmd=1, lba=62a680, cnt=180, rmwOp=0\n\n05/22/15 8:23:43: ErrLBAOffset (7) LBA(20e280) BadLba=20e287\n\n05/22/15 8:23:45: EVT#43598-05/22/15 8:23:45: 113=Unexpected sense: PD 06(e0x0f/s3) Path 5000c500350c3fdd, CDB: 28 00 00 20 e2 80 00 01 80 00, Sense: 3/11/00\n\n05/22/15 8:23:45: Raw Sense for PD 6: f0 00 03 00 20 e2 87 0a 00 00 00 00 11 00 81 80 00 9d\n\n05/22/15 8:23:45: DEV_REC:Medium Error DevId[6] devHandle 10 RDM=806f3400 retires=0\n\n05/22/15 8:23:45: MedErr is for: cmdId=19, ld=2, src=1, cmd=1, lba=62a680, cnt=180, rmwOp=0\n\n05/22/15 8:23:45: ErrLBAOffset (7) LBA(20e280) BadLba=20e287\n\n05/22/15 8:23:45: BBM_CheckCmdTimer: TIMER_WITHIN_LIMIT secs 5\n\n05/22/15 8:23:45: EBB_RecoverReadErrors: Issue WV for pd=06, lba=20e287\n\n05/22/15 8:23:45: Issuing write verify pd=06 physArm=0 span=0 startBlk=20e287 numBlks=1\n\n05/22/15 8:23:46: reassignMsgDone: cmdId 19, src 1, orgId 4\n\n05/22/15 8:23:46: EVT#43599-05/22/15 8:23:46: 110=Corrected medium error during recovery on PD 06(e0x0f/s3) at 20e287\n\n05/22/15 11:56:15: DM: Chip 0 Paused\n\n05/22/15 11:56:15: Chip <0> Slots: Cur=[231]\n\n05/22/15 11:56:15: [e9]= 3 [eb]= 3 [ec]=10 [ed]= c [ee]= b [ef]= 4 [f0]= 6 [f1]= 2\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: DM: Timing wheel expired - Chip 0 Slot e9\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: Chip <0> Slots: Cur=[233]\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: [e9]= 3 [eb]= 3 [ec]=10 [ed]= c [ee]= b [ef]= 4 [f0]= 6 [f1]= 2\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: TIMEOUT: rdm 8055e000, devHandle 0065, mid 012e, Cmd 01, devId 0023, devState 0020, devFlags f1c0000f\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: DM_PL_AllocateTaskMgmtFrame: TM mid=81a pTaskMgmt=c04d5e00\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: TIMEOUT: rdm 8062c800, devHandle 0065, mid 0467, Cmd 01, devId 0023, devState 0020, devFlags f1c8200f\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: TIMEOUT: rdm 80679e00, devHandle 0065, mid 006c, Cmd 01, devId 0023, devState 0020, devFlags f1c8200f\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: DM_TMWheelScanAllMsg (slot e9):Scanned 57, Timeout 3 Msg mask 21000\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: EVT#43600-05/22/15 11:56:17: 267=Command timeout on PD 23(e0x29/s6) Path 5000039388c81aa3, CDB: 28 00 1b 89 31 40 00 00 80 00\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: EVT#43601-05/22/15 11:56:17: 267=Command timeout on PD 23(e0x29/s6) Path 5000039388c81aa3, CDB: 28 00 1b 89 2f 40 00 00 40 00\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: EVT#43602-05/22/15 11:56:17: 267=Command timeout on PD 23(e0x29/s6) Path 5000039388c81aa3, CDB: 28 00 33 d7 80 c0 00 00 40 00\n\n05/22/15 11:56:17: EVT#43603-05/22/15 11:56:17: 268=PD 23(e0x29/s6) Path 5000039388c81aa3 reset (Type 03)\n\nAnybody have an idea what the cause may be, and how to fix it?\n\nI recently purchased a Dell latitude e7440, it came with a 500gb HDD and a open slot for a mSata ssd. I purchased a Samsung 850 evo 250 gb msata ssd and installed it in the open slot.\n\nNow the problem is I am unable to boot my system from the msata ssd.\n\nI did a clone of my hdd to ssd using Samsung data migration software and it was successful. But when i changed the boot drive to the msata ssd (in legacy mode not sure how to do it in UIEF mode) I get invalid partition table error.\n\nI tried deselecting the internal hdd and rebooting, but then the minicard slot is also getting deselected automatically on the reboot.\n\nIf anyone has faced similar issue and knows how to fix this, then please assist.\n\nSO i recently broke my laptop screen and after i got it back from the service center , i noticed that my mouse and pendrive were not working.I went to device manager and saw the following three under the \"other devices\" with a yellow warning sign on each of them.\n\n1. Usb2.0-CRW ; Device Status : This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1) ; Location : Port_#0003.Hub_#0003\n\n2. BCM43142A0 ; Device Status : This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1) ; Location : Port_#0005.Hub_#0004\n\n3. Unknown device ; Device Manager : This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1) ; Location : on Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 0100 (Microsoft)\n\nI tried to update the driver software of each of the above and got the error \"The system cannot find the file specified\" for no.1 ; Error \"The data is invalid\" for no.2 ; for no.3 , it showed \"windows was unable to install your unknown device\"\n\nAll help appreciated."
