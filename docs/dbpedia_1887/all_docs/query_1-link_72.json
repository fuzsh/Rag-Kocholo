        "text": "Dr. So specializes in G-protein coupled receptor kinases and their roles in human cancer and stress responses. Dr. So has authored publications on the effect of G protein coupled receptor kinases in cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutics and their roles in various signaling pathways related to cell growth and cell death. Currently, he is overseeing projects aiming to expand the role of G protein coupled receptor kinases in cell signaling, identifying new signaling pathways these kinases are involved in. For this, he is utilizing new bioinformatic and cellular approaches as well as using the model organism, Caernorhabditis (C.) elegans.\n\nEducation\n\nBachelor of Science in Toxicology and his Doctor of Philosophy in Pharmacology from the University of Toronto.\n\nResearch Interest\n\nG-protein coupled receptor kinases and their roles in cell biology and drug responses.\n\nAffiliations\n\nDr. So is a member of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, American Association for Cancer Research, and the American Heart Association.\n\nAwards\n\nResearch Fellowship, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada\n\nTeaching Subjects\n\nHe teaches courses in gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and renal systems, and neuropharmacology.\n\nPublications\n\n1) J.
