Stable adaptive laws are derived using Lyapunov framework. The proposed architecture is compared with the now classical model reference adaptive control. A simulation example is presented in which numerical evidence indicates that the proposed controller yields improved transient characteristics.\n\nPredictor-Based Model Reference Adaptive Control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLavretsky, Eugene; Gadient, Ross; Gregory, Irene M.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis paper is devoted to robust, Predictor-based Model Reference Adaptive Control (PMRAC) design. The proposed adaptive system is compared with the now-classical Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) architecture. Simulation examples are presented. Numerical evidence indicates that the proposed PMRAC tracking architecture has better than MRAC transient characteristics. In this paper, we presented a state-predictor based direct adaptive tracking design methodology for multi-input dynamical systems, with partially known dynamics. Efficiency of the design was demonstrated using short period dynamics of an aircraft. Formal proof of the reported PMRAC benefits constitute future research and will be reported elsewhere.\n\nAdaptive Control with Reference Model Modification\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nStepanyan, Vahram; Krishnakumar, Kalmanje\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a modification of the conventional model reference adaptive control (MRAC) architecture in order to improve transient performance of the input and output signals of uncertain systems. A simple modification of the reference model is proposed by feeding back the tracking error signal. It is shown that the proposed approach guarantees tracking of the given reference command and the reference control signal (one that would be designed if the system were known) not only asymptotically but also in transient. Moreover, it prevents generation of high frequency oscillations, which are unavoidable in conventional MRAC systems for large adaptation rates. The provided design guideline makes it possible to track a reference commands of any magnitude from any initial position without re-tuning. The benefits of the method are demonstrated with a simulation example\n\nAn Optimal Control Modification to Model-Reference Adaptive Control for Fast Adaptation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNguyen, Nhan T.; Krishnakumar, Kalmanje; Boskovic, Jovan\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a method that can achieve fast adaptation for a class of model-reference adaptive control. It is well-known that standard model-reference adaptive control exhibits high-gain control behaviors when a large adaptive gain is used to achieve fast adaptation in order to reduce tracking error rapidly. High gain control creates high-frequency oscillations that can excite unmodeled dynamics and can lead to instability. The fast adaptation approach is based on the minimization of the squares of the tracking error, which is formulated as an optimal control problem. The necessary condition of optimality is used to derive an adaptive law using the gradient method. This adaptive law is shown to result in uniform boundedness of the tracking error by means of the Lyapunov s direct method. Furthermore, this adaptive law allows a large adaptive gain to be used without causing undesired high-gain control effects. The method is shown to be more robust than standard model-reference adaptive control. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nDecentralized model reference adaptive control of large flexible structures\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, Fu-Ming; Fong, I-Kong; Lin, Yu-Hwan\n\n1988-01-01\n\nA decentralized model reference adaptive control (DMRAC) method is developed for large flexible structures (LFS). The development follows that of a centralized model reference adaptive control for LFS that have been shown to be feasible. The proposed method is illustrated using a simply supported beam with collocated actuators and sensors. Results show that the DMRAC can achieve either output regulation or output tracking with adequate convergence, provided the reference model inputs and their time derivatives are integrable, bounded, and approach zero as t approaches infinity.\n\nAn Adaptive Critic Approach to Reference Model Adaptation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKrishnakumar, K.; Limes, G.; Gundy-Burlet, K.; Bryant, D.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nNeural networks have been successfully used for implementing control architectures for different applications. In this work, we examine a neural network augmented adaptive critic as a Level 2 intelligent controller for a C- 17 aircraft. This intelligent control architecture utilizes an adaptive critic to tune the parameters of a reference model, which is then used to define the angular rate command for a Level 1 intelligent controller. The present architecture is implemented on a high-fidelity non-linear model of a C-17 aircraft. The goal of this research is to improve the performance of the C-17 under degraded conditions such as control failures and battle damage. Pilot ratings using a motion based simulation facility are included in this paper. The benefits of using an adaptive critic are documented using time response comparisons for severe damage situations.\n\nPerformance Optimizing Adaptive Control with Time-Varying Reference Model Modification\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNguyen, Nhan T.; Hashemi, Kelley E.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a new adaptive control approach that involves a performance optimization objective. The control synthesis involves the design of a performance optimizing adaptive controller from a subset of control inputs. The resulting effect of the performance optimizing adaptive controller is to modify the initial reference model into a time-varying reference model which satisfies the performance optimization requirement obtained from an optimal control problem. The time-varying reference model modification is accomplished by the real-time solutions of the time-varying Riccati and Sylvester equations coupled with the least-squares parameter estimation of the sensitivities of the performance metric. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by an application of maneuver load alleviation control for a flexible aircraft.\n\nModel reference adaptive control of robots\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSteinvorth, Rodrigo\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThis project presents the results of controlling two types of robots using new Command Generator Tracker (CGT) based Direct Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) algorithms. Two mathematical models were used to represent a single-link, flexible joint arm and a Unimation PUMA 560 arm; and these were then controlled in simulation using different MRAC algorithms. Special attention was given to the performance of the algorithms in the presence of sudden changes in the robot load. Previously used CGT based MRAC algorithms had several problems. The original algorithm that was developed guaranteed asymptotic stability only for almost strictly positive real (ASPR) plants. This condition is very restrictive, since most systems do not satisfy this assumption. Further developments to the algorithm led to an expansion of the number of plants that could be controlled, however, a steady state error was introduced in the response. These problems led to the introduction of some modifications to the algorithms so that they would be able to control a wider class of plants and at the same time would asymptotically track the reference model. This project presents the development of two algorithms that achieve the desired results and simulates the control of the two robots mentioned before. The results of the simulations are satisfactory and show that the problems stated above have been corrected in the new algorithms. In addition, the responses obtained show that the adaptively controlled processes are resistant to sudden changes in the load.\n\nAn implicit adaptation algorithm for a linear model reference control system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMabius, L.; Kaufman, H.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a stable implicit adaptation algorithm for model reference control. The constraints for stability are found using Lyapunov's second method and do not depend on perfect model following between the system and the reference model. Methods are proposed for satisfying these constraints without estimating the parameters on which the constraints depend.\n\nModel reference, sliding mode adaptive control for flexible structures\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nYurkovich, S.; Ozguner, U.; Al-Abbass, F.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nA decentralized model reference adaptive approach using a variable-structure sliding model control has been developed for the vibration suppression of large flexible structures. Local models are derived based upon the desired damping and response time in a model-following scheme, and variable structure controllers are then designed which employ colocated angular rate and position feedback. Numerical simulations have been performed using NASA's flexible grid experimental apparatus.\n\nDirect model reference adaptive control with application to flexible robots\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSteinvorth, Rodrigo; Kaufman, Howard; Neat, Gregory W.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nA modification to a direct command generator tracker-based model reference adaptive control (MRAC) system is suggested in this paper. This modification incorporates a feedforward into the reference model's output as well as the plant's output. Its purpose is to eliminate the bounded model following error present in steady state when previous MRAC systems were used. The algorithm was evaluated using the dynamics for a single-link flexible-joint arm. The results of these simulations show a response with zero steady state model following error. These results encourage further use of MRAC for various types of nonlinear plants.\n\nDirect model reference adaptive control of a flexible robotic manipulator\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMeldrum, D. R.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nQuick, precise control of a flexible manipulator in a space environment is essential for future Space Station repair and satellite servicing. Numerous control algorithms have proven successful in controlling rigid manipulators wih colocated sensors and actuators; however, few have been tested on a flexible manipulator with noncolocated sensors and actuators. In this thesis, a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) scheme based on command generator tracker theory is designed for a flexible manipulator. Quicker, more precise tracking results are expected over nonadaptive control laws for this MRAC approach. Equations of motion in modal coordinates are derived for a single-link, flexible manipulator with an actuator at the pinned-end and a sensor at the free end. An MRAC is designed with the objective of controlling the torquing actuator so that the tip position follows a trajectory that is prescribed by the reference model. An appealing feature of this direct MRAC law is that it allows the reference model to have fewer states than the plant itself. Direct adaptive control also adjusts the controller parameters directly with knowledge of only the plant output and input signals.\n\nCommand generator tracker based direct model reference adaptive control of a PUMA 560 manipulator. Thesis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSwift, David C.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis project dealt with the application of a Direct Model Reference Adaptive Control algorithm to the control of a PUMA 560 Robotic Manipulator. This chapter will present some motivation for using Direct Model Reference Adaptive Control, followed by a brief historical review, the project goals, and a summary of the subsequent chapters.\n\nAnalytical and experimental study of control effort associated with model reference adaptive control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMesser, R. S.; Haftka, R. T.; Cudney, H. H.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nNumerical simulation results presently obtained for the performance of model reference adaptive control (MRAC) are experimentally verified, with a view to accounting for differences between the plant and the reference model after the control function has been brought to bear. MRAC is both experimentally and analytically applied to a single-degree-of-freedom system, as well as analytically to a MIMO system having controlled differences between the reference model and the plant. The control effort is noted to be sensitive to differences between the plant and the reference model.\n\nThe cost of model reference adaptive control - Analysis, experiments, and optimization\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMesser, R. S.; Haftka, R. T.; Cudney, H. H.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nIn this paper the performance of Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) is studied in numerical simulations and verified experimentally with the objective of understanding how differences between the plant and the reference model affect the control effort. MRAC is applied analytically and experimentally to a single degree of freedom system and analytically to a MIMO system with controlled differences between the model and the plant. It is shown that the control effort is sensitive to differences between the plant and the reference model. The effects of increased damping in the reference model are considered, and it is shown that requiring the controller to provide increased damping actually decreases the required control effort when differences between the plant and reference model exist. This result is useful because one of the first attempts to counteract the increased control effort due to differences between the plant and reference model might be to require less damping, however, this would actually increase the control effort. Optimization of weighting matrices is shown to help reduce the increase in required control effort. However, it was found that eventually the optimization resulted in a design that required an extremely high sampling rate for successful realization.\n\nDirect model reference adaptive control of robotic arms\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKaufman, Howard; Swift, David C.; Cummings, Steven T.; Shankey, Jeffrey R.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe results of controlling A PUMA 560 Robotic Manipulator and the NASA shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS) using a Command Generator Tracker (CGT) based Model Reference Adaptive Controller (DMRAC) are presented. Initially, the DMRAC algorithm was run in simulation using a detailed dynamic model of the PUMA 560. The algorithm was tuned on the simulation and then used to control the manipulator using minimum jerk trajectories as the desired reference inputs. The ability to track a trajectory in the presence of load changes was also investigated in the simulation. Satisfactory performance was achieved in both simulation and on the actual robot. The obtained responses showed that the algorithm was robust in the presence of sudden load changes. Because these results indicate that the DMRAC algorithm can indeed be successfully applied to the control of robotic manipulators, additional testing was performed to validate the applicability of DMRAC to simulated dynamics of the shuttle RMS.\n\nModel reference tracking control of an aircraft: a robust adaptive approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTanyer, Ilker; Tatlicioglu, Enver; Zergeroglu, Erkan\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis work presents the design and the corresponding analysis of a nonlinear robust adaptive controller for model reference tracking of an aircraft that has parametric uncertainties in its system matrices and additive state- and/or time-dependent nonlinear disturbance-like terms in its dynamics. Specifically, robust integral of the sign of the error feedback term and an adaptive term is fused with a proportional integral controller. Lyapunov-based stability analysis techniques are utilised to prove global asymptotic convergence of the output tracking error. Extensive numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed robust adaptive controller.\n\nSecond-order sliding mode controller with model reference adaptation for automatic train operation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGanesan, M.; Ezhilarasi, D.; Benni, Jijo\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn this paper, a new approach to model reference based adaptive second-order sliding mode control together with adaptive state feedback is presented to control the longitudinal dynamic motion of a high speed train for automatic train operation with the objective of minimal jerk travel by the passengers. The nonlinear dynamic model for the longitudinal motion of the train comprises of a locomotive and coach subsystems is constructed using multiple point-mass model by considering the forces acting on the vehicle. An adaptation scheme using Lyapunov criterion is derived to tune the controller gains by considering a linear, stable reference model that ensures the stability of the system in closed loop. The effectiveness of the controller tracking performance is tested under uncertain passenger load, coupler-draft gear parameters, propulsion resistance coefficients variations and environmental disturbances due to side wind and wet rail conditions. The results demonstrate improved tracking performance of the proposed control scheme with a least jerk under maximum parameter uncertainties when compared to constant gain second-order sliding mode control.\n\nModel reference adaptive control (MRAC)-based parameter identification applied to surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhong, Chongquan; Lin, Yaoyao\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn this work, a model reference adaptive control-based estimated algorithm is proposed for online multi-parameter identification of surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines. By taking the dq-axis equations of a practical motor as the reference model and the dq-axis estimation equations as the adjustable model, a standard model-reference-adaptive-system-based estimator was established. Additionally, the Popov hyperstability principle was used in the design of the adaptive law to guarantee accurate convergence. In order to reduce the oscillation of identification result, this work introduces a first-order low-pass digital filter to improve precision regarding the parameter estimation. The proposed scheme was then applied to an SPM synchronous motor control system without any additional circuits and implemented using a DSP TMS320LF2812. For analysis, the experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nCommand generator tracker based direct model reference adaptive tracking guidance for Mars atmospheric entry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Shuang; Peng, Yuming\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn order to accurately deliver an entry vehicle through the Martian atmosphere to the prescribed parachute deployment point, active Mars entry guidance is essential. This paper addresses the issue of Mars atmospheric entry guidance using the command generator tracker (CGT) based direct model reference adaptive control to reduce the adverse effect of the bounded uncertainties on atmospheric density and aerodynamic coefficients. Firstly, the nominal drag acceleration profile meeting a variety of constraints is planned off-line in the longitudinal plane as the reference model to track. Then, the CGT based direct model reference adaptive controller and the feed-forward compensator are designed to robustly track the aforementioned reference drag acceleration profile and to effectively reduce the downrange error. Afterwards, the heading alignment logic is adopted in the lateral plane to reduce the crossrange error. Finally, the validity of the guidance algorithm proposed in this paper is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation analysis.\n\nA Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion Predictor-Based Model Reference Adaptive Controller for a Generic Transport Model\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCampbell, Stefan F.; Kaneshige, John T.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPresented here is a Predictor-Based Model Reference Adaptive Control (PMRAC) architecture for a generic transport aircraft. At its core, this architecture features a three-axis, non-linear, dynamic-inversion controller. Command inputs for this baseline controller are provided by pilot roll-rate, pitch-rate, and sideslip commands. This paper will first thoroughly present the baseline controller followed by a description of the PMRAC adaptive augmentation to this control system. Results are presented via a full-scale, nonlinear simulation of NASA s Generic Transport Model (GTM).\n\nPerformance Optimizing Multi-Objective Adaptive Control with Time-Varying Model Reference Modification\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNguyen, Nhan T.; Hashemi, Kelley E.; Yucelen, Tansel; Arabi, Ehsan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a new adaptive control approach that involves a performance optimization objective. The problem is cast as a multi-objective optimal control. The control synthesis involves the design of a performance optimizing controller from a subset of control inputs. The effect of the performance optimizing controller is to introduce an uncertainty into the system that can degrade tracking of the reference model. An adaptive controller from the remaining control inputs is designed to reduce the effect of the uncertainty while maintaining a notion of performance optimization in the adaptive control system.\n\nNeural network-based model reference adaptive control system.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatino, H D; Liu, D\n\n2000-01-01\n\nIn this paper, an approach to model reference adaptive control based on neural networks is proposed and analyzed for a class of first-order continuous-time nonlinear dynamical systems. The controller structure can employ either a radial basis function network or a feedforward neural network to compensate adaptively the nonlinearities in the plant. A stable controller-parameter adjustment mechanism, which is determined using the Lyapunov theory, is constructed using a sigma-modification-type updating law. The evaluation of control error in terms of the neural network learning error is performed. That is, the control error converges asymptotically to a neighborhood of zero, whose size is evaluated and depends on the approximation error of the neural network. In the design and analysis of neural network-based control systems, it is important to take into account the neural network learning error and its influence on the control error of the plant. Simulation results showing the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach are given.\n\nApplication of positive-real functions in hyperstable discrete model-reference adaptive system design.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKarmarkar, J. S.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nProposal of an algorithmic procedure, based on mathematical programming methods, to design compensators for hyperstable discrete model-reference adaptive systems (MRAS). The objective of the compensator is to render the MRAS insensitive to initial parameter estimates within a maximized hypercube in the model parameter space.\n\nDesign of a Model Reference Adaptive Controller for an Unmanned Air Vehicle\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCrespo, Luis G.; Matsutani, Megumi; Annaswamy, Anuradha M.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper presents the \"Adaptive Control Technology for Safe Flight (ACTS)\" architecture, which consists of a non-adaptive controller that provides satisfactory performance under nominal flying conditions, and an adaptive controller that provides robustness under off nominal ones. The design and implementation procedures of both controllers are presented. The aim of these procedures, which encompass both theoretical and practical considerations, is to develop a controller suitable for flight. The ACTS architecture is applied to the Generic Transport Model developed by NASA-Langley Research Center. The GTM is a dynamically scaled test model of a transport aircraft for which a flight-test article and a high-fidelity simulation are available. The nominal controller at the core of the ACTS architecture has a multivariable LQR-PI structure while the adaptive one has a direct, model reference structure. The main control surfaces as well as the throttles are used as control inputs. The inclusion of the latter alleviates the pilot s workload by eliminating the need for cancelling the pitch coupling generated by changes in thrust. Furthermore, the independent usage of the throttles by the adaptive controller enables their use for attitude control. Advantages and potential drawbacks of adaptation are demonstrated by performing high fidelity simulations of a flight-validated controller and of its adaptive augmentation.\n\nA set-theoretic model reference adaptive control architecture for disturbance rejection and uncertainty suppression with strict performance guarantees\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArabi, Ehsan; Gruenwald, Benjamin C.; Yucelen, Tansel; Nguyen, Nhan T.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nResearch in adaptive control algorithms for safety-critical applications is primarily motivated by the fact that these algorithms have the capability to suppress the effects of adverse conditions resulting from exogenous disturbances, imperfect dynamical system modelling, degraded modes of operation, and changes in system dynamics. Although government and industry agree on the potential of these algorithms in providing safety and reducing vehicle development costs, a major issue is the inability to achieve a-priori, user-defined performance guarantees with adaptive control algorithms. In this paper, a new model reference adaptive control architecture for uncertain dynamical systems is presented to address disturbance rejection and uncertainty suppression. The proposed framework is predicated on a set-theoretic adaptive controller construction using generalised restricted potential functions.The key feature of this framework allows the system error bound between the state of an uncertain dynamical system and the state of a reference model, which captures a desired closed-loop system performance, to be less than a-priori, user-defined worst-case performance bound, and hence, it has the capability to enforce strict performance guarantees. Examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed set-theoretic model reference adaptive control architecture.\n\nModel reference adaptive control of flexible robots in the presence of sudden load changes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSteinvorth, Rodrigo; Kaufman, Howard; Neat, Gregory\n\n1991-01-01\n\nDirect command generator tracker based model reference adaptive control (MRAC) algorithms are applied to the dynamics for a flexible-joint arm in the presence of sudden load changes. Because of the need to satisfy a positive real condition, such MRAC procedures are designed so that a feedforward augmented output follows the reference model output, thus, resulting in an ultimately bounded rather than zero output error. Thus, modifications are suggested and tested that: (1) incorporate feedforward into the reference model's output as well as the plant's output, and (2) incorporate a derivative term into only the process feedforward loop. The results of these simulations give a response with zero steady state model following error, and thus encourage further use of MRAC for more complex flexibile robotic systems.\n\nDevelopment of model reference adaptive control theory for electric power plant control applications\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMabius, L.E.\n\n1982-09-15\n\nThe scope of this effort includes the theoretical development of a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) Model Reference Control (MRC) algorithm, (i.e., model following control law), Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) algorithm and the formulation of a nonlinear model of a typical electric power plant. Previous single-input, single-output MRAC algorithm designs have been generalized to MIMO MRAC designs using the MIMO MRC algorithm. This MRC algorithm, which has been developed using Command Generator Tracker methodologies, represents the steady state behavior (in the adaptive sense) of the MRAC algorithm. The MRC algorithm is a fundamental component in the MRAC design and stability analysis.moreÂ Â» An enhanced MRC algorithm, which has been developed for systems with more controls than regulated outputs, alleviates the MRC stability constraint of stable plant transmission zeroes. The nonlinear power plant model is based on the Cromby model with the addition of a governor valve management algorithm, turbine dynamics and turbine interactions with extraction flows. An application of the MRC algorithm to a linearization of this model demonstrates its applicability to power plant systems. In particular, the generated power changes at 7% per minute while throttle pressure and temperature, reheat temperature and drum level are held constant with a reasonable level of control. The enhanced algorithm reduces significantly control fluctuations without modifying the output response.Â«Â less\n\nAn associative model of adaptive inference for learning word-referent mappings.\n\nPubMed\n\nKachergis, George; Yu, Chen; Shiffrin, Richard M\n\n2012-04-01\n\nPeople can learn word-referent pairs over a short series of individually ambiguous situations containing multiple words and referents (Yu & Smith, 2007, Cognition 106: 1558-1568). Cross-situational statistical learning relies on the repeated co-occurrence of words with their intended referents, but simple co-occurrence counts cannot explain the findings. Mutual exclusivity (ME: an assumption of one-to-one mappings) can reduce ambiguity by leveraging prior experience to restrict the number of word-referent pairings considered but can also block learning of non-one-to-one mappings. The present study first trained learners on one-to-one mappings with varying numbers of repetitions. In late training, a new set of word-referent pairs were introduced alongside pretrained pairs; each pretrained pair consistently appeared with a new pair. Results indicate that (1) learners quickly infer new pairs in late training on the basis of their knowledge of pretrained pairs, exhibiting ME; and (2) learners also adaptively relax the ME bias and learn two-to-two mappings involving both pretrained and new words and objects. We present an associative model that accounts for both results using competing familiarity and uncertainty biases.\n\nTracking of multiple targets using online learning for reference model adaptation.\n\nPubMed\n\nPernkopf, Franz\n\n2008-12-01\n\nRecently, much work has been done in multiple object tracking on the one hand and on reference model adaptation for a single-object tracker on the other side. In this paper, we do both tracking of multiple objects (faces of people) in a meeting scenario and online learning to incrementally update the models of the tracked objects to account for appearance changes during tracking. Additionally, we automatically initialize and terminate tracking of individual objects based on low-level features, i.e., face color, face size, and object movement. Many methods unlike our approach assume that the target region has been initialized by hand in the first frame. For tracking, a particle filter is incorporated to propagate sample distributions over time. We discuss the close relationship between our implemented tracker based on particle filters and genetic algorithms. Numerous experiments on meeting data demonstrate the capabilities of our tracking approach. Additionally, we provide an empirical verification of the reference model learning during tracking of indoor and outdoor scenes which supports a more robust tracking. Therefore, we report the average of the standard deviation of the trajectories over numerous tracking runs depending on the learning rate.\n\nEndogenous Market-Clearing Prices and Reference Point Adaptation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDragicevic, Arnaud Z.\n\nWhen prices depend on the submitted bids, i.e. with endogenous market-clearing prices in repeated-round auction mechanisms, the assumption of independent private values that underlines the property of incentive-compatibility is to be brought into question; even if these mechanisms provide active involvement and market learning. In its orthodox view, adaptive bidding behavior imperils incentive-compatibility. We relax the assumption of private values' independence in the repeated-round auctions, when the market-clearing prices are made public at the end of each round. Instead of using game-theory learning models, we introduce a behavioral model that shows that bidders bid according to the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic, which neither ignores the rationality and incentive-compatibility constraints, nor rejects the posted prices issued from others' bids. Bidders simply weight information at their disposal and adjust their discovered value using reference points encoded in the sequential price weighting function. Our model says that bidders and offerers are sincere boundedly rational utility maximizers. It lies between evolutionary dynamics and adaptive heuristics and we model the concept of inertia as high weighting of the anchor, which stands for truthful bidding and high regard to freshly discovered preferences. Adjustment means adaptive rule based on adaptation of the reference point in the direction of the posted price. It helps a bidder to maximize her expected payoff, which is after all the only purpose that matters to rationality. The two components simply suggest that sincere bidders are boundedly rational. Furthermore, by deviating from their anchor in the direction of the public signal, bidders operate in a correlated equilibrium. The correlation between bids comes from the commonly observed history of play and each bidder's actions are determined by the history. Bidders are sincere if they have limited memory and confine their reference point adaptation\n\nAdaptive Performance Seeking Control Using Fuzzy Model Reference Learning Control and Positive Gradient Control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKopasakis, George\n\n1997-01-01\n\nPerformance Seeking Control attempts to find the operating condition that will generate optimal performance and control the plant at that operating condition. In this paper a nonlinear multivariable Adaptive Performance Seeking Control (APSC) methodology will be developed and it will be demonstrated on a nonlinear system. The APSC is comprised of the Positive Gradient Control (PGC) and the Fuzzy Model Reference Learning Control (FMRLC). The PGC computes the positive gradients of the desired performance function with respect to the control inputs in order to drive the plant set points to the operating point that will produce optimal performance. The PGC approach will be derived in this paper. The feedback control of the plant is performed by the FMRLC. For the FMRLC, the conventional fuzzy model reference learning control methodology is utilized, with guidelines generated here for the effective tuning of the FMRLC controller.\n\nRobust model reference adaptive output feedback tracking for uncertain linear systems with actuator fault based on reinforced dead-zone modification.\n\nPubMed\n\nBagherpoor, H M; Salmasi, Farzad R\n\n2015-07-01\n\nIn this paper, robust model reference adaptive tracking controllers are considered for Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) linear systems containing modeling uncertainties, unknown additive disturbances and actuator fault. Two new lemmas are proposed for both SISO and MIMO, under which dead-zone modification rule is improved such that the tracking error for any reference signal tends to zero in such systems. In the conventional approach, adaption of the controller parameters is ceased inside the dead-zone region which results tracking error, while preserving the system stability. In the proposed scheme, control signal is reinforced with an additive term based on tracking error inside the dead-zone which results in full reference tracking. In addition, no Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) unit is needed in the proposed approach. Closed loop system stability and zero tracking error are proved by considering a suitable Lyapunov functions candidate. It is shown that the proposed control approach can assure that all the signals of the close loop system are bounded in faulty conditions. Finally, validity and performance of the new schemes have been illustrated through numerical simulations of SISO and MIMO systems in the presence of actuator faults, modeling uncertainty and output disturbance.

However, some recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamic traffic flow assignment largely depends on travelers' rationality degree, travelers' heterogeneity and what the traffic information the travelers have. In this paper, we develop a new self-adaptive multi agent model to depict travelers' behavior in Dynamic Traffic Assignment. We use Cumulative Prospect Theory with heterogeneous reference points to illustrate travelers' bounded rationality. We use reinforcement-learning model to depict travelers' route and departure time choosing behavior under the condition of imperfect information. We design the evolution rule of travelers' expected arrival time and the algorithm of traffic flow assignment. Compared with the traditional model, the self-adaptive multi agent model we proposed in this paper can effectively help travelers avoid the rush hour. Finally, we report and analyze the effect of travelers' group behavior on the transportation system, and give some insights into the relation between travelers' group behavior and the performance of transportation system.\n\nA Direct Adaptive Control Approach in the Presence of Model Mismatch\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJoshi, Suresh M.; Tao, Gang; Khong, Thuan\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis paper considers the problem of direct model reference adaptive control when the plant-model matching conditions are violated due to abnormal changes in the plant or incorrect knowledge of the plant's mathematical structure. The approach consists of direct adaptation of state feedback gains for state tracking, and simultaneous estimation of the plant-model mismatch. Because of the mismatch, the plant can no longer track the state of the original reference model, but may be able to track a new reference model that still provides satisfactory performance. The reference model is updated if the estimated plant-model mismatch exceeds a bound that is determined via robust stability and/or performance criteria. The resulting controller is a hybrid direct-indirect adaptive controller that offers asymptotic state tracking in the presence of plant-model mismatch as well as parameter deviations.\n\nHandling Qualities of Model Reference Adaptive Controllers with Varying Complexity for Pitch-Roll Coupled Failures\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchaefer, Jacob; Hanson, Curt; Johnson, Marcus A.; Nguyen, Nhan\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThree model reference adaptive controllers (MRAC) with varying levels of complexity were evaluated on a high performance jet aircraft and compared along with a baseline nonlinear dynamic inversion controller. The handling qualities and performance of the controllers were examined during failure conditions that induce coupling between the pitch and roll axes. Results from flight tests showed with a roll to pitch input coupling failure, the handling qualities went from Level 2 with the baseline controller to Level 1 with the most complex MRAC tested. A failure scenario with the left stabilator frozen also showed improvement with the MRAC. Improvement in performance and handling qualities was generally seen as complexity was incrementally added; however, added complexity usually corresponds to increased verification and validation effort required for certification. The tradeoff between complexity and performance is thus important to a controls system designer when implementing an adaptive controller on an aircraft. This paper investigates this relation through flight testing of several controllers of vary complexity.\n\nModel reference adaptive control for the azimuth-pointing system of a balloon-borne stabilized platform\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLubin, Philip M.; Tomizuka, Masayoshi; Chingcuanco, Alfredo O.; Meinhold, Peter R.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nA balloon-born stabilized platform has been developed for the remotely operated altitude-azimuth pointing of a millimeter wave telescope system. This paper presents a development and implementation of model reference adaptive control (MRAC) for the azimuth-pointing system of the stabilized platform. The primary goal of the controller is to achieve pointing rms better than 0.1 deg. Simulation results indicate that MRAC can achieve pointing rms better than 0.1 deg. Ground test results show pointing rms better than 0.03 deg. Data from the first flight at the National Scientific Balloon Facility (NSBF) Palestine, Texas show pointing rms better than 0.02 deg.\n\nMRAC Revisited: Guaranteed Performance with Reference Model Modification\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nStepanyan, Vahram; Krishnakumar, Kalmaje\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper presents modification of the conventional model reference adaptive control (MRAC) architecture in order to achieve guaranteed transient performance both in the output and input signals of an uncertain system. The proposed modification is based on the tracking error feedback to the reference model. It is shown that approach guarantees tracking of a given command and the ideal control signal (one that would be designed if the system were known) not only asymptotically but also in transient by a proper selection of the error feedback gain. The method prevents generation of high frequency oscillations that are unavoidable in conventional MRAC systems for large adaptation rates. The provided design guideline makes it possible to track a reference command of any magnitude form any initial position without re-tuning. The benefits of the method are demonstrated in simulations.\n\nHandling Qualities Evaluations of Low Complexity Model Reference Adaptive Controllers for Reduced Pitch and Roll Damping Scenarios\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHanson, Curt; Schaefer, Jacob; Burken, John J.; Johnson, Marcus; Nguyen, Nhan\n\n2011-01-01\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) researchers have conducted a series of flight experiments designed to study the effects of varying levels of adaptive controller complexity on the performance and handling qualities of an aircraft under various simulated failure or damage conditions. A baseline, nonlinear dynamic inversion controller was augmented with three variations of a model reference adaptive control design. The simplest design consisted of a single adaptive parameter in each of the pitch and roll axes computed using a basic gradient-based update law. A second design was built upon the first by increasing the complexity of the update law. The third and most complex design added an additional adaptive parameter to each axis. Flight tests were conducted using NASA s Full-scale Advanced Systems Testbed, a highly modified F-18 aircraft that contains a research flight control system capable of housing advanced flight controls experiments. Each controller was evaluated against a suite of simulated failures and damage ranging from destabilization of the pitch and roll axes to significant coupling between the axes. Two pilots evaluated the three adaptive controllers as well as the non-adaptive baseline controller in a variety of dynamic maneuvers and precision flying tasks designed to uncover potential deficiencies in the handling qualities of the aircraft, and adverse interactions between the pilot and the adaptive controllers. The work was completed as part of the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control Project under NASA s Aviation Safety Program.\n\nDesign of Low Complexity Model Reference Adaptive Controllers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHanson, Curt; Schaefer, Jacob; Johnson, Marcus; Nguyen, Nhan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFlight research experiments have demonstrated that adaptive flight controls can be an effective technology for improving aircraft safety in the event of failures or damage. However, the nonlinear, timevarying nature of adaptive algorithms continues to challenge traditional methods for the verification and validation testing of safety-critical flight control systems. Increasingly complex adaptive control theories and designs are emerging, but only make testing challenges more difficult. A potential first step toward the acceptance of adaptive flight controllers by aircraft manufacturers, operators, and certification authorities is a very simple design that operates as an augmentation to a non-adaptive baseline controller. Three such controllers were developed as part of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration flight research experiment to determine the appropriate level of complexity required to restore acceptable handling qualities to an aircraft that has suffered failures or damage. The controllers consist of the same basic design, but incorporate incrementally-increasing levels of complexity. Derivations of the controllers and their adaptive parameter update laws are presented along with details of the controllers implementations.\n\nModal-space reference-model-tracking fuzzy control of earthquake excited structures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPark, Kwan-Soon; Ok, Seung-Yong\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper describes an adaptive modal-space reference-model-tracking fuzzy control technique for the vibration control of earthquake-excited structures. In the proposed approach, the fuzzy logic is introduced to update optimal control force so that the controlled structural response can track the desired response of a reference model. For easy and practical implementation, the reference model is constructed by assigning the target damping ratios to the first few dominant modes in modal space. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully achieves not only the adaptive fault-tolerant control system against partial actuator failures but also the robust performance against the variations of the uncertain system properties by redistributing the feedback control forces to the available actuators.\n\nApplication of model reference adaptive control to a flexible remote manipulator arm\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMeldrum, D. R.; Balas, M. J.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nAn exact modal state-space representation is derived in detail for a single-link, flexible remote manipulator with a noncollocated sensor and actuator. A direct model following adaptive controller is designed to control the torque at the pinned end of the arm so as to command the free end to track a prescribed sinusoidal motion. Conditions that must be satisfied in order for the controller to work are stated. Simulation results to date are discussed along with the potential of the model following adaptive control scheme in robotics and space environments.\n\nAdaptation or constraint? Reference-dependent scatter in honey bee dances\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVisscher, P. Kirk\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe waggle dance of the honey bee is used to recruit nest mates to a resource. Dancer bees, however, may indicate many directions within a single dance bout; we show that this scatter in honey bee dances is strongly dependent on the sensory modality used to determine a reference angle in the dance. Dances with a visual reference are more precise than those with a gravity reference. This finding undermines the idea that scatter is introduced into dances, which the bees could perform more precisely, in order to spread recruits out over resource patches. It also calls into question reported interspecific differences that had been interpreted as adaptations of the dance to different habitats. Our results support a non-adaptive hypothesis: that dance scatter results from sensory and performance constraints, rather than modulation of the scatter by the dancing bee. However, an alternative adaptive hypothesis cannot be ruled out. PMID:20585382\n\nAdaptation or constraint?

It is assumed that each subsystem s parameters are uncertain and the interconnection parameters are not known. In addition, mismatch can exist between each subsystem and its reference model. A strictly decentralized adaptive control scheme is developed, wherein each subsystem has access only to its own state but has the knowledge of all reference model states. The mismatch is estimated online for each subsystem and the mismatch estimates are used to adaptively modify the corresponding reference models. The adaptive control scheme is extended to the case with actuator failures in addition to mismatch.\n\nDynamics modeling and adaptive control of flexible manipulators\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSasiadek, J.

Once the preset resonance is not sustained, the performance of the micro-gyroscope is accordingly degraded. In this article, a direct model reference adaptive control loop which is integrated with a modified disturbance estimating observer (MDEO) is proposed to guarantee the resonant oscillations at drive mode and counterbalance the undesired disturbance mainly caused by quadrature error and cross-axis perturbation. The parameters of controller are on-line innovated by the dynamic error between the MDEO output and expected response. In addition, Lyapunov stability theory is employed to examine the stability of the closed-loop control system. Finally, the efficacy of numerical evaluation on the exerted time-varying angular rate, which is to be detected and measured by the gyroscope, is verified by intensive simulations.\n\nReference layer adaptive filtering (RLAF) for EEG artifact reduction in simultaneous EEG-fMRI.\n\nPubMed\n\nSteyrl, David; Krausz, Gunther; Koschutnig, Karl; Edlinger, GÃ¼nter; MÃ¼ller-Putz, Gernot R\n\n2017-04-01\n\nSimultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combines advantages of both methods, namely high temporal resolution of EEG and high spatial resolution of fMRI. However, EEG quality is limited due to severe artifacts caused by fMRI scanners. To improve EEG data quality substantially, we introduce methods that use a reusable reference layer EEG cap prototype in combination with adaptive filtering. The first method, reference layer adaptive filtering (RLAF), uses adaptive filtering with reference layer artifact data to optimize artifact subtraction from EEG. In the second method, multi band reference layer adaptive filtering (MBRLAF), adaptive filtering is performed on bandwidth limited sub-bands of the EEG and the reference channels. The results suggests that RLAF outperforms the baseline method, average artifact subtraction, in all settings and also its direct predecessor, reference layer artifact subtraction (RLAS), in lower (<35 Hz) frequency ranges. MBRLAF is computationally more demanding than RLAF, but highly effective in all EEG frequency ranges. Effectivity is determined by visual inspection, as well as root-mean-square voltage reduction and power reduction of EEG provided that physiological EEG components such as occipital EEG alpha power and visual evoked potentials (VEP) are preserved. We demonstrate that both, RLAF and MBRLAF, improve VEP quality. For that, we calculate the mean-squared-distance of single trial VEP to the mean VEP and estimate single trial VEP classification accuracies. We found that the average mean-squared-distance is lowest and the average classification accuracy is highest after MBLAF. RLAF was second best. In conclusion, the results suggests that RLAF and MBRLAF are potentially very effective in improving EEG quality of simultaneous EEG-fMRI.

Fast adaptation is referred to as the implementation of adaptive control with a large adaptive gain to reduce the tracking error rapidly; however, a large adaptive gain can lead to high-frequency oscillations which can adversely affect the robustness of an adaptive control law. A new adaptive control modification is presented that can achieve robust adaptation with a large adaptive gain without incurring high-frequency oscillations as with the standard model-reference adaptive control. The modification is based on the minimization of the Y2 norm of the tracking error, which is formulated as an optimal control problem. The optimality condition is used to derive the modification using the gradient method. The optimal control modification results in a stable adaptation and allows a large adaptive gain to be used for better tracking while providing sufficient robustness. A damping term (v) is added in the modification to increase damping as needed. Simulations were conducted on a damaged F-18 aircraft (McDonnell Douglas, now The Boeing Company, Chicago, Illinois) with both the standard baseline dynamic inversion controller and the adaptive optimal control modification technique. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modification in tracking a reference model.\n\nRobust Optimal Adaptive Control Method with Large Adaptive Gain\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNguyen, Nhan T.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn the presence of large uncertainties, a control system needs to be able to adapt rapidly to regain performance.

This method features the MRAS in a current control loop to estimate a rotor speed and position by using only current sensors. This method as well as almost all the conventional methods incorporates a mathematical model of the motor, which consists of parameters such as winding resistances, inductances, and an induced voltage constant. Hence, the important thing is to investigate how the deviation of these parameters affects the estimated rotor position. First, this paper proposes a structure of the sensorless control applied in the current control loop. Next, it proves the stability of the proposed method when motor parameters deviate from the nominal values, and derives the relationship between the estimated position and the deviation of the parameters in a steady state. Finally, some experimental results are presented to show performance and effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nA User-Centered Approach to Adaptive Hypertext Based on an Information Relevance Model\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMathe, Nathalie; Chen, James\n\n1994-01-01\n\nRapid and effective to information in large electronic documentation systems can be facilitated if information relevant in an individual user's content can be automatically supplied to this user. However most of this knowledge on contextual relevance is not found within the contents of documents, it is rather established incrementally by users during information access. We propose a new model for interactively learning contextual relevance during information retrieval, and incrementally adapting retrieved information to individual user profiles. The model, called a relevance network, records the relevance of references based on user feedback for specific queries and user profiles. It also generalizes such knowledge to later derive relevant references for similar queries and profiles. The relevance network lets users filter information by context of relevance. Compared to other approaches, it does not require any prior knowledge nor training. More importantly, our approach to adaptivity is user-centered. It facilitates acceptance and understanding by users by giving them shared control over the adaptation without disturbing their primary task. Users easily control when to adapt and when to use the adapted system. Lastly, the model is independent of the particular application used to access information, and supports sharing of adaptations among users.\n\nHybrid Adaptive Flight Control with Model Inversion Adaptation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNguyen, Nhan\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis study investigates a hybrid adaptive flight control method as a design possibility for a flight control system that can enable an effective adaptation strategy to deal with off-nominal flight conditions. The hybrid adaptive control blends both direct and indirect adaptive control in a model inversion flight control architecture. The blending of both direct and indirect adaptive control provides a much more flexible and effective adaptive flight control architecture than that with either direct or indirect adaptive control alone. The indirect adaptive control is used to update the model inversion controller by an on-line parameter estimation of uncertain plant dynamics based on two methods. The first parameter estimation method is an indirect adaptive law based on the Lyapunov theory, and the second method is a recursive least-squares indirect adaptive law. The model inversion controller is therefore made to adapt to changes in the plant dynamics due to uncertainty. As a result, the modeling error is reduced that directly leads to a decrease in the tracking error. In conjunction with the indirect adaptive control that updates the model inversion controller, a direct adaptive control is implemented as an augmented command to further reduce any residual tracking error that is not entirely eliminated by the indirect adaptive control.\n\nRoy's Adaptation Model-Guided Education and Promoting the Adaptation of Veterans With Lower Extremities Amputation.\n\nPubMed\n\nAzarmi, Somayeh; Farsi, Zahra\n\n2015-10-01\n\nAny defect in extremities of the body can affect different life aspects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Roy's adaptation model-guided education on promoting the adaptation of veterans with lower extremities amputation. In a randomized clinical trial, 60 veterans with lower extremities amputation referring to Kowsar Orthotics and Prosthetics Center of veterans clinic in Tehran, Iran, were recruited with convenience method and were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups during 2013 - 2014. For data collection, Roy's adaptation model questionnaire was used. After completing the questionnaires in both groups, maladaptive behaviors were determined in the intervention group and an education program based on Roy's adaptation model was implemented. After two months, both groups completed the questionnaires again. Data was analyzed with SPSS software. Independent t-test showed statistically significant differences between the two groups in the post-test stage in terms of the total score of adaptation (P = 0.001) as well as physiologic (P = 0.0001) and role function modes (P = 0.004). The total score of adaptation (139.43 Â± 5.45 to 127.54 Â± 14.55, P = 0.006) as well as the scores of physiologic (60.26 Â± 5.45 to 53.73 Â± 7.79, P = 0.001) and role function (20.30 Â± 2.42 to 18.13 Â± 3.18, P = 0.01) modes in the intervention group significantly increased, whereas the scores of self-concept (42.10 Â± 4.71 to 39.40 Â± 5.67, P = 0.21) and interdependence (16.76 Â± 2.22 to 16.30 Â± 2.57, P = 0.44) modes in the two stages did not have a significant difference. Findings of this research indicated that the Roy's adaptation model-guided education promoted the adaptation level of physiologic and role function modes in veterans with lower extremities amputation. However, this intervention could not promote adaptation in self-concept and interdependence modes. More intervention is advised based on Roy's adaptation model for improving the\n\nMars entry guidance based on an adaptive reference drag profile\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiang, Zixuan; Duan, Guangfei; Ren, Zhang\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe conventional Mars entry tracks a fixed reference drag profile (FRDP). To improve the landing precision, a novel guidance approach that utilizes an adaptive reference drag profile (ARDP) is presented. The entry flight is divided into two phases. For each phase, a family of drag profiles corresponding to various trajectory lengths is planned. Two update windows are investigated for the reference drag profile. At each window, the ARDP is selected online from the profile database according to the actual range-to-go. The tracking law for the selected drag profile is designed based on the feedback linearization. Guidance approaches using the ARDP and the FRDP are then tested and compared. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ARDP approach achieves much higher guidance precision than the conventional FRDP approach.\n\nDecentralized adaptive control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOh, B. J.; Jamshidi, M.; Seraji, H.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nA decentralized adaptive control is proposed to stabilize and track the nonlinear, interconnected subsystems with unknown parameters. The adaptation of the controller gain is derived by using model reference adaptive control theory based on Lyapunov's direct method. The adaptive gains consist of sigma, proportional, and integral combination of the measured and reference values of the corresponding subsystem. The proposed control is applied to the joint control of a two-link robot manipulator, and the performance in computer simulation corresponds with what is expected in theoretical development.\n\nGeneral mental ability and two types of adaptation to unforeseen change: applying discontinuous growth models to the task-change paradigm.\n\nPubMed\n\nLang, Jonas W B; Bliese, Paul D\n\n2009-03-01\n\nThe present research provides new insights into the relationship between general mental ability (GMA) and adaptive performance by applying a discontinuous growth modeling framework to a study of unforeseen change on a complex decision-making task. The proposed framework provides a way to distinguish 2 types of adaptation (transition adaptation and reacquisition adaptation) from 2 common performance components (skill acquisition and basal task performance). Transition adaptation refers to an immediate loss of performance following a change, whereas reacquisition adaptation refers to the ability to relearn a changed task over time. Analyses revealed that GMA was negatively related to transition adaptation and found no evidence for a relationship between GMA and reacquisition adaptation. The results are integrated within the context of adaptability research, and implications of using the described discontinuous growth modeling framework to study adaptability are discussed.

H.; Metter, E.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nDynamic models for two space station configurations were derived. Space shuttle docking disturbances and their effects on the station and solar panels are quantified. It is shown that hard shuttle docking can cause solar panel buckling. Soft docking and berthing can substantially reduce structural loads at the expense of large shuttle and station attitude excursions. It is found predocking shuttle momentum reduction is necessary to achieve safe and routine operations. A direct model reference adaptive control is synthesized and evaluated for the station model parameter errors and plant dynamics truncations. The rigid body and the flexible modes are treated. It is shown that convergence of the adaptive algorithm can be achieved in 100 seconds with reasonable performance even during shuttle hard docking operations in which station mass and inertia are instantaneously changed by more than 100%.\n\nFlight Test of Composite Model Reference Adaptive Control (CMRAC) Augmentation Using NASA AirSTAR Infrastructure\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGregory, Irene M.; Gadient, ROss; Lavretsky, Eugene\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper presents flight test results of a robust linear baseline controller with and without composite adaptive control augmentation.

Neural networks which exhibit features of learning and associative memory can also be modeled by a system of Potts spins. A spontaneous behavior of hopping from one discrete attractor state to another (referred to as latching) has been proposed to be associated with higher cognitive functions. Here we propose a model in which both the stochastic dynamics of Potts models and an adaptive potential function are present. A latching dynamics is observed in a limited region of the noise(temperature)-adaptation parameter space. We hence suggest noise as a fundamental factor in such alternations alongside adaptation. From a dynamical systems point of view, the noise-adaptation alternations may be the underlying mechanism for multi-stability in attractor-based models. An optimality criterion for realistic models is finally inferred.\n\nProgress in modelling agricultural impacts of and adaptations to climate change.\n\nPubMed\n\nRÃ¶tter, R P; Hoffmann, M P; Koch, M; MÃ¼ller, C\n\n2018-06-01\n\nModelling is a key tool to explore agricultural impacts of and adaptations to climate change. Here we report recent progress made especially referring to the large project initiatives MACSUR and AgMIP; in particular, in modelling potential crop impacts from field to global using multi-model ensembles. We identify two main fields where further progress is necessary: a more mechanistic understanding of climate impacts and management options for adaptation and mitigation; and focusing on cropping systems and integrative multi-scale assessments instead of single season and crops, especially in complex tropical and neglected but important cropping systems.

This manuscript introduces an eight-dimensional model specifically designed to address the sociotechnical challenges involved in design, development, implementation, use and evaluation of HIT within complex adaptive healthcare systems. The eight dimensions are not independent, sequential or hierarchical, but rather are interdependent and inter-related concepts similar to compositions of other complex adaptive systems. Hardware and software computing infrastructure refers to equipment and software used to power, support and operate clinical applications and devices. Clinical content refers to textual or numeric data and images that constitute the 'language' of clinical applications. The human--computer interface includes all aspects of the computer that users can see, touch or hear as they interact with it. People refers to everyone who interacts in some way with the system, from developer to end user, including potential patient-users. Workflow and communication are the processes or steps involved in ensuring that patient care tasks are carried out effectively. Two additional dimensions of the model are internal organisational features (eg, policies, procedures and culture) and external rules and regulations, both of which may facilitate or constrain many aspects of the preceding dimensions. The final dimension is measurement and monitoring, which refers to the process of measuring and evaluating both intended and unintended consequences of HIT implementation and use. We illustrate how our model has been successfully applied in real-world complex adaptive settings to understand and improve HIT applications at various stages of development and implementation.\n\nA model for sequential decoding overflow due to a noisy carrier reference. [communication performance prediction\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLayland, J. W.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nAn approximate analysis of the effect of a noisy carrier reference on the performance of sequential decoding is presented. The analysis uses previously developed techniques for evaluating noisy reference performance for medium-rate uncoded communications adapted to sequential decoding for data rates of 8 to 2048 bits/s. In estimating the ten to the minus fourth power deletion probability thresholds for Helios, the model agrees with experimental data to within the experimental tolerances. The computational problem involved in sequential decoding, carrier loop effects, the main characteristics of the medium-rate model, modeled decoding performance, and perspectives on future work are discussed.\n\nAdaptive control of a jet turboshaft engine driving a variable pitch propeller using multiple models\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAhmadian, Narjes; Khosravi, Alireza; Sarhadi, Pouria\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIn this paper, a multiple model adaptive control (MMAC) method is proposed for a gas turbine engine. The model of a twin spool turbo-shaft engine driving a variable pitch propeller includes various operating points. Variations in fuel flow and propeller pitch inputs produce different operating conditions which force the controller to be adopted rapidly. Important operating points are three idle, cruise and full thrust cases for the entire flight envelope. A multi-input multi-output (MIMO) version of second level adaptation using multiple models is developed. Also, stability analysis using Lyapunov method is presented. The proposed method is compared with two conventional first level adaptation and model reference adaptive control techniques. Simulation results for JetCat SPT5 turbo-shaft engine demonstrate the performance and fidelity of the proposed method.\n\nA Bayesian framework for adaptive selection, calibration, and validation of coarse-grained models of atomistic systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFarrell, Kathryn; Oden, J.

A Bayesian framework is developed to address uncertainties in parameters, data, and model selection. Algorithms for computing output sensitivities to parameter variances, model evidence and posterior model plausibilities for given data, and for computing what are referred to as Occam Categories in reference to a rough measure of model simplicity, make up components of the overall approach. Computational results are provided for representative applications.\n\nA New Socio-technical Model for Studying Health Information Technology in Complex Adaptive Healthcare Systems\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSittig, Dean F.; Singh, Hardeep\n\n2011-01-01\n\nConceptual models have been developed to address challenges inherent in studying health information technology (HIT).

On-line supervision of the turbidity point by means of vibrational spectroscopy has recently emerged as a promising technique to monitor the DP of MF resins. However, spectroscopic determination of the DP relies on chemometric models, which are usually sensitive to drifts caused by instrumental and/or sample-associated changes occurring over time. In order to detect the time point when drifts start causing prediction bias, we here explore a universal drift detector based on a faded version of the Page-Hinkley (PH) statistic, which we test in three data streams from an industrial MF resin production process. We employ committee disagreement (CD), computed as the variance of model predictions from an ensemble of partial least squares (PLS) models, as a measure for sample-wise prediction uncertainty and use the PH statistic to detect changes in this quantity. We further explore supervised and unsupervised strategies for (semi-)automatic model adaptation upon detection of a drift. For the former, manual reference measurements are requested whenever statistical thresholds on Hotelling's T 2 and/or Q-Residuals are violated. Models are subsequently re-calibrated using weighted partial least squares in order to increase the influence of newer samples, which increases the flexibility when adapting to new (drifted) states. Unsupervised model adaptation is carried out exploiting the dual antecedent-consequent structure of a recently developed fuzzy systems variant of PLS termed FLEXFIS-PLS. In particular, antecedent parts are updated while maintaining the internal structure of the local linear predictors (i.e. the consequents). We found improved drift detection capability of the CD compared to Hotelling's T 2 and Q-Residuals when used in combination with the proposed PH test. Furthermore, we found that active\n\nReference and Standard Atmosphere Models\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Dale L.; Roberts, Barry C.; Vaughan, William W.; Parker, Nelson C. (Technical Monitor)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThis paper describes the development of standard and reference atmosphere models along with the history of their origin and use since the mid 19th century. The first \"Standard Atmospheres\" were established by international agreement in the 1920's. Later some countries, notably the United States, also developed and published \"Standard Atmospheres\". The term \"Reference Atmospheres\" is used to identify atmosphere models for specific geographical locations. Range Reference Atmosphere Models developed first during the 1960's are examples of these descriptions of the atmosphere. This paper discusses the various models, scopes, applications and limitations relative to use in aerospace industry activities.\n\nA diversified portfolio model of adaptability.\n\nPubMed\n\nChandra, Siddharth; Leong, Frederick T L\n\n2016-12-01\n\nA new model of adaptability, the diversified portfolio model (DPM) of adaptability, is introduced. In the 1950s, Markowitz developed the financial portfolio model by demonstrating that investors could optimize the ratio of risk and return on their portfolios through risk diversification. The DPM integrates attractive features of a variety of models of adaptability, including Linville's self-complexity model, the risk and resilience model, and Bandura's social cognitive theory. The DPM draws on the concept of portfolio diversification, positing that diversified investment in multiple life experiences, life roles, and relationships promotes positive adaptation to life's challenges. The DPM provides a new integrative model of adaptability across the biopsychosocial levels of functioning. More importantly, the DPM addresses a gap in the literature by illuminating the antecedents of adaptive processes studied in a broad array of psychological models. The DPM is described in relation to the biopsychosocial model and propositions are offered regarding its utility in increasing adaptiveness. Recommendations for future research are also offered.

The method, which is based on the adaptive noise canceling (ANC) technique, will be referred to here as the adaptive sinusoid canceler (ASC). The ASC eliminates sinusoidal contamination by tracking its frequency and achieving a narrower bandwidth than typical notch filters. The detected frequency is used to digitally generate an internal reference instead of relying on an external one as ANC filters typically do. The filter's bandwidth adjusts to achieve faster and more accurate convergence. In this paper, the focus of the discussion and the data is physiological signals, specifically electrocorticographic (ECoG) neural data contaminated with power line noise, but the presented technique could be applicable to other recordings as well. On simulated data, the ASC was able to reliably track the noise's frequency, properly adjust its bandwidth, and outperform comparative methods including standard notch filters and an adaptive line enhancer. These results were reinforced by visual results obtained from real ECoG data. The ASC showed that it could be an effective method for increasing signal to noise ratio in the presence of drifting sinusoidal noise, which is of significant interest for biomedical applications.\n\nAdaptive Decentralized Control\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1985-04-01\n\nand implementation of the decentralized controllers.

An appropriate normalization strategy with reliable reference genes is required for calculating gene expression across diverse experimental conditions. In this study, we aim to identify the most stable reference genes for expression studies of xenobiotic adaptation in Tetranychus urticae, an extremely polyphagous herbivore causing significant yield reduction of agriculture. We chose eight commonly used housekeeping genes as candidates. The qRT-PCR expression data for these genes were evaluated from seven populations: a susceptible and three acaricide resistant populations feeding on lima beans, and three other susceptible populations which had been shifted host from lima beans to three other plant species. The stability of the candidate reference genes was then assessed using four different algorithms (comparative ÎCt method, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper). Additionally, we used an online web-based tool (RefFinder) to assign an overall final rank for each candidate gene. Our study found that CycA and Rp49 are best for investigating gene expression in acaricide susceptible and resistant populations. GAPDH, Rp49, and Rpl18 are best for host plant shift studies. And GAPDH and Rp49 were the most stable reference genes when investigating gene expression under changes in both experimental conditions. These results will facilitate research in revealing molecular mechanisms underlying the xenobiotic adaptation of this notorious agricultural pest.\n\nSelection of Reference Genes for Expression Studies of Xenobiotic Adaptation in Tetranychus urticae\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMorales, Mariany Ashanty; Mendoza, Bianca Marie; Lavine, Laura Corley; Lavine, Mark Daniel; Walsh, Douglas Bruce; Zhu, Fang\n\n2016-01-01\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is an extensively used, high-throughput method to analyze transcriptional expression of genes of interest.

Since it is not a commonly used drug, clinical experience with its dosing is sparse. In earlier work [1], we developed a dynamic system model that accurately predicts the effect of bivalirudin given dosage over time and patient physiological characteristics. This paper develops adaptive dosage controllers that regulate its effect to desired levels. To that end, and in the case that bivalirudin model parameters are available, we develop a Model Reference Control law. In the case that model parameters are unknown, an indirect Model Reference Adaptive Control scheme is applied to estimate model parameters first and then adapt the controller. Alternatively, direct Model Reference Adaptive Control is applied to adapt the controller directly without estimating model parameters first. Our algorithms are validated using actual patient data from a large hospital in the Boston area.\n\nAdaptive Control Of Remote Manipulator\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSeraji, Homayoun\n\n1989-01-01\n\nRobotic control system causes remote manipulator to follow closely reference trajectory in Cartesian reference frame in work space, without resort to computationally intensive mathematical model of robot dynamics and without knowledge of robot and load parameters.

The background and context for the development of the model and the approach are described. A process for using this reference model to trace top level interoperability directives to specific sets of engineering interface standards that must be implemented to meet these directives is discussed. Issues in developing a 'universal' reference model are also identified.\n\nAdaptive optimization of reference intensity for optical coherence imaging using galvanometric mirror tilting method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Ji-hyun; Han, Jae-Ho; Jeong, Jichai\n\n2015-09-01\n\nIntegration time and reference intensity are important factors for achieving high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity in optical coherence tomography (OCT). In this context, we present an adaptive optimization method of reference intensity for OCT setup. The reference intensity is automatically controlled by tilting a beam position using a Galvanometric scanning mirror system. Before sample scanning, the OCT system acquires two dimensional intensity map with normalized intensity and variables in color spaces using false-color mapping. Then, the system increases or decreases reference intensity following the map data for optimization with a given algorithm. In our experiments, the proposed method successfully corrected the reference intensity with maintaining spectral shape, enabled to change integration time without manual calibration of the reference intensity, and prevented image degradation due to over-saturation and insufficient reference intensity. Also, SNR and sensitivity could be improved by increasing integration time with automatic adjustment of the reference intensity. We believe that our findings can significantly aid in the optimization of SNR and sensitivity for optical coherence tomography systems.\n\nAdapting to life: ocean biogeochemical modelling and adaptive remeshing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHill, J.; Popova, E. E.; Ham, D. A.; Piggott, M. D.; Srokosz, M.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nAn outstanding problem in biogeochemical modelling of the ocean is that many of the key processes occur intermittently at small scales, such as the sub-mesoscale, that are not well represented in global ocean models. This is partly due to their failure to resolve sub-mesoscale phenomena, which play a significant role in vertical nutrient supply. Simply increasing the resolution of the models may be an inefficient computational solution to this problem. An approach based on recent advances in adaptive mesh computational techniques may offer an alternative. Here the first steps in such an approach are described, using the example of a simple vertical column (quasi-1-D) ocean biogeochemical model. We present a novel method of simulating ocean biogeochemical behaviour on a vertically adaptive computational mesh, where the mesh changes in response to the biogeochemical and physical state of the system throughout the simulation. We show that the model reproduces the general physical and biological behaviour at three ocean stations (India, Papa and Bermuda) as compared to a high-resolution fixed mesh simulation and to observations. The use of an adaptive mesh does not increase the computational error, but reduces the number of mesh elements by a factor of 2-3. Unlike previous work the adaptivity metric used is flexible and we show that capturing the physical behaviour of the model is paramount to achieving a reasonable solution. Adding biological quantities to the adaptivity metric further refines the solution. We then show the potential of this method in two case studies where we change the adaptivity metric used to determine the varying mesh sizes in order to capture the dynamics of chlorophyll at Bermuda and sinking detritus at Papa. We therefore demonstrate that adaptive meshes may provide a suitable numerical technique for simulating seasonal or transient biogeochemical behaviour at high vertical resolution whilst minimising the number of elements in the mesh.

It has also been successfully applied to problems in robotics, such as adaptive camera stabilization and sensor noise cancelation. In previous applications to inverse control problems, the algorithm was applied to the velocity control of a plant dominated by viscous and elastic elements. Naive application of the adaptive filter model to the displacement (as opposed to velocity) control of this plant results in unstable learning and control. To be more generally useful in engineering problems, it is essential to remove this restriction to enable the stable control of plants of any order. We address this problem here by developing a biohybrid model reference adaptive control (MRAC) scheme, which stabilizes the control algorithm for strictly proper plants. We evaluate the performance of this novel cerebellar-inspired algorithm with MRAC scheme in the experimental control of a dielectric electroactive polymer, a class of artificial muscle. The results show that the augmented cerebellar algorithm is able to accurately control the displacement response of the artificial muscle. The proposed solution not only greatly extends the practical applicability of the cerebellar-inspired algorithm, but may also shed light on cerebellar involvement in a wider range of biological control tasks.\n\nA spin-adapted size-extensive state-specific multi-reference perturbation theory.
