The results since 1882, when the prizes began to be given, have been most satisfactory. Not only is great interest taken in this fascinating subject by the boys themselves, but careful attention is given to their instruction, and the head master of the Worcester writes an excellent special treatise every year for the use of the cadets, on the region that has been selected for the subject of examination. It is early to look for practical results in the subse- quent careers of our prize cadets, yet one of them has already reached the threshold of an unknown region, and is eager to plan a more thorough exploration. The policy of the Council, with regard to the promotion of general geographical education, has been modified since 1897. Then we con- templated the establishment of a School of Greography in London ; but it was found that, for several reasons, such a plan was impracticable. We then turned to Oxford, believing that one of our ancient seats of learning would offer the best locality, certainly the most fitting locality, for such an institution as we desired to see established. Accordingly I submitted a proposal for the creation of a School of Geography at Oxford, under the joint control of the University and the Society, with expenses shared by the two bodies. My plan was favourably received by the Yice-Chancellor, and by the other authorities whose concurrence was necessary, and an arrangement has now been arrived at which, I believe, will have satisfactory results. Our Society agrees to pay £400 a year, and the University agrees to grant a like sum, towards the expenses of an Oxford School of Geography. It will be under the superintendence of Mr. Mackinder, subject to the supervision of a joint committee consisting, in addition to the Yice-Chancellor, whc will have a seat ex officio^ of four members of the University and thre members of our Council. Mr. Mackinder, as University Reader, wi' lecture twice a week during the three terms, and will also have speci classes for advanced students. There will be an assistant who will lectu on physical geography, will hold classes five times a week, and will tea surveying and cartography; and there will be two lecturers, one certain branches of physical geography, and one on ancient geograp It is expected that undergraduates will attend one or other of the cou' of lectures, for already upwards of a hundred undergraduates attend Mackinder*s lectures. It is intended that a diploma shall be grantc students who complete the course, and there will be one or two scl* ships of £60. These will be inducements to graduates to spend a y mastering the principles of geography, and the knowledge requii teaching the science and for making it practically useful. The floor of the old Ashmolean building at Oxford has been set apart i purposes of the School of Geography, and an annual sum will be d to the supply of books and appliances. The deplorable neglect of geography in our public schools ii ADDRESS TO THE ROTAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY. o the want of competent inBtructors, to an absence of appreciation of the importance of geography, and to the system of competitive examinations which has proved to be the gpreat enemy of education and learning. We see the consequences in the geographical ignorance of public men leading to serious mistakes, to risks of war, to refusals of help to useful enterprises ; and in the failure of economists, merchants, and others to understand the questions they have to consider in their more important bearings, owing to absence of appreciation of their geographical aspects. We hope that the new School of Geography will, in the course of time, be a remedy for this lamentable neglect of one of the most essential branches of a liberal education. We look forward to our public schools being leavened by a new generation of masters well instructed in the principles of geography, and to new generations of public men whose geographical education will not have been neglected. The great success of our efforts to prepare travellers for the work of exploring, justifies Dur expectation that when the means of learning are once supplied at Oxford, there will be no lack of desire to avail themselves of it, not only among students in the University itself, but throughout the country. For I wish it to be known and understood that all students will be welcomed at the School of Geography, whether attached to the University or not. It will be the only institution of the kind in the kingdom. The Council has agreed to continue its contribution to the salary of the reader at Cambridge for another term of yeai-s. The GFeographical Association has persevered in its useful labours with a view to promoting and assisting geographical teaching. Mr. Andrews and Mr. Dickenson, under the auspices of the Association, have been devoting themselves to the production of an excellent set of slides illustrating in colour the physical, political, and commercial geo- graphy of the continents, the British Isles, and the British Colonies. These slides have been very carefully designed by men who have an intimate knowledge alike of geographical facts and of teaching require- ments; and I hope that their educational value will be appreciated, and that they will be extensively used in schools. Numerous orders have, I understand, been already received for them. Among the agents for disseminating geographical knowledge, our own library and map-room take a prominent place. With regard to the subjects catalogue, the laborious task of entering all the geographical works in the library, including articles and papers in periodicals, has at length been completed. The cards now number 100,850; while the title of every new book, pamphlet, or article is published in the Journal and added to the collection of card titles. This means an addition of about 2000 titles eveiy year, a figure which gives some idea of the immense volume of geographical work which is being done in all parts of the world. The collection and writing of these titles is a simple B 2 4 AINStRE^S TO THE ROVAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETT. matter oompared with their olasaification, so as to form a subject index to the library. The cards for all accessions since 1893 are kept folly classified, while the classification of the rest is making steady progress^ The great advantages of the card catalogue have been fally demonstrated in the practical work of the library during the last two years. Many Fellows of the Society have expressed their satisfaction at the rapidity with which they have been supplied with references to the literature of the subject of their studies. The thanks of the Society are due to our librarian for the way in which he has carried through the difficult and heavy work of the subjects catalogue, and for the amount of thought he has bestowed on the complicated questions connected with the classification. We have also to thank Mr. Heawood, not only for the large share he has taken in this very toilsome labour, but also for his valuable contributions to our JourndL Mr. Heawood is an accomplished geographer, with an almost unequalled knowledge of the literature of African geography especially. I very much regret that the Society has lost his services for the pregent, except as a contributor to the Journal, but I trust that before long we shall again have the benefit of his valuable co-operation. The increased use that is made of our library and map-room proves that it is not only our numbers that are increasing, but also the intelligent interest that is taken in our science; and that a far greater number of the Fellows have become students of geography than was formerly the case. While in the year from May, 1895, to April, 1896, the number of Fellows borrowing books was 732, during the twelve months just elapsed the number amounted to 992. But for every one who comes to the library to borrow books, two at least come to consult them. So that geographical information, during the past year, has been supplied directly to fully 3000 persons. In addition to those who come to the library, a considerable number of Fellows and of the general public apply for information by letter, which is always supplied when it falls within the scope of the Society's very wide definition of geography. In the map-room there has been similar activity in the supply o' information, the number of inquirers having increased from 2230 : 1896-97 to 3223 during the present jear. Of these 79 came specially consult the Ordnance Survey Maps. It had often occurred lo me that it would be a great advantage geographers, and that it would tend to make the narratives of explc more clear and accurate, if an authoritative list of geographical V with definitions, was drawn up for their use. The subject was bi to the notice of the Council by our former Secretary, Colonel Ja in 1834. His view was that the adoption and promulgation of a d and comprehenfiiTe system of nomenclature would raise geogrf the rank of a positive and exact science. The time now seems ADDRESS TO THE ROYAL GCOORAPHICAL SOCIETT. 5 have arrived when Colonel Jackson's valuable snggestion might usefully be adopted. A Nomenolature Committee has accordingly been formed, and a list of 1300 geographical terms has been prepared by Dr. Mill. They have been placed under different headings, and have been distributed among experts for revision and additions, after whioh they will be more widely distributed for further suggestions. In this way I hope that, before very long, we shall be in a position to suggest a convenient and systematic geographical terminology. At the same time we shall be able to complete a list of obsolete terms, to indicate what words are to be invested with definite technical meanings, and to fix those meanings. I have so often felt the want of help of this kind myself, that I cannot ■doubt the value it will prove to others. Turning from our efforts to facilitate and advance the cause of ex- ploration to the work in the field during the last year, I think that there is room for congratulation. In Central Asia Captain Deasy, who was last heard of at Kashgar, has discovered the source of the river Ehotan. In Africa good progress is being made in the more thorough work which succeeds the first pioneering discoveries, and prepares the way for that accurate triangulation, the importance of which Was impressed upon us by General Chapman at the International Congress in 1895. In the presentation of the medals this day, we have shown how very highly we estimate the value of the scientific labours of distinguished French geographers in Africa. Besides Captain Binger and M. Foureau, who have received the Hoyal awards, we welcome the return of Major Idarchand from his remarkable journey across Africa, the scientific results of which cannot fail to be very important. Our own explorers 'have not been idle. Colonel Maodonald has just returned from the ex- pedition which he made into the country lying to the north of Uganda, between Lake Hudolf and the Nile. He and the able officers who served under him have done a considerable amount of new geographical work. For the first time the west shore of Lake Budolf has been accurately laid down by Captain Austin ; while Colonel Macdonald himself, the late Captain Eirkpatrick, and other officers, have added many new features to the map of the region they have explored. Captain G. E. Smith, another officer of Engineers, has plaoed at the •Society*s disposal one of the most important pieces of work that have been accomplished in Africa in recent times. It consists of the maps •embodying his triangulation of the country from Mombasa to Mount Elgon. This triangulation must form the basis of all future carto- graphical work in that part of Africa. The valuable survey completed by Captain Close and Captain Boileau in the country between Lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika, for the purpose of fixing the boundary between 'German and British territory, was executed in concert with a party of 'German survejnng officers. The results have already been submitted •to the Society, in the very interesting paper read by Captain Boileau 6 ADDRESS TO THE ROYAL OEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETV. at one of our recent evening meetings, when Mr. A. L. Wallace also oommnnicated to ns an account of his thorough exploration of Lake Bukwa. Further north Captain Wellby, who has already done good work in Tibet, is making his way southwards from Abyssinia, into an almost unknown region of the greatest geographical interest, including the valleys of the upper Sobat and its tributaries. The map of the Blantyre highlands, and the well-executed chart of Lake Nyasa, show that the officials in British Central Africa are diUgently engaged on useful surveying work. I confidently anticipate valuable geographical results from the expedition under Mr. Moore, which recently started for Lake Tan- ganyika, having received a grant of £600 and a loan of instruments from this Society. The lake itself will be sounded and dredged, the surrounding region will be examined, and geographical work of im- portance will be done to the northward. An expectation is entertained, not without good grounds, that the investig^ations of Mr. Moore's expedition will furnish a clue to the physical history of this part of Central Africa. For when a sufficient amount of reliable data has been accumulated by labotlrers in the field, we look for well-founded generali- zations from the leaders of geographical research. We have recently had a remarkable example of the use that may be made of the work of travellers, in the very able conclusions of Colonel Church, embodied in his admirable address to the geographical section of the British Association last year. He generalized on the physical history of a large area of South America, by piecing together the facts collected by himself and by many other travellers during their exploring work in the field. Much more information is needed by geographers from that most interesting of the partly unknown continents, although a great deal of good work has recently been achieved by South American explorers. Don Francisco Moreno, whose presence in this country on work connected with the Chile-Argentine arbitration, has enabled uf to become better acquainted with some parts of his country of which w scarcely knew anything before, has done an immense amount of valuab) geographical work. He has explored the eastern slopes of the Pat gonian Andes, and discovered numerous alpine lakes, and he survey the lofty region of the puna of Atacama ; while the museum at La Fla under his auspices, is an institution where explorers are trained a instructed, and whence geographical information is disseminated. 1 remarkable journeys of Sir Martin Conway in South America } shown us how much may be done by a keen and instructed obserr a short time. His triangulation of the western slopes of the Cor Beal from Sorata to lUimani, valuable as it certainly is to graphers, is not more so than his admirable descriptions of the mou and of the region round La Paz. His attempted ascent of Sarmiento, in Tierra del Fuego, is a remarkable feat, and is ADDRESS TO THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY. 7 effort that has ever been made to explore the mooBtaiiis and glaciers of that southern extension of the American continent. No doubt it will not be the last* The polar regions are reoeiYing more and more attention, beoanse they contain the largest unknown areas in the world, and also by reason of the specially valuable scientific results to be derived from their ex- ploration. There is not yet any news of the American and Norwegian expeditions which have proceeded up Sir Thomas Smith's sound, led by Peary and Sverdrup, with the object of discoveriog the northern side of Greenland; nor can there be any intelligence of Mr. Wellman, who wintered in Franz Josef Land, until the autumn. But His Boyal High- ness the Duke of Abruzzi has sailed in the Norwegian whaler Jamm^ re-named the Stella Polarij with the glorious cry of '* Northward ho I \" and, without knowing his special object, for we have not been informed, we bid him heartily ** God speed.\" I hope that British arctic enterprise is not altogether a thing of the past. If it is, we wish all possible success to the friendly emulation of our brother geographers without fear of rivalry. The combined nations of the world will never approach the achievements of Britons in the arctic regions, for all there is left to do is not a tithe of what has been completed under the Union Jack. The southern polar region is now the great object of our efforts ; and I desire particularly to ask your attention to the various aspects of antarctic enterprise, but before doing so we must glance at the proceed- ings of the Belgian expedition, of that sent out by Sir George Newnes, and at the work of the Valdivia. In August, 1896, the Belgica was being strengthened and fitted out at Sandefjord, in Norway. She is a small vessel of 250 tons, built of pine at Drammen about twelve years ago. I visited her with her commander, M. de Gerlache, and saw that the new work was being thoroughly well done, including an outer coating of greenheart. Passing the evening with M. de Gerlache, I was impressed with his knowledge of the subject, and with his youthful enthusiasm. I also saw one of his young assistants, M. ArQtowski, and did what I could to farther his wishes. The others were M. Danco, who took the magnetic observations ; M. Baoovitza, the biologist ; and Dr. Cook. The gallant adventurers were resolved to do all that was possible in the cause of science, with very limited means which caused delays. It was not until January 14, 1898, that the Belgica was able to leave the Straits of Magellan, and shape a course for the South Sbetlands. M. de Gerlache has an excellent deep-sea sounding apparatus on board, and seven sound- ings, with serial temperatures, were taken between Staten island and Bransfield strait. On the 24th Hughes bay was reached, and M. de Gerlache reports the discovery of islands, which he named the Palmer group, and Danco land. Here M. Bacovitza collected an insect and a spider, the first of the antarctic land fauna, if, indeed, the South Shetlands 8 ADDRESS TO THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETr. are to be oonaidered antarctic, as well as liohens, mosses, and grasses. On February 12 the Belgica entered the Pacific ooean, and steered for Alexandra Land, but was unable to approach it ; and on the 28th she was in lat. 70\"\" 20' S., and long. 85'' W. Here M. de Gerlaohe entered the polar pack, and sucoeeded in reaching 71° 31' S., in long. 85° 16' W. On March 3, as no further progress oould be made to the south, the Belgica 8 head was turned northwards, and she bored through a very close pack for 7 or 8 miles ; but on the 10th she was finally beset, at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the edge of the pack, and obliged to winter in it, the sun being absent from May 17 to July 21. The position was 71° 36' S., in long. 87° 39' W. As this is the first time that any one has ever wintered in the antarctic regions, the more complete and detailed account of the movements and appearance of the ice throughout the winter months will be extremely interesting. The isolated explorers had the misfortune to lose one of their num- ber, Lieut. Emile Danco, by death on June 5. On the other hand, they were fortunate in the great number of seals and penguins that frequented the neighbourhood of the ship, and enabled them to ensure the preservation of health by a diet of fresh meat. In the spring small openings and channels began to appear in the ice, which was 3 to 6 feet in thickness. During three months all hands were hard at work at a canal to reach open water — a consummation which was attained on March 14 of the present year. The Belgica was only once subjected to any pressure from the ice during the winter. On Maroh 28 she returned safely to Punt a Arenas. Valuable series of observations were registered throughout the winter, and collections were made from various depths. The expedition of M. de Gerlache will be memorable in the annals of polar exploration alike for its valuable results, and for having been the first that ever wintered within the Antarctic Circle. Another antarctic expedition was organized by Sir George Newnes and despatched last autumn. A vessel named the Pollux^ built at Arendal, was purchased and fitted for the work in Norway. She is manned with a crew of twenty-five men, including two mates, two engineers, and a master named Jensen. Her name was chang^ to the Southern Cross. Sir George Newnes informs me that the clothing and provisioning of the expedition received the most careful attention. Mr. Borchgrevink was appointed leader of the landing party and scientific staff, which consists of Mr. Golbeck, r.n.r., and Mr. Louis Bemacchi as magnetic observers, Mr. Evans and Mr. Hansen eus zoologists. Dr. Herlof Klovstad as medical officer, and Mr. Fougner as general assistant. They are thoroughly equipped with scientific instruments. The equipment also includes boats, kayaks, and sleighs for dogs, which were procured from Kussia. When the late Mr. Svend Foyn, of Tonsberg, sent the ship Antarctic to the southern seas for whaling purposes in 1995, her commander. ADDRESS TO THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETT. 9 <yaptain Christensen, steamed through the paok and reaohed the coast of Tiotoria Land, effecting landings at one of the Possession islands of Sir Barnes Boss, and at Cape Adare. Captain Jensen was one of the mates on l)oard the Antarettc^ and Mr. Borchgrevink was also serving on board. Xeaving England on August 22, Mr. Borchgrevink and Captain Jensen followed the lead of Captain Christensen, and have also snooeeded in reaching Cape Adare. They sighted the Balleny islands, and were forty- two days in the pack. But on February 15 last, very high snow-covered land was sighted, during a heavy gale with terrific squalls and a high «ea. Next day the gale increased, and on the 17th tiie SotUhem Cross \"was anchored in 5 fothoms, at a distance of three quarters of a mile from the beach. A landing was effected on the 18th. The dogs were got on shore with the Finn drivers, and several boat-loads of stores and pro- visions were landed. But on the evening of the 20th there was another farioas gale, the engines were worked at three-quarter speed, to ease the strain on the cables, and during the squalls the deck was actually strewn with pebbles blown from the adjacent mountains. The work of building the house and landing stores was steadily proceeded with from the 21st to the 25th, and on the 26th another terrific gale began. The starboard anchor was lost, the engines were worked at full speed, and at last a refuge was foand for the ship at the south end of Robertson bay. On the 27tb, three of the party set out to ascend a peak bearing south-south- west from Cape Adare, landing on a pebbly beach. They made for the peak across snow-drifts and glaciers, but were stopped by an inaccessible ice-mass after reaching a height of 2300 feet. The country inland ap- peared to be an immense undulating })lateau covered with glaciers. On the 28th the house was completed, and Mr. Borchgrevink landed with the scientific staff, to winter on this desolate spit of land. The Southern Cross then returned, arriving at Port Chalmers, New Zealand, on March 16 last. It is a ten*ibly severe climate, and some anxiety at the hardships the landing-party may be exposed to during the winter is inevitable. There is also the danger of Cape Adare being blockaded by considerable fragments of the pack, as was the case when Sir James Boss discovered it. This would make communication with the shore next year very difficult. We have no experience of men having with- stood for months on shore such climatic conditions as Victoria Land presents. But we must hope for the best. The intention is to take SL series of magnetic and meteorological observations, make biological collections, and to penetrate inland with dog-sleighs in the spring. 2^ext year the vessel will return to Cape Adare to bring back the landing party. Sir George Newnes informs me that the expedition sails under the British flag, and that the Duke of York showed his interest by presenting the ship with a Union Jack. This is a most praiseworthy enterprise on the part of a private in- dividual. The observations cannot fail to be valuable, and all concerned 10 ADDRESS TO THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY. deserve our warmest sympathy for their zeal in facing great hardships and dangers in the cause of science. We cordially wish them all pos- sible success. While M. de G^rlache and his companions are the first to pass a winter within the antarctic circle, the gallant explorers sent by Sir George Newnes are the first to winter on any antarctic land. The admirably conducted German Deep-sea Expedition, which has just returned to Hamburg, did some valuable work in high southern latitudes, although the Valdivia was not adapted for ice-navigation. Leaving the Gape in November, 1898, Bouvet island was re-discovered, and a southerly course was then shaped in the direction of Enderby Land. Beaching drift-ice in 56° 45' S., they were soon surrounded by numerous icebergs, the highest being a tabular mass rising 193 feet above the water. Further progress was stopped when they reached 64\"\" 15' &, in long. 54\" 20' E., where there was a depth of 3000 fathoms. It is considered that one of the most surprising results of the expedition is the great depths encountered after leaving Bouvet island. Out of seventeen soundings, no less than eleven showed depths between 2700 and 3300 fathoms. Only fifteen deep-sea soundings had previously been taken south of 50° S. The Valdivia added 29, and proved that the Southern ocean was of very great depth. But I consider that the most important information related to indications of the nature of the ant- arctic continent. These indications are found in the stones carried off the shore and dropped by icebergs. Specimens were collected of gneiss, granite, and schist ; and besides, there was a mass of red sandstone weighing 5 cwt. The soundings between Enderby Land and Eer- guelen island showed that the ocean floor was strongly folded, depths of 1300 fathoms alternating with great abysses between 2000 and 3000 fathoms. The conduct of the Valdivia expedition was admirable in all respects. Great proficiency was attained in deep-sea sounding and dredging, and the excellent manoeuvring of the ship in stormy weather was a cause of immunity from loss of sounding-wire. The thoroughness and excellence of the Valdivia*8 work is a subject of congratulation to our brother geographers in Germany. I will conclude my address with some remarks on our own efforts to secure the despatch of an antarctic expedition on an adequate scale. In my opening address, on November 13, 1893, I brought the subject prominently forward, and we then undertook the difficult task of secur- ing the despatch of such an expedition. In winding up the discussion on Sir John Murray's paper, on the 27th of the same month, I declared that I, for one, would never swerve from that task until it was com- pleted. Nearly six years of effort have passed since those words were spoken, and progress has been slowly but steadily made. I have not been disheartened, for it took me twelve years, with the aid of Admiral Sherard Osbom, whose loss can never be replaced, to secure the despatch of the Arctic Expedition of 1875. Yet, after working from 1862 to 1874, ADDRESS TO THE ROTAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETV. 11 and enduring several rebuffs, the Prime Minister at last declared that, '* having carefully weighed the reasons set forth, the scientific advan- tages, and the importance of encouraging that spirit of maritime enterprise which has ever distinguished the English people. Her Majesty's Government had determined to organize an arctic expedition.\" These words were worthy of the representative of a great people. They received the hearty concurrence of the nation, and if such words were once more spoken by a Prime Minister the feeling would be the same, for Britain is ever true to her traditions. It was considered by our Antarctic Committee, appointed in 1893, that the expedition should consist of two ships, and that it should be under naval discipline, and led by naval officers. This was, therefore, what we advocated, with every reason to expect that the plan would receive favourable consideration. For it was simply a continuation of the enlightened policy of many successive governments during nearly a century and a half. When Commodore Byron's instructions were drawn up in 1764, the government of that day declared that ''nothing can redound more to the honour of this nation, as a maritime power, to the dignity of the crown of Great Britain, and to the advancement of its trade and navigation, than to make discoveries of countries hitherto unknown.\" This noble policy was adopted by successive administra- tions, and upwards of forty government expeditions have since been sent to the polar regions. This country can proudly point to the results. The early voyages to Spitsbergen led to the great fishery in the surrounding seas. The first voyage of Sir John Ross showed the way into the north water of Baffin's bay. The third voyage of Sir Edward Parry pointed out an equally lucrative fishery up Prince Hegent's inlet. Other results might be enumerated. But suffice it to say that polar expeditions have directly led to the enrichment of this country by millions of money, to enabling numerous communities along our seaboard to live in well-to-do comfort, to the employment to a large class of industrious men, and have formed a splendid nursery for our sailors. Their scientific results are at least equally noteworthy. Without a knowledge of the geography of the polar regions, including their hydrography and meteorology, we should still be ignorant of numerous phenomena which influence other parts of the globe. For the world must be studied as a whole, because each region influences surrounding regions, and if large areas remain unknown, even those areas which are known cannot be under- stood from a scientific point of view. It is the same with every depart- ment of science ; and magnetism, geology, botany, and biology have all largely benefited from polar research. But it was not solely from the desire of increasing knowledge and advancing trade and navigation, that the policy of employing our navy on voyages of discovery in time of peace was adopted and continued. Those objects were recognized as sufficient in themselves, but successive 12 ADDRESS TO THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETT. generations of our statesmen also saw the great value of exploring expeditions to the navy itself, for offering opportunities of distinction, for acquiring experience in the etercise of faculties which are of most value to seamen, and for securing active employment out of the stagnating ordinary routine of the service. These I know were the views of the best naval friends of polar research in times past, such men as Sir Henry Hotham and Sir George Cockbum. Bemember, too, the words of one who loved the navy dearly, our associate Sherard Osbom. \" It is by the action of public opinion,\" he urged, \" directed by the men of science in this country, that I hope to see a polar expedition sent forth under naval auspices. The navy needs some action to wake it up from the canker of prolonged peace. Polar exploration is more wholesome for it, in a moral as well as a sanitary poiat of view, than any more petty wars with savages. You are not going to educate us, work us up to the point of nautical perfection, awaken hopes and ambitions, and then keep down the aspirations which intellectual progress has evoked. The navy of England cries not for mere war to gratify its desire for honourable employment or fame. There are other achievements, it knows well, as glorious as victorious battles ; and a wise ruler and a wise people will be careful to satisfy a craving which is the life-blood of a profession — indeed, I hold that it ought to be fostered and encouraged.\" Many of us will remember the words of Admiral of the Fleet, Sir Edmund CommeroU, himself a brilliant disciple of Sherard Oiborn, on the occasion of our Franklin commemoration. He said, *'My experience of over fifty years in the service has taught me that you can look nowhere for better officers, in the ordinary run of duty, and better seamen, than in these polar expe- ditions. We know very well that they have been an excellent school in every way ; above all, an excellent school in hardihood.\" He brought forward Sherard Osbom himself as an example. \"He was always forward and untiring in polar expeditions, so when it came to war, there was Osborn in the forefront. I believe, in the future, that polar work will not cease, as I am perfectly certain it is the best school we have for our navy.\" Well ! with all this evidence of its value and importance before us, it was natural that we should look forward with some confidence to a favourable consideration of our representation to the Government in favour of a naval antarctic expedition. We were, however, disappointed. It was considered that officers could not even be lent, because they might be out of reach of the telegraph if they were required. This is not the opinion of such an authority as Admiral Sir Yesey Hamilton, who was recently first Sea Lord of the Admiralty. ** The maritime supremacy of Great Britain must bo founded on a quicksand,\" he said, \" if she can- not spare a few officers to enable her to maintain her supremacy in maritime discovery.\" We might perhaps have waited until this more ADDRESS TO THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETT. 13 truly nav<U opinion prevailed. The additional objection on the ground of expense was reoeived by us last year ; and I knew, from experience, that these were not necessarily, or even probably, final replies. But there were very strong reasons for avoiding further long delays* Chief among them was the fact that a German expedition, amply supplied with funds by the Government, would certainly undertake exploration in the antarctic regions, and that the . Germans had invited us to co« operate and act in concert with them. Under such circumstances it would be a disgrace to this country if she held back ; resigning her old position in the van of discovery. It was, therefore, resolved to make an appeal for funds to the Fellows of the Society and to the public. That appeal has already met with a noble response from many well-wishers, but far above all from Mr. Longs tafi*, whose munificent and patriotic action has euabled us to secure the equipment of a small though efficient expedition. It is, however, most important that others should follow this splendid example. For upon the raising of a considerably larger sum depends, not only more adequate arrangement?, but also the duration of the exploratory operations for a sufficient time. The Boyal Society and the Boyal Geographical Society are working in perfect unison in this matter; and a joint committee, composed of equal numbers of both societies, has been nominated by the respective councils, to conduct all the business connected with the antarctic expedition. There will be sub-committees to consider and deal with the Ecveral departments of work. We still hope that there will be assistance from Her Majesty's Government, both as regards leave for officers to serve and as regards a grant of money. For we look to the ▼aricus precedents afforded by several private expeditions which have occasionally stepped in to perform work which has usually been under- taken by the Government. Among them may be mentioned Back's land journey, the expedition of the Bosses, when the magnetic pole was discovered, M*Clintock's expedition to discover the fate of Franklin, and Sir Allen Young's expeditions. Treasury grants were made to three of these private expeditions ; in fact, whenever asked for, assist- ance in various ways to others, and naval officers were allowed to serve in all. So that the refusal of a supplementary grant or of the services of naval officers would be unprecedented. There is, I am glad to think, every reason to hope that it will remain so. Hitherto antarctic exploration has been naval work, and there are peculiar difficulties when it is forced upon scientific bodies. It is out- side their ordinary duties, and they have necessarily entered upon it with a serious sense of the responsibility it will entail. Yet there was really no alternative, and the Boyal Society and Boyal Geographical Society, with the warm sympathy of all the other scientific todies of the empire, have combined to organize and despatch an expedition. It is in no sense a private expedition ; its objects are p.ecisely the same as 14 EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. those of the polar expeditions so often despatched or subsidized by the Government, while its national and representative character are em- phasized by the Prince of Wales having become its patron and the Duke of York its vice-patron. I cannot conclude my address without warmly thanking the subscribers among the Fellows, and representing to those who have not yet subscribed how much the credit not only of the Society, but of the country, is involved in the provision of adequate fands for this great national enterprise. EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES.* By Sir MARTIN CONWAY. Before proceeding to describe in briefest outline the results of my expedition to the Andes in 1898, let me express in the most emphatic manner my thanks to the Governments of Bolivia, Peru, and Chile, for the facilities they placed in my way. Armed with the kind recom- mendation of Senor Aramayo, the able Bolivian miDister to this country, I was received by his fellow-countrymen with open arms, and all ways were made for me as smooth as it was possible to make them. Oar honorary Fellow, Senor M. Y. Ballivian, was my good genius in La Paz, where, moreover, in the much-to-be-regretted absence of any British diplomatic representative, I was kindly protected by the French ChargS d'affatresj M. de Coutouly, and the United States minister, Dr. Bridgman. The Peruvian Government admitted my baggage free of duty ; whilst the Chilian Government placed at my disposal in the Straits of Magellan a steamer, which enabled me to make the ex- plorations I desired. To our own diplomatic representatives, Mr. Gosling at Valparaiso and Mr. St. John at Lima, I owe very hearty thanks for their great kindness ; whilst at Punta Arenas Mr. Meredith, our vice- consul, extended to me a warm hospitality, and gave me valuable help. Accompanied by two Alpine guides, Antoine Maquignaz and Louis Pellissier, I left Southampton early in July, and voyaged by the Eoyal Mail steamer to Colon ; crossed the isthmus of Panama, spending a week in that neighbourhood; then sailed down the west coast of South America to Callao, where I took the opportunity of a four days' halt to mount by the Oroya railway to the crest of the Andes, and obtain a glimpse of the snowy range in the neighbourhood of the pass. From Callao I proceeded to MoUendo, and so by way of the Arequipa railroad to Lake Titicaca, that remarkable sheet of water fourteen times the size of the lake of Geneva and 12,600 feet above the sea, which is to be regarded merely as a remnant of a far greater inland sea now shrunk away. A steamboat took us down the lake, a voyage of 111 miles, on * Bead at the Boyal Geographical Society, May 8, 1899. Map, p. 128. EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVUN ANDES. 15 a brilliantly dear and beautiful day. We passed the historio islands from which the Inoa civilization is reported to have spread, and we saw the noble Mount Sorata rising in white splendour apparently from the waves. At Chililaya we transferred ourselves to a four-horse vehicle, locally known as a tilbury, and drove to La Paz by a good road which traverses the high level plateau called the Puna. During this drive of some 30 miles we were passing below the feet of the wonderfully straight range of snowy mountains called the Cordillera Beal, whereof Mount Sorata forms the northern extremity, and Illimani, 64 miles away, the southern. It was this range that I had specially come to visit. I do not propose to give a merely chronological account of our doings during the four months we spent in this part of Bolivia. A concise statement of the general results of our work will probably be more interesting to this Society. I may remark that I triangulated the principal peaks of the range from Sorata to Illimani, and made a plane- table sketch survey of their western slope, and of the Puna and the valley of La Paz. But this map cannot be published at the same time as my paper, seeing that I hope to be able to correct and add to it by a second visit to the country. The Cordillera Eeal is the backbone of Bolivia. To the east the mountains fall very rapidly to a low hill country and the fertile valleys which send their waters to the river Beni. I unfortunately saw little of this side of the range, and it is thither I hope to return. On the other side there lies the high plateau of which I have spoken, at a uniform altitude of 12,000 to 13,000 feet, from which the tops of low rocky hills here and there emerge. That this plateau was at one time submerged is obvious enough. The slopes that lead down to it from the main Cordillera are covered with immense accumulations of glacier-borne and water-rolled debris, the ruins of the range against which they lie. Evidence is plentiful that in ancient times the glaciers enveloped a large part of these slopes, and reached down many miles further than they now do, depositing the rocks that they carried into the waters of the ancient sea. What the limits of this glacier extension may have been, it is difficult now to estimate, for there are proofs that the glacier-deposited dSbris have been much torn about and rearranged by water. But a very minute examination would have to be made before the exact extent of this process could be estimated. In the immense pile of debris deep valleys were afterwards cut by the action of water, and into these valleys the glaciers in a second period of advance protruded their snouts, depositing moraines which can still be traced in gitu as much as 4 or even 5 miles below the present limit of ice. One such glacier-cast was carefully examined by me near the foot of Mount Sorata. The terminal moraine now forms the dam of a large lake, 500 feet above the level of whose waters the two lateral moraines can be traced with perfect distinctness. At the north-west foot of the 16 EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. same mountain, where the mnle-traok goes over from the Pana to Sorata town, the whole area is glacier-worn and encumbered with moraines ; whilst in the deep Maperi valley, whose head lies against the north face of Mount Sorata — a valley now absolutely devoid of ioe, and occupied up to the very foot of the mountain with almost tropioal vege- tation— the marks of glacier-action are of the most striking character. These are merely examples amongst the many that might be quoted from different parts of the range. The climate of the plateau region is of importance in connection with its present physical formation. A great part of the year is com- pletely rainless, but from the beginning of December till the end of March or April rain is precipitated very frequently and with great violence. During the remainder of the year the slopes and plains are swept by dry winds, and sometimes scorched by a very hot sun, so that, except at very high levels of perpetual snow, where bad weather lasts over a longer period, the surface of the whole country is dried and baked. In the rainy season mud avalanches fall down the slopes^ gullies are deepened, every stream is in flood, waterways are ploughed in various directions in the plain, and all the rivers eat their way back* The great dryness of the land, when the rain begins, facilitates the rapid action of denudation, so that surface-modelling by water is perhaps as vigorously carried on here as it is in any part of the world. That this is no modem development is proved by an examination of the range as a whole, for it is cut through, or is being cut through, at its two ends by profound excavations, and, curiously enough, that happens here which is also a characteristic of the Kara Koram Himalayas — the gaps are deepest close to the highest summits. Thus, just south of Illimani, a tributary of the Beni river has eaten its way back and back, and finally has cut clean through the Cordillera, so that now the streams that rise on the west slopes of all the southern half of the Cordillera Real, uniting in the La Paz river, actually flow across the Cordillera, through the deep gorge thus eaten back, and empty their waters into the Beni, the Amazon, and the Atlantic. A similar process is going on north of Mount Sorata, where the Maperi river has already got halfway through the range, and is now busily engaged in eating backwards at its head, so that in no long geological period it will cut back to Lake Titicaca, and will ultimately empty that out, likewise, into the Amazon and the Atlantic. All that remains now for it to pierce is the relatively low ridge over which the road to Sorata Town passes, and its crest is less than 2000 feet above the level of the lake, while the distance from Achacache, which is on the margin of the lake, to the pass is perhaps some half-dozen miles. More striking examples of the eating- back action of rivers it would be difficult to find. In a former paper read by me before this Society, I pointed out how there are indications in Spitsbergen of glaciers eating back at their EXPLORATIONS IS THE BOLIVIAN AMOES. 17 heada, jaat as rivers do ; and I auggeBted that tbe ageuc; of glaciers woa probably that which causes the penetration of ranges of moantaios to happen ao frequently in the immediate neigbbonrbood of their highest peaks. Whether the mountain ridge aonth of IIHmani and the other north of Sorata were broken down by the backward eating of glaciers, or whether it ia water-aotioa that destroyed them, is of couree not easy to assert ; but upon Illiraani I observed a glacier at the preaent moment eating its way back through a secondary ridge in a manner that could not posaibly be misinterpreted. The ridge that was giving way formed the right-band aupport of a considerable glacier. Tbe side of this ridge remote from this upper glacier forms a cliff, at the foot of which there is a lower glacier, and the lower glacier, by continually carrying away tbe debris split by frost and sunshine from this face, oaoses the face to retreat into the mountain. Tbe process continually going on has breached ihe ridge itself at one point down to the level of the glacier supported by it, and now the ice which formerly would have fiowed down the upper glacier, is just beginning to break away and tumble over the cliff to the lower one. Allow this process to go forward for a short time, and the whole configuration of the mountain will be changed. It seema to have been the general impreasion that, though the No. I.— July, 1899.] <■ 18 EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. vrestem flank of the Cordillera Keal consisted of Silurian rock, the peaks of the range were of volcanic formation, and I have often seen Sorata and Illimani referred to as extinct volcanoes. As the result of a careful examination, not only of those peaks, but of the dibris brought down by the glaciers all along the range, I have been unable to find any trace of volcanic action along the axis of the range. The Cordillera Real has been elevated by a great earth-movement, and the heart of the range consists of granites, schists, and rocks of that description, which Prof. Bonney has kindly undertaken to examine and describe. A transverse section across the range would reveal a central block of such rocks cloven by almost vertical pressure-planes flanked, to the west by Palaeozoic, probably Silurian, slates and grits, with which some compact igneous rocks, not belonging to the later volcanic group, seem to be associated. These dip steeply towards the Puna. Further out come beds of red sandstone and conglomerate dipping less steeply. Such, in broad outline, is the comparatively simple general structure of the mountains. The whole range may be described as rich in mineral products, but of the distribution of these I cannot at present say much. Gold is found at several points, but the chief gold-bearing valleys are those on the east side of the range, and more especially the Tipuani and Coroico valleys. Gold is found in the La Paz river after every rainy season, whilst very rich gold- washings are being worked in a valley whose waters come from the flanks of Mururata. Just below the snowy mass of Cacaaca on the west, there is a really enormous vein of tin, which is being worked by a French company ; whilst antimony, cobalt, and, I believe, platinum, have been found in different parts. The great copper depositei are not in this range, but further to the west, especially about the town of Corocoro. The Cordillera Beal between Sorata and Illimani divides itself into two fairly well-marked parts. The point of division is Mount Cacaaca, which stands almost exactly midway between the two terminal peaks, and is third in altitude of the whole group. Between Sorata and Cacaaca there runs an almost continuous series of snowy peaks, some of them sharp in outline ; but the range for the most part has been much worn down by denuding action, and the individual mountains have thus been brought to a form very similar to that of the snowy Alps. Almost every one of the mountains reminded me and my Alpiue guides of some peak or another familiar to us in Switzerland, so that in con- versation we used to talk of one peak as the Eothhorn, of another as the Dent Blanche, etc. The passes in this part of the range seldom sink below the snow-level, though there is certainly one, and there may be two passes, a little north of Cacaaca, which are free of snow in the summer. South of Cacaaca the range is much less continuously lofty. There are three or four big groups of snow-peaks, but between them £XPL0RAT10!IS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. 19 too broad Btretcfaes where the range does not rise to the level of per- petual snow, and over these lie pawee, acme of which may be traversed bj mnlej, whereby La Paz is oonnected with the fertile region of Ynngas. Indeed, I understand that there is a proposal to make a railway over one of theee passes, and that the physical difficulties to be gar mounted, though of coarse considerable, are by no means prohibitive. I approached several of the passes over the range, bat did cot aotoally oroas any of them, and therefore cannot describe them. Suffice it to say that it would be quite easy to make good routes for mule traffic aorosa the range at several points, and that such roates, oommunioating with the rich country to the east, would materially develop the wealth of the country. South of the great gap, by whioh the La Faz liver traversea the ancient watershed, the main range is continued, though at a much lower altitude. There is one attractive group of snow-peaks called \" The Five Crosses,\" but they rise very gradually from the high region aboat them, and it is only their actual summits that are at all steep. They have been ascended more than once, for the most part by persons prospecting for minerals, and certain mineral deposits of a promising nature have been foaod in their slopes, though not, I believe, towards their summits. We made no attempt to penetrate into this portion of 20 EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. the range, though I had good views of it from the flanks of IllimaDi and from the plain to the eastward. The flora of the high regions of the Cordillera Eeal appeared to us very sparse, though it is only fair to say that the rainy season must be the time when the flowers are most numerous, and as we quitted the country before the actual commencement of the rains, we probably only encountered the earlier flowers ; of their general character I do not propose to speak, for they have been investigated at Kew Grardens, and the results will find their proper place for publication elsewhere. Suffice it now to say that the flowers we found were much scattered about, one here, another there, but that we never came across any carpet of blossoms such as form the great attraction of many high mountain regions. Bird-life was more prolific. Leaving the Puna and the lake out of account, where birds have formed the subject of independent investigation by experienced observers, it may be said that up to an altitude of 17,000 feet, in suitable places, birds were numerous, and in a little tarn close to our base camp on Mount Sorata, at 16,000 feet above the sea, we shot geese, gulls, wild duck, and snipe, besides several small birds ; and we saw a number of rather large green-headed humming-birds, of which, unfortunately, I was unable to secure specimens through lack of suitably loaded cartridges. The slopes of broken rocks beside this place were haunted by multitudes of bizcachap, which seemed to thrive exceedingly. Chinchillas we did not see, but from scraps of fur I picked up, it seemed possible that they also might have been found in the same neighbourhood. Except at La Paz and Sorata Town, the inhabitants of the Puna and the banks of Lake Titicaca were almost entirely Aymara Indians. By them the Puna is densely populated. They cultivate almost every yard of it by their primitive methods during the rainy season, and they obtain tolerable crops of ^evada and potatoes. Potatoes, in fact, are one of the chief articles of food that the country produces. There are many varieties cultivated, and they are afterwards prepared for food in a multitude of ways, so that potatoes for food are met with in over a hundred different kinds. Some are put out at night to freeze, and taken in before the morning sun brings on a thaw ; some, on the other hand, are dried in the sun and taken in at night to he sheltered from the frost ; some are wetted and frozen, and some are dried and frozen^ and there are multitudes of other modes for preparing potatoes for the market. The Indians are practically attached to the soil for the most part, and hold their lands by a kind of feudal tenure. Instead of paying a rent, they give their labour to the landlord, cultivating his fields as well as their own, but only according to their traditional systems of agriculture, by which a field is cultivated once in four years and lies fallow fur the remainder of the time, whilst at the highest levels of cultivation the turn of a field comes even less frequently. EXPLOHATIOXS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. 21 So long KB no attempt is made to iaterftire with their traditional modes of life, and tbey are not oppressed by the landlorde or their admiDistrators, the Indians are quiet enough ; but they are never well disposed to white meu, and the difficulty of keeping them in order ia not slight. Bolivia does not poaaees a large military foroe or an organized body uf country police, fur the area to be policed ie large, and the white population ia very small. Thus the Indians are kept in order more by management than by foroe, and the great agency of control is not the police, but the priests. The Indians are an exceedingly bigoted folk, retaining under a maak of Christianity their anoient superstitions, little altered. I was seriously interfered with in the proeecution of my researches by Indians, because the nature of my undertaking involved some outrage to their superstitions. Like all cemi-civilized mountain folk, they regard the mountains above the level of habitation as a part of the other world, the world of divine and diabolio beings, and the haunt, I believe, of the departed. It was firmly held by the Indians of the Puna, and especially of that part of it which lay round the base of Mount Sorata, that on the summit of one of its peaks there stands a great golden bull and a golden cross, planted by sapematural agency. They considered that the object of my expedition could be nothing else than to obtain possession of the.^e priceless treasures. For this reason partly, and partly through the hostility of the Indians of a neighbouring 22 EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. village to those of the village vr hence the porters who accompanied me to the base of the mountains were recruited, my camp at the foot of Mount Sorata was raided one night, and if we had happened to be in at the time, things might have gonelhardly with us. As it was, we were then encamped in our small tents among the snow, and the snowy areas are not visited by the natives. Again, during the progress of my triangulation, it was essential for me to spend some time on the top of a hill that rises out of the Puna in the neighbourhood of a village of particularly bigoted Indians. On this hilltop there stands a chulpa^ a little building probably enough of pre-Spanish date, which now would be called a chapel, but is really the funeral monument of some departed chieftain. All the lower and more accessible hilltops inUhis part of Bolivia are surmounted by such chulpas, and the natives greatly dislike their profanation by the visit a of strangers. At all events, I had no sooner set up my theodolite near the cAuZpa, than the Indians began collecting from all quarters, till I was surrounded by more than two hundred enraged natives. I was alone at the time with one half-breed muleteer, and it was only by the skin of my teeth that I ultimately escaped, abandoning in the hands of the Indians the theodolite, which I fortunately had just time to pack up in its box, and riding away pursued by a stone-throwing and howling mob. I found that they could run almost as fast as my indifferent mule could gallop, and the four miles' chase that ensued before I got within the walls of the town of Achacache was not the least exciting adventure I had in Bolivia. It was necessary to return again to this point to conclude my observations, and, though I went back accompanied by persons having influence vnth the Indians, I was only just able to complete my work and get down from the hill before the stone-throwing began once more. Attempting to continue the survey on the following day, I found the whole country risen against me ; it became necessary to obtain the assistance of a companj^ of soldiers before I could complete my task. These Bolivian soldiers, with whom I spent several days^ were an admirable set of fellows, very strong, good tempered, and the best marchers I ever saw. They kept up a kind of trot for hours together across the roughest kind of ground, each man heavily laden, and under burning sunshine. But there seemed no limit to their powers of endurance, and there is little doubt that with good leading they would make formidable troops. Of the antiquities of Lake Titicaoa and the neighbouring plateau I need not here speak, for the important ruins — those on the island of Titi- caoa and the neighbouring island of Coati, and the famous megalithic monximents at Tiahuanaco — are well known, whilst the chulpas and the ruined villages and ancient burying-places of the prehistoric natives are now being most carefully excavated and investigated for the Washing- ton Museum by Mr. Bandolier and his wife. It is impossible to overpraise EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. 23 the work of Mr. Bandelier, whom I may beat deecribe as the Fliudera Petrie of anoient Peru. Not only does be dig into the gronnd, but he makes Teaearches equally important into the minda of the liviDg folk ; he is thas slowly aocumalating a mass of material of the highest interest alike to anthropologists and historians. When I met him, he was engaged in excavatitig the bnrial-plaoe and the ruined houses of a village planted high up on the slopes of Illimani. Indeed, there are iodioationB of prehistoric habitation and agriculture on Illimani at a very mnoh higher level than the villages of the present day. One auob ruined village was planted at the very edge of a amall glacier, and was only reaobed by a footpath, difficult and even dangerona to traverae. In the burial-plaoee of thia ancient peasantry were, of course, found no treasarea of silver and gold, but only simple pottery and a bronze pin or two, besides some stones of peculiar shape, which the existing Indiana, who helped in the excavation, instantly recognized as fetiches. The second time I met Mr. Bandelier, he bad been digging a mined Tilh^e of more projperous oharacter near the town of Sioasica. The mnd hnts were atill standing, in many casoa retaining their mud roofs, and each with its little doorway towards the east. Beneath the floor of those hnta were hnried generations of their bygone inhabitants, juat 21 EXPLORATIONS IK THE BOUFIAN ANDES. as Frof. l'«trie found in tha Egyptian village of Eahun and ilBewhere. The skulls of all the adult natives presented the chaiaoterintio of a very retreating forehead, artificially prodnoed in ohildhood, but one interment fortunately yielded the skull of an infant in perfect preservation, whose form, unaltered by artificial means, was proof that the peculiarity of the others was not nataral, but artificial. If the Cordillera Real shows slight traces of voloanic activity, the outer or coast Cordillera shows plenty. Standing high upon the slopes of Illimani or of Sorata, we could always see, away to the westward, niountains of unmistakable volcanic type. Indeed, in coming from Molleudo to Lake Titioaoa, we passed round the base of the large and famous Misti, which rises to a height of 19,000 feet. On its summit the obaervatory of Harvard College established at Arequipa haa a station, fitted with self-recording meteorological inKtruments, and every fortnight a man goes up to bring down their records. Further to the south, and along a line parallel with the Cordillera Real, other EXPLORATIONS IK THE UOUVIAN ANDES. 25 rolcanoej may be observed at frequent intervals. It was my intention to visit Sajama, and if possible climb it on my way down towards the eea; but the difficulty of getting together a cuavan proved too great, and I was reluctantly obliged to relinqaish the plan, Sajama is nearly the highest of a group of extinct oraters which would well repay careful osamination. Further south along the lioe of the railway that deaoenda from Oruro to Antofagaata, volcanoes are frequently met with. Id fact, the whole country is rioh in the signs of volcanic activity. Two emotuDg volcanoes are passed by the train. At one point the line ia taken by a cutting actually through a stream of lava, which looks as though it had been quite recently erupted, so sharp are its outlines, as it lies upon the desert slope. It resembled to my eyes nothing so much as the tongue of a great stone-covered glaoier. The whole of this region from Oniro to the sea, with the exception of a few areas artificially irrigated, is an appalling desert, not valueless bjr any meaaB, for in great hollows of the ground there are white borax deposits that look like lakes frozen over and covered with snow. Tlie mineral wealth of the mountains is undoubtedly considerable. This region has, I believe, heen fairly well prospected for minerals, but geographically it stands in need of, and would well repay, a careful examination. In point of «cenery it resembles nothing so much as a landscape on the moon. 26 EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. whilst for weird beauty and strangeness it can find, even in the midst of the Sahara, no superior and few rivals upon the face of the Earth. After leaving Bolivia, I spent a few days in making the ascent of Aconcagua.* It was not, of course, a first ascent of that fine mountain, for, as everybody knows, it was ascended by Mr. Vines and my old Himalaya guide Zurbriggen, members of Mr. E. A. Fitz Gerald's expedi- tions in 1897. Mr. Fitz Gerald was an old friend of mine. I had followed his proceedings with the deepest interest, read all he had written on the subject, and conversed with him about the mountain before leaving home. He had urged me to make the ascent, and had given me all the information possible to facilitate it. My ascent of Aconcagua was not a scientific, but a merely sporting expedition. The mountain had been measured by Fitz Gerald with greater accuracy and care than almost any other high mountain in the world has ever been measured. He had also fixed its position astronomically with great exactitude, and had mapped the peak and its neighbourhood most beautifully. When his book comes out, the public will learn, as they do not yet know, how excellent was the work done by Mr. Fitz Gerald's party. When I returned from my ascent, after only ten days* absence from Valparaiso, the opinion of * Left Valparaiso December 1 ; crossed the Andes to Baths of Inca, Deoember 2. December 3, rode up Horcones valley and camped at the head of it, about half a mile below Fitz Gerald's 14,000-feet c^mp. December 4, sent baggage up to site of Fits Gerald's 16,000-feet camp. December 5, ascended to 16,000-feet camp. December 6, ascended to about 18,500 feet, and camped near the south edge of the great north- western slope of screes. Wo thought this was Fitz Gerald's top camping-place^ because we found an old duster there, but it must have been brought by wind. December 7, started at 3.30 a.m. up the screes, following thence forward a line of ascent different from Fitz Gerald's. At 7 a.m. Pellissier turned back ill. Between 9 and 10 a.m. reached foot of second or third gully (counting from north-east to south-west) in the highest rock-wall. Climbed this gully to the summit ridge, which was struck between the highest peak and the lowest point in the summit ridge. Turned to the left (north- east) along the narrow snow arete towards the highest point, and climbed over several undulations to the top of a peak near, and not many feet lower than, the highest peak. It was then about noon. There was absolutely no difficulty between this point and the highest peak, though the ridge thus far had not been easy. All difficulties being thus overcome, and the ascent not being a first ascent, I decided to descend, for two reasons : (a) because it was advisable to get back to Pellissier as quickly as possible : (b) because Vines, when he ascended Aconcagua, made a record for altitude, and I thought it likely that, if I reached his peak, I should be accused of mere jealousy, whereas if, after overcoming all the difficulties of the mountain and being within ten minutes of, and at the very outside 50 feet below the highest point, I turned back, I could not be so accused. At noon exactly we turned back and went down the way we had come. Reached top camp in two and a half hours. Found Pellissier badly frost-bitten, and realized that it was essential to get him down to mule-level at once. Descended with all baggage in forty minutes to middle camp ; packed that up, and descended in forty minutes to foot of slope, fifteen minutes to Fitz Gerald's 14,000-feet camp, fifteen minutes to our base camp, which was reached at 6 p.m. December 8, descended with all baggage to Inca. December 9. sent off baggage for Valparaiso. December 10» started at 5 a.m., crossed the Cordillera, and reached Valparaiso at 11 p.m. EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOUVIAK ANDES. 27 nninformed persons was that I had in some fashion surpassed the ex- ploits of my predeceesora, who spent seven months or more on or abont the mountain. To begin with, had they not preceded me, I should pro- bably have wasted the best part of a month in searching for the way, which is by no means obvioua Again, the time actually spent by them on the ascent was little longer than that taken by me. Each of their camps was a well-fitted observatory ; at each they made long series of observations. The mere determination of the position of the Inca Hotel, from which they started, as I did, took them a month or more. They made a complete examination of the geology and natural history of the neighbourhood. Thus my olimb cannot be compared with their expe- dition in any way, and I am the last to desire any comparison between the two to be made. If, hereafter, the summit of Mount Sorata is attained by some more lucky climber than I was, he will owe to me the same recognition that I gladly render to Fitz Gerald. After returning from the ascent of Aooncagua, I took ship at the BOnUtem extremity of the Chilian railroads to Lota, the famous copper and coal mine centre. Passing southward along the west coast in the steamer, we entered Smyth's sound at the Gulf of PeSas. A few days 28 EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVUN ANDES. were spent in the sound, where I was, fortunately, enabled to land at several points and make short expeditions into the neighbouring moun- tains, and then by the Straits of Magellan I oame to Sandy Point, where I halted for a few weeks. During that time, by the kindness of the Chilian Government, a steamboat was placed at my disposal, and I was enabled to attempt the ascent of Mount Sarmiento, the highest and finest mountain in the Fuegian district. I also made an expedition over the Patagonian Pampa to some of the secluded inland waters that long ago attracted me when I first studied them on the Admiralty chart. To this part of my expedition I can only now briefly refer. The character of the scenery of Smyth's sound closely resembles that of the inland passage along the coast of Norway. In both cases, the mountains are formed of hard rocks, granites, schists, and the like ; in both these rocks have been polished for long periods by an ice-sheet, which has rounded the valleys and the summits and apparently enveloped the whole range ; in both cases the mountains have passed through periods of elevation above the sea, and then of depression into it ; in both cases they have been depressed in the more recent period, so that the valley-bottomB are sometimes as much as 1000 feet below the level of the sea ; and in both cases this period of depression seems now to be passing away, and the land is being raised once more above the waters. Smyth's sound enjoys a higher reputation for beauty of scenery, but this reputation is» I think, greater than it deserves. Certainly, in point of beauty, the Norwegian inland passage is its superior. Smyth's sound lacks variety of scenery. At one or two points, indeed, there are specially fine views — as, for instance, below the fine promontory named Bold head, or where Trinidad channel opens to the west, disclosing a multitude of beautiful islands, or beneath the snow-clad Cordillera Sarmiento (not to be con- fused with Mount Sarmiento of Tierra del Fuego), or where the majestic mass of Mount Bumey rises by the channeL But in a general way there is a dead level of scenery, fine indeed, but not of surpassing grandeur. The characteristic of the views is the dense forest which covers the lower slopes of all the hills and islands — a primsBval forest of stunted trees, rising out of the ruins of their predecessors, which are rotting and tangled together on the ground, thickly overgrown by moss, offering to the traveller every possible impediment. Higher up, in situations naturally well drained, the forest is more open, and there are occasional bogs occupying the sites of former ponds or lakes, and barren areas of polished rock too steep for earth to collect upon ; whilst the tops of the hills are sometimes faced by precipices, and are themselves often relatively bare of vegetation when they do not reach to the level of perpetual snow. Looking inland up the numerous channels which open out from the sound in succession, one often beholds snowy areas, great gathering-grounds of snow, drained by glacier tongues which sometimes terminate in the water. If it were not for the bad weather that infests EXPLORATIOXS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. 2» thiB flack of the submerged monntaiD area, these regions would offer a fucioating Bubject for a mouutain explorer. As it is, I fear tbey are not likely to attract minute iuTestigation until the more agreeable mountains of the world have been better explored than they are now. The weBtem arm of the Strait of Magellan offers far more splendid Bcenerj- to the contemplation of the voyager than does any except the Bonthernmost part of Smyth's sound, but this has been so frequently dracribed that I need not pause upon it now. I was surprised to find how splendid are the mountains of Tierra del Fnego, which culminate in Mount Sarmiento. It is not that tbey are actually high, reckoned from aea-lerel, for Sarmiento is only a little over 7000 feet, but they are so unusually fine in form, and are draped by such magnificent glaciers. The actual height of a mountain, as measured from the sea, is not a true test of its size. Mount Sorata, for example, really begins at 13,000 feet ; all that is below, it possesses in oommon with the great tableland on which it stands, and it is not till about 16,000 feet that the actual peak begins. Illimani, on the other hand, stretches its slopes down to the very depths of the valley 30 EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES. of La Pdz on the one side, and to the lowlands of Yungas on the other, so that it is seen from base to summit — ^a mighty mass, whose top is at least 17,000 feet above its foot. Mount Blanc is practioally a mountain no more than 10,000 feet high, though its summit is nearly 16,000 feet above sea-level ; while if the Alps were sunk into the sea till all that part of them were submerged which may be traversed without real climbing, there is hardly a peak that would rise 5000 feet above the surface of the waters. Mount Hedgehog, in Spitsbergen, is only about 5000 feet in height, but every one of those 5000 feet has to be climbed, and, as a problem for the climber. Mount Hedgehog is more difficult than most Alpine peaks. The 7000 feet of Mount Sarmiento are all difficult of ascent, and the climb may be said to begin near the very level of the sea, so that the snowy mass of Sarmiento is larger than that of Mount Blanc, and almost as large as that of Mount Sorata. Here again we were under the impression that we should find traces of volcanic action, but we found none. Mount Sarmiento, and the range of which it forms a part, has been upheaved by a great earth-movement, and carved out from a vaster mass by the action of denuding forces. Much further to the eastward I believe volcanoes do exist on Tierra del Fuego, but the ranges which border the Cockbum^channel or Admiralty sound are devoid of traces of volcanic action. The climate of the Mount Sarmiento region is by no means so bad as that of Smyth's sound. Though we were unfortunately driven down before actually reaching the summit of the peak, by a storm of great violence, which it was impossible to maintain ourselves against, I think that here is an area in which mountain exploration might be carried on with some prospect of reasonable enjoyment, and with the certainty of obtaining valuable results. The arrangement of the ridges, except those that border Beagle channel, is not yet by any means clear. A great part of the island of Tierra del Fuego which is marked blank on the map, is occupied by mountains, whilst the glacier development is considerable. An examination of these glaciers led me to conclude that, in character, they must be placed between the truly arctic glaciers, such as we saw in Spitsbergen, and those of temperate regions. They have much of the apparently greater viscosity of arctic glaciers, pouring down their slopes and bulging at their snouts very differeutly from the glaciers of the Alps. The most remarkable glacial feature that we saw was a rocky basin of great extent, just at the foot of the north slope of Mount Sarmiento, filled by the great supply of nSvS that comes down that slope, and overflowing in three different directions, to east and west and north, where three separate tongues of ice find their way almost into the sea. One of them, by which we mounted, is only separated from the sea by a narrow belt of forest-clad moraine, and it is evident that, not so long ago, the snout of the glacier must actually have recu^hed the water. But, as I explained in connection with the glaciers of EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES— DISCUSSION. 31 Spitsbergen, a glacier ending in shallow sea must sooner or later build in front of its snout a wall of moraine, which must ultimately out it o£f from the water. Such moraine walls, diyiding glacial snouts from the sea, were found by us in several places in the neighbourhood of the Sarmiento range. Our examination of this district was of course very cursory, but to me it is intensely interesting, and I hope that, before many years, some better-equipped mountaineer will find himself in those parts, and will devote a whole season to the exploration of the glaciers. Sandy Point is now developing into a town of considerable importance, where all necessary commodities can be obtained, and where, at the right season, a traveller would be able to hire boats and engage companions. Before the reading of the paper, the President said : This eveoing we have the pleasure of welcoming here again Sir Martin Conway, who has given us so much interesting information in regard to such distant parts of the world as the Himalayas and Spitsbergen. Now we are to hear from him some of the results of his very interesting journey to South America. After the reading of the paper, the following discussion took place : — Seflor Aramato, the Bolivian Minister: A few nights ago, under this same roof, I had the pleasure of congratulating Sir Martin Conway on the wonderful success of his ascents of the highest peaks of the Andes, and of thanking him, as I do now again, for the most complimentary manner in which he has referred to my country and to myself. I am sure that his lectures will have a great part in bringing Bolivia into closer connection with the scientific and commercial world, and he may be assured of the esteem and gratitude of my fellow-citizens. I thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the opportunity of acknowledging our indebted- ness to Sir Martin Conway, and I take this opportunity of congratulating the Society on this addition to their succession of triumphs in the cause of science. Prof. BoNNEY ; I am sorry to say that since I received Sir Martin Conway's rocks I have only been able to afford the time to give them a cursory examination, but I have seen enough to perceive that he has settled one question which, up to the present time, was a matter of doubt. Various statements have been made as to what was really the nature of the Cordillera. David Forbes, in his excellent paper to the Geological Society, stated that the summit of lllimani consisted of Silurian rock. d*Orbigny said it was granitic. Now, ascending from the eastern slopes you pass a series of slates and schists, probably of Devonian and Silurian age. Above that, from the highest parts of the mountains. Sir Martin Conway has brought a series very difficult to decide upon without microscopic examination. Some are of igneous origin, but quite different from those generally found in the Andes. The Pico de Paris is a fine banded gneiss, and the Pico del Indico is of coarse granite. In the same way, Sorata consists of a series of crystalline rocks, such as you might get from the central part of the Alps. It is remarkable that the volcanic rock of the Andes is almost wholly confined to the western series of mountaius. Only from one place on the lower slope of lllimani has Sir Martin brought one of the typical Andes rocks, such as have come from Aconcagua, and as Mr. Whymper has brought from the Ecuadorian Andes. The physical structure is remarkable. The crystalline rocks form the most eastern of the ranges, and it is worth noticing that the only rocks of that type were brought by Mr. Whymper from the most eastern peak of the Andes he visited in the Ecuadorian region. The origin of those gaps in 32 EXPLORATIONS IN THE BOLIVIAN ANDES— DISCUSSION. the chain is very interesting. I doubt if the case is parallel to that afiforded by the Himalayas and Earakoram and by the two principal ranges in the Alps, because in both these cases we have rivers rising well behind a range, which they cut through, while here we have rivers cutting back into the plateau; that is to say, the plateau in these Ecuadorian regions is clearly a much more ancient feature than the river ; while in the other two cases the rivers have always flowed in the same way, and cut down the land as it rose. It would be interesting to make out what the real history of these gaps is. There is one more remarkable point in this region — that there is such a mass of snow and glacier. It is singular that in Aconcagua, some 1400 feet higher and 16^ further from the equator, there is much lees snow — Sir Martin Conway and Mr. Fitz Grerald's party, in ascending, found little snow on Aconcagua — yet here in the Cordillera are masses of snow and glacier that would do credit to the Alps. I conclude the precipitation in this district must be greater than that of the Andes further to the south. I think we may congratulate Sir Martin Conway on the extremely interesting results that have attended his exertions, and I hope we may be able to make some considerable additions to the geology of this region. Dr. H. Woodward : I am asked by my colleagues in the British Museum to say a word about Sir Martin Conway's collections. He did not merely climb the Andes, but he has collected natural history specimens all along his route. Besides the rocks which Prof. Bonney received, there were some interesting minerals, which Mr. Fletcher has casually examined. Among these are two rare species of angelite ; the former contains the rare chemical element germanium, and the latter a hydrated phosphate of aluminium. Dr. Bowdler Sharpe has received an important collection of birds, and although no species is new, some important new localities are repre- sented, and at higher altitudes than specimens hitherto obtained. Among the insects, of which a large collection is waiting to be examined, at least there is a new Meloe, one of the curious oil-beetles, closely allied to a species obtained by Mr. Whymper at an elevation of 10,000 feet in Ecuador. From the casual ex- amination of the specimens already made, we know that important additions will have been made to the Natural History Collections by Sir Martin Conway, and I congratulate him on the successful results of his journey. The following communication on the botany of Sir Martin Con^vay's expedition was read on behalf of Mr. W. Botting Hemsley, keeper of the Kew Herbarium : — The botanical collection made by Sir Martin Conway is almost entirely restricted to the plants found at the extreme upper limits of vegetation, and numbers only about sixty-five species. But it is an exceedingly interesting collection, and will be the subject of a paper to be read before the Linneean Society on June 1. There are apparently no authentic published records of plants growing in the Andes at a greater elevation than about 17,000 feet. Humbold"
