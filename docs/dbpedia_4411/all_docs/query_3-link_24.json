        "text": "Anonymous asked:\n\nPercy for the Character thing?\n\nWait! Oh yes, wait a minute Mister ...Milk! Man~\n\nFirst impression\n\nHonestly I think the first time I actually saw Percy was in the outro of some CGI Thomas that was on telly at the time ...several years ago. I have absolutely no memory of the episodes themselves, but somehow it seems I got the ED more than once? So I couldn't possibly say what eps they were or even if they were HiT or Mattel seasons, but it was the Engine Roll Call thing. \"Percy pulls the mail on time,\" it would say. And that's how I knew his name, colour and his job, lol\n\nImpression now\n\nPercy, a precious, peril-prone pea!\n\nWe are all love Percy. He's cute and cheeky and pretty darn sweet! And sometimes he's as daft as a brush, which leads to many Funny Moments. The producers of the show also had a pretty obvious bias toward him, as it feels like every season 6 episode has him crash into something or otherwise a heavy amount of spotlight.\n\nSadly, this made me start to feel a bit annoyed as him being used so much doesn't mean he was used well! But that's passed now, because s7 [for all it's blandness] did different things and the Golden Era of s1 - s5 actually has variety and balance and a better eye for how to use the characters... Like Percy! Cause he was heavily featured in 2 and 5 but so much better it didn't feel like he was being pushed, haha\n\nIt's also kinda funny to think how in and out of universe, he was originally a Replacement Thomas before diverging and becoming his own engine, (even if s6 did have him as the Main Character) but when you again consider some of his defining traits being Small, Cheeky, the Station Pilot who was mentored by Edward, and even pulling Annie and Clarabel early on.\n\nI do prefer the version of Percy who has the hidden roughness (contrast with Thomas who's more upfront about it lol) and his own things to do, being more Goods-based and Harbour located, and later being the de-facto Post Train puller, while still having Ffarquhar as his main home. And he's a bouncy, playful sort'a fella, which contrasts nicely with how Thomas holds his work so importantly.\n\nFavourite moment\n\nFirst that comes to mind is his Wheeshing at Henry, which is so unexpectedly big and loud that Henry scoots tf outta there in panic. Legend hours only!\n\nFor a somewhat longer moment is Percy's Promise, cause while his heroics that day would later engorge his head and make him do something stupid later, he was legit impressive at the time lol\n\nAlso Promise shows how dang unlucky he is, cause Thomas lets him pull the Sunday School train as a favour, to be a nice break! [Trombone WUP WAH sound as the camera cuts to the flooded line]\n\nIdea for a story\n\nI don't have fresh ideas at present, the WIP I do have features him fairly heavily, but the most I'll say here is that grew out of my musing on Duck's post lol\n\nI would be curious about his pre-Sodor times, though! He's meant to have had a long and chequered past, predating most of the cast members and having been all over the country, but even if it was limited to the warehouse FC1 eventually buys him in, who are the other engines? Are they friends or foe? What was Percy called, seeing that Sir Hatt names him on the spot?\n\nUnpopular opinion\n\nPercy + Crashing ≠ Instant Classic Ep, Season bloomin' Six!\n\nI also feel his naïve nature and general ignorance is leaned on too hard. It's very transparently to have a convo between him and Thomas for the benefit of the Kiddie Audience but it doesn't feel authentic to either character when they stop and are like:\n\nPercy: What is \"Money\"?\n\nThomas: [looks at the audience with generic smile mask on] Money can be exchanged for goods and services.\n\nPercy: Oooh, I wish I had money! Then I could buy a lovely bow tie! [Imagine spot of him wearing one]\n\nThat's the sort of template that became weirdly common, and it's one of the early signs that the series was sliding to be more Children Friendly at the cost of it's actual broad appeal. Man...\n\nFavourite relationship:\n\nDone right, done well? Then yes, I really am fond of the Best Bud dynamic he and Thomas have. They have enough in common and enough different to bounce off each other well!\n\n...I just feel like it more often isn’t done to actually be in character for one or both of them. Like I just said with the ‘Percy is Dumb so Thomas explains basic life fixture to him’ example, Thomas tends to get stripped down to a bland slightly wiser role who’s there because he’s the title character, while Percy is treated as the most important character who has to be in every episode but also Learn things and oof the Sixth Season did do a number on me lol\n\n(Literally the best ‘Thomas Explains Something To Percy’ moment was in Percy takes the plunge, as Thomas was using his own experience with the mine but Percy takes the story too literally and doesn’t get the point lol)\n\nI like it when they’re competent, hard workers who are mostly in sync but also have silly rows over things and get into prank wars. They cooperate on the Post Trains and Percy is one of a very small number of engines Thomas trusts with Annie and Clarabel. They also bicker and stew over comments the other made, which is indeed a Sibling type behaviour and doesn’t contradict the affection they still have for each other.\n\nThe alternative brotp is Percy and Duck, which again I touched on in Duck’s ask and Jobey went into more depth on! Combined they are a well oiled machine and don’t seem to suffer the same OOC bouts, so it’s a lot of fun seeing them doing stuff~\n\nFavourite headcanon\n\nPercy is absolutely older and wiser than he comes across. Some of his baby faced, wide eyed curious nature is a careful construct, all the better to take the meaner types by surprise when Percy does his stuff very effectively. Also he can’t carry a tune in a bucket, haha"
