        "text": "Thomas the Tank Engine\n\nThe Works of WV Awdry | On TV and in Film | The Books and the Characters\n\nThe Characters\n\nThe original series of Thomas the Tank Engine books introduced a whole range of characters, some more popular than others and some appeared in many of the books, while others were just 'bit players'. Here is a list of some of the most common characters:\n\nThe Fat Controller\n\nThe Fat Controller, also known as Sir Topham Hat1, runs the railways on Sodor. He is strict with his engines but always fair. Rarely seen without his top hat and tails.\n\nBertie the Bus\n\nBertie is a small, red single-decker bus. He arrived on the island soon after Thomas got his own branch line and the two became good friends, having had races and helped each other out on numerous occasions. Despite sometimes teasing the engines about being stuck on rails, Bertie is a friendly, helpful little bus.\n\nBill and Ben\n\nBill and Ben are identical twins, two bright yellow pannier engines. If you can't see their nameplates on their sides, you'd never be able to tell them apart. They work in the clay quarry on Sodor and are frequently to be heard arguing amongst themselves. They also have the reputation of being very mischievous and love teasing the other engines.\n\nBoco\n\nBoco is a green diesel engine. He works with Bill and Ben in the Clay pits and has to put up with their arguments and teasing. However, he keeps his sense of humour and smiles in the face of the terrible twins.\n\nCaroline\n\nAn old fashioned vintage car. Caroline isn't very fast and is a little fragile, but she loves pottering around the country lanes and taking people on picnics.\n\nDaisy\n\nDaisy is a small diesel passenger train. She was sent to the island originally to help out on Thomas' branch line after he'd suffered an accident. When she first arrived she wasn't very popular, appearing stuck up and insulting Annie and Clarabelle (Thomas' coaches). She eventually calmed down however and is now very popular with the other engines.\n\nDiesel\n\nKnown as 'Devious Diesel' by the other engines. He came to the island 'on trial' but was quickly sent away after upsetting the other engines. Later on, when the Fat Controller needed an extra engine in an emergency, Diesel was the only one available, so he was sent back to the island. However, the other engines still distrust him and he's always ready to cause trouble in the engine sheds.\n\nDonald and Douglas\n\nDonald (No 9) and Douglas (No 10) are twins. They are both painted black and the only way to tell them apart is by their numbers, painted on their sides. They came down from Scotland to work on the Fat Controller's railway and have stayed their ever since. Despite the fact that they are a mischievous pair, they are friendly and well liked by all the other engines. Donald has even managed to 'adopt' a pet duck, who travels everywhere with him in his cab.\n\nDuck\n\nDuck is a bright green GWR2 pannier tank engine who has his own little branch line on the island. His proper name is Montague, but he much prefers Duck.\n\nEdward\n\nEdward is one of the older engines on the island. Painted bright blue, with the number 2 on his tender, he runs a little branch line which stretches from Brendam on the coast to Wellworth.\n\nGordon\n\nGordon is a bright blue engine. Built in Doncaster as a prototype for The Flying Scotsman, he is a proud engine, a little snobbish at times but a hard worker all the same. Gordon is the fastest and strongest engine on the island, the trouble is that he knows it as well!\n\nHarold\n\nHarold the Helicopter is based at an airfield near Thomas' branch line. He's often busy in an emergency, dropping supplies for snowed-in villagers, hot drinks for stranded passengers, or just looking out for tourists on the beach.\n\nHenry\n\nHenry is a bright green engine with the number three painted on his side. He's nearly as big and fast as Gordon, but tends to be a little sensitive. When he first arrived on the island he refused to come out of a tunnel 'because the rain will damage my nice green paint'. He had a lot of teething problems when he first arrived on the island, he had to have a new smokebox fitted so that he could run on normal coal, instead of the expensive Welsh coal he was used to. He's still a bit of a hypochondriac though and often suffers from boiler trouble and colds. Despite this, he's friendly enough and always willing to help the other engines out.\n\nJames\n\nJames is a bright red engine. Shortly after he arrived on the island he was damaged when his wooden brake blocks caught fire. However he was soon repaired and even had an extra pair of wheels fitted to the front. He's a mixed traffic engine, meaning he's equally at home pulling passengers as pulling trucks. His bright red paint and polished brass dome makes him a little conceited at times, which usually leads to his downfall.\n\nMavis\n\nMavis is a small diesel shunting engine, she normally works in the quarry but has been known to help out Toby with the tram. She's a little high spirited however and often gets into trouble.\n\nOliver\n\nOliver, along with his brake van, Toad, were saved from the scrapyard by Douglas. He is a green GWR engine and now is quite happy helping out on Duck's branch line.\n\nPercy\n\nPercy is the smallest of the Fat Controller's engines. He is painted bright green and carries the number six. He's a cheerful little thing but isn't very brave.\n\nRusty\n\nRusty, as his name suggests, is a little worse for wear. An old diesel shunting engine, he works around the docks. He's not afraid of anything and will always help out, regardless of the consequences.\n\nTerence the Tractor\n\nTerence runs on caterpillar tracks, he lives on a farm near Thomas' station - Ffarquhar. He's often being teased by the engines for being slow, but he's proved himself really useful on various occasions, whether it be clearing snow blocked roads, landslides or pulling engines out of snowdrifts.\n\nThomas\n\nThomas the Tank Engine is the most famous steam engine on the island. He was originally loaned to The Fat Controller from the south of England. Once he had proved himself to be 'a really useful engine' he was given his own branch line and a permanent place on the island. He's a cheerful little blue engine, cheeky at times, but always happy to help out when needed. He runs his little branch line pulling two old coaches, named Annie and Clarabelle.\n\nToby\n\nToby is an unusual little engine. Originally designed to pull trams he has side plates covering his wheels and a cowcatcher on the front. He's a lot older than most of the engines, but that doesn't stop him running the tram and pulling goods trains when needed. He has his own little coach named Henrietta, who, strangely enough, is the only named character on the island never to have been drawn with a face.\n\nTrevor the Traction Engine\n\nTrevor was saved from the scrapyard by James and Edward. He's very old now and spends most of his day asleep in the Sun, but his favourite pastime is to take children on rides around the field.\n\nTrucks\n\nWhilst not given individual characters in the stories. Trucks are generally bad tempered, obstinate things, whose sole purpose in life seems to be making things hard for the engines, either refusing to cooperate or, if they can get away with it, pushing the smaller engines around the yards. Many a small engine has ended up in a lot of trouble because of the trucks.\n\nBibliography\n\nNo.1 The Three Railway Engines - 1945\n\nEdward's Day Out\n\nEdward and Gordon\n\nThe Sad Story of Henry\n\nEdward, Gordon and Henry\n\nNo. 2 Thomas the Tank Engine - 1946\n\nThomas and Gordon\n\nThomas' Trains\n\nThomas and the Trucks\n\nThomas and the Breakdown Train\n\nNo. 3 James the Red Engine - 1948\n\nJames and the Top Hat\n\nJames and the Bootlace\n\nTroublesome Trucks\n\nJames and the Express\n\nNo. 4 Tank Engine Thomas Again - 1949\n\nThomas and the Guard\n\nThomas goes Fishing\n\nThomas, Terence and the Snow\n\nThomas and Bertie\n\nNo. 5 Troublesome Engines - 1950\n\nHenry and the Elephant\n\nTenders and Turntables\n\nTrouble in the Shed\n\nPercy Runs Away\n\nNo. 6 Henry the Green Engine - 1951\n\nCoal\n\nThe Flying Kipper\n\nGordon's Whistle\n\nPercy and the Trousers\n\nHenry's Sneeze\n\nNo. 7 Toby the Tram Engine - 1952\n\nDirty Objects\n\nMrs Kyndley's Christmas\n\nThomas in Trouble\n\nToby and the Stout Gentleman\n\nNo. 8 Gordon the Big Engine - 1953\n\nDown the Mine\n\nLeaves\n\nOff the Rails\n\nPaintpots and Queens\n\nNo. 9 Edward the Blue Engine - 1954\n\nBertie's Chase\n\nCows\n\nOld Iron\n\nSaved from Scrap\n\nNo. 10 Four Little Engines - 1955\n\nOld Faithful\n\nPeter Sam and the Refreshment Lady\n\nSir Handel\n\nSkarloey Remembers\n\nNo. 11 Percy the Small Engine - 1956\n\nDuck Takes Charge\n\nPercy and Harold\n\nPercy and the Signal\n\nPercy's Promise\n\nNo. 12 The Eight Famous Engines - 1957\n\nDouble Header\n\nGordon goes Foreign\n\nPercy Takes the Plunge\n\nThe Fat Controller's Engines\n\nNo. 13 Duck and the Diesel Engine - 1958\n\nA Close Shave\n\nDirty Work\n\nDomeless Engines\n\nPop Goes the Diesel\n\nNo. 14 The Little Old Engines - 1959\n\nHome at Last\n\nLittle old Twins\n\nRock 'n' Roll\n\nTrucks\n\nNo. 15 The Twin Engines - 1960\n\nBrake Van\n\nHullo Twins\n\nThe Deputation\n\nThe Missing Coach\n\nNo. 16 Branch Line Engines - 1961\n\nBulls-eyes\n\nDaisy\n\nPercy's Predicament\n\nThomas Comes to Breakfast\n\nNo. 17 Gallant Old Engine - 1962\n\nGallant Old Engine\n\nPassengers and Polish\n\nSpecial Funnel\n\nSteam-Roller\n\nNo. 18 Stepney the Bluebell Engine - 1963\n\nThe Bluebells of England\n\nBowled Out\n\nStepney's Special\n\nTrain Stops Play\n\nNo. 19 Mountain Engines - 1964\n\nBad Look-out\n\nDanger Points\n\nDevil's Back\n\nMountain Engine\n\nNo. 20 Very Old Engines - 1965\n\nBucking Bronco\n\nCrosspatch\n\nDuck and Dukes\n\nStick-in-the-Mud\n\nNo. 21 Main Line Engines - 1966\n\nBuzz Buzz\n\nEdward's Exploits\n\nThe Diseasel\n\nWrong Road\n\nNo. 22 Small Railway Engines - 1967\n\nBallast\n\nMike's Whistle\n\nTit for Tat\n\nUseful Railway\n\nNo. 23 Enterprising Engines - 1968\n\nEscape\n\nLittle Western\n\nSuper Rescue\n\nTenders for Henry\n\nNo. 24 Oliver the Western Engine - 1969\n\nBulgy\n\nDonald's Duck\n\nResource and Sagacity\n\nToad Stands By\n\nNo. 25 Duke the Lost Engine - 1970\n\nBulldog\n\nGranpuff\n\nSleeping Beauty\n\nYou Can't Win\n\nNo. 26 Tramway Engines - 1972\n\nGhost Train\n\nMavis\n\nToby's Tightrope\n\nWoolly Bear\n\nThe last book to be written by Rev.
