        "text": "Plot\n\nRebecca is so impressed by Belle putting out a fire with her water cannons, Marion's steam shovel and Harvey's crane that her enthusiasm makes her friends feel very good about themselves. But she can't help wondering if she has any special qualities too?\n\n---\n\nSo we got our second Rebecca episode and I see it as very good. It has a similar plot as 'Best Engine Ever' but I liked it better than the S19 episode because it feels like something that Rebecca could hold with her personality. It has a nice message at the end about being yourself in your own way and what makes Rebecca special in her own way in this episode is that she sees good in all other engines, as she was amazed by their unique characteristics. The dream sequence was something I have a laugh at as well, although with D10's claw there should've been a moment between him and Rebecca with her praising about his claw. Diesel 10 was surprised that someone found his claw amazing as he sees other engines finding it scary and with Rebecca saying that she doesn't, it made Diesel 10. Could be one of the sweetest moments in the show, plus the shot in fantasy sequence gave me a S2 feeling towards it, a similar shot was like that at the end of the episode, 'Cows'. There were other funny moments too like the gameshow style scene with Rebecca and Marion. There was also a cute little moment between Rebecca and Percy that I can't help but aww at. It feels like a big sister praising her little brother out of cuteness. It's also a bit of a coincidence that the voice actress of Rebecca, Rachael Miller, is actually married to Christopher Ragland, the US voice of Percy. I wonder if Davey Moore made that scene specially? Hmm...\n\nThe episode was also the debut of the new voices for Bill and Ben. To me I quite like it that they got new voices as Johnathan Broadbent's voices were a bit similar. The new voices are more distinct but it doesn't mean that Broadbent did a bad, his acting feel like something the twins would sound like in real life and I say all the best to him!\n\nEpisode Rating\n\nNumber One Engine - 8/10\n\nForever and Ever - 8.5/10\n\nThomas and the Dragon - 10/10\n\nConfusion Without Delay - 10/10\n\nTrusty Trunky - 6.5/10\n\nWhat Rebecca Does - 9/10\n\nSeries Rating (So far):\n\n52/60"
