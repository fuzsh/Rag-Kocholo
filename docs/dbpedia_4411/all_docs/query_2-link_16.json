But he is optimistic, ideal, altruistic, and has a heart of gold. A friend to all locomotives and a popular member of the Fat Controller Railroad, Thomas is the number one locomotive. It’s a favorite with little ones, and it’s an obvious choice as decoration for parties, parks and more.\n\nDuring the production process, we especially retained Thomas’s classic train sound to make it more vivid and appear in real life.
