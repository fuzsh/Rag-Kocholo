        "text": "Thomas and the Magic Railroad (originally under a working title Thomas and the Rainbow Railway) is a 2000 British-American feature film based on the TV series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends and Shining Time Station. The film tells the story of the caretaker of an enchanted steam engine, and a conductor whose magical gold dust is running low, both of whom enlist the help of Thomas the Tank Engine to defeat the evil Diesel 10.\n\nDirected and written by Britt Allcroft.\n\nTake the magic journey.(taglines)\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nGordon: [waits at the station] 5, 6, 7, 8...\n\nThomas: [pulls up beside Gordon] Who do we appreciate? Practicing your numbers, Gordon. That's a good engine.\n\nGordon: I'm counting how many seconds late you are. What does that sign say?\n\nThomas: Hmm… [reads the sign] \"Sodor Railway, really reliable and right on time. Signed, head of the railway, Sir Topham Hatt.\"\n\nGordon: But you weren't on time, little Thomas.\n\nThomas: And you're being bossy, Gordon. [Gordon scoffs again] Now, please excuse me. I'm meeting Mr. Conductor. He's looking after us while Sir Topham Hatt takes a much needed holiday.\n\nGordon: Oh, I think we can take care of ourselves.\n\nDiesel 10: [rushes through the station] Get outta my way! I have unfinished business here, and I wanna finish it fast!\n\nGordon: [quivers] Diesel 10's back!\n\nThomas: Yes, 10 out of 10 for devious deeds and brutal strength! The blast from the past who hates steam engines!\n\nGordon: Maybe we do need Mr. Conductor here after all. On time!\n\nLily: Grandpa's been so sad since Grandma Tasha died, and he never comes here to see us.\n\nMrs. Stone: Well, maybe your visit will cheer him up. Did you get his present?\n\nLily: Here. I'm making him a friendship bracelet.\n\nMrs. Stone: Honey, that's beautiful.\n\nLily: But I'd rather just stay here with you.\n\nMrs. Stone: I know. Come here. [she and Lily hug]\n\nLily: I'm gonna go up this way.\n\nMrs. Stone: Okay. Be careful.\n\nLily: You always say that.\n\nMrs. Stone: See you in a minute.\n\nLily: You're coming with me to Grandpa's, Bluebird. I know how much you like to travel.\n\nToby: What's important is to stand up on our own wheels to Diesel.\n\nHenry: Toby's right. Diesel knows that the lost engine in the legend really exists.\n\nJames: What engine?\n\nPercy: What legend?\n\nHenry: An engine who's magic makes her more powerful than Diesel will ever be. That's why he wants to find her.\n\nPercy: Then we'd better find her, first.\n\nJames: [puffs out of the shed] Leave it to the big engines, Percy.\n\n[Mr. Conductor picks up a baseball bat]\n\nMr. Conductor: [chuckles] So, who dropped the ball then? [catches a beach ball] Oh, there you are. I'd like a nice cup of hot cocoa. Would you fellas care to join me? No? What would you rather do instead? [to the beach ball] Go outside and play? Well, I can understand that. [to the bat] What do you think? [makes the bat hit the ball; mock disappointment] Why do you keep hitting him like that? You're gonna have to have a time out. [throws bat on his bed and makes his hot cocoa]\n\n[Diesel 10 appears and laughs evilly]\n\nMr. Conductor: [sips cocoa] Just a little sweeter, I think. [adds sugar to cocoa]\n\nDiesel 10: All right, Pinchy, my little bucket of badness, time to feast yourself.\n\nMr. Conductor: [sips cocoa again, and is satisfied] Ahh. Now that's better. [Diesel 10 tears off part of the sheds] Whoa! [removes his night cap and puts on his conductor hat, as the steam engines wake up in alarm, and Diesel 10 tears off more of the sheds and laughs evilly] Ahh! Whoa!\n\nThomas: [alarmed] Cinders and ashes! It's Diesel!\n\nGordon: Diesel?! Oh, no!\n\n[Diesel 10 laughs evilly]\n\nDiesel 10: Hello, Twinkle Toes! I got a plan and you're not in it!\n\nMr. Conductor: You can't catch me, Diesel! [blows on his whistle twice, but only a little gold comes out of it]\n\nDiesel 10: [laughs coldly] Losing your sparkle, huh? What perfect timing. Now where is that lost engine?\n\nMr. Conductor: You won't find her here.\n\nDiesel 10: You're not clever enough to stop me.\n\nMr. Conductor: Oh, yes I am!\n\nDiesel 10: No, you're not! Ah- [sees Mr. Conductor hold up a bag of sugar] What–?! Is that...?!\n\nMr. Conductor: That's right, it's sugar, Diesel! And if I throw this in your tank, it'll seize you up for good!\n\nDiesel 10: [grunts and chuffs away] Make the most of tonight, Twinkle Toes, because you won't like tomorrow! Neither will that... that line of tin kettles! [to his claw] Shut up, Pinchy!\n\nThomas: [after the diesel leaves] Mr. Conductor, but what happened to your sparkle?\n\nMr. Conductor: I don't know, Thomas, I'll just have to sleep on that.\n\nThomas: [confused] On your sparkle?\n\nMr. Conductor: No, Thomas. On the problem of what happened to it.\n\nPercy: Oh, but Mr. Conductor, without your sparkle or the Lost Engine, you can't travel here to help us anymore.\n\nMr. Conductor: I'll solve the problem. You just go to sleep now.\n\nPercy: Easy for you to say.\n\nBertie: Smile, you steamers. It's a sunny day. Vroom-vroom!\n\nJames: It's not sunny, 'cause Mr. C's not at the windmill, I looked!\n\nThomas: I think his sparkle's all gone.\n\nHenry: My smoke box doesn't feel sunny. It feels stuffed up.\n\nGordon: Nasty fumes from dingy Diesel 10! [chuckles]\n\nHenry: And Diesel is after the lost engine.\n\nToby: And if he finds her, I fear that will destroy us all.\n\nGordon: What, even an engine as big as me?!\n\nToby: Yes, Gordon, even you.\n\n[Thomas sneezes]\n\nJames: Say it, don't spray it, Thomas!\n\nThomas: I've still got sneezing powder up my funnel.\n\n[Junior's shell phone rings]\n\nJunior: [wakes up] That's my shell phone. [pulls off his headphones, and answers his shell phone] Hello?\n\nMr. Conductor: Junior? Junior, is that you?!\n\nJunior: Oh, hi, Cous! Uh, are you in a tunnel? This isn't a very good line.\n\nMr. Conductor: Junior, where are you?!\n\nJunior: Um, I'm in paradise. I just got in Cloud 9 and here I am.\n\nMr. Conductor: Junior, listen to me. You've got to come to the Island of Sodor RIGHT NOW!\n\nJunior: Now? But I'm waiting on a perfect wave!\n\nMr. Conductor: Oh, no. You're not, you're coming here! [Junior sighs in annoyance] You have to help me find the source of all our family's gold dust.\n\nJunior: What is the source?\n\nMr. Conductor: That's the trouble, Junior. I haven't a clue!\n\nJunior: And I've used up most of my gold dust, too.\n\nMr. Conductor: [shocked] What?! [Junior sighs] Then go to Shining Time Station first. And in my signal-house in the box under the staircase, you'll find my emergency whistle with the last of my supply. Please take care of this, Junior, and... [quietly] Don't talk to anyone about the buffers.\n\nJunior: [loses the signal] What buffers?\n\nMr. Conductor: Shh!\n\nJunior: This is a really bad line! Hello! My shell phone's not working properly!\n\nMr. Conductor: Junior, you got to come here right away! I'm counting on you!\n\nJunior: Hello?! [throws out his phone] I want my money back.\n\nThomas: Morning, Henry. What's the matter?\n\nHenry: I've got... [sniffs] boiler ache.\n\nThomas: And I'm collecting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 trucks of special Island of Sodor coal for you.\n\nHenry: Oh, thank you, Thomas. Special coal will make me feel... [sneezes] ...much better!\n\nThomas: [backs into the trucks] I wish I could make Mr. Conductor feel better too by finding him.\n\n[the sixth truck goes zooming into a pair of buffers with a nearby tumbleweed and disappears into them; Thomas pulls the remaining trucks as Bertie passes by]\n\nBertie: Hello, Thomas and your 5 coal trucks! Vroom-vroom!\n\nThomas: 5? But I'm supposed to have 6.\n\n[Percy puffs into the night by Diesel 10's Mountain]\n\nPercy: I am brave. I am brave. Thomas says I'm brave, so I'm brave. Oh, it's not easy being brave. [sees Splatter and Dodge at the buffers] Shiver my pistons. There's Splatter and Dodge. Oh, they found the buffers! Oh, now what's going to happen? [a flock of birds fly by a tree] Ohh!\n\nTumbleweed: [rolls along] Hey, partner. Excuse me, coming through, pardon me.\n\nPercy: Oh, that's just nothing. [a shed door opens slowly, then closes quickly] That nothing was something!\n\nSplatter: These must be the buffers Diesel's looking for.\n\nDodge: Are we supposed to go through them?\n\nSplatter: Not we, you.\n\nDodge: Not me, you.\n\nSplatter: This is a job for the boss. [an owl hoots, scaring them] We'll tell him tomorrow.\n\nDodge: Yeah, tomorrow's good.\n\nPercy: [backs away] Oh, I'd better hurry back and warn Thomas.\n\n[while approaching the old magic buffers]\n\nThomas: I promise I'll get you home to your grandfather, Lily.\n\nTumbleweed: [starts leading Thomas to the buffers] Follow me, partner!\n\nThomas: Whoa!\n\nTumbleweed: Right this way to Bufferville, just a walk in the park!\n\nThomas: We're going though, Lily.\n\nTumbleweed: You're on your own here on in, little blue buckaroo! Yee-hoo! [bounces off the track]\n\nThomas: Little engines can do big things! [passes through the magic buffers]\n\nLady: [gets her face in the Magic Railroad] So, Burnett, you didn't forget about magic. It's safe inside you. [later; Thomas toots]\n\nLily: Thomas!\n\nThomas: You found her, and she's beautiful!\n\n[after Thomas comes out of the Magic Buffers, Diesel 10, Splatter, and Dodge can see him with Lady]\n\nDiesel 10: Ah-ha! There's the blue puffball, and look who he's with! Splodge, come and destroy!\n\nSplatter: N-No, y-you do it yourself.\n\nDodge: We don't like you.\n\nSplatter: Yeah, we mean that.\n\nDodge: Emphatically.\n\nSplatter: Yeah. What does that mean?\n\nDodge: I have no idea.\n\nSplatter: It's a good word.\n\nThomas: Run, Lady! Quickly, and I'm going to help you!\n\nBurnett: So am I, my Lady. I'll not let you down again.\n\nDiesel 10: Ahh, who needs you, Splodge?\n\n[the conductors finally get their supply of magic gold dust]\n\nThomas: Lady, you're a helpful engine.\n\nLady: And helping each other brings to life the magic in all of us.\n\n[last line]\n\nMr. Conductor: [narrating]: And so we've come to the happy end of our story, and it's time for all of us to go home, just like Thomas.\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nPulling into theaters everywhere July 2000.\n\nTake the magic journey.\n\nLittle Engines Can Do Big Things...\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLive-action\n\n[edit]\n\nAlec Baldwin - Mr. Conductor\n\nMara Wilson - Lily Stone\n\nPeter Fonda - Burnett Stone\n\nJared Wall (young)\n\nMichael E.
