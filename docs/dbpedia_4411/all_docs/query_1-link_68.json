        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nLuke's heart pounded wildly in his chest, so intensely that he feared it might leap from his torso and flee, just like he wished he could.\n\nThey were getting closer to the Garden of the Hesperides by the minute, and quickly.\n\nBefore him, the forest had given way to rugged gorges, with only a few blades of grass sprouting in the rocky terrain.\n\nEverything was shrouded in a thick fog that blurred their vision, or that’s how it appeared to Luke during the fleeting moments when the landscape around the mail truck wasn’t distorting.\n\nAt least, he consoled himself, we are well-rested after spending the afternoon napping in the car.\n\nThey hadn’t stepped out at all during that time.\n\nLuke had to admit that, for both himself and Levi, their reluctance to leave was partly due to their fear of the creepy god appearing suddenly, like some kind of bogeyman.\n\nYet, when they had looked out the car windows, everything appeared normal—no monsters or deities had been in sight. This was very surprising, and frankly, a little suspicious, considering that three demigods in one place for an extended period of time was bound to attract unwanted attention.\n\nBut, really, it wasn’t all that relevant at this point; their priority was completing the quest, which took precedence over everything else.\n\n“We’re almost at Mount Tamalpais.” Kat announced, her voice cutting through the air. As she slowed down, she added, “The Mist here is very thick. I’ll park nearby, and then we’ll need to continue on foot to find the entrance.”\n\nSoon, she was maneuvering the car to the best of her ability into a space a short distance from the main road. The rocks and uneven terrain made it challenging, and she carefully avoided getting too close to the precipice.\n\nLuke appreciated her caution; while they were risking their lives on a stupid quest, he wasn’t eager to add falling to his death to the list of potential problems.\n\nAs soon as they parked, Kat stepped out of the mail truck without even grabbing her gear and approached the fog with a contemplative expression. Meanwhile, Luke and Levi hesitated, adjusting their equipment before following, armed and alert, and scanning their surroundings with caution.\n\n“Interesting…” Kat murmured, her gaze fixed on a spot in the road where the fog appeared denser. If Luke’s senses weren’t playing tricks on him, it was also thick with the Mist.\n\nThat might be the entrance to the Garden.\n\nHe remembered that the closer one got to it, the denser the Mist became, which obscured the location quite well.\n\nHowever, was it simply hidden, or was it in an entirely different realm, like a pocket dimension? After all, it could only be accessed in the evenings.\n\nIt was an intriguing thought exercise, though irrelevant to their current situation. Still, he couldn’t help it; he was nervous, and his mind was racing, fixating on anything other than what they were about to do.\n\n“Can you guys smell that?” Levi sniffed the air and squinted, adding, “It smells like eucalyptus.”\n\nNow that the other man mentioned it, Luke could smell it too. It was a pleasant and calming aroma, crisp and clean, reminding him of the chewing gum people used to freshen their breath.\n\nAnd if this scent was here…\n\n“We’re close.” Kat declared, returning to the car to quickly grab her gear and arm herself. As she adjusted her first-aid belt—equipped with both mortal supplies and demigod essentials like nectar and ambrosia—she suggested, “I think we should head toward the thickest part of the fog. The Mist here is so heavy that it’s likely messing with our senses, which is why we’re seeing just a regular road.”\n\nFunny that she took notice of that instead of how his father’s car seemed to bend reality to travel faster.\n\n“Do you really think it’s a good idea to just waltz in without checking?” Levi asked, eyeing the road with suspicion and clear tension.\n\n“We don’t have any better options, so we need to stay silent and move carefully. And now that I’ve said that, keep your mouth shut.” She replied, making her way to the middle of the road.\n\nAfter a split second of hesitation, Kat extended her hand into one of the sheets of fog crossing the road.\n\nThe silence that followed her action was so profound that a pin could have been heard dropping to the ground.\n\nAll three of them froze, nervously watching the mist for any sign of an enraged dragon charging out to chase them. When nothing happened, Katherine took a deep breath and stepped fully into it.\n\nLuke’s breath caught as he watched the fog envelop his friend, his eyes widening when she was nowhere to be seen once it cleared.\n\nHis worry didn’t last long, though, as she soon reappeared in the same spot, signaling them to follow and pressing a finger to her lips to warn them to keep quiet.\n\nAfter exchanging a hesitant glance with Levi, Luke moved forward cautiously until he stood before a wall of Mist so dense it seemed almost corporeal. Watching it warily, he poked it with one finger, then quickly pulled his hand back from the strange sensation.\n\nTo his surprise, it wasn’t exactly unpleasant.\n\nHe was so used to the gods’ auras dominating their surroundings, heavy with intention and presence, that this almost soft sensation felt like a completely novel experience.\n\nIn a way, it seemed more natural—certainly more subtle.\n\nShaking his head, he steeled himself and took a step forward. Instantly, the Mist seemed to embrace him, sending a warm sensation through his body. Before long, his feet touched the ground on the other side, and while he was still on the same mountainside, there were some clear differences.\n\nThe road had turned to dirt, and the grass was thicker and a brighter shade of green. Up ahead, the mountain peak seemed closer, with the clouds spiraling toward it as if the sky longed to merge with the earth once more—interrupted only by Atlas, eternally burdened with the task of holding the heavens upon his shoulders.\n\nMost notably, there was only one path forward: the Garden of the Hesperides.\n\nIt was a beautiful place, Luke had to admit. The grass shimmered silver under the setting sun, and a variety of flowers, whose names he didn’t know, bloomed in such vibrant colors they appeared to glow in the shadows. The sunset bathed the scene in a vast palette of hues, making the whole view even more otherworldly.\n\nIn the center of the clearing, set some distance away and framed by black marble stones as if it were a work of art, stood a massive apple tree, towering above everything around them—easily the size of a five-story building.\n\nThere, hanging from its branches, were their targets: the golden apples. They gleamed like polished metal, their smooth, enticing surface made even more irresistible by their intoxicating fragrance.\n\nThe apples appeared so appetizing that Luke felt he would forever regret not reaching out and taking a bite.\n\nBefore he could even think about doing something so utterly stupid, it quickly became clear why Katherine had silently signaled them to be quiet.\n\nCoiled around the trunk was a colossal, snake-like creature, its serpentine body as thick as the tree it guarded, with countless heads fused together at the neck, resembling a nightmarish pseudo-octopus. The monster appeared to be asleep, or at least some of its heads were, while others languidly chewed on leaves that smelled suspiciously like the eucalyptus scent the demigods had noticed as they neared the Garden.\n\nIn short, Ladon looked like a grotesque science experiment gone wrong.\n\n“Holy shit.” Levi whispered, his hands gripping his bow so tightly they turned white, his eyes fixed on the dragon with obvious fear.\n\nQuietly, Luke moved closer to the other man, silently offering support. He couldn’t deny that part of his reason was the intimidation he felt from the sight.\n\n“Strange…” Katherine murmured, her eyes scanning the landscape as if searching for something.\n\nShrugging it off but still keeping a wary eye out, she signaled for them to move closer.\n\nThey took cover behind some rocks, reluctant to advance any further toward the Garden.\n\n“The place is too open.” Luke hissed as they formed a tight circle, speaking in low tones while standing close together.\n\nKat stole another glance at the tree before crouching back down and whispering, “On one hand, it’ll make your job easier since there’ll be fewer obstacles during your run.” She narrowed her eyes and huffed. “On the other hand, finding a discreet spot to shoot from without getting spotted will be tough.”\n\n“How good are you with a bow, Levi?” Luke asked, though he already knew the other demigod was a pretty good shot, nervously peering over the rock.\n\nIf only they had a rope…but it would create too much drag, and Levi wasn’t skilled enough to make it work.\n\nBesides, the growing shadows made it difficult to see, and he wasn’t sure if the dragon had night vision, which made their task more complicated but not impossible—he had to believe that.\n\n“Better than you, but worse than the Cabin Seven kids.” The older man replied, his hands trembling as he valiantly tried to steady them.\n\nLuke sincerely hoped he succeeded—otherwise, they were screwed.\n\n“Do you think you can shoot from here?”\n\n“No.” Levi said, glancing into the distance as if mentally calculating the range. “For an accurate shot, I’ll need to get a bit closer.”\n\n“That thing seems to be distracted.” Katherine observed thoughtfully. “If we move quickly, we might be able to grab the apple and get out before it notices.”\n\nIt was true to some extent, but it was still a risky move.\n\nLadon was sprawled around the tree, his many heads resting on the ground like a tangled nest of pythons. Even though none of the heads had their eyes open, a few were still chewing—Luke wasn’t sure if the dragon was actually asleep or if he was displaying some kind of sleepwalking behavior.\n\nAnd he wasn’t particularly eager to find out either.\n\nBut what other choice did he have?\n\nSurveying the area, the blonde spotted a few more rocks further ahead, closer to the shadows and the center of the clearing. Although they wouldn’t offer perfect cover, they could provide a decent spot for shooting in the meantime.\n\n“There.” Luke pointed out his find to the other demigods.\n\nOnce his friends nodded, they carefully crept toward it, freezing still every time the dragon so much as twitched.\n\nWhen Luke reached the spot, he crouched low and carefully scanned the area for any signs of danger. Despite seeing nothing but the overgrown lizard, he couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched.\n\nShaking off the uneasy feeling, he focused on Levi, who positioned himself against the rock and took a moment to steady his breathing. Gradually, the older man’s hands stopped trembling, and he glanced at the other two demigods, giving them a nod.\n\n“I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.”\n\nLuke positioned himself and waited as Levi drew his bow. Nervous energy built up inside him, and doubt gnawed at his insides—would this actually work? If it didn't, what would happen to them?\n\nHe didn’t have much time to dwell on his anxiety, though, as the arrow soared through the air and struck the apple dead center.\n\nAs soon as the fruit was knocked away, Luke moved into action, carefully circling the surprisingly still-dozing monster.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw shadows flickering nearby and glimpsed figures darting ahead of him—almost as if they’d been waiting for it—sprinting toward the same direction with surprising speed and shoving each other roughly.\n\nNarrowing his eyes, Luke quickened his pace and managed to outrun them after a few precious seconds—too precious—capturing their attention in the process.\n\nSilently agreeing on a plan of action, they abruptly stopped their tussle to focus on him. They reached out to grab his shirt and tried to trip him, but he was too fast for their attempts.\n\n“Beware, tis a son of the Messenger, sisters!” One of them called out in warning, causing them to quickly adjust their strategy.\n\nOne by one, they vanished into the shadows, seemingly giving up on their chase. Although Luke was wary of what they might do next, he couldn’t afford to stop running now.\n\nHe had to get the treasure before its guardian woke up and decided he and his friends would make good snacks.\n\nHowever, just as he was about to grab it, relief already flooding his veins, a violent shove from the side threw him off balance.\n\nMoving too fast to stop, he was sent tumbling and rolling uncontrollably across the ground.\n\nDazed, he struggled to get up and saw four women wrestling over the golden apple. Dressed in white Ancient Greek chitons, they looked like relics from another era, frozen in time just like this Garden.\n\nWhile appearing delicate—with caramel skin and dark, lustrous hair cascading over their shoulders—the nymphs were vicious. They yanked at each other’s silky locks and shoved one another whenever someone managed to grab hold of the fruit.\n\nCursing under his breath, Luke prepared himself to leap into the fray and seize the apple. But a flicker of movement at the edge of his vision halted him.\n\nAnother arrow was loosed, though less accurately than before, causing the apple to land much closer to the dragon.\n\nHe hesitated for a moment, eyeing the brawling nymphs with fearful consideration. Despite their aggression, they seemed a lot less dangerous than the massive reptile guarding the tree, and certainly more easily defeated.\n\nHowever, joining the fight would waste valuable time with no guarantee of success, and there was always the risk that they would wake the dragon at any moment.\n\nChoosing his poison, Luke took a deep breath, braced his legs, and sprang forward to snatch the other apple.\n\nAs soon as he grabbed it, things started to go wrong.\n\nThe first problem was that the nymphs quickly noticed what was happening. Stopping to glare at him before shifting their focus to the fruit in his hands with hungry, greedy eyes.\n\nSeizing her chance, one of the young women grabbed the apple they had been fighting over. So captivated was she by her hard-won treasure that she didn’t pursue after Luke, leaving her to stay behind while the other three gave chase.\n\nMuttering curses under his breath, he sped toward his friends, spotting Katherine heading his way with a spear in hand and a ferocious expression on her face. Meanwhile, Levi readied his bow once more, his eyes locked on the frenzied group of women chasing after the younger demigod.\n\nEvery time an arrow flew too close, the nymphs would retreat into the shadows, their laughter echoing mockingly at Kat, who jabbed at the empty spaces they had just occupied with growing frustration. Despite the other demigods’ efforts, the women remained relentless in their pursuit of Luke.\n\nThe nymphs had clearly learned from their previous mistakes. Instead of trying to outrun him, they spread out, with the closest ones advancing whenever he came too near. It was as if they were a pride of lionesses working in perfect coordination to drive their prey into an ambush.\n\nThe second problem was that Ladon was stirring awake, a hundred jaws opening and tasting the air, and the nymphs were deliberately driving the blonde straight toward him.\n\nDeciding that dealing with a pack of nature spirits was far easier than confronting a dragon, Luke quickly pivoted. Crouching slightly to prepare for a sprint, he secured the fruit under his arm and set his sights on a nymph in his path—the one closest in size to himself.\n\nHer wide eyes and momentary pause betrayed her shock as Luke, shifting his weight, drove his shoulder into her torso with force, sending her crashing to the ground.\n\nWithout slowing down once, he bolted toward Levi.\n\nBehind him, another woman’s pained cry of ‘Barbarian!’ pierced the air. A quick glance revealed that Kat had landed a hit, viciously defending his back from the remaining enemies while keeping pace with him to ensure his escape.\n\nBut, just as he neared his friend, the worst possible scenario happened.\n\n“Ladon, arise!” The fallen nymph’s scream echoed through the space, her eyes blazing with fury at the blonde. “Scoundrels! Base and wretched thieves have purloined the Queen’s golden apples!”\n\nTime seemed to stand still as the dragon’s eyes snapped open—each of his hundred heads revealing red orbs with slitted pupils. They scanned the space before focusing on Luke with a chilling intensity.\n\nWith a malicious glare, Ladon uncoiled from his tangled embrace with the apple tree, lifting his heads one by one. Each head bared its lips, revealing massive fangs as long as Luke’s forearm.\n\nAs the dragon stretched to his full, terrifying size, the demigod felt a wave of dizziness wash over him, almost as if he were on the brink of passing out from sheer terror.\n\n“Luke! Run!” Levi’s panicked voice pulled him from his shock.\n\nWith adrenaline pumping through his veins, prompting him to move with increased urgency, the blonde pushed his legs to sprint as fast as he could.\n\nHe caught the stench before he even saw the dragon approaching.\n\nThe foul, acidic odor—like a rotting corpse lodged itself in Ladon’s throat for far longer than it should have—made his eyes water and his head spin, causing him to stumble in confusion for a moment before regaining control of his legs.\n\nBut his brief blunder was enough to leave him surrounded by at least a dozen heads the size of cars, each glaring at him with evident hostility.\n\nHe barely had time to widen his eyes before they began snapping at him, forcing him to use every ounce of his agility and flexibility to navigate through the writhing mass of obstacles eager to devour him—each head so large it seemed capable of swallowing him whole.\n\nDesperately maneuvering to escape the relentless dragon, Luke’s eyes darted around for any possible escape when he spotted the nymph still frozen in fascination at the place where she had snatched the other golden apple.\n\nShe seemed lost in her own world, staring at the fruit in her hands as if unable to believe it was really there.\n\nNot thinking too much about it but frantically hoping it would work, Luke redirected his path toward her.\n\nHe leaped over Ladon’s heads, using them as stepping stones to dodge the others, twisting in midair and rolling smoothly as he landed. Using the momentum, he slid under a snapping jaw that missed him by mere centimeters.\n\nQuickly, the demigod rushed to the dazed woman, pausing only when he was right behind her. This caused the dragon to hesitate in its attacks, not wanting to risk harming her.\n\n“Look, Ladon!” Luke screamed, his voice tinged with hysteria as he pointed to the gleaming golden apple in the nymph’s hands. The sound seemed to rouse her from her trance, making her blink slowly as if waking from a long dream. “Another thief! One of your own, no less!”\n\nThe dragon recoiled, swaying in place as if unsure how to proceed. Some of his heads snapped at the air while others hissed in a lamenting sound, perhaps even expressing a hint of betrayal.\n\n“No!” The nymph cried out in fear, finally shaking off her daze. “It is not as it seems, my dear dragon! Tis but a deceit, a deceit!”\n\nYet, even as she pleaded her innocence, her hands never stopped clutching the apple tightly.\n\nWithout wasting any time, Luke eagerly took advantage of the distraction and bolted toward his friends, who were busy fighting off the remaining women blocking their way and preventing them from helping him.\n\nWhile the demigod ran, he ignored the traitorous nymph’s wails as she tried to explain herself to Ladon, feeling little pity for someone who would have gladly thrown him into the dragon’s maw just to get half a chance to put her hands on the forbidden fruit.\n\nBesides, he didn’t believe the overgrown lizard would actually harm her.\n\nFocusing on the remaining enemies, Luke narrowed his eyes and prepared himself. He secured the apple under one arm and slid along the ground, using the resulting force to roll into position. At the same time, he extended his leg, tripping one of the nymphs who had been overwhelming Levi—now wielding a sword with his bow nowhere in sight.\n\nThe woman promptly lost her balance, allowing the older man to knock her out with the blunt side of his sword.\n\nHowever, that small victory did not last long. The sister of the defeated nymph—who had been tag-teaming Levi with her—let out an angry screech before launching herself at the blonde. He recognized her as the one he had thrown to the ground earlier, the one who had awakened Ladon.\n\nStill furious, she slashed the air in a frenzy, seeming to ignore the golden fruit as she focused on trying to get rid of him first.\n\n“Retreat! Retreat now! We got the apple!” Luke shouted to the other two demigods, evading the enraged woman while his friend attempted to defend him with little success.\n\nUnfortunately, the blonde’s shout had the side effect of catching Ladon’s attention. Though his body remained facing forward, the dragon turned his heads toward them, hissing in fury as he realized how close they were to leaving.\n\nUrging Katherine to move faster with hasty gestures, Luke kept a panicked eye on the dragon, which was drawing closer and closer.\n\nDespite his terror, he wasn’t willing to abandon his friends—both of them. Thus, he stayed behind to ensure their safety, knowing that, since he held the apple, Ladon would focus on him.\n\nThis way, he could distract the oversized mutant lizard long enough for his friends to escape. They were just a short distance from the exit, so he felt he could manage.\n\nIt was so close—freedom, safety, and victory.\n\nHowever, he had, very stupidly, overlooked the nymphs while focusing on the greater threat.\n\nBefore he could even understand what was happening, a beautiful sound rang out across the Garden—a symphony of voices so sweet and enchanting that it made him forget where he was for a moment.\n\nThey seemed to beckon him, inviting him to join them in dance—perhaps indefinitely, even forever.\n\nIn a daze, Luke felt a strange warmth and softness on his head, as if a hidden demon were whispering suggestions in his ear. With a sudden realization, he slapped himself in the face to break free from the spell’s effects.\n\nHaving abandoned their chase, the nymphs had gathered behind Ladon, including the one who had taken the other apple, which was now nowhere in sight. With their hands joined, they sang, their voices infused with magic as they manipulated the melody to lure the demigods toward their deaths.\n\nUnfortunately, even if Luke had noticed the effects before being fully ensnared by the magic, he noted with a faint sense of despair that his brief moment of distraction might have lasted longer than he realized.\n\nLadon loomed in front of him, his massive body blocking the faint moonlight and casting the demigod in shadow. The dragon’s hateful red eyes, glowing more demonically in the darkness, fixed on the boy with burning savagery and a hint of smug triumph.\n\nParalyzed by fear, Luke’s wide eyes watched in slow motion as the creature lifted one enormous foot, each claw three times his size and glinting with a cruel sharpness under the moonlight.\n\nHe knew that if it came down, he would be torn to pieces, but despite this, his legs refused to move, trembling so violently that it was a miracle he managed to stay on his feet.\n\nAs the dragon’s foot began its descent, Luke closed his eyes tightly and braced for the inevitable.\n\nHis life flashed behind his lids as he wondered if fate had truly changed—but, this time, instead of a facial scar, it would claim his life.\n\nIf I die here, will I get to meet Aubrey?\n\nAn invisible string seemed to pull inside his head, and he could almost hear the cackling of those old hags.\n\nBut then, suddenly, he was shoved aside, and a pained scream filled his ears.\n\nOpening his eyes, Luke saw that Levi, his dear, brave, and stupid friend, had pushed him out of harm's way, taking a glancing strike on the process.\n\nReacting purely on instinct before he could fully process his actions, Luke caught the older man before he hit the ground, draping Levi’s arm over his shoulders and clutching the apple tightly with his other hand.\n\nAs if driven by an unseen force, he took advantage of the brief moment the dragon stared at them in surprise—maybe because the demigods weren’t dead—quickly marching away while doing his best to avoid causing more pain to the injured demigod.\n\nThe music had long ceased, and the nymphs were nowhere to be seen, no longer pursuing them.\n\nOnly Ladon, having apparently regained his wits, stubbornly continued the chase. The foul odor of his breath was the only sign Luke had of the dragon’s proximity, as he didn’t dare look back.\n\nFueled by desperation, the blonde pressed on toward the exit, even as he increasingly noticed the putrid smell growing closer and closer.\n\nHowever, before he could lose hope, something flew overhead, and soon a reptilian screech of pain reverberated through the space.\n\n“Come on! Faster!” Kat’s voice urged from near the area where the Mist was stronger. She remained poised in a throwing position, though her spear was nowhere in sight—belatedly, Luke realized that it was the weapon he had seen slicing through the air moments before.\n\nIncreasing his pace, he pulled himself and Levi along as quickly as possible, feeling the ground tremble and hearing the crash of rocks being broken as Ladon's agonized roars filled the air.\n\nWith a profound sense of relief, Luke reached the Garden’s limits, Kat quickly moving to help him support Levi.\n\nThe last thing he saw before crossing the invisible barrier was the nymphs struggling to remove something embedded deep inside one of Ladon’s eyes. Then the Mist enveloped him, and before he knew it, he was back on the road, with their car just a short distance away.\n\nDragging himself to the mail truck, the weight of his injured friend seeming heavier now that the adrenaline had left his senses—even with Katherine supporting the man’s other side—Luke felt disbelief wash over him as he grasped the apple still tightly clutched in his hand.\n\nHe did it; he actually did it.\n\nHowever, as they struggled to lay Levi on the blanket in the back of the car, Luke’s growing happiness was replaced by a profound sense of shock when he finally caught sight of the extent of his friend’s wounds.\n\nThe older man’s torso was drenched in blood, the red stains completely obscuring the original color of his shirt. Levi’s chest bore three enormous gashes: one beginning at a visibly broken collarbone, another running across his stomach and ending near his hip.\n\nThe wounds were so deep that Luke, feeling queasy, could see bone through the torn flesh and catch glimpses of what might be the other demigod’s entrails.\n\nWith his heart clenched, the blonde could only watch in helplessness as a frantic Katherine kept one hand on Levi’s shoulder, chanting urgently, while her other hand scrambled through her first aid kit for nectar.\n\nAfter finding the drink of the gods, she gently dripped several drops into his mouth—more than the blonde had ever seen used before—then set the vial aside. With both hands now free, she placed them on the blood-soaked, crimson-stained chest of the injured man, her brows furrowing.\n\nLuke stared, feeling useless, as a bead of sweat traced down her face from the effort. Her chanting continued without pause, the words blending together until they were little more than a continuous hum inside the car.\n\nMuch to his relief, it seemed to be working: Levi’s wounds appeared less severe, and he seemed to breathe a bit easier, his unfocused eyes blinking blearily in their general direction.\n\nGrasping the other man’s hands and rubbing them between his own to warm them—leaving the golden apple forgotten beside him—Luke frowned and whispered, “You’re an idiot. You shouldn’t have taken that risk.”\n\nLevi gave a weak chuckle, his face contorting with discomfort as even that small effort seemed to hurt him. Though he seemed to be in less agony than before—thanks to Katherine’s glowing hands working to dull his pain and heal him—he remained weak, and his wounds were still serious.\n\n“Princess…needed a hero.” Levi murmured with effort, his voice raspy and strained. Weakly, he attempted to tighten his grip on Luke’s hands, turning his head slowly to meet the younger boy’s gaze with a determined expression. “I saw too…”\n\nFurrowing his brows in confusion, the blonde patted the other man’s hands comfortingly. He didn’t fully understand what Levi wanted to say but wasn’t willing to force him to talk—the act seemed to take too much out of his friend.\n\nHowever, Levi chose to speak again.\n\nAppearing a little puzzled, he frowned slightly, and the words he uttered filled Luke with a deep sense of dread, making the world around him feel frozen and his ears ring.\n\n“W-why is it so cold?”\n\n“Katherine!” Luke cried out in dismay, desperately trying to warm Levi’s hands while his wide eyes watched the man’s lips turn blue and his shaking grow more intense.\n\nShe didn’t reply, but her chants grew more frantic, causing the light in her hands to intensify as she poured all her energy into saving their friend.\n\nBut it didn’t seem to be working anymore.\n\n“Lukey.” Levi’s faint voice reached him, prompting the blonde to try and hush him, urging him to conserve his energy. Despite his attempt, the other man’s glazed eyes held a resolute gaze as he continued, “Don’t cry…this is how it must be.”\n\n“No! It isn’t!” Luke exclaimed, tears streaming down his face. He turned to Kat, his voice breaking with desperation as he screamed, “Give him more nectar! Ambrosia! Do something!”\n\n“I can’t!” She snapped, halting her chant as it seemed to do little more than reduce the bleeding. Staring at him with a look of utter despair, she whispered, “I can’t. He’ll burn.”\n\n“A life for a life…” Levi continued muttering as if he could no longer hear the desperate pleas around him, his unseeing eyes fixed on the car’s ceiling.\n\nSuddenly, a brilliant light appeared above the dying man. Luke squinted against its intensity, struggling to see until the light dimmed. When it finally did, he saw that a bright red broken wheel had materialized above Levi, glowing vividly in the confined space.\n\n“Finally…” Levi whispered, staring at the light with a heartbreaking smile. He then tried to squeeze Luke’s hand to get his attention. “W-who is it? I…I can’t see.”\n\nSwallowing back his tears, the younger demigod answered, “Nemesis.”\n\n“My mother…” Levi seemed to grow paler and weaker, but it couldn’t hide the glowing happiness of being claimed after six years of silence. “Please…can you—”\n\nHe was interrupted by a violent coughing fit, blood spilling from his mouth as he struggled to catch his breath.\n\n“Of course.” Luke agreed quietly, his eyes filled with sadness, while Katherine turned her face away, hiding her tears.\n\n“It is determined.” He struggled to steady his voice, striving to give the words the weight they deserved, honoring his friend's final wish. “Nemesis. Dark-faced. Justice-spawned. Inescapable. Hail, Levi West, son of the Judge.”\n\nSmiling one final time, Levi’s eyes now sightless, he squeezed both of his friends’ hands and whispered, “Thank you.”\n\nThen, he sighed deeply, and his chest no longer rose.\n\nSilence lingered for a long time after Levi’s death, interrupted only by the soft sniffling of Luke and Kat as they gazed at their friend’s lifeless body with desolate expressions.\n\nPulling herself together, Katherine wiped her hands clean and used her arm to dry her tears. After a moment's hesitation, she gently closed Levi's empty eyes—he was so full of life just moments ago—and placed drachmas over them, as well as one on his mouth.\n\n“Come, Luke. Keep me company.” She suggested, standing up and placing a hand on his shoulder, trying to guide him toward the seat beside the driver’s.\n\nHe shook his head and gently brushed her hand away.\n\n“I’ll stay here.” Before she could voice her concern, he added, “Just…for a minute. I’ll be there in a second.”\n\nKatherine studied Luke for a moment, her concern evident in her gaze, though her own grief was well hidden behind it. After a deep sigh, she gave a reluctant nod and moved to the front of the car. With a quick motion, she started the engine, causing the vehicle to roar to life.\n\nSoon, they were back on the road.\n\nHesitating, Luke pulled his backpack closer and opened it, rummaging through its contents.\n\nWhen he found his blanket—an old, well-loved thing as old as he was—he rose on unsteady feet. He carefully draped it over Levi, his gaze lingering on his friend's face for a long while before he finally covered it completely.\n\nThen, he walked to the front and sat down next to Katherine. She gave him a fleeting look of acknowledgment but didn’t say anything—both were too stunned and emotionally raw to engage in any meaningful conversation.\n\nStill in shock, Luke rested his chin on his hand and gazed blankly out the window, his mind drifting. He had lost track of how long they had been traveling or where they were; the world outside the car blurred and shifted, barely registering in his state.\n\nJust then, a sudden sound jolted him from his daze.\n\nA loud pop echoed from beneath the mail truck, followed by a hissing noise. The vehicle shuddered, its speed dropping sharply as it began to sway. Kat, muttering curses under her breath, fought to maintain control and quickly maneuvered the car to the side of the street, parking with urgency.\n\n“Damn it! Not now!” She hissed in frustration. In a sudden fit of fury, she slammed her hands on the steering wheel, making the horn blare. Rubbing her face in exasperation, Kat turned to Luke and said, “I think the tire’s blown. I’m going to check it.” Pointing a stern finger at him, she added, “Do not leave the car under any circumstances. Am I clear?”\n\n“Crystal.” He replied, his brow furrowing at the strangeness of the situation. He watched as Kat nearly tripped while stepping out of the vehicle, swearing profusely under her breath.\n\nResting his cheek on his hand, Luke narrowed his eyes in thought as he stared at the dimly lit surroundings, waiting for the older woman to return. The only light came from a few ceiling lamps, revealing that they were in what he suspected was an underpass tunnel.\n\nWas the Hermes Express truck malfunctioning? Did his father give them a faulty car?\n\nIt seemed too bizarre to entertain that idea.\n\nWhat could Hermes possibly gain by sabotaging them like this? Luke’s success would reflect positively on his father, so undermining his quest in any way would only be counterproductive.\n\nFrowning, he also took notice that Katherine was taking way too long to come back and that the outside was eerily silent and empty—there were no cars, no people, not even one measly rat.\n\nLuke debated with himself in silence as he stared out the windows, trying to spot anything unusual. From his vantage point, however, he couldn’t see anything new—only the same weirdness he had already noticed.\n\nMaybe she was behind the truck? But that would mean he’d only see her if he stepped out, and she had given him strict instructions not to leave.\n\nHowever, his worry only deepened the longer Katherine stayed outside, intensified by the lifeless body of his childhood friend in the back of the car.\n\nWhat if she was in danger?\n\nHe couldn’t bear the thought of losing anyone else—especially not so soon.\n\nAnxiously running a hand through his hair, Luke muttered a silent apology for disobeying her.\n\nWith caution, he opened the car doors, darting his eyes around the surroundings as he did.\n\nThe area was dark and unnervingly empty. By his calculations, it wasn’t very late, and he still assumed they were in San Francisco, so there should be more cars passing by. Yet, none were in sight.\n\nHe didn’t think they had crossed a Mist barrier like the one in the Garden of the Hesperides that would transport them to a hidden mythical place; the surroundings still seemed like an ordinary mortal tunnel, just eerily deserted.\n\nNot finding anything new or his missing friend, Luke stepped out nervously. He kept one hand pressed against the car for support as he circled to the back.\n\nThere, he crouched and examined the tire, noting a single, perfect puncture. The projectile was missing, leaving him uncertain whether it was a rock—though he doubted a god’s vehicle would be damaged by a mere stone—or something else, possibly done intentionally.\n\nAnd Katherine was nowhere to be seen either.\n\nRising slowly with his gaze still fixed on the hole, Luke continued to circle the car with increased caution.\n\nIf this was done on purpose, he thought with growing distress, the culprit couldn’t have been weak.\n\nIt wasn’t an ordinary—much less a mortal—person who could damage something of divine origin.\n\nAs he reached the opposite side of the mail truck without finding her, his anxiety grew. When he turned around to retrace his steps, he was startled to see her—she hadn't been there just moments before.\n\nWith wide eyes, he stared at the woman lying on the ground, alarmed. Then, he sighed in relief when he saw her chest rising slowly.\n\nKatherine was still breathing.\n\n“She’s just sleeping.” A deep, suave voice announced, each word articulated with deliberation, like an experienced narrator capturing attention without effort.\n\nEmerging from the shadows behind Kat, a young man walked out—the same man Luke had seen earlier that day, who had filled him with terror.\n\nHe was, quite frankly, intimidating in height, slightly taller than Luke’s own father, making him a full head taller than the demigod himself.\n\nDespite his imposing stature, he appeared…friendly, with a carefully placed smile on his lips.\n\nNow that he was closer, Luke could see the god’s features in more detail. He was quite handsome—as all deities tended to be—with styled, wavy brown hair, a strong jawline, high cheekbones, a light olive complexion, and a youthful appearance, as if he had just come of age, although that was far from the truth.\n\nThough his smile was meant to be welcoming, the dim lighting cast shadows across his face, giving him an unsettling, slightly sinister look. Furthermore, Luke's inability to make out his eyes only deepened his growing sense of unease.\n\n“Now, won’t you greet me properly, mortal?” The unknown deity drawled pleasantly, sitting in an opulent office chair made of high-end leather—an out-of-place luxury that had appeared suddenly in the middle of the tunnel.\n\nStuttering slightly, Luke remained rooted to the spot, pressing his hand tightly against the Hermes Express logo. His voice came out weak and hesitant as he managed to whisper, “Good night, sir.”\n\n“I didn’t quite catch that. Perhaps you should come a little closer to offer your greetings properly.” The god suggested, his smile still fixed on his face. Though his tone was light, it sounded more like a demand to the blonde’s ears.\n\n“Good night, sir.” Luke repeated more assuredly and a little louder, but he remained rooted to his spot, wary of approaching a foreign god whose identity he still didn’t know.\n\nThe man’s expression froze for a moment as his eyes shifted to the hand pressed against the car. For a brief instant, the demigod thought he detected a chill in the deity’s demeanor, though it happened so quickly it might have simply been his imagination.\n\nBut even so, the man didn’t rise or approach Luke. Instead, he tilted his head contemplatively and hummed softly.\n\nLeaning down, the man gently twirled a lock of Katherine’s hair between his fingers, casting a sideways glance at the blonde. His smile shifted into a smirk as he asked, “Are you quite certain you wouldn’t prefer to come a little closer?”\n\nLuke’s gaze fixed on the hand resting on Katherine’s head, and without fully thinking about his words, he snarled, “Don’t you dare—”\n\nSeveral things happened in quick succession the moment Luke stepped out of reach of the mail truck: the god's smile widened unnaturally, revealing all his teeth; the demigod realized the grave mistake he had just made; and then, before he could even blink, he was slammed against the tunnel wall.\n\nGripping the hand around his throat desperately, though the hold was neither tight nor painful, Luke looked up at the god. For the first time, he saw the deity’s eyes—chestnut brown with flecks of green.\n\nThey might have seemed warm, if not for the calculating gleam and coldness behind them—a glaring lack of something essential. The way they looked at Luke held a deep sense of curiosity, though there was also a hint of…satisfaction.\n\n“Maybe I should teach you respect.” The man whispered.\n\nAs soon as he said that, the aura of the god made itself known, heavy with intent and clearly not bothering to lower its intensity for the puny mortal’s comfort at all. It seemed like an announcement, unlike those of the Greek gods he knew, who were much more careful about showing their powers to mortals.\n\nSurprisingly, he hadn't realized until this moment how much they had been holding back.\n\nThe aura slithered toward him slowly, with a certain measuring quality as if it were weighing his worth on a scale. Also, it was clearly toying with him, causing the blonde to tremble, and the effect grew more intense when it finally made contact.\n\nIt seemed to want to burrow beneath his skin, dig through him until it reached the deepest parts of his being.\n\nPain and fear brought tears to Luke’s eyes as he felt the aura gradually fill every part of him, scrutinizing everything—perhaps even seeing his soul, his flesh, everything that made him who he was.\n\nIt hurts. Its hurts. It hurts.\n\nWith a jolt, he tried to free himself, clawing blindly, but to no avail; the hand easily adjusted to hold him more firmly. Then he felt the aura retreating, taking something with it—he didn’t know what, but he knew it was his.\n\nAbruptly, it paused, then shuddered with renewed interest, as if delighted. Suddenly, the pain faded, and the sensation softened, allowing Luke to breathe again.\n\nHe hadn’t realized he had been crying so much that he was struggling for air.\n\nAlthough the aura didn’t leave at once, it rubbed against him with a different intent—not painful, nor overwhelming, but no less distressing.\n\nWhen it finally continued with its withdrawal, it didn’t release what it had taken; instead, it held it closer, as if it were a precious treasure, leaving a part of itself behind as well.\n\nThis made him squirm in discomfort.\n\n“How sweet.” The god crooned, his eyes tracking the falling tears. “You really are such a sensitive little darling.”\n\nShuddering at the god’s unsettling words, the blonde avoided eye contact and tried to gauge the distance to Katherine and his father’s car, both behind the deity.\n\nSuddenly, the god loosened his grip on Luke’s neck and, with a firm hold on his chin, tilted the demigod’s head up, forcing him to meet his gaze directly.\n\n“Now, now, isn’t it rather rude to ignore someone who’s speaking to you?” The deity chided, his tone more amused than offended, though a suppressed hint of displeasure still lingered beneath the surface.\n\n“Forgive me, sir.” Luke uttered softly, his hands trembling as he clutched the ends of his shirt.\n\nBrushing off the apology he had practically demanded, the god mused aloud, his eyes gleaming with interest, “I wonder what your father is thinking, allowing you to wander about like this.”\n\nConfused by what that could possibly mean, the blonde furrowed his brows and warily stared at the man before him. Though the god’s gaze took on a devilish edge, his smile stayed deceptively friendly.\n\nEverything about him suggested trustworthiness and warmth, but it was clear he was anything but.\n\n“Doesn’t he realize,” the man leaned in to whisper next to his ear, “that his precious little jewel might get…taken?”\n\nAlarm surged through Luke's mind.\n\nHe curled into himself, pushing against the deity’s chest with all his strength. Surprisingly, the god allowed it, leaning back as the demigod tried to create some distance.\n\nIt was as if he had been momentarily distracted; the man’s whole face twitched, his attention shifting away from Luke. A glazed look passed over his eyes before he snapped back to himself and glowered darkly at nothing, clearly profoundly irritated.\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nTurning back to the blonde, the god masked his momentarily loss of composure with a pleasant expression, as if nothing had happened. He smirked and declared, “Regrettably, that would be rather inconvenient, especially after all the effort put into separating my people from yours.”\n\nStill perplexed by the strange behavior, Luke hesitated, nervously wetting his lips as he asked, “Is that related to whatever you did to my friend?”\n\nWere his memories going to be erased? Was that what the aura had been doing before it seemed to stop for some unknown reason?\n\nAlso, this Roman god was far too creepy for his comfort, as if he were trying to mimic human behavior but missing the mark in a way that felt deeply off.\n\n“Yes.” The god replied bluntly. Tilting his head, he added, “You cannot be allowed to remember the soldiers you saved.” Stalking closer, he smiled with practiced ease and offered a hollow comfort. “It won’t hurt, or at least, it’s not meant to.” Abruptly pausing as if struck by an idea, he glanced at the demigod with a flicker of something in his brown eyes that Luke didn’t like. “But I wouldn’t be entirely opposed to an…understanding.”\n\nUnderstanding?\n\nStepping back, only to be halted by the wall behind him, Luke tried to think quickly. With a swift glance at the car, he decided to attempt a distraction, hoping to buy himself some time.\n\n“May I have the honor of knowing the Lord’s name?” He asked, attempting to inch away while still pressed against the wall.\n\nThe mail truck wasn’t far off, and he hoped the god would hesitate. After all, the deity had tried to lure him away from the vehicle instead of just taking him, so Luke was betting on the god being reluctant to step too close to it.\n\nAnd if he ran there as quickly as possible…\n\nIt reeked of desperation, but what else could he do in this situation?\n\nPausing to study Luke with a contemplative gaze, making the blonde freeze and remain as still as he could—almost as if he could become invisible—the man held the silence for a moment before breaking it with a thoughtful hum, as if considering whether divulging more would align with his interests.\n\nSmiling enigmatically, he said at last, “I could grant you this honor, but it would be far more rewarding for you to uncover it yourself. You seem capable enough.”\n\n“But how can I offer proper respect or avoid offending you without knowing your identity, sir?” Luke pressed on, daring to continue his escape attempt as the god watched him with an unchanging smile and no visible reaction.\n\nYet, his warm brown eyes were so very cold.\n\n“Why this sudden wish to please a god not of your own people, Lucas?” The deity retorted, amusement lacing his tone as he observed the demigod freeze in his attempt to flee at the mention of his name—the one his grandmother had insisted on.\n\n“How do you know that name?” The blonde asked, his voice little more than a whisper.\n\nNo one knew that name—no one except his mortal family.\n\n“I know many things.” The god drawled, gliding closer with a relaxed elegance. “For instance, I’m aware you were making a rather charming attempt to slip into that mail truck before I could catch you.”\n\nFrozen in place, Luke remained silent with wide eyes as the deity cradled his face in his hands, the gesture surprisingly tender.\n\n“Unfortunately, that strategy would inevitably fail.” The Roman continued with a sigh, a hint of mockery in his tone. His eyes glowed with power, and his aura swirled around him with such intensity that it was almost visible to the naked eye. “After all, I’m a god, mortal.”\n\nTears welled up in Luke’s eyes again.\n\nThe day had already been filled with so many tragedies, and now this god was toying with him—dangling a sliver of hope before him only to snuff it out, making it very clear that the blonde was neither powerful nor fast enough to reach it.\n\n“I’ve made my decision.” The god declared suddenly, his gaze lingering on the demigod’s face with that unsettling, intense fascination yet again. He then moved one hand, placing his fingers over Luke’s eyes, blocking his vision, while his aura wrapped around the demigod with an uncharacteristic gentleness.\n\nA moment of stillness followed before the world began to blur at the edges, fading as his vision dimmed.\n\nThrough the approaching darkness, he heard one last thing, gradually growing fainter, before he lost consciousness.\n\n“I want you to remember me, Graecus.”"
