        "text": "NOTE: This page is dedicated to both the late creator of Thomas and Friends, The Reverend W. Awdry, who passed away on March 21, 1997, and the late Michael Angelis, who passed away on May 30, 2020. They will always be really useful crew members.\n\n|Quote =\n\n\"Dear Christopher,\n\nHere is your friend Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\nHe wanted to come out of his station yard and see the world.\n\nThese stories tell you how he did it.\n\nI hope you will like them because you helped me to make them.\n\nYour Loving Daddy\n\nThomas the Tank Engine is an anthropomorphised fictional tank locomotive in the British Railway Series books by Wilbert Awdry and his son, Christopher, published from 1945. He became the most popular and famous character in the series, as well as one of the most iconic and beloved characters ever creatived, and is the titular main protagonist in the accompanying television adaptation series Thomas & Friends (aka Thomas the Tank Engine or Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends). He's a little blue engine who works on the North Western Railway. He originally worked as the station pilot at the Big Station but longed to leave his yard to go out and see the world. After helping to rescue James from a nasty accident, Thomas was rewarded with two new coaches, Annie and Clarabel, and was given the responsibility of running the Ffarquhar Branch Line, where he works to this day.\n\nCreation\n\nWhen Awdry created Thomas, the engine existed only as a wooden toy made for his son Christopher. This engine looked rather different from the character in the books and television series and carried the letters NW on its side tanks, which stood for \"No Where\" according to Awdry.\n\nThomas wasn't originally based on a prototype; rather, the initial stories were an accompaniment to the toy made for Christopher. After Awdry's wife encouraged him to publish the stories, the publisher of the second book in The Railway Series (Thomas the Tank Engine) hired an illustrator named Reginald Payne. Awdry selected a real locomotive for Payne to work from to create authenticity: a Billinton designed 0-6-0 E2 Class of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. This may have been chosen simply because Awdry had a photograph to hand.\n\nThomas as portrayed by Hornby and the TV series is based on one of six E2 class locomotives fitted with an extension to the front of the water tanks. Awdry was unsatisfied with one detail of the illustration — the fact that the front end of his running board featured a downward slope, which meant that his front and back buffers were at different levels. This was an illustrator's mistake that was perpetuated in subsequent books. The accident in \"Thomas Comes to Breakfast\" was partly devised as a means of correcting this. Thomas has always been shown with a curved running board in the television series.\n\nPayne was not credited for his illustrations at the time, and it is only since the publication of Brian Sibley's The Thomas the Tank Engine Man that he has started to receive major recognition. It had often been erroneously assumed that C. Reginald Dalby created the character, as he was responsible for illustrating books 3–11 and repainting the illustrations of books 1 and 2.\n\nAlthough Thomas locomotives are seen today on various heritage railways, the locomotives are either unpowered decoys or converted from other locomotives, as all of the prototype LB&SCR E2 class locomotives were scrapped between 1961 and 1963.\n\nWhy He's a Really Useful Engine\n\nHe is a classic British icon, much like characters such as Wallace and Gromit, Postman Pat, Bob the Builder, Fireman Sam, Peter Rabbit, Paddington Bear, Sooty, and Noddy. In fact, this character is what we call the Mickey Mouse of British children's media.\n\nWhat makes him unique is that much like characters such as Bob the Builder, he is not only famous in the United Kingdom, but he is also famous worldwide and is also one of the most iconic cartoon characters ever created apart from characters such as Mickey Mouse, SpongeBob SquarePants, Homer Simpson from The Simpsons, Pikachu from Pokémon, Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, Hello Kitty, Winnie the Pooh, Popeye, Bugs Bunny, and Tom and Jerry.\n\nHis personality trait as a tank engine who wants to see the world, but is always fussy and cheeky is quite an excellent concept put together. In both the RWS & TV series, his wish of getting his own branch line from his debut book, \"The Adventure Begins\", and season 1 had come true, but in the TV series, his other wish was to go on an adventure to go around the world in \"Big World! Big Adventures!\". Although it was established in the Railway Series, that he just wanted a branch line where he could see the world for himself.\n\nHe knows when to call out on an engine if said engine is immature or stubborn.\n\nThe line to Emily in \"Emily's Adventure\", \"That's because you're a big bossy boiler\", pokes fun at HiT Entertainment's portrayal of Emily when he was calling Emily out for her bad attitude towards Elizabeth.\n\nHis original teal-green paintwork in \"The Adventure Begins,” looks amazing.\n\nHis design is true to the original E2 classes (despite none of the E2s wearing blue in real life), and his live-action model for the TV show is beautifully made.\n\nHe's a good friend to all engines and a popular one of the Fat Controller's railway. Sure, he may be cheeky, but he can still be a good friend since he's always the optimistic, idealistic, and altruistic engine who has a heart of gold. He also does his best to help his friends and those he cares about.\n\nHis short-lived sister show called TUGS is Ten Cents, because of his cheeky, but very good-natured and hard-working personality.\n\nHis iconic friendship between him and Percy is really charming.\n\nTo add more fuel to the car, Thomas does show to look out for younger engines like Bill and Ben. This is particularly evident in later episodes and seasons, where he is more experienced and is often charged with helping newer engines out. So you could say he's like a big brother to the much younger engines.\n\nHe lives his way of being a really useful engine, and in a good way, he wants to let the other engines know that they can do the same. So you could say that he does his job playing his part very well.\n\nWhile he might drive others away, Thomas is very good at luring back friends if the situation demands it.\n\nThomas became less arrogant and self-absorbed which is a good character development which is notable in seasons 2 and 3. Even he was shown to be less arrogant and rude compared to his incarnation from the original books.\n\nEddie Glen (Thomas and the Magic Railroad), Ben Small (UK, S13-18), Martin Sherman (US, S13-18), John Hasler (UK, S19-24) and Joseph May (US, S19-24) all do great voices for Thomas in both the UK and US.\n\nIn addition, the narrators from the model series, Ringo Starr (UK, S1-2), George Carlin (US, S1-4), Michael Angelis (UK, S3-16), Alec Baldwin (US, S5-6), Michael Brandon (US, S7-16) and Mark Moraghan (a few episodes where he narrated model episodes) do amazing jobs too!\n\nHe made many friends with international engines such as Ashima, Nia, Gina, Rajiv, Yong Bao, Beau, Sam, etc.\n\nWhat also makes him feel like a likeable character is you could even relate to him too. (Aside from his first feature film)\n\nThomas is shown to be really brave as well. Like in \"Hector the Horrid\", when Hector found out the hard way that you should never frighten Rosie in front of Thomas.\n\nThomas himself, as well as the rest of the cast from the franchise, does a good job of teaching kids (and even adults) life lessons such as social and emotional skills. In fact, even autistic children can learn from Thomas and the rest of the gang.\n\nIn some cases, Thomas has demonstrated a perspective of seeing some suspicious moments going on such as the Tiger Hunters' hidden cage, Diesel 10s plans to take over the railway of steam engines with his fellow diesels and Baz and Bernie's whispering.\n\nAlthough he was flanderised in the Sharon Miller era, he was never flanderised during his show's decline throughout the Big World, Big Adventures! era and still kept his original persona during those seasons.\n\nIn addition to this, in the Andrew Brenner era of Thomas & Friends, he alongside those who got flanderised during the Miller era redeemed themselves.\n\nThomas was also likeable during the downfall of S9-S11 before he was sadly flanderised, as mentioned above.\n\nHe was also likeable in Thomas and the Magic Railroad, which was his less-than-positively-received feature film.\n\nEven during his flanderisation, there are still some episodes in seasons 12b-16 in which he is likeable and retains his original personality (e.g., \"James Works It Out\", \"Best Friends\", and \"Slippy Sodor\") among others.\n\nHis theme tune from S1-7 and \"The Adventure Begins\" hold true to his personality.\n\nThomas contributed in \"The Official BBC Children in Need\" programme in \"The Official BBC Children in Need Medley\" in 2009 and he even got his own \"Children in Need\" video in 2018.\n\nIn terms of the CGI series, his CGI models from Nitrogen Studios, Arc Productions, and Jam Filled Entertainment all look really good and stay true to the model designs from seasons 1-12.\n\nHis BWBA body design looks so realistic that it's something that Thomas would look really like, something that The Railway Series should have done in the first place, and would make anyone imagine if locomotives/engines having faces were a thing that could occur in real life.\n\n\"Cinders and Ashes\" Qualities\n\nHe got flanderized during the Sharon Miller era as he became more moronic and just plain happy all the time and in Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go when he became so much more childish and useless.\n\nThere are a handful of episodes where he is unlikeable (even before and after flanderisation), such as:\n\n“Woolly Bear\"\n\n\"Emily's New Coaches\"\n\n\"What's the Matter with Henry?\"\n\n\"Spotless Record\"\n\n\"Salty's Stormy Tale\"\n\n\"Something Fishy\"\n\n\"Thomas and the New Engine\"\n\n\"Follow That Flour\"\n\n\"Thomas' Tricky Tree\"\n\n\"Seeing the Sights\"\n\n\"Topped Off Thomas\"\n\n\"Thomas' Frosty Friend\"\n\n\"Thomas and the Big Bang\"\n\n\"Thomas in Trouble\"\n\n\"Rosie is Red\"\n\nThe version of him in the first two seasons is more sadistic compared to his version from season 3 onwards.\n\nInconsistent portrayals here and there:\n\nHe has shown to be a great singer in the CGI series through songs, but in \"Too Loud, Thomas!\", his attempts at opera come off pretty annoying.\n\nIn \"Ace's Brave Jump\", Thomas is happy to see Ace again, even though Ace convinced Thomas to play a trick on Nia while she, Ace, and even Thomas were in the United States.\n\nHe got very little screen-time in his first feature film: Thomas and the Magic Railroad, which led to the movie flopping at the box office, despite receiving divisive reception from fans anyway, but at least he was still likeable.\n\nThe way he gets angry at other engines for pulling Annie and Clarabel, after \"Emily's New Coaches\", comes off as shallow and plain mean-spirited. It was depicted as a trope by fans where another engine pulls Thomas' loyal carriages, and Thomas gets all hissy at another engine overtaking Annie and Clarabel like a spoiled brat (as shown in \"Thomas and the New Engine\").\n\nWhile a bit understandable due to the most notorious actions by some of them, he can sometimes take his dislike towards diesel engines a bit too far.\n\nLike SMG4, his newer designs in the late BWBA era, while pretty good and accurate, can look way too overly detailed to some.\n\nIn addition, his new design in the infamous All Engines Go is bad, as it makes Thomas look too young.\n\nHis prototype design thereof is even worse.\n\nWhile not bad overall, his CGI design is divisive due to being unnecessary, as there was no reason to change the model design.\n\nVideos\n\nTrivia\n\nThomas was the first character in the Railway Series to have a number. According to Brian Sibley in Thomas The Tank Engine Man, Awdry used the number one because it was the easiest to draw.\n\nThomas was the first character introduced in the television series.\n\nFrom the first to twelfth seasons during the model era, Thomas had three different facial expressions: furious, frustrated and jovial; which were not used on-screen. His unused second-season jovial face mask, however, was designed in The Great Festival Adventure game, where Thomas was teasing Gordon about being on the turntable.\n\nAlso in the tenth season episode \"Topped Off Thomas\", his unused third season enraged face was used where Thomas was arguing with Spencer about going or not going faster than the wind and later challenging him to a race to Kellsthorpe Road.\n\nSometime before or during the production of the fourth season, Thomas had an elderly face mask, created by model maker Jeremy King, which was originally made as a joke to David Mitton during the filming of Thomas and the Magic Railroad.\n\nIn the American and Finnish cast, Thomas is the only character voiced by Joseph May and Juha Varis in the series.\n\nThomas' LBSC number, 70, was actually carried by a real LB&SCR locomotive, an A1 named \"Poplar\" currently preserved by the Kent & East Sussex Railway. The number also represents the top speed of his basis and the 70th anniversary of the Railway Series. All the actual E2s, however, were only numbered from 100 to 109.\n\nAccording to Sir Topham Hatt on the 2001 version of the official website, Thomas was given his name by the engine workshop which built him.\n\nThomas is one of three characters to have a speaking role in every series and special, the other two being Henry and James.\n\nFollowing Mr. Conductor in Thomas and the Magic Railroad, Thomas became the second character to narrate in first-person.\n\nIn Calling All Engines!, Thomas sleep-whistles. This is apparently the steam engine version of snoring, though instead typical snoring sounds, Thomas makes warbling whistles after pausing before the next toot. This was only mentioned in Calling All Engines as it might be because his crew never shut off his steam properly.\n\nHe has the most nicknames of any character, with nineteen in total.\n\nThomas has the distinction of having the first speaking role in the series premiere and last line of the series finale. However, he does not have the last line in the produced series finale.\n\nHe is the first Sudrian engine with a separate driver in international locations.\n\nHe is the only vehicle character with headwear (a nightcap in the seasons 9-12 closing segments, a party hat in the ninth season episode \"Thomas' Milkshake Muddle\", an aviator pilot hat in the tenth season episode \"Sticky Toffee Thomas\" and a top hat in the same episode and the eleventh season episode \"Smoke and Mirrors\" (if one were also to count The Fat Controller's top hat in \"Topped Off Thomas\"), not counting Whiff's glasses or Darcy's visor (or the Santa caps on all the vehicles in the early Christmas episodes).\n\nThomas is the first character in the show to have lost his voice onscreen with the season 23 episode \"Too Loud, Thomas!\". With this, he is the third character on the show with a speech impediment (albeit temporarily) after Fergus and Theo.\n\nThomas is the only original member of the current Steam Team without handrails across his boiler or side tanks.\n\nTo celebrate Easter in 2017, a giant 140kg chocolate sculpture of Thomas was displayed at Kings Cross Station. Made out of real Belgian chocolate, the display piece was sculpted in 250 hours by three master chocolatiers and was surrounded by TrackMaster engines running around. An actor dressed as Sir Topham Hatt was on hand to hand out easter eggs.\n\nThomas was one of two engines featured on a poster for the NWR. The other was Gordon.\n\nCookies help us deliver our services. By using our services, you agree to our use of cookies."
