Once you arrive at Strasburg Rail Road you’ll be ready to impress the Really Useful Engine in person.\n\n1. How Was Thomas The Tank Engine First Created?\n\nThomas the Tank Engine™ started as The Railway Series, written by Reverend W. Awdry for his son Christopher. Awdry originally told The Railway stories to his son before bed until Christopher became persistent about more details and he finally took to pen and paper.\n\n2. How Old Is Thomas The Tank Engine?\n\nAwdry’s wife, Margaret, then insisted he turn his tales into books, and thus The Railway Series was born. The first book was titled “The Three Railway Engines.”\n\n“The Three Railway Engines” was originally published in May of 1945. This will mean that as of May 2024, Thomas the Tank Engine™ and Friends will be celebrating their 79th anniversary!\n\n3. Was Thomas Always Intended To Be The Main Character Of His Story?\n\nNo, Thomas was not a prominent character in the Railway series until Awdry made a model of Thomas for Christopher. The first three engines that were created (and were the main characters in “The Three Railway Engines”) by Awdry were named Edward, Gordon, and Henry.\n\nAlong with his driver, Bob, other Thomas the Tank Engine™ characters that would become popular include Percy, James, Toby, Donald, and Emily.\n\n4. Are There Any Significant Details About Thomas’ Design?\n\nThere is some significance when it comes to Thomas’ iconic blue color, as it is also the official color of the North Western Railway. Before Thomas was blue, he was originally teal green with white lining.\n\nQuestions also existed regarding the initials “NW” on the blue engine. Awdry originally claimed the “NW” on the side of Thomas represented “No Where” but as the Railway series developed, it became the North Western Railway.\n\nAs for facts about the animated television series, it has been confirmed that Thomas’ top speed is estimated to be between 30 and 40 miles per hour.\n\n5. How Much Are Thomas The Tank Engine Toys Worth?\n\nThe first Thomas products were sold in 1957 and consisted of cardboard kits for children to put together. The engines included Thomas, Percy, Gordon, and James.\n\nToday, most Thomas the Tank Engine™ character trains can be bought online from anywhere between $10-$30, but high quality, special edition, or well-kept old models of the train can go for as high as $100.\n\n6. How Long Did Thomas Awdry Write Children’s Books For?\n\nThomas Awdry retired from writing children’s fiction in 1972. By that time, he’d published 105 stories with “Tramway Engines” being his last.\n\nHis son, Christopher, went on to create three more tales including “Really Useful Engines.”\n\n7. When Did Thomas First Appear On Broadcast?\n\nThomas the Tank Engine™ & Friends made its broadcast debut in the UK in 1984. Former Beatles member, Ringo Starr, even joined the series as a storyteller for 52 episodes. The show was an instant success with more than 8.5 million viewers.\n\nThomas the Tank Engine™ & Friends would then go on to make its US debut on PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) in 1989, being similarly well-received and beloved by viewers.\n\n8. Who Narrated Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends?\n\nAlong with Ringo Starr, many more narrators told the adventures of Thomas and the other trains on the Island of Sodor to viewers.\n\nSome of these narrators include:\n\nMichael Angelis\n\nGeorge Carlin\n\nAlec Baldwin\n\nMichael Brandon\n\nPierce Brosnan\n\nMark Moraghan\n\nJohn Hasler\n\nJoseph May\n\n9.
