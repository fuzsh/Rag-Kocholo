        "text": "Thomas and the Magic Railroad is a 2000 British-American adventure fantasy film based on the British TV series Thomas and Friends, The Railway Series by Reverend Wilbert Awdry, and the American TV series Shining Time Station.\n\nThis was the first Thomas the Tank Engine feature-length movie.\n\nWhen the film was released, it received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics and fans alike due to the acting, special effects, absence of Thomas, the underdevelopment of the human cast, the movie's plot, and lack of fidelity to the source material.\n\nThe movie's budget was $19 million and grossed $19.7 million, making it a box-office bomb.\n\nPlot:\n\nSir Topham Hatt and his family have left the Island of Sodor on holiday, leaving Mr. Conductor in charge. Gordon complains that Thomas was eight seconds late. Diesel 10 races by, scaring both engines. In Shining Time, Mr. Conductor is suffering a crisis; his supply of magic gold dust is too low for him to travel back from Sodor. At Tidmouth Sheds, Diesel 10 announces his plan to rid Sodor of steam engines by destroying Lady, the lost engine. Lady had been hidden in a workshop on Muffle Mountain by her driver, Burnett Stone, after Diesel 10's previous attempt to destroy her. Lady is unable to steam despite trying all of the coals in Indian Valley. The steam engines agree to find Lady before Diesel 10, unaware that Diesel 10's sidekicks, Splatter and Dodge, are spying on them. That night, Diesel 10 approaches the shed where the steam engines are sleeping and destroys the side of it with his claw. Mr. Conductor scares Diesel 10 away by threatening to pour a bag of sugar into his fuel tanks.\n\nMr. Conductor calls his cousin, Mr. C. Junior, to help him with the gold dust crisis. That night, Percy and Thomas conclude there is a secret railway between Sodor and Shining Time. Diesel 10 tells Splatter and Dodge of his plans to destroy Lady. Toby overhears and distracts Diesel 10, who knocks one of the shed supports with his claw, which collapses the roof on top of them. The next morning, Thomas is collecting coal trucks when one of them rolls through the buffers that lead to the secret railway. Mr. Conductor is abducted by Diesel 10, who threatens to drop him off a viaduct unless he divulges the location of the buffers. Mr. Conductor cuts one of the claw's hydraulic hoses and is thrown free. He lands at the Sodor windmill, where he finds a clue to the source of the gold dust.\n\nBurnett's granddaughter Lily meets Patch, who takes her to Shining Time, where she meets Junior. Junior takes her through the Magic Railroad to Sodor, where they meet Thomas. Thomas is not happy to see Junior, but agrees to help and takes them to the windmill, where they find Mr. Conductor. Percy discovers that Splatter and Dodge have found the Sodor entrance to the Magic Railroad and goes to warn Thomas. While traveling through the Magic Railroad to take Lily home, Thomas discovers the missing coal truck. Lily goes to find Burnett, leaving Thomas stranded. Thomas rolls down the mountain and re-enters the Magic Railroad through another secret portal.\n\nBurnett explains the problem getting Lady to steam to Lily. Lily suggests using a special coal from Sodor, and Burnett uses it to start Lady. Lady takes them along the Magic Railroad. Thomas and Lily return to Sodor. Diesel 10 arrives with Splatter and Dodge, who decide to stop helping him. Diesel 10 tries to cross the viaduct, but it collapses under his weight and he falls into a barge filled with sludge.\n\nLily combines water from a wishing well and shavings from the Magic Railroad to make more gold dust. Mr. Conductor gives Junior his conductor's hat. Lily, Burnett, Patch and Mutt return to Shining Time, and Lady returns to the Magic Railroad while Thomas travels home into the sunset.\n\nWhy It Caused Confusion and Delay:\n\nFalse advertising:\n\nThe primary issue with this film, leading to its significant criticism, is the extremely misleading title. Despite Thomas being the titular character, he appears for only 11 minutes, with a mere 12% of the film dedicated to him. The narrative could easily exclude him without any impact, as it predominantly centers on the human characters, both the original ones and those from Shining Time Station, rather than on Thomas and his friends. Here's a video showing how little screen-time he gets compared to 85 minutes in the movie.\n\nOne of the trailersdepicted P.T. Boomer in the scene where Diesel 10 falls from the collapsing viaduct, but he is absent from the movie. This is because he was removed from the final cut of the film after the trailer was released.\n\nThomas's character lacks significant development, making him appear underdeveloped and hard to empathize with. Additionally, Eddie Glen's voice acting, albeit bearable, does not contribute positively to the character's portrayal.\n\nA lot like Kangaroo Jack and The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, the title character is not the main character in the movie.\n\nRegarding Thomas' friends, Edward, one of his closest companions, is notably absent from this movie. Despite a trailer showing him in a scene with Diesel, which disappointed fans since he was the first engine in The Railway Series, he is not mentioned by other characters, nor is there an in-universe explanation for his absence, effectively treating him as non-existent. This omission was due to Edward's model not being completed in time, suggesting that the movie was hastily produced.\n\nThe characters, particularly the human cast, are poorly written, underdeveloped, and lack depth. Although Mr. Conductor (portrayed by Alec Baldwin) and Junior (played by Michael E. Rodgers) deliver satisfactory performances, the remainder of the live-action cast falls short.\n\nAlthough the acting is generally good, it does have its occasional shortcomings:\n\nPeter Fonda appears quite despondent and lacks enthusiasm in nearly every scene he is in.\n\nLily, portrayed by Mara Wilson—who is more famously known for her role in the 1996 film Matilda—is a character that comes across as generic, clichéd, and unengaging. She not only overshadows Thomas but also delivers a subdued performance, often with her mouth agape. Her acting is reminiscent of Freddie Highmore's in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This role marked her departure from acting to concentrate on writing, although she has since taken on minor roles in television and web series.\n\nDidi Conn delivers a commendable performance reprising her role as Stacey Jones from Shining Time Station, despite her brief appearance. Nevertheless, during the dream sequence set in an abandoned Shining Time, Didi's delivery gives the impression she's reciting lines from a cue card attached to the camera.\n\nKevin Frank's portrayal of Henry's voice, while adequate, comes across as overly youthful and dull, rendering the character somewhat unengaging.\n\nThe voice provided by Susan Roman for James has been criticized for sounding overly feminine and not suitable for a male character. Indeed, her portrayal of James is so distinctly feminine that it overshadows the performances of Veronica Taylor and Sarah Natochenny (voices of Ash Ketchum in Pokémon), Nancy Cartwright (voice of Bart in The Simpsons), and Debi Derryberry (voice of Jimmy Neutron). Initially, Michael Angelis, the UK series narrator at the time, was chosen to voice the character, but test audiences considered him \"too old\" for the role.\n\nExecutive Meddling: The film underwent significant changes following negative feedback from test screenings, which unfortunately compromised its overall quality.\n\nP.T. Boomer was initially intended to be the film's primary antagonist. However, he was removed because test audiences deemed him too frightening for young viewers. Consequently, elements of his character were transferred over to Diesel 10, and Boomer was relegated to a cameo appearance. Similarly, Cranky was supposed to throw fruits at Diesel 10 and Splodge, but this idea was also discarded.\n\nGeorge was initially cast as one of Diesel 10's minions, with most of his scenes involving the destruction of buffers, including an attempt to destroy those linked to the magic railroad. In the film's conclusion, he was to redeem himself by using a boulder to block Splatter and Dodge. Edward was also excluded from the movie, which is controversial given that he was among the original characters introduced in the series.\n\nThe voice actor changes for Thomas and his friends, except for Lady who is voiced by Britt Allcroft, were incorrect. Despite being a UK children's series, all characters were voiced by Canadian actors. Most of the final film's voice actors were adequately suited for their roles, but James was an exception. Initially, Michael Angelis, the UK show's narrator from Seasons 3-16, was to voice him and Percy. However, due to complaints about Angelis' voice being too mature for the characters, Susan Roman and Linda Ballantyne replaced him as James and Percy, respectively. While James' final voice was criticized for sounding excessively feminine, Linda Ballantyne's portrayal of Percy is fitting, considering he is the youngest of the Steam Team.\n\nKeith Scott was initially cast as the voice of Diesel 10, but was replaced by Neil Crone after test audiences found his portrayal too intimidating for young viewers.\n\nInitially, Neil Crone voiced Diesel 10 with a rough Russian accent, but after receiving feedback that it was offensive, he switched to a New Jersey accent, which was better received for the character.\n\nPlot inconsistencies and missing details due to scenes being omitted for being \"too confusing for critics and audiences\" can be found in the \"Trivia\" section. These include the unexplained arrival of Diesel 10 on Sodor, the apparent repairs at Tidmouth Sheds, and Burnett Stone's line to P.T. Boomer in the climactic chase, \"No you won't because the magic you refused to believe in will get the better of you!\". In the final cut, this line is directed at Diesel 10, leading to a significant plot hole since Diesel 10 does believe in magic, unlike Boomer, who only believes in money. Similarly, twenty-one years later, Tentacular's backstory in RumbleRumble remains unexplained, particularly his animosity towards Rayburn.\n\nThe film is a crossover of Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends and Shining Time Station, which is a pretty interesting concept. However, the fact that Shining Time Station is not explained well and said show never aired in the UK is confusing for UK viewers. The show never aired on ITV, or even the BBC for that matter (a 1995 documentary of The Railway Series aside).\n\nMoreover, even U.S. audiences familiar with \"Shining Time Station\" might notice the show is not well represented in the film. Only three major characters from \"Shining Time Station\" appear: Stacey Jones, Mr. Conductor, and Billy Twofeathers. Didi Conn is the only original cast member to return, reprising her role as Stacey, while Alec Baldwin takes over from George Carlin as Mr. Conductor, who had previously followed Ringo Starr, and Russell Means steps in for Tom Jackson as Billy Twofeathers. The movie's station interior, though a new set, bears resemblance but is not identical to the one in the series. Apart from that, the film includes very few elements from \"Shining Time Station,\" making it almost indistinguishable from a story featuring Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends at any generic train station.\n\nIn the film, Shining Time is depicted through a mix of locations in the US, Canada, and the Isle of Man, which do not seamlessly integrate.\n\nThe editing quality is mediocre to subpar. For instance, P.T. Boomer, who was intended to be the main antagonist, is still visible in some scenes atop Diesel 10 in the form of a figurine.\n\nThe Island of Sodor is depicted through model dioramas, complete with miniature vehicles and landscapes, similar to its portrayal in Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends. However, this approach appears strikingly artificial and incongruous when the live-action characters are introduced into the setting.\n\nThe engines are depicted without drivers or firemen, who are essential for operating the engines. There is even an episode where Thomas believes he can manage without a driver, which results in him crashing into a house. Contrary to the TV series, Sodor seems to be entirely uninhabited by humans.\n\nLady, a magical engine, requires a driver to move, and that driver is Burnett Stone.\n\nBertie the Bus also has a driver inside him, but it is a model figure, which is really weird considering all the other human characters are portrayed by live actors.\n\nAlthough the musical number \"He's a Really Useful Engine\" by Hummie Mann is enjoyable, it accompanies a rather aimless montage of Thomas and his friends performing various tasks. Moreover, the song, which is ostensibly about Thomas, is somewhat deceptive as the majority of the clips feature his friends instead of him.\n\nSeveral inconsistencies exist on Sodor, including trains operating without brake-vans, Thomas frequently not working on his branch line, and Henry requiring Welsh coal, even though this issue was resolved in the series. HiT Entertainment, which took over the franchise two years post-movie release, often faces criticism for these discrepancies.\n\nJust like two other bad films, the dialogue can range from being cheesy, corny, cliché to downright clumsy, such as \"Well, my lady, the lights are all green for you now! Green for glory!\".\n\nThe understanding of the source material for both Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends and Shining Time Station is lacking, as magic is not typically featured in these shows, which aim for realism with a few exceptions.\n\nSimilarly to The Angry Birds Movie 2, several key characters from both Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends and Shining Time Station are missing.\n\nEdward, a engine from Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends, is not featured in the movie due to his model not being finished in time.\n\nOther characters, such as Duck, Donald/Douglas, Oliver, Toad, Bill/Ben, Boco, Daisy, the Narrow-Gauge Engines, Stepney, Terrence, Jem Cole, Trevor, and Mavis are also missing without explanation, giving the impression that Sodor might be almost a wasteland.\n\nMany characters from Shining Time Station are missing, including Horace Schemer, the show's standout character. This is somewhat expected, given that his actor, Brian O'Connor, retired from acting in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe scene in which Diesel 10 attempts to push Junior and James into a foundry vat at the Scrapyard is excessively dark for a Thomas and Friends movie.\n\nThe green-screen effects appear unnatural and are noticeably evident in several instances.\n\nGiven that Thomas and his friends receive minimal screen-time in this movie, with Shining Time Station occupying the bulk of it, their presence serves little purpose beyond acting as filler, with the exceptions of Thomas and Diesel 10.\n\nThis is also true for Splatter and Dodge, who appear to contribute little to the plot beyond serving as filler, instead of acting as Diesel 10's henchmen.\n\nWhile Shining Time Station occupies the majority of the screen time, it contains only a few recognizable elements from the series as outlined in BQ#5. In contrast, the movie features a greater number of familiar characters and elements from Thomas & Friends.\n\nGiven its high-budget nature, one would anticipate superior cinematography compared to the series. Yet, the movie employs the same 35mm camera that was used during the series' model era, resulting in a production that feels more akin to a low-budget, direct-to-video release than a cinematic feature.\n\nOverall, the movie had no significant impact on the Thomas & Friends franchise. Its events and most of its new characters, with the exception of Diesel 10 and Lady, were disregarded in subsequent releases. One could watch any season of the TV series, including Seasons 9-16 and 22-24, as well as the direct-to-video specials, without this film and not miss anything of importance.\n\nReally Useful Qualities\n\n\"Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle!\"\n\nAlthough Thomas's friends serve primarily as filler, the introductory scene featuring him and his friends is excellent, and their interactions are quite good despite serving as filler. Diesel 10 stands out as the most notable of the new engines. He, along with Splatter and Dodge, make for entertaining antagonists, even though Splatter and Dodge are filler and lack a defined purpose in the plot. Nevertheless, the movie proves to be an enjoyable way for children to become acquainted with Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\nThe climactic chase scene featuring Thomas, Lady, Diesel 10, and Burnett Stone is thrilling, even with the significant plot inconsistency regarding Burnett's words to Diesel 10.\n\nThis movie marked the first instance of engines being voiced by actors, a feature that was not revisited until Hero of the Rails.\n\nAlthough the acting has its mediocre moments, the overall performance and voice acting are fairly decent.\n\nThomas, Percy, and Henry’s voices are tolerable.\n\nGordon, Splatter, Dodge, Lady, Harold, Diesel 10, Bertie, Toby, Annie, and Clarabel have the best voices in the entire movie.\n\nEven Alec Baldwin had a ball working on the movie, despite his overacting. Also, Alec Baldwin’s narration as Mr. Conductor is nice and is much better than his narration for the series in Season 6.\n\nOut of all of the performances, it is safe to say that Diesel 10's voice (given by Neil Crone) is the best in the movie.\n\nBurnett Stone's backstory is quite moving and provides a compelling reason for his pervasive sadness throughout the movie.\n\nAlthough slightly incongruous and potentially misleading, the movie's poster is visually appealing and exudes a somewhat magical aura.\n\nBeautiful soundtrack composed by Hummie Mann. The one big highlight includes the cover of \"He's a Really Useful Engine\", originally composed by Mike O'Donnell and Junior Campbell.\n\nThere are some pretty funny moments here and there, such as:\n\nThe scene where Harold the Helicopter accidentally blows sneezing powder on Thomas, Splatter, and Dodge.\n\nThe scene where Mr. Conductor talks to a toy ball and a baseball bat.\n\nMany of Diesel 10's moments, especially in one scene where he wants to show everyone \"how to stop being stupid\", only for him to get his comeuppance.\n\nThe changing facial expressions on Sir Topham Hatt's office portrait when Mr. Conductor fools around by wearing his top hat for several seconds.\n\nMr. Conductor's cousin, Junior (played by Michael E. Rodgers), is a pretty funny and interesting comic relief character.\n\nAlthough only the script and a small amount of footage remain, the original director's cut is significantly better and more refined.\n\nThankfully, the lost footage scenes and shots have finally appeared in the Blu-ray version in 2020.\n\nSir Topham Hatt and Lady Hatt are mentioned and we even see a picture of Lady Hatt, taken from Season 5's \"Sir Topham Hatt's Holiday\".\n\nThe reason for Sir Topham Hatt’s absence is simple: he was away on holiday and asked Mr. Conductor to look after the railway for him.\n\nHad Britt Allcroft and her crew been given more time to work on this movie, or at the very least rewritten the movie to refocus more on Thomas and his friends than Shining Time Station by balancing the screen time between the characters of their the respective shows and adding more characters that were not included (had they delay the release date), this could've have been a moderate success with critics and at the box office.\n\nThe movie also would've been a little better if they didn't call it Thomas and the Magic Railroad, unless if elements from Shining Time Station are added. But to be fair, Shining Time Station does take up more of the screen-time more than Thomas and his friends, so it would make more sense to be called something like Shining Time Station: The Magic Railroad, which would've been a better title for this movie (because really, it focuses more on Shining Time Station rather than Thomas and his friends).\n\nOn the other hand, if they were to add more characters that were excluded from Thomas and Friends, they could've been given more screentime and it would have balanced the screen time between the characters from their respective shows.\n\nAccording to the TTTE Wiki, the movie's version of \"Really Useful Engine\" got translated into French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Indonesian, Arabic, Catalan, Czech, etc.\n\nJust like Barney's Great Adventure, some Thomas fans might enjoy this movie.\n\nThe Japanese dub is excellent, and can be found here. What's even noticeable is that Leo Morimoto (the Japanese narrator for the first to eighth series), is the narrator instead of Mr. Conductor.\n\nReception:\n\nAs of December 2015, Thomas and the Magic Railroad had an approval rating of 21% on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 67 critics, with an average rating of 3.9/10. The site's critical consensus stated: \"Kids these days demand cutting edge special effects or at least a clever plot with cute characters. This movie has neither, having lost in it's Americanization what the British originally did so right.\"\n\nMetacritic gave the film a score of 19 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\".\n\nBecause of the negative reception that Thomas and the Magic Railroad received, Lily, Burnett Stone, Patch, the rest of the Shining Time Station characters, and the Magic Railroad were never seen again.\n\nOMW gave an approval rating of 42% based on 106 users, with its critical consensus stating, \"Unoriginal and uninteresting, Thomas and the Magic Railroad offers further proof that not even the healthiest box office receipts can help a franchise from slouching towards creative extinction.\"\n\nBox Office\n\nThe film grossed $19.7 million worldwide. During it's second weekend of screening in Britain, it took in £170,000.\n\nTrivia:"
