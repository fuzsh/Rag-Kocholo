        "text": "Thomas & Friends is one of the longest running children's series in the UK (Over 60 odd years, counting the books when they were first printed)\n\nMain Article\n\nThe Steam Team\n\nThe Fat Controller/Sir Topham Hatt\n\nThe Controller of the railway, makes sure all of his engines are doing their best.\n\nA Father to His Men\n\nCatch Phrase: \"Reeeeally Useful Engine.\" and \"You have caused Confusion and Delay.\"\n\nEveryone Calls Him \"Barkeep\"\n\nLegacy Character: In the original books.\n\nMomma's Boy\n\nNice Hat: He's incredibly fond of his top hat, so much that it has slipped into Companion Cube territory.\n\nPunny Name\n\nSilence, You Fool: Whenever he is tired of the engines blurbing or whistling randomly.\n\nStern Controller\n\nSurrounded by Idiots: He keeps giving Thomas and Percy important jobs, regardless of how much he yells at them for screwing up.\n\nThomas the Tank Engine\n\nA tank engine, the main character and namesake of the series, and the first engine to be purchased for the Fat Controller's railway. Thomas spent his time shunting coaches for bigger engines, and he longed to see the world. After helping to rescue James after an accident, he was dubbed a \"Really Useful Engine\" and was given his own branch line, along with two coaches, Annie and Clarabel.\n\nAesop Amnesia\n\nAcquired Situational Narcissism: After getting his own branch line. He tamed a bit after a few Break the Haughty moments.\n\nAttention Whore: A big plot point in The Great Discovery. Played for laughs in Flash, Bang, Wallop!.\n\nBratty Half-Pint: How he started out.\n\nBreakout Character: In the original books, Thomas wasn't as heavily focused on; Awdry had plenty of other parts of Sodor to write about. However, Thomas connected with the younger audience, and when the television series was launched, he was cast as the main star. Expands into both the show and the books since the release of the former led for publishers to insist for more Thomas-centric stories from the latter to tie in.\n\nCatch Phrase: \"Fizzling Fireboxes!\" \"Cinders and ashes!\"\n\nCharacter Development (Started as a Bratty Half-Pint in season one. Then became a less bratty but more arrogant character in season 2. In season three he had matured into a really cool big brother type to Percy. Reset with season 8.)\n\nThe Hero\n\nIdiot Hero: Occasionally.\n\nJust a Kid: Thomas often gets teased by bigger engines for his small size and big ambitions. Spencer even called him a \"tiny toy tank engine\".\n\nThe Messiah: Around season 3 he grows out of being the Bratty Half-Pint and becomes this. After season 7, this snaps back.\n\nMiles Gloriosus: In season 2.\n\nNever Tell Me the Odds: Word of God states that he's always trying to do jobs best left to bigger, stronger, faster and smarter engines.\n\nPower Trio: Originally was one with Percy and Toby.\n\nSmall Name, Big Ego\n\nSpotlight-Stealing Squad: From season 8 onwards the formula for dividing the episode focus goes Three episodes about Thomas to each episode about someone else.\n\nUnsympathetic Comedy Protagonist: In his earlier stories. Later stories focused more on his altrustic qualities, though he can still be arrogant every now and then.\n\nEdward The Blue Engine\n\nThe oldest engine on the Fat Controller's railway, and the first character developed by the Rev. W. Awdry. Edward is a mixed-traffic engine with his own branch line. He's kind but firm, serving as a mentor for younger engines, though he is often teased about his age.\n\nButt Monkey\n\nCool Old Guy: In season 2, especially in Old Iron and Edward's Exploit.\n\nDemoted to Extra: In seasons 4-6. Given a bit more screentime later on, at the cost of his classic personality.\n\nFlat Character: Unlike most of the other highly flawed engines, there isn't much to Edward outside being a somewhat old and polite engine.\n\nThe Load\n\nNice Guy\n\nOut of Focus: The writers obviously don't find him very interesting.\n\nTeam Dad: To Bill and Ben.\n\nThe Spock\n\nVitrolic Best Buds: With James, especially in the HIT seasons\n\nYamato Nadeshiko: Male version.\n\nHenry The Green Engine\n\nA much larger mixed traffic engine, Henry started off as a poorly built engine bought by the Fat Controller when he was desperate for engines. He was once infamously stranded himself in a tunnel and was bricked up, until Gordon's express failed, when he came out and showed his worth. He required special Welsh coal to steam properly until his Flying Kipper accident, where he was completely rebuilt into a much more reliable engine.\n\nColor-Coded for Your Convenience: In the books, he was originally green until he got a blue coat of paint after staying in a tunnel for awhile. The reason he got his old color back is because the Rev Awdry was fed up of people confusing him with Gordon in the book illustrations, when he was painted blue.\n\nDivergent Character Evolution: In early stories he mostly played the role of another arrogant tender engine similar to Gordon and James. Later stories gave him more pitiful qualities, while the show added Hidden Depths such as his love of nature.\n\nDude, Where's My Respect?\n\nThe Eeyore\n\nEmergency Transformation: His rebuild in The Flying Kipper.\n\nFreudian Trio: Ego\n\nFriend to All Living Things: Depending on what season. Particularly Henry's Forest in Season Three.\n\nIll Guy: Until his rebuild. Oddly played up from season 8 onward, when he inexplicably requires special coal again.\n\nJaded Washout\n\nLovable Coward\n\nMid-Season Upgrade: His rebuild in The Flying Kipper.\n\nGordon The Big Engine\n\nA big, powerful express engine whose main job is to pull the railway's express. He thinks very highly of himself and is quick to criticize others, though his delusions of grandeur are often what land him into trouble.\n\nAloof Ally\n\nBerserk Button: Please don't make Gordon pull trucks.\n\nThe Big Guy\n\nBreak the Haughty: What happens in every episode centered on him.\n\nBritish Stuffiness: Particularly in the UK version\n\nCatch Phrase: \"Oh, the indignity!\" \"I'm the fastest/strongest and the best and I pull the Express!\"\n\nFreudian Trio (with James and Henry): Superego.\n\nGrumpy Bear\n\nHair-Trigger Temper\n\nJerk with a Heart of Gold\n\nLarge Ham\n\nThe Rival: To Thomas in season 1. To Spencer from season 7 onward.\n\nUpper Class Twit: In the later seasons, due to the Flanderization of his ego.\n\nJames The Red Engine\n\nA mixed traffic engine, James was riddled with issues when he first arrived, but later proved to be Really Useful by pulling the Express when Gordon failed. James can be called upon to perform virtually any duty, though he prefers coaches. Like Gordon's ego, James's vanity and admiration for his red paintwork often gets him in trouble.\n\nAesop Amnesia\n\nAttention Whore\n\nBerserk Button: Never, ever remind james of the time with the bootlace, or any other of his accidents. Also don't threaten to paint him blue.\n\nBreak the Haughty\n\nButt Monkey: Though he brings it on himself most of the time.\n\nThe Chew Toy\n\nThe Dandy: He loves his red paint.\n\nDeterminator: So much he actually has a variant of his original Leitmotif for such instances.\n\nFreudian Trio: Id\n\nGlory Seeker\n\nHey, It's That Voice!: In Thomas & The Magic Railroad he's voiced by Susan Roman who's voice is shared with lot of characters. Not least of which Champ Bear and Sailor Jupiter.\n\nJack of All Stats: As a mixed-traffic engine, James can pull either coaches or trucks.\n\nJerkass\n\nJerk with a Heart of Gold: He was somewhat less mean spirited early on, or at least felt bad when he realised the trouble he caused.\n\nMiles Gloriosus\n\nThe Rival: Had one with Gordon early on. Has a friendly rivalry with Thomas is the later seasons.\n\nPercy The Small Engine\n\nA small, cheeky green engine purchased by the Fat Controller while Gordon, James and Henry were on strike. Nobody knows where he really came from or who built him. Percy currently works on Thomas's branch line. Considered as a junior member of the Steam Team, Percy enjoys being given important jobs and is earnest and sincere.\n\nButt Monkey: He has the most accidents out of any other train in the series...and just about all of them involve getting covered in something sticky.\n\nCartoon Creature: While most other characters are based on real locomotive classes, Percy is a heavily hybridized mix of several other steam engine designs.\n\nDeterminator: Percy's Promise.\n\nThe Ditz\n\nHey, It's That Voice!: Linda Ballantyne in Thomas & The Magic Railroad.\n\nKid Appeal Character\n\nThe Lancer\n\nThe Pig Pen: He has managed to get covered in lime, chocolate, fruit pulp (twice!), mud, treacle and dirt (too many times to count.)\n\nSixth Ranger\n\nSpotlight-Stealing Squad: Especially in seasons 3, 5 and 6.\n\nPower Trio: Originally was one with Thomas and Toby.\n\nYes-Man\n\nToby The Tram Engine\n\nAn elderly tram engine, Toby is unusual as his body's made of wood and he barely resembles a typical steam engine. He once worked on his own railway with his faithful coach Henrietta, until the line was closed down. Thankfully, the Fat Controller, who had visited the railway, brought him to his railway.\n\nBig Brother Mentor: To Mavis and sometimes to Percy.\n\nCool Old Guy\n\nDemoted to Extra\n\nPower Trio: Originally was one with Thomas and Percy.\n\nThe Smart Guy: Before season 8. Although he did a pretty good Smart Guy job in the season 9 episode Emily Knows Best.\n\nEmily The Beautiful Engine\n\nA Stirling Single engine, and the only female of the Steam Team. When she first arrived on Sodor she mistakenly took Thomas's coaches, to the shock of the other Sodor engines. However, after Emily saved Thonas and Oliver from an accident and apologized, they became close friends, and she was given her own coaches.\n\nThe Chick\n\nGetting Crap Past the Radar: She has \"big wheels\".\n\nHey, It's That Voice!: Jules de Jongh, the voice of Lt Green in the New Captain Scarlet series.\n\nTsundere\n\nViolent Glaswegian: In the UK version at least, though only when her Berserk Button gets pressed.\n\nWell, Excuse Me, Princess!\n\nThe Diesels\n\nDiesel\n\nThe first diesel to visit the Island of Sodor, Diesel believes that diesels are better than steam engines, and wanted to \"revolutionize\" Sodor. He left and came back several times before becoming a permanent part of the railway.\n\nBitch in Sheep's Clothing\n\nDevil in Plain Sight\n\nJerkass: The most prominent one of the show.\n\nJerk with a Heart of Gold: The newer series has played with this in \"Diesel's Special Delivery\". Christopher Awdry's stand alone novel \"Thomas And The Evil Diesel\" also gave him a redeeming moment helping a derailed Clarabel.\n\nManipulative Bastard: In his debut, he tells jokes about the big engines to the trucks, and tells them that Duck shared them with him. Once the trucks starts laughing at the other engines, they're convinced Duck had been spreading nasty jokes about them.\n\nThis returns in Day of the Diesels: when seeing Percy distressed about Thomas hanging out with Belle instead of him, he convinces Percy to meet Diesel's friends at the Dieselworks.\n\nSmug Snake\n\nVisionary Villain: Started off as one.\n\nMavis\n\nThe Smurfette Principle: Until the movie, she and Daisy were the only female engines, neither of whom appeared very often.\n\nTeam Mom: Was this occasionally with Bill and Ben, but now plays this role with most other engines.\n\n'Arry and Bert\n\nAffably Evil: Over the years they've become less evil, but remain bullies toward the steam engines.\n\nCreepy Twins: Played this role in Stepney Gets Lost, but have been toned down later on.\n\nJerkass\n\nSingle-Minded Twins\n\nThose Two Bad Guys\n\nDiesel 10\n\nThe major antagonist of Thomas and the Magic Railroad. A large warship diesel with a mechanical claw on his roof, he was out to destroy Lady and Mr. Conductor, but was defeated thanks to Thomas. He has returned several times in the show's run, but only in the feature-length specials.\n\nAffably Evil: By the time of Day of the Diesels.\n\nBig Bad\n\nCartoon Creature\n\nDisney Villain Death: Not a death per se, but his demise is brought around by falling off a viaduct.\n\nEstablishing Character Moment: In The Movie, he roars throgh as station, kciking up dust shouting \"Get outta my way! I've unfinished business here I wanna finish it FAST!\" He also leaves Gordon, of all engines, shaking in fear.\n\nEvil Laugh\n\nFor the Evulz: dumping sneezing powder all over Tidmouth Sheds Yards has got to be this.\n\nLarge and In Charge: He is the self elected head of the diesels by Day of the Diesels, and he's a warship diesel.\n\nLarge Ham: In The Movie.\n\nObviously Evil: He has a menacing claw on his roof.\n\nSilence, You Fool: When his entourage are bickering in Day of the Diesels, he shouts them quiet. Also prominent in Thomas and The Magic Railroad.\n\nSurrounded by Idiots: Splatter and Dodge are nowhere near as intelligent as he is.\n\nVile Villain Saccharine Show: Compared to the actual series, where most of the bad guys were easily controlled by the Fat Controller, Diesel 10 in The Movie with his plans of destroying all steam engines can be seen as this.\n\nXanatos Roulette - His plans in Day of The Diesels can be considered as this, as they rely on circumstance he could have hardly picked out.\n\nSalty\n\nThe Storyteller\n\nTalk Like a Pirate: As a dockside diesel, he knows a lot of nautical slang and puts it to use.\n\nOther Diesels\n\nBig Ol' Unibrow: Norman.\n\nDifferent As Night and Day: Dennis and Norman. Norman wants to be Really Useful, but breaks down often. Meanwhile, Dennis works fine but is incredibly lazy. Dennis also has two eyebrows, while Norman has only one.\n\nHeel Face Turn: Splatter and Dodge.\n\nLazy Bum: Dennis.\n\nMinion with an F In Evil: Splatter and Dodge.\n\nNice Guy: Boco and Derek.\n\nNon-Identical Twins: Dennis and Norman.\n\nPlucky Comic Relief: Splatter and Dodge in The Movie.\n\nPut on a Bus: Dennis, who has not been in an episode since season 9, is mentioned to be Norman's twin.\n\nLong Bus Trip: Derek, who first appeared in season 5 (and wasn't even named), and was last seen in a brief cameo in Calling All Engines.\n\nQuickly-Demoted Woman: Daisy. The last episode dedicated to her was back in season 4, and she made a brief non-speaking role in season 8.\n\nThe Slacker: Dennis.\n\nThose Two Guys: Den and Dart in seasons 15 and 16.\n\nThose Two Bad Guys: Splatter and Dodge in The Movie.\n\nThe Steamworks\n\nVictor\n\nA Cuban narrow gauge engine, Victor transports parts all through the Steamworks, as well as giving orders and helping diagnose problems with engines who come in. As the only narrow gauge engine owned by the Fat Controller, Victor can sometimes leave the Steamworks to help the small engines.\n\nDark and Troubled Past: May have something to do with Luke's backstory.\n\nGadgeteer Genius\n\nNice Guy\n\nThe Smart Guy\n\nKevin the Crane\n\nA three-wheeled mobile crane and Victor's assistant. Kevin is faster than Victor at delivering parts, except Kevin is extremely clumsy.\n\nCatch Phrase: \"Slip of the hook!\" in the US, \"Slip o' me 'ook!\" in the UK.\n\nThe Ditz\n\nSodor Search and Rescue Team\n\nBelle\n\nA large tank engine with two water canons fitted on top of her tanks. Belle is the only girl of the rescue team, and the only steam engine.\n\nButch\n\nA big, strong breakdown truck.\n\nAscended Extra: He was originally meant to be a major character in season 5, but due to poor planning, he ended up only as a background extra. In season 15 he finally got an episode, Stuck on You.\n\nCatch Phrase: \"Ready for action!\"\n\nEarly-Bird Cameo: He appears briefly in the first episode of the fifth season before being introduced in the following episode.\n\nRecurring Extra: Until season 15.\n\nSuddenly Voiced: In season 15, ten seasons after his debut.\n\nWhy Do You Keep Changing Jobs?: Prior to his debut episode, he has been seen doing countless other jobs, including rebuilding Great Waterton and Tidmouth Sheds, delivering engine and windmill parts, pulling the Chinese Dragon, clearing rubble, rescuing stranded vehicles, lowering boats into the sea...\n\nCaptain\n\nA life boat who came to Sodor during the construction of the Sa RC.\n\nCatch Phrase: \"Full steam ahead!\"\n\nDemoted to Extra: He has done nothing of value since his introduction in Misty Island Rescue.\n\nFlynn\n\nA big, American red fire engine brought to Sodor based on Belle's suggestion. He has specialized wheels under his frame that allow him to travel on rails as well as the road.\n\nLarge Ham\n\nMiles Gloriosus: His own insecurities have prevented him from doing his job properly on at least two occasions. Diesel has even called him out on not doing much rescuing.\n\nHarold the Helicopter\n\nHarold is owned by the coastguard on Sodor and lived at Dryaw airfield by Thomas' Branch Line before becoming part of the Sa RC. When Harold first met Percy he stated that railways were \"slow and out-of-date\", but was proven wrong when Percy later beat him in a race.\n\nHeel Face Turn: Was something of an antagonist in his first episode, but would later help rescue Thomas in The Runaway and helped Percy in Percy's Promise, and has since been portrayed in a positive light.\n\nRocky\n\nA large, red steam crane. Rocky was thought of as \"new-fangled nonsense\" by Edward when he first arrived, but proved his worth after lifting Gordon back onto the rails after a serious accident.\n\nGentle Giant\n\nThe Leader: Something of one to the Rescue Team.

In his debut episode he's fond of claiming that there are two ways of doing things, \"the Great Western way or the wrong way\". Fortunately he got over it quite quickly.\n\nMotor Mouth: The whole plotline of \"Donald's Duck\" kicked off after Donald told him to zip it.\n\nOnly Known by Their Nickname: His given name is 'Montague,' but most call him 'Duck,' after his tendency to waddle on the rails. Henry, Gordon, and James have quacked at him in the past.\n\nDonald and Douglas, the Scottish Twins\n\nAdaptation Dye Job: In the books, they were painted blue after arriving at Sodor. With three blue engines already, the TV producers wisely decided to keep their more distinctive black paint.\n\nBonnie Scotland: Their leitmotif even has bagpipes in the background.\n\nBrother Chuck\n\nBully Hunter: Donald.\n\nNoble Fugitive\n\nSingle-Minded Twins\n\nTrigger: Do not like to talk about scrapping.\n\nTrickster Twins Notice that they are the almost the only characters labeled by name and number: Hatt specifically insisted on this after one too many Twin Switch gambits.\n\nViolent Glaswegian: \"Spite Douggie would ye? Take That!\"\n\nBill and Ben the Quarry Engines\n\nBratty Half-Pint\n\nGossipy Hens: in 'The Diseasal'\n\nSingle-Minded Twins\n\nTwin Switch: They didn't switch, just pretending that they are one engine instead of two. All they have to do is remove their names and numbers.\n\nOliver The Western Engine\n\nAcquired Situational Narcissism (In the episode Oliver Owns Up.)\n\nNoble Fugitive\n\nLady the Magic Engine\n\nA purple and gold tank engine who only appears in Thomas and the Magic Railroad and in a dream sequence in Calling All Engines. She runs the Magic Railroad that connects Shining Time to Sodor, and is the source of the Gold Dust required to keep Mr. Conductor and Sodor alive.\n\nCartoon Creature: She was designed by Britt Allcroft\n\nThe Chick: The only female engine in the film.\n\nCute Witch\n\nDark and Troubled Past: She was destroyed once by Diesel 10, and Burnett Stone kept her locked in Muffle Mountain, doing what he could to repair her.\n\nFlat Character: Despite being a major point of The Movie, not much is known about her personality at all.\n\nSpencer\n\nA private engine owned by the Duke and Duchess of Boxford, Gordon's distant cousin, and a snob that none of the Sodor engines can stand.\n\nAttention Whore: Played up in Welcome, Stafford!.\n\nBreak the Haughty: Almost every appearance of him involves this.\n\nJerkass\n\nLarge Ham\n\nLight Is Not Good: Although when compared to diesels, the steam engines are portrayed as friendly and reliable, Spencer is always portrayed in a negative light; a big-headed showoff that likes making the Sodor engines miserable. He outright reached villain status in Hero of the Rails, when he not only pestered and annoyed the Sodor engines, but also attempted to send Hiro to the smelter's yard, with no solid reason except to make Thomas miserable.\n\nNot-So-Harmless Villain: In Hero of the Rails.\n\nThe Rival: To Gordon and Thomas.\n\nSmug Snake\n\nUpper Class Twit\n\nHiro\n\nAn old, wise engine who came from Japan many years ago. He debuted in Hero of the Rails, where Thomas found him hidden away in an old forest and had his friends help repair him. He has since made several minor appearances.\n\nCool Old Guy\n\nDemoted to Extra\n\nNoble Fugitive\n\nToken Minority: An especially profitable one; Hiro proved to be a favorite in Japan almost immediately.\n\nOther Engines\n\nAnnoying Laugh: The Logging Locos.\n\nButt Monkey: Stafford.\n\nCatch Phrase:\n\nFerdinand: \"That's right!\"\n\nFergus: \"Do it right!\"\n\nScruff: \"Let's get scrunching!\"\n\nControl Freak: Fergus.\n\nEverything Is Big In Pennsylvania: Hank the American stereotype engine, who is massive, easily towering over the Sodor engines. Keep in mind that this is an example of Truth in Television, as American steam locomotives had to haul heavier cargoes over rougher terrain (often with less stops for fuel) then their smaller British counterparts.\n\nFinishing Each Other's Sentences: Bash and Dash. All the time.\n\nGenki Girl: Rosie.\n\nGentle Giant: Murdoch, Hank, and Ferdinand.\n\nIdentical Stranger: Billy (season 11) and Charlie (season 13) are the exact same prototype.\n\nNerd Glasses: Whiff.\n\nThe Pig Pen: Whiff.\n\nSingle-Minded Twins: Bash and Dash.\n\nYouthful Freckles: Rosie.\n\nThe Skarloey Railway\n\nSkarloey\n\nThe first and oldest engine on the Skarloey Railway, named after a lake at one end of the railway.\n\nCool Old Guy\n\nDepending on the Writer: Is he young or old? Brave or timid? It varies, although it's worth mentioning that he started as an old engine and was depicted as young later.\n\nDeterminator\n\nOlder Than They Look: Skarloey was built in 1864, making him 148 years old.\n\nRheneas\n\nNamed after a waterfall on the railway, Rheneas is the second engine.\n\nDeterminator (Gallant Old Engine)\n\nSir Handel/Falcon\n\nAdaptation Dye Job: The show had keep his blue paint job from when he worked with Duke, while in the books he was repainted red to match Skarloey and Rheneas.\n\nBreak the Haughty\n\nI Have Many Names: His name was Falcon before joining the Skarloey Railway.\n\nJerkass\n\nMid-Season Upgrade: His \"steamroller\" wheels.\n\nPut on a Bus: He came back though, much to the delight of the fanbase.\n\nUpper Class Twit\n\nPeter Sam/Stuart\n\nAdaptation Dye Job: Same situation as Sir Handel, except green instead of blue.\n\nAll of the Other Reindeer: His special funnel. \"Until they learned how useful it is!\"\n\nI Have Many Names: His name was Stuart before joining the Skarloey Railway.\n\nMid-Season Upgrade: His special funnel.\n\nRusty\n\nAdaptation Dye Job: Was painted dark grey in the books, but is orange on the show.\n\nDark Is Not Evil: Despite being a diesel, he is quite friendly and helpful towards the steam engines.\n\nShe's a Man In Japan: In season 9, Rusty was accidentally referred to as a girl. To be fair, in The Railway Series books, his gender was only mentioned once, and was never mentioned prior in the television series.\n\nSpotlight-Stealing Squad\n\nToken Diesel: He's the only diesel on the Skarloey Railway.\n\nDuncan\n\nAdaptation Dye Job: Was painted red in the books, but became yellow in the television series.\n\nDrives Like Crazy: One episode was dedicated to Duncan's \"Rock n' Roll\", and ends with him derailing.\n\nJerkass: At his worst.\n\nJerk with a Heart of Gold: At his best.\n\nThe Complainer Is Always Wrong\n\nViolent Glaswegian: When he loses his temper.\n\nDuke\n\nBrother Chuck\n\nCool Old Guy\n\nIntergenerational Friendship (With Sir Handel and Peter Sam, or Falcon and Stuart, as they were known back then.)\n\nNightmare Fuel Station Attendant: When he tells the story of Smudger.\n\nFearless Freddie\n\nRemember the New Guy?\n\nMighty Mac\n\nA double-ended Fairlie locomotive introduced in season 9. One end is Mighty, and the other is Mac.\n\nThe Big Guy\n\nDifferent As Night and Day: Mac is younger and more hot-headed, Mighty is older and more conservative.\n\nBody Horror: Well, as close as you'll get with a children's show about talking trains. Being an articulated Fairlie-type locomotive, both of them share the same body with each having a face at either end. They seem fine with it, though.\n\nThose Two Guys\n\nLuke\n\nAn upcoming character from Blue Mountain Mystery. He's a small, green pannier tank engine who lives at the Blue Mountain Quarry.\n\nDark and Troubled Past: He's somehow connected to an incident of an engine falling into the sea, and thinks if he's ever found, he'll be sent away from Sodor forever.\n\nShrinking Violet: When other engines try to talk to him, he scurries away into tunnels and won't come out.\n\nNon-rail Characters\n\nBertie the Bus\n\nBus Best Friend: Something of the vehicle equivelent of mixed race (or species) friendship at least.\n\nFantastic Racism: Briefly in \"Trust Thomas\" after the engines fail to get tar for his broken roads, he labels them unreliable. He takes it back completely when Thomas gets this fixed.\n\nFriendly Rival: His races with Thomas (though to prove the worth of their respective vehicles) are rather playful and in good fun.\n\nTerrence the Tractor\n\nTrevor the Traction Engine\n\nCaroline\n\nBulgy\n\nCranky the Crane\n\nGeorge\n\nElizabeth\n\nMadge\n\nColin the Crane"
