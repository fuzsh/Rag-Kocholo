        "text": "Saturday Movie Night: Railscale 2\n\nSeeing as I started this feature with the first issue of the Railscale trilogy, it only seemed fair to share the second issue next. See above to watch the programme, and see below for more details about the contents.\n\nKeep reading\n\nSaturday Movie Night: Railscale 1\n\nHere’s an idea I’ve been sitting on for ages, which I hope will become a semi-regular feature on this here blog. It’s a pretty basic idea - every week (if I remember), I share a video on here which I think you guys would be interested in seeing. Naturally, that means a lot of the videos will be to do with Thomas, or real-life railways (real and model), or anything else I decide is worth sharing.\n\nI don’t know if anyone here has heard of Phil Parker, but yes, I am basically ripping off the Saturday Film Club feature he does on his blog.\n\nYou may well remember me talking about Railscale a couple of years back. Well, since then, someone’s gone and uploaded all three issues to YouTube (see that earlier post for why there were no more). So I thought, what better way to kick off this semi-regular feature?\n\nSee above to watch the programme, and see below for more details about the contents.\n\nKeep reading\n\nThe Vicarstown Car Ferry\n\nAbove: This is not the Vicarstown car ferry train. I just needed a screenshot of a car on a train, and this was the closest I had to hand.\n\nEvery year, the Island of Sodor receives thousands of visitors from the Mainland, and obviously, the vast majority come by rail. A significant number, however, choose to arrive by car. Nowadays, this is no trouble, as they can simply drive across the Jubilee Bridge, which carries the main A950 road over the Walney Channel.\n\nThe bridge only opened in 1977, though, and any motorists arriving before then had to rely on the NWR’s services to get themselves and their cars on and off of Sodor. And thereby hangs a fascinating tale about a little-known aspect of the NWR’s history.\n\nKeep reading\n\nAnonymous asked:\n\nAny Mr. Percival headcanons?\n\nJust one, and ironically, it’s that there is no Mr Percival in my headcanon. Let me explain:\n\nWhen the TV producers finally decided to introduce a Thin Controller in Series 9, they were faced with the dilemma of what his formal name should be. Series 9 as a whole was based on events which happened in 1977 - according to my own timeline headcanon - and during that time, the Skarloey Railway’s general manager was Mr Peter Sam. Obviously that name couldn’t be used - the potential for confusion with Peter Sam the engine was too great.\n\nSo after a bit of brainstorming, he became Mr Peregrine Percival. Over time, the character evolved into an amalgamation of all the real-life Thin Controllers - in the same way that the TV producers had previously rolled up all the Fat Controllers into one.\n\nIn the ‘reality’ of my headcanon, of course, this change never happened, so the SR remains under the control of Mr Peter Sam from S9-12 (1977-80), and Mr Roger Sam from S12-onwards (1980-onwards).\n\nThe Boulder Quarry Line\n\nI recently binged the entire Classic Series again, as background noise while I was working on something else. When I got to Series 5-7, I remembered a headcanon I’d developed ages ago, to link together most of the Skarloey Railway episodes from those seasons. This recent binge spurred me to finally write it down, and bash it into something a little more coherent. Most of this is just me thinking aloud, but I thought I’d run it up the flagpole and see who salutes it…\n\n1951\n\nJust as operations are winding down at the old slate quarry at Ward Fell, new beds of good-quality slate are discovered in the hills north of Rheneas. A new quarry is established to extract this slate, and this helps to revive the Skarloey Railway’s then-declining fortunes. Even so, the surveyors who uncovered this slate are convinced there are still further treasures to be found deeper into the mountains.\n\n1950s-60s\n\nThe search for such treasures is carried out as time allows - which isn’t very often, considering all the new developments which take place on the SR during this time.\n\nRoughly 1970\n\nFinally, a discovery is made - large deposits of stone in the northern foothills of Shane Dooiney, of similar quality to that quarried at Ffarquhar. Plans are quickly devised to extract the stone, and the Skarloey Railway is tasked with building a line to the new quarry.\n\nThe proposed line branches off the Rheneas Quarry line, passes through a natural ravine known locally as Echo Pass, travels alongside the main Skarloey-Peel Godred road, and finally turns south towards the new quarry site.\n\n1970-early 1972\n\nThe line is constructed, following the route described above. When it is completed, trains start carrying building supplies to the site of the new quarry. Some trains are also laid on for the benefit of a road-building company, which is upgrading the Skarloey-Peel Godred road so that heavier vehicles can access the quarry as well.\n\nWinter 1972\n\nDue to a problem with the winch, some trucks break away on the incline at Rheneas Quarry. The breakaway tumbles into Echo Pass, triggering an avalanche which buries Skarloey, who happened to be travelling through the Pass with a supply train. He is subsequently rescued by Rusty.\n\nThese events are later loosely adapted into the episode Snow.\n\nEarly 1973\n\nThe new quarry finally opens for business, and even has a new name - Boulder Quarry, after an enormous, spherical boulder which looms ominously over part of the line. Boulder Quarry enjoys a prosperous first few months, and the Skarloey Railway enjoys the revenue boost provided by the new stone traffic.\n\nAfter a while, Rusty begins to feel nervous about the Boulder, but can’t really explain why. The others don’t take him too seriously.\n\nAutumn 1973\n\nAfter several weeks of heavy rain, Boulder Quarry is able to try out its latest acquisition - an experimental drilling machine known as Thumper. Unfortunately, the vibrations from Thumper cause the Boulder to fall off its perch, and run away down the Skarloey Valley. The Boulder causes a great deal of damage to track and property all down the valley, culminating in the destruction of some new stone-cutting sheds just outside Crovan’s Gate.\n\nAll concerned parties agree the disaster is an act of god telling them to leave that part of Sodor alone, and Boulder Quarry shuts its doors for good - financially crippled by having been forced to pay substantial compensation to every property owner in the valley.\n\nThe Skarloey Railway also ends up in dire straits - besides the damage caused by the Boulder, several years of hard work have just gone down the tubes.\n\nThe remainder of 1973\n\nThe Thin Controller decides to temporarily close the SR, so that everyone can focus their efforts on repairing all the damage to track and property. The rest of 1973 is spent doing just that.\n\nThe events of Duncan Gets Spooked take place during this clean-up operation.\n\nAt some point, the time is found to move the Boulder to a new, safer perch - on a specially-constructed plinth on a hill near to Crovan’s Gate, and positioned to face in the direction of its old perch.\n\nThat winter, during a break, the little engines tell Thomas (or more likely some other standard gauge engine) the story of Skarloey’s Avalanche.\n\n1974\n\nThe clean-up continues into 1974, and the line remains closed for the first half of that year. The Thin Controller hopes to have the line ready to reopen in time for the start of the summer operating season. Fortunately, Rheneas Quarry is closed for the two weeks before, freeing up men and engines to help. Elizabeth also happens to be working in the area, and is persuaded to lend a wheel. With all this help, the clean-up is completed in the nick of time, and the Skarloey Railway is officially declared open once more.\n\nMeanwhile, the people of Glennock decide to treat themselves to a new organ for the village school. Headmaster Hastings personally oversees the delivery of the organ. This isn’t really relevant to the Boulder saga - I just felt like mentioning it.\n\n1975\n\nBy this year ,things are more or less back to normal on the Skarloey Railway. One day, Rheneas takes a special charter train carrying a party of schoolchildren from the Mainland. On his way back down the line, he is accidentally diverted onto the abandoned line to Boulder Quarry. The line isn’t in the best condition, and wasn’t designed to carry passengers anyway, so Rheneas has a real rollercoaster ride to the Quarry and back.\n\nSince the children enjoyed themselves so much, the Thin Controller lets Rheneas off for his mishap, but it gets him thinking about the old line, and how he might be able to get his money’s worth from it after all…\n\nSurveys are carried out, and it is decided to reopen the old quarry line to serve as a connection between the SR and the Culdee Fell Railway - the latter being reached by rerouting the line in the direction of their station at Skarloey Road.\n\nThe line also passes through many areas of natural beauty, and so a number of stations are proposed to serve some of these areas. These stations include Elephant Park (above) and Rumblin Bridge (below).\n\nThe terminus of the line is at the village of Skarloey Road. So as to avoid confusion with the CFR station, the SR station is known as Upland Station. While not a direct link between the two railways, their respective stations are still a reasonably short walk away from each other.\n\nThe reconstruction of the line takes place throughout the first half of 1975, and is completed just in time for the summer operating season. Sir Topham Hatt and Lady Hatt attend the grand opening, having first viewed the new line from a hot air balloon (and then made a crash-landing in said balloon).\n\nTo finish off, here is a rough map of the original Boulder Quarry line, the subsequent Upland Extension, and how they both relate to the main SR line.\n\ncalvinandhobbescomic\n\nMy NRM Visit\n\nThe other day, me and my mum embarked on a grand adventure to the National Railway Museum. Having previously tried and failed to visit on two previous occasions, we naturally made the most of our day there. I in particular took many, many photos, and there now follows but a small sample of these:\n\nIt wouldn’t be a Tumblr post without a crab, and so we start with an LMS Crab 2-6-0 - this is in fact the first of the class, LMS #13000 (later #2700).\n\nLMS Royal Saloon #799. Originally built in 1941 as an armoured saloon for the Queen Mother, who used it to travel around the country to boost morale during the War. This saloon was used by the Royal Family right up until 1977, when the present royal train came into service.\n\nGNR J13 0-6-0ST #1247. This was the first steam engine ever to be privately purchased direct from British Railways, in 1959. Mum for scale.\n\nWaterloo Station 1967 by Terence Cuneo. Exactly what it says on the tin. As with all of Cuneo’s paintings, this one is crammed with all sorts of little details and cameos (including his trademark mouse, who is sitting on top of the Johnnie Walker advert to the right).\n\nSECR D Class 4-4-0, #737. Not a whole lot to say about this one that hasn’t been said already. I just included it here to provide context for the next photo. Speaking of which:\n\nPullman coach Topaz, with whom #737 currently shares exhibition space. Rather than the traditional chocolate-and-cream, this Pullman carries its original crimson livery, which seems to have been the inspiration for that worn by the Pullmans seen in Thomas.\n\nBR (SR) Merchant Navy 4-6-2 #35029, Ellerman Lines. As you can see, she’s been cut in half to more easily demonstrate how a steam locomotive works. Which is pretty neat, even if it does make for a rather grisly spectacle.\n\nFurness #3 0-4-0, Coppernob. Also known as that engine who used to be on display in Barrow-In-Furness, and still carries literal battle scars from a 1941 air raid on that town. Also also known as Nobby, if you’re @mean-scarlet-deceiver​ or any of their followers.\n\nLNER A4 4-6-2 #4468, Mallard. I couldn’t not take a photo of the world’s fastest steam engine (whose 126mph record was quantified by the dynamometer car just visible in the background).\n\nAnd finally, the little blue bugger himself - specifically an RG Mitchells kiddie ride from about 1994.\n\nAnonymous asked:\n\nAny particular headcanons for the Skarloey?\n\nOn the whole, not really - as far as my Thomas headcanons go, my attention has largely been focussed on the NWR as of late. However, I do have one or two stray narrow-gauge headcanons, which are as follows:\n\nThe Original #7\n\nThe SR first considered a #7 engine in the late-60s, and a number of different ideas were proposed. The proposal that got the furthest was to purchase a brand-new engine from Hunslet, to a modified version of their Eva 0-4-2T design. This would have been delivered as a kit of parts, to be assembled at Crovan’s Gate. The engine was to have been named Rowan - at the time, the Owner lived in a house called The Rowans.\n\nUnfortunately, for whatever reason, the proposals fell through at the last minute. Apparently, though, things had progressed far enough that the SR had preemptively allocated the #7 slot to Rowan. This meant that when Duke was rediscovered and brought to the SR, he was given the #8 slot. It would not be until another thirty-odd years later, when Ivo Hugh was built, that an SR engine actually carried the number 7.\n\n(Above: Coincidentally, the Talyllyn Railway also had the idea of buying an Eva themselves, but this too was shelved after they bought the engine who would become Tom Rolt. This model shows what the TR’s Eva might have looked like, bearing the name Cader Idris. Picture and model courtesy of Galveira.)\n\n(Also, one smaller headcanon about Ivo Hugh: My version of the SR has all the engines in their TVS liveries, so I’ve done what loads of other fans have done, and made Ivo Hugh purple.)\n\nThe Double Fairlies\n\nIn 1923, the Peel Godred Power Company obtained powers to build a dam and hydroelectric power plant a mile or so north of that town, and considered using the Mid Sodor Railway to transport the required building materials and equipment. The MSR realized that stronger engines would be needed for this work, and on the advice of the Ffestiniog Railway, decided that a Double Fairlie was just what they needed.\n\nTwo such engines ended up being built, as kits of parts at the FR’s own workshops, which were shipped to Sodor for final assembly at Crovan’s Gate. Little Giant was the first of the two to be completed, and he arrived at Arlesburgh by rail in 1925. Unfortunately, what with the PGPC’s decision to use the NWR’s newly-constructed Peel Godred branch line, Little Giant’s extra strength proved to be surplus to requirements, and he was sold just a couple of years later.\n\nMeanwhile, the other engine, Saint Machan (alias Mighty Mac), had just been completed when the call came through that he was no longer wanted. Crovan’s Gate decided they had to get their money’s worth somehow, and so Mighty Mac became the new works shunter, running on the site’s own internal railway system. As the Works expanded, however, it gradually became too big for Mighty Mac to cope with on his own, and by the 1970s, the size of the complex had reached a point of no return.\n\nFortunately, it just so happened that by the 1970s, traffic had increased on the Skarloey Railway to the point that another engine was sorely needed. One thing led to another, and Mighty Mac was sold to the SR in 1976. This left his old position as works shunter open for Victor (NWR #67), who arrived shortly afterwards.\n\nTroublesome Trucks be like…\n\nBonus points if whatever they’re roasting an engine about can be sung to the tune of Pop Goes the Weasel.\n\n(Seriously, read some British sports chants at some point in your life - some of them are rude AF, but they’re all fuckin golden!)\n\nThe New NWR Stocklist\n\nAs you’ll no doubt be aware, about 90% of my Thomas output on this blog concerns my interpretation of the NWR locomotive roster - be it headcanons about our famous heroes, or write-ups on my metric shit-ton of OCs. You may remember I posted a stocklist, which neatly doubled up as a hub for all those headcanons and write-ups. For the benefit of those who haven’t already see that post, I’ll briefly summarize:\n\nI’ve always thought that the NWR, as seen in both the RWS and TVS, seemed rather understaffed - only a dozen or so engines are ever seen in the former, with the latter expanding this to about 40 engines. Canonically, though, the NWR is said to have about 80 engines to its name, with the vast majority going undocumented officially.\n\nSo I took it upon myself to expand the visible fleet accordingly, deftly mixing elements from the RWS, TVS and my own ideas. Taking a leaf out of the Extended Railway Series, I limited myself to eighty steam engines, and thirty diesels, the names of which are listed under the break.\n\nKeep reading\n\nThe NWR’s ‘Dublin’ Stock\n\n(Above: One of the NWR 'Dublin’ coaches, as seen following restoration in 1973. This coach - known affectionately as 'Old Slow Coach’ - is now the only surviving example of 'Dublin Stock’ in service on the NWR.)\n\nWhen the North Western Railway was formed in 1914, it inherited many unrealised plans from its constituent companies. Some were more ambitious than others, and one of these was the Sodor & Mainland Railway’s scheme to develop the quiet fishing port of Kirk Ronan as an embarkation point for steamships sailing to and from Dublin. The S&MR had actually tried to enact these plans back in 1865, only to be met with failure. In 1919, the fledgling NWR decided to try and revive these plans, and run both a twice-daily Kirk Ronan-Dublin steamer service and a series of connecting boat trains.\n\nKeep reading\n\nmean-scarlet-deceiver\n\nfor anyone who wants a pdf copy of Awdry's The Island of Sodor: A History of Etc\n\nit's out of print, can only be bought secondhand for an arm and a leg, i don't feel bad about this. free to reblog share far and wide.\n\nAlready have this file through mysterious circumstances, but I figured this was worth signal-boosting anyway.\n\nwannabesudrian\n\nThomas Headcanons: Rebecca\n\nIn my headcanon, Rebecca is BR #34073, 249 Squadron, which in real life was left at Barry Scrapyard for about twenty years. It was later purchased for preservation in 1988, but to this day has yet to be restored (in fact, it’s been used as a source of spare parts for a couple of other Battle of Britain engines). I normally wouldn’t have chosen an engine that was already preserved, but as the real life 249 Squadron remains a kit of parts, I figured it couldn’t hurt to bend history a little.\n\nIt wasn’t until long after I decided this that I discovered that someone on the ERS team clearly had the same idea, as their character Squaddie is based on this exact engine as well. I promise the similarity was accidental on my part, but I think my version of Rebecca is different enough for me to get away with it.\n\nAnyway, this means that Rebecca originally entered service in May 1948, and so is technically a BR engine. Her working life wasn’t terribly eventful, with only the occasional moment of drama to break the monotony. One of these moments came in 1952, when she was selected to take part in trials to compare the performances of the Light Pacifics, the Merchant Navies, and the then-new Britannia locomotives. History does not state who had the most success, but Rebecca’s way with words certainly helped brighten the sour moods of the losing engines!\n\nAnother moment of drama occurred a couple of years later when Rebecca unexpectedly caught fire. This was one of the more serious issues with her design, caused by a mixture of coal dust, ash and oil saturating her boiler lagging, Fortunately, this only happened to Rebecca once, but even that was once too often.\n\nAs built, the Light Pacifics had numerous problems stemming from their unique design, and so in the late 1950s, many of them were rebuilt along more conventional lines. Rebecca had long felt insecure about many of her problems - particularly her increased tendency to wheelslip - and hoped that she might be rebuilt too. Sadly, the rebuilding programme was cut short by the onset of Modernization, and so Rebecca retained her original shape until her withdrawal from BR service in 1964.\n\nAt this point, Rebecca’s story pretty much exactly parallels that of her real-life counterpart: After being withdrawn in 1964, she was moved to Barry Scrapyard, and ended up staying there for about twenty years, before being saved by a preservation group based in Brighton. However, I’ve backdated the latter event to 1985, to allow time for her lengthy restoration, prior to arriving on Sodor in 1989.\n\nThe Brighton group originally intended to restore and operate Rebecca themselves, but within two years, they’d realized the job was bigger than they could manage - or indeed afford - and they appealed for any outside help they could get. They eventually accepted an offer from the NWR, who agreed to undertake the restoration on the condition that Rebecca was allowed to work for them.\n\nHowever, Rebecca’s restoration wasn’t carried out at Crovan’s Gate, as they were working at full capacity at the time, and didn’t have any room to spare. Instead, she was restored on the premises of the then-new heritage centre Steamtown in Carnforth, a stone’s throw from Sodor. As a result, the job ended up taking just under two years - a good chunk of which was spent arguing over what livery she should be painted in…\n\nSome believed she should be painted in an imitation of the Southern’s malachite green livery, but others argued that as she was built by BR, such a livery would be inauthentic. They instead pushed for one of the many BR liveries worn by the Light Pacifics, while further others made the case for one of the NWR’s own house colours.\n\nEventually, the question was put forward to Rebecca herself, and she surprised everyone when she asked to be painted yellow. Officially, this was because her namesake squadron had been known as the Gold Coast Squadron - unofficially, she just really liked the colour yellow.\n\nThe actual application differs from that seen in canon. Instead of a fluorescent sunshine yellow, the exact shade is more akin to the golden ochre worn by LBSCR engines. And instead of what I like to call her corporate stripes, her lining more closely matches what a real Light Pacific would have.\n\nIn 1988, the NWR had hosted a series of events to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the 1918 Armistice, among which were a series of railtours hauled by various war memorial engines. Afterwards, the point was made that the NWR had no such engine of its own, and the decision was made that because of her military name, Rebecca should have this honour.\n\nIt was only at this point that Rebecca officially became known as such. Obviously the real 249 Squadron had no connection with Sodor, and so another more local name was required. The name that met with the most favour was Rebecca Miller. The Second World War had only just broke out when Miller was made signalwoman at Tidmouth, and she quickly became famous for her expert handling of the increased traffic through the complex arrangement of lines outside the station. Sadly, Miller was killed during an air raid in April 1941, when her box was engulfed in flames after receiving a direct hit from an incendiary bomb. Her time on the NWR was brief, but her legacy was everlasting, and it was unanimously agreed that the railway’s war memorial engine should carry her name.\n\nRebecca (the engine) was still being restored in 1988, but luckily, it was determined that she would be ready by early 1989 - just in time to take part in celebrations commemorating the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of war. As it turned out, she was ready ahead of schedule, and she was pressed into NWR service to help handle a sudden surge in passenger traffic. Rebecca entered service already wearing her commemorative nameplates, but her official naming ceremony didn’t take place until that September.\n\nEven by this time, Rebecca was still sensitive about her flawed design, and still held out hope that she might be rebuilt, in order to deal with those flaws. When she entered service, however, her first crew turned out to have been trained under ex-Southern drivers, and so were fully aware of the issues with Rebecca’s design. This meant they knew just how to get the best performance out of her, in spite of her problems.\n\nRebecca was upset by this, as it meant the chances of her being rebuilt started to dwindle further and further. There was a bit of conflict between engine and crew, but Rebecca came round to them in the end, and now likes them both very much. She still sometimes thinks about how much better she’d perform with a rebuild, but she knows now that with the right crew, it doesn’t really matter how many flaws her current design has.\n\nRebecca now primarily helps Gordon with the Wild Nor’ Wester express service, but she can also be found on other fast trains - both passenger and goods. She’s even come into her own as one of the regular engines on the Midnight Goods. Rebecca is also the main motive power for a special boat train which runs between Barrow-in-Furness and Kirk Ronan, connecting with cruise liners from all over the world.\n\nBecause of her light weight, Rebecca is also capable of travelling on most of the branch lines, and can be called in at a moment’s notice to help cover shortages in motive power. However, because some lines can’t accommodate her great length, such occasions are rare.\n\nSo funnily enough my own take on Rebecca actually used the LBSCR yellow route too! Different basis for ours (34066 ‘Spitfire’), but I thought a representation of how the livery might look would be nice to see!\n\nUnaccustomed as I am to reblogging other people’s posts, I just had to share this piece of artwork by @wannabesudrian, who’s gone down the same route as I’ve done of Rebecca’s livery being a more subdued, LBSCR-esque shade of yellow than she wears in canon - seriously, this is the spitting image of what I had in mind when I first headcanoned this!"
