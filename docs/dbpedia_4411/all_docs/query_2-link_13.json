        "text": "GSVProductions\n\n5.00 star(s)\n\nJun 30, 2024\n\nVersion: 1.2\n\nWhat a splendid mod pack this is!\n\nI'd been hoping somebody would add Thomas to SRB2Kart or RR for a while now, I'd even considered picking up the torch of such a project myself, and you did an absolutely fantastic job adding him and Percy to Ring Racers!\n\nBoth of them look fantastic, the way you adapted their TVS models to the Ring Racers style is perfect and furthermore I love the voices you chose for them.\n\nBeing able to choose between George & Ringo as Thomas's voice is a really nice feature, hearing both voices in a single race is a really funny way of knowing \"There's another Thomas on the track\".\n\nAnd Percy's voice hit me like a wave of nostalgia for Old DVD menus, I love it!\n\nIf I can give one criticism it's that I noticed the [1] on Thomas's side tanks is mirrored when you can see his right side. If I was to guess why this happened it might be because you used the standard \"KC_Example\" template while making him, though this can be corrected if you use \"KC_example-asymmetrical\" instead.\n\nOne other thing, and this is less of a criticism and more of a suggestion, is the Static Side Rods.\n\nAs a stylistic choice they look great, but just so you know there is trick you can use to animate them:\n\nThere's two groups of Kart Sprites in the sprite sheets you'll find in the kartmaker example folders.\n\nThe top section of Kart sprites and then the bottom section underneath the \"Select/Wanted\" \"Select/Placing\" & \"Mini-Map Marker\" sprites.\n\nThe top section of sprites has transparent spaces on the kart wheels where the highlights should be, while the bottom section has two rows of karts with lighter and darker highlights on the wheels.\n\nThe game renders the sprites from the bottom section under the sprites from the top section and swaps between the two rows of bottom section sprites to create the animation of the wheels rolling as a character's kart moves.\n\nWith this in mind you could hypothetically leave the space where Thomas's and Percy's side rods would overlap their wheels blank/transparent in the top section of the sprite sheet and then in the bottom section of sprites include the side rods in different positions to create the effect of animated side rods.\n\nAnyhoo, with that long winded suggestion out of the way, once again let me say that this is a fantastic mod pack and it's sure to be \"really useful\" whenever my friends and I play Ring Racers together!"
