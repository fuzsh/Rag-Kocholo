        "text": "The television series Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends features many fictional people and animals who interact with the engine characters and form the basis for many of the varying storylines. The following list describes, in order of TV season number, the people and animals that have appeared. A few have appeared in more than one episode, but most appear just once. The story titles are shown in brackets after the characters name.\n\nA number of the characters originated in The Railway Series of childrens books by the Revd. W Awdry. Where appropriate, cross-links are provided to allow access to the non-TV side of the character in question.\n\nFor further information on Season 1, Season 2, etc, please see the links in the navigational box at the bottom of the page.\n\nPeople\n\nSeason 1\n\nThe Fat Controller\n\nThe Fat Controller (more formally known as Sir Topham Hatt) is in charge of all the engines on Sodor, and seemingly has a great deal of influence over other vehicles as well. He may best be described as a \"firm but fair\" leader, and is an extremely complex character. He often acts as a father-figure to the engines of Sodor - every time an engine is upset he speaks to them kindly, and he loves all his engines equally. He does not stand for any nonsense, but he is also forgiving. When an engine misbehaves, as they often do on his railway, he is willing to allow them a second chance if they are truly sorry.\n\nHe is also quite perceptive and shrewd, and is not above using elaborate schemes to get to the bottom of a problem. For example, when Diesel had been spreading rumours about Duck telling jokes about the big engines, he sent Duck to Edward's Branch line, but some time later, The Fat Controller complimented Duck for his bravery, confiding that he never truly believed Diesel's lies.\n\nHe is undeniably nostalgic, and the way he runs his railway recalls the better elements of the days of steam. Indeed, he is not afraid to get his hands dirty if it is on the footplate of a steam engine. As a young man, he learnt to drive in Elizabeth, the vintage lorry.\n\nThe Angry Policeman\n\nThe Angry Policeman is a constable in the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends TV Series. He took over the job when the old Constable retired, and he was not what Thomas expected. He was grumpy and rude, and booked Thomas for traveling along a roadside line without cow catchers or side-plates, and then argued with the Fat Controller at a country station. Soon the matter was fixed by Toby being brought to the Island to run the line instead. Toby ended up scaring this policeman once, and that's how Thomas and Toby became good friends. The policeman still works hard making sure the rules on Sodor are followed.\n\nThe Angry Policeman was seen in Season 1 in 'Thomas in Trouble', and owns a policebike.He was also seen in season 4 in the episode \"Steam Roller.\" These are his only appearances in the TV series.\n\nStephen Hatt\n\nStephen Topham Hatt lives on the Island of Sodor, and regularly has outings and holidays with his grandparents and sister. Stephen loves trains, and was excited when he first met Toby the Tram Engine. Stephen also has a bit of knowledge about the Island, of which is the reason they discovered the Old Castle and the mine (in which Bertram was found).\n\nStephen Hatt only appeared in a few Season 1 and 5 episodes, but made cameos in 'Thomas and the Tuba' and 'Thomas and the Circus'.\n\nIn the Railway Series, Stephen ultimately took the railway over, and is the current Fat Controller. However, in the television series he has always remained a child.\n\nBridget Hatt\n\nBridget Amanda Hatt lives on Sodor, and regularly goes for outings and holidays with her grandparents. On one occasion they went to Toby the Tram Engine's old line, and she thought he was an electric tram! But, apart from that, they had a wonderful holiday, and Toby enjoyed it too. Sometimes they also go to the seaside, which one time led to a hunt for an old castle and a mine, in which Toby ended up making a new friend. Bridget Hatt loves living on Sodor, and seeing the trains.\n\nBridget Hatt's full name is Bridget Amanda Hatt (her middle name being her mother's). Her parents (mentioned only in the book 'Sodor: Reading Between the Lines') are Charles and Amanda Hatt. Bridget was last featured in Season 5, but made a cameo in Thomas and the Tuba, and Thomas and the Circus in Season 8.\n\nLady Hatt\n\nLady Jane Hatt, formerly Jane Brown, helps her husband run the railway, and is happiest when she sees new lines opened, and has had some special birthday parties (but most of the time surprises occur on her birthday). She likes the railway, but had a certain dislike of Annie and Clarabel. Later, she took a liking to them, after they got new coats of paint. Although her husband runs a railway, she likes a day out on a boat or in their car.\n\nShe first appeared in Season 1, and has had a few appearances throughout the series, her last appearance (currently) being in \"Which Way Now\".\n\nSir Topham Hatt's Butler\n\nThe Fat Controller's Butler is a loyal and trustworthy butler, who answers the phone for the Fat Controller, and does many other household jobs. Sir Topham Hatt's Butler has only been featured in two stories, \"Thomas in Trouble\" (\"Thomas Breaks the Rules\" in the U.S.) in Season 1, and \"Fergus Breaks The Rules\", in Season 7, but made a good impression.\n\nJeramiah Jobling\n\nJeremiah Jobling was a passenger featured in the Railway Series story \"James and the Bootlace\", from the book James the Red Engine.\n\nJeremiah was travelling on James' train when it stopped unexpectedly between stations. On investigation, James' driver found a hole in one of the pipes that connect the brakes between the carriages. The hole caused a leak that made the brakes come on, but the driver knows he can fix it with some newspaper and a leather bootlace. Jeremiah Jobling is the only passenger with leather bootlaces, and is extremely reluctant to hand them over. However, after a heated discussion with the other passengers, he does so, and the train can continue on its journey.\n\nIn the television series adaptation (\"James and the Coaches\"), Jeremiah Jobling's name is not mentioned.\n\nMrs. Kyndley\n\nMrs. Kyndley is an elderly lady who lives on the Island of Sodor in the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends TV Series. She lives in an old cottage near Hackenback, and is best friends with Thomas and Toby. Everyday she sees Thomas, and she brightens up his day. One day, a landslide blocked the line, and she rescued Thomas from running into it by waving her red dressing gown out of her window. As a thank you, all the engines threw her a party. Mrs. Kyndley also has a sister, and a daughter who was married in Season 5.\n\nRailway Inspectors\n\nThere are many Railway Inspectors in the series. The first appeared in Season 1's Thomas Goes Fishing, in which the Inspector is called to see if he knows what is causing Thomas' troubles (the cause was fish in Thomas' boiler).\n\nOther Inspectors have featured in later episodes, such as the Season 4 episode 'Bowled Out', where his hat was sucked into the Diesel’s air intake, Season 6’s 'Harvey to the Rescue', where they watch a demonstration by Harvey before deciding if he is to stay on the railway, and Season 8’s 'Spic and Span', where they judge the cleanest engine on the Island.\n\nSeason 2\n\nJem Cole\n\nJem Cole is a person living on the Island of Sodor in the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends TV Show.

Jem Cole also has a pet goat, which caused delay for Percy, but saved Maithewaite Station. Jem Cole is a loyal and friendly vehicle enthusiast, and will always continue to help them.\n\nHe appeared both in the Railway Series and TV Series, but isn't seen much in the new seasons now. His last mentioned appearance was in 'The Refreshment Lady's Teashop', where he must have come into some money, as he was wearing a suit and a bowler hat! For the \"Bulgy\" episode of Thomas & Friends, Jem Cole becomes an angry passenger.\n\nThe Vicar of Wellsworth\n\nReverend Charles Laxely (aka the Vicar) is a fictional character who lives on the Island of Sodor on the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends TV series. He is the vicar of Wellsworth near Edward's line, and regularly sees him. One day Edward told the Vicar about Trevor the Traction Engine being scrapped, and he saved him. The Vicar also owns an Orchard, where Trevor works.\n\nThe Vicar has two sons, and regularly holds Sunday School Outings, Fetes, and Garden Parties; of which all the engines enjoy. His usual dress is black clothing with a wide-brim black hat. He also keeps bees, from which he gives honey to his friends, and caused a bit of trouble for James.\n\nThe Vicar was introduced in Season 2, and was last mentioned in Season 7. He hasn't made a direct appearance since Season 3. In The Railway Series by the Rev. W. Awdry the character of The Vicar appears in the book Edward the Blue Engine and is based on the Rev.
