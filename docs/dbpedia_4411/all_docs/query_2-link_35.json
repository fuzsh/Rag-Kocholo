        "text": "By the age of four Silas had become obsessed with Thomas. Each visit to our home in Glen Ellen included a jaunt to the local toy store with Nana and Grampa (me) to pick out a “special” Thomas character. Keep in mind these were the pre-Amazon days when people actually went to toy stores with their kids and grandkids. Even though we always told Silas that he could pick out only one Thomas-related toy, inevitably at least two pieces would come home with us after much agonizing decision-making in the toy store. And I am not even mentioning his Thomas underpants, pillow cases, and toothbrushes.\n\nDespite my grousing about being Sir Topham Hatt, I have many fond memories of our play time with those little wooden trains. That is, until I decided to share this for our blog and did some research.\n\nIt turns out that the tales of Thomas the Tank Engine may have had some sinister social and political undercurrents. An article in the Telegraph entitled “Why do so many liberal parents hate Thomas the Tank Engine?” cites reviews that lambasted the TV series for being nasty, negative and a bad example for youngsters. Another commentator wrote that “Stalin would probably have approved of Thomas, who always does what the Fat Controller tells him and strongly disapproves of other engines who step out of line.” Furthermore, “within the engine ranks, the trains enforce clear hierarchies and mirror the class rigidity of their aristocratic masters.” Yikes!\n\nI must confess that while Silas and I were play-acting on those wooden train tracks in our basement I failed to detect this subtext of social malaise. On the contrary, in retrospect I find Silas’s interpretation of Thomas’s character to be pretty much antithetical to what these critics have suggested. Rather than a pawn of the overseer, Silas’ Thomas was crafty, independent, and acted out against the authoritarian fat controller. The most fun part of our “play” time together was when Thomas (Silas) would thwart the rules and antagonize me (Topham Hatt). The fact that I never, I mean never, got to be Thomas is testimony to that.\n\nJessica Roake in her entertaining article posted on Slate, Thomas the Imperialist Tank Engine – The not-so-hidden subtexts of the popular children’s show, ends with this declaration:\n\nCast off your shackles and rise up, little engines! Down with Topham Hatt! Sodor revolution now!\n\nI’d like to point out that Silas’ version of Thomas managed to “rise up” in our basement long before she wrote those words. I hope Cal is ready for Thomas to come rolling in."
