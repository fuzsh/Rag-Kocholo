        "text": "THE topic of my column last week was about “Inventions,” which has made the whole world smaller, healthier, smarter, more comfortable, more productive, richer, and happier. Today, I am posting some more of those valuable inventions.\n\nSoap\n\nSoap originated back in ancient civilizations, including the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Egyptians, as early as 5000 years ago. Before soap was invented, people used water and mud, as exfoliants. Then, Egyptians used “natron,” a mixture of soda ash (sodium carbonate), a derivative of table salt and oils from vegetables and animals to make soap-like substance.\n\nClock – Watch\n\nPeter Henlein (1485-1542), a German locksmith and clockmaker from Nuremberg, invented the first clock in 1510, and is often credited with inventing the watch also around the same year, the first small ornamental clock that could be worn on the body, like a pendant or attached to clothing. The automatic winding watch was invented by Abraham-Louis Perrelet. The Hamilton Watch Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a watchmaker since 1946, introduced the first battery-powered electric wristwatch in 1957 (called Hamilton Electric 500), designed by Richard Arbib, an automotive designer.\n\nToilet\n\nThe modern flush toilet widely used today was invented in 1596 by Sir John Harrington, an English courtier and godson of Queen Elizabeth I. It had a 2-foot-deep oval bowl fed by water from an upstairs cistern and required 7.5 gallons of water to flush. The Queen refused to use it because it was too noisy when flushing.\n\nPencil\n\nThe modern pencil was invented by Nicholas-Jacques Conte in 1795, a scientist in the army of Napoleon Bonaparte. The process used by Conte involved roasting a mixture of water, clay, and graphite in a kiln at 1,900 degrees Fahrenheit before encasing the resulting lead in a wooden surround.\n\nLaundry machine\n\nThe first clothes washing machine was invented by a German scientist, Christian Schaffer, in 1767. Nathaniel Briggs received the first U.S. patent for a washing machine (wooden box with hand-cranked agitator) in 1797. In 1908, American engineer Alva J. Fisher invented the first electric washing machine he named “Thor” which he patented two years later. It is the “great grandparent” of our current-day laundry washer.\n\nCamera\n\nThe camera was invented by Frenchman Joseph Nicephore Niepce in 1816. He named the device heliograph and used a film made of pewter. The oldest surviving picture, taken by him in 1826 in Le Gras, France, is a landscape. Others who contributed to the invention of the camera, even as early as 1717, were: Carl Wilhelm Sche ele, a Swedish Chemist, Johan Heinrich Schulze, George Eastman, Stephen Sasson, Louis Le Prince and Johan Zahn.\n\nComputer\n\nThe first computer that resembled our modern PCs was invented between 1833 and 1871 by Charles Babbage. He devised the analytical engine and labored for nearly 40 years to improve it to be powerful enough to perform simple calculations. In Asia, a simpler calculating mechanical devise was invented in 1100 BCE, called the abacus.\n\nDishwasher\n\nJosephine Garis Cochran is credited with inventing the first commercially successful modern dishwasher in 1886, but Joel Houghton patented the first hand-powered dishwasher in the United States in 1850.\n\nToilet paper\n\nJoseph Gayetty is credited with being the inventor of modern commercially sold toilet paper in the United States, first introduced in 1857.\n\nInk pen\n\nThe first pen was actually invented by the Ancient Egyptians in 3200 BC out of bamboo or reed, dipped in ink to write. The original refillable ink fountain pen was introduced by Scottish inventor Robert William Thomson in 1849. An American lawyer, John J. Loud, invented the first ballpoint pen that he patented in 1888.\n\nTypewriter\n\nThe first practical typewriter was invented by Christopher Sholes around 1873 with U.S. Patent No. 79,265. He was responsible for the order QWERTY, which design still exists today. He helped found the Republican Party and was a two-term Wisconsin Senator. President Lincoln appointed him Customs Collector for the port in Milwaukee.\n\nVacuum cleaner\n\nHubert Cecil Booth invented the first successful vacuum cleaner in 1901. Six years later, James Murray Spangler, an asthmatic concerned about dust allergen, introduced the first domestic single-operator upright vacuum cleaner. In 1908, Willam Henrry Hoover produced the first commercial-bag-on-a stick upright cleaners.\n\nJoe Jones, of southwest Missouri, invented the first robotic vacuum cleaner he called Roomba in 1989 while working at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n\nMicrowave\n\nAmerican electrical engineer Percy Spencer developed and patented the first microwave oven in 1945. His first one was about 6 feet in height and weighed more than 750 pounds. The smaller version became popular in the 1970s. By 1986, about one in four households owned a microwave oven. In 1997, 90 percent of American homes had a microwave, becoming a $10.8 billion market industry in 2022, projected to rise to $16.47 billion by 2031.\n\nGPS\n\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) was invented in 1973 by Bradford Parkinson, from Madison, Wisconsin. He was born on February 16, 1935, and is an American engineer, a graduate of MIT, a retired United States Air Force Colonel, and Emeritus Professor at Stanford University. The yearly benefit of GPS to the world is estimated by a recent U.S. study “to be 37 to 74 billion dollars, excluding many of the applications, such as saving lives, that were difficult to quantify.” Enabling people around the world to navigate daily is empowerment by itself.\n\nLuggage on wheels\n\nThe first commercial rolling suitcase was invented by Bernard D. Sadow, a former vice president of a Massachusetts luggage company, in 1972, after seeing a porter used wheeled luggage rack to move luggage while Sadow was travelling in Puerto Rico two years earlier.\n\nAlexa\n\nJeff Bezos conceptualized Amazon’s Alexa in 2011 as a talking device that is voice-controlled. Actually it is Willaim Tunstall-Pedoe who is considered the “Father of Alexa,” who built an anagram algorithm used by Dan Brown for the Da Vinci Code. Rohit Prasad, an Amazon AI scientist, introduced generalized intelligence and multimodal AI for Alexa.\n\nBluetooth\n\nJaap Haartsen of Hague, Netherlands, led the invention of Bluetooth wireless technology, which allows a seemingly endless array of devices to wirelessly connect and communicate over short distances. Amazingly, the beautiful and famous actress in the 1940s, Hedy Lamar, unbeknownst to many, “was a gifted inventor. The technologies she co-invented laid the foundation for future communication systems, like GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFi.”\n\n* * *\n\nThe main objective of this column is to educate and inspire people live a healthier lifestyle to prevent illnesses and disabilities and achieve a happier and more productive life.
