He initially ran Thomas' branch line on the Ffarquhar Branch Line before transferring to being a station pilot at the big station.\n\nPercy in Thomas & Friends[edit]\n\nPercy is best known for his major appearance as a deuteragonist and Thomas' best friend in the Thomas & Friends television series, making his first appearance in the Series 1 episode \"Trouble in the Shed\" in the same manner as in Troublesome Engines. Throughout the series, he is consistently known for pulling the nighttime mail train.\n\nPercy in Thomas and the Magic Railroad[edit]\n\nPercy is a major supporting character in the 2000 film Thomas and the Magic Railroad, in which he is voiced by female actress Linda Ballantyne.[lower-alpha 1][3]\n\nPercy in All Engines Go[edit]\n\nPercy is a recurring main character in the 2021 reboot series, Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go. Percy is portrayed as one of the younger characters, often acting shy and nervous.\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nReferences[edit]"
