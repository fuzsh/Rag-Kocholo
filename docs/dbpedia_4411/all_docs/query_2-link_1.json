        "text": "For other uses, see Percy (disambiguation).\n\nPercy the Small Engine is the eleventh book of The Railway Series.\n\nForeword\n\nDear Christopher, and Giles, and Peter, and Clive,\n\nThank you for writing to ask for a book about Percy. He is still cheeky, and we were afraid (the Fat Controller and I) that if he had a book to himself, it might make him cheekier than ever, and that would never do!\n\nBut Percy has been such a Really Useful Engine that we both think he deserves a book. Here it is.\n\nThe Author\n\nStories\n\nPercy and the Signal\n\nAfter playing jokes on Gordon and James, Percy decides to stay out of their way for a while, but when he is asked to take a train to Knapford he gets careless and goes over to tell them. Seizing their chance, they tell him about \"backing signals\", and as he stops for the signal outside Knapford, he is convinced that he is waiting for a \"backing signal\". He ends up making a fool of himself, and Gordon sees the whole episode.\n\nDuck Takes Charge\n\nThe Fat Controller is getting a new engine to help Percy, but Gordon and James tell Percy that if he worked harder they would not need one. Percy, cross, works all day and is exhausted, but is happy when the new engine, Montague, known as Duck for his \"waddle\", arrives. They have a happy day together, but then Henry, Gordon and James order them about. Percy and Duck, in retaliation, block the entrance to the sheds. The Fat Controller comes and tells all five engines off. Percy is sent to work at Knapford, and Duck manages the workload alone.\n\nPercy and Harold\n\nOne day at the airfield, Percy meets a noisy helicopter, Harold, who says railways are slow and out-of-date. Percy, furious, is later taking some trucks to Knapford Harbour when he sees Harold in the air and decides to race him. At the harbour, Percy thinks he has lost, but his fireman sees Harold looking for a place to land. In congratulations, his crew and the workmen sing a song about the race.\n\nPercy's Promise\n\nThomas is busy and asks Percy to take the Vicar and his Sunday School's children home from the Beach. Percy agrees, but it starts to rain heavily as it is time to leave. Percy stops in front of a flooded paddock, but cannot go back, as a bridge has collapsed. As he crosses the paddock, water sloshes into his fire and he stops. Percy struggles on, fuelled by floorboards from Clarabel. After Harold drops some supplies for them, unfortunately landing on Percy's boiler, they make it to safety, and the Fat Controller congratulates the two.\n\nCharacters\n\nLocations\n\nTrivia\n\nThis book was originally going to be titled \"Percy the Polite Engine,\" per advice from Clive Holland, one of Awdry's correspondents. The title was changed due to Percy being mischievous in the first two stories.[1]\n\nThis was the final book of a few things:\n\nThe final book to be illustrated by C. Reginald Dalby, as the Rev. W. Awdry remarked that Percy looked like \"a green caterpillar with red stripes\" in the illustrations. Offended, Dalby refused to illustrate any further entries in the series. The comment on Percy's appearance would be later referenced in Tramway Engines.\n\nThe final book narrated by Johnny Morris.\n\nPercy's Promise is based on a real event where a train was stranded in five feet of water near Hunstanton, Norfolk, England, and the crew got the train into Hunstanton by using the floorboards of the guard's van.\n\nIt is also the only story from this book not to be adapted into the second series, while the events of this story were mentioned in the episode, Percy Takes the Plunge, from the next book, which was adapted before Percy's Promise.\n\nIllustrations from Percy and Harold and Percy's Promise were recreated for the 1986 single cover of Oh L'amour, a song by English synthpop duo Erasure.\n\nEric Marriott's (the editor of The Railway Series) name appears on a building at Tidmouth Harbour in the second illustration of Duck Takes Charge.\n\nThe events of Percy and the Signal took place in 1949, while the other stories took place in 1955.\n\nThis is the only appearance of Duck and Harold in the Dalby illustrations.\n\nScenes from \"Percy and Harold\" were recreated for twentieth series episode \"Letters to Santa\", with the setting following closer to the original story.\n\nGoofs\n\nThe electric pole by the single track shed in Percy and the Signal disappears.\n\nThe workmen in the first illustration are dramatically out of perspective.\n\nIn Duck Takes Charge:\n\nPercy has no Head lamps/codes.\n\nIn the respective fourth and fifth illustrations, Duck has the \"Ordinary Passenger\"/\"Branch Line Passenger\" and \"Express Goods\"/\"Cattle\" codes instead of the \"Light Engine\" one.\n\nIn the sixth illustration, Duck appears to be taller than Henry.\n\nIn the seventh illustration, Duck is a much lighter shade of green.\n\nDuck is depicted as a GWR 64xx class rather than a GWR 57xx class as his basis.\n\nIn Percy and Harold:\n\nExcluding the fourth and sixth illustrations, Percy's headlamp/code is \"fast goods\" instead of \"Mineral\".\n\nIn the third illustration, Toby is missing his front coupling and is painted in his old livery.\n\nIn the final illustration, Percy's fireman is dramatically out of perspective.\n\nIn Percy's Promise:\n\nThomas and Percy's headcodes are incorrect in all of the illustrations, except the second.\n\nAnnie or Clarabel is missing her face.\n\nIn Other Languages"
