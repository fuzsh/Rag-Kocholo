        "meta_description": "by Matt Brown, Special to the Bulletin\nThe Bulletin asked some of the Academy’s leaders a few questions regarding what goes into getting the most of the Annual Meeting & OTO EXPO. They were kind enough to share what works for them and what doesn’t. Here’s what they had to say:\nLiana Puscas, MD\nAmerican Medical Association (AMA) Delegation Chair Liana Puscas, MD, said the best thing to do before attending the meeting is to look through the courses being offered, decide what looks interesting, and make sure to sign up early.\n“The popular sessions tend to sell out,” she said. “I certainly plan my meeting by picking out specific sessions and themes. In terms of mornings, which are free, I think it is important to go through and choose the themes you are interested in to organize your experience and I think you need to do a bit of preparation.”\nDr. Puscas said it is also important not to miss the advance registration deadline.\n“If you know you are going to the meeting, go ahead and sign up, because the difference between the two options is pretty significant…there is a substantial difference in savings—so if you know you’re going to go, you should just sign up,” she said.\nDr. Puscas said planning ahead is key to having a great meeting.\n“There is a lot of great stuff in the program and you have to decide what you want to experience,” she said. “People should also look at the activities that are available in the city the meeting is in. So when you are planning your travel, add a few days to your schedule that will allow you to enjoy that city. That adds to the overall experience and allows you to mix in some fun with all of that work.”\n\nLauren Zaretsky, MD\nLauren Zaretsky, MD, chair, Ethics Committee, said the first thing she does prior to the annual meeting every year is join the Millennium Society.\n“It is one of the highlights of the meeting to be able to catch up with people from around the country,” she said. “The Millennium lounge adds to the whole annual meeting experience. It is the place you can catch up with everybody you haven’t seen since last year.”\nIn preparation for the annual meeting, Dr. Zaretsky said she likes to review the whole calendar, look at all of the instruction courses and presentations and make sure to highlight the things she is interested in. From there, she said she coordinates those items with all of the committee meetings she needs to attend.\n“I usually go through multiple times—sometimes by topic—but I usually look for the new courses so I am able to get a flavor of the new information out there,” she said. “I do the same with miniseminars, incorporating things that are new into my schedule.”\n“I use the Bulletin program in conjunction with the website and whittle it down, then I merge everything together, all the while making sure I keep in mind there needs to be time to catch up with colleagues,” Dr. Zaretsky said. “I also stay as close to the convention center as possible, which means I try to register as early as possible so I avoid all the running back and forth.”\nDr. Zaretsky said she also makes dinner plans with colleagues months in advance.\n“I have to make sure I have my dinner plans arranged well ahead of time because the people I want to make sure to see are generally in high demand and this is the only opportunity to see many of them each year,” she said. “I’m also looking forward to going to Washington, DC, because it is such a terrific city, so I need to figure those plans out ahead of time, too.”\n\nDuane J. Taylor, MD\nDiversity Committee Chair Duane J. Taylor, MD, said he gets the most out of the annual meeting by planning ahead.\n“I also look for the courses and miniseminars that interest me most and provide a variety of perspectives on evaluation and management of otolaryngologic disorders,” he said.\nDr. Taylor said the annual meeting also offers the opportunity for face-to-face question-and-answer opportunities, and dialogue with colleagues.\n“I would also encourage Bulletin readers to take the opportunity when attending the meeting to find out firsthand about the Academy’s various committees and leadership opportunities,” he said. “Most of the committees are open and you can get a flavor for what it might be like to be a part of a particular group that interests you.”\nDr. Taylor said he would encourage members who have been to “more than a few” meetings to make sure they attend some course, meeting, or seminar that is different from what they have attended before.\n“Our Academy has so many things to offer attendees at the annual meeting,” he said. “Take the time while you are at the meeting to find out about them. Lastly, enjoy the collegiality of known colleagues, take the time to meet new ones, and interact with the residents, because they appreciate it.”",
