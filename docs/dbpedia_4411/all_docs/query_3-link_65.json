        "text": "YANBU. They are really mean spirited stories. And the TV series is so PONDEROUS even with the new moving faces.\n\nI am heartily glad DS1 loves trains but has always been utterly ambivalent about Thomas.\n\nNow Fireman Sam.... that's another matter.\n\ni can't stand thomas. teh ex wanted to buy thomas stuff for ds for his birthday i talked him out of it. he does like to watch it but we have no thomas books or dvd's. i am not sure why i dislike it so much, seems very dated. i am not keen on noddy either and would be quite happy if the goblins were not caught out for once. luckily ds loves gruffalo and so do i :o\n\nMy Auntie has bought him the whole set in a box. They look very lovely. Luckily he's not overly bothered with watching it on TV, and is more obsessed with dressing up as spiderman and batman, but I hate reading him such horrible stories at bed time. I would hide them, but he's not stupid.\n\nThere are Rosie and Mavis (who works at the quarry) who are female trains. But yes, the stories are slit-your-wrists-awful. My rule is that if he watches them on telly, he doesn't get a THTE story at bedtime. He watches a lot of Thomas telly :o\n\nThere's a really horrible story where James is being repainted and the undercoat is pink. All the other engines laugh at him and ridicule him and he is publicly humiliated. So horrible.\n\nGod the tv series makes me want to fall asleep. Its the same story everytime and the setting/environment is so boring and plain. And then Ringo's voice just makes me want to pull the TV over on myself.\n\nNo sorry YABU. My DS is 9 now but was a Thomas Tank obsessive when younger and I only have to hear the theme tune to feel nostalgic for when DS was 3 and not badgering me to play 12 rated computer games or asking when he can have his own mobile .\n\nI love Thomas, Thomas and the Magic Railroad, have the book of complete stories, the dvds, the plates... it's not the DCs who love him/it.... it's me. I'm currently eating my tea off the Thomas plate and everybody knows not to use it...\n\nThat bloody music that came on at the beginning and end of every episode drove me nuts when DS was little, especially when there were countless episodes on one video and DS wanted it on 24/7!\n\nPersonally I've got a bit of a crush on Postman Pat.\n\nChill out, peeps, it doesn't last long. DS1 was massively into Thomas. We indulged it, taking him to the Day Out With Thomas stuff, doing his bedroom out, building the train sets etc etc. He LOVED it. Even in Reception, when he took a Thomas magazine with his photo in it for Show And Tell. Then he started getting told it was babyish and grew out of it pretty quick!\n\nNow he's year 2, it's bloody Star Wars.....constantly.\n\nI was a cinema usher when TATMR came out. Because it was a children's film, the usher had to stay in the auditorium in case of emergencies.\n\nOne week, 7 days and 3 had matinee shows as well.\n\nI'm surprised I stayed sane."
