Elections in Malaysia are held at both the national and state levels to select representatives for the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives) and State Legislative Assemblies. The ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, has been in power since independence and typically wins a majority of seats due to advantages from controlling state resources and regulations that limit opposition activities. While elections are generally conducted fairly, the national election commission lacks independence as the government dominates its appointment process. The main opposition parties have struggled to gain majorities needed to control parliament despite being able to contest elections and voters being able to freely choose candidates.",
