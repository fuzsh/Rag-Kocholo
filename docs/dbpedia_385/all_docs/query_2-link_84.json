        "text": "Even before its scheduled launch in Penang tomorrow, a new book on Gerakan has run into controversy.\n\nMCPX\n\nA Gerakan leader, who is unhappy with the contents, has turned to the courts for an injunction to stop the launch from taking place and to prevent the book from hitting the shelves.\n\nChia Loong Thye, who lost in his bid for the Tanjong Bungah state seat in the March 8 polls, claimed that the book titled Non-sectarian politics in Malaysia: The case of Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia contained defamatory words against him.\n\nChia, who is the younger brother of Gerakan secretary-general Kwang Chye, served a letter of demand on the two authors – Khoo Kay Peng and Dr Neil Khor – last Friday.\n\nThe authors, the book’s printer and publishing firm were named as the defendants.\n\nThe injunction application will be heard by Justice Abdul Wahab Patail hours before the launch at the Kuala Lumpur High Court tomorrow morning.\n\nLawyers representing both parties have been told to be present, according to Khor’s lawyer Daphne Choy when contacted.\n\n‘Safe’ seat offer\n\nAccording to a copy of the two-page letter made available to Malaysiakini, Chia took offence over a sentence from the 186-page book which cast aspersions on his and his brother’s characters.\n\nThe authors penned that Kwang Chye’s credibility “took a severe beating” when his younger brother was nominated to contest in a “safe” seat during the general election.\n\nThe letter of demand stated that the controversial wordings constitute a serious charge done without any foundation or basis against Loong Thye and caused him “serious damage and injury.”\n\n“Our client has always conducted himself with integrity and uprightness,” read the letter issued through leading law firm Lee Hishammuddin Allen & Gledhill. Loong Thye (left) is one of the firm’s partners.\n\nThe letter added that the continued publication of the book will cause Loong Thye “even more irreparable damage particularly to his reputation, profession and career.”\n\nThe letter demanded for a full retraction of the wordings, an apology, withdrawal of the book from circulation or to call in copies which have been already distributed. It also demanded for the cancellation of the book’s launch and asked for an unspecified sum in compensation.\n\nThe letter stated that Loong Thye will consider taking the necessary steps if the demands are not met.\n\nContacted this afternoon, the politician declined to comment on his letter of demand, saying that he will leave it to his lawyers to handle the matter.\n\nIn the March 8 polls, Loong Thye who made his election debut lost to DAP candidate Teh Yee Cheu by 1,935 votes.\n\nTanjong Bungah is one of the four state seats under the Bukit Bendera parliamentary constituency, where Kwang Chye (left) contested and was defeated by DAP newcomer Liew Chin Tong with a whopping 16,112-vote majority.\n\nPreviously, both these seats were Gerakan strongholds.\n\nAgainst public interest\n\nIn a reply to the letter of demand on Monday, author Khoo contended that the disputed wordings are not defamatory and declined to comply to the demands.\n\n“The said words, when read in the context of the book, are merely a statement by our client […] on the perception or feeling by some over the nomination of (Loong Thye) for the seat of Tanjong Bungah,” read the reply issued through his counsel Messrs Douglas Yee.\n\nHe also argued that the wordings are a minor part of the book and that the attempt to prevent the book launch was against public interest.\n\nThe book, which provides insights into Gerakan’s operations is scheduled to be launched by party leader Dr Toh Kin Woon, academician and author Dr Ooi Kee Beng and social activist Anwar Fazal at a hotel in Penang at 4pm tomorrow.\n\nThe launch will be followed by a forum to discuss the topic of the book.\n\nWhen contacted, Khoo – who is also the former head of Gerakan think-tank Sedar – said he was disappointed with the attempt to prevent the book launch.\n\n“The forum however will proceed as scheduled regardless of whether an injunction is granted,” he said.\n\nHospital Pusrawi said today that its medical officer Dr Mohamed Osman Abdul Hamid did not conduct a sodomy-related examination on Mohd Saiful Bukhari Azlan.\n\nMCPX\n\nThe hospital revealed that Mohamed Osman, a Burmese national, is not a specialist but only a general practitioner stationed at the Emergency Unit.\n\nIn a five-paragraph statement distributed to reporters, the hospital’s general manager Wan Mahmood Wan Yaacob also said that it has not released any official reports pertaining to the case.\n\nAlso present was hospital’s medical director Kamaruddin Ahmad.\n\nAfter examining Saiful, Wan Mahmood said, the doctor advised the patient to undergo an examination by a specialist at a government hospital.\n\n“There were no further examinations carried out (on Saiful at Pusrawi) in relation to the sodomy complaint,” he added.\n\nKamaruddin said the doctor who examined Saiful was not a specialist.\n\n“He is not qualified to make any conclusions on sodomy,” he said.\n\nWan Mahmood added that the examination was related to Saiful’s complaint of having pain in the anus when passing motion.\n\nAccording to the leaked medical report, Saiful has apparently told the doctor he was allegedly assaulted with a piece of plastic being inserted into his anus.\n\nHospital Pusrawi was thrust into the limelight following media reports on the findings of the doctor who examined Saiful on June 28, hours before he filed a police report accusing opposition stalwart Anwar Ibrahim of sodomising him.\n\nIn his report, the doctor allegedly found no evidence of sodomy.\n\nLooks same, content same too\n\nQuizzed on the authenticity of the report leaked to the media, Wan Mahmud replied: “(It) looks the same, contents are the same.”\n\n“It looks genuine,” added Kamaruddin.\n\nKamaruddin also said that efforts to contact Mohamed has failed as he was on leave and was expected to be back next Monday.\n\nHe revealed that he last spoke to Mohamed two weeks ago. He also added that they had discussed about the the police questioning Mohamed.\n\n“He was not detained by the police and the police were nice to him,” he stressed.\n\nBoth Wan Mahmood (photo, right) and Kamaruddin (photo, left) had no doubts on Mohamed’s credibility as a doctor, and added that he was a “good” doctor.\n\nBelow are excerpts from the question-and-answer session with Wan Mahmood and Kamaruddin:\n\nQ : Are the reports circulating in the net false?\n\nDoctor (Mohamed Osman) did not conduct a thorough check-up (for sodomy) – that’s under house rules. We have yet to verify the contents of the medical report. We have established an internal investigation group to verify if the contents of the original report are similar with the one that has been circulating around. We deny that Pusrawi has issued the report to any party.\n\nWhere is Dr Mohamed Osman now? Are you in contact with him?\n\nDr Mohamed Osman, he is on leave. No, not at the moment. We don’t know where he is.\n\nDo you know why he went on leave? When did he go on leave?\n\nOn Friday.\n\nAs your press release states that the doctor did not perform a check-up for sodomy, what check up did he conduct? Did the doctor have a look at Saiful’s anus?\n\nSaiful complained of anus pains so we did what is standard procedure.\n\n(Did Saiful complain of) tummy ache or anus pain?\n\nFirst, he complaint of tummy ache then he said that he had some pain in his anus.\n\nIn the report, it is stated that Saiful had not experienced any bleeding in his stool.\n\nI am not sure of that.\n\nHow was the circulating report leaked? What actions will be taken?\n\nThat is what we are investigating now. God willing, we will find out how the report was leaked. Appropriate action will be taken. We will consult with our legal team on the next course of action.\n\nThe investigation is set up first to see if the leaked report is the same as the original and secondly, we would investigate who possibly could have leaked it.\n\nIf you have not been in contact with the doctor, how do you know that the doctor did not conduct a medical check-up for sodomy?\n\nWe based our decision on the medical report he wrote.\n\nSo are there two different reports? Are they (the report that is circulating) the same (as the original)?\n\nIt is the same report.\n\nYou do have the original report, so is it (the copy that is circulating) the genuine report?\n\nI cannot say if it is the genuine unless someone confirms, the committee. Maybe, maybe not. It looks the same but it is not the original copy, that is with me.\n\nLooks the same but it is not the same because we have the original copy.\n\nSo the report that was leaked is not from Pusrawi? Even if the letterhead is the same?\n\nYes, we deny that (leaking it). Not officially from us.\n\nAre the contents the same? It is the original copy from Pusrawi?\n\nYes.\n\nDid you talk to the doctor before he went on leave? When was the last time you spoke to him? What did you speak to him about?\n\nI can’t remember, maybe two weeks ago. We just spoke about what happened about the Saiful’s case. The police questioning him (Dr Mohamed Osman).The police were nice to him.\n\nDid Dr Mohamed Osman check Saiful?\n\nThe doctor’s name is on the report.\n\nWhen will you get the results of the (internal) investigation?\n\nI think in about a week.\n\nIs there a more detailed report than the one that is circulating?\n\nNone, I don’t think so.\n\nBut there were no signs of sodomy.\n\nThe doctor advised the patient to go to a government hospital, HKL.\n\n‘TRO sodomy’ was written in the medical report’s in bracket, does that mean sodomy had occurred?\n\nI am not sure what is written in the bracket.\n\nCan you tell us a little about the doctor? His credentials?\n\nHe is qualified. He has been in Malaysia for 10 years. He has been with us since January.\n\nHe (Saiful) was not examined for sodomy, but (how come) the doctor said that there was no signs of sodomy.\n\nHe came complaining of pain in the anus, so that’s a part of the routine, you look for pus, bleeding.\n\nHow is this different from an actual sodomy check-up?\n\nHe came complaining of anus pain not complaining of sodomy. So the doctor performed a check-up for anus pain not sodomy.\n\nWhat led the doctor TRO (to rule out) sodomy? Why?\n\nBecause Saiful mentioned that he was sodomised. Sodomy check-up has to be done by a specialist not a medical officer. You need a gut specialist. We don’t have one in Pusrawi.\n\nDoes that mean that Dr Mohamed Osman is not qualified to make any conclusions?\n\nHe is not qualified to make any statements, any conclusions (with regards to sodomy).\n\nDoes the hospital stand by the medical report signed by Dr Mohamed?\n\nI have not seen the report anyway.\n\nYou have spoken to Dr Mohamed who has confirmed that he examined Saiful and confirmed that he has signed this medical report, why is the hospital still not convinced that it is the genuine medical report? Why is it taking so long to match the copy with the original copy?\n\nWe just realised this. When? Two days ago. It is just like VK Lingam said, “It looks like me, sounds like me but it is not me”.\n\nHave you been in contact with him?\n\nNo.\n\nHow is the medical check-up for sodomy issued? Is it just an external check-up or an internal check-up?\n\nI can’t answer that, I am not an expert on that division. We usually advice these police cases to go to general hospitals.\n\nYou are not disputing whether the medical report is real. You are disputing if Dr Mohamed has the qualifications to ascertain that (sodomy had occurred). Basically you are discrediting your own medical staff?\n\nNo, but not when concerning this case. Is he suspended? No, he is on leave.\n\nWhen is he expected to come back?\n\nHe is to return to work on Monday. He joined us in January 2008. We have tried but we cannot reach him, he is not contactable.\n\nDo you think he’ll be back?\n\nHe is a good doctor but his examination is not conducive on sodomy.\n\nIf the contents of the reports are the same are you acknowledging that the report could have been from Pusrawi?\n\nIt could have been. It is the same.\n\nThere are two different writing on the medical report.\n\nYes, there are two different. The patient arrived to see a doctor, and he meet with a female doctor first. After he complained of his anus pain, than he was passed on to a male doctor (Dr Mohamed).\n\nWas that person who leaked (the report) paid?\n\nAnything is possible.\n\nIs this the first time Saiful has seek medical check-up at Pusrawi?\n\nYes, it was his first time according to our reports.\n\nIs Pusrawi’s ethics been compromised?\n\nWe can give assurance that our ethics are protected but this is a high-profile case.\n\nWatch a 3-min video of Pusrawi’s press conference"
