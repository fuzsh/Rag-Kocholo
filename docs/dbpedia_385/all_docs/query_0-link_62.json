        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR – The rumour mill continues to churn over purported attempts to remove Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, five months after the formation of the unity government.\n\nTalks within the political sphere are that there is now a fresh plot to unseat the prime minister that could involve the forcing of by-elections.\n\nUnder the current anti-party hopping law, any MP who resigns or ceases to be a member of their party will lose their seat in the Dewan Rakyat, triggering a by-election.\n\nIt is understood that some Barisan Nasional (BN) MPs are currently being wooed by certain key individuals and persuaded to take part in a “do-or-die mission” to quit their party and sacrifice their seats.\n\nWord on the street is that they would then seek re-election under the opposition banner.\n\nIt comes as Perikatan Nasional (PN) appears resigned to the fact that it is unlikely to convince the Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi-led BN to withdraw en masse the coalition’s support for Anwar and form a new government together with parties from Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nThis is going by the firm commitment given by the Umno leadership to the prime minister, with key instigators like Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein and Khairy Jamaluddin even facing disciplinary actions for their incessant criticism of the decision to work with Pakatan Harapan (PH).\n\nIn view of this, PN leaders are said to have no alternative in their bid to attempt a coup other than by convincing disgruntled BN lawmakers to make the switch, with plans also supposedly in place to get parties from East Malaysia to join.\n\nFor the record, even if PN obtains the backing of all MPs other than those from PH and BN, it would still be two short of securing a simple majority of 112 – this means the coalition would still require the support of at least a few BN lawmakers.\n\nRogue MPs among those being targeted\n\nA source familiar with the matter told The Vibes that the purported plan is being manoeuvred and supported by PN chairman Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and other coalition bigwigs.\n\nHowever, with Bersatu’s accounts frozen and many of its leaders under investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, it appears that Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad and his trusted lieutenant Tun Daim Zainuddin are being looked upon to engineer and fund the exodus of support from the unity government.\n\nDr Mahathir has been vocally critical of Anwar’s administration, and had recently openly urged the Malays to reject the PKR president, accusing his one-time deputy of being behind the cancellation of the Malay Proclamation programme.\n\nThe extent of their involvement in the alleged scheme, however, remains unclear at the moment.\n\nMeanwhile, an insider told The Vibes that at least a dozen BN lawmakers are said to be currently eyed to take part in the grand plan to bring down the government.\n\nAmong them are the 10 MPs who had previously signed statutory declarations backing Muhyiddin as their prime minister candidate after last year’s general election.\n\nThey include Umno’s Hishammuddin, Datuk Seri Hasni Mohammad, and Datuk Seri Jalaluddin Alias; MCA’s Datuk Seri Wee Ka Siong and Datuk Seri Wee Jeck Seng; and MIC’s Datuk Seri M. Saravanan.\n\n“I understand there are already talks with some of the MPs, but I’m not sure how far negotiations have gone, or if there is any progress,” said the insider.\n\nThe source also expressed doubt that Sabah and Sarawak MPs would back Muhyiddin as prime minister and cause the collapse of the current administration, going by the commitment they have given to the unity government and their desire to see stability.\n\n“Supporting PN, without the full backing of BN, would then make little sense to the Borneo parties as there will be instability due to the small majority.”\n\nSabah and Sarawak voters have been vociferous against any government that includes PAS and its brand of Islam that is perceived as radical and divisive.\n\nPlot may not sit well with royal households\n\nUniversiti Malaya’s Assoc Prof Awang Azman Awang Pawi said if the rumours turn out to be true, it reeks of irresponsibility and disrespect, particularly as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong has decreed for all parties to support the current government.\n\nIt is believed the Malay rulers would be uncomfortable with any party that behaves belligerently towards the royal institution, as was apparent following the Agong’s decision to give the leadership to Anwar – who had Umno and the Borneo bloc’s support – instead of Muhyiddin.\n\nThat PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang had openly defied the Terengganu sultan by preaching during Friday prayers despite a decree that politicians must not deliver speeches in mosques also did not do PN any favours.\n\nAwang Azman said rather than continuously attempting to topple the administration, the opposition should instead focus its attention on better quality debates based on facts and figures, and assist the government in resolving issues concerning the rakyat.\n\n“I take that this speculation stemmed from those with political ambitions of being in Putrajaya. It’s not wrong to have hope, but it must not be to the point of causing uncertainty, including to the rakyat and investors.\n\n“The fact that Anwar also shares a very good relationship with the Malay rulers sends a clear signal that those who intend to unseat him should think more rationally.”\n\nThe academician also warned that should any BN lawmakers quit their party and trigger a by-election, there is a high chance they would lose as a direct result of voter frustration.\n\nAnother observer, who requested anonymity, similarly warned of protest votes should they be forced to cast their ballot once again.\n\nIn this regard, he said PN would have little reason to push through with its purported plan, and advised the opposition coalition to wrest Putrajaya in the next general election instead.\n\nRumours of PN attempting to dethrone Anwar as prime minister have surfaced since the PH chairman was appointed prime minister last November, and have continued since."
