        "text": "Human rights has been acknowledged as one of the essential characteristics of good governance. Abuse of human rights is strongly associated with bad governance, which is believed by many to be a serious impediment to development and sustainable growth. Despite the active participations of Islamic movements in many parts of the political world, very little is known of their involvement in advocating human rights issues as part of their struggle for power. Nevertheless, as an Islamic movement and an Islamic revivalism actor in Malaysia, Pertubuhan Jamaah Islah Malaysia (JIM) has shown otherwise. JIM has resembled a different attitude towards the issue of human rights that they believe as an integrated and pertinent composition of good governance. By scrutinising their political activities and discourse since 2000, it becomes clear that JIM has been actively engaged in good governance and human rights issues, especially those that relate to the political rights of citizens through its ...\n\nThe Paris Principles resolution in the United Nations General Assembly, the National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) are non-binding but considered highly important in guiding human rights practices in individual countries. In light of the Paris principles this study of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam) focuses on how and to what extent Suhakam has played its role, performed its tasks, and contributed to the promotion and protection of the human rights of Malaysia’s Orang Asli, and on factors affecting its performance in promoting and protecting the rights of the community. The findings revealed Suhakam’s slow and less effective measures as the main reasons for the little protection of the rights of the Orang Asli . There were grey areas that Suhakam had not addressed effectively including representation of the Orang Asli within Suhakam and in other agencies, and discriminations on religious grounds and formal education. In conclusion, Suhakam would have to go beyond its ‘postman’ role to that of bringing real and desired change for the benefit of the Orang Asli. Keywords: human rights, National Human Rights Institutions, Orang Asli, Paris Principles, promotion and protection of rights, Suhakam"
