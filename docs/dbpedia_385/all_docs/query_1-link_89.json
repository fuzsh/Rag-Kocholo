        "text": "Almost the same people have been running our FAM all these years, with little results to show. In fact, our position has worsened.\n\nOn the FIFA world rankings, Malaysia is ranked 164 out of 209 countries. Even Maldives, Bangladesh, Hong Kong and two other countries which I can’t even locate on the map – Tajiskistan and Faroe Islands – rank higher than us.\n\nMore painful, Singapore is ranked 162 and that’s a tiny country with hardly enough fields for the kids to play football.\n\nIt’s a disgrace really. Even that is an understatement. Malaysia is so short of football heroes that we have to keep reminding ourselves of the greatness of Soh Chin Aun, Mokhtar Dahari and Santokh Singh, with RTM having to pathetically repeat those grainy black-and-white visuals of these heroes playing.\n\nHalf of the people in Malaysia were not even born when these football legends were in their prime. So our kids simply have no connection with them.\n\nWe cannot live in the past but, unfortunately, we are not producing enough good players today, let alone heroes. We may have some good ones but none of them are outstanding.\n\nMalaysians have a hard time remembering the names of our national players. When there is nothing to shout about, we just don’t bother. That’s a fact.\n\nIt’s like Arsenal, of which I am a big fan. I am still trying to memorise the names of the present Gunners.\n\nWhy blame the Gooners, as we diehard fans are called, as these new players are shooting blanks in the club’s worst season ever. None of the Gunners, except maybe for Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere, is worthy of mention. That, painful as it may sound, is almost identical to the problems affecting the national team.\n\nAt least in the English Premier League, we have heard of football managers getting sacked and even chief executive officers of these football clubs, some of which are listed on the stock exchange, getting the boot. But the FAM line-up is practically invincible.\n\nNobody wants to leave the FAM nor take responsibility for the fiasco in Malaysian football, presumably because the perks are too good to give up.\n\nThere is a clear lack of fresh input to spark the fire to give Malaysian football a fresh start. In modern social media terms, FAM needs a re-boot.\n\nBut few dare to criticise the FAM leadership because of the powerful figures involved. Those directly in the game, players or officials, do not want to earn the wrath of these well-connected figures, who can make lives miserable for those who dare to speak up.\n\nClinging on to their posts, it would seem to most Malaysians that they have now become more dictatorial. Even the slightest criticism, which would hardly raise the eyebrows of most Malaysians, can lead to harsh punishment.\n\nThe latest to feel the heat is national coach Datuk K. Rajagopal, who is being hauled up under Article 88 of the FAM statutes. The coach’s comment on the lack of local strikers in the M-League was construed as a criticism of the national league. So what if it is a criticism of the national league? And since when has it become a crime to criticise the horrific affairs of the FAM?\n\nRajagopal was said to have made the comment at a post-game match press conference after the national team suffered a 4-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in a friendly at the Shah Alam Stadium on March 17.\n\nThe controversy has become even more interesting with FAM general secretary Datuk Azzuddin Ahmad now saying it could be part of a conspiracy to kick Rajagopal out.\n\nHe was quoted as saying that Rajagopal’s statement was published in the media and, under the regulations, the disciplinary committee has to investigate and decide, saying the “FAM practises transparency and that is why we decided to proceed with the charge against Rajagopal”.\n\nBut many Malaysian football fans are going to laugh when FAM talks about transparency and accountability.\n\nWe all feel passionate about football because it is one game that brings all of us together in a nation that is badly divided politically.\n\nIf only our FAM officials spend as much time putting their energy and resources together to revive our Malaysian team instead of looking through the newspapers daily, worrying over statements made by officials.\n\nStop kicking Rajagopal and the Malaysian fans around. We have had enough of the gross incompetence of the FAM.\n\nNOBODY would have imagined that Bayan Lepas – which is now full of factories, houses and shopping centres — used to be the rice bowl of Penang, just one big padi field stretching as far as the eye can see.\n\nThese padi fields used to be on both sides of the main road, and the network of irrigation canals provided youngsters like us plenty of opportunities to fish and catch frogs.\n\nThe fish were not for the dinner table, but were mainly common guppies and the occasional fighting fish, which found their way into our home aquariums.\n\nBack then, a number of pre-war bunkers could be seen scattered among the padi fields. There is one remaining along the road in Relau now, not far from the Bayan Lepas main road, but most people pass it by without knowing it is there.\n\nIn Batu Maung, where a war museum has been set up, visitors can now see the underground tunnels, ammunition bunkers and ventilation shafts set up by the British army in their futile attempt to fight the Japanese invaders.\n\nFor older Penangites who remember Bayan Lepas as an isolated rural setting, its transformation into a major urban hub, starting with the setting up of the Free Trade Zone, must have been quite phenomenal.\n\nAs a child, I always looked forward to my trips to the Bayan Lepas airport to see a relative off. Those were the days when you could still see the passengers up close from the viewing gallery as they walked towards the planes.\n\nOther than that, Bayan Lepas was not really a place a city boy like me would head to — it was simply a faraway place as far as we were concerned.\n\nBut I still recalled those days when we would be put onto chartered buses for the traditional round-the-island trip as part of the year-end programmes.\n\nBayan Lepas, Relau and Balik Pulau — regarded as spots on the other side of the island — were usually compulsory stops along the way.\n\nThe 163-year-old Snake Temple was of course one of the main attractions as was the Tunku Abdul Rahman Aquarium, located at the Fisheries Department off Jalan Gelugor. In fact, Jalan Akuarium remains as testimony to the existence of the first public aquarium in the country.\n\nWhile the Snake Temple remains a major tourist attraction, the aquarium in that locality has since been closed down and the National Aquarium at Zoo Negara now bears the same name in honour of the country’s first Prime Minister.\n\nAnother aquarium, the Penang Aquarium, has since been set up in Batu Maung by the Fisheries Department as part of its research centre and is drawing visitors as well.\n\nAccording to reports, the name Bayan Lepas means “the parakeet has flown away.”\n\nThe folklore has it that a wealthy Sumatran family had arrived by boat at the coast of Bayan Lepas in the late 19th century and as they reached the shore, their pet parakeet flew off.\n\nAnother story has it that Bayan Lepas was named after Raja Bayan or Nakhoda Bayan, said to be a prince from Minangkabau.\n\nHe was said to have settled in Penang in the 1700s, when Penang was still part of Kedah, and that he was appointed to be a headman by the Sultan of Kedah.\n\nBut there was one man who changed the entire face of Bayan Lepas. After Gerakan, then an opposition party, swept into power in the 1969 general election, Chief Minister Dr Lim Chong Eu rolled out his economic plans.\n\nHe created the Bayan Lepas Free Trade Zone to enable foreign investors to open factories, mostly assembly plants, in Penang, to resolve the high unemployment rate in the state.\n\nWith attractive options, including pioneer tax status, multinational electronic giants descended on the island, paving the way for Penang to be known as the Silicon Valley of the East.\n\nIt would not be wrong to say that Dr Lim’s masterplan of turning the padi fields into one big industrial area helped propel Penang’s economy, especially after its free port status had been taken away.\n\nThe Free Trade Zone created thousands of job opportunities for people from all walks of life.\n\nBut some things will never change. Just a little distance from the Penang International Airport is the old town of Bayan Lepas.\n\nPre-war houses still line both sides of the main road while the police station and market, built in 1930, have remained.\n\nEach time I return to Penang, I would make an effort to eat at the Cargas Café, which serves one of the best nasi campur Melayu on the island. The fried chicken and sting ray curry – the signature dishes of the restaurant – are simply delicious.\n\nThe seafood porridge in Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah is also a local favourite.\n\nAnother important icon in Bayan Lepas which has personal bearing for me is The Star’s Northern Hub.\n\nFor those of us who began our Star careers in the earlier offices, either in Weld Quay or Pitt Street, the Star Northern Hub is truly a different office altogether.\n\nOut of this five-storey building in Sungai Tiram, Bayan Lepas, the Star is printed for distribution in Penang and throughout the northern region.\n\nBecause of its size, the building feels “spacious” compared to the town office, but it has all the latest trimmings of the complete media hub.\n\nEach time I am back in Penang, I will drop in at the Northern Hub to touch base with our team there. And, without fail, my colleagues will always invite me out for a meal nearby.\n\nMany people, including Penangites themselves, now see Bayan Lepas as a thriving township starting from Queensbay Mall.\n\nBut right at the other end of Bayan Lepas is where the old world charm has remained at the Bayan Lepas old town.\n\nTime seemed to have stood still here. And that, in a way, is what makes Penang uniquely special with its blend of new and old world charms.\n\nFor sure, there are still some things about Bayan Lepas that have not terlepas, or disappeared.\n\n*Readers write\n\n> KK Tan: I have always wondered why Francis Light is regarded as the founder of Penang. Surely, there were already locals on the island before he landed on the island.\n\nChun Wai: I am not a historian but merely a student of history. This has always been a controversial subject, depending on which school of thought you subscribe to. But conventionally, the understanding is that Light was the first person to set up a proper system of administration and governance after his arrival. The legal, financial and security systems, for example, had to be properly set up to allow trading to be carried out as Penang had become a port by then. By having these systems in place, it attracted more traders to Penang and conduct business with the assurance that everything will be properly documented.\n\n> Another reader, tourist Jeff Black, wants to know the origin of the name Batu Ferringhi, where he often stays when he comes to Penang.\n\nChun Wai: According to what has been reported, the word ferringhi is said to originate from the Malay term for a person of Portuguese descent, but could also be taken to mean all westerners. Some said Batu Ferringhi also meant the rocks where the western foreigner landed.\n\n> Jeffrey Leong asked for some information about Chowrasta Street along Penang Road.\n\nChun Wai: Chowrasta is an Urdu word which means “four cross roads”. In fact, the Chowrasta Market is located within the area flanked by Chowrasta Street, Tamil Street, Kuala Kangsar Road and Penang Road. Known to Hokkien-speaking Penangites as kelinga ban san or Indian market, it used to be dominated by Tamil Muslim traders.\n\nI CRINGE every time I hear our television news reader or radio announcer pronounce Weld Quay as Weld Koay. And I wonder whether English is still being properly taught in schools or if the teachers themselves need to go back to school again.\n\nBut for many Penangites, who were exposed to the English language much earlier than the rest of the country, we know how to pronounce quay correctly as “key” instead of “koay”.\n\nMany of the local Hokkiens, who only know Weld Quay as Sin Hai Kee or New Waterfront Street, are also able to get the street name correct. Weld Quay, or Pengkalan Weld, as it is now known, is a coastal road on the east side of George Town.\n\nIt is named after Sir Frederick Aloysius Weld, the Governor of the Straits Settlements from 1880 to 1887. He was responsible for the land reclamation and port expansion on the waterfront.\n\nTo detour a bit, Weld was also recognised in Perak, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Port Weld in Perak is now known as Kuala Sepetang.\n\nIn Kuala Lumpur, what is now known as Jalan Raja Chulan, was previously Weld Road before the name was changed in 1982.\n\nToday, The Weld shopping complex remains as testimony to the road’s original name. The nearby Weld Hill was also renamed Bukit Mahkamah, where Menara Maybank now stands.\n\nIn Singapore, however, Weld Road and Upper Weld Road still remain.\n\nAccording to published records, Weld was born to a strong Catholic family in Dorset, England, but carved a name for himself in the British colonies of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nPrior to his arrival in Malaya in 1880, he had a successful political career in New Zealand where he was elected as a Member of Parliament for three terms.\n\nIn 1869, he moved to Australia to begin his career as a colonial officer, where he was appointed the Governor of Western Australia.\n\nWeld will be remembered in Malaya’s history as the colonial officer who saw the importance of ports and a well-connected logistics network.\n\nAccording to the book Streets of George Town, Weld Quay was created during the 1880s when Weld was Governor.\n\nHe embarked on land reclamation works which culminated in the development of Swettenham Pier.\n\nCompleted in 1904, the pier boosted Penang’s status as a modern transhipment centre.\n\nToday, the pier is also connected to the newly completed Swettenham Pier Cruise Terminal.\n\nSwettenham Pier was named after Frank Athelstane Swettenham (1850-1946), the first Resident General of the Federated Malay States between 1896 and 1901.\n\nKhoo Salma Nasution also wrote that the Indians called Weld Quay kitengi teru or the “street of company godowns”.\n\nThe godowns were used by Indian stevedores transporting rope with hand-pulled carts. Some of these godowns can still be found in some parts of the area.\n\nAnd if you are wondering where the famous mee mamak comes from, Khoo insisted that Weld Quay was the birthplace of kelinga mee, as mee mamak was originally known as, together with pasembur or mamak rojak. These delicacies were to whet the appetite of sailors and port workers along Weld Quay.\n\nAs the port grew, settlements for Chinese port workers from the various Chinese clans also came into being.\n\nAccording to Khoo, there were originally seven “clan jetties” at the waterfront but the Ong Jetty was dismantled when the ferry terminal was built.\n\nThe six originals which remain are the Lim, Chew, Tan, Lee, Yeoh and the “mixed clan” jetties known as Chap Seh Keo.\n\n“The jetty with the largest community was Chew Jetty, near the Armenian Street Ghaut. The Chew stevedores supplied fresh water to the ships,” she wrote.\n\n“The end of the Chew Jetty was the mooring place for Burmese trawlers which brought rubber, timber and other materials from Burma.”\n\nThe jetties, while keeping their reputation as a tough neighbourhood for the working class, have undergone changes over the years, and now form part of the Penang Heritage Trail.\n\nNot far from the area is Noordin Street, known locally as Jee Teow Lor (the second road), which had a reputation for its triads.\n\nWhen I was a student at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, there was a leggy, good-looking business administration student who hailed from one of the jetties.\n\nShe had many admirers and when my campus mates asked me about her, I would cheekily tell them that she came from such a notorious area that any outsider who tried to date her risked being beaten up!\n\nThe clan jetties remain to this day even though there are regular rumours that they will be demolished.\n\nThey are now popular with tourists, who walk along the boardwalks and are made to feel welcome by the residents, who understand the importance of tourism.\n\nSome enterprising residents have offered homestays while others have offered their boats as water taxis for tourists. Souvenir stalls have also been set up at these jetties.\n\nAlong the main road, food stalls have sprouted, and one fish head porridge-noodle stall, Siong Ho, has been featured on a popular Astro food programme hosted by Penangite Jason Teoh.\n\nWhen I was starting out as a reporter in Penang, I used to visit the Kwong Wah Yit Poh newspaper office in that vicinity regularly for coffee with my counterparts to compare notes.\n\nThe newspaper was founded by Dr Sun Yat Sen, the father of modern China, on Dec 20, 1910, when he was in exile in Penang from China.\n\nWeld Quay is also where The Star newspaper was born. The newspaper began its operations at Weld Quay in September, 1971, and was helmed by its founder and editor K.S. Choong.\n\nWhen The Star hit the streets, I was barely 10 years old and too young to read the newspaper, although my parents had started reading the new racy tabloid.\n\nAs I was not part of its initial beginnings, the home of The Star to me was the building along Pitt Street, or Jalan Mesjid Kapitan Keling, where I first began work in 1980. (Refer to my earlier article, Pressing on from Day One, published on March 2)\n\nMedia practitioner Rajan Moses, who was a Universiti Sains Malaysia student in 1971, was accepted as a stringer or freelance writer, when The Star was launched.\n\nHe wrote: “The launch of The Star had a great impact on Penangites, who were so used to the existing newspaper fare, that the arrival of something new perked them up. Finally, an alternative paper to read had arrived, and a racy tabloid at that!\n\n“Newspaper boys sold the first editions of the new paper late into the night in Penang’s streets, and The Star created quite a buzz.\n\n“It had a picture of a Page 3 girl daily (very much like what the The Sun and Daily Mirror did in London) and bright, bold and interesting human interest stories and pictures which sparked much local interest.”\n\nWeld Quay still has a great story to tell, just like this newspaper. It has a strong sense of history yet is ready to adapt and keep up with the changes.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nWeld’s great-grandson comes to Penang\n\nHis fellow members in the anti-Lynas movement feel let down because they see his decision as politically opportunistic.\n\nThey want him to step down from the movement but he says it is unwarranted because Himpunan Hijau isn’t registered anyway. He is even saying that his position as chairman is not an official position.\n\nBut what Wong has not said is that all this while, he has been freely making press statements in that capacity.\n\nDr Kua Kia Soong, adviser for human rights group Suaram, has expressed similar sentiments about Wong, saying the latter must step down.\n\nDr Kua was a Chinese educationist who quit the United Chinese School Committees’ Association of Malaysia (Dong Zong) in 1990 to contest under the DAP in the 1990 general election. He won the Petaling Jaya Utara parliamentary seat but he did not last long in the DAP as his idealism and uncompromising principles did not fit in the opposition party.\n\nThe respectable human rights activist, who was detained under the Internal Security Act in 1987, left the DAP bitterly and ended up pouring out his frustrations in a book, Inside the DAP: 1990-1995.\n\nDr Kua has returned to NGO activities.\n\nAs he rightly wrote recently, “Politicians like to spout the platitude that ‘politics is the art of the possible’, but movements must bear pressure on them to make their demands possible.\n\n“Now, before Wong has even started his career as a politician, he is already faced with his first dilemma.”\n\nPakatan Rakyat chief (Datuk Seri) Anwar Ibrahim, Dr Kua wrote, “has demonstrated the ‘art of the possible’ by declaring that if Pakatan comes into power, Lynas will be given a chance to prove the plant’s safety”.\n\nWong, when asked to respond to what Anwar had said, was quick to support the Opposition Leader’s statement. That was a far cry from his earlier pledge to burn down the Lynas plant himself if Pakatan comes to power.\n\nThat’s precisely the trouble with NGO leaders, especially some activists in Penang, who decide to take a partisan political stand. They begin to make compromises and, worse, they begin to lose their neutrality as they openly side with Pakatan.\n\nAt least one former NGO leader has taken up a Senator’s post while others have been co-opted into various state government posts. Others cannot remember which hat they were wearing when they made statements.\n\nThe only beacon that stands out in Penang, home of NGOs, is the Consumers Association of Penang, which has consistently spoken out about issues affecting the country and state.\n\nUnlike many NGOs which are actually one-man shows, CAP is professionally run and is focused on education and research. It does not need to flirt with politicians and has kept its credibility fully intact.\n\nWong obviously owes the thousands of people who took part in the anti-Lynas protest walk an explanation. Was he using them to increase his profile so he could secure himself a candidacy?\n\nHis commitment to the environment itself has now been questioned as he has maintained a stoic silence on the blatant raping of forests in Kedah and Kelantan, two states run by PAS, a partner in the Pakatan.\n\nAgain, I quote Dr Kua in reference to NGO leaders who have wavered after becoming involved in politics: “Is it because they are so caught up with the political hoopla they have also stepped down a notch from their previous uncompromising stand?\n\n“It’s time they found their own voice now that their erstwhile chairperson has gone on to pursue his political career.”\n\nThere have been high hopes that environment issues would play a major role in this coming election but it would appear that much of it has been tainted with political motives. Politicians and wannabe politicians have hijacked the green movement to pursue their political goals at the expense of genuine environmental concerns.\n\nTake, for example, the Bukit Koman gold mine issue. Purported environmental activists have claimed that the mine’s use of cyanide caused medical problems among the residents nearby. Until now, however, not a shred of evidence has been produced to support their claims.\n\nLast year, DAP Kepong MP Dr Tan Seng Giaw, a skin specialist, said “there is still no evidence to show the occurrence of skin problems among Bukit Koman residents in Raub is linked to cyanide used in gold mine activities”.\n\n“It is difficult to attribute the skin problems to a certain substance as it is a very slow process. I think we should approach this issue in a rational manner,” he said.\n\nYet, the same allegations have been recycled, with the hope that if a lie is told a thousand times, it will become fact.\n\nInterestingly, the gold mine employs over 300 local residents, and Barisan Nasional is claiming that most of the protesters are actually from outside Raub.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that a gold mine operator in PAS-run Kelantan uses cyanide and actually explained its operations on its official website. But there’s not even a whisper of protest against it from pro-Pakatan environmentalists, who seem to choose their targets.\n\nTwo other gold mines in Pahang are said to also use cyanide but again they are not in the political spotlight. Bukit Koman, however, is in the Raub parliamentary constituency, which the opposition feels it has a chance of wresting from the Barisan.\n\nEnvironmental awareness is crucial and important. Malaysians must demand that protection of our environment be included as part of the national agenda.\n\nThis newspaper has exposed wanton logging, illegal or otherwise, in Pahang, Kedah, Kelantan and Perak. We have highlighted the problems of the natives in Sarawak and incurred the wrath of politicians and developers over our reports on the excessive hill development in Penang. Then there is the never-ending issue of illegal sand mining in Selangor.\n\nOur reporters have been threatened by both sides of the political divide but that’s the price we have to pay if we are to pursue the issue passionately.\n\nThe Buku Jingga, for example, is totally silent on the customary land rights of the orang asli, public transport system and even a sustainable energy policy. Environmental groups and voters must insist on these when the Barisan unveils its manifesto.\n\nThe days of a special radio station and the community of Aussies who made Tanjung Bungah their home while working at the Butterworth air base.\n\nGROWING up in the 1970s as a teenager, there was no such thing as Internet radio. There was no paid television either such as Astro or Hypp.TV.\n\nWe only had RTM, which was not the best option for entertainment back then, as it was primarily an information station.\n\nBut lucky for us Penangites, we had Radio RAAF. Its frequency was limited to Penang and parts of Kedah.\n\nBut as a music–loving teenager, I was introduced to the world of Australian bands such as Little River Band, Sherbet, INXS, Men At Work and of course, John Paul Young, with his monster hit Love Is In The Air.\n\nThe announcers were all amateurs, mostly family members of the Australian servicemen, and often their presentation was flat, even monotonous, but the music repertoire was up-to-date.\n\nCome Saturday night, it was Party Time, which came on air at 9pm and lasted till past midnight.\n\nThe deejays entertained requests we sent in by snail mail. And we could buy ready-made postcards where the address of the radio station was printed.\n\nTo this day, I can still recall the call sign for each programme that simply began with, “This is Radio R, double A, F…”\n\nThe Australia air base in Butterworth certainly left an impact on many Penangites because they became very much a part of the local community.\n\nWith its thriving port, Penangites had long been exposed to foreign presence, but to have Australians in the neighbourhood emphasised how cosmopolitan the state was in the early years.\n\nFor the servicemen and their families, the preferred neighbourhoods were Fettes Park, Hillside and Tanjung Bungah, where they stayed mostly in rented homes.\n\nThese areas were walking distance to public beaches, which must have brought back memories of their homes Down Under. The Pulau Tikus market was also just 20 minutes away by car, where they did most of their shopping.\n\nFettes Park in Tanjung Tokong was and still is a middle-class housing area, with mostly English educated residents.\n\nIt is named after the municipal engineer of George Town, JD Fettes, who played a major role in the building of Guillemard Reservoir above Fettes Park.\n\nThe Fettes Park neighbourhood is bordered by Jalan Tanjung Tokong to the east, Mount Erskine to the south and Vale of Tempe to the north.\n\nTanjung Bungah or sometimes spelt Tanjong Bunga, is a suburban route to the tourist belt of Batu Ferringhi, a name which some said was derived from Portuguese, to mean the spot where the foreigners landed.\n\nTanjung Tokong, which one must pass through on the way to the seaside resorts, used to be an old fishing village.\n\nNear the UDA low-cost flats, there is the Tua Pek Kong temple. This is probably the reason why the village was named Tokong.\n\nThis temple is famous to this day because of the annual Chneah Hoay (flame-watching) ceremony held on the eve of Chap Goh Meh, where the deity would predict the economic outlook for the country.\n\nSo it was around these locations that thousands of servicemen and their families found their home away from home.\n\nTheir story began in 1957 when the Royal Air Force, which was part of the British defence plan, closed the base in Butterworth and transferred ownership to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).\n\nThe RAAF stationed numerous Australian fighters and bomber squadrons there.\n\nThese planes were to play a crucial, but supportive role during the Emergency as well as the Confrontation with Indonesia.\n\nIt was reported that in 1964, its Sabre jets responded to Indonesian jet fighters heading towards Malaysian airspace but the latter turned back before crossing the international air space.\n\nThe RAAF personnel were generally well-behaved, unlike the rowdier American marines, who also dropped by Penang as part of their rest and recreation entitlement back in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFor the Australians, when they were off duty, they could be seen in George Town, wearing their trademark shorts and stockings which were pulled up to their knees.\n\nTheir favourite eating spot was the Eden Restaurant in Hutton Lane, which served western set meals at reasonable prices, while their watering hole was the Hong Kong Bar in Chulia Street, which was something of an institution in Penang until the RAAF closed its base in 1988.\n\nThe servicemen would leave pictures, badges, momentoes and plaques as a reminder of their days at the bar.\n\nBy then, Penang already has a decent-sized supermarket — Cold Storage in Penang Road, which catered to these Australians and Westerners, who wanted fresh food and meat products.\n\nNot far from the Cold Storage supermarket was a snack bar which served western and Chinese food and the most famous ice-cream then, Magnolia.\n\nMy late uncle Simon Leow, who used to frequent the eatery, got me my first job there in 1978 after Form Five.\n\nI was supposed to be a bartender and waiter. I did not last very long because I spent more on food than the meagre wage that I earned.\n\nThe only consolation was that I tried the entire range of ice-cream.\n\nIt was here that I made my first milkshake, and my first banana split. But I had to split from the scene soon enough because I was really a nuisance to my fellow workers.\n\nLeow, obviously wanted me to learn the hard way that it was better that I concentrated on schooling rather than entertain any foolish thoughts of entering the workforce at an early age.\n\nFor Australian families, who had just arrived in Penang, the RAAF Club was their oasis.\n\nTemporary accommodation would be provided to these new arrivals until they find their homes in Fettes Park, Tanjung Tokong and Tanjung Bungah — these were their three favourite spots although the base was on the other side of the channel.\n\nTheir social lives revolved around the RAAF Club — where sporting and social events were held. It was open only to RAAF personnel and Malaysians working with them.\n\nThe term sarong party girl — a derogatory term used in Malaysia and Singapore to describe a local woman, who exclusively dates white men — was not commonly used then.\n\nBut the presence of these Aussies was bound to see romance blossom with the local women.\n\nA neighbour of mine at Jalan Kampung Melayu married a RAAF officer, whose children would often drop by my house.\n\nThese Australians left behind many friends among Penangites. The Radio RAAF played Everytime You Go Away as its farewell song, before signing off for good.\n\nMaybe the relationship between Penang and Australia was fated in some ways. After all, Captain Francis Light founded Penang while his son, William Light, founded Adelaide.\n\nBut this time, the rooms have all been taken up by the security personnel who are using the hostel as an operation centre.\n\nThe hostel is about 15km from Kampung Tanduo, the scene of fighting between the Sulu intruders and our security forces.\n\nWhen fighter jets dropped bombs last Tuesday in an all-out assault to finish off the gunmen holed up in the village, the explosions were loud enough to be heard from the hostel.\n\nOf the 40 rooms, only eight are set aside for the media, although there are about 100 reporters and cameramen from the print and TV stations at the scene.\n\nOver the last 10 days, at least seven pressmen have had to share a room, giving themselves a maximum of 10 minutes to use the washroom every morning.\n\nOthers travel daily between Lahad Datu and the hostel, which is also used as a media centre, for daily briefings.\n\nBut travelling between Lahad Datu and the hostel carries a risk. There are no street lights on the trunk road and if one does not have a vehicle, there is no taxi driver willing to ferry anyone there. The fighting has frightened off most taxi drivers from taking the 140km journey.\n\nThe price to hire a sedan car has shot up from the previous RM130 to RM300, while hiring a four-wheel drive vehicle will set you back RM500 instead of the usual RM350.\n\nBoth sides of the road are lined with oil palm plantations and heavy undergrowth. With talk that some intruders might have escaped from the dragnet, there are fears that some could be hiding in the jungle foliage.\n\nSecurity is so tight that reporters travelling from the Felda town of Cendarawasih, some 30km away, are stopped from entering the media centre.\n\nThe media people have resorted to doing homestays with the Felda settlers at Cenderawasih to be as near to the action as possible but they are locked out each time there is an operation at Kampung Tanduo.\n\nThe pressmen are working under tight conditions as they battle to meet their deadlines while their Kuala Lumpur-based editors, many of whom are ignorant and have never set foot on Sabah, bark orders over the phone.\n\nTaking a dig at their bosses seems to have become a way out for them to release their tension as every media group fights one another for exclusives. Separating facts from rumours is their biggest challenge.\n\nFrom the rumour-mongering by the locals to purported breaking news from the blogs and tweets, the press has had to sieve through the mass of information.\n\nOn one occasion, a family member of the self-proclaimed Sulu Sultan Jamalul Kiram III called a press conference in Manila to show a picture of the dead bodies of security men piled up on a vehicle, claiming they were Malaysians at Tanduo. It was actually an old picture taken in Thailand.\n\nThen there were the occasional claims of more intruders landing on our shores, which were certainly aimed at frightening Malaysians living in the small towns here. The result is often panic and the shutters are pulled down immediately.\n\nJamalul has found himself in the media glare but there are up to 60 Filipinos who have also declared themselves Sultans.\n\nMoro National Liberation Front (MNLF) founder Nur Misuari has been blamed for providing support to the gunmen despite his denial that he played any role in the intrusion. Jamalul, on his own, has no soldiers. Misuari is known for his unhappiness over the peace road map between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Manila brokered by Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe psychological warfare has become more complicated, if not more farcical, with the head of the intruders, the so-called Raja Muda Azzimuddie Kiram, giving telephone interviews to the press from both KL and Manila. His fate has remained unknown since the bombing.\n\nBut there are still lingering questions that have continued to dominate the conversation among pressmen from both sides, the main one being “Why now?”\n\nJamalul, 74, is passing himself off as royalty but the fact is he is just another politician. He contested for senator as part of former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s Team Unity in the 2007 polls but lost badly.\n\nIn the elections, Jamalul finished 26th out of 37 candidates. He garnered 2.49 million votes, or 8.4% of the votes cast for all senators.\n\nManila believes the intrusion into Sabah was a plan to exert pressure on President Benigno Aquino III by forces close to Arroyo ahead of the republic’s mid-term elections in May. Control of the bicameral legislature ahead of the 2016 presidential polls is crucial.\n\nArroyo is under house arrest for electoral sabotage and moves are being made to pressure Aquino to grant her a presidential pardon. A total of 18,022 national and local posts, including 12 senatorships, will be decided in the May elections. The Philippine Senate has 24 members who serve a six-year term and Jamalul is expected to run again.\n\nThere is also the Malaysian general election set to be called in weeks – and most media and political analysts believe that there are also hidden Malaysian hands at work to embarrass the Prime Minister ahead of the polls, given the importance of Sabah.\n\nThe intrusion ahead of the Philippine and Malaysian polls, and the close relationships of the personalities suspected in the link between both countries, have fuelled more speculation as to why it has taken place now.\n\nFOR just 40sen, many of us got to buy a third-class ticket to watch a movie. A third-class ticket meant sitting on the first three rows of a cinema with our necks craned to focus on the giant screen in front.\n\nAnd you can imagine the discomfort if you were seated on the extreme left or right of the first row.\n\nIn some cinemas, the class distinction was further aggravated by the wooden third-class seats as cushioned seats were only for first and second class, as well as balcony seats also known as “upstairs”.\n\nOne cannot but feel that cinema operators wanted to punish us for just being too poor or too cheapskate.\n\nWelcome to the 1960s and 1970s — when going to the movies was a real treat, a weekend reward from your parents.\n\nRemember, those were the days when most families were big, and it would be extremely expensive to buy first class or balcony seats for the entire family, unless you are well-to-do.\n\nUnlike today’s cineplexes, the seating arrangement was divided into first, second and third classes, and ticket prices varied accordingly. The most expensive tickets were for the “upstairs” seats, where there was even a side entrance to the cinema bar.\n\nLike the English theatre, there would be an interval or break midway into the movies, for the cinema-goers to buy drinks.\n\nIn some cinemas, a woman would walk around the aisles selling ice-cream, which was really quite amazing, considering how strict modern cineplexes are about food consumption in cinema halls.\n\nAnother unique touch to cinema-going back then, was the ticket inspector who would come by once the show has started. With torchlight in hand, they would make sure that you are sitting where you should be.\n\nWell, when the show is not packed, it is quite common for the third-class patrons to quietly move to first class.\n\nBack in those days, most of the children would go to the movies, especially the evening shows, with sweaters as they were not accustomed to air-conditioning.\n\nBut some cinemas in Penang, even until the late 1970s, did not even have air-conditioning, and only used giant fans to cool the premises, which must be hard to imagine today!\n\nThe cinema experience was a real outing and we would all be seated way before the show started because we enjoyed the spotlights beaming different colours onto the huge velvet curtain, which would start to part once the movie projector came on.\n\nThe first cinema in Penang was the Majestic Theatre, which opened in 1926. It was also named after its owner, the late Khoo Sian Ewe, who was the doyen of the Chinese business community.\n\nIt was the first cinema in Penang to screen sound movies, or talkies, in the 1930s. According to reports, it was also known to the locals as the Shanghai Sound Movie Theatre.\n\nThe cinemas in those days had an air of grandeur with their distinctive architecture. Every cinema was different, unlike today when you recognise the cinema hall in a cineplex, located in a mall, by a number.\n\nGrowing up in Penang, there was plenty to choose from.\n\nBesides the Lido and Globe cinemas at the New World Park at Swatow Lane, which has now become a food court, the English movies would usually be screened at the Cathay and Odeon cinemas along Penang Road.\n\nA movie I remembered watching at the Cathay cinema was Mackenna’s Gold, a 1969 western starring Gregory Peck and Telly Savalas, where the greedy characters shot themselves to death in their mad scramble for gold. The theme song, Old Turkey Buzzard, by Jose Feliciano was a hit.\n\nCathay, also known as the Choong Lye Hock Theatre, stood as a cinema for more than 35 years, but today, it houses a Mydin supermarket.\n\nMy eldest brother, Chun Sang, the only Chinese-educated one among my brothers, made sure that I had a balanced entertainment.\n\nSo regularly on Sundays, he would take me on his motorcycle to Federal Cinema, along Datuk Keramat Road, to watch the latest kung fu and sword-fighting flicks from Hong Kong. In those days, they all spoke Mandarin even though the movies were made in Hong Kong.\n\nHe opened me up to the amazing world of flying swordsmen with the likes of Wang Yu, David Chiang, Ti Lung, Chen Kuan Tai, Fu Sheng and Lo Lieh.\n\nI was then in primary school, and like the rest of the world, I was swept away by the movies of the legendary Bruce Lee with his unique martial arts skills.\n\nBut while I did not mind the action movies, I cringed and protested each time my brother took me to watch the Taiwanese romance movies of Chin Han, Chen Chen, Lin Fong Chiao (the wife of Jackie Chan) and Tien Niu.\n\nThese days, when you go to the movies, your choice of knick-knacks is limited by what is sold officially at the cineplex.\n\nBut at the Federal, for example, we could have either lok lok (small bits of food on skewers), steamed groundnuts, sotong bakar or barbecued meat buns.\n\nAt every cinema, there will always be an Indian man with his tray of salted peanuts and yellow kacang putih.\n\nOne item which the cinema-going generation of those days will surely remember is the kuaci or sunflower seeds.\n\nEveryone just ate it throughout the movie, and the shells were simply scattered all over the floor. Which is why there is a long break in between shows as the cleaners have to come in to clear up.\n\nWith all the leftover food, the occasional one or two rats running across our feet in the middle of a show was not something strange! Finding a chewing gum stuck on the floor, annoying as it may be, was also common.\n\nThe toilets were located in the cinema itself, often towards the front third-class section, so one could actually go and take a quick toilet break.\n\nBut as children, we were terrified to go to the toilet alone in the middle of a show. The toilet, with its row of urinals, was huge. Often, we just hold it in, especially if we were watching a horror movie!\n\nMy parents widened my mind further by taking me to watch my first Hindi movie — Haathi Mere Saathi (Elephant, My Friend) — about a man who was forced to choose his love for his elephant friends and his wife. It starred Rajesh Khanna Tanuja.\n\nThis movie was shown at the Royal cinema at Maxwell Road and to this day, still probably holds the record for being one of the longest-running movies ever shown in local cinemas. It touched the heart of every Penangite, no matter what race, and everyone would have watched it more than once, often leaving in tears because the ending was so sad.\n\nMy father, Wong Soon Cheong, who was born in Kuah, Langkawi, laid the foundation for my love of Malay movies, and the works of the legendary P. Ramlee, himself a Penangite. And the one cinema that showed mainly Malay movies was the Paramount at Prangin Road.\n\nAs I write this article, I could see that we were really spoilt for choice back then and these were some of the cinemas I recall.\n\nThe Capitol, Paramount, Royal and Eastern have all been demolished to make way for new developments. At the New World Park, there were the Lido and the Globe, the latter being a semi-open cinema, which allowed those who did not buy tickets to watch the movie from outside.\n\nThen, of course, there were Odeon cinema (still open) in Penang Road, the Rex cinema (now a home furnishing store) in Burmah Road, the Star cinema (now a lighting shop) in Datuk Keramat Road, the Capitol cinema also at Penang Road, the Gala cinema (defunct) in Aboo Siti Lane, the Majestic cinema (abandoned) in Phee Choon Road, the Sun cinema (discotheque) off Campbell Street, the Metro cinema (now the office of Sculpture at Work) in Perak Road, Movieland (demolished) next to City Bayview Hotel, the Wembly cinema (demolished) in Noordin Street, the Kok Pin cinema (a supermarket now) and the Choong Nam cinema (now a church) in Ayer Itam.\n\nBy the Gama Supermarket, which is where Penang Road, Datuk Keramat Road and Brick Kiln Road meet, there used to be an open patch of land where the giant-sized posters promoting the movies were placed. This stretch has now been renamed Jalan Gurdwara after the Sikh temple located in its vicinity.\n\nBy the time I was in school, with my parents being more generous with my allowance, I became more addicted to movies.\n\nIn the late 1970s, when John Travolta’s Saturday Night Fever reached Penang, I skipped school to make sure I was the first in the queue to buy a ticket. Many young people watched the movies countless times at the Rex cinema just to learn the dance steps.\n\nIt was also the era of the Hui Brothers — Sam, Michael and Ricky — with their wacky sense of humour, portraying the struggling lives of the working class in Hong Kong, in their comedy blockbusters made between 1974 and 1981.\n\nThose were our growing-up years as teenagers and taking a girl out on a date meant taking her to watch a movie. It was best and most affordable, if not the healthiest way, to meet members of the opposite sex.\n\nInterestingly enough, men and women were segregated at the ticket counters and the men would always try to get the women to buy tickets for them, provided they did not exceed their quota of four tickets.\n\nThe women’s queue was always shorter but I am sure some of the men just wanted to pick up girls by asking for this favour.\n\nAnd it was also a time when X-rated movies were allowed to be shown. We were too young to be admitted but we could remember the uncles from our neighbourhood looking rather sheepish as they queued up for tickets.\n\nBut was it the good old times? I am not sure. The cineplexes are cleaner now, the sound system is better and the seats more comfortable. If you pay more, you even get a blanket with a reclining seat and a cup of soft drink and popcorn.\n\nGone are the “carpets” of kuaci shells on the floor and scurrying rats are only memories of the past.\n\nThe smokers, which we had to tolerate back then, have finally disappeared but are replaced by people who talk or send SMSes on their mobile phones.\n\nAnd with today’s online booking, who could have imagined that there was a time when scalpers selling over-priced tickets did roaring business each time a blockbuster was screened?\n\nIT'S 11am at Kampung Simunul. The sprawling village on stilts, on the outskirts of Semporna, is the largest of the squatter colonies scattered around the coastline. It is usually a hive of activity but as I meandered through the maze of rickety walkways, I felt like I was walking through a ghost town.\n\nI had taken a one-and-a-half hour journey by road from Lahad Datu to Semporna, a distance of some 140km. We passed by three road blocks manned by security officers along the way and the security presence was obvious as we saw three people being detained at one of the road blocks.\n\nAt Kg Simunul, most of its thousands of mainly Suluk settlers have disappeared, with their homes locked up and belongings removed to safer places. It was here that six intruders and six of our policemen were killed last Saturday in a fierce shootout.\n\nA few of the villagers have stubbornly refused to leave, saying they cannot imagine themselves camping out in a school hall or community centre.\n\nDepending on who you talk to, the figures vary as to the actual size of the village. Some say there are between 300 and 500 houses while others claim that the number is closer to a thousand.\n\nThis is home to the Suluks, who fled the southern Philippines in the 1970s, during the civil war in Mindanao. They had originally settled in refugee enclaves set up by the UNHCR but many have since become Malaysian citizens while a large number probably had no documents with them.\n\nThe water village has a reputation of harbouring bad hats, and the locals avoid entering the area. It is difficult to navigate through the maze of wooden boardwalks and it is likely that in the incident on March 5, our policemen were ambushed when they lost their way in this dangerous territory.\n\nWhen I walked into Lorong 4 with my two colleagues, we felt like we were being stared at by hidden figures. An elderly man approached us and asked what we were doing there. He seemed a little friendlier when we said we were from the media.\n\n“Do you want to see the bullet holes and the spots where the three gunmen were killed?” he offered, as a few men suddenly appeared to join us. I had to watch my step as one could easily fall into the water as the boardwalk had many gaping holes in them. The water below was filled with all sorts of rubbish and a horrible stench emanated from it. I could not help wondering how these people could live under such filthy conditions.\n\nMy thoughts drifted to the stilt villages off Weld Quay in Penang, which are generally clean, safe and properly maintained.\n\nWe had to take a detour to reach Lorong 5, where the fighting took place, because the village headman Ramli Saraman had ordered the boardwalk from Lorong 4 to be broken down as a symbolic gesture to show the “bad men” were from Lorong 5.\n\nThey showed us a home that was riddled with bullet holes, and pointed out the spots where three of the intruders were killed, and their bodies left untouched for three days.\n\nOne was on a boat, one on the walkway and another on the verandah of a home. The dried splattered blood, close to where the bodies were found, are still very visible. The bodies, which included that of a Filipino councillor of Pulau Sitangkai in the southern Philippines, were eventually removed for burial by the religious authorities.\n\nBut the superstitious villagers excused themselves when we walked towards the abandoned home where a policeman was beheaded, saying they did not want to go into that “house of evil.”\n\nWe saw what appeared to be the remains of human tissue on the wooden entrance. The thought that two of our men in blue were beheaded while another had his eyes gouged out sent shivers down my spine.\n\nI walked freely inside the house even as I thought of the horrible and cruel acts that were carried out by these heartless militants. I felt angry and sad at the same time, wondering how human beings could carry out such acts.\n\nThe television set had clear traces of blood, which horrified me. The walls of the home were adorned with family photographs, like most ordinary homes, except that something extraordinarily evil had taken place.\n\nNone of us wanted to stay any longer than necessary at that place.\n\nAs we walked out of the village, we came across a young boy who had come back to collect more of his belongings, saying the family was not ready to move back in.\n\nThe men we met said they feared more gunmen may come back, and they also worried about the repercussions from our security men.\n\nThey impressed upon us that they were just ordinary people trying to eke out a living in peaceful Malaysia but these militants had given the Suluks a bad name.\n\n“Some Sabahans now look at us suspiciously when they know we are Suluks from this village. It's embarrassing,” a restaurant worker said.\n\nIronically, the word “Semporna” is said to be from a Sanskrit word meaning “a place of rest” or “a journey completed” but for these Suluks, who fled from their homes, they know they are unlikely to get much sympathy from the Malaysians, especially when their countrymen still want to make a claim for Sabah.\n\nMany Malaysians have long questioned the influx of these foreigners into Malaysia, especially into Sabah, and if we do not take a stronger, even harsher, stand against such easy entry into our country, we only have ourselves to blame when security threats arise.\n\nSemporna is the gateway to Sipadan, one of the world's most beautiful diving spots, but it should never be a gateway for illegal immigrants.\n\nJUST 50km outside Lahad Datu, one has to pass through Silabukan, which has a picturesque coastline. On a clear day, one can see a mass of land which is part of the Tawi-Tawi islands off the Philippines.\n\nBongao Island, the capital, is clearly visible. Originally a backwater village, Bongao, where the majority of the population is Muslim, is rapidly developing.\n\nIt takes only 20 minutes by speedboat for the Filipinos to reach our shores. That's how close we are physically.\n\nBut there is also another dimension to our close proximity.\n\nThe locals are fond of telling outsiders that it is normal for their Filipino relatives to come to Malaysia for a game of football or volleyball, and then return to the Philippines on the same day.\n\nObviously we are not even talking about clearing Immigration.\n\nThe Filipino influence on our side is so strong that some of the grocery shops are referred to as “sari-sari”.\n\nAt the Danggan Tungku fishing village, one can look across and see Sibutu, which is also part of the Tawi-Tawi islands.\n\nFrom where I stood, the villagers were talking excitedly about the fighter jets bombing Kg Tanduo.\n\nI arrived in this east coast Sabah town yesterday as the Malaysian police and army continued their mop-up operations after a massive attack on Tuesday.\n\nThe waters of the Sulu Sea and Sulawesi Sea have always been a dangerous area, well-known for piracy.\n\nThe pirates not only prey on fishermen but also huge container ships. They are reportedly well-armed and use high-speed motorboats.\n\nBut there are also more dangerous elements the host of Muslim radicals fighting for an independent Mindanao Islamic state being one of them. Their long history includes kidnapping of tourists and attacks on Sabahan towns.\n\nIn 1996, Semporna was attacked twice, which included an assault on its police station by 10 to 20 pirates armed with M-16 rifles.\n\nIn 2000, Abu Sayyaf militants arrived on the Sipadan resort island and kidnapped 21 people comprising tourists and resort workers, for ransom.\n\nLahad Datu is located in the Tawau division. It's an hour's flight from Kota Kinabalu, some 400km away.\n\nMany orang semenanjung, as the locals call Malaysians from the peninsular, may have heard of this place but would have trouble pinpointing its location.\n\nOn Feb 11, heavily armed militants arrived in Lahad Datu and took over the village of Kg Tanduo. Inevitably, the whole world then came to know about this place.\n\nThe Sabah attacks have also provided history and geographical lessons for Malaysians. Most of us are learning, for the first time, about the lesser-known ethnic groups that exist in Malaysia, like Bajau, Bisaya, Kadazan Dusun, Murut, Dumpas, Illanun, Kwijau, Maragang, Orang Cocos, Orang Sungai, Rungus and of course, Tausug or the Suluks.\n\nIt would even surprise many Malaysians, who have only read about the controversial Project IC to naturalise the foreigners in the 1980s, that many Filipinos who settled in Sabah came from as far back as the Chinese from the southern seas.\n\nIn fact, in the 1970s, when the late Tun Mustapha was chief minister, he allowed more Filipinos, fleeing the fighting in the Philippines, to settle in Sabah.\n\nBut it is also this familiarity and even possible ties with their local kin that might have given the intruders the advantage.\n\nAccording to military intelligence sources, they knew the terrain around the village well.\n\nThe conclusion is that they had visited the area before and were well acquainted with the heavy undergrowth and foliage in the hilly terrain.\n\nThe team of six Malaysian policemen which walked into a group of 30 intruders, which had used a white flag as a ruse, were surrounded and shot at by two snipers. Two of the Malaysians died.\n\nAbout 130km away, where the Semporna water village is located, there are at least 300 homes on stilts and some have been suspected to provide support for these terrorists, who killed six other Malaysian security personnel in another encounter.\n\nThese Filipinos showed no mercy, beheading two of our men, and carrying out extremely cruel, gruesome acts on our men before killing them. They also gouged out the eyes of one of their victims.\n\nIt is the fanaticism in these intruders, with their readiness to die for their cause, which has startled our authorities.\n\nBut there is an expensive, if not, painful lesson, to learn from here. The Sabah coastal line is porous but the reality is that we have exposed our lax security along our coast. This is not the first time, but unfortunately this is also the worst security crisis in years.\n\nThe authorities' mantra of assuring Malaysians that “all is well and under control” will only be greeted with cynicism unless we take a really concerted and serious effort to beef up our maritime security along the coast.\n\nWe need to invest well to guard our 4,675km of coastline and our waters (including the Exclusive Economic Zones claimed) of 574,000sq km.\n\nThe fact is that the waters that Malaysia has to maintain security and sovereignty over are nearly twice the size of peninsular Malaysia and Sabah and Sarawak combined. That's not all, the distance between the peninsula and the two states is about 1,200km.\n\nThe intrusions have shown how vulnerable we are when facing external threats. This time, the intruders were a rag-tag but well-trained team of rebels. A full-fledged conventional military attack would be more worrisome.\n\nWe cannot take for granted that Malaysia is free from any external threat. We have been blessed with peace and stability but the wake-up call has been sounded. In fact, the alarm bells are ringing out loud.\n\nLet's clean up our act we owe it to our fallen heroes who have sacrificed their lives for the nation. Don't let their deaths be in vain."
