He is a Member of Supreme Council and Division Chief of Masjid Tanah of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a component party of the BN coalition. He has also served as the State Chairman of BN and UMNO of Melaka since July 2018.[1][2]\\n\", \"On 11 May 2020, Ab Rauf was elected as Speaker of the Melaka State Legislative Assembly to replace Omar Jaafar of PH after BN took over the state administration from PH on 9 March 2020. On 4 November 2021, he announced that the assembly had been dissolved after Chief Minister Sulaiman lost the majority support in the assembly due to the withdrawal support for him as Chief Minister by 4 MLAs.\\n\", \"In the 2021 Melaka state election, Ab Rauf made his electoral debut and was nominated by BN to contest for the Tanjung Bidara seat replacing the retiring MLA Md Rawi Mahmud. In the tightly contested election, he garnered 3,559 votes in total and narrowly defeated Perikatan Nasional (PN) candidate Mas Ermieyati Samsudin who was also the Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of Parliament and Law as well as Member of Parliament (MP) for Masjid Tanah by a slim majority of only 364 votes.\\n\", \" On 26 November 2021, Chief Minister Sulaiman appointed Ab Rauf as a Senior EXCO member for the portfolios of Investment, Industry, Entrepreneur Development and Cooperatives.[3] As the only Senior EXCO member, Ab Rauf was the de facto Deputy Chief Minister and second most powerful person in the state government of Melaka after Sulaiman. As the Senior EXCO member, Ab Rauf worked closely with the governmental organisations of the state such as Unit Perancangan Ekonomi Negeri (UPEN) Melaka, Malaysia Investment and Development Authority (MIDA), Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Melaka (PKNM) as well as other local and international private companies and corporations. He also helped the state to secure various development projects and direct investments. Among the notable ones is the Light Rapid Transit (LRT) railway network that applies the Magnetic Levitation (MagLev) technology and connects all the districts of the state.[4][5][6][7][8]\\n\", \"On 31 March 2023, Ab Rauf was sworn in and appointed as the 13th Chief Minister of Melaka to take over Sulaiman[9] who was confirmed to resign as Chief Minister two days ago on 29 March 2023.[10] There were frequent speculations and rumours that Sulaiman was forced to resign as Chief Minister by Ab Rauf as well as Ab Rauf and Sulaiman had fallen out as the former who was the Melaka BN and UMNO Chairman was not appointed as Chief Minister after the 2021 state election, breaking the convention of the leader of the largest political coalition and party being appointed as the Chief Minister.[11] Instead, Melaka UMNO Secretary Sulaiman was reappointed.[12] However, both have also frequently denied the speculations and rumours. Before being appointed to the position, Deputy Prime Minister and BN Chairman Ahmad Zahid Hamidi explained that the decision of Sulaiman to resign was due to his \\\"health problems\\\", which have been questioned by many[13] and proposed only Ab Rauf to Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Melaka Mohd Ali Rustam to be appointed as the new Chief Minister.[14] His appointment also met criticisms from fellow BN Rembia MLA Muhammad Jailani Khamis who labelled him a \\\"backdoor\\\" Chief Minister. On the criticism of Jailani who broke rank with the party not to support him, he took the \\\"wait and see\\\" approach before deciding on any disciplinary actions against Jailani[15] and urged him not to be a \\\"hero\\\" who get cheap political publicity by breaking rank with the party and criticising him.[16] On the possibility of forming a coalition government with Pakatan Harapan (PH) by appointing PH MLAs to his EXCO, similar to the coalition government at the federal level, Ab Rauf added that he had yet to receive an indication from the central leadership of his party. He assured that his EXCO line-up would be finalised and unveiled in two days after discussions on it with Ahmad Zahid. He also pledged to make Melaka an investor-friendly state. He also noted that Melaka is the most politically stable state in Malaysia given that BN had gained a landslide victory in the 2021 state election. He characterised his upcoming EXCO lineup as inclusive and reflective of the coalition government at the federal level, indirectly confirming that his EXCO would consist of BN and PH MLAs and described it as pro-business and pro-reform.[17] Ahmad Zahid also indirectly confirmed it. On 1 April 2023, Ab Rauf directly confirmed it and asked the people to expect an exemplary, appealing and attractive EXCO lineup.[18] On 3 April 2023, Ab Rauf revealed that his EXCO will most likely be sworn in and appointed two days later on 5 April 2023 and the lineup had been accepted by Ahmad Zahid on 2 April 2023.[19] On 5 April 2023, his EXCO was sworn in. He retained 7 EXCO members of the Sulaiman II EXCO and appointed three new EXCO members. The lineup consists of 10 BN MLAs and only 1 PH MLA.[20] He also promoted Melaka UMNO Deputy Chairman Rais Yasin to Senior EXCO Member, a rank previously held by him, effectively making him the de facto Deputy Chief Minister and second most powerful person in the state government of Melaka after Ab Rauf and announced the reestablishment of the position of Deputy EXCO Member that was abolished in 2018.[21] He added that the 10 EXCO members would have a deputy respectively and the 10 Deputy EXCO members were to be unveiled on 6 April 2023. He also rubbished the allegations that the appointments of Deputy EXCO Members are wastes of resources and money as he wanted all MLAs to be given roles to work with him on developing the state. On 6 April 2023, he demoted Low Chee Leong and Zaidi Attan to Deputy EXCO Members. Both of them previously served as EXCO Members. Demotion is rare in the Malaysian politics. After announcing the lineup of Deputy EXCO Members, he invited the two Melaka Opposition and PN MLAs to join his government in an effort to form a unity government, which is a government that has no opposition and comprises all Melaka MLAs. If it is done, it would be the first ever unity government in Melaka and Malaysia.[22] He also added that he preferred finding similarities with Jailani than taking action against him. However, on 7 April 2023, his invitation was turned down by State Leader of the Opposition Mohd Yadzil Yaakub as they would like to check and balance the state government and not cross over for personal interests.[23]\\n\" ]\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia…aji_Abdillah.jpg\n\nAbang_Haji_Abdillah\n\n[ \"\\n\", \"Datu Patinggi Abang Haji Abdillah (13 October 1862 – 21 November 1946) was a Malaysian politician in Sarawak who participated in the movement opposing cessation to the British Empire. He was the son of Datu Bandar Abang Haji Mohammad Kassim; who served as mayor of Kuching under the White Rajah's administration. He was also the grandson of Datu Bandar Abang Haji Bolhassan and a descendant of Datu Patinggi Ali who fought to achieve Sarawak's independence from Brunei. After the death of his father in Mecca, in 1921, he was given the title Datu Muda. In 1924, he became the Datu Bandar and then in 1937 he was given the title Datu Patinggi.\\n\", \"\\nAbdillah stated his support for the anti-cession movement of Sarawak as such:\", \"\\\"My people and I would never agree with the cession of Sarawak to the British Crown!...We cherish the independence of this state where we were born...\\\"\\n\", \"\\\"Saya dan rakyat tidak bersetuju dengan penyerahan Sarawak kepada Tanah Jajahan Mahkota British!...Saya dan rakyat mencintai kemerdekaan negeri ini, tanah tumpah darah saya...\\\"\\n\", \"In a meeting with British officials, he protested the cession of Sarawak to the British Empire; claiming that the cession was illegal as it was not accepted by majority of the Sarawakian. Abdillah was a major proponent of reinstating Anthony Walter Dayrell Brooke as the fourth White Rajah of Sarawak. However, the cession occurred and he resigned from the State Supreme Council in response. He then started to oppose the British government in his speeches; however, Abdillah opposed the use of violence to prevent cessation. All government officials in Sarawak, European and Asian alike, were sent Circular no.9, which stated that they would be fired if any of them continued to support the anti-cession movement. Perhaps following the footsteps of Datu Patinggi, many of the Sarawakian officials resigned from their posts. Abdillah continued to oppose the cession of Sarawak to Britain until his death in 1946.[1][2]\\n\", \"As a community leader, Abdillah worked to establish good relations between the Dayaks and Malays. Unfortunately, after his death the anti-cession movement lost its momentum and quickly became disorganised without a leader. The violent techniques used by some anti-cessionists activists, such as assassinating colonial officials, decreased support for the movement. Britain ruled Sarawak until the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963.

In 1886 Andak received the Order of the Crown of Johor (DPMJ) (Second Class) and the honorific title of Dato’ Sri Amar DiRaja. Andak received the Order of the Crown of Johor (SPMJ) (First Class) in 1892 and was appointed State Secretary of Johor in 1893 with a seat on the State Council.\\n\", \"For twenty years he was advisor to Sultan Abu Bakar (Sultan of Johor 1862-1895) and Sultan Ibrahim (Sultan of Johor 1895-1959). Andak's influence over Sultan Abu Bakar lead to the Sultan becoming increasingly reluctant to accept British advice. Andak drafted the Johor Constitution, the first to be written by any of the Malay States, and which became law in 1894.[1][2] He represented Johor on behalf of the sultan leading an entourage to the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago following an invitation from the United States Consul-General to Singapore Rounsevelle Wildman.[3]\\n\", \"Andak was the founder of the Pakatan Belajar Mengajar Pengetahuan Bahasa (\\\"Language Knowledge Teaching Pact), a literary society which increased the usage of the Malay language and made it the official language of the government;[1] the body was also responsible for introducing neologisms expressing new ideas of governance brought with British influence.[4] It later became the Royal Society of Malay Literature of Johor.\\n\", \"A Freemason, he was initiated into the Lodge of St George No 1152 in Singapore in 1889.[5]\\n\", \"The British Government attempted to stop the government of Johor from receiving advice from its own Johor Advisory Board in London and also attempted to build a railway line across Johor. Seeing Andak as a threat to their plans, they also attempted to force his resignation. Cecil Clementi Smith wrote of him \\\"as a clever little fellow but an absolute nobody among the Malay aristocrats\\\". Other descriptions include \\\"corrupt\\\" and \\\"a mischievous little dog\\\". Frank Swettenham denigrated him as “a bad adviser for anyone, quite unscrupulous... and dangerous because he speaks English and has to do with Europeans all his life.\\\" Eventually he was dismissed by Sultan Ibrahim and sent into forced exile in London in April 1909 with an annual pension of £1,000. In England Andak oversaw the education of Sultan Ibrahim's sons Ismail (who succeeded his father as Sultan), Abu Bakar and Ahmad while they were attending schools in London.[1][2]\\n\", \"Andak married twice, firstly to Che' Lembek, who died in 1885 and with whom he had a daughter, Rahmah.

Ahmad Zaidi was an exceptionally bright student, who was always either first or second in class throughout his primary and secondary education. After his standard seven exam, he moved to Kuching to further his studies and joined St. Thomas school in 1936, where he graduated with a Junior Cambridge qualification in 1938. Out of 63 students, he was among the seven who passed – and of the seven, Ahmad Zaidi was the only bumiputera.

Chen died due to lung cancer on 3 September 1990.[2]\\n\" ]\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia…px-Chin_Peng.jpg\n\nChin_Peng\n\n[ \"\\n\", \"Chin Peng[a] (21 October 1924 – 16 September 2013[3]), born Ong Boon Hua,[b] was a Malayan communist guerilla leader and politician, who was the long-time leader of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA).\\n\", \"During World War II, he fought as an anti-colonialist guerrilla in the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army against the Japanese occupation of Malaya. He led the party's guerrilla insurgency in the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), fighting against British and Commonwealth forces in an attempt to establish an independent socialist state. After the MCP's defeat and subsequent Malayan independence, Chin waged a second campaign (1968–1989) from exile against the newly formed government of Malaysia in an attempt to replace its government with a socialist one. This second insurgency came to an end with the Peace Agreement of Hat Yai 1989.\\n\", \"Chin Peng died at the age of 88, in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was cremated according to Buddhist rites.\\n\", \"Chin Peng was born Ong Boon Hua on 21 October 1924 into a middle-class family in the small seaside town of Sitiawan, in Perak state, Malaya. His ancestral home is Fuqing, Fujian, China. His father went to live in Sitiawan in 1920. He set up a bicycle, tire, and spare motor parts business with the help of a relative from Singapore, known as Ong Lock Cho.[4]\\n\", \"Chin Peng attended a Chinese language school in Sitiawan. In 1937 he joined the Chinese Anti Enemy Backing Up Society (AEBUS), formed that year to send aid to China in response to Japan's aggression. According to Chin and Hack, he was not a communist then.[5] He was in charge of anti-Japanese activities at his school, and was reportedly a supporter of Sun Yat-sen. By early 1939, he had embraced Communism. He planned to go to Yan'an, the renowned communist base in China but was persuaded to remain in Malaya and take on heavier responsibilities in the newly formed Malayan Communist Party.\\n\", \"In late 1939, when Chin Peng was in the 4th year of his secondary school education (known as senior middle-level one), his school announced that the senior middle section was to be closed due to lack of funds. He decided to continue his education in the Methodist-run Anglo-Chinese Continuation School, which operated in English, because it provided a good cover for his underground activities. He did not want to have to move to Singapore to continue with his education in Chinese. He left the school \\\"for fear of British harassment\\\" after just 6 months.[6]\\nHe was now focused fully on his political activities and became, from that point on, a full-time revolutionary. In January 1940 he was put in charge of three anti-Japanese organisations that were targeting students, teachers, members of cultural activities, and general labourers. At the end of January 1940, he was admitted to the Malayan Communist Party as a member.[7]\\n\", \"Harassment by the authorities led him to leave his home town for Kuala Kangsar in July 1940. (This may be at the time when he left his school, refer to above). Later he spent a month in Taiping. In September 1940 the party posted him to Ipoh as a Standing committee member for Perak. In December he attained full Party membership.\\n\", \"In early 1941 AEBUS was dissolved. Chin Peng became Ipoh District committee member of the Party. \\\"He led student underground cells of three Chinese secondary schools and the Party's organisations of the shop assistants, domestic servants of European families, workers at brick kilns and barbers.\\\"\\n[7]\\n\", \"In June 1941 he became a member of the Perak State Committee.\\n\", \"Chin Peng rose to prominence during World War II when many Chinese Malayans took to the jungle to fight a guerrilla war against the Japanese. These fighters, inspired by the example of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), became known as the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA). Chin Peng became the liaison officer between the MPAJA and the British military in South-East Asia.\\n\", \"The Japanese invasion of Malaya began in December 1941. In 1942 Chin was the youngest of three members of the Secretariat of the Perak State Committee: Su Yew Meng was secretary and Chang Meng Ching was the other member. In early 1943 the two senior members were captured by the Japanese, which left Chin Peng in charge. Contact with the Party's Central Committee had been lost; he attempted to re-establish it, travelling to Kuala Lumpur and meeting Chai Ker Meng. Later, party leader Lai Tek sent another Central Committee member, Lee Siow Peng (Siao Ping), to replace Chin as State Secretary. However, Lee Siow Peng was captured not long after while travelling to a meeting that was to be held in Singapore.[citation needed]\\n\", \"Thus the job of establishing contact with the British commando Force 136 fell to Chin Peng. The first party of that force, consisting of Capt. John Davis and five Chinese agents had landed in Malaya on 24 May 1943, by submarine. Chin Peng made contact with this armed group on 30 September 1943. He was active in his support for the British stay-behind troops but had no illusions about their failure to protect Malaya against the Japanese. In the course of this activity, he came into contact with Freddie Spencer Chapman, who called him a 'true friend' in his Malayan jungle memoir, 'The Jungle Is Neutral'.\\n\", \"In recognition of his service during the war, Chin was awarded an OBE[2] (though it was subsequently withdrawn later by the British government), a mention in despatches and two campaign medals by Britain. He was elected the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Malaya after the betrayal of previous leader Lai Tek, who had turned out to be an agent for both the British and the Japanese and had denounced the leadership of the Party to the Japanese secret police. Chin Peng was the most senior surviving member.\\n\", \"In 1948, the Federation of Malaya Plan replaced the Malayan Union plan, frustrating the CPM as they felt the plan was undemocratic and biased towards the Malay elites. They accused the British of forcing the Federation idea on the people by portraying it as a constitutional solution to Malaya's crisis.[8][9] According to Chin, the central committee still adhered to Lai Teck's peace struggle strategy in facing the Federation, as they thought that the people of Malaya were still recovering from the horrors of the Japanese Occupation. To launch an armed rebellion so soon would not only cause them to lose the mass support they had been enjoying but, at the same time, also drive the already wary Malays to openly resist them.[10][11][12]\\n\", \"Some scholars allege that the CPM received secret directives from Moscow agents on the methods and timing for a near-simultaneous uprising against colonial authorities during the Southeast Asian Youth Conference held in Calcutta on 19 February 1948 which eventually caused the CPM's insurrection. Chin denied it, stating that the conference argued against such a move. Laurence Sharkey, party secretary of the Australian Communist Party, informed Chin and the central committee of the conference's decision while stopping over in Singapore on his way home.[13][14] In March 1948, the central committees were discussing new policies as the labour strikes were not bringing the results that they hoped for. Chin Peng estimated it would be a year or two before the British took actions against the CPM, leaving them ample time to prepare for a guerrilla war.[15][16]\\n\", \"On 12 June 1948, the colonial government outlawed the burgeoning trade union federations amid a rising atmosphere of tension. Since then, there was no reduction in the level of violent activities, other than the neutralisation of trade unions. Political murders of informers, anyone found to be working against the labour movement or the CPM, non-Europeans considered enemies to the communist cause or strike-breakers who used thugs and gangsters to harass protesters rose.[17] The murder of three Kuomintang leaders in Johor on 12 June had convinced the British that the communists were escalating the conflict in retaliation for outlawing the trade unions, while in the CPM's eyes these murders were just purely acts of intimidation. Chin again claimed that he was not aware of the murders at the time, although he approved of the later killing of the plantation managers who he claimed were harsh and cruel towards farmworkers.[17][18]\\n\", \"On 16 June 1948, three European plantation managers were murdered in Sungai Siput, which has generally been identified as the incident contributing to the Malayan colonial administration declaration of a state of emergency. Rather, Sze-Chieh Ng argued these murders were merely the final catalyst for a long-brewing crisis that had been going on since the trade unions began agitating in 1945. Historian Anthony Short feels that this was more of a panic reaction than a carefully considered move. According to him, the government had been powerless to deal with the unrest plaguing Malaya since 1945. According to Purcell's viewpoint, the Emergency was declared in response to increasing incidents of violence and lawlessness.[19][20][21]\\n\", \"Many Singaporean historians and anti-communists allege that Chin Peng ordered the killings. Chin claimed he had no prior knowledge of the plot. He added that he barely escaped arrest, losing his passport in the process, and he lost touch with the Party for a couple of days.[22] Chin became the most wanted man of the British government, with the government offering a reward of $250,000 for his capture. On 17 July 1948, CPM offices in Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Singapore, and other major cities were raided, followed by mass arrests of suspected communists and anti-government individuals on 21 July.[23] The CPM was banned in July 1948.\\n\", \"In response to the Emergency and the mass arrests of its members, the CPM issued a call to its members to revive its disbanded wartime resistance army, the MPAJA, to take up arms again and escape to the jungles.[24] In fact, since late May and early June the communists had been secretly setting up platoons in several states in preparation for an expected British crackdown in September. The sudden declaration of the Emergency in June, however, forced the MCP to hasten its plan, and they appealed to comrades and volunteers to join them in the struggle.[19] The new guerrilla army, now known as the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), spent the first year of the Emergency reconsolidating and rearming.[23]\\n\", \"At that time, the CPM was in chaos. Its members were dispersed in the jungle and operated without any command structure or central leadership. According to Chin, attacks were being carried out without his approval or knowledge and there was no coordination among units. The guerrillas endured heavy casualties were but made few or no strategic gains in those early months.[25] Chin was desperate to assert control over the MNLA, which had been operating independently since June. It was not until August that some form of central authority was finally set up in the Cameron Highlands, with Chin ordering the guerrillas to adopt Mao Zedong's strategy of establishing liberated zones whenever they drove British forces from an area.[26] However, this strategy failed. British forces continued to hound the guerrillas, who were often forced to retreat deeper into the jungles and disperse into smaller units. This was due to difficulties in resupply. Moreover large units risked being detected and annihilated by British patrols.[27]\\n\", \"Furthermore, the CPM was losing civilian support, and lacking material assistance and intelligence, the party suffered. Chin admitted they had wrongly assumed that the people would be willing support his men, as they had done during World War II. When that failed to happen, they resorted to force to satisfy their needs.[28]\\n\", \"The CPM and MNLA also suffered under British propaganda, which labelled them \\\"bandits\\\" and \\\"communist terrorists\\\". Old suspicions and assumptions that the CPM had clandestine support from either the CCP or the Soviet Union had, over time, hardened into certainty.[29] Records disclosed after the Cold War ended have finally disproved the convenient lie the British propagated more than half a century ago, revealing not only that the CPM had not sought external support but also that no agents from either China or Russia had even made contact with them. The only ‘support’ Chin recalled obtaining was the encouraging news that Mao's guerrillas had defeated Chiang Kai-shek's well-equipped and numerically superior KMT army in 1949.[30][31]\\n\", \"In 1950, a series of strategies were introduced by the Director of Operations for the anti-communist war in Malaya, Lt. General Sir Harold Briggs, that later became known as the Briggs Plan.[32] The plan, which aimed to defeat the guerrillas by cutting off their sources of civilian support, was a success. The creation of ‘New Villages’ under this plan restricted intelligence and food supplies for the CPM, and thus had a devastating effect on the guerrillas.[33] Chin was well aware of this fact, since several times he nearly starved during those twelve years.[34]\\n\", \"After several reviews and amendments, the CPM ordered the guerrillas to cease sabotage and terror operations and to develop closer ties with the middle-class to preserve their organizational strength.[33] Chin would later admit in an interview in 1999 that this directive was a mistake as it allowed the British to press on with their attacks on the MNLA, whom they correctly assessed to be quite demoralised by then.[35]\\n\", \"After Sir Harold Briggs died, Lt. General Sir Gerald Templer was appointed as the new commander, introducing aggressive strategies which differed from the Briggs Plan. These included interrogations, food rationing, large monetary rewards for captured or killed communists coupled with intense military operations, and the mobilisation of a large number of troops to hound the guerrillas.[36][37] In 1953, the CPM relocated their headquarters to Betong, in southern Thailand. They reestablished its networks to connect the scattered units and review its strategy.[38][39]\\n\", \"In late 1953 and early 1954, the war was at a semi-stalemate due to both the MNLA and the British being unable to decisively defeat one another.[40] In early 1954, Siao Chang, a top CPM leader who had been sent to Beijing in late 1952 to deepen his Marxist–Leninist education while also serving as liaison to the CCP, announced a new direction for the party, which was to abandon the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Malaya and join with other Malayan political parties in a legal fight for Malaya independence.[41] Chin described Siao as the CPM's ‘insurance policy’ in the event the central committee was eliminated.[42]\\n\", \"Although this was not their decision, Chin and the other central committees decided to join the other Malayan parties, reasoning that the Malay politicians had achieved more for the independence movement within the last few years than the MNLA had since 1948. The Beijing announcement also revealed to the CPM that both the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China had viewed the armed struggle in Malaya as untenable.[43][42][44]\\n\", \"On 24 September 1955, Chin wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to negotiate peace. On 17 October, talks between two government representatives and Chin Peng and another central committee of the CPM were held at Klian Intan.[45] A new ‘Eight Point Program’ was introduced by the CPM to call for an end to the Emergency and a cessation of hostilities, a reform of Malaya's political system, expand democratic rights, support for world peace, and attention to other matters including education, health, welfare, and industrial production.\\n\", \"On 28 and 29 December 1955, the negotiations reached their peak at the small northern town of Baling in Kedah. Representatives from the Government were Tunku Abdul Rahman, David Marshall, the Chief Minister of Singapore, and Sir Tan Cheng Lock, the leader of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA). The CPM was represented by Chin Peng, Chen Tian, and Abdul Rashid bin Maidin. The first day of the talks did not go well, as Chin wanted the CPM to be recognised as a legal party again, or for the leaders and members of the MNLA to at least be allowed to regain their freedom of movement and not face any legal persecution or imprisonment.[46] Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this request and demanded at the beginning of the meeting that the CPM fully surrender as the only way to peace, but then promised that those who surrendered would undergo a period of rehabilitation before being allowed to become free citizens again.[46]\\n\", \"Chin again argued freedom of thought and choice must be recognised by the Malayan government if the new nation was to survive past its independence, as the people should have the right to decide which political path the nation should take rather than having that choice be decided by a select few in the government.[46] Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this as well and only promised freedom for the CPM members to join any existing political party after being cleared by the authorities.[46]\\n\", \"On the second day of the talks, Chin promised that the CPM would stop fighting and lay down its arms if the Alliance government persuaded the British government to grant it authority over internal security and defence.[47] Tunku Abdul Rahman accepted it as a challenge and promised that he would push for it on his upcoming trip to London.[48] Great publicity was given in the media to this dramatic challenge from Chin Peng. The challenge, indeed, served to strengthen the Alliance government's bargaining position at the London talks. Anxious to end the Emergency, the British government agreed to concede those powers of internal security and defence and to accede to the demand for independence for Malaya by 31 August 1957, if possible.[49] Chin claimed it was his challenge to Tunku Abdul Rahman that hastened the independence of Malaya.[49] Tunku Abdul Rahman had acknowledged the importance of the Baling talks, writing in 1974 that \\\"Baling had led straight to Merdeka (Independence).\\\"[49]\\n\", \"Regardless, the talks themselves ended without a consensus between the two sides. The talks finally collapsed but were regarded as both a success and failure for Tunku Abdul Rahman, as the talks made the British regard him as a strong leader who was tough on communism. His performance had also impressed the Colonial Office enough to grant Malaya independence. For the CPM, it was a very demoralising affair that nearly destroyed their already ailing struggle.[48] The failure of the Baling Talks was a great blow for the CPM, since they now lost hope both of ending the war and of propagating their ideology. Due to the mounting combat casualties and the insecurity of food supplies, the members began surrendering to the government in exchange for monetary rewards and pardons.[50]\\n\", \"In 1956, Chin wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to resume negotiations. This was rejected by Rahman in a broadcast on 2 April. By late 1958, the MNLA had lost almost 88% of its men, declining from an approximately 3000-strong army when they first rebelled in mid-1948 to no more than 350 men, as a result of casualties and surrenders.[51][52][53]\\n\", \"In 1959, the central committees of CPM decided to demobilise their activities and to have the guerrillas reintegrate into society while continuing to promote their communist ideals until such a time when they could once again rise up in revolt.[51] Chin then moved to south Thailand with the remnants of his forces during the latter part of the Emergency due to pressure from the Malayan security forces, which by 1952 totalled over 32,000 regular troops in Malaya, about three-fifths of whom were Europeans from the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.[54]\\n\", \"In 1961, members of the CPM central committee such as Chin Peng, Chen Tien, and Lee An Tung moved to Beijing to seek political advice and guidance from the more experienced Chinese Communist Party.[51] Chin would, however, remain in Beijing for the next 29 years and the party would not lay down its arms until 1989. The reasons for this reversal of the party's decision to disband, according to Chin, was the advice given to him by the Vietnamese communist leaders in Hanoi, the opening of the second ‘Vietnam War’, which was followed by China's Cultural Revolution, all of which stressed a strong militant line to be taken by Asian communist parties.[55]\\n\", \"While in Beijing, Chin Peng was also advised by Deng Xiaoping, to continue the armed struggle in Malaya as Deng felt the time was ripe for revolutions to take place in Southeast Asia.[56] Deng insisted that the military struggle should not only be maintained but stepped up.[57] Deng even promised financial support to the CPM if they should take up arms once again.[56] Deng offered for this to remain a secret as the CCP did not wish to let it be known that they had been actively supporting Southeast Asia's communist movements. Chin reluctantly decided to acquiesce to Deng's suggestion. This was also the first time that the CPM had accepted foreign assistance in its struggle and it was with this financial backing that the second armed struggle in Malaya would be launched in 1968.[56]\\n\", \"Meanwhile, back in Malaya, the Malayan government had declared the Emergency over on 31 July 1960 once they became confident the MNLA had ceased to be a credible threat, with the surviving guerrillas retreating to their sanctuary in southern Thailand.[56] However, the insurgency continued with the insurgents increasing their attacks, ambushing military convoys, bombing national monuments, and assassinations of marked police officers and political ‘enemy targets’. The insurgency, which began as a war against the British colonialists, was now transformed into a war against ‘federalists, compressors capitalists and lackeys of British imperialism’.[55] The Malayan government maintained a high-security alert by devoting one-third of its national budget to defence and internal security needs and requested British, Australian and New Zealand troops to remain in the country until its internal security and national armed forces could be built up and the foreign troops gradually phased out.[55]\\n\", \"In 1970, the CPM's guerrilla bases in Thailand were hard hit by the trials and executions of supposed spies. Two breakaway factions were formed which condemned the purge. Chin, who was then based in China, denied involvement and later rehabilitated his accused comrades.[58] During the 1970s and 1980s, the CPM intensified its activities and clashes with the security forces. These activities were due to a rivalry among three factions in the CPM over party purges and strategies, with each faction trying to outdo the other in militancy and violence.[59]\\n\", \"However, in 1980, Deng Xiaoping refocused his priorities back on the Chinese bureaucracy after his return to power in 1978. He welcomed Lee Kuan Yew, the then-Prime Minister of Singapore and its leading political figure since independence from Malaysia, in a visit to Beijing.[57] Chin recalled that Deng had not bothered to meet him since then. Finally, in December 1980, Deng summoned Chin. In the meeting, Deng demanded Chin to immediately close down all the CPM's radio stations which were broadcasting from China to Malaysia. When Chin asked Deng when he would like him to cease the broadcasting, Deng replied, \\\"The sooner the better ... Lee (Lee Kuan Yew) asked me to stop the broadcasts immediately.\\\"[57] Moreover, during his official visit to China, the second Prime Minister of Malaysia Tun Abdul Razak held talks with Chinese communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong and urged him to stop giving aid to the CPM. The fourth Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad further succeeded in persuading China to downgrade its ties with the CPM. This was an important factor that contributed to the CPM's decision to end its armed struggle.[59][60]\\n\", \"The CPM finally laid down its arms in 1989. The death toll during the armed conflict totalled thousands. Those sympathetic to Chin Peng tend to portray the violence perpetrated by the CPM as defensive, while right-wing opponents tend to portray it as aggressive and unethical. Some have claimed a large number of civilian casualties was in contrast to the stance adopted by Mao Zedong and his policy of the Eight Points of Attention.\\n\", \"On 2 December 1989, at the town of Hat Yai in Southern Thailand, Chin, Rashid Maidin, and Abdullah CD met with representatives of the Malaysian and Thai governments. Separate peace agreements were signed between the MCP and both governments. One of the terms of the agreement was that MCP members of Malayan origin be allowed to return to live in Malaysia.\\n\", \"When all hostilities ceased, the total number of CPM members was 1,188; 694 were Thai-born and 494 claimed origins in Peninsular Malaysia. They were given a temporary grant and promised integration into Malaysia.[57]\\n\", \"In Chin's opinion, peace could have been achieved as early as 1955 during the Baling Talks, if the British, Tunku Abdul Rahman and David Marshall had not demanded that the communist fighters capitulate and surrender but, rather, had allowed them to hand over or destroy their weapons in a mutually agreed way and then resume normal life with full political freedom, which was the broad outcome of the 1989 accords.[61]\\n\", \"Chin never officially returned to Malaysia after the 1989 Hat Yai Peace Accords but continued his exile in Thailand. He gave lectures at the National University of Singapore in 2004, using purposes of academic research as his reason to gain visitation permission from the Singaporean government. At the beginning of 2000, he applied for permission to return to Malaysia. His application was rejected by the High Court on 25 July 2005.\\n\", \"In June 2008, Chin again lost his bid to return to Malaysia when the Court of Appeal upheld an earlier ruling that compelled him to show identification papers to prove his citizenship. Chin maintained that his birth certificate was seized by the police during a raid in 1948. His counsel Raja Aziz Addruse had submitted before the Court of Appeal that it was wrong for the Malaysian government to compel him to produce the documents because he was entitled to enter and live in Malaysia under the peace agreement.\\n\", \"On April 2009, Chin's application to return to Malaysia was once again rejected by the High Court for the same reason as his previous attempt. The Malaysian government insisted that his possible return would cause people who lost their loved ones during the Emergency to relive their pain again.[62]\\n\", \"In November 2009, Chin issued an apology to the victims and their family members for the atrocities committed by the CPM.[63] However, the then-Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Muhyiddin Yassin, replied that despite Chin's apology, he would still not be allowed to return to Malaysia due to his treason.[64]\\n\", \"Before his death, he lived in exile in Thailand. Contrary to one of the conditions of the 1989 peace agreement, he was not permitted to return to Malaysia.[citation needed]\\n\", \"Chin died of cancer at the age of 88 at a private hospital in Bangkok, with only his 50-year-old niece by his side, on the morning of 16 September 2013, the 50th anniversary of Malaysia Day,[65] and the 90th birthday of Lee Kuan Yew. He was cremated according to Buddhist rites.[citation needed]\\n\", \"While Chin had previously voiced wishes to be buried in Sitiawan, his remains continued to be denied entry for burial in Malaysia by the Malaysian government, as it was claimed that the one-year window after the agreement to reapply for citizenship had long lapsed and Chin was assumed to have relinquished his rights to return.[66] In November 2019, his remains were announced to have been returned in secrecy by a small action committee on 16 September 2019; his ashes were ceremoniously transported through Sitiawan before scattering at a hillside near Chemor and at sea.[67]\\n\", \"Chin Peng co-authored his story with Singapore-based writers and publishers Ian Ward, who was formerly the Southeast Asia correspondent for the London conservative newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, and Ward's wife Norma Miraflor.

She was politically active in the anti-cession movement of Sarawak, a nationalist movement in the 1940s attempted to retrieve Sarawak's independence from takeover by Britain. This movement had helped in politicising local people besides cultivating national spirit in people of Sarawak.[3]\\n\", \"Lily Eberwein Abdullah was a Eurasian by birth, having European and Malay ancestry. Her father, John Eberwein, a Eurasian of Dutch and Scottish descent from Cocos Islands, was a relative of the Clunies-Ross family, rulers of that island. Lily's father captained the ship Rajah Brooke for the Straits Steamship Company.[4] Her mother was a local Malay woman, Maznah bt. Ali bin Alang of Simanggang. They lived in Singapore where they had two children, Lily and Edward. Maznah was a practising Muslim, but Lily and Edward had a Christian upbringing. Lily had her early education at St. Mary's Mission School in Kuching, Sarawak until she was eight years old and continued her study at Raffles Girls’ School in Singapore.\\n\", \"After her father's death, Lily returned to Kuching with her mother and continued her study until Standard Seven (equivalent to Form Three, age 15) at St. Mary's Mission School. Her father's death completely changed her family's lifestyle. Lily had to adjust to a Muslim Malay upbringing, denoted by the addition of Abdullah to her name. In an interview, her daughter, Hafsah Harun, explained that her mother's upbringing was different from that of other Malay girls. Having had a European lifestyle in Singapore, when she returned to Kuching she missed her previous freedom and found it difficult to start covering her head and be confined to the house. She had been accustomed to having male servants to serve her when her father was still alive in Singapore, but back in Kuching she had to serve her uncles. Furthermore, being an educated woman she was very outspoken and independent. Lily converted to Islam in 1913. Her knowledge about her new religion impressed her neighbours, to the extent that many people in the village sent their sons to Lily to learn to read the Quran. This gesture showed that the people in the village trusted her and respected her highly as women were rarely consulted for religious teaching in that era. She had become accepted, and identified herself, as a Muslim Malay.\\n\", \"In 1927, the Director of a telephone company, Mr Tate, recruited Lily Eberwein to work as a telephone operator, making her the first Malay woman to work in a Government Department.[4] She had an excellent command of both Malay and English, as was required of a telephone operator, and her father had been a family friend of Mr. Tate's.\\n\", \"In 1929, she resigned from this post when the Brooke Government appointed her as the Principal of the Permaisuri Malay Girls’ School, which was opened in Kuching in 1930.[4] She was also the secretary of the Malay section, while Mary Ong, Barbara Bay and Mrs. Gopal headed Chinese, Iban and Indian section. Through her educational activities, both religious and secular, she became known as Cikgu (teacher) Lily. Noticeably, she was over the age for marriage at that time.\\n\", \"She married in 1938 and proceeded to have three daughters, with the first, Hafsah, being born in 1940. Her husband, Harun bin Haris, was ten years her junior, with only five years of primary education, and worked in the Sarawak Police Constabulary. Her husband was very supportive of her involvement in the Anti-Cession movement and her passion for education. In Sarawak at that time, being married at a later age and having a much younger husband would definitely have been controversial. However, Lily seemed to be able to take it all in her stride. She was highly respected, especially among Malay people because of her dedication to educating Malay girls.\\n\", \"During the Japanese occupation in Sarawak, the Japanese appointed Lily as the leader of the Malay section of the Kaum Ibu, a multiethnic women's association. In March 1947, she was elected as the chairperson of the women's wing of the Malay National Union of Sarawak(PKMS), a leading group in the Anti-Cession Movement. Lily resigned from her post as the principal of Permaisuri Girls School in 1947 as a sign of protest against the Cession but she continued her role as an educationalist by establishing new schools.\\n\", \"As the anti-cession struggle continued, many Malay government schools were closed. This became a serious concern as affected students could not find places in other Malay schools. Four schools in Kuching and another in Sibu were established by those teachers who resigned. To assist children of resigned public servants who boycotted government schools, Lily helped to establish a religious school for girls and women (sekolah rakyat) in the premise of the Masjid Bintangor Haji Taha Building. Lily and teachers who resigned in protest against the circular taught in these schools without pay.\\n\", \"In an interview by The Straits Times Singapore dated 21 July 1947 on the Anti-Cession movement, Lily Eberwein expressed her concern for its impact on Malay education. In the article entitled “Education Standstill”, Lily stated that the protest against cession had had the most serious effect on education, which was virtually at a standstill. She emphasised that the position of education in Sarawak must remain a matter of gravest public concern “for as long as this unhappy controversy lasts”, referring to cession. She also stated, “We Malays, in conjunction with the other indigenous races, will fight with unwavering purpose for the redress of the wrong that has been done to our people in the extinction of our nationhood and independence”. In the article she clearly identified herself as a member of the Malay community and with the cause of Sarawak's national independence, but also expresses her concern about the effects of the nationalist struggle on education and thus on the people of Sarawak. In Anthony Brooke's memoir, he clearly recognised the importance of the women's role in the Anti-Cession movement. He specifically highlighted Lily Eberwein's effort, stating that: “a new impetus was given to the movement due to the initiative head teacher Lily Eberwein, who formed a women’s branch of the movement. This met with considerable support from women of all ages from throughout the count.”\\n\", \"Although Lily Eberwein was a very active anti-cessionist, she never joined any political parties. Nevertheless, she was the first woman to be appointed as a Councillor of Kuching Municipal Council in 1950. She was a pioneer for women in public life in Sarawak. She participated actively in various voluntary organisations such as the Prisoners’ Aid Society, Anti-Tuberculosis Association Sarawak (ATAS), and the Red Cross. She remained the Chairman of Kaum Ibu in the Malay National Union of Sarawak until 1960 when she also retired from her own school, Satok English School. Occasionally after that she assisted her daughter Hafsah Harun who replaced her as the school Principal.\\n\" ]\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/V94HtJm/ellron.jpg\n\nEllron_Alfred_Angin\n\n[ \"\\n\", \"Ellron Alfred Angin (born 15 July 1958) is a Malaysian politician who has been the State Minister of Rural Development briefly in 2018 and currently the incumbent State Minister of Youth and Sports since 2020.
