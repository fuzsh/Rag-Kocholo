        "text": "August 23, 2015\n\nCOMMENT:There is hope and there is despair when we contemplate a unity government as an alternative to present regime led by our 1Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak.\n\nThe Unity government idea is interesting if such a concept can be brought into practice quickly since time is critical for us to bring Malaysians together to deal with our economic problems.\n\nIn reality it cannot be done since it involves putting together political parties of different ideologies and conflicting interests. Compromise cannot lead to a sustainable outcome. It is a committee of political parties turning a horse into a camel. Can Ku Li be the man who will ride this odd camel? I have no doubt that he has stature and experience as a politician and an outstanding corporate manager.Hence my despair.\n\nWe have seen this unity concept in Pakatan Rakyat itself. It could not even agree on a shadow Cabinet. It was created after the 2008 General Election as a coalition of equals. Today with the breakup of PAS, Pakatan Rakyat remains only in name. Why? Because they cannot agree to disagree. Hadi wants to be Prime Minister. He also wants Hudud. Anwar Ibrahim has not abandoned his hope for the top job in Putrajaya. DAP won’t compromise on Hudud. PKR tries to keep PAS and DAP at loggerheads to ensure Anwar Ibrahim remains relevant.\n\nBarisan Nasional, on the other hand, has survived all these years because UMNO is the dominant partner with MCA, MIC, Gerakan and others in the coalition playing minor roles. UMNO will not accept a unity government where its dominance will be diminished. In order to retain its hegemonic power, UMNO must now solve its leadership problem and reform itself. Otherwise, it will be the next opposition if it allows Najib to remain President and Prime Minister.\n\nWill UMNO members act to save the party from corruption and blatant abuses of power and the country from an impending crisis, or will they allow their incumbent President to continue as the Prime Minister in the knowledge that Najib Razak is already taking the country down the road to perdition and their party to extinction?\n\nIf they choose the latter option, UMNO members know what the consequences can be on themselves and their families, the party and the country.\n\nIn my view, Najib is an UMNO problem first and a national nightmare second.If the Najib problem is resolved, the nightmare will disappear to enable us to focus on rebuilding our country ground up. Let us not complicate things with this unity government idea unless we are reasonably certain that it can be formed urgently to deal with our economic and political malaise. I have my doubts.–Din Merican.\n\nMalaysia:The Politics of Compromise–The Unity Government Model\n\nby Terence Netto@www.malaysiakini.com\n\nIf politics is the art of the possible, compromise is its blood plasma. If Malaysia’s politics is stalemated between an UMNO-BN that is reflexively – though not monolithically – for Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak to continue in office and an opposition which knows that the longer he stays the more decrepit the system becomes, then the avenue is open to a compromise that will ease the country out of its present economic and political malaise.\n\nJust as the formation of the Barisan Nasional (BN) four decades ago was a compromise that was regarded as an amelioration of the politics of that time, the required compromise to eject Najib would be a palliation of the fraught circumstances that presently obtain.\n\nOne won’t arrive at that compromise from an attitude that holds ‘What’s mine is sacrosanct, what’s yours is negotiable.’Both sides must think anew and act anew for the stakes are no less than the pulling back of the country from the precipice on which it is precariously perched.\n\nFor cooperation between BN dissenters and an opposition united on removing Najib, the two sides need to relent on core demands and meet halfway.\n\nThere’s a leader available in Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, the UMNO MP for Gua Musang, around whom the sides that need to come together can readily rally.\n\nHe has the economic acumen and enough practical political sense to manage the compromises that need to be struck in order to make the bargain between a rump BN and a united opposition work.\n\nHis non-partisan stature, non-confrontational style, and an ability to move matters along without dealing with the substance of the issues raised would be critical to the whole outcome.\n\nIt’s not that he does not have the substance to deal with the issues, but some matters are better left to the adjudication of a later day.\n\nUnder Ku Li’s stewardship\n\nAt a wisened 78 years, Razaleigh has accumulated the experiential wisdom to differentiate between what can be accomplished in the 33 months to the next general election (GE14) and what has to wait.\n\nMeanwhile, our straitened economy and sulferous politics demand immediate nostrums. And that Ku Li, as he is popularly known, can provide on the strength of his past as finance minister, his knowledge of our economic history, and on the basis of prescriptions he voiced in periodic disquisitions on the state of the nation over the past eight years.\n\nMen of destiny have their starts; Ku Li had his in being the scion of Kelantan’s first appointed Menteri Besar.\n\nHe would have been prime minister of Malaysia had presumption not undid him earlier in his career when as a formidably popular Umno vice-president, he had the No 1 post well within his grasp.\n\nBut he didn’t reckon with a scheming Mahathir – nobody could – among whose strengths was shrewd calculation of the impact of competitors’ weaknesses and how these can be levered to his advantage.\n\nBut now all that is water under the bridge and Mahathir needs to recognise that it is Ku Li who can pull it off – our withdrawal from the precipice towards which the country is galloping with Najib in charge.\n\nIf we are not already a failed state, we are headed to being one, under Najib’s continued stewardship. You know you have consensus on that score when opinion makers as divergent as the fervently pro-UMNO columnist Kadir Jasin and DAP adviser Lim Kit Siang agree that the ship of state is at a precarious pass.\n\nCometh a national unity government\n\nThe dissenters in UMNO must atone for the party’s reckless abandon in allowing a person with Najib’s baggage to become PM.Now he cannot leave office for fear that what possibly awaits him in retirement.\n\nThis was not what UMNO’s two previous prime ministerial retirees-under-duress had to face: Tunku Abdul Rahman and Abdullah Ahmad Badawi quit rather than see the party erupt from fracticide if they had chosen to stay.\n\nIt was graceful of them to yield what they could no longer withhold.In the perspective of the intervening years, and in light of the current occupant’s obduracy, their withdrawals must be seen as just graceful but, more importantly, as virtuous.\n\nVirtuous atonement by primarily UMNO (and BN) dissenters for the irresponsibility of allowing a leader with baggage to become PM would presently take the form of agreement to back the no-confidence motion against the government at the next session of Parliament.\n\nMature recognition by a united opposition of the precariousness of the country’s situation would take the form of joining a rump of BN in not only supporting the no-confidence motion, but also backing a subsequent government of national unity Ku Li’s steering.\n\nA united opposition need only demand that the Election Commision must be headed by a new chairperson of proven impartiality and that all future judicial appointments be persons of the calibre of Justice Hishamuddin Yunos.\n\nThose two demands would be sufficient to place the opposition in as advantageous a position for GE14 as they cannot under a continued premiership by Najib.\n\nCometh the hour, cometh Ku Li and a necessitous government of national unity"
