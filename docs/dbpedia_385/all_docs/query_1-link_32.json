        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, May 27 — Gerakan’s Tan Keng Liang said today that PKR and DAP cannot distance themselves from PAS’s controversial bid to introduce hudud, saying the trio’s coexistence in the Selangor government showed continued ties among the former allies.\n\nTan, who is Gerakan Youth chief, also pointed out that the DAP had campaigned for PAS in Election 2013 when the two were still partners in the now defunct Pakatan Rakyat (PR) pact.\n\n“In last GE, DAP asked ppl to vote PAS. And they r still together in Selangor govt. Pls be responsible & don’t try blame others @cmlimguaneng,” the politician wrote on Twitter.\n\n“Will DAP b accountable over their last GE move to ask ppl vote PAS? Will @limkitsiang @cmlimguaneng b responsible? Or divert & blame others?” he asked, tagging DAP father-and-son team Lim Guan Eng and Lim Kit Siang in the post.\n\nPAS’s long-anticipated Private Members’ Bill to amend the Shariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1965 [Act 355] finally made it to the Dewan Rakyat yesterday after several failed attempts but was later deferred at the request of its proposer, party president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang.\n\nAbdul Hadi was allowed to read out the Bill after a motion to expedite the matter was tabled by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said.\n\nAfter the deferment, DAP leaders were quick to voice their opposition to the Bill, which aims to enable the implementation of hudud in Kelantan.\n\nGuan Eng, who is DAP secretary-general, insisted that the proposed amendments were unconstitutional.\n\nKit Siang, DAP’s adviser and parliamentary leader, alleged that the Bill represented a new cooperation between Barisan Nasional (BN) and PAS that would have cost the ruling coalition some losses if raised during the Sarawak election earlier this month.\n\nTan, however, reminded both men of their existing ties with PAS. He posted on Twitter a photograph of Kit Siang and Abdul Hadi, both smiling as they moved to embrace one another.\n\n“Let’s not forget that PAS still have 3 EXCO members in Selangor govt. Both DAP & PKR still partnering PAS in Selangor,” he wrote in another posting.\n\n“Will DAP/PKR hoodwink ppl again to vote PAS in Sg Besar & K.Kangsar ...just like last GE? See consequences while DAP/PKR washing their hands,” he added, referring to the looming by-elections in the Selangor and Perak federal seats.\n\nTan also said that instead of merely criticising PAS and its hudud ambition, Gerakan had last year taken measures to try and stop the Islamist party from introducing the Islamic penal code.\n\nHe was referring to the attempt by several Gerakan members last year to challenge the Kelantan government’s jurisdiction to approve the law.\n\nLast October, however, the Federal Court rejected the bid after accepting the state government’s argument that only those affected by the Islamic penal code should mount such a challenge.\n\n“Gerakan done our best 2seek court interpretation. What DAP & PKR done besides still partnering PAS in Selangor govt & blame others? Politics,” Tan wrote.\n\nDAP, PKR and PAS were previously partners in PR but the pact was dissolved last year over a fallout between DAP and PAS over the latter party’s hudud plans.\n\nDAP and PKR have since formed a new coalition — Pakatan Harapan — with Parti Amanah Negara (Amanah), a new political party established among the more progressive members of Islamist PAS.\n\nPKR, however, has continued to maintain a cordial relationship with PAS, whose members still have seats in the Selangor administration along with the DAP."
