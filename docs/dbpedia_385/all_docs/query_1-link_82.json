        "text": "The parliamentary elections on 5 May 2013 did not fulfil the hopes of the opposition and their supporters for a change of government and new politics in Malaysia. The vehement commitment of civil society, the high turnout and country-wide gains for the opposition all provide clear evidence of the political awakening of the Malaysian people. The National Front has governed without interruption since Malaysia gained independence. For the first time, the National Front feared being voted out and was only narrowly able to ensure electoral victory with considerable losses. The increase of votes for the opposition is an indication that in the future two strong political blocks will compete for power in Malaysia. Malaysia’s multi-ethnic and multi-religious population is divided into those who support the status quo and those who want change. The government faces the challenge of reconciling society and finding a national consensus for Malaysia’s future development."
