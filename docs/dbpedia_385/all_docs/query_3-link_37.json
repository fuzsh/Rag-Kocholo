        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nParti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia was founded in 1968. Since then, we have been growing from strength to strength despite external constraints and internal problems. Through sincere leadership, pragmatic strategies and non-communal approaches, we have been successful in obtaining mass support to strive for an egalitarian united Malaysia characterized by racial harmony, social justice, economic equality, political democracy and cultural liberalism. As a relatively young party, we have encountered moments of triumph and anguish in our struggle.\n\nA youthful Dr Lim Chong Eu delivers a fiery speech in the 1960s\n\nWe have been complimented as well as criticized. But all the same, we have never faltered in our faith. Our honesty, integrity and ability have again and again been proven through deeds and words, both inside and outside the government sphere. Our receptivity to peoples criticism and advice, and our sensitivity to their needs and aspirations are the two major elements that make the party a dynamic and resilient political force in the national arena.\n\nThe Early Years, 1968-1972\n\nParti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia was formed on 24th March 1968. The six founders of the party were Professor Syed Hussain Alatas of the University of Singapore, Dr. David Tan Chee Khoon, Member of Parliament for Batu, Selangor and former leader of the Labour Party, Dr. J.B.A. Peter, President of the Malaysian Medical Association, Dr. Lim Chong Eu, Member of Parliament for Tanjong, Penang and former President of the United Democratic Party, Professor Wang Gungwu of the University of Malaya, and Mr. V. Veerapan, legal practitioner and former leader of the Labour Party. In its initial stage, the party had drawn its main support from members of the dissolved United Democratic Party, and the English-educated moderates of the Labour Party. Together they constituted an invaluable power base for further expansion.\n\nDr Lim and Professor Syed Hussein Alatas with supporters after Gerakans 1969 election victory\n\nAttempts were also made to establish a close rapport with trade unionists whose cosmopolitan postures were considered as essential in the crystallization of a truly multi-ethnic political party. As a result, Yeoh Teck Chye, President of the Malaysian Trade Union Congress and V. David, Secretary-General of the General Transport Workers Union were soon brought into party prominence. On 15th April 1968, the party held its inaugural meeting in Kuala Lumpur during which the objectives and policies of Gerakan were explicitly spelt out in a document tabled by the pro-tem Chairman, Professor Syed Hussain Alatas. Out of a total of sixteen members elected to the pro-tem committee five were Malays. And when the party was approved by the Registrar of Societies on 25th May 1968, the first Central Committee comprised six Malays, including two ladies, six Chinese and three Indians. Total membership was estimated at 1400, with 43 branches founded in mostly non-Malay urban centres.\n\nThe Gerakan -led Penang State Government Executive Committee was sworn-in on May 12, 1969\n\nConsolidation & Growth, 1973-1979\n\nAfter the internal schism had finally come to an end, the party was left with only about 15 active branches in the country with its headquarters in Penang. Party stalwarts under Dr. Lim Chong Eu soon began a strenuous exercise to put the wrecked organization into shape, and at the same time energize the rank and file to face greater challenges in future. They also set themselves the formidable task of setting up new branches and divisions which could only be accomplished through perseverance and hard work. Finally, when reorganization was completed, a new constitution was unanimously adopted at an Extraordinary Delegates Conference held on 14th January 1973. It was subsequently approved by the Registrar of Societies on 15th June of the same year, heralding the beginning of a reborn Gerakan.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Delegates Conference scheduled for October was delib erately postponed to March 1974 awaiting the announcement of an important development in the party. On 19th December 1973 it was announced by the Acting Chairman that Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, Paul Leong Khee Seong, Alex Lee Yu Lung, Dr. Tan Teong Hong, Soong Siew Hoong and thousands of former M.C.A. reformists had joined the party. As a result, during the years 1974 and 1975, a total of 71 new branches and 39 new divisions were established in the West Coast states of Peninsular Malaysia, chiefly Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Selangor, and were assimilated into the party structure. As a party fully committed to a Malaysian political philosophy, this orderly and disciplined expansion was certainly an invaluable asset to its struggle to create a just and prosperous society. Before long, many of these young and dynamic political activists were elected to important positions in the new Central Committee.\n\nA young Dr Lim Keng Yaik and his group of ex-MCA reformists joined Gerakan in 1973\n\nAs the 4th General Election drew near, coalition politics in Malaysia became institutionalized to reduce undesirable communal politicking. On 1st June 1974, the Barisan Nasional was formally registered to gear up for the forthcoming elections. On nomination day, a total of 8 party members were fielded on the Barisan ticket to contest for parliamentary seats and 18 others for the State Assemblies in Penang, Perak, Selangor and Kedah. The party campaigned on solidarity, equality and justice. In Penang, it focused its electioneering strategy on the states development performance and inter-ethnic co-operation. Despite the heavy attack launched by the Opposition, the party continued to be supported by the electorate and won 11 out of the 13 Penang state seats it contested. In the Parliamentary Election, it won all the 3 Penang seats allocated by the Barisan. Elsewhere, the returns were equally encouraging. It won 1 each in Perak, and Kedah State Elections, and 2 parliamentary seats in Perak.\n\nWith the new mandate given by the people, the party required its members to work more closely with the masses in order to represent their interests. And at all times, they would also provide guidance and leadership to unite the people of the country irrespective of their ethnic origin and to live and think together as brother citizens sharing a common Malaysian destiny. 12 branches and 1 division were added after 1975. Thus by 9th October 1976 when the National Delegates Conference was held at the Dewan Sri Pinang, Penang, more than 150 branches had been set up and registered in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\n1974: Shortly after the birth of Barisan Nasional, Dr Lim Chong Eu addresses an election rally in Penang in the presence of Tun Razak and other coalition leaders\n\nIn the period leading to the 1978 General Election the internal cohesion of the newly expanded Barisan Nasional was first jolted by the political developments in UMNO after Tun Razaks untimely death in 1976, and then by the expulsion of PAS from the Barisan Nasional in March 1978. Relations between our party and the MCA had also deteriorated over seat allocations in Penang. When Elections were announced, the party had not only to counter opposition allegations on the NEP, the Merdeka University and general administrative inefficiency, but also to face a treacherous Gang of Seven put up by the MCA in Penang to stand against Gerakan candidates. The results made known on the night of 8th July 1978 showed that the party had lost 3 of the 11 state seats, and 2 of the 3 parliamentary seats assigned to it in Penang. Nonetheless, Penang survived as the Gerakan bastion and Dr. Lim Chong Eu was appointed as the Chief Minister for the third term.\n\nIn the ensuing years, while envisaging and practising political co-operation in the spirit of Barisan Nasional and the Rukunegara, the party, however, ceaselessly urged the national leadership of the Barisan Nasional to grant more representation to Gerakan members in the District and Town Councils, in the JKKKs and in other statutory organizations throughout the country. Such measures were considered necessary to train emerging party activists to endear themselves to the public through selfless service, and also as a means to spread the partys message of creating an integrated society. The new Central Committee elected in May 1978 had weathered the storm of the General Election. It had now another arduous task of bargaining for wider representation of the Generasi Rakyat Malaysia Baru at all levels.\n\nUnity & Challenges, 1980-1989\n\nThe correctness of the partys non-communal stand was strikingly reflected in its horizontal and vertical concepts of expansion towards political influence and political power in the 1970s. When 1980 set in, the party, besides being the premier component in the Barisan Nasional Government in Penang, was wielding more and more influence at the national level. It enjoyed the confidence of the Barisan Nasional as a responsible partner. It also commanded the respect of the public as an efficient technocratic party through its representatives in the Federal and State Governments.\n\nAfter appraising the continuing growth of the party and its members adherence to the basic political ideology of uniting all- Malaysians, Dr. Lim Chong Eu, the respectable senior statesman of Malaysia, decided not to accept nomination for the post of National President to make way for the many young and capable leaders in our party. His announcement immediately caused some internal stir. It also precipitated some healthy campaigning by interested contenders. On 17th August 1980, when the 9th National Delegates Conference in Port Dickson entered its second day to elect a new Central Committee it was preceded by a Presidential Speech which advised all members to ensure party unity and organisational cohesiveness. In the election, Dr. Lim Keng Yaik became the new Party President for a term of four years, and Paul Leong Khee Seong, after being elected as the Deputy President without contest, pledged his support and co-operation with the same party office-bearers which included Ong Boon Seong as another Deputy President, Teh Ewe Lim as the Secretary-General and Dr. Goh Cheng Teik as the Deputy Secretary-General. Another revision to the Party Constitution was also approved by the Conference to promote cordial relationship between the members and party organisations of various levels. As such, unity was maintained and democracy upheld. The Port Dickson Spirit was thus born.\n\nConfronted with the many social, economic and political problems that were then gripping the nation, the new party leadership set about to strengthen and expand party membership, and at the same time, to attract committed intellectuals into the party. In the government sphere, it was decided that the Party President would continue to serve the people in his capacity as an Exco Member in the Perak State Government, and that his deputy would again be the party representative in the Federal Cabinet as the Minister of Primary Industries. Viewed as a strategy to enhance the partys political influence, such an arrangement had worked extremely well. It enabled Dr. Lim Keng Yaik to concentrate on party work and at the same time voice our views on national issues without fear or favour. It also enhanced our credibility in the Barisan Nasional Government through Paul Leong Khee Seongs many contributions to the countrys economic stability.\n\nAs a conscientious effort to further expand the party an open door policy was adopted by the liberal and democratic new leadership. This had led three groups of people to join the party during the years 1981-1985. The first was led by Michael Chen Wing Sum and ex-MCA members. This resulted in an upsurge of new members and the formation of many new branches and divisions in Perlis, Kedah, Johore, the Federal Territory and the East Coast states of Kelantan, Pahang and Trengganu in 1981 and 1982. Of much significance was the second group of Chinese educationists who had been closely associated with the United Chinese School Committees Association and the United Chinese School Teachers Association, popularly known in its Chinese acronym as the Dong Jiao Zong group. It included Kerk Choo Ting, Ong Tin Kim, Dr. Kang Chin Seng, Dr. Koh Tsu Koon and others. On joining the party on 31st March 1982, the group categorically stated its stand on language, education and culture to create an integrated Malaysia. It assumed the form of a joint statement with the Central Committee which promised to co-opt it as part and parcel of the partys political programme. Together with the Dong Jiao Zong group came along a group of young, concerned and committed intellectuals who would soon emerge as the think tank of the party with regards to its stand on national social, economic and political issues. The third group comprised well-known trade unionists headed by former CUEPACS President, T. Najendran. It helped to strengthen our relationship with the Malaysian working class.\n\nAnother milestone was achieved when the Central Committee appointed the National Organising Committee to organise the partys youth and women wings. To realise the noble aim of providing training ground for future leadership, Wanita Gerakan was launched in November, 1982 and Pemuda Gerakan in January 1983. A series of activities involving political and leadership training were held at both the national and regional levels. The activeness of the two movements had undoubtedly expanded the partys organisational base.\n\nMeanwhile, in Penang, with the completion of the Penang Bridge on 14th September 1985, the Pearl of the Orient entered a new phase of social and economic development under the Gerakan-led State Government. It was by then not only a state with one of the highest per capita GDP in the country, but also a centre of rich and diverse Malaysian culture. Parti Gerakans ideological commitment and technocratic strength are well demonstrated in Penang.\n\nWith these records and achievements, the party went to the polls in 1982 and 1986 to be gauged and evaluated by the people. Our honest, sincere, capable and responsible leadership won the masses trust and support in the countrys 6th Election in 1982. Though given a much reduced number of seats in the Penang State Election, we secured a 100% win by capturing all the 8 seats. We also had some breakthrough in Kedah, Perak, Selangor, Pahang and Johore bringing the total win in these states to 7. In the Parliamentary Election, a 100% record was attained in Perak by winning all the three seats allocated, and in Penang we captured two out of the three given, including one by Dr. Koh Tsu Koon in Tanjung, an opposition stronghold. This was the best performance of the party after becoming a component party in the Barisan Nasional. It clearly demonstrated our good standing with the people. However, in the 7th General Election held in August, 1986, against the backdrop of corporate scandals, administrative deviations, cultural intolerance and economic recession, as well as widespread anti-establishment sentiment in the urban areas, the party lost 4 out of the 9 parliamentary seats allocated nation-wide. At state level, though we managed to win 9 out of 11 seats in Penang, we suffered great losses in other states, securing only 4 out of 11 seats.\n\nThough the party leadership was aware of the ups and downs in seat allocation and electoral performance it felt that they should not be regarded as the sole yardstick in measuring the success or failure of its political struggle. Nonetheless, such a misconception was often brought up in party election campaign by aspiring candidates. The party election which was held on 29th September 1984 in Kuala Lumpur according to the amended Constitution approved a year earlier witnessed the first keenly contested match. The incumbents were put to the acid test before emerging as the final victors in the race. Dr. Lim Keng Yaik and Paul Leong Khee Seong were both re-elected as Party President and Deputy President respectively, with Kerk Choo Ting as the new Secretary-General. Committed to the task of winning more right-thinking Malaysians to its struggle, the new leadership began to expand the party organisation in the midst of a move to encourage weak-hearted and opportunist members to desert the party. With a record 95 new branches and 28 new divisions established in 1985, the party could now advance with greater confidence to combat some disturbing symptoms that afflicted the party and the society at large. However, such effort was temporarily thwarted with another major contest for party posts in June, 1987. Fortunately, with greater political maturity and a better understanding of democratic principles, the 16th Annual Delegates Conference proceeded peacefully, and the present leadership was given another mandate to lead the party for another three years.\n\nTribulation & Triumph, 1990-1996\n\nIn the 1990 and 1993 Party elections, the party underwent relatively calm annual Delegates Conferences. There were no contests for the top seven posts of National President, Deputy President, three Vice-Presidents, Secretary-General and Treasurer-General.\n\nHowever, the tame Party elections in 1990 did not reflect the turbulent General Elections faced by Parti Gerakan and other component parties of Barisan Nasional in 21 October 1990. Faced by the combined force of Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah (APU) and Gagasan Rakyat presenting their strategy of a TWO-PARTY system, some Barisan Nasional component parties like GERAKAN and MCA suffered defeats in the hands of DAP. At the Parliamentary level, the party won five seats out of the 9 seats contested while at the state level, the party only managed to win 11 out of the 23 seats contested.\n\nIn Penang, the party only managed to win 7 out of the 11 seats contested. The shock defeat happened in Padang Kota where the then Chief Minister of Penang, Dr Lim Chong Eu was defeated by Lim Kit Siang of DAP. However, our party still managed to secure the post of Chief Minister and Dr Koh Tsu Koon was appointed the new Chief Minister of Penang.\n\nAfter the general setback of 1990, the party embarked on a programme to win back the support of the people while grooming young leaders to shoulder more responsibilities. This was assisted by the political stability, unity and economic growth that prevailed during the post 1990 period. As a result of the peoples consultations through The National Economic Consultative Council in which the party participated actively, the Prime Minister, Dato Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamed launched the VISION 2020 in 28 February 1991.\n\nThis VISION 2020 which aims to develop Malaysia into an advanced industrial nation by the Year 2020 was well accepted by all Malaysians. At the same time, the New Economic Policy was replaced by a National Development Policy which aims to bring greater equality to all Malaysians irregardless of race or religion. For the first time, the concept of Bangsa Malaysia was promulgated. At the same time, the policies on education, economy, culture and language were further liberalised. The liberal and far-sighted policies of the Barisan Nasional government prepared the groundwork for the General Elections in 1995.\n\nBoosted by the success of the Malaysian economy where a growth rate of more than 8 percent was sustained for 7 years, the Barisan Nasional government won a landslide victory on 25 April 1995. The BN won 162 out of the total of 192 parliamentary seats. Our party secured victories in 7 out of the 10 seats at the parliamentary elections. At the state level, our party achieved an even more impressive victory. Of the 27 state seats allocated to Gerakan in the 1995 General Elections, the party won 23 seats.\n\nIn Penang, the party won 10 out of the 11 state seats contested. Our party Vice-President Dr Koh Tsu Koon was reappointed as the Chief Minister of Penang. At the end of 1995 the party also underwent a reorganization exercise. The party was further expanded to cater for the growth in the membership. From the previous system of having only one branch for each state constituency the constitution was amended to allow a maximum of 12 branches per division. Thus the number of branches was increased from 300 to 1,084 branches in 1996.\n\nUnder the able and dynamic leadership of our Party President Sdr Dr Lim Keng Yaik, the party achieved another milestone when our new 22 storey party headquarters (Menara PGRM) at Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, was officially opened by our Party President on 25th May 1996.\n\nConclusion"
