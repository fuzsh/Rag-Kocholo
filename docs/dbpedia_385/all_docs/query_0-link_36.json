        "text": "Party politics in Malaysia has become tumultuous over the past two decades. As such national and regional level elections as well as by-elections have become equally sensitive for party politics. Of late by-elections have taken a special position as they are considered unseasonal barometer for testing popularity and legitimacy of the incumbent and the opposition competition. The effect of the dramatic 2008 national general elections in Malaysia continued during the subsequent three years through nearly one and a half dozen by-elections throughout the country. Until November 2010, the opposition remained jubilant over its victory in eight out of 11 by-elections maintaining the funfair of the rising opposition unprecedented in Malaysia’s election history. But the tide started to dwindle with the subsequent three wins in Galas, Tenang and Batu Sapi by the ruling coalition turning the trend around. Under this circumstance came the Merlimau by-election in March 2011. Reflecting the reality on the ground, therefore, this by-election became a battleground for party political survival for both the ruling and opposition coalitions. This article discusses the campaign strategies of the competing coalitions, the results of the election, and its implications. The importance of this by-election is that it reflected the intensity of national level electoral sensitivity since the ruling party’s political survival was dependent upon wining this election against a series of by-elections won by the opposition.\n\nBilateral free trade agreement (FTA) has been an increasing trend over the past decades. Highly developed countries are getting into FTA with the emerging economies in order for maintaining competitive advantage. A particular area of such agreement is intellectual property rights (IPRs) in superior technology and research. The bone contention of the ongoing Malaysia-US free trade negotiation has been the IPRs. This article looks at the central issues of the negotiation process. It contends that both Malaysia and USA are concerned with their political priorities conditioned by their domestic necessities that influence the negotiation and signing of an agreement. The United States resorts to bilateral and multilateral means to impose its priorities, while Malaysia asserts its national interests with domestic economic and political priorities.\n\nThe removal of Anwar Ibrahim as Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia in September 1998 was a shock to the nation. This is because there were a series of street demonstrations in 1998 until 2001 that gave birth to reformasi (reform) movement. People thought that the dismissal was unfair due to personal conflict between the Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir and Anwar Ibrahim. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the emergence of civil disobedience during reform movement and to identify the actors involved in mobilizing civil disobedience. The analysis shows what the main reason behind the outbreak of civil disobedience was the result of government actions that weakened democracy through the restriction of political rights and civil liberties. In this respect, the removal of Anwar Ibrahim was only a triggering factor. Furthermore, the actors who were involved in acts of civil disobedience include students, young people, opposition parties, non government organizations (NGOs) and activists. These groups cooperated to seek justice for Anwar Ibrahim and also raised issues related to corruption, cronyism and abuse of power in the government. Consequently, support for the Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition, especially the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) declined dramatically in the 1999 general election.\n\nMalaysia held its 13th general election on May 5, 2013 which was a contest between two coalitions, the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) and the opposition Pakatan Rakyat (PR). The latter's expectations for an outright win did not materialise. The election results have shown a rather status quo with minor losses and gains for the two coalitions. This study analysed the 13th election and found a number of noticeable trends. The Chinese voters have voted overwhelmingly for the opposition. The political culture of Malaysia is also shifting toward more participatory type with increased social and economic mobility. The days of one-party dominance in Malaysia are apparently over. The electoral politics in Malaysia might become more polarised along ethnic lines which may require reshuffling of its coalition framework and design. Abstrak: Malaysia mengadakan pilihan raya umum ke-13 pada 5 Mei 2013 yang merupakan pentandingan antara dua pakatan parti, parti pemerintah Barisan Nasional (BN) dan parti pembangkang Pakatan Rakyat (PR). PR berkobar-kobar dengan harapan untuk mencapai prestasi yang lebih baik berbanding pilihan raya sebelumnya. Namun, keputusan pemilihan undi menunjukkan hasil yang lebih kurang sama, dengan sedikit kekalahan dan kemenangan bagi kedua-dua pihak. Kajian ini menganalisis kesimpulan pemilihan tersebut dan ia mendapati beberapa trend yang jelas. Pengundi Cina dengan jelas memilih untuk mengundi"
