It is also the only political coalition currently in Malaysia since the dissolution of Gagasan Perpaduan in January 2021. It has since faced Parti Demokratik Malaysia as it's major challenge since it's formation. There have not been a government formed by BRM once.\n\nHistory[]\n\nFormation[]\n\nBarisan Rakyat Malaysia formed before the 14th General Elections originally with 4 parties in the coalition. The National Solidarity Front (NSF), Pertubuhan Nasional Malaysia (Malaysia National Organisation, PerNAS), Liberal Solidarity Front (LSF) and Parti Kesatuan Rakyat (People's Unity Party, PKR). However, PKR was removed from the coalition following an emergency meeting held by the coalition's Supreme Council which regarded PKR as \"incredibly immature, inexperienced and not exposed to Malaysian politics\" in a press statement.[1]"
