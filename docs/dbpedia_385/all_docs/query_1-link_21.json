Follow Malaysiakini's LIVE updates below:\n\n5.35pm - Parliament media room:\n\nAnthony Loke reveals that Lim Kit Siang's vote was not counted in the House.\n\n\"The record should state that there are 81 votes against, but Lim's vote was not counted,\" Loke says.\n\nLim says he is in a \"twilight zone\" and that it is unclear whether he has been suspended or not.\n\n\"I was in the Dewan Rakyat before and after lunch, so if I am not suspended my vote should count,\" he says.\n\nLoke adds that there was no decision on the motion to suspend Lim before the impromptu noon recess.\n\n\"The motion to gantung (suspend) Lim has also been tergantung (left hanging),\" he says.\n\nThis is the final entry for Malaysiakini's LIVE reports. Thank you.\n\n5.20pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nParliament passes the motion to adopt the new electoral boundaries for Peninsular Malaysia, as proposed by the Election Commission. The breakdown of the vote is as follows:\n\nFor - 129\n\nAgainst - 80\n\nOpposition bench erupts with chants of \"tipu\" (cheating) with most opposition lawmakers holding up placards with the phrase \"Bangkit rakyat hentikan penipuan\" (rise up to stop cheating).\n\nPAS MPs did not hold up the placards.\n\n5.10pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nSpeaker Pandikar Aman Mulia takes over the proceedings as MPs get on with the vote.\n\nOpposition MPs take jabs at MCA, MIC, and Gerakan urging them to vote down the redelineation.\n\n\"Umno bullies MCA,\" Mahfuz Omar (Amanah-Pokok Sena) says, to which Deputy Works Minister Rosnah Shirlin shoots back \"DAP bullies everyone.\"\n\n5.05pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nZahid's wrap up is brief. Shafie Apdal (Warisan-Semporna) interjects and asks why the Sabah state assembly's decision to add 13 state seats were in the redelineation report.\n\nThe deputy premier reveals that Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak received the report on Sabah's electoral boundaries, but the actual tabling of the report was the prime minister's discretion.\n\nAs Zahid wraps up his speech, deputy speaker Ronald to calls for a bloc vote to decide on the EC report.\n\n4.55pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nIt is time for the prime minister's department to wrap up the debates. Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi says there were court decisions in favour of the EC which shows that it had done the redelineation exercise in line with provisions of the constitution.\n\nLim Kit Siang (DAP-Gelang Patah) then rises to interject briefly, saying \"What is this?\"\n\nZahid, who maintains a smile while being interrupted, then continues reading out his written speech.\n\n\"The government has not interfered with the EC, because the government respects the EC's power under the constitution to carry y out the redelineation exercise.\"\n\n4.25pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nDespite the earlier ruling that the number of opposition members that will join the debate be limited to five, Nurul Izzah Anwar (PKR-Lembah Pantai) is allowed to speak.\n\nShe talks about the relocation of Bukit Aman voters to her constituency, which is widely speculated to put the two-term MP at a great disadvantage if she defends her seat.\n\nDeputy speaker Ronald Kiandee then allows two more speakers - Lim Guan Eng (DAP-Bagan) and Noor Azmi Ghazali (BN-Bagan Serai) to debate, before the government is to wrap up.\n\n4.10pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nWarisan president Shafie Apdal (Warisan-Semporna) is the last opposition speaker.\n\nIn his speech, he questions why the Sabah redelineation report was not tabled in Parliament.\n\n\"Why are the rights of Sabahans not respected?\" he asked.\n\nThe next speaker is Noor Ehsanuddin Mohd Harun Narrashid (BN-Kota Tinggi).\n\n3.45pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nThe debate on the EC's redelineation report is nearing its end.\n\nIrmohizam Ibrahim (BN-Kuala Selangor) and Hatta Ramli (Amanah-Kuala Krai) were BN and the opposition's fourth speakers respectively.\n\nOnly two more BN speakers are left and one more from the opposition.\n\n3.15pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nOng Kian Ming (DAP-Serdang) reminds MCA, MIC and Gerakan that their leaders, including MCA president Liow Tiong Lai, had voiced concerns over the redrawn electoral boundaries because of the reduction in heterogeneous constituencies.\n\nSteven Sim then pokes fun at Liang, saying the latter had u-turned on the party's stance.\n\nOng then challenges MCA, MIC, and Gerakan MPs to reject the redelineation report.\n\nThis riles up BN lawmakers, including Liang, who is the Gerakan secretary-general.\n\nDeputy speaker Ismail, however, chides the quarrelling MPs.\n\n\"Save some of your energy, we need to go campaigning soon,\" Ismail says.\n\n3.10pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nLiang Teck Meng (BN-Simpang Renggam) says the opposition's criticism of the EC redelineation exercise are unfounded and meant to incite the people against the government.\n\nElectoral boundaries will not decide who wins, but only the voters will, says Liang.\n\nSteven Sim (DAP-Bukit Mertajam) interjects asking if the 52 percent popular vote for the opposition in 2013 should translate into a mandate.\n\nHee Loy Sien (PKR-Petalaing Jaya Selatan) and Sim Tze Tzin (PKR-Bayan Baru) joins in to rail against Liang.\n\nDeputy speaker Ismail then calls for order, and says that if no one is interested in debating, he would call on the government to wrap up the motion.\n\nThe House quiets down and Liang continues his speech.\n\n3.05pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nThe second opposition speaker Takiyuddin Hassan (PAS-Kota Bharu) asks why it is so difficult for the opposition to meet the EC during over the redelineation exercise.\n\n\"The EC should entertain us, we are stakeholders,\" he says.\n\nHe also says that the report is incomplete and not in order, and on behalf of PAS, says that the report should not have been tabled.\n\n3.00pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nSeremban MP Anthony Loke clarifies with Malaysiakini that Gelang Patah MP Kit Siang was not summoned to the Speaker's chambers during the brief recess at noon.\n\n\"Kit Siang was not called to meet Pandikar and he did not meet Pandikar. No one was summoned.\n\n\"But Guan Eng, myself and some other Harapan leaders did go to meet the speaker to ask him to withdraw the motion to suspend Lim,\" says Loke.\n\nHe adds that there was a suggestion by a deputy speaker for Kit Siang to apologise, but that ultimately there was no outcome from the meeting.\n\n\"But they didn't pursue the motion to suspend him after the break.\"\n\n2.50pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nKhoo Soo Seang (BN-Tebrau) says that the 30,000 new voters in his constituency is suspicious and speculates that they were moved there by the opposition.\n\nHe claims that voters in opposition strongholds have been encouraged to move to other seats.\n\n\"I am not sure how many of these 33,000 voters were moved by the opposition,\" says the MCA lawmaker said.\n\n2.40pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nAzmin faces continuous heckling over Selangor's water supply and the circumstances surrounding how he was appointed menteri besar.\n\nWhen Azmin's 10 minutes to speak runs out, deputy speaker Ismail Mohamed Said allows him to make one last point.\n\nAzmin then spoke about his against the EC and accuses the commission of rushing to complete the report although it has more time.\n\n\"What's the rush? The EC has until September 2018 to finish the report. Why rush this? It is because BN is going to face the 14th general election?\" Azmin asks.\n\nHe also calls for the setting up of a boundaries commission to take over the EC's role of determining electoral boundaries.\n\n2.30pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nThe House proceeding resumes. Azmin Ali (PKR-Gombak) takes up the first opposition slot.\n\nHe highlights The Economist report “Stop, thief! Malaysia's PM is about to steal an election”, which claims that the redelineation exercise is an attempt to gerrymander voters in favour of BN.\n\n\"This gerrymandering exercise is becoming more excessive because Umno is on its last legs,\" he says.\n\nAzmin, who is also the Selangor menteri besar, tries to explain why malapportionment of electoral constituencies in Selangor are a problem, BN MPs responds by complaining about dry taps in the state.\n\nEarlier, Lim Kit Siang, accompanied by his son Guan Eng, successfully entered the House unhindered shortly before the recess ended.\n\n1.35pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nLim Kit Siang tells Malaysiakini that he is unsure if he has been suspended.\n\nHe says he did not leave the House and was present when Najib tabled the redelineation report.\n\n\"We will see if they prevent me from coming back in later,\" he says when contacted.\n\n1.30pm - Outside Parliament:\n\nHuman Rights Commission (Suhakam) member Jerald Joseph, who led a team of observers at the rally this morning, commends protestors for their behaviour and the police for enabling the protest to take place.\n\n\"We commend the OCPD from Sentul and Dang Wangi in playing a facilitating role,\" he tells Malaysiakini.\n\n\"We believe spaces outside and close to Parliament must be allowed for groups to present their grievances.\n\n\"Parliament also was positive to receive the memorandum addressed to the speaker. We are happy it went on in a smooth manner.\"\n\n1.00pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nBudiman Mohd Zohdi (BN-Sungai Besar) is the first backbencher to join the debate. He claims the opposition's allegations of gerrymandering were unfounded.\n\nChua (PKR-Batu) interjects, asking the BN MP to explain why a super constituency like Damansara has the same value as a smaller seat such as Maran.\n\nBudiman responds by saying that the opposition has only looked at half of the constitution's provision about the size of seats.\n\nWhile he admits the constitution does say that seats should be almost of equal size, he adds that the provision then states that consideration should also be made regarding access of voters to the ballot box.\n\nPandikar then cuts Budiman off by telling him his time is over and calls for recess.\n\nThe House proceedings will continue at 2.30pm.\n\n12.40pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nNajib said there are some parts of the EC report that the government does not agree with but the government had not interfered with the EC's work and have made no changes.\n\nThe opposition bench heckles Najib when he thanks the EC for carrying out the redelineation exercise. Zahid seconds the motion.\n\nPandikar calls for the debate, allocating 10 minutes for each debater. There will be six representatives from BN and five from the opposition.\n\nTian Chua (PKR-Batu) protests against limit on the number of debators, saying all MPs need to debate the report.\n\n\"All our seats are affected... we all have a right to debate this,\" he says. G Manivannan (PKR-Kapar) supports him.\n\nAn irate Pandikar slams his gavel several times and orders the opposition MPs to back down.\n\n\"I have given you 10 minutes to debate because this issue is already widely known,\" the speaker says.\n\n12.30pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nSpeaker does not appear to be pursuing the motion to suspend Kit Siang and instead asks Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak to proceed with the tabling of the redelineation report.\n\n12.15pm - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nImmediately after the Dewan Rakyat goes into recess, Kit Siang heeds an instruction to enter the Speaker's office, according to several sources.\n\nFollowing this, Sentul police chief R Munusamy is seen entering the Speaker's office with six of his men.\n\nnoon - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nBersih's representatives successfully submit their protest letter to a representative from the Speaker's office.\n\nFollowing this, the police advise rally leaders to call for the crowd to disperse, to which they comply.\n\nA copy of the memorandum can be viewed below.\n\n11.57am - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nLim Guan Eng (DAP-Bagan) stands to cites a point of order. BN MPs shoots back calling DAP a \"father and son party\".\n\nGuan Eng ignores the heckling and said that there should be a debate on the motion to suspend his father, Kit Siang.\n\n\"This is still a democracy, not an autocracy,\" Guan Eng says.\n\nPandikar says he is saddened by what is going in the House as everything is being politicised.\n\nHe calls for a brief recess, and says the motion to suspend Kit Siang will then continue.\n\nHe adds that if Kit Siang is still in the House when he returns, he will order the police to forcibly remove him.\n\nHe also threatens to evict other rebellious MPs.\n\nThe House goes into recess at noon.\n\n11.55am - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nAzalina moves a motion to suspend Lim Kit Siang. The motion is supported by Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Razali Ibrahim.\n\nPandikar immediately calls for a vote. Anthony Loke (DAP-Seremban) however says Lim (photo) should be given the opportunity to defend himself.\n\nTian Chua (PKR-Batu) calls Parliament a \"kangaroo court\".\n\n11.50am - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nArguments continue in the House. Pandikar calls for a minister to move a motion to suspend Lim.\n\nNurul Izzah Anwar (PKR-Lembah Pantai) says the speaker should be fair and also take action against Azeez for calling Lim a communist.\n\nAzeez, in retort, says Lim started it, by calling BN thieves.\n\n11.46am - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nLim Kit Siang (DAP-Gelang Patah) questions the speaker on the justifications to impose an embargo on the redelineation report.\n\nPandikar orders for him to be evicted causing an uproar.\n\nA Parliament officer stands besides Lim to ask him to leave, but the DAP veteran refuses to budge and shakes his head in defiance.\n\nLim then starts shouting at Najib, calling him a \"pencuri\" (thief), \"penyamun\" (robber).\n\nBN MPs jump to the prime minister's defence, with Azeez Abdul Rahim (BN-Baling) calling Lim a communist.\n\nAs Kit Siang refuses to leave, Pandikar says he will call for a brief recess, and if Lim is still in the House when he returns, he will use his authority to forcefully evict Lim as well as call on the government to table a motion to suspend the Gelang Patah MP.\n\n11.45am - Outside Parliament:\n\nPolice are allowing only eight representatives of the protestors to approach the gates of Parliament to hand over their letter and it appears that the will only get to meet the speaker's representative.\n\n11.40am - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nPandikar says Standing Orders on subjudice does not apply to the redelineation report.\n\nCiting the Federal Constitution, he says it is mandatory for the prime minister to table the redelineation report once he receives it.\n\nHe also cites a Federal Court ruling not to allow a review of the redelineation exercise by voters from Malacca, citing separation of powers.\n\nPandikar says the interruptions by legal experts from the opposition are \"disturbing\" his health.\n\nCharles interjects again saying the redelineation report is incomplete as local enquiries were not held in some areas.\n\nPandikar, however, says his decision is final.\n\n\"I am not required to give an explanation. Secretary, proceed, anyone who interrupts I will use my power (to eject),\" he says.\n\n11.30am - Dewan Rakyat:\n\nMinister in the Prime Minister's Department Azalina Othman Said tables a motion for the House proceedings to continue until the completion of the redelineation report debate.\n\nBefore the Najib can table the motion to debate the motion, however, Charles Santiago (DAP-Klang) interrupts, citing Standing Orders.\n\nSantiago demands a ruling on whether he can read out a motion he submitted two days ago to withdraw the redelineation report.\n\nHanipa Maidin (Amanah-Sepang) then seeks to review why a question he had submitted was rejected, as he says the rejection was improper.\n\nSpeaker Pandikar Aman Mulia, however, says he has already made his decision.\n\nAfter a brief commotion, Pandikar warns that if there are any further interruptions he will not hesitate to eject MPs.\n\nCharles interjects again, saying that there are elements of subjudice in the tabling the redelineation report as there are ongoing court cases challenging the report.\n\n11.30am - Outside Parliament:\n\nYap is now giving a explaining to protestors why the redelineation process was problematic, such as by violating the \"one person, one vote\" principle.\n\nMost of the crowd are now seated on one side of the road, while the rest are wandering around the area.\n\nEarlier, Bersih secretariat member Mandeep Singh announced that Dewan Rakyat Speaker Pandikar Amin Mulia himself would receive the memorandum, while activist Hishammuddin Rais urges them to sit down so everyone could see the handover.\n\nThe crowd is currently flanked by LSF troopers on the left, and traffic police to the right. The latter is preventing traffic from reaching parliament - a trip that would pass close to the crowd.\n\n11.15am - Outside Parliament:\n\nSome 400 protestors made it to the bridge outside the compound of Parliament to accompany Bersih's delegation who will hand a protest letter to the Dewan Rakyat speaker to prevent the redelineation report from being debated because of pending court matters.\n\nProtestors try to keep at least one lane open to vehicular traffic.\n\n11.00am - Tugu Negara:\n\nDespite police orders to stay put, protestors have made their way past police barricades and are marching towards Parliament.\n\nThe police offers no resistance but maintains a police line ahead of the protestors.\n\nCrowd is chanting \"tangkap penyamun\" (catch the thief) and \"tolak laporan\" (reject the report).\n\n10.50am - Tugu Negara:\n\nAfter negotiations between Bersih steering committee member Yap Swee Weng and the Dang Wangi police chief, Yap tells the crowd that only 10 representatives will be allowed to proceed to Parliament, despite their demands to march as a whole group.\n\nThe crowd jeers and shouts \"Tangkap!\" (arrest them) when Yap says the police will arrest anyone who crosses the police barricade.\n\nYap urges the crowd to comply because Bersih is a peaceful movement. He urges the crowd to remain at Tugu Negara while a delegation approaches Parliament.\n\n10.40am - Tugu Negara: Handful of red-shirts emerges\n\nSeveral red-shirts activists, who had previously threatened to confront the Bersih rally, are spotted at the fringes of the gathering.\n\nOne recognisable face is Razali Zakaria (below), who was in a black shirt and recording the event on his phone.\n\nThe Bersih rally coordinators appeals to participants to not create provoke the rival group.\n\n\"If there are anyone who tries to create provocation, nab them and hand them to the police,\" he says.\n\n10.30am -Tugu Negara:\n\nThe demonstrators chant \"Hidup Tun\" when Dr Mahathir Mohamad and his wife Dr Siti Hasmah Ali arrive.\n\nMahathir urges the rakyat not to be afraid to vote for the opposition to \"save Malaysia from kleptocracy\".\n\n\"Malaysia has become a country of kleptocracy because of Najib.He wants to change all the laws to ensure they win.\n\n\"We have to be brave to oppose it. Najib won't know whom you vote for. Don't be afraid. Please don't vote the moon (PAS) or the Libra (BN), but vote for Harapan.\"\n\nAlso present are Bersatu deputy president Muhyiddin Yassin, PKR vice-president Nurul Izzah and DAP veteran Lim Kit Siang.\n\n10.15am - Tugu Negara:\n\nFormer prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad and his wife arrives at Tugu Negara to join with the Bersih protesters.\n\nHe takes the microphone and addresses the crowd, listing what he claimed were a list of Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak's wrongdoings.\n\nAlthough it is past the 10am deadline set by the police to disperse, there is no instructions for the protestors to leave yet.\n\n10.00am – Parliament:\n\nThe bell rings, indicating the start of the morning session. Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak is expected to table the redelineation report at 11.30am.\n\nThe house is quiet as most government and opposition members have not occupied their seats.\n\n10.00am - Tugu Negara:\n\nThe gerrymandering and malapportionment in the redelineation proposal will make Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak a threat to national security, Amanah president Mohamad Sabu told the gathering.\n\nBetter known as Mat Sabu, he said with the redelineation, BN would only need about 40 percent of the popular vote to retain power.\n\n\"When people lose faith in democracy, the people will reject democracy. This is a danger to national security.\n\n\"The person who is most dangerous to national security now? Najib Tun Razak, because if people don't trust democracy, they will choose other options.\n\n\"This is what happened in the Philippines, in Indonesia. When people reject the ballot box, they will take to the streets. Does Najib want to see the people reject democracy?\" Mat Sabu asked.\n\n9.45am -Tugu Negara:\n\nThere are three layers of human chain blocking the entrance to Tugu Negara. Fourteen Light Strike Force personnel with guns and plastic shields are standing nearest to the demonstrators, followed by two lines of police personnel.\n\nA group of 40 Amanah supporters took a bus all the way from Malacca to attend the rally in Tugu Negara. Aniza Talib, 53, told Malaysiakini that she came with her five siblings to oppose the redelineation.\n\n“We came all the way from Malacca to fight the lie of SPR (EC),” Aniza said.\n\nStanding on the pavement, Jason Tan, a 66-year-old retired school teacher, holds out his handmade slogan board and chants with the crowd.\n\nTan said he came from Johor by bus with five of his friends. He has been a hardcore supporter of Bersih since 2011 and he has attended every Bersih rally, starting with Bersih 2.0.\n\n“Besides controlling the election, the authorities are also moving to control freedom of information by using the anti-fake news law,” he said.\n\n9.15am - Tugu Negara:\n\nFormer Bersih co-chairperson Ambiga Sreenevasan said the redelineation proposal to be tabled today and the Anti-Fake News Bill 2018 tabled yesterday must both be opposed.\n\nTaking to the stage, Ambiga (photo) said, \"We cannot allow that. The rakyat are the only ones who can say something. Why are they rushing with that (redelineation) report?\n\n\"Today, we must make our voices heard. This is about our rights, the people's rights. The right to vote! With this report, they are challenging democracy in this country.\"\n\nHowever, Ambiga stressed that the opposition must be peaceful, because that is what the Bersih movement is about.\n\nAmbiga's immediate successor Maria Chin Abdullah, who recently resigned as Bersih chairperson, described the EC as a \"forger\".\n\n\"The EC has one job, but they are forgers,\" she said.\n\nMaria said 80,000 people had opposed the EC's first redelineation proposal, and the EC pretended to listen by backtracking on some of its proposals in the second redelineation proposal. Thus, the second round of objections weren't as strong.\n\n\"But we now know from the embargoed documents that they have cheated us and went back to the first proposal. And when we know we have filed a court case on March 20, they quickly sent a letter to the objectors explaining why their objections had been rejected.\n\n\"Thus the EC is a forger, and we can no longer accept this because we love this country. We come out in large numbers today because we want peace, justice, and democracy,\" Maria said.\n\n8.52am - Tugu Negara:\n\nA crowd of about 300 protesters is not allowed to either march nor walk towards Parliament House.\n\nThe police have blocked the entrance to Tugu Negara with a line of officers and two blue Land Rovers. There were about 20 riot police officers with plastic shields on standby at the entrance.\n\nDang Wangi district police chief ACP Shaharudin Abdullah negotiated with the protesters and ordered them to dismiss by 10am.\n\nAbout 20 police personnel are present near the demonstrators, and a group of Light Strike Force personnel in riot gear stand guard further away.\n\nMeanwhile, there is still no sign of Jamal Yunos and his group of Red Shirts, who had threatened a counter-demonstration.\n\n8.15am - The main road to the Parliament:\n\nPolice have blocked one lane on the main road to Parliament House in both directions since about 7am. The police officers checked the vehicles one by one to ensure no strangers are going into Parliament.\n\nThere were a few Bersih supporters sitting by the roadside, about 400 metres away from the Parliament gate.\n\n8.25am - Tugu Negara:\n\nPolice are asking the Bersih organisers whether they had filed a notice for their gathering today.\n\n8.00am - Persiaran Sultan Salahuddin:\n\nAbout 100 Bersih supporters have gathered on the road leading from Jalan Parlimen to Tugu Negara, many of whom are dressed in Bersih’s signature yellow T-shirts.\n\nBersih’s recently resigned chairperson Maria Chin Abdullah was among them, and many took the opportunity to have a picture taken with her.\n\nScores of other Bersih supports are also seen around Pandang Merbok and heading towards Tugu Negara or eating breakfast at stalls near the Bukit Aman federal police headquarters.\n\nPolice have blocked traffic entering Persiaran Sultan Salahuddin since 7am, but the Bersih supporters are still allowed to pass the roadblock on foot.\n\nParliament is set to turn into a battleground, both in and out of the August House today, as the government prepares to table, debate and pass the Election Commission's electoral constituency redelineation report.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Abdul Razak is expected to table the report in the Dewan Rakyat at 11.30am.\n\nOutside the Parliament grounds, electoral reform group Bersih is mobilising to protest the EC report, which it claims is rife with gerrymandering and malapportionment to give the ruling BN government an advantage in the upcoming 14th general election.\n\nBersih protesters will be gathering at Tugu Negara at 8am, and have vowed to demonstrate until the debate ends.\n\nHowever, they will not be alone - for Sungai Besar Umno division chief Jamal Md Yunos has vowed to hold a counter-protest with his Red Shirts movement."
