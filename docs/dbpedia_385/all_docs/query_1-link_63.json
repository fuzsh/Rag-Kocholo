FRIM’s ecological management plan ensures that a\n\ncomprehensive range of flora (tree and plant species) is planted and\n\nmonitored over a span of several years and represents proven efforts\n\nat conservation. Meanwhile, the Sarawak Biodiversity Centre (SBC),\n\nwhich works in partnership with drug companies to tap the medical\n\nresources of the rainforest (for cancer, AIDS/HIV, etc.), is a positive\n\nstep in future developments. The Heart of Borneo Project, announced\n\nin 2006 and aimed at protecting some 220,000 square kilometers of\n\nforest at the border confluence of Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia,\n\nis an important initiative of the three national governments.\n\nLarge-scale palm oil cultivation has taken over large tracts of land\n\npreviously designated as native customary land and is a sore point\n\nwith environmentalists in Sabah and Sarawak. Not only are there\n\nproblems of displaced communities and adverse impacts on their\n\ntraditional forest-dependent lifestyle but such large-scale programs\n\nalso threaten protected species such as the orangutan and pygmy\n\nelephants that apparently were prevented from migrating owing to\n\nestate fences. As a result of open burnings from Kalimantan and Su-\n\nmatra, largely by plantation companies in clearing tracts of land for\n\ncultivation, air pollution (termed haze) has been created. Almost an\n\nannual affair (between September and October), haze has contributed\n\nto a rise in respiratory illnesses and reduced visibility in Sarawak, the\n\nwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia, and the Straits of Melaka.\n\nDam construction, notably the Bakun Dam, in Sarawak and Per-\n\ngau, Kelantan, has drawn much criticism concerned with ecologi-\n\ncal damage and the displacement and threat to traditional cultures\n\nand lifestyles. Erosion and landslides resulting from logging, dam\n\nconstruction, and land development for commerce and housing have\n\nled the authorities to review and tighten construction rules. Several\n\nactive nongovernmental organizations deal with environmental\n\nconcerns and human rights issues, including Sahabat Alam Malaysia\n\n(SAM), Malaysian Nature Society (MNS), and Voice of the Malay-\n\nsian People (SUARAM). The livelihood and sociocultural heritage of\n\nethnic minorities in Sabah and Sarawak are of equal concern, as\n\nmany communities—for instance, the nomadic Penan—still rely to a\n\nlarge extent on the forest for sustenance.\n\nETHNIC MINORITIES IN SABAH AND SARAWAK • 91\n\nETHNIC MINORITIES IN SABAH AND SARAWAK. This term\n\nrefers to the various indigenous peoples in Sabah (North Borneo\n\nbefore 1963) and Sarawak divided into Muslim and non-Muslim\n\ncommunities. Malay or Melayu is designated for the Muslims while\n\nDayak (Dyak, Daya) is the general term for non-Muslim indigenous\n\ngroups, who are also referred to by their tribal names. The Iban (Sea\n\nDayak) are the largest indigenous community in Sarawak. Other eth-\n\nnic groups include Bidayuh (Land Dayaks), Melanau, Kayan and\n\nKenyah, Kelabit and Lun Bawang, Murut, Orang Ulu, Kajang,\n\nBerawan, and Penan. Some of the coastal Melanau and Kajang of\n\nthe interior had masuk Melayu (“to become Malay”), meaning they\n\nhad embraced Islam and had adopted Malay customs, language,\n\nand way of life (living on stilt houses, wearing sarung). Swidden\n\nagriculture, mainly dry and hill padi (rice), is dominant in the\n\nsubsistence economy of most of Sarawak’s indigenous minorities.\n\nIbans and other groups in the interior are adept at collecting jungle\n\nproducts. The Kelabit inhabit the highland plateaus of northeast\n\nSarawak and practice wet rice farming. Coastal Melanau communi-\n\nties subsist on sago cultivation. The nomadic Penan are hunters and\n\ngatherers. In Sabah, the largest native group is the Kadazandusun,\n\nwho mainly inhabit the western coast. Other communities are Run-\n\ngus, Ranau, Tambunan, Murut (different from those in Sarawak),\n\nand Bajau. On the eastern coast are the Idahans. Rice farming and\n\nharvesting sea produce are the main preoccupations of Sabah’s na-\n\ntive peoples.\n\nWestern colonial rule—Sarawak under the Brooke White Rajah\n\n(1841–1941, 1946) and North Borneo (Sabah) under the British\n\nNorth Borneo Chartered Company (1881–1941, 1946)—intro-\n\nduced Christianity and cash cropping (rubber, coffee, cocoa, and\n\npepper). Commercial agriculture, increased trade and commerce\n\n(dominated by immigrant Chinese), mineral exploitation (gold,\n\ncoal, and oil and petroleum by Chinese and Europeans), and the\n\nmonetized economy brought the modern world to the native way\n\nof life. Developments in the postindependence period (after 1963),\n\nparticularly in large-scale commercial agriculture (rubber, palm oil)\n\nand timber extraction, had an adverse impact on the traditional live-\n\nlihood of native groups and the environment in which they largely\n\ndepend for sustenance. See also POPULATION.\n\n92 • ETHNIC POLARIZATION\n\nETHNIC POLARIZATION. Ethnic polarization was apparently an\n\nissue in the 1970s and 1980s that prompted the Malaysian Ministry of\n\nEducation to undertake a study resulting in the Committee to Study\n\nPolarization in Schools Report, Ministry of Education (1984) that\n\nproposed the need for programs on citizenship. The issue of ethnic\n\npolarization could be traced to the colonial period when the various\n\nethnic communities were segregated in terms of spatial distribution,\n\neconomic activities, types and levels of education, language, reli-\n\ngion, cultural backgrounds, and socioeconomic class. Although some\n\npolitical parties claimed to be multiethnic in membership, in reality\n\npolitical parties were established along communal lines and champi-\n\noned parochial rights and interests of a particular ethnic group. Racial\n\npolitics undoubtedly polarized the different communities, with each\n\nbecoming defensive of its identity, culture, language, history, and\n\nreligion. The differentiation in medium of instruction of primary edu-\n\ncation (six years for 7–12-year-olds)—where national schools using\n\nMalay, the national language, as the medium of instruction coexist\n\nwith national-type schools where Mandarin (Chinese language) and\n\nTamil are the medium of instruction—contributes further to ethnic\n\npolarization. Nonetheless, various measures have been adopted to\n\naddress this pertinent issue including Rukunegara, Rukun Tetangga\n\n(neighborhood watch and patrol), the Vision Schools concept where\n\nthree ethnic-based schools—Malay, Chinese, and Tamil—share a\n\ncommon venue, and citizenship programs in schools. Politics must be\n\nracially inclusive and eschew playing the racial card, thus the need\n\nto promote multiethnic political parties that champion the rights,\n\ninterests, and concerns of all Malaysians, not of any particular ethnic\n\ngroup, state or region, or religion. See also BANGSA MALAYSIA;\n\nMALAYSIAN MALAYSIA.\n\nEURASIANS. Numbering about 12,640 (2004 estimates), Eurasians\n\nin Malaysia trace their ancestry to Western colonial rule: Portuguese\n\nMelaka (1511–1641), Dutch Melaka (1641–1824), and British Ma-\n\nlaya. Portuguese unions with local women created the Luso-Malays\n\nas Eurasians in Melaka. As a privileged group with public ap-\n\npointments, Luso-Malays lost their status when the Dutch occupied\n\nMelaka; many of them moved to Junk Ceylon (Phuket), then to Port\n\nQuedah (Kedah), and finally to Penang when it became a British\n\nFEDERAL AGRICULTURAL MARKETING AUTHORITY • 93\n\noutpost in 1786. Meanwhile, Dutch traders and administrators mar-\n\nried locals, further expanding Eurasian numbers. Eurasians in Penang\n\nsettled at Pulau Tikus, George Town. In the late 19th century, they\n\nwere joined by Ceylonese Dutch Burghers who enlarged the Pulau\n\nTikus Serani (Eurasian) community. Their English-language educa-\n\ntion, mainly from Christian brothers’ schools like St. Xavier’s In-\n\nstitution (Penang) and St. Joseph’s Institution (Singapore), enabled\n\nEurasians to serve as clerks in the British colonial administration of\n\nthe Straits Settlements, in the Federated Malay States, in Brooke\n\nSarawak, in Western agency houses, in shipping and insurance\n\nfirms, and in banks. Small numbers of Eurasians elected to migrate\n\nto Great Britain, Australia, and Canada following Merdeka (inde-\n\npendence) in 1957. Christianity (Roman Catholic and Protestant)\n\npervades almost every aspect of Eurasian life. The Portuguese\n\nSettlement in Melaka under a regedor (headman) annually celebrate\n\nnumerous festa (festivals) where songs, dances, and various foods\n\nare presented for young and old to enjoy. The older generation of\n\nEurasians maintained Kristang or Papia Cristao, the language of the\n\nChristians, a hybridization of 16th-century Portuguese, Malay, and\n\nEnglish. See also POPULATION.\n\n–F–\n\nFEDERAL AGRICULTURAL MARKETING AUTHORITY\n\n(FAMA). Established in 1965 as a marketing agency under the\n\nAgriculture Ministry, the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority\n\nis tasked with promoting the development and marketing of agricul-\n\ntural produce and ensuring maximum returns for producers (farm-\n\ners). Strategies employed include upgrading the supply sources and\n\nprocurement system, and an efficient domestic marketing system. At\n\nthe same time, FAMA is expanding its export markets by enhancing\n\nquality, value-added activities, and agribusiness entrepreneurship.\n\nThrough FAMA’s Pasar Tani (Farmers Market), farmers sell their\n\nproduce directly to consumers at urban and residential areas.

Sir John Anderson, governor of the Straits\n\nSettlements (1904–1911), who wanted to centralize power in the\n\ngovernorship rather than the British resident-general, established\n\nthe Federal Council in 1909. The council comprised the governor\n\nwho, as high commissioner of the Federated Malay States (FMS),\n\nchaired as president; the resident-general (later chief secretary); the\n\nfour Malay sultans; the four residents of the FMS; and (initially,\n\nlater increased) four unofficial members (three Europeans and one\n\nChinese). Officially, its inauguration was aimed at greater conve-\n\nnience and administrative efficiency. Having witnessed the antics\n\nof Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham, the first resident-general\n\n(1896–1900), whose strong personality saw him overriding the au-\n\nthority of the governor and dealing directly with Great Britain’s Co-\n\nlonial Office in London, Governor Anderson successfully reversed\n\nthe locus of power. Moreover, in 1910, he reduced the position of\n\nthe resident-general to that of chief secretary. In practice, the Federal\n\nCouncil concentrated executive power in the hands of its president\n\n(governor/high commissioner) and made him the supreme ruler of the\n\nFMS accountable only to the British government.\n\nFEDERAL LAND DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (FELDA). In ac-\n\ncordance with the Land Development Act of 1956, the Federal Land\n\nDevelopment Agency was established and tasked with opening up\n\nvirgin forest land and transforming the land into agricultural small-\n\nholdings. FELDA had 278 land schemes where over 100,000 settler\n\nfamilies undertook cultivation of mainly palm oil, rubber, and some\n\ncane sugar. FELDA placed a settler family on precleared land. A\n\nloan with reasonable interest was given to the family to be repaid\n\nwithin 15 to 20 years from the date the crops yield, viz. 36 months for\n\npalm oil, and 72 months for rubber. The plot of land subsequently be-\n\nlonged to the settler family. In this way, FELDA contributed toward\n\nrural development and alleviated the hardship of rural inhabitants by\n\ngiving them land for commercial agriculture. See also AGRICUL-\n\nTURE; ECONOMY, POSTINDEPENDENCE; NEW ECONOMIC\n\nPOLICY.\n\nFEDERATED MALAY STATES (FMS). Comprising the Western\n\nMalay States of Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang,\n\nFEDERATION OF MALAYA • 95\n\nthe FMS succeeded in imposing the centralization of British colonial\n\npower in 1896. Headquartered in Kuala Lumpur was the British\n\nresident-general, the representative of the British government who\n\nheaded the FMS and held the reins of political and executive power.\n\nThe autonomous entity of the Malay states and the powers of both\n\nthe British residents and Malay sultans were greatly eroded. Sir\n\nFrank Athelstane Swettenham, who conceived of the federation\n\nand was the inaugural British resident-general, was content with the\n\nattainment of administrative uniformity and efficiency, and greater\n\ncoordination of services (revenue, infrastructure development, edu-\n\ncation, public health, and the judiciary). Improvements in the public\n\nsector directly benefited private entrepreneurs in commercial agri-\n\nculture and mining, for instance, in land administration. The FMS\n\nbrought progress and prosperity to all its constituents, including the\n\nfinancially strapped Pahang. The efficient land transport network\n\n(railroads and roads) contributed to the unsurpassed success of\n\nthe tin and rubber industries. The annual durbar, or conference of\n\nMalay rulers, where the four sultans discussed state affairs with the\n\nresident-general and other senior British officials, was merely cer-\n\nemonious as the outcome was nonbinding. In the 1920s and 1930s,\n\ndebates over decentralization proposals and the erosion of the powers\n\nof the Malay rulers were used as bait to persuade other Malay states\n\non the benefits of the federation, and were introduced with minimal\n\nsuccess. The FMS brought unparalleled socioeconomic benefits but\n\neffectively reduced the political authority of the Malay rulers. But\n\nfederation undoubtedly strengthened and consolidated British colo-\n\nnial rule over the Western Malay States. Following the end of the\n\nPacific War (1941–1945), the FMS was replaced by the Malayan\n\nUnion in 1946. See also BRITISH RESIDENTIAL SYSTEM.\n\nFEDERATION OF MALAYA. Established in February 1948, it\n\ncomprised the nine Malay states: Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, Tereng-\n\nganu, Pahang, Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Johor,\n\nand the former Straits Settlements of Penang and Melaka. The\n\nFederation of Malaya replaced the much opposed Malayan Union\n\n(1946–1948) scheme. A British high commissioner headed the fed-\n\neral government in Kuala Lumpur. Federal executive and legisla-\n\ntive councils assisted the high commissioner in administration. The\n\n96 • FENG SHUI\n\nnine Malay sultans headed their respective state governments, each\n\nwith its state executive and legislative councils. Governors appointed\n\nby the high commissioner headed the Penang and Melaka state gov-\n\nernments. The nine Malay sultans and the two governors comprised\n\nthe Rulers’ Council that met annually and, when necessary, with the\n\nhigh commissioner to discuss important issues. While the federal\n\ngovernment was responsible for finance, security, foreign policy,\n\ncivil laws and legislation, trade and commerce, transport, and com-\n\nmunication, state governments dealt with local governments, Islam,\n\npublic health and education, and land matters. The federation’s\n\nConstitution safeguarded the privileges of the Malays as well as the\n\nrights of non-Malay citizens. Citizenship followed the principle of\n\njus soli. For the first time, Malaya formally became one single politi-\n\ncal unit with a common constitution, and many Chinese and Indians\n\nbecame citizens of the federation, an initial step toward the formation\n\nof a pan-Malayan identity.\n\nFENG SHUI. Lit., wind (feng) and water (shui), feng shui, the 4,000-\n\nyear-old Chinese art of living in harmonious synergy with the natural\n\nenvironment, is applicable in a building’s location and architectural\n\ndesign. Concerned with interaction between mountains, valleys, and\n\nthe flow of water (rivers, lakes), feng shui seeks to harness positive\n\nenergy lines, qi (dragon’s breath), while circumventing or overcom-\n\ning negative energy lines (“poison arrows” or “killing breath”). A\n\nfeng shui practitioner (sifu, meaning master) determines a building’s\n\nspatial orientation and advice on the positioning of the furniture\n\nwithin. Although there are allusions to mystical beliefs, folklore,\n\nand even astrology, the contemporary appeal of feng shui lies in\n\nits common sense, rationale, and logical justification of many of its\n\nprinciples.\n\nFESTIVALS. Owing to the multiethnic, multicultural, and multireli-\n\ngious nature of Malaysian society, the festive calendar is always full\n\nthroughout the year. Most of the festivals are of a religious nature\n\nor follow traditional practices. The main celebrations that are de-\n\nclared public holidays are the Muslim Hari Raya Aidil Fitri/Puasa,\n\nHari Raya Adil-Adha/Haji/Korban, and the Prophet Muhammad’s\n\nbirthday; Chinese Lunar New Year; Buddhist Wesak; Hindu\n\nFIVE-YEAR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS • 97\n\nThaipusam and Deepavali; Christmas; Pesta Kaamatan of Sabah;\n\nand Gawai (Antu, Dayak) of Sarawak.\n\nThe Chinese community marks Qing Ming by honoring ancestors\n\nwith cooked food at the tombs or at columbaria where homage is paid\n\nto urns containing ashes of the deceased; Christians place flowers at\n\ngraves on All Souls Day. The Daoist Festival of the Hungry Ghosts\n\n(Zhong Yuan; Hokkien, Phor Tor) spans the entire Chinese seventh\n\nlunar month (July or August) and is observed by placing heaps of\n\ncooked dishes, roasted pigs, chickens, ducks, and an assortment of\n\ncakes at the altar of an effigy of the Lord of Hades. Other Chinese\n\nfestivities include the Vegetarian Festival of the Nine Emperor\n\nGods (Kew Ong Yeah), the Mooncake Festival (Zhong Qui), and the\n\nChang Festival, which is closely related to the Dragon Boat Festival.\n\nChang are glutinous rice dumplings to honor Chü Yüan (332–295\n\nB.C.E.), an upright Chinese statesman who, despairing over a corrupt\n\nworld, drowned himself. Dragon boat racing has become an interna-\n\ntional sporting event that is annually held in Penang.\n\nTamils observe Thai-ponggal, traditionally a harvest festival that\n\nfalls in the Indian month of Thai (January–February). The Eurasians\n\nof Melaka of Portuguese descent celebrate Festa Intrudo (Water\n\nFestival), Festa San Juan (Festival of St. John the Baptist), and Festa\n\nSan Pedro (Festival of St. Peter). St. Anne’s Feast Day is a grand an-\n\nnual affair where Catholic pilgrims, both local and foreign (from as\n\nfar away as Europe and Australia), congregate at the church in Bukit\n\nMertajam, Penang. The minority Thais celebrate the Loy Krathong\n\nFestival in mid-November and the Songkraan Water Festival in\n\nApril–May. The Chitties have Mariamman Thirunal, a celebration\n\nhonoring a goddess, while the Nepalese have Dashera, which cel-\n\nebrates the triumph of good over evil, and the Sikhs have Vaisakhi,\n\nwhich marks their new year. In most of the aforesaid festivals, the\n\nOpen House concept prevails whereby other communities are in-\n\nvited to join in the festive food and revelry.\n\nFIVE-YEAR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS. Malaysia’s\n\nFive-Year National Development Plans represent government so-\n\ncioeconomic planning to achieve national objectives as determined\n\nby the political leadership then ruling the country. The challenges\n\n98 • FOOD\n\nin the post-Merdeka (independence) period were the differential\n\nsocioeconomic gap between ethnic groups, poverty, and economic\n\nactivity along ethnic lines. Malaysia implemented eight national\n\ndevelopment plans from the First Malayan Plan (1956–1960) to the\n\nEighth Malaysian Plan (2001–2005), and currently is in the midst\n\nof the Ninth Malaysian Plan (2006–2010). Each plan has its own\n\nphilosophy, objectives, focus and priorities, programs, and imple-\n\nmentation strategies. A mid-term review is undertaken following 30\n\nmonths of implementation to ascertain progress, problems, budget,\n\nimplementation process, meeting contemporary challenges (domestic\n\nand global), and other related issues. All plans aim at ensuring the\n\nstability, unity, and prosperity of all Malaysians.

Malaysia is a paradise for food lovers as the multiethnic\n\npopulation showcases a variety of cuisines and cooking styles\n\nthat few places could surpass. Malay cuisine is varied, originating\n\nfrom the nine Malay states as well as from Sarawak, Sabah, and\n\neven Brunei. Similarly, Chinese foods, apart from the ubiquitous\n\nCantonese fare (representative of most Chinese cuisines all over the\n\nworld), boast specialties from Hokkien, Teochew, Hakka, Hailam\n\n(Hainanese), Foochow, and other dialect groups. The eclectic Baba\n\nNyonya has culinary creations based on borrowings from Chinese,\n\nMalay, Thai, Acehnese, and also Burmese kitchens. Indian-Hindu\n\nfood is generally of a North Indian and South Indian variety with the\n\never popular vegetarian meals that both share. Indian-Muslims, and\n\nlikewise the Sikhs, Punjabis, Bengalis, Sindhis, Sinhalese, and other\n\nminorities from the subcontinent possess their own food varieties.\n\nEurasians serve their unique recipes derived from European and lo-\n\ncal influences; their desserts and confectionaries are delightful treats.\n\nEach ethnic community in Sabah and Sarawak has its own culinary\n\nspecialties, including unusual fares such as stir-fried sago worms or\n\ncooked wild ferns. The Hailam cooks who served European house-\n\nholds during the colonial period concocted Western cuisines with\n\nFOREIGN POLICY • 99\n\nan Oriental touch, making them the pioneers of fusion cuisine—for\n\ninstance, adding soy sauce to gravies on steaks.\n\nStreet food is another of Malaysia’s delights for both residents\n\nand visitors; George Town’s famed hawker (street) food such as\n\nchar koay teow has since graduated into the menus of New York,\n\nLondon, and Sydney restaurants. Tropical fruits, starting with the\n\ncontroversial durian (Durio zibethinus), the hairy-looking rambutan\n\n(Nephelium lappaceum), mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) and\n\ncempedak (Artocarpus integer), langsat and duku (Lansium do-\n\nmesticum), guava (Psidium guajava), and others—including the 40\n\nknown varieties of bananas—offer a staggering array of choices.

Guided by the dual principles of protecting its\n\nsovereignty and maintaining its independence, Malaysia adopted a\n\nneutral posture in world affairs. Following Merdeka (independence)\n\nin 1957, Malaya found itself in the bipolar world of the Cold War\n\nwhere an ideological struggle was being waged between the capitalist\n\nnations headed by the United States and the communist bloc led by\n\nthe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Meanwhile, the Malayan\n\nEmergency (1948–1960), a communist insurgency, had yet to be\n\nresolved, although the government of Prime Minister Tunku Ab-\n\ndul Rahman Putra Al-Haj was gaining the upper hand. To avoid\n\nbeing used as a Cold War pawn, Malaya refrained from joining the\n\nSoutheast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Instead, it agreed to\n\nthe Anglo–Malayan Defence Agreement (AMDA) whereby Great\n\nBritain, Australia, and New Zealand would offer military assistance\n\nif the need arose; meanwhile, British troops were stationed in the\n\ncountry. The formation of Malaysia in 1963 resulted in President\n\nSukarno of Indonesia launching Konfrontasi (1963–1966) and the\n\nPhilippines pressing the Sabah claim. Sukarno’s downfall in Oc-\n\ntober 1965 brought an end to Konfrontasi, but it was in 1966 that it\n\nwas officially concluded, and diplomatic relations were reestablished\n\nin 1967. Manila’s claim also subsided but was not abandoned, and\n\n100 • FOREIGN POLICY\n\ndiplomatic ties were resumed in 1966. Residual enmity was set aside\n\nin August 1967 when Malaysia, together with Indonesia, the Philip-\n\npines, Singapore, and Thailand, set up the Association of Southeast\n\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) to promote regional cooperation.\n\n(Tun) Abdul Razak bin Hussein as minister of foreign affairs\n\nwas the architect of Malaysia’s neutral posture. The AMDA not-\n\nwithstanding, Malaysia leaned toward the Nonaligned Movement\n\n(NAM). Malaysia argued persuasively that nonalignment denoted\n\nnoninvolvement in superpower rivalry. In 1970, Malaysia became\n\na member of the NAM. In the face of the Cold War, Razak sought\n\nto create a Zone of Peace, Freedom, and Neutrality (ZOPFAN)\n\nin Southeast Asia. ZOPFAN was formally adopted by ASEAN in\n\n1976. In 1971, the AMDA was replaced by the Five-Power Defence\n\nArrangements (FPDA) involving Malaysia, Singapore, Britain, Aus-\n\ntralia, and New Zealand. Subsequently, British troops were gradu-\n\nally withdrawn from Malaya. During his premiership (1970–1976),\n\nRazak established diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic\n\nof China (PRC) with a visit to Beijing in 1974 where he met top\n\nChinese Communist Party leaders, including Chairman Mao Zedong.\n\nUnder Prime Minister Tun Hussein Onn (1976–1981), Malaysia\n\ncontinued to establish friendly ties with numerous nations including\n\nthose in the Pacific islands—Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Solomon Is-\n\nlands, and Micronesia. It was a prudent move, as these Pacific island\n\nnations supported Malaysia’s argument in defining ocean boundaries\n\nof coastal countries that subsequently became the United Nations\n\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (1982). The convention benefited\n\nMalaysia as it gained access to its rich undersea oil reserves.\n\nThe 22-year-long premiership (1981–2003) of Tun Dr. Mahathir\n\nbin Mohamad witnessed Malaysia playing a very visible and re-\n\nspected role in world affairs. Back in 1960, Malayan Prime Minister\n\nTunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj (1957–1963) had used the\n\ncommonwealth as a platform to level criticism at apartheid, which\n\nled to South Africa’s withdrawal from the association the following\n\nyear. Thoroughly outspoken, Mahathir criticized the United Nations\n\n(UN) for various shortcomings—domination by Western powers, the\n\nveto power of permanent members of the Security Council, inequi-\n\ntable representation especially of Third World nations—and strongly\n\nsuggested that the world body undergo reforms. Mahathir cham-\n\nFOREIGN POLICY • 101\n\npioned the causes of poor, developing countries. A South–South\n\nCommission was established at the NAM in 1986. Mahathir was par-\n\nticularly articulate in presenting the perspective of the Third World\n\non environmental issues, arguing for sustainable development at the\n\nRio de Janeiro Earth Summit in 1992. He was also quick to condemn\n\nthe dismal treatment by the Western democracies of Muslim na-\n\ntions, particularly demonstrated during the Bosnian conflict where\n\nethnic cleansing was undertaken against Bosnian Muslims while the\n\nUN and the West stood idly by. Malaysia readily sent personnel to\n\nparticipate in the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)\n\npeacekeeping operations in Bosnia in 1995.\n\nIn Asia, Malaysia contributed personnel to the United Nations\n\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC; 1992–1993). It also\n\nsought an expansion of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\n\nand supported the inclusion of Vietnam (1995), Laos and Myanmar\n\n(1997), and Cambodia (1998–1999). The ASEAN Regional Forum\n\n(ARF), established in mid-1994, offered a platform for dialogue\n\nwith other global blocs. The following year, the Asian–European\n\nMeeting (ASEM), which opened a dialogue between ASEAN and\n\nthe European Union (EU), was established. Malaysia was a staunch\n\nsupporter of the 1995 Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone\n\n(SEANWFZ). After failing with the East Asia Economic Caucus\n\n(EAEC)—namely, closer relations between ASEAN and China,\n\nJapan, and South Korea because of U.S. opposition—Malaysia sub-\n\nsequently promoted and succeeded in establishing an ASEAN Plus\n\nThree in 1997, the “Three” being China, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nMalaysia also joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum\n\n(APEC) in 1989.\n\nIn the post–Cold War era and in the so-called New World Order\n\ndominated by the United States, Malaysia was critical of the predom-\n\ninant role of the United States as the sole superpower and bravely\n\ncondemned many of its unilateral actions and manipulation of the\n\nUN for its own interests. Nonetheless, Malaysia maintained close ties\n\nwith Russia and the United States; in fact, Washington considered\n\nKuala Lumpur to be an important ally in its war against terrorism.\n\nPrime Minister Dato’ Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi (2003–),\n\nas chairman of the NAM as well as of the Organization of the Is-\n\nlamic Conference (OIC), is poised for a greater role on the world’s\n\n102 • FOREST RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF MALAYSIA\n\nstage. In April 2004, Abdullah convened an OIC special meeting\n\non the Middle East at Putrajaya as a result of the invasion of Iraq.\n\nMeanwhile, diplomatic and trading ties continue to be fostered with\n\nWestern democracies as well as with the rising Asian giants China\n\nand India, while maintaining good relations with Japan.\n\nFOREST RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF MALAYSIA (FRIM). The\n\nForest Research Institute of Malaysia at Kepong, Selangor, is the\n\nforemost tropical forest research center in the world. Its herbarium\n\nhas over 150,000 plant species and is a central repository for plant\n\nspecimens collected throughout the country. Established in 1929,\n\nFRIM’s objective through research is to generate knowledge and de-\n\nvelop suitable scientific methodology and technology for the conser-\n\nvation, management, development, and utilization of forest resources.\n\nMoreover, it has an obligation to provide research-based services and\n\nto commercialize research findings to benefit the country’s forestry\n\nindustry sectors. The FRIM Museum (1952) helps educate the gen-\n\neral public on their rich forest heritage and displays the various wood\n\nspecies and their utility and products.

Initially mooted by Malaya’s Prime\n\nMinister Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj in May 1961, the\n\nconcept of Malaysia envisaged a wider federation comprising the\n\nFederation of Malaya, the British Crown colonies of Singapore,\n\nNorth Borneo (Sabah), and Sarawak, and the British protectorate\n\nof the sultanate of Brunei. It was a means to counter the leftist’s\n\ninfluence in Singapore as well as to balance the ethnic equation in\n\nfavor of indigenous peoples vis-à-vis the Chinese. Despite various\n\nobstacles in its formation, Malaysia was inaugurated on 16 Septem-\n\nber 1963.\n\nSeveral measures were put in place for realizing Malaysia: the\n\nSingapore referendum for merger (1 September 1962); a Malaysia\n\nSolidarity Consultative Committee (1961) chaired by Donald (later\n\nFuad) Stephens; a Malaysian Commission of Enquiry (1962) led by\n\nLord Cobbold (hence, Cobbold Commission); an intergovernmen-\n\nGAMELAN • 103\n\ntal committee to formulate Malaysia’s Constitution headed by Lord\n\nLansdowe; and a United Nations mission (June 1963). North Bor-\n\nneo and Sarawak were subsequently won over to the Malaysia con-\n\ncept but insisted on safeguards, namely the “Twenty Points.” Brunei\n\ndecided to stay out as issues over the position of the sultan and oil\n\nrevenue were unresolved. Socialist groups adamantly rejected the\n\nidea of Malaysia as it might jeopardize their agenda of establishing\n\na socialist state. Indonesia launched Konfrontasi (1963–1966) and\n\nthe Philippines pushed for the Sabah claim. Nonetheless, on 16 Sep-\n\ntember 1963, the federation of Malaysia comprising the Federation\n\nof Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, and North Borneo (renamed Sabah),\n\nwas inaugurated. In 1965, Singapore seceded, and in 1966 Indonesia\n\nended Konfrontasi, and diplomatic relations were reinstated with the\n\nPhilippines (1966) and Indonesia (1967).\n\nFUSION CUISINE. Fusion cuisine refers to the marriage of Western\n\nand Oriental dishes in terms of the admixture of ingredients and prep-\n\naration, ultimately producing a unique taste that is neither East nor\n\nWest. Hainanese cooks in European households of British Malaya\n\nwere the initial architects of fusion cuisine, serving pork or chicken\n\nchop that utilized light and dark soy sauce for the gravy. Contempo-\n\nrary fusion cuisine includes such dishes as pizza with beef rendang\n\ntoppings, and stir-fried spaghetti with shrimp and bean sprouts served\n\nwith sambal belacan (a spicy chili condiment).\n\n–G–\n\nGAMELAN. Gamelan, a traditional Javanese percussion orchestra of\n\nbrass or bronze instruments, was adapted and adopted by Malay roy-\n\nalty of the Malay Peninsula; initially, the music was from the royal\n\ncourts of Johor-Riau and Pahang (early 19th century) and from Pah-\n\nang and Terengganu (early 20th century)—hence, Gamelan Pahang\n\nand Joget Pahang respectively. As its Malay characteristics became\n\nprominent, a name change occurred to Joget Gamelan and Gamelan\n\nMelayu. Altogether there are eight instruments: gong agung and gong\n\nsuwakan (two large, hanging, knobbed gongs); kenong (five large,\n\nhorizontally placed gongs); kerumong (10 small, horizontally placed\n\n104 • GANGGA NAGARA\n\ngongs); saron barung and peking (bronzed-keyed instruments); gam-\n\nbang kayu (wooden xylophone), and gendang (double-headed barrel\n\nhand-beaten drum). Gamelan witnessed a revival in 1969 when the\n\nTerengganu Joget Gamelan performed in Kuala Lumpur. See also\n\nMUSIC.\n\nGANGGA NAGARA. The Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals) mentioned\n\na pre-15th-century kingdom by the name of Gangga Nagara that\n\nstood on a hill at Dinding on the left bank of the Perak River. It was\n\nbelieved that this ancient Indianized kingdom began about the 5th\n\ncentury, had its heyday in the 8th and 9th centuries, and declined in\n\nthe 11th century following raids by the Tamil Cola kingdom of South\n\nIndia on Srivijayan outposts along the Straits of Melaka. Beruas, a\n\nMalay-Muslim kingdom on the left bank of the Perak River that sought\n\nmilitary assistance from the Malay Sultanate of Melaka in the 15th\n\ncentury (as stated in the Sejarah Melayu), is often cited as a possible\n\nsite of Gangga Nagara or even of the ancient kingdom itself, albeit with\n\na name change. However, no archeological excavations at Beruas have\n\nunveiled any ancient kingdom. But Gangga Nagara might possibly be\n\nlocated further inland, consequent of the discovery of pre-6th century\n\nBuddhist bronze images at Tanjung Rambutan (1908) and Pengkalen\n\n(1931) in the Kinta Valley. However, Buddhist artifacts of the Srivi-\n\njayan era (7th–13th centuries) were unearthed in various parts of the\n\nKinta Valley, indicating a shifting of the ancient kingdom’s capital.\n\nGangga Nagara’s existence remains at best speculative and inconclu-\n\nsive, but undeniably there were Buddhist settlements in the Kinta Val-\n\nley contemporaneous with Srivijaya.\n\nGAWAI (ANTU, DAYAK). The Iban and Bidayuh of Sarawak\n\ncommemorate Gawai festivals. There are several Gawai in the Iban\n\ncalendar, notably Gawai Padi (or Gawai Batu) and Gawai Antu; the\n\nlatter honors the souls of ancestors with offerings of food, tuak (rice\n\nwine), and much merrymaking. Shrunken skulls, trophies from past\n\ngenerations when headhunting was practiced among the Ibans, are\n\n“feasted” with food and liquor. Contributions in funds and labor are\n\nexpected from all members of a longhouse, as the rituals, foods, and\n\nbeverages can be costly. It is imperative that an Iban participates in a\n\nGawai Antu at least once in his lifetime. Gawai Padi is a festival cel-\n\nGEORGE TOWN • 105\n\nebrating the successful rice harvest and to pray for a bountiful return\n\nin the forthcoming season when the Gawai Miring is held as a thanks-\n\ngiving to Pulang Gana and other deities who are invited to peruse\n\nthe harvest and to celebrate the success. It is a weeklong festival in\n\nthe Iban fifth month (corresponding to June) where much food, tuak,\n\nlengkau (rice whiskey), and dancing are enjoyed by the longhouse\n\ncommunity. To the Bidayuh, Gawai Padi is the most important, the\n\n“real” Gawai. The Sarawak government designated 1 June 1965 as\n\nGawai Dayak, making it a public holiday. This state-imposed cel-\n\nebration is a variant of the aforesaid Gawai Padi.\n\nIn the weeks prior to Gawai, Dayak homes and ancestral graves\n\nare given a thorough cleaning. The family reunion dinner on the eve\n\nwitnesses the youngest presenting a platter of specially prepared food\n\nto his or her parents, symbolizing respect and reverence; the oldest\n\nfamily member delivers a speech offering advice to the whole fam-\n\nily. At midnight, the sampi ritual is performed on the ruai (frontage)\n\nin front of the tuai rumah’s (head of the longhouse) bilek (compart-\n\nment). A toast to longevity is made with ai pengayu (a special rice\n\nwine). Thereafter, there is unrestrained feasting, dancing, and drink-\n\ning. Ngajat (war dance) is performed. In cities like Kuching, the\n\nOpen House tradition is practiced when Ibans and Bidayuhs invite\n\nfriends, colleagues, and relatives to their house for feasting and mer-\n\nrymaking. Politicians, communal leaders, notables, and corporate\n\nfigures hold Open Houses.\n\nGEORGE TOWN. Occupying the northeast promontory of the island\n\nof Penang, George Town, named in honor of England’s King George\n\nIII (1738–1820), was established in 1786 when country trader Cap-\n\ntain Francis Light took possession on behalf of the English East\n\nIndia Company (EEIC). As a city-port where trade and commerce\n\nwere its lifeline, George Town welcomed immigrants; hence, Eur-\n\nasians, Chinese, Acehnese, Arabs, Jews, Armenians, Indians (Mus-\n\nlims, Hindus, Sikhs), Malays, Siamese (Thai), Burmese (Mynma-\n\nrese), Europeans, Javanese, Japanese, and other sojourners initially\n\nsettled there. The cosmopolitan character was reflected in various\n\nethnic and sociocultural enclaves. Contemporary Pitt Street (Jalan\n\nKapitan Keling) has the houses of worship of various world reli-\n\ngions in proximity to one another: St. George’s (Anglican) Church,\n\n106 • GERAKAN RAKYAT MALAYSIA\n\nKuan Im Temple, Kapitan Keling Mosque, and Sri Mahamariamman\n\nTemple. George Town has 180,573 inhabitants (2000 census) with\n\nChinese (mainly Hokkien) comprising more than 70 percent; hence,\n\nit is basically a Chinatown. Its once prosperous and influential Baba\n\nNyonya community has steadily declined since the 1970s. George\n\nTown has continued its tradition of culinary delights of a variety of\n\ntasty and inexpensive street foods (nasi kandar, char koay teow,\n\nlaksa, mee goreng). The city’s streetscape features the biggest as-\n\nsortment of shop houses from various periods (ca. late 19th century\n\nto contemporary). In July 2008, “Melaka and George Town, Historic\n\nCities of the Straits of Malacca” were declared to be UNESCO World\n\nHeritage Sites, further boosting George Town’s potential as a popular\n\ntourist destination.\n\nGERAKAN RAKYAT MALAYSIA (GERAKAN; MALAYSIAN\n\nPEOPLE’S MOVEMENT). Established in Penang in 1968 by\n\nformer members of the dissolved United Democratic Party (UDP)\n\nand the Labour Party, Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia positioned itself\n\nas a noncommunal political party with a multiethnic membership.\n\nProfessor Syed Hussain Alatas was Gerakan’s pro tem chairman;\n\nTun Dato’ Seri Dr. Lim Chong Eu assumed the chairmanship from\n\n1968 to 1980, then Dato’ Seri Dr. Lim Keng Yaik followed from\n\n1980 to 2006, and finally with Tan Sri Dr. Koh Tsu Koon as acting\n\nchairman since 2006. Its main support comes from English-educated\n\nmiddle-class Chinese as well as from trade unionists (consequent\n\nto its Labour Party background). Gerakan as an opposition party\n\ncaptured Penang in the 1969 general election to form the state gov-\n\nernment. Subsequently, in 1972, Gerakan joined the ruling Alliance\n\nParty coalition. As a strategy to achieve a wider support, Gerakan\n\nshifted its headquarters to Kuala Lumpur in 1996. Despite not hav-\n\ning a majority of seats in the state legislative assembly (its coalition\n\npartner United Malays National Organization [UMNO] having the\n\nmost seats), Penang had two Gerakan chief ministers, namely Lim\n\n(1969–1990) and Koh (1990–2008).\n\nGOLD. Suvarnabhumi (Land of Gold) and Golden Khersonese were\n\nearly references to the Malay Peninsula, giving the impression that\n\nit was an auriferous-rich area. Fabulous rumors of possible vast de-\n\nGOTONG-ROYONG • 107\n\nposits of gold and other valuable minerals were common among early\n\ntravelers, but in most cases were but mere rumors not substantiated\n\nin fact. Gold deposits that were actually worked in the Malay states\n\nwere in Raub, Pahang, and Bau, Sarawak. Chinese Hakka gold\n\nminers had been working the gold at Bau since the 1820s; by the late\n\n19th century, it had almost been exhausted. However, the application\n\nof the cyanide process in gold extraction by the Borneo Company\n\nLimited (BCL) resuscitated the industry. See also MINING.\n\nGOLDEN KHERSONESE. From the 13th century, Geographike\n\nHuphegesis (Guide to Geography) is a map showing lands bordering\n\nthe Indian Ocean and the South China Sea and a peninsula labeled\n\n“Golden Khersonese” vaguely corresponding to the Malay Penin-\n\nsula. Golden Khersonese implies the presence of gold. This map ap-\n\nparently drew from materials collected by Greek astronomer and ge-\n\nographer Cladius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy; 90–168 B.C.E.). On Golden\n\nKhersonese are toponyms “Takola, an emporium,” a center where\n\nforeign trade was conducted on a regular basis and taxed. While\n\nTakola is on the northern portion (presumably present-day southern\n\nMyanmar or southern Thailand), another emporium named Sabara is\n\nsituated on the southern extremity (presumably present-day Johor).\n\nA third coastal town Kole or Koli Polis situated on the east coast of\n\nthe Malay Peninsula was also mentioned (speculated to be modern\n\nKelantan). Accompanying this 13th-century map is a manuscript\n\nthat shows on Golden Khersonese a mountain range where a river\n\nsystem emanates. Four towns are listed but without their location:\n\nKalonka, Konkonagara, Tharra, and Palanda. Scholarly speculation\n\npoints to the map and notes as portraying a protohistoric transpenin-\n\nsular portage system. See also SUVARNABHUMI.\n\nGOTONG-ROYONG. A phrase that denotes working together and\n\ncooperation that was popular during the 1960s and 1970s and that\n\nencouraged communal labor among Malaysia’s multiethnic peoples.\n\nTraditionally, Malay padi (rice) rural farming communities empha-\n\nsized working with one another to accomplish the heavy tasks of till-\n\ning, sowing, transplanting, and harvesting. Likewise, Malay fishing\n\ncommunities worked as a team rather than independently. Gotong-\n\nroyong campaigns were often organized by community leaders and\n\n108 • GOVERNMENT\n\nlocal politicians to get people to collectively clean up the neighbor-\n\nhood drains, build public amenities like small bridges, and paint the\n\nplayground facilities—activities that benefited the community as a\n\nwhole. It was an attempt to instill a community spirit, cohesiveness,\n\nand unity among the people, particularly imperative in a multiethnic\n\nsociety.\n\nGOVERNMENT. Malaysia inherited the Westminster model of con-\n\nstitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy. The Malay\n\nsultans, the Malay states, and British colonial rule contributed to the\n\ncontemporary Malaysian form of government. Owing to the presence\n\nof nine sultans, a unique rotational system was devised to provide the\n\nYang Di-Pertuan Agong (king of Malaysia) for a five-year term de-\n\ncided upon (through elections) by the Majlis Raja-Raja (Conference\n\nof Rulers). Each of the nine states (Perlis, Kedah, Perak, Selangor,\n\nNegeri Sembilan, Pahang, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Johor) has\n\nits sultan, while Penang, Melaka, Sarawak, and Sabah each has its\n\nYang Di-Pertua Negeri (head of state). A minister heads the federal\n\nterritories of Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Labuan. While each\n\nsultan is the head of Islam in his respective state, the Agong acts in\n\nthis capacity for Penang, Melaka, Sarawak, and Sabah.\n\nThe Federal Constitution guarantees the separation and inde-\n\npendence of the three branches of government: executive, legisla-\n\ntive, and judiciary. The executive branch comprises the cabinet of\n\nministers headed by the prime minister; all appointments are on a\n\nfive-year basis following the cycle of general elections. The cabinet\n\nabides by the principle of collective responsibility.\n\nThe bicameral legislature comprises the Dewan Negara (Senate)\n\nand Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives). Parliament com-\n\nprises the Agong, the Dewan Negara, and Dewan Rakyat. Malaysia’s\n\ndemocratic electoral process follows the simple-majority system\n\nof the “first-past-the-post” method. Elected governments are given\n\na five-year mandate. An independent Election Commission (EC)\n\nconducts parliamentary and state elections, determines electoral con-\n\nstituencies, and maintains the electoral rolls.\n\nThe judiciary branch caters to the principle of the rule of law with\n\na court system from the grassroots Penghulu’s Court and Native\n\nCourts to the Federal Court. Paralleling the secular civil and criminal\n\nGREAT BRITAIN, RELATIONS WITH • 109\n\nsystem is the Islamic Syariah Court system that administers Islamic\n\nsyariah laws for Muslims. In 1993, a Special Court was set up to ad-\n\ndress offenses perpetrated by any of the Malay sultans.\n\nThe apolitical public service, the government’s administrative ma-\n\nchinery, is headed by the chief secretary. Local governments provide\n\nbasic amenities and operate under the jurisdiction of the respective\n\nstate governments; the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan,\n\nand Putrajaya come under the Federal Territories Ministry. Internal\n\nsecurity is the responsibility of the Royal Malaysia Police, while\n\nnational defense is guaranteed by the Malaysian Armed Forces. The\n\nlatter comprises three branches: Malaysian Army, Royal Malaysian\n\nAir Force (RMAF), and Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN). See also\n\nPOLITICAL PARTIES.\n\nGREAT BRITAIN, RELATIONS WITH. The English East India\n\nCompany (EEIC), having lost out in the spice trade in the Malay\n\nArchipelago to the Dutch, withdrew to the Indian subcontinent,\n\nleaving a single outpost of Benkulen in Sumatra. Then in the 1780s,\n\nthe EEIC returned due to the Anglo–French rivalry in India and the\n\nlucrative China trade in luxuries (tea, silk, porcelain). The opening\n\nof Penang, off the northwestern Malay Peninsula, in 1786 as a free\n\nentrepôt port marked the beginning of eventual British penetration\n\ninto the Malay states. Owing to Penang’s distance from Dutch activ-\n\nities in the East Indies (present-day Indonesia), Singapore, in greater\n\nproximity to Dutch Java, was established in 1819 as a free port. The\n\nAnglo–Dutch Treaty (Treaty of London) of 1824 settled their pro-\n\ntracted rivalry by arbitrarily dissecting the Straits of Melaka: territo-\n\nries to the north came under the British sphere of influence and those\n\nto the south, the Dutch sphere. Melaka was exchanged for Benkulen.\n\nIn consolidating their command of the Straits of Melaka for the China\n\ntrade, the Straits Settlements was set up in 1826.\n\nPrior to the 1870s, the British refrained from interfering in the\n\nMalay states. Informal intervention on occasions was justified to\n\nsafeguard British interest vis-à-vis the extension of Siamese he-\n\ngemony. Although aiding an individual Englishman, (Sir) James\n\nBrooke, who acquired the Bornean territory of Sarawak and became\n\nits White Rajah in 1841, the Royal Navy did assist him in clearing\n\nthe northwestern Bornean coasts of piratical activities. Labuan,\n\n110 • GREAT BRITAIN, RELATIONS WITH\n\nguarding Brunei Bay, became a British colony in 1847. The EEIC\n\nwas disbanded in 1858 and its possessions passed to the British gov-\n\nernment. Following the transfer to the Colonial Office in London in\n\n1867, the Straits Settlements became Crown colonies. The European\n\nmercantile community in the Straits Settlements, in partnership with\n\nChinese entrepreneurs, invested in the profitable tin industry of the\n\nWestern Malay States during the late 1840s and 1850s. Disputes\n\nbetween Malay nobles over the throne, quarrels among Chinese fac-\n\ntions over mining issues, rivalry among local Malay chieftains, and\n\npiratical activities along the coast adversely impacted tin production\n\nand caused losses for investors.\n\nThe Pangkor Engagement (1874), which resolved various dis-\n\nputes, defined Anglo–Malay relations for the next seven decades\n\nwith the imposition of the British residential system of indirect co-\n\nlonial rule, transforming the Malay states into British protectorates.\n\nTheoretically, a British officer-styled resident, acted as an advisor\n\nto the Malay ruler; in reality, however, the resident administered the\n\nMalay state in the name of the sultan. The 1880s witnessed Brooke\n\nSarawak extending eastward to the Baram (1883) and Trusan (1887)\n\nat the expense of Brunei, and the British North Borneo Chartered\n\nCompany (BNBCC) establishing its administration of British\n\nNorth Borneo in 1881. In 1888, Sarawak, North Borneo (Sabah),\n\nand Brunei became British protectorates and collectively comprised\n\nBritish Borneo. In 1905, the Lawas was acquired from Brunei, thus\n\nestablishing Sarawak’s present-day configuration. The Siamese Ma-\n\nlay States came under British control through the Anglo–Siamese\n\nTreaty (Treaty of Bangkok) of 1909.\n\nBy 1910, British Malaya was constituted. Comparatively, British\n\nBorneo with its exports of gold, oil, and timber paled against Brit-\n\nish Malaya as the world’s largest producer and exporter of tin and\n\nrubber for more than six decades of the 20th century. The British\n\norchestrated the immigration of Indian labor for the rubber industry.\n\nThe anglicized Malay elite, graduates of the Eton-style Malay Col-\n\nlege, Kuala Kangsar, was the product of a policy aimed at nurturing\n\na Malay ruling class that was pro-British in attitude and deportment.\n\nA class of English-educated urban Chinese, Eurasians, and Sinha-\n\nlese who benefited from government and Christian mission English-\n\nlanguage schools served as subordinate staff in the colonial bureau-\n\nGREAT BRITAIN, RELATIONS WITH • 111\n\ncracy and European commercial establishments (agency houses,\n\nbanks, insurance, shipping, etc.). British invincibility was shattered\n\nwhen Singapore surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) in\n\nFebruary 1942 in the Pacific War (1941–1945). Sarawak and North\n\nBorneo had earlier succumbed to the Japanese in December 1941 and\n\nJanuary 1942 respectively.\n\nGreat Britain’s postwar administrative framework of the Malayan\n\nUnion (1946–1948) faced immense Malay opposition, which was\n\nrallied through the United Malays National Organization (UMNO)\n\nled by aristocratic leaders and the Malay sultans. British colonial\n\nadministrators negotiated with representatives of the Malay sultans\n\nand UMNO, resulting in the Federation of Malaya, which replaced\n\nthe Malayan Union in 1948. In mid-1946, Sarawak and North Borneo\n\n(Sabah) were ceded to Britain and became Crown colonies. Protests\n\nby the anticession movement from a section of the Sarawak Malay\n\ncommunity climaxed in the assassination of Duncan Stewart, the sec-\n\nond British colonial governor, in 1949. Meanwhile, an underground\n\ncommunist movement was conducting subversive activities against\n\nthe Sarawak colonial government. On the peninsula, the Malayan\n\nEmergency (1948–1960) was declared to counter the armed insurrec-\n\ntion of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). Troops from the com-\n\nmonwealth (Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji) assisted British military\n\nunits and the Malay Regiment in the jungle war against communist ter-\n\nrorists (CTs). At the same time, British colonial authorities facilitated\n\nlocal elections culminating in the pre-Merdeka general election (27\n\nJuly 1955) to the Federal Legislative Assembly, which ushered in the\n\nself-rule government of Chief Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra\n\nAl-Haj (1955–1957). By then, Britain was reassured and had confi-\n\ndence in Tunku’s ability to lead a multiracial Malaya to independence.\n\nTunku led the Merdeka (independence) mission to London for talks.\n\nOn 31 August 1957, Malaya attained independence. Nonetheless,\n\nMalaya remained tied militarily to Britain under the Anglo–Malayan\n\nDefence Agreement (AMDA) of 1957 whereby British troops re-\n\nmained on Malayan soil to safeguard British commercial interests.\n\nMalaya also became a member of the commonwealth. Malayaniza-\n\ntion saw Malayans replacing British personnel in the civil service.\n\nTies with London remained strong and cordial, particularly in educa-\n\ntion and trade. When Malaysia was initially mooted in 1961, there\n\n112 • GREAT DEPRESSION\n\nwere accusations from Indonesia of a neocolonial plan by Britain to\n\nprolong its presence in the region. When Konfrontasi (September\n\n1963–August 1966) was launched, the AMDA came to the fore\n\nwith military forces from Australia and New Zealand to assist their\n\nBritish and Malaysian counterparts. In 1971, Malaysia adopted the\n\nFive-Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) under which—although\n\nBritain remained a partner in addition to Australia, New Zealand, and\n\nSingapore—no British military units remained in the country.\n\nDespite diversifying its diplomatic and economic ties with a host\n\nof nations, Malaysia continued to maintain good relations with\n\nBritain. But strained relations were evident in the early 1980s when\n\nPrime Minister (Tun) Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad launched a\n\n“Buy British last” campaign in retaliation against the abolition of\n\nstudy grants to overseas students at British universities and the cur-\n\ntailment of landing rights at London’s Heathrow Airport. But it was\n\na brief downturn and had scant long-term impact. Relations again\n\nbecame strained when in 2003 Britain joined the United States in\n\nthe invasion of Iraq.

The concept\n\nof the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere advocated that Impe-\n\nrial Japan would free East and Southeast Asia from Western colonial\n\nrule and thereafter create a “co-prosperity sphere” under Tokyo’s\n\nleadership. Imperial Japan’s push into the Chinese mainland, in ini-\n\ntiating the Pacific War (1941–1945), and the Japanese Occupation\n\n(1941–1945) of most of Southeast Asia, were designed to establish\n\nthe co-prosperity sphere. The concept was first mooted by military\n\nHARI RAYA AIDIL FITRI • 113\n\ncadres in 1938 shortly after the outbreak of the Second Sino–Japanese\n\nWar (1937–1945). But for all intents and purposes, the co-prosperity\n\nsphere concept was a mere camouflage for Imperial Japan to dominate\n\nEast and Southeast Asia and to incorporate them into the Imperial\n\nJapanese Empire. The sphere was divided into three sectors: the self-\n\nreliant sector (Japan, North China, Mongolia, and Manchuria); the\n\ndefense sector (Siberia, central and southern China, Southeast Asia\n\neast of Burma); and the economic sector (India and Australia). Not-\n\nwithstanding the propagandistic tone of the liberation of the colonized\n\nterritories that began to be emphasized in September 1940, the real\n\nobjective of invasion and occupation of the aforesaid lands was to\n\nsecure their strategic resources (oil, rubber, tin, timber, foodstuffs).\n\n–H–\n\nHARI RAYA AIDIL-ADHA. Celebrated on the 10th day of Dzulhij-\n\njah, Hari Raya Aidil-Adha signals the fulfillment of all obligations\n\nof the hajj (pilgrimage). Dzulhijjah, the 12th month of the Muslim\n\nHijrah calendar, is the sacred month of the hajj where Muslims visit\n\nthe Kaabah in Mekah (Mecca). Those who had fulfilled the hajj, one\n\nof the five obligatory pillars of Islam, are referred to as Haji (male)\n\nand Hajjah (female)—hence, the celebration is also referred to as\n\nHari Raya Haji. Muslims in Malaysia attend special prayers at the\n\nlocal mosque. Thereafter, cows and goats are slaughtered as sacrifice\n\n(korban), likening it to the act of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham; s.a.w.)\n\nwhose love for Allah (God) made him willing to sacrifice his one and\n\nonly begotten son, Ismail. Having witnessed his strong faith, Allah\n\ncommanded that a lamb in lieu of his son be sacrificed—hence, Hari\n\nRaya Korban. The blessed meat is distributed to the less fortunate.\n\nThe Korban and thereafter the kenduri (communal feasting) are high-\n\nlights of the celebrations. See also FESTIVALS; RELIGION.\n\nHARI RAYA AIDIL FITRI. Commemorated on the first day of\n\nSyawal, Hari Raya Aidil Fitri is a thanksgiving celebration follow-\n\ning the completion of fasting (puasa) during the preceding month\n\nof Ramadan in the Muslim Hijrah calendar. In Malaysia, Malay-\n\nMuslims (like Muslims all over the world) observe a dawn-to-dusk\n\n114 • HARRIS MOHD SALLEH, DATUK\n\nfast during Ramadan to cleanse one’s physical and spiritual well-be-\n\ning and review one’s faith. Hari Raya Aidil Fitri in essence celebrates\n\nrejuvenation—physically, mentally, and spiritually. Preparations\n\noften begin several weeks prior when new clothes are bought, a fresh\n\ncoat of paint is given to the house, and traditional kuih-muih (cakes\n\nand cookies) are made. Festive delicacies such as ketupat (triangular-\n\nshaped glutinous rice and beans), lemang (glutinous rice and coconut\n\nmilk cooked in bamboo), and rendang (spiced beef) are prepared\n\non the eve of Syawal. The celebration begins with a special morn-\n\ning prayer at the local mosque. Thereafter, families usually visit the\n\ncemeteries of ancestors to offer prayers. Maaf Zahir Batin, translated\n\nas “Seeking forgiveness from within and from without,” are uttered\n\nby the young to their seniors. It is a time for forgiveness, reconcilia-\n\ntion, and burying the hatchet of any untoward developments during\n\nthe past year. This seeking of forgiveness is undertaken with visits\n\nto homes of relatives and friends as well as by partaking of festive\n\ndelicacies. Children in groups go from house to house within the\n\nkampung (village) to ask for duit (money).

One of the longest\n\nserving chief ministers of Sabah, Harris Mohd Salleh of Malay–\n\nKedayan heritage was a civil servant until persuaded in 1961 by\n\nTun Datu Mustapha bin Datu Harun to enter politics and join the\n\nUnited Sabah National Organization (USNO). Two years later, he\n\nbecame secretary-general of USNO, in 1965 leader of its youth wing,\n\nand subsequently in 1971 the party’s deputy president. In the first\n\nSabah state elections that USNO won, he was appointed state min-\n\nister of finance in Chief Minister Tun Mustapha’s state cabinet. But\n\nstrained relations with Tun Mustapha led Harris Salleh (as he is better\n\nknown) to join ranks with Tun Mohd Fuad (Donald) Stephens to\n\nform the Parti Bersatu Rakyat Jelata Sabah (BERJAYA; Sabah Peo-\n\nple’s United Party) in July 1975 to challenge the incumbent USNO.\n\nIn 1976, BERJAYA came to power with Tun Mohd Fuad Stephens as\n\nchief minister; Harris Salleh was deputy chief minister and minister\n\nHEADHUNTING • 115\n\nof rural development.

Haze, unlike fog or mist, occurs when suspended microscopic\n\ndry particles like dust or soot cause an opalescent appearance of the\n\natmosphere. It reduces visibility to less than one kilometer and causes\n\nhumidity to be 95 percent or less. Haze can persist over several con-\n\nsecutive days if not weeks. Malaysia first experienced this form of\n\nair pollution in the 1980s; between 1983 and 1997, seven haze epi-\n\nsodes occurred in Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia. The Klang\n\nValley and Kuala Lumpur, both highly industrialized and built-up\n\nareas, were adversely affected. Besides emissions from motor ve-\n\nhicles and industrial operations, contributors to haze in Malaysia are\n\nopen burning and land clearing for swidden agriculture and timber\n\nextraction activities in neighboring countries. Haze-induced respira-\n\ntory complaints, especially among asthmatic patients, pose a major\n\nhealth concern. Negotiations are underway between governments in\n\nSoutheast Asia to effectively address the haze phenomenon. See also\n\nENVIRONMENT.\n\nHEADHUNTING. The taking of human heads, or headhunting, was\n\na traditional cultural practice of various natives of present-day Sar-\n\nawak (Ibans, Kayans and Kenyahs, Kelabits and Lun Bawang).\n\nA prolific headhunter was recognized as a brave warrior and war\n\nleader, and also desirable as a prospective mate. Headhunting was\n\ninevitable as a ritual termination of the mourning period that re-\n\nquires a trophy head. Human heads were also recognized as booty\n\nbrought back from bejalai. The White Rajahs of Brooke Sarawak\n\nhad proscribed headhunting with capital punishment and payment of\n\ndeterrent fines with much-prized valuable, antique Chinese dragon\n\njars that the natives kept as family heirlooms. Ironically, as a result of\n\nutilizing downriver pro-Brooke natives to pacify upriver recalcitrant\n\n116 • HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE\n\ngroups, there was an increase in headhunting during Brooke rule.\n\nInterestingly, in order not to transgress adat, trophy heads kept at\n\nthe resident’s office in Simanggang (Bandar Sri Aman) were lent out\n\nto fulfill ritual requirements. During the Pacific War (1941–1945)\n\nand Japanese Occupation (1941–1945), Allied advanced parties of\n\nBritish and Australian soldiers were parachuted into the northeastern\n\nhighlands in early 1945 and trained, armed, and encouraged natives\n\nto take Japanese heads, hence reviving an age-old custom.\n\nHEALTH AND HEALTH CARE. In the precolonial period, Malays,\n\nOrang Asli, Chinese, and other inhabitants in the Malay Peninsula\n\nas well as the ethnic minorities in Sabah and Sarawak relied on\n\ntraditional healing methods and age-old remedies to address health\n\nissues. Intercession from deities through the bomoh, bobohizan, kee-\n\ntong (medium), and shaman helped overcome ailments and ensure\n\nwell-being of individuals and the community. Western medicine and\n\nuniversal medical practices were introduced with the establishment\n\nof colonial rule. Due to the adverse impact of tropical diseases and\n\nother ailments (malaria, beriberi, dysentery, typhus, leprosy, etc.) on\n\nthe workforce, the colonial government in 1900 set up the Institute\n\nfor Medical Research (IMR) in Kuala Lumpur (KL). Opium\n\nsmoking and opium addiction were rife among the Chinese coolies in\n\nthe tin and mining industries of the Malay states and posed a pub-\n\nlic health issue; one in three Chinese adults was affected in the last\n\nquarter of the 19th century. Anti-opium campaigns headed by three\n\nWestern-trained medical doctors Yin Suat Chuan (b.1877) and Lim\n\nBoon Keng (1869–1957), both of Singapore, and Wu Lien-teh of\n\nPenang managed to move the general public as well as the colonial\n\nauthorities to take steps to eradicate this pernicious habit.\n\nSince Merdeka (independence), the government, which is respon-\n\nsible for the provision and development of public health care, has\n\ngiven continuous attention to and placed emphasis on upgrading the\n\nhealth of the population. The allocation of funds for public health\n\ncare has been increasing over the years; for instance, RM3.73 bil-\n\nlion was allocated under the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996–2000),\n\nwhich rose to RM5.50 billion during the Eighth Malaysia Plan\n\n(2001–2005). A vast amount of public expenditure was channeled\n\nto the construction of new health facilities and the upgrading of old\n\nHEALTH AND HEALTH CARE • 117\n\ninfrastructure. The provision of hospitals, polyclinics, mobile dental\n\nand medical units, and the implementation of health education to the\n\npublic in urban and rural areas throughout the country are the prime\n\nresponsibilities of the federal Ministry of Health.\n\nThe 1990s ushered in new developments in Malaysia’s health-\n\ncare sector. The Ministry of Health utilized information technology\n\n(IT) to focus on nonmedical, administrative purposes such as in the\n\ndissemination of health information, quality control, management,\n\nand budget performance assessment. Privatization and the entry of\n\nthe private sector in health care were further developments. In line\n\nwith the National Privatization Policy, some medical and nonmedical\n\nservices were privatized. For example, in 1992 the Institut Jantung\n\nNegara (IJN; National Heart Institute) was privatized, subsequently\n\nfollowed by the government’s general medical store in 1993. Non-\n\nmedical support services such as general maintenance and laundry\n\nwere both tendered to private firms from 1995.\n\nLong-standing charitable organizations such as Christian mission-\n\nary societies and Chinese towkay and foundations have established\n\nnonprofit private hospitals such as the Seventh Day Adventist\n\nHospital, Tung Shin Hospital, Hospital Lam Wah Ee, and Tai Wah\n\nHospital. These private hospitals are sustained through generous con-\n\ntributions from philanthropists and public subscriptions. Hospitals\n\nthat were commercial concerns were few, owing to the low returns.\n\nHowever, since the 1990s there has been an increase in the estab-\n\nlishment of commercially run private hospitals in major urban areas\n\nsuch as KL, Shah Alam, George Town, and Ipoh. Health tourism,\n\na recent phenomenon since 2003–2004, has also attracted invest-\n\nments in health care from the private sector. The majority of foreign\n\nclients are from Indonesia and Thailand, and a few from Australia\n\nand Great Britain. As a means to further attract foreigners for medi-\n\ncal care, international accreditation certifications are imperative for\n\nboth public and private hospitals, notably the Malaysian Society for\n\nQuality in Health (MSQH), ISO 9001: 2000, and Joint Commission\n\nInternational (JCI).\n\nIn 2005, the facility-to-population ratio for government hospitals\n\n(128 units) was 1:204 and beds (34,761 units) 1:751. Life expectancy\n\nwas 73.5 years in 2005. Infant mortality was 5.1 per 1,000 live births\n\nand crude death rates, 4.4 per 1,000.\n\n118 • HEAVY INDUSTRIES CORPORATION OF MALAYSIA\n\nDespite the ruling that requires newly qualified doctors to serve a\n\nminimum of three years attached to public hospitals, there remains a\n\nshortage in the medical workforce, especially of specialists. In 2008,\n\nthere were more than 10 medical schools in the country and each\n\nyear students on government scholarships leave for medical stud-\n\nies abroad, mainly to Britain, India, Indonesia, and Russia. Doctors\n\nleaving for private practice and nursing personnel taking up lucrative\n\njobs in West Asian hospitals are the two major challenges facing the\n\npublic health-care sector.

Over the years, HICOM has had numerous name changes\n\nfrom the New Serendah Rubber Company Berhad (1910), HICOM\n\n(1980), to the wholly owned enterprise Heavy Industries Corporation\n\nof Malaysia Limited or HICOM Berhad (1993). HICOM Berhad was\n\nentrusted with the identification, initiation, planning and designing,\n\nimplementation, and management of heavy industrial projects. It\n\nhas interests in realty development, transport, building materials,\n\nand services industries. Diversified Resources Berhad (DRB) was\n\nestablished in 1990 initially to restructure Imatex Berhad, a property\n\ndevelopment company. DRB was also involved in the manufacture\n\nand assembly of monocoque buses and Pinzgauer all-terrain vehicles.\n\nDRB was awarded the contract for the automated inspection of com-\n\nmercial vehicles (PUSPAKOM). In 1994, DRB, in a joint venture\n\nwith PROTON (Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Sendirian Berhad;\n\nNational Car Industry Private Limited) and others, was tasked to\n\ndevelop, manufacture, and market the first national PROTON cars\n\n(the Proton Saga). DRB set up MODENAS (Motosikal dan Enjin\n\nNasional Sendirian Berhad; National Motorcycle and Engine Private\n\nLimited) in 1995 to produce Malaysia’s first motorcycle (Kriss). In\n\nNovember 1995, DRB–HICOM Berhad emerged following a restruc-\n\nturing, merger, and consolidation exercise.

Although meaning “all types of histories” in Arabic, hi-\n\nkayat in Malay language and literary context refers to “story,” “tale,”\n\nor “the story of.” The hikayat genre narrates real-life stories but\n\nintermixes the story with supernatural beings (gods and goddesses),\n\nheavens, and magic, all packaged into a moral narrative where good\n\novercomes evil, the former rewarded and the latter punished. Hi-\n\nkayat was rendered in oral storytelling, and in written and printed\n\nform. The Indian-Hindu epics, the Râmâyana and Mahâbhârata,\n\ninfluenced and enriched Malay hikayat. The advent of Islam brought\n\ntales of the prophets and historical Islamic personages (warriors and\n\nprinces) into Malay literature through translation, adaptation, and\n\nretelling. Hikayat Hang Tuah and the Sejarah Melayu (Malay An-\n\nnals; based on the Hikayat Melayu) are but two renowned examples\n\nof the hikayat genre, both nominated into the UNESCO “Memory of\n\nthe World” program.\n\nHINDU RIGHTS ACTION FORCE (HINDRAF).

The Hindu–Buddhist period in Malaysia (and South-\n\neast Asia) between the first century B.C.E. and the 13th century C.E.\n\nwitnessed the initial emergence of urban centers and states. Suvar-\n\nnabhumi (Land of Gold), referring to the Malay Peninsula and/or\n\nSumatra, was a probable reference to the richness of Southeast Asia\n\nin general and hinted that Indian traders had sought trade with the\n\nregion as early as 200 B.C.E. Previous suggestion of a sociocultural\n\ncolonization by Indian colonists was unverified, as recent findings\n\npointed to a more promising stage of development among the in-\n\ndigenous Malays in the Bronze and Iron Ages prior to the adoption\n\nof Hinduism and Buddhism. The Hindu–Buddhist period is char-\n\nacterized by the introduction of Sanskrit literacy, the concepts of\n\nkingship and statecraft, and Hinduism and Buddhism. Two locations\n\nin Peninsular Malaysia that bear evidence to this period are Kuala\n\nSelinsing and the Bujang Valley. The Kuala Selinsing site, a Malay\n\nsettlement, thrived between the second and fourth centuries C.E. on\n\n120 • HINDUISM\n\nthe southwest coast of the Malay Peninsula. Findings of glass and\n\ncarnelian beads suggest that it was engaged in trade with the Oc Eo\n\ncomplex in southern Vietnam and the Philippines. Excavations in the\n\nBujang Valley, encompassing the Muda and Merbok rivers of Ke-\n\ndah, revealed numerous Hindu and Buddhist monuments. Pengkalan\n\nBujang and Sungai Mas attested to be trading sites, as evidenced by\n\nceramic artifacts. The reconstructed Candi Bukit Pahat of the Bujang\n\nValley illustrated local Malay creative input in producing a temple\n\nthat reflected Hindu and Mahayana Buddhist architectural character-\n\nistics with no counterpart in India itself but bore similarities with a\n\ncandi at the Santubong site in southwest Sarawak and in Sumatra.\n\nThe legacy of the Hindu–Buddhist period are seen in loan words\n\nfrom Sanskrit in the Malay language (raja = ruler; negeri = country;\n\nbahasa = language), and are reflected in various rituals and titles, the\n\nnotions of kingship in the Malay royal courts, and the concept of der-\n\nhaka (durhaka) on Malay political culture. See also SRIVIJAYA.\n\nHINDUISM. Adherents of Hinduism comprised 6.3 percent of Malay-\n\nsia’s total population of 23.27 million (2000 census). It forms the\n\nmain belief system of the majority of Indians in Malaysia, particu-\n\nlarly those who are descended from Tamil immigrants from South\n\nIndia. Hinduism, a way of life, subscribes to two basic concepts:\n\ndharma and moksha. Dharma stresses a prescribed system of reli-\n\ngious and sociocultural ways of behavior. Moksha is often equated\n\nwith salvation, that is, the ultimate release from the worldly cycles\n\nof birth and rebirth to attain unity with God. Hence, by adhering to\n\ndharma, one can break through the successive life forms (samsara)\n\nwhere one’s soul, guided by karma (moral law of cause and effect),\n\ncould attain eternal bliss or moksha. The pantheon of gods and\n\ngoddesses of Hinduism is varied and complex, with the Trinity of\n\nBrahma, Vishnu, and Shiva (Siva) at the apex. Hindus believe that\n\nthe gods and goddesses are mere manifestations of one singular su-\n\npreme god. The Veda is Hinduism’s scriptural text and was compiled\n\nsometime between 1500 and 500 B.C.E.\n\nHinduism does not differentiate between the religious and the\n\nsecular. Some Malaysian Hindus are Shaivites, the followers of\n\nShiva, while others are Vaishnavites, worshippers of Vishnu. In re-\n\ncent decades, there has been a religious revival and a proliferation of\n\nHISHAMUDDIN TUN HUSSEIN ONN, DATUK SERI • 121\n\nreligious education among Hindus. The Hindu Darma Mamandram,\n\nMalaysia Hindu Sangam, and the Arulneri Thirukkoottam are some\n\nof the Hindu organizations that conduct religious classes to bring\n\ntogether the Hindu community. Meanwhile, there are various move-\n\nments currently active in Malaysia that follow the preaching of saints\n\nand spiritual leaders and draw followers from among urban middle-\n\nclass Indians and even Chinese. Prominent among such movements\n\nare Hare Krishna movement, Satya Sai Baba Society, Church of the\n\nShaiva Siddhanta, Ananda Marga, Brahma Kumaris, and Divine Life\n\nSociety. These movements are active in social welfare work and\n\nphilanthropic pursuits.\n\nHISHAMUDDIN TUN HUSSEIN ONN, DATUK SERI (1961–).\n\nDatuk Seri Hishamuddin Tun Hussein Onn is the son of Tun Hus-\n\nsein Onn, Malaysia’s third prime minister (1976–1981). Like his\n\nfather, Hishamuddin graduated from Lincoln’s Inn, London, as a bar-\n\nrister. Initially working with a law firm in Kuala Lumpur, he later\n\nset up his own practice. He came into political prominence when the\n\nleadership of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO),\n\nheaded by Prime Minister (Tun) Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, came\n\nunder harsh criticism in 1998. Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, UMNO Youth\n\nchief and allied to Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim, deputy president and\n\ndeputy prime minister, delivered a scathing speech alleging corrup-\n\ntion in the leadership (read: Mahathir). Hishamuddin was Ahmad’s\n\ndeputy and kept a low profile. Then, when the fallout began in late\n\n1998, Anwar was sacked from UMNO and arrested on corruption\n\ncharges; Ahmad and others allied to him (Anwar) were sidelined, and\n\nHishamuddin stepped up to head UMNO Youth. A brief time in vari-\n\nous portfolios in Mahathir’s cabinet finally landed him the reputedly\n\npowerful post of minister of education (2004–present). Hishamuddin\n\nwas known to be accommodating and prepared to dialogue with vari-\n\nous educational interest groups, including the influential Dong Jiao\n\nZong (United Chinese Schools Committees’ Association). But his\n\nmisstep in the keris issue—unsheathing a keris (asymmetrical dag-\n\nger) in a ritual during the UMNO meeting—sparked fear and suspi-\n\ncions among non-Malays in the mid-2000s. This controversy, some\n\nquarters believed, was a contributing factor when the ruling Barisan\n\nNasional (BN; National Front), of which UMNO was a dominating\n\n122 • HUI\n\nforce, suffered an unprecedented electoral defeat in the 12th Malay-\n\nsian general election of 8 March 2008.\n\nHUI. From the Chinese, hui refers to a society, association, clan, or dia-\n\nlect-based union. A popular occurrence in Malaysia is the huiguan,\n\nmeaning an association formed by Chinese who came from a particu-\n\nlar district often identified with the dialect—for instance, Hokkien\n\nHuiguan (Hokkien Association). Hui carries another connotation:\n\n“sworn brotherhood” or “secret society,” such as the well-known\n\nT’ien Ti Hui (Heaven and Earth Society), which was a band of Chi-\n\nnese patriots who sought to overthrow nonindigenous dynasties on\n\nthe mainland. Hui in the Straits Settlements and in the Western\n\nMalay States provided the sinkheh (newly arrived guests) a mu-\n\ntual support group of sworn ritual brotherhood. Blood oaths, secret\n\nsigns, and a myriad of rituals bind members to the hui and to each\n\nother. Owing to their network, the hui operated as coolie brokers and\n\nmanaged revenue farms (opium, gambling, etc.). Clashes between\n\nrival hui over economic stakes (tin mining land, urban territory, and\n\nothers) were common. Sarawak and North Borneo (Sabah) noted\n\nthe subversive doctrines of hui (anti-Qing/Manchu) and proscribed\n\ntheir existence at an early stage. Following the so-called Chinese\n\nRebellion of 1857, Sarawak was vigilant to curb any semblance of\n\nhui. Repeated outbreaks of hui wars and street fights led the British\n\ncolonial authorities to proscribe them in the Straits Settlements and\n\nthe Malay states. See also KONGSI; LARUT WARS; PANGKOR\n\nENGAGEMENT.\n\nHUSSEIN ONN, TUN (1922–1990). Eldest son of Dato’ Onn bin\n\nJa’afar, founder and president of the United Malays National\n\nOrganization (UMNO), Tun Hussein Onn was trained as a military\n\nofficer (captain) who saw action with the British army in the Middle\n\nEast during World War II (1939–1945). After the war, he joined the\n\nMalay Administrative Service and briefly served in Selangor and\n\nJohor. He entered politics and was the first chief of UMNO Youth\n\n(1950–1951). He left UMNO with his father to set up the Indepen-\n\ndence of Malaya Party (IMP), which had little success. Hussein took\n\nleave to pursue a law degree at Lincoln’s Inn, London, returning in\n\n1958 to practice in Kuala Lumpur. A decade later, his brother-in-\n\nIBAN • 123\n\nlaw Tun Abdul Razak bin Hussein, then deputy prime minister,\n\npersuaded Hussein to return to UMNO. By mid-1969, Hussein was a\n\nUMNO supreme council member and a member of Parliament (East\n\nJohor Bahru). In Razak’s cabinet, he served as minister of educa-\n\ntion (1970). In UMNO, he was elected vice president. Following the\n\nuntimely passing of Tun Dr. Ismail Abdul Rahman (1915–1973)\n\nin August 1973, Hussein became acting deputy president of UMNO\n\nand acting deputy prime minister.\n\nThe sudden demise of Razak on 14 January 1976 saw Hussein tak-\n\ning on the dual responsibility of acting president of UMNO, and on\n\n15 January as Malaysia’s third prime minister (1976–1981). Uphold-\n\ning the rule of law, he imposed emergency rule in Kelantan when\n\nDato’ Haji Mohamed Nasir, the menteri besar (chief minister), who\n\nfaced a vote of no-confidence in the state assembly, refused to step\n\ndown. Staunchly against corruption, Hussein won the day when Dato’\n\nHarun bin Haji Idris, menteri besar of Selangor and UMNO Youth\n\nchief who was involved in a RM6.5 million loss in Bank Rakyat\n\n(People’s Bank), was investigated, tried, and convicted. Harun was\n\nsacked from UMNO. Hussein succeeded in overcoming opposition to\n\nthe New Economic Policy (NEP; 1971–1990) from various quarters,\n\nnotably the Associated Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry\n\nof Malaysia. He introduced the Amanah Saham National (ASN;\n\nNational Unit Trust Fund) scheme and promoted the Rukun Tetangga\n\n(Neighborhood Committees), the former to help bumiputera and the\n\nlatter to foster greater interaction among the various ethnic communi-\n\nties. Hussein retired as prime minister in July 1981. He passed away\n\non 29 May 1990 in San Francisco.\n\n–I–\n\nIBAN. Numbering 657,700 (2004 est.), the Iban represent Sarawak’s\n\nlargest group of indigenes, accounting for one third of its total popu-\n\nlation. The Iban lived in their traditional settlements in the river sys-\n\ntems of the Batang Lupar, Saribas, and Rejang rivers. Migration from\n\nCentral Borneo during the 17th and 18th centuries to seek new lands\n\nresulted in Iban settlements in the Saribas-Skrang area, present-day\n\nSri Aman Division, which remains the Iban heartland. Traditionally,\n\n124 • IBRAHIM YAACOB\n\nIban subsistence from swidden hill padi (rice) cultivation made the\n\nsearch for virgin forest essential for survival and fostered a highly\n\nmobile and martial people. Headhunting for martial prowess and\n\nritual obligations were age-old practices of the Iban (then known\n\nas Sea Dayaks) until proscribed by the Brooke White Rajahs. The\n\nlonghouse was and still is the major dwelling for the Iban, and it\n\nresembles a federated union of bilek (compartment) families that\n\nmost often are bound by kinship ties. Egalitarian Iban society fos-\n\ntered meritocracy and independence but at the same time emphasized\n\ncooperation (in hunting and in gathering jungle products) and con-\n\nformity, particularly to adat (custom). Young male Iban undertake\n\nbejalai as a rite of passage ritual, venturing into the world to seek\n\ntheir fortune and acquire new life experiences.\n\nAdherence to the traditional beliefs, rituals, and commands of the\n\nadat remains among contemporary Iban communities, excluding\n\nthose that have embraced Christianity (Anglicanism and Catholi-\n\ncism). Iban from Saribas were the first indigenous people receptive\n\nto education offered by European missionaries in the 19th century.\n\nEducation opens up wider employment opportunities, allowing Iban\n\nparticipation in the public and private sectors. The merger in 1974 of\n\nthe Iban-based Parti Pesaka Sarawak with the Parti Bumiputera that\n\nrepresented Muslim bumiputera (Malay and Melanau) to establish the\n\nParti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB; United Indigenous Rights\n\nParty) offered a political voice for the Ibans. The Parti Rakyat Sar-\n\nawak (PRS), which was established in 2004 and replaced the deregis-\n\ntered Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak (PBDS), and the Sarawak Progres-\n\nsive Democratic Party (SPDP), a breakaway of the defunct Sarawak\n\nNational Party (SNAP), are two other Iban-based political parties. The\n\nPBB, PRS, and SPDP are component parties of the Barisan Nasional\n\n(BN; United Front).

Ibrahim Yaacob was the founding\n\npresident of the Kesatuan Melayu Muda (KMM; Young Malays\n\nUnion), which sought independence of Malaya from Great Britain.\n\nA schoolteacher, journalist, and writer, Ibrahim utilized his writings\n\nto awaken Malay sociopolitical consciousness. With Japanese sup-\n\nIMMIGRANT LABOR • 125\n\nport, he acquired the daily Warta Malaya in 1941, transforming it\n\ninto an anti-British propaganda tool. After Ibrahim was imprisoned\n\nby the British, the Japanese military authorities released him in\n\nFebruary 1942. During the Japanese Occupation (1941–1945), the\n\nImperial Japanese Army (IJA) appointed him lieutenant colonel of\n\nthe Malai Gun (Malayan Army) or Pembela Tanah Air (PETA; De-\n\nfenders of the Motherland). Advocating Melayu Raya and Indonesia\n\nRaya, which envisage the unity of the Malay Archipelago, Ibrahim\n\nand others established the Kesatuan Rakyat Indonesia Semenanjung\n\n(KRIS; Union of Peninsula Indonesians) in July 1945. The sudden\n\nJapanese surrender (15 August 1945) and the hasty declaration of\n\nIndonesia’s independence (17 August 1945) left Ibrahim and KRIS\n\nstranded. On 19 August 1945, Ibrahim and his wife, Onan Siraj,\n\nleft for Jakarta, where he participated in the Indonesian Revolution\n\n(1945–1949). Meanwhile, in Malaya, the Partai Kebangsaan Melayu\n\nMuda (PKMM; National Party of Malay Youth) in 1950 gave Ibra-\n\nhim full mandate to organize the struggle against British colonial\n\nrule. Thereafter, through representatives, Ibrahim formed the Kesat-\n\nuan Malaya Merdeka (KMM; Union of Independent Malaya) in June\n\n1950. In the face of the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), the Brit-\n\nish colonial government proscribed PKMM and KMM. Ibrahim’s\n\nradical, left-leaning views and advocacy of pan-Malay/pan-Indonesia\n\nwere too extreme for the British, who preferred to deal with moder-\n\nates and aristocrats in the United Malays National Organization\n\n(UMNO).\n\nIMMIGRANT LABOR. The 1840s saw an influx of immigrant labor\n\ninto the Malay Peninsula. The coolie traffic from southern China,\n\ninitiated, organized, and operated by Chinese syndicates (secret so-\n\ncieties), supplied the much-needed labor for the booming tin industry\n\nin the Western Malay States. The credit-ticket system was the com-\n\nmon labor recruitment mechanism: a sinkheh (newly arrived guest)\n\nwas contracted to an employer who paid the syndicate the sinkheh’s\n\ntravel expenditure. Consequently, the sinkheh was compelled to\n\nserve this employer for a specified period (usually three years) as\n\nrepayment of his boat passage from China. As an indentured worker,\n\nhe was a de facto property of his employer, forbidden to change\n\nemployer, and closely monitored lest he abscond. Ill treatment was\n\n126 • IMMIGRANT LABOR\n\ncommonplace. This trafficking of coolies was known as the “pig\n\ntrade,” since the sinkheh was treated like a trade commodity. Thou-\n\nsands of Chinese coolies arrived annually at Penang and Singapore;\n\nthereafter, they were brought to work the tin mines that dotted the\n\nKinta Valley, Klang Valley, and Sungai Ujong (later Negeri Sem-\n\nbilan). The low wages of Chinese coolies enabled labor-intensive\n\nChinese-owned tin mining operations to dominate the mining sec-\n\ntor of the Western Malay States until the early 20th century. Sub-\n\nsequently, Chinese indentured labor was proscribed by the British\n\ncolonial government in 1914.\n\nCommercial agriculture recruited Indian and Chinese workers\n\nbeginning with the sugar plantations of Province Wellesley in the\n\nearly 19th century, followed by coffee in the 1880s and 1890s in the\n\nMalay states. The rubber boom of the early 20th century spurred\n\nthe wave of South Indian Tamil immigrant labor to British Malaya.\n\nThe British colonial authorities in India and Malaya orchestrated the\n\nimmigration of Tamil labor. The Tamil worker arrived with his wife\n\nand children. Recruitment was either by indenture or the kangany\n\nsystem; the former served the sugarcane industry while the latter\n\nworked for coffee plantations. The kangany or foremen returned\n\nto his home village in India to recruit workers. Unlike indentured\n\nworkers, recruits under the kangany system were morally obligated\n\nthrough familial or kin ties with the kangany, hence few absconded.\n\nPlantation owners facilitated housing, schools for workers’ children,\n\nand clinics.\n\nFree or unassisted immigrant labor in both mining and plantation\n\nsectors was comparatively small. During economic slumps, notably\n\nthe Great Depression (1929–1931), many mine and plantation work-\n\ners were repatriated. Furthermore, restrictions were imposed on male\n\nimmigrants entering Malaya; consequently, Chinese women arrived\n\ninstead, working mainly as amah-chieh (domestic servants), samsui\n\n(in construction), and others as prostitutes. Immigrant labor was the\n\nsingle contributing factor to the multiethnic population of present-\n\nday West Malaysia. The 1980s and 1990s witnessed immigrant labor\n\nfrom Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, China, and Bangladesh, primar-\n\nily in the construction and plantation sectors (palm oil). The majority\n\nof females (mainly from Indonesia) work as domestic servants in\n\nprivate households.

There are 1.8 million (2004 est.) Indians in Malaysia, or 7\n\npercent of the total population, who form a disparate group in terms\n\nof language, ancestral origins, religion, caste, class, and occupa-\n\ntional niches. Indian ethnic subgroups are: Indian Tamil, Malayali,\n\nTelugu, Sikh, Punjabi (excluding Sikhs), Pakistani, Bangladeshi,\n\nSri Lankan Tamil, and Sinhalese. The Indian Tamil is the largest\n\nethnic subgroup, comprising 85 percent (2004 est.). Archeological\n\nartifacts and historical records point to an Indian presence in the Ma-\n\nlay Peninsula in the first century C.E., notably a flourishing Indian\n\nport-colony in Kedah’s Bujang Valley and later in Langkasuka. An\n\nIndian mercantile colony was established in the entrepôt port of the\n\nMalay Sultanate of Melaka (ca. 1400–1511). Intermarriages with\n\nlocal Malays produced the eclectic Chitty community of present-day\n\nMelaka and the Jawi Peranakan of George Town, Penang. Indian\n\npolitical philosophy—the concept of kingship (devaraja), sover-\n\neignty (daulat), betrayal (derhaka [durhaka]), rituals, court titles,\n\nand language—remained evident in the nine Malay sultanates.\n\nLarge-scale Indian emigration and permanent settlement com-\n\nmenced in the 19th century. Indian convicts and laborers were trans-\n\nported in the early part of the century to the Straits Settlements to\n\nundertake public infrastructure works; indentured labor was recruited\n\nfor the sugar industry of Province Wellesley. In the late 19th cen-\n\ntury, thousands of Indian laborers were procured for jungle clear-\n\nance for large-scale commercial agriculture (tea, coffee, coconut,\n\nand rubber), and railroad and road construction, while hundreds\n\nserved as stevedores at the ports of Penang and Singapore. The Brit-\n\nish colonial bureaucracy, Western agency houses, banks, shipping,\n\nand insurance firms engaged English-educated Sri Lankan Tamils\n\nand Sinhalese as clerical and submanagerial staff. But it was British\n\n128 • INDIANS\n\nMalaya’s celebrated rubber industry that absorbed the bulk of the\n\nIndian Tamil immigrant labor.\n\nThe spatial distribution of the Indian community adhered to the\n\nhistorical patterns of settlement; the majority lived in Selangor,\n\nPerak, Negeri Sembilan, and Johor with plantation agriculture\n\nand pockets in Kedah and west Pahang. The traditional multitiered\n\ncaste system was discarded in favor of the dual-tier system of higher\n\nand lower castes that remained relevant in contemporary marriage\n\narrangements. Hinduism is the most popular religion of the Indian\n\ncommunity, especially among the Indian Tamil. Thaipusam and\n\nDeepavali are major Indian festivals in addition to hundreds of other\n\nreligious and cultural celebrations throughout the year.\n\nAccessibility to educational facilities led to a greater number of In-\n\ndians who managed to escape the vicious cycle of the estate as rubber\n\ntappers and unskilled labor. Indians have benefited from the affirma-\n\ntive action of the New Economic Policy (NEP) in accessibility to\n\ntertiary education. Overall, members of the Indian community—de-\n\nspite wider disparities between the haves and have-nots—enjoy a\n\nhigher socioeconomic level than their forefathers ever dreamed of in\n\nthe pre-Merdeka (independence) period.\n\nSince independence, the Malayan (Malaysian) Indian Congress\n\n(MIC) has remained the dominant political voice for the Indian com-\n\nmunity. A partner of the Alliance Party and thereafter the Barisan\n\nNasional (BN; United Front), Indians rely heavily on the MIC to fight\n\nfor their rights and interests vis-à-vis the Chinese, Malays, and other\n\nindigenous minorities. Undoubtedly, the MIC has contributed much\n\nin elevating the socioeconomic position of the community. However,\n\nprotests from the Hindu Rights Action Force (HINDRAF) in Novem-\n\nber 2007 in Kuala Lumpur revealed that the community suffered\n\nfrom discrimination and marginalization. HINDRAF’s actions were\n\ndirected at both the MIC and the BN government for shortcomings\n\nand negligence of minorities. The Indian-based People’s Progressive\n\nParty (PPP), established in 1953 and a member of the BN coalition,\n\nappears to be the alternative to the MIC in championing the cause of\n\nthe Indian community, especially following the unprecedented elec-\n\ntoral setbacks dealt the MIC in the 12th Malaysian general election\n\nof 8 March 2008.

The Malay Peninsula had long-\n\nestablished relations with the archipelagic expanse of territories that\n\ntoday constitutes the Republic of Indonesia. Immigrants from neigh-\n\nboring Sumatra (Acehnese, Batak, Minangkabau, Jambi), Borneo\n\n(Banjarese, Malay), to Java (Javanese, Madurese), and as far as Su-\n\nlawesi (Bugis) had arrived over the centuries, with many sojourners\n\nbecoming residents and masuk Melayu, further enriching the plural\n\npopulation. Trade and Islam contributed to the initial contacts and\n\nengendered a sense of “Malayness” within the Malay Archipelago.\n\nThe Anglo–Dutch Treaty (Treaty of London) of 1824 effectively\n\ndivided insular Southeast Asia into British and Dutch spheres; hence,\n\nthe former created British Malaya and British Borneo, and the lat-\n\nter, the Netherlands (Dutch) East Indies. Politically, Malay groups\n\nsuch as the Kesatuan Melayu Muda (KMM; Young Malay Union)\n\nand its postwar reincarnation the Partai Kebangsaan Melayu Muda\n\n(PKMM; National Party of Malay Youth) and others subscribed\n\nto the radical nationalism of Indonesia and nurtured the concept of\n\nMelayu Raya (Greater Malay) and Indonesia Raya (Greater Indo-\n\nnesia), a vision of a unified Malay world comprising contemporary\n\nIndonesia, Malaysia, southern Thailand, and southern Philippines.\n\nInterestingly, it was Imperial Japan that joined the administration of\n\nMalaya and Sumatra during the Pacific War (1941–1945), realizing\n\na partial Indonesia Raya.\n\nKonfrontasi (1963–1966), launched by Indonesia’s President Su-\n\nkarno, soured Malaysia–Indonesia relations. But by 1967, both—to-\n\ngether with Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines—inaugurated\n\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Since the\n\n1980s, there has been an increasing cross-straits migration, both legal\n\nand illegal, of Indonesians seeking economic opportunities in Malay-\n\nsia. Indonesians served as inexpensive, unskilled labor for the planta-\n\ntion and construction sectors while females served as live-in domes-\n\ntics with urban Malaysian families. Illegal Indonesian migrants pose\n\na delicate issue between Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta; rounding up\n\nof illegal workers was a nightly routine of the Malaysian authorities.\n\nMalaysia has been unduly tolerant of the annual haze phenomenon\n\nthat pollutes the environment in the peninsula and Sarawak. None-\n\ntheless, a sense of Malayness binds Malaysia–Indonesia relations.\n\nSee also FOREIGN POLICY.\n\n130 • INDUSTRY\n\nINDUSTRY. Industrialization started in the 1950s with import substi-\n\ntution, producing consumer products (mainly beverages and canned\n\nfoodstuff) for local needs. Tax-relief incentives and tariff protection\n\nof selected industries were incorporated in the Pioneer Industries Or-\n\ndinance (1958). Then, between 1968 and 1980, the focus was shifted\n\nto export orientation with the Investment Incentives Act (1968) and\n\nthe Free Trade Zone Act (1975) to boost foreign direct investments\n\n(FDIs). In 1975, the Industrial Coordination Act (ICA) ensured that\n\nmanufacturing licenses were issued where equity ownership and\n\nemployment structure were in line with the New Economic Policy\n\n(NEP; 1971–1990). Import substitution was rejuvenated in the 1980s,\n\nemphasizing heavy industries for national strategic considerations\n\nresulting in the 1983 national car project, and the promotion of steel\n\nand cement industries. Three Industrial Master Plans (IMPs)—IMP1\n\n(1986–1995), IMP2 (1996–2005), and IMP3 (2006–2020)—ensured\n\nthat Malaysia’s industrialization program was structured and moni-\n\ntored in striving toward the Vision 2020 goal of attaining fully indus-\n\ntrialized nation status by 2020. All IMPs stressed export orientation\n\nfor the long-term competitiveness of the industrial sector.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is the most dynamic one and increased\n\nits share of gross domestic product (GDP) from 12.8 percent in 1960\n\nto 47.8 percent in 2007, far outpacing agriculture (8.6 percent).\n\nManufacturing employed a workforce of 3 million in 2005 (251,939\n\nback in 1970). Manufactured goods accounted for 80.5 percent\n\nof total exports in 2005 (11.9 percent in 1971). The electrical and\n\nelectronic industries have dominated the manufacturing sector since\n\n1970. In 2005, electrical and electronic exports represented 65.8 per-\n\ncent of total exports of manufactured goods and 18.3 percent of the\n\nworkforce of the manufacturing sector. The bulk of industrial estates,\n\nfree-trade zones (FTZs), specialized industrial estates (SIEs), and\n\ntechnology parks are located along the western corridor of Peninsular\n\nMalaysia with concentrations in Penang, Kedah, Perak, Selangor,\n\nNegeri Sembilan, and Melaka. SIEs cluster within a single location\n\na community of manufacturers, suppliers, service providers, and\n\nother related ancillary support.\n\nIn line with its Look East policy, Malaysia encouraged the setting\n\nup of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In 1996, the Small\n\nand Medium-Scale Industries Development Corporation (SMIDEC)\n\nINSTITUT JANTUNG NEGARA • 131\n\npromoted the development of SMEs. In the 1990s, emphasis in in-\n\ndustrialization was on export-oriented, high-value-added, and high-\n\ntechnology industries. The Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) and\n\nthe National Biotechnology Policy (2005) sought to propel the nation\n\ntoward its ultimate aim of achieving fully industrialized nation status\n\nby 2020. Industrialization has resulted in greater participation of\n\nwomen in the labor force as well as foreign workers. The hastening\n\npace of the growth of industrial estates and urbanization impacted on\n\nthe built landscape, new lifestyles and family structures, and socio-\n\neconomic trends.\n\nThe construction industry has developed hand in hand with the\n\ncountry’s economy and social lifestyle by erecting residential hous-\n\ning, industrial and commercial buildings, and infrastructure. Notable\n\nconstruction showcases include the Merdeka Stadium (1957), the\n\nKlang Gates Dam and water supply scheme (1958), the Cameron\n\nHighlands hydroelectric power scheme (1958–1959), Parliament\n\nHouse (1963), Subang International Airport (1965), George Town’s\n\nKompleks Tun Abdul Razak (KOMTAR; Tun Abdul Razak Com-\n\nplex), the Penang Bridge (1985), Kuala Lumpur International\n\nAirport (KLIA; 1998), Sepang International Circuit (1999),\n\nPetronas Twin Towers (2004), and public transport systems like the\n\nNorth–South Expressway (NSE), light rail transit (LRT), monorail,\n\ncommuter railway, and the Express Rail Link (ERL). Foreign work-\n\ners from neighboring countries formed 70 percent of the workforce of\n\nthe construction sector in 2001.
