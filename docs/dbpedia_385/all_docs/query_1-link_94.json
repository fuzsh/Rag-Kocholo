This book began as a collection of the papers that were presented at the conference, but have been revised and updated through 2016-2017. The authors have diligently and patiently worked with us to make this collection a timely and substantive contribution to understanding contemporary Malaysia and Singapore. We would like to acknowledge those who have made this publication possible. Firstly, we would like to thank all the contributors for their hard work and cooperation. It is cliché but without the contributors, this book would not be possible. The contributors are all specialists working on Malaysia and Singapore; some of them for decades. Gratefully, they went out of the way to find time to update and revise their essays. We would also like to thank the ANU for its support of the update and the collection. In particular, we would like to acknowledge, Professor Michael Wesley, the Director of the Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs, Professor Andrew Walker (now at Monash Malaysia), Associate Professor Greg Fealy and Dr. John Funston of the College of Asia and the Pacific and Professor Robert Cribb from the School of Culture, History and Language. We would also like to thank Professor Craig Reynolds for the important feedback he gave us on the collection. In getting the book to publication, we would like to thank Alp Eren Topal who assisted with the formatting of the essays, Kay Lyons for the copy-editing and Janice Chong for the formatting and cover design. We are grateful to Pak Chong for his support of the book at SIRD and to Brian Hill at Lexington Books (am imprint of Rowman and Littlefield) for publishing the collection. We would also like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their support of the collection. Special and heartfelt thanks are extended to Charles Brophy at SIRD who shepherded the book to publication in the final xi\n\nxii\n\nRegime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\nstages. Without his hard work the publication would not have been possible. Bridget Welsh would like to thank Ipek University in Ankara and her Turkish colleagues for their support during the period where the initial revisions for the collection were made. While the Erdogan government has since closed the university, the spirit of comradery remains as does the shared commitment to a freer and fairer world. Gratitude is extended to her current colleagues at John Cabot University in Rome where the final tasks associated for the book were completed. Finally, the editors would like to thank our families and friends. Greg Lopez would especially like to thank Francis and Denise for their understanding and endless love. Greg Lopez and Bridget Welsh\n\nRethinking Regime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\n1\n\nChapter 1\n\nRethinking Regime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore Bridget Welsh and Greg Lopez\n\nIn July 2015 the Wall Street Journal revealed that nearly $700 million dollars from the Malaysian government-owned development company 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) had been deposited into Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak’s personal bank account.1 Subsequent revelations pointed to $4.5 billion in questionable allocations, as part of one of the worst moneylaundering scandals in history, in a company with nearly $11 billion in debt that was founded on a Malaysian government guarantee. Over two years later, Najib remains in office, having appeared to weather the allegations of corruption and kleptocracy. Within Malaysia he has been cleared of any wrong-doing, and while internationally 1MDB legal proceedings remain on-going, Najib remains in power. In fact, his coalition, Barisan Nasional (BN, National Front), seems poised to win re-election in 2018, returning his party, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), to power. While Brazil and South Korea have seen their leaders jailed for corruption, in Malaysia the leader survives, and arguably has emerged in greater control of the levers of executive power than before the scandal. Najib has shown himself to be of the political resilience mould long honed by his political party – at least so far.\n\n1\n\nFor more details on the 1MDB scandal, see: http://www.wsj.com/specialcoverage/ malaysia-controversy and Kerstin Steiner, ‘Economics, politics and the law in Malaysia: a case study of the 1MDB scandal’, in Sophie Lemiere (ed.), Illusions of Democracy: Malaysian Politics and the People Volume II (Petaling Jaya: SIRD, 2017), pp. 245–70.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nRegime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\nFurther south across the Causeway, Singapore echoes a similar story of resilience. While allegations of criminal wrong-doing have not been levied against its Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (LHL), criticism of Lee’s stewardship and that of his party, People’s Action Party (PAP), has grown in recent decades. The most controversial reprove of late has come from unexpected sources, that of Lee’s own family. His siblings have accused him of using his office for personal gain – to oppose the wish of Lee Kuan Yew (his father, who founded and governed Singapore for over thirty years) to demolish the family home on Oxley Road – and allegedly protect the family legacy for the current prime minister and his children’s political interests.2 The ‘Oxleygate scandal’, as it has been dubbed, raises questions about the deeply embedded personal relationship between the Lee family and political power in Singapore. This comes on the back of the 2011 election, in which the PAP lost nearly 40 per cent of the popular vote and an unprecedented number of parliamentary seats.3 The party was able to bounce back in the 2015 general election, winning a thumping victory on the sentiment surrounding the death of Lee Kuan Yew and the country’s fiftieth anniversary.4 Two years later, however, the shine over the victory has faded with a slowing economy, prominent governance problems in areas such as transportation, and public uncertainty about the future leadership of Singapore. Nevertheless, this criticism has done little to fundamentally challenge the PAP’s predominant political position. While fewer years in office, the PAP and its leadership are secure and ever resilient in power. Globally, Malaysia and Singapore stand out as among the longest incumbent regimes in office. While Malaysia has been officially governed\n\n2\n\nFor more details see coverage in the South China Morning Post: http://www.scmp. com/week-asia/politics/article/2100795/lee-family-feud-key-questions-singaporespm-faces-grilling and Michael Barr, ‘Squabbling Lees highlight Singapore’s dynastic dilemma’, The Diplomat, 27 June 2017. https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/ squabbling-lees-highlight-singapores-dynastic-dilemma/ 3 See Kevin Y.L.

UMNO is essentially Malaysia’s government, with the other incumbent coalition members increasingly irrelevant or marginalised. Singapore’s PAP, on its part, has been unquestionably in control of the island since 1959 (and of the nation since it separated from Malaysia in 1965). Over half a century since decolonisation, Malaysia and Singapore have yet to experience an alternative party in national government. Views of governance by these political parties in these countries vary. There are those who point to high economic growth numbers and political stability, giving credit to the dominant parties’ stewardship. They tout the success of these countries on multiple fronts, from managing ethnic tensions to their models of economic expansion.5 Kent Calder’s book, for example, highlights the embrace of technocratic knowledge as crucial for the city state’s success.6 North of the Causeway, Malaysia continues to be showcased for its management of ethnic relations, as it has avoided broad ethnic violence for nearly fifty years since the tragic May 1969 riots. At the same time, there are those who see the pattern of governance very differently, as one of exclusion, authoritarian rule and uneven distribution of economic gains.7 Malaysia and Singapore are among the most unequal societies in Southeast Asia (along with Thailand).8 And while ethnic conflict is not on the streets, ethnic relations and inequalities remain serious concerns in both countries.9 Within these societies, citizens are also sharply divided over how they 5\n\n6 7 8 9\n\nMalaysia, for example. has been featured as an example of multi-ethnic cooperation. See Arend Lijphart ‘Consociational democracy’, World Politics, 21(2) (1969): 211–14. Singapore has received the most accolades, largely for its economic achievements. See, for example, Henri Ghesquiere, Singapore’s Success: Engineering Economic Growth (Singapore: Cengage Learning, 2007). Kent Calder, Singapore: Smart City, Smart State (Washington DC: Brookings Institution, 2016). See, for example, Garry Rodan, Transparency and Accountability in Southeast Asia: Singapore and Malaysia (London: Routledge, 2004). World Economic Forum, Inclusive Growth and Development Report 2017 (Geneva: World Economic Forum, 2017). See, for example, Muhammed Abdul Khalid, The Colour of Inequality: Ethnicity, Class, Income and Wealth in Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur: MPH Books, 2014) and Garry Rodan, ‘Capitalism, inequality and ideology in Singapore: New challenges for the ruling party’, Asian Studies Review 40(2) (2016): 211–30.\n\n4\n\nRegime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\nperceive their quality of governance by the dominant parties and leaders. This polarisation is evident in the electoral results of the last two national elections in both countries. In Malaysia, public support for the incumbent party has been declining, with the 2008 and 2013 general elections key indicators of this drop. In 2008, the BN lost its two-thirds majority in parliament, and in 2013, it lost the majority of the popular vote. The opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat, won 50.9 per cent of the popular vote compared to UMNO/BN’s 47.4 per cent despite unprecedented efforts by the ruling coalition to woo the electorate and heightened efforts to break up the opposition.10 In Singapore, the 2011 election was a wake-up call, as 40 per cent of citizens abandoned PAP. While this did not yield a large share of the seats, due to the manipulation of the electoral system, it provoked strong reactions within the system to rebuild support.11 PAP managed to win back 10 per cent of the vote in the September 2015 general election, but over 30 per cent stayed opposed to PAP rule and support for a political alternative and viable opposition remains high. As shown in Figure 1, broadly, since independence, in both countries public support for the incumbent dominant parties has been on a downward trajectory. Despite the overall decline, however, PAP remains comfortably strong, having recorded 60 per cent or more popular support in all eleven general elections, while UMNO has only overcome the 60 per cent threshold of popular support in four of the thirteen general elections to date. Of the two dominant parties, UMNO is facing the greater decline in support, with more challenges ahead for its leaders to hold onto power.12 This collection of essays looks at how and why the dominant parties in Malaysia and Singapore have been so successful in staying in office. With its focus on developments in the last ten years, the collection draws attention to recent measures leaders and parties in these countries have adopted to ensure they maintain their dominant political positions.

This collection is distinguished from others in that it draws from a variety of disciplines and perspectives, moving our understanding of regime resilience outside of the traditional rubric of political science. Importantly, the essays incorporate a better understanding of society, the law and economy in how these factors are intertwined with the resilience of the regimes. They also serve as an important update on earlier studies of regime resilience in both countries, developed below. Finally, in laying out a broad understanding of the different sources of regime resilience in these two countries, the book points to areas where challenges persist and are likely to arise in the future. Despite their long records of political dominance, PAP and UMNO are both facing greater political uncertainty than they have in the past.\n\n13\n\nWong Chin-Huat, James Chin, and Norani Othman. ‘Malaysia: Towards a topology of an electoral one-party state’, Democratization 17(5) (2010): 920–49; Netina Tan, ‘Turn of tide: Singapore’s watershed election 2011’, Asia Pacific Memo 17 (2011): Bridget Welsh, ‘Malaysia's elections: a step backward’, Journal of Democracy 24(4) (2013): 136–50; James Chin, ‘The 2015 Singapore general elections (GE): Lee Kuan Yew’s last hurrah?’, The Round Table 105(2) (2016): 113–17.\n\n6\n\nRegime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\nNew and Old Theoretical Approaches The issue of regime resilience has gained salience in political science over recent decades. As democratisation has slowed, scholars have moved to understand how hybrid regimes (those combining democratic and authoritarian features) have persisted rather than democratised. More broadly, scholars have challenged the view that countries across the world are moving toward democracy. With labels ranging from ‘competitive authoritarianism’ to ‘democratic decay’, there has been an avid study of two interrelated areas – how authoritarian regimes persist and how more democratic regimes become more (or less) democratic. With regard to democratisation, these two questions move in opposite directions but, given the focus on this ambiguous ground between authoritarianism and democracy, they both offer insights into the nature of power in these ‘hybrid’ regimes. Malaysia and Singapore fall into this ambiguous rubric. Both countries have consistently ranked in the ‘partly free’ category in Freedom House for decades, reinforcing their ‘hybrid’ character.14 Malaysia has often been classified as ‘semi-democracy,’ with limits on civil liberties and serious obstacles for the opposition to gain national power.15 Since 2013 Malaysia has been seen as moving in a more authoritarian direction, experiencing further democratic decay.16 Singapore is seen as similarly hybrid, although its level of control over society (in part shaped by its small size) and the more unfavourable options for the opposition have often put Singapore more towards the authoritarian pole. It has, however, consistently scored higher than Malaysia in areas of governance and service delivery.17 Since 2015, Singapore has also experienced a more authoritarian trajectory.18 Many Singaporean scholars contend the label of authoritarian for their country,\n\n14\n\nSee https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2017 William Case, ‘Semi-democracy in Malaysia: withstanding the pressures for regime change’, Pacific Affairs 66(2) (1993): 183–205. 16 Human Rights Watch, Deepening the Culture of Fear: The Criminalization of Peaceful Expression in Malaysia, 12 October 2016 https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/12/ deepening-culture-fear/criminalization-peaceful-expression-malaysia 17 For example, see the World Bank Governance Indicators. http://databank. worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=Worldwide-Governance-Indicators 18 Human Rights Watch, Kill the Chickens to Scare the Monkeys, 12 December 2017, https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/12/12/kill-chicken-scare-monkeys/suppressionfree-expression-and-assembly-singapore 15\n\nRethinking Regime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\n7\n\nsuggesting that Singapore has its own brand of democracy that is suited to its own values.19 Malaysia’s incumbent national government similarly justifies its positions on race and dominance appealing to values and (re) interpretations of history.20 The role that national narratives play in shaping the resilience of these regimes is just one of the many means by which PAP and UMNO stay in power explored in this collection. Among scholars the main approach to understand regime resilience in Southeast Asia, and globally, has focused less on narratives than on state power. Scholars argue that governments use the bounty of state resources, control and centralisation of the levers of power, and capacity of leaders, bureaucrats, political parties and their decision-making and performance to stay in power.21 What has distinguished Malaysia and Singapore from other countries in the region such as Indonesia is the comparative greater strength of these states arising from the legacy of colonialism and favourable position of fiscal revenues.22 State resources are tied to distribution of patronage and provision of services. Singapore’s PAP is long held to traditionally derive its public support from its expansion of public housing. In Malaysia, patronage through UMNO and, later, connected to the state-based affirmative action policy known as the New Economic Policy has served the party well, allowing it to address the claims of inadequate attention to its base that emerged in the late 1960s. Authors in this collection identify changes in the nature of patronage in the contemporary period, pointing to the use of cash transfers and targeted disbursements. The most prominent explanations of regime resilience focus on the second dimension, control of the levers of power. Power in both countries is 19\n\nChua Beng-Huat, Communitarian Ideology and Democracy in Singapore (London: Psychology Press, 1997). 20 Norani Othman, Mavis Puthucheary and Clive S.

This centralisation has its roots in the feudal elite orientation of Southeast Asian states, but in Malaysia and Singapore was consolidated during the strongmen eras of Lee Kuan Yew (1965-1990) and Mahathir Mohamad (1981–2003). The checks on executive power have eroded over time, especially with regard to the judiciary. Both countries have a limited number of legal decisions that conflict with the executive. The power of the executive remains a defining feature of how these regimes stay in power, as institutions and individuals are controlled, minimising elite challenges for power. Both Najib Tun Razak and Lee Hsien Loong have used the executive to stay in office, and define their leadership priorities and policies. From the selective use of repression to communication strategies, centralisation serves to both perpetuate and actualise the persistence of power. This has been recognised by scholars in the control of the traditional media, through alliances with government/party-linked companies. E. Terence Gomez’s recent book on control of government-linked companies illustrates how control of the executive in tandem with the Ministry of Finance has strengthened Najib’s hand.23 Scholars have zeroed in on electoral manipulation and integrity as a means for the regimes to distort elections to their advantage, from PAP’s last-minute delineations to the massive gerrymandering, malapportionment, cracking and packing favouring UMNO in Malaysia.24 This is buttressed by the selective use of repression, in occasional arrests, charges and more broadly intimidation, notably of government critics or opposition figures. Malaysia’s leading opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has been jailed (for the second time) since 2015. Authors in this volume look at how that control has shifted in the media environment with the expansion of the Internet and social media. This collection furthers the discussion of control to extend to how the law is currently being used to perpetuate power. The decisive role that the control of the state plays in maintaining control of the state cannot be understated. In Singapore primarily, attention has centred on who comprises government and the executive as a whole. PAP continues to tout that it is\n\n23\n\n24\n\nEdmund Terence Gomez, Ministry of Finance Incorporated (Petaling Jaya: SIRD, 2017).

With criticisms of distant elitism in elections, favouritism in appointments and even corruption within the bureaucracy, the meritocracy claim has come under challenge. This has been especially the case with the appointment of a race-based president in 2017. Nevertheless, the broader point that the capacity of leaders to lead and make decisions accounts for regime resilience remains. From the strongmen of Mahathir and Lee Kuan Yew to their successors, leadership is a common frame used to explain the longevity of these regimes. This collection looks at the role of both current premiers in determining their party’s future, with the prognosis pointing to greater uncertainty rather than continuity. Closely connected to leadership capacity is a focus on the political parties themselves. Studies of PAP and UMNO have repeatedly pointed to issues of renewal, adaptability and institutional strength.25 It is argued that crises and elections serve to transform the parties, further entrenching their dominance. This is particularly the case in analyses of Singapore’s PAP. In a pioneering work on the party, Chan Heng Chee (who later became a government ambassador) argued that PAP was able to recruit new leaders and introduce new forms of engagement with citizens.26 This paradigm is often used to understand Singapore politics, as the way PAP evolves is seen to be decisive. Scholars are less sanguine about the effectiveness of these political parties in the contemporary era, pointing to elitism, weakening institutional ties and mismanaged citizen engagement.27 Voter engagement is seen as crucial to the success of these regimes.28 This collection showcases different views of the capacities of PAP and UMNO. The single most important area of performance of these regimes has been the economy. Following in line with developmental states identified in East Asia broadly, and building on the successful experiences of\n\n25\n\nSee, for example, Diane K.

High growth numbers, service provision and poverty reduction are most frequently mentioned, but explanations extend to the management of economic crises, policies and alliances in the political economy. The old adage ‘it’s the economy, stupid’ has served both parties well. Singapore has joined the higher-income countries, with Malaysia among the middleincome countries with a much greater population. Growth has not come without costs, however, and it has been an uneven process.29 Some of that unevenness has been the product of government policies and practices of exclusion. The attention to inequality stands out among this collection’s authors, with the economy more of a weakness than a strength for these regimes. They are not alone in this dynamic, as global economic conditions have made uncertainty certain. The challenges for both Malaysia and Singapore ironically are in a traditional area of strength. The nexus between ‘strong states’, institutions and their performance has been the dominant approach in understanding regime resilience in Malaysia and Singapore, but it is by far not the only explanatory rubric. Both countries were at the centre of the ‘Asian values’ debate, with governments claiming that the norms and values of these societies supported the centralisation of authority, minimal freedoms and prioritisation of order.30 The debate showed how crude these leaders and their spokespersons were in essentialising and oversimplifying the rich and varied attitudes within Malaysia and Singapore in their Machiavellian responses to criticisms of human rights. Research has since shown that there is greater diversity in attitudes in these societies than was described, and that the Asian values explanation has faded with the end of the strongmen eras.31 This said, there continues to be strong conservative orientations among large shares of these societies, reinforcing the view that values do in fact matter. Essays in this collection address how both PAP and UMNO galvanise these conservative views for support. The role that government plays in educating and socialising\n\n29\n\nSee, for example, Jonathan Rigg, Challenging Southeast Asian Development: The Shadows of Success (London: Routledge, 2015). 30 Bilahari Kausikan, ‘Governance that works’, Journal of Democracy, 8(2) (1997): 24–34. 31 Mark Thompson, ‘Whatever happened to ‘Asian Values’?’, Journal of Democracy 12(3) (2001): 154–65.\n\nRethinking Regime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\n11\n\nsociety through its control of the mainstream media further enhances the effect of values on regime resilience. Education or the lack thereof of politics serves these governments well. Conservatively, it is fair to assume that values are a crucial societal factor accounting for regime resilience. A third and closely connected explanatory rubric focuses on forces from below, the strength of alternatives, especially the political opposition.32 Studies of the opposition in Malaysia and Singapore have repeatedly emphasised weakness.33 This weakness comes from conditions within the opposition itself, such as poor leadership, infighting, ideological differences and an inability to cooperate, to the conditions the opposition faces, such as restrictions on organising and campaigning. There is comparatively less attention paid to the constraints of the regime on the ability of opposition to organise and mobilise. This collection discusses how the opposition has reformulated itself in both Malaysia and Singapore, and its challenges. Analyses ‘from below’ have included assessments of civil society, as well as the more formal opposition political parties.34 This collection brings attention to the changing role of citizenship and citizen mobilisation. As implied above, this collection expands the analysis further. The authors engage regime resilience in different ways, building on their varied expertise. Many of the essays bring in the views and behaviour of ordinary citizens to understanding regime resilience. From perspectives of political literacy to conceptions of citizenship, authors show that regime resilience in Malaysia and Singapore cannot leave out the role of citizens. Another key understudied area has been that of political economy. While there is a rich body of scholarship examining economic policy and how these ‘developmental’ states brought about economic growth and reduced poverty, there are still gaps in the connections between the management of the 32\n\nSee Jason Jesudason, ‘The resilience of one-party dominance in Malaysia and Singapore’, in Hermann Giliomee and Charles Simkins (eds), Awkward Embrace: One-Party Dominance in Industrializing Asia, (London: Routledge, 1999).

The authors in this collection help fill this void by looking at economic policies and their effects on citizens. The process leads to a better understanding of not only why these regimes have stayed in power, but also why challenges to these regimes remain. A third current connects these regimes with the law, or rather how the law is used to dominate and legitimate incumbents as well as shape societal norms. While in these areas the collection breaks new explanatory ground, the themes in the collection also revisit the traditional approaches towards regime resilience in new ways. Authors look at contemporary changes by the incumbent parties, the opposition and engagement by parties with voters. In doing so, they bring traditional analyses up-to-date and provide a valuable lens to understand the increasing complexities of Malaysia and Singapore. We now better understand how race and religion are being used by UMNO, for example, as well as how PAP has adapted its communication strategy. Revisiting traditional approaches allows a deeper understanding of regime resilience in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nThe Path Ahead The collection contains seventeen essays, all written in accessible style, offering different perspectives and covering a range of topics. The book begins with an essay by co-editor Bridget Welsh, who has been researching on Malaysia and Singapore since the early 1990s. She outlines ten fundamental political shifts that are taking place in Malaysia in political parties, the political economy and in society. She concludes that the emerging picture is one of fragmentation where leaders across the political spectrum will need to prioritise ‘Malaysia’s national interest and the needs of the citizens’ and that for now, UMNO remains in the driving seat of power, despite being weakened and weakening. A veteran of Malaysia and Singapore studies, John Funston, compares Malaysia’s 1969 general election – which Funston witnessed first-hand – with GE 2013 with some startling conclusions. It was no surprise that the political parties competing remained the same with the only change being the formal opposition alliance. The support levels for each coalition were also similar, and in both GE, the ruling coalition lost the two-thirds majority. However, despite the ‘success’ of UMNO in GE 2013, Funston’s detailed investigation\n\nRethinking Regime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\n13\n\nshows that popular support for the long-standing ruling regime fell. The findings of this historical comparison have important implications for understanding how resilient UMNO is (or isn’t). In the fourth essay, Clive Kessler, an anthropologist who has been observing Malaysia since the 1960s, examines the legitimation strategies adopted by UMNO surrounding Malaysia’s 2013 general election. He notes that UMNO deliberately undertook a specific campaign strategy that resulted in the BN emerging weaker, but UMNO becoming stronger, as least in terms of seats and control of the political narrative around race and religion. Kessler’s focus on ideas, communication and the transformation of UMNO’s political ideology offers insights into the trajectory for UMNO’s future. In the fifth essay, Gaik Cheng Khoo analyses the discourse taking place on the ground after GE 2013, specifically the recent mobilisations of Bersih 4.0 in 2015. Drawing on her earlier work on citizenship and the discourse around democracy, she argues that the popular discourses of identification are shifting and provide resistance to the regime in Malaysia. The sixth essay turns our gaze to Singapore where Bilveer Singh examines the gaps in expectations between the people and the government in light of both GE 2011 and GE 2015 in this island city state. Singh argues that the widening gap between the perception-expectation from Singaporeans of their government can be traced to PAP governance, and that its ability to narrow the expectation gap is also governance related. This essay ties PAP’s regime resilience to PAP’s contemporary policy engagement with the electorate. The subsequent essay by Lily Zubaidah Rahim takes an alternative view. Lily Zubaidah Rahim details the tight control that PAP continues to exercise over Singapore and Singaporeans, and shortcomings in meeting expectations and engaging in reform. Her essay points to weaknesses rather than strengths in PAP governance. Two authors in the collection examine the media, Terence Lee and Ross Tapsell. Terence Lee analyses PAP’s communication strategy and finds deficits, despite the gains in GE 2015. These challenges in communication for PAP highlight both a strength and weakness of the governing party. Ross Tapsell looks at the social media in Malaysia before and after GE 2013. Tapsell argues that while social media may provide for democratic space in the short-to-medium term, media convergence – the synchronisation of media platforms (such as online, broadcasting, print and video) – into media\n\n14\n\nRegime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\nconglomerates will benefit the incumbent rather than oppositional forces. He also points out that the control of resources and levers of power have enhanced BN’s control over the political narrative. In the tenth essay we follow with Malaysia; Amanda Whiting explores public pronouncements of law reforms in Malaysia by Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak with a focus on the legal rights of a Muslim woman charged with sedition. The outcome has been less than satisfactory, with the woman coming in the cross-hairs of emboldened guardians of Islam and political authorities. This case is used to illustrate the problematic dimensions of Malaysia’s sedition law, and how it is being used to buttress the regime. The four subsequent essays address the economy and its management. Wee Chong Hui, Steven CM Wong and co-editor Greg Lopez writing with Mohamed Ariff discuss different dimensions of Malaysia’s political economy and their implications for regime resilience. Wee analyses the management of petroleum resources through the lens of federal–state relations and public finance, while Steven CM Wong discusses the politics of the ‘Bottom 40’, the poorest Malaysians. Lopez and Ariff highlight the economic reforms of Prime Minister Najib, but argue that these reforms have not achieved as much as promised or projected. All three essays illustrate the challenges in managing public policy and utilising state resources efficiently. At the same time, they show BN’s success and weaknesses in using resources and its incumbency to its advantage. A weakened BN government has had to resort to populist measures to remain popular with the electorate, yet it is not prepared to devolve its highly centralised economic powers to the states or to engage in meaningful reforms that restructure the political economy. UMNO’s central control of resources lies at the heart of regime resilience in Malaysia. Lee Soo Ann, focusing on the economy and social welfare policy in Singapore, provides a detailed treatment of how PAP has ensured economic growth and social welfare despite being a small open economy. His essay contrasts with the others as it highlights the regime’s effective use of resources. He provides the economic logic to how policies such as housing, immigration, wage and increasing productivity have contributed to the economic prosperity of many Singaporeans. He also identifies recent policy initiatives to address the frustration of Singaporeans after GE 2011 and the approaches to managing the current challenging economic environment. All four essays flesh out the important implications of political economy for regime resilience, with different conclusions.\n\nRethinking Regime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\n15\n\nMalaysia continues to remain under focus as we turn to look at dynamics in society. One of Malaysia’s leading intellectuals, political anthropologist A.B. Shamsul, attempts to look beyond psephology to make sense of Malaysian politics. He addresses political literacy and representation. He argues that, with the absence of political literacy, a political system such as parliamentary democracy has not found fertile ground. In turn, representation through acts of ethnic ‘gladiatorism’ has become the preferred form. Shamsul concludes by asking if the political cockfighting (gladiatorism) can really raise the level of political literacy among Malaysian voters. Meredith Weiss examines both political party coalitions in Malaysia. This essay, based on her fieldwork around GE 2013, argues that the election signals a new phase in Malaysian electoral history, in which an alternate coalition presents not just different policies and personalities, but also a new way of conceptualising and engaging in politics. She highlights some of the challenges of maintaining cooperation after GE13. R. Rueban Balasubramaniam takes to legal philosophy to unpack UMNO’s ethnocratic rule in Malaysia. He explains how views of the law and use of the law have contributed to BN’s hold on power. He goes further and, by appealing to the Federal Constitution, provides a framework to dislodge the culture of domination in Malaysian politics, suggesting a way to strengthen resistance to the BN. David Martin Jones concludes the book, comparing the resilience of both these regimes. He highlights the fact that party states such as Malaysia and Singapore present a challenge to Western models of democratisation. Jones is pessimistic that turnover will be possible in both Malaysia and Singapore as their ability to use the levers of power have been successful. In keeping with the diversity in the volume, these essays point to different projections for regime resilience. There is both optimism and pessimism over the future of these regimes, with the authors pointing to varied trajectories and factors contributing to these paths. As with Malaysia and Singapore themselves and studies of their political development, there is little consensus. For scholars following these countries, this should not come as any surprise. What should, however, offer insights is how these essays, as a collective, enrich understanding of what will be the drivers of change, and whether in fact the parties in power will stay in the driving seat. This is the topic we return to in the conclusion.\n\n16\n\nRegime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\nChange without ‘Change’: Malaysia after GE 2013\n\n17\n\nChapter 2\n\nChange without ‘Change’: Malaysia after GE 2013 Bridget Welsh\n\nFour years have passed since the historic May 2013 polls where the incumbent Barisan Nasional (BN or National Front) coalition held onto power. Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak received a maiden mandate, a weak one clouded with legitimacy issues in a seriously flawed electoral process, but one nevertheless that left power in the hands of the party that has governed the country for over 60 years.1 He is Malaysia’s sixth elected premier, who subsequently received the blessing of his party in an uncontested election for the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) presidency in October 2013. He is now Malaysia’s third longest serving leader. On the surface, it would appear that there is more of the same – the status quo remains in which the country is deeply politically polarised and the world’s longest serving political coalition remains in power. Real challenges of governance from addressing corruption and multi-ethnic inclusion to improving economic development and providing quality services remain. A closer look, however, reveals that GE 2013 marked some fundamental shifts in the national political landscape that profoundly shaped political dynamics. On many levels, GE 2013 brought change, although these 1\n\nFor a discussion of the elections see James Chin (ed.), special issue of The Round Table: The Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs, Volume 102/Issue 6, 2013; Andreas Ufen (ed.), special issue of the Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs, Volume 32, Number 2, 2013; Khoo Boo Teik (ed.), 13th General Election in Malaysia: Issues, Outcomes and Implications, IDE-Report.

In this essay I identify ten fundamental political shifts that took place in three different areas – within political coalitions, in governance and within Malaysian society – and point to potential trends and implications for democracy and regime resilience in Malaysia. I tie these changes to GE 2013, although some of these developments were rooted before the election and have been exacerbated since the election. The picture that emerges is one of fragmentation, where greater burdens are being placed on leaders across the political spectrum to prioritise Malaysia’s national interests and the needs of its citizens. Despite Najib’s 2013 electoral victory and UMNO’s resilience in power, conditions for regime change continue to remain promising, although short term these prospects are less optimistic than in the recent past.\n\nReconstituted Political Coalitions I. An UMNO Malay ‘Insecure Victory’ GE 2013 represented the first election where Malaysia’s dominant party UMNO had no real internal non-Malay checks on its political power within the governing coalition. While UMNO has been the de facto dominant party in BN since 1969, and the voices of alternative parties have been overshadowed and in some cases outright dismissed, GE 2013 effectively removed meaningful internal non-Malay dissent from within. Malay parties – UMNO and Sarawak’s Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB or United Bumiputera Heritage Party) – comprise 77 per cent of the share of parliamentary seats of the post-GE 2013 government, while within BN nonMalay parties comprise only 23 per cent. Although UMNO did not increase its share of the popular vote in GE 2013 (now at 29.3 per cent) and studies of electoral results have shown that its vote share of Malay support rose by a modest 1.5 per cent, UMNO holds the lion’s share of seats.2 This is in the context of a minority government, where 51 per cent of the popular vote 2\n\nThis is based on an unpublished Merdeka Center study reported in the media. ‘Did UMNO Really Scare up Strong Malay Support, Not Quite’, The Malaysian Insider, 13 August 2013, accessed 15 March 2016, http://bmalaysia.com/pages/16384060-didumno-really-scare-up-strong-malay-support-not-quite.\n\nChange without ‘Change’: Malaysia after GE 2013\n\n19\n\nwas won by the opposition, and 70.7 per cent of the popular vote was not won by UMNO. This oxymoron dynamic – with carte blanche within BN but a limited base of support within society at large – is a UMNO ‘victory’ laden with ‘insecurity’. Malaysia’s political history teaches us some of the patterns that occur in similar situations. The first dimension is ‘victory’. When there is the perception of an UMNO Malay victory, as occurred in 2004 when premier Abdullah Badawi gave UMNO the largest number of seats in Malaysian history (109 of 219), the effect was to fuel conflict within UMNO and contribute to alienation from other political parties. A ‘victorious’ UMNO expects more, and contenders emerge within the party to demand more. Ultimately, a victorious UMNO is one that fights within itself. Indeed, splits within the party have been evident since immediately after the GE 2013 results, in which Najib had to return home on a 2013 vacation to quell a revolt against his leadership to the open defections from his party in the wake of 2015 revelations of inadequately accounted funds deposited into Najib’s personal account associated with the 1MDB scandal.3 The most striking illustration of dissent within UMNO has been the 2016 purge of leaders –former Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin and former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad – who openly called for Najib to step down. Despite holding onto his position, Najib constantly has to worry about challengers from within. UMNO’s divisions are no longer just among the elite party leaders, but extend to open rebellion by the grassroots.4 A victorious UMNO also pushes its coalition partners around. Post-GE 2013 there is the perception that non-Malay parties are no longer relevant for UMNO power. As such, BN partners no longer hold the veto power they once held in BN’s long-touted ethnic power-sharing arrangement.5 In\n\n3\n\nBased on interviews conducted with UMNO delegates, 2013–16. Open dissent in the party was reported after the 1MDB scandal broke in July 2015, with the eventual dropping of former Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on 28 July 2015. 4 A series of police reports and protests against Prime Minister Najib have occurred. For example, see: ‘Now Johor UMNO member lodges report against Najib over RM2.6 million’, Today Online, 6 September 2015, accessed 15 March 2016, http:// www.todayonline.com/world/asia/now-johor-umno-member-lodges-reportagainst-najib-over-rm26-billion. 5 Arend Lijphart, The Politics of Accommodation: Pluralism and Democracy in the Netherlands (University of California Press, 1968).\n\n20\n\nRegime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\nfact, arguably the influence of the non-Malay parties – Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), Gerakan and Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) – has dropped with these parties no longer fully autonomous in the selection of their party leaders and their ability to advocate for non-Malay issues diminished. An illustrative example is that of the responses around the September 2015 Himpunan Rakyat Bersatu (United Citizens Rally) rally, in which Malay chauvinists funded by the government engaged in anti-Chinese vitriol.6 The concerns of non-Malay parties were publicly dismissed.7 A similar dynamic occurred with the introduction of the RUU355 Bill in April 2017 which has the potential to open the way for the introduction and implementation of Sharia law. The test ahead will be whether Najib can manage these internal UMNO and BN tensions, as these divisions open up the way for the opposition to make gains at the polls and are a critical condition if BN is to lose power, moving Malaysia toward greater democracy. Yet, there is another dimension present in UMNO’s results, the insecurity of a party that has not won over the public at large and has challenges with public confidence. The image of ‘UMNO’ as a party has not significantly improved, and a large section of society remains alienated from Najib himself.8 This is where UMNO will continue to turn to the modus operandi it knows best – the use of Malay identity (aka racial politics) to attempt to galvanise and maintain support.9 The 2015 Himpunan Rakyat Bersatu rally was a clear example of increasing Malay chauvinism, but these practices of targeting Malaysian Chinese have increased in this era of insecurity. Anti-Chinese sentiment has been most virulently used in the attacks at the Democratic Action Party (DAP), which is portrayed as 6\n\nJoseph Sipalan, ‘Condemning ‘red shirts’ rally, MCA calls for end to public protests’, The Malay Mail Online, 24 September 2015, accessed 15 March 2016, http://www. themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/condemning-red-shirts-rally-mca-callsfor-end-to-public-protests#sthash.nI082UvC.dpuf. 7 Syed Jaymal Zahid, ‘You want more?

The use of Malay identity has more overtly included religion, a phenomenon that has long historic roots but played a prominent role in the GE 2013 campaign as messages were sent that a vote for the opposition would undermine the position of Islam. PAS leaders believed this was the factor that most undermined their support, along with collaboration with DAP.10 In the wake of the election, there was an open call for ‘Muslim unity’, which has extended into calls for a ‘Muslim tsunami’ after anti-Chinese sentiment was effective in unseating Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok) in 2017. Najib has expanded the powers and resources of Islamic religious agencies, allowing more bureaucratic activism in promoting a more conservative brand of the faith. The prime minister’s lack of moral standing has encouraged the practice of shoring his religious credentials through his office. At the same time, the implication has been a deepening of conservative Islamisation.11 This has, in turn, created difficulties for the opposition that has attempted to bridge more secular and conservative Islamist views. UMNO’s mythology is deeply rooted in the idea of Malay/Muslim unity and believes that this approach puts pressure on the opposition while simultaneously keeps its base together.12 This combination of ‘victory’ and ‘insecurity’ is dangerous, in that it brings out the arrogance and division within UMNO itself and, at the same time, contributes to a party that is less ethnically tolerant vis-à-vis society and ethnic minorities. As UMNO moves forward the conflict inside the party will exacerbate the tendency to use race and religion in national politics, fostering ethnic conflict and political uncertainty. II. Rise of East Malaysia The BN coalition has changed in another important dimension.

Much has been made of East Malaysia as having greater political power due to the 1963 agreement.13 This has been intertwined with the discussion of malapportionment, as analysts have pointed to the 25 per cent of the seats for these states derived from the 20-point agreement to join the Federation and argued that these states, which together now comprise almost 20 per cent of the nation’s population, have smaller constituencies. The reality is that malapportionment is a national phenomenon, and even occurs within Sabah and Sarawak.14 In fact, many in East Malaysia feel that they lack political power and their inputs have not been adequately valued and views respected.15 These issues influence voting behaviour in these states, where a larger share of votes in GE 2013 was given to non-BN alternatives, up nearly 8 per cent from 2008. In the wake of GE 2013, however, the fundamental shift in the role of East Malaysia in national power has more to do with the share of their victory within BN itself.16 East Malaysia holds the king-maker’s position, with 25 per cent of BN’s share of seats in parliament. The majority of these are held by the long-serving and powerful former Sarawak Chief Minister (now Governor) Taib Mahmud’s party, PBB. The reality of East Malaysian influence can be seen in the 35 per cent of seats they hold in the post-GE 2013 Cabinet. These elites continue to hold the balance of power in their hands, with their loyalties determining who holds national power. This will give BN East Malaysian leaders more autonomy in decision-making, greater access to national funds and place a greater responsibility on these leaders to take on national mantles of leadership, especially in the areas of ethnic relations. It is thus not a surprise that the Sarawak 2016 election saw the state’s then Chief Minister, Adenan Satem, build a successful campaign\n\n13\n\nSee Andrew J.

At the same time, East Malaysian leaders face greater challenges from their own constituents. What is not fully appreciated is that the opposition’s main gains in GE 2013 were largely from East Malaysia, where it picked up five seats in these increasingly competitive states. The opposition as a whole won another seven parliamentary seats in these states, but fragmentation among opposition parties contributed to BN victories. Sabah and Sarawak are now two battleground states. Sarawak state elections traditionally played an important role in signalling the mood of voters in its state polls in 2006 and 2011.18 While the Sarawak 2016 poll was a decisive victory for BN, in which the coalition retained two-thirds and picked up seats from the opposition, largely through gerrymandering and movement of voters, much of the victory can be seen to be a credit to Adenan’s leadership, a factor that is no longer present. Many of the East Malaysian leaders are seen to be too distant from their young populations, elitist and relying heavily on their personal power in their constituencies. Passing the political baton to family members is a feature common throughout Malaysia, but particularly prevalent in East Malaysia, limiting the ability of new elites to emerge and representation to broaden. Governance challenges, especially corruption, are increasingly being discussed in public in East Malaysia – with the perception that wealth is not being adequately distributed. The federal government is often blamed. With greater urbanisation and social media, there has been an expanding political awareness evolving in East Malaysia; voters from these states now understand that they have greater clout to determine electoral outcomes.19 While elites continue to hold power in East Malaysia, and will likely do so in the short term, GE 2013 marked a change in the relationship\n\n17\n\nSulok Tawie, ‘10pc of Sarawakians want referendums on state autonomy, NGO says’, The Malay Mail Online, 5 January 2016, accessed 15 March 2016, http://www. themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/10pc-of-sarawakians-want-referendumson-state-autonomy-ngo-says#sthash.XAeVfETR.dpuf. 18 James Chin, ‘Exporting the BN/UMNO Model: Politics in Sabah and Sarawak’, in Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Malaysia, ed.

This assures that both these states will remain highly contested and politically fluid. While pressures have persisted to bring these East Malaysian states into the national orbit, placing the national brand of politics on Sabah and Sarawak, these have been resisted. East Malaysia’s growing political awareness has reinforced regional identities that are only to become enhanced as both leaders and voters in these states wield their influence and expectations rise. Whether this involves freedom of religion, the potential entry of UMNO into Sarawak, oil and gas royalties or fiscal allocations, East Malaysians will expect greater autonomy over their own affairs and resist federal encroachment. The 2014 Asian Barometer Survey found that 21 per cent of Sabahans and 11 per cent of Sarawakians wanted to separate from Malaysia.20 This will enhance the on-going process of political decentralisation of power, while simultaneously making federal–state relations contentious. Najib has faced a more demanding East Malaysia. By choosing to work primarily through the elites in the state, rather than with citizens as large, Najib risks alienation and growing political dissent in East Malaysia. III. Shifts in Multi-ethnic Representation Along with the changes in regional power, the nature of ethnic representation in Malaysia has undergone a major recalibration. For decades BN has been touted as the multi-ethnic inclusion coalition, an example of power-sharing bringing non-Malay parties under its umbrella. Now all of the Chinese and Indian-based parties within BN have lost their political bases. The erosion of Chinese support has been evolving since 2008, with an estimate of over 70 per cent of Chinese voting against BN in 2013.21 MCA won only seven parliamentary seats, moving away from its position as the second largest party within the BN coalition. While MIC won a greater share of the seats contested, it only held onto four parliamentary seats, despite BN losing over 60 per cent of the Indian vote. The decline of support for MIC began earlier in 2008 with the rise of a Hindu-rights movement and through 20\n\n21\n\nIbid. Lee Kam Hing and Thock Ker Pong, ‘Thirteenth General Elections (GE13): Chinese Votes and Implications’, Kajian Malaysia, 32, Supp. 2 (2014): 25–53.\n\nChange without ‘Change’: Malaysia after GE 2013\n\n25\n\nthe calculated process of fragmentation of the Indian community by using financial inducements and shoring up different leaders.22 The decision to bring representatives of the opposition group HINDRAF into the Cabinet after GE 2013 illustrated the weakening of MIC as the chosen representative for the Indian community within BN itself. The subsequent decision of the HINDRAF-linked minister to leave the BN coalition in February 2014 revealed the weaknesses of even alternative Indian Malaysian voices within the incumbent government.23 As Malaysia moves toward its next polls, to be scheduled before August 2018, the viability of the non-Malay parties to speak for their communities remains severely hampered. The possibility of fielding ethnic minorities as BN-direct candidates is in the offing, potentially further decimating the political influence of non-Malay parties.24 Much of the weakness of the non-Malay BN parties within the coalition is of their own making. Questions persist about the non-Malay parties’ ability to represent non-Malays within the coalition as their leaders have often been openly humiliated and dismissed by UMNO. Whether this is the responsibility of the leaders of the non-Malay parties within BN or UMNO is a matter of debate. The public perception is that non-Malay parties within the coalition have not stood their ground on key issues affecting their respective ethnic communities. To make matters worse, the non-Malay BN parties are internally divided, as illustrated by the fractious post-GE 2013 party leadership contests.25 While infighting is the norm in political parties, the bitter personalised pre- and post-GE 2013 contestation within the traditional component non-Malay BN parties has exacerbated their 22\n\nVijay Devadas, ‘Makkal Sakthi: The Hindraf effect, race and postcolonial democracy in Malaysia’, in Race and Multiculturalism in Malaysia and Singapore, eds.

The test ahead will be whether they can win back respect, beginning with their own members. Immediately after GE 2013 non-Malay parties were inward-looking, tackling battles inside their own parties and with UMNO, without a clear focus on how to win back their support base. They have lost their autonomy over their role in national power, playing second fiddle to a dominant party that increasingly sees these parties as less impactful and their issues as less relevant in controlling national power. A conflicting pattern has emerged, with the non-Malay parties opposing the opposition and, in some cases, opposing UMNO to maintain attempts at credibility.26 Non-Malay parties are thus engaged in political battles on two fronts. They vacillate from adopting the position of issues of the opposition, and at the same time struggle with defending and adopting the positions of the UMNO-led government. MCA has turned to ally itself with the Chinese government, with the hope of strengthening its links and financial resources within Malaysia. This opens them to more vulnerability and internal dissent. Longer term, a tipping point may come over an issue or a set of issues that will force these parties to abandon the BN coalition. There are already factions within these parties calling for more independent positions and BN-separation.27 This dynamic will likely only divide and splinter these non-Malay parties further. Post- GE 2013, the mantle of multi-ethnic representation turned to the opposition. Across the three opposition parties in Pakatan Rakyat (PR), seats were won with greater multi-ethnic support. PR held the largest number of multi-ethnic seats in parliament; of the 21 seats held by PAS, for example, thirteen were won by Chinese support, including the seats of some of the party’s conservative leaders such as Nasrudin Hassan Tantawi of Temerloh and Idris Ahmad of Bukit Gantang. Both of these seats had over 20 per cent of Chinese voters and were won by slim margins.

The opposition’s future depends heavily on maintaining support from all of the different communities through leadership, accommodation and compromise. One of the opposition’s main challenges involves cooperating across ethnic communities. This is a serious internal hurdle on multiple levels. The opposition has traditionally appealed to ethnic-based constituencies. PAS and DAP have attempted to cross the ethnic divides, but remain hampered by deeply entrenched assumptions, suspicions and misunderstandings of the ‘other’ as well as a political base that expects their ‘own’ ethnic demands to be advocated. Both were successful in winning support outside of their own ethnic base in GE 2013, but this did not sit well within their own parties. Not only did PAS view cooperation in Pakatan as ‘zero-sum’ – contributing to losses in their own Malay ground – it saw its relationship with the Chinese-dominant DAP (and the UMNO label that PAS was under Chinese control) as negatively affecting its ability to represent its Malay base. When DAP repeatedly demanded that PAS abandon its traditional demand for religious law, notably hudud, this fuelled distrust, anger, and ultimately the break-up of the opposition in June 2015.28 For DAP, cooperation in Pakatan has been a ‘win-win’ shoring up the party. Ironically, this strength bolstered calls within DAP for its partners to fall in line with their own positions on secular government, feeding a perception of DAP (framed in an ethnic lens as Chinese) arrogance and bullying. While the DAP leadership has pushed for Malay inclusion and greater acceptance of ethnic differences, some in DAP have seen these moves as an abandonment of traditional ‘Chinese’ issues, such as challenging affirmative action, protecting Chinese education and defending minority rights, including religious freedom.29 The response was calls to shore up Chinese support and to break with PAS – a development that also contributed to the end of the Pakatan Rakyat partnership and extends into preparations for GE14.

Part of the reason lies with the racialised post-GE 2013 climate. With an election labelled as a ‘Chinese tsunami’ and active exploitation of both race and religion by UMNO, there has been a rise in racialised discourse. The traditional ethnic frame of politics has overshadowed alternative multiethnic lens. Politicians increasingly speak of the ethnic composition of a particular rally, as in the case of Bersih 4 in August 2015, or the need to reach out to specific communities, especially Malays, rather than adopting broader notions of citizenship and identity. For the opposition, the mode has been one of reaction and defensiveness, as its efforts at building bridges across communities have been placed on the back burner by an effective UMNO offence. Short term, this has contributed to ethnic-tied crises that test the opposition’s institutional resilience and leadership, with mixed results. Longer term, the opposition will face the decision of following the ethnic consensus model set by BN or moving away from ethnic politics, to change from mirroring a political structure set by BN to a more substantive alternative. A dynamic of clearly articulating a political discourse that brings together Malaysians across communities, rather than buying into the divisive racial and religiously polarised politics, remains a serious hurdle for all the political parties. Ethnic politics within political parties continues to define and delineate the parameters of democracy and representation in Malaysia. IV. An Unfocused-Divided Opposition The hurdles for expanding democracy do not stop there. The viability of Malaysia’s opposition has emerged as one of the most pressing issues postGE 2013, as the opposition has splintered, reformulated and remained fragmented and unfocused. Despite winning the majority of votes in 2013, the trajectory for the opposition has been negative, at least in the short term. The reasons for the opposition’s weaknesses are multi-faceted, but can be boiled down to two issues: the effective use of the state of repression and division by the Najib government and defensive silo-posturing of opposition parties and leaders themselves, reflecting ideological and personal differences. Analyses of June 2015 Pakatan Rakyat’s break-up place heavy blame on the opposition itself, notably the decision on hudud by PAS president Hadi\n\nChange without ‘Change’: Malaysia after GE 2013\n\n29\n\nAwang to make an opposition coalition intractable.30 Little attention has been paid to the Najib government’s adept strategies to ‘divide and rule’. The most obvious measure involves the imprisonment of the opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, who was jailed again for sodomy in a highly tainted politically-laden legal process in 2015. Less discussed are the incentives that have been provided to PAS to break away from Pakatan, including enticements to introduce hudud, potential gains in Malay seats which could improve the party’s chances, and financial allocations to opposition leaders and causes. At the same time, the Najib government has systematically arrested younger prominent national leaders, with charges ranging from corruption and sedition to the violation of official secrets and travel bans.31 Not only have these arrests been serious distractions, they have curtailed the ability of the opposition of organise and mobilise and, in some cases, damaged the reputations of opposition leaders. Finally, the Najib government has exacerbated the ideological and personality differences within the opposition, over hudud, Malay rights, the role of rulers and religious rights, through its positions on issues and use of incentives. It knows that these issues place strain on the broader ideological umbrella of the opposition, and that these differences tap into divides among individual politicians. The regime knows that a divided and distracted opposition is essential for its survival. The ‘divide and rule’ strategy would not be so effective if it were not for the inherent differences within the opposition. GE 2013 resulted in significant imbalances in winning seats among opposition political parties. While history has shown that the fortunes of individual opposition parties fluctuate widely in different elections, Pakatan Rakyat was formed with equality for all three political parties based on the principles of mutual respect and consultation. The post-GE 2013 unevenness of representation of different parties in the opposition strained this dynamic. Post-GE 2013,\n\n30\n\nAsrul Hadi Abdul Sani, ‘Break-up of Malaysia’s Opposition Bloc Pakatan Rakyat: What Happened and What Happens Next’, Straits Times, 18 June 2015, accessed 15 March 2016, http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/break-up-of-malaysiasopposition-bloc-pakatan-rakyat-what-happened-and-whats-next. 31 Human Rights Watch Report, Creating a Culture of Fear: The Criminalization of Peaceful Expression in Malaysia, 26 October 2015, accessed 15 March 2016 https:// www.hrw.org/report/2015/10/26/creating-culture-fear/criminalization-peacefulexpression-malaysia.\n\n30\n\nRegime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\nDAP was (and is) seen as too dominant among the opposition parties, including by the new Amanah party comprised of former PAS leaders.32 The position and power of different opposition parties to determine the stance and leadership of other parties has created tensions, from the leadership of Hadi Awang of PAS to the role of Anwar’s wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail. The differences go beyond equality among parties to the leadership of the opposition as a whole, an issue that remains unresolved after the imprisonment of Anwar Ibrahim. The contestation for leadership is not just among the different opposition parties, but within parties as younger leaders are jockeying for position and power. There are those who hold onto Anwar, with others hoping to replace him as leader. Some leaders refuse to work with other leaders, as trust and confidence has eroded. With the entry of Mahathir Mohamad and his party Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia into the opposition in June 2017 and Mahathir’s subsequent appointment as chairman of the new broad opposition coalition Pakatan Harapan, the issues of leadership, trust and credibility remain significant. The response of the opposition parties and many of its leaders has been defensive, to the attacks by the Najib government as well as to each other. The opposition has moved away from expanding its support towards consolidating its base, and opted to operate primarily in silos. The media headlines have often repeatedly featured opposition party attacks on each other rather than UMNO and BN, with the relationship between parties soured. The creation of Pakatan Harapan and resolution of its leadership line-up in July 2017 was supposed to reduce tensions, but these too have exposed divisions within the opposition. They extend not only to questions of leadership and political alliances, but to positions on democratic reform, political Islam and ethnic politics, namely the position of the Malay community. The main unifying core of Pakatan Harapan is opposition to Najib, which is a narrow agenda to engage the electorate. Post-GE 2013, the role of representing the public and effectively engaging their concerns has diminished as the opposition has been inwardly focused, and is finding its footing in new alliances.\n\n32\n\nInterviews with Amanah Party leaders, December 2015.\n\nChange without ‘Change’: Malaysia after GE 2013\n\n31\n\nReshaped Governance V. Weakened Political Institutions Malaysia’s GE 2013 also profoundly changed governance. Foremost, it has further politicised the country’s political institutions, inhibiting their capacity to govern as professional bodies and effective arbitrators of conflict. The most attention has centred on the Electoral Commission, whose reputation was severely dented in the run-up and aftermath of the polls. A large share of Malaysians has little faith in the EC’s ability to carry out the redelineation exercise and administer polls fairly.33 Malaysia’s electoral administration has been openly questioned since the emergence of Bersih (Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections) in 2007 and this contestation has been heightened after GE 2013 as the election brought to light the impact of administrative bias on the outcome.34 The twelve major legal cases challenging the EC have further illustrated its bias towards the regime. GE 2013 also brought other political organisations into the spotlight for professionalism, including the police force and the judiciary. The latter has weakened in the wake of arbitrary dismissal and inconsistent handling of over eighty electoral petitions. The courts have adopted primarily a path of conservative judicial restraint, but their decision-making has set worrying precedents in their dismissal of issues of bribery, mishandling of ballots and due process – all of which have undermined the standing of the judiciary and the practice of the rule of law.35 Under Najib the main political arbiters of the rule of law – the judiciary and the police – have been further compromised.

The judiciary has been perceived to be manipulated for political ends, rather than justice. The legal cases extend beyond politicians. Post-GE 2013, Najib allowed the cases on religious issues that he placed in cold storage during his early years in office before gaining an electoral mandate to move forward, thus placing the courts in the frontline of religious tensions. In particular, controversy revolves around the October 2013 kalimah Allah (use of the word Allah) decision, which involved the right of non-Muslims to practise their faith in their mother language.36 The January 2015 appeal on the case overturned the right of non-Muslims to use the word. Similar cases involving possession of Bibles, child custody and the right to change one’s own faith have also come to the courts, with decisions largely running against an expansion of religious freedom and an erosion of rights in the Federal Constitution. Rather than address this issue directly through compromise and engagement, Najib has left the courts to decide, undermining their credibility across Malaysians. Legislative measures to address problems arising from courts, such as unilateral conversion, have also failed to date. The challenges of Najib’s governance have most publicly played out through the 1MDB scandal. Revelations by the Wall Street Journal in July 2015 revealed that deposits reaching nearly $700 million had been deposited in the prime minister’s personal account. Subsequent reports and investigations extending to over six countries have shown that the funds have been spent on personal purchases, involve multiple jurisdictions and shell companies and embroil the sovereign fund in a series of questionable transactions.37 The amounts involved extend beyond $4 billion. Charges of corruption, embezzlement and mismanagement have emerged, with calls for Najib to resign. The loudest critic is former premier Dr. Mahathir. A wide range of institutions have been caught in the evolving scandal, from Bank Negara (Central Bank), the Attorney General’s office (as the former 36\n\nJaclyn Neo, ‘What’s in a Name?

Funds from 1MDB were reportedly used for GE 2013, part of the large amount of funds that were used to shore up Najib’s electoral position through votebuying and influence peddling.38 Malaysia is now ranked among the most corrupt regimes in the world, with the scandal serving as a catalyst to reveal the poor quality of governance of Najib’s government.39 At the same time, the scandal has showcased how political institutions have been comprised for a leader’s political survival. VI. The Populist ‘Reform’ Najib’s pre-GE 2013 years were marked by attempts to portray himself as an economic reformer, to do the opposite of what has happened after his mandate, to showcase his leadership as sound management. He touted himself as an economic liberaliser, opening up the economy to greater competition, investment and restructuring. His pro-business liberalising policies were in response to repeated criticisms of Malaysia’s entrenched position in the middle income trap, a situation where incomes have not risen to a more developed status. His initiatives included the New Economic Programme (NEP) and Economic Transformation Programme (ETP). Najib’s actual liberalising reforms before GE 2013 were much more modest in scope, involving measures such as a relaxation of investment requirements. Many of the initiatives proposed did not get off the ground and were part and parcel of a carefully marketed packaging of himself as a reformer as opposed to actual reform. Where substantive reforms did occur was in fiscal allocations. His preGE 2013 tenure marked an expansion of populist cash transfer programmes directly tied to winning votes. His use of state resources to shore up political support was unprecedented. Before the election he spent an estimated RM58 billion (then US$20 billion) on politically targeted cash transfers, with the actual campaign spending estimated to exceed $1 billion.40 Cash hand38\n\nTom Wright and Bradley Hope, ‘The 1MDB and the Money Network of Malaysian Politics’, The Wall Street Journal, 28 December 2015, accessed 15 March 2016, http:// www.wsj.com/articles/the-money-network-of-malaysian-politics-1451355113. 39 Ian Bremmer, ‘These 5 Facts Explain the State of Global Corruption’, Time, 17 March 2016. 40 Bridget Welsh, ‘Buying support – Najib’s “commercialisation” of GE13’, Malaysiakini,\n\n34\n\nRegime Resilience in Malaysia and Singapore\n\nouts took the form of BR1M (a needs-based hand-out of RM500–1000 per recipient) and vouchers for schoolbooks and smart phones, among many others – many placed under Najib’s 1Malaysia banner. These initiatives using public funds to be ‘popular’ were seen as vote buying, with the process highly targeted and politicised. Along with government spending, there were other slush funds used to woo voters, including dinners, concerts and additional hand-outs, especially to the UMNO political base.41 The tainted 1MDB funds were part of this spending. GE 2013 became the most expensive campaign in Malaysian history. The impact of Najib’s high spending in GE 2013 is two-fold. The use of populist cash transfers in GE 2013 squarely intertwines budgetary issues with electoral politics, bringing Malaysia into a cycle of public electoral spending and goodies and subsequent fiscal recoveries. The link between the use of state finances and elections has played a role in electoral support for some time, but GE 2013 brought this to a new level, one that has fundamentally shifted how state resources were spent. This cyclical electoral spending will curtail alternative options for development strategies, ordinary governance and simultaneously connect public perceptions of elections with rewards rather than responsibilities. This dynamic will also curtail Malaysia’s leadership, tying it to cash transfer spending. Ironically, Najib himself will be hampered in his ability to diversify spending and change priorities as a result of his GE 2013 spending pattern of reforms. BR1M allocations are now part of the yearly budget. The second dimension involves the raising of additional cash through ventures like 1MDB. Traditionally, political parties relied on domestic funds for campaigning. Through 1MDB, funds were raised globally, outside of Malaysia. Moreover, rather than rely on private sector donations, funds were generated by holding office and forming a government-linked fund, with the incumbent using his office to stay in power and abusing his office to prevent a thorough transparent review of campaign spending and publicly-linked funds. This use of his office for campaign funds takes the use of public funds in elections to new heights. Beyond the negative governance effects of 1MDB, the large fiscal public\n\n41\n\n23 April 2013, accessed 15 March 2016, https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/227713. ‘Malaysia's PM hopes to survive most hotly contested elections’, The Guardian, 1 May 2013, accessed 15 March 2016, http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/ may/01/malaysia-hotly-contested-elections.\n\nChange without ‘Change’: Malaysia after GE 2013\n\n35\n\noutlays of funds to win political support have placed strain on government finances. This is especially the case as Najib has continued BR1M outlays. Post-GE 2013, the Najib government was forced to make cutbacks in spending and increase revenues. The impact of cutbacks has been most evident in the decline in development expenditure, the area where Najib has reduced the most spending in his tenure. Unlike his father, Malaysia’s second premier Tun Abdul Razak Hussein, Najib has not opted to significantly focus on development beyond using hand-outs. The 11th Malaysia Plan announced in April 2015 was striking in its lack of a coherent development programme.42 Cutbacks have also affected service delivery, as government departments have had their budgets repeatedly slashed. The revenue position is perhaps where there are the most changes. To raise funds, in April 2015 the government introduced the Goods and Services Tax of 6 per cent on the public, a measure that has especially hurt the poor. With the sharp drop in oil prices from 2015, revenues have also dropped for the national oil company, Petronas (which provides over 40 per cent of national revenues). While the decline in prices has allowed the Najib government to cut subsidies on petrol, it has undermined the government’s revenue position, especially in light of the record high levels of the Najib administration’s debt. This country’s debt has been compounded by the need to make 1MDB payments. Unlike his predecessors, Najib is no longer in the same position to use pump-priming to stimulate the economy and woo political support. The choices Najib faces in terms of spending are difficult, especially given his promise of yet again further outlays around elections. He will increasingly be forced to turn to funds from outside Malaysia. This is exactly what has happened in 2016–17, as the Chinese government has provided liquidity, including funds to assist with the 1MDB payments. VII. New and Old Political Economy Alliances Najib’s governance also involves some fundamental shifts in alliances in the economy. What distinguishes Malaysia’s political economy is the large role 42 Government\n\nof Malaysia, 11th Malaysia Plan, 2016–2020 (Kuala Lumpur: Government of Malaysia, 2015), accessed 15 March 2016, http://rmk11.epu.gov. my/index.php/en/.

Najib has transformed these areas as well. The first dimension was noted above, in the use of cash transfers. Not only has the use of populist cash transfers affected spending, it has redefined his relationship with citizens along class lines. One of the ironies of Najib’s populist spending is that it is the largest needs-based initiative not based on race, a trend not witnessed after his father’s tenure from 1969 onwards. Najib has consciously appealed to lower-class voters, especially those in rural areas, recognising BN’s decline in support among middle-class and urban voters. While ethnic divisions remain the paramount frame for understanding voting behaviour in Malaysia, GE 2013 also brought to the fore the salience of class divisions in voting patterns.43 Populist cash transfers/vote buying were buttressed by an intensification of BN mainstream media propaganda and advertising, more salient in remote areas of Malaysia and among the less educated. Even within urban constituencies, class dynamics were present, with middle-class support more inclined to the opposition and lower-class support less riskadverse and won over by the effectiveness of the BN campaign. Along with Najib’s pre-election appeal to the lower classes, his administration called in cards during GE 2013 from those who have benefited from state contracts and allocations. While voting patterns do suggest that non-aligned upper-class voters, especially professionals, are less inclined to support the incumbent government, those who get their income from the state remain more loyal. This resulted in BN holding onto the base of political support from the overwhelming majority of civil servants, for example. It also reflected in the unprecedented interventions by statelinked private sector – aka cronies – directly intervening in the GE 2013 campai"
