        "text": "Datuk Seri Mah Siew Keong was born and raised in Teluk Intan on 17 June 1961.Before he spent his tertiary education in the United Kingdom, Datuk Seri Mah studied at Horley Methodist School for his primary and secondary education. He then went on to pursue his Bachelors in Science (Management) at the London School of Economics in1981. His education didn’t stop there as he obtained an MBA from the City Business School London in 1991. On top of that, Datuk Seri Mah also has a degree in Law from the University of East London.\n\nIn 1993, Datuk Seri Mah joined Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia as he was inspired to bring changes as the party continues its struggle for a just, fair and egalitarian Malaysia. Two years later, during the 9th General Election in Perak, he was elected as the Pasir Bedamar assemblyman. Subsequently, during the 10th General Election in 1999, Datuk Seri Mah defeated DAP’s candidate and was the Teluk Intan Member of Parliament (MP) for two terms. In 2003, he was elected as the GERAKAN Youth Chief as well as the chairman of Teluk Intan GERAKAN.\n\nDuring the GE11 in 2004, Datuk Seri Mah was appointed the Deputy International Trade and Industry Minister following his re-election as the Teluk Intan MP. In 2016, after a cabinet reshuffle, he became the Deputy Minister of Agriculture for the agro-based industry. In 2013, Datuk Seri Mah was elected as GERAKAN’s fifth president.\n\nDatuk Seri Mah regain the seat for Teluk Intan in a by-election in 2014.During the cabinet reshuffle, Datuk Seri Mah was appointed as the Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department and subsequently as the Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister. In September 2018, Datuk Seri Mah stated that he will not defend his position and he announced his resignation during the opening of Negeri Sembilan GERAKAN 43rd delegates conference at Wisma Gerakan.\n\nBorn in Penang in 1949, Dr Koh Tsu Koon attended Phor Tay Primary School, Chung Ling High School and Methodist Boys’ School. He graduated from Princeton University in 1970 with a degree in physics and obtained his Ph.D from the University of Chicago in 1977 in economics and sociology of education. Dr Koh taught in Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang from 1975 and was promoted to Deputy Dean of Education in 1978. He was a Fulbright scholar at Stanford University from 1980 to 1981.\n\nDr Koh joined GERAKAN and won the Tanjung parliamentary seat in the 1982 general election (GE). In the following year, he became the first GERAKAN Youth Chief, a post he held till 1990. After his defeat by Lim Kit Siang in the 1986 GE, Koh served as political secretary to the second Chief Minister of Penang, Dr Lim Chong Eu from 1986 to 1990.\n\nAfter Dr Lim was defeated by Lim Kit Siang in his state seat which he held for six (6) terms in the 1990 GE, Dr Koh, who was a first-term state assemblyman from Tanjung Bungah, was selected to be Penang’s third chief minister to lead the Barisan Nasional (BN) state government in Penang. Dr Koh became a vice president of GERAKAN in 1991. In the 1995 GE, Dr Koh defeated Lim Kit Siang who came to fight the Tanjung Bungah seat in a bid to take over Penang. He went on to lead the BN to landslide victories in the next two (2) GEs in 1999 and 2004.\n\nDuring his four-term tenure as CM for 18 years, he built on the foundation laid by Dr Lim to push Penang’s electronics industry towards hi-tech and high value-add, diversify into automation and robotics, medical devices, bio-pharmaceuticals, etc. He also supported and promoted the development of higher education (Penang Medical College, Wawasan Open University, etc), sports (especially squash, badminton and football) and culture, having laid the ground work for George Town’s eventual successful UNESCO World Heritage Listing.\n\nThis period also saw the completion of major infrastructures in Penang, namely the North-South Highway, Butterworth-Kulim Highway, Butterworth Outer Ring Road, the Jelutong and Bayan Lepas Expressway (renamed after Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu), expansion of the airport and container terminal, the Swettenham Pier Cruise Centre, Telok Bahang Reservoir Dam, Bukit Gelugor Power Plant, George Town and Bayan Lepas Sewerage Plants, Penang International Sports Arena (PISA), Batu Kawan Stadium, Balik Pulau Stadium, Caring Society Complex, etc. Also approved and launched were the Penang Bridge widening, Penang Second Bridge, Mengkuang Reservoir Dam expansion, etc.\n\nRiding on the property market boom starting in the early 90s, Dr Koh’s administration initiated and insisted on a new policy to encourage private developers to contribute directly to the provision of affordable housing for the people of Penang, delivering over 100,000 low-cost (LC) and low-medium cost (LMC) units, while the Penang Development Corporation (PDC) and federal agencies such as UDA and PERDA also contributed some 50,000 LC and LMC units. This is evidenced by the changing skyline of Penang with many high-rise buildings.\n\nIn the 2008 General Election, Dr Koh decided not to continue as Chief Minister, but to return to federal politics. He contested the parliamentary seat of Batu Kawan but lost in the midst of an anti-establishment political tsunami that swept Peninsular Malaysia. Overall, the party only won two (2) out of 12 MP seats and four (4) out of 31 state seats.\n\nIn November 2008, after serving as an acting president since 8 April 2007 following the retirement of long-serving party president Dr Lim Keng Yaik, Dr Koh was formally elected as GERAKAN’s fourth president. Hence, Dr Koh and his team took over the party’s helm at its most difficult period. However, they remained undaunted and steadfast, fully determined to revive the party, by launching the 11388 strategy in May 2008. He went around to recruit new members, including four (4) independent state assemblymen (three in Sabah and one in Pahang) to join the party. He actively engaged in issues and even participated in a televised public debate with the new chief minister of Penang, Lim Guan Eng.\n\nDr Koh returned to public office in April 2009, when he was appointed as a Senator in the Dewan Negara and as a minister in the Prime Minister’s Department in Dato’ Sri Najib Tun Razak’s inaugural Cabinet in charge of national unity and performance management. He was put in charge of Najib’s Government Transformation Programme (GTP), which addresses and monitors the performance of the ministries’ national key result areas (NKRAs) through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). GTP provides the basis for the country’s Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) to achieve a high-income economy in a sustainable and inclusive manner. He also handles issues related to inter-ethnic relations and inter-religious harmony, in the spirit of 1Malaysia.\n\nDr Lim was born on 8th April 1939 in Tapah, Perak. He attended St Michael’s Institution of Ipoh for his Primary and Secondary education. Upon his graduation, he headed for Belfast, Northern Ireland to pursue his degree in medicine. He graduated from The Queen’s University with an M.B. B.Ch. B.A.O. in 1964.\n\nUpon his return to Malaya, Dr. Lim set up his clinic in Ipoh under the partnership of Cheah & Lim. In 1968, Dr Lim ventured into politics by joining the MCA. He subsequently contested in the Pekan Baru state seat in Perak in 1969 on an Alliance ticket but lost.\n\nIn 1971, he became the State Liason Chairman of MCA Perak and was made a Senator. However, in 1973, Dr. Lim was expelled from MCA after his ‘Reform MCA agenda’ was rejected by the then MCA president Tan Siew Sin. In the same year, he joined GERAKAN.\n\nHe became the Ulu Kinta GERAKAN division chief the following year and moved up to become the Perak GERAKAN SLC Chairman in 1974. In 1976, he became the party’s, Deputy President. In July 1978, Dr. Lim contested in the General Election in the state seat of Jalong in Perak, which he won narrowly. He was subsequently appointed an Executive Councillor in the Perak State Government.\n\nIn 1980, the medical doctor-turned-politician became the GERAKAN President. For the first three terms as the party head, he faced challenges and successfully defended the position at every party election since then. He contested the Beruas Parliamentary seat in 1986 and won by a handsome margin.\n\nUntil the 12th General Elections, Dr. Lim had represented the people of Beruas in the district of Manjung, Perak for 22 years as their five-term Member of Parliament.\n\nDr Lim first became a minister in the Malaysian Cabinet when he was made ‘Minister with Special Functions dealing with New Villages and Emergency Work’ in 1972. However, he resigned from the post the following year as a result of his expulsion from MCA.\n\nHe made a comeback into the Cabinet subsequently after an absence of 13 years as the Minister of Primary Industries in 1986 and served in that portfolio until 2004, when he was appointed Minister of Energy, Water and Communications until March 2008.\n\nOn 2nd September 2005 at the GERAKAN’s 35th National Delegates Conference, Dr. Lim announced that he will retire as National President on 8th April 2007. Dr Lim did not stand for election in 2008 and retired from his Cabinet post after the 2008 General Election after being active in politics for 40 years.\n\nIn his 27 years of tenure as the President of GERAKAN, Tun Dr. Lim Keng Yaik had managed to lead GERAKAN into becoming a national political party with divisions and branches nationwide. The influence of GERAKAN even made its’ way to Sabah. In terms of the infrastructure of the party, Dr. Lim had managed to push for the construction of a 22 storey party HQ (PGRM Tower 1) in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur in 1996, followed by Tower 2 next to Tower 1 in which the new Tower was completed in 2006. The Menara PGRM Twin Towers are now the symbol of GERAKAN. Apart from the Headquarters building, Dr. Lim had also assisted to build the GERAKAN building in almost every state and even some divisions.\n\nAnother major milestone during the leadership of Tun Dr. Lim Keng Yaik was the founding of Wawasan Open University in 2008. Tun Dr. Lim had managed to obtain the permit from the Ministry of Higher Education to set up and operate the Wawasan Open University after six years of tireless effort. It had been the vision of GERAKAN to set up an open university that catered for working adults who had missed their chance to pursue tertiary education. The main campus of Wawasan Open University in Penang was completed in 2008 whilst the other study centres were also set up in many other states in Malaysia. Tun Dr. Lim assumed the post of Wawasan Open University Council Chairman.\n\nHe was conferred an Honourary Doctor of Law by his alma mater, Queens University Belfast in 1999 and also an Honourary Doctor of Philosophy by the Information & Communications University, South Korea in 2004. Dr Lim was bestowed a Tunship (S.S.M) from DYMM Yang Di-Pertuan Agong on 7th June 2008. Dr Lim who had tirelessly championed the establishment of Wawasan Open University was appointed as WOU’s Second Chancellor on 9th May 2011.\n\nDr. Lim Chong Eu was born in 1919 in Penang. He completed his primary education at Hutchings School, Penang and continued his secondary education at the Penang Free School. In 1937, he obtained the Queens Scholarship and continued his education in the UK. He obtained a degree in medicine and surgery from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland in 1944.\n\nln the March 1958 party election, he challenged Tan Cheng Lock and won the MCA presidency with a majority of 22 votes. During the one-year period when MCA was under Dr. Lim, the party was under tremendous pressure from within and outside. In December 1960, Dr. Lim left MCA and formed the United Democratic Party (UDP) in 1962. Together with academicians, unionists and professionals, Dr. Lim founded GERAKAN in 1968. He also co-founded Barisan Nasional with the second Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak and other leaders in 1974.\n\nFirst given the mandate in 1969, Dr. Lim served for five terms as Chief Minister of Penang from 1969 to 1990 for 21 years. The iconic projects that emerged during Dr. Lim’s administration included the 13.5km Penang Bridge and the 65-storey KOMTAR administrative tower and commercial complex. Dr. Lim is best known for overseeing the emergence of Penang’s Free Trade Zone (FTZ) later renamed Free Industrial Zone (FIZ) which evolved into one of Asia’s most robust electronics hubs. Dr. Lim is fondly remembered as the “Architect of Modern Penang”.\n\nDr. Lim retired from politics after a narrow electoral defeat in the 1990 General Election. Dr. Lim Chong Eu had been declining any title in his 40 years of being active in politics. After retiring from the political arena, Dr. Lim was conferred the highest title of Dato’ Seri Utama (DUPN) by the Governor of Penang. He was also conferred the “Tun” title by Yang Di-Pertuan Agong to acknowledge his contributions to the nation and people of Malaysia. Dr, Lim was conferred the Honorary Doctorate of Law by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) in 1976 and served as its pro-chancellor from 1994 to 1999. ln 2007, Dr. Lim was named founding Chancellor of Wawasan Open University (WOU), a distance-learning peoples’ university in Malaysia set up by the Wawasan Education (WEF), a Foundation set-up through GERAKAN’s efforts.\n\nIn late October 2010, Dr. Lim was admitted to the Penang Hospital after suffering from a stroke. He died on Wednesday, 24th November 2010, at his home in Hillside, Tanjung Bungah. He was the first Penang leader to be honoured with a state funeral by the Federal Government in Malaysia’s history. The 17.84 km Jelutong Expressway and Bayan Lepas Coastal Highway were renamed as the Tun Dr. Lim Chong Eu Expressway on 7th December 2010. The Penang Development Corporation (PDC) building in Bayan Baru, Penang, was also renamed as the Tun Dr. Lim Chong Eu Building on 20th December 2010.\n\nTo commemorate Tun Dr. Lim, GERAKAN & WOU organised “The Life & Legacy of Tun Dr. Lim Chong Eu – A Tribute by Malaysians” on 23rd January 2011. The WOU library was also renamed the “Tun Dr. Lim Chong Eu Digital Libray.\n\nProfessor Syed Hussein Alatas was born in Bogor, Indonesia on 17 September 1928. He was a Malaysian academician, sociologist, founder of social science organisations, and politician.\n\nSyed Hussein was among the several professionals and intellectuals namely, Dr. Lim Chong Eu, Dr. V. David, Dr. Tan Chee Khoon, Dr J.B.A. Peter, Professor Wang Gungwu and Mr V. Veerapan who founded GERAKAN in 1968. In the 1969 general elections, GERAKAN campaigned on a platform of social justice and greater parity for all Malaysians in line with the Federal Constitution of Malaysia. Besides parliament and state seats elsewhere, the party managed to win two-thirds majority of the 24 seats in the Penang Legislative Assembly to form the state government, with Dr. Lim as the new Chief Minister.\n\nSyed Hussein was appointed as a Senator. However, after the May 1969 riots, he and some leaders did not agree with Chong Eu’s move to work closely with the Alliance federal government for the development of Penang. They insisted on maintaining GERAKAN as an opposition party in the federal parliament, especially after democracy was restored in April 1971. Out manoeuvred by Dr. Lim, they left the party to form a new party, except Syed Hussein. Disillusioned by the 1969 riots and the political strifes that followed, Syed Hussein moved back to Singapore to continue his academic career with the National University of Singapore. He only returned to Malaysia more than two decades later.\n\nSyed Hussein’s political views were considered by many to be ahead of their time. He was a fervent proponent of meritocracy and this was solidified by the time he spent in Singapore where he believed meritocracy has contributed to the significant intellectual advancement of the city-state. He was also a stellar voice of moderate Islam. While undertaking postgraduate studies at the University of Amsterdam, Syed Hussein founded and edited the Journal of Progressive Islam (1954 – 1955), fostering his links with intellectuals within the Muslim world, including Mohammad Natsir from Indonesia, Taha Husayn and Osman Amin, both from Egypt.\n\nSyed Hussein’s academic career began at the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka publishing house, where he worked as the head of the research department from 1958 onwards. He began lecturing part-time in philosophy at the University of Malaya in 1960 and served as the Head of the Cultural Division at the university’s department of Malay Studies from 1963 to 1967. He then served as the Head of the Department of Malay Studies at the National University of Singapore from 1967 to 1988.\n\nSyed Hussein was appointed as the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Malaya in 1988, before becoming a professor at the Centre for General Studies in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia in 1995. He was later transferred to the Department of Anthropology and Sociology in 1997, before becoming principal research fellow at the Institute of the Malay World and Civilisation of the same university in 1999. “The Myth of the Lazy Native” is amongst the many books authored by Syed Hussein.\n\nSyed Hussein was conferred DSPN (Darjah Setia Pangkuan Negeri) with the title of Dato’ by the Penang State Government in 1999 in recognition of his academic achievement and political views. He died on 23 January 2007 at the age of 80 and was buried in the Bukit Kiara Muslim cemetery.\n\nOn December 22nd 2012, former National President of GERAKAN, Tun Dr. Lim Keng Yaik deceased at the age of 73 years in his residence in Petaling Jaya. He has endlessly contributed to the country during his time as President for 27 years from 1980 to 2008. Tun Dr. Lim Keng Yaik is known as an outspoken politician in the cabinet and he has never lost the Parliamentary seat in Beruas to DAP since 1986. His demise is a great loss to the party and nation.\n\nThe 13th General Election that took place on May 5th 2013 witnessed a harsh wind blow than ever before. GERAKAN contested in 11 Parliamentary and 31 State seats but only managed to capture one Parliamentary seat in Simpang Renggam (Johor) and 3 State seats which was in Tanjong Papat (Sabah), Elopura (Sabah) and Pemanis (Johor). This is the second time GERAKAN had lost all State seats in Penang.\n\nAfter the General Election, Tan Sri Dr. Koh Tsu Koon resigned as National President and Sdr Teng Cheng Yew stepped down from the Secretary-General and Penang Barisan Nasional Chairman posts. Following the resignation of Dr. Koh, Deputy National President, Sdr Chang Ko Youn was appointed as Acting President till a new committee took over during the party election. On October 26th 2013, Sdr Mah Siew Keong took over as National President.\n\nOn May 31st May 2014, Teluk Intan by-election took place following the demise of the incumbent, Seoh Leong Peng from DAP party on May 1st 2014. This moment opened a platform for GERAKAN to add another seat in the House of Representatives that made Sdr Mah Siew Keong being elected as Member of Parliament for Teluk Intan. This by-election was a very significant win for GERAKAN as it instilled moral boost and strengthened the party machinery across the country with a fresh breath. This election also witnessed the return of GERAKAN representatives in the government system where Sdr Mah Siew Keong who was also the National President being appointed as Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department.\n\nOne of the most important initiatives that was driven by the party was the establishment of Yayasan Penjaja Kecil 1 Malaysia (YPPKM) which was done in collaboration with the party leadership and government to provide micro-credit loans to petty traders. This foundation was allocated a total of RM50 million to help the involved entrepreneurs.\n\nIn the year 2016, GERAKAN was seen to be moving ahead with internal reforms by the leadership of Sdr Mah Siew Keong. At the federal level, a cabinet reshuffle that took place in June 2016 witnessed Sdr President who was a Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department being exchanged to a more senior portfolio as Minister of Plantation Industries and Commodities. This move was important as GERAKAN has always been a party that represented the interests of small and medium-sized commodities and plantation workers. This portfolio is also significant as it was previously held by the Former National President, the late Tun Dr. Lim Keng Yaik from 1986 to 2004 and as the Malay proverb goes, “seperti sirih pulang ke gagang”.\n\nDuring Sdr Mah Siew Keong’s period leading the ministry, he was vocal in representing the discrimination against palm oil and has highlighted this issue in conferences and to international organizations, particularly with the European Union. He has also established a strong trade relationship with China that helped increase the exports of palm oil to China. In addition, the emphasis was given to entrepreneurs to obtain Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification that enabled them to market their products. His efforts in branding the palm oil industry have brought high returns for small-scale entrepreneurs. Apart from his tasks in the ministry, Sdr Mah Siew Keong has also launched a campaign to help local people above 60 years of age who hold a red IC which means permanent residents to obtain MyKad.\n\nOn May 9th 2018, the 14th General Election has given a strong blow to GERAKAN and Barisan Nasional as a whole. GERAKAN was defeated in all 11 Parliamentary and 31 State Assembly seats that was contested. In Penang, GERAKAN failed to win any seat in the past three elections. It is also the first time that Barisan Nasional lost its power and failed in forming the government after 60 years. Malaysians opened a new chapter in the history of the country where Pakatan Harapan led by Tun Dr. Mahathir formed a new government and officially adapted to a ‘two party system’ at the federal level. GERAKAN being a party that upholds the principle of ‘people’s first’ received the message that was conveyed by the people through the ballot box.\n\nSeveral political shifts also affected the Party in a big way. The Sabah People’s Progressive Party (SAPP) left the Barisan Nasional in August 2008. Two top SAPP leaders, Raymond Tan Shu Kiah (former Sabah Deputy Chief Minister, SAPP Vice- President and Tanjong Papat Assemblyman) and Au Kam Wah (Assemblyman for Elopura and SAPP Youth Chief) disagreed with the move, left SAPP and became independent. They chose to join GERAKAN in May 2009, with Raymond appointed a National Vice-President and remained as a Minister of Industrial Development in the Sabah Barisan Nasional Government. While Au Kam Wah appointed a CC member.\n\nIn January 2010, Ho Yip Kap (Independent Tanah Rata Assemblyman who was not accepted back to the MCA) joined GERAKAN and immediately set up the Cameron Highlands Division headed by him.\n\nLiew Yun Fah (former LDP Vice-President and Minister of Youth and Sports 2004 – 2008) also joined the party in June 2010 and was appointed another National Vice-President.\n\nPeter Pang En Yin (former Sabah Deputy Chief Minister, former LDP Vice-President and Assemblyman for Karamunting) decided to join GERAKAN in March 2011 and was appointed CC member. Peter Pang retained his post of Minister of Youth and Sports of Sabah.\n\nThese leaders collectively came with more than 20,000 supporters, friends, and well-wishers. Sabah GERAKAN’s rank and file grew many folds so much so that political commentators termed Sabah as the “new frontier” of Party GERAKAN. Hence, GERAKAN is the only party to have gained four elected representatives with two state ministers, since March 2008, who chose GERAKAN because of our ideology and performance as a Malaysian party.\n\nThe 13th General Election was widely expected to be held in 2011 or 2012 although the present term will only end in the first quarter of 2013. As the Party elections due in 2011 might coincide with the 13th General Election, the Party’s Central Committee at its meeting on 18th December 2010 decided to postpone the due elections. Article 43.1 allows a postponement for a maximum period of 15 months until 31st March 2013. In the meantime, the preparations for the impending big battle went into full swing.\n\nThe Party’s founder, former President and former Chief Minister of Penang Tun Dr. Lim Chong Eu passed away on 24th November 2010 after suffering a stroke at the ripe old age of 91. The Party leaders and members were extremely grieved by the sad occasion and turned up in full force during the State Funeral accorded by theFederal Government in memory of a great Statesman and Malaysian.\n\nOn 23rd January 2011, a ceremony entitled “The Life & Legacy Of The Late Tun Dr. Lim Chong Eu – A Tribute By Malaysians“ was held at the Wawasan Open University jointly by GERAKAN and WOU to pay respect to, cherish the memories of and honour the late Tun Dr. Lim Chong Eu. Leaders, members, and supporters were there to hear the many messages and acknowledged his great contributions to the nation, party, and society.\n\nOn 9th May 2011, the Wawasan Education Foundation decided to appoint Tun Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, former President and former Minister who had been instrumental in setting up WOU to succeed Tun Dr. Lim Chong Eu as the WOU Chancellor. A befitting ceremony to install him formally is scheduled on 29th October 2011 at the Dewan Wawasan, Menara PGRM. This is yet another milestone in the Party’s history.\n\nThe 12th General Elections held on 8th March 2008 saw a very strong anti-establishment wind which resulted in Barisan Nasional losing its two-thirds majority in Parliament after the opposition captured 82 out of the 222 Parliamentary Seats. The “political tsunami” as described by many political commentators swept the rural areas of Kelantan and Kedah, as well as the urban areas of Penang, the Kinta Valley, and the KL-Klang Valleys and suburban vicinities. Barisan Nasional also lost control of four states — Kedah, Penang, Perak, and Selangor, in addition to Kelantan.\n\nThe party suffered almost total annihilation. Out of the 12 Parliamentary and 31 State Seats allocated to the Party by the Barisan Nasional, the Party was totally wiped out in Penang and only managed to retain 2 Parliamentary Seats, Gerik (Perak) and Simpang Renggam (Johor) and 4 State Seats, Derga (Kedah), Ketari (Pahang), Bukit Batu (Johor) and Pemanis (Johor). When the cabinet appointments were announced, only Tan Lian Hoe (Gerik) and Senator A. Kohilan were appointed as Deputy Ministers. It was the darkest era in GERAKAN’s entire history.\n\nNeedless to say, while the majority of the members understood the situation, realized the great challenge ahead and have remained steadfast with the party, there were those who could not accept this new reality, resulting in some leaving the party or moving to the other side, and others retreating into a state of doldrums. Therefore, there was a dire need to revitalize, to reactivate and to motivate.\n\nThe Party leadership quickly identified 1 vision, 1 mission, 3 thrusts, 8 strategies, and 8 areas of concern (11388) to help it regain lost ground. It went on a nationwide “meet the grass-roots” session to show solidarity with the members on the ground as well as to get more feedback for the recovery process.\n\nThe Party leadership also decided to press ahead with party elections at the Branch, Division, State, and National levels, under the amended Party Constitution, from June 2008 onwards. It culminated in the National Delegates’ Conference 2008 in November with Dr. Koh Tsu Koon being returned unopposed as President and Chang Ko Youn elected as the Deputy President. Teng Chang Yeow was appointed the Secretary-General.\n\nSubsequently, there was a change in the top leadership of the Barisan Nasional and the Federal Government with Dato’ Sri Najib Tun Razak appointed as the new Prime Minister on 3rd April 2009 and Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as the Deputy Prime Minister on 9th April 2009.\n\nOn 8th April 2009, Party President Dr. Koh Tsu Koon was appointed as Senator by the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong and sworn in on the next day as a Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department in charge of the important portfolios of National Unity and Performance Management, to spearhead the new mission of the new Prime Minister in promoting the 1Malaysia Spirit with a commitment to “People First” and “Performance Now.\n\nOn assuming his ministership, Dr. Koh was totally focused and absorbed in improving the Government delivery system by setting Key Performance Indices, establishing a new unit known as PEMANDU (PErformance MANagement and Delivery Unit) headed by another newly appointed Minister (Dato’ Seri Idris Jala) as the C.E.O. to drive it and work on the numerous Government Transformation Programmes. All these initiatives were meant to drive home the message that the Barisan Nasional Government under Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Najib was serious about changing the nation’s political landscape into one which is more Malaysian, more inclusive, more delivery-oriented and more people-centric. In doing so, the objectives of Wawasan 2020 are more realizable.\n\nFacilitated by the Barisan Nasional government policies, Malaysia’s economy started showing clear signs of recovery. In the first quarter, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaged 11.7%, the second quarterly double-digit increase since the 1997 financial crisis. While playing its role to support a full recovery, GERAKAN continued to champion the cause of non-racial politics in the spirit of Vision 2020.\n\nThe party launched its “GERAKAN IT 2000” project to connect the party with the younger generation of Malaysians it intends to serve. On 13th August 2000, Gerakan Youth launched its “Anak Malaysia” program to develop a generation of united, progressive, dynamic, self-confident, and innovative young Malaysians. In September of the same year, GERAKAN held its “New Millennium NDC” in Penang, the first National Delegates Conference outside Kuala Lumpur in 15 years. By bringing its premier event to Penang, the Party returned to its roots and encouraged the people to assess its service to the state and nation since 1968.\n\nDuring the period between 2000 to 2004, the Party had to ensure that Penang continues to deliver despite political manoeuvrings by the MCA. In 2003, merger talks were initiated with the MCA, and both parties set up a high-level committee co-chaired by the respective heads to pursue the matter.\n\nThe Party achieved a significant milestone in 2003 when it documented “GERAKAN: Reinventing for the 21st Century”. This document charts the party’s plan for the 21st Century GERAKAN – the party of the future. The party aimed to project itself as a learning and intelligent party. As a result, the party established Wawasan Open University (which will provide opportunities for tertiary education for all Malaysians, especially working individuals), Sedar Institute (public policy and socio-economic research centre which provides input for political discourse on issues confronting the nation) and Satu Academy (a training centre for new members and also for re-training existing members).\n\nGERAKAN received the approval permit from the Ministry of Higher Education in September 2006 to establish the Wawasan Open University. Its new 12 stories main campus block behind the stately Yeap Chor Ee mansion in Penang was officially opened by the then Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi on 19th January 2008.\n\nDr. Lim Keng Yaik launched GERAKAN’s “twin tower”, Menara PGRM 2, adjacent to the existing party headquarters in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur on 25th May 2003. The second tower was completed in 2006.\n\nIn November 2003, Dato’ Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi took over the Premiership from Dato’ Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. Dato’ Seri Abdullah led Barisan Nasional to an astounding victory in the 2004 General Election. GERAKAN won 30 out of 31 state seats and 10 out of 12 parliamentary seats contested under the Barisan Nasional ticket.\n\nIn Penang, GERAKAN won all the 13 state seats it contested, as well as 3 parliamentary seats. In the new Cabinet, Dr. Lim Keng Yaik was put in charge of the bigger Ministry of Energy, Water and Communications. GERAKAN was given two additional government posts: a Deputy Minister and a Parliamentary Secretary post.\n\nPositionLeadersMinister of Energy, Water, and CommunicationDr. Lim Keng YaikDeputy Minister in the Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-based IndustriesKerk Choo TingDeputy Minister in the Ministry of Internal SecurityChia Kwang ChyeDeputy Minister in the Ministry of International Trade and IndustryMah Siew KeongParliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Plantation Industries and CommoditiesNg Lip YongParliamentary Secretary in the Health MinistryLee Kah Choon\n\nIn addition to the Chief Minister of Penang (Dr. Koh Tsu Koon), GERAKAN has 3 State Executive Councillors in Penang (Dr. Toh Kin Woon, Dr. Teng Hock Nan and Teng Chang Yeow), and 1 each in Kedah (Fong Chok Gin), Negeri Sembilan (Woo Siak Chee), Perak (Chang Ko Youn) and Selangor (Dr. Lim Thuang Seng). GERAKAN also has 3 Senators serving in the Dewan Negara (Dr. S. Vijayaratnam, Dr. Chin Fook Weng and Rhina Bhar.)\n\nIn 2005, Dr. Lim Keng Yaik announced that he would retire at the end of his presidential term in 2008. During the lead-up to the party’s 34th National Delegates Conference which was held on August 26 – 27, Dr. Lim urged party members to elect a new generation of leaders. He emphasized that leadership renewal is inevitable, and it involves the willingness “to pass the torch to the next generation.” Delegates at the 2005 party National Delegates’ Conference responded to the president’s call and picked a new Central Committee line-up. This milestone election saw high delegates turn up of 88.6 per cent, with 1,617 delegates out of 1,843 in attendance. Although Dr. Lim was challenged by his then-deputy, Kerk Choo Ting, the former successfully retained his position. Dr. Koh Tsu Koon won the deputy president’s post uncontested. The 3 vice presidents elected in 2005 were Dr. Teng Hock Nan, incumbent Dr. S Vijayaratnam, and Chang Ko Youn.\n\nAnother major milestone in the history of the Party was the approval of a permit by the Ministry of Higher Education to set up and operate the Wawasan Open University (WOU), to provide distance learning opportunities based on open admission to those who missed out in obtaining tertiary qualifications in their younger days. This was the culmination of six years of efforts led by Dr. Lim Keng Yaik who assumed the post as WOU’s Council Chairman.\n\nOn 22nd September 2006 at a ceremony held at the Party Headquarters, the Minister, Dato’ Seri Mustapha Mohamad, formally presented the approved permit to the Party. With that, GERAKAN became the first party to obtain a permit to set up an open university. The WOU main campus and headquarters in Penang was officially launched by Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi on 19th January 2008. On 29th November 2008, Tun Dr. Lim Chong Eu was officially installed as WOU’s first Chancellor in its main campus, witnessed by WOU’s Council Chairman Tun Dr. Lim Keng Yaik and the GERAKAN’s National leadership led by President Dr. Koh Tsu Koon.\n\nIn terms of the infrastructure of the Party, the building of GERAKAN Tower 2 was a major event. The completed building was officially opened by Party President Dr. Lim Keng Yaik on the morning of 7th April 2007 at a special ceremony attended by GERAKAN leaders and members. Menara PGRM 2 houses service suites, corporate and professional offices, food, and entertainment outlets.\n\nAfter having led the party for over 26 years, Dr. Lim Keng Yaik who was adamant in handing over the baton of the Party to a younger leader continued to plan for a very smooth leadership transition. The Party’s 2006 National Delegates’ Conference held on 2nd and 3rd September approved the provision for an Acting President as well as Acting Chairman at the state, division, and branch levels, by amending Article 45.2 of the Party constitution. Before this amendment, the posts of President or Chairman had to be filled within 30 days of a vacancy occurring without any provision for an acting capacity.\n\nOn 7th April 2007, the Party’s National Delegates assembled in the Dewan Wawasan for a dialogue. On the next day, which was also Dr. Lim’s 68th birthday, an Extra-Ordinary Delegates’ Conference (eNDC) of the Party was held during which Dr. Lim Keng Yaik resigned as Party President and Dr. Koh Tsu Koon, the Deputy President took over as Acting President. Having served as President since being first elected in Port Dickson in 1980, Dr. Lim Keng Yaik in his farewell speech said the hand-over “marks a smooth transition of leadership to a new generation of leaders. I am confident and firmly believe that this transition should ignite a new fervour and energy to bring GERAKAN further to the forefront in the next decade. I assure you that a good Gerakanist does not just fade away. Instead, we will be around for as long as we are still needed to continue to play our part as Gerakanist in our struggle to build a Malaysian nation which is fair and just for all”.\n\nIndeed, it was one of the smoothest party leadership transitions ever seen in the country. In recognizing Dr. Lim Keng Yaik’s immense and selfless contributions to the Party, the eNDC appointed him as the National Adviser of the Party with immediate effect.\n\nUnder the capable and dynamic leadership of Party President Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, the party achieved another milestone when our new 22-story party headquarters (Menara PGRM) at Cheras, Kuala Lumpur was officially opened by Party President on 25th May 1996.\n\nOn 1st March 1998, GERAKAN commemorated its 30th anniversary with a simple slogan: “One Heart, One Nation, One Vision!” (Satu Hati, Satu Negara, Satu Wawasan!) which called on all Malaysians to work together to get the nation back on track towards Vision 2020.\n\nOn 8th January 1999, Dato’ Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was appointed the new Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, replacing Anwar Ibrahim, who was sacked. In Penang, Dr. Koh Tsu Koon overcame the challenge by Dr. Goh Cheng Teik and retained his position as Penang GERAKAN State Liaison Committee Chairman in the Penang State Delegates’ Conference on 8th May 1999.\n\n1999 saw the staging of Malaysia’s last General Election in the 20th Century on 28th November. This time Barisan Nasional faced an “Alternative Front” (“Barisan Alternatif” formed by PAS, DAP and Keadilan, a new party headed by former deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim’s wife) under conditions which many“experts” proclaimed to be “unfavourable”.Nevertheless, Barisan Nasional showed its mettle by retaining a two-thirds majority in parliament, securing even more parliamentary seats than in 1995.\n\nIn Penang, GERAKAN led its’ way with 10 of its candidates winning state seats. The party also secured 12 state seats in other states and seven parliamentary seats. The victories of Chia Kwang Chye and Lee Kah Choon over DAP strongmen Lim Kit Siang and Karpal Singh in parliamentary contests in Penang were particularly significant, as was Dr. Teng Hock Nan’s triumph over Lim Kit Siang in the fight for the Kebun Bunga state seat.\n\nNotwithstanding these achievements, GERAKAN’s glory was marred by the dramatic resignations of Lim Boo Chang and Lim Chien Aun three days after they had won Penang state seats on the party’s tickets. The “two Lims” saga took a new twist when they were welcomed in by MCA before the Penang State Government could be formed. Nevertheless, with the support of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the party and the people, Dr. Koh was reappointed as Penang Chief Minister for the third term.\n\nMeanwhile, Party President Dr. Lim Keng Yaik has reappointed the Minister of Primary Industries for the fourth term, while Deputy President Kerk Choo Ting was reappointed as the Deputy Minister of International Trade and Industry. Vice President Dr. Tan Kee Kwong was appointed as Deputy Minister of Land and Cooperative Development while Secretary-General Chia Kwang Chye was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Energy, Communications and Multimedia.\n\nIn Penang, Kee Phaik Cheen, Dr. Toh Kin Woon, and Dr. Teng Hock Nan were appointed as State Executive Councillors. Other GERAKAN leaders who were appointed as Exco members in other states were Chang Ko Youn (Perak), Fong Chok Jin (Kedah), Lum Weng Keong (Selangor), and Woo Siak Chee (Negeri Sembilan).\n\nIn the 1990 and 1993 Party elections, the party underwent relatively calm annual Delegates Conferences. There were no contests for the top seven posts of National President, Deputy President, three Vice Presidents, Secretary-General, and Treasurer-General.\n\nHowever, the tame Party elections in 1990 did not reflect the turbulent General Election faced by GERAKAN and other component parties of Barisan Nasional on 21st October 1990. Faced by the combined force of Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah (APU) and Gagasan Rakyat presenting their strategy of a two-party system, some Barisan Nasional component parties like GERAKAN and MCA suffered defeats in the hands of DAP. At the Parliamentary level, the party won 5 out of the 9 seats contested while at the state level, the party only managed to win 11 out of the 23 seats contested.\n\nIn Penang, the party only managed to win 7 out of the 11 seats contested. The shock defeat was at Padang Kota, where the Chief Minister of Penang, Dr. Lim Chong Eu was defeated by Lim Kit Siang of DAP. However, our party still managed to secure the post of Chief Minister, and Dr. Koh Tsu Koon was appointed the new Chief Minister of Penang.\n\nAfter the setback in 1990, the party embarked on a program to win back the support of the people while grooming young leaders to shoulder more responsibilities. This was assisted by the political stability, unity, and economic growth that prevailed during the post-1990 period. As a result of the people’s consultations through The National Economic Consultative Council in which the party participated actively, the Prime Minister, Dato’ Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed launched the Vision 2020 on 28th February 1991.\n\nVision 2020, which aims to develop Malaysia into an advanced industrial nation by the year 2020 was well accepted by all Malaysians. At the same time, the New Economic Policy was replaced by a National Development Policy which aims to bring greater equality to all Malaysians regardless of race or religion. For the first time, the concept of Bangsa Malaysia was promulgated. At the same time, the policies on education, economy, culture, and language were further liberalized. The liberal and far-sighted policies of the Barisan Nasional government prepared the groundwork for the General Election in 1995.\n\nBoosted by the success of the Malaysian economy where a growth rate of more than 8 percent was sustained for 7 years, the Barisan Nasional government won a landslide victory on 25th April 1995. The Barisan Nasional won 162 out of the total of 192 parliamentary seats. Our party secured victories in 7 out of the 10 seats at the parliamentary elections. At the state level, our party achieved an even more impressive victory. Of all the 27 state seats allocated to GERAKAN in the 1995 General Election, the party won 23 seats.\n\nIn Penang, the party won 10 out of the 11 state seats contested. Party Vice President Dr. Koh Tsu Koon was reappointed as the Chief Minister of Penang. At the end of 1995, the party also underwent a reorganization exercise. The party was further expanded to cater for the growth in membership. Instead of having only one branch for each state constituency, the constitution was amended to allow a maximum of 12 branches per division. Thus the number of branches was increased from 300 to 1,084 in 1996.\n\nThe party’s non-communal stand was reflected in its horizontal and vertical concepts of expansion towards political influence and political power in the 1970s. In addition to being the main component in the Barisan Nasional Government in Penang, the party was wielding more influence at the national level by 1980. It enjoyed the confidence of the public and the Barisan Nasional coalition as well.\n\nTo allow for the continued growth of the party and its members, Dr. Lim Chong Eu decided to make way for the many young and capable leaders in the party. His announcement of not accepting the nomination for the post of National President also precipitated healthy campaigning by interested contenders.\n\nThe 9th National Delegates Conference was held in Port Dickson on 17th August 1980. In the election, Dr. Lim Keng Yaik was elected the new Party President for a term of four years, and Paul Leong Khee Seong, after being elected as the Deputy President without contest, pledged his support and cooperation with the same party office bearers which included Ong Boon Seong as another Deputy President, The Ewe Lim as the Secretary-General and Dr. Goh Cheng Teik as the Deputy Secretary-General. Another revision to the Party Constitution was also approved by the Conference to promote a cordial relationship between the members and party organizations of various levels. Unity was maintained and democracy upheld. The ‘Port Dickson Spirit’ was thus born.\n\nThe new party leadership set about to strengthen and expand party membership whilst at the same time attract committed intellectuals into the party. It was decided that the Party President would continue to serve the people in his capacity as an Exco Member in the Perak State Government, and his deputy would again be the party representative in the Federal Cabinet as the Minister of Primary Industries. Such an arrangement worked well as a strategy to enhance the party’s political influence. It enabled Dr. Lim Keng Yaik to concentrate on party work and voice our views on national issues without fear or favour. It also enhanced our credibility in the Barisan Nasional Government through Paul Leong Khee Seong’s many contributions to the country’s economic stability.\n\nAs a conscientious effort to further expand the party, an open-door policy was adopted by the liberal and democratic new leadership. This had led to three groups of people joining the party between the years 1981-1985. The first was led by Michael Chen Wing Sum and ex MCA members. This resulted in an upsurge of new members and the formation of many new branches and divisions in Perlis, Kedah, Johore, the Federal Territory and the East Coast states of Kelantan, Pahang and Terengganu in 1981 and 1982.\n\nOf much significance was the second group of Chinese educationists who had been closely associated with the United Chinese School Committees’ Association and the United Chinese School Teachers’ Association, popularly known in its Chinese acronym as the ‘Dong Jiao Zong’ group. It included Kerk Choo Ting, Dr. Koh Tsu Koon, Ong Tin Kim, Dr. Kang Chin Seng and others. On joining the party on 31st March 1982, the group categorically stated its stand on language, education and culture to create an integrated Malaysia. It assumed the formation of a joint statement with the Central Committee which promised to co-opt it as part and parcel of the party’s political aims.\n\nTogether with the ‘Dong Jiao Zong’ group came along a group of young, concerned and committed intellectuals who would soon emerge as the ‘think tank’ of the party with regards to its stand on national social, economic and political issues.\n\nThe third group comprised well-known trade unionists headed by former CUEPACS President, T. Najendran. It helped to strengthen our relationship with the Malaysian working class.\n\nAnother milestone was achieved when the Central Committee appointed the National Organising Committee to organise the party’s youth and women wings as a training ground for future leaders. Wanita GERAKAN was launched in November 1982 whilst Pemuda GERAKAN in January 1983. A series of activities involving political and leadership training was held at both national and regional levels. The activities of the two movements had expanded the party’s organizational base.\n\nMeanwhile, with the completion of the Penang Bridge on 14th September 1985, the Pearl of the Orient entered into a new phase of social and economic development under the Gerakan led State Government. By then, Penang was not only a state with one of the highest per capita GDP in the country but also a centre of rich and diverse Malaysian culture. Party GERAKAN’s ideological commitment and technocratic strength are well demonstrated in Penang.\n\nWith these records and achievements, the party went to the polls in 1982 and 1986. Our honest, sincere, capable and responsible leadership won the public’s trust and support in the country’s 6th General Election in 1982. Though given a reduced number of seats in the Penang State Election, we secured a 100% victory by capturing all the 8 seats. We also had breakthrough victories in Kedah, Perak, Selangor, Pahang and Johore bringing the total seats won in these states to 7. In the Parliamentary Election, a 100% winning record was attained in Perak where GERAKAN won all the three seats allocated, and in Penang, we captured two out of the three given, including one by Dr. Koh Tsu Koon in Tanjung, an opposition stronghold. This was the best performance of the party after becoming a component party in the Barisan Nasional. It clearly demonstrated our good standing with the people.\n\nThe 7th General Election was held in August 1986 against the backdrop of corporate scandals, administrative deviations, cultural intolerance and economic recession, as well as widespread anti-establishment sentiment in the urban areas. The party lost 4 out of 9 parliamentary seats allocated nationwide. At the state level, although we managed to win 9 out of 11 seats in Penang, we suffered great losses in other states, securing only 4 out of 11 seats contested.\n\nThe party feels that seat allocation and electoral performance should not be the sole yardstick in measuring the success or failure of its political struggle. However, some aspiring candidates do. The party election, held on 29th September 1984 in Kuala Lumpur, witnessed the first intensely contested match. The incumbents were put through an acid test before emerging as the final winners in the race. Dr. Lim Keng Yaik and Paul Leong Khee Seong were both re-elected as Party President and Deputy President respectively, with Kerk Choo Ting as the new Secretary-General.\n\nWith a record of 95 new branches and 28 new divisions established in 1985, the party could then advance with greater confidence to combat some disturbing symptoms that afflicted the party and the society at large. However, such an effort was temporarily thwarted with another major contest for party posts in June 1987. Fortunately, with greater political maturity and a better understanding of democratic principles, the 16th Annual Delegates’ Conference proceeded peacefully, and the leadership at that time was given another mandate to lead the party for another three years.\n\nAfter the internal schism had finally come to an end, the party was left with only about 15 active branches in the country with its headquarters in Penang. Party stalwarts under Dr. Lim Chong Eu soon began a strenuous exercise to put the wrecked organization back into shape and at the same time energize the rank and file to face greater challenges in the future. They also preserved the formidable task of setting up new branches and divisions. When the reorganization was completed, a new constitution was unanimously adopted at an Extraordinary Delegates Conference held on 14th January 1973. It was subsequently approved by the Registrar of Societies on 15th June of the same year, heralding the beginning of a reborn GERAKAN.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Delegates Conference had been postponed to March 1974 awaiting the announcement of an important development at the party. On 19th December 1973, it was announced by the Acting Chairman, Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, Paul Leong Khee Seong, Alex Lee Yu Lung, Dr. Tan Teong Hong, Soong Siew Hoong and thousands of former M.C.A. reformists had joined the party. As a result, during the years 1974 and 1975, a total of 71 new branches and 39 new divisions were established in the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, mainly Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Selangor, and were assimilated into the party structure. As a party fully committed to a Malaysian political philosophy, this orderly and disciplined expansion was certainly an invaluable asset to its struggle to create a just and prosperous society. Before long, many of these young and dynamic political activists were elected to important positions in the new Central Committee.\n\nAs the 4th General Election drew nearer, coalition politics in Malaysia became institutionalized to reduce undesirable communal politicking. On 1st June 1974, the Barisan Nasional was formally registered to gear up for the forthcoming elections. On nomination day, a total of 8 party members were fielded on the Barisan ticket to contest for parliamentary seats and 18 others for the State Assemblies in Penang, Perak, Selangor, and Kedah. The party campaigned on solidarity, equality, and justice.\n\nIn Penang, it focused its electioneering strategy on the state’s development performance and inter-ethnic co-operation. Despite the heavy attack launched by the Opposition, the party continued to be supported by the electorate and won 11 out of the 13 Penang state seats it contested. In the Parliamentary Election, it won all the 3 Penang seats allocated by the Barisan. Elsewhere, the returns were equally encouraging. It won 1 each in Perak, and Kedah State Elections, and 2 parliamentary seats in Perak.\n\nWith the new mandate, party members worked more closely with the mass to unite the people of the country irrespective of their ethnic origin, to share a common Malaysian destiny. 12 branches and 1 division were added after 1975. By 9th October 1976 when the National Delegates Conference was held at the Dewan Sri Pinang, Penang, more than 150 branches had been set up and registered in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nIn the period leading to the 1978 General Election the internal cohesion of the newly expanded Barisan Nasional was first jolted; first, by the political developments in UMNO after Tun Razak’s untimely death in 1976, and then by the expulsion of PAS from the Barisan Nasional in March 1978. Relations between our party and MCA had also deteriorated due to seat allocations in Penang. When Elections were announced, the party had not only to counter opposition allegations on the NEP, the Merdeka University, and inefficiency of the general administration but also to face a treacherous ‘Gang of Seven’ put up by the MCA in Penang to stand against our party’s candidates. The results made known on the night of 8th July 1978 showed that the party had lost 3 of the 11 state seats, and 2 of the 3 parliamentary seats assigned to it in Penang. Nonetheless, Penang survived as GERAKAN’s bastion and Dr. Lim Chong Eu was appointed as the Chief Minister for the third term.\n\nIn the ensuing years, while envisaging and practising political co-operation in the spirit of Barisan Nasional and the Rukunegara, the party, however, ceaselessly urged the national leadership of the Barisan Nasional to grant more representation to GERAKAN members in the District and Town Councils, in the JKKKs and in other statutory organizations throughout the country. Such measures were considered necessary to train emerging party activists to endear themselves to the public through selfless service, and also as a means to spread the party’s message of creating an integrated society. The new Central Committee elected in May 1978 had weathered the storm of the General Election. It had now another arduous task of bargaining for wider representation of the Generasi Rakyat Malaysia Baru at all levels.\n\nParti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia was formed on 24th March 1968. The six founders of the party were Professor Syed Hussein Alatas of the University of Singapore; Dr. David Tan Chee Khoon, Member of Parliament for Batu, Selangor and former leader of the Labour Party; Dr. J.B.A. Peter, President of the Malaysian Medical Association; Dr. Lim Chong Eu, Member of Parliament for Tanjong, Penang and former President of the United Democratic Party; Professor Wang Gungwu of the University of Malaya, and Mr. V. Veerapan, a legal practitioner and former leader of the Labour Party.\n\nInitially, the party drew its main support from members of the dissolved United Democratic Party and the English educated moderates of the Labour Party. Together they constituted an invaluable power base for further expansion. The party also established a close rapport with trade unionists whose cosmopolitan postures were considered essential in the crystallization of a truly multi-ethnic political party. As a result, Yeoh Teck Chye, President of the Malaysian Trade Union Congress and V. David, Secretary-General of the General Transport Workers’ Union were soon brought into the party prominence.\n\nOn 15th April 1968, the party held its inaugural meeting in Kuala Lumpur during which the objectives and policies of GERAKAN were explicitly spelt out in a document tabled by the pro tem Chairman, Professor Syed Hussein Alatas.\n\nFrom its inception, the party had posed itself as a non-communal party made up of mature and responsible political personalities. Out of the sixteen members elected to the pro tem committee, five were Malays. Following the party’s approval by the Registrar of Societies on 25th May 1968, the first Central Committee comprised six Malays, (including two ladies) six Chinese and three Indians. Total membership was around 1,400, with 43 branches founded mostly in non-Malay urban areas. Dr. Lim Chong Eu in Penang and Dr. Tan Chee Khoon in Kuala Lumpur were the two vital axes around which the party built its national outlook.\n\nWith limited human and financial resources, the party soon busied itself to contest in the 3rd General Election after Merdeka in 1969. When the election was held on 10 May 1969, the party managed to become the State Government of Penang by winning 16 out of 24 seats. Elsewhere, state assembly seats were won in Selangor (4), Perak (2), Kedah (2), Malacca (1) and Pahang (1). In addition to that, 8 members of the party had also made it to the Dewan Rakyat.\n\nThe success of the party was not based on communal sentiments as evidenced by its splendid performance in Penang. For the first time in Malaysia’s electoral history, a non-communal party had shown its viability based on popular mass support. However, with the suspension of parliamentary democracy and the beginning of National Operation Council rule following the May 13 Riot, elected members were not able to exercise their duties to the nation and the people.\n\nIn such a rapidly changing political environment, Dr. Lim Chong Eu acknowledged that political confrontation was detrimental to national unity and could not be tolerated. Besides, cooperation with the Federal Government was necessary to obtain financial assistance for the economic projects that he had planned. Such cooperation would ensure stability and earlier revival of parliamentary democracy. Unfortunately, some leaders construed this as an attempt to establish formal ties with the Alliance Government.\n\nAs different opinions over priorities on short and long term party developments arise within the party, internal crisis brewed into open power struggles, culminating in an abortive attempt to overthrow Dr. Lim Chong Eu’s leadership in the Penang State Government. This occurred shortly after the restoration of parliamentary rule in April 1971. A series of legal proceedings followed, but Dr. Lim Chong Eu’s position as the Acting Chairman of the party was eventually upheld by the court. Consequently, a few leaders and their followers left the party, thereby reducing GERAKAN to a Penang based regional party. To preserve the party’s control over the state government and attain development goals envisaged by the party’s election manifesto for Penang, a coalition government was formed with the Alliance Party on 13th February 1972."
