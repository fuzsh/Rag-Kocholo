        "text": "The epochal 9 May 2018 elections has revigorated this Asian tiger’s appetite for reform and change. However, it remains to be seen if its new government can reverse decades of authoritarian tendencies, allegations of corruption as well as economic stagnation.\n\nNo one knows the opinion shapers in Southeast Asia like we do.\n\nThe KRA GROUP has built-up decades-old, holistic knowledge as well as relationships with key local, regional and international media outlets and stakeholders.\n\n650-million strong Southeast Asia is an increasingly crucial part of the world’s economy.\n\nThe KRA GROUP’s unrivalled networks in and mastery of the region’s corporate culture allows our clients to navigate complex regulatory hurdles as well as accomplish goals across multiple regional markets.\n\nThe KRA GROUP helps its clients to identify as well as engage with key local, national, regional and international stakeholders across the board.\n\nWe advise and assist in finding common ground, in building coalitions and developing best practices.\n\nThe KRA GROUP has developed a deep, ground-up and dynamic understanding of the political, business, media, regulatory and socio-cultural landscape of Southeast Asia.\n\nWe base our strategies on research, on the ground studies and by closely monitoring socio-political and economic trends in this region.\n\nOur team of experts across the region are able to provide timely and tailored insights to clients of all industries and requirements.\n\nMyanmar’s reform, opening up and subsequent democratization was arguably one of the most remarkable developments in the Asia-Pacific in recent times. Nevertheless, the renewed violence between Buddhists and Muslims in the Rakhine state, has hurt Myanmar’s reputation in the international state. It remains to be seen if the NLD government under the now-tarnished democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi can complete its normalization.\n\nOnce considered the sick-man of Asia after decades of misrule, the Philippines has now emerged as one of the fastest economies in the region, growing by an astounding 6.9% in 2016. It has also transformed itself into a BPO powerhouse with USD25 billion in annual revenues, overtaking India as the call-centre of the world. The Philippines—via perennial favourites like Boracay in the Visayas Islands—is also emerging as a global tourism competitor.\n\nCenturies of battling for their independence against Chinese, French and American domination have endowed the Vietnamese with a fierce sense of national pride as well as a determination to protect their freedom. Vietnam today is a rising industrial power, driven by its strong human resources that are constantly seeking self-improvement.\n\nThailand is entering a new era with the passing of King Bhumibol and the anticipated crowning of his son and successor, King Vajiralongkorn. Despite being known as “The Land of Smiles”, Thailand has in recent years witnessed a deep and growing divide, not only between supporters of the deposed former premier Thaksin Shinawatra and the royalist establishment, but also Bangkok and its northern regions."
