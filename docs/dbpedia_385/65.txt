Gerakan played a dominant role in the Penang state legislature from 1969 until 2008. It also enjoyed some success nationally as part of the ruling BN coalition, particularly in the 2004 general election, but Its fortune declined sharply in the 2008 election. Following the fall of BN in the 2018 general election, where Gerakan lost all its seats, it left the coalition.[2] The party joined the then ruling Perikatan Nasional in 2021.[3] It had no representation at the national or state-level until the 2023 Kedah state election, where the party achieved its first electoral victory since 2014. The party is perceived to be dependent on continued membership in the Perikatan Nasional coalition despite clashes with its other members.[4]
