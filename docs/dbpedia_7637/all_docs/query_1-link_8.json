        "text": "Like many careers, filmmakers and film crews have their own set of terms and jargon to define their various jobs, duties, materials, equipment, positions, organizations, and much more. Here is our list of the terms you may need to know in your filmmaking career.\n\n0 – 9 A B C D E F G H I J K L\n\nM N OP Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nFilmmaking Glossary and Film Set Terminology\n\n0-9\n\n10-100 or 10-1: Over the walkie-talkie indicates a bathroom break.\n\n180 Degree Rule: A basic guideline regarding the on-screen spatial relationship between a character and another character or object within a scene. By keeping the camera on one side of an imaginary axis between two characters, the first character is always framed right of the second character. Moving the camera over the axis is called jumping the line or crossing the line; breaking the 180-degree rule by shooting on all sides is known as shooting in the round.\n\n24 Frames Per Second: 24 frames per second (fps) is the standard frame rate for movies shot on film. It refers to the number of frames projected onto the screen per second. Most modern films come in at 24 frames per second, but in the past, they would be projected 16 or 18 fps.\n\n30 Degree Rule: A basic film editing guideline that states the camera should move at least 30 degrees relative to the subject between successive shots of the same subject. If the camera moves less than 30 degrees, the transition between shots may look like a jump cut, which could jar the audience and take them out of the story by causing them to focus on the film technique rather than the narrative itself.\n\n3D Film: Motion pictures are made to give an illusion of three-dimensional solidity, usually with the help of special glasses worn by viewers. The 3D filmmaking process involves using a twin-lensed camera for filming, and images from both lenses are projected into the screens by two different projectors. 3D films work by delivering a different image to each eye, so your brain perceives the depth of the picture.\n\n3D Glasses: 3D glasses are worn when viewing a 3D film. There are three types of 3D eyeglasses that correspond to the three ways stereo frames are separated for 3D effects– anaglyph, polarized and active.\n\nBack to Top\n\nA\n\nAbby (Abby Singer/Abby Singer Shot): A term for the second-to-last shot of the day on a shoot.\n\nAbove The Line: A budgeting term used to describe professionals who influence the creative direction of a film, such the screenwriter, producer, director, and actors.\n\nAbove-the-Line Expenses: The major expenses committed to a project before production begins, including story/rights/continuity, salaries for producers, director, and cast, travel, living expenses, and production fees (if the project is bought from an earlier company). Everything else falls under below-the-line expenses.\n\nAbstract Film: Non-narrative films that contain no acting and do not attempt to reference reality or concrete subjects. They rely on the unique qualities of motion, rhythm, light and composition inherent in the technical medium of cinema to create emotional experiences.\n\nAbsurd/Absurdism: Focuses on the experiences of characters in situations where they cannot find any inherent purpose in life, most often represented by ultimately meaningless actions and events that call into question the certainty of existential concepts such as truth or value.\n\nAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS): A professional honorary organization with the stated goal of advancing the arts and sciences of motion pictures.

For example, the reimagining or rewriting of an original non-film work with the specific intention of presenting it in the form of a film.\n\nAdditional Camera/ B Camera: An extra camera, is often needed for complicated action sequences, stunts, or to obtain coverage faster.\n\nAdditional Photography/ Reshoots/ Pickups: Focus group or studio reaction to some shots or scenes may be bad enough to convince the filmmakers to discard them or add additional or altered scenes.

Camp aesthetics disrupt many of modernism’s notions of what art and film can be and what can be classified as high art by inverting aesthetic attributes such as beauty, value, and taste through an invitation of a different kind of apprehension and consumption. Camp art is related to and often confused with kitsch, and things with camp appeal may be described as cheesy. John Waters is a good example of someone known for their campy films.\n\nCan/ In the Can/ Reel: A dated term from when films were only/mostly shot of film stock carried on reels stored in round, metal or plastic film canisters.

Although many types of films may be directed toward a female audience, the term “chick flick” is typically used only in reference to films that contain personal drama and emotion or themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic, as films may focus on parent-child or friend relationships). This term is often considered derogatory and is now used sparingly.\n\nChild Actor: Generally applied to a child acting on stage or on-screen.

It’s made of a plastic base coated with layers of chemicals. These chemicals react when they’re exposed to light, recording the image you see through your camera lens.\n\nColour Temperature: Colour temperature is a system that uses numerical values to measure the colour characteristics of a light source on a spectrum ranging from warm colours to cool colours. The numerical values are referred to as degrees Kelvin (K). The two common standard colour temperatures for film and video lighting are “Tungsten” at 3200K and “Daylight” at 5600K.\n\nColour Timing: Colour timing is an analog laboratory process for manipulating colour in photochemical film workflows.

It is a positive film with both picture and corresponding sound on the same film, which may be in editorial or projection synchronism. A composite release print contains picture and sound records in projection synchronism on the same film.\n\nCompositing: Compositing is the process or technique of combining visual elements from separate sources into single images, often to create the illusion that all those elements are parts of the same scene. Live-action shooting for compositing is variously called “chroma key”, “blue screen”, “green screen” and other names.\n\nComposition: Refers to the arrangement of different elements (for example, colours, shapes, figures, lines, movement, and lighting) within a frame and in a scene.\n\nCompositor: Compositors create the final image of a frame, shot or VFX sequence.

Compositors consider the visual aspects of a scene.\n\nComputer Animation Production System/ CAPS: A proprietary collection of software, scanning camera systems, servers, networked computer workstations, and custom desks developed by Disney and Pixar in the late 1980s. Although outmoded by the mid-2000s, it succeeded in reducing labour costs for ink and paint and post-production processes of traditionally animated feature films. It also provided an entirely new palette of digital tools to the filmmakers. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI).\n\nConcert Film: A concert film is a movie that records a live musical performance of a band, singer, or stand-up comedian.

This means that the characters in the shot have a large spatial scope, so that they sometimes even seem to disappear within the wide area. Deep space can be achieved by establishing a very long z-axis that opens the available stage. More often than not, deep space is combined with deep focus, which requires that elements placed along very different depth planes of the image (i.e. foreground, middle ground and background) be in focus at the same time. However, for deep staging, these objects do not necessarily have to be in focus. Staging in deep space is the opposite of staging in flat space.\n\nDeleted Scene: Refers to a scene that was edited out of a film’s final cut for several possible reasons: the scene was poorly done, the scene was unnecessary, the film’s running time needed truncation, the film was avoiding an R or NC-17 rating, the film’s studio disapproved of it, etc.\n\nDenouement: The point in a film that immediately follows the climax when everything in the plot has been resolved. It’s typically the final scene in a movie and is also known as the resolution.\n\nDepth of Field: The depth of a shot’s focus in relation to the foreground, middle-ground and background. Shallow depth of field might keep only one of those planes in focus, while deep depth of field would keep all of them in focus.\n\nDepth of Focus: Depth of Focus is directly related to depth of field. It refers to making an adjustment so that a camera shot keeps its deep focus throughout all of the various planes.\n\nDesaturation: Refers to colours of less luminosity and vividness. Desaturated colours have a reduced amount of their initial colour (hue) due to the addition of their complementary colour. Complementary colours are colours that face each other on the colour wheel.
