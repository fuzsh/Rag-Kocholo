        "text": "Although it can be a difficult, talking to your children about race, racism, and prejudice early (and often) is essential, particularly for parents of non Black children. The fact is children start to learn racial bias — the attitudes and stereotypes towards racial groups — at an early age. According the American Academy of Pediatrics, a 6-month-old's brain can notice race-based differences; a 2- to 4-year-old can internalize racial biases. The best way to combat these thoughts is to talk to your kids about race and racism. Of course, that isn't easy and utilizing tools that speak on their level can help, including kid-friendly movies about race and racism.\n\nSome of the best films about blackness are a little too violent and explicit for younger viewers. But that doesn’t mean your child is too young to watch any movies that revolve around race. If you want to start a dialogue about racial prejudice and don’t know where to start, then these 15 family-friendly movies about race may just help you out.\n\nCorinne Sullivan is an Editor at Cosmopolitan, where she covers a variety of beats, including lifestyle, entertainment, relationships, shopping, and more.
