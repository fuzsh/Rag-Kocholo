To celebrate that, here are the best Black movies of the last 30 years.\n\nMalcolm X (1992)\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nStars: Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, Albert Hall, Al Freeman, Jr., Delroy Lindo, Spike Lee, Theresa Randle, Roger Guenveur Smith, Wendell Pierce, Giancarlo Esposito, James McDaniel, Tommy Hollis\n\nSpike Lee never cowers in the face of a challenge. In fact, he welcomes them. He has tackled subjects too many filmmakers haven't had the guts for. In the early '90s, he faced his biggest task to date: bringing the life of Malcolm X to the big screen. Lee had little room for error considering the subject matter, and he delivered because he had to.\n\nMalcolm X is one of the most thorough and impressive biopics ever made. Lee's expert direction begins with the opening scene, which features X delivering an anti-white America speech over grainy footage of the LAPD's beating of Rodney King. As the crowd voices its support, an American flag catches fire, burning until it forms a perfect \"X.\" It's spellbinding cinema.\n\nHeavily inspired by Alex Haley's The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Malcolm X begins with Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) still a petty criminal. He's sent to jail for burglary, but his incarceration proves to be a blessing in disguise, as he's exposed to the teachings of Islam and learns discipline. Upon his release from prison, he adopts the last name \"X\" and rises within the Nation of Islam, but his ascent is met with resentment and opposition, especially when he and mentor Elijah Muhammad begin to feud. Suspended by the Nation, he makes his pilgrimage to Mecca, where he learns that there is good in all races. Upon his return to the United States, he denounces racism and becomes open to working with the civil rights leaders he had previously shunned. The film follows X up until his assassination at Harlem's Audobon Ballroom in 1965.\n\nWashington delivers what is possibly the finest performance of his career, portraying X at different stages of his life and capturing every nuance. The quiet moments leading up to his death are some of the most moving scenes he's ever been involved in. It's a crime that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor that year.\n\nJuice (1992)\n\nDirector: Ernest Dickerson\n\nStars: Omar Epps, Tupac Shakur, Khalil Kain, Jermaine \"Huggy\" Hopkins, Samuel L. Jackson, Queen Latifah, Cindy Herron\n\nWhen Spike Lee's longtime friend and collaborator Ernest Dickerson sat in the director's chair for the first time to helm Juice, he created a harrowing story about four Harlem teens whose friendship is tested by a bitter power struggle. Known as \"The Wrecking Crew,\" Q (Omar Epps), Bishop (Tupac Shakur), Raheem (Khalil Kain), and Steel (Jermaine Hopkins) pass through their teens by cutting school and innocently bullshitting their way through life. This includes semi-regular truancy at a local arcade and stealing vinyl from a record shop to satisfy Q's DJ aspirations.\n\nAfter witnessing the aftermath of a local robbery, they agree to stick up a bodega, but things go wrong when Bishop inexplicably kills the owner. A debate between Bishop and Raheem, the two extremes of the group, ends in tragedy as Bishop succumbs to the dark side, terrifying his former friends.\n\nJuice is about power because, well, \"juice\" is power. The crew, generally good guys, lack it initially. When they acquire it through the possession of a firearm, their morals are tested. Anyone with a gun is considerably more intimidating, if not downright frightening. If you were disappointed that Nas never made a video for \"I Gave You Power,\" realize that it arrived four years before It Was Written's release via Juice.\n\nThe performances are solid, with a young Omar Epps portraying a young man who goes along with his friends' activities but still has a conscience. Khalil Kain plays Raheem as the straight man; the level-headed one, presumably because he's a teenage father. Jermaine Hopkins provides comic relief as the portly Steel, but it's Tupac who steals the show as the sociopathic Bishop. He's hungry for respect; he finally finds it through a gun, but he's too unstable to handle it.\n\nThere's one particular scene that stands out: Following Raheem's death, Q is at his locker. When he shuts the door, an expressionless Bishop is standing there, nothing at all behind his eyes. Their calm conversation quickly escalates into a shouting match where Bishop (the holder of the gun, and therefore, the power) reminds Q that he holds his mortality in his hands. Tupac is able to express so much of Bishop's anger and distance with his face, proving that he was already a stellar actor in his first starring role. Juice is a painful reminder that power should never be granted to those not equipped to harness it.\n\n'The Harder They Fall' (2021)\n\nDirector: Jeymes Samuel\n\nStars: Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba, Zazie Beetz, Regina King, Delroy Lindo, Lakeith Stanfield, RJ Cyler, Danielle Deadwyler, Edi Gathegi, Deon Cole\n\nOne of 2021’s best, The Harder They Fall brought us a bombastic look at the life of the Black cowboy in the Wild West. Samuels’ feature-length directorial debut tells the tale of Nat Love (Majors), making his way through the West while ultimately on the hunt for the man who took out his family, Rufus Buck (Elba). Love and Buck assemble their squads and go at each others heads, with a plethora of violence, dancehall needle drops, and one smoky train. Regina King shines (as per usual), with Majors, Elba, and Lindo all in top form. Lakeith Stanfield plays the background to perfection; truth be told, this film knows what it is and has no problem showing you what time it is. Just press play. —khal\n\nDa 5 Bloods (2020)\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nStars: Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Mélanie Thierry, Paul, Walter Hauser, Jasper Pääkkönen, Jean Reno, Chadwick Boseman\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, Netflix unleashed Oscar Award-winning director Spike Lee’s gritty war drama Da 5 Bloods onto the masses. The film—which featured magnificent work from Delroy Lindo, rising star Jonathan Majors as his son, and one of the last performances from the great Chadwick Boseman—was royally snubbed at the Oscars, but none of that mattered, because this film did a lot. It told the story of the Black experience in the Vietnam War. It was a savage war film as well. It even dealt with MAGA politics, father-son relationships, and had all kinds of action/heist movie vibes at the film’s climax. Lee has been consistently doing his thing for decades, and Da 5 Bloods was proof that Lee not only has his finger on the pulse, but will continue to keep his foot on your neck, theatrically. —khal\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah (2021)\n\nDirector: Shaka King\n\nStars: Daniel Kaluuya, LaKeith Stanfield, Jesse Plemons, Dominique Fishback, Ashton Sanders, Darrell Britt-Gibson, Lil Rel Howery, Algee Smith, Martin Sheen\n\nWhile not a biopic, Judas and the Black Messiah takes a look at the time Chairman Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya in a Golden Globe-nominated performance) spend with the Black Panther Party in Chicago, building the Rainbow Coalition, and the events that lead to his murder, which was orchestrated in part by information given to the Feds by William O’Neal (LaKeith Stanfield). With a strong cast of young, Black actors, catapulted by the work Kaluuya and Stanfield provide, Judas examines just how deep the government got into the death of this young Black man. An early standout in Best Film of 2021 conversations, Judas is the right movie for the movement at the right time.\n\nOne Night in Miami (2020)\n\nDirector: Regina King\n\nStars: Kingsley Ben-Adir, Eli Goree, Aldis Hodge, Leslie Odom Jr.\n\nRaken from Kemp Powers’ 2013 play One Night in Miami, Regina King’s directorial debut (which netted the award-winning actress her first Golden Globe nomination for Best Director) lays out a fictional night in Miami with four Black legends: Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Cassius Clay before becoming Muhammad Ali (Eli Goree), Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge) and Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr., in a Golden Globe-nominated performance). The four icons talk about what the community needs, balancing that with their own personal works and goals, and more in a gripping back and forth that may shed new light on these figures and why they moved the way they moved. An important film to add to your canon of Black cinema.\n\nMiss Juneteenth (2020)\n\nDirector: Channing Godfrey Peoples​​​​​​​\n\nStars: Nicole Beharie, Kendrick Sampson, Alexis Chikaeze\n\nIn her debut as a director, Channing Godfrey Peoples takes it back to Texas, the state where Juneteenth originated, to tell a delicate story of Turquoise Jones (Nicole Beharie), a single mother and former Miss Juneteenth struggling to keep the bills paid and her daughter’s head on the right path, leading to her own Miss Juneteenth pageant. It’s a real story, with Beharie putting the film on her back in a way that many have been waiting to see from her. She adds reality to her portrayal of Turquoise, a woman who may not have all of the right answers, but does have a good heart and the determination to make a way for herself. Miss Juneteenth isn’t a film that gives you the history of Juneteenth (although you do get some of that in this film), because that’s not what it’s supposed to do. It’s a film that showcases what Black life is, day-to-day, with an actress at the forefront who delivers a spectacular performance, reminding you of the aunts and mothers and cousins in your own family.\n\nFresh (1994)\n\nDirector: Boaz Yakin\n\nStars: Sean Nelson, Giancarlo Esposito, Samuel L. Jackson, N'Bushe Wright\n\nA film like Fresh might get dismissed by many as another street crime drug film...which it is. The problem is most of those films end in a hail of gunfire; Fresh has its share of violence, but it’s really about the chess game being played. Sean Nelson, who you may remember from The Wood and HBO's The Corner, starred in this one early, playing Fresh, a streetwise kid who has big aspirations and a lot of connections to the streets. He is also an avid chess player, and it’s the scenes with his absentee father (played by Samuel L. Jackson!) that helps him devise a plan after experiencing some of the harsher sides of life: can he escape the drug game as masterfully as he would on the chessboard? Also featured is acting legend Giancarlo Esposito as the big bad, and N'Bushe Wright (who you definitely remember from Blade) in a smaller, powerful role.\n\nBlack Panther (2018)\n\nDirector: Ryan Coogler\n\nStars: Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis\n\nThere have been black superhero films before, but none like this. We’ve seen campy superhero movies like Robert Townsend’s Meteor Man and Damon Wayans’ Blankman. Then of course there were anti-heroes like Spawn and Blade. But Black Panther is vastly different from its predecessors, in a good way.\n\nBlack Panther follows the newly appointed king of Wakanda, T’Challa, as he confronts his father’s death and his responsibility to his people, as well as the rest of the suffering world that could use Wakanda’s resources. In the midst of this, he also has to confront villains like Klaw, who is after the country’s vibranium and Erik Killmonger, who’s after the throne. Even with all of this conflict, there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.\n\nRyan Coogler delivered the best black superhero film of all time with Shakespearean twists, epic chase scenes, and a palpable love between the characters. It’s no wonder it had one of the biggest opening weekends ever.\n\nBlacKkKlansman (2018)\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nStars: John David Washington, Adam Driver, Laura Harrier, Topher Grace\n\nThe film that got Spike Lee his Oscar (Best Adapted Screenplay), BlacKkKlansman was based on the absolutely true story of a black police officer who went undercover as a Klansman. Lee cast frequent collaborator Denzel Washington's son John David Washington (Ballers) as that officer in a film whose tale mirrors the current political climate we're in. Hilarious and true, this is another satire on American culture, with powerful performances from Washington and Adam Driver as his white face in the Klan. For fans of Lee's who felt like he wasn't bringing in with his last few outings, he received much acclaim for his \"return to form,\" mixing humor with drama, using reality to expose society. The fact that he included footage from the Unite the Right rally from 2017 before the credits roll is intentional; the game may have a different name, but it's still wholly the same. And that's the quintessential truth, Ruth.\n\nPoetic Justice (1993)\n\nDirector: John Singleton\n\nStars: Janet Jackson, Tupac Shakur, Tyra Ferrell, Regina King, Joe Torry\n\nThe second of Singleton's \"hood trilogy,\" and his second film as a director, Poetic Justice showed the softer side of the hood. Following Lucky (Shakur), we saw how some unconventional romances come together. Dude drives the mail truck, has a daughter, and tries to make music to get out of the hood. She's still wrecked over the murder of her boyfriend. One road trip later, we start to see true feelings blossom and develop. The streets still creep in, in a number of ways, but there's a dope love story wrapped up in here. There's also Regina King proving that she's always been a boss, as well as an appearance from Maya Angelou. Hood love classic.\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk (2018)\n\nDirector: Barry Jenkins\n\nStars: Regina King, Stephan James, Kiki Layne, Teyonah Parris, Dave Franco\n\nAdapting a dynamic novel like James Baldwin’s If Beale Street Could Talk is a Herculean task, but when word hit that Moonlight director Barry Jenkins was taking on the project, many felt a sense of ease. Story aside, Jenkins proved in his Academy Award-winning debut that he knew how to make black bodies shine on the silver screen, and his eye is back in all of its glory in Beale Street. The film tells the stressful tale of two lifelong friends turned lovers who get hit with big news: on the one hand, they’re going to have a baby. They also have to figure out why Fonny (Stephan James) was accused of a rape he seemingly couldn’t have possibly committed. With powerful performances from James, Kiki Layne, Brian Tyree Henry, and Regina King (who received Golden Globe and Oscar noms for her performance in the film), as well as a story that is as relevant then as it is today, you need to make this film a part of your life.\n\nMoonlight (2016)\n\nDirector: Barry Jenkins\n\nStars: Mahershala Ali, Alex R. Hibbert, Janelle Monae, Naomie Harris, Ashton Sanders, Jharrel Jerome, Trevante Rhodes, André Holland\n\nBased on Tarell Alvin's In Moonlight, Black Boys Look Blue, Moonlight follows Chiron throughout three phases of his life: as a kid, as a teenager, and as an adult. Through each phase, he struggles with finding his identity while dealing with his crack-addicted mother (brilliantly played by Naomie Harris).\n\nWhile following Chiron’s life, the film is able to touch on other themes like mass incarceration, the school-to-prison pipeline, bullying, the drug cycle, and death. But it’s his childhood friend, Kevin, who meets him at every stage of his life and ends up contributing heavily to the turning points.\n\nAt its core, Moonlight is a love story that shows two black men being intimate with each other in a way that’s rarely—if ever—seen on screen. James Laxton’s cinematography work also allowed black bodies to not only be seen by the camera, but illuminated in all their richness, as well. The film also showed the gritty poor side of Miami that is rarely seen, along with the quiet beauty of the city. Plus, that chopped and screwed version of Jidenna’s “Classic Man” is awesome. There’s a reason Moonlight earned the 2017 Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nDirector: Jordan Peele\n\nStars: Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford, Caleb Landry Jones\n\nWhen news hit that comedian Jordan Peele would be directing a horror film, the idea was met with skepticism. While Peele often comments on race with his comedic partner, Keegan-Michael Key, it’s usually on the silly side of things (like a black substitute teacher mispronouncing white students’ name because he’s used to different pronunciations). But with the backing of Blumhouse Productions, which produced horror heavyweights like Insidious, The Purge, Split, and Paranormal Activity, there was a good chance that it would be a hit. And it was.\n\nGet Out follows a black man, Chris, who goes to meet his white girlfriend, Rose’s parents for the first time at their house in the middle of the woods. What follows are hints to microaggressions, like Rose’s father telling him that he “would have voted for Obama for a third time” and a mind-bending twist that kept us away from anyone with a teacup for days.\n\nBut it wasn’t just the story that resonated with viewers; it was the stark imagery, like the tears that roll down Chris’ unblinking eyes or Rose consuming her milk and cereal separately, that inspired countless artwork pieces. While giving us the best parts about the horror genres like the surprise pop-up, a heartless antagonist, and scary real consequences, there’s also social commentary that provided endless think piece material.\n\nThe film’s Easter eggs also spawned a series of fan theories that make it even more fun to watch each. Every time you watch it, you to catch new things. Basically, Peele is a genius.\n\nFriday (1995)\n\nDirector: F. Gary Gray\n\nStars: Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, Nia Long, Bernie Mac, Tiny \"Zeus\" Lister, Jr., John Witherspoon, Anna Maria Horsford, Regina King, Paula Jai Parker, DJ Pooh, Faizon Love, Tony Cox\n\nAfter directing a few of Ice Cube's videos, F. Gary Gray struck gold with his first feature film, the cult-classic comedy Friday. Cube plays Craig, who's experiencing a long weekend after getting fired from his job, for allegedly stealing boxes. (Is this ever confirmed? Does it even matter?) Anyway, his pothead friend, Smokey (Chris Tucker), has a remedy for the situation: get high, because it's Friday and there's nothing better to do. Little does Craig know that Smokey, possibly the worst low-level drug dealer ever, has goaded him into getting high on his own supply when he's already in debt to Big Worm (Faizon Love). They spend the day trying to raise the $200 Smokey owes Big Worm, all the while avoiding hulking neighborhood bully Deebo (Tiny \"Zeus\" Lister, Jr.) and trying to keep a close eye on everyone's dream girl, Debbie (Nia Long).\n\nFriday doesn't force a deep message down your throat, the plot isn't intricate, and a great portion of the film takes place on Craig's front porch. But the characters carry this movie and make it a classic. The loud, animated Smokey provides constant comic relief; Debbie is that around-the-way girl that every dude covets; and Craig is the laid-back hero who knocks the neighborhood bully the fuck out and gets the girl in the end. It's your average Friday in the hood, except this one is endlessly quotable and has infinite replay value.\n\nThe Wood (1999)\n\nDirector: Rick Famuyiwa\n\nStars: Omar Epps, Taye Diggs, Richard T. Jones, Sanaa Lathan, LisaRaye McCoy, Sean Nelson, Duane Finley, Trent Cameron, Malinda Williams, De'Aundre Bonds, Antwon Tanner\n\nA wedding is the perfect time for reflection. In the underrated The Wood, three friends fondly recall several important moments in their lives, as well as their friendship, before one's marriage.\n\nIt's Roland's (Taye Diggs) big day, and he's nowhere to be found, much to the anger of friends Slim (Richard T. Jones) and Mike (Omar Epps). A drunk, cold-footed Roland is eventually discovered at an old girlfriend's house, and Mike and Slim are forced to sober him up and rush him to the altar. The story, told from Mike's perspective, flashes back to the first time they met in junior high school, and recalls important moments from their teen years growing up in Inglewood, California.\n\nThe Wood is a bright coming-of-age tale about firsts: the first time you met your best friends, the first time you thought your life was in danger, the first time you had sex, and the first time you realized you were in love. Mike narrates the story, occasionally breaking the fourth wall. During the flashback scenes, he grows from an awkward kid with a country accent to the glue that holds the trio together.\n\nIt's a lighthearted yet deep analysis of a friendship that's lasted roughly half of the primary character's lives. The flashbacks are easily the best scenes, capturing the awkwardness of being a teenager with hilarious accuracy. Music plays a key role in The Wood, with Ahmad's \"Back in the Day\" introducing the film's premise during the opening credits and Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn's \"If This World Were Mine\" cover playing during two of the film's most important moments.\n\nIn the 19 years since its release, The Wood has proven to be timeless. It never gets old because viewers will always compare Mike, Roland, and Slim's experiences to their own. At some point, most people will have been in both positions: teenagers just trying to make sense of life and adults reminiscing on those ridiculous antics while preparing for marriage, yet another milestone.\n\nBamboozled (2000)\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nStars: Damon Wayans, Savion Glover, Jada Pinkett Smith, Michael Rapaport, Tommy Davidson, Mos Def, Thomas Jefferson Byrd, Paul Mooney, Canibus, Gano Grills, Charlie Baltimore, MC Serch, The Roots\n\nWith Bamboozled, Spike Lee places racial stereotypes perpetuated by the media in his crosshairs and pulled the trigger. The film focuses on Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans), a stuffy executive at the fictional Continental Network System television network. He's constantly harassed at work by his boss (Michael Rapaport), a white man who freely uses the n-word and fancies himself a black man (“more” black than Delacroix, as he reminds him) because he's married to a black woman. He scoffs at Delacroix's scripts, which depict blacks in a positive light because of their Cosby Show overtones.\n\nFeeling trapped and tired of being degraded, Delacroix recruits his assistant Sloan (Jada Pinkett Smith) to help create a new-age minstrel show, convinced it will get him fired. To his horror, the network loves the idea of Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show and it becomes a hit with audiences. A radical hip hop group known as the Mau Maus and led by Hopkins' brother (Mos Def) is irate about the show's concept and decides to bring it to a violent end.\n\nFrom its 135-minute running time to the decision to film it in Mini DV digital video, Bamboozled is a flawed film. Yes, it can be heavy-handed, but Lee is still on point when the film satirically acknowledges the issues plaguing African Americans in entertainment. Bamboozled reinforces the idea that television networks are only concerned with ratings and money, not with promoting intelligent portrayals of minorities. The success of Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show across racial lines allows other races to feel entirely too comfortable with the use of the word n-word; this is Lee analyzing its power and the notion that sharing it with the masses makes it acceptable to use—a flawed notion, indeed.\n\nLee uses Manray’s (Savion Glover) tap-dancing as a metaphor for minorities abandoning their morals to please larger audiences. Aside from Manray's assassination at the hands of the Mau Maus, the most powerful scene is arguably the Mau Maus' death at the hands of the police. Only one life is spared: One-Sixteenth Blak (MC Serch), the lone white member. His pleas for police to kill him as well speak to a twisted need for acceptance. Bamboozled may be too layered and too intense at times, but that doesn't make its points any less significant.\n\nSet It Off (1996)\n\nDirector: F. Gary Gray\n\nStars: Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox, Kimberly Elise, John C. McGinley, Blair Underwood\n\nSet It Off follows four black women who are fed up with their cleaning jobs and decide to rob a bank to earn some major cash. However, they quickly become a news sensation as the police gain on them.\n\nJada Pinkett-Smith’s character, Stony, shares a steamy scene with Blair Underwood’s Keith over the classic song En Vogue’s “Don’t Let Go (Love) that made us want to take a trip to the grocery store to pick up some chocolate syrup, ASAP. And let’s not forget the ending, which has us ugly crying to Brandy’s “Missing You” as Stony cuts off her braids and reminisces on the good times with her friends. Did we mention that the soundtrack is dope? It’s dope.\n\nNext Day Air (2009)\n\nDirector: Benny Boom\n\nStars: Donald Faison, Mike Epps, Wood Harris, Omari Hardwick, Emilio Rivera, Darius McCrary, Cisco Reyes, Yasmin Deliz\n\nNext Day Air is one of those films that you probably started watching randomly on a Sunday afternoon only to find out that it’s one of the most outrageously funny films ever. The underrated classic stars Donald Faison as a delivery man who accidentally drops off a package of drugs to the wrong door. Instead of delivering to a Hispanic couple expecting it from a ruthless drug lord, he delivers it to Wood Harris and Mike Epps’ door. The two decide that it must be a gift from God to get them out of their financial woes.\n\nThe film contains one of Yasiin Bey’s (then-Mos Def) rare film appearances, a pre-Power Omari Hardwick, and Darius McCrary as a drug dealer who’ll have you questioning his wholesome appeal as Eddie Winslow in Family Matters. Overall, Next Day Air is a solid film that’s not afraid to take risks, and spoiler alert, nobody’s safe.\n\nWhile Benny Boom is mostly known for his music videos, he made a sleeper hit with this one.\n\nPariah (2011)\n\nDirector: Dee Rees\n\nStars: Adepero Oduye, Aasha Davis, Kim Wayans, Charles Parnell, Pernell Walker, Sahra Mellesse\n\nOn the surface, Pariah is a coming-of-age tale, told from the perspective of a young woman. At its core, it's a film about the struggle for acceptance. Based on writer and director Dee Rees' 2007 short film of the same name, Pariah follows 17-year-old Alike (Adepero Oduye), who has accepted the fact that she is a lesbian. Her parents, Audrey (Kim Wayans) and Arthur (Charles Parnell) are less understanding. Her mother is angry at the sudden changes in her daughter's life, and while her father is accepting, he's convinced it's all just a phase.\n\nHoping that religion can place her daughter on what she perceives to be the right path, Audrey encourages a friendship between Alike and Bina (Aasha Davis), a girl from her church. Unbeknownst to Audrey, Bina is bi-curious. She and Alike share a moment of intimacy, and when Alike finally comes out to her family, the resulting fight forces her to seek refuge with her friend, Laura (Pernell Walker). Following her father's feeble attempt at reconciliation, paired with her mother's staunch opposition to it, Alike elects (a point she reinforces) to find a home away from her native New York.\n\nAlike’s parents, Bina, and Laura serve as her mirror. She's comfortable with herself and while Laura and Bina accept her for who she is, her parents’ denial about her sexual identity is painful. She confuses her night with Bina as a relationship and finds out that Bina was only interested in experimenting. After experiencing rejection following her first sexual experience and rejection from her family, Alike is pushed over the edge. She already feels like an outcast due to her race, sexual preference, and gender; being turned away by a love interest and her family are the final alienations she can take. Pariah displays brave filmmaking by Rees and brave acting by the cast, especially Oduye.\n\nMenace ll Society (1993)\n\nDirector: Allen Hughes and Albert Hughes\n\nStars: Tyrin Turner, Larenz Tate, Jada Pinkett Smith, MC Eiht, Samuel L. Jackson, Glenn Plummer, Clifton Powell, Arnold Johnson, Khandi Alexander, Too Short, Bill Duke\n\nThe debate over which film is better, Menace II Society or Boyz N the Hood, is much like the Nas and Jay Z argument. After decades, it hasn't let up, and it still makes revisiting the material an enjoyable experience. Only to a certain extent, of course, as there's nothing pleasant about watching Menace II Society. As the son of a drug-dealing father and drug-addicted mother, Caine (Tyrin Turner), the film's protagonist, seems doomed from the start. He sees too much too soon, and by the time he reaches the end of high school, he's following in his father's footsteps. But compared to his unstable friend O-Dog (Larenz Tate), he's damn near a saint. Just teens, they're caught up in the very adult world of crime, and the consequences are devastating.\n\nBoyz N the Hood has moments of brightness and some sense of hope; Menace II Society is devoid of both. It's ugly and violent, a near nihilistic film from filmmakers who were just 21 at the time it was released.\n\nWhen the film reaches its bleak resolution, you know that there's little that Caine could've done to save himself from his fate, and it's on the viewer to want more from the world.\n\nDead Presidents (1995)\n\nDirector: Allen Hughes and Albert Hughes\n\nStars: Larenz Tate, Bokeem Woodbine, Keith David, Freddy Rodriguez, Chris Tucker, Rose Jackson, N'Bushe Wright, Alvaleta Guess, James Pickens, Jr., Clifton Powell\n\nSpanning nearly 20 years, the Vietnam War had a crippling effect on the young men involved. Anyone fortunate enough to return home did so changed forever, and in many cases, for the worse. Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate) graduates from high school in the late '60s and enlists in the U.S. Marine Corps, eventually accompanied by friend Skip (Chris Tucker); his other friend, Jose (Freddy Rodriguez), gets drafted by the Army. In Vietnam, Anthony witnesses the horrors of war, serving several tours before finally coming back to the Bronx in the early '70s. Struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and the task of supporting his family, Anthony sees no choice but to resort to crime and helps organize the robbery of an armored car, clad in face paint.\n\nDead Presidents analyzes how the U.S. government uses young men, only to abandon them when they return home from war broken. Veterans who fought for their country feel cheated in their struggle to readjust to the world with little assistance from Uncle Sam. Anthony, whose downward spiral into crime is also motivated by alcohol, expresses this struggle as he's being sentenced for his role in the robbery. When the judge delivers his sentence, he launches into a violent tirade because the institution he committed to failed him. Add an amazing soundtrack of '60s and '70s classics and you have a strong film that encapsulates life for soldiers after the battle.\n\nLove Jones (1997)\n\nDirector: Theodore Witcher\n\nStars: Larenz Tate, Nia Long, Isaiah Washington, Lisa Nicole Carson, Bill Bellamy, Leonard Roberts, Khalil Kain\n\nLove Jones is the story of Darius (Larenz Tate) and Nina (Nia Long). Darius, a poet, is awestruck when he comes across the aspiring photographer, but their meeting arrives at the wrong time—Nina is recovering from a recent breakup. Add the fact that Darius has never maintained a long-term relationship to the equation, and you have the predicament that so many 20-somethings find themselves in: wanting each other, but without wanting to fully commit. People often get what they want, yet don't know what to do once they get it. Darius and Nina are confused about the next move, but it's so obvious that they love each other that you want to see them make it.\n\nIn his directorial debut, Theodore Witcher creates a smart love story about smart characters. Darius, Nina, and their friends have intelligent conversations, but just because they're knowledgeable doesn't mean they have all of the answers. The film really works because of Tate and Long's magnetic chemistry; if nobody bought their relationship, the entire film would've failed.\n\nRemember that Love Jones was released just six years after Boyz N The Hood (which Long appeared in) and four years after Menace ll Society (which Tate starred in); the range they displayed provided a nice contrast to past roles, letting viewers see them in an entirely different light. That's growth.\n\nBest Man Holiday (2013)\n\nDirector: Malcolm D. Lee\n\nStars: Taye Diggs, Sanaa Lathan, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut, Monica Calhoun, Harold Perrineau, Regina Hall, Terrence Howard, Melissa De Sousa\n\nWhile The Best Man is a classic film about a man discovering that his wife cheated on him with his best man, it became even better when the exact same cast returned 14 years later (looking barely a day older, at that) to continue to storyline of the beloved characters. While the crew seemed to be over most of the drama of the first film, there was plenty more issues at hand in the Christmas-themed movie.\n\nWhat truly makes this film stellar (aside from the star-studded ensemble black cast), is the heartbreaking ending that will change the crew for life. In the end, there’s plenty of black love, friendship, and pain to leave your heart full. Plus, that dance-off scene is legit.\n\nCrooklyn (1994)\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nStars: Zelda Harris, Delroy Lindo, Alfre Woodard, Carlton Williams, Sharif Rashed, Chris Knowings, Isaiah Washington, Spike Lee, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Joie Susannah Lee, Frances Foster\n\nSpike Lee's own experiences growing up in Brooklyn inspired Crooklyn, a film that takes a unique angle: a coming-of-age tale told from the female perspective.\n\nSet in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood during the early 1970s, Crooklyn focuses on the trials and tribulations of the Carmichael family. Troy (Zelda Harris) is her parents’ only daughter and quite possibly the only level-headed member of the family. Her parents are constantly arguing over money and her brothers are always bouncing off the walls off their brownstone. After experiencing a different side of life following a stay with her more stable, more wealthy extended family, she returns to Brooklyn a different person. More mature, she finds herself forced to take a more active role in holding her family together.\n\nLee wrote Crooklyn with his sister Joie Lee and brother Cinqué Lee, but they say the film is only semi-autobiographical. Still, as the late Roger Ebert mentioned in his review, some scenes are so painfully accurate that they have to be drawn on real-life experiences. Once Troy returns from her southern vacation, her mother passes the torch to her and tasks her with the responsibility of watching out for the entire family—even her father. At a young age, she's asked to fill a huge void, and Zelda Harris' acting allows you to see the immediate change towards the film's end.\n\nCrooklyn may not be Lee's most talked about film, but it's his most personal and certainly one of his best.\n\nCB4 (1993)\n\nDirector: Tamra Davis\n\nStars: Chris Rock, Allen Payne, Deezer D, Chris Elliott, Phil Hartman, Charlie Murphy, Khandi Alexander, Art Evans, Theresa Randle, Rachel True\n\nFaking it until you make it works—until, of course, you make it and your past returns to haunt you. In Tamra Davis' spot-on satire CB4, a group of wannabe rappers (Chris Rock, Allen Payne, and Deezer D) seek help from hilariously intimidating goon Gusto (Charlie Murphy). They appropriate his hardcore persona into their music, fashioning themselves CB4, or \"Cell Block 4,\" a far cry from their wholesome upbringing. Their thug appeal results in popularity, but when Gusto breaks out of prison, good sense makes them drop the act, but not before Gusto ends up back behind bars where he belongs.\n\nCB4 excels at making fun of hip hop itself. The Wacky Dee character is a blatant reference to MC Hammer; CB4's hit single \"Straight Outta Locash\" is a parody of N.W.A.'s \"Straight Outta Compton\"; and the idea that an image needs to be sold to the public is a faulty idea that still plagues hip hop to this day. Chris Rock helped to write the film, and being the self-aware genius that he is, he was smart enough to reference some of his past roles, including New Jack City's crack-addicted Pookie and the skinny, Jheri curl-wearing kid pestering the great Isaac Hayes for a single rib in I'm Gonna Git You Sucka.\n\nThough hip hop doesn't take itself too seriously (well, some artists do), it occasionally needs a good lampooning. This is why CB4 remains a trailblazing piece of filmmaking.\n\nGirlhood (2014)\n\nDirector: Céline Sciamma\n\nStars: Karidja Touré, Assa Syllam, Lindsay Karamoh, Mariétou Touré\n\nWhile Paris is often thought of as the beautiful city of love, Girlhood showed that there is another side to the French capital. The 2014 film follows Marieme, a 16-year-old who’s slumming it in Paris while dealing with her abusive older brother as their mom goes to vocational school. It isn’t long before she finds herself immersed in gang life full of leather jackets and flashy jewelry. But within their criminal ways exists a story of sisterhood and an undying need to prove yourself in a ruthless world.\n\nWhile gang life is often seen in several American films, this was one of the most popular films surrounding the topic to come from another country. With Céline Sciamma in the director’s chair, viewers also got to see black women as multifaceted people, who can be tough and loving at the same time.\n\nDope (2015)\n\nDirector: Rick Famuyiwa\n\nStars: Shameik Moore, Tony Revolori, Kiersey Clemons, A$AP Rocky, Zoë Kravitz\n\nDope follows Malcolm, a nerd trying to come up to gain the attention of Zoë Kravitz’ Nakia. But after A$AP Rocky’s character, Dom, secretly places bags of molly in Malcolm’s bookbag before heading off to jail, Malcolm is forced into a rat race as he tries to get rid of it while attempting to get into Harvard University at the same time. Oh, and he has to avoid Dom’s drug-dealing rivals as well. Luckily, he has two friends, Jib and Diggy, who offer their help.\n\nOverall, Dope is one of the freshest films to come out in the past few years. With a heavy ode to ‘90s culture, it became the black millennial coming-of-age story we didn’t know we needed. And spoiler alert, the spoken essay that Malcolm delivers on identity at the end of the film easily rivals The Breakfast Club’s ending.\n\nBlack Dynamite (2009)\n\nDirector: Scott Sanders\n\nStars: Michael Jai White, Salli Richardson, Arsenio Hall, Tommy Davidson, Obba Babatunde, Kevin Chapman, Richard Edson, Brian McKnight, Buddy Lewis, Miguel A. Nunez, Jr., John Salley, Kym Whitley, Mykelti Williamson, Bokeem Woodbine, Cedric Yarbrough, Nicole Sullivan\n\nMichael Jai White made it up to all 13 people who saw the disaster that was the Spawn film with Black Dynamite, another blaxploitation spoof. The film stars White as Vietnam veteran and ex-CIA agent Black Dynamite, the afro-sporting hero who seeks revenge on the mysterious group responsible for his brother Jimmy's death. After discovering that the same organization is supplying orphanages with heroin, Black Dynamite organizes his own team to take the evil faction down. Along the way, he charms activist Gloria Gray (Salli Richardson, who's still strikingly beautiful), winning her over thanks to his stand-up-guy nature. His quest to stop \"The Man\" eventually leads to an epic showdown at the White House with President Nixon.\n\nAside from proving that White (who co-wrote the film) could be funny, Black Dynamite expertly parodied blaxploitation films just as I'm Gonna Git You Sucka did two decades earlier. If Pootie Tang let you down (which it almost certainly did), Black Dynamite provided comedy, action, and a story that, while ridiculous, stays in line with the traditional themes of the genre. For instance, Black Dynamite was shot using Super 16 film, and intentional errors were written into the film as references to the low production qualities seen in blaxploitation films. Additionally, actors would often hilariously recite their stage dialogue before their lines.\n\nThe score was also important to the film's execution. Musical wizard Adrian Younge drew on inspiration from artists ranging from Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield to the Wu-Tang Clan to craft a soundtrack that truly drives the film. Released to critical acclaim, Black Dynamite's success led to the creation of an animated spin-off, which features original cast members White, Minns, Tommy Davidson, and Kym Whitley. Now, it seems that there might be a sequel in the works, too.\n\nGirls Trip (2017)\n\nDirector: Malcolm D. Lee\n\nStars: Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith, Tiffany Haddish, Larenz Tate, Mike Colter, Kofi Siriboe\n\nIn 2016, just 14% of female characters in the top 100 grossing films were black. So when a film about four black women heading to the black woman Mecca, aka Essence Festival, was announced, naturally it was going to be a movement. And when they announced the star-studded cast, Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Regina Hall, and breakout star Tiffany Haddish, things really took off.\n\nWhile 2017’s Girls Trip turned out to be an outrageous comedy that made us never look at a grapefruit the same way again, it was also a heartwarming story about sisterhood, learning to overcome pettiness, and owning up to your own bullshit while not letting anyone else force their bullshit on you. Not to mention, there’s that dope Set It Off reference as Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett-Smith returned to the screen together for the first time since the 1996 movie.\n\nGirls Trip also saw the return of Larenz Tate, who looked like he just stepped out of the Love Jones time machine. Can you say hallelujah?\n\nStraight Outta Compton (2015)\n\nDirector: F. Gary Gray\n\nStars: O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Paul Giamatti\n\nStraight Outta Compton tells the story of ‘80s gangsta rap group, N.W.A., comprised of Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, DJ Yella, and the late Eazy-E (in the film, Arabian Prince only makes a brief appearance). After teaming up and finding their sound, the crew must navigate their newfound success, shady record company people, and of course police brutality, which led to their smash hit single “Fuck The Police.”\n\nBut Straight Outta Compton wasn’t just another biopic. It showed that hip hop stories are more than worthy of being on the big screen. And after grossing $161.2 million in the United States and Canada, it revitalized the hip hop biopic, leading to films like All Eyez On Me, about Tupac, and to conversations on which other acts deserve to have their stories told on the big screen. Also, Ice Cube’s son, O’Shea Jackson Jr., rocked it in his portrayal of his legendary dad.\n\nLove and Basketball (2000)\n\nDirector: Gina Prince-Bythewood\n\nStars: Sanaa Lathan, Omar Epps, Alfre Woodard, Dennis Haysbert, Debbi Morgan, Harry J. Lenix, Kyle Pratt, Boris Kodjoe, Tyra Banks, Regina Hall, Gabrielle Union, Monca Calhoun\n\nSticking to its basketball theme, Love And Basketball is split into four quarters and unfolds like a game. During the first quarter, young Quincy McCall (Omar Epps) and Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan) meet when the latter relocates to Los Angeles during the early 1980s. Their antagonistic relationship quickly becomes a friendship due to their mutual love for the sport, but their careers are on divergent paths. Quincy, the son of a former NBA player, becomes a highly-touted college prospect in high school. Monica, meanwhile, struggles to gain attention as her emotions often get the best of her on the court, scaring college scouts away.\n\nOn prom night, they finally act on their suppressed feelings for one another, leading to a relationship at USC. Once again, Quincy has success from the beginning, while Monica continues to fight for respect and playing time. However, the thin-skinned Quincy is unable to deal with his parents’ dissolving marriage and takes his frustration out on Monica, ending their relationship and prematurely declaring for the NBA draft. During the film's final quarter, Quincy and Monica have gone their separate ways, but are forced to confront their feelings for each other one final time.\n\nQuincy and Monica are both driven by their love for each other, as well as their love of, yes, basketball. They both take the same approach to love as they do to the game, playing freely and with reckless abandon. It's worth noting that life changes for them at the end of the third quarter: Quincy, who's had it relatively easy his whole life, is the one who struggles in the fourth quarter, as Monica becomes the star. It's Quincy's difficulties since their breakup that eventually force him to realize that he needs her.\n\nThough some moments venture into cheesy territory, Love And Basketball is a layered love story that runs the emotional gamut.\n\nBrown Sugar (2002)\n\nDirector: Rick Famuyiwa\n\nStars: Taye Diggs, Sanaa Lathan, Mos Def, Nicole Ari Parker, Boris Kodjoe, Queen Latifah, Wendell Pierce\n\nCan men and women ever truly be platonic friends? This is the eternal question that director Rick Famuyiwa ponders in Brown Sugar. Dre (Taye Diggs) and Sydney (Sanaa Lathan) have been friends since their childhood days in New York, but there have never been any romantic sparks between the two of them. Dre has become a successful A&R, while Sydney has become editor-in-chief at a hip hop magazine; their friendship has never been tested until Dre gets engaged to Reese (Nicole Ari Parker), an attorney who's the antithesis to Sydney and the wrong woman for him.\n\nSuddenly, Sydney realizes that her feelings for Dre may have been stronger than those of pure friendship, even though she's currently being entertained by NBA star Kelby Dawson (Boris Kodjoe). Even though Sydney accepts Kelby's proposal, jealousy between Sydney and Reese reaches a boiling point and, eventually the viewers (and the characters) get what they want: a Dre and Sydney hookup.\n\nBrown Sugar is about choices—specifically, are Dre and Sydney making the right ones, personally and professionally? Both characters are forced to decide whether they're willing to devote their lives to people and situations that are externally attractive, as opposed to following their hearts and doing what's instinctively right. It’s obviously a love story, and Dre and Sydney's mutual love for hip hop is as central to the story as their love for each other. Truth be told, hip hop might as well be the third lead character.\n\nSoul Food (1997)\n\nDirector: George Tillman, Jr.\n\nStars: Vanessa L. Williams, Vivica A. Fox, Nia Long, Michael Beach, Mekhi Phifer, Brandon Hammond, Irma P. Hall, Jeffrey D. Sams, Gina Rivera\n\nSoul Food is all about the importance and strength of family. Set in Chicago, it's the story of an extremely close-knit clan told through the eyes of Ahmad (Brandon Hammond), who enjoys his family's tradition of a large Sunday evening meal at family matriarch Big Mama's (Irma P. Hall) house. Although they’re close, the family still has their issues, which are amplified when Big Mama suffers a stroke and falls into a coma. Without her wisdom, inner turmoil begins to tear the family apart, but Ahmad works to unite them once again in what could be the final opportunity to make Big Mama proud. Despite his youth, Ahmad seems to be the only one who never loses sight of that bigger picture.\n\nThe concept of family is very important to the black community, and Soul Food preaches this to near-perfection, emphasizing the notion that \"it takes a village to raise a child.\" Tillman, Jr.'s film also strikes a nerve with viewers because many of them observe striking resemblances to their own families. Chances are, you will, too.\n\nWhat's Love Got to Do with It? (1993)\n\nDirector: Brian Gibson\n\nStars: Angela Bassett, Laurence Fishburne, Khandi Alexander, Cora Lee Day, Jenifer Lewis, Vanessa Bell Calloway, Chi McBride, Richard T. Jones\n\nInspired by Tina Turner and Kurt Loder's book, I, Tina, What's Love Got to Do With It? tells the legend's life story, from her upbringing in Tennessee to the moment she crossed the threshold to stardom. Born Anna Mae Bullock, Turner (Angela Bassett) realizes her dream to be a professional singer, thanks to the charming Ike Turner (Laurence Fishburne). Their relationship quickly becomes romantic and they wed, rocketing to fame as Ike and Tina Turner.\n\nBut when Ike grows jealous of Tina's place in the spotlight, he takes his anger out on her physically, savagely beating her. As Ike descends deeper into drug use, his behavior worsens, as do the beatings, but Tina puts her best face forward for the public. She fights back, eventually divorcing Ike and winning the right to keep her stage name—essentially, her independence. With the help of producer Roger Davies, she goes on to become the icon she's recognized as today—without Ike.\n\nLoosely based on actual events and sharing the title of one of Turner's biggest solo hits, What's Love Got to Do With It? is powered by the performances of Bassett and Fishburne. The former portrays Turner with the strength that's come to be known as her trademark. Take the limo scene, where Ike and Tina trade blows before she asks Ike, before pouncing on him, \"Is that your best shot?\" Fishburne’s Ike is a possessive man ruined by drug addiction and excess. In the infamous \"Eat the cake\" scene, a stoned Ike mushes cake all over Tina's face, humiliating her in front of a diner full of people, showing no remorse.\n\nBassett and Fishburne, reunited following their appearances in Boyz n the Hood, both earned Academy Award nominations for their performances, and Bassett scored a Golden Globe, all of which were well deserved.\n\nBoomerang (1992)\n\nDirector: Reginald Hudlin\n\nStars: Eddie Murphy, Robin Givens, Halle Berry, David Alan Grier, Martin Lawrence, Bebe Drake, Chris Rock, Eartha Kitt, Grace Jones, John Witherspoon, Lela Rochon, Melvin Van Peebles\n\nKarma is vicious, so watching a womanizing ad man simultaneously meet his match and his comeuppance has to be entertaining, right? Right. In Reginald Hudlin's Boomerang, the arrogant Marcus Graham (Eddie Murphy) beds women with no remorse—until he's introduced to his new boss, Jacqueline (Robin Givens). She's a man-eater who devours Marcus whole and spits out everything except for his heart, which she crushes in the palm of her hand. Because Marcus is essentially following Jacqueline to his demise, he overlooks bubbly art department employee Angela (Halle Berry), but only temporarily.\n\nOnce Jacqueline sees that Marcus' interest has gone elsewhere, she reels him right back in. This leaves Marcus forced to decide between the genuine love he feels for Angela and the lust that Jacqueline uses to manipulate him. To this point, Boomerang revealed a valuable life lesson: sometimes you have to face yourself and see the undesirable characteristics within to become a better person.\n\nMusic played a huge part in Boomerang's success. The soundtrack is objectively amazing, but it's also important to the film. Toni Braxton's \"Love Shoulda Brought You Home\" was ripped right from the script, echoing Angela's frustration with Marcus and his issues with commitment. Hell, her \"Love should've brought your ass home last night!\" line inspired the song. P.M. Dawn's \"I'd Die Without You,\" is sung from Marcus' point of view, struggling as he discovers that Jacqueline has turned the tables on him and that Angela is the one he needs. Plus, Grace Jones appears as an exaggerated version of herself, and her Strangé commercial is essentially a visual depiction of how Yeezus sounds."
