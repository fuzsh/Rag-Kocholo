In addition to black and white and grayscale photographs, monochrome photography can also include other hues of a single color, such as sepia, green, blue, or brown. For Helen Rushton, a professional photographer, “great black and white images fall into two categories: very dramatic with stormy skies and bold compositions and at the other end of the spectrum a calm and minimalist composition”.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the black and white photos?\n\nLeonard Nimoy once said: “Which is probably the reason why I work exclusively in black and white… to highlight that contrast”. Many photographers share the same viewpoint when it comes to black and white photography. All because this type of photography can help remove color distractions, highlight emotions, and emphasize the subject, contrast, shape, patterns, texture, light, and composition. Black and white photography also helps the viewer focus on little details that are not visible in color photographs.\n\nWhen to use black and white photography?\n\nBlack and white photography is best used when there is a contrast between light and shadow. Take pictures at midday, when the shadows are harsh and the contrast is high. Black and white photography also works well if you have clear lines and shapes, textures and details, patterns and repetition in the scene.\n\nRelated Articles"
