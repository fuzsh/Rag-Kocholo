        "text": "Part One: Ambition\n\nNarrator: In 1882, an old woman was living on a hill on the outskirts of Springfield, Illinois. She kept her curtains drawn, never went outside, never received visitors. Neighborhood children pointed up at her window and hurried past, frightened by \"the crazy lady\" in the upstairs room. Forty years before, she had been married in the parlor of this same house to a tall, awkward lawyer, and still wore his ring, inscribed with the words \"Love is eternal.\" Once she had been the most eligible young woman in Springfield, the pampered daughter of Kentucky aristocrats,\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"My wife is as handsome as when she was a girl, and I a poor nobody then, fell in love with her, and what is more, I have never fallen out.\"\n\nNarrator: He had been a dirt farmer's son, determined to make something of himself in law and politics.\n\nVoice of Mary Lincoln (Holly Hunter): \"He is to be President of the United States some day; if I had not thought so I never would have married him, for you can see he is not pretty.\"\n\nNarrator: Their marriage survived sharp differences of personality and temperament, endured the deaths of children.\n\nThey reached the White House as partners. But the Civil War that tore the country apart, divided them as well. In the end, an assassin's bullet plunged Mary Lincoln into grief and madness and made Abraham Lincoln, the obscure prairie politician who had pledged to love her forever, into a legend.\n\nSlate: Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided\n\nVoice of a mother and child: In this temple as in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union the memory... memory of Abraham... Abraham Lincoln is enshrined... enshrined forever.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: If you go to the Lincoln memorial and you look at that figure seated on a throne in this marble temple. I remember going as a child and thinking that's what God looked like.\n\nSlate: Part One: Ambition\n\nNarrator: The story of the 'real' Abraham Lincoln has receded so far into the nation's memory that what remains seems little more than a dream. The man Mary Lincoln knew and loved and mourned has faded into myth.\n\nHe was born February 12, 1809, in a cabin in the Kentucky wilderness, but Lincoln remembered little of his life there, and what he did remember, he didn't care to talk about.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"It is a great piece of folly to attempt to make anything out of my early life. It can be condensed into a single sentence from Gray's Elegy, 'the short and simple annals of the poor.'\"\n\nNarrator: Lincoln's childhood world is mostly gone, except the land around Knob Creek and Sinking Spring Farm and the stories people still tell there.\n\nMilburn Howard Jr., Knob Creek Farm: I have listened to tales about Lincoln my whole life. I listened to my aunts, my dad, everybody was some way or another talked about Lincoln all the time. My grandmother she was born 1885 and got to talk to a gentleman that his parents played with Abraham Lincoln and his sister when they lived here. And he told stories. Different people around here kind of passed them down. They may be twisted one way or another, but they're fairly accurate we think. We can't be gospel because there were not very many records back then.\n\nNarrator: Neighbors remembered very little about Abraham's mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln. Some said she used to sing him mournful Scottish ballads. Lincoln himself once told a friend that she was \"an intellectual woman, sensitive, and somewhat sad.\"\n\nJudy Osbourne, Knob Creek Farm: I don't think we know a lot about Lincoln's mother. I see her as a soft-spoken, reflective person. They claimed she was you know thin, she was tall, dark-haired. Those were descriptions that people that knew her gave. So you, you know, you assume then you get your own picture.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: They all agreed that she was, quote, \"intellectual.\" I don't know what that means in the old recollections. I think it meant that she must have thought about things carefully and talked rather well.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: Her communication with Lincoln would seem to have been at an early age one of telling stories, it's certainly interesting that all of Lincoln's great writings were written to be read aloud. They're all basically oral communication... pieces of poetry, political poetry.\n\nNarrator: Abraham's father, Thomas, could barely read or write. One neighbor remembered him \"as a plain, unpretending, plodding man.\"\n\nYear after year, Abraham watched his father work the fields, tied to the land, at the mercy of the seasons.\n\nMilburn Howard Jr., Knob Creek Farm: It was tough, but it was tough for everybody at the time. You got to understand that there were several families all living on Knob Creek at the same time and they were all more or less equal. They were poor but they were equal. And probably they didn't realize they were poor because that's the way that it was on the frontier.\n\nA boy would have a lot of responsibility then. I would imagine Lincoln would come back in this valley looking for berries, hickory nuts, walnuts, probably herbs, to make some of their medicine with. And ah, maybe swim and try to catch the chipmunks. I mean that's just what boys do. We run the hills. And he was there. I'm sure I stepped in his tracks many a time.\n\nNarrator: The Lincoln cabin stood alongside a wilderness road. Abraham could listen to travelers tell stories of the wider world and see slaves driven South to be sold.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: His mother and father were much opposed to slavery. They belonged to a fundamentalist Baptist group that was anti-slavery, and he undoubtedly got from them a sense that slavery was wrong even before he'd ever seen slaves or knew about slavery. He said later on that \"There's never been a time when I was not anti-slavery.\" And I think that is true.\n\nNarrator: When Abraham was seven and his older sister Sara was nine, the Lincolns packed their few belongings and set out in the dead of winter for Indiana. Thomas Lincoln had always disliked living in a slave state, and had grown weary of disputes over the ownership of his land.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: It was a frontier area, so unsettled that there was no real road to the plot of ground that Thomas Lincoln laid claim to. He had to cut a path in effect for his family to follow.\n\nNarrator: When they reached their wilderness claim, the Lincolns huddled around a fire, their nearest neighbor was more than a mile away. Abraham later remembered his terror of the wild animals prowling the undergrowth, the howling of wolves, and the scream of panthers.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"The clearing away of surplus wood was the great task ahead. I, though very young, was large for my age and had an ax put into my hands at once, and I was almost constantly handling that most useful instrument.\"\n\nNarrator: Life on the frontier was punishing: the ceaseless work, the isolation, and always the threat of sickness and death.\n\nIn 1818, a mysterious illness spread across the Indiana countryside and found its way into the Lincoln home. Nancy Hanks Lincoln was just 34 when she died. Abraham was nine.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: He suffered deeply. This fed in his mind and spirit a kind of fatalism and a dark brooding.\n\nNarrator: He never got over the loss. For the rest of his life, Abraham would struggle with depression.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"She was my angel mother. All that I am, or hope ever to be, I owe to her.\"\n\nNarrator: The same year that Abraham Lincoln's mother died, in 1818, Mary Todd was born, on December 13 in Lexington, Kentucky, surrounded by luxury the young Lincoln could scarcely have imagined.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: The world in which Mary Todd grew up could not have been more different from Abraham Lincoln's. She's living in a mansion with several parlors and a dining room, separate bedrooms, servants quarters, a coach house, a beautiful garden in the back. She's got all the clothes that she needs. And she's got all the material resources that one could have needed to feel herself a lucky young woman.\n\nNarrator: Her father was a wealthy aristocrat, Robert Todd, a descendent of the Todds who had founded Lexington less than 50 years before.\n\nMary Genevieve Murphy, Todd family friend: There was a certain trait about all the Todds -- they were very proud people. And I know they used to say about them, God only had one D in his name, but the Todds had to have two.\n\nNarrator: All that remains of Mary's mother, Eliza Todd, is a letter she wrote to her grandfather. Little more is known about her, except that she began having babies with what was then described as \"becoming regularity.\"\n\nThe Todds had six children. Mary, the fourth, was said to be a lively, free-spirited, impetuous little girl. In 1825, Mary's mother died giving birth to her seventh child. Mary was only six years old and had already shown signs of a high-strung, sensitive nature.\n\nJean Harvey Baker, Biographer: So at six years old, she's motherless. She took this very hard, according to some of the family legends, and, indeed, she was going to take all of the deaths that littered her life's course very, very hard.\n\nNarrator: Only weeks after Mary's mother's death, Robert Todd was looking for a new wife. Six months later, he proposed to Elizabeth Humphreys. The following year he married her, and began having still more children -- nine of them.\n\nJean Harvey Baker, Biographer: Step-mothering, I suppose, is never easy family business, but in the case of Robert Smith Todd's second wife it was a disaster. All of the first Todds hated her. Mary is certainly the most rebellious, and there are some family stories of Mary dressing up in her stepmother's clothes and her stepmother calling her \"Satan's limb.\"\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: There were a lot of children in thathousehold and Mary felt lost. She seemed to have experienced the new mother as hateful and spiteful. Mary became full of rage, she became tantrumy. She couldn't find her place in this household. She was screaming, crying out for attention.\n\nNarrator: Mary yearned for her father's attention most of all. She saw in his marriage a betrayal. In the chaos of an ever-increasing family, the little girl was bereft.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: You have a feeling with Mary that the wounds festered and for a young girl who loved attention, who craved attention and needed support, I think there was a great sense of loss that stayed with her the rest of her life.\n\nNarrator: Mary would one day say that her whole childhood had been \"desolate.\"\n\nAfter Abraham's mother died, Thomas Lincoln seemed unable to care for his two grieving children. Overcome with misery, he went back to Kentucky leaving them behind in the care of a cousin. Six months later, he came home with a new wife, Sara Bush Johnston, recently widowed with three small children of her own.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: She came upon this bedraggled little family in southern Indiana and looked at them and was just appalled. She went to work cleaning 'em up. She civilized the little family that had been really almost disintegrating, created a family where there'd been none before.\n\nNarrator: Abraham flourished under his stepmother's care. Sara herself could not read or write, but she encouraged Abraham to get what education he could find in the Indiana backwoods. All told, Abraham had less than a year's formal schooling.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"There were some schools, so called; but no qualification was ever required of a teacher, beyond readin', writin', and cipherin' to the rule of three.... There was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education.\"\n\nNarrator: But Abraham was ambitious. He taught himself, poring over whatever books and newspapers he could find. His stepmother remembered that he was unusual, he had to understand everything, repeated facts to himself until they were \"fixed in his mind.\"\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: He always regarded himself as quite different from his peers and family, smarter than most of the other people in his environment. There are reports that he could write out documents for what were obviously mostly illiterate neighbors. He would come home from church, and he would stand on a stump and then repeat the minister's sermon but humorously to the delight of all the assembled children. So that you see a kind of a testing, a sort of an opportunity to be special and unique, which after all he was.\n\nNarrator: \"Abe would lay on his stomach by the fire and read out loud to me and Aunt Sarah,\" a cousin recalled. His father would come in and say, \"See here, Abe, your mother can't work with you a botherin her like that,\" but Aunt Sarah always said it didn't bother her none, and she'd tell Abe to go on.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: She was kind, she was gentle, and she played a really, really important role in carrying him through his adolescence. Psychologically, I think, Sarah Bush Johnson saved Lincoln's life.\n\nNarrator: When Sara Lincoln was an old woman, someone asked her about her famous step-son. \"I never gave him a cross word in all my life,\" she said. \"His mind and mine -- what little I had -- seemed to move together in the same channel.\"\n\nIn the year 1828, when Abraham was 19, he got a chance to earn some money helping take a flatboat loaded with cargo down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. He stood six feet, four inches... strong and wiry, all arms and legs. That same year, his sister Sara had died in childbirth. One neighbor remembered he was moody: \"witty, sad, and reflective by turns.\"\n\nHe'd never been to a big city. New Orleans would be like nothing he had ever seen. In New Orleans, Abraham saw for the first time human beings bought and sold. In Lexington, sights like that were nothing new to Mary Todd.\n\nMary Genevieve Murphy, Todd family friend: Mary would see slaves being chained and brought in a gang. And the auction was right there on Cheapside, was right next to the courthouse. So it was just a couple of blocks really from where they lived.\n\nNarrator: For Mary, slaves were a constant presence.\n\nMargaret Washington, Historian: She was raised since her mother died by her Mammy Sally who coddled her, dressed her, and doted on her. Mary Todd was the daughter of a slaveholder, a Whig banker, so she accepted slavery. She just simply thought it was part of life.\n\nNarrator: Heated words about slavery and politics flew back and forth across the Todd dinner table. Robert Todd was a slave owner, but he argued against slavery. Mary took her father's part and made clear that she opposed slavery too.\n\nHenry Clay was a frequent guest. Leader of the Whig party, Speaker of the House longer than any other man, he too deplored slavery. Clay burned with ambition to be President, and at 14, Mary was his fiery supporter.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: Mary felt that as long as she could go to the dinner table and respond in an interesting way to her father's conversations with his male friends, he would look at her, he would pay attention to her. So she developed very early on an undue sense of understanding and interest in politics, which must have made her a pretty interesting little figure.\n\nNarrator: As Mary grew to womanhood, she appeared high-spirited, enjoyed parties and shopping for fashionable clothes.\n\nJean Harvey Baker, Biographer: What we have is an intelligent, well-dressed, somewhat spoiled young girl who was very popular with the boys. On the other hand, we have a young girl who stays in school longer than almost all American women do.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: She learned French, she learned English literature, had a classical kind of education.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: She was always noted for quoting poetry, great pages of classical poetry. She had an impeccable Parisian accent. For young girls in her world, she was way ahead of them. Despite the emotional difficulties, easily getting lost in this huge household, she made something for herself.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"Having just completed my twenty-first year, we left the old homestead in Indiana and came to Illinois. Our mode of conveyance was wagons drawn by ox-teams, and I drove one of the teams....\"\n\n\"We settled a new place and built a log cabin, fenced and broke the ground, and raised a crop of sown corn upon it the same year. In the autumn all hands were greatly afflicted with ague and fever.... We remained, through the succeeding winter, which was the winter of the 'deep snow.'\"\n\nNarrator: Another difficult move to a new homestead, another grueling round of seasons -- this was not the life Abraham Lincoln imagined for himself.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: Lincoln spent most of his early life trying to get beyond his humble origins. He seemed to have to position himself as better than, as separate from, and really not identified with in any way what his father represented -- the kind of ignorant past out of which he had come.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He simply did not like the life that his father lived. Whatever happened, he was not going to be like his father. He was going to do something to make a name for himself.\n\nDouglas L. Wilson, Biographer: He had a sense of himself as being different from other people from the beginning. He doesn't like farm work. He doesn't make any bone about it. He wanted recognition. He aspires for something more.\n\nNarrator: At 22, Lincoln left home for good -- and rarely saw his father again. He never looked back.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"I was a friendless, uneducated, penniless boy... a piece of floating driftwood.\"\n\nNarrator: Lincoln eventually came to rest at New Salem in central Illinois, population 100, the biggest town he had ever lived in.\n\nDouglas L. Wilson, Biographer: He was a gawky fellow, ill-dressed, funny-looking, a rube they thought. He was rough-looking in a rough-looking crowd.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He simply looked like nothing they had ever seen.\n\nDouglas L. Wilson, Biographer: A real hayseed. But, as soon as he started talking you were aware that he was very literate, he was well informed. To them he sounded educated.\n\nNarrator: He went to work in a general store and gristmill, but that was only meant to be a stepping-stone. Just eight months after he got to town, he was running for the state legislature.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"March 9, 1832 -- To the people of Sangamon County.\n\n\"I am young, and unknown to many of you. I was born, and have ever remained, in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy or popular relations to recommend me. If elected I shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate. But, if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background, I have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined.\"\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: What was remarkable was that having just arrived in a community where he hadn't really established himself, he should think of himself as a state legislator. It tells something about a driving ambition that this young man had at an early age.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: Politics was his way of breaking out of that life that he didn't want to lead. It was the road for a young man to become something in life that other people would respect and understand. Politics was the world that was available to him. Other worlds weren't quite as easily available. That one was right within his reach.\n\nNarrator: In 1832, Illinois politics was wide open, and Lincoln thought his chances were as good as any man's even though he had no education to speak and was just 23. He campaigned for \"the improvement of the Sangamon river.\" He believed government should promote economic progress. If steamboats could reach New Salem, Lincoln argued, the little settlement could become a thriving port.\n\nHe never stood much of a chance. Running against older, better-known men, Lincoln lost. But almost all his New Salem neighbors voted for him. He won 277 of their 300 votes. Most people, who got to know Abraham Lincoln, liked him.\n\nVoice of Mary Lincoln (Holly Hunter): \"My ever dear Merce... we expect a very gay winter, evening before last my sister gave a most agreeable party, upwards of a hundred graced the festive scene.\"\n\nNarrator: When she was 20, Mary Todd left behind the stepmother she so disliked and moved to the growing city of Springfield, Illinois. She moved into the hilltop home of her sister, who had married the son of the former governor. She was so charming, so flirtatious, her brother-in-law said, \"she could make a bishop forget his prayers.\"\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: She was amusing and funny. She could quote from Shakespeare. She could quote from the poets, and she was steeped in politics.\n\nMary Genevieve Murphy, Todd family friend: In fact I think she intimidated some of the young men. She was so much smarter than most of them.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: She didn't think she was pretty or attractive. She really wasn't. She was aware of her physical shortcomings, but she was attractive enough and young enough and sprightly and intelligent to be quite a sought after young woman.\n\nNarrator: \"She was a girl of much vivacity and conversation,\" one friend remembered, \"but was subject to spells of mental depression. She was either in the garret or in the cellar.\"\n\nAt 23, Abraham Lincoln had lost his first election, but New Salem offered other possibilities. On the frontier, a man could try his hand at things, change his mind, scramble for a living.\n\nJudge Frank J. Williams, Chair, the Lincoln Forum: New Salem was Lincoln's college campus. There was a village poet, two doctors, a debating society, small industry. He was able to serve in a variety of professions:\n\nNarrator: Blacksmith, postmaster, surveyor, store-owner. He tried them all. And he became everyone's friend. He could beat anyone at weight lifting, wrestling, horseshoes.\n\nJudge Frank J. Williams, Chair, the Lincoln Forum: And he loved to tell funny stories. And he called himself a retail dealer because he would take the funny stories from other people, from the humorists whose works he read, but he would tell them in such a way that he would have everyone else guffawing.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: He just loved to tell jokes. I mean he brought stories, he was a great storyteller. He was a Paul Bunyanesque kind of figure. And it was an absolutely essential part of his character.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: You always have the feeling that Lincoln, without being in motion, was not a very attractive sort of fellow, that he was the homely person that people described him as, but the moment he started talking, the moment that voice attached to his heart and to his mind, he became something entirely different. His whole body would convulse with laughter, his gray eyes lit like a lantern. The people in that town grow to respect him. They see him as something more than the shuffling, penniless, gangly character that he appeared when he first walked on the streets.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: It's hard to imagine that one wouldn't be attracted to the young Lincoln.\n\nNarrator: Two years after his first try, he ran for state office again.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"My politics are short and sweet, like the old woman's dance.\"\n\nNarrator: This time, he won. From that moment on, politics would be his life. He was perfectly suited for it -- he spoke plainly and had a knack for making friends. He was a member of the Whig party now and was soon matching wits at the Illinois State Capital with the other law-makers, making speeches... and back room deals. But to pay the bills, he set out to become a lawyer in the same way he had got most of his schooling -- on his own.\n\nHe was a man of practical ambition, but he loved poetry, and spent hours brooding on lines from Shakespeare's tragedies:\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse):\n\n\"Come, sealing night,\n\nScarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,\n\nAnd with thy bloody and invisible hand,\n\nCancel and tear to pieces that great bond\n\nWhich keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow\n\nMakes wing to the rooky wood.\"\n\nNarrator: Lincoln would later write that he pondered the meaning of life with such \"intensity of thought\" that he wore ideas \"thread bare\" and turned them \"to the bitterness of death.\"\n\nAs Lincoln's neighbors remembered it, the rains never seemed to stop in the summer of 1835, the summer Abraham fell in love. He was already 26, shy, awkward around women. Her name was Ann Rutledge, the 22-year-old daughter of the New Salem innkeeper.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: Abraham Lincoln had difficulties in his relationship with women. He liked Ann Rutledge perhaps the more because he knew she was engaged to another man. This meant that there was no danger in approaching her because she belonged to somebody else.\n\nNarrator: The details have long since been forgotten, but as time went by, Lincoln and Anne seemed to be drawing closer together. Then, Anne became sick with what neighbors described as \"brain fever\" -- probably typhoid. It was said that she called Lincoln to her bedside. A few days later, she died.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: He responded to the loss of what seems to have been his first love with great despair, because it had to have evoked the sudden and tragic loss of his mother. And he was adrift. He was really adrift.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: He went into a sustained period of melancholia, seemed even emotionally unbalanced by the loss, unable to function for a long period of time.\n\nNarrator: His friends feared that he would never recover, that he might even kill himself. They were astonished to find the tough young man from the backwoods so tender-hearted, so undone by the loss.\n\nDouglas L. Wilson, Biographer: He was strong, he was resilient, he could take on anybody. He wasn't afraid of anything, but he discovered something that really had the power to knock him for a loop. He had to cope with this vulnerability that he didn't even know he had.\n\nNarrator: He told one friend he could not bear the idea of rain falling on Anne's grave.\n\nWhen he was 28, Lincoln packed everything he owned into two saddlebags, borrowed a horse, and said goodbye forever to New Salem, the town that had given him his start. He was headed to the new Illinois state capital at Springfield. He had twice won re-election, become a Whig party leader, and had finally become a lawyer. He was, one friend remembered, \"a rising man.\"\n\nBy the time she was 21, Mary Todd was one of the most popular young women in Springfield, courted by eager politicians and bright young lawyers, but she wanted more. She told her sister that she planned one day to be the \"wife of a President.\" One evening at a party at her sister's house, Mary noticed a man, who said, \"he wanted to dance with her in the worst way.\"\n\n\"And,\" she added, \"he certainly did.\"\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He is still somewhat uncouth, rather awkward, and ugly young man. But one who is ready to be accepted into the best social circles of the state capital.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: He sees her first dancing with a whole bunch of beaux surrounding her. She's sensual, she's talking, really the center of attention, and here he is, still the gangly character, unsophisticated about women, unsure about women, awkward around women. She's five feet tall. He's six-feet-four, a most unlikely physical couple.\n\nDouglas L. Wilson, Biographer: She was a gentle lady, and he was just one step up from a rube. She had position in society, and he didn't -- he was still a wannabe.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: Some even thought maybe he was courting her for financial advancement. But they had politics in common from the very beginning, and it got them over many a rough spot.\n\nNarrator: In 1840, the Whigs nominated for President a Virginia aristocrat whose supporters liked to claim he lived in a log cabin -- William Henry Harrison. Lincoln stumped Illinois for him and again ran for the legislature, while Mary cheered them both on.\n\nVoice of Mary Lincoln (Holly Hunter): \"I've become quite a politician, a rather unladylike profession, yet at such a crisis, whose heart could remain untouched.\"\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: She loved politics for its own sake. Because Mary liked a challenge and she liked excitement. I don't think he could find too many young women who were willing to talk about politics.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: It's no accident that she fell in love with Abraham Lincoln. She sensed both his ambitions and his capacity to realize those ambitions of which she would be a part.\n\nNarrator: When the campaign was over, Lincoln had won, and so had his log cabin candidate William Henry Harrison.\n\nBy then, Lincoln's friendship with Mary Todd had ripened into something more. Lincoln, Mary's sister wrote, \"would listen and gaze on Mary as if drawn by some superior power.\" He called her Molly, she called him Mr. Lincoln.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: They shared a love of poetry. One can imagine them reading poetry aloud to one another and really loving it. Not just reading it, but it touching some part of their heart. They shared a certain melancholy. They both had these emotional moods, these blackened periods. They shared a sense of loss in their mothers having died when they were young. She somehow saw the depths of this man. She saw inside of Lincoln.\n\nNarrator: Not long after Election Day, Lincoln asked Mary to marry him, and she agreed. Then, just a few weeks later, he abruptly told her he had changed his mind. He wrote a friend that the thought of marriage was \"indescribably horrible and alarming.\"\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: He was a very confused young man struggling for love and intimacy. This is not a man who easily established intimate relationships.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He did not know how to make close bonds with really anybody. He never told his private thoughts.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: He's terrified of getting married. His insecurity with women, his concern about intimacy, all made him, I think, just shy away from this commitment. There must have been a feeling that if he did give himself over to a woman again, as he had to his mother, as he had to Ann Rutledge, that perhaps the only result of that would be the loss of this woman that he loved.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln again fell into a black depression. He spent days locked in his room, unable to move, unable to sleep.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"I am now the most miserable man living. If what I feel were equally distributed to the whole human family, there would not be one cheerful face on the earth. Whether I shall ever be better I cannot tell, I awfully forebode I shall not. To remain as I am is impossible; I must die or be better.\"\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: They took the razors out of his room because they were afraid he was going to commit suicide. And he was in utter despair, utter and total despair.\n\nNarrator: Mary eventually re-appeared in Springfield society. Lincoln did his best to avoid her.\n\nVoice of Mary Lincoln (Holly Hunter): \"He deems me unworthy of notice. I would that the case were different, that he would once more resume his station in society, that he should be himself again.\"\n\nNarrator: Despite Lincoln's rejection, Mary waited.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: There's absolutely no indication that he asked her to wait for him. On the contrary, there's every indication that he was not in touch with her at all and she waited through all of 1841 and half of 1842. She waited for an entire year-and-half for him to wrestle his demons to the ground before he would come back to her.\n\nNarrator: On November 4, 1842, to everyone's surprise, Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd stood side by side and exchanged vows. They were beginning a marriage which would be, at times, even more turbulent than their courtship.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"Nothing new here except my marrying, which to me is a matter of profound wonder.\"\n\nPart Two: We Are Elected\n\nNarrator: The only house the Lincolns ever owned stood on the corner of Eighth and Jackson streets in downtown Springfield. Lincoln scraped together $1,200 to buy it in 1844. Here Abraham and Mary would live for the next 17 years, share the everyday routines of married life, raise a family.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: He moved quickly from living literally in log cabins to living in a house which by any standards represents the upper middle class of mid-19th Century America. This is a guy who, once he left the prairie and once he got out of New Salem, he never went back.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: Abraham Lincoln was certainly unschooled in the social niceties. Sometimes his shirts didn't match or his trousers were too short, and she groomed him in terms of his appearance with one thing in mind that he should physically live up in his appearance to the greatness of his mind.\n\nNarrator: Nine months after their wedding, their first child, Robert Todd Lincoln, was born. A second son, Edward, came three years later. Lincoln now took to calling Mary \"Mother.\"\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: He was a father, which was very important to him. He found love and affection with Mary. He adored her. How can one minimize the significance of finding love and affection from somebody? And to be able to love somebody, as well as be loved in return.\n\nDouglas L. Wilson, Biographer: He became a different man after his marriage. He didn't have to worry about his place in society. He didn't have to worry about courtship. He didn't have to worry about getting along with women. He could concentrate on the things that he did best, which was the man's world of politics.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln continued to build his reputation as a politician, while his work as a lawyer spread his name across the state. He rode the circuit from county courthouse to county courthouse, getting to know voters all across Illinois, and picking up clients wherever he could find them.\n\nJudge Frank J. Williams, Chair, the Lincoln Forum: He liked to get out among the people. And he liked the art form of being a trial lawyer, of getting into a county seat the night before the case was to be heard, meeting with clients, one or two law books, very few pieces of stationery and ink, and doing up a case very quickly and effectively. In fact, he became so good at being a lawyer that he was referred cases by lawyers who lived in these county seats.\n\nYou'd go to the tavern the night before the case was to be heard. There's maybe a fire going in the fireplace. The food was dismal. You had four or five lawyers to a bed, three beds to a room. There was a camaraderie. This was a very male oriented culture, and Lincoln loved that. At night, he would swap stories with the other lawyers while the townspeople looked on laughing. No one made them laugh harder than Lincoln.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: His favorite jokes were ones, which made him look bad or foolish, or jokes about his ugliness, jokes about his height.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He might say, \"Well, I guess you wonder why I'm here, and I sometime wonder myself why I'm here, and I'm reminded of the day back in Indiana when I was out chopping wood in the forest and a woman came by on a horse, and she stopped and she looked at me and said, 'My, you're the ugliest man I ever saw.' And I said to her, 'Well, ma'am, there isn't a lot I can do about it.' And she said, 'Well, you could have stayed at home.' \"\n\nDouglas L. Wilson, Biographer: He liked to make people laugh and apparently he always laughed as loud as anybody. In spite of the fact that he was the funniest storyteller around, he was also a very gloomy man.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln told stories, a friend said, \"to whistle away the sadness.\" He was often withdrawn, given to spells of depression, which he called \"the hypo.\"\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: Depression separates you from other people in profound ways. It is lonely, and it's isolating, and Lincoln's use of humor was an effective way to fight that, to fend it off. It was a deeply human kind of humor that connected with people, that deepened the bonds in whatever audience he found himself. And for him it was vital to whistle off sadness because it helped keep the depression at bay.\n\nNarrator: While Lincoln rode the circuit, Mary stayed home with the children -- where she found it hard going without her husband. She was haunted by fears of burglars, dogs, lightning storms. She suffered from blinding headaches, migraines that sent her to bed for days.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: Whenever Lincoln left Mary, she experienced it as abandonment, pure and simple. She desperately yearned for him to be more available than he was. Now for the most part in the early years of their relationship, he did seem to meet most of those needs in her.\n\nNarrator: When he could, Lincoln tried to calm her, running home from his law office during the lightning storms that so disturbed her.\n\nBut he was incapable of giving her everything she needed. He \"was not a demonstrative man,\" she once said. \"When he felt most deeply, he expressed the least.\"\n\nMark E. Neely Jr., Historian: Everybody liked him, no one was particularly close to him. So that his law partner, who sat in the law office with him every day for 16 years, when it was all said and done and asked about it, said Lincoln was the most shut-mouthed man I ever knew.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: And Mary blurted everything out. She blurted it out in letters to her friends. She talked and talked and talked.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: I think Mary desperately yearned to have him there every moment. And yet in her own confusions when he was there she would often get incredibly frustrated with his withdrawal.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln never lost sight of his political career, and in 1844, when a group of Whigs invited him to speak in Indiana, he accepted. But this would be more than a political journey. It would be a journey back into his past. Lincoln's boyhood home was not very far from Springfield, but he had never gone back, as if he were afraid to revisit the scene of his mother's death. Now 35 years old -- lawyer, legislator, husband, and father -- he felt he was ready. Lincoln never pretended to be a poet, but flooded by painful memories, he tried to turn his feelings into verse.\n\nVoice of Abraham Lincoln (David Morse):\n\nNear 20 years have passed away\n\nSince here I bid farewell\n\nTo woods and fields, and scenes of play,\n\nAnd playmates loved so well.\n\nThe friends I left that parting day,\n\nHow changed, as time has sped!\n\nYoung childhood grown, strong manhood gray,\n\nAnd half of all are dead.\n\nI range the fields with pensive tread,\n\nAnd pace the hollow rooms,\n\nAnd feel (companion of the dead)\n\nI'm living in the tombs.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln was discovering that language could help him confront his darkest nightmares. All his life, he would wrestle with words, struggling first to give expression to his own feelings and then to those of his fellow countrymen.\n\nVoice of Abraham Lincoln (David Morse): \"Now if you should hear anyone say that Lincoln don't want to go to Congress, I wish you would tell him you have reason to believe he is mistaken. The truth is, I would like to go very much.\"\n\nNarrator: In 1846, Lincoln ran for Congress and was elected as a Whig to the House of Representatives. At last, he had arrived. Sometime that year, the new Congressman and his wife proudly sat for their first photographs. Lincoln was 37, Mary 28.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He is dressed up to have his picture taken because he is a man of importance. And yet you look at him and you still say, \"This is a pretty rough character. I'm not sure how far he can go.\"\n\nBut you take a look at those eyes and you say, \"Ah, he thinks he's going somewhere, and he's really very pleased with himself.\" His hair is slicked down on his head. It would never stay there more than five minutes, but just long enough for this photograph.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: You have the feeling that Mary had a brush with her right before this picture was taken and she pushed it down so far that it doesn't even look like him.\n\nShe looks very well put together. She looks stylish. There's an affectionate look on her face. There is a sensual quality to the way she's looking out at the world. She's dressed perfectly, in silk, in lace. This is a woman who's established herself.\n\nYou get the feeling that they've come somewhere together. He's been elected to the Congress. He was moving on to national politics, and \"Beware World. We're coming!\"\n\nNarrator: In 1847, Congressman Elect Abraham Lincoln, his wife Mary, and their sons, Robert and Eddy, arrived in the nation's capital. The city was alive with excitements to dazzle a provincial couple: lectures and plays, concerts by the Marine Band.\n\nWith its 50,000 people -- more than 3,000 of them slaves -- Washington was the largest city either of them had ever lived in. All four Lincolns moved into a single large room in a crowded boarding house, and Lincoln began his career as a Congressman.\n\nJudge Frank J. Williams, Chair, the Lincoln Forum: If you look at the Congressional Directory that he filled out himself, during his only term in Congress they have a section that says \"education.\" And he wrote in \"defective.\"\n\nNarrator: But Lincoln was in his element: delighting in cloakroom politics, learning how Washington worked, sending home more than 7,500 copies of his speeches, carefully addressing every envelope by hand.\n\n\"Politics were his life,\" his law partner remembered, \"newspapers his food, and his great ambition his motive power.... He delighted in politics, he reveled in it, as a fish does in water, as a bird disports itself on the sustaining air.\"\n\nBut while Lincoln flourished, Mary found only disappointment. She had come to Washington, a friend said, hoping \"to loom largely,\" but with her husband away all day, she was left alone with two small, restless, noisy boys.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: Most wives just stayed at home, especially for first term congressman before you were sure how things were going to turn out. But Mary was determined to come along and they ended up in a boarding house with a lot of other crusty old politicians. And it was a very difficult time for her. She realized nobody was going to make a fuss over her husband, and what was she going to do with these two children, one was barely an infant.\n\nNarrator: Confined to a boarding house, with nowhere to entertain and nothing to do, Mary consoled herself by shopping, sometimes spending too much.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: She had this habit of living beyond her means, of spending rather recklessly and of having a very slippery regard for debts. And she was keeping it from her husband.\n\nNarrator: After just three months, she packed her bags, took the boys, and went back to her family home in Kentucky.\n\nWith Mary gone, Lincoln lost himself in national politics. But no one in Washington paid any attention to his speeches or his proposals. He was frustrated and lonely.\n\nVoice of Abraham Lincoln (David Morse): \"Dear Mary, In this troublesome world, we are never quite satisfied. When you were here, I thought you hindered me some in attending to business; but now, having nothing but business.... It has grown exceedingly tasteless to me. I hate to stay in this old room by myself.\"\n\nVoice of Mary Lincoln (Holly Hunter): \"My dear Husband, I feel wearied and tired enough to know that this is Saturday night, our babies are asleep.... How much I wish instead of writing we were together this evening, I feel very sad away from you.\"\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"What did Bobby and Eddy think of the little letters father sent them? Don't let the blessed fellows forget father.\"\n\nVoice of Mary Lincoln (Holly Hunter): \"Do not fear the children have forgotten you, I was only jesting -- even Eddy's eyes brighten at the mention of your name.\"\n\nVoice of Abraham Lincoln (David Morse): \"My dear Wife, Last Wednesday, P.H. Hood & Co. dunned me for a little bill of $5.38 cents and Walter Harper and Co. another for $8.50 ...for goods which they say you bought. I hesitated to pay them because my recollection is that you told me...there was nothing left unpaid.... Kiss and love the dear rascals. Affectionately, A. Lincoln\"\n\nNarrator: In the fall of 1848, Lincoln set out for New England to help whip up support for the Whig candidate for President General Zachary Taylor. Mary and the boys came along, too. They toured Massachusetts and New York, then set out to see Niagara Falls. There Lincoln, still experimenting with words, tried to describe his feelings:\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"Niagara is strong, and fresh today as ten thousand years ago. The Mammoth and mastodon -- now so long dead, that fragments of their monstrous bones alone testify that they ever lived, have gazed on Niagara.\"\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: Lincoln attempted a rhapsody on Niagara Falls, all about this torrential water and the turbulence and the excitement, what is all portended.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): In that long, long, time, never still for a single moment. Never dried, never froze, never slept, never rested....\"\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He broke off in the middle of it. This was clearly not his thing.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln never finished his meditation. He was still learning how to write, still falling short of the mark, still searching for his own voice.\n\nZachary Taylor was elected President on Nov. 7. Four months later took the oath of office. Lincoln went to the Inaugural Ball, but his own term in Congress had expired the day before.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: Lincoln's one term in Congress was a learning experience. That's about all you can say for it. He had no concrete accomplishments. He thought pretty much that his political career was dead. Lincoln had promised to serve only one term. Illinois was overwhelmingly Democratic, and the chance to run for the State's only Whig Congressional seat now went to another Whig.\n\nSo what political future could an obscure Illinois ex-Congressmen have? He was depressed, and he went home essentially defeated and largely withdrawing from politics for the next few years.\n\nNarrator: The Lincolns had been home just nine months when they were struck a devastating blow. Three-year-old Eddy Lincoln became dangerously ill with tuberculosis. For 52 days and nights, his parents took turns sitting by his bedside. On February 1, 1850, Eddy died. Mary collapsed. Her father had died the previous summer, followed a few months later by her beloved grandmother.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: It took everything out of her. And for the first time you began to see the side of her nature that refused to be comforted, that refused to accept.\n\nNarrator: Mary stopped eating. Lincoln, even as he grieved, reached out to comfort her.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"Eat, Mary, for we must live.\"\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: It's as though Mary's despair is so total and so complete that it swallows up the capacity for him to grieve as well. What you see with Lincoln is not a disappearance of depression, but you find that he's able to control the depths to which he sinks.\n\nNarrator: Ten months after Eddy's death William Wallace Lincoln was born, \"Willy,\" who was to become his mother and father's favorite and seemed an almost miraculous replacement for the boy they had lost. Thomas, their fourth son, was born in 1853. His father nicknamed him Tad because his large head and small body reminded him of a Tadpole.\n\nLincoln was now more deeply involved in the law then he had ever been, arguing before the Illinois Supreme Court and earning the largest fees of his life as attorney for the Illinois Central Railroad. But he continued to keep up with the old, unresolved issue that had now begun to consume the country. Slavery, which had divided America since its beginning, was threatening to tear it apart. Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law that gave slave owners the right to recapture run-away slaves. Abolitionists vowed to defy it. As African Americans were hunted down in the North, anti-slavery sentiment grew. Lincoln's law partner William Herndon, an ardent abolitionist, remembered constantly urging Lincoln to speak out against slavery. But Lincoln believed above all in what he called \"reason -- cold, calculating, unimpassioned -- reason.\"\n\n\"Billy,\" Lincoln said, \"you're too rampant and spontaneous.\"\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He hoped that slavery would be ended. He believed it would be ended in time, but he felt that you couldn't just say, \"Let it be done,\" and have slavery ended. There was nothing anybody could do about it except to say, as Lincoln himself had said, that \"We deplore the institution.\"\n\nNarrator: As the country seethed, Lincoln continued quietly to practice the law.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: His legal career is flourishing. He's doing very well. He's getting more respected. He's making money. He's happy that that's happening but not really passionately fulfilled by that because his desires are elsewhere, and they're not being met by legal success.\n\nNarrator: Mary Lincoln was unhappy too. Her behavior since Eddy's death had become increasingly erratic. She fired servant after servant, lashed out at neighbors and at her husband. Lincoln was often away now, sometimes half the year riding the circuit. Even when he was home, he could remain distant and withdrawn. The political dreams the Lincolns had always shared seemed to be going nowhere. Once, when he was reading his newspaper in front of the fire, and paid no attention when Mary twice asked him to bring in more logs, she hurled a chunk of wood at his head.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: There are clearly developing signs of Mary's fragility. She wants him to be involved in her life, to care, to attend to her, to listen to her. And her frustration leads to rage.\n\nNarrator: Friends noticed that Lincoln now seemed even more tinged by sadness than usual. His marriage was troubled, and his political career at a standstill. His law partner remembered \"melancholy dripped from him as he walked.\"\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: He's a man with great aspirations, but nothing to show for it yet. It was incredibly frustrating for somebody who dreamed of greatness to be a nothing in the public realm.\n\nNarrator: Then, the Democratic Senator from Illinois, Stephen A. Douglas, the man they called the \"Little Giant,\" changed everything.\n\nUntil 1854, despite the fiery disagreements over slavery, there was still a fragile balance of power between North and South.\n\nBut on January 23rd of that year, Douglas introduced the Kansas-Nebraska Act in Congress based on what he called \"popular sovereignty.\" The bill would leave it to the people of the territories of Kansas and Nebraska to decide for themselves whether they wanted slavery.\n\nThe South's \"peculiar\" institution now threatened to spread. With one stroke, Douglas had thrown the country into turmoil.\n\nLincoln was arguing a case on the circuit when news reached him that the bill had passed. It roused him, he said, \"as he had never been before.\" He believed that under the constitution no one had the right to interfere with slavery where it already existed, but it must not be allowed to expand further.\n\nDonald Miller, Historian: It was the Kansas-Nebraska Act that brought him back on the scene and really got his blood up. The South kept saying slavery is a positive good and as a positive good it ought to have a right to spread anywhere. Lincoln was saying it's not a positive good, it's something that needs to be blocked up, something that needs to be stopped.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He did not favor abolition. He did not call on the Southern states to end slavery, but he said slavery was a morally reprehensible institution \"which we can not endorse.\" For the first time he's able now to connect a major public issue and a large moral question. There's a new tone in his speeches. There is a tone of high moral outrage.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"This covert zeal for the spread of slavery I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world; and especially because it forces so many good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty, criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle but self-interest.\"\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: He spoke out logically, he spoke out morally, he spoke out emotionally, and he found his voice. And I think once you make a stand like that something changes inside of you. It gives you the strength and the fervor to keep going.\n\nNarrator: In 1855, Lincoln, now 46, ran for the Senate and lost. The following year a new party was formed -- the Republican Party -- a party committed to stopping the expansion of slavery.\n\nLincoln had to choose: either the unproven Republicans or his own Whig party, now split over slavery like the country itself.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: Lincoln faced a political dilemma. \"You can't do anything in American politics,\" he once said, \"unless you're a member of a political party.\" But what party was he going to be a member of? You can so easily cut off your political future if you join a party that's going to die within a year. If it didn't work, you would be lost. And yet in the long run the Republican party was the only place that he felt he could go, and it represented principles that he favored.\n\nNarrator: That summer when the Republicans nominated the explorer John C. Freemont for President, the party had an energetic new member. Lincoln campaigned tirelessly for the Republican ticket, stumping the state, making over 50 speeches. Freemont lost, but Lincoln's hard work had paid off. The former Whig had won a loyal following and made himself one of the most prominent Republicans in the state of Illinois. By 1856, Lincoln had earned enough money to add a second story to their home. His law practice was booming.\n\n47 years old, he now had a new party, a cause he believed in, and three boisterous boys. The Lincolns couldn't resist spoiling them, giving them the run of the house. Mary Lincoln seemed more relaxed. As the wife of a successful lawyer and a rising political star, she was enjoying the attention that now came her way.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: She was a wonderful hostess. She was also a great sounding board. And when he would come home at the end of the day, they would talk politics. He would ask her opinion about this issue or that issue or this personality or that, and she would give it. Because she was his wife, she could be straight with him. She could be honest with him.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: They worked as a team politically. I think it's important to realize that in Lincoln's political activities Mary was, if often unseen, a very stalwart supporter. She wrote letters for him. She gave parties for his political friends. She did the very best that she could to support him.\n\nNarrator: Quietly, Lincoln was working behind the scenes, waiting for his chance to run again for the Senate, this time for the seat held by Stephen Douglas himself. His chance came in 1858. On June 16, in the Capital Building at Springfield, he accepted his party's nomination in a address he delivered by heart. It was the most important speech he had ever made.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the union to be dissolved -- I do not expect the house to fall -- but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"\n\nNarrator: Lincoln challenged Senator Douglas to a series of debates. Douglas reluctantly accepted. The two men were renewing an old political rivalry. Lincoln had known Douglas for 20 years, and had never liked him.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He disliked Steven A. Douglas because Douglas was politically successful, and he wasn't. Douglas got everything he wanted. He was elected to everything -- to judge, to Congress, to senator -- and look at Lincoln's record -- one term in Congress -- he probably couldn't have won if he tried again, defeated for the Senate in 1855. Everything he wanted was always dashed from him just as he was putting the cup to his lips.\n\nNarrator: It was a long, grueling campaign. Lincoln and Douglas each traveled more than 4 thousand miles, delivering scores of speeches, often for two or three hours, in a contest that captured the attention of the country. Lincoln traveled by regular passenger train, mingling with the voters. Douglas outfitted his own train, with a canon trailing behind on a flatcar to pull in the crowds.\n\nThe 6'4\" Lincoln and the 5'4\" Douglas faced each other seven times. Lincoln was taking on one of the most powerful men in the Senate and one of the most skillful debaters in the country. Their arguments over slavery would define the issue for the whole nation.\n\n\"Why can't the country endure half slave and half free?\" Douglas asked. \"It had, for 82 years, after all.\"\n\n\"I go for the principle of the Kansas-Nebraska Act,\" he argued \"the right of the people to decide for themselves....\"\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: It would not do to minimize Douglas' very significant point.This is a free country, and if the people of Kansas, Nebraska, or other states choose to adopt the institution of slavery, that is their business. \"We should not interfere and impose our moral standards.\"\n\nNarrator: Lincoln countered that Douglas' reliance on majority rule was morally bankrupt.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"It's as thin as a soup made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death.\"\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: Lincoln takes Douglas' argument that says that what the people in the territories decide is up to them. It's a democracy. If they vote for slavery, so be it. That's majority rule. And he says, \"No. There's an independent standard of right and wrong that's more important than the majority vote. Slavery is wrong.\"\n\nHe believed so much that what the American system was all about was making it possible for other men to rise as he had done. But slavery was completely against that. A person worked hard, they labored, and yet the fruits of their labor belonged to somebody else.\n\nNarrator: Douglas tried to trap Lincoln by charging him with coddling the black man.\n\n\"Are you in favor of conferring upon the Negro the rights and privileges of citizenship?\" he asked Lincoln. \"I am opposed to Negro citizenship in any and every form. I believe this government was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity for ever.\"\n\nLincoln's response was clear.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together on the footing of perfect equality. He is not my equal in many respects, certainly not in color, perhaps not in intellectual or moral endowment. But in the right to eat the bread... which his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas and the equal of every other man.\"\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: He was deeply ambivalent about the idea of racial equality in America. He says over and over and over again he does not believe the races are equal. He made a clear distinction, 'I hate slavery, on the other hand, I cannot... I don't know what to do about ending slavery because I can't imagine that black and white can live together as equals in America.'\n\nMargaret Washington, Historian: The racial attitudes of 19th Century America among white people were essentially that African Americans were an inferior people. This was an attitude that had been handed down since the nation evolved. There had always been this sense of African American inferiority because of the color of their skin, because they came from a foreign land that was considered a land of barbarism. Because many people in the Northern and Western states listened to Southerners who said that African-Americans would not work unless they were enslaved -- that they were lazy, that they were shiftless, that the plantation system was a school for them, to civilize them. So all of these kinds of stereotypes, Lincoln heard and unfortunately Lincoln believed.\n\nNarrator: In the middle of October, Lincoln took a steamboat down the Mississippi and met Douglas for the seventh debate at Alton, Illinois.\n\nFor the last time, Douglas would argue that in a democracy, the majority rules, and once again, Lincoln would do his best to refute him.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"The real issue is the sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong and another class that does not.\"\n\n\"That is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent. It is the eternal struggle between these two principles -- right and wrong -- throughout the world. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time, and will ever continue to struggle. \"\n\nNarrator: It rained as Illinois voters went to the polls on November 2. The \"fizzle-gigs\" and \"fireworks,\" as Lincoln called them, were finally over. The outcome would be decided by the State Legislators, meeting in the Capital building where Lincoln had accepted his party's nomination. The results were as close as they could be: Lincoln's Republicans polled 4,000 more voters, but Douglas' Democrats controlled the legislature. For the third time in his political career, Lincoln lost.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"I feel just like the boy who stubbed his toe: I'm too big to cry, and too badly hurt to laugh.\"\n\nNarrator: Still, he was glad he had made the race.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"It gave me a hearing on the great and durable question of the age, which I could have had in no other way; and though I now sink out of view, and shall be forgotten, I believe I have made some marks which will tell for the cause of civil liberty long after I am gone.\"\n\nNarrator: Lincoln had lost the election, but his debates with Douglas had been reprinted all over the country, and he now had a national following. He held the middle ground somewhere between the abolitionists and the slaveholders of the south.\n\nHe continued speaking out across the Midwest in Illinois, Kansas, Indiana, Wisconsin, and wrote notes for a campaign biography, which he introduced with characteristic self-deprecation.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"Herewith is a little sketch.... There is not much of it, for the reason, I suppose, that there is not much of me.\"\n\nNarrator: There was now talk that he might one day run for higher office than the Senate. Lincoln professed to be astonished. \"Just think of such a sucker as me as President,\" he told a reporter, although his wife, he added, was confident he would one day make it to the top.\n\nThen, in early 1860, Lincoln eagerly traveled to New York where he had been invited to speak. The front-runner for the Republican nomination for President that year was the popular Senator from New York William Seward. Lincoln would be speaking on Seward's home ground. It was a chance for the prairie politician to show the Eastern leaders of the Republican party what he could do. Fifteen hundred curious people crowded the auditorium at the Cooper Union Institute. Lincoln later admitted he was uncomfortable, unsure of his audience, unsure of himself.\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: Now this is a man who entered the Cooper Union that night with his host genuinely concerned about the impression that this guy was going to make, this tall, angular, awkward man in clothes that didn't seem to fit him and said things like \"mister cheerman,\" and, frankly, most who were present said that when they first saw Lincoln when he first stood up their initial impression was, \"Oh, my goodness. This will never do.\"\n\nNarrator: But when Lincoln began to speak, doubts quickly vanished.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"Can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow slavery to spread? If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty fearlessly and effectively.... Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it.\"\n\nNarrator: The crowd rose to its feet when he had finished. \"No man,\" one reporter wrote, \"ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.\"\n\nHe had proven he was a politician to be reckoned with, a serious candidate for President. \"The taste,\" he admitted to a friend, \"is in my mouth.\"\n\nOn May 16, the Republicans gathered in Chicago to pick their candidate for the highest office in the land. In a crowded field of candidates the man to beat was still William Seward. Lincoln's own chances seemed slim.\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: Lincoln's qualifications in 1860 really paled compared to the other leading Republicans. His sole experience on the national level had been as a one -- term member of the House of Representatives. But nothing that would have prepared him for the kind of responsibilities he would face as President. Most people wouldn't have given Lincoln much of a chance at all.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln didn't go to Chicago, but he saw to it that able lieutenants were on hand, determined to snatch the nomination for their man.\n\nDonald Miller, Historian: There was this tremendous passion for Lincoln inside the conventional hall due, in part, to some maneuvering by Lincoln supporters. They handed out duplicate tickets to make sure there were more Lincolnites there than Seward people. The hired professional \"shriekers\" as they were called, these leather-lunged Midwesterners to go in there and start screaming for Lincoln's nomination. Lincoln felt his supporters could organize public sentiment on the convention floor and pull some back-room deals and things like that and carry the day.\n\nJudge Frank J. Williams, Chair, the Lincoln Forum: His becoming President was no accident. The Wood Fairy did not come down from the heavens and anoint him President and Commander In Chief. You just don't become President that way.\n\nNarrator: \"That man who thinks Lincoln sat down and gathered his robes about him, waiting for the people to call him, has a very erroneous knowledge of Lincoln,\" his law partner remembered. \"He was always calculating, always planning ahead. His ambition was a little engine that knew no rest.\" To relieve the tension while he waited for the results, Lincoln played handball at his home in Springfield.\n\nOn the first ballot, Seward held a commanding lead. But Lincoln was running ahead of everyone else. On the second ballot, Seward began losing ground. He was considered too extreme in his opposition to slavery. Lincoln hoped his own reputation as a moderate would carry the day. He had given careful instructions to his supporters:\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"My name is new in the field, and I suppose I am not the first choice of a very great many. Our policy, then, is to give no offense to others -- eave them in a mood to come to us, if they shall be compelled to give up their first love.\"\n\nNarrator: That is exactly what happened. On the third ballot, the Republicans at last united behind one man. The campaign to elect the 16th President of the United States was on. His name became known everywhere, but even his most ardent admirers were still unsure what he looked like. The opposition lampooned his looks and countrified ways, but to millions he became known as \"Honest Abe,\" and \"The Rail Splitter,\" though no one dared call him Abe to his face, and he never wanted to split rails again.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: Lincoln by this point was a prominent, very prosperous lawyer living in a good house in Springfield, well regarded in Illinois society with some national reputation. This was not a humble man of the people out chopping rails. On the other hand, there was a good deal of truth to this myth, and it was an immensely popular one as well. Well he went along with it, I don't think he initiated it, but he did go along with it. They brought to the hall, the actual rails that he supposedly split. And he said, well I might not have split those rails, but I've split a rail in my day.\n\nNarrator: Thousands of people came to Springfield to pay Lincoln tribute. A parade of floats and marching bands blared past his gate. The candidate towered above the crowd, his excited sons hung out the windows. His wife looked on proudly.\n\nMary Lincoln entertained now as never before. Newspapermen knocked at her door, eager to find out all they could about how the Lincolns lived, and Mrs. Lincoln eagerly showed them. \"The house was neatly without being extravagantly furnished,\" one wrote. \"An air of quiet refinement pervaded the place.... There were flowers upon the table...pictures upon the walls.... The hand of the domestic artist was everywhere visible. What a pleasant home Abe Lincoln has.\"\n\nMary thrilled to all the attention she was getting. She delighted in talking politics with reporters, startling some of her husband's political allies by suggesting names for his cabinet.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: She began to conceive of herself in a way that no Victorian political wife ever did, as an equal partner to her husband as his Chief Advisor. And she went into the Presidential election believing this. But Lincoln was a very shrewd politician and he had another life that she didn't know about. Involved with all these politicians, talking real strategy, the things that really were gonna get him elected in the end.\n\nNarrator: That June, Lincoln's prospects dramatically improved. The quarrel over slavery had split the Democrats: Northern Democrats nominated Stephen Douglas, who continued to champion \"popular sovereignty.\" Southern Democrats chose John C. Brekinridge of Kentucky, who argued that slavery should be allowed to spread to the territories. There was even a fourth candidate, John Bell, whose only platform he said, was the Constitution. With the opposition splintered, Lincoln suddenly became the favorite. He continued to insist that slavery must not move farther west, but pledged he would not interfere with slavery where it already existed.\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: Certainly Lincoln was trying to reassure the South that he personally had no intention of interfering with their peculiar institution or their culture or their political power or anything else. And yet they were not hearing that.\n\nNarrator: \"Let the consequences be what they may,\" said a prominent Georgia editor, \"whether the Potomac is crimsoned in gore and Pennsylvania Avenue is paved ten fathoms deep in mangled bodies, the South will never submit to such humiliation and degradation as the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: To them, he was part of an organization -- the Republican Party -- that was bent on the destruction of their way of life, of their institutions, of their culture.\n\nJames M. McPherson, Historian: There were plenty of warnings that if this black Republican abolitionist -- and that's what his opponents called him -- was elected President, that it would provoke the Southern States to secede. All kinds of people were warning that. But the Republicans said and thought that they were bluffing. Lincoln thought they were bluffing.\n\nNarrator: To Lincoln, the American Union was a sacred institution. It guaranteed every man's right to rise as he had risen. He couldn't imagine it disintegrating.\n\nAs election day approached, Mary admitted to a friend she was tense with excitement.\n\nVoice of Mary Lincoln (Holly Hunter): \"Fortunately, the time is rapidly drawing to a close, a little more than two weeks will decide the contest. I scarcely know how I would bear up under defeat. I trust that we will not have the trial.\"\n\nNarrator: Election Day, November 6. Lincoln and his supporters huddled in the State Capitol, waiting for news. At 1:30 in the morning, it came. Fifty one years old, with less than a year's formal schooling, Abraham Lincoln had been elected President of the United States. But his victory was far from overwhelming. He had polled just 40 percent of the popular vote, and had failed to win a single slave state. While fireworks raced across the Springfield sky, southern politicians were already calling for an end to the Union. But Lincoln believed in the common sense of his fellow countrymen. He meant to be President of all the United States. As Lincoln stepped out into the street, a jubilant crowd of nearly 10,000 called for the President-Elect to say something. Instead, he just waved.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"I guess I'll go down and tell Mary about it.\"\n\nNarrator: When he neared home, he stepped up his pace and began to shout.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"Mary, Mary, we are elected.\"\n\nNarrator: Everything for which the Lincolns had worked now seemed to be theirs. But they could not celebrate for long. Within 90 days, seven southern states would secede. Threats to kill Lincoln began arriving daily. His election had shattered the Union he held sacred and would let loose a whirlwind.\n\nPart Three: Shattered\n\nNarrator: On the morning of February 11, 1861, Abraham Lincoln prepared to leave Springfield, Illinois for Washington. The President-Elect had grown a beard since election day -- and was still not quite comfortable with how he looked.\n\nMary Lincoln was just back from New York where she had bought so much finery she did not dare tell her husband how much she had spent. She had accepted lavish gifts of clothing and jewelry, too, and had kept that fact to herself, as well.\n\nDespite the heavy rain, a sizable crowd turned out to see Lincoln off. Springfield had nurtured him. He had prospered there. Now, he was saying goodbye.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"My friends -- no one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything.\"\n\n\"Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington.\n\n\"I bid you an affectionate farewell.\"\n\nNarrator: In 20 days, Abraham Lincoln would become President of the United States. But the Union he held sacred had shattered.\n\nSlate: Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided\n\nNarrator: The Lincolns had long dreamed of this moment: at the end of a 12-day swing through northern cities lay the Executive Mansion.\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: His Republican Party has won the White House for the first time. He is the first Republican President. He is thrilled about what has happened. He is looking forward to it, and yet he watches the country falling apart before he even has a chance to take the oath of office.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln's election had been the signal for seven southern states to leave the Union: first South Carolina, then Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas. Eight more were teetering on the brink. One by one, federal forts had been turned over to the southern states without a shot being fired.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: Lincoln kept thinking that reasonable people in the South would gradually come to their senses and say, \"This is stupid. We must get back into the Union\" as it was.\n\nJames M. McPherson, Historian: \"They're not going to leave this country. They're patriots just as much as we are.\" Lincoln said that over and over again, and I think he really believed it. I think that was one of the mistakes that Lincoln and Northern Republicans made. They underestimated the depth and genuineness of Southern secessionist sentiment.\n\nNarrator: The brand-new Confederate States of America had adopted their own Constitution and appointed Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi as their new president.\n\nMark E. Neely Jr., Historian: The Southern view is that the Union is a matter of convenience. And when the Union became a nuisance instead of something that was helping them that they could just withdraw from it. They had created it, why couldn't they back out?\n\nNarrator: Some in the North wanted force used to bring the southern states back into the Union. Others argued the states should be allowed to leave in peace. Still others hoped for some sort of compromise. No one knew what Lincoln would do. As his train moved east, he kept silent or told jokes. Many concluded he was a well-intentioned bumbler, not up to the job.\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: He's in a very tough position. He is not going to say anything provocative. He is not going to say anything that might cause other states to join with those seven states that have already acted. If he postures, if he rattles a saber, that may be all it takes to get those states to follow suit. So he's going to be a man walking on political eggshells.\n\nNarrator: On February 22, Lincoln arrived in Philadelphia. At Independence Hall, where American freedom was first proclaimed, he raised the flag and swore allegiance to the promise of equality embodied in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance.... If this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle... I would rather be assassinated on this spot than to surrender it.\"\n\nNarrator: Lincoln had just been told of a plot to kill him. He wanted to ignore the threat, but aides finally convinced him to slip secretly into Washington. When Mary heard the news, she was terrified.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: Mary's worries about her husband's physical safety began from the very moment that he was elected President. He received all kinds of hate mail at home. The hatred that was spewed out at her husband was unbelievable, and I think there was always an undercurrent of fear... from that very early time, a seed of dread.\n\nNarrator: That evening, Abraham Lincoln and a loyal bodyguard quietly boarded a sleeping car. The bodyguard carried \"a small arsenal of deadly weapons beneath his coat.\" Lincoln wore a cap and cloak, and pretended to be an invalid. The President-Elect was reluctantly heading for Washington undercover.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: He was later ashamed of it and was embarrassed. He didn't think there had been a conspiracy ever, but he was talked into it.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln traveled the rest of the night and arrived in Washington at six the following morning, took a carriage to his hotel and slipped inside through the ladies entrance. Mary and the boys joined him later in the day.\n\nIt wasn't long before newspapers got hold of the story. Many had already dismissed him as a boor and a country bumpkin. Now, they called him a coward, too. Never before had a President gotten off to a more humiliating start.\n\nLincoln's first order of business was to interview the long lines of Republicans looking for government jobs.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"I have more pigs than I have tits. But they don't want much and don't get but little. I must see them.\"\n\nNarrator: At the same time, he met with the men who would make-up his cabinet-some of them rivals he had beaten for the Presidential nomination, all of them with more experience than Abraham Lincoln.\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: Lincoln has tremendous self-confidence... he's giving these positions to people like William Seward who resent him because he's won the nomination, to people who demean and diminish his capabilities, say that he is less qualified to hold this office than I am. Nobody in that cabinet has very high regard for Lincoln's abilities.\n\nNarrator: Monday, March 4, 1861, was unlike any other Inauguration Day in history. As the Lincolns rode up Pennsylvania Avenue, uniformed sharpshooters stood guard on rooftops. With the unfinished Capitol looming above them, Mary and several relatives took their seats just behind the President-elect. One of her cousins remembered looking out upon a sea of upturned faces, representing every shade of feeling; hatred, discontent, admiration and anxiety. Americans, North and South, were waiting to hear at last what their new President planned to do. He began by reassuring the South.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\n\nNarrator: He also vowed to \"hold, occupy and possess\" all the Federal installations under Union control. How he was going to do that he didn't say, but there would be no compromise with secession.\n\nDavid Herbert Donald, Biographer: Lincoln was very stubborn. He believed simply that the United States was the greatest country potentially in the world if it could hold together. And I think at no point did he ever seriously consider the possibility that Union could be destroyed.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"I hold that in contemplation of Universal Law and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual.\"\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: The passionate belief that Lincoln has in the necessity of preserving the Union is because the Union is necessary to preserve the democratic experiment. And what that democratic experiment meant to him was the chance for a poor person with hard work and discipline to move from one rung in the ladder to another, because there was opportunity, because there was equality.\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"Physically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them....\"\n\n\"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine is the momentous issue of Civil War. The government will not assail you. You can have no conflict, without being yourselves the aggressors...\"\n\n\"I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\"\n\nNarrator: As Lincoln spoke in Washington, a big crowd in Charleston, South Carolina, cheered as the flag of the Confederate States of America was hauled to the top of its pole. Out in Charleston harbor stood Fort Sumter, guarded by less than 100 federal soldiers. South Carolina troops trained cannon on the fort and demanded its surrender. With Sumter's defenders running out of food, South Carolina vowed to fire upon any federal ship that tried to reinforce or re-supply them.\n\nAbraham Lincoln knew almost nothing about warfare, had never managed anything larger than his two man law firm -- but it was now up to him to decide how to respond to the Southern threat. Defend or surrender Sumter? To defend it, he knew, meant war.\n\nVoice of Mary Lincoln, (Holly Hunter): \"March 28, 1861, Washington is perfectly charming.... I am beginning to feel so perfectly at home and enjoy everything so much. Every evening our blue room is filled with the elite of the land.\"\n\nNarrator: Mary Lincoln came to Washington with high hopes, determined to do her husband proud and also to make her own mark on the city, to live up to the brand-new title a British correspondent had coined for her -- \"First Lady.\"\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: She was going to dress the part and she was going to act the part and she was going to shine and do her best for her husband and she was going to prove that this man was not a hick from the sticks and she was not some Midwestern small town frump.\n\nNarrator: \"She is more self-possessed than Mister Lincoln,\" one newspaper reported, \"and has accommodated more readily than her taller half to the exalted station to which she has been so strangely advanced.\"\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: Here comes Mary Lincoln, all flags flying, standing up there beside her husband, presiding at teas, presiding at coffees, being charming, making political pronouncement. She burst upon Washington like fireworks on an empty sky, and she provided enormous copy for people who had never even thought of covering a President's wife before.\n\nCharles B. Strozier, Historian: She loved being the center of attention, and it was her greatest dream. She was probably not psychologically cut out to be at the center of the storm in which she found herself.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: Though Mary's arrival in Washington should have been a moment of triumph, it must have been so hard for her knowing that so much of her strength came from her southern roots: the South has seceded. Her sisters and brothers are on the opposite side. She's cut off from those roots, and she's on a collision course with her very own past. The Southerners feel that she's a traitor for being married to Lincoln, and herself being a passionate defender of the Union cause. On the other hand, the Northerners are very suspicious. So she really becomes a woman without a country.\n\nNarrator: On Mary Lincoln's first day in her new home, she and her children had gone from room to room. She was appalled by what she found.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: She said, \"She never saw such abominable furniture in her life, that if she had lived in the humblest cabin she would never have given it house room. It was so awful.\"\n\nJean Baker, Biographer: It looked like a second-rate hotel. And there was broken furniture, stained rugs. So Mary Lincoln arrives. She's ambitious, she's energetic, and her idea is to make the White House into a statement. She intended to use it as a symbol of the Union power.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: The Union was breaking apart. The White House was the home of the President of the United States, and he deserved virtually a palace to live in, lest anybody think that the White House was falling apart along with the Union.\n\nNarrator: Mary resolved to transform the old house, and Congress gave her the money to get the job done.\n\nLinda Levitt Turner, Biographer: Suddenly she had an appropriation of 20 thousand dollars to spend as she liked. And she loved stores and she'd loved shopping, and she was determined to turn this house into a fitting home.\n\nNarrator: March 5, 1861. On his first day in the Executive Mansion, Lincoln found a message on his desk from Fort Sumter. The Federal Garrison was growing desperate. Without food and supplies, it could not hold out much longer.\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: Fort Sumter was the symbol. It was in Charleston harbor, the birthplace of the rebellion. To give Fort Sumter up at this point would have dealt a devastating blow to Northern morale in this crisis.\n\nNarrator: The President summoned the Commander of the United States Army, the hero of the Mexican War, Winfield Scott.\n\nJames M. McPherson, Historian: Winfield Scott said it would take 20,000 troops and a whole fleet of naval ships to reinforce Fort Sumter, and it would start a bloody war that would destroy this country. So Scott says, \"Pull out.\"\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: And yet, Lincoln had promised in his Inaugural Address that he would yield no Federal property or installations to the rebels.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln seemed trapped. To fire in defense of Sumter risked driving more states out of the Union. To do nothing meant surrendering to the Confederacy. He asked his cabinet for their advice. On March 16 -- 10 days after the Sumter crisis had begun -- they gave him their recommendations: all but two urged him to give up the fort. If Federal ships tried to shoot their way in, they told him, you will be accused of starting a war.\n\nLincoln listened but did not act. Wait, he said, give the Confederates time to come to their senses. One more week went by, then two. The Union soldiers inside the fort grew increasingly desperate for food. Still Lincoln hesitated.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: Here's this new President getting such strong advice from almost everybody against what he feels he should do. And somehow holding those contradictions inside himself, he says, \"I'm not ready to make this decision yet.\"\n\nNarrator: As Lincoln waited, he grew more and more depressed. Sleepless, tormented by migraines, he was, he said, \"in the dumps.\" The strain was so great, Mary noted, that at one point, her husband \"keeled over\" -- fainted dead away. Then Secretary of State William Seward made an astonishing proposal. He told the President that Sumter should be abandoned, and if the President wasn't willing to make policy, he was.\n\nAll along Seward had been playing a shadowy game, leaking hints to the press that the fort was about to be given up, even secretly passing the word to the Confederates that he would soon be empowered to negotiate its surrender. Lincoln put Seward in his place.\n\nThe President -- and no one else -- would make policy, Lincoln told his Secretary of State. Five weeks after Lincoln's Inauguration, a clash at Fort Sumter now seemed inevitable.\n\nA Union fleet was preparing for action outside Charleston Harbor. The President had finally devised a shrewd plan. He warned the Governor of South Carolina:\n\nVoice of Lincoln (David Morse): \"An attempt will be made to supply Fort Sumter with provisions only. If such attempt be not resisted, no effort to throw in men, arms or ammunition will be made without further notice.\"\n\nNarrator: If the rebels wanted a war so badly they were willing to open fire on boats carrying \"food for hungry men,\" Lincoln said, \"then the blame would be theirs alone.\"\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: It was an ingenious solution because now the Confederates had to fire the first shot. \"We will not be the aggressors.\" He promised that in his Inaugural Address. \"You will have to be the aggressors and as the aggressors, you will leave us the moral high ground.\"\n\nNarrator: At 4:30 in the morning on April 12, 1861, South Carolina batteries opened fire. The shelling went on for more than 33 hours. Finally, the Union soldiers surrendered. The rebel flag now flew over Fort Sumter. The American Civil War had begun.\n\nVoice of Lincoln, (David Morse): \"I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, in virtue of the power in me vested by the Constitution hereby do call forth, the militia of the several states of the Union, in order to suppress said rebellious combinations, and to cause the laws to be duly executed....\"\n\nNarrator: Lincoln hoped the rebellion would be over soon. He called upon the loyal states to supply 75,000 militiamen. Each man would need to serve just 90 days.\n\nJames M. McPherson, Historian: Lincoln was convinced that a majority of people in the Confederate states really were unionists and that they were being swept out of the Union by the passion of the moment.\n\nNarrator: Within weeks, four more southern states left the Union -- Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, North Carolina. Lincoln now feared that the slave-holding border states of Missouri, Maryland, Delaware, and Kentucky -- the state where he and Mary had both been born -- would leave, too.\n\nBut Lincoln clung to the hope that one big Union victory could still bring the South to its senses and end the rebellion. In the days immediately following Fort Sumter, Washington seemed like a ghost town. Hundreds of Southern-born clerks left their jobs with the Federal Government and slipped away into Confederate Virginia.\n\nUsing a spyglass from the upstairs windows of the White House, the Lincolns could see rebel flags flying over Alexandria, just across the Potomac. A Confederate attack could come at any time. A band of nervous civilians patrolled the White House grounds. Washington was almost defenseless. Lincoln waited impatiently for reinforcements. But as Union soldiers attempted to march through Baltimore to relieve the Capital, mobs of secessionists attacked them. Four soldiers were killed.\n\nLincoln paced his office, muttering, \"Why don't they come! Why don't they come!\" Rumors of an imminent attack on the President himself were kept from Mary for fear her nerves would fail her.\n\nFinally, on April 25, the 7th New York regiment marched briskly past the White House. The men brought word that more regiments were right behind them. As Lincoln hurried out to greet them, they cheered his wife, who quickly gave way to tears of relief, while the President, one observer wrote, seemed to \"smile all over.\"\n\nTwo days later, to make sure secessionists could not stand in the way of Union troops again, Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus: now American citizens could be arrested without knowing the charges made against them. The President argued that by suspending one part of the constitution, he would save the rest. Those people, North or South, who had thought Lincoln was a weakling, were learning how wrong they had been.\n\nOn May 10, Mary Lincoln and three companions set out on a shopping expedition to Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. Shopping had always helped to soothe Mary's anxieties, and her plans for re-doing the President's house now consumed her.\n\n\"Her chief enjoyment,\" her sister would later write, \"consists in purchasing and storing.\"\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: It was Lincoln who suggested that Mary make this trip to get her away from the tension of Washington and to give her some sort of joy back in her own life again... And it didn't seem like a very unreasonable trip at the start. She needed a new carriage for them in Washington. She wanted a new dinner service for the White House.\n\nNarrator: She was horrified to find that reporters followed her from store to store, quizzing sales clerks about every purchase she made. They reported that she had ordered costly bedsteads, carpets, curtains, wallpaper, glassware, and two sets of dinnerware -- at $1100 each.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: She invited, unwittingly, criticism of the press by even taking such a trip in the midst of such a terrible time. It is the hour of self-sacrifice. The hour of death. It's the time when the country is undergoing this severe struggle.\n\nNarrator: Newspapers accused her of tasteless extravagance. \"She evidently has no comprehension,\" wrote the Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch, \"that Jeff Davis will make good his threat to occupy the White House in July.\" The criticism only made Mary more anxious -- and more eager to shop. There would be more trips, more \"purchasing and storing.\"\n\nOn Sunday morning, July 21, while the Lincolns attended services at the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, a great battle was about to begin just 25 miles from Washington, along Bull Run Creek in Virginia.\n\nThe President had ordered the action over the protests of the Union commander who had said that his men were not yet ready for combat. If they didn't do battle soon, Lincoln warned, their 90-day enlistment would be up.\n\nAs the President and his family walked home, they could just hear the distant sound of artillery. The first dispatches were encouraging. A Union victory, Lincoln hoped, might end the war.\n\nRelieved, the Lincolns went for a carriage ride. Then, a rider caught up with them with an ominous message from the battlefield: the tide had turned. Union troops were now streaming back toward Washington in full retreat. Soon the streets were filled with ambulances and stumbling, weary soldiers.\n\nIt was the first full-scale battle of the war, and the Union had lost.\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: Lincoln's very surprised, not just by the defeat, but by the extent of the defeat. I mean it was not just a battlefield defeat; it was turned into a rout. I mean they called this \"the great skedaddle\" as the Union army fled from the field.\n\nNarrator: Lincoln did not go to bed that night. He lay on a sofa in his office, instead, listening to eyewitnesses describe the disaster: 625 boys dead, more than 2,000 wounded or missing. It was now clear that this war would take more than 90 days to win.\n\nThe Capital had become the most heavily fortified city on earth and the sound of drums was everywhere. A new General was turning 100,000 untrained volunteers into a mighty, disciplined force, the Army of the Potomac. His admirers called him \"the Young Napoleon.\"\n\nLincoln had appointed General George Brinton McClellan, a little man with impressive credentials, a 35-year-old West Pointer, who had studied tactics in Europe. He promised to make short work of the Confederacy. \"I can do it all,\" he told the President.\n\nDavid E. Long, Historian: McClellan was a genius. As a man who could prepare an army to perform the task it's required to perform in wartime, McClellan has no peer. McClellan had a relationship with his troops. There was an affection, an intimacy. McClellan regarded them as though they were his sons and he was their father. They revered him.\n\nNarrator: As McClellan prepared his army for battle, huge crowds turned out to watch him. The General had become enormously popular.\n\nBut as Summer turned to Fall, he showed no signs of moving against the enemy. Lincoln wanted action. The North needed a victory. But McClellan refused to take his men into battle. They weren't ready, he said. The General insisted he knew better than the President.\n\nDonald L. Miller, Historian: McClellan thought of himself as a man who was deeply superior to the President. He was a northern aristocrat, well-schooled, well-educated, spoke a number of languages. And he saw Lincoln as a backwoods, backwater politician, crude, unlettered. He hated his humor. He hated the style of his dress. They were exact opposites. And he would have nothing do with Lincoln.\n\nNarrator: McClellan even refused to let the Commander-in-Chief in on his plans. Lincoln, McClellan, wrote his wife, is \"nothing more than a well-meaning baboon... the original gorilla.\" Aides urged the President to fire the General. Lincoln said only \"he would gladly hold McClellan's horse if it brought victories.\" Fall turned to Winter. There were countless parades and grand reviews, but there were no victories. McClellan kept on drilling.\n\nLincoln worked every day, from seven in the morning till late at night. He took no holidays, often failed to take time to eat. Mary did her best to make her distracted husband's life bearable.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin, Historian: At the start Mary was able to ease his burden slightly. She would invite friends of his to breakfast hoping they could distract him from the problems of the day. But as the war progressed, his willingness to take these moments of relaxation diminished. And Mary really felt that she had less time with him than ever before in their marriage. In the past Lincoln could always break away from the law offices to go home and comfort Mary in one of her difficult moments, in a thunderstorm, in one of those times when she was upset. But now his workload was of such g"
