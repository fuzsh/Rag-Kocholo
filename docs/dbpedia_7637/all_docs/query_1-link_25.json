        "text": "Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & 2 (2003-2004)\n\nEmily Langenbahn\n\nSeconds before the film’s opening scene, the screen reads: “‘Revenge is a dish best served cold’ – Old Klingon Proverb”. While the exact origin of this quote is unclear, it serves to suggest that the act of revenge is the most gratifying when it is unanticipated or unsuspected, and the more ruthless the manner in which it is taken, the better. Director Quentin Tarantino employs multiple cinematic techniques in an effort to paint a theme of revenge on his two-hour length films (collectively referred to as Kill Bill). After suffering a brutal attack by her previous employer and lover, Beatrix Kiddo (also known as “The Bride” for the entirety of the first film) wakes up four years later from a coma, only to discover that the child she had been pregnant with at the time of the attack was presumably dead. She immediately seeks vengeance against the child’s father, Bill, and swears to destroy all of her assassin colleagues who betrayed her as well.\n\nThough the premise alone offers an adequate assurance of revenge killing to occur frequently in both films, Tarantino also utilizes several different methods to communicate this theme — more than a few scenes deviate from the brilliant, striking colors normally seen in the film and are instead shown in black and white; there is a non-linear storyline which allows for a gradual build-up of emotion behind each brutal killing; there is a brief break from live action sequences altogether which is replaced instead with animation and voice-over narration; non-diegetic sound is present consistently throughout the film bordering on overuse, but it is done with a purpose; there is even an interesting juxtaposition of traditional “western” cultures which ultimately serve as multiple symbols for revenge. The majority of these in-depth explanations will involve Kill Bill: Vol. 1, though Kill Bill: Vol.2 will also occasionally be referenced.\n\nScenes Shot in Black and White in Kill Bill\n\nThe majority of the films Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) and Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) were shown in full color — possibly oversaturated with it, but there were a few notable scenes shown only in black and white, entirely absent of color even after the audience was already meant to witness a bloody battle to the death. Two examples from Kill Bill: Vol. 1 include the opening scene in which the audience sees The Bride (Uma Thurman) lying on the ground in her wedding gown, bloodied and battered, gasping for breath; the next occurs much later in the film, when The Bride faces off against the entire Yakuza clan in Japan and annihilates nearly every person in the building, initiating her journey with the simple mission to kill O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), who was previously one of her fellow assassins and presently the leader of the Yakuza. Clearly, these were conscious choices made by director Quentin Tarantino, but were these choices made in order to emphasize the massive bloodshed or to censor it?\n\nSeveral less-than-reputable sources (Wikipedia, personal blogs, etc.) suggest than this decision was made in order to avoid an NC-17 rating upon both films’ releases, which could quite possibly be a significant reason for Tarantino’s choice to use black and white during these scenes of the films. A more likely reason, however, is the classic, theatric, and impressionable effect of using black and white in a film. An article about the history of film noir’s evolution in the American cinema notes, “One of the major accomplishments of [film noir] . . . is to replace the melodramatic combat of arms between the hero and villain with a richly elaborated ‘ceremony of killing’. Death in such films usually takes the form of a professional execution or a sadistic ritual” (Naremore 19). The particular scenes chosen to be shot in black and white were especially horrific in nature, as they depicted violent slaughtering of several characters, but at the center of all the violence is always the heroic and villainous figures. Though there were many other violent encounters throughout both films, the scenes shown in black and white were crucial moments captured for The Bride’s characterization, and Tarantino likely wanted these scenes to stand out in some way from the rest.\n\nThe Functionality of a Non-Linear Narrative in Kill Bill\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino is notorious for bringing a non-linear storyline to the screen, and it has generally been well-received, especially with the popularity of Pulp Fiction after its release in 1994; nearly a decade later, Tarantino continues to use this method in his films to convey the themes. Immediately following the near-execution of The Bride (Thurman) at the hands of her ex-lover, ex-boss, and father of her child, Bill (David Carradine), the scene jumps forward to a brief shot of The Bride waking up from her coma, only to leap forward again to The Bride’s second target: Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox). Having already accomplished her first kill, The Bride is confident as she pulls up to Vernita Green’s pleasant pea-green home in Pasadena, California. The front lawn is littered with the toys of Vernita Green’s young daughter, but The Bride is determined to complete her second assassination. This is the first kill seen by the audience, however, and after the completion of this kill, the story is allowed to take yet another leap in time — backwards, this time — in order to explain the film’s previous events.\n\nThe non-linear method used in communicating the themes of Kill Bill is certainly a questionable one — it demands full attention from the audience and often requires visual cues to establish a timeline, such as The Bride’s frequent referring to and crossing names of her “hit list”; this way, the audience is given a clear indication where The Bride is in her journey and what events are to come. Interestingly, both films often opt to press forward in time, pausing to take a step back in time only when it is absolutely necessary for the story to progress. In fact, the very first piece of the violent encounter between The Bride and the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad is not explained until Kill Bill: Vol. 2, when the audience is given the chance to establish the setting as well as understand the true brutality of the massacre. There is certainly room for argument that this method of storyline is simply Quentin Tarantino’s “style” in the way he writes and directs his films, but a formalist approach might defend this particular structure of Tarantino’s films as a strength in communicating the theme of seeking a violent revenge. “The woman scorned” motif is enhanced by the strategically-placed flashback sequences, and the out-of-order narrative is chaotic but controlled, much like the emotions charging through The Bride as she rampages her way through each member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and finally, to Bill (Carradine) himself.\n\nAnimation in a Live Action Film: Kill Bill Origin Story of O-Ren Ishii\n\nConsistent with the Japanese influence of the Kill Bill films, the style of animation chosen to be included in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 was anime. In a lengthy segue from The Bride’s story, the origin of the young Japanese assassin O-Ren Ishii (Liu) is revealed, and not surprisingly, it is equally as disturbing and savage as the rest of the film, despite being an animated version of the tale.\n\nA critical use for the presence of animation in an otherwise live action film could potentially be to reduce the appearance of realistic bloodshed and once again to lessen the films’ overall violence. In François Debrix’s article dissecting both Kill Bill films, she states: “Kill Bill does have a cartoonish feel. It plays with images, colors, sounds, and texts to (over)represent and exaggerate a reality of violence, war, and revenge that, in many ways, is meant to buffer the spectators from the reality of war, from the everydayness of the American war machine and its terror. From this perspective, Kill Bill ups the ante. It takes the violence of America’s war on terror to its extreme but absurd limits through filmic or cartoonish representations” (556). This is an accurate interpretation in terms of exposing some of the absurdity of the violence present in the Kill Bill films, because many, if not all, of the major stunts performed in both films are unrealistic representations of violent encounters.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps the choice to include a sequence of animation for O-Ren Ishii’s story could effectively communicate the ridiculousness of this particular story, even to openly mock the entire concept of The Bride’s search for a cold-hearted revenge against a man she once loved. Prior to Debrix’s criticism of Tarantino’s exaggeration of reality, she also points out, “Tarantino’s manipulation of warrior violence attracts the audience and yet, by doing so, also creates a distance between the spectator and war. Despite the fact that some commentators have argued that Tarantino’s films are meaningful because they enable a ‘harsh reality’ about society to infiltrate cinematic fiction, Tarantino insists that making a film like Kill Bill is ‘not about being realistic, it’s about being theatrical, operatic’. Kill Bill is about play, theatre, and fantasy” (555). Again, this argument points to the theatric elements that Tarantino tends to favor and focus on in his films, making them more memorable for the audience as well as creating a strong sense of theme within the stories.\n\nThe Overemphasis of Non-Diegetic Sound in Kill Bill\n\nDuring the first fight scene in Kill Bill: Vol. 1, the use of non-diegetic sound is necessary to establish the level of violence and intensity that should be expected by the audience throughout the rest of the films. As The Bride approaches the house of Vernita Green (who is also known as “Copperhead” as a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad), the scene is quiet and calm — that is, up until Vernita Green answers the door. Hectic and intense music that mimics a wailing siren is played, and The Bride’s determined expression is seen in an extreme close-up of her eyes before she attacks Vernita Green. The sound effects that follow work to increase the magnitude of the fight as well as to display the unlikeliness of the characters’ strength and fighting abilities — the shattering of glass in various rooms of the house, the excess force behind each blow delivered, and the voice-over narration voiced by The Bride in between the fights. The altercation is even made comedic when Vernita Green’s four-year-old daughter, Nikki (Ambrosia Kelley), returns home from school and the reliance on diegetic sound resumes; as the school bus pulls up, both The Bride and Vernita Green cease their advances and hide their weapons while Vernita Green instructs Nikki to go to her room.\n\nIn this particular scene, the objective of revenge is easy to identify, but the question remains on how the added sound effects contribute to this theme — does it further emphasize the point, or does it detract from the realism of the situation the characters have found themselves in? In an article analyzing the use of added sound for the purpose of adding to the overall impression of the film, critic Benjamin Wright notes, “Several studies of the classical Hollywood sound track have already suggested that sound is, more or less, a representation of reality, not an original event. Production considerations including the rise of multitrack recording and re-recording involving volume adjustment and filtering have led to increasingly layered tracks that complicate any notions of ‘realism’” (6). This argument could point to an adverse effect of the use of non-diegetic sound for the purposes of creating a realistic situation, but in the case of the Kill Bill films, it seems to bring forth The Bride’s mission to exact revenge on the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and possibly even aggrandize her unwavering resolve to kill Bill.\n\nThe Clash of Cultures and Popular References in Kill Bill: Utilizing the Stereotypes\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino is notorious for many stylistic choices in his films, including the out-of-sequence storylines and the use of excess dyed corn syrup in the especially bloody scenes; but another stylistic choice frequented and favored by Tarantino is the influence of the heroic “outlaw” figure versus the villain characters in a final, shoot-out Western style confrontation. Examples of these artistic choices are found in many of Tarantino’s films, including Django Unchained (2012), Inglourious Basterds (2009), and Pulp Fiction (1994).\n\nThere is an undeniable use of elements stemming from Japanese culture present in both of the Kill Bill films, but particularly in Kill Bill: Vol.1, when The Bride travels first to Okinawa and then to Tokyo to train for and then complete her first kill since awakening from her coma. Why does Tarantino choose to use such a heavy influence of Japanese culture in these two films? There is certainly a clash of two different ideas of “Western” cultures as far as the theme of revenge is concerned, even though they seem to be working in tandem to better communicate the theme of the films. The cohesiveness of these colliding cultures is not the only elements in the Kill Bill films working to create this effect, however; both of the films are littered with other popular culture references, which does well to reflect Tarantino’s wealth of knowledge in the cinematic world. In an interesting comparison article written by Michael Rennet, “Quentin Tarantino and the Director as DJ”, Rennet points out one of the most critical references to popular culture in Kill Bill: Vol. 1, stating: “Much of the impact of a reference comes from the connection to its source. The Bride’s wearing of the Bruce Lee Game of Death tracksuit in Kill Bill would leave a weak impression upon the audience if it were just a superficial homage. However, since the tracksuit embodies Lee’s connection to the Western world as he defeats his opponents using multiple kung fu styles, it holds extra significance; the Bride not only belongs to Western civilization while in the East but must also defeat her enemies with a variety of fighting methods. With this wide knowledge of movie history, this group of directors can place a reference at just about any point in their film to strengthen the impact of their movie” (397). There is no doubt that the decision for The Bride’s character to wear the same costume was intentional, and the reference will actually serve to strengthen The Bride’s purpose in seeking vengeance.\n\nRennet also discusses other characteristics traditionally seen in Tarantino’s outlaw style films, noting that Tarantino “attempts to push the boundaries of societal taboos such as violence, sexuality, or drugs to a hyper-reality within [his] work . . . Part of this outlaw image is based on the artistic standards of the independent movie industry to which Tarantino and his peers belong” (399). The mentioning of this point further supports Tarantino’s methods of intertwining cultural and societal stereotypes to strengthen the theme of revenge in both of the Kill Bill films.\n\nThe Symbols of Revenge in Kill Bill\n\nThe “symbols” in this section are specifically referring to the colors and types of shots that recur frequently in both of the Kill Bill films.\n\nThe first, arguably most notable symbol for revenge is present in the oversaturation of vibrant reds and yellows throughout the films. As mentioned in the previous section, The Bride wears a bright yellow tracksuit for most of the film, which functions not only as a nod to the Bruce Lee film Game of Death, but also draw attention to the character of The Bride. Ironically, the color yellow is often intended to feel warm and inviting — much like the pale yellow walls in the kitchen of Vernita Green’s home — but in relation to The Bride, it is used to call attention to her. The Bride is at the very center of the revenge killing, and this allows for her to be seen at all times by the audience, especially when she is in the throes of battling against hundreds of skilled swordsmen. Next, the color red is on display in every scene, whether the characters are covered in blood after a fight, or the red filter that briefly flashes over an extreme close-up of The Bride’s eyes moments before she attacks a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The red is quite simply a symbol for the bloodshed that will be required for The Bride to satisfy her vengefulness against Bill.\n\nCoincidentally, in regards to frequently recurring shots, the most memorable is the extreme close-ups of The Bride’s eyes. These shots are always accompanied by flashing red filters and a frantic-sounding siren, and these effects in combination with the shot position communicate every ounce of The Bride’s hate, pain, and thirst for revenge without a single line of spoken dialogue. This also brings the audience closer to The Bride as a character, allowing for a clearer insight into her suffering and thus creating a deeper connection with her. By establishing this deeper connection from the audience to The Bride, Tarantino also creates a feeling of confidence in The Bride’s actions, and her character emerges as a kind of hero figure within the story — the audience roots for her victory over the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, despite her actions normally being considered as cold-hearted or cruel. The message that “revenge is a dish best served cold” shines through most brilliantly in these short cutaway scenes, serving as more than adequate symbols for the theme of revenge present in both of the Kill Bill films.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDebrix, François. “Kill Bill, Volume I and II.” Millennium – Journal of International Studies 34.2 (2006): 553-57.
