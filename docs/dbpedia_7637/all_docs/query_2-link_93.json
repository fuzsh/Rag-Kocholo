        "text": "Last night, I had the pleasure of listening to Brad Lee Zimmerman and Yuka Shirasuna, hosted by British Film Editors (BFE) to talk about their experience editing #BlueEyeSamurai. I was particularly inspired by Yuka, who said that she applied for this job, even if she didn't have any experience in animation. Turns out they needed someone with experience in live-action! It is a powerful example of how important it is to go beyond our fears and rigid mental schemes. She also shared that during this first experience cutting an animation show, she could finally say: \"Let's fix it in animation!\", instead of hearing the usual \"Fix it in post\", often frustrating for us editorsüôÅ Anyway, live-action or animation, it's all about the story, and Blue Eye Samurai is surely a great one! I believe its strength lies in underlying the beauty of \"impurity,\" mainly characterized by Mizu, a Japanese woman with blue eyes who is also a samurai. I guess we can all relate to this character, everyone with his own \"impure\" journey. I personally always believed that my multidisciplinary path was a weakness. Going from applied mathematics, music, digital graphics, and data science, to editing, I always felt I was not specialized enough to become an impeccable editor. Nevertheless, being film editing my true passion, I have no choice but to embrace this weakness, hoping to turn it into a strength, just like Mizu. On the other hand, a perfect samurai blade holds its structural integrity only if the metal retains some impurities, as stated by Mizu's sword master Eiji! #BFE #editing #animation #BlueEyeSamurai #thebeautyofimpurity\n\nWe are native southern filmmakers who created a scripted short film that has already screened in over 50 festivals and won over won over 30 awards internationally! Our short film A CRY FOR HELP is available now for online viewing - learn more about the project, watch the film and more at https://lnkd.in/evefdJQ3. A Cry for Help stars Escalante Lundy and Shanna Forrestall and was directed by Steven Esteb and lensed by JP Summers. Logline: When a man of color is convicted of a crime he did not commit, his life and death hang in the hands of a woman too afraid to stand for truth. It‚Äôs our goal to shine a light on the inequality towards people of color and the poor in southern states by for-profit prison systems, and hope that these stories stimulate authentic conversations so that our communities can find ways to encourage and facilitate permanent criminal justice reform. Project Overview: A CRY FOR HELP is an intimate look at the destructive power of white privilege and the impact of white silence on black incarceration told in a dramatic short film format. Lensed in black and white, reminiscent of classic films like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, it‚Äôs an American tragedy right out of the headlines. A cautionary tale that shines a sad light on the tragic destruction of an American family by the fear and indifference of an otherwise caring witness to a crime that never really happened. . . . . . #stopmassincarceration #endmassincarceration #shortfilm #blackandwhite\n\nWe are native southern filmmakers who created a scripted short film that has already screened in over 50 festivals and won over won over 30 awards internationally!
