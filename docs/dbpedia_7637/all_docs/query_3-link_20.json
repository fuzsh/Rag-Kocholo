        "text": "This dissertation develops a comprehensive study of the influence exerted by Hollywood “genre” cinema, in particular the B-series film noir, on the French New Wave. Initially, I ask if this relationship is not the principle identifying criterion of New Wave cinema. It is, after all, a matter of record that Hollywood’s cheaply-made B-movies were championed by the critics of Cahiers du cinéma as permitting authorial self-expression and as encouraging cinematic innovation and evolution. Genre cinema subsequently remained a preoccupation for the New Wave auteurs, who made no fewer than fifty gangster and crime films between 1958 and 1965, including many of the New Wave’s most iconic films. I therefore embark on a comparative study that considers in great detail the New Wave’s reprisal and adaptation of the film noir format, with my analyses focused not only on character and plot conventions, but also on the tropes, aesthetics and filmmaking production techniques common to both cinemas. I show how the two cinemas cross-pollinate, especially given that the French polar itself exerted influence on Hollywood film noir and that French critics were among the first to identify the new tendency towards making film noir in postwar Hollywood. I also draw a number of important conclusions. Primarily, I show that while the New Wave borrows extensively from Hollywood aesthetics, its manipulation and subversion of American film noir conventions are also at the very heart of the politique des auteurs. This politique is characterized by a profound dissatisfaction with their era, the Americanization of French society, France’s involvement in Algeria, and a reticence about the impending sexual liberation movement. I contextualize my project within the current debate in film and French studies regarding the legacy of the New Wave, particularly in light of a tendency to cast doubt on the movement’s involvement with “the political,” as well as to dispute the New Wave’s status as a defining moment in French cinema.\n\nIn order to account for how Norwegian film noir relates to shifting historical trends, the structure of the dissertation follows the outline by which film noir is usually organized. It starts with the classic period of the forties and fifties, moves to the resurrection of the seventies, and then to the self-conscious revival of the eighties, and finally to the artistic/independent mass-market film of the late nineties. Naturally, such generalized categories do not tell the whole truth. But they do suggest a pattern – a pattern into which Norwegian film noir apparently also falls.\n\nThis article offers a cultural historical interpretation of The Third Man: The Lives of Harry Lime (1951-52) an internationally syndicated radio series based on the film The Third Man (1949). It argues that the series’ cultural meanings can only be fully assessed through accounting for the programme’s international framing or encoding, which critics have heretofore overlooked. As an internationally encoded series The Third Man has a high degree of interpretive openness in order to appeal to and resonate with heterogeneous audiences. The article examines the ways in which the series creates interpretive openness through its ambiguous characterization of the protagonist Harry Lime, use of Lime’s American nationality, international settings and how it drew upon the Cold War for dramatic material. The series’ international encoding, interpretive openness and broadcast during the Cold War ground interpreting its cultural meanings. The article claims that the series offers critical perspectives on the Cold War through Lime’s serving as a metonym for the United States, and plots that allegorically and satirically dramatize the Cold War milieu."
