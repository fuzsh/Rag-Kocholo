His quest has taken him to the far reaches of the frozen tundra, and he has convinced the Legendary Pokémon Zekrom to help him!\n\nDamon plans to trap Victini and harness its power, and as that plan gets under way, the entire town of Eindoak faces disaster! Can Ash use the courage of truth to convince the Legendary Pokémon Reshiram to help stop Damon? Can they rescue Victini? The greatest adventure in Pokémon history approaches!\n\nPlot\n\nThe movie begins with the world of Pokémon opening, showing the Unova Pokémon populating the land, seas, and skies. The screen moves towards Ash's Pikachu, who starts running, powers up an Electro Ball, and then fires it—at a Throh in White—Victini and Zekrom, or a Sawk in Black—Victini and Reshiram. Pikachu then runs to Ash. The trio reaches a fork in the road; Cilan looks at his map and tells the group to go left in Black—Victini and Reshiram, or right in White—Victini and Zekrom.\n\nIn White—Victini and Zekrom, the screen then moves to a hot desert, where a man named Damon is traveling by foot. Damon comes upon a young Blitzle with an injured leg, and he calls upon his Reuniclus's Psychic to help him carry the injured Blitzle on his shoulder. Damon, Reuniclus, and Blitzle turn to walk back to a small village to find Blitzle's owner, a little girl named Luisa. Luisa's father thanks Damon for helping, but tells him to go home and that his plans are useless. Damon then tells the man that Eindoak Town can be revived, but he is again rebuffed.\n\nAt that moment, a dust storm appears in the desert and heads towards the village. A herd of Bouffalant are startled by this, and they begin to stampede towards the village. Damon goes to check out the disaster and holds up his hand, cueing the appearance of Reshiram. Damon then climbs on Reshiram's back and orders it to destroy the dust storm, which it does with power and ease. Damon then asks the townspeople, who are shocked by the Legendary Pokémon's appearance, to give him another chance.\n\nIn Black—Victini and Reshiram, the scene instead shows Damon and his Gothitelle visiting a town on a tundra. He discusses the matter of the Kingdom of the Vale's revival with a resident there but is again dismissed. He refuses to leave, asking to see Glacine, the village's chief. She and her son Luis are on a cliff working to find herbs with his Lillipup's help. Below, on an ice shelf, a group of Beartic become agitated when a giant iceberg collides with the ice. The cliff fractures, causing Luis to fall; then, as his mother and the first resident are trying to rescue him, the ice they are standing upon breaks off, stranding all of them in the path of the iceberg. Damon's Gothitelle saves Luis's Lillipup from falling into the water, and then Damon himself appears with Zekrom to destroy the iceberg. Damon and Zekrom reiterate their proposal, and, awed by the display, Glacine, and her village reconsider.\n\nNear Eindoak Town, Ash, Iris and Cilan find a pair of Deerling in danger on a cliff face. Ash attempts to rescue them but begins to fall himself; however, he is rescued when Victini touches his foot out of his sight, giving him the ability to jump hundreds of feet across the canyon. Now separated from his stunned friends, Ash agrees to meet Iris and Cilan later and heads into a cave with the two Deerling. Victini shows Ash visions of the path he should take, allowing him to find his way through the cave. He reaches a giant cavern with a mesh of crystal paths, and Ash's presence mysteriously activates an orb and the crystals, before he is guided again to the cellar of Eindoak Town's castle and up to its balcony. There, he reunites with his friends.\n\nCilan explains that the castle is known as the \"Sword of the Vale\", and is said in legend to have flown to its current location from a valley far away. While exploring the castle, Ash, Iris, and Cilan share some macarons among themselves, but an invisible Victini keeps stealing Ash's macarons, much to his disbelief. The group hears fireworks outside, which causes Victini to choke on a macaron as the group realizes they must hurry to the town's battle tournament. In the ruckus, Ash runs into the invisible Victini—this confuses him for a moment, but he brushes it off. The group encounters a relatively plain-clothed Damon, who introduces himself as the castle's caretaker and offers to escort them to the town, which they accept.\n\nIn the town square, the group meets a woman named Juanita, who runs a Victini-themed souvenir stand with her Golurk (which is Shiny in Black—Victini and Reshiram). The town's mayor, Mannes, gives a speech to the townspeople congratulating them for the bountiful harvest they have collected. Mannes sends his Klink, Klang and Klinklang into a large music machine, starting the festival. He explains the tournament's rules: each competitor has been given a necklace and must challenge other competitors throughout the town, with losing Trainers surrendering their necklaces until the winner emerges.\n\nIn the first round of the tournament, Ash faces Mako and her Serperior, which he defeats with Pikachu's Electro Ball. Iris battles a Trainer named Tatsuki and his Emboar with her Emolga, but Emolga uses Volt Switch, forcing Excadrill to come out in its place, against the rules; the referee promptly awards the match to Tatsuki. Juanita's daughter, Carlita, and her Hydreigon (Shiny in White—Victini and Zekrom) quickly dispatches of Cilan's Pansage. Ash and Oshawott later battle Tatsuki and defeat Emboar with Aqua Jet.\n\nAsh sends Tepig to face Leeku and his Samurott, and Samurott's Razor Shell effortlessly smashes Tepig into Juanita's stand of Victini trinkets. However, Victini covertly appears and powers up Tepig, allowing it to defeat Samurott with an absurdly powerful Ember. Carlita witnesses this, and, becoming suspicious, challenges Ash. When Ash's Scraggy attempts to Headbutt Hydreigon, it is knocked into the trees. Carlita sees Victini give Scraggy a powerup, after which Scraggy quickly defeats Hydreigon with a second Headbutt. Carlita surrenders her necklace to the judge, and then confronts Ash, informing the group of Victini's role.\n\nSuspicious that Victini was the one who stole the macarons, Ash uses one to bait it out. It appears, and Ash excitedly tries to befriend it. Victini is initially receptive and playful but becomes alarmed as Ash swings it around enthusiastically, leaving the Pokémon of the group to coax Victini back to them. As the party travels through town, Victini hesitates in the shadow of giant pillars. Ash tries to force Victini forward, but Victini gets clobbered by a magical barrier around the castle area, delineated by the pillars and preventing Victini's escape. Upset, Victini flees back towards the castle. Later, while looking for Victini with Juanita and Carlita, they run into Mannes and Damon. It is revealed that Damon is Juanita's son and Carlita's older brother. He has been traveling and has not contacted Juanita in some time, which she reprimands him for. Carlita attempts to cheer him by telling him about Victini's appearance, but he says he already knew.\n\nAt Mannes's home, Victini is found leading a group of other Pokémon. Inside, Mannes relays the legend of the tribe now known as the People of the Vale: one thousand years ago, they were prosperous people who lived in a place called the Kingdom of the Vale, in a valley where the Sword of the Vale originally resided. They used a power in the earth called the Dragon Force to enrich their land, and all was well. However, one day, the twin sons of the king—the Hero of Truth, who controlled Reshiram, and the Hero of Ideals, who controlled Zekrom—began a war over their beliefs. Reshiram and Zekrom battled and drained each other's strength, and then turned into orbs called Dragon Stones. The kingdom was devastated, and the Dragon Force corrupted and chaotic, ravaging the earth instead of healing it. Desperate, the king asked Victini to lend him its power, and he created the Pillars of Protection and their barrier to control the flow of that power. Using this system, the king flew the Sword of the Vale, with all of the townspeople inside, out of the Kingdom of the Vale to a nearby mountaintop. There, the castle calmed the flow of the Dragon Force. However, soon after the castle landed, the king died, while the Pillars of Protection remained. The two regretful princes hid the Dragon Stones deep within the caverns of the Sword of the Vale.\n\nWhile watching Ash and his friends play with Victini, Damon informs his mother that her dream—that the People of the Vale could one day live again in the Kingdom of the Vale, as relayed in a flashback—can now come true. He intends to borrow Victini's power just as the king did, and return the Sword of the Vale to its rightful place. Inside, without Ash and his friends, Damon relays his journeys over the past three years. Damon visited the scattered tribal settlements of the People of the Vale to try to find support for his dream to reclaim the land that was the Kingdom of the Vale. He was always rebuffed, until one day he heard a voice emanating from the chambers under the Sword of the Vale. He and Mannes investigated, walking on a crystal path when, inexplicably, the two found themselves separated onto different paths. Damon went on alone to find his Legendary dragon, and with it as his ally, he demonstrated the truth of the legend and his dragon's power by helping the leaders of the settlements. (Here, each version of the movie briefly shows Damon's dragon in the area from the opening of the other version—Reshiram assisting in the desert in White—Victini and Zekrom, and Zekrom in the tundra in Black—Victini and Reshiram.) The leaders agreed to help him—and as if on cue, they appear in Mannes's study in support of Damon's goal: the resurrection of the Kingdom of the Vale.\n\nVictini dreams about its millennium trapped in the Pillars of Protection, witnessing the establishment and growth of Eindoak Town. The dream ends with the spirit of the king returning to apologize for the trap, then saying goodbye and fading away; Ash inexplicably experiences the dream as well and is awoken. Victini takes Ash, Iris, and Cilan to a balcony, where it shows them the sunrise over an ocean shore; Ash comes to understand that Victini wishes to go to the shore, and promises to take it.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Sword of the Vale, Juanita and Carlita watch as Damon prepares to execute his plan on the observation deck of the castle. He sends out his Sigilyph, and it takes its place in a mechanism atop the chamber. Sigilyph's power awakens the thousands of Solosis and Duosion in the lower chambers of the castle, and in turn, the Pillars of Protection activate, rise, and begin to travel towards the castle. Alarmed, Victini flees from the ever-constricting barrier, eventually flying to the castle, where Damon requests that it lend him its power. As Damon reminds Victini of the king, it is briefly cooperative until it gets caught in another, smaller barrier. The smaller pillars force it into a mechanism that begins draining Victini's power, using it to power up the Solosis and Duosion. As Ash, Iris, and Cilan arrive, the castle slowly ascends into the sky, and the healthy Dragon Force flows out, returning to the Kingdom of the Vale and beginning to restore it.\n\nAsh, Iris, Cilan, Juanita, and Carlita rush into the main chamber and find Damon torturing Victini. Horrified that this was her son's plan, Juanita demands he stop, which shocks and upsets him. When Ash attempts to destroy the machine draining Victini's power, Damon attacks the group with his Reuniclus or Gothitelle. Damon's Reshiram or Zekrom then arrives, and Juanita attempts to fight the dragon with Golurk, but Golurk is defeated easily. Ash once again tries to climb the mechanism, but Damon's Psychic-type Pokémon knocks him out.\n\nWhile unconscious, Ash receives a vision from Victini, of the king warning Victini to never let the Sword of the Vale be moved again, because if it is, the Dragon Force would return to run amok, causing a repeat of the disaster that struck the Kingdom of the Vale, and threatening the entire world. This has already begun, but with the castle now above the clouds, Damon and his dragon are unaware of it happening. Ash awakens in the cellar of the castle, and Juanita begs him to forgive Damon, as he truly believes he is doing the right thing. She then reveals that one thing can stop Damon's dragon: the other dragon, which should still be deep in the castle's dungeons, where had Ash passed through at the beginning of the film. As the group explores the crystal cavern, Ash and Pikachu soon find themselves suddenly separated, as Damon had been; Ash and Pikachu go on alone. A voice challenges Ash, and then the paths begin to collapse, forcing him to the bottom of the cavern. There, he finds the Dragon Stone, and hears a voice asking him for his ideal (White—Victini and Zekrom) or truth (Black—Victini and Reshiram). He answers that he wants to save Victini and fulfill his promise, satisfying the voice, which reveals itself to be Zekrom (in White—Victini and Zekrom) or Reshiram (in Black—Victini and Reshiram).\n\nMannes arrives and meets Juanita, Carlita, Iris, and Cilan, having flown to the castle in a helicopter powered by his Klink, Klang, and Klinklang. He warns the group of the disaster on the surface, but by now they already know. Golurk returns to again fight Reshiram or Zekrom, but fails; however, the dragon's finishing blow is deflected by its opposite, which arrives with Ash riding on it. Ash jumps off at the courtyard of the castle, and then Zekrom and Reshiram engage in an epic battle in the sky. Inside the castle, Pikachu engages Reuniclus or Gothitelle.\n\nFinally, Ash's dragon defeats Damon's, forcing it below the clouds, where they both witness the unfolding tragedy of the deadly Dragon Force. Pikachu defeats Reuniclus or Gothitelle and Ash climbs the mechanism, but Damon's dragon returns before he can destroy the barrier around Victini. Damon orders it to stop Ash, but it ignores him and instead destroys the mechanism to free Victini. Damon's dragon explains to him that it has heard the \"land's anger\", and then the two dragons blow away the clouds, revealing to Damon the devastation that the Dragon Force has caused. Panicking, Damon immediately becomes remorseful and begs Reshiram and Zekrom to help him stop the disaster. They agree, \"lending their power\" and redirecting some of the destructive Dragon Force into the Sword of the Vale—this powers up the Pokémon inside much more than Victini did, but also causes the mechanisms throughout the castle to become erratic, including the castle's flight.\n\nDamon directs his family, Mannes, and Ash's group to leave immediately, fearing that the castle may crumble. Damon, meanwhile, insists that he will stay until the disaster is averted and the world is saved. However, when Ash tries to flee, the barrier generated by the Pillars of Protection continues to trap Victini inside, and Ash refuses to leave without it. Iris escapes with Carlita on Hydreigon's back, while Cilan and Juanita board Mannes's helicopter. As the pillars close in, the castle rocks, and Damon is thrown from it. Without warning, the Sword rapidly ascends into the sky, uncontrolled. All the Psychic-type Pokémon flee, leaving Ash, Pikachu, and Victini alone in the castle.\n\nHigh in the Earth's atmosphere, the castle begins to frost over, and the thin, cold air begins to take a toll on Ash. Damon appears, saved by and now riding his mother's Golurk, while Reshiram and Zekrom attack the Pillars of Protection. But as the pillars are attacked, they are knocked towards each other, constricting even further around Victini. The pillars soon collide and close completely in the castle's courtyard, trapping Ash, Pikachu, and Victini within their walls. Damon tells Ash to hold on, as he is one of the dragons' chosen, and in a desperate bid to save them, Golurk fruitlessly tries to pry the pillars apart with its hands. Reshiram and Zekrom continue to destroy the pillars, but now several layers of pillars are in the way, and it proves too time-consuming. Inside the prison created by the Pillars of Protection, a weak and delirious Ash sadly apologizes to Victini for failing in his promise to take it to the ocean, before it becomes so cold that Ash's tears freeze and he falls unconscious.\n\nVictini decides to use Searing Shot, which is too weak to break apart the pillars, but Ash is warmed and wakes up due to the attack. He witnesses Victini summoning up all of its power to activate V-create, its ultimate move. This finally destroys the Pillars of Protection once and for all, and the chaotic Dragon Force gets ejected into space—but Victini is nowhere to be seen. With the barrier and Dragon Force gone, Damon re-enters the castle and wraps Ash in a blanket that helps keep him alive.\n\nLater, with Reshiram, Zekrom, and Golurk pushing the castle, Damon steers the castle down to the advancing tendril of the deadly Dragon Force. Just as Ash wakes up, he lands the Sword, calming the Dragon Force before it can destroy the entire planet. On the beach, Ash, Iris, and Cilan stare out at the ocean, saddened by the apparent death of Victini. Believing that Victini sacrificed itself to destroy the Pillars of Protection and save him, Ash apologizes again before flinging one of Cilan's macarons toward the ocean. However, the macaron suddenly stops in mid-air and is eaten—and Victini reveals itself to be very much alive, now freed from the barrier just as it always dreamed.\n\nDamon falls to his knees, overwhelmed with guilt that his actions had backfired so badly. However, Juanita consoles him by telling him they will have a lot of work to do to rebuild the Kingdom of the Vale. Victini sends Ash a vision of it helping with the rebuilding, and he understands that their time together is at an end. Bidding farewell to Damon, Juanita, Carlita, Mannes, and the other People of the Vale, Ash, Iris, and Cilan depart for new adventures.\n\nDuring the credits, Damon and Juanita lead the People of the Vale in their reconstruction efforts. A single sprout is seen on the once dead land in the Kingdom of the Vale, implying that the area can indeed be revived. While traveling, Ash, Iris, and Cilan get caught in a windstorm created by Tornadus (in White—Victini and Zekrom) or a thunderstorm caused by Thundurus (in Black—Victini and Reshiram). They later travel through a town where the Team Rocket trio watches them from a café, with Peg passing by as well. Reshiram and Zekrom continue flying throughout the world, appearing in the skies in a variety of places.\n\nFeatured Pokémon\n\nReshiram\n\nZekrom\n\nVictini\n\nMajor events\n\nFor a list of all major events in the anime, please see the history page.\n\nDebuts\n\nVictini\n\nSerperior\n\nEmboar\n\nSamurott\n\nSigilyph\n\nDuosion\n\nReuniclus\n\nHydreigon\n\nDeerling (Autumn form; Summer form)\n\nSawsbuck (Autumn form; Summer form)\n\nKlink\n\nKlang\n\nKlinklang\n\nRufflet\n\nBraviary\n\nTirtouga\n\nCarracosta\n\nCinccino\n\nGothorita\n\nHeatmor\n\nJellicent\n\nKrookodile\n\nPurrloin\n\nLiepard\n\nPetilil\n\nLilligant\n\nMandibuzz\n\nThroh\n\nSawk\n\nSeismitoad\n\nTynamo\n\nEelektrik\n\nUnfezant\n\nWhimsicott\n\nThundurus (Incarnate Forme)\n\nTornadus (Incarnate Forme)\n\nVolcarona\n\nCharacters\n\nHumans\n\nAsh\n\nIris\n\nCilan\n\nJessie\n\nJames\n\nDamon\n\nCarlita\n\nJuanita\n\nMannes\n\nRavine\n\nLuisa\n\nManuke\n\nGlacine\n\nLuis\n\nDonuke\n\nMako\n\nTatsuki\n\nLeeku\n\nKing of the People of the Vale\n\nHero of Truth\n\nHero of Ideals\n\nTrainers\n\nEindoak Town referee\n\nCitizens\n\nPeople of the Vale\n\nPeg\n\nMother and daughter\n\nPokémon\n\nPikachu (Ash's)\n\nMeowth (Team Rocket)\n\nAxew (Iris's)\n\nOshawott (Ash's)\n\nTepig (Ash's)\n\nScraggy (Ash's)\n\nExcadrill (Iris's)\n\nEmolga (Iris's)\n\nPansage (Cilan's)\n\nSigilyph (Damon's)\n\nSolosis (Damon's; multiple)\n\nDuosion (Damon's; multiple)\n\nGolurk (Juanita's; Shiny in Black—Victini and Reshiram)\n\nHydreigon (Carlita's; Shiny in White—Victini and Zekrom)\n\nBlitzle (Luisa's)\n\nLillipup (Luis's)\n\nKlink (Mannes's)\n\nKlang (Mannes's)\n\nKlinklang (Mannes's)\n\nSerperior (Mako's)\n\nEmboar (Tatsuki's)\n\nSamurott (Leeku's)\n\nGothita (Trainer's)\n\nGothorita (Trainer's)\n\nVictini (wild)\n\nZekrom (wild)\n\nReshiram (wild)\n\nAlomomola (multiple)\n\nAudino\n\nBraviary\n\nCarracosta\n\nCinccino (flashback)\n\nDeerling (Autumn Form; intro; Summer Form; multiple)\n\nSawsbuck (Summer Form; multiple; intro and credits)\n\nDrilbur (multiple)\n\nTynamo (multiple)\n\nEelektrik (multiple)\n\nEelektross\n\nHerdier (flashback)\n\nMandibuzz\n\nMinccino\n\nPatrat (multiple)\n\nPidove (multiple)\n\nTranquill (multiple)\n\nTympole (multiple)\n\nPalpitoad (multiple)\n\nSeismitoad\n\nSigilyph\n\nDucklett (multiple)\n\nSwanna (multiple; intro in Black—Victini and Reshiram; multiple; credits in White—Victini and Zekrom)\n\nWoobat (multiple)\n\nSwoobat (multiple)\n\nTirtouga (multiple)\n\nTrubbish\n\nCottonee (multiple)\n\nWhimsicott (multiple)\n\nVolcarona\n\nMunna (multiple; flashback)\n\nMusharna (multiple; flashback)\n\nDarmanitan (multiple; flashback)\n\nSigilyph (multiple; flashback)\n\nReuniclus (multiple; flashback)\n\nLilligant (multiple; flashback)\n\nStunfisk (intro)\n\nCredits only\n\nTranquill (Ash's)\n\nSnivy (Ash's)\n\nSwadloon (Ash's)\n\nDwebble (Cilan's)\n\nStunfisk (Cilan's)\n\nExclusive to White—Victini and Zekrom\n\nReuniclus (Damon's)\n\nEelektross (intro)\n\nBasculin (Blue-Striped form; multiple)\n\nBouffalant (multiple; intro)\n\nDarmanitan (Standard Mode; intro)\n\nFrillish (female; multiple; intro)\n\nHeatmor (intro)\n\nJellicent (female; multiple; intro)\n\nLilligant (multiple; intro)\n\nRufflet (multiple; intro)\n\nThroh\n\nTornadus (credits)\n\nUnfezant (male and female; multiple; intro)\n\nExclusive to Black—Victini and Reshiram\n\nGothitelle (Damon's)\n\nStunfisk (intro)\n\nArchen (multiple; intro)\n\nArcheops (multiple; intro)\n\nBasculin (Red-Striped form; multiple; intro)\n\nFrillish (male; multiple; intro)\n\nJellicent (male; multiple; intro)\n\nKrookodile (intro)\n\nLiepard (multiple; intro)\n\nBeartic (multiple; intro)\n\nStoutland\n\nSawk\n\nSawsbuck (Autumn Form; multiple; intro)\n\nThundurus (credits)\n\nZebstrika (multiple; intro)\n\nCast\n\nCast Ash Sarah Natochenny Satoshi Rica Matsumoto サトシ 松本梨香 Pikachu Ikue Ohtani Pikachu Ikue Ohtani ピカチュウ 大谷育江 Iris Eileen Stevens Iris Aoi Yūki アイリス 悠木碧 Axew Kayzie Rogers Kibago Minami Tsuda キバゴ 津田美波 Cilan Jason Griffith Dent Mamoru Miyano デント 宮野 真守 Jessie Michele Knotz Musashi Megumi Hayashibara ムサシ 林原めぐみ James Carter Cathcart Kojirō Shin-ichiro Miki コジロウ 三木眞一郎 Meowth Carter Cathcart Nyarth Inuko Inuyama ニャース 犬山イヌコ Narrator Rodger Parsons Narrator Unshō Ishizuka ナレーション 石塚運昇 Oshawott Lisa Ortiz Mijumaru Misato Fukuen ミジュマル 福圓美里 Tepig Marc Thompson Chaoboo Wasabi Mizuta チャオブー 水田わさび Scraggy Jason Griffith Zuruggu Akeno Watanabe ズルッグ 渡辺明乃 Emolga Mika Kanai Emonga Mika Kanai エモンガ かないみか Pansage Eli James Yanappu Chika Fujimura ヤナップ 藤村知可 Special appearances by Damon J.

Ash befriends said Pokémon in those movies, with Damon using the other Pokémon.\n\nThe World of Pokémon intro, while stylistically the same in both movies, features different Pokémon depending on the version.\n\nDuring the World of Pokémon intro, Pikachu is seen battling a Throh in White—Victini and Zekrom, while in Black—Victini and Reshiram, he battles a Sawk.\n\nAsh, Iris, and Cilan come to a fork in the road at the beginning of both movies. In White—Victini and Zekrom, they take the left path, while in Black—Victini and Reshiram, they take the right path.\n\nRight after the title sequence, Ash spots a Flying-type Pokémon soaring in the air while walking on a trail with Iris and Cilan. In White—Victini and Zekrom, it is Braviary, while in Black—Victini and Reshiram, it is Mandibuzz.\n\nPokémon that appear in the background differ depending on the version.\n\nDamon's appearance differs between the two movies.\n\nDamon's Pokémon is Reuniclus in White—Victini and Zekrom, while in Black—Victini and Reshiram, it is Gothitelle.\n\nDamon travels through the desert in White—Victini and Zekrom (with Bouffalant and the Blitzle evolutionary line appearing in the area), and an icy plain in Black—Victini and Reshiram (where Beartic and Stoutland are in the area, the latter of which are used by the residents).\n\nIn White—Victini and Zekrom, Carlita's Hydreigon is a Shiny Pokémon, and Juanita's Golurk is colored normally, whereas in Black—Victini and Reshiram, this is reversed, with Golurk being the Pokémon who is Shiny.\n\nNumerous scenes are altered in various ways between the two movies. For example, the scene of Damon and Mannes talking at the ruins of the Kingdom of the Vale takes place during the day in White—Victini and Zekrom but at night in Black—Victini and Reshiram. Other scenes throughout the movies are mirrored.\n\nSome small scenes appear only in one version or the other.\n\nThe background music differs depending on the version, due to having different music composers for each movie. The ending theme also differs, with The Sky in White—Victini and Zekrom and The Voice in Black—Victini and Reshiram.\n\nIn the ending credits, in White—Victini and Zekrom, Tornadus creates a windstorm that is encountered by Ash and friends; in Black—Victini and Reshiram, Thundurus creates a thunderstorm that is encountered by Ash and friends.\n\nComparison gallery\n\nWorld of Pokémon in White—Victini and Zekrom\n\nWorld of Pokémon in Black—Victini and Reshiram\n\nAsh's Pikachu battling a Throh in White—Victini and Zekrom\n\nAsh's Pikachu battling a Sawk Black—Victini and Reshiram\n\nDamon preparing to stop many stampeding Bouffalant in White—Victini and Zekrom\n\nDamon preparing to stop an iceberg in Black—Victini and Reshiram\n\nEvents\n\nPre-order distribution\n\nA special Victini was available to people who pre-ordered tickets to the film in Japan. This Victini knew the previously-unobtainable move V-create, as well as its other signature move, Searing Shot, and the signature moves of Reshiram and Zekrom, Fusion Flare and Fusion Bolt.\n\nMovie distributions\n\nZekrom was made available for players of Black and Reshiram for players of White. Both will have the original Trainer サトシ Satoshi. Both dragons are at level 100 and know their signature moves, Blue Flare and Fusion Flare, and Bolt Strike and Fusion Bolt, respectively. Also, Reshiram knows Mist and Zekrom knows Haze, due to the Japanese names for these moves being しろいきり White Mist and くろいきり Black Mist, respectively, as well as Outrage.\n\nOther distributions\n\nUsers of the Japanese-language Global Link could obtain a C-Gear skin featuring Victini.\n\nPlayers of Japanese or Korean Black games could obtain a Shiny Hydreigon, based on Carlita's, while players of Japanese or Korean White games could obtain a Shiny Golurk, based on Juanita's.\n\nUsers of the Japanese-language Global Link can also obtain one of two C-Gear skins featuring Reshiram or Zekrom, depending on which Pokémon they put to sleep before taking them to the Eindoak Home, which, much like the Pokémon Café Home, is another event exclusive.\n\nTrailers\n\nEnglish\n\nPokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom\n\nBy\n\nThis video is not available on Bulbapedia; instead, you can watch the video on YouTube here.\n\nPokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram\n\nBy\n\nThis video is not available on Bulbapedia; instead, you can watch the video on YouTube here.\n\nBoth movies\n\nBy\n\nThis video is not available on Bulbapedia; instead, you can watch the video on YouTube here.\n\nManga adaptation\n\nMain article: White—Victini and Zekrom (manga)\n\nTrivia\n\nThese movies were released between BW039 and BW040 in Japan. However, it chronologically takes place sometime before the aforementioned episodes as they are placed in the middle of the Club Battle arc. It also cannot take place after that arc, as Team Rocket had begun their preparations for their Nimbasa Subway System plan during that time, preparations that continue up to its fruition in BW047.\n\nHad these episodes aired when originally intended, with their air-dates not being brought forward due to the postponement of the unaired two-parter, the movie would have likely premiered between BW037 (or BW036, as the former was, itself, delayed from an earlier date) and BW038.[1]\n\nDirector Yuyama Kunihiko scouted locations in France (including Nice, Gourdon, Tourrettes-sur-Loup, and Mont Saint-Michel) as part of pre-production for this movie.\n\nThese are the first movies in which Brock does not appear at all; he made a cameo appearance in The Power of One.\n\nIf both versions are counted together, these films debut 34 new Pokémon, more than any other movie in the series.\n\nAs of this movie, all forms of the Unova first partner Pokémon have appeared in the anime.\n\nThis is chronologically the first time where Cilan shows his fear of Purrloin.\n\nThis is the first movie in which no Generation II Pokémon appear.\n\nSeveral short scenes were removed from the Cartoon Network airing of Black—Victini and Reshiram on December 10, 2011 to reduce the film's total running time. These included the appearance of Gothita, Gothorita, and their Trainer; the entrances of several of the Pokémon in Mannes's garden such as Cottonee; a shot of Damon's face as he explains his plans for the People of the Vale; Mannes's Klink and Klang installing themselves in the music machine; and a shot of Luisa peering through the door to watch Damon talk to Ravine.\n\nSeveral of these scenes were restored for the February 11, 2012 airing of White—Victini and Zekrom, but other additional cuts were made.\n\nThe mother and daughter characters first shown in Lucario in the Mystery of Mew make a cameo in these movies as well, appearing right after Ash defeated Tatsuki.\n\nThis is the first Pokémon movie to be available in its original Japanese version on Blu-ray, released in December 2011. It was beaten by the double film release of the English dubs of Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias and Destiny Deoxys.\n\nThis is the only Pokémon the Series: Black & White movie to feature a human antagonist.\n\nErrors\n\nIn both movies, just before Victini reveals itself to the group, Ash asks Victini if it lent him its powers. When Ash says this, his lips do not move with the rest of his mouth.\n\nIn the English dub, the voice of a Reuniclus can be heard in many scenes involving the Solosis and Duosion in the castle despite the fact that Reuniclus can only be seen there during flashback scenes to the Kingdom of the Vale.\n\nIn the Polish dub of Black—Victini and Reshiram, Damon refers to the found stone as Light Stone instead of Dark Stone.\n\nDub edits\n\nThe title card sequence removes the animation of Zekrom or Reshiram unfolding its wings.\n\nBest Wishes! is replaced by Black and White as the opening theme.\n\nThe Sky and The Voice are replaced as the ending songs by Follow Your Star (Ideals Mix) in White-Victini and Zekrom, and Follow Your Star (Truth Mix) in Black-Victini and Reshiram.\n\nWhen White-Victini and Zekrom premiered in theaters in 2011, there was a notice shown on the screen to check out Black—Victini and Reshiram on Cartoon Network, which is not present in any other version.\n\nThe cut of White—Victini and Zekrom that aired on Cartoon Network on February 11, 2012 featured several edits to the credits at the beginning and end of the film: the opening credits were moved to the World of Pokémon segment, the Black and White Theme sequence was therefore textless, and the closing credits were played over a black screen without any of the clips normally featured.\n\nIn the titles of these films in Japanese, the version color names match the color of the dragon Ash allies himself with in the film. These are inverted in the dub to match the game version Ash's dragon in that film can be captured in.\n\nIn other languages\n\nReferences\n\nPokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom\n\nPokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom on Prime Video (English)\n\nPokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom on Google Play (English)\n\nPokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom on iTunes (English)\n\nOfficial website for Pokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom (English; archive)\n\nPokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom on Pokémon.com (English)\n\nPokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram\n\nPokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram on Prime Video (English)\n\nPokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram on Google Play (English)\n\nPokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram on iTunes (English)\n\nOfficial website for Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram (English; archive)\n\nPokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram on Pokémon.com (English)\n\nBoth movies\n\nPokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom and Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram at Wikipedia\n\nPokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom and Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram at IMDB\n\nOfficial website for Pokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom and Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram (Japanese)\n\nOfficial website for Pokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom and Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram (Taiwanese)\n\nPokémon movies Original series Mewtwo Strikes Back • The Power of One • Spell of the Unown: Entei • Celebi: The Voice of the Forest • Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire Jirachi: Wish Maker • Destiny Deoxys • Lucario and the Mystery of Mew • Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl The Rise of Darkrai • Giratina and the Sky Warrior • Arceus and the Jewel of Life • Zoroark: Master of Illusions Pokémon the Series: Black & White White—Victini and Zekrom / Black—Victini and Reshiram • Kyurem VS.
