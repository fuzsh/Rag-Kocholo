        "text": "“The subject of color seems to have almost endless ramifications\n\nand to touch upon life in almost every quarter, for color is rich in lore,\n\nrich in meaning and purpose.” – Faber Birren\n\nThere is a large array of emotional responses that are associated with colors. Some of these are obvious, some obscure. Certain associations are specific to a country or region, while others are universally recognized—being rooted in human anatomy or observable natural phenomena. Some colors can have different meanings, even opposing meanings, based entirely on context and application.\n\nWhile there are many, many factors that come into play when coming up with a design’s color, this should certainly be one of them. By knowing that red and yellow are the most visually attention-grabbing colors, you might design a better billboard. Knowing that blue signifies knowledge may help decide the color of a library’s logo. Like most things related to design, these aren’t rules set in concrete but rather one more tool that you can use or intentionally violate to deliver your intended message.\n\nIn this article, I’ve collected and summarized the emotions and concepts associated with the six basic colors, plus black and white. I’ve tried to make it as definitive as possible and included numerous examples, but the more you study this subject, the more you will find. The most definitive texts on the subject, in my opinion, are the books of Faber Birren, who was a consultant on color and color theory and put out numerous books on the subject.\n\nWith that caveat, you should find this article comprehensive and useful in design, photography and illustration. And if you do find something missing, please feel free to leave a comment.\n\n(Note on Character Studies: I’ve included these as I found them interesting, not because I believe they are accurate or true. And aside from being an interesting read, they also may be of use to character designers or costume designers who are having trouble figuring out the color choices of their characters.)\n\nCONTENTS\n\nRed\n\nGreen\n\nYellow\n\nBlue\n\nBlack\n\nWhite\n\nOrange\n\nPurple\n\nColor Combinations\n\nRED\n\n“At once, red is the passionate and ardent hue of the spectrum, marking the saint and the sinner, patriotism and anarchy, love and hatred, compassion and war.” – Faber Birren\n\nWarmth, anger, crudity, excitement, power, strength, love, passion, fire, blood, extreme emotions, battle. Red is supposed to prompt impulse buying. It has been used by the church to give the feeling of pomp and circumstance. In history it represents royalty, majesty and triumph. Usually thought of as a violent and exciting color.\n\nEmotional Response\n\nRed is a very emotionally intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stoplights, and fire equipment are usually painted red. In heraldry, red is used to indicate courage. It is a color found in many national flags.\n\nUse in Design & Advertising\n\nRed brings text and images to the foreground. It is used to stimulate people to make quick decisions; it is a perfect color for ‘Buy Now’ or ‘Click Here’ buttons on Internet banners and websites. In advertising, red is often used to evoke erotic feelings (red lips, red nails, red-light districts, ‘Lady in Red’, etc). Red is widely used to indicate danger (high-voltage signs, traffic lights). This color is also commonly associated with energy, so would be appropriate when promoting energy drinks, games, cars and other items related to sports and high physical activity.\n\nAssociated Meanings\n\nGeneral Appearance: Brilliant, intense, opaque, dry\n\nMental Associations: Hot, fire, heat, blood\n\nDirection Associations: Danger, Christmas, Fourth of July, Valentines Day, Mother’s Day, Flag\n\nObjective Impressions: Passionate, exciting, fervent, active\n\nSubjective Impressions: Intensity, rage, rapacity, fierceness\n\nSignifies: strength, health, vigor, lust, danger\n\nHoliday: Yule\n\nPlanet: Mars\n\nDay: Tuesday\n\nAstrological: Scorpio\n\nColor Shape\n\nRed suggests the form of the square and the cube. It is hot, dry and opaque in quality. It is solid and substantial. It is extremely advancing and holds the strongest of all attractions to stimulus. Because it is sharply focused by the eye, it lends itself to structural planes and sharp angles.\n\nCharacter Study\n\nHere is the vital color. Love red in a big and generous way and you have real courage before life. You are vigorous and given to action, for life means much to you. Do you like sports? Are you inclined to be very positive in what you have to say?\n\nIn affairs of the heart you are rather likely to be fickle. Because of your eagerness for excitement you may break many old hearts in your glamorous efforts to win new ones. But people who understand you recognize that you are a very human person, after all, and will more readily forgive your faults than you will forgive theirs.\n\nYou are quick to judge people. First impressions count with you and very often cause you to act emotionally rather than mentally.\n\nRelated Colors\n\nLight red represents joy, sexuality, passion, sensitivity, and love.\n\nPink signifies romance, love, and friendship. It denotes feminine qualities and passiveness.\n\nDark red is associated with vigor, willpower, rage, anger, leadership, courage, longing, malice, and wrath.\n\nBrown suggests stability and denotes masculine qualities.\n\nReddish-brown is associated with harvest and fall.\n\nExamples\n\nBack to Top\n\nGREEN\n\nSpring, the macabre, freshness, mystery, envy, hope, eternal life. Being composed of yellow and blue, green presents the feeling of light and coolness, cheer and restraint. It is the color of nature as usually seen. Green alleviates tension and implies restfulness.\n\nEmotional Response\n\nGreen supposedly has healing power. It is the most restful color for the human eye; it can improve vision. Green suggests stability and endurance. Sometimes green denotes lack of experience; for example, a ‘greenhorn’ is a novice. In heraldry, green indicates growth and hope. Green, as opposed to red, means safety; it is the color of free passage in road traffic.\n\nUse in Design & Advertising\n\nGreen is used to indicate safety when advertising drugs and medical products. Green is directly related to nature, so is used to promote ‘green’ or natural products. Dull, darker green is associated with money, the financial world, banking, Wall Street.\n\nAssociated Meanings\n\nGeneral Appearance: Clear, moist\n\nMental Associations: Cool, nature, water\n\nDirection Associations: Clear, Saint Patrick’s Day\n\nObjective Impressions: Quieting, refreshing, peaceful, growing\n\nSubjective Impressions: Repulsiveness, disease, terror, guilt\n\nSignifies: finances, fertility, luck, success, charity, growth, rejuvenation, ambition, greed and jealousy, plant kingdom, herbal healing\n\nPlanets: Venus, Mercury\n\nDays: Friday, Wednesday\n\nHolidays: Spring Equinox, Beltane, Saint Patrick’s Day\n\nAstrological: Taurus\n\nColor Shape\n\nGreen suggests the form of the hexagon or the icosahedron. It is cool, fresh, soft. It is not sharply focused and therefore does not lend itself to much angularity. It is a big color and can dominate the eye without distressing it.\n\nCharacter Study\n\nThis is nature’s color, preferred by human beings who are likewise fresh and natural in personality. If you like green, you are sure to have a rather broad interest in the world, to be aware of the problems of life, to be tolerant and somewhat liberal.\n\nBecause your mind is clear and full of varied attentions, you are an agreeable person. You like to play bridge, to shop, to read all the best-selling books. You respect money and are anxious to improve your standard of living. In this, perhaps, you are like many others. Yet the chief difference in you is that you delight in friends, travel, sensible luxuries, without being either miserly or inclined to put on a false front. You are good and normal, and relish the scandals of others while carefully avoiding them within your own household.\n\nRelated Colors\n\nDark green is associated with ambition, greed, and jealousy.\n\nYellow-green can indicate sickness, cowardice, discord, and jealousy.\n\nAqua is associated with emotional healing and protection.\n\nOlive green is the traditional color of peace and ironically a color common in military uniforms.\n\nExamples\n\nBack to Top\n\nYELLOW\n\nValue, sunlight, the Orient, treachery, brilliance, joy. Being nearest to sunlight, it is connected with cheer and springtime. Yellow claims attention first and fastest and sits alongside red as the most obvious and vibrant color.\n\nEmotional Response\n\nYellow produces a warming effect, arouses cheerfulness, stimulates mental activity, and generates muscle energy. Yellow is often associated with food. Bright, pure yellow is an attention getter, which is the reason taxicabs are painted this color. When overused, yellow may have a disturbing effect; it is known that babies cry more in yellow rooms. Yellow is seen before other colors when placed against black; this combination is often used to issue a warning. In heraldry, yellow indicates honor and loyalty. Later the meaning of yellow was connected with cowardice.\n\nUse in Design & Advertising\n\nUse yellow to evoke pleasant, cheerful feelings. You can choose yellow to promote children’s products and items related to leisure. Yellow is very effective for attracting attention, so use it to highlight the most important elements of your design. Men usually perceive yellow as a very lighthearted, ‘childish’ color, so it is not recommended to use yellow when selling prestigious, expensive products to men—nobody will buy a yellow business suit or a yellow Mercedes. Yellow is an unstable and spontaneous color, so avoid using yellow if you want to suggest stability and safety. Light yellow tends to disappear into white, so it usually needs a dark color to highlight it. Shades of yellow are visually unappealing because they loose cheerfulness and become dingy.\n\nAssociated Meanings\n\nGeneral Appearance: Sunny, incandescent, radiant\n\nMental Associations: Sunlight\n\nDirection Associations: Caution\n\nObjective Impressions: Cheerful, inspiring, vital, celestial\n\nSubjective Impressions: High spirit, health\n\nSignifies: knowledge, learning, concentration, persuasion, charm, confidence, jealousy, joy, comfort\n\nPlanet: Mercury\n\nDay: Wednesday\n\nAstrological: Gemini, Leo\n\nColor Shape\n\nYellow suggests the form of the triangle or the pyramid, with its apex down. It is the color of highest visibility in the spectrum and therefore sharp, angular and crisp in quality; but it is more celestial than wordly. It is without solid base, lofty and reaches upward into space.\n\nCharacter Study\n\nThis hue is often picked as a favorite color by very intelligent people. If you like yellow, you are probably high-minded and, perhaps, a person who is drawn into reforms or strange groups.\n\nYou have a beautifully controlled temper. Yet the temper is there, nonetheless, and you are quite capable of putting people in their places if you feel so moved. People you meet for the first time may not always think you the most friendly soul in the world; but those who know you intimately will respect and cherish your profound character.\n\nYou long secretly for the admiration of others. While you outwardly resist flattery, you inwardly glory in it. You are inclined to live alone mentally. You are a true friend and a rare soul who can keep secrets.\n\nRelated Colors\n\nDull (dingy) yellow represents caution, decay, sickness, and jealousy.\n\nLight yellow is associated with intellect, freshness, and joy.\n\nExamples\n\nBack to Top\n\nBLUE\n\nBlue is usually associated with knowledge and serenity. Coolness, ethereality, the infinite, significance, repose, formality. It is associated with the sky, the ocean and ice. It has always been the symbol of truth and purity. Loyalty, compassion, connotes serenity.\n\nEmotional Response\n\nBlue is considered beneficial to the mind and body. It slows human metabolism and produces a calming effect. Blue is strongly associated with tranquility and calmness. In heraldry, blue is used to symbolize piety and sincerity.\n\nUse in Design & Advertising\n\nYou can use blue to promote products and services related to cleanliness (water purification filters, cleaning liquids, vodka), air and sky (airlines, airports, air conditioners), water and sea (sea voyages, mineral water). As opposed to emotionally warm colors like red, orange, and yellow; blue is linked to consciousness and intellect. Use blue to suggest precision when promoting high-tech products. Blue is a masculine color; according to studies, it is highly accepted among males. Dark blue is associated with depth, expertise, and stability; it is a preferred color for corporate America and by survey is the “favorite” color.\n\nAvoid using blue when promoting food and cooking, because blue suppresses appetite. When used together with warm colors like yellow or red, blue can create high-impact, vibrant designs; for example, blue-yellow-red is a perfect color scheme for a superhero.\n\nAssociated Meanings\n\nGeneral Appearance: Transparent, wet\n\nMental Associations: Cold, sky, water, ice\n\nDirection Associations: Service, flag\n\nObjective Impressions: Subduing, melancholy, contemplative, sober\n\nSubjective Impressions: Gloom, fearfulness, secrecy\n\nSignifies: tranquility, understanding, patience, health, truth, devotion, sincerity, honor, loyalty, peace, wisdom, protection during sleep, astral projection\n\nPlanets: Moon, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter\n\nDays: Monday, Friday, Saturday, Thursday\n\nAstrological: Libra, Sagittarius\n\nColor Shape\n\nBlue suggests the circle or the sphere. It is cold, wet, transparent, atmospheric. Blue is retiring, dignified, and tends to create a blurred image in the eye. While it may have bulk, it does not seem to lend itself to angularity.\n\nCharacter Study\n\nHere is the color of conservatism and dignity. You are sensitive to others, sensitive to yourself. You have real weight to your character and never enter into any silly enthusiasms without careful thought.\n\nYou are not one to monopolize conversations, although you can hold your own when you once make up your mind to do so. You are cautious in word, dress and action. What troubles you most, however, is an inability to let go in moments of excitement. Perhaps situations and personalities bother you unduly.\n\nWhen you sin, your conscience is bothered, but you will sin just the same. This is because you have a rational mind and know how to justify yourself.\n\nRelated Colors\n\nLight blue is associated with health, healing, tranquility, understanding, and softness.\n\nDark blue represents knowledge, power, integrity, and seriousness.\n\nExamples\n\nBack to Top\n\nBLACK\n\nDeath, gloom, sorry, hidden action, evil, mourning, disorientation through absence of light. Black denotes strength and authority; it is considered to be a very formal, elegant, and prestigious color (black tie, black Mercedes).\n\nEmotional Response\n\nBlack is a mysterious color associated with fear and the unknown (black holes). It usually has a negative connotation (blacklist, black humor, ‘black death’). In heraldry, black is the symbol of grief.\n\nUse in Design & Advertising\n\nBlack gives the feeling of perspective and depth, but a black background diminishes readability. A black suit or dress can make you look thinner. When designing for a gallery of art or photography, you can use a black or gray background to make the other colors stand out.

It is the color of pride and ambition. Associated with sunshine and warmth, considered cheerful.\n\nEmotional Response\n\nOrange combines the energy of red and the happiness of yellow. It is associated with joy, sunshine, the tropics. Orange represents enthusiasm, fascination, happiness, creativity, determination, attraction, success, encouragement and stimulation.\n\nUse in Design & Advertising\n\nTo the human eye, orange is a very hot color, so it gives the sensation of heat. Nevertheless, orange is not as aggressive as red. Orange increases oxygen supply to the brain, produces an invigorating effect, and stimulates mental activity. It is highly accepted among young people. As a citrus color, orange is associated with healthy food and stimulates appetite. Orange is the color of fall and harvest. In heraldry, orange is symbolic of strength and endurance.\n\nOrange has very high visibility, so you can use it to catch attention and highlight the most important elements of your design. Orange is very effective for promoting food products and toys.\n\nIt’s disadvantage is that by survey of “favorite color” orange usually comes the lowest and thus it is rarely used for longer term products, such as cars or electronic products.\n\nAssociated Meanings\n\nGeneral Appearance: Bright, luminous, glowing\n\nMental Associations: Warm, metallic, autumn\n\nDirection Associations: Halloween, Thanksgiving\n\nObjective Impressions: Jovial, Lively, energetic, forceful\n\nSubjective Impressions: Hilarity, exuberance, indulgence\n\nSignifies: encouragement, adaptability, stimulation, attraction, plenty, kindness\n\nHoliday: Candlemas\n\nDeities: Brigid\n\nPlanets: Sun, Mars, Mercury\n\nDays: Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday\n\nColor Shape\n\nOrange suggests the form of the rectangle. It is less earthly in quality than red, more tinged with a feeling of incandescence. It is warm, dry, compelling. Optically, it produces a sharp image and therefore lends itself to angles and to well-defined ornaments.\n\nCharacter Study\n\nChoose orange and you are a person to be envied. For you are a “hail fellow well met.” Perhaps not so ardent and so passionate as the red type, you still have a grand love for life.\n\nYour taste runs to cheerful friends and good foods. You are just as much at ease among sinners as among saints. In fact, much of your life is devoted to things social. Yet, you should be careful. People may say behind your back that your last friend is always your best friend.\n\nYou are not one to be alone. You like eminent people, whether they are prizefighters or presidents. You want life to surround you, warm and mellow, like the orange glow from a fireplace.\n\nYou make the ideal bachelor or spinster, perhaps because you are inclined to know a little about many people and not very much about one or two.\n\nRelated Colors\n\nDark orange can mean deceit and distrust.\n\nRed-orange corresponds to desire, sexual passion, pleasure, domination, aggression, and thirst for action.\n\nGold evokes the feeling of prestige. The meaning of gold is illumination, wisdom, and wealth. Gold often symbolizes high quality.\n\nExamples\n\nBack to Top\n\nPURPLE\n\nColor of royalty. Has a strong religious significance. It is used as half-mourning. By associations, it gives a feeling of mystery. It is the color of shadows.\n\nEmotional Response\n\nPurple combines the stability of blue and the energy of red. It symbolizes power, nobility, luxury, and ambition. It conveys wealth and extravagance. Purple is associated with wisdom, dignity, independence, creativity, mystery, and magic.\n\nUse in Design & Advertising\n\nAccording to surveys, almost 75 percent of pre-adolescent children prefer purple to all other colors. Purple is a very rare color in nature; some people consider it to be artificial.\n\nLight purple is a good choice for a feminine design. You can use bright purple when promoting children’s products.\n\nAssociated Meanings\n\nGeneral Appearance: Deep, soft, atmospheric\n\nMental Associations: Cool, mist, darkness, shadow\n\nDirection Associations: Mourning, Easter\n\nObjective Impressions: Dignified, pompous, mournful, mystic\n\nSubjective Impressions: Loneliness, desperation\n\nSignifies: power, piety, sanctity, sentimentality, tension, sadness amplification of other energies, wisdom, high ideals, spiritual protection and healing, psychic ability, protective energy\n\nPlanet: Jupiter\n\nDay: Thursday\n\nAstrological: Sagittarius\n\nColor Shape\n\nPurple suggests the form of the oval. It is even more refined than blue. The eye finds difficulty in focusing an image of it sharply. It is thus soft, flowing and never angular. Unlike blue, however, it is not so lofty but clings closer to earth.\n\nCharacter Study\n\nTwo different types of people like purple—very profound beings and those who merely wish to appear so.\n\nChoose purple and you are, no doubt, a mystery to yourself as well as to others. Aristocratic and artistic people often favor the hue for its exclusive dignity. Such persons are generally satisfied with themselves, sometimes conceited and nearly always capable of great things.\n\nIf you like purple, you no doubt lay claim (if only in your heart) to a rather superior attitude toward the world; but, if you are extremely clever, are you also inclined to be a trifle lazy?\n\nPurple types are easy to live with. They are neither too bold, like red, nor too straight-laced, like blue. Yet they must beware of any “lavender-and-old-lace” tendencies, which may snare them if they don’t watch out.\n\nRelated Colors\n\nLight purple evokes romantic and nostalgic feelings.\n\nDark purple evokes gloom and sad feelings. It can cause frustration.\n\nExamples\n\nBack to Top\n\nCOLOR COMBINATIONS\n\nThere are certain color combinations which together have their own symbolism.\n\nRED & GREEN\n\nRed and green together denote pain (and, ironically, Christmas).\n\nExamples\n\nBLACK & WHITE\n\nBlack relieved with white signifies sophistication, vigor, newness.\n\nExamples\n\nBLACK & RED\n\nBlack and red together are the colors of enemy.\n\nExamples\n\nBack to Top\n\nREFERENCES & ADDITIONAL READING"
