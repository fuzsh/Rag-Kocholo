        "text": "African American artists — poets, writers, visual artists, and dancers — have historically served as change agents through their crafts.\n\nDrawn from their ancestors' ancient rites of passage and the shared hopes of liberty, Black artists continue to fuse the rhythmic cadence of creative expressions with the pulsating beats of progress. Our museum celebrates Black History Month 2024 by highlighting the \"art of resistance\" and the artists who used their crafts to uplift the race, speak truth to power and inspire a nation.\n\nView Our Digital Toolkit\n\nArtists are the gatekeepers of truth. We are civilization’s radical voice. Paul Robeson (1898-1976) Concert artist, actor, athlete and activist\n\nWhether digital, literary, visual or performing arts, Black trailblazers and innovators revolutionized their fields, often transforming them by pioneering new techniques and styles. Through art, important issues and figures in African American history are exalted, and underrepresented stories are preserved. For the entire month of February, we invite everyone to join us in celebrating art and its relationship with justice. Art plays a role in communicating emotions, building community and inspiring action.\n\nCultural Expressions (Literature and Poetry)\n\nCulture shapes lives. It’s in the food people eat, the languages they speak, the art they create, and many other ways they express themselves.\n\nI recognize that my power as well as my primary oppressions come as a result of my blackness as well as my womanness, and therefore my struggles on both of these fronts are inseparable. Audre Lorde (1934-1992) in 1980 Writer, professor, philosopher, poet and civil rights activist\n\nCultural Expressions Exhibition\n\nCultural Expressions is a circular, experiential, introductory space to African American and African diaspora culture.\n\nLearn More about Cultural Expressions Exhibition\n\n(Re)Creating the Narrative: The Black Women’s Literary Renaissance of the 1970s\n\nBlack women writers have consistently been a part of the cultural renaissances that have reshaped Black culture, nationally and globally.\n\nLearn More about (Re)Creating the Narrative: The Black Women’s Literary Renaissance of the 1970s\n\nIcons and Luminaries\n\nPhillis Wheatley\n\nCollection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture\n\nBooklet containing a biography of Phillis Wheatley and reprinted correspondence between her and George Washington, including a poem she sent him, \"His Excellency General Washington.\"\n\nIn 2023, the museum acquired the largest private collection of items to bring new context and perspective to the life and literary impact of poet Phillis Wheatley Peters (c.1753–1784).\n\nGwendolyn Brooks\n\nDavid Jackson (1922-1966)\n\nIn 1946, Gwendolyn Brooks (1917-2000) became a Guggenheim Fellow in poetry, and in 1950, she was the first African American to win a Pulitzer Prize, for her collection of poetry Annie Allen. The volume chronicled the life of a young Black girl growing up in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Brooks was appointed the Illinois Poet Laureate in 1968, inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1976, and by 1985, she had become Poet Laureate of the United States.

He was a graduate of Lincoln University, a historically black college in Pennsylvania.\n\nBorn in Joplin, Missouri, in 1902, it was the writer's many years in Harlem that would come to characterize his work.
