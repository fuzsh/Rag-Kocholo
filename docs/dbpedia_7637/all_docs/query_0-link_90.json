Scroll all the way down for new prompts, V5 examples and a “magic secret word” prompt that unlocks stunning results.\n\nWhat are the best text-to-image prompt keywords for unique types of art and photographic styles? For best AI art results? How about architecture, fantasy art, character renders and logo design?\n\nI’ve been playing with Midjourney and other text to image generators built around stable diffusion and I have my own prompts to get the best quality images, but recently I let chatGPT3 help me brainstorm some new ones… so here’s a huge list!\n\nI’ll go through soon and make examples of some of these so you can see the differences, but here’s a handy reference guide. Note: it’s dodgy, but not illegal, to copy an artist’s style directly by using their name (for living artists at least); but you could also just paste in 2 pieces of artwork and reproduce something much closer to their originals. So these prompts will help you get what you want faster, but they’re just a starting point for you to develop “ethical” Midjourney prompts that are more unique.\n\nInterview: 212 Bodybuilder Shaun Clarida Plans to Compete in Open Division Before He Retires | BarBend npp steroid ‘jay cutler bodybuilder’ poster, picture, metal print, paint by basues | displate\n\nBest MidJourney Prompts: Basics\n\nKeep things simple in the beginning, just describe what you want to see. Then add styles until it’s closer to what you’ve imagined. Mostly likely, you’ll want either an artistic, illustrative style or a photorealistic style. But you can also make logos, sketches, tattoo or comic book art, children’s books… the sky is the limit and the results are insane.\n\nYou’ll probably want to test sizes and ratios too. The default size is square, but you can get a landscape or portrait (tall or wide) with these. The sizes need to come at the very end, after the whole prompt, with two dash, you can copy/paste these:\n\n–ar 2:3\n\n–ar 3:2\n\n–ar 9:16\n\n–ar 16:9\n\n(You need to add 2 short dashes – – and the spacing has to be right. WordPress is combining my doubledashes to an m-dash).\n\nAt the basic level, just describe what you want to see. You can use full sentences or not, but the more complex, the trickier it gets. You can have a realistic close-up portrait, but if you do a big scene with lots of detail, it’ll get kind of close but not perfect.\n\nFor best AI art results, it’s important to provide clear, descriptive text-to-image prompts and to adjust the settings in the AI tool to your desired level of customization and control. Experimenting with different keywords and styles can lead to surprising and unique AI generated images and art.\n\nIf you don’t pick ANY style, it will guess, and it may not guess what you want.\n\nHere are some basics keywords where I didn’t even add a subject!\n\nAbstract Art:\n\n“Vibrant colors,” “Geometric shapes,” “Abstract patterns,” “Movement and flow,” “Texture and layers.”\n\nSurreal Art:\n\n“Dreamlike,” “Surreal landscapes,” “Mystical creatures,” “Twisted reality,” “Surreal still life.”\n\nLandscape Photography:\n\n“Majestic mountains,” “Lush forests,” “Glittering lakes,” “Desert dunes,” “Golden sunsets.”\n\nPortrait Photography:\n\n“Emotive eyes,” “Intense gazes,” “Contemplative mood,” “Expressive gestures,” “Stylized poses”.\n\nMinimalism:\n\n“Simplicity,” “Clean lines,” “Minimal colors,” “Negative space,” “Minimal still life.”\n\nBut really, you’d start off with the WHAT first, describe the scene and the details; then add the style keywords. The size/ratio needs to come at the end.\n\nMidjourney also has a few extra settings. You can play with them, or just add them to the end of your prompt individually.\n\n–test\n\n–testp\n\n–niji\n\nIn the following, I’m using 16:9 and just sharing the first, rough draft, without any upscaling, to give you an idea of the potential styles. Even if not perfect, Midjourney is pretty great at conveying the idea. These aren’t the best examples of what midjourney is capable of (though I’ll share a few more advanced tricks at the end!)\n\nBest MidJourney Prompts: Art Styles & Photography\n\nImpressionism:\n\n“Blurry brushstrokes,” “Painted light,” “Impressionistic landscapes,” “Pastel colors,” “Impressionistic portraits.”\n\nRealism:\n\n“Hyper-realistic textures,” “Precise details,” “Realistic still life,” “Realistic portraits,” “Realistic landscapes.”\n\nPop Art:\n\n“Bold colors,” “Stylized portraits,” “Famous faces,” “Pop art still life,” “Pop art landscapes.”\n\nStreet Photography:\n\n“Candid moments,” “Urban landscapes,” “Street life,” “Stories in motion,” “Street portraits.”\n\nNight Photography:\n\n“Lit cityscapes,” “Starry skies,” “Moonlit landscapes,” “Night time portraits,” “Long exposures.”\n\nThese text-to-image prompt keywords can help you achieve a particular style or camera setting in your AI generated images and art. By providing clear, specific prompts, you can achieve a wide range of styles and techniques to suit your creative vision.\n\nBest MidJourney Prompts: camera lenses and filters\n\nHere are some extra text-to-image prompt keywords related to camera lenses and filters:\n\nWide-Angle Lenses:\n\n“Expansive landscapes,” “Sweeping cityscapes,” “Architectural details,” “Wide-angle portraits,” “Including more of the scene.”\n\nTelephoto Lenses:\n\n“Zoomed in portraits,” “Isolated subjects,” “Compressed landscapes,” “Long-distance shots,” “Bokeh background.”\n\nMacro Lenses:\n\n“Intricate details,” “Macro still life,” “Macro portraits,” “Close-up textures,” “Macro landscapes.”\n\nPolarizing Filters:\n\n“Deep blue skies,” “Vibrant colors,” “Reduced glare,” “Polished reflections,” “Saturated landscapes.”\n\nNeutral Density Filters:\n\n“Long exposures,” “Smooth water,” “Silky skies,” “Ethereal landscapes,” “Dreamy portraits.”\n\nBest MidJourney Prompts: 45 Famous Artists\n\nHere’s some things you can try. Personally, a lot of artists with a unique style aren’t what I’m looking for. I just want that slightly illustrated look. There’s a discussion about the ethics/legality of using living/contemporary artists, but (right now) you can’t copyright style, and unless you’re trying to copy an artist’s work and sell it, some artist names might give great results.\n\nGreg Rutkowski is very popular on midjourney, but I also love Alphonse Mucha, Carrie Ann Baade, and Michael Parkes.

The trick is to be specific, and also open to the wonder and surprise (it’s a little like book cover design: if you want an exact scene you’ll work twice as hard and get imperfect results; but if you’re flexible you’ll end up with something better than you expected).\n\nA winter full of regret: An art piece depicting the feeling of regret in a winter setting, with a focus on snow and frozen landscapes.\n\nDrifting snow: A mesmerizing scene of snowflakes drifting in the wind, with soft colors and a dreamy atmosphere.\n\nA super cute baby pixar style white fairy rabbit: A whimsical, playful image of a cute white rabbit with delicate features, inspired by the art style of Pixar.\n\nShiny snow-white fluffy: A beautiful representation of a fluffy, pure-white rabbit, with a radiant shine and bright eyes.\n\nBig bright eyes: A close-up shot of a cute animal with big, bright eyes, capturing their innocence and playfulness.\n\nFluffy tail: An art piece showcasing the playful, soft tail of a cute animal, surrounded by natural light and simple backgrounds.\n\nBlue sweater: A cozy, comfortable image of a cute animal wearing a warm blue sweater, surrounded by natural light and simple backgrounds.\n\nPink hat: An art piece showcasing a cute animal wearing a playful pink hat, surrounded by natural light and simple backgrounds.\n\nSmile: A joyful image of a smiling cute animal, surrounded by natural light and simple backgrounds.\n\nDelicate and fine: An art piece showcasing the delicate and fine features of a cute animal, surrounded by natural light and simple backgrounds.\n\nFairy tales: A whimsical, dreamy image of a cute animal surrounded by elements inspired by fairy tales, such as magical creatures and enchanted landscapes.\n\nIncredibly high detailed: A meticulously crafted image of a cute animal, with incredibly high levels of detail and intricate textures.\n\nPixar style: An art piece inspired by the whimsical and playful style of Pixar, featuring cute animals and bright colors.\n\nBright color: An art piece showcasing a cute animal surrounded by bright, bold colors, capturing their playful energy and spirit.\n\nNatural light: A beautiful image of a cute animal surrounded by natural light, capturing their delicate beauty and charm.\n\nSimple background with pure color: An art piece showcasing a cute animal surrounded by a simple background with a pure color, creating a clean and polished look.\n\n5 and Octane Render: An art piece showcasing a cute animal with a 5 aspect ratio and rendered\n\n243 Creative text-to-image prompts\n\nThese are based on popular, famous things that are common or recognizable, and unique styles from famous artists or photographers. I combined random things in a creative and fun way, like famous popular brands or cool items or companies, comics or icons. They get more and more creative, ridiculous, specific and detailed, and I’ll pick some favorites to generate images with as examples.\n\nsome of these DO use copyrighted pop culture icons, so you couldn’t use them commercially, I’m just using them as examples.\n\nPS. something THIS detailed is unlikely to turn out well. But if you keep trying enough times, it might get it right. For something complex, I’d probably generate each object and then use photoshop to put it together. (For example… it tries a full-body spider man pose but isn’t sure where to put everything… or the rhino playing the violin; a rhino doesn’t have hands so it isn’t sure *how* the picture is possible. But it kind of manages with the wolf).\n\nAlso, the more specific details you add, the less likely it will also use the style prompts. I’m using Midjourney 4, and while it’s not perfect, it’s way better than Dalle2 right now. In a year I’m sure these prompts will come out nearly perfect.\n\nYou may also notice there’s a lot of repetition here: chatGpt3 struggles with long lists of ideas; there are even some authors or

A small group of survivors huddle around a campfire, planning their next move as they hear the shuffling footsteps of the undead closing in.\n\nIn the style of Blade Runner, an AI-powered cityscape with flying cars and neon lights in the year 2057.\n\nA massive space station in the style of Mass Effect, with robots and aliens trading goods in the year 2113.\n\nA future city floating on water in the style of Waterworld, with solar panels powering boats and floating markets in the year 2145.\n\nA post-apocalyptic wasteland in the style of Mad Max, with mutated creatures and warring tribes in the year 2230.\n\nA bustling intergalactic market in the style of Star Wars, with all sorts of species haggling over rare goods in the year 2570.\n\nA virtual reality nightclub in the style of The Matrix, with people plugging into simulated experiences in the year 2670.\n\nA pristine eco-city in the style of Wall-E, with lush green spaces and self-sustaining technology in the year 3070.\n\nA time-traveler’s convention in the style of Doctor Who, with people from all different eras mingling and trading tips in the year 3500.\n\nA colony on a distant planet in the style of Avatar, with humans and alien species coexisting in a utopian society in the year 3970.\n\nA world where robots have taken over in the style of The Terminator, with few human survivors hiding and plotting a rebellion in the year 4010.\n\nNote: nearly everything above would be copyrighted, so you couldn’t use it commerically. Except, fan art is already a gray area. When I was doing fine art in Taiwan, hello kitty variations were popular. Compare it for example, to Banksy’s mickey mouse and ronald mcdonald painting. If the art is transformative, and the value is produced by the new combinations of trademarked content, you could argue fair use and would probably win.\n\nMidjourney Prompts: Famous Movie Scenes\n\nA lot of the prompts above will get a generic style that isn’t copyright infringement, but if you deliberately add in specific characters, actors or movies, Midjourney will probably make something that’s a little too close for comfort. Fan art is allowed, but selling fan art can be questionable. Just something to keep in mind as you play with these prompts…\n\n“In the style of Tim Burton’s ‘The Nightmare Before Christmas’, a scene depicting the moment when Jack Skellington discovers Christmas Town.”\n\n“In the style of Stanley Kubrick’s ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’, a space shuttle crew member floating through the infinite darkness of space while gazing at the mysterious black monolith.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘Blade Runner’, a futuristic cityscape with neon lights and flying cars.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Matrix’, a character performing incredible martial arts moves while dodging bullets in slow motion.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘Jurassic Park’, a Tyrannosaurus Rex chasing a jeep full of tourists through a jungle.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Lord of the Rings’, a sweeping shot of the massive army of orcs marching towards the Battle of Minas Tirith.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘Star Wars’, a group of X-Wing fighters flying in formation towards the Death Star.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial’, E.T. riding a bicycle through the moonlit sky with Elliot.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’, Captain Jack Sparrow dueling with Davy Jones on the deck of the Flying Dutchman.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark’, Indiana Jones running from a giant rolling boulder in an ancient temple.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Terminator’, a cyborg assassin walking through a war-torn city while searching for its target.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Wizard of Oz’, the tornado carrying Dorothy’s house to the Land of Oz.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone’, the trio flying on broomsticks above Hogwarts during a Quidditch match.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Dark Knight’, the Joker holding hostages at gunpoint on the ferris wheel at an amusement park.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘Forrest Gump’, Forrest sitting on a bench and talking to a stranger while waiting for the bus.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Silence of the Lambs’, Clarice Starling interviewing the infamous serial killer, Hannibal Lecter, behind bars.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘Back to the Future’, Marty McFly traveling through time in the Delorean sports car.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Lion King’, Simba overlooking the Pride Lands from Pride Rock.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Little Mermaid’, Ariel gazing at the surface of the water and longing to be part of the human world.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Incredibles’, the family of superheroes facing off against the villain Syndrome.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Truman Show’, Truman realizing the truth about his life as a reality TV star.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy’, Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect hitchhiking through space.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘Star Trek: The Motion Picture’, the USS Enterprise exploring a massive, pulsing energy cloud.”\n\n“In the style of the movie ‘The Empire Strikes Back’, Darth Vader dueling with Luke Skywalker on the Cloud City.”\n\n“The Shawshank Redemption” (1994) – Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne is behind bars in Shawshank State Penitentiary.

It’s called “niji” you can go into /settings to change it to Niji version 4 or 5, or type –niji at the end of your prompt. I got some great results with these prompts.\n\nFor these I mostly just a simple description and the NIJI setting.

Once I got some good ones, I copy/pasted their url into the prompts to combine my favorites, and then just kept respinning to get more variety.\n\nI also retried some of my early prompts in Niji mode:\n\ncute kawaii manga, realistic photography, strapless top, thick hourglass figure, angry, dirty sharp knife, detailed face detailed hands, fantasy dark steampunk vibe, black gothic vampire gown, witch, insane detail, manga anime realistic, fantasy character concept artstation, cosplay video game, fantasy female huntress priestess assassin ranger Druid paladin, Halloween desktop background, spooky cemetery at night, haunted, horror, gorgeous dark fantasy art, gothic emo girl in ballgown, supernatural, mysterious, intrigue, suspense, insane detail, candles graves headstone, fantasy –ar 9:16 –niji 5\n\nor these which are crazy:\n\ngorgeous soldier warrior girl post apocalyptic fantasy character (two image links) beautiful young urban fantasy huntress, light armor, short skirt, legs, tank top, slim hourglass figure, soft lighting, soft expression expression, dark urban fantasy, cyberpunk futuristic dystopian, floral organic nature fantasy elven background, Character in full growth portrait.

But midjourney can make some pretty risqué stuff with the right prompts, more like classic pinup art.\n\nTry using “waifu” as a prompt; you can usually get away with “slim fit hourglass figure” but not always something like “hot body” – often if things get too adult, midjourney will erase the images from your discord but you can still get the originals from the midjourney site (so you can test things out that might work for awhile). Try something like “sitting/seated pose” or “leaning down.”\n\nFor more examples, here’s a gallery of hottest Disney princesses.\n\nFor a while, midjourney was so careful it couldn’t make boobs at all, so the upper torsos always looked like crap. I think it’s gotten better and even seems less strict lately. Sometimes it will accidentally give you something, that it then bans if you try to use it as an image (you can also upload some ideas of the style you want with your prompt to get it closer.\n\nHere’s one (left) from an older version of midjourney that gets the idea but the details are too messy; getting a huge chest like this in the current midjourney is trickier. If I try using this image as for inspiration it gives me very nice, but very clothed versions that aren’t as cool… which is a pain because I can’t replicate cool art from older midjourney versions). “Thick fit figure” works sometimes.\n\nI tried using the /describe feature for this image, it gave me four prompts to test. None of them are close. I took the best one and added the link to this picture. Then I used “vary: strong” on the best ones (a new feature I love, the previous variance wasn’t enough). I finally got something (right) which is pretty similar, but also has less interesting personality and feels a little flat; they are so careful not to make cleavage, it looks blurred out and unrealistic.\n\nBest Midjourney prompts for tattoo ideas\n\nI’m building a whole site for this, coming soon!\n\nBest Midjourney prompts for sticker design\n\nComing soon, in the meantime check out www.stickeryou.com for making stickers.\n\nBest midjourney prompts for coloring books\n\nYou can use a simple prompt for clean coloring book art. It’s not perfect, but you can use Vectorizer AI to make them big and clean.\n\nAnime girls coloring line outline 2d clean, Anime girls coloring pages, Manga termed Coloring pages, (for kawaii girls)\n\nOr try something more complex to be interesting:\n\ncreepy kawaii dark academia aesthetic, 2d illustration, line art, outline, 2d, pen and ink, mandala, insane detail, geometric patterns, tattoo flash, anime manga coloring book printable, creepy kawaii dark academia aesthetic, 2d illustration, line art, outline, 2d, pen and ink, mandala, insane detail, geometric patterns, tattoo flash, anime manga coloring book printable, cute anime kawaii creepy coloring book pages, manga hippie chick tarot poker card, planets astronomy astrology, acid, goth emo cute, complex geometric patterns mandala, steampunk mechanical gears, alchemy symbols, esoteric, insane detail creative line art, classic tattoo flash, mandala, cute and playful, fantasy goth symbols, woven braids, symmetry, detailed, elaborate, comic book drawing in style of moebius, peter mohrbacher, symbolic poster art symmetry, by Bastien Lecouffe Deharme, cosplay, fantasy, digital art, poster art, movie poster, cover art, high resolution, sharp focus, clear details, vivid, dreamy, symbolic patterns, complex tattoo geometric line art\n\n(check out my AI coloring book pages)\n\nNEW! Image weights and “Describe” prompts for Midjourney\n\nMidjourney has a few new features. You can choose /blend and upload 2 pics to blend them together, which is a great way to make an anime profile picture or turn your cat into a superhero or something.\n\nBut it also has a /describe feature – so instead of trying to guess the words words to use to prompt midjourney into making what you want, you can upload any image and midjourney will describe it for you! So you can start with that prompt and customize it how you want to.\n\nHowever, I just tested it with an image, and out of four suggested prompts, only one got kind of close to the original, and none are as good as the ones I made by guessing descriptive words and using the original image.\n\nYou can also add multiple images in your prompt: I will usually respin a hundreds times and then add direct links to my *favorite* pictures, with the original prompt, to keep getting closer and closer to my targets. You can even use just one image – but it still won’t reproduce something exactly. You can put it image prompts with or without text prompts; and (I believe) putting things first and early, gives them more weight.\n\nIf I’m combining too long and complex prompts, I may test putting the first prompt above the second or vice versa; or moving the picture links up or down. But you can also use –iw .5\n\n–iw = image weight.\n\nAnything with a — double dash needs to be at the very end. And it has to be two connected dashes — and then the other thing immediately, then a space, then the parameters. I think in midjourney five, the image weights go from .25 to 2.\n\nSo you if you wanted the images to have more weight than the text, and you also want it to be more creative and stylish… and set it to a landscape aspect ratio you could do:\n\n–iw 1.5 –s 500 — 3:2\n\nSay the magic Word (the magic prompt that unlocks everything)\n\nTwo fun extra things:\n\nyou can use the word “discombobulate” for really cool results where things are busy or coming separated.\n\nyou can also use a string of random nonsense:\n\nThe magic secret word is “3393f18b-a198-4658-a67b-c368e41ea935“.\n\nThat’s it. Just that, that’s the prompt. I’m sorry I don’t remember where I found it or who discovered it. To be fair, I haven’t tired any other string of random numbers to find out what else might work. But THIS works.\n\nI like to think it’s the closest thing to Midjourney actually being creative. People say AI art has no soul, that “people can tell” the difference. I disagree. This is all, powerful, beautiful art. If a human made it, they’d probably sell out a fine gallery. (Speaking as someone who used to paint and sell in galleries… this is better than I could ever do.)\n\n*If* I had to guess, I’d say maybe this prompt uses all of my history somehwere; I have been making mermaids recently and these are pretty fishy.\n\nPs. if you’re a gallery looking for a cool “AI Dreams” type of exhibition and want to use these, hit me up.\n\nConsistent characters in Midjourney\n\nIt’s hard to get midjourney to do one specific thing perfectly. But if you just need a character in multiple poses, that’s not so hard. If you need the right face – I usually use a photo-portrait prompt and 3 celebrity names, to get a unique face that doesn’t look like anyone famous. Then I’ll keep spinning that to get dozens of angles of “that” face, which I can then photoshop onto other art later.\n\nBut it’s also true, if you get something you like and keep respinning with the same prompts, midjourney will usually use the face alone unless you prompt otherwise, so you can get 3 great poses by generating 20+ images, for example here are a few characters I like, with multiple poses but pretty similar faces.\n\nOnce you have a character, you can just use 2 or 3 favorite images in your prompt and make changes with text, ie “profile/side view, excited and laughing, sad and angry, raising a knife”…. just tell how you want your character’s face, expression and pose to be or small changes.\n\nCreative Prompts for Midjourney V.5\n\nThese prompts were made with midjourney version 4: not “niji” or test or test-photo. But midjourney 5 is out now and it’s pretty different. In my experiences, and from what most people are saying, V4 was better at aesthetics. Everything looks great"
