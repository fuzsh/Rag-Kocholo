        "text": "Session One: The Racial Delusion Opening Remarks by Thomas Chatterton Williams\n\nTHOMAS CHATTERTON WILLIAMS: It’s an honor to be here with writers and thinkers whom I’ve looked up to and tried to model myself on for years, as I’ve tried to find my own way. In preparing for this conference over the past year, I kept returning to Bob Boyers’ original framing 1 through the lens of Harold W. Cruse’s The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual. That book is one of the works like [Allan Bloom’s] The Closing of the American Mind that people may or may not have read, but whose title alone seems to resonate with everyone for an enormous variety of reasons, though often, as is certainly the case for me, not for the same reasons that motivated the author in the first place. But as I thought about it, it occurred to me—as others have pointed out—that one of Cruse’s undeniable achievements was really just to think long and hard about what American-ness, and thus identity, means and could mean. This was an urgent project in his day, and it may indeed be of even greater urgency in our own. What would it mean to re-think American-ness in the post-Obama, post-post-racial era of Donald Trump? What I liked about Cruse was that he was so thoroughly anti-status-quo, so unimpressed with radical rhetoric that did not entail some connection with meaningful action. This is, I think—a distinction between rhetoric and action—worth dwelling on. Action can be defined pretty generously. It need not have anything to do with a determination to go out and get arrested, but at minimum, I think, moving beyond mere rhetoric requires some form of alignment between one’s words and one’s behavior.\n\nAnd so I can’t help but notice that—if there is, indeed, a crisis of the Black intellectual who, by so many measures is thriving today, more sought out and provided with platforms than he or she has ever been—then it probably has something to do with this very disconnect. Many of our most audible black voices today will say things that do sound radical. In one small—but not frivolous—example, we might use a formulation like, “people who believe they are white” in their writing.” That is not at all empty rhetoric. It’s quite radical. It’s a way of saying that whiteness is not something that is real, which is a way of saying that race itself is an illusion. This is a decades-old insight, of course. James Baldwin made the point as well as anyone. But it is nonetheless one that is, by any measure, still subversive, capable of raising many readers’ eyebrows, or worse. But many of the intellectuals using such penetrating rhetoric today too often leave it on the page. They seldom ever display the kind of radical imagination, or perhaps just the willingness to face ridicule, that would force them to conduct their lives as though they genuinely believed, or wanted to believe, that the implications of such statements were true. In fact, much of the time the rhetoric itself can seem inconsistent. And thus they represent whiteness, and therefore race, as something much more like an essence, resulting in anti-racism work that can be powerful, testimonial, well-meaning, and even convincing, yet paradoxically capable of reinforcing the same received and deeply constricting ideas of racial difference they claim elsewhere to want to counteract. And so even though this is not at all what Cruse would have meant, I have come to believe wholeheartedly that the only action sufficiently radical to accompany a statement like “people who believe they are white,” which is just a way of saying that race is a lie, is to follow that logic to its necessary endpoint. This would mean unequivocally renouncing racial categories and, to the extent possible, taking into account one’s class position and other factors, finding ways to live one’s life accordingly, in defiance of the convoluted logic upholding the color caste system. One radical, non-violent, and possibly self-sacrificing act for the black intellectual would be to start refusing to check boxes.\n\nLet me backtrack and admit that I have not always been so willing, or able, to question conventional ideas of race and identity. I’ve spent almost the entirety of my life believing the fundamentally American dictum that a single drop of black blood makes a person black, primarily because that person can never be white. My father, a brown-skinned man from segregated Texas, is old enough to be my grandfather, and his grandfather was old enough to be born in the final year of chattel slavery. My mother is a pale-skinned Anglo-Saxon protestant from a bible-thumping, evangelical family in southern California. As a family, we were an island unto ourselves in a de facto segregated New Jersey town, whose white side we lived on as a form of silent protest against the attempts of various realtors to steer us across their invisible, but ultimately real, red lines. Yet despite these particularities we never questioned that ours was an unequivocally black household. Sometimes my father, a sociologist by training, would even joke, half-jest, that his wife wasn’t really white at all—she was just light-skinned, he’d laugh. Once, when I was ten or so years old, I pressed him on this, saying “Come on, you don’t really believe that, do you?” “Well, she’s got black consciousness, doesn’t she?” is what he’d say. It strikes me now, as an adult, that this exchange could occur nowhere else in the world but in the United States. And yet it made a certain amount of sense to me then. What I know is that my parents tried to prepare my brother and me for a reality beyond their doorstep as best they could, by proudly and confidently proclaiming and championing our blackness, so that, in turn, we might do the same, when the world would inevitably demand that we take a stance. As recently as 2012, a year before my French wife got pregnant, I published an essay in the New York Times defining my future children as unassailably black. They would be mixed, yes, but they would be as black as W.E.B. DuBois, if they wanted to be, I reasoned. In retrospect, I can see that it was a defiant last gasp of something, some way of looking at the world that I must have understood as being, whether I wanted to admit it or not, under dire threat.\n\nAt the time, I was convinced that I was in the right, and even pressed my wife to accept the same view, which was completely foreign to her European mind—a mind which had, frankly, never been exposedto plantation logic. Today I wince when I read that Op-ed. Parenthood changes everyone, but looking back on it now, I can say without exaggeration that I walked into that delivery room as one person, and came out an altogether different man. The sight of my blond-haired, blue-eyed, impossibly fair-skinned child shocked me, along with the knowledge that she was indubitably mine. I thought of Albert Murray’s wonderful line in The Omni-Americans: “But any fool can see that the white people aren’t really white, and the black people aren’t black.” And I did feel myself to be a fool right then. Like confronting the irrevocable knowledge that the sun does not, in fact, rise or set, contrary to linguistic convention. The reality of my daughter’s appearance laid bare for me a convenient fiction. From that moment on, I was consumed by three deceptively simple questions: What, if anything, remains black in my child? What—if I am a black man capable of having a daughter who looks like this—does race, as we construct it, even mean? What might all of our lives look like, should we dare to see past the color line? I began to write a book attempting to address these questions. Before long, I had to face the fact that it would require nothing less than for my actions to become commensurate, as commensurate as possible, with my rhetoric.\n\nWhat has any of this to do with the black intellectual? While I was living in Berlin in 2017, I became intrigued by the notion of sonderweg in German history: literally the “special path” down which the German people have been fated to wander. In different eras, and depending on who employed it, the term could imply different things. It began as a positive myth during the imperial period, as some German scholars told themselves about their political system and their culture. During and after the Second World War, it turned distinctly negative, a way for outsiders to make sense of the singularity of Germany’s crimes. Yet whether viewed from within or without, from left or right, the Germans could be seen, through such a conceptual lens, as possessing some kind of collective essence. A specialness capable of explaining everything about them. And that’s why one could speak of a trajectory from Luther to Hitler, and interpret history not as some kind of chaotic jumble, but as a crisp, linear process. There’s something both terrifying and oddly soothing in such a formulation. For better or worse, it leaves many important matters beyond the scope of choice or action. It imagines Germans as having been either glorious or terrible puppets, powerful agents of forces nonetheless beyond their control. A similar unifying theory has been taking hold in America. Its roots lie in the national triple sin of slavery, land theft, and genocide. In this view, the conditions at the core of the country’s founding don’t just reverberate through the ages—they determine the present. No matter what we might hope, that original sin—white supremacy—explains everything: an all-American sonderweg.\n\nThe most shocking aspect of today’s mainstream anti-racist discourse, still the primary arena for the black intellectual, is the extent to which it mirrors ideas of race, specifically the specialness of whiteness, that white supremacist thinkers cherish. Woke anti-racism, even when it pays lip-service to phrases like the aforementioned “people who believe they are white,” actually proceeds from the premise that race is real—if not biological, then socially constructed, and equally, if not more, significant still. This woke anti-racism puts it in sync with the toxic presumptions of white supremacism that would also like to insist on the fundamentality of racial difference. Working towards opposing conclusions, racists and many anti-racists alike eagerly reduce people to abstract color categories, all the while feeding off and legitimizing each other, while any of us searching for grey areas and common ground get devoured twice. Both sides mystify racial identity, interpreting it as something fixed and determinative, and almost supernatural in scope. This way of thinking about human difference is seductive for many reasons, but it has failed us.\n\nIn the months since the outcome of the 2016 election, I’ve been dismayed to see an opportunistic demagogue provoke racial resentment across the country and within families (mine as well). But I’ve also been troubled to watch well-meaning white friends who, on my Twitter timeline and Facebook News Feed, flagellate themselves, sincerely or performatively apologizing for their whiteness as if they were somehow born into original sin. John McWhorter has called this development “the flawed new religion of anti-racism…the current idea that the enlightened white person is to regularly—ritually?—‘acknowledge’ that they possess White Privilege.” He wrote this in a 2015 essay. Classes, seminars, teachings are devoted to making whites understand the need for this. Nominally, this acknowledgement of white privilege is couched as a prelude to activism. But in practice, the acknowledgement is treated as the main meal. The call for people to soberly acknowledge their white privilege as a self-standing, totemic act is based on the same self-justification as acknowledging one’s fundamental sinfulness as a Christian. “One is born marked by original sin; to be born white is to be born with the stain of unearned privilege,” McWhorter writes. And so, it is therefore to be born with an essence; in other words, to walk that “special path” without excusing the racists or the sexists, which are, by all indications, both numerous and emboldened. Today’s dominant liberal discourse, which the black intellectual plays a powerful role in shaping—and which sets up all whites as the nation’s only genuine actors, and all blacks and, to varying degrees, other minorities as their hapless props—has too often been counterproductive. The essential tendency, whether explicitly or implicitly stated—which Baldwin described as the “insistence that it is [man’s] categorization alone which is real and which cannot be transcended”—is always an evasion of life’s complexity. Of course, black and other non-white people cannot meaningfully renounce their race if a significant number of whites do not join them. But neither can even the best-intentioned white people do this in a vacuum. We are a composite nation, as well as a nation of composites. And alt-right fantasies of an all-white ethno-state in Montana and the Pacific Northwest notwithstanding, we are stuck together. The racial resentments conjured and magnified by the 2016 election amount to a giant step in the wrong direction. It is impossible to deny that. But falling back into our narrow identities, even those forged by legitimate grievance, and foisted upon us by the bigotry of others, only delivers a further victory to the opponents of a healthy society.\n\nTo shift this dismal paradigm, thinking people of good will across the political spectrum are going to have to find a new vocabulary to move beyond abstract racial categorization and reflexive tribalism. And then they’re going to have to allow that vocabulary to change the way they act. Merely gesturing at the notion that race is a construct will never be enough. Treating race as a social fact amounts to nothing more than acknowledging that we were mistaken to think of it as a biological fact, and then insisting that we have to keep making the mistake. Walter Benn Michaels incisively points that out. A more durable rejection of the racism and xenophobia animating our public life requires an appeal to a deeper, more profound, and racially transcendent humanism. This, in turn, would demand the convincing expression of shared ideals and democratic values. At its rhetorical best, “the American bedrock,” these are accessible to all, regardless of personal background. As James Baldwin, Dr. Martin Luther King, and many others have eloquently pointed out, racism—which I don’t believe can be meaningfully eradicated while maintaining the belief in race—hurts us all. It denies to those understood as black their humanity, while consigning those deemed white to inhumanity and indifference. But this hurts black people even more.\n\nMy wish, then, foolish as it may be—foolish in Albert Murray’s sense, I hope—would be for as many people as possible, of all skin tones and hair textures, to turn away from the racial delusion. But I don’t think that it would be unfitting in the least for black intellectuals—who too often, for so many reasons, end up reciting an American sonderweg notion of white supremacy—to take the lead here. Not only do we have the most to gain from the dismantling of the American black/white binary, we also have scarce incentive to wait for all, or even most, of the people deemed “white” to get on board. The fact is that we are all here because race, as well as the invented category of blackness into which so many of us have been thrown, has functioned first and foremost as a problem to be solved, distracting the so-called black intellectual from other pursuits, draining precious mental and spiritual energy. That the dreadful deceit was not put forth by the people most powerfully oppressed is an objection that resonates emotionally, but once we accept that truth, it does little to move us forward. One pressing task for the black intellectual—and it’s far from an easy one—will be to develop and model a rhetorical framework compelling and persuasive enough to inspire us all into a genuinely radical action.\n\nROBERT BOYERS: I have a first question for Thomas. It has to do with an extraordinary essay you wrote about Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attack on Kanye West. You speak in that essay about Coates’s “Mullah-like authority to assert communal possession of other people he deems to be a part of his community.” Coates claims for himself, you say, “the right not merely to refute a person’s argument, but to deracinate [that person] entirely,” as if he knows what all black people must share. Would you talk a bit more about that notion of “Mullah-like authority” and about that sense that there is a way to read people out of the race. TCW: The Coates essay was really disturbing to me. In his essay, Coates essentially pulled Kanye West’s black credentials from him, and he assumed his authority to do so, as though there is one way to think that is properly black, which is terrifying. It was an interesting thing to look at in our popular culture, because both of these men are extremely popular. And a lot of black people weren’t comfortable giving up Kanye West, even though in sidling up to Donald Trump, he was doing things that really bothered a lot of people. I think that there were still far too many who felt comfortable that Coates had the authority to come down with the tablets and make a proclamation. And I said it was Mullah-like because there is, in fundamentalist religion, an idea of correct and incorrect behaviors. You know, I want to get into a conversation where we talk about the fact that we’re moving beyond race, but this idea that there’s an essential blackness, and that one can violate it, has long been imposed upon black figures—Michael Jackson, for example. It was a moment in popular culture that really shocked me. Kanye West has this line, “This is my life, homie, you define yours.” And there are too many black people thinking in too many different ways for there to be one correct way. JOHN MCWHORTER: Thomas, I disagreed with Coates on that, too, but I want to fill in a little bit of what you’re saying about the idea that he was behaving as a Mullah. Because I think that if Coates were sitting here, he’d be clicking his tongue and rolling his eyes. I think that what he’d think we were misunderstanding is this: it’s not that he was behaving like a Mullah; he feels that if you’re not fundamentally committed to battling the racist abuse that we suffer, then there’s something wrong with you. He’d say that it’s not Mullah-like, but just basic moral logic that if you’re not on certain barricades, then clearly you’re not interested in defending yourself. What’s on Coates’s mind is two things (though I can’t be in Coates’s mind, this is an attempt to reconstruct it): people are battling racist cops, and that’s the defining experience, particularly for any black man. Therefore racism is powerful in that way primarily. When anyone talks about America being founded on racism, what they are mainly thinking about is the cops—and we know that Coates is definitely thinking about the cops. The second thing is that in general, Coates has his line that there’s nothing wrong with black America that the eclipse of white supremacy couldn’t fix. What he means is that if there are black teenagers killing each other over sneakers every summer, that’s because of how white people feel about black people and how that’s inculcated itself into our structures. If there are not enough black people going into STEM subjects, if they are under-represented in any way in any profession, the reason is because white people don’t like them and because racist structures control how America works. If you believe that—and Coates does—then it’s not Mullah-like behavior: he is behaving as a rational, self-concerned, moral actor, and he doesn’t understand why Kanye West isn’t one.\n\nNow, Ta-Nehisi Coates’s vision of how cops and race work is vastly oversimplified, and you and I have talked about how there’s a whole article to be written about that, but Coates doesn’t know that, and even if he’s told, he’s not going to listen. We have to think of ourselves as in his head. As far as discrepancies in society, the idea that all racial discrepancies are due, to some extent, to something white people did or are doing wrong, is an oversimplification. You and I agree. But Coates doesn’t regard this as oversimplification, and he’s not going to hear it described that way. Here Coates is representative of a certain kind of black thought, as well as a kind of thought that many non-black people, who consider themselves fellow travelers, represent—and they’re not going to let go of it either. So, what we are faced with are different takes on the world. I worry that if you say—and I’m with and understand everything that you say—that he’s imposing his Mullah-like vision, he immediately dismisses that because I don’t think that’s what it is. And the same goes for his fans, which is about every second person who’s concerned with these issues, of any color at all, in the United States and beyond, and the danger then is that we don’t have a real conversation. After all, everybody’s thinking that you must battle the role that racism plays in black lives, so that really there is a conversation to be had.\n\nTCW: What struck me as so terribly unfair about the whole thing is the idea that you have a claim to somebody else’s thoughts or behaviors. Even if he’s coming from the perspective that you’re describing, he still doesn’t have a claim to pronounce on other people’s ability to draw on their experience to inform an outlook that deviates from what’s expected. It’s scary to think that there’s an orthodoxy governing that. JM: But he—and we’re using “him” as a metonymy for lots of people— thinks that we just don’t know. He thinks that he can determine this because the truth is so obvious. We’re married to white women so, you know, there’s a problem there. We’re not representative; we just don’t understand the real problem. “You live in France”—I’ve never heard anyone say it, but you know that they must say it, so you just don’t know. And I’m an Ivy league professor, and I like musical theatre, and I don’t really know. So, as far as he’s concerned, he does know—and for reasons that I don’t think make him an idiot. But you’re not saying he’s an idiot, either. TCW: You know that Coates is a Francophone. JM: I’ve heard that. TCW: And of course I’m not saying Coates is an idiot. I debated about whether I should get into the Kanye West altercation because I think you lose something in turning to him. He’s not a thinker; he’s drugged out of his mind on painkillers, and in any case writing about celebrities is always problematic. But what seemed interesting and important about this was that someone could tell you that you’re out of line, that you have a choice to make: to come back in the fold and to get in line, or to be ex-communicated. And I think that that’s relevant. ORLANDO PATTERSON: Did Kanye West sort of bring that on himself? I mean, he has a vast following, so I suspect, in a way, that he feels that he is speaking for his people when he speaks. There is some problem in his relationship with Trump, but they are both, in a sense, coming from the same place, aren’t they? That, in a sense, almost validates the clash, in that both really do feel that they speak for others. Now, I’d love to know, as a sociologist, what those fans of his are now thinking about him: Did they stay with him, or not? The question goes to the heart of the identity issue. RB: I can’t help thinking here about an essay Thomas wrote about the artist Adrian Piper. In that essay, Tom, you say that at a certain point, Piper stopped allowing her artwork to be exhibited in all-black shows, not wanting to fulfill expectations based upon her race. When I read that, I thought of a number of white women writers who at one time or another refused to allow themselves to be included in anthologies of women’s writing, and of a gay poet who refused to allow his work to be anthologized in anthologies of gay writing. I suppose that this may well have something to do with a reluctance to speak for other people, though also with a desire to say ‘no’ to racial or gender categories altogether. TCW: Though I understood Piper’s frustration, I don’t know if I would do the same thing. I recently thought about this question in the context of T Style Magazine, which recently had a cover featuring black writers. And some very notable black writers weren’t included, and I cannot say for sure, but I imagine that some of them simply wanted to be writers and didn’t want to be black writers—not because there’s anything wrong with being black, but because that’s not something that white writers have to go through. You just want to be a writer, and you happen to belong to a tradition, or a group, but that may not be how you think of yourself when you think of all the singular experiences that go into comprising you as a person and as a creator of work. There’s a struggle between being an individual and being thrust into a larger collective to which you have no choice about belonging. And I think that this tension is very poignant for the black intellectual—it always has been, and it will remain so going forward. It’s one part of our responsibility to push against it. You know, Kafka wrote, “What have I in common with the Jews? I hardly have anything in common with myself.” That’s not something you’re supposed to ask, or say, but it doesn’t invalidate the question. RB: In some respects that is the essential question, no? JM: Bob, this is the first time since 2010 that I have said yes to something where I was invited as a black anything. I decided in 2010 that that was enough, I am a person, and if I am invited somewhere I will talk about race issues but I will not be invited as a Negro representative. Because it feels like an abbreviation of myself. I don’t want people to think that that’s all I am. It’s not as if I think that they’re going to think I’m white. I just thought that it isn’t right, that it’s too narrow, and it’s antediluvian. This is different, because it’s so special, and I just wanted to sit here with these people you’ve invited. But I hesitated at first. I sat at my desk, and I thought, this is one of those things where I’m being invited because of the color of my skin. That’s not what you meant, but my first thought was no, none of that—I’ll be invited as a Happy Linguist, and if they want to talk about how it feels to be colored, I thought, no, I’ll just write about it. And I’m happy to write about it. But I thought, no, this I have to do. But—don’t laugh—this is the last time—unless there’s something equally special—I’m not doing this again…at least, not until 2029. And that’s because of the abbreviation I feel in the way I’m allowing myself to be represented. Don’t ask why I don’t feel the same way about writing. MARGO JEFFERSON: When you say you don’t feel that way about writing, do you mean with what kind of assignments you’re offered? Because I find that interesting. And I think about that a lot. JM: No, I will happily write about the black experience. Again, for me, writing is different. I feel it as a mission. And I wish to get my writing out there, but it’s less—you’re making me really think here—it’s less personal. You write it, you’re hiding behind the wall of the fact that you’re not there, and you go make your dinner and raise your kids. All this is opposed to “Hello, Professor McWhorter, standing in a blazer”—which I’m not wearing— “I wish to speak to you about 1/100th of your life, and that’s why I find you interesting, and why you’re here.” MJ: “Let me remind you again that this is why you’re here,” yes. JM: Yeah—that’s too much. This is great. But in general, no. Not as a way of life. MJ: I must say, as someone who spent so many years in commercial journalism, I felt a lot of this pressure in terms of the kinds of pieces I would be asked to write, by which I simply mean 1,200 reviews of black writers, with no interest in whether I was making distinctions between those I was interested in and others I was not. However, I always felt that my desire—my mandate, my mission—was, in places like Newsweek or the Times, to bring as much textured attention as I could summon to minority writers, as well as to various women writers. But there’s always a line you cross: “It’s Marian Anderson’s 100th anniversary. Would you write about her?” Now, I know some stuff about classical music, but the fact is that I’d never been a classical music critic in my life. I’d only written about musical theatre, jazz, et cetera. And I said I wouldn’t do it. For me to do this piece, well, it was clear that the Times was not taking Marian Anderson seriously, by their standards, as a major opera singer. I wouldn’t do it, and won’t do it. JM: But, of course—I’m always trying to put myself in other people’s heads— they’re thinking that there’s something about Marian Anderson that only you are going to understand. Which doesn’t really make any sense. MJ: I know. And that was, to some extent, probably true, but given the kind of piece they wanted, what I understood would probably have been so foregrounded that it would have become almost pure sociology. I really wanted her to get her due on her 100th anniversary. She was a soprano! And I could have decided that I could find a way to do it. You know, the Times is really obsessed with black women opera singers, from Marian Anderson, to Shirley Verrett, and others. And actually, if you do hear earlier recordings, Marian sounds more like a soprano than a mezzo. But they feel that black women are automatically pushed towards being mezzos rather than sopranos because it’s earthier. And it’s usually not the lead role of the heroine, the beauty, the star. This is…what to call it? History? JM: Margo, can I geek out for what is going to be eight seconds? MJ: Let’s geek. JM: Are there recordings of Anderson before the early 50s so that as time passes, you can hear how her voice changes? MJ: Yes, I think you can hear the Lincoln Memorial recording. But there are also other recordings from the 40s. And isn’t it fun to geek? That’s why we came, right? DARRYL PINCKNEY: Forgive me for going back to Thomas’s first sentences, but just the mention of that title— The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual—brought back so much from my student days. It was one of those books that was always on the shelf, that a lot of people owned, but hadn’t read. And it was always very intimidating because you would open any page and feel that you weren’t black enough. MJ: And there were many pages. DP: Many pages! It’s a work of extraordinary vehemence about black cultural nationalism that also included a very inconvenient species of anti-Semitism, looking at the Marxist influence on black radicalism, and blaming American Jews for sort of imposing Marxism on black writers. And one of the most extraordinary changes that we don’t talk much about is that Marxism as an alternative social vision is gone, so that black intellectuals had to find ways to hold onto it by looking to other countries. Even the Panthers thought they were Marxists. But that was a long time ago. Nowadays, a lot of black intellectual life takes place without an idea of alternatives or social visions other than what we have. And people had always looked to black culture as a place for different answers. It wasn’t always a prurient interest. It was to experience another America, or a truer America, and especially a freer America. And that’s the thing that’s left, now—everyone is sort of echoing what Jack Kerouac’s character says when he walks through the ghetto in Denver: “Oh, I wish I was black because there’s more music, there’s more night, there’s more this, there’s more that…” MJ: There’s less guilt. DP: There’s less guilt. And this idea of there being a “this” side of town and a “that” side of town is still very much with us. I feel very funny, because I’m a big fan of white privilege…It’s just a joke, nobody laughed. JM: I was laughing inside. DP: But I also have to say that with my generation in school, there never was a black writer. There just wasn’t. And even in college, there wasn’t. You know, black writing was something done at home, it was in the family, it was personal. MJ: And sometimes it was compensatory—your family wanted to make sure that you learned about the black writers that you weren’t going to get in school. DP: Absolutely, yes. And insisted on their value that way. So, early on, after I’d failed at poetry, and failed at fiction…you know, Mary McCarthy said that young writers should write reviews. And I actually discovered that I was very interested to write about these black writers I’d never studied. And I found that it was something of an honor. And I learned a great deal, and that was added to my feeling of humility about literature and the past. I used to have arguments with people who would ask me, “You know, aren’t you a writer who happens to be black? Why do you call yourself a black writer?” But actually, I think that it’s a term of honor. I don’t mind going to events centered around these subjects because I learn something. Because there’s actually no other way in my life for me to take it in, or to have these conversations and these experiences. I also think that blackness means so many different things historically, as well as from place to place and person to person, era to era. But when we talk about it, we mean something specific, especially in the United States. And it has to do with its social aspects—maybe not so much with the psychological, anymore, because that’s the thing that really broke apart. A thing we’ll talk about.\n\nBut then we were also talking about Kanye West. Someone like Kanye is criticized by someone like Coates because we are still in that world where black success is meant to be representative of possibilities, of change, and of virtue, and to speak to (and for) those who aren’t there. We don’t talk enough about class and race in the United States. We also don’t talk about the class divide between black spokespeople and black people, which I think is an important thing. It’s as though black intellectuals have been made to take the place of civil rights leaders, now that we say that we don’t have any, because nobody’s paying attention to the NAACP, or other such groups. We turn to black intellectuals to take the positions and to speak in the way that civil rights leaders used to. Yet often, black intellectuals aren’t civil rights leaders and actually shouldn’t be, since the two aren’t quite the same.\n\nAs for Kanye West, he wouldn’t be the first black star to say something stupid. And I think that a lot of people who listen to his music can make the distinction. He didn’t just say something about Trump—he said something really ignorant about the Civil War. He wouldn’t be the first entertainer—black or white—to be ignorant about American history. The saddest thing about Michael Jackson was how badly educated he was, as someone who had grown up having tutors on the road. He didn’t know a thing.\n\nOP: Let me play the age card, as the oldest person here at this table— and that includes you, Bob. I have this really strange feeling of déjà vu. When I came to this country almost fifty years ago, we were having this same debate. We were in the middle of it! And my response to it was to write a book, published in 1977, called Ethnic Chauvinism: The Reactionary Impulse. In the 70’s we were going through something called the ethnic revival. You are all too young to remember that. And I thought that all this was getting out of hand. Over the years I came to believe we’d gotten over that, in part because of the Civil Rights Movement, which had several major achievements, apart from the growth of the black middle class. But I’ve had to accept that the ethnic revival and ethnic chauvinism are not things entirely of the past.\n\nWhen I visited this country for the first time, in the early 60s, there really were two Americas. I’ll never forget. I stayed at my aunt’s, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, for three months. And towards the end of the three months, I remember turning towards my aunt and saying, “I’ve been here for three months and I’ve not met a single white person! And as a matter of fact, I’ve not met a single black American—not in any kind of meaningful relationship.” This was a very segregated society, a white society. The Talking Heads on television were all white. You opened the New Yorker, it was all white. Even in the New York Times, blacks were represented mainly in the murder reports. It was the absence of blacks in most areas of American life that was impressive to me.\n\nBut something profound happened. Blacks became, in many important respects in the public sphere, a profound presence in America. In many ways they define American society. Their influence on the popular culture is out of all proportion to their numbers; one cannot imagine popular culture without seeing black persons. A dominant part of the Democratic party is comprised of black people. We had a black president which, for me, was the culmination of this movement of blacks in the public sphere. We know a lot about failures and persisting problems, but to neglect what has happened to American society in these decades is to miss something extraordinary. I find myself wondering about all of this in my relationship with graduate students, who often talk as if nothing significant has happened. And I don’t know how to explain that.\n\nOf course there is no such thing as a unified black culture. The thing that we used to call “black” people doesn’t exist any more, apart from what we mean when we say “people of color.” What I’m getting at is the remarkable diversity within the black community, starting with class. Those class differences in the 60s really didn’t matter as much as they do now. But I’m especially interested in the ethnic diversity which has emerged within the black community. One in every three black people in this great state of New York is of West-Indian Caribbean ancestry. While color still remains an important factor, it seems to me that one cannot seriously have an important debate without recognizing the enormous complexity of the black community which has emerged, a complexity not only based in terms of class, but in terms of region, ethnicity, and so on.\n\nWe have had a retrogression with Trumpism, but it seems to me that how we interpret this is going to be very important. Because there are already huge debates within my own discipline over what explains Trump. The original consensus was primarily concerned with globalization and economic resentment. The evidence is becoming increasingly clear that it was racial resentment that was the critical factor. One way or the other, the America we are talking about today is profoundly different than the America to which I returned in 1970. And I feel like we are still talking about that America, which is also what irritates me about Coates. To pretend that the election of a black president meant nothing strikes me as just absolutely weird. We have to acknowledge the existing sociological and political realities, so as to acknowledge that this is a different world we’re in. This is not the old Jim Crow, and it’s ridiculous to act as though it is. But that’s where we are. Complete refusal to acknowledge the changes. We have to accept them and then ask ourselves what exactly it is that we’re dealing with here. Obviously there is a problem: we have a racist asshole as a president, he has a hoard of racists supporting him. But then racists were always there. And yet this is a profoundly different society. We cannot talk as if we’re confronting what James Baldwin saw in the 1960s. Am I wrong?\n\nTCW: There can be two profoundly different realities at once, right? There can be a profound, racist core that provides a foundation upon which Trump can attract support, and we can also be making progress—and be a much-improved America, as compared to Baldwin’s time. And I feel like a lot of the commentary doesn’t allow for this complexity of multiple realities. So I’m with you on this, Orlando. JM: Orlando, here’s the thing. I know what you’re talking about, and I’m interested in fixing this problem. And I especially know what you mean about how there was a certain kind of black person who was very angry in 1971. And that person still exists now, just as angry, as if no time has passed. I’m 53, and many people would be surprised to hear that my mother was actually quite the race-man. She even taught a course called “Racism 101” at Temple University in Philadelphia, when that was a newer course for white people to take. And so, there were often people at our house, with combs in their afroed hair. I was about 6 or 7, and I remember there being a certain type of guy who was angry and, looking back, was angry for reasons which make perfect sense when considering how things were, then. The Panthers still existed at that point. And now, I see black undergraduates at Columbia walking across campus with that exact same expression on their faces, trying to dress as much like that as possible. There’s a certain kind of black person who’s just as mad, as if nothing has changed. And it won’t do to call that person crazy—because they aren’t crazy—but you have to wonder why they are pretending that nothing has happened in 50 years. And I think that Ta-Nehisi Coates and William Jelani Cobb, and Melissa Harris-Perry, and Jenée Desmond Harris, Michael Eric Dyson, you know, all the people that you can name—all of these people would listen to you (and I think you’ll take this where I’m coming from) and they’ll think that you’re out of touch, that you’re a person who has gotten beyond a certain age, and that you just don’t know. And what you don’t know, according to them, is the cops—and this is what intellectuals interested in race at this point have to focus more on than we usually do. Why that person is still sitting on the same couch now, with his lips stuck out as though nothing has happened in this vastly changed America, is this myth about how all of our lives are constantly constrained and determined by having to be afraid of the police at all times. And if we don’t counter that myth—if we don’t work on that with data—the discussion is just going to sit still. Also—to go back to another thing you mentioned, Orlando—why is it that so many people pretend? You’re saying it’s partly that when things become so much better, it’s easier to focus on the details. I want to ask you a genuine question, as you’re a sociologist and I’m not: is part of it that it’s a handy way for a person who happens to be black to find a sense of group membership? As human beings, we seek the warmth of a group, and maybe, as you become ever more middle class and affluent, you’re less organically connected to what we might think of as “true” blackness, and so you want a group. There’s someone I am very close to, in whom I have seen this happen over the past thirty years—the idea that you feel a fellowship with people based on this oppression you supposedly always feel. And that means that you’re not going to let go of that picture of things. So, nobody’s crazy, nobody’s in willful denial, but I do think that a lot of people are getting a certain warmth and comfort out of this pretending. OP: Okay. That seems persuasive to me—up to a point. And yet you know, this isn’t just a black problem. I’ve spent a lot of time reading about Jewish Americans. So much of what John just said applies also to Jewish Americans. Once, I went to speak to a group of older Jewish people in a very wealthy synagogue in Washington, and I was discussing segregation, and they were making exactly this point—that they grew up in a segregated America, which they’re old enough to remember. They said exactly what John just said—that several of their colleagues lived within Jewish communities and were invested in Jewishness for purposes of a felt organic connection. There’s a fascinating book called How Jews Became White Folks and What That Says About Race in America [1998], about how though Jews ostensibly gained their whiteness, they still felt the need for community and identity. We black people are not the only group of people to have gone through this sort of process. In the conversation about identity, I’m saying that the reason why my upper-middle class graduate students are looking at me as if I’m out of touch is linked to the identity-searching that still has them in its grip. I grew up as a poor person in the poorest part of a poor colony, and when I look at my students I think, “Okay, well, your daddy was a lawyer and your mama was a doctor, and you’re looking at me and thinking that I don’t know what I am talking about…” And maybe that’s fair enough. I hope not. But I do think that whatever it is, these students are somewhat different than the boy John saw in his mother’s home, the angry black boy with the comb in his hair. Because that boy went through Jim Crow, alright? You know what I mean? That was not a middle-class person. That was real. And this is something else—when an upper middle-class black person looks at me and talks to me about the anguish of being black. On one level, I suppose it’s real—because if you think it’s real, it’s real—but on another level, it’s hard to take too seriously. And this is where I’m at right now. I think other groups of people went through this, and prompted similar confusions and questions. MJ: Women, LGBTQ people…all of these groups are grappling with genuine issues and legacies of exclusion. I also want to say, parenthetically, that black women are worried about cops, too, but I understand that that’s not at the core in the same way it is for black men. Maybe this is going back to what we were saying much earlier about intellectual and linguistic distinctions. The fact is that, class notwithstanding, expectations rise in people. If your family has done better, they are telling you that things are going to be better for you, that you’re not going to go through the same things that they did. And major aggressions are not the same thing as micro-aggressions. The moments of bigotry that my parents experienced at the University of Chicago and the University of Southern California were far more vicious than anything I experienced at Brandeis, or Columbia, or the University of Chicago Laboratory School. But I still experienced some. Let’s talk about class: everybody can tell you that as you move up in class, you begin to notice all kinds of things that range from the words people use to little slights that you never would have noticed before. Yet once you’re in a particular group, you see them, you feel them, and you are made to feel them. And I think that is what your, my, all of our students are experiencing: the legacy of raised expectations and of, in some ways, naïveté, but also of genuine hopes. Maybe, yes, a certain kind of grandiosity; there is a kind of solidarity in grandiosity that can come from legacies of aggression and kind of taking their place in that honor roll. But micro-aggressions are real. We need a much subtler, finer language for it. And we need to make cultural, emotional, and sociological distinctions, and perhaps that’s what we’re not trying hard enough to do. JM: I agree completely. Micro-aggressions are real, and there indeed needed to be a word for them. And I think that micro-aggressions are an important thing to talk about. What disturbs me is the idea that you’re supposed to collapse in front of them. I’m too old to get that. If some person gives you a funny look, or if you don’t get chosen for some group, or if somebody asks you where you’re from and you’re from Cleveland, frankly, it just doesn’t matter. It shouldn’t matter. MJ: If it matters to that person, then they have to find an intelligent way to cope with that mattering. If it matters, it matters. We always say to people, “Get over it.” But what if you can’t get over it? Then, you start getting neurotic, you start acting out, et cetera. So, you know, you find a way. Everybody doesn’t have the same… DP: I sort of don’t know where to start. I thought we had sort of indicated that this was a very complex question with many aspects…And so here I go. When I was growing up, the only place we could swim was the Jewish Community Center. The kids that asked you home were Jewish, because they didn’t know any better, but also because they wanted to know you. Twenty years doesn’t seem very long to me now, but when I was young, it did, and it’s only now that I see how soon we were after World War II, and the effects that all that had on postwar life. When the Black-Jewish coalition fell apart in the late 70s and early 80s, it was a big trauma, really. MJ: Yep, it sure was. DP: And it’s only now that we’re sort of getting over it by forming new coalitions.\n\nAnother big trauma at the time was a general falling apart of coalitions, in general. A lot of blacks asserted a kind of black separatism. And in order to feel the tragedy of that, we would have to read something like How I Became Hettie Jones by Hettie Jones. And the world LeRoy Jones walked away from to become Amiri Barka is a dream culture of integration and mixed things going on. It was a real tragedy. I’m not saying that black America didn’t need to go through that in order to come away with a kind of black consciousness, but we take for granted now that that didn’t exist before the 60s. When I was in school, the people who were saying that I wasn’t black enough, or that I was an Uncle Tom, were black kids richer than I was. It’s always that a black authenticity is something militant, something of the street, something of the ghetto, and we still have that. The attraction of hip-hop for so many people is that it’s transgressive, which is why young white guys liked it as much as young black guys.\n\nMJ: “Have you ever seen the crowd goin’ apeshit?” DP: There are so many angry things I’d meant to say, but I’ve forgotten them all now. But, you know, in the 17th century, the House of Burgesses in Virginia ruled that an African could be a slave owner, but a European couldn’t be brought into slavery. So, whiteness was invented then, and we’ve lived with this the whole time. Many things have changed, because change is not uniform, and things go on at different times. All through the Obama years, everyone said “We have a black president,” yet the living conditions for most black people are the same as they were in 1960. And no one could account for that.\n\nAt the same time, it’s important for blacks in the Democratic party to think of itself as a voting bloc. If the same number of people turned out in Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Detroit in 2016 as those who voted in 2012, then Hillary Clinton would have won the electoral college. What this election showed us is that there’s no such thing as not voting. This is what you get—this kind of minority government. I don’t think that white supremacy defines most white people. I don’t even think that white privilege defines most white people. I think white people have as hard a time being white as anyone else, especially now that white has come to mean this, and black still means that. You know, that white is “have” and black is “have not”; white is “luck” and “the future” and black is something like “no future.” These are kind of almost symbolic categories or allegorical words. They describe a social reality, but they also describe destinies, as Americans. You can be with the winners; you can be with the losers. And behind it all is this terror of the future and of what’s happening in the world, which is driving everyone’s fear of scarcity, status, and what’s happening in America. The answers aren’t simple… I’ve lost my point. Shit. I had such angry things to say but…I just couldn’t disagree more with some of the things being said…\n\nOP: Nothing you’ve said sounds angry. DP: Well, I don’t speak that way, but… OP: Well, how do you think it’s angry? DP: Well, I think there’s still a lot of things that black people go through that other people don’t. I haven’t lived in a black neighborhood since I was a child, and I see, in the neighborhood in which I now live, that people live very differently than the way white people live. Even the black middle class is different from the white middle class, because the black middle class is based primarily on earnings rather than assets. And that’s a big difference when it comes to fragility, stability, and what you can pass onto your children. MJ: And how you behave. DP: These discrepancies and challenges are real. OP: Absolutely. Blacks are as segregated now as they were in 1970. And black schools are slightly more segregated now than they were in 1970. DP: But this is in the context of the entire school system falling apart. OP: Yes. And you haven’t said anything that I don’t fully agree with. This is consistent with everything I said earlier, about the complexity of what we’re dealing with now. I don’t want to anticipate too much what I am going to say on Sunday, but we are agreeing on things. Everything you’ve said is perfectly true. DP: I have to think of something else, then. No more Mr. Nice Guy. RB: There have been several references to James Baldwin—Thomas, Darryl, Orlando. And there’s a passage in one of Thomas’s writings in which he cites the Nigerian-American writer, Teju Cole, who—Thomas says—rejects what he interprets as James Baldwin’s self-abnegation in the face of European high culture: “what he loves does not love him in return.” I’m interested in this—talking about whether there has been a significant alteration as we move from Baldwin’s moment to the moment of Teju Cole. “This is where,” writes Teju Cole, “I part company with Baldwin,” asserting that “I am not an interloper when I look at a Rembrandt portrait.” I am not an interloper when I look at a Rembrandt portrait. And that may mark one significant change as we move from one very important black writer, James Baldwin, to Teju Cole. MJ: And two very different generations. RB: Exactly, that’s what I am trying to suggest. Thomas, do you want to talk a little about that? TCW: This sense of not being alienated in the world is critically important. For example, I take for granted that my father, who grew up in the Jim Crow South, no matter what changes materially in his life, can never feel what I do. That’s ingrained in him. I live in Paris, and I feel like all of this culture is just as accessible to me as for my wife—maybe even more so, as I’ve put in more work to access it. And I don’t think she can’t access John Coltrane because she’s white and French. The experiences that I’ve had don’t contradict the idea that anything human cannot be alien to me. And my dad wanted something like that, but he would definitely fall into Baldwin’s category. What I think Orlando was getting at was that the shift we see in Teju Cole hasn’t happened for lots of black people. Or at least for some of them there’s a kind of dishonesty in denying that a change has occurred. DP: Baldwin also said that he didn’t feel an affinity for Shakespeare. And he read all the time. It shocked Mary McCarthy how much Baldwin read. But he said some very ignorant, or hostile, things about European culture in his time. The problem with quoting Baldwin is the same problem encountered when quoting Malcolm X: there’s so much of it, and you can always find the statement you need at a given moment. RB: But would you agree, as you just said, that there is a very decided shift of perspective from Baldwin to Cole? TCW: To your question, as well as to the earlier point about micro-aggressions, I want to mention a moment that I included in my book: It happened when I was a newlywed with my wife, who is Parisian, and we were at her grandmother’s country house in Normandy. Her grandmother is from a much older, wealthier generation that’s accustomed to much greater ease and mastery in the world that even my wife, as a white woman, doesn’t know at all. It’s not racial so much as generational and a matter of class, representative of a time before global competition and things like that. Anyway, this woman has, on her coffee table, a porcelain head which, I realize when looking at it, is a slave head. And I think that counts as a micro-aggression: a visual representation of your inferiority in the room. But she’s super nice, she loves me, she’s extremely kind to my father, who is clearly a black man. And, in reality, we are making a multi-ethnic, multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-national, multi-linguistic family work, and we love each other. And I am trying to think through and gauge how mad I am supposed to be about this thing… DP: Not at all… TCW: Maybe not at all. My wife and her cousins would try to hide it when my grandmother-in-law wasn’t there, but sometimes there’s not a diplomatic way to do that, and the head would just be there, and everyone would be super uncomfortable. But my grandmother-in-law would have no idea that anyone could be uncomfortable… DP: Is it a caricature, or… TCW: It’s a big-lipped, super dark-skinned slave head. You open the top of the thing and you put bonbons and your keys inside. But the thing is, I would get angry about it, at first, and my wife and I could argue, and we could argue until we started laughing, because I realized at some point that I am playing a role, that that anger isn’t my own, that anger belongs to someone else, and that micro-aggression isn’t the realest aspect of my lived experience, not even of my black lived experience. My black lived experience is this: my family knows I’m black, and encounters me as an equal, and I think that they’re aware that I’m better-educated than they are… DP: So you can accept them. TCW: Exactly. So I can accept them. While trying not to be a total sellout, I have to ask myself: “Are you strong enough to get through that?” And everything about the way I was raised prepared me to get through that. It doesn’t debilitate me. DP: Black people used to collect that type of thing. TCW: I have black friends whose fathers used to collect that type of thing. MJ: I have dolls in my house, yeah. TCW: I mean, it’s different when her grandmother collects it than when you collect it. DP: Everyone’s into it now. All these Venetian lamps that people used to be ashamed of have come down out of the attic. You can’t get anything for a bargain anymore if it’s black representation. It’s true! You used to be able to pick up this stuff at auctions. And you can’t anymore because everyone’s into it. TCW: The French love it. They never gave it up, and they never gave it away. DP: They never hid it, either. TCW: And it’s something that I don’t think is a good thing—I don’t think it’s a fine thing. But I don’t think that it means everything about my life or my experience, either. I have a lot more experiences that are more meaningful than this. OP: There are all kinds of complexities here. We have to distinguish between conscious and unconscious micro-aggressions…and this complexity I’d rather leave to my literary colleagues. MJ: Let’s go with deep versus shallow micro-aggressions. TCW: But my understanding of micro-aggressions is that intent can never matter. I think that it can’t matter. MJ: I’m not sure…There used to be a joke among black people that the only time the word “articulate” was used was when bourgeois white people were talking about an educated black person, particularly a news commentator. And this has changed. I hear the world “articulate” flutter around a lot now. But I also had a white friend say, “You know, it’s very interesting how often white people feel compelled to say the word ‘niggardly’ when they’re around a black person.” I swear to God, a white person who has mixed race children told me this. So, you know, the unconscious exists. As does the subconscious. AUDIENCE MEMBER 1: I’m uncomfortable with the notion that we might try to move beyond being a black person, as that’s a main part of my own experience. Or maybe I’m not so much uncomfortable as puzzled. OP: It’s impossible for me to dissociate myself from the fact that I grew up as a working-class Jamaican. It’s also impossible to dissociate myself from being a black person in America. What’s important is the degree of self-consciousness that I have about this. I would rather be someone who can simply be myself in a way which will express and reflect all of the things that went into my becoming who I am, and that will always involve my Jamaican-ness, and that will always involve my 50 years living here as a black person. It’s impossible to escape the reality of what you were, of how you grew up, of all the people you knew, of all the people who hated and loved you, and so on—most of whom, in my case, were black and Jamaican. There’s no way I can ever escape that. What we’re talking about is how self-conscious I’m going to be in defining that. Is it possible to live in a world in which I can just be myself? You know certain kinds of exaggerated self-consciousness can distort your sense of self. If I go around pretending to be a Jamaican nationalist, I’m being extremely unfaithful to myself, because I am not. If I go around insistently articulating my blackness as if that completely defined me that would be inauthentic. That’s all we’re getting at here. Can you accept that? AUDIENCE MEMBER 1: What if I feel like my most authentic self is holding onto being black? Is there a contradiction between being a black intellectual and yet holding on to black identity, insisting on it? JM: One answer to that might be rage. Of course, you want to seek social justice, because racism and structural racism exist. What some of us might question is whether the feeling that you might have, in 2019, is rage—that you feel same way as the guy who my mother invited over to our house, fifty years ago. Because conditions have changed, that’s all. It’s not as if you needn’t be concerned. The whole issue about whether we want to get beyond race is a very local one. You might feel that you don’t want to think of yourself as not black, and that makes perfect sense. I don’t think of myself as not black, either. I’ll use myself as a litmus test: my wife is quite white. I have two daughters, and one of them is classic high yellow. Here, in 2019, I find myself wondering whether or not my daughter is going to grow up to be “black,” by which I mean black-identifying. If it were twenty years ago or more, there would be no question at all. But in today’s world, and in the neighborhood that we live in, I think that she might not be thinking of herself as, if you will, “African-American.” She’s light, and in terms of cultural traits associated with being black, she may not develop any. And if you can hear that and not flinch, that’s what we mean by getting past race—that you let go of the idea that one drop means that you better know what color you are, especially because you’re going to have to think about how the cops are going to treat you, or whatever it is, in this context of talking about a young girl who’s light-skinned. It’s not as if we’re going to pretend that race doesn’t exist, but we’re going to let go of the balkanizing tendencies that frankly remind me of The Birth of a Nation. So, two things: 1) letting go of race doesn’t mean that you’re not black. It just means that we want to get beyond D.W. Griffith. 2) If you think that I’m crazy in questioning that you be enraged, hear this: the bit about the cops that’s been served to you is vastly distorted, and while I know that there are other things, the cops are central. And that’s the only thing I can think of that would evince rage in 2019. DP: When we talk about black life and black history, it’s important to remember that we’re talking about American life and American history, since the destiny of the country has always been mixed with race and racial destiny. But I don’t think that black intellectuals do anything different from white intellectuals or anyone else. I think that when we talk about black lives, we’re forgetting about the universality of the lessons that can be gained. They’re not just for black people—they’re for everyone. There are many things that go into being a black intellectual that you cannot see, or do not know—it’s not just the things you write about. And every other black intellectual I know has many other interests. You can’t talk to someone more interested in classical dance than Margo Jefferson. There are lots of things that go into your identity as a black intellectual, many of them white and not immediately bearing on what you’re writing about, but your experience as a human being certainly informs what you think of historical and social questions. So, maybe it’s not rage you’re feeling, but simply the passion of being young and alive and looking for answers. And it’s a wonderful place to be. Stay that way. AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: You mentioned the cops, and the police, and the way that things have changed. And yet there is such a thing as trauma, and collective memory. The cops may not play so much a role in our present life, but there may be people in our families who have been impacted by cops and by mass incarceration. It may not necessarily be that a cop is going to take your life, or that you have to walk around wondering about that. And yet the cops exist, they can deprive you of all sorts of things. JM: Of course. The question is whether black men are preyed upon and/or killed by the cops disproportionately to their numbers in the population. They aren’t. The facts are in. AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: Sure, that’s a fact. But it’s worth considering what the state can do through law enforcement—not just taking one’s life, but depriving one of liberty. JM: Sure. But the question is whether we should think of that as racialized. In 1965, yeah. In 1975, no doubt. But things do change. So yes, it’s traumatic if your father is up the river. But the question is whether that’s a black problem. And I thought it was, until about two years ago when I had a very interesting conversation with my constant interlocutor, Glenn Loury. What we’ve been fed is not true. I maintain that if we weren’t taught that particular message, then all of the other things that black people suffer—and racism has something to do with a lot of them—would not condition this idea that our responsibility is to have the same rage that Huey P. Newton did. And in terms of disproportionate incarceration, it’s complicated. Despite what Michele Alexander put forth—God bless her, I wish her well—it’s not a new Jim Crow. These issues are much more complex than they seem when you refer to people in positions of power not liking black people and deciding to lock us all up. That’s a good story, but that’s not how it works. Not anymore. And you can consult people like Michael Fortner, who are black and who grew up poor, to see how we got where we are today. I think that we are encouraged, as black intellectuals—if we are going to call it that—to oversimplify and claim that in our case, and only in our case, things really haven’t changed much. It won’t do. That’s all I’m saying. It’s not that I’m denying people’s pain, or that I’m denying what the cops were like not too terribly long ago, but this is the thing: thank God it’s changed. And yet notice how uncomfortable it makes all of us for me to say that. We feel like we’re supposed to not admit that it’s changed, no matter what the numbers say. I refuse. I will not allow that to be the way that America’s intelligentsia thinks, and boy, am I gonna catch hell for it. DP: Yeah. JM: But I’m gonna keep fighting because the numbers are crystal clear. I am not just expressing an opinion. DP: Right. The difference between what Michele Alexander says and what James Forman Jr. says is this: Forman is saying that black communities themselves supported tougher prison laws for drug offenses. But Alexander’s not making up the numbers of black men in prison. Nobody is. That comes from somewhere. JM: But was it racism, either deliberate and face-to-face, or structural? I think that that’s an oversimplified way of looking at how we got to this point. There are too many black men in prison and that needs to be fixed— and thank God the ice is breaking—but was the reason for that something that should make you enraged that white people aren’t good to black people? I don’t think so. DP: Except that the policing of black men has been the experience of black people in this country since we got here. The plantation system was organized to police the population; immediately after the Civil War, vagrancy laws were passed in many southern states and used as a tool of controlling the men who were on the roads looking for their families who’d been sold away. This policing of the black population has been a part of social policy since we got here. Nobody made that up. It’s just been around for so long that we’re looking for other reasons. JM: But Darryl, are you really supposing that I don’t know those things or am denying them? All of those things are very real, but my question is, what now? How should we feel right here, in 2019? DP: Obama should have pardoned all the marijuana offenders. JM: I agree with that. AUDIENCE MEMBER 3: A former colleague of mine has authorized me and several people to speak about this…and I wasn’t going to bring it up until the last several comments here. A professor at Skidmore College, who was not tenured, was living near Saratoga Hospital in a condominium complex. He was a single parent because his wife was in Uganda, and a few months ago, his toddler son got out of the apartment for just a moment, no more than a minute or two, and the neighbor called the cops and this man was arrested for endangering the welfare of his child. He was called into the Dean’s office. Now, I realize that endangering the welfare of a child sounds alarming if you’re an administrator of a college, but what happened after that? The charges were ultimately dropped! And there was no real sensitivity towards this issue on the part of the college administration, even though we are publicly doing “everything we can” to fight the injustices of society at large. And even though the charges were dropped… AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: The expenses for the attorney come to $2,000. Not everyone has access to that kind of money. AUDIENCE MEMBER 3: And ultimately the man’s contract was renewed, albeit with a line, “And if there’s anything else…” What do they mean, anything else? The charges were dismissed. There was no sensitivity. And when I raised this issue on the floor with the faculty, a lot of people acted as if they didn’t know about it, though I later found out that while he told a lot of people, there was simply no outrage. And as far as I’m concerned, that’s where we are now. OP: Can I ask you something? In Saratoga Springs, if a white parent had allowed his or her child to run around in the street, are you saying the cops would not bring down charges of child endangerment? AUDIENCE MEMBER 3: But he never actually got out of the building. He actually just knocked on his neighbor’s door. It’s not as if the neighbor just came upon a neglected or abandoned child. And I don’t think there’s a chance that any of my white colleagues would be called on for that. JM: They wouldn’t have. You’re right. Last summer, I wrote an article called “Starbucks and the Swimming Pool.” What that was about was that every week, something you just described happens—where you know that if it had been a white kid, the something wouldn’t have happened. Every week, something like that happens to a black person: someone is barbequing on the side of a lake and someone calls the cops on them. That is real, and that is one of the things that I mean when I say that racism exists. Racist bias exists. And this is where, Margo, you and I might have a disagreement: I’m saying yes, that stuff is real, and I can even dredge up one thing that happened to me in my life, but I have a problem with the idea that those things—as opposed to the sorts of things that used to happen in the past—define your life, as well as the idea that those things constitute something that black America should be as enraged about as we were enraged before. I don’t mean this as hyperbole, and I’m getting a cold, so my voice sounds a little sharp, and I don’t mean for it to sound this way, but I’m going to say it: if any of you implies that one of those Starbucks or swimming pool incidents, or others like them, defines my life, and suggests that I should fall to pieces either in front of the person or when I go back to my apartment, I am insulted. I cannot think of any other group of human beings who are thought of as so delicate as that. So, these things ought to be decried. One of the great things about social media is that we hear about them every week. All of this has been happening forever, but now we can hear about it, and so maybe there’ll be some movement on it. But does it mean that we aren’t at home in America and that something that happens to some guy in Oakland defines his entire 50-year life? No. I feel like I have to defend that man. MJ: I would entirely agree with you that it does not define that man’s—or woman’s—life unless that happens to that man every day of his life, 24 hours a day. But again, I would say that this whole “You’re too damn delicate when you really get angry and really act up and act out”— black people are always charged with this, women are charged with this, gay people are charged with this. The fact is that I have no problem with rage. My question is, how do you proportion it, how do you sift through it, how do you channel it into action and thoughts that are useful, and that are not self-destructive? We need rage. But we need intelligent uses of rage and we need a sense of its historical space. There’s plenty to be angry about, and that anger does not have to define your life. It is one of the many aspects of what one makes of discrimination, sorrow, grief, depression—all of that. AUDIENCE MEMBER 4: I think what’s often missing in conversations like this is a reminder of developmental arcs, and the importance of what it was like to feel 18 versus what it’s like to feel 51. Sometimes, I’m as angry as I was when I was 18—not all the time, thankfully. It’s easier for me to let things wash off my back than it is for some of my students. And I guess what I regret sometimes is this culture that seems to be clicking its tongues at younger people who are angry. And there’s a way in which young people are rightfully angry. It’s part of what we go through to get to the other side. You want to hang onto some of that anger, but not be quite as angry as we were. MJ: Or at least we want more pitches and tonalities to our anger. AUDIENCE MEMBER 4: Exactly. I just want to remember ages 18-21, college-age, is a very different time, particularly if you find yourself for the first time at a predominantly white institution, as a black person, or an openly gay person. These are moments punctuated by rage and the solidification of identity that seem important developmentally. AUDIENCE MEMBER 5: I recently visited the Legacy Museum and Lynching Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama, and then read Bryan Stevenson’s book [Just Mercy], where he talks a lot about the criminal justice system. And he went to Montgomery, to live there and to work on death row cases. What this young man [gesturing to Audience Member 1] talked about, regarding generations of incarceration, really speaks to what Bryan Stevenson is doing… MJ: You’re talking about trauma studies, in part, as well. AUDIENCE MEMBER 5: Yes, as well as the criminal justice system—and I don’t just mean arrests, but black incarceration and death-row incarceration. Stevenson’s book reads like a novel: he describes case after case, where people ended up on death row for all kinds of reasons that have nothing to do with what they did wrong, or what they didn’t do. And in terms of African American Civil Rights leaders, Bryan Stevenson is a major force. For the young folks here who aren’t familiar with his work, I suggest that you look at his book Just Mercy which is amazing, and go to the Legacy Museum which is really just one room that goes from slavery, to Jim Crow, to mass incarceration. And he lays out the history almost year by year. I just want to encourage people to go to the museum and take in the knowledge that he has amassed in a really radical way. JM: This is the hardest thing. Those disproportions some people are referring to are real. They have to be changed. But those disproportions are not completely due to racist bias, are not even due to what we would call structural racism. And that’s hard to fasten upon. And I know it sounds like I’m some kind of naive denialist. But what we take from a disproportion of, say, black men on death row is, 1) we want to make sure that that stops, and 2) we have to realize that talking about how white people hold on to their privilege isn’t going to be what stops that. Because that’s not simply what created it, nor was it even 80% of what created it. It was more complicated than that. And you might disagree, but I just hope that we can be open to this kind of disagreement. It’s not that I don’t know the score, it’s not that I don’t read, it’s not that I don’t like black people, nor that I’m a Pollyanna. I’m a very pessimistic person. It’s that social history is many threaded. Whenever you read about these stories, it turns out to be more complicated. For example, what happened recently in Covington, Kentucky. You know, you see this picture of this sneering kid in front of this Native American. And then you look at the whole two hours and you see what a complicated business that whole thing was. That’s all that I mean. Yes, we need to read about death-row and the disproportionate number of black men on it. But, as a white person—and I’m sorry, here I’m putting myself in your head—I’m not sure that the white person is supposed to be looking at that and feel like “I’m complicit, it’s my fault, and that it’s all my race’s and all of my fellow white people’s racism that put that man there.” I think that you should have thought that in 1932, but I don’t think that that’s the way it is now. TCW: I also think that one of the key words here is “affluent,” and I think that race, when it intersects with poverty or the cultural signifiers of such, is a very potent thing in our minds. But I can’t think of any instances or situations where someone like Darryl or John would have allowed them to define their lives completely. I certainly have never experienced that kind of impression in my life. At the same time, we have to acknowledge that there are many black experiences, even as we concede that many millions of black people are having experiences like mine, like John’s, never intersecting with the criminal justice system. I’ve never had a problem with the criminal justice system. And that’s still a real black life. And that doesn’t deracinate me. I think that a lot of times when we’re talking about race, culture, and ethnicity, we’re also really talking about class. JM: It is our duty to know these histories and to be as informed as possible. 1932 is not that far back, so we need to understand those legacies and those emotional resonances. OP: It’s our duty, also, to know just what the sociological and criminological facts are. There’s a lot of work done on death row and the death penalty. We have a pretty good idea of what the biases are. The leading scholar of incarcerations, a former colleague of mine named Bruce Weston, was the editor of what is supposed to be the definitive work on incarceration put together by the American Academy of Sciences, a 500-page volume. And there was not a single chapter in that volume on the question of violence. Interestingly, Bruce and several other criminologists have recently stated that they must bring in an understanding of the issue of violence. All studies I’m acquainted with show that the criminal justice system has profound racial biases, and that one of the main factors accounting for increasing incarceration is the fact that attorneys and prosecutors have a considerable amount of leeway in who they charge and who they don’t. That has been emphasized as a critical factor. But one has to take account of the fact that the black homicide rate is eight times greater than the white homicide rate: an unpleasant fact. We have to allow for the possibility that there may be more people in prison of a certain group because they commit more crimes. Now, we have factored that in, but the proportions are still much greater than they should be. A lot of work has been done on this, and as John said, it’s not as simple as it first appears. Even a lot of the die-hard scholars have had to backtrack a bit, and are now saying that, while there’s a strong element of racism involved, we have to consider other aspects of the situation. You won’t get that from Ta-Nehisi Coates, who comes out with completely erroneous statements. He wrote a cover story in the Atlantic on the black family and incarceration. Afterwards, the Atlantic asked me to write a response to it. And after reading it, I just thought, no, absolutely not, because he hasn’t even taken the trouble to acquaint himself with the basic facts. It’s simply not true that incarceration is causing the decline of, or the problems within, the black family. It’s the other way around! And if you say that, you know what kind of response you’re going to get. Coates simply won’t acknowledge the obvious. Of course, a woman whose lover is in prison is having difficulties. But what does this tell us? To claim that the crisis of the black middle-class family is the result of incarceration, in the face of overwhelming sociological evidence to the contrary, is totally irresponsible. DP: One of the things that bothers me about Coates and his species of Afro-pessimism or fatalism is that a large part of it is grounded in the idea that black people and black culture are not pathological, that this is not an expression of any pathology. That we are healthy and society is sick. I’m afraid that this can’t be true. Ruling out the possibility of looking at black life as having pathological aspects cuts us off from exploring problems and coming up with solutions. You can’t say, “We’re healthy, but the society’s not.” It doesn’t separate that way, for me. There’s a lot of suffering that we don’t face. And mass incarceration aside, there are more poor people who are white in the United States than poor people who are black, yet black people remain the face of poverty. AUDIENCE MEMBER 6: Two-part question. The first part is somewhat open-ended. It seems to me that, over the course of your conversation—even just now—the subject of class has kind of risen up and skittered away. I would just like to invite more thinking about that conjunction between race and class, and how their intersection might open up some other pathways that don’t point towards rage. The second question is to put some pressure on the other identity category in the conference title, namely the word intellectuals. I want to ask whether being an intellectual is itself its own social and psychological identity position. I raise that because even before I knew that I was from a petit bourgeois family, or even before I knew that I was Italian-American, and even before I knew I was queer, I knew that I had some intellectual differences of some kind. And with all due respect to Gramsci, who says that every human being has the capacity for intellect and for being an intellectual, I knew from age 3, when I was beginning to read, that I was growing up in an anti-intellectual family, and that the culture was anti-intellectual. So, I wonder if thinking of such things substantially alters your perspective on the question you’ve been discussing. DP: We have to go now. JM: Black intellectuals don’t talk much about class because if you’re a middle-class black person, you are taught very firmly not to distinguish yourself from your poorer brothers and sisters. I was taught that. To think of yourself as belonging to a different class is to deny that the cops don’t like you either. I’m oversimplifying only slightly. So, I skitter away from talking about that because I feel that I would be interpreted as being snobbish, to say that there are any differences between me and poor black people. Those differences are there, they are profound, but I will never write about them, and I’m uncomfortable talking about it now. As far as Gramsci is concerned, the problem is that one is taught just as explicitly that to be a black intellectual is to pretend that you’re a black Gramsci. The idea is that we’re suffering from the implacable kind of impression that Gramsci was writing about, believing that we must model all of our actions and positions as a kind of performance of politics. I think that the idea of that as the only valid or the most interesting way of being a black intellectual is anti-empirical, and also highly limiting of black endeavor, and I question it. OP: There’s one exception to your impression, and that’s black sociologists. Because we do spend an awful lot of time talking about class. Too much. Intersectionality is big, among sociologists—we invented the term, which takes in gender, class, race, and so on. Sometimes I feel like that’s all we ever talk about. But these are critical issues. There can be no doubt that a lot of what we’re attributing to race has a lot to do with class and poverty. And we can see that by simply making comparisons and seeing how other poor people behave. There are interesting studies contrasting the behavior of poor and working-class blacks and Latinos. That’s intersectionality. Per your second question, it’s a hard thing, being an intellectual—spending all of your life thinking about thinking. It isn’t what most people do. We are odd, and we should always remember our oddity. I always get a funny feeling whenever a cleaning or landscaping person comes to my house and always sees me sitting down at my desk. They must find me very weird. And I can understand that that’s the case. This goes back to the first question raised here by a young and clearly budding intellectual. I spent a good deal of time studying black youth in Boston, and for the most part they don’t have your concerns. The interesting thing emerging in the sociology of black youth is that, if you ask them, “What do you think accounts for the fact that you’re in this really difficult situation?” in most cases, in over 90% of the cases, the answer is this: “I fucked up.” And when asked by the eager sociologist, with bated breath, “Well, what about race?” invariably, the answer is “Of course race is important. The police are pigs. I know all that. But that’s not why I’m in this shit.” And this has come up over and over again. And it presents quite a dilemma for sociologists. One of the funniest things is to see a sociologist who is reading his interviews and observations, and is trying to come to terms with the fact that his subjects are not cooperating with them by saying the standard thing: “Racism is what got me into this.” Sociologists then say that they are too isolated to understand how structural racism was the cause, while their subjects tend to say simply that they dropped out of school and they shouldn’t have done that, along with other related mistakes. I describe this sort of thing in my 2015 book The Cultural Matrix. It’s patronizing, isn’t it, to deny people’s interpretation of their own situation. And once they start becoming intellectuals—and some of them do become intellectuals—they do start to realize that race is a central factor in their lives. And that’s true, structural racism is an important factor in the reality and the persistence of the ghetto. But I can also tell you that almost every sociological study of non-intellectual black youth comes across this dilemma, where people will not attribute their problems to racism. As intellectuals, of course, we are in a different situation. We know that this situation exists, that perception can be highly individualistic, in a way that can be annoying to sociologists. MJ: I just wanted to say very quickly that I’m obsessed with writing about race…not race. Class, actually. I mean class. What an interesting slip. It’s what I call the secular trinity of race, class, and gender. It is difficult. Like John, I was brought up to feel solidarity with all black people. And in my world, I was also brought up to feel superior to most black people, as well as superior to most white people, but that doesn’t necessarily make it much better, does it? What are the verbs…you document, you dramatize, you reveal, you confess, you examine. It’s very difficult, and shameful in certain ways, because obviously race history demands race solidarity. If we don’t have that, what do we have? On the other hand, there is that legacy, which is partly honorable, that is part of a black—I don’t like the word elite—privileged class that also did do some good things for the race. One is constantly negotiating that. I think that being an intellectual sets some of the same strains in motion: the pressure to be yourself in your work, to honor your mind and temperament and yet, as someone already said, the pressure also to be a black intellectual or a black woman intellectual and to honor those things with as much subtlety and directness as required. It’s very demanding. You were right, John, to divine that the pressures are acute, and Orlando’s right to say that the perceptions of an intellectual may be very different from anyone else’s. RB: There’s a terrific story by Danzy Senna. It’s called “Admission,” 2 and it has to do with a number of the issues we’ve been talking about. And as we’ve all read it, I thought we might use it as a way into questions of class and privilege. The story revolves around a middle-class black family and the headmistress of a private school who is desperate to enroll the child of that family. DP: Let me say right away that it’s a comic story, and that the elite people in the story are at least slightly ridiculous. At the same time, deep in the story, there is a kind of pain about what to choose, what to do. And that’s part of the experience many people are confronting. Parents are going through this now; I have some friends who are just absolutely determined not to send their children to private school, but when I hear this from them, I want to say, “You live in three houses around the globe, so what’s the point of a public school if you want to protect them from class stupidities?” The mother in Danzy’s story is genuinely torn and ambivalent, while the husband is determined not to send his kid to a posh school, even if it is reputed to be first-rate. The husband isn’t exactly the boss in that family, but he does get his way. MJ: I was very interested in the handling of class and gender power hierarchies. I liked the way that diversity was marshalled and appropriated by this school as a form of privilege. “Do not come”—those classic conservative verbotens. “Do not come if”—ah—if you are “conservative” in any way. These are broad oppositions that Senna handled with, I thought, real emotional subtlety. For example, the way the husband, Duncan, who is privileged, and who has had the rewards of being an “iconoclast,” likes to slip into a kind of very simple, black-inflected lingo. It’s a power tool: “I’m black, I haven’t forgotten.” It’s part of a class critique that’s also a form of comedy, which allows us to see the ways in which people are driven by historical, psychological, interior forces that can really thwart logic or just plain sense. It’s both painful and funny to see the wife wrestling with her humiliating longings to have her child in an elite school, and feeling that she needs to learn the rituals and mores of the city’s elite. This came up earlier in our discussion—the rituals and mores of class status, of gender status, of being an intellectual, and of being an intellectual of color. How do you place yourself? How do you attempt to show that you embrace a so-called progressive agenda within the rituals and mores of an elite, which you must master in order to succeed? What can you afford to feel, do, act on, and what must you avoid? DP: That class moment—do you go with this chance, or do you let it go so as to move…what exactly? MJ: I myself have tried to be the umpire in family arguments about just this. Everybody’s childhood comes roaring to the surface as they pretend to be rational. In Senna’s story the mother’s anxieties relate to generations of rearing black children. The fear is if you make one mistake, you are off the path, no matter how much I am protecting you—there is no safety net for you, however privileged you are as a black person. That has changed, but that old fear is still clearly circulating, hovering over the story, and hovering over the mother Cassie more than the father Duncan. TCW: Here I can’t help thinking of Nikole Hannah-Jones’s piece in the New York Times Magazine about consciously choosing to send her child to a working-class/poor public school in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Her husband, I believe, is black, but African or Caribbean, and he was profoundly bothered by the decision of taking a young kid and putting him in a worse school situation than they have to be in. Whereas she works through the logic that for everyone’s kids to do better, educated parents have to put their kids in the local school—that if you take educated families out of those schools, innocent kids are suffering, deprived of a rich learning environment. I’ve thought about this as a parent, from every angle, and I don’t think that I could do that. My father is a very typical black person who grew up in the segregated south, and education was the only thing that could allow his family to have a better life, was the only way that he could get out of a situation where his people were domestic workers and menial laborers. He would kill me if I did something like what Hannah-Jones did, no matter how high-minded it was, and I think that’s a pretty typical reaction. I really relate to the narrator’s position in Senna’s story, because it takes an extraordinary degree of privilege to be as dismissive as the husband Duncan can be about privilege. MJ: In fake black English… TCW: In fake black English, from a family of doctors, no less. There’s lots of irony in Senna’s story, and a level of humor, but also a degree of realism that really resonates with the contemporary black experience. It takes a lot of privilege to be able to not strive for bourgeois markers of success, access, network capital, and things that you need to actually achieve before you can be a bourgeois bohemian. RB: The question of privilege has entered the mainstream—white and black—in unmistakable ways. This was brought home to me a few months ago in Anthony Appiah’s column “The Ethicist” for the New York Times. There was a question put to him by a young white girl, of high-school age, who had been accepted to a privileged private school. She felt that this was somehow a bad thing, that she shouldn’t go. She was on the verge of saying no to the acceptance. Should or should she not say no? And Anthony wrote a characteristically thoughtful response saying, of course you should go. You’re refusing to go when the alternative for you, as you’ve described it, is a far inferior school, which makes it very clear that you must not refuse. Your refusing won’t change the system—it won’t change anything—if you deprive yourself of this advantage. Call it by its rightful name, he says, it is a privilege—but take it. It was, for me, a sign that privilege is on many people’s minds, and that often it is not at all understood. It’s a term promiscuously employed, a sort of a noise-word which has sown more confusion than clarity. DP: It’s such a Protestant issue, privilege. I find it bewildering that a people—who always believed that education was the way out of Egypt—should balk at these opportunities as though they were committing a kind of race treason. It doesn’t make any sense to me, especially as they were always told, education, education, education. People misunderstand privilege the way they misunderstood integration and affirmative action and thought of those things primarily as access to education. But they were never really about that, and yet education became the only thing that affirmative action was about. Presented with chances and advantages, it seems to me a privilege to turn them down, that it’s acting on, or acting out, a certain kind of cultural logic: “it’s better to be déclassé.” I don’t have kids, so I can’t put myself in a parent’s position, but it never seems to me a question—that of where someone should go to school. Saving the school system doesn’t start with my children going to a bad one. There are other things you can do first before you sacrifice your own child. Because people who are sending their kids to public or state schools are saying that to do otherwise is to support “the system,” but these are really broken schools that won’t be fixed in their child’s school career. JM: The story exposes a number of things that people—the characters—are doing wrong, and so I really wanted the mother Cassie to tell the headmistress what’s really entailed in her obsession with landing another trophy black kid in that school. Sure I laughed at her, but if we take seriously what Danzy is saying—and I don’t know how she feels about it—then we must consider this: Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York wants to set aside 20% of slots in the top three high schools for brown students, with test scores not being an issue—the idea being that you must have not brown Indian faces, but brown, black, and Latino faces—so that standards have been changed, rather than making it so that students’ parents know of and have access to testing services that are available. And then you find out that Harvard is calling Asian students “boring people” and not letting them in, meanwhile letting in black and Latino students with substantially lower academic qualifications, talking about how “spunky” they are. You read this in the Times and you’re not supposed to shake your head and say, “That’s the way it’s supposed to be.” You’re supposed to not like it. Because all of that comes from the same place as that headmistress calling the mother, this Cassie character, again and again and eventually showing up at her house, uninvited. And I have no idea how Danzy Senna feels about those issues. But if that passage is telling us something important, we are supposed to question the derailing of affirmative action from what it was originally intended to be. And I’m not sure we’re ready to do that. So, I didn’t think most of this was very funny at all. I have dealt with that woman my whole life, and she wasn’t funny, and she never learned what she was doing wrong. MJ: I have seen that same scenario recently played out just as crudely. I think that many of the parents who bring their kids—black parents, mixed-race parents, Latino parents—to these elite, private schools are told in a code very similar to the one in the story: we’re courting you; it’s “You’ve Been Accepted” day, and here’s what we have to offer you. The “progressive” values are always tucked in. The word “diversity” is used. I don’t think you find out late. You know when you’re applying what your “credentials”—your"
