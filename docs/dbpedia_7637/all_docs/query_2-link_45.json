        "text": "A24 Movies Ranked by Tomatometer\n\nIndependent movie company A24 has built an almost unprecedented level of brand identity and loyalty. Savvy moviegoers actually get excited seeing their rainbow chromatic card in front of movies, despite A24 not being associated with any one filmmaker (like J.J. Abrams with Bad Robot), genre (horror and Blumhouse), or medium (animation studios like Pixar). It’s simply a soft style that threads through the best movies they put out, not quite definable, that’s catnip to open-minded filmgoers and critics alike.\n\nA24 began in 2013 with A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, directed by Roman Coppola. It was decidedly not a box office or critical success, but does present one of A24’s modus operandi: Giving risky movies from established outsider filmmakers a shot in the theatrical space. You’ll see it again with Harmony Korine’s Spring Breakers, Sean Baker’s The Florida Project, Mike Mills’ 20th Century Women, and Sofia Coppola’s The Bling Ring. Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight won Best Picture in 2017, demonstrating A24 has got their finger on the cultural pulse (with credit to the Academy as well, of course).\n\nMeanwhile, leaning into directorial debuts has paid off dividends, in the form of Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird, Alex Garland’s Ex Machina, Robert Eggers’ The Witch, and Ari Aster’s Hereditary. Recently Everything Everywhere All At Once became a pandemic-era sensation and rose up as the company’s highest-grossing domestic movie ever. After that, we saw Marcel the Shell With Shoes On and Bodies, Bodies, Bodies.\n\nAmong their 2024 releases, the Kristen Stewart romantic thriller Love Lies Bleeding, the tea-time conversation starter Civil War, allegorical horror I Saw the TV Glow, the death-becoming Tuesday, and glam ’80s horror MaXXXine.\n\nNow, we’re ranking all A24 movies by Tomatometer!\n\n#1\n\nLady Bird (2017) 99%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 121501%\n\nCritics Consensus: Lady Bird delivers fresh insights about the turmoil of adolescence -- and reveals writer-director Greta Gerwig as a fully formed filmmaking talent.\n\nSynopsis: A teenager (Saoirse Ronan) navigates a loving but turbulent relationship with her strong-willed mother (Laurie Metcalf) over the course of...
