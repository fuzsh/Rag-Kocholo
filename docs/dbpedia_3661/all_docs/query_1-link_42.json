        "text": "I rarely find a movie that has no reviews from friends but even rarer is one that doesn’t have any logs either. This wasn’t a household movie for me but one that I definitely remember watching as a kid with family, probably solely because of the humor and subject matter. My buddy and I almost completely threw out the idea of watching this when we saw the trailer a couple months back, but I’m glad we went through with it today on a whim.\n\nOn it’s surface, the film can probably dismissed as an overly cartoonish comedy, but digging deeper there’s some good heartfelt messages and social commentary. I can’t imagine a movie like this being made nowadays, but I…\n\nYou'll get a good acid test for 2019 when you see Cheech Marin triumphantly leading a wave of illegal immigrants over a hillside and into the United States as Neil Diamond plays in the background. Someone at a major studio would have a stroke if you pitched that to them now. Latino filmmakers of the world, reboot this movie and lay waste to whole provinces of Amalgamated Disney.\n\nIf the soundtrack, neo-slapstick antics and teased hairdos haven't advertised which stop in the timeline you've arrived at, the presence of Daniel Stern certainly will. Firmly fixed in 1987, Born in East L.A. is everything about that era, the bad (Cheech following a woman in a car and commenting on her tits…\n\nWho'd have thought a Cheech Marin comedy from 30 years ago would be \"politically controversial\"?\n\nI've had Mexico on my mind a lot lately. Not only am I in the process of buying a Mexican snake, but I just got an email from my long lost amiga from south of the border. No, none of those reasons are why I watched this flick, I watched it because it's a funny ass movie with a great story.\n\nThis really is one of my favorite comedies from the late 80's, which is rare. In the late 80's, comedy movies went a little soft. Not that they all did, but you started seeing a lot of comedy movies that were a little too…\n\n“Hey Man, whaaas sappeNing?”\n\nFun, silly, 80’s comedy with Cheech Marin as Rudy, being mistaken as an illegal, and getting deported to Mexico. Most of the film deals with Rudy’s struggles to get back to the US and the comical situations that he gets into, trying to sneak back into the US or raise the money to pay the Coyote.\n\nThere’s a few highlights in this film for me. First, it was when Rudy is trying to teach the Chinese Indians, how to talk, act and dress in LA. Second, Paul Rodriguez has some funny scenes as the cousin, in LA, that thinks the portrait of Jesus, is speaking to him. And lastly, how can anyone forget the redhead in…\n\nCheech leading all of the Mexicans across the border is one of the greatest things cinema has ever blessed us with. They should start showing this thing at Trump’s hate rallies. Not with the intention of scaring all the idiots there, which it would, but rather to make all of the rock hard MAGA boners go soft. This would hopefully help with them not being able to reproduce and creating more idiots. Kidding, of course. All of the sibling fucking going on in that world will already do the trick.\n\nAnyways, I didn’t watch this so I could draw comparisons to contemporary issues and make fun of morons. I watched it because Cheech rules and I really thought his directorial…"
