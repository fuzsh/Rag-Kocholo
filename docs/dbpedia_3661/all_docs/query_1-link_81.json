        "text": "For those left unimpressed with Cheech & Chong’s 2008 Denver performance, the comedic duo’s current “Get It Legal” tour, which kicked off at Boulder’s Macky Auditorium on Saturday night, won’t change anybody’s mind. Unpolished and unprepared, Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong did little more than rehash the comedic bits that made them famous 30 years ago — sloppily.\n\nView a full photo gallery of this concert here.\n\nAfter an introductory stand-up routine from Shelby Chong, actress and Tommy Chong’s wife, Cheech & Chong settled from a standing applause to take a handful of written questions from the audience. The queries ranged in concern from the pair’s original breakup to why Cheech no longer has his signature moustache. The responses were a pleasant and relaxed glimpse as to why the two can work so well together: a solid rapport and improvised lines took center stage.\n\nOnce introductions were in order, however, it became apparent why the two might never be replicate, let alone top, their previous comedic success.\n\nThe duo performed one classic after another, starting with a revamped version of the “Dave’s Not Here” bit. Though complete with laughs, the scene ended with Shelby Chong returning to the stage to compare the cop-busting scene to real life. Presumably, it was an opportunity to discuss currently marijuana legalization efforts. However, the commentary was left at that. In fact, the whole evening was nearly devoid of political agendas, a surprise considering the show’s title and Colorado’s current medical marijuana reforms.\n\nThe set continued on with the Christmas classic, “Santa Claus and His Old Lady” and blind bluesman ramblings of “Blind Melon Chitlin’,” arguably the best performances of the evening. With few hitches, these two scenes conveyed strong physical comedic skills and hilarious storylines, the things that made Cheech & Chong work so well on the big screen.\n\nBut what began as an escape back into the likes of “Up in Smoke” morphed into a big downer. Though visually memorable, “Earache My Eye” seemed trite as a lip-synched performance with fake applause in the background. On the guitar, Tommy Chong had difficulty keeping up with the drum beats on songs like “Save the Whales.” Stage presence was lost as the two broke out into the famous “Basketball Jones” song, with Cheech’s lyrics hardly understandable. Mics were initially misplaced for “Born in East L.A.,” and the “Mexican-American” song was completely botched with forgotten lyrics.\n\nAdd all of this to occasional feedback, amplifier issues and an obvious lack of rehearsed prop management, and the audience was left with careless versions of the same material they’ve been listening to since the early ’70s.\n\nBut for the most of the crowd, that was OK. Any reference to weed was vehemently applauded, and mistakes were generally taken as humorous. Most errors on the part of Cheech & Chong were self-admitted on stage as the result of a lifetime of smoking weed — something for which the same cannabis-loving crowd who put them on the comedic map were quick to forgive.\n\nView a full photo gallery of this concert here.\n\nFollow Reverb on Twitter!
