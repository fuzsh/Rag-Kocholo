The film Born In East LA, is quite entertaining but I believe it is great because it actually stars a Mexican-American actor as well one who was born in LA. In one scene we are taken into a warehouse where we see undocumented Mexicans (probably working for little to no money) but doing what they can to survive in this country. Then the “La Migra” comes and takes anyone who is suspected to be an immigrant, anyone who is of darker complexion, and fits what a Mexican “looks” like. Within the movie, there is also white supremacy, with the border patrol, as well as the guy who he starts working for (who becomes his friend) but was only his friend to make money off of him. Not to mention the scenes where Cheech is teaching “Chinese Indians” how to act as Mexicans to fit in more in Mexico, but they are really just stereotypes. It is great for us, because Cheech is a comedian, he breaks it to where we are allowed to laugh within these movies and he is always having such stereotypes in his movies, lets not forget the song Mexican American from Cheech and Chong Next Movie. Yet, this movie is still very relevant, and most people from a Latino descent within the greater LA county can really relate too."
