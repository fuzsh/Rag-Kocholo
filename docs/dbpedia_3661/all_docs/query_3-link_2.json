Most California residents may request a digital vaccination record at myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov.

Earn a QPR certification that will equip you with skills to identify the warning signs, ask the right questions, and refer someone to the right resources for support. For ages 12 and up. Lunch will be provided.\n\nTo sign up for the workshop, click here.\n\n***\n\nIn Spring 2022, RAM will launch the first annual Suicide Prevention Summit, (I AM) L;ving AART (Attitude, Awareness, and Relationship Training). It is a day-long experience designed to excite, engage, and equip the Riverside community to play their role in suicide prevention. This event is produced by Agency 515, led by Khalil. We invite community members, leaders, and organizations to celebrate and affirm life through art and dialogue. In this space, share stories, build skills, and honor the lived and lost experiences of those impacted by suicide and mental health. A complete schedule will be made available prior to the event.\n\nKhalil is an artist, activist, and educator from Southeast San Diego. He is the founder of The SOULcial Workers, a creative development collective supporting youth and communities through social education and emotional development.

Emboldened by the boom in art, fashion, music, and retail culture in 1980s Los Angeles, the iconoclasts of queer Aztlán—as Hernández terms the group of artists who emerged from East LA, Orange County, and other parts of Southern California during this period—developed a new vernacular with which to read the city in bloom. Tracing this important but understudied body of work, Archiving an Epidemic catalogs a queer retelling of the Chicana and Chicano art movement, from its origins in the 1960s, to the AIDS crisis and the destruction it wrought in the 1980s, and onto the remnants and legacies of these artists in the current moment. Hernández offers a vocabulary for this multi-modal avant-garde—one that contests the hetero-masculinity and ocular surveillance visited upon it by the larger Chicanx community, as well as the formally straight conditions of traditional archive-building, museum institutions, and the art world writ large.\n\nWith a focus on works by Mundo Meza (1955–85), Teddy Sandoval (1949–1995), and Joey Terrill (1955– ), and with appearances by Laura Aguilar, David Hockney, Robert Mapplethorpe, and even Eddie Murphy, Archiving an Epidemic composes a complex picture of queer Chicanx avant-gardisms questioning not what Chicanx art is, but what it could have been. The event is co-sponsored by the Riverside Art Museum, the Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art, Culture & Industry of the Riverside Art Museum, and AIDS Health Care Foundation’s Somos LOUD (Latino Outreach and Understanding Division).\n\nNo cost\n\nBring the family to enjoy a warm cup of chocolate mexicano and some arroz con leche while we celebrate our version of the Mexican Festival Las Posadas.

No refunds will be issued.)\n\nTake a seat and maybe bring a notebook; it doesn’t hurt to be prepared while learning from four of the artists featured in Inland Ink as they talk about being working artists, their habits, the quest for art opportunities, and forming partnerships to pursue their creative endeavors.\n\nDenise Kraemer & C. Matthew Luther: Saturday, October 19, 1 p.m.–2 p.m.\n\nDenise Kraemer\n\nDenise Kraemer of Riverside is a native of the Inland Empire. She served as the Education Curator at the Riverside Art Museum for three years where she organized the adult education programs, monthly lecture series, and member critiques.

Musso’s childhood was filled with exploring the forests, rivers, and mountains of the Northern Sierra Nevada. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and Master of Fine Arts degree in Graphic Design and Printmaking respectively at California State University, Long Beach.\n\nWhile Musso enjoys living in the urban environment of Southern California, he finds it important to run to the hills for extended periods of time. In the wilderness, he hikes (~4,000 miles to date), sketches, photographs, and creates rubbings of natural objects. This extensive documentation of the natural world then becomes the reference material for his intricately detailed prints and drawings.\n\nMusso exhibits his work internationally with works in both museums and private collections.\n\nPável Acevedo, Oaxaca, Mx (1984)\n\nMy formal art studies began at the Rufino Tamayo Plastic Arts Workshop in Oaxaca City while I was an assistant and student of the Lithography studio.

I was also an assistant in the print studios of artist Demian Flores (Taller Grafica Actual) and Alejandro Santiago (Taller la Huella).\n\nIn 2010, I moved to Riverside, California, and started getting involved in printmaking projects with a social justice and educational awareness component in communities of color throughout California. In 2015, I opened my printmaking studio by collaborating with “The Desert Triangle Print Carpeta” located provisionally in Riverside. In the last few years, I was commissioned by the Wignall Contemporary Art Museum for a permanent mural, as well as by La Sierra University for a mural for their Art Department, and the City of Riverside for a mural located in Downtown.\n\nI’ve being traveling, giving printmaking workshops around the U.S. in Albuquerque with New Grounds/Remarque Print Shop, as printmaker-in-residence with Horned Toad Printshop guided by Manuel Guerra and KALA Art Institute in Berkeley, California, and, recently, I was included to be a professional artist by Speedball.\n\nMy artwork has been exhibited in different group shows between Mexico and the U.S. in public and private institutions, as well as individually at: Rufino Tamayo Worskhop (Mx); Casa de la Ciudad Oaxaca (Mx); Museo de Los Pintores Oaxaquenos (Mx); Arte Cocodrilo (Mx); Plan B (Mx); Riverside Art Museum (U.S.); Mission Cultural Center (San Francisco, CA); Museum of Art El Paso (U.S.); The Mexic-Arte Museum (U.S.); Comalito Collective (U.S.); and College of the Canyons (U.S.).\n\nPlease join us and the artists for the Opening Reception of Inland Ink and Lost in the Andes on Thursday, October 3, 6 p.m.–8 p.m.\n\nPlease join us and the artist, Michael Skura, for the Opening Reception of Tendrils on Thursday, November 21, 6 p.m.–8 p.m.\n\nThe Art Alliance invites the general public to join them on the third Thursday of the month at 6:30 p.m. for the following programs:\n\nSeptember 19: Susan Straight and Douglas McCulloh, will discuss their collaboration on Badass Women and the Road to the Promised Land.

Please consider coming to the Opening Reception at 5:30 p.m., if you did not already RSVP for the Book Launch.\n\nAuthor Susan Straight’s memoir, In the Country of Women, is the inspiration behind our Badass Women and the Road to the Promised Land exhibition. Please join us for the book launch, which will include a talk and book signing, before the opening reception for Badass Women. Books will be available for purchase.\n\nIn Inland Southern California, near the desert and the Mexican border, Susan Straight, a self-proclaimed book nerd, and Dwayne Sims, an African American basketball player, started dating in high school. After college, they married and drove to Amherst, Massachusetts, where Straight met her teacher and mentor, James Baldwin, who encouraged her to write. Once back in Riverside, at driveway barbecues and fish fries with the large, close-knit Sims family, Straight—and eventually her three daughters—heard for decades the stories of Dwayne’s female ancestors. Some women escaped violence in post-slavery Tennessee, some escaped murder in Jim Crow Mississippi, and some fled abusive men. Straight’s mother-in-law, Alberta Sims, is the descendant at the heart of this memoir. Susan’s family, too, reflects the hardship and resilience of women pushing onward—from Switzerland, Canada, and the Colorado Rockies to California.\n\nA Pakistani word, biraderi, is one Straight uses to define a complex system of kinship and clan—those who become your family. An entire community helped raise her daughters. Of her three girls, now grown and working in museums and the entertainment industry, Straight writes, “The daughters of our ancestors carry in their blood at least three continents. We are not about borders. We are about love and survival.” In the Country of Women is a valuable social history and a personal narrative that reads like a love song to America and indomitable women.\n\nThis event is generously sponsored by:\n\nSuzy & Gary Clem\n\nCati & Lloyd Porter\n\nHosted by Barrio Sounds & Mr. Blue from Radio Aztlan | A Cultura Con Llantas Committee Event\n\nThe first Vinyl & Rides was a hit, so we’re bringing it back!

This is going to be FUN!\n\nThis event is free and open to the public, but please RSVP! And keep it ‘secret’! 😉\n\nAbout Secret Inland Empire: A Guide to the Weird, Wonderful, and Obscure, published by Reedy Press\n\nAs the name implies, the Inland Empire is an ambitious collection of communities. The “I got this” ethos is alive and well here. It’s a confidence that comes from living in a place that is wide open like the fabled American frontier. The two counties that comprise the Inland Empire (IE), Riverside and San Bernardino, make it California’s largest metropolitan area. Its population and popularity grow year after year. The biggest secret about the Inland Empire is the number of ways that they lead the state, nation, and world in innovative practices, ideas, and commerce. Home of the first McDonald’s, it perfected the taste that took over the globe. Sampled a Flaming Hot Cheeto lately? Invented here by an hourly employee. This region’s citrus symbolized health and prosperity in the 20th century. Today, 90% of our dates come from the IE’s eastern deserts. Innovative? This is where Dr. June McCarroll redesigned highways by adding the white line—the first mile by her own hand. It’s home to the world’s first Tesla-inspired 3-phase A/C generator power plant, a method employed in 90% of the world today. The largest animatronics studio, Garner Holt Industries, Inc., is not in Hollywood, it’s in the IE. This is where NASA placed the world’s first Deep Space Communications Complex at Goldstone. Every single message from Mars, every probe photograph, comes here first. The purpose of this book is to share the wildest, wackiest, and most wonderful places and people that make up this diverse and storied community.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLarry Burns draws inspiration and ideas from the heady mixture of sights, sounds, peoples, and places of his hometown, Riverside, CA. He is an active community leader, booster, and all-around fan of the recreation, entertainment, arts, and culture ready to be discovered across the Inland Empire. He is a founding member of the Inlandia Institute, a non-profit literary organization. He teaches English at Riverside City College and Humanities at Southern New Hampshire University.\n\nThe City of Riverside in partnership with Riverside Downtown Partnership and the Mission Inn Museum and Foundation are hosting the City’s third annual Doors Open event.

But when judges slammed the courtroom door on the public, including the press, it became impossible to tell the whole story. Pinning its hopes on business lawyer Jim Ward, whom Press-Enterprise editor Tim Hays had come to know and trust, the newspaper took two cases to the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1980s. Hays was convinced that the public—including the press—needed to have these rights and needed to bear witness to justice because healing in the aftermath of a horrible crime could not occur without community catharsis.\n\nThe newspaper won both cases and established First Amendment rights that significantly broadened public access to the judicial system, including the right for the public to witness jury selection and preliminary hearings.\n\nJustice in Plain Sight is a unique story that, for the first time, details two improbable journeys to the Supreme Court in which the stakes were as high as they could possibly be (and still are): the public’s trust in its own government.\n\nThis event is free and open to the public. However, seating is limited. Please RSVP so we can have an accurate head count. Thank you!\n\nThe event begins at 5:30 p.m. Books will be available for purchase. The talk will begin at 6 p.m.\n\nGallery Tour: 12:30 p.m., Panel Discussion: 1:30 p.m., Free\n\nRobbert Flick, Ken Marchionno, Susan Straight, and Kim Stringfellow share their inland discoveries and how their finds inspired their work in In the Sunshine of Neglect.\n\nThis project was made possible with support from California Humanities,\n\na non-profit partner of the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nVisit www.calhum.org.\n\nPlease welcome artists from our winter exhibitions, Mama’s Boys (and Other Stories) and Beast as they talk about their respective exhibitions.\n\n$120/person, $100/RAM member, Evening Wear and Masks Requested\n\nJoin us for an evening of intrigue at the museum where you’ll be delighted by sumptuous hors d’oeuvres and an array of cocktails at our hosted bar, enthralled by the mystic performances of master mask maker Rob Faust, treated to a sneak peek of the fantastical Beast exhibition, and much more!\n\nIt’s a masquerade, so don’t forget to dress up! #BeastMasquerade\n\nOnline ticket sales have ended.

Tierra’s invigorating blend of R&B, Latin, and Pop, is the precursor to many Hispanic artists. They performed at such prestigious venues as Carnegie Hall, The Greek Theater, Dodger Stadium, The Rosebowl, Red Rocks, Houston Astrodome, as well as such television shows as The American Music Awards, American Bandstand, Soul Train, Solid Gold, and many others.\n\nTheir 1981 mega hit “Together” catapulted them to the top of the national and international charts. And the band, under the leadership of Rudy Salas has been going strong for almost 45 years and have performed on stage with such superstars as James Brown, Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, War, as well as many other top performers of the music business.\n\nTierra has been widely known for opening doors for other Latino artists, such as Los Lobos, Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine, Sheila E., Paul Rodriguez, etc.\n\nRudy started Tierra in 1972 and brought in his brother Steve on vocals. At the time, Tierra was more rock oriented and released two albums. They received critical acclaim, but they failed to impress the commercial markets around the country. They refined their R&B and Latin influences on the nightclub circuit for about six years.\n\nIn 1981, Tierra decided to quit the club circuit and honed their skills in the recording studio again.\n\n“City Nights” was the result and Rudy tried to shop it to every record company around L.A. He was turned down by all of them. Rudy decided to put the album out independently. He worked out deals here and there, and the local radio stations started playing “Together” the single. Before you know it, the song got on the national charts, even without a record company. All of a sudden, the very same record companies that turned it down were bidding for the record.\n\nIt finally caught the ear of Neil Bogart of Boardwalk Records. He signed the band, and as they say, “The rest is history”.\n\nSubsequently, Tierra had many other hits such as “Gonna Find Her”, “Memories”, “La La Means I Love You”, “Are We In Love”, “Zoot Suit Boogie”, “Lady In the Moonlight”, “Latin Legends Live”, etc.\n\nIn 1992, Tierra was asked by James Brown to back him up for his appearance on the Hollywood “Walk Of Fame” and toured with him, as well as with the Commodores, Kool and The Gang, The Gap Band, etc.\n\nSince then, Tierra has performed all over the U.S. and many parts of the world.\n\nWith over 25 CDs under their belts, and their songs being featured on several compilation CDs, the band is as strong as ever, with leader-guitarist-singer-producer Rudy Salas holding down the foundation, along with a super tight rhythm section lead by Chris Trujillo on drums (formerly with Toto and Tom Petty), Tony Banda (original bassman for the legendary Poncho Sanchez), Joey Navarro, keyboard wizard, and Dale Villavicencio on percussion (Sheila E., Azteca). Leading the horn section is Tierra veteran Rudy “Bub” Villa on alto sax, as well as Victor Cisneros on soprano sax, and Jeff Lewis on trumpet (formerly with the Jackson Five). Handling the vocals is the dynamic Will “Rize” Rivera.\n\nTierra is now in the studio working on their next CD. With a line up of veteran musicians like this, it promises to be one of their best ever.\n\n***\n\nAdditionally, the Mariachi Divas will perform during dinner and DJ Anthony Guaracha will spin during the VIP reception.\n\nHere’s a little bit more about Guaracha: Anthony Guaracha, DJ TJ Pops, began DJ-ing in the mid-1990s. He has volunteered at the University of California, Riverside, radio station, KUCR, since he was an undergraduate student in 2001, int"
