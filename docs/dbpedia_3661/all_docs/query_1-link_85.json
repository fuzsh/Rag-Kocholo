        "text": "Being a cholo (a street tough) where and when I grew up helped keep you from being victimized.\n\nIn the 1950s they were called pachucos. In the ’60s they were called low-riders because they sat low behind the wheel of a car. Today they’re considered gangsters.\n\nA couple of years ago I went to the de Young Museum in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park to see a show of Chicano art collected by Cheech Marin. He’s the guy from the Cheech and Chong comedy act.\n\nThe artwork knocked me out. Cheech published a book called “Chicano Vision (American Painters on the Verge).” I liked the book so much that I bought the hard-cover edition that is done with high-quality artwork.\n\nA friend named Santo, who lived across the street from me in City Terrace (a part of East L.A.), told me that Cheech sometimes hung out in City Terrace. Cheech mentions City Terrace in his song and his movie “Born in East L.A.” Santo is friends with a guy who lived on the next block named Willie Herron.\n\nCheech mentions Herron in the introduction of the book, saying that Herron’s brother was stabbed to death in a back alley in City Terrace.\n\nHerron painted a mural of muscular arms bursting through a wall at the spot where his brother was killed. He calls it “The Wall That Cracked Open.”\n\nThe mural became a tour de force of Chicano art by depicting familiar Chicano imagery — the praying madre (mother) with her crucifix, a calavera (skull) symbolizing death, conjoined with a Mexican wrestler’s mask — at the emotionally infused site.\n\nTo this day the mural is a testament to the social, economic, political and psychic violence prevalent in East L.A. and it was born that day in that back alley in the poor barrio (neighborhood) of City Terrace.\n\nI know the mural very well because it is 20 feet out the door in the alley of the house I grew up in.\n\nIf you type in “Willie Herron murals” on Google, you’ll see the mural as well as many other murals Herron has painted.\n\nWhen I was 15 years old I had a girlfriend named Winona, who was also 15 years old. She had a 16-year-old brother named Ricardo who was in a street gang called El Hoyo Maravilla.\n\nEl Hoyo Maravilla and a neighboring gang in East L.A. had been fighting over territory for years. One night Ricardo went to visit his girlfriend outside of El Hoyo Maravilla’s territory and was caught by the other gang. He was stabbed to death and hung over a chain link fence in City Terrace.\n\nWinona found out who killed Ricardo and she was on the run because the guys who killed Ricardo wanted to keep her quiet. She sometimes stayed with me and with other friends waiting to testify in court against the guys who killed her brother.\n\nAfter I hadn’t seen Winona for three days, two policemen came to my house and asked me when I’d last seen Winona. I told them it had been three days and I asked them what happened. They told me Winona had been raped and murdered.\n\nI couldn’t believe it at first. Winona was too street smart and tough to be killed like that. But when I saw her picture on the front pages of L.A.’s newspapers, it very slowly began to sink in.\n\nWhat’s all that got to do with being a cholo?\n\nIf some of my friends weren’t cholos when we grew up in City Terrace, they might not be here now because cholos usually had friends to back them up.\n\nTo this day I still have friends who grew up in City Terrace who I love and who love me.\n\nThey might not look like cholos as much on the outside anymore but they probably still are cholos a little bit on the inside.\n\nAnd no, the police never caught the guys who killed Ricardo and Winona but El Hoyo Maravilla did."
