        "text": "Pages : 1 [2] 3\n\ncwphish\n\nHeres an old school band from the northeast.....Percy Hill\n\nBusted some old tapes out of the archives this week. God I miss these guys.\n\nI believe Joe Satriani tutored Kirk Hammett of Metallica... I can really hear some 'Joe' on Met's first album...that shimmering type of sound!\n\nLong live Stevie Ray Vaughan!! :cool:\n\nI never miss Indigenous or Gov't Mule when they hit my area! NEVER!!\n\nI'm pretty sure that Satriani was working with Steve Vai before Zappa stole Vai from him. Zappa needed Steve because Frank couldn't play some of the guitar parts he was writing.\n\nI got to see video of Zappa and Vai having a guitar battle on stage and I believe it was an experience that will go with me beyond the grave. If anyone knows where to find that footage please let me know. I would be willing to pay quite a bit for it.\n\nDoes Indigenous have a web site? I haven't heard them and I would like to check it out.\n\nriverdog\n\nYup to the website for Indigenous. Pretty sure it's www.indigenousrocks.com (http://www.indigenousrocks.com) but if not Google should get you there. And I'll be willing to bet you there is a copy of the Zappa/Vai dueling guitars out there somewhere. A friend recently gifted me with a video copy of Hendrix on stage at night at the second annual Atlanta Pop Festival in Byron, Georgia and they don't come much more obscure than that.\n\nJ_TEE\n\nG3 tour on DVD, go buy it.....\n\nSatch,Vai and Eric\n\nIt rules..\n\nslo\n\nThanks so much for these tips...I've started checking them out at the...er, *cough* library, and I've been quite pleasantly surprised!\n\nF'rinstance, Walter Trout has worked with BluesGod John Mayall...just like Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Coco Montoya, and Mick Taylor...very select company.\n\n...Eric Sardinas doesn't just play like Johhny Winters, he sings like him, too...full of enthusiasm!\n\n...as for Joe Satriani...wow! I've been able to check out but one track so far [Hands in the Air][possibly an album title], but...well, WOW!! The total package!\n\n...if I can be a bit of a hiney, y'all, please list album/song preferences with your suggestions...that helps distill the search/find process.\n\nAgain, much thanks to ALL my musicloving brothers/sisters! :D\n\nslo\n\n...as for Joe Satriani...wow! I've been able to check out but one track so far [Hands in the Air][possibly an album title]...\n\nNope. My librarian informs me this track is from an album titled: Is There Love in Space?\n\nfrizgolf\n\nSatriani! Got Flying in a Blue Dream (Back to Shalla-Bal always breaks me out in a sweat) and Surfing With the Alien. Didn't he teach Eddie Van Halen some licks?\n\nriverdog\n\nSatriani - 2nd your Surfing with the Alien\n\nIndigenous - Live at Pachyderm\n\nGov't Mule - The Deep End Vol. I (a few licks on this one by Derek Trucks that will introduce you to Duane Allman if he was channelled from guitar heaven)\n\nSardinas - Treat me Right\n\nWalter Trout - Tellin' Stories\n\nEddie Hinton - Very Extremely Dangerous\n\nand if you haven't discovered\n\nRobert Randolph and the Family Band you are in for yet another treat. Pedal steel guitar beyond my ability to describe. \"Live at the Wetlands\" is probably a good intro but it's all good. :cool:\n\nslo\n\n...duly noted, and copied for reference. :cool:\n\nï¿½trying to think of some gems to share which might be off the radarï¿½\n\nAMON Dï¿½ï¿½L is the name of a Deutche band/commune which began making raw psychedelic/trance/rock music in the late sixtiesï¿½but fans of the ï¿½garage bandï¿½ sound might dig them, too. :p Psychedelic Underground is the one I favor. Here's a professional review: Psychedelic Underground (http://www.windowsmedia.com/mediaguide/albuminfo/?providerName=AMG&albumID=C4F0CC9C-88FB-44D0-BEE4-500D13653FED&a_id=R++++29033&album=Psychedelic+Underground&artistID=268FC37D-5917-436A-B8C9-6787782D9167&p_id=P++++15404&artist=Amon+Dï¿½ï¿½l&version=9.0.0.3128) ;)\n\nIf you ï¿½getï¿½ the Shaggs*, you will probably love this, possibly even more than Philosophy of the World....less 'lyrics' to get in the way...OK, OK, make that 'words'.!\n\n*But that's another story! :D\n\nbeat, you have a PM.\n\nBlarg\n\nWanna talk old school? I just got tickets to see Jerry Lee Lewis in Vegas on Oct. 30th. 'The Killer.' Everything everybody who is reading this is listening to came from somewhere near what he was doing. I won't say he invented rock and roll, because he's white, but he was definitely riding the first wave.\n\nJohn Lennon said it best. \"'Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,' was the only rock and roll song ever recorded, the rest of us are doing something else.\" :)\n\nslo\n\nTHAT Jerry's still not dead?!? :o\n\nHow's this for Greybeardom: The endpiece of the 'New Wave' era, London Calling, is being released in it's Silver Anniversary Edition. :eek:\n\nTrying to decide who invented R&R is akin to determining where a face stops, and where 'mere head' begins.\n\nWas it just R&B popularized by whites? I think not; there's a HUGE leap from Louis Jordan to Bo Diddley. It had to do with the beat...Hooker, and of course Mr. Charles Beryl [sic] made invaluable contributions, too.\n\ncwphish\n\nI'll give you some props on mr. Lewis, but check this out........ I saw Buddy Guy and Luther Guitar Junior Johnson together. Makes you wonder if rock and blues was their baby.\n\n...I've also got a 3-disc set called \"Object Project\" of Zappa music by [this is a guess] Mother alumni, but can't find it in the 'guide'. :confused:\n\nThat probably should be \"Project Object\"..... as a few ex-FZ players (Ike Willis, Napoleon Murphy Brock & Don Preston) have been touring around small venues the last few years playing the music of efF Zee. I was fortunate enough to see them twice and if you're a fan of Zappa, you definitely should check them out. They're getting ready to tour again in October, so catch them if they come your way.\n\nJust crank Frank!\n\nfrizgolf\n\nOK, greybeards, I know I've mentioned it before somewhere in this thread, but y'all should check out this station online http://www.wofx.com/main.html on Sundays 6:00 -9:30 PM. (EDT) Tonight they're featuring the Ramones (working up a sweat here), and it's all but guaranteed you'll hear at least one Zappa tune. They play all the old underground stuff that was on FM in the late 60s &amp; early 70s. Some cool music, and they'll throw in some vintage National Lampoon, Second City, Monty Python, and Cheech &amp; Chong cuts once in a while. Cool stuff.\n\nNot sure if this was 2nd City or Nat'l Lampoon, but I'm doing this from memory. (I hear it about every second week.)\n\nIt starts out with a voice that sounds to me to be Garret (sp?) Morris:\n\nI'm mizable, right? Well, I got a right to be.\n\nI woke up this mornin', my alarm clock didn't go off.\n\nI went in to shave, I cut myself.\n\nI'm mizable, right?\n\nI went in to work, my boss said \"this is the fourth time this week you been late. You're fired.\"\n\nI said \"wha' fo'?\" He said \"you're fired.\"\n\nI'm mizable, right?\n\nI went down to see my girl, she found out I didn't have no job, she didn't want nothin' to do with me.\n\nI'm mizable, right?\n\nI'm walkin' down the street, I see a sign in the window that said \"you're mizable, right?\" I said \"right!\" It said \"try a bottle of these new Life pills.\"\n\nSo I bought a bottle.\n\nMaybe I'll try one o' these Life pills. *Pop*\n\nI'm still mizable, right?\n\nMaybe I'll try two more. *Pop* *Pop*\n\nI'm still mizable, right? But... I'm not as mizable as I was a few moments ago. Matter of fact, I'm feelin' a little bit better right about now. Matter of fact, I'm feelin' kinda groovy. Matter of fact, uh, matter of fact, I'm high on Life!\n\n(Announcer voice over)\n\nLife! The little pill for when you're feelin' mizable, right? Get high on lifelifelifelifelife... (fades)\n\nI had this memorized when I was about 15. Now I hear it 30+ years later, and I can still recite it at a moment's notice. I couldn't tell you the names of half the states' capitols, though. Shows you what kind of mush we store in our brains.\n\nslo\n\nhttp://www.wofx.com/main.html\n\nI got back from the SoCal champs a bit late for tonight, but duly noted and copied...literally; I've got a text file for all the hot tips here...Greybeardian, or not.\n\non 9/19 slo wrote:\n\n...one not on your list, worth a listen: [the] Black Keys. Hendrixesque.\n\nOK, perhaps not so much like Jimi in the sound, per se, but the attitude...these two guys [guitar, drums] really crank it!! It's Blues inspired as opposed to pure Blues...it's the kind of ROCK where you not only want to play it louder, but, the louder-the-better! :p\n\nThanks for the website Riverdog.\n\nI know this isn't greybeard music, but I like to call it 21st century blues, so if your interested check out www.thisisq.com (http://www.thisisq.com)\n\nQ is a great band and they're even better live.\n\nriverdog\n\nAnd thanks back at ya Pruner. Interesting vocalist for Q. Never have pinned myself into any musical corner and generally gravitate toward guitar driven rock and roll. Otherwise dissonant driving beats of any sort - P.J. Harvey, Patty Smith (old and new), Evanescence.........all strike a spark for me too. On the other hand Emmy Lou Harris, Tori Amos, Susan Tedeschi and Lucinda Williams make life more livable too.\n\nriverdog\n\nLMAO. Got me to thinking about old 2nd City and Fireside Theater. Fireside did a bit on \"Blue Chinchilla's\" in the late 60's when all the TV stations ran ads for growing chinchillas in your garage for huge profits. Most of these ads ran late at night and were laughable even presented straight but let Fireside Theater get hold of them and the wonderful strain of Blue Chinchilla became a magical fur bearing critter that was also fireproof, making him that much more valuable and marketable. While the pitchman was making these comments in the foreground of the soundtrack you could hear the crew putting out cigarettes on the sizzling, and squealling to high heaven, chinchillas in the background. :eek: ;) :DStill cracks me up just thinking about it.\n\nslo\n\nRe: Second City: \"Celebrity Blow-Up\" is something indelibly etched on my mind...\"He blowed up REEL good!\" :o:D :eek: :p :D\n\nI met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game\n\nTo stimulate, then activate the left and right brain\n\nShe said baby boy your only funky as your last cut\n\nYou focus on the past your [*****]'ll be a has what\n\nslo\n\nRight right; I must be dightly slyslexic...still can't find the 3-disc Project Object listed [just Project/Object; different songs]; it's 8, 10, and 6 tracks. Still getting through those .\n\n[i]Anyways...this is foremost a story about quests...ever have a musical quest?\n\nFor instance, I had heard OF The Wild Tchoupitoulas in the 70's, and had borrowed the LP from the analogue library in the 90's, but it took nearly a decade after that to snab the digital [or any] version. Likewise, it took my friend Dave [the self-avowed obsessive collector] many, many years to find something by the original Charlatans, the San Fran Psych band which started the scene up there [not that it started there, but I've covered that].\n\nWould you believe a quest taking 25 years before it came to fruition?!?\n\nIn 1979, I got my hands on a copy of: The Rolling Stone Record Guide, which I've come to view as a tad apocryphal [esp. any opinions of Dave Marsh, the book's editor], but as a 20-year-old, I found it quite influential...esp. seeing as it was 'bout the only thing of its kind available [and remember, this is before the internet became popular]. The book was based on the five-star system, and had an index in the back of non-Jazz, non-Blues five-star albums, as well as pictures of some of these R&R classics throughout the book.\n\nOne of these elite RECORDS was an album by The Move, which eventually morphed into the much more popular Electric Light Orchestra [ELO].\n\nWell, I liked ELO; more importantly, I loved Cheap Trick [my first Rock concert, w/KISS, in 1977]; \"California Man\" was a Move song; the CT version also had the riff from The Move's \"Brontosaurus\" spliced in, to boot. The Move's main influence was listed as early [pre-Tommy] Who :p, but more importantly [this was discovered much later], they were deigned most influential to the Mod sceneï¿½perhaps even more than the Small Faces :oï¿½wow! Roy Wood formed the group; Jeff Lynne eventually became the 'lead' guy.\n\nIntriguing! Ok, I'll fer shure keep a look out for it. ;)\n\n...many years passed; scores of used record shops visited; others enlisted in the quest. Many years later, even searches through the digital library were fruitless.\n\n...two months ago, Dave finally found a Move CD over the internet, and ordered a copy...the company turned out to be bogus! :confused:\n\nFINALLY I started getting some 'hits' through the *cough*hack* library service I support.... [i]just last night, after a quarter-century of questage!!! :D :D :D\n\n...there's more to the story, including a Blarg corollary [!], but I like to spellcheck and format, and have some other stuff to get through tonight...to be continued.\n\np.s. IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT...r-r-r-r-RAD!!! :D\n\nslo\n\n2/03/01 Galactic with Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade and Lake Trout, The Newport Music Hall, Columbus:\n\n!!!\n\nFree griplock lesson to the first person who guesses my favorite band...\n\nslo\n\nSpinal Tap?\n\nfrizgolf\n\nI have XM at work, and there's a co-worker who begs for Slayer every 5 minutes. I only ever hear 'em on Liquid Metal, channel 42. Dude says their new stuff ain't as fast as their old stuff. I don't know, it sounded good to me.\n\nWOW I haven't heard of them in 30 years.Dude, check this out.In the 60's my mother worked in salsolito? Calif across the golden gate from san fran.My brother worked at the avalon ballroom,While patching for the H A's oakland chapter.My mom worked at ollys bakery (long O ).My point is that every week the Fillmore and the Avalon would print posters,and put them in all the stores.The charlatans had a three part poster made.They were printed in old fashion brown photo style.Man I bet there worth a mint.Speaking of posters,I was at a poker game the other week and my friends wife had three avalon ballroom posters from that era.I almost started to cry dude,because i had allmost every poster they ( the avalon) and the fillmore printed in 68 69.And when we moved from nor cal to so cal my dad threw them away.Anyway,She (freinds wife)Had one of the charlatans posters and I told her that they had made a series of three that joined together to make one big poster.Wow!! I just took a ride in the way back machine.Thank you!! Other groups from that era,moby grape,Airplane(of course) ottis redding was big then.\"Brain lock\"anyway It was a trip just talking about it.Guess where I'm going now?. Fillmore and avalon . com.One more thing.When I went to the fillmore and avalon they would project images on the walls, ceiling with an over head projecter a mixture of oil and water and food coloring.dude.In my mind I'm there right now.Thanks for the trip........ :D\n\nslo\n\nThanks Bro John; sorry about those posters; I guess my tears are a bit happier...there's some trippy art on that memory lane...morphing print, mirror-image universes, etc...thanks for that word about the triptych...going to have a new quest, yeah! http://www.pdga.com/discus/clipart/proud.gif\n\nOther groups from that era, moby grape, Airplane(of course) ottis redding was big then...When I went to the fillmore and avalon they would project images on the walls, ceiling with an over head projecter a mixture of oil and water and food coloring.\n\nIn the newish video, ï¿½ Fly [Jefferson Airplane] they show just how this is done; in shallow vessels; think: \"squish\". Anyways, Fly is a lead-pipe-cinch Five Star <font color=\"red\"> ***** </font> choice for fellow freaks! Smothers Brothers, Grace in Blackface, !E!T!C!. In case the choir misplaced their hymnal, contacts= Producer: Bob Sarles; Eagle Rock Productions. Grok?\n\nHow about Thirty-Two Years for this one: One of my all-time favs is the Welsh band Badfinger; not having ever seen ï¿½ Concert For Bangladesh, I've seen NO video footage of the chaps whom I've come to think of as: \"The Beatles, Continued\". Well, there IS a collection out there, it includes a track of them performing as The Iveys [all Badfinger records were out-of-print when the above mentioned RS guide was released, and neither even had an entry][so I never even knew it was the Iveys who signed to newly-formed Apple records, in 1968].\n\n32= The time from \"Day After Day\" waving the air, to-present-day epiphany.\n\nBack to the Move, pt.2. Well, things are turning out most happily; Dave got a call from the music merchant he frequents; they are holding a 3-disc set of ALL the Move tracks, save the live EP which they recorded...and Dave already had that...which I had failed to recall, oh well...so it's classic: the best of all possible outcomes. It was mostly the collection of #1's [yes, #1, as in: Top-o'-the-Pops, nothing higher, the best-of-the-best #1's] hits which never tracked on this side of the pond being the temptation for Dave.\n\n...after waiting 25 years, for my earbones to hear some Move, what did I hear first? I played \"California Man\" because of the CT corollary...and it sounded... exactly...as if in a tribute-kinda-way...like the Killah, Jerry Lee...no lie! It sounded great, but it was such a surprise to hear what had been described as a group being seminal in of-so-many-ways 'doing' such a birth-of-the-art sound.\n\n...soon: a view of Gram Fest 2004. Harvest Moon. \"The Monument\". Can you say, Byrds, Burritos, and Emmylou?\n\n...quote from Gram Fest 2003: \"Had Gram lived? Had he lived, Garth Brooks 'never would have happened'.\"\n\nPeace, love, and understanding this \"Country Music-Rock\" tilt to the universe...a tad better.\n\nslo\n\nFrom Frizgolf:\n\n...y'all should check out this station online http://www.wofx.com/main.html on Sundays 6:00 -9:30 PM. (EDT)\n\nOK, set your Time Machines! ;)\n\nrightcunnin\n\nAvail, The Cure, Interpol, Theivery Corporation, Amon Tobin, King Crimson, Shuggie Otis, The Cramps, The Exploited, GBH, Peter Tosh,Israel Vibration, Jimmy Dale Gilmore, The Smiths, WNOC, Throwing Muses, Xymox, Dead Can Dance, Front 242, Ministry, Lard, Dead Kennedys, The Fall, X, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Eric Dolphy, Talking Heads, Adrian Belew, The Ramones, Spooky Toooth, Sparklehorse, The Frames, Chameleons UK and many many many more.\n\nslo\n\nMy latest spate:\n\nGram Parsons: ï¿½ GP; ï¿½ Grievous Angel\n\nFlying Brrito Brothers: ï¿½ The Gilded Palace of Sin; ï¿½ Last of the Red Hot Burritos [live; Hillman was only original Bro. left by this point].\n\nEmmylou Harris: ï¿½ Luxury Liner\n\nPublic Image, Limited [P.I.L.]: ï¿½ Metal Box [via original vinyl].\n\nJerry Garcia: ï¿½ Gracia; ï¿½ Reflections [extended versions]\n\nï¿½ Sin*City Social Club Volume 3 [sampler]\n\noh yeah: ï¿½ Smiley Smile/Wild Honey by the Beach Boys [two distinct albums on one disc].\n\nslo\n\nQuite digging on John Mayall's 1969, post-Mick Taylor effort ï¿½ The Turning Point.\n\nNo drums, or electric guitar leads.\n\nRecorded live, at that other Fillmore.\n\nAt times, the sax/flute embellishing could qualify it as Jazz; each song is nevertheless a perfectly executed segment of Blues 'vibe'. They tend to stretch-out; 47 minutes [46 minutes, less chatter] of music over but 7 tracks.\n\n...you'd instantly recognize \"Room to Move\", if not place the artist/title. Well, anybody capable of remembering/admitting to listening to the radio of 30-35 years past could...\"Room to Move\" is likely as close as Mayall ever came to significant airplay for his music...it's the one with a catchy, Harp*/Flute lead, and the astonishing, hard-to-believe-that's-possible vocal scat near the song's end. And, let me tell you young whippersnappers something only a Greybeard could: 4:59 was one HECK of a long song for radio play in the early 70ï¿½s; a live single was just as unheard of.\n\nThe earlier, nigh-legendary, more-easily-recognizable [read: archetypical British Hard] Blues of ï¿½ Bluesbreakers [with Eric Clapton] and ï¿½ A Hard Road [with Peter Green][yes, THE Peter Green!][*sigh* just the founder of Fleetwood Mac] are generally rated higher; I say The Turning Point is just as indispensable to Blues lovers. Just as pure, too.\n\nIndispensable, meaning not just 5-star in quality, but having 'weight'; having historical significance. A 'must-have' for understanding/appreciating that particular idiom. All of the 3 above listed albums qualify, and are worthy of seekage, but 'any' is a great start too, if those titles are new-to-you.\n\n* aka \"French Harp\". Also called a \"harmonica\" in music stores, which aren't likely to have a REAL harmonica on hand...those instruments were invented by B. Franklin, Phil., PA, about 1/4 millennia ago, and would never carry effortlessly in ones pocket...\n\nslo\n\nIf you've ever seen the cable show South Park you've heard at least one Primus 'song'. What I'm currently trying to decipher are the boundries/ties between Primus, Oysterhead, and Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade.\n\nOne thing for sure, Claypool is a monster on bass, not just his \"x's & o's\", but his whole attitude/attack. It's just too bad that as a singer, he mades Brian Eno sound good by comparison!\n\nriverdog\n\nShifting gears Slo - Mississippi Hil Country Blues live - North Mississippi Allstars at this summers Bonaroo festival in Tennessee. Absolutely killer!! The Dickinson brothers father, veteran bluesman and producer Jim Dickinson and R.L. Burnside are both in the house for this one. Give it a listen.\n\nslo\n\nSure...anything \"roots\" and I'm there...what would be the search 'keyword[s]'? [I'm guessing it's not \"Hil\".] :D\n\nriverdog\n\nNice pick up Slo. It was a test. You almost passed. Had you caught the misspelled Bonnaroo I could have given full credit. ;)\n\nSearch North Mississippi Allstars. This particular disc is \"Hill Country Revue - Live at Bonnaroo\". Bonnaroo has been a tremendous roots type festival. The original promoters just sold their interests to ClearChannel so the \"free flowing spirit\" engendered by the \"relaxed\" atmosphere may be a thing of the past. We'll see what next year brings.\n\nnix\n\nHey Tom do you know the name of the Primus album that is all cover songs? I could try and find it myself, but thought why bother when I could just ask Tom???\n\n:p\n\nslo\n\nI don't read Rolling Stone :mad:, or I might have heard of Bonnaroo...serendipity, coincidence, or what, I just last night found out about it, whilst referencing something else...judging by the participants, that was quite the fest!\n\n...it was in 2002, from what I understand...'just sold' meaning 2004? Oh yeah, thanks for the word-up!! ;)\n\nslo\n\nI'm going to get to that Riverdog, but I want to share this right away:\n\nI don't have the actual figures, but I'm guessing it's impossible to keep up with all the music which is released, if only due to a lack of time...therefore, you could have a 'thing' for music 40+ years, like myself, and still have gaps in your knowledge. Case in point: Blind Willie McTell [not to be confused with Blind Willie Johnson, the slide master, but I'll get around to him, too].\n\nHousehold name? Hardly, but consider on ï¿½ Highway 61 Revisited [100% a household name] Dylan sings: \"Nobody can sing the Blues like Blind Willie McTell\".\n\nRoots Blues wasn't limited to the Delta; they spanned Tejas to Georgia also; McTell happened to be from Atlanta. He came up with my current vote for the Greatest Rock&Roll Title, ever, and I sure hope it can be reprinted here, sans bleeps: \"Dying Crapshooter's Blues\".\n\nriverdog\n\nHighway 61 Revisited - $16.99\n\nDying Crapshooter's Blues - Priceless\n\nKeep 'em comin' Slo.\n\nAnother recent pickup for me a fuzzy, gnarly, hairy pair of Ohio kids, guitar and percussion only with a very raw, spare, rocking blues, The Black Keys. They will be spending a lot of time contributing to my further lack of auditory acuity. Turn 'em up loud. You'll thank me for it.\n\nslo\n\nA clarification: On Hwy. 61 Dylan only makes an arcane reference to Blind Willie McTell, but has a SONG by that name [on Bootleg Series [vol. 3]]. AND... the line from \"Lay Lady Lay\" [\"Lay acrost my big, brass...bed\"] is 'lifted' from a Blind Willie McTell song.\n\nI'm still guessing Woodie Guthrie was a bigger hero, however. ;)\n\n...Blind Willie wrote \"Statesboro Blues\", covered by the Allman's, for one...McTell also had other classic songs, with classic titles: \"Love Changing Blues\"; \"Last Dime Blues\"; \"Murder's Home Blues\"(sic); \"Three Women Blues\" [\"Gots 3 womens; yellow, brown, and black\" ].\n\nHe played a 12-string, and enhanced his rich sound with some slide. Unlike a lot of seminal Bluesmen, he recorded over 20+ years; his ï¿½ Atlanta Twelve String [1949] has exceptional sound...a stark contrast to the snap, crackle, pop of Robert Johnson, Blind Willie Johnson, Leadbelly, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and of course, Charley Patton.\n\nI prefer BWJ's singing and playing to the 'more' popular Robert Johnson, m'self. I also 'hear' the influence he had on John Fahey [more than those other guys]. :cool:\n\nI mainly like Dnb (most people would call this \"techno\" :mad:), but its not ALL \"techno\" just because its electronic music, and Im NO raver, lol\n\nAlso like Hip Hop, some laid back type stuff, Sublime, etc...\n\nslo\n\nYou don't mean \"Dub\" do you? No? Well, what's \"Dnb\"? Please don't say \"D and B\"...that wouldn't explain a thing...\n\nI can attest to: Electronic not necessarily = Techno. I'm sure everybody recognizes Kraftwerk's \"Pocket Calculator\"...? That's right; nary a non-synth note, yet 100% pure Pop. Plus, something not a lot of people like to admit: Depeche Mode is: 1.) a 70's Band 2.) Started out a Pop Band [\"What's Your Name\"; \"Just Can't Get Enough\"...'nuff said]. Any \"Techno\" sound/feel is in the attitude, not the instruments.\n\nI like Hip Hop, too, just old school...like Louis Armstrong, and Ella Fitzgerald. :D\n\nSpeaking of techno, anybody heard of a band with the same spelling as my name, \"Loken\"?\n\nrhett\n\nNo, but I used to choose the Loki at Virtual World. :)\n\nslo\n\n...no snappy comeback to 'Loki' humour... http://www.pdga.com/discus/clipart/smile.gif\n\nYou don't mean \"Dub\" do you? No? Well, what's \"Dnb\"? Please don't say \"D and B\"...that wouldn't explain a thing.\n\nDnb stands for Drum and Bass, its pretty popular up here in Raleigh depending on where you hang out at. Its a more \"beat based\" genre of electronic music and its different because it doesnt have the same beat throughout (ie, boom tsk boom tsk)\n\nIf you wanna know what it sounds like go to ncdnb.com and go to audio, I have a few mixes in there too.. (shameless plug)\n\nslo\n\nI've heard OF Drums 'n Bass...it had it's own section in a record store here.\n\n...#8 with a bullet! Danceable, that...I can 'hear' Chemical Bros. in it; hope that's not an insult.\n\nWhat does it mean to make a 'mix'? Do you have to play royalties? Can a 'mix' be all original stuff?\n\nIf I \"make a mix\" its just pretty much me playing other peoples material although it CAN be original tunes too. There are numerous producers in the Carolinas that make some really good tunes but Im not one of them. And \"making a mix\" means you (me) play other peoples tunes, mix them (match tempos and drum patterns) to make one long track where its seamless and the music never stops.\n\nslo\n\nto make one long track where its seamless and the music never stops.\n\nI sure seems that way! It creates a new environment, methinks...\n\n'Sampling', 'mixing', and 'dub'...are they all similar but different? I'm most familiar [I guess] with what was called 'sampling' back then [late 80's]...De la Soul 'sampling' sounds from Johnny Cash, Schoolhouse Rock, etc. on their landmark album ï¿½ 3 Feet High and Rising...familiar with that?!?\n\n...if you're matching beats, does that mean changes in pitch [speed] to one or more pieces?!?\n\nI won't pry [much more] if it's too sensitive, but...can 'mixing' at all lead to legal problems...\"using\" other peoples' music?\n\n'Sampling', 'mixing', and 'dub'...are they all similar but different? I'm most familiar [I guess] with what was called 'sampling' back then [late 80's]...De la Soul 'sampling' sounds from Johnny Cash, Schoolhouse Rock, etc. on their landmark album ï¿½ 3 Feet High and Rising...familiar with that?!?\n\nIm familiar with it. Sampling is more like taking a snippet of one track and using it over another. MOST sampling is done to a finished track, like its already in the recording, does that make sense?\n\n...if you're matching beats, does that mean changes in pitch [speed] to one or more pieces?!?\n\nYeah, sorta. The tempo pretty much stays the same but you speed up or slow down different tracks with pitch controls (speed controls) that are on dj style turntables or CD decks, whichever you are mixing with.\n\nI won't pry [much more] if it's too sensitive, but...can 'mixing' at all lead to legal problems...\"using\" other peoples' music?\n\nOnly if you sell your mixes for profit, then its illegal.\n\nIf only I could control my discs like I control a turntable, lol...\n\nHippity Hop sho to make a booty drop, and other talented artists :cool:\n\nslo\n\nI had a turntable with 10% pitch variable...nice for fitting a 46.6 minute record on a 46.5 minute tape!!\n\nSampling is more like taking a snippet of one track and using it over another. MOST sampling is done to a finished track, like its already in the recording, does that make sense?\n\nNot quite yet, but getting there...I think 'mix' might be different from those other two terms; it's more the result...\"I used a sample to come up with this mix...\" Eh?\n\n...So, is a 'dub' different from a 'sample', or more similar? What would be an 'original' contribution by the Mixer...more drums, synth? Or is the point NOT to add, but to blend?\n\nWhat would be an 'original' contribution by the Mixer...more drums, synth? Or is the point NOT to add, but to blend?\n\nThe mixer lets you overlap two tracks and once matched (in sync/same tempo), they blend seamlessly together. You can sorta sample with a mixer as well. You can play a small sample from one track over another, for instance, a short vocal. Sorta like scratching but without the scratching part, lol.\n\nslo\n\nOppps, I meant the HUMAN as 'Mixer' [MixOR, MixtRESS?]...is that also the name of a devise you use?\n\nSo the MAJORITY of what one hears in the finished product [mix] is somebody else's? Hmmm....gotta figure that one...thought it was the other way 'round.\n\nSo the MAJORITY of what one hears in the finished product [mix] is somebody else's? Hmmm....gotta figure that one...thought it was the other way 'round.\n\nYeah, pretty much what you are doing is blending (mixing with beats matched and TWO tunes playing over each other) to make one long track with records produced by other people. Although, there are local producers around here (producers of Drum and Bass) that mix their own tunes but they are mixed with cd decks.\n\nslo\n\n...what you are doing is blending (mixing with beats matched and TWO tunes playing over each other) to make one long track with records produced by other people. Although, there are local producers around here (producers of Drum and Bass) that mix their own tunes...\n\nI can see the logic there [aside from ability]...suppose one of your mixes is worthy of airplay, perhaps even in a major market...then you wouldn't have to scramble for legal waivers, etc. Or just plain stay out of court! :o\n\n...so...you show up for a party, or whatever /msgboard/images/graemlins/smirk.gif, with two turntables, a copy of Steely Dan's ï¿½ Aja in one hand, ï¿½ Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison in the other, and...what else? A drum machine? Tape loops? Mr. Microphone? Jaco Pastorius?\n\nI'm incredulous all that sound can come from but two sources...[?]...!\n\nslo\n\nSpraying to all fields:\n\nAnybody heard the Beach Boys' [well, really more like Brian Wilson's] ï¿½ SMiLE(sic), yet?\n\n37 years in-the-making; spanning 4 decades [60's, 70's, 90's, Naughties]; hyped as \"The Greatest Album Never Made\", etc. I saw it on the list of somebody who was posting here a month ago; sadly, he hasn't even been on the board since 10/12. :confused: Mr. Wilson performed it [and other BB favs] in its entirety here in La-La recently, with an 18-piece back-up...the concert review was beyond magnificent; sublime; ethereal in beauty, even.\n\n...though it took 37 years to come to fruition, bits of SMiLE dribbled out over the years...the best known: \"Good Vibrations\".\n\nRiverdog, I'm thoroughly enjoying most of your 'tips'...I even found one with TWO of your picks, together: North Missip Allstars AND Warren Haynes, live...almost like Gregg never left us! :p\n\nIll4, sorry if I picked your brain to the point of pain...please come back; share some insight!\n\nriverdog\n\nDe nada Slo. You mean almost like Duane never left us? Not coincidentally I grew up in Macon, Ga., and was introduced to the Allman Brothers and a whole lot else at the 2nd, and last, Annual Atlanta Pop Festival. It was a right good time to be alive and kicking in Macon. Lots of old and gray stuff - Wet Willie, White Witch, Grinder Switch, Eddie Hinton, Eric Quincy Tate, basically anyone in the defunct Capricorn Records catalog, and of course the cornerstones of southern soul Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett and Oowwwwwwwww.... James Brown. Even Little Richard. I went from being a crewcut and proper southern boy to being a long haired and bearded but still proper \"Yes mam\" and \"No mam\" southern boy, an apparent dichotomy that some folks never realized weren't mutually exclusive. Actually served me well in keeping my silly [*****] out of trouble when I found myself out of my depth. Ahhhh.... way too long a week and way too tired to continue along this line very far.\n\nTip of the week - Robert Randolph and the Family Band \"Live at the Wetlands\" and back to his roots \"The Word\". Pedal steel guitar like you never knew it could be played.\n\nIll4, sorry if I picked your brain to the point of pain...please come back; share some insight!\n\nIts pretty much plugging two turntables into a mixer and blending the tracks together by bringing in one tune and layering over another so the music never stops.\n\nAnd I dont mind AT ALL if you pick my brain, I like talking about dj'ing and explaining what it is, how to do it, etc. PICK AWAY!\n\nslo\n\nThanks for those \"visuals\", Riverdog! That had to be '67, [Otis] right?\n\nQuite a while since I've heard 'Capricorn Records' or 'Wet Willie'.\n\nNow, as for the Soul Brothers #'s 1B, 1&1/2 ;), and 1A...are you messing-with my mind; this was the SAME show?!? AND the Instigator, Perpetrator, Originator, et al, TOO? :eek: That blows my \"Cal Jam II\" experience to bits!\n\nYou mean almost like Duane never left us?\n\nL'Doh! Right right; my goof. The Allman who ranks in the top handful for his profession, natch! Besides, I believe Gregg, ex-King Crimsonite [\"Catfood\" ;)], he, doth still live. I understand Mr. Haynes doubles as a neo-Duane, and neo-Jerry, both? While that's one pair of tall boots to fill, the first seems much a much better/more natural fit, as while Duane is one of the most imitable players, Jerry was/is equally totally inimitable. Chops can be perfected; it's hard to emulate the totally unexpected...just my $.02. Less-than-zero complaints with the effort[s]...\n\nAs for slide, Blind Willie Johnson has to be up there. He's a different Blind Willie than per above.\n\nï¿½ Praise God I'm Satisfied [Yazoo L-1058; 1927] rates 7-on-a-5 scale, for \"slidework\" and Blues, both. Ry Cooder based a whole <font size = 2>career</font> on but <font size=2>one</font> of his riffs. :eek:\n\nill4 wrote:\n\nIts pretty much plugging two turntables into a mixer and blending the tracks together by bringing in one tune and layering over another so the music never stops.\n\nSo in a typical piece/movement/work, how many chunks of vinyl would one use?\n\nI think what might be confusing me is this type of music has such a unique sound, I don't see it coming 'out' of something else. I donï¿½t recognize any of the \"components\", unless it's something obvious, like the Cash vocal to \"3 Feet High and Rising\" on that De la Soul album I referenced. I also don't hear drums used like that, away from \"D&B\". That's why I supposed a machine might be used.\n\nPerhaps the functions of the 'mixbox' are also a mystery...can you somehow 'lift' a 4-second \"hook\" and repeat it over, and over, without having to 'scratch' the vinyl? Can you do \"Frippertronicsï¿½\"? [Another unexpected King Crimson corollary; odd that.]\n\nDoes Classic Rock get used much for the \"source documents\"? If a Mixtrator were to use a Beatles/Stones/Kinks/Who motif, you can bet I'd recognize. But it's a blank what is being used. 'New Age'? 'Alternative Jazz'? Tangerine Dream? 80's Disco? P.I.L.?\n\nWhy the shy on vocals? :confused: [for the idiom]\n\n...and...is 'unaffiliated' a nice word for 'not paid'? http://chat.pups.ru/img/big_smile.gif\n\nriverdog\n\n:cool:Mornin' all. A little more rested. And sorry for leaving the impression that all those folks were at the same festival. A lot of them were there, but even more better I saw all of them in everything from no name little Broadway clubs to semi-communal living rooms and even a bonfire or two. (a geographic note - Broadway \"Street\" on the southeast side of Macon, Georgia in no way resembled or resembles it's better known namesake. It was a couple of miles of body shops, empty store fronts, a \"chicken shack\" or two, sunblasted weedy parking lots and several pretty cool little juk' joints; and over all this was generally the smell of the Kraft Paper mill). Grant's Lounge is a name you'll pick up from locals from that time, but that's just because it was one of the few clubs that had a relatively long life span with the same name, or with a name at all for that matter.\n\nAs for the 2nd Annual Atlanta Pop Festival, it was '69?..., '70?..., '70 I think. The Allman Brothers were well known within the blues, rock community but that is the festival that pretty much put them on everyone's radar. According to whose figures you believe 200,000, 400,000 or 600,000 souls were in attendance for the three days. Byron Raceway, a couple of miles from my folk's house, was the venue and not remotely capable of handling that many people even if they had come in on buses. The two lane country roads for miles around were literal parking lots with vehicles just being left where the owners could drive no farther. Sorry, got to rambling. Allman Brothers, Country Joe and the Fish, Otis, James, Ravi Shankar, Mountain, Richie Havens, Procol Harem, and, and, and, Jimi Hendrix....... can't even remember 'em all. A close friend recently gifted me a video copy of most of Hendrix' performance there. It's rough and ragged, but sure brings back the times............\n\nslo\n\nTryin' to make a livin' the best you can? :D[Lead guitar by...whom?][One of my pet trivia questions.]\n\nYeah, I didn't think Otis and the Allmans overlapped...I'm digging every bit, though...memory lane, 'n all...I like how you put 'street' in quotation marks!\n\nFor those not in the loop, Macon...Gee-A...was hometowne to the 'young man who became a legend in his own time'.

They were great and the song from Peter's latest \"UP\" has their incredible harmonies on a song called Sky Blue. Buy it, Download it, whatever you need to do to get it because it is a great song. Seeing it live was worth the ticket price alone, but it was nice that he threw in about 17 more songs too :D:D:D\n\nriverdog\n\nThanks, J.

How's that new \"De Ja VooDoo\"? Is it studio or live?\n\nriverdog\n\n\"Senator\" John Glenn from here in Y'ville usually makes it.\n\nI've never missed a Govt Mule show in the last 7 years around here. How's that new \"De Ja VooDoo\"? Is it studio or live?\n\nI like the new studio record and a number of the songs are really working out to be good \"live\" songs. I caught them in Raleigh recently and have posted recordings online of the Raleigh & Richmond shows..... The Halloween show in Richmond was excellent. Here's a picture of the band in their costumes.... Warren as Uncle Sam, Matt as the devil, Andy Hess as Colin Powell, Danny Louis as Nixon & guest Ron Holloway as the Statue of Liberty.\n\nhttp://www.mindspring.com/~goheels/halloween_mule.jpg\n\nAnd here's an old picture you might find interesting......

That was a great concert too. Paula Cole was his female back up and she was good. Not as good as Kate Bush but not too far off. \"Growing Up\" was also a spectacular stage production in the round. You MUST check these out because the theatrics during the show are not often offered by bands anymore. It's a combination of music and theatre.\n\nThe bottom line is with Peter's voice you can't go wrong.\n\nslo\n\n* WELL! *\n\n...I post every day, and I'm the only one here...I take a vacation, and look at the activity...are you guys trying to tell me something?!? :confused:\n\nDis'n...git Er...whomever you are by the time you see this...my of-a-feather friend...have you actually LISTENED to all that music?!? :eek: It doesn't seem mathmatically possible, even with all the cï¿½fe in Java...but then, I've been know to 'collect', just for the sake of 'having', myself...fur-eeking-ARE-sum collection... :oWHAT could a guy like you POSSIBLY look for, in trading, etc.?!?\n\n...I'm heavily into CAN, at the moment...yes, Tago Mago <font size=-2>[see above]</font> IS one of the under-appreciated monsterpieces of all time...make sure you get the version with 7 songs; no need for two discs. Its follow-up, ï¿½ Ege Bamyasi, is incredible, and search-worthy, too. After that, they got mellower/less-interesting...but word is the LIVE stuff, circa 1971-1977, caught them at the height of their considerable powers.\n\nI'm touting them as: \"Sounding like Floyd, if they were a jam band\"ï¿½.\n\nriverdog\n\nVacation? Where'd ya go, where'd ya go, where'd ya go Slo? :)\n\n*\n\nDis'n...git Er...whomever you are by the time you see this...my of-a-feather friend...have you actually LISTENED to all that music?!?\n\nFirst off..... I'm no youngun'.... I'm 45 years old (still young at heart though) and have been listening to music..... both recorded and live for most of my life.... and continue to do so. I have listened to almost everything you see in those pictures at one time or another. Now there definitely is a lot of it that I haven't heard recently.... but I always enjoy pulling out goodies from the collection that I haven't heard in many years.... and I still play those vinyl records which sound mighty fine on the Linn Sondek LP12.\n\nEarly on in junior high & high school, I was into mainly hard rock (Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple, etc).... then in college at UNC I expanded my tastes while working in college radio at WXYC, to include many other bands and types of music (Neil Young, Pink Floyd, Bob Marley, Miles Davis, Weather Report, Return To Forever, Elvis Costello, Talking Heads..... and also first really got into the Grateful Dead). After college, my fascination with the Dead grew as I saw close to 100 shows.... and I got into other \"jammy\" bands... Phish, WIdespread Panic, String Cheese Incident, and lots of bluegrass. Most of the bands I see live today I record since the majority of them support the recording and trading of their shows. Some of my current favs are..... Gov't Mule, Railroad Earth, Mofro, Vinyl, Yonder Mountain String Band and many more.\n\nI also have twin boys who are sophomores in high school.... and who oddly enough still like the music that dad listens to. Maybe it was taking them to a Grateful Dead show when they were 5 years old, but I get a kick out of them borrowing CD's to listen to and/or put on their Rio Karma's. Their also getting pretty good at disc golf and out drive me big time..... Of course I usually beat them..... at least for now.\n\nEnough about me........ time to go try out the new Sidewinder.\n\nriverdog\n\n*\n\nI also have twin boys who are sophomores in high school.... and who oddly enough still like the music that dad listens to.

I'm 52 and have experienced the same thing with my junior at UNCG School of Dance daughter. Some of my fondest memories of her as an urchin are Sunday mornings after a Saturday night bivy camping trip in the mountains with everything spread out drying and warming in the sun on a rock outcrop somewhere........ and indelibly linked to anything from Allman Brothers to Marley to Mountain to even Ray Lynch or Mike Cross playing on the car stereo with all the doors open......... Somehow in all that ya gotta figure that maybe all of our youth wasn't mis-spent, huh?\n\nLeaving Y'ville in a bit to see how Sidewinders roll on the \"foreign\" turf at Barber in G'boro.\n\nslo\n\nDis'n...git Er...whomever you are by the time you see this...\n\nNo offense meant, by the way...it's just you've changed your handle since I read last...that's still one heck of a collection, though...I've got a year-or-so on you, fossil-wise, but didn't buy my second album 'til the mid-seventies...nor do I record.\n\nThe earnings from my first job, which paid $1.50/hour, went to buy a $200 turntable...which was A LOT, for 1974!!\n\nWe had some music in our family, but not much...the rote kids' stuff...our \"record player\" had 4 speeds [16, 33, 45, 78], a replaceable, metal stylus, which looked like the end of a blunt pencil, and an armature to stack records, ensuring they'd be PLENTY scratched in no time. By the way, this \"stacking\" is why albums like ï¿½ Tommy have sides 1/4 on one disc, and 2/3 on the other. This was discontinued sometime in the '70's; ï¿½ Quadrophenia [1973] was, Donna Summer's [yikes!]ï¿½ Once Upon a Time [1977] still was; ï¿½ Sandanista! [1980] went 1/2, 3/4, 5/6.\n\nI kinda burnt out on 'Hard Rock' around '74; it seemed like BTO's ï¿½ Not Fragile was the dead-end-of-the-road. That year I also discovered one of the most under-appreciated [not to mention influential, to Punk, New Wave, etc.] bands, ever, Sparks...a cult band, if ever there was one...their ï¿½ Kimono My House has been called [by those more knowledgeable than I] \"The Sgt. Pepper's of the Seventies\". Never woulda been an Oingo Boingo, et al, without 'em...\n\nThe mid-seventies brought Springsteen, DEVO, and the Punks, so that was a real resurrection...yet, so, so sadly, I was never introduced to The Dead at this time [1992, Silver Bowl]...I thought they were a \"Dinosaur Band\"...despite their playing here in Long Beach, and in next-door Riverside [annually, it seemed].\n\nI began writing about/reviewing bands/music in 1980; I actually got paid to do so [:eek:], as well as gain free entry/backstage status @ such famous L.A. clubs as The Whiskey, The Roxy, and O.C.'s infamous Coocoo's <font size=-2>[sp?]</font> Nest. I got access to do interviews; I queried Adam Ant; shook Edgar Winter's hand; that's still a thrill. I almost got the student newspaper at CSULB disbanded, just for quoting one of Lee Ving's [FEAR] sexist vernaculars, in an exclusive interview [which ran on the front page, by the way /msgboard/images/graemlins/smirk.gif].\n\n...and after all this [without mentioning 'Disco', even], I'm still learning how little I know!! :o:o:oThanks to all by friends for making it this far; thanks for proffering YOUR favs; that just enrichens my 'vocabulary'. :cool:\n\nRiverdog, that was prolly pretty clever, but it went over my head...:o...I had a \"working\" vacation, just staying home, doing some yardwork, and working on my officials' test.\n\nSting, if you feel so strongly about Mr. Gabriel's latest, that you have to schtick it in your signature, that's a good incentive to check it out...when's the last time you got thanked by a LAKER fan?!? Thanks! ;)\n\nSting, if you feel so strongly about Mr. Gabriel's latest, that you have to schtick it in your signature, that's a good incentive to check it out...when's the last time you got thanked by a LAKER fan?!? Thanks! ;)\n\nI just turned 46 and back in the day my first album was Johnny Winter \"And\" ... 1970. I still remember watching In Concert on ABC and heading down to Dearborn Music the next morning to get Edgar Winter \"They only come out at night\" the next morning for $2.99. I also remember Emerson, Lake, and Palmer on \"In Concert\" with the full grand piano up on giant 20 foot tall posts and Keith Emerson stapped in and spinning around while playing. Ah back to the days when bands created their own music and sound. Who's Next and Sticky Fingers (yes with the zipper on the album cover) were mainstays on my turntable ... ohhhh sister morphine how long have I been layin' here ?? ohhhh I can't crawl across the floor ... :)\n\nAs for Peter, he is dedicated to the best sound so it makes it worth the listen for sure ... that really is why it is in my signature because I know there is a lot of music knowledge and great people dedicated to great sound in this thread :D\n\nAs for Laker fans, I was thanked in 1989 after game 4 for saving Laker fans money from buying more tickets to any more games that year. I even offered a free broom to commerate the SWEEP. As for last season, I'm still waiting for thanks for basically the same premise. Think of the time and money saved by not having to watch/go to those last 2 games in L.A.\n\nBut my real thanks came from within the organization and having Kobe essentially tear apart a strong team and run off the Coach and Big Man basically sealing their fate as just another team :o:o\n\nslo\n\n*sniff* Younger's ï¿½ Shock Treatment was my self-prescribed medicine, and SECOND ever LP boughten, post- \"Rock Concert\" viewing of Edgar, Rick Derringer, \"Frankenstein\", \"Free Ride\" [possibly different dates?] etc.; Sparks was on in Fall '74, if memory serves. $2.99+, those, likely. First $3.99 tarried was one of the Queen clones; '76?\n\n*boo hoo* The last time I paid for Laker tickets, West was in uniform, so no 'welcomes', there, thanks...:o Look down on that console you're getting hi fi on [put dust cover on over the armature and stacking devise so you don't dottage something over], turn that dial, move that red verticle band [hoping the bands don't bind] to a scratch-mark labeled: \"Free Laker Games on Radio\", no cost. New fangled, that. Never a sell-out, either. :D\n\nslo\n\nI got the free winamp media player, and I don't ever see using the windows mp again. Also, something called \"R4\" which plays visuals to the beat of the music. It's faster...the equalizer has more bands...seems more intuitive, and have keener features, to boot!\n\n...right, I mean RIGHT now, listening to: Uprising Tour 1980 in Dortmund DVD :p.\n\nListen to The JB's\n\ncircle_2\n\n'Coming in from the Cold'... - \"No no no no..no no no no..no Jack(?) no!\"\n\n'Uprising' has always been my favorite! :cool:\n\nslo\n\nListen to The JB's\n\nYou don't mean the \"JGB's\"? :eek: That looks like an avatar of Jerry, to me at least. :D\n\n*Heh*, I have a recording by JB's, James Brown's backupband band, called ï¿½ Funky Good Time: The Anthology, a two-discer. James is on there too, but in an adjunct manner...the focus is on his crack band. They have quite a few releases on their own, I understand.\n\n...if you need a viable definition of the concept: \"Groove\", listen to the JB's! :p\n\nI like String Cheese Incident, Moe, Phish, Ben Harper, Yonder Mountain String Band, Jack Johnson, Dr. Z's Experiment, etc. :)\n\nand a little Bela Fleck, O.A.R., and even a little Big Wu (saw them in concert last month!). :D\n\nwasn't this the what music you like thread??? or am I just...\n\nThree posts in a row....looks like you're talking to yourself. :D\n\nSouthern Culture on the Skids, Black Eyed Peas, Door's, Dr. Hector and the Groove injectors, Bootsy Collins, Shnia Twain, Britney Spears, Annie Lenox, Man the answer is endless.

I said semi-------- :cool:\n\nDoors... very good choice, especially early Doors before Morrison sorta fell apart with the drugs. Drugs are bad..\n\non the contrary though, drugs inspired a large majority of the doors music in one way or another. :D\n\nto a degree i agree, but as the doors progressed throughout there careers the drugs became too much, especially for morrison, i have live videos from concerts where he couldn't even remember songs and just sorta did what he wanted, the band would just look at him angrily and continue to play the same 4 bars until hed start up again, and all of this falling down and slurring and such... he just sorta fell apart :(\n\ni'd have to agree, the doors later stuff didn't compare to their earlier work, and morrison definitely fell apart... I also have seem some pretty funny shows on VH1 classics where morrison was way to messed up to be performing... sad in a way...\n\nslo\n\n\"When I try to step aside, I move to where they'd hoped I'd be\" - Phish \"Heavy Things\"\n\nOne could argue they we're the greatest jamband from 1995*-on...so, has Phish finally 'stepped aside' [called it quits], or are they on a sabbatical, will there again be an Oysterhead w/Les, will Trey record/tour solo and if so, will we be hearing/seeing the \"Materhorn\", and what about the 'other guys'...or what\n\n<font size=-3>*...this is obvious...right?</font>\n\nChris Hysell\n\nThe new Tupac is okay but the newest Ludacris cd is a joy to listen to.\n\nPhish is gone now, to my disappointment. :( Fishman will continue to do work with Vida Blue and Trey will continue to do his solo thing. It was pretty much because of Trey and his \"the music isn't going where I want it\" attitude and because honestly I think he thinks he IS Phish. Oh well though, I like most of his solo stuff and I stil have years worth of live stuff to listen to...\n\nWho knows though... maybe someday they'll be back :D, for now, I'll focus on listening to more String Cheese Incident, Moe, and Big Wu.. :D\n\nslo\n\nAnybody else <font size=-3>*cough*</font> burn backup copies of their <font size=-3>*hack*</font> storebought discs, as a contingency? I have a new operating system; the burner is one by \"nero\", which allows eq and 'loudness' changes, and also has something called \"stereo widening\". It's still so new-to-me I have nothing to report, yet, but it's a feature I'm glad to have, and will experiment with, etc. :p\n\ncircle_2\n\nI am PUMPED!

If you like Mule and N. Miss. A. and don't know Indigenous you'll thank me for it. :cool:\n\ncircle_2\n\nriverdog - have seen Indigenous at least 12 times! They were at our music fest last Summer...saw both shows there! Mato Nanji can flat-out RIP/THRASH~IT!!! A modern SRV... :cool:\n\nI met Mato after a gig in KC a couple years back...a way cool dude!\n\nslo\n\nIt the band \"3_6\", or \"old school 3_6\"? Discriminating 'librarians' need to know.\n\n...and I'm going to go waaaaaaaaay out on a limb, and guess they fall into the 'jamband' pidgeonhole?\n\nriverdog\n\nMan I wish they toured this part of the world more often. I mentioned somewhere in the depths of this thread that the first, and only, time I've seen them my wife and I had driven to Atlanta where her brothers POOSSLQ was surprsing him with a Chastain Park Jonny Lang show. Chastain is a killer outdoor venue in an ancient concrete bowl tucked into a hillside of large yellow pines. Great place for a summer evening concert. I asked her who was opening. She couldn't remember as it was someone she had never heard of. I walked in the gate, looked to my right and saw a booth selling \"Indigenous\" gear and dropped my jaw. Mato Nanji rocked a few more chunks out of the Chastain concrete that night and, for me at least, stole the show. :cool:\n\nriverdog\n\nAnd Circle 2, we have an expat from the KC crowd you might have met, James Wallace, skinny dude, long straight sandy hair, helped the crowd with revamping Rosedale. He's hiding out here in western NC now and was a huge help in our efforts rebuilding the local Yadkinville, NC course. Climbs a tree like a freaking squirrel and puts in new pin positions every time you blink. Glad law enforcement didn't catch him at the border. /msgboard/images/graemlins/smirk.gif\n\nIt the band \"3_6\", or \"old school 3_6\"? Discriminating 'librarians' need to know.\n\n...and I'm going to go waaaaaaaaay out on a limb, and guess they fall into the 'jamband' pidgeonhole?\n\nI'm not sure if your last sentance was sarcastic or not but 3-6 mafia is a rap group which means they are as far away from the jamband pidgeonhole as can be.\n\nslo\n\nNot at all sarcastic! A biased guess yes, but sincere! In fact, I thought one of above posters was identifying as \"mafia\" for 3_6, like \"Kiss Army\"... sad, but...you decide. :DOK, thanks; now I can check/decide for myself.\n\ncome on now...\n\nhow many jambands have cds named Tear da Club Up Thugs, When the Smoke Clears, or Da Unbreakables Chopped and Screwed, or even Memphis Underground? And I can tell you, I for sure wouldn't take them seriously with names like Crunchy Black, DJ Paul, and Juicy J... :D\n\ncircle_2\n\nriverdog, thanks for the heads-up on Indigenous...that news made my gal's day...she's stoked! :cool:\n\nAll Indigenous' shows previous to our music festival featured another family member (they're all related BTW!) on congos...though I didn't see him this last time(s). He adds a lot of power to the show...especially when he uses drumsticks to sharpen his punchy sound! He shreds the congos in a 'Mato' kind of way...! :eek:\n\nI don't recall a James Wallace...I've only been playing since '97. Perhaps he has some deeper roots 'round here than I...\n\nslo\n\ncome on now...\n\nhow many jambands have cds named Tear da Club Up Thugs, When the Smoke Clears, or Da Unbreakables Chopped and Screwed, or even Memphis Underground?\n\nAll stuff I had no way of knowing; now YOU guys are doing the kidding...I tolds youses I'm not much up on what's current...that's why I share the 'dinosaur' stuff, and query about the new.\n\nriverdog\n\nSlo, I think ya lost 'em at \"query\". ;)\n\nslo\n\n:D\n\nOK, more plain: anything in the span 'Beatles live on Ed Sullivan Show [Feb 1964]' to [roughly] London Calling by the Clash is my area of \"expertise\". After that, presume I know less than you.\n\nriverdog\n\nWe have a winner!\n\nWho's Ed Sullivan? The Crash.....??\n\n:D:D:D:D:D\n\nSlo, there is no reason to feel bad about not knowing 3-6 mafia. In fact, you should feel good for not knowing them. I wish i didn't.\n\nslo\n\nI have nothing against rap/hip-hop; I'm always schtumping De La Soul's first, but I see the logic of the poster who pointed out this idiom is something a polar opposite of 'jambandage'...there's a lot of \"scripting\" happening...a typical rap song might require literaly hundreds of \"takes\" before a few score are edited together for a whole...quite removed from a celebration of the act of creation. The best 'Dead' recordings are live; there aren't a lot of live-in-concert RAP albums...are there?!?\n\n...My inner devil would like to advocate something called \"scat\" singing, it's been around since the 1930's, at the latest [e.g. Ella Fitzgerald], and THAT'S totally free-form vocal stylings. Also...some artists/poets CAN come up with great rhyme on the fly. THAT's happened since the 'Beatnik' era [mid-late 1950's], at the latest.\n\nA couple bands that I've been digging lately are Mofro & Railroad Earth.\n\nMofro's music has been called \"front porch soul\" and I'd highly suggest catching them live if they come near you. JJ is a great song writer with a soulful voice..... you know it's gotta be good with song names like..... \"Ho Cake\", \"Dirt Floor Cracka\", \"How Junior Got His Head Put Out\" & \"Jookhouse\".... Find out more at www.mofro.net (http://www.mofro.net)\n\nRailroad Earth is great jammy/grassy band from New Jersey with a couple fine records out on the Sugar Hill label. They've recently caught the attention of Phil Lesh (who caught one of their shows out west) and some of the members of the band were in Phil's band for the most recent Phil & Friends shows. Supposedly they'll be onboard for the upcoming Mardis Gras shows by Phil as well. Check them out at: http://www.railroadearth.com/\n\nIf you're into downloading live music.....

In fact, many a weekend have Itraveled to KC or Minneapolis or wherever to experience these bands. :D\n\nJust because we're young doesn't mean we don't know music, and not everyone who listens to rap only listens to rap. :)\n\nriverdog\n\nWell said. Sorry, once again I was playing the professional old guy. Happens sometimes when you find yourself pursuing passions more identified with those who are considerably younger. Shoot, I just did it again, didn't I. Reflex I suppose.

The album was produced by Ben Folds and features some cool cameos by Joe Jackson, Ben Folds, Lemon Jelly, and some other folks. One of those smile while you listen type albums.\n\nFuture purchases:\n\nThe Libertines\n\nRilo Kiley\n\nEarlimart\n\nTed Leo & the Pharmacists\n\nBelle & Sebastian\n\nThe Mooney Suzuki\n\nslo\n\nOn that last list, I've heard of the Mooney Suzuki, and that's it. THAT'S why I pay attention here!!\n\n...regular readers might remember how I went on and on...about Krautrockers CAN a couple of months back. The original singer for CAN was American Malcolm Mooney, and he was replaced by Nipponese expatriate Damo Suzuki. Sheesh, talk about kudos! :cool:\n\n...I got a freebie fanzine from Virginmegastore describing Mooney Suzuki as \"...shaggy heros of the three-chord progression...decidedly retro, mining the Stones, the Stooges, the Sonics and the MC5 with absolute abandon to turn out goodtime jams, fun and simple.\"\n\n...let us know, Matt! :p\n\ncwphish\n\nAfter this DG'er shoots some night golf, it's off to see Hot Tuna, acoustic and electric. Boo yaaa!\n\ncwphish\n\nStrike that....it was last night :(\n\nxterramatt\n\nSo, would last night's Hot Tuna be Leftover Salmon?\n\nBa dum bum.\n\ncircle_2\n\n\"Phosphorescent Rat\", BABY!!\n\ncwphish\n\nThat was a good one Matt. As much as I enjoy Jorma, I could never put them in the same ranks as the original salmon!\n\nThat was a good one Matt. As much as I enjoy Jorma, I could never put them in the same ranks as the original salmon!\n\nThe original Hot Tuna was killah..... and the Jorma & Friends ELECTRIC set at this year's Christmas Jam was pretty sweet as well.... Now Leftover Salmon around 1997-1999 were pretty amazing too..... particularly when Vince kept the silly sh*t to a minimum..... RIP Mark Vann.\n\nslo\n\nThat was a good one Matt. As much as I enjoy Jorma, I could never put them in the same ranks as the original salmon!\n\nI'll bet there are quite a few of us paleontolgists who would never put Hot Tuna into Jorma and Jack's PREVIOUS group's ranking. ;) But that's just in jest, yes, Tuna had talent to burn; and nothing beats the LIVE music experience. :p\n\nPoint me to that \"Bye 'Plane\", I'll go... :DSorry you missed out.\n\nThe one I have at my disposal is Live '75.\n\nI might have already mentioned that. Say WHAT now?!?\n\nslo\n\nI've heard a bit of The Mooney Suzuki now, and whislt they sound 'nothing' like CAN, I can say for sure that they kick! Here's from a businessite (http://www.video-c.co.uk/showvids.asp?vidref=them005):\n\n'Who wants to be rock'n'roll's saviours? Yeah, the Strokes were trying, but two of their members tried out for the Mooney Suzuki and didn't make it. So the job goes to this NYC four-piece....The Mooney Suzuki. [Q magazine]'\n\n\"The Mooney Suzuki simply blow all other bands out of the water, they're [*****]ing great. They have toured the states relentlessly to become arguably one of the best guitar fuelled, riff thumping bands around. They release single 'Alive and Amplified' the title track from their new rip roaring album on September 6th.\" [from their website]\n\n...for that one song, at least, \"rip roaring\" is pretty apt!!\n\n...highly recommended by my peer Dave: ï¿½ Live in Paris by the White Stripes. ï¿½ Derek @ the Dominos Live, a 2 disc cd set. No, this isn't the \"In Concert\" set from the 70's, and NO, \"Skydog\" wasn't there, but \"God\" was inspired! ;)\n\nPRIMUS SUCKS\n\nand if you dont understand...\n\nPRIMUS SUCKS\n\nrshelt\n\nIf you like Prog. rock, there's a great one out by a guy called Neal Morse. His new cd is called \"One\". It has Mike Portnoy on drums, Phil Keaggy on bass. It is concidered a christian band, but don't let that scare you, the music is top notch.\n\nslo\n\n...Am I the last to know? Already 75,700 hits on 'google' for \"The Mooney Suzuki\".\n\nI've listened to quite a bit of this NYC band the last couple of days...and I still can't come up with anything more articulate than: WOW!! I can't remember being this excited about a debut album [ their ï¿½ People Get Ready, from Fall 2K4] since 1977...the year of firsts by The Clash, Talking Heads, and The Jam, to name a few.\n\nFrom All Music Guide: \"This is an album that, no matter how retro the band might sound, still can make one excited that music like this is still extant in the world.\"\n\nNot only that, but judging on a video of a show in Chicago 2 weeks before its release, they've got stage presence, and a sense of humour, to boot. :cool:\n\n...these guys and the Black Keys are at the top of my \"new\" stuff list, with a bullet. ;)\n\nxterramatt\n\nJust bought The Mooney Suzuki's Alive and Amplified. This album is a MUST BUY if you like your rock. Reminds me of when I first heard Lenny Kravitz, he sounded unlike anything out there at the time, but still, familiar and intoxicating. Really, really, really must get this one. Such a road trip album.\n\nJust bought The Mooney Suzuki's Alive and Amplified. This album is a MUST BUY if you like your rock.

This album is a MUST BUY if you like your rock. Reminds me of when I first heard Lenny Kravitz, he sounded unlike anything out there at the time, but still, familiar and intoxicating. Really, really, really must get this one. Such a road trip album.\n\nSay, you didn't buy the vinyl, GATEFOLD version, did you? I saw it for $13.99 ++, but didn't have the coin. Shakes of Santana, and Axis: Bold As Love, as well. Opps, I mean 'shades of,' Frylock! ;)\n\nThe title track is prolly the one 'getting around'. \"Legal High\" and \"Shake That Bush Again\" also. Many great ones; those are the tops.\n\n...also saw the video of ï¿½ White Stripes in Paris recently, and that kicks in a Zeppelin way...Jack White is like the Jimmy Page of this generation...plus some.\n\n...all this retro has pulled me BACK into DIGGING VIDEOS OF the Stooges, and the REAL \"raw power\", the Motor City Five [aka MC5]. :p\n\nKICK OUT THE JAMS, BROTHERS AND SISTERS!!\n\ncircle_2\n\nHere's a link to our Wakarusa (http://www.wakarusa.com/2005/musiclineup.asp) Music and Camping Festival musical lineup. Last year there were temp DG courses on site...not sure if it's in the cards for this year. My gal and I have already purchased our tickets! Was a blast last year!\n\nxterramatt\n\n\"Loose and Juicy\" is another good one, as well as \"Primitive Condition\".\n\nIt came with both a sweet 70s funkified afro american nude a la what Scatman Crothers had over his couch in \"The Shining\" and it also came with a single 2 sided slip cover. I guess so you could hang the other art somewhere else. I got it at Best Buy for $11.99. Then I won our DGU round that same day to the tune of $6. Great disc.\n\n20460chase\n\nHas anyone heard the new Eric Clapton tribute to Robert Johnson? I listened to half and was absouloutly blown away.What do you expect from God?\n\ncircle_2\n\nGod died in a helicoptor crash in '90. SRV, RIP. :(\n\n20460chase\n\nI can respect your opinion. At least you didnt say Kurt Cobang.\n\nslo\n\nHas anyone heard the new Eric Clapton tribute to Robert Johnson? I listened to half and was absouloutly blown away.What do you expect from God?\n\nI saw that this last week! If you saw but the first half, the best is yet to come!!!\n\nI thought the 'sessions' got better as it went along; the highlight had to be recording in that abandoned hotel in...was it Dallas? Yeah, great picking, almost as good as the original, and much cleaner!!\n\nI also got my hands on a SECOND* Yardbirds disc w/Slowhand, ï¿½ Live! Blueswailing July '64; it sounds REALLY cleaned up!\n\n<font size=-4>* until now there had only been ï¿½ Five Live Yardbirds with Eric; everything else is Page/Beck.</font>\n\n20460chase\n\nI also saw the 461 Ocean Boulavard 30th anniversary remaster that included a live set from england that just looked incredible.Sucks being broke right now.\n\npterodactyl\n\nI saw the Moody Blues last night in Stockton's renovated Bob Hope Theatre. They were awesome! Light show was total 70's twirling, psychodelic pastels. 2 drummers, 2 on flutes and 2 young chicks to supplement the singing. I'm just a singer in a rock n roll band!\n\nslo\n\nWhilst we're mentioning relics, new to most: ï¿½ Festival Express docu-video. I experienced a vhs dub off the variable release, which as I've mentioned, still sounds quite representational on that big tape. Much better than tape to 'compacts', at least...but anyways, here's Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, and other period pieces, seen from behind-the-scenes, carousing in a private, westbound train crossing none-too-peaceful Canada, the emsemble often drunk, always playing, and occationally performing, during May, 1970. Like you say, daddio...Dig. ;) :cool:\n\nslo\n\nI'm seriously uninformed: Are Big Wu, Wu-Tang Killa Bees, and Wu Tang Clan three seperate groups? :confused:\n\nradio\n\njocur\n\nAll have different memebers, but all part of the Wu family.\n\nWu Tang Clan, Killa Bees, Wu-Syndicate, Gravediggaz...\n\nslo\n\nMuch appreciated! Any specific TITLES to recommend? :p\n\n...well, I'm almost ready to form an opinion on Bright eyes, if anybody has anything to say about 'the new Dylan', Nebraskan Conner Oberst. The guy in the local says he lives up to that title MORE than the rest of the 'imitators to the throne' over the last 2-3 decades...COMBINED.\n\n...I certainly wouldn't lump 'Spruce' in that bag. ;)\n\njocur\n\nAny Gravediggaz is really good, stay away from Killa Bees. Wu Tang's 36 Chambers and FOREVER are classic Wu-Tang. Cappadonna's, The Pillage is good as well. Tical, Method Man's first album is a good buy. And Ghostface Killa's debut album, especially the Winter Wars track is nearly untouchable.\n\nWuTangs first - 36 chambers and GZA's Liquid Swords are what I think to be the best coming out from this group. If you don't like mid-nineties East Coast rap though or RZA's style of production you should probably stay away from anything WuTang.\n\ncircle_2\n\nCheck it out! Musical Lineup (http://www.Wakarusa.com/2005/musiclineup.asp) The String Cheese Incident, Govt Mule, North Mississippi All Stars, Little Feat...among others...hopefully they'll have DG courses again this year!\n\nslo\n\nDANG! How jeolous can one be; that's me!! :eek:\n\nI would think Wilco and Humprey's McGee [I think they're both SoCal(?)]worthy by themselves...and if Little Feat is anything CLOSE to their former selves [they rocked here in Kali, even w/o the late slidemaster, Lowell George]...WOW!\n\nAND disc?!? :p :p :p\n\nslo\n\nJust bought The Mooney Suzuki's Alive and Amplified. This album is a MUST BUY if you like your rock. Reminds me of when I first heard Lenny Kravitz, he sounded unlike anything out there at the time, but still, familiar and intoxicating. Really, really, really must get this one. Such a road trip album.\n\nI haven't seen the movie, but if you saw School of Rock, with Tenacious D's Jack Black [who was in a \"Married with Children\" episode, by the way]...that is also the Mooney Suzuki, albeit not Sammy James Junior on vocals.\n\ncwphish\n\nUmphrey's is a Chi-Town band SLO.\n\nslo\n\nI stand corrected!\n\nI glanced at the site, and the admissions seem more-than-reasonable for the # of bands playing. At least for the 21st century...the days of $4 to see the Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl are gone! ;)\n\nalice in chains played their first show in several years last night with SEVERAL guests, heres a good review i found online.\n\nWell the show kicked some MAJOR [*****]... no PJ sightings, but some great music, make that lots of GREAT music, and a few surprises.\n\nThe show started with a local band named REED (named after the singer). They are a 2 piece, Reed plays guitar and piano the other guy plays a stand up bass. They played a 30 minute set, very pleasant... a bit like Coldplay.\n\nNext was Children of the Revolution. Umm, they were good, just not my thing. A bunch of people that played world & upbeat music, they could get you dancing, but everyone was waiting for the heavy hitters if you know what I mean.\n\nThird, Sean Smith of Pigeonhead/Brad/Satchel. Sean played by himself and did a great job, man I love this guy's voice... Beautiful!!! He played 2 or 3 songs on the keyboard then finished with 2 cover songs... \"Crown of Thorns\" by Mother Love Bone (unreal)... and then Prince's \"Purple Rain\". He was a huge hit with the crowd!!!!\n\nUp next was the Supersuckers and Eddie Spaghetti, they tore threw a 30 minute or so set, very up beat and solid as usual. I myself not a big Supersuckers fan, but hey.... it's classic Seattle rock!!!\n\nThen, of course Alice In Chains... WOW. They came out with 5 acoustic guitars and Sean Kinney on drums. It was Jerry Cantrel, Mike Inez, Chris Degarmo (Queensryche), Sean Olsen, and another guy with long hair that plays with Jerry on his solo stuff... oh yeah and Pat Lacheman of Damage Plan singing Layne's vocals. First song was \"Killing Yourself\", a great one to get the crowd going... everyone was really just in awe. Then Ann Wilson of Heart came on stage and sang a great rendition of \"Brother\" with the guys. Then they played 4 more acoustic... forgive me but I am still in shock and can't remember the exact songs... it was just like MTV Unplugged, sound was excellent, the band was on... Just [*****] great!!!\n\nThey all leave and Ann Wilson comes back and is joined by her sister Nancy Wilson (a surprise)... they play two heart songs (again I don't know the names). Then they play \"the Battle of Evermore\" off the Singles soundtrack (the one they recorded as the LOVE MONGERS), this was GREAT!!! Then the rest of Heart gets on stage, including Jerry Cantrel. They tear threw 3 more Zepplin songs, including \"Misty Mountain Hills\" and eventually finish with the Heart classic... \"Baracuda\".\n\nTo cap the night Alice in Chains are back, they are plugged in and ready to ROCK. They play a song w/Pat Lachman, then bring on Wes Scanlin of Puddle of Mud for a duet w/Lachman on \"Down in a Hole\". Then its' Scanlin on Angry Chair and Would (I think... by the way, this Wes Scanlin guy was a total clown, he was drunk off his [*****] and [*****] up the lyrics to Would). Then the shock of the night, Scanlin leaves and the new guest singer... MAYNARD from TOOL/Perfect Circle. He sings the last 2 songs with the guys, does an absolutely amazing job (I think it was Man in the Box and Them Bones). Finally the night ends with the guys from Alice in Chains, Chris Degarmo of Queensryche, Scanlin, Lacheman, Maynard and Ann Wilson in a huge jam to ROOSTER!!! Even Crist Novaselic of Nirvana fame was helping Sean Kinney on the drums on this one...\n\nAll in all a UNBELIEVABLE night of music... Crist Novaselic was the master of ceremonies, dressed in a TUX and introducing the bands...\n\nAnd of course the best part, over $100,000 was raised for C.A.R.E. and the Tsunami Relief Fund!!!\n\nUmphrey's is a Chi-Town band SLO.\n\nUmphrey's McGee is also one of the best jambands out there right now!\n\nHave you seen the Live From the Lake Coast Skyline Stage DVD??? It's f-ing crazy! brendon Bayliss is such a good vocalist/guitar player, I think he's really underrated as a musician. And Cinninger can do just about anything on guitar!\n\nIf you haven't seen it, you should get it, it's a great show! :D\n\n<----jealous as hell of you.\n\n<----jealous as hell of you.\n\noh i didn't go to the show, i just found that review online and thought i'd share it. ;) :D\n\nslo\n\nThanks for the word up! Complete titles are useful!!\n\ncwphish\n\nPercy Hill, one of the best non-mainstream bands that only plays a few gigs a year (when they play together in a particular year), will be releasing another live album shortly. Those of you who live in New England should make an effort to go see these guys. Nate Wilson is perhaps the best keyboardist around, and if you happened to see him at the Jammy awards in 2000, you know why. He had Trey Anastasio, Phil Lesh, Warren Haynes, Stanton Moore, and a whole bunch of others mesmerized during the highlight after show jam. I sure miss not living in New England when it comes to seeing these guys and some other regional talent.\n\nHe had Trey Anastasio, Phil Lesh, Warren Haynes, Stanton Moore, and a whole bunch of others mesmerized during the highlight after show jam.\n\n[email protected], he must be good! If you can impress Trey, Lesh, Haynes, and Stanton, you gotta be good! :D\n\nThanks for the word up! Complete titles are useful!!\n\nYeah, if your an Umphrey fan, that dvd is a must have! It's comparable to the Live in Vegas show if you're a Phish fan... one of my all time favorites!\n\nListen to the JB's NOW!!!!!!\n\ni will do that immediately! :D\n\nslo\n\nListen to the JB's NOW!!!!!!\n\nSomeone [possibly NC_ZMan, I'm not going to, etc.] recommended them several pages above... DO YOU MEAN JAMES BROWN'S BAND?!? How about a title?!?\n\nslo\n\nAnybody heard of them, yet? I don't have any wheres or whens to report; I can't even describe WHAT it is, besides rock & roll...I can say I've listened to it about 8 times in the last two days: Kings of Leon's ï¿½ Youth and Young Manhood. Why? Because it's freaking great stuff, that's why. :p :p :p\n\ni've been wearing out Clutch's Blast Tyrant Album. its VARY VARY GOOD :D\n\nslo\n\nI see you recommended that back in Nov. [same album?], so I'll have to add that, and Slipknot#3 to 'the list'. Thanks _Paul_! :cool:\n\n'The List' is getting big/backloged!\n\n\"Meet the Bees\" also a pleasant surprise; catchy, and covering a wide territory of Pop/Rock with aplomb. ;)\n\nxterramatt\n\nKing of Leon - been listening to em on Sirius 26, Left of Center.\n\nThey are good. Other good Kings are Kings of Convenience.\n\nking crimson! :D\n\nking crimson! :D\n\nhttp://www.mindspring.com/~goheels/kfc.gif\n\nlol :D:)\n\nslo\n\nI'll give these guys the Slip. Couldn't make it past 30 seconds. No dealie. Just taste.\n\nGiving Young Heart Attack a listen now, because the guys in MS recommended them highly. :p Can you say, 'swagger'? Sure you can. ;)\n\nxterramatt\n\nAnyone going? If you are, can you fly me out there and buy me a ticket? It's like what Lollapalooza was in those first couple years, only magnified by 10.\n\nColdplay and NIN headline each night, and about 80 other bands. yes, 80 other bands. Lots of good ones too.\n\nIn Palm Springs, CA. April 30th-May 1st.\n\nhttp://www.coachella.com/\n\nslo\n\nSome big names, indeed!\n\nBright Eyes should interest a lot of Sophmore and youngers, who can't relate to and 'need' their own Mr. Zimmerman.\n\nNew Order, Gang of four from my college daze...wonder what they're like today?\n\nSecret Machines creating a lot of buzz; Gram Rabbit quite adept at the 'cosmic american music' thang...e.g. country rock.\n\nxterramatt\n\nDresden Dolls will rock. So will a host of others..\n\nMercury Rev **, the Raveonettes **, and Razorlight *** on Saturday\n\nBright Eyes ****, The Faint **, The Arcade Fire ****, Pinback **, The Dresden Dolls ***, The Fiery Furnaces **, Autolux **, Tegan and Sera ***, The Bravery ****, The Futureheads ***, Kasabian ****.\n\nSunday looks like it will seriously rock.\n\nFantomas are ones to look out for when it comes to \"excessive rocking\" :D\n\nslo\n\nAre those your ratings XT? Is Bright Eyes [Conner Oberst] 'the new Dylan'?!?\n\nThe Mooney Suzuki will be on a U.K. swing then...too bad. :( That would be a lot of exposure.\n\nxterramatt\n\nyeah, that's my ratings from what I've heard from/of them.\n\nMan, I woulda gave my left nut to see that show, WOW!!! :eek: :eek: :cool:\n\nAny 311 album\n\nAny Mudvayne album(get the DVD, WOW!)\n\nAny Led Zeppelin album(the new DVD has 5 hours of live concert footage that will blow you away!!) :cool\n\nAnything by DJ Mark Farina(mush"
