        "text": "When drug jokes became passé, the comedy team of Cheech and Chong were robbed of their source of humor. Their frowzy movies, which were very popular in the mid-1970s, attracted fewer and fewer fans.\n\nThey hit rock bottom with The Corsican Brothers, an attempt to skirt drug humor altogether. It stiffed, deservedly. Since then, except for a reasonably amusing joint cameo (no pun intended) in Martin Scorsese’s After Hours, they seem to have gone their separate ways.\n\nAnd now Cheech Marin has made his own film, Born in East L.A., which is spun off his song parody of a couple years back of Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the U.S.A. He’s not only the star, he’s also the writer and the director.\n\nNow, consider Cheech – he was the short, balding one with the heavy ethnicity. Knowing that this character is going to become a full-­fledged filmmaker does not fill one with high hopes.\n\nAnd, no, Born in East L.A. isn’t anything great. To a large extent, however – if you can forgive some ratty continuity and shorthand character development – much of this movie is not bad. At the very least, Marin displays much more humanity as a director than his erstwhile partner, Tommy Chong. Chong directed some of their team films, and his sensibility was always on the sketch­ comedy level.\n\nPerhaps Marin is inspired because his story has some serious undertones. He plays a working­-class Chicano-American from East L.A. who’s mistakenly picked up in a bust of illegal aliens and deported to Mexico. Stuck in Tijuana, he must plot with the migrants to get over the border.\n\nIt’s contrived, but there are funny scenes along the way. The humor is predictably earthy, but Marin broadens out into some sweetness and light, and despite a few lapses, the script does have some sense of shape and a feeling for running gags. And, again unlike Chong, Cheech has a naturally sympathetic screen presence, dogged and likable. Marin will never be the next Woody Allen, but this movie is certainly better than anyone could have expected of him.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, August 1987\n\nI don’t much care for the condescending tone in this review, but please understand that it comes from the idea of “guy who makes drug jokes as auteur” perspective. Marin, as director, had a warm personality and a certain oomph. To say nothing of the fact that this was a rather gutsy movie to make, as indeed it would be today. The cast includes Paul Rodriguez, Lupe Ontiveros, Daniel Stern, and Jan-Michael Vincent. It’s a shame that Marin did not direct again."
