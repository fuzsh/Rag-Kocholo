        "text": "Post by spiderwort on\n\nFirst Viewings:\n\nHope and Glory (1987):\n\nJohn Boorman’s masterwork, which he wrote, produced and directed. A semi-autobiographical story of life on the Homefront during the London Blitz, it concentrates on finding joy de vivre amidst the tragedies of the war. Great cast, wonderful performances. 5 Oscar nominations, including best picture, director, and screenplay. I was amazed at how good Boorman’s writing was. Highly recommended.\n\nFinding Neverland (2004):\n\nA beautiful, very moving film. Great performances from the wonderful cast, including the kids. 7 Oscar nominations, including best picture, actor, and screenplay. Highly recommended.\n\nMrs. Henderson Presents (2005):\n\nA delight from start to finish, with a wonderful, Oscar nominated performance by Judi Dench, who’s solidly matched by Bob Hoskins. He also produced the film, which is based upon a true story. A must-see for Dench fans.\n\nContagion (2011):\n\nA solid, very interesting well-done film that is extremely relevant to our experiences in the world today. One of its virtues is its restraint. No sensationalism; just the facts and their consequences. Great cast, dedicated to serving the story. Very informative, almost a blueprint for what the world has endured in the last two years. Recommended, especially under current circumstances.\n\nHondo (1953):\n\nI made it all the way through this one only because of Geraldine Page. It was her first film, for which she received her first Oscar nomination. The film is not without merit, of course, but it also has a lot of western cliches that took me out of the story. That said, I'm sure it would appeal to many of you.\n\nRe-watches:\n\nThe Night of the Shooting Stars (1982):\n\nOne of the most beautiful, heartbreaking and life-affirming films I’ve ever seen! Felt that way when I first saw it; still feel that way today. A haunting masterpiece, in my opinion. Highly recommended!!\n\nThe Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970):\n\nHaven’t seen this since it was first released, but I loved it then, and I love it even more now. An unusual blend of comedy, drama, and the wild west. And now that I’ve seen it again, I believe it’s Peckinpah’s best. (He reportedly thought so, too, but because it failed in theatres, he went back to adding violence to his films). Robards and Stella Stevens are wonderful together. It’s her career best performance in a role that captures her humanity more than her sex appeal (though, of course, she surely has that). Highly recommended, especially for Peckinpah fans.\n\nSweet Land (2005):\n\nThe story of a mail-order bride from Sweden struggling to make a home in a farming community in Minnesota after World War I. Wonderful cast, performances and direction by Ali Sim. Recommended for those interested in a quiet, meaningful drama.\n\nGrass: A Nation’s Battle for Life (1925):\n\nA fascinating early documentary about a nomadic Iranian tribe of 50,000 people and half a million animals on a harrowing trek across high mountainous country to reach the grasslands that will save their livestock — a journey they make every season. I love this film, made by Merian C. Cooper, Ernest B. Schoedsack, and Marguerite Harrison. Cooper and Schoedsack later when on to make the first King Kong (1933). It’s one of the first ethnographic documentaries, after Robert Flaherty’s Nanook of the North (1922), and it’s a wonderful cinematic journey.\n\nUn chien andalou (1929):\n\nA 16 minute seminal surrealistic film directed by Luis Bunuel, co-written with Salvador Dali. At times grotesque, horrific, even repulsive, it’s nevertheless a must-see for those interested in film history. That said, I don’t think I’ll ever watch it again. Free on Tubi TV.\n\nPost by Chalice_Of_Evil on\n\nRed Eye (2005).\n\nDo you wanna know how Lisa Reisert got this scar?\n\nSave for the beginning and ending, the majority of this film takes place aboard a plane (obviously). Thanks to Wes Craven's directing and the film's two main stars, the film is never boring, remains tense throughout and keeps the momentum going. Rachel McAdams proves that she can carry a film, establishing quickly her character of Lisa Reisert as a likable/capable/resourceful hotel manager who knows how to think quickly and deal with problem customers \"with special needs\" efficiently. It's a credit to McAdams that she makes Lisa so likable in such a short time, because we have to like her to feel for her during the predicament she finds herself in.\n\nShe soon meets a man by the eyebrow-raising name of Jackson Rippner (he of the pale blue eyes, Cillian Murphy). Murphy, who played an excellent villain in Batman Begins, but was only given a limited amount of screentime, is given much more here, relishing every minute. He starts off as a helpful, \"charming\" person who comes to Lisa's aid at the airport, but it's not long before she's crossed paths with him again on the plane and he makes his true intentions/motives known. He's a terrorist operative working for a group who wants one of Lisa's hotel guests, United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Charles O'Keefe, dead. Lisa's the only one who can get him moved into the right room to be assassinated, and if she doesn't do it, Jackson will have her father, Joe (Brian Cox), offed.\n\nThe plot isn't exactly one we haven't seen before (a parent in danger, the protagonist has to do what the antagonist says, or her father gets it, etc), but the way in which the story's told is what keeps the viewer glued to the screen. Lisa isn't the typical damsel in distress. She's smart/knows how to think on her feet and makes several clever/sneaky attempts to alert people to her predicament, but unfortunately for her, Jackson's no fool either, and just when you think Lisa might succeed, he foils her plans. The easy-going chemistry that's set up early on between the two actors, which then leads to extreme tension later on, is what holds the film together. If it weren't for McAdams and Murphy, I doubt the film would've been as effective as it was/could've easily fallen apart.\n\nIt's the little touches that make the film above average. Things you wouldn't have first thought were that important prove crucial later on, such as when Lisa comes up with a new inventive way of using a pen, for example. Her quick-thinking is what helps her last as long as she does (and keeps the audience from rolling their eyes, as she's not to typical sort who makes stupid mistakes. She's constantly figuring out ways to get out of her situation). What I really appreciated was how much of a match she is for Jackson. He obviously regards himself as 'superior', talking down to her and saying condescendingly, \"Lisa, whatever female-driven, emotion-based dilemma you may be dealing with right now, you have my sympathy. But for the sake of time and sanity, let's break this down into a little male-driven fact-based logic. One simple phone call saves your dad's life.\", but she's no pushover, giving as good as she gets.\n\nOne little detail I appreciated was how Jackson Rippner seemed to 'devolve' into his infamous serial killer whose name his sounds like. Bit by bit, Rippner takes on the vague appearance of what one might imagine when thinking of Jack the Ripper: he acquires a silk scarf (which he tucks into the top of his shirt like a cravat, so as not to attract so much attention...what with the slight throat issue he's got going on. And, no, it can't be simply fixed with some Soothers), a decidedly raspy voice (as a result of said throat problem - and yes, they do explain how it is he still manages to talk after Lisa introduces him to his new best friend who goes by the name Pen), a limp, and lastly...the trademark knife. I thought it was nifty how he slowly took on these aspects of his namesake.\n\nOnce off the plane, the film does appear to 'degenerate' into somewhat of a 'slasher' film (well, there's chasing and a knife involved, but a surprising lack of blood. If you wondering how there's no blood at one point towards the end of the film, there's a vague explanation. I just chose to go with it). Apart from one instance of the classic/obligatory 'run/trip over/fall' that plagues all slasher movie victims, it seems, Lisa manages to hold her own against Jackson once they reach her house (where he proves to be no match for all manner of flying objects being hurled his way. Yes, 'sometimes bad things happen to good people'...but sometimes they fight back! Where's your male-driven fact-based logic NOW, Jack?).\n\nAlthough Brian Cox isn't given much to do, he makes the most of his screentime and we care about Lisa's father/his relationship with his daughter. He also proves helpful near the end. Other side characters that populate the plane have their own little moments here and there. I also appreciated that time was devoted to us learning what led to Lisa's notable scar, which we're introduced to early on and Jackson makes an assumption about. McAdams gives a good speech about it, playing a part in Lisa's turning the tables on her tormentor.\n\nThe film has its moments of humour (thanks to Glee's Jayma Mays as Lisa's co-worker, Cynthia. The film's ending satisfyingly pays off the problems her character was having at the start regarding troublesome customers. Even Lisa has her limits, patience-wise), but mostly succeeds at what it's supposed to be: a thriller. It isn't a long movie, the film's premise isn't dragged out, and that's why it works so well/benefits from a short runtime. This is a sorely underrated/underappreciated film.\n\nP.S. I Love You (2007).\n\nTell It to the Bees (2018).\n\nThe Secret Garden (2020).\n\nPost by mikef6 on\n\nBabes In Arms / Busby Berkeley (1939). The granddaddy of the “Let’s Get The Gang Together And Put On A Show” sub-genre. A colony of ex-vaudevillians live on Long Island. Their kids, not entering upper teenage, all want a show business career for themselves. They have to prove to their parents – and to themselves – that they have the talent and drive needed. This is especially true with Mickey Moran (Mickey Rooney) who has already sold some songs, including “Good Morning,” which is also used in “Singing In The Rain” (1952). Mickey proposes they put on a show to convince everyone, including pinch faced Mrs. Steel (Margaret Hamilton) who wants to send the kids to a work farm to get a regular education. He writes a leading lady part for his girlfriend Patsy Barton (Judy Garland) but is in bind when former child star Rosalee Essex (a delightful June Preisser) offers to fund the show if she, not Patsy, gets the lead.\n\nThis is based on a 1937 Broadway musical with music by Richard Rodgers, lyrics by Lorenz Hart and a book co-written by the two. The movie retains only two numbers from the stage show although a third number, the standard “The Lady Is A Tramp,” is heard in the orchestral underscore as a motif for Rosalee.\n\nJudy Garland turned 17 during the shoot. Rooney was 18 yet both were bursting at the seams with talent. Not only singing and dancing skills, but also in dramatic performance, especially Rooney.\n\nThere is a blackface number but it is interrupted when a hurricane hits and rains out the outdoor production. Funniest scene: Rooney does Clark Gable and Lionel Barrymore impressions and, yes, it really is Mickey doing the voices.\n\nWestworld / Michael Crichton (1973). The plot of machines rebelling against humans is not new, but Michael Crichton’s original screenplay gives it a bright new twist. Two pals, Pete (Richard Benjamin) and John (James Brolin) are on their way to Westworld. There you can get into a gunfight and kill your opponent among other adventures. Of course, the opponent is a robot but one which bleeds and dies. An encounter with The Gunslinger (Yul Brynner) Is their first experience. But very slowly (at two-thirds of the runtime), things start to go wrong. The climax is a full-fledged robot rebellion with now unstoppable Gunslinger relentless in his pursuit of Pete. Brynner doesn’t have much to do or say until this final set piece (he took the part because of cash flow problems), but his performance as the implacable Gunslinger made me think of it as a model for “The Terminator” eleven years later.\n\nSen To Chihiro No Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) / Hayao Miyazaki (2001). In this masterful anime, 10-year-old Chihiro and her parents take a wrong turn which ends at what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. But it is a portal into the spirit world where her parents are turned into hogs and she finds herself trapped. At first panicky and frightened as a witch takes away her name and rebrands her “Sen,” she must learn to take care of herself and find courage to save herself and her mother and father. Basically, she grows up during her time in this other world. The visuals and imaginative storytelling are striking and not easily forgotten. A must-see.\n\nTuck Everlasting / Jay Russell (2002). Gentle fantasy from a 1975 YA novel by Natalie Babbitt. It may be too slow moving for its target audience but I enjoyed it. Set in 1914 America, Winifred “Winnie” Foster (Alexis Blidel), the willful and rebellious teen daughter of the town’s wealthiest family, runs away into the forest where she comes upon Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson) drinking from a spring at the base of a large tree. Kidnapped by Jesse’s older brother, Winnie, at first frightened, becomes almost one of the Tuck family until that family’s secret is revealed leaving her a choice that will determine the rest of her life. The Tuck parents are played by William Hurt and Sissy Spacek which was an attraction and motivation for me to see this movie. This film’s life lesson for teens (and everybody else) is a commonly expressed one, but it goes down easily and movingly in “Tuck Everlasting.”\n\nAnything Goes / Ross MacGibbon and Kathleen Marshall (2021). PBS Great Performances. This revival of Cole Porter’s 1934 musical premiered on Broadway in 2011 to acclaim and Tony and Drama Desk awards, Ten years later the production was revived again in London, once more with Tony Award winner Sutton Foster in the lead role, and garnered much of the same awards and nominations with the British theatre groups. The video that ran on PBS Great Performances was filmed live at the Barbican Theatre in London.\n\nShowgirl Reno Sweeney (Foster) and her chorus are booked on the S.S. American from New York to London as entertainers. Also on board is Billy Crocker who Reno is in love with (“I Get A Kick Out Of You”). But flat broke Billy is in love with heiress Hope Harcourt (“All Through The Night”) who is engaged to marry an English aristocrat but agrees to stay friends with Reno (“You’re The Top”). That’s not all. Moonface Martin, an old friend of Reno’s (“Friendship”) and Public Enemy #13, is also there in disguise. Complications and glorious music ensue. For all fans of live theater, especially musical theater.\n\nPost by teleadm on\n\nHere is the movies Tele have see lately...\n\nThe bar is free so just order what you like\n\nOver to the movies:\n\nDark Waters 2019 directed by Todd Haynes and based on The New York Times magazine article \"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare\".\n\nI kind of like these kind of movies based on real events. After watching it I'm glad I never bought things Teflon. Since the makers killed creeks and waterways, maybe causing cancer to many people and animals, before a desperate farmer walked into fancy law office.\n\nThe issues are still not solved, a million dollars can't never replace a beloved father or mother.\n\nSurprisingly good and interesting movie that I had never heard of before. Never bring Teflon into my house!\n\nAlpha 2018 directed by Albert Hughes\n\nPrehistoric tribes of the north, kills animals for a living. Think this is the American plateau since there is buffalo herds.\n\nA tribe son thought dead, survives and far from his tribe survives with a wolf he helped survive, creating a bond between man and wolf.\n\nI later learned they speak in a made-up language.\n\nWere I live there are no wolves no more, except in folklore.\n\nOne of the better boy and wolf stories I've seen lately.\n\nPolice Academy 1984 directed by Hugh Wilson.\n\nIt's Shakespeare compared to the sequels.\n\nI must admit I enjoyed rewatching this, it is what it is!\n\nCuba 1979 directed by Richard Lester.\n\nIt pictures in my mind that last chaotic days of Cuba before Castro took over, also seen in Godfather Part II.\n\nSean Connery arrives to Cuba as a mercenary to help the Batista ministry, but understands he came to late, and all he can do is soft a few things over if even that. While the rich and privilege still cares more about booking tennis courts than fleeing for their lives.\n\nIt has a game cast, Sean Connery is really good as the man who came to late, while the movie and storyline has a few too many flaws in itself.\n\nLa nuit américaine aka Day for Night 1973 directed by François Truffaut, Winning the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar 1974.\n\nPure and Simply a masterpiece! How chaotic is it to make even a few frames that finally ends up on the screen.\n\nKeeping big ego stars down, and after a long sequence that works and is perfect comes a damned kitten who don't like cream and destroys a take. Something referencing Truffaut's own experience in his own career in an earlier film.\n\nValentina Cortese in her only Oscar nominated role, asks director why can't we do it like in Italy, just say numbers \"19,12,56,42,11\" and record dialogue later, Not in France director tells her. forced to have a few que cards plasted here and there. (Something that happened to Truffaut himself during Close Encounters of the Third Kind)\n\nJean-Pierre Aumont in character tells a story about his time in Hollywood acting against a big star, going to a premiere, famous actress didn't remember anything, since all she rememberd was sitting and waiting hours in and hours out.\n\nLot's of wonderful hint's to other movies (Rue Jean Vigo)\n\nTunes of Glory 1960 directed by Ronald Neame and based on a novel by James Kennaway who also wrote the screenplay that he was Oscar nominated for.\n\nAlec Guinness and John Mills characters goes heads to heads in a battle of wits.\n\nScotland 1946, World War II was won, troupes with nothing to do is gonna do what? Restoring life to civilian times.\n\nI've read that this movie was great, and it certainly delivered.\n\nSusannah York was \"Introduced\" in this movie.\n\nBagpipe music and Whisky, that's how they spend their days\n\nA Double Life 1948 directed George Cukor\n\nMagnificent Oscar winning performance by Ronald Colman, playing both usual debonair and something way way darker, did it kill his career, since he only made 3 other movies after this.\n\nColman's ex-wife is played by Swedish actress Signe Hasso, she says a few lines in Swedish, she do them correct, it's not humla humla made up Swedish, it's the real deal.\n\nFamous Theatre actor who usually plays in Light comedies get's the chance to play Othello by Shakespeare, ex-wife hint's long runs makes him live his roles, that's why she's an ex-wife.\n\nAs Othello he kills a waitress, and he will eventually get caught\n\nLet this be Putin's Armageddon, just like Breshnev's badly planned Afghanistan invasion, but please stop killing innocent civilians!\n\nUkraine wasn't perfect, but it was a free democracy!\n\nСлава Україні!\n\nNext week, well it's new adventures in directions not decided yet...."
