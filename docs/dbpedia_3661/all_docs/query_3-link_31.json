'\n\nthe criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . .\n\nthe movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here .\n\nstupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's \" waking up in reno . \" go back to sleep .\n\nsomewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .\n\nthe action clichés just pile up .\n\npayami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .\n\nthe only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear .\n\nanother useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie .\n\ni didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived .\n\nplease , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film .\n\nmost of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved\n\n. . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee .\n\ncurling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary .\n\nthough the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .\n\nthere's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again .\n\nthe effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable .\n\nanalyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .\n\nwith flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins .\n\nstinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .\n\nto the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .\n\nequlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 .\n\nthe lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition .\n\neverything is off .\n\nwhen seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '\n\nan easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .\n\nimagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .\n\npc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .\n\nforget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?\n\nan odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .\n\nthough her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .\n\npascale bailly's rom-com provides amélie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest .\n\na static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .\n\nwatching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost .\n\n. . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .\n\nthe country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .\n\nthe cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end .\n\nthe characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .\n\nmattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .\n\nonly in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for .\n\nisn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it .\n\n. . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried .\n\nmaybe leblanc thought , \" hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . \"\n\nwhat you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height .\n\nbarry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time\n\nthe biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .\n\nso riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .\n\ni approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .\n\nearnest but heavy-handed .\n\nif sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over .\n\ntoo slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .\n\nthere's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . \" the adventures of pluto nash \" is a big time stinker .\n\na punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .\n\ntakes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny .\n\nthe things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers .\n\neven if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .\n\nsitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house .\n\nconfuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .\n\ndeadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .\n\nwith this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .\n\none can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off\n\na movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .\n\nsex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti\n\nthe script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .\n\na portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .\n\nthe code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .\n\nskip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd .\n\nfeels like a cold old man going through the motions .\n\ndignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ?\n\ndull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit\n\nthere's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .\n\nbeware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .\n\nhas its moments -- and almost as many subplots .\n\nthe gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .\n\ncompletely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .\n\nnarratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess .\n\nthere's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance .\n\ndirectors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .\n\nadam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt\n\nthere's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted .\n\ndespite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .\n\nit's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it .\n\nthe movie is a mess from start to finish .\n\nthe trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .\n\ni'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .\n\nin the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .\n\nthe plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times\n\nterminally brain dead production .\n\nsome episodes work , some don't .\n\nbeautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .\n\nj . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl .\n\nrymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .\n\nnot only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were .\n\nwow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .\n\noff the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all .\n\nit's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .\n\nwatching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence .\n\nit's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .\n\n'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '\n\nwill probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .\n\nthe problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .\n\nthere's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever .\n\nnone of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .\n\na processed comedy chop suey .\n\nas spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink .\n\nfails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix .\n\nfull of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .\n\nan erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .\n\nthe movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .\n\nwith its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .\n\nif you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .\n\nthe director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing .\n\neverything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify .\n\na dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .\n\nthe cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything .\n\nit comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .\n\nthe 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .\n\nso genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully .\n\neven in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .\n\nwhat with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .\n\none lousy movie .\n\nas gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .\n\nplodding , peevish and gimmicky .\n\nthe four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .\n\noozes condescension from every pore .\n\nsolaris \" is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .\n\nthe direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .\n\n. . . hypnotically dull .\n\nthough this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .\n\nit has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense .\n\nan awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .\n\nconfusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it .\n\n[h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by .\n\noccasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .\n\nit may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding\n\nby the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing .\n\njournalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .\n\nputting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .\n\nat its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford .\n\nexactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos .\n\ncalculated swill .\n\nthis movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .\n\nwith or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low .\n\ndirector oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .\n\nyou might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring .\n\nit's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .\n\nwalsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm .\n\nthis 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .\n\nit leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .\n\ni found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent .\n\none of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .\n\nthere's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .\n\nfear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique .\n\nthe skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .\n\nthoroughly awful .\n\n. . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 .\n\nthough the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .\n\njust too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .\n\nthe video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch .\n\ntruly terrible .\n\na cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .\n\nit gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .\n\nan achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .\n\nit's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too .\n\nrifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .\n\nfluffy and disposible .\n\nsuch a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .\n\nif you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is .\n\nholds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .\n\nthe dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .\n\na feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family .\n\nwhat you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .\n\nstealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .\n\nbigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .\n\nthere's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening .\n\nimagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar .\n\nsuffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands .\n\nwhat soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky .\n\nit's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long .\n\nthe film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) .\n\nsuch an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .\n\nwith the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better .\n\nthe whole affair is as predictable as can be .\n\na not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes .\n\nthis cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell .\n\na suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .\n\nstar trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .\n\n[n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness .\n\nevery potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol .\n\nputs on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .\n\nver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless .\n\ndespite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off\n\nalthough disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual .\n\ngaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story .\n\na sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .\n\n[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .\n\n'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '\n\ngooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .\n\nparker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core .\n\nthe director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving .\n\nbogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .\n\na lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .\n\nthe worst film of the year .\n\nby-the-numbers yarn .\n\nwithout shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish .\n\nif h . g . wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version , what would he say ? 'it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point . '\n\nduring the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' .\n\nbisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie .\n\nwatching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .\n\nthe most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland .\n\nthe film can depress you about life itself .\n\ni'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché .\n\nthe acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line .\n\nits weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .\n\nthe plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .\n\nsometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .\n\nat 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .\n\nhere's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line .\n\nan alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets .\n\nan ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .\n\nunfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .\n\nit wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty .\n\nglazed with a tawdry b-movie scum .\n\nthis is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .\n\nit winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say .\n\nall in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .\n\na big fat pain .\n\na mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 .\n\nunintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .\n\nwatching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures .\n\naan opportunity wasted .\n\nan inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .\n\nto build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .\n\nwith the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .\n\nmild , meandering teen flick .\n\nthough its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .\n\nthough this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before .\n\nalthough it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league

want to scream .\n\nthis is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .\n\nthis is amusing for about three minutes .\n\nklein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .\n\nit's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from \" promising \" to \" interesting \" to \" familiar \" before landing squarely on \" stupid \" .\n\nthis is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .\n\nthe direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .\n\nthere are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .\n\nit won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .\n\nlooks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .\n\ngiven too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is .\n\nthey kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book .\n\njust because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls .\n\n[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .\n\nit's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .\n\nthis dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .\n\nbrown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .\n\nthe boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements .\n\nthe script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .\n\nthe story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away .\n\noedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between .\n\nsince dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .\n\nonly those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate .\n\ncold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .\n\nevery now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie !\n\nit's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller .\n\n[a] soulless , stupid sequel . . .\n\n. . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers .\n\nthe trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun .\n\nwhat starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .\n\nin the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage's war-weary marine .\n\nit is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .\n\nreally does feel like a short stretched out to feature length .\n\nhampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .\n\ncheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace .\n\nand if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !\n\ndirected without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length .\n\nit's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere .\n\nthe movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality .\n\nan infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense .\n\nthe entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .\n\nthe setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying

and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .\n\nas pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile .\n\nwendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .\n\nbigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .\n\nthis film biggest problem ? no laughs .\n\nless-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan .\n\nthat the chuck norris \" grenade gag \" occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .\n\nviewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout .\n\nit's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental .\n\ni can't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine

what we can get on television for free .\n\na light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .\n\ncedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle .\n\nto paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .\n\nthe actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than

of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling .\n\nlabute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .\n\nthe notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .\n\nstale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb

, the rising place never quite justifies its own existence .\n\nparker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place .\n\nit's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill .\n\npaxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre .\n\nthe script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .\n\nthe

cliched to really work .\n\nlet's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate .\n\nit's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful .\n\nalternately frustrating and rewarding .\n\nit's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure .\n\ndespite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .\n\nswinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent .\n\nthe most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker

oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain .\n\ncox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy .\n\nto be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw .\n\ntaken as a whole , the tuxedo doesn't add up to a whole lot .\n\nas we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit . ' the filmmakers might want to look it up .\n\na frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .\n\nwhat's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .\n\ndrowning's too good for this sucker .\n\nan instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .\n\nfrankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . .\n\nlove liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit .\n\nthere are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel .\n\n. . . tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry .\n\nquite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .\n\nmy precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . .\n\nthe innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be .\n\ntoo campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work .\n\nhorrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists .\n\nshould have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such .\n\nit is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b . s . one another and put on a show in drag .\n\nconsider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire .\n\na boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .\n\nsheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading .\n\nheavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations .\n\nit is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .\n\nsnow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him\n\nwhole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .\n\nreggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .\n\nes triste tener que decirles que lo único grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la heather . . .\n\nends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would .\n\nthe film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .\n\ncharlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing .\n\nif the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special .\n\nparents beware ; this is downright movie penance .\n\n. . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .\n\nhas nothing good to speak abo"
