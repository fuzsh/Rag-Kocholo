        "text": "Embed from Getty Images\n\n(Pictured: the Village People onstage in the summer of 1979.)\n\nOn the weekend of July 7 and 8, 1979, American Top 40 counted down the Top 40 Hits of the Disco Era, covering big hits on the radio and in clubs over the preceding five years. It’s all killer and no filler. Seven songs from Saturday Night Fever are on the show: “How Deep Is Your Love,” “You Should Be Dancing,” “Stayin’ Alive,” and “Night Fever” by the Bee Gees, “Disco Inferno” by the Trammps, “A Fifth of Beethoven” by Walter Murphy, and Yvonne Elliman’s “If I Can’t Have You.” (The latter might be the best song on the show, if it’s not “Stayin’ Alive,” or “Miss You” by the Rolling Stones, which sounded great in this context.) As an individual performer, Donna Summer has the most songs on the show, five: “Love to Love You Baby,” “Last Dance,” “I Feel Love,” “Hot Stuff,” and “MacArthur Park.”\n\n“MacArthur Park” was Summer’s first Hot 100 #1, in the fall of 1978, but after the twin barrage of “Hot Stuff” and “Bad Girls” a few months later, you stopped hearing it much. “Bad Girls,” which is not on the list, would make #1 the week after this show aired and end up the longest-running #1 hit of Summer’s career—something the AT40 staff could not have predicted when they were researching, scripting, and recording in the spring and early summer.\n\nThe show is packed with informational factoids. At one point, Casey says that the popularity of disco means that everybody is doing it, referencing the forthcoming Ethel Merman Disco Album and a disco version of “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” by baseball announcer Harry Caray. (The latter is quite something. Harry sings, but he’s swamped by the female singers with him.) Elsewhere, Casey mentions that disco DJs like to play a slow song every 45 minutes to one hour, and lists the most popular slow-dance numbers: “How Deep Is Your Love,” “Three Times a Lady” by the Commodores, and “Reunited” by Peaches and Herb. All are heard as extras on the show.\n\nOther extras include “Rock the Boat” by the Hues Corporation, widely considered to be the first disco record to hit #1; “The Twist,” the most popular dance hit of all time; “The Hustle,” the most popular song named for a disco dance step; and “Disco Duck,” which Casey cites as an indication that disco is here to stay and more than just a fad. Also included: “San Francisco” by the Village People, which Casey says is the most successful record in clubs never to make AT40, because it was never released as a single.\n\nCasey offers quotes from record executives, journalists, and broadcasters discussing the disco phenomenon. Several of them suggest that disco’s popularity has a lot to do with people’s desire to escape economic and social hardships. Others portray it as a communal art form in which the audience is the star. He mentions a couple of different times that there are 20,000 discos in America, which seems like a lot. I suspect that number includes any small-town bar or Holiday Inn lounge that put up a disco ball or had a DJ rig. He name-checks a doctor who claims to be a practitioner of something called “discogenics,” which treats injuries people get from dancing. (There is a real thing called discogenic pain, which is caused by degenerating discs in the spine, regardless of whether the condition is caused by too much boogie-ing.)\n\nBut despite all of its undeniable bangers, the show has an odd vibe, and it’s because of Casey himself. It sounds like he’s not entirely present in the moment. He zips through his scripted lines in perfunctory fashion, like he’s trying to get the show done, just another item on a jam-packed To Do list. (What we know of Casey’s career as a voiceover talent by 1979 indicates that certainly could have been the case.) The show largely lacks the feeling of one-to-one communication that made Casey such a pleasant companion on the radio.\n\nAT40 compiled its list based on Billboard chart data and a survey of disco DJs across the country. The #1 song is “Le Freak” by Chic, which spent six non-consecutive weeks at #1 as 1978 turned to 1979. (Like “MacArthur Park,” “Le Freak” would soon be surpassed in importance within a few months by another of its own performer’s hits: “Good Times.”)\n\nWhen this show aired in the summer of ’79, the disco tide was already going out a bit after peaking in the spring. But as a snapshot of an all-consuming cultural moment, you can’t do better.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ja_bartlett/status/1552103121014308865\n\n(I knocked this piece off in about an hour this morning, which is not the way I usually write. If it seems half-baked, that’s why.)\n\nI’m not religious. As I think back on it, I’m not sure I ever was. I did all of the things you do when you grow up in a church, but it was largely because it was what was expected of me, rather than out of genuine commitment to what it meant. I prayed by myself at night from the time I was just a kid, and while I hoped I was being heard, I never knew for sure. In our mid-30s, Ann and I joined a church, and for a while we were very active in it. For the first time in my life, I felt like prayer was actually having concrete results. But it wasn’t long before the connection was terminated. I don’t know why it happened; it just did. And after doing a lot of reading and studying and thinking over the next couple of years, I decided that I was wrong about the connection. Ain’t nobody up there, not Yahweh or Allah or Zeus or Thor or any other supernatural being. When I thought I was talking to God, I was talking to myself.\n\nAccepting that was incredibly liberating. I had lived the first 40 years of my life with the internalized notion that I was being watched and judged, and the knowledge that I could not live up to the standard that I was being judged by. My mental health, such as it is over these last 20 years or so, is vastly improved by the belief—no, the knowledge—that I am responsible for my actions only to the people who are affected by them. Not some dude in a celestial palace, a guy I won’t meet until after I’m dead, and who laid down the rules thousands of years ago, when people couldn’t explain why it rained without recourse to magic.\n\nSome people will tell you that the human brain is wired for religion. I doubt it, if by religion they mean rituals involving holy books and black robes. If we’re wired for anything, it’s probably to crave connection. We don’t want to be alone. Also, we’re wired to find purpose. We don’t want to feel like rats in a maze, running around for no reason. This wiring is why we formed societies in the first place, when groups of people not related by blood decided to live together. You can call the connection and purpose religion if you want, although you don’t have to. It’s enough to want to be part of a group of people that shares something all find important, and which uses that important thing to animate the way they live.\n\nSome people go to church on Sunday to affirm that they are not alone, and to affirm their purpose for carrying on. Some of us find that affirmation elsewhere.\n\nLast night, Ann and I saw Mavis Staples and Bonnie Raitt in concert. Mavis, who is 83 years old now but performs like a much younger person, comes out of the gospel tradition, and every one of her songs had a religious bent—but not a sectarian one. Mavis’ religion does not tell you how to vote and who to hate. She said at one point, “I’m here to bring joy. I’m here to bring inspiration.” Her songs argued that we’re in this world together, and that while the road is sometimes hard and long, we must keep going forward, together. They were all infused with the hope that we might someday get to the place where love and brotherhood prevail, and even when the road is at its roughest, we must not lose our determination to walk it, together. Bonnie’s message, discussing her long years of activism and her fears and hopes in this moment, was less explicit, but not much different. Her music is the expression of a soul on the same journey that Mavis describes.\n\nToday, the religion of millions in America is a terrible, destructive force that diminishes our humanity and will, if undefeated, destroy our planet. The religion of Mavis Staples and Bonnie Raitt—a belief in the importance of human connection and common purpose that stands outside of ancient dogma and modern prejudice, driven by both the hope that we will achieve that connection and purpose and the determination to do so—is the only religion that will save us, the only one we need.\n\n(Watch this vintage TV ad for Panasonic’s Crazy Colors line of radios, which for some counterintuitive reason, was shot in sepia tones.)\n\nFifty years ago this weekend, if you lived in or near Madison, Wisconsin, as I did (and I do), it was a very good time to be shopping for music or something to play it on. The Wisconsin State Journal dated July 20, 1972, contains a full-page ad for the Prange-Way discount stores at East Towne and West Towne Malls. Prange-Way was having a “sale of savings” (as opposed to a sale of what other kind, I wonder) at which you could snag stuff you might still have today—or wish you did.\n\nThe major record labels were offering some top current titles for $2.99, including Elton John’s Honky Chateau, the debut album by America, Teaser and the Firecat by Cat Stevens, Jethro Tull’s Thick as a Brick, and School’s Out by Alice Cooper. Back-catalog stuff was also on sale: “All top artists and labels, Bobby Sherman, Neil Diamond and more, hundreds to choose from, all stereo” for $1.67 each. Still too pricey? “Assorted mono and stereo LPs with hundreds of selections to choose from,” only 77 cents. One line of albums was priced two for a dollar, and singles were three for a dollar. If vinyl was not your tech of choice, eight-tracks and cassettes were also on sale for just $1.99 each.\n\nNeed something to play your music on? A complete Lloyd’s system, “AM/FM/FM-PX 8-track stereo component system with changer and headphones, big speakers, wood cabinet with mar resistant vinyl, perfect for anyone who wants everything!”, was on sale for $129.92. Give yourself some extra credit if you know what FM-PX meant without having to look it up. It referred to multiplexed FM signals, or, in other words, stereo.\n\nDoes $129.92 seem like a lot of money for 1972? It was—it’s over $900 in 2022 dollars. So unless you had been saving up for a big purchase, you probably would have settled for something cheaper, like the Panasonic Toot-a-Loop Bracelet (“A radio you can wear like a bracelet! Big sound and comes in crazy colors!”) for $12.88, or the fabled Panasonic Ball and Chain for only $10.99.\n\nOn the list of the most 70s things ever, either of those would rank pretty high.\n\nSome of the cats and kittens who may have been tempted by these music buys at Prange-Way (three syllables: PRANG-ee-way) were probably disappointed to find that they had already earmarked their disposable income for something else that week: the Dane County Junior Fair, which was going on then, just as it’s going on this week. Although it doesn’t anymore, the fair booked some pretty serious rock acts back in the day; in 1972, the rock show scheduled for Saturday night, July 22, starred the James Gang with special guest REO Speedwagon for $3.50 in advance, $4.50 day of the show. Seems cheap to us now, but not so much when put into modern dollars—think of ’em as $24 in advance and $31 day of show.\n\nThe front page of the paper bannered headlines about peace talks in Paris between envoys from the United States and North Vietnam, and about a tornado that struck Lake Mills, Wisconsin, the day before. The Green Bay Packers had opened training camp, Muhammad Ali defeated somebody named Blue Lewis, and my beloved Chicago Cubs were in fourth place.\n\nI suspect that on the afternoon or evening of July 20, 1972, the 12-year-old me read the very newspaper I looked back at today. This I know: I’d have had the radio on that day—neither a Toot-a-Loop nor a Ball and Chain, alas—listening to “Lean on Me” and “Too Late to Turn Back Now” and “Outa-Space” and “Brandy” and “Rocket Man” and “Take It Easy” and everything else on WLS, over and over and over again.\n\n(This post is pretty much a straight-up repeat of one that appeared here on July 20, 2012., although I recalculated the currency conversions as you see them here. They’re all about one-third larger than they were in 2012.)\n\nThis website began on July 11, 2004, which means that as of today it’s old enough to vote. In keeping with ancient custom, here are some of my favorite posts since last July 11, in no particular order.\n\n—I spent some time on a recent afternoon at the radio station recreating the radio edit of the Isley Brothers’ 1975 hit “Fight the Power,” which bleeped the word “bullshit.” A couple of posts about naughty language in radio songs (here and here) were fun to write and got a lot of response from the readership, which I always appreciate.\n\n—I provided the usual yearly ration of philosophical navel-gazing: about the people we see in dreams, about how and when our narrow childhood perspective starts to widen, about long autumn mornings on the school bus and a Thanksgiving Day 50 years gone, and about what it would be like if we could remember everything.\n\n—I got annoyed with “people of my generation who mistake normal processes of growth and change for assaults on All We Hold Dear.”\n\n—In 1972, somebody thought it would be a good idea to invite Adolf Hitler to a Dean Martin roast, and hired Casey Kasem to play the part. That in turn inspired a closer look at Martin’s impact on the record charts.\n\n—I wrote tributes to Charlie Watts and Howard Hesseman.\n\n—I wrote about how doing a radio show is best thought of not as performing, but as making something. Alongside a firm belief in the service responsibility of the radio jock, it’s the rock I stand on these days. Every piece of a show must have a purpose, and the pieces should be consciously assembled, like building a bookshelf or a birdhouse. I’m not just spitballing to fill time anymore—the way I did for quite literally decades on the air.\n\n—Joy and Fear: The Beatles, Chicago, and the Sixties by John F. Lyons inspired a couple of posts. I wrote about differing perceptions of the Beatles among boys, girls, and Black listeners, and (yet again) how Chicago was the first American city to hear the Beatles on the radio.\n\n—Last December, I wrote about several Christmas warhorses celebrating 50th anniversaries: “Santa Claus and His Old Lady” by Cheech and Chong, “Happy Xmas (War Is Over)” by John and Yoko, and A Partridge Family Christmas Card.\n\n—This is not a television website but it does have a TV category and the analytics available to me show that people like my occasional TV posts. I wrote about a series of programs commissioned by the U.S. Treasury to plug savings bonds, which featured mini-episodes of Cheers, Taxi, WKRP in Cincinnati, and Benson. I also wrote about the locally produced entertainment shows that used to run on daytime TV, and about the shows that topped the Nielsen ratings in summer of 1977.\n\n—I also write The Sidepiece, a free e-mail newsletter you can subscribe to, which covers subjects not on-topic for this website. You can read about the likelihood that American voters will freely choose Hell this November, or about the sick and helpless feeling one gets watching the GOP do what it does while the Democrats stand feebly by and do nothing. The Sidepiece post archive is available to all, even non-subscribers.\n\nAlmost every year in this post I write about how much I abused the editorial “we” in it, which I notice I have not done this year. So, in closing:\n\nWe do not write quite as often here as we used to; working for The Man puts demands on our time that are different from what they were during the first 17 years of this blog’s existence, when our gig-economy lifestyle permitted us to spend entire days noodling with it. Nevertheless, our intention is to soldier on here whenever we can, for as long as we can. If you keep reading, we will keep being grateful to you.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n(Pictured: George and Louis Johnson didn’t make #1 in the summer of 1976, but those ‘fros were winners.)\n\nEverybody has a favorite summer, and regular readers of this pondwater know that the summer of 1976 is mine. The American Top 40 show from the week of July 10, 1976, which I listened to on that long-ago weekend, has got almost all of the music that matters from that summer.\n\n40. “I’d Really Love to See You Tonight”/England Dan and John Ford Coley\n\n39. “Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel”/Tavares\n\n37. “You’ll Never Find Another Love Like Mine”/Lou Rawls\n\nOn the current Billboard Hot 100, only four songs in the Top 30 have titles more than three words long. One of those is “Running Up That Hill” by Kate Bush, which is 37 years old, and two have unnecessary parentheticals that make them longer. There are probably algorithmic reasons for this, or maybe our attention spans just are shot.\n\n38. “Silver Star”/Four Seasons. I know I listened to this show when it first aired because I remember hearing “Silver Star” and liking it. This was the only week Casey ever played it. It was too ornate to go where “December 1963” and “Who Loves You” had gone, but it’s still a favorite of mine today.\n\n35. “Something He Can Feel”/Aretha Franklin\n\n34. “Good Vibrations”/Todd Rundgren\n\n33. “Somebody’s Gettin’ It”/Johnnie Taylor\n\n32. “Mamma Mia”/ABBA\n\nAT40 listeners back in the day found that there were always songs on the show they didn’t hear on their local stations regularly, and Casey even mentioned the phenomenon from time to time. If I heard “Mamma Mia” anywhere other than on AT40, it wasn’t frequent. Casey introduces it with the story of an Australian man named David Abba, who says he has been the butt of jokes and public harrassment since ABBA became a worldwide success. It’s a weird, context-free bit that sounds like it came from a press release issued by David Abba himself. “Somebody’s Gettin’ It” is fine, but it doesn’t strike me as the sort of thing likely to do big business among the same singles buyers who had made “Disco Lady” #1 earlier in the year. (Soul Train performance here.)\n\n29. “I Need to Be in Love”/Carpenters\n\n26. “I’m Easy”/Keith Carradine\n\n23. “Today’s the Day”/America\n\nRight now, there are a couple of big adult contemporary hits that are straight-up ass. One of them is by an extremely successful band banging out their customary humorless bombast, joined this time by a rapper who, paradoxically, makes their record sound even whiter than the rest of their stuff. (Seriously, there is not one atom of Elvis within a thousand miles of them.) The other is produced and performed in a way that suggests the band doesn’t even like music all that much. What is the precise nature of the pleasure listeners take from this kind of thing I do not know. You can’t fall in love to that shit, surely.\n\n17. “If You Know What I Mean”/Neil Diamond. I was tempted for a few minutes, instead of going through the effort of writing yet another post about the summer of 1976, to just copy out the lyrics to this.\n\n15. “Rock and Roll Music”/Beach Boys\n\n10. “Got to Get You Into My Life”/Beatles\n\nI love that these two bands rode into the Top 10 together during this summer. Casey says the Beatles have now made the Top 10 32 times, but they’re still behind the all-time leader, Elvis, who has 38 Top 10 hits. (As I count them, “Got to Get You Into My Life” was actually their 33rd; “Real Love” got to #6 in 1996 to make #34.) Madonna would eventually enter the chat and has 38 Top 10s; Drake recently surpassed everybody by hitting 40, but you know how I feel about that.\n\n8. “Love Is Alive”/Gary Wright. The sound of humid nights in a house without air conditioning.\n\n3. “I’ll Be Good to You”/Brothers Johnson. This was my favorite song of the moment, in the first of three straight weeks at #3.\n\n1. “Afternoon Delight”/Starland Vocal Band. As Casey introduces this at #1 he says, “I know what you’re saying, ‘I knew it all the time.'” Well, yeah, we did, Case, since you spoiled it earlier in the show by saying that the week’s new #1 song is “delightful.”\n\nIt was a different world in the summer of 1976, where you could get to #1 by sweetly harmonizing about a nooner. That world is where I came from. It’s a place I understand, and one that understands me. In this foreign land of 2022, like exiles everywhere, I want to go home. This show didn’t get me there, not really, but it allowed me the sensation of looking at some pictures of the place, which is at least something.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n(Pictured: ABBA, 1974.)\n\nJuly 4, 1974, was a Thursday. Americans are able to celebrate Independence Day as usual because a federal ban on consumer fireworks, announced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in May, was delayed last month. Americans enjoying holiday cookouts learn that the federal government has spent nearly a half-million dollars buying meat as part of a new program designed to help livestock producers struggling with depressed prices. Embattled President Nixon, facing an impeachment vote later this month, spends the day in Florida with his friend Bebe Rebozo. Last night, Nixon returned home after a lengthy diplomatic trip to the Middle East and the Soviet Union. Tonight, news reports reveal that during Nixon’s trip, doctors diagnosed a potentially fatal blood clot in the president’s leg, but Nixon rejected their advice to rest and continued his trip. Nixon’s phlebitis was reported in the media last week, but the blood clot is a new development. A new Gallup poll says that 72 percent of Americans favor the new 55MPH national speed limit, which Congress instituted earlier this year to save energy and lower highway fatalities. At Kendall Ford in Eugene, Oregon, you can get a new 1974 Mustang II with four-speed floor shift, whitewall tires, vinyl bucket seats, and woodgrain dash for $69.98 a month for 42 months, with trade-in. Interest rate on the loan amount is 12.75 percent. Seven major banks raised the prime interest rate to 12 percent yesterday. Real estate developer and former New York Yankees co-owner Del Webb dies at age 75. Future NFL player La’Roi Glover is born.\n\nNFL players are on strike over a number of issues including free agency. Veteran players have begun picketing training camps. David Pearson wins his third straight NASCAR Firecracker 400; Richard Petty finishes second for the fourth year in a row. The tightest race in baseball is in the American League East, where Boston takes over first place by one-half game with a 10-6 win over Baltimore while second-place Cleveland loses at Milwaukee 15-3. Mike Hegan hits two home runs for the Brewers and 19-year-old rookie shortstop Robin Yount goes 3-for-4. The women’s final at Wimbledon is tomorrow and the men’s on Saturday. On Sunday, the World Cup final matches West Germany against the Netherlands in Munich.\n\nOn TV tonight, NBC presents an episode of the summer replacement series Dean Martin’s Comedy World with Jackie Cooper, Barbara Feldon, Nipsey Russell, Freddie Prinze, and Rodney Dangerfield. Also on NBC tonight is an episode of Ironside plus Stars and Stripes, a special hosted by Tennessee Ernie Ford with appearances by Bob Hope, Dionne Warwick, and Miss America 1974, Rebecca King. ABC presents episodes of two half-hour adventure series, Firehouse and Chopper One, followed by Kung Fu and Streets of San Francisco. CBS airs The Waltons and a repeat of Applause, a made-for-TV adaptation of a Broadway musical based on the movie All About Eve. The film stars Lauren Bacall, Penny Fuller, Larry Hagman, and Robert Mandan. Between The Waltons and Applause, CBS airs the first of a series of Bicentennial Minutes, spotlighting important moments in history “200 years ago today.”\n\nAt WCFL in Chicago, “Sundown” by Gordon Lightfoot is #1 on the latest survey, dated June 29. “La Grange” by ZZ Top is #2, and last week’s #1, “Band on the Run” by Paul McCartney and Wings, is #3. New songs in the Top 10 are “Waterloo” by ABBA at #8 and “I’m the Leader of the Gang” by Brownsville Station at #10. The biggest mover is “Annie’s Song” by John Denver, up 11 spots to #17. “Rock Your Baby” by George McCrae is up to #24 from #33, and “Radar Love” by Golden Earring debuts at #30. The top five albums in Chicago are Band on the Run, Sundown, ZZ Top’s Tres Hombres, the soundtrack of The Sting, and Bachman-Turner Overdrive II.\n\nPerspective From the Present: July 4, 1974, was a warm and breezy day in southern Wisconsin, with high temperatures pushing 90. Holiday or not, there was probably hay to be made on the farm; if so, I spent the morning driving the hay rake, one of the rare farm jobs I did not dislike. That night, we probably blew off a few firecrackers and cherry bombs before or after the fireworks in town. Dad liked to put them under tin cans and blow the cans into the air. One year, our dog ran away to escape the noise, and it was days before he came home. It might have been 1974, or some other, earlier year. All those years are now very long ago.\n\nMy thanks to all who voted in the poll choosing which decade to write about today. A writer should know his audience, but clearly my audience knows its writer."
