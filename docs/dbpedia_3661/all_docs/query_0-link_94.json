        "text": "Rub√©n Funkahuatl Guevara is a Los Angeles native Chicano musician, singer, songwriter, poet, performance artist, activist, producer, short story author and historian. Famed for his beautiful singing voice and performances with Frank Zappa, Johnny Otis, Tina Turner, Celia Cruz and Bo Diddley, Guevara‚Äôs calling has always been ‚Äúas much a spiritual calling as it was political.‚Äù\n\nHis new book on UC Press, ‚ÄúConfessions of a Radical Chicano Doo-Wop Singer‚Äù explicates the roller coaster ride of his 50-year career. The nearly 350-page book not only covers his long and eventful life, it offers a primer to core concepts of Chicano history and a panoramic overview of the last 75 years of Los Angeles history. The mix of insightful anecdotes, trials, tribulations and some of his poems make for a multifaceted book that achieves multiple purposes. Ultimately, the vignettes and recollections demonstrate again and again how Guevara‚Äôs indomitable ‚Äúancestral spirit mixed with the need to reveal the untold history of social injustice,‚Äù to propel him into becoming what he calls ‚Äúa Chicano Culture Sculptor.‚Äù\n\nThe book‚Äôs introduction, ‚ÄúThe Fire and Flames of Funkahuatl,‚Äù is written by George Lipsitz and Josh Kun, two scholars who have been longtime advocates. Their eloquent exposition sets the stage for the unfolding of the fiery manuscript. ‚ÄúFollow the flames long enough,‚Äù they write ‚Äúand ‚ÄòConfessions of a Radical Chicano Doo-Wop Singer‚Äô leads you right into the heart of the Los Angeles that has been Guevara‚Äôs spiritual center, his tumultuous artistic stage, and his vibrant social laboratory.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI came into this world on fire,‚Äù Guevara writes in the Prologue. His uncle Xavier thought he looked too pale when he came home from the hospital, ‚Äúso he put me out in the sun to get some color. He never came back.‚Äù\n\nGuevara was only five days old and suffered second-degree burns on his face, arms and hands. Nonetheless, he somehow recovered thanks to the care of his great-aunt Victoria who gave him goat‚Äôs milk and indigenous herbs.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way my life started out,‚Äù he confesses ‚Äúand that‚Äôs pretty much the way it‚Äôs been: a steady series of burnings and a steady series of miracles that kept saving my mind, my face, and my life.‚Äù\n\nThroughout the book, again and again, a roller coaster pattern unfolds. One moment he‚Äôs recording a record with Frank Zappa, the next moment he‚Äôs struggling to make rent on a small apartment. Another moment he‚Äôs flying in a private plane with Cheech Marin, the next moment he‚Äôs living in his car. Somehow though, Guevara always pulls through.\n\n‚ÄúThrough leaps of good faith and good karma,‚Äù he states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve managed to dive off that cliff into the forging heat and pulse of the heartbeat, the crucible of the soul, and live to tell about it.‚Äù\n\nSinging Since Birth\n\nBorn into a musical family on both sides in Boyle Heights in 1942, Guevara lived much of his early childhood in La Veinte, a barrio in Santa Monica by Olympic and 20th Street.\n\n‚ÄúMy first five years living in La Veinte were formative for me musically,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúMy father taught me how to sing boleros and play the maracas. He taught me the song ‚ÄòAmor‚Äô (‚ÄòLove‚Äô), which would become my life mantra. I sang and played at family get-togethers and holidays.‚Äù\n\nHis mother‚Äôs brothers were also huge influences with their charisma and musicality. The apple did not fall far from the tree, and Guevara naturally inculcated all these qualities.\n\nThe narrative of the book unfolds, for the most part, chronologically and there‚Äôs never a dull moment. Over 25 of his poems are also in the text, usually included at the end of a prose section. The first poem of the book comes at the end of the ‚ÄúLa Veinte‚Äù section quoted above and it is a poem titled ‚ÄúThe Song of Life,‚Äù dedicated to his uncle Teodoro ‚ÄúLolo‚Äù Guti√©rrez. The first two lines are:\n\n‚ÄúMusic is the heart of the soul Its song is heard through rock and steel\"\n\nThe poem celebrates his uncle and Guevara even got a chance to read it to him shortly before his uncle died in 2004. The tone is reflective, appreciative and compassionate. Near the end of this lyrical ballad, Guevara exclaims:\n\nThe poem concludes with:\n\nThis first poem of the book gives direct insight into a guiding spirit of Guevara‚Äôs work. He continues to sing deeply the work of his ancestors and carries it on with the life force of the breath. The stories he shares from his formative years reveal this further and how his dynamic family shaped his character. He also discusses the several moves his family made early in his life from Santa Monica to Cathedral City to MidCity LA to Las Vegas to the San Fernando Valley.\n\nMost of these moves were because his father was a traveling studio musician that played everywhere from the Million Dollar Theatre to the Ambassador Hotel and Palm Springs nightclubs to Vegas lounges while befriending Anthony Quinn and Frank Sinatra, and possibly even having had affairs with Dolores del Rio and Maria Felix before he met Rub√©n‚Äôs mother. His parents divorced in his late teen years. By this time, Rub√©n was well on the way to starting his own musical career.\n\nHis first musical gig was playing the trumpet in the fifth grade, marching with the school band in a Palm Springs parade. This would be the only time his parents would ever see him perform together. Guevara had a double dose of creative talent because his mother began moonlighting as an actress after the divorce to make ends meet. She was as charismatic as his father and many thought she looked like Dolores Del Rio. As Guevara began playing in bands in high school and then while attending Los Angeles City College, he began actively gigging around town. His mother set up an audition for him in 1965 on ‚ÄúShindig!,‚Äù a popular national TV rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll variety show.\n\nGuevara nailed the audition and was selected for the program. They gave him the stage name, Jay P. Mobey. This was before his identity as a Chicano activist and looking back he says, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see it as a cultural misstep then. But I sure do now.‚Äù\n\nAt the time, he was excited to do the show because he was being offered a potentially recurring role and both Tina Turner and Bo Diddley were going to be appearing on the episode. Diddley‚Äôs song, ‚ÄúBo Diddley,‚Äù was one of the first records he had ever bought. He did a phenomenal job on the taping and even ended up sharing the stage for the closing finale with Bo and Tina and the backing musicians for the song, ‚ÄúCan Your Monkey Do the Dog?‚Äù His performance was so good that he was asked to be a series regular. Somehow though, the show‚Äôs format changed soon after and then was canceled before he had another chance. This experience taught him that ‚Äúin mainstream rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll, you‚Äôre a product, not a person.‚Äù\n\nThis moment would be the first of many roller coaster highs and lows for Guevara. Shortly before the show aired, he split up with his girlfriend ‚Äúfoolishly confident,‚Äù he recalls, ‚Äúthat I could get something going with Tina. Instead, I wound up living in my car broke and starving and had to get a job right away. Gotta eat, gotta work. I started working at Chicken Delight on Sunset and Fuller delivering chicken up and down the Strip and the Hollywood Hills.‚Äù\n\nLess than a month into the job, another driver asked, ‚ÄúHey, didn‚Äôt I see you on ‚ÄòShindig!‚Äô last month?‚Äù The driver asked him, ‚ÄúWell, what are you doing here?‚Äù All he could say was, ‚ÄúWhat does it look like, man? I‚Äôm delivering fuckin‚Äô chicken!‚Äù\n\nBecoming a Chicano Activist\n\nSoon enough though, he started another band and got back into the groove. During his 20s, Guevara continuously played music while working various jobs. He even had a few early marriages. In 1966, he was involved with the Sunset Strip Riots close to the legendary coffeehouse, Pandora‚Äôs Box. Local officials had imposed a 10 p.m. curfew and they tried to stop local youth from gathering on Sunset. The coffeehouse had been one of the nexuses of the Strip.\n\n‚ÄúWhat was important about the so-called riots,‚Äù Guevara explains, ‚Äúwas that it was the first time that predominantly white L.A. youths came together to protests police brutality. This was the beginning of my activism, and it reminded me of my commitment to music.‚Äù\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Guevara not only worked odd jobs and had a series of relationships, he started back in school at Los Angeles City College (LACC). This proved to be a transformative experience for several reasons.\n\n‚ÄúLACC opened up new cultural worlds for me,‚Äù he recalls, ‚Äúallowing me to journey into new creative experiences and possibilities, from gospel to modern music to experimental theater. I was slowly becoming an artist through exposure and osmosis.‚Äù\n\nAround the same time as LACC, Guevara‚Äôs younger sister was tragically killed in a car accident. Her death rocked him because she was, along with his grandmother, the nicest person he had ever known. He took a trip to the exact site of where her accident was and then walked into the woods right by the side of the road and built an altar of twigs, flowers and stones in her honor. He prayed and reminisced, remembering her as a little girl. ‚ÄúShe had the smile of a Buddha,‚Äù he writes.\n\n‚ÄúWith tears burning my eyes I cried out,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúrepeating as in a chant, ‚ÄòI love you, I love you, I love you,‚Äô over and over again. ‚ÄòIf there is a God, show your face now! Show me my sister, now! Baby, Baby!‚Äô I shouted repetitively as in a mantra. Then silence. Exhausted and still sobbing, I slowly looked up again, and suddenly she appeared. Her beautiful face and serene smile shone through the branches along with the sun‚Äôs rays. I fell to my knees still crying and thanked God, promising I would dedicate my life to educating and enlightening through art in her honor.‚Äù A fundamental shift within his heart and mind happened here and over the next two years, he excelled at LACC with the intention of art having a deeper purpose in his life‚Äôs work.\n\nIn the following year, 1971, Guevara wrote his first theatrical work, ‚ÄúWho Are the People?‚Äù The piece was an experimental protest musical theater. The showstopper of the play was ‚ÄúA Song for Sister,‚Äù a piece composed in honor of his deceased sister. The play was a resounding success and the Los Angeles Times wrote a glowing review. ‚ÄúWho Are the People?‚Äù opened up another portal and within the next year, Guevara found himself performing more theatrical rock, this time with Frank Zappa.\n\nMusical Theater with Frank Zappa\n\nShortly after the success of Guevara‚Äôs first musical, he ran into an old friend, the keyboardist Bob Harris on Fountain Street in Silver Lake. He told Harris about his musical and Harris got excited. He had just returned from touring with Zappa ‚Äúand he suggested we pay him a visit, since Frank and I both seemed to be on a rock theater kick.‚Äù They drove up to Zappa‚Äôs house in Laurel Canyon. Harris‚Äôs intuition to bring the two together made perfect sense.\n\nGuevara and Zappa were in synchronicity on so many levels. In addition to their mutual love of rock theater, a few years earlier, Zappa had also made a record, ‚ÄúCruising With Ruben & the Jets‚Äù, that was a garage doo-wop band paying homage to the Chicano doo-wop scene. Talk about divine providence, Guevara was a Chicano doo-wop singer named Rub√©n, he was the real thing. Moreover, Guevara had briefly met Zappa a few years before and had told him he was a doo-wop singer and that his name was Rub√©n. Zappa had told him back then to get in touch, but Guevara never did.\n\nThis time, though they connected, and the rest is history. Zappa answered the door when they came and right off the bat they started talking earnestly. They ended up staying up all night listening to Zappa‚Äôs collection of rhythm and blues oldies.\n\n‚ÄúHere we were,‚Äù Guevara remembers, ‚Äúa couple of grown men tripping on old records like we were teenagers. That was the beginning of our bond: our love of L.A. rhythm and blues.‚Äù\n\nAs the sun was coming up that morning, Zappa made Guevara a proposal: ‚ÄúHow would you like to stage a real Ruben & the Jets? I‚Äôll produce the album, and you can tour with the Mothers as an opening band to promote it?‚Äù\n\nTo distinguish Zappa‚Äôs version of the band name from his, Guevara decided to have his group go by, Ruben And the Jets. Beginning in 1972, they made two records and toured together. There were some difficulties along the way, but there was never any bad blood between Guevara and Zappa. The first record, ‚ÄúFor Real!,‚Äù was produced by Zappa, and the second album, ‚ÄúCon Safos‚Äù, was produced by Denny Randell.\n\nThey toured the West Coast and shared stages with not only Zappa but Three Dog Night, Tower of Power, Azteca and Cheech and Chong. The albums were well-received and the shows well-reviewed, but Guevara never made enough money off the band to save anything and internal difficulties within the players broke the group apart right after the second record.\n\nA combination of acrimony and jealousy broke up the band, but Guevara has no regrets. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt completely succeed at creating the rock-theater idea,‚Äù Guevara states. ‚ÄúBut instead, the Jets, Frank, and I created two damn good albums. We rocked the fuck out of many shows, getting encores where new opening bands never did. Not bad for a band only two years old. And yeah, goddammit, it was glorious rock ‚Äôn‚Äô fuckin‚Äô roll theater, after all.‚Äù\n\nFollowing the break up of the band, Guevara was back to sleeping in his Volkswagen station wagon and he got a job working in a wholesale record distributor on Pico by Vermont. ‚ÄúThe day gig brought me back down to earth real fast,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúIt was hilarious and humbling at the same time, pulling ‚ÄúFor Real!‚Äù and ‚ÄúCon Safos‚Äù off the shelves for the various record store orders.‚Äù While working for the record distributor, Guevara got another idea for a rock-theater piece. He enrolled in a Chicano Studies class at LACC and after getting inspired by the history of pre-Columbian Mexico, he decided to take a pilgrimage to the land of his ancestors.\n\nGuevara‚Äôs Pilgrimage to Mexico\n\nWhile in Guadalajara, Guevara had an encounter on a street corner with a Mexican man in a tailored suit that he will never forget. After a brief exchange, the man asked him in Spanish where he was from. When Guevara answered Los Angeles, the man said in Spanish, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre one of those pochos from the United States.‚Äù Pocho is a term for Mexican Americans who drop their Mexican identity and culture. When Guevara said to the man that he was Chicano, the man said, ‚ÄúWorse. Chicanos don‚Äôt have culture. They are mongrels.‚Äù He could not believe what he heard and for the moment he was speechless.\n\nDespite this encounter, he continued his trip deeper into Mexico. He eventually made it to Palenque and to the legendary, Temple of the Inscriptions. Climbing the steps of the sacred temple, Guevara thought a lot about his own identity. With each step, he realized he was not American in the WASP sense, and he was only Mexican ancestrally. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck am I then?‚Äù he asked himself. The internal dialogue echoed around his head as he walked up the steps.\n\n‚ÄúSuddenly I remembered,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúa line from my Chicano Studies class: ‚ÄòChicano is not an ethnic term; it‚Äôs a political term---a Mexican American activist dedicated to defending the rights of his people.‚Äô Chicanos are made, not born. It‚Äôs a choice. So a Chicano artist is someone who creates work that celebrates, contributes to, and helps shape the culture. Hmm, helps shape the culture. Kinda like a sculptor. Yeah, that‚Äôs it! I‚Äôll become a Chicano culture sculptor.‚Äù\n\nThis moment was another huge epiphany in his life. He reached the top of the temple steps remembering his commitment to his sister.\n\n‚ÄúAs I raised my arms to the sun,‚Äù he recalls, ‚ÄúI roared my newfound cultural manifesto across the jungle, tears streaming down my burnt face: ‚ÄòI am a Chicano! A radical Chicano culture sculptor!‚Äô‚Äù\n\nHe was empowered by this experience and he continued traveling around Mexico exploring both Aztec and Mayan ruins. While in Mexico he read about a revolutionary school teacher who was assassinated by the Mexican army and this further galvanized him ‚Äúto become a revolutionary Chicano artist-teacher.‚Äù\n\nCon Safos\n\nThis declaration was the inspiration for his first piece of Chicano sculpture. Titled ‚ÄúC/S‚Äù, the piece he explains, is ‚Äúa song-poem written for my beloved City of Angels and its twisted history with Mexican Americans and Japanese Americans, which I based on Carey McWilliams‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúNorth from Mexico,‚Äù a cherished text from my Chicano Studies class. The title comes from the abbreviation for ‚ÄúCon Safos,‚Äù a recurring theme in my work that has evolved into a symbol of my Chicano commitment, identity and self-determination.‚Äù ‚ÄúC/S‚Äù is often seen underneath Chicano graffiti tags to represent the spirit the tag was made in.\n\n‚ÄúC/S‚Äù became an important piece in his repertoire and live performances. Delivered in a spoken word style ala Gil Scott-Heron, the piece‚Äôs mix of Los Angeles history and Chicano identity foreshadowed the rest of Guevara‚Äôs career as an artist-activist. The piece is groundbreaking in many ways. Written over 40 years ago, it foreshadowed the activist spoken-word poetry that came to rise in the early 2000s and it also corroborated with the self-determination that defined the Black Arts Movement.\n\nTo explain further, Guevara writes in the book that ‚ÄúCon Safos‚Äù is ‚Äúa broad Chicano/Mexican American activist street term with various meanings, including a form of self-affirmation, self-determination, exempt from danger, and ‚Äòfuck you if you don‚Äôt like it‚Äô and so be it.‚Äù The concept of ‚ÄúCon Safos‚Äù is something close to Guevara‚Äôs heart and an idea that Frank Zappa liked so much he used the term to name Ruben And the Jets‚Äô second album.\n\nFrom this point on, Guevara‚Äôs music was written from a more political perspective. Shortly, after ‚ÄúC/S‚Äù, Rhino Records commissioned him to record a doo-wop spoof of ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmerica the Beautiful.‚Äù\n\nReflecting on this one-off production, Guevara states, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt make a dime on that record at the time, but years later I collected royalties when it was re-released in the Rhino Records ‚ÄúDoo-Wop‚Äù box set. In the end, I made more from that single than from both Ruben And the Jets albums combined.‚Äù This record also ended up helping Guevara land a role in Cheech and Chong‚Äôs first film, ‚ÄúUp in Smoke.‚Äù A decade later, Guevara also appeared in ‚ÄúBorn in East L.A.‚Äù\n\nPunk Rock and Performance Art\n\nPunk rock was emerging during the late-1970s and Guevara was inspired by the artists‚Äô commitment to social justice. Around this time, he saw a solo performance by Spalding Gray at the Ford Amphitheatre.\n\n‚ÄúIt completely changed my approach to theater and performing. It was just Mr. Gray sitting at a table on an otherwise empty stage‚Ä¶ It was all about the story, just straight-up storytelling, and I was impressed and inspired. It was anti-traditional theater and the beginning of what would be called performance art/poetry, then spoken word. I thought, hell, I can do that.‚Äù\n\nThough Guevara had been writing songs from very early on, he really began writing longer poems and extended essays from the mid-1970s on. Watching Gray‚Äôs performance art/spoken word show inspired him to stretch out with his writing.\n\nThe combination of his sister‚Äôs memory, the pilgrimage to Mexico and his newfound understanding of performance art grounded his work and gave a platform for the rest of his career.\n\n‚ÄúPerformance art,‚Äù he offers, ‚Äúhad a redeeming way of mixing spiritual ceremony with personal and cultural history, allowing me to relive it and momentarily be back in it ‚Äî precisely in the moment. It became my spiritual practice and medicine.‚Äù\n\nFollowing ‚ÄúC/S‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner,‚Äù he wrote several other spoken word pieces, such as ‚ÄúFrom the Heart of America: The Corner of Brooklyn & Soto‚Äù and ‚ÄúYangna.‚Äù As the years have gone on, Guevara performed these pieces around Los Angeles in venues like the Getty Museum and also in Tijuana, San Francisco, Washington D.C. and several cities in France.\n\nHe has also recorded several albums and has curated a few influential compilation records.\n\nThe compilation album, ‚ÄúMexam√©rica‚Äù ‚Äúwas an attempt,‚Äù Guevara tells me, ‚Äúto bridge Mexican musicians/bands/journalists/graphic artists and collaborate with L.A. Chicano visual and graphic artists/musicians/bands/journalists in an act of transnational solidarity.‚Äù\n\nAnother record he assembled, ‚ÄúReconquista! The Latin Rock Invasion,‚Äù was an attempt to spotlight global Alternative Latin Rock/roc en espa√±ol with material that focused on social injustice/commentary.‚Äù Guevara has always built bridges across communities. The book also spotlights his close connection to the Japanese-American community.\n\nFinally, ‚ÄúConfessions of a Radical Chicano Doo-Wop Singer‚Äù includes a lot of short vignettes about his ex-wives and the many different girlfriends he‚Äôs had over the years. He also has some poems in honor of his two sons and daughter. In the interest of not revealing the entire book‚Äôs narrative, there are many other equally compelling anecdotes and poems within the rest of the book. There is hardly an artistic or cultural movement from the last 50 years that Guevara has not participated in.\n\nStill Jamming After All These Years\n\nTo this day, Guevara is still jamming. I saw him read a captivating set of poems from the book at the Vincent Price Art Museum at East Los Angeles College in early July 2018. He‚Äôs finishing a book of short stories and he was also just awarded an Eastside Arts Initiative grant to adapt one of his short stories, \"Masao & The Bronze Nightingale,\" to the stage at the Boyle Heights theater Casa 0101 on East First Street.\n\n‚ÄúConfessions of a Radical Chicano Doo-Wop Singer‚Äù is a powerful memoir that reveals the depth of spirit it takes to be a lifelong artist. In the prologue, Guevara writes: ‚ÄúMy life has never been about playing it safe in the cool shade anyway or about becoming rich and famous. It‚Äôs been about making music and making love, rockin‚Äô and rollin‚Äô with the punches, and letting life keep the beat.‚Äù Above all, the book reveals Guevara to be a pioneering and uncompromising artist that has paved the way for today‚Äôs artists and activists. All hail Rub√©n Funkahuatl Guevara, the Chicano culture sculptor, still sculpting after all these years."
