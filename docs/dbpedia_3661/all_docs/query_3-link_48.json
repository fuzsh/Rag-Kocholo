        "text": "Imelda Staunton is an English actress and singer from Archway, London. Her ancestry is primarily Irish. She has worked extensively in theater, and has won 4 Laurence Olivier Awards; 3 for leading roles and one for a supporting role. Her best known role in films has been the recurring villain Dolores Umbridge in the fantasy films \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" (2007) and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1\" (2010). Her character was depicted as an authoritarian bureaucrat from the Ministry of Magic who was appointed as the new professor of \"Defence Against the Dark Arts\". The character was driven by both her political agendas and her own prejudice. In television, Staunton's best-known role was portraying Queen Elizabeth II in the 5th season of the historical drama series \"The Crown\" (2016-). The season fictionalized the events of Elizabeth's reign from 1991 to 1997.\n\nIn 1956, Staunton was born in Archway, an area in the London Borough of Islington. Archway has had a large Irish community since the 1830s, when Irish workers from this area were employed in the construction of railways and roads. Staunton's parents were the laborer Joseph Staunton and his wife, the hairdresser and musician Bridie McNicholas. Both parents were first-generation immigrants from County Mayo, Ireland. Bridie played both the accordion and the fiddle in Irish show-bands.\n\nStaunton received her secondary education at the La Sainte Union Catholic School, a girls' school operated by the Holy Union Sisters. She was trained in drama and elocution, and practiced her new skills by starring in school plays. Encouraged by one of her teachers, Staunton applied to several drama schools. In 1974, Staunton was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). She was reportedly rejected by both the \"Central School of Speech and Drama\" and the \"Guildhall School of Music and Drama\", so her options were rather limited.\n\nStaunton graduated from RADA in 1976. For the next 6 years, Staunton primarily acted in English repertory theater. She portrayed the French military leader Joan of Arc (c. 1412-1431) in a 1979 revival of the play \"Saint Joan\" (1923) by George Bernard Shaw. In 1982, she started acting for the Royal National Theatre in London. In her first year there, Staunton was nominated for both the \"Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical\" and the \"Laurence Olivier Award for Best Newcomer in a Play\". Staunton lost the Best Actress Award to Julia McKenzie, and the Newcomer Award to Kenneth Branagh.\n\nStaunton made her film debut in the historical drama \"Comrades\" (1986). The film dramatized the lives of the Tolpuddle Martyrs, a group of British labor activists who were convicted in 1834 under an obscure act and sentenced to penal transportation to Australia. The group members were pardoned in 1836 after mass protests in their favor, and they became heroes for the early union and workers' rights movements.\n\nAmong Staunton's most notable theatrical roles in the 1980s was portraying Dorothy Gale in a British version of the musical \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1987) by John Kane. It was a theatrical adaptation of the novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" (1900) by L. Frank Baum. The theatrical production was by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Staunton was nominated for the 1988 \"Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical\" for this role, but lost to Patricia Routledge.\n\nStaunton had a co-staring role in the comedy film \"Peter's Friends\" (1992), her first film role since 1986. In the film, Peter (played by Stephen Fry) is the new owner of his family's country house, and invites the former members of his student comedy troupe to a reunion there. Each of the members has had a dysfunctional life, but Peter eventually informs them that he has a worse fate than his friends. He reveals that he is HIV-positive, and that the real reasons for the reunion were the fears for his mortality. The film was nominated for the 1993 \"Goya Award for Best European Film\", but lost to \"Three Colors: Blue\".\n\nStaunton portrayed the waiting gentlewoman Margaret in thee romantic comedy \"Much Ado About Nothing\" (1993), a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same name. In the film, Margaret is mistaken for her charge, Hero (played by Kate Beckinsale). Staunton had her first notable animated roles in the fantasy film \"The Snow Queen\" (1995), an adaptation of the 1844 fairy tale Hans Christian Andersen. She portrayed both the sentient bird Ivy and Angorra, the self-centered daughter of the Robber King.\n\nStaunton portrayed the witty servant Maria in the romantic comedy \"Twelfth Night\" (1996), an adaptation of William Shakespeare's play. Maria was one of several characters who humiliated the pompous steward Malvolio (played by Nigel Hawthorne), and orchestrated his downfall. Staunton had two new roles in the sequel animated film \"The Snow Queen's Revenge\" (1996). She voiced both the optimistic servant Elsbeth and the ambitious bounty hunter Rowena.\n\nStaunton voiced the group cynic Bunty in the stop-motion animated comedy film \"Chicken Run\" (2000). It was the first feature-length film by the animation studio Aardman Animations, and grossed about 224.8 million dollars at the worldwide box office. The film broke a record as the highest-grossing stop-motion film in film history. It has retained this record into the 2020s. This was one of Staunton's most commercially successful films.\n\nStaunton portrayed the malevolent wife Conchita Flynn in the comedy film \"Rat\" (2000), loosely based on the novella \"The Metamorphosis\" (1915) by Franz Kafka. In the film, a normal working-class man inexplicably shape-shifts into a rat. His family both turns against him, and tries to profit from his condition. Staunton portrayed the supporting character of police superintendent Janine in the romantic comedy film \"Crush\" (2001). In the film, middle-aged schoolmistress Kate Scales (played by Andie MacDowell) starts dating a man in his twenties, who was once her student. Janine and another of Kate's friends try to figure out whether the man genuinely loves Kate, or is simply manipulating her. When the man is killed in a traffic accident, the two friends try to help a pregnant Kate with some serious life decisions.\n\nStaunton portrayed the main character Vera Drake in the period drama \"Vera Drake\" (2004). In the film, Vera is a middle-aged house cleaner who provides illegal abortions for young women during the early 1950s.

Staunton won the \"BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role\" for this role, and was nominated for the \"Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama\".

The film was set entirely in Bucharest, Romania, though it was based on a script intended for a period film about post-World War II Japan.\n\nStaunton next portrayed Dolores Umbridge in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" (2007). Staunton's performance was praised by critics, and she was nominated in the \"British Actress in a Supporting Role\" category at the London Film Critics Circle Awards. Dolores as a character has been praised as one of the better villains from the \"Harry Potter\" series, because her brand of \"authoritarian evil\" was reportedly more relatable than Lord Voldemort and his abstract plans. Staunton herself claimed that her performance as Dolores was inspired primarily by her views on the behavior of the controversial Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013, term 1979-1990).\n\nStaunton portrayed motel owner Sonia Teichberg in the comedy-drama film \"Taking Woodstock\" (2009). In the film, the motel of the Teichberg family is about to be foreclosed by their bank, and their young son is desperate to raise enough money to save the family business.

In the film, a skeptic writer investigates ghost sightings at a boarding school in Cumbria during the early 1920s. She realized belatedly that the boarding house's building used to be her family's residence during her childhood, that the ghost in question was her murdered half-brother, and that Maud used to be her father's mistress. Maud had invited her there in order to kill her and to turn her into the building's newest ghost. The film was praised by critics as an atmospheric, ghost story, though its resolution was thought to be predictable.\n\nStaunton voiced Margaret Claus in the Christmas animated film \"Arthur Christmas\" (2011). In the film, a family has used the hereditary title of \"Santa Claus\" for many generations, and the current Santa (Malcolm) is the 20th one. When a child's present is accidentally lost, Malcolm is indifferent to the situation, and Steven (his cynical eldest son and business-manager) considers this to be an acceptable error. But his idealistic younger son Arthur sets out to personally deliver the present, using an outdated wooden sleigh that had been out of use for nearly a century. As the inexperienced gift-bringer tries to complete his mission, Malcolm tries to hide the situation from his wife Margaret while starting to realize that he was never suited for a leadership position. The film earned 147,4 million at the worldwide box office.

The activists organized fund-raising efforts to help the impoverished miners and their families. Staunton was nominated for the \"BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role\" for this role, but lost to Patricia Arquette.\n\nStaunton portrayed the protective pixie Knotgrass in the fantasy film \"Maleficent\" (2014). Her character was based on the fairy Flora from the animated film \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959), but Knotgrass was intentionally depicted as an inept counterpart to the original character. Knotgrass is one of the legal guardians of the human girl Aurora (played by Elle Fanning), but turns out to be a neglectful parent figure. The film grossed over 758 million dollars at the worldwide box-office, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2014.

Maud schemed to allow her property to be inherited by her own illegitimate daughter, rather than by her cousin and his heirs. The Crawley family starts scheming an advantageous marriage of their widowed son-in-law Tom Branson to Maud's heiress.

She made her screen debut in the slasher film Düstere Legenden 3 (2005), went on to have a supporting role in the independent coming-of-age drama Die Mädchen von Tanner Hall (2009), and has since starred in the horror remake A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010), the biographical drama The Social Network (2010), the thriller remake Verblendung (2011), and the romantic drama Carol (2015).\n\nPatricia Rooney Mara is one of four children of Kathleen McNulty (née Rooney) and NFL football team New York Giants executive Timothy Christopher Mara. Her grandfathers were Wellington Mara, co-owner of the Giants, and Timothy Rooney, owner of Yonkers Raceway, and her grand-uncle is Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, the former Ambassador to Ireland. She is the great-granddaughter of Art Rooney, the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers football franchise. Her father has Irish, German, and French-Canadian ancestry, and her mother is of Irish and Italian descent.\n\nAfter graduating from Bedford's Fox Lane High School, she went to Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia in South America for four months as part of the Traveling School, an open learning environment. She attended George Washington University for a year and then transferred to New York University, where she studied international social policy psychology and nonprofits. She took her degree from New York University in 2010. Her studies focused on non-profit organizations, as her family has a tradition of involvement in philanthropic causes.\n\nShe had thought of acting after watching old movies and attending musical theater, but did not think of it as a serious vocation and was afraid she might fail at this. As a result of her reservations, she appeared in only one play while in high school.\n\nShe began seriously focusing on acting when she was at New York University, appearing in student films. Inspired by her older sister, actress Kate Mara, she began to pursue the craft, auditioning for acting jobs at age 19. She appeared with her sister Kate in the video horror movie Düstere Legenden 3 (2005), billing herself as \"Patricia Mara\".

Furstenberg was delighted with her nuanced performance, saying, \"Still waters run deep\".\n\nContinuing to call herself Tricia Mara, this was during the making of \"Tanner Hall\" that she considered changing her professional name to Rooney Mara, soliciting the advice of the cast and crew. After premiering at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, her performance in \"Tanner Hall\" brought the rechristened Rooney Mara a \"Rising Star\" award at the 2009 Hamptons Film Festival and a \"Stargazer Award\" at the 2010 Gen Art Film Festival.\n\nShe received her first lead role in a major feature, in the $35 million remake A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010). The movie proved disappointing at the box office, grossing only $63 million domestically and racking up a worldwide gross of just under $116 million. However, she was noticed by critics in the small but pivotal role of the Boston University undergrad Erica Albright who dumps Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network (2010). Director David Fincher subsequently cast her as the lead, Lisbeth Salander, in his thriller remake, Verblendung (2011), based on Stieg Larsson's Millennium book series. She received critical acclaim for her performance, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama.\n\nShe starred in the thriller film Side Effects - Tödliche Nebenwirkungen (2013), the independent drama The Saints - Sie kannten kein Gesetz (2013), and the acclaimed sci-fi romantic drama Her (2013).

There are many orphans as AIDS is rampant in the slum."
