It is based on a 1984 novelty parody song of Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\" and \"I Love L.A.\" by Randy Newman. Written by Marin and released on the 1985 Cheech & Chong album Get Out of My Room, the parody was made a music video the same year. Marin used the song as the basis of his first solo film."
