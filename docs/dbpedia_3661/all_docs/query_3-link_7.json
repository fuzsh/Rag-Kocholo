        "text": "Floyd Joy Mayweather, Jr. (born Floyd Joy Sinclair; February 24, 1977) is an American retired professional boxer. Widely considered the greatest boxer of his era, undefeated as a professional, and a five-division world champion, Mayweather won twelve world titles and the lineal championship in four different weight classes (twice in the welterweight division). He is a two-time winner of the Ring magazine Fighter of the Year award (1998 and 2007), a three-time winner of the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) Fighter of the Year award (2007, 2013 and 2015), and a six-time winner of the Best Fighter ESPY Award (2007, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014). BoxRec currently rates Mayweather as the fifth greatest pound for pound fighter of all time, and the greatest pound for pound welterweight of all time. He is referred to as of 2015 by his adoring fans as T.B.E. or The Best Ever.\n\nMany sporting news and boxing websites rated Mayweather as the best pound for pound boxer in the world twice in a span of ten years, including The Ring, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, BoxRec, Fox Sports, and Yahoo! Sports. Mayweather topped the Forbes and Sports Illustrated lists of the 50 highest-paid athletes of 2012 and 2013, and the Forbes list again in 2014 and 2015, listing him as the highest paid athlete in the world. In 2007, He founded Mayweather Promotions, his own boxing promotional firm after defecting from Bob Arum's Top Rank.\n\nHe has an overall record of 49-0, which ties Rocky Marciano's seemingly unreachable record but more impressively, he his record of 26-0 (10 knockouts) in world title fights, 23-0 (9 KOs) in lineal title fights, 24-0 (7 KOs) against former or current world titlists, 12-0 (3 KOs) against former or current lineal titles, and 2-0 (1 KO) against International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees.\n\nMayweather has generated approximately $1,311,000,000 in pay-per-view revenue and 19,530,000 in pay-per-view buys throughout his career, surpassing the likes of former top pay-per-view attractions Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Oscar De La Hoya, and Manny Pacquiao. Floyd retired from boxing at 49-0 with his last fight being Mayweather vs. Berto on September 12, 2015.\n\nFor 35 years, Bob Barker had been the host of Der Preis ist heiß (1972) game show. Not only is it the highest-rated daytime program, it is also the longest-running game show in TV history, surpassing the prime-time hit What's My Line? (1950), which ran for 18 years. He also served as the executive producer of the program, since 1988, until his retirement in 2007. Named the most popular game show host of all time in a national poll, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Daytime Television in 1999. Although he has graced our television screens for more than four decades, his career continued at full circle, until he left the show, in 2007, only to be replaced by comedian Drew Carey.\n\nIn 1996, he made his motion picture debut in Universal Pictures' Happy Gilmore - Ein Champ zum Verlieben (1996), in which he played himself with Adam Sandler. His real acting debut, however, came when he was asked to play Mel Harris' father in NBC's Diesmal für immer (1996). Another honor came when one of the most historic sites in the history of television, Stage 33 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, was re-dedicated as the Bob Barker Studio in ceremonies following the taping of the 5,000th episode of \"The Price is Right\", on March 11, 1998. Barker was the first performer to whom CBS has ever dedicated a stage.\n\nBarker was born in Darrington, Washington, and spent most of his youth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where his mother was a schoolteacher. His family eventually moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he attended high school and Drury College on a basketball scholarship. World War II interrupted his studies and he joined the US Navy, becoming a fighter pilot, but the war ended before he was assigned to a seagoing squadron.\n\nFollowing his discharge, Barker returned to Drury and took a job at a local radio station to help finance his studies. It was there he discovered what he did best being to host audience participation shows. After graduating summa cum laude with a degree in economics, he went to work for a radio station in Palm Beach, Florida. A year later he moved to Los Angeles, and within a week he was the host of his own radio program, \"The Bob Barker Show\". He made his debut, at the end of 1956 on national television as the host of the popular Truth or Consequences (1950). Ralph Edwards, the show's originator, had sold the show to NBC as a daytime strip, but he had not chosen a host. He auditioned other hosts in Hollywood and New York for weeks, but when he heard \"The Bob Barker Show\" on his car radio, he knew he had found the man for the job. Proving that Edwards had chosen him wisely, Barker hosted \"Truth or Consequences\" for an unbelievable 18 years, until the show ended in 1975, and he and Edwards remained close friends, until Edwards's death in 2005. They drank a toast at lunch every December 21st to celebrate the day in 1956, when Edwards notified him he was going to become the host of \"Truth or Consequences\".\n\nBarker had been twice named in the Guinness Book of World Records as Television's \"Most Durable Performer,\" at 3,524 shows, and \"Most Generous Host in Television history\" for awarding $55 million in prizes on his various shows. During the ensuing years, the $55-million figure had increased to more than $200 million. He had won 11 Emmys as a Game Show Host, more than any other performer, and 2 more as Executive Producer of \"The Price is Right\". He also was given the Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999, for a total of 14, and won 2 additional awards, for a total of 16 Emmys. He had also received the coveted Carbon Mike Award of the Pioneer of Broadcasters.\n\nIn 1978, he developed \"The Bob Barker Fun & Games Show\", a series of personal appearances that attracted record-breaking audiences throughout the US and Canada. He also established the DJ&T Foundation in Beverly Hills, California, the purpose of which is to help control the dog and cat population. He was funding the foundation through his own resources to support low-cost or free spay/neuter clinics. This foundation is named in memory of his late wife, Dorothy Jo, and his mother, Matilda (Tilly) Valandra, both of whom loved animals. Barker's work on behalf of animals has garnered him a long list of awards from prestigious humane organizations across the country. In fact, a columnist wrote Bob had become a part-time television host and a full-time animal rights activist. However, he assured his audiences there was room in his busy life for both television and animals.\n\nAfter his retirement, Barker had made 3 more appearances, on \"The Price is Right\", the first being to promote his autobiography, \" Priceless Memories :, then, on his 90th birthday, in 2013 he briefly replaced Drew Carey, at the show's intro, for an April Fools' Day joke, which was his last appearance. In 2010, The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society announced it had purchased and outfitted a ship to interdict with Japanese whaling operations in the Southern Ocean using $5 million dollars, provided by him, the same year, he donated $2.5 million, toward the purchase of office space for the organization in Los Angeles. The \"Bob Barker Building\" opened in 2012.\n\nBob Barker passed away on August 26, 2023, in Hollywood Hills, California, after a long battle against Alzheimer's disease. He was 99.\n\nDrafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers as the heir apparent to Tommy Maddox, Ben Rothelisberger wound up taking the NFL by storm in the 2004 season. When Maddox went down with an injury in Pittsburgh's 2nd week loss of 2004 to the Baltimore Ravens, Rothelisberger was elevated to starting quarterback, and the Steelers' season was never the same. Nicknamed Big Ben due to an imposing build that was unusual for quarterbacks, Rothelisberger won in his first official start in week three of 2004, and won again in week four. He and the Steelers kept winning in subsequent games, and suddenly the Steelers, a year removed from a poor 2003 season, were becoming an AFC force.\n\nIt was during the 2004 Halloween weekend that Rothelisberger officially \"arrived\" when Pittsburgh hosted the defending Superbowl champion New England Patriots, who had compiled an NFL-record 21 consecutive victories. This streak came crashing to a half as Rothelisberger led the Steelers to a 34-20 triumph, giving Pittsburgh the edge in the AFC. The following Sunday Rothelisberger handed the visiting Philidelphia Eagles a 27-3 pounding, the Eagles' first loss of the year and which led to the infamous Terrell Owens-Donovan McNabb sideline incident. Now Pittsburgh was listed a Superbowl contender, and opposing defenses were forced to pay far more attention to Rothelisberger than they could ever have anticipated. Big Ben began to be tested more as the 2004 season wound down, notably in a dramatic shootout with the Eli Manning-led New York Giants, but Rothelisberger continued to triumph, and led the Steelers to a spectacular 15-1 2004 season.\n\nEntering the playoffs, however, Rothelisberger was now a target of opposing defensive schemes, and facing the New York Jets Rothelisberger committed several ill-fated plays, notably a pair of 4th-quarter interceptions. But two botched New York Jet field goal tries allowed Rothelisberger to lead the Steelers to a field goal triumph, and left Big Ben with a 16-0 record as a starter. His winning streak, however, came to an end in the AFC Championship Game to the revenge-minded New England Patriots, who picked off Rothelisberger three times; a 2nd-quarter pick was returned by Rodney Harison for a back-breaking touchdown. Rothelisberger threw two touchdown passes but could not overcome the Superbowl-bound Patriots in a 41-27 drilling of the Steelers.\n\nIt was his first career loss as a pro, and his second loss would come some nine months later in a suspenseful 23-20 loss to the Patriots. He would bounce back, leading the Steelers to a 11-5 record in 2005. As a wild card, the Steelers went on to defeat the division champion Cincinatti Bengals, heavily-favored Indianapolis Colts, and the re-energized Denver Broncos to earn a berth in Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAlthough he struggled in the Super Bowl, Ben was able to do just enough to help the Steelers to their first NFL championship since the 1979 season. At age 23, he became the youngest quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl win.\n\nHowever, the celebration was short-lived as Rothlisberger was seriously injured in a near-fatal off-season motorcycle accident, to which he was not wearing a helmet. He was able to recover and now shows no signs of injury.\n\nSnoop Dogg is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, producer, media personality, entrepreneur, and actor.\n\nHis music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by Dr. Dre and featured on Dre's solo debut, \"Deep Cover\", and then on Dre's solo debut album, The Chronic. He has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States and 35 million albums worldwide.\n\nSnoop's debut album, Doggystyle, produced by Dr. Dre, was released in 1993 by Death Row Records. Bolstered by excitement driven by Snoop's featuring on The Chronic, the album debuted at number one on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Selling almost a million copies in the first week of its release, Doggystyle became certified quadruple platinum in 1994 and spawned several hit singles, including \"What's My Name?\" and \"Gin & Juice\". In 1994 Snoop released a soundtrack on Death Row Records for the short film Murder Was the Case, starring himself. His second album, Tha Doggfather (1996), also debuted at number one on both charts, with \"Snoop's Upside Ya Head\" as the lead single. The album was certified double platinum in 1997.\n\nAfter leaving Death Row Records, Snoop signed with No Limit Records, where he recorded his next three albums, Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). Snoop then signed with Priority/Capitol/EMI Records in 2002, where he released Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss. He then signed with Geffen Records in 2004 for his next three albums, R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and Ego Trippin'. Malice 'n Wonderland (2009), and Doggumentary (2011) were released on Priority. Snoop Dogg has starred in motion pictures and hosted several television shows. He also coaches a youth football league and high school football team.\n\nSnoop has 17 Grammy nominations without a win. In March 2016, the night before WrestleMania 32 in Arlington, Texas, he was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame, having made several appearances for the company, including as Master of Ceremonies during a match at WrestleMania XXIV. On November 19, 2018, Snoop Dogg was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He released his seventeenth solo album, I Wanna Thank Me in 2019.\n\nOne of the pioneers of heavy metal and one of its most commercially successful and iconic artists, Ozzy Osbourne was born in Birmingham, England, as John Michael Osbourne. After leaving school and having many odd jobs, he ended up in a band with Geezer Butler. This group then split, leading Ozzy and Geezer to join Tony Iommi and Bill Ward in a new band that went under several names (including Earth) that ended up being called Black Sabbath after a song of the same name that appeared on their first album (released 1969/70). He recorded several more albums with Sabbath despite the decline of his relationship with Tony Iommi, which after several break ups led to him leaving/being fired from the band in 1979. After a short time he launched a solo career with a line up behind him that varied immensely from album to album and tour to tour. During the 80's he was treated several times for alcoholism and was sued twice for the suicides of some of his young fans (cleared completely). Following his No More Tears album he declared he would tour for the last time. In 1991, on his last date he reformed briefly on stage with Black Sabbath for three songs. However a much talked about reformation tour fell through and Ozzy seemed to go into retirement, his bassist (Mike Inez) joined Alice in Chains and the guitarist (Zakk Wylde) formed his own band, Pride and Glory. Now however he is recording a new album and has said he intends to tour again. The album should be out in the summer of 1995 and the tour should be shortly after. Geezer Butler has now quit Sabbath (again) and rejoined Ozzy (he played bass for him on tour during the mid to late 80's) and should play on the new album.\n\nBest known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series Miami Vice (1984), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James \"Sonny\" Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer Michael Mann, paired Johnson with the equally cool Philip Michael Thomas as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of Edward James Olmos as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named \"St. Vitus' Dance\" with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, \"Miami Vice\" had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world's favorite cop. For his work on \"Miami Vice\" Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.\n\nJohnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son Eva Lea \"Nell\" (Wilson), a beautician, and Wayne Fred Johnson, a farmer. As a kid, he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic Der Junge mit dem Hund (1975).\n\nJohnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on \"Miami Vice\", which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in a praised TV-movie adaption of the William Faulkner novel Flammender Sommer (1985) and the feature Sweethearts Dance - Liebe ist mehr als nur ein Wort (1988) with Susan Sarandon. After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like Dead Bang - Kurzer Prozess (1989), The Hot Spot - Spiel mit dem Feuer (1990) and Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like John Frankenheimer, Sidney Lumet and Dennis Hopper.\n\nAfter working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show Nash Bridges (1996). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred Cheech Marin and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe. Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD's Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After \"Nash Bridges\" went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continued to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama Just Legal (2005), which was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and traveled to Europe to make the Norwegian screwball comedy Lange flate ballær II (2008) and the Italian films Bastardi (2008) and Torno a vivere da solo (2008). As a supporting actor, he's been seen in mainstream films such as Machete (2010), Django Unchained (2012) and Knives Out: Mord ist Familiensache (2019).\n\nJohnson had two pre-fame marriages that were annulled within a matter of days. In the early 1970s, he lived with rock groupie Pamela Des Barres. In 1972, Tippi Hedren, his co-star in The Harrad Experiment (1973), allowed him to date her daughter Melanie Griffith despite the fact she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. From 1981 to 1985, he lived with actress Patti D'Arbanville and they had one son together. After short-lived liaisons with Cybill Shepherd, Barbra Streisand and a barely legal Uma Thurman, he remarried Griffith in 1989. The couple divorced again in 1996, after she left him for Antonio Banderas. Johnson was engaged to \"Nash Bridges\" co-star O'Keefe, but broke it off before they made it to the altar.
