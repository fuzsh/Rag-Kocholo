        "text": "A note from Daniel White Hodge, the editor of this page:\n\n“This dictionary isn’t so you can try to talk like someone you’re not. But it is a good reference for those who are seeking to understand a piece of youth culture today. No … every kid doesn’t use all of these words. But this is a comprehensive list of many of the words you’ll hear, in part. Enjoy!” – Dan\n\nA Few Slang Resources: Before you scroll down and check out our free dictionary below, you’ll want to know about a few great resources available: First, if you are looking for a good resources for TEXT slang (you know… like LOL or WTF), then check out www.NoSlang.com for a great database. Second, if you’re looking to use slang to create conversations with teenagers, then you’ll want to check out this great youth ministry tool, a book called What’s a Fo’ Sheezy. This book is a great resource to anyone who wants to get a better understanding of youth culture and for anyone looking for discussion starters with kids. This book provides over 300 questions from slanguage to get kids talking, laughing, debating and thinking. CLICK HERE to read an excerpt from this book and find out more about where this slang comes from. Thirdly, check out two books written by our slang dictionary editor Daniel White Hodge: Heaven Has A Ghetto: The Missiological Gospel and Theology of Tupac Amaru Shakur (VDM Academic 2010) and The Soul of Hip Hop: Rimbs Timbs & A Cultural Theology (IVP August 2010).\n\nWARNING:\n\nThis “slanguage” represents today’s culture and many of the problems that go along with it. Although much of it is humorous, a good portion of it is very offensive. Many of the words are terms for sexual activity and drug use. Many of the examples given are common quotes from youth today- these quotes, although somewhat edited, can be foul or vile (sadly, all the below phrases can be said in a PG movie). I believe this dictionary has educational value in helping youth workers understand teen mentality and culture, but please do use discretion.\n\n‘hood scratch\n\n1.

Commonly known as the time to smoke pot. It has come to mean everything from the act of smoking, the stuff that’s smoked, and the optimum smoking time.

Also known for the date, April 20th, which is the day to smoke pot all day, “the hippie holiday.” Most pot smokers use 420 for just that, but, this date also happens to be Hitler’s birthday which most possibly connected to or resulted in the selection of the April 20th date of the Columbine tragedy. Note: I get a large amount of emails trying to correct me, saying that 420 is actually the California police code for possession of marijuana. Sorry- but that’s an urban legend. Here are the facts straight from the LAPD: “There are several codes of law in CA that dictate drug offences. The Penal Code(PC) and the Health and Safety Code(H&S;). Most of the drug offences are covered by the H&S.; There is no 420 H&S;, there is a 420 PC and it is “Preventing entry onto Public property”. We sometimes have codes that the dispatcher uses on the radio to let us know what kind of call we are going to, but it usually is the same as the code section.
