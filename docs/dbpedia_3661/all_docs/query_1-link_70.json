Tierra’s invigorating blend of R&B, Latin, and Pop, is the precursor to many Hispanic artists. They performed at such prestigious venues as Carnegie Hall, The Greek Theater, Dodger Stadium, The Rosebowl, Red Rocks, Houston Astrodome, as well as such television shows as The American Music Awards, American Bandstand, Soul Train, Solid Gold, and many others.\n\nTheir 1981 mega hit “Together” catapulted them to the top of the national and international charts. And the band, under the leadership of Rudy Salas has been going strong for almost 45 years and have performed on stage with such superstars as James Brown, Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, War, as well as many other top performers of the music business.\n\nTierra has been widely known for opening doors for other Latino artists, such as Los Lobos, Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine, Sheila E., Paul Rodriguez, etc.\n\nRudy started Tierra in 1972 and brought in his brother Steve on vocals. At the time, Tierra was more rock oriented and released two albums. They received critical acclaim, but they failed to impress the commercial markets around the country. They refined their R&B and Latin influences on the nightclub circuit for about six years.\n\nIn 1981, Tierra decided to quit the club circuit and honed their skills in the recording studio again.\n\n“City Nights” was the result and Rudy tried to shop it to every record company around L.A. He was turned down by all of them. Rudy decided to put the album out independently. He worked out deals here and there, and the local radio stations started playing “Together” the single. Before you know it, the song got on the national charts, even without a record company. All of a sudden, the very same record companies that turned it down were bidding for the record.\n\nIt finally caught the ear of Neil Bogart of Boardwalk Records. He signed the band, and as they say, “The rest is history”.\n\nSubsequently, Tierra had many other hits such as “Gonna Find Her”, “Memories”, “La La Means I Love You”, “Are We In Love”, “Zoot Suit Boogie”, “Lady In the Moonlight”, “Latin Legends Live”, etc.\n\nIn 1992, Tierra was asked by James Brown to back him up for his appearance on the Hollywood “Walk Of Fame” and toured with him, as well as with the Commodores, Kool and The Gang, The Gap Band, etc.\n\nSince then, Tierra has performed all over the U.S. and many parts of the world.\n\nWith over 25 CDs under their belts, and their songs being featured on several compilation CDs, the band is as strong as ever, with leader-guitarist-singer-producer Rudy Salas holding down the foundation, along with a super tight rhythm section lead by Chris Trujillo on drums (formerly with Toto and Tom Petty), Tony Banda (original bassman for the legendary Poncho Sanchez), Joey Navarro, keyboard wizard, and Dale Villavicencio on percussion (Sheila E., Azteca). Leading the horn section is Tierra veteran Rudy “Bub” Villa on alto sax, as well as Victor Cisneros on soprano sax, and Jeff Lewis on trumpet (formerly with the Jackson Five). Handling the vocals is the dynamic Will “Rize” Rivera.\n\nTierra is now in the studio working on their next CD. With a line up of veteran musicians like this, it promises to be one of their best ever.\n\n***\n\nAdditionally, the Mariachi Divas will perform during dinner and DJ Anthony Guaracha will spin during the VIP reception.\n\nHere’s a little bit more about Guaracha: Anthony Guaracha, DJ TJ Pops, began DJ-ing in the mid-1990s. He has volunteered at the University of California, Riverside, radio station, KUCR, since he was an undergraduate student in 2001, interning for the Radio Aztlan program.

To honor him, UNIDOS is presenting him with a special Patron of the Arts Award this evening.\n\nBest known as one half of the hilariously irreverent, satirical, counter-culture, no-holds-barred duo Cheech and Chong (now back on tour), Cheech Marin is a paradox in the world of entertainment. Cheech is an actor, director, writer, musician, art collector, and humanitarian, a man who has enough talent, humor, and intelligence to do just about anything. He is truly a multi-generational star. To this day, Cheech and Chong films remain the number one weekend video rentals, and Cheech is widely acknowledged as a cultural icon. Cheech’s long-awaited memoir entitled Cheech is Not My Real Name…But Don’t Call Me Chong!was released on March 14, 2017, by Hachette Book Group.\n\nCheech (real name Richard) Marin was born in South Central Los Angeles and met Tommy Chong in Vancouver, British Columbia, as a political refugee. The duo moved back to Los Angeles and proved to be “entertainment gold.” Six of their albums went gold, four were nominated for Grammys, and Los Cochinoswon the 1973 Grammy for Best Comedy Recording. The critically acclaimed duo made a fluid transition to films, starring in eight features together.\n\nDuring his split with Chong, Cheech wrote, directed, and starred in the comedy Born In East L.A.He appeared in over 20 films, including his scene-stealing role in Tin Cup. On television, Cheech was a sitcom regular before joining Don Johnson on the highly successful CBS drama Nash Bridges(1996-2001). He later had a recurring role on the hit NBC show, Lost, and in recent years, he guest-starred on Roband Jane the Virgin. Through his popular Disney Pixar animation film roles (Oliver & Company, The Lion King, Cars, and more) and as an author of children’s books such as Cheech the School Bus Driver, Cheech is also a favorite with kids and parents around the world.\n\nIn 2009, everyone’s favorite duo reunited after 25 years apart for a national and international comedy tour, the Light Up Americareunion tour, selling out everywhere. They also shot a full-length live comedy film Hey Watch Thisin 2010. The pair followed with subsequent tours, satisfying audiences thirsty to see the pair together. They continue to perform together as their schedules allow.\n\nCheech is recognized today as a preeminent Chicano art advocate. In the mid-1980s, he began developing what is now arguably the finest private collection of Chicano art. Much of it formed the core of his inaugural exhibition Chicano Visions: American Painters on the Verge, which broke attendance records during its groundbreaking 15‐city tour during 2001‐2007 to major art museums across the United States. He states, “Chicano art is American art. My goal is to bring the term ‘Chicano’ to the forefront of the art world.”\n\nFollowing the success of Chicano Visions, over a dozen additional exhibitions drawn from the Cheech Marin Collection have toured more than 50 major art museums across the United States and in Europe under the direction of Melissa Richardson Banks. In addition, art books have been independently published to accompany many of these exhibitions, including Papel Chicano: Works on Paper from the Collection of Cheech Marin, Chicanitas: Small Paintings from the Cheech Marin Collection, and Papel Chicano Dos: Works on Paper from the Collection of Cheech Marin. Artwork from his collection inspires his work in other ways. For example, the bottle design of Tres Papalote Mezcal, for which Cheech serves as the brand ambassador, was inspired by the contemporary glass sculptures and other works of Einar and Jamex de la Torre, two brothers who are represented his collection.\n\nFurthering his goal to introduce Chicano art to a wider audience, Marin has entered into a partnership with both the City of Riverside and the non-profit, non-governmental Riverside Art Museum to create the Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art, Culture & Industry of the Riverside Art Museum. Slated to open in 2020, The Cheech as the Center was affectionately dubbed by Marin, will become the permanent home for his more than 700 works of Chicano art, including paintings, sculptures, and photography; collectively, the most renowned Chicano art collection in the United States.\n\nCheech is a nationally-ranked golfer and active in the charity circuit. Married to Russian-born classical pianist Natasha Marin, the couple resides in Pacific Palisades, California.\n\nPhoto by Allen Amato.\n\nPresenter of the Patron of the Arts Award\n\nWe are excited to announce that George Lopez will be at the Gala to present the Patron of the Arts Award to Cheech Marin!\n\nGeorge Lopez’s multi-faceted career encompasses television, film, standup comedy, and late-night television.\n\nLopez is currently on his standup comedy tour, The Comedy Get Down, with Eddie Griffin, D.L.

Chicano artists captured and articulated the core of Chicano culture and history, the struggles, and traditions with a commitment to social change. These were and continue to be reflected in theater, corridos or folk songs, traditional folk dances, literature, painting, sculpture, and media art forms.\n\nThe Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art, Culture & Industry (The Cheech) of the Riverside Art Museum will be a dynamic daily demonstration of the presence and voice of the Chicano/Latino community.
