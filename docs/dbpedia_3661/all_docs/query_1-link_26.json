        "text": "Post by dth1971 on\n\nCheech and Chong had 3 Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 comedy record hits in 1973-1974: \"Basketball Jones Featuring Tyrone Shoelaces\", \"Sister Mary Elephant - SHUDDUP!\", and \"Earache My Eye Featuring Alice Bowie\". The duo missed hitting the Top 40 (but came close) in 1978 with \"Bloat On\" and in 1985 with \"Born in East L.A.\".\n\nPost by irock on\n\nI used to love Cheech & Chong but I got tired of them at some point during the past 25 years or so. I still love their first movie.\n\nIncidentally, they made a cameo appearance in Hoyt Axton's version of The No No Song (it became a hit by Ringo Starr but Axton wrote it)."
