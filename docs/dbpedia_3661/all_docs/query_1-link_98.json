        "text": "Note: Some obvious selections on the authors’ part, and one heavily influenced by the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Not that I’m complaining mind you since they represent me and my time, as well. There really are a huge horde of song that use L.A. as musical inspiration to choose from (thank God, no one choose a Celine Dion tune). And the Rock, Folk, and Pop categories seem to dominate this selection. As they did before, no more than one selection from the same artist, so I guess that’s why Twelve Thirty (Young Girls are Coming to the Canyon) by The Mama’s and The Papas was left off. I would have gone with Wouldn’t It Be Nice by The Beach Boys, instead (mainly because of the film Shampoo).\n\nHow about Bob Seger’s Hollywood Nights (1978) then? Seems like they forgot entirely about Neil Diamond’s I Am I Said. My younger friends tell me that Under the Bridge by The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1992) and the infectious rhythm of L.A. by The Fall (1985) were MIA. So too with To Live and Die in L.A. by Wang Chung (others argue for TuPac’s song of the same title). 99 Miles From L.A. by Art Garfunkel had that distinct ethereal aspect, which their list missed here. Whether or not it’s the journey west, the destination was still Los Angeles with Route 66 (any will do, but I’ll chose the Manhattan Transfer version in this instance). Don’t forget about it’s lesser known sibling instrumental tune by Herb Alpert, Route 101."
