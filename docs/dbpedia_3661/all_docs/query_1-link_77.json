        "text": "Two of the most famous pot smokers, Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, have unveiled plans for their first comedy tour in more than 25 years since their acrimonious split.\n\nCheech And Chong: Light Up America will hit 22 cities in the United States starting with Philadelphia on September 12 and ending in Denver, Colorado, on December 20. In between they will play Los Angeles, Miami, Washington, DC and other places.\n\n\"This is a moment that I've been looking forward to for many, many years because we have such a legacy and history together that we couldn't escape it, even if we tried,\" Chong said.\n\nCheech and Chong were one of the most successful comedy teams of the 1970s with hit movies and chart-topping records based on their brand of marijuana-influenced humour.\n\nThey were potheads who appealed to a youth generation steeped in personal freedom spawned by 1960s-era hippies. At the time, American kids were thirsting for humour that mirrored their lives, experiences and pop culture.\n\nMarin says their humour about doing stupid things while being stoned on marijuana should still appeal to today's youth, as well as Cheech and Chong's older fans.\n\n\"We've had the younger audience all along. Every time they get to that certain age, they go through that Cheech and Chong period of watching the movies, listening to the records. So, it's almost like a right of passage,\" Marin said.\n\nHe says that the pair considered calling the show the Womb To Tomb tour, to highlight the broad age range of fans.\n\nMarin, 62, and Chong, 70, gained notoriety in nightclubs in the Los Angeles area in the 1970s and released their first album, Cheech And Chong, in 1971. Los Cochinos in 1973 won the Grammy Award that year for best comedy album.\n\nIn 1978 their first movie, Up In Smoke, proved to be a blockbuster, raking in more than $US100 million at box offices.\n\nThey performed together onstage for the last time in 1981, but continued to make movies and records.\n\nTheir album Get Out Of My Room in 1985 included the hit song Born In East LA, which parodied Bruce Springsteen's Born In The USA.\n\nThe pair went their own ways in a well-publicised and bitter split following the release of that album.\n\nMarin carved out a career as a television actor in shows such as Nash Bridges and Judging Amy.\n\nChong also did a lot of TV work, including appearances on That '70s Show.\n\nChong has long advocated the legalisation of marijuana, and in 2003 was arrested and later imprisoned for selling drug paraphernalia."
