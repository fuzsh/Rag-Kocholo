        "text": "Three-hour Carnival of Cuisine brings out Vegas’ best\n\nMelissa Arseniuk |\n\nIt can be difficult to decide where to eat in a town like Vegas, with scores of famous chefs’ restaurants and a daunting list of options. The decision is rarely easy, especially for aspiring foodies such as myself. That’s why events like the Carnival of Cuisine are great: They allow discerning diners and gourmet-loving gluttons to get their fill in one fell swoop. (Sure, the gluttons already have an array of all-you-can-eat buffets to choose from, but those with both an astute palate and an insatiable appetite can have a hard time.) The first annual Carnival of Cuisine at the Palazzo featured food from both it and its sister property, the Venetian’s, most popular restaurants. More than 30 eateries and eight James Beard Award-winning chefs, including all the big names -- Puck, Trotter, Keller, Legasse, Batali, Woo -- were represented. And over three tasty hours on both Saturday and Sunday, ...\n\nread more...\n\nKaty Perry Rocks Rok Vegas\n\nAllison Duck |\n\nWhen I hear Katy Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl,” I think of the clichéd hot chick, make-out party that is apparently on men’s minds 23 out of 24 hours a day. The scene on the red carpet at the opening of Rok Vegas Saturday night was a tad bit different, as Katy planted one on the lips of her main girl –- her grandmother, Ann Hudson.\n\nread more...\n\nBreaking campaign news from Miss America Organization\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nObamaQuest '08 has ended and I am currently up far too late than to be considered healthy, in a hotel room in Cheyenne, Wyoming, en route to some time off with my family in Idaho. Losing a battle with insomnia, I am checking my email from the complimentary WiFi in my room at LaQuinta (Note to DoubleTree execs: See how La Quinta has mastered this free Internet deal and mimic that process) and just happened upon a startling news release from the Miss America Organization. I'm on this list because I have covered the pageant in Vegas. Usually Miss America is promoting an appearance by the current titleholder, in this case Kirsten Haglund, on the Today show or with Rachel Ray. But this is something different -- what could be considered an endorsement of onetime pageant contestant Sarah Palin, accomplished markswoman, governor of Alaska and for the past 19 hours ...\n\nread more...\n\nEgos, Lies and Videotape: Obama reaches out to Latino voters\n\nTovin Lapan |\n\nLast time we looked at John McCain’s foray into Spanish-language advertising, where the free-trade fanatic touted deals with Colombia and Central America as ways to create jobs in South America and at home. Here is a Spanish-language TV spot by Barack Obama that, like his English ads, leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy: “Hope” -- by Obama for America Ad Transcript: Spanish-speaking narrator: Do you remember the notion that brought your parents here to this country? Obama - in English with Spanish subtitles: “Hope is what led me here today. With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas and a story that can only happen in the United States of America.” Spanish-speaking narrator: This is already your country. Don’t let anything or anyone take that away. Obama - in English with Spanish subtitles: We are truth and hope over fear. Spanish-speaking narrator: You are not alone – ...\n\nread more...\n\nIt’s almost showtime\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nIt's about Showtime, and Joe Biden just received a roar from mentioning the name of Floyd Little, the Denver Broncos running back from the '70s. Feet are stomping, flags waving. The place is about filled, with a few pockets of empty seats. Flashes are going off in every direction. I don't know what this guy is going to come with tonight, but it's safe to say everyone here feels a part of history. Cheers!\n\nread more...\n\nDan Rather pressed for time\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nAnother random sighting, this one outside the men's room. I walked out and there was a cluster of camera-wielding Democrats waiting for ... something. I turned around and -- Dan Rather! He stopped to answer one question from a kiddie video reporting crew -- can't turn down the kids -- but when I asked him to compare the political climate today to 1968, he said, \"Sorry, but my political climate is that I need to get back in the stadium or I will lose my place.\" So my new goal is to someday be asked by Dan Rather for an interview, and to be too busy to bother with him.\n\nread more...\n\nTonight’s best line\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nInevitably, the crowd has started The Wave. God bless the political process ... Oh. Michael McDonald has resumed decorum with, \"America, The Beautiful.\" By my wholly subjective analysis, Al Gore's line about McCain continuing the Bush-Cheney legacy, \"I'm all for recycling, but this is ridiculous,\" was the night's best. So far.\n\nread more...\n\nBill Richardson means break time\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nThere are points in rock concerts when the artists will play \"beer songs.\" That's what I call them, anyway. It's the moment a band like Journey plays something off its new album. Usually, something acoustic. Beer time! New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was himself a \"beer song\" a bit ago. That's because Stevie Wonder was to follow. So when Richardson took the stage, much of the crowd took a concession or loo break. But the moment Richardson finished, the place filled again for Stevie. Signed, sealed, delivered ... The party is on.\n\nread more...\n\nA Bernie Yuman sighting\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nJohn Legend is onstage, singing the song, \"Yes We Can,\" but the real news was down at the elevator a few minutes ago: a Bernie Yuman sighting. I deduce that Yuman, the longtime manager of Siegfried & Roy, is here with his client Muhammad Ali, who is reportedly on hand, somewhere, at the moment. I caught Bernie, dressed in is usual jet-black suit, as I was departing and he was boarding an elevator here at INVESCO. It went like this: Bernie: \"Mr. Kats!\" Mr. Kats: \"Bernie!\" (Doors close.)\n\nread more...\n\nFinally, we’re in\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nSecurity at INVESCO is about as stringent as the TSA setup at McCarran International Airport. Shoes on, though. And we're in, and our time on line was about two hours. A couple of noteworthy comments: -- From a kid selling Obama Change buttons, \"I've had it with the past eight years! That's half my life!\" -- And from a cop monitoring the line, \"Stay in line! No strife! This is a peaceful line!\" I talked to one of the many street entrepreneurs selling Obama T-shirts, bumper stickers, watches and whatnot. His name's Vince and he was wearing a Jason Kidd-New Jersey Nets jersey. Vince is a real estate investor from L.A. with a lot of time on his hands right now, who also has a T-shirt store and has been tailing Obama for the past five months. He's been all over the country: Mississippi, Oregon, Pennsylvania, taking in about 100 ...\n\nread more...\n\nLong, long lines\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nIt's hard to tell how long the line is when you're in it. We expect this one is maybe four miles long. Long enough that people are looking at street maps of Denver to figure out just where INVESCO Field is located. A few minutes ago dozens of people were nearly caught on the RTC tracks as the city's public transportation train rumbled through. Long enough that a member of the Obama campaign is playing \"Long and Winding Road\" on a sound system equipped to entertain people on this long, winding road ...\n\nread more...\n\nHeavenly bodies\n\nJennifer Grafiada |\n\nBaby-faced Michito Sanchez gives it to them good and long, just how they like it. The Cuban bandleader of the 11-piece salsa orchestra has a way with the Thursday-night crowds at the South Point, especially the women.\n\nread more...\n\nThe Tao of Cheadle\n\nJosh Bell |\n\nLas Vegas Weekly Managing Editor Ken Miller joins Josh to discuss new theatrical releases Traitor, Elegy and America the Beautiful, plus a trio of movies not screened for critics.\n\nread more...\n\n‘Gimme an O, Gimme a B …’\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nAs they say, \"Mission Accomplished.\" On the way back to the stadium from downtown, I just passed a group of Second City aspirants dressed in purple gowns as part of the Temple of Obama. The Pat Robertson of the group, wearing a Clemson Tigers ballcap, is yelling, \"Gimme an O! Gimme a B! ...\" I know where this is going. Walk on.\n\nread more...\n\nAvalon the phenomenon\n\nJennifer Grafiada |\n\n\"Who that dude sleeping with your girlfriend? Getting nude and rude in your bed? Same dude that your sister like.

At the moment we're even less than commoners, no tickets or credentials for tonight's speech. But I do have a line into one pass to the show, and that pass is at Willie G's in downtown Denver. So we have parked at a surface lot near the stadium, worming our way into that lot by claiming - accurately - that we are with the media. The line of people heading into the stadium seems not to end and is teeming with all cultures. We nearly had a dust-up when dozens of convention delegates cut into the line and were practically shouted down by those who have been in line for about an hour now. And, moments ago, two women on mountain bikes carrying \"Repent or Die\" signs got into a ride-by yell-off with line dwellers ...\n\nread more...\n\nRadio Woes\n\nT.R. Witcher |\n\nA few days ago, as we were surfing the web on the interstates of Nevada and Utah, John and I were congratulating ourselves on the telecom miracle of the early 21st century. But several hundred miles of spotty service and a busted video camera have humbled us, and yesterday we played a frustrating round of hide and seek with radio reception through much of the Colorado high country. We left Aspen along Highway 82, a beautiful drive through the aspen groves to Independence Pass, 12,000 feet or so above sea level. We were hoping to catch the Democratic Convention speeches. For awhile Harry Reid beguiled us with the role oil has played in everything from the invasion of Pearl Harbor to the Nazi invasion of Russia. Then we lost him. The view atop the windy pass was astounding; the colors slightly desaturated but sharp. On the downside of the pass, ...\n\nread more...\n\nThe Bubble\n\nApparently if you run into Aspen residents outside of Aspen, they’re not likely to tell you where they live. “The Roaring Fork Valley” might be the best you get out of them—this modesty is, one imagines, the equivalent of Harvard alums vaguely telling people they went to school in Boston. Some places just carry too much expectation. Founded in the 19th century as a mining town, Aspen’s history as a ski resort began in the mid Forties. In the Fifties and Sixties the old money came in; in the late Sixties and early Seventies it was the hippies. Hunter S. Thompson ran for sheriff of Pitkin County in 1970. He lost but inspired those hippies to take control of the town and the county. The quantity and quality of development has been tightly controlled since.

A quiet morning in Las Vegas, sun already blasting in the pre-work-day skies. Joe Biden is Barack Obama’s vice presidential nominee. Denver Police are already breaking out the pepper spray to subdue the protesters. And now, as the general election campaign actually, finally, mercifully, begins, the tenor of the rhetoric begins to move toward its inevitable climax. To wit, Michelle Obama spoke last night at the Democratic National Convention about the “improbable journey” of the Obama campaign to date, about her love of family, about change. It is, what would we call it? Articulate bluecollarness? Eloquent Populism? The American desire to appeal to the masses and establish your intellectual bonafides.

Obama and McCain haven’t forgotten about Spanish speakers in the U.S., though, at least the ones who vote. A fast growing sector of the population, we first started to really pay attention to the Hispanic-vote with George W. Bush’s first election. Dubya did well among the Hispanic population then, but has since fallen out of favor. Latinos make up about 15 percent of the United States population and 9 percent of eligible voters, which in a close race could mean the difference between moving into the White House and being relegated to fringe status as “that monotone guy who tells inconvenient truths.” Currently, Latino registered voters prefer Obama over McCain by 66 percent to 23 ...\n\nread more...\n\nTake my breath away, Charlene Darling\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nI am often asked, “Who lives like you?” And I say, “I don’t know that I would call it ‘living.’ ” But Saturday night was one of those only-in-Vegas evenings, and I’ll share it with you now.

Terri Nunn, the band’s lead vocalist since 1979 and sang on the monster hits “Take My Breath Away,” and “The Metro,” has teamed with Navarro for a video of the Newton-John hit “Magic,” from the 1980 ode to roller skating Xanadu. Nunn and Navarro contributed the cover version of the song and accompanying video to the Newton-John tribute scheduled tonight for the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles. Nunn cannot attend the gala, as Berlin is scheduled to perform tonight at Ovation at Green Valley Ranch Station Casino.

Not his own, but the weight – as in gravity and credibility – of his CSI television franchise. And on that point, he let loose that Laurence Fishburne, an inarguably weighty actor, is all but certain to replace William Peterson on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, the original Zuiker-produced drama set in Las Vegas. CSI Web siteAnthony Zuiker on IMDB Laurence Fishburne on IMDB Peterson, who signed a new contract in March, announced that he will be leaving the show after this season, his 10th as a full-time regular.

My first stage name, Justice, is obviously not my real name but we are not trying to represent real life. By giving customers a fake name, we intend to protect our privacy and create a persona. We are in character and the stage name is a part of it. The customer and the worker both know the truth, that the name is fake, and it’s proper etiquette to leave the issue alone. Lately, however, there are more people in my life who call me my fake name and I wonder if the persona is actually who I’ve become.

All that is certain is that during his campaign he convinced millions of Americans that he was a good man, perhaps a great man.\n\nread more...\n\nMovement or fan club?\n\nDamon Hodge |\n\nA line forms behind a circle of people flanking a table where ex-Black Panther Dhoruba Bin Wahad waxes pseudo-philosophic on the inherent evil of the U.S. political system. “President Bush should’ve been stopped a long time ago, but no one’s been willing to incur the wrath of the empire,” Wahad says of this unseen, Bush-empowering cabal.\n\nread more...\n\nSugarland\n\nJosh Bell |\n\nAfter parting ways with guitarist and songwriter Kristen Hall following their 2004 debut Twice the Speed of Life, Sugarland’s Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush went in a more slickly commercial direction on 2006’s Enjoy the Ride, enlisting veteran producer Byron Gallimore to help them reach the top of the country charts. It worked wonders.\n\nread more...\n\nEncounters at the End of the World\n\nMike D'Angelo |\n\nAt this point in his career—46 years as a filmmaker, 54 features and shorts—Werner Herzog has done time in so many inhospitable climes, and celebrated so many fellow loner-obsessives, that you can’t help but wonder whether more trenchant observations might emerge if he and his camera were thrust into, I dunno, some giant Midwestern shopping mall.\n\nread more...\n\nAn express to nowhere\n\nMike D'Angelo |\n\nStoner comedies, as became all too apparent during the brief heyday of Cheech and Chong, tend to suffer from an inherent liability: Their protagonists are too blissfully baked to budge from the couch, much less play an active role in some convoluted three-act narrative.\n\nread more...\n\nMajestic at the midpoint\n\nJacob Coakley |\n\nHalf-way through the Utah Shakespearean Festival, Jacob Coakley reviews Othello, The Two Gentlemen of Verona and The Taming of the Shrew.\n\nread more...\n\nLeave Boyd alone!\n\nSteve Friess |\n\nWithin hours of last week’s not-terribly-shocking news that Boyd Gaming was halting construction on its $4.8 billion Echelon project, message boards and blog comment sections across the web filled with a reaction that surprised me.\n\nread more...\n\nBringing it all together\n\nKen Miller |\n\nIt seems so incredibly simple, you wonder why no one in Las Vegas has done it before. But if it succeeds, it’s sure to be a huge boost for the arts and culture scene, as well as an auspicious start for the newly formed Metro Arts Council. By next spring or early summer, the organization plans to launch a web portal that will group every arts agency in the Las Vegas Valley into one master calendar.\n\nread more...\n\nScars on Broadway\n\nAnnie Zaleski |\n\nThese days, any rocker worth his (or her) salt has a side project. But with System of a Down on hiatus, Scars on Broadway—the new band co-founded by guitarist/vocalist Daron Malakian and drummer John Dolmayan—is the pair’s main creative outlet. Heartbroken SOAD fans should find much to like about the band’s self-titled debut, though.\n\nread more...\n\nHawthorne Heights\n\nJulie Seabaugh |\n\nUsed to be protracted legal battles were the domain of more established artists bickering over back-catalog royalties or accounting malfeasance. Similarly, most bands don’t experience the untimely death of a member and/or a vicious feud until they’re well past their prime.\n\nread more...\n\nMcHale to serve more than The Soup at Mandalay Bay\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nIt is the moment when the shooter becomes the target, when the smart-ass social critic himself assumes the spotlight. But Joel McHale, a novice stand-up taking the stage in Vegas for the first time Friday night, hardly sounds concerned. “What am I expecting? Not sure,” McHale says during a phone interview last week. “Sweatiness, and hopefully free drinks. It’ll be just like gambling. Hopefully I’ll be constructing sentences people can understand.” After a pause, McHale allows, “To be very serious, I’m terrified.” McHale performs at Mandalay Bay Theatre at 9 p.m. Friday. Expect the same tenor McHale has used to dice and dump celebrities into The Soup on E! Entertainment. McHale has hosted the show for two years, and by the time he’d taken the pilot’s seat the show was famous for airing snippets of regretful celebrity moments, to be followed unfailingly by a swift skewering from the host. Or, ...\n\nread more...\n\nMotley Crue\n\nJosh Bell |\n\nFrom the moment they hit the stage at the nearly full Mandalay Bay Events Center with “Kickstart My Heart,” Mötley Crüe sounded tired and sluggish.\n\nread more...\n\nEgo, Lies and Videotape — A look at the 2008 Presidential Campaign Ads\n\nTovin Lapan |\n\nWith political pundits dubbing Nevada a \"battleground\" in the presidential race, those of us in the Silver State can expect to see lots of campaign ads from both Barack Obama and John McCain leading up to the November general election. In order to help you sift through the cheesy music, majestic images, and less than subtle innuendo the Las Vegas Weekly will break down various campaign ads from both candidates. Today, we take a look at a McCain ad focusing on his plan to lower gas prices, and in the next installment of the series we examine Obama's response: \"Pump\" –- by John McCain 2008 While Obama was touring the Middle East and Europe, McCain released this ad blaming him for high gas prices: Poor timing since, as I'm sure anyone with a gas-powered vehicle has noticed, fuel prices in the area and across the country have been creeping downward ...\n\nread more...\n\nCrowd flips for Philippine All Stars — and vice versa\n\nSarah Feldberg |\n\nIn every Olympics there are defining moments – performances that make such a strong statement any competitor preceding them is immediately forgotten and any who follow are watched with unavoidable skepticism. Nothing compares. Game friggin’ over. On Sunday, Aug. 3 at the Theatre for the Performing Arts at Planet Hollywood, I watched as hip-hop crew the Philippine All Stars created just such a moment. Before a crowd of approximately 2,000, they rocked, jumped and flipped with unmatched intensity. The audience literally gasped as choreographer and crew leader Ken Jhons plucked a dancer from the ground and raised him above his head on a single arm, holding him aloft like a hunter with a prize kill, before discarding him back onto the stage. With silver-lined black vinyl trench coats flying around them, the All Stars looked like a comic book street gang, ready to throw down a dance battle at the ...\n\nread more...\n\nMaheu was a treasure trove of Vegas history\n\nJohn Katsilometes |\n\nIt would be tempting to say Las Vegas lost a piece of its history when Bob Maheu died last night at age 91. Maheu was for years Howard Hughes’ right-hand man and alter-ego during the years Hughes was holed up on the top floor of the Desert Inn, which Hughes eventually purchased so he wouldn’t have to leave (and so he could shed some annoying tax problems). But what we lost was a historic figure; Maheu was always ready to share his vivid memories of Old Vegas and his years with Hughes. I interviewed him a few times, most recently for this story, which appeared months ago about the Mob in Vegas, which ran in Las Vegas Weekly. I also talked to him in April 2000 for a story in the Las Vegas Sun centering on the 50th anniversary of the Desert Inn. At the time, Steve Wynn was only ...\n\nread more...\n\nMe talk dirty one day\n\nDirty talk is a fine art that apparently incites great arousal -- and loosens wallets. At work, I’ve studied it and made attempts to use it properly but I certainly haven’t mastered this skill. I barely understand the appeal, but I am trying to figure out its proper usage. Through witnessing some conversations by dirty talk experts (experienced strippers) and through my own trial and error, I have discovered that there are a few basic ingredients to structure some dirty talk. Trials have resulted mostly in error but I’m learning the ropes, slowly but surely. So take notes. You might spice up your own social interactions with a few lessons I can share by my observations in the field. At this point in my college career, I’ve really taken too many anthropology classes for my own good. Dirty talk may or may not be structured in the form of a ...\n\nread more...\n\nAmplify!! 2008 showcase schedule\n\nLas Vegas Weekly Staff |\n\nDowntown Las Vegas will be rocking to an independent beat this week as Amplify!!
