        "text": "\"From the slums of Shaolin, Wu-Tang Clan strikes again. The RZA, the GZA, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, Raekwon the Chef, U-God, Ghostface Killah, and the Method Man…\"\n\nDepending on which hip-hop purist you consult, the year 1989 is often regarded by most as the year that the Golden Age of hip-hop truly kicked off. By 1993, every corner of the culture was occupied by new talent experimenting in the hopes of reinventing a constantly evolving wheel. It was the year that Snoop Dogg (then Doggy Dogg), Onyx, Mobb Deep, Fat Joe, Digable Planets, The Roots, and many other burgeoning legends would drop their debut albums, along with classic collectives like Black Moon and Souls of Mischief.\n\nArtists like A Tribe Called Quest, Queen Latifah, Tupac Shakur, Cypress Hill, Run-D.M.C., and Naughty By Nature were seasoned by this point—on their second and third albums—toying with the idea of penetrating the impenetrable mainstream. Think “Electric Relaxation,” “U.N.I.T.Y.,” “I Get Around,” “Insane In the Brain,” “Down With the King,” and “Hip Hop Hooray,” respectively. We wouldn’t meet Nas until the following year, Jay Z until two years after that, right before we would lose Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. in fatal shootings within six months of each other in 1996 and 1997. We could call 1993 the calm before the storm, though the year was far from timid.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PEnwXYJcSZc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nRight before the year closed out, a super posse from Staten Island hit the scene with a vengeance. In one breath they were masked, referencing Kung Fu flicks and nods to textbook academics turned street philosophies. In the next, they were dressed for New York City’s frigid elements, detailing hardships with poise, yet punctuating their pain with pure threatening bars. They were the mighty Wu-Tang Clan, and they were \"nuthing ta F' wit.\"\n\nTheir collective debut album Enter The Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers was far from a novice introduction. Members like the GZA already had some entry level success back in ’91 under the name Prince Rakeem with his cheeky single “Ooh I Love You Rakeem.” RZA was perfecting the first layer of his production aesthetic, while other members had already been toying with lyricism for years and street life that would later birth the album’s intimately epochal bars.\n\nRecording the album was like the Hunger Games. Years back, I spoke with Masta Killa—who only appears on the track “Da Mystery of Chessboxin’”—and explained it was a matter of who jumped in the box and brought the best bars. The winners showed up on the track. His cleanup verse is arguably the stuff of legend, but his other more experienced counterparts at the time ended up with the stronger presence.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pJk0p-98Xzc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nSonically, the album was purposefully cinematic. In my interview with RZA for Playboy, he explains that intention, thanks to new technology:\n\nOne thing about the album that a lot of people don’t know is that Pro Tools was new. We were able to take that album after all the songs was recorded, and I was able to stitch it together like a movie. And it was only because I was able to go to a Pro Tools studio—I think it was called Magic Studio or something like that down in SoHo/Chinatown border. Because I was able to do that, I was able to take any sound, stitch any Kung-Fu sample to the song, and put the sword slices over the words. I was able to do that in a poignant time where maybe a lot of producers wasn’t thinking like a movie editor would think. Pro Tools gave me that ability.\n\nTrack-by-track, the project rewrites hip-hop history in its own unique way.\n\nThe deepest album cuts are arguably the first four tracks “Bring Da Ruckus,” “Shame On a N***a,” “Clan In Da Front,” and “Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber”: all rooted in boom-bap, volleying between knockin’ beats, menacing horns, and precise record scratches. The result is a collection of tracks that all demanded head nods. The album closes in a similar way as it begins, with “Wu-Tang 7th Chamber, Pt. 2/Conclusion.”\n\nBut the in-between is the heart of the project. “Can It Be All So Simple,” “C.R.E.A.M.,” and “Tearz” all utilize soul samples in a way that had previously never been done before, creating a trifecta of tracks that detail everything from the harsh realities of coming up poor to losing loved ones to violence and AIDS. The soul in the production is used for an added layer of emotional emphasis.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBwAxmrE194\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n“That was the first attempt to show, like, the emotional flow of an emcee,” RZA told me of “Tearz,” as the Wendy Rene (“After Laughter (Comes Tears)”) sample assists in what RZA calls a “gut-gripping sound.”\n\nOther songs like the aforementioned “Da Mystery of Chessboxin’,” “Wu-Tang Clan Ain’t Nuthing ta F’ Wit,” and “Protect Ya Neck” are all threatening in their own rights, challenging opponents either lyrically or physically with flecks of Kung Fu. The intro to the album’s biggest single “Method Man,” makes light of those threats, despite being titled “Torture.”\n\nAll of these pieces formed the perfect puzzle, set to the backdrop of 1993. Harnessing the power of the street life that Mobb Deep was first learning to perfect, coupled with the aggression of Onyx, the soulfulness of A Tribe Called Quest, the humor of Snoop Doggy Dogg, mixed with unintentional commercial appeal, Wu-Tang Clan created the album that embodied that era. By the next year (and the ones thereafter), everything would change. The Clan would begin their solo runs, only to reunite for Wu-Tang Forever in 1997, which earned a nomination for Best Rap Album for the 40th GRAMMY Awards. And as for the rest of hip-hop, well, those “same damn ‘Lo sweaters” would be traded for shiny suits before the turn of the century.\n\nEnter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers was a period piece that played out like a movie, plotlines, action scenes, and all. And it’s one that true fans would still pay admission to witness, even 25 years later.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Wk12LKkfy0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nNew Documentary To Celebrate 25 Years Of Wu-Tang Clan\n\nSince its release, Enter The Wu-Tang has sold more than 3 million records and landed on countless all-time best album rankings. As of June 2023, the album is at the No. 27 spot on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Of All Time list. For its relatively short length, Wu-Tang Clan's debut has had an outsized impact on hip-hop — both in terms of influence and the trajectory of its members.\n\nWith Enter The Wu-Tang and their subsequent releases, Wu-Tang cornered the rap market in the 1990s. Before Wu-Tang, there were no other notable rap acts from Staten Island. While Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx held most of the industry’s grip, Wu-Tang helped blaze the path for acts outside of those regions to flourish.\n\nWhile groups like Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, N.W.A. and Run-D.M.C. are certainly influential, the star power within Wu-Tang is unique. Between the group’s debut and follow-up album Wu-Tang Forever — which was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 1998 GRAMMYs — GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Ol' Dirty Bastard, and others released critically acclaimed solo albums.\n\nMethod Man even received a Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group GRAMMY for Tical’s \"I'll Be There For You/You're All I Need To Get By\" at the 1995 GRAMMYs. Outside the accolades, Raekwon’s Only Built For Cuban Links and Ghostface’s Ironman lit up the New York streets in 1995, and GZA’s Liquid Swords remains one of the more acclaimed outings from the group’s more withdrawn characters.\n\nWhile some were more commercially successful than others, they all added to the group's influence and arguably proved its distinction for best rap group of all time.\n\nRead more: RZA’s Constant Elevation: From Wu-Tang to 'Kill Bill,' The Rapper/Producer Discusses His Creative Process And History Ahead Of Bobby Digital Reprise\n\nMethod and New Jersey legend Redman brought their comedic chops to the big screen in How High. The pairing was like a hip-hop Cheech and Chong, and the film went on to become a cult weed movie classic. Like Meth, RZA and other members appeared in TV shows and films for decades.\n\nIn 1995, Wu-Tang Clan established the apparel brand Wu Wear, one of the first artist-inspired lines in music history. It opened the doors for hip-hop culture in retail, and inspired a global interest in Wu-Tang's simple, raw style. The group and the apparel line helped usher in the militant street style of the era, complete with baggy jeans, oversized t-shirts, Timberland boots, durags, gold fronts, sports jerseys, and puff jackets.\n\nAs the group grew in popularity, the members joined forces with business partner Oliver \"Power\" Grant and opened four Wu Wear stores across the country, including one on Victory Boulevard in Staten Island. The line was carried by retail giants such as Macy’s and renamed Wu-Tang Brand in 2008, and Grant discontinued the Wu-Wear line. But after RZA joined hands with Live Nation Merchandise, the brand was relaunched in 2017.\n\nMass immigration from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic in the 1950s made the Bronx the first majority Black and Latino borough in NYC by the mid-'70s. It’s not a coincidence that the Bronx was also woefully unserved by the city government, resulting in bleak economic conditions.\n\n\"Kids with little or no resources created something out of nothing,\" the Funky Four Plus One’s MC Sha Rock told ABC News said of hip-hop's origins. \"No matter what was going on around us in New York City at the time, we looked forward to the park jams.\"\n\nThese jams featured breakdancing, DJs mixing, and MCing — all key elements of hip-hop that emerged from house parties and underground venues into a city-wide consciousness. \"Hip-hop wasn't called hip-hop in the ‘70s, was called 'going to the jams,'\" Sha Rock continued.\n\nA few years before the park jams took off, DJ Kool Herc’s August 1973 rec room party put hip-hop as we know it on the map. Herc took classic records and popular hits, broke down the beats, and invited MCs to chime in over them invoking the Jamaican style of delivery, talking or chanting, usually in a monotone melody, over a rhythm known as \"toasting\" in reggae.\n\nIn 1975, the Bronx Boys Rocking Crew (or TBB) fostered another element of hip-hop when they organized late night tagging sessions. These young graffiti artists brought the color and life of their borough to the rest of the city, as painted subway trains provided moving canvases and controversy.\n\nBy the time the park jams were happening, some graffiti crews had expanded into competitive dance. With moves drawn from martial arts, gymnastics, and modern dance, \"breaking, popping, and locking\" would see b-boys and b-girls become as important as music to hip-hop as an art form. Breaking as an art has continued to flourish and will soon be an Olympic sport.\n\nBronx-born artists such as the Funky Four Plus One, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, Melle Mel and Kurtis Blow became pioneers of the genre in the 1970s, and helped define hip-hop in the '80s.\n\nThe borough would go on to boast Kool Keith, KRS One, Big Pun, Fat Joe, and Cardi B, among many others, as acts who have innovated the Bronx’s place in hip-hop culture. The borough is now home to the Universal Hip-Hop Museum and will host events at Sedgwick and a 50 Years of Hip-Hop concert at Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe largest Borough by area, Queens boasts the Guiness World Record for most languages spoken and gained the nickname \"The World’s Borough\" for its diverse population. Whereas Bronx hip-hop was derived from Black American and Caribbean cultures, Queen’s hip-hop samples the world. While the 1970s saw the Bronx give birth to hip-hop, the 1980s saw the eastern borough of Queens mature the art form.\n\nQueen’s hip-hop history has roots in two specific areas: the Queenborough Projects and Hollis. The Queensboro Projects, a.k.a. \"The Bridge,\" were one of the few unsegregated projects in New York. It was also home to Marley Marl, who accidentally discovered sampling while working on a Captain Rock record as a studio intern in the early ‘80s.\n\n\"I was actually trying to get a riff off of a record. I made a mistake and got the snare in there before the sound came,\" he recounted to NPR. \"The snare sounded better than the snare that I had from the drum machine when I was popping it…I was like, \"Hold up!\" This will enable me to take any kick and a snare from any record that people love and make my own beat.\" Marls’ use of the 808 pulse to trigger different samplers was revolutionary, and he would become a pioneer for his ability to blend sampled and 808 drum sounds.\n\nMarl’s contribution would extend beyond the technical. As a member of the Juice Crew, he brought the voice of 14-year-old Roxanne Shanté to the world. She created a new lane for women in rap as well as the blueprint for the diss track on the seminal \"Roxanne's Revenge.\"\n\nAbout a half hour east on the F Train in Hollis, Queens, brothers Joseph and Russel Simmons (a DJ and promoter respectively) founded Run-D.M.C. with friends Darryl Mc Daniels and Jason Mizell. Run-D.M.C.'s sound featured a synchronized, aggressive delivery over simple but memorable rock hooks and beats. Later, the group established Def Jam Records, the label that would prove rap could sell millions of records to Top 40 audiences and bring rap to the mainstream as the first rappers to be featured on MTV.\n\nAs valuable as the musical contributions of Run-D.M.C are, they are equally vital to the development of fashion as an element of hip-hop. Street style, as it would come to be known, is born in Queens: Kangol hats, unlaced Addias, Carzal frames, and thick gold chains are now as synonymous with hip-hop as beats and samples. Today, fashion is so central to hip-hop, and vice versa, that New York's FIT Museum recently held an expansive exhibit on hip-hop style.”\n\nComplex proclaimed Nas’ Illmatic \"set off a seismic shift in rap geopolitics\" and added that the 1994 record \"galvanized Queensbridge hip-hop and by extension East Coast rap as a whole.\" His introspective and poetic approach to writing is credited for bringing the best out of his contemporaries and inspiring next generation rappers like Killer Mike and Kendrick Lamar, challenging them to meet his lyrical bar.\n\nIt's rare that a genre can be traced back to a single artist or group, but for funk, that was James Brown. The Godfather of Soul coined the phrase and style of playing known as \"on the one,\" where the first downbeat is emphasized, instead of the typical second and fourth beats in pop, soul and other styles. As David Cheal eloquently explains, playing on the one \"left space for phrases and riffs, often syncopated around the beat, creating an intricate, interlocking grid which could go on and on.\" You know a funky bassline when you hear it; its fat chords beg your body to get up and groove.\n\nBrown's 1965 classic, \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,\" became one of the first funk hits, and has been endlessly sampled and covered over the years, along with his other groovy tracks. Of course, many other funk acts followed in the '60s, and the genre thrived in the '70s and '80s as the disco craze came and went, and the originators of hip-hop and house music created new music from funk and disco's strong, flexible bones built for dancing.\n\nLegendary funk bassist Bootsy Collins learned the power of the one from playing in Brown's band, and brought it to George Clinton, who created P-funk, an expansive, Afrofuturistic, psychedelic exploration of funk with his various bands and projects, including Parliament-Funkadelic. Both Collins and Clinton remain active and funkin', and have offered their timeless grooves to collabs with younger artists, including Kali Uchis, Silk Sonic, and Omar Apollo; and Kendrick Lamar, Flying Lotus, and Thundercat, respectively.\n\nIn the 1980s, electro-funk was born when artists like Afrika Bambaataa, Man Parrish, and Egyptian Lover began making futuristic beats with the Roland TR-808 drum machine — often with robotic vocals distorted through a talk box. A key distinguishing factor of electro-funk is a de-emphasis on vocals, with more phrases than choruses and verses. The sound influenced contemporaneous hip-hop, funk and electronica, along with acts around the globe, while current acts like Chromeo, DJ Stingray, and even Egyptian Lover himself keep electro-funk alive and well.\n\nToday, funk lives in many places, with its heavy bass and syncopated grooves finding way into many nooks and crannies of music. There's nu-disco and boogie funk, nodding back to disco bands with soaring vocals and dance floor-designed instrumentation. G-funk continues to influence Los Angeles hip-hop, with innovative artists like Dam-Funk and Channel Tres bringing the funk and G-funk, into electro territory. Funk and disco-centered '70s revival is definitely having a moment, with acts like Ghost Funk Orchestra and Parcels, while its sparkly sprinklings can be heard in pop from Dua Lipa, Doja Cat, and, in full \"Soul Train\" character, Silk Sonic. There are also acts making dreamy, atmospheric music with a solid dose of funk, such as Khruangbin’s global sonic collage."
