        "text": "Constructor: Kevin G. Der\n\nRelative difficulty: Easy\n\nTHEME: \"Story Circle\" — An Arthurian Legend puzzle. Circled squares in the middle of the grid form a kind of ring. Each circled square contains the word \"SIR,\" and collectively those squares signify the KNIGHTS OF / THE ROUND TABLE (14D: With 76-Down, 1953 Ava Gardner film as depicted elsewhere in this puzzle?) [NOTE: apparently the rebus (\"SIR\") squares were NOT circled in the dead-tree version of the puzzle. Failure to standardize the puzzle appearance across the different formats = tiresome incompetence.]\n\nWord of the Day: LATRIA (122D: Highest form of worship in Catholicism) — Latrīa is a Latin term (from the Greek λατρεια) used in Orthodox and Catholic theology to mean adoration, which is the highest form of worship or reverence and is directed only to the Holy Trinity. (wikipedia)\n\n-----\n\nAn ambitious puzzle, with two different theme levels (long answers and rebus) an oversized grid (23x23) and L/R (as opposed to the normal rotational) symmetry. With a big, multi-layered production like this, it feels as if Mr. DER is auditioning to become the next Liz Gorski — and doing a pretty fine job of it. I have taught college courses on Arthurian Literature, so this one was about as solidly in my wheelhouse as any puzzle ever will be, but I think that all of the titles involved should be familiar enough to virtually anyone that the theme itself should have posed much of a problem. Further, of all the rebus puzzles I've seen before, this one was probably the easiest to detect and solve. I got the entirety of A CONNECTICUT YANKEE / IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT the first time I looked at the clue, with only a handful of the first two or three letters in place, and I knew instantly that those circled squares in the middle must have something to do with the Round Table. Thankfully, there were enough zigs and zags in the puzzle, enough thorny cluing and odd little words, to keep the solving experience interesting. The grid is a kind of architectural marvel. He stacked 15-letter theme answers right on top of each other. I don't think I've ever seen that done. As with any architectural marvel, there were some compromises in the fill — a few that made me wince a little — but overall, the puzzle gets a very solid thumbs-up.\n\nTheme answers:\n\n137A: 1963 animated film with the song \"Higitus Figitus,\" with \"The\" (\"SWORD IN THE STONE\")\n\n143A: 1998 animated film featuring the voice of Pierce Brosnan (\"QUEST FOR CAMELOT\")\n\n2D: 1984 film in which Helen Mirren plays a sorceress (\"EXCALIBUR\") — side note: I am watching movies from 1969 right now (arbitrary, yes, but it's leading to some amazing discoveries), and I just finished Michael Powell's \"Age of Consent,\" which was Mirren's first film. She was very young in that film (playing 17, but really in her early 20s, I think). Also brilliant and beautiful. Also quite naked. It's worth watching, is what I'm saying.\n\n4D: With 12-Down, 1889 Twain novel (\"A CONNECTICUT YANKEE / IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT\")\n\n14D: With 76-Down, 1953 Ava Gardner film as depicted elsewhere in this puzzle? (\"KNIGHTS OF / THE ROUND TABLE\")\n\n71D: 2001 Anjelica Huston miniseries, with \"The\" (\"MISTS OF AVALON\") — here we come to my one quibble with this theme. The puzzle is already heavy on screen versions of stories. I don't know how popular this miniseries was, but I do know that the novel \"Mists of Avalon\" by Marion Zimmer Bradley was phenomenally popular, and remains in print. I think the book, not the miniseries, should have been the basis of the clue (you could, if you'd really felt the need, added \"which was adapted into a 2001 miniseries\" or something like that). The very word \"miniseries\" feels laughable to me in the 21st century. It's not as if \"Mists of Avalon\" (2001) was \"Roots\" or \"The Thorn Birds.\"\n\nKevin Der's love of animated films (ask him about his job at Pixar) is evident in this puzzle. A little too evident for me, as I haven't seen \"Wall-E,\" and thus was perfectly willing to believe that 91A: Wall-E's love in \"Wall-E\" was something called EVO. The \"O\" came from AMON RA (78D: Supreme Egyptian deity), which is one of three (3) acceptable ways of spelling this particular god's name (AMON, AMUN, AMEN). It was only after grimacing at that answer (EVO) that I realized it might be something else. Obviously EVE is the only reasonable *human* name that fits the in the \"Wall-E\" answer, but if your clue is asking for a robot name, then there's no reason EVO might not be perfectly reasonable, esp. when the cross (in this case \"O\") is rock solid.\n\nBullets:\n\n16A: Sky Chief company (Texaco) — no idea what Sky Chief is. I see now that it is some olde-timey brand of gasoline. I'm assuming that it couldn't make your car fly.\n\n28A: 2001 headline maker (Enron) — I had ELIAN. Off by a year or so.\n\n33A: Michael of \"Juno\" and \"Superbad\" (Cera) — if you are buying stock in crossword answers, I recommend investing in CERA. CERA and MALIA are my Hott Pickz of the Week! (CERA gained fame in the TV show \"Arrested Development\" and is now something close to a legitimate movie star — very funny).\n\n53A: Tulsa sch. (ORU) — Oral Roberts U.\n\n55A: Subject of a tipster's tip (nag) — my brain died on this one. I had NAG and still couldn't figure out what it meant. I was thinking of someone giving a \"tip\" in a criminal investigation. NAG is, of course, a horse.\n\n56A: Joe Montana or Jerry Rice, informally (Niner) — as in San Francisco 49er. I was born in SF, so I should have been a fan, but never was. Could've backed a winner. But no. I backed the Seahawks. Still do. So sad.\n\n58A: Additions to a musical staff (bar lines) — these are the vertical lines that separate measures. Other BAR LINES: \"Come here often?\" and \"What's your sign?\"\n\n60A: _____ but when (not if) — for some reason, I Love this clue.\n\n69A: Dried seaweed in Japanese cuisine (kombu) — that's a pretty foodie answer. It's familiar, but only vaguely.\n\n100A: Tandoor flatbreads (nans) — I've never seen this pluralized with an \"S\"; looks about as good as \"breads\"; \"Can we get some more breads, please?\" \"No, you cannot.\"\n\n105A: Bones may be found in it (stock) — another great clue. So many possible answers, and this one was dead on.\n\n127A: Island where Sundanese and Madurese are spoken (Java) — Mmm, sundae-nese. I would like to speak that right now (and it's only 7:36 a.m.)\n\n136A: Operatic heroine wooed by Beckmesser (Eva) — no idea. All from crosses. EVE and EVA were clearly out to get me today.\n\n151A: Org. in Clancy's \"Red Storm Rising\" (NSA) — Never read a Tom Clancy book. I imagine that the Red Storm is something bad and possibly Communist... yes. Tom Clancy is also a big name in video games, and this novel provided the name for Clancy's game development company, Red Storm Entertainment.\n\n3D: Onetime MTV animated title character and others (Darias) — really? There's more than one DARIA? Can you name one?\n\n5D: Weathercast figure (low) — cool, unusual cluing.\n\n17D: Relative of a grapefruit (ugli) — a hybridized grapefruit and tangerine, in case anyone asks.\n\n20D: Bilbao bloom (flor) — took me a few passes. Thought the answer would be a particular kind of FLOR.\n\n37D: River that flows past more than 40 castles (Rhine) — interesting stat. That's a Lot of castles.\n\n63A: \"Winnie _____ Pu\" (\"Ille\") — one of my most hated bits of fill. An absolute, hail mary, nothing else will work here answer. Someone should make a robot movie called \"Ill-E\" so that this answer becomes more legit.\n\n66D: Pot-_____ (French stew) (au feu) — Parlez-VOUS français? (112D). Today, it would help if you did.\n\n69D: Conductor Lockhart and others (Keiths) — no clue. Oh, he's conductor of the Boston Pops. Huh. Interesting. With Fiedler gone, I don't think the Boston Pops are nearly as well known any more (outside Boston) as this clue thinks they are.\n\n108D: 1971 Peace Nobelist from Germany (Brandt) — man, there was a Lot I didn't know today. Why was this puzzle so easy, then?\n\n117D: Heroine in Verdi's \"Il Trovatore\" (Leonora) — not sure I knew this either, but she's got a very Poe-esque name, so I pieced it together pretty easily.\n\n123D: Antisub weapon (ashcan) — isn't this slang?\n\n133D: What an inflectional ending is added to (stem) — very nice STEM clue.\n\n134D: Certain netizen (AOLer) — up there with ILLE on the answera non grata list.\n\nAnd now, time for the \"Puzzle Tweets of the Week\" (Twitter chatter about Crosswords):\n\nNatron602 I want a gorgeous brunette foreign girl to hang out in bed in her panties while I do crossword puzzles. is this a lame fantasy?\n\nFaina_I Doing a crossword in a Starbucks, and a kid is staring at me through the window.

Similar to a camporee, a jamboree occurs less often and draws units from the entire nation or world. (wikipedia)\n\n-----\n\nHey, it's the greatest constructor on the planet. That's a hard title to live up to day in day out. I liked this puzzle a lot as I worked my way through the top, but then somewhat less by the time I hit the bottom. It's got a lovely, smooth, swirly quality that I kind of like. Then again, it kind of reminds me of an intestine. It's even got a BUTT (24A: You might grind it out) at one end (the wrong end ... sorry, I never know where my mind is going to go when I start typing). My main problem with this grid is its heavy reliance on proper nouns, particularly names. And I'm a name-lover, generally. But they're clogging up the NE something awful — DAN'L is one of those answers I accept as occasionally inevitable in high-caliber grid, but it's super-sub-optimal (23A: \"Young _____ Boone\" (short-lived 1970s TV series)). GUSTAVE Courbet is famous enough (11D: French painter Courbet), but the TURNER guy is a mystery to me (13D: Pulitzer-winning historian Frederick Jackson _____). The main point here is that normally you don't want to logjam proper nouns, as the \"knowitoryadon't\"-ness of names can really make a puzzle undoable if you're not careful.\n\nIn the case of the NE name logjam, there was nothing offensive. But warning lights went off. In the SW, however, I let out a YELP and then censors had to BLEEP me a little as I filled in the answer SYMS (35D: \"_____ by Sinatra\" (1982 collaborative jazz album)), an unfamiliar and dubious-looking name. I checked and rechecked those crosses, and finally decided it had to be right, no matter how nuts it looked. Turns out the SYMS in \"SYMS by Sinatra\" is Sylvia SYMS. She's the singer. Sinatra's the conductor! Interesting. The \"Y\" from YELP was the last letter I put in this section, though the \"P\" was slightly suspect too, as CAMPOREE was new to me. So uncertain was I of this word that I wondered for a second whether there weren't such things as YELB and JANTABILE (that would have given me JAMBOREE, a word I recognize) (29A: Musical direction that means \"lyrical\" in Italian => CANTABILE).\n\nAfter taking the SPIRAL STAIRCASE (43A: It gets you up and around) across the southern portion of the grid, I figured I'd make short work of that last little bit in the SE. I figured wrong. First I had to wrestle with two names I didn't know, PAXTON (42A: Folk singer Tom with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award) and PAYNE (34D: Max of video game fame). The latter was at least a little familiar to me, the former not at all. Worked my way to the tippy top of this puzzle's tail and ended up with TUP as a [Snooping aid]. Made no sense to me. At this point, I checked all the crosses ... and decided they were all rock solid. Rock Solid. Now, this is where having your brain *fully* turned on can help you. If you had to organize words or phrases into categories, it's very easy to see how you (I) might group [Maximally] and UTMOST together. They sound very much related. Problem 1, they are not the same part of speech (adverb vs. adj./noun). Problem 2 ... well problem 2 is that TUP is just BLEEPing wrong. If the clue had been about the reproductive habits of sheep, then maybe. But [snooping aid]? No.\n\nMy favorite part of this stupid mistake is my initial solution: Change the \"T\" to a \"C.\" [Snooping aid] = CUP, as in the CUP you hold to your ear and press to the door when you want to hear what's happening on the other side. Does that even work? I saw it on an episode of \"Growing Pains\" once. This gave me CARTARS, which then sent me searching for ways I could turn CARTARS into [Medieval conquerors]. Changed BARMY (39A: Foolish, in British slang) to BALMY: CALTARS! OK, now we're getting ... somewhere. A few moments later and I was like \"screw it,\" it must be TUP. I then emailed fellow blogger Orange and asked what the hell was going on with 32A: Snooping aid. Her answer: \"wiretap.\" Me: \"Oh ... but ... ohhhhhhhhh ... TAP ... I see ... now. 'AT MOST.' Yeah, that makes sense.\" The end. I thought the puzzle overall was on the easy side, but at this point in my solving career, failure is failure is failure. Still, overall, thumbs up for the puzzle.\n\nBullets:\n\n16A: Bloomer after whom bloomers are named (Amelia) — more names! I got this with a cross or two, though if pressed I couldn't tell you who the hell she is. Aha, a 19th-century woman's rights and temperance advocate. Wife (19c. American historian) will surely laugh at me for not knowing that. And she will be right to do so.\n\n30A: Actor who debuted in \"Kung Fu: The Movie\" (Brandon Lee) — more names. This name was far better known 16 years ago, when BRANDON LEE, son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, died on the set of what would become his most famous movie, \"The Crow.\" Accidental shooting due to prop gun malfunction (brought on by negligence, I'm guessing).\n\n35A: Activities at punk rock concerts (slam dances) — forerunners of mosh pits.\n\n48A: Words from one who won't settle (\"See you in court!\") — nice that this crosses SUE (45D: Good name for a trial lawyer).\n\n3D: Diagonally set spar (sprit) — I learned SPRIT from crosswords. This is how I learned most nautical words I know.\n\n7D: Spike's former name (TNN) — yes, Spike is a TV station. I get TNT and TNN badly confused.\n\n9D: Bibliog. equivalent of \"ditto\" (ibid.) — wow, \"bibliog.\" sure is ugly. Sounds like a name from Tolkien. Like a hobbit-orc hybrid.\n\n15D: Fish that can move equally well forward and backward (eels) — that clue really sounds like it wants a singular answer. But no!\n\n22D: Fluid dynamics phenomenon (eddies) — the \"S\"-shape of the grid and the swirliness of EDDIES and the SPIRAL STAIRCASE are all working together to produce a kind of deliciously dizzying subtheme. \"EELS in the EDDIES\" = #rejectedhorrormovies.\n\n25D: Convertible carriage (landau) — another crossword pick-up for me. Crosswords are the only places where carriages still exist. Look out for surrey and hansom.\n\n36D: Reaganomics recommendation (tax cut) — More evidence the NYT is a leftist paper: this answer intersects BARMY.\n\nSigned, Rex Parker, King of CrossWorld\n\n[Follow Rex Parker on Twitter]\n\nP.S. my write-up of today's L.A. Times puzzle is here. Read more...\n\nConstructors: Gary & Stephen Kennedy\n\nRelative difficulty: Challenging\n\nTHEME: \"WHO LET THE DOGS OUT\" (7D: Hit song from 2000 ... and a hint to 10 symmetrically arranged Across answers) — 10 different answers have the word \"DOG\" in them somewhere, but for each one, you have to take the \"DOG\" out in order to fit the answer in the grid.\n\nWord of the Day: MAGLEV (20A: Bullet train type) — Maglev, or magnetic levitation, is a system of transportation that suspends, guides and propels vehicles, predominantly trains, using magnetic levitation from a very large number of magnets for lift and propulsion. This method has the potential to be faster, quieter and smoother than wheeled mass transit systems. The technology has the potential to exceed 6,400 km/h (4,000 mi/h) if deployed in an evacuated tunnel.[1] If not deployed in an evacuated tube the power needed for levitation is usually not a particularly large percentage and most of the power needed is used to overcome air drag, as with any other high speed train. (wikipedia)\n\n-----\n\nHaven't disliked a puzzle this much in a while. Just miserable to solve. I had the main theme answer, \"WHO LET THE DOGS OUT,\" very early, and still couldn't figure out what the hell was going on for a while. There are so many problems here. First, the song. One of the worst, most painful ear worms you can possibly give someone. Second, the lyrics, which undermine the intentions of this puzzle.\n\nSee? There are dogs in the song, just as there are dogs in the video. You can hear them. They bark. They also pant. People are asking \"WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?\" not because the dogs have been abducted or have magically disappeared, but because they are *running amok*. Roaming packs, in the streets, up to no good. Dogs Everywhere. So, in making DOGs invisible, this puzzle theme runs directly against the spirit of the song. Further, there are at least two dogs in this damned puzzle, so the puzzle is a lie. A self-contradiction. If there are no dogs, then tell !@#$ing REN and @!#@ing OTIS to get the @#$# off my lawn (17A: Neurotic cartoon character + 31A: Milo's canine pal). Even further still, there are dogs in the clues. Look, either the dogs are out, or they're not. You can't say they're out and then put \"pups\" or even \"animal\" in the clues. Well, you can, but it's crap. I get that \"DOG\" is being interpreted as a letter string today. I just don't like it. AT ALL (69A: One bit).\n\nFurther, the cluing overall was just off. Everywhere I turned, tortured stuff like 4D: With \"the\" and 32-Across, describing an old Matryoshka doll (made in / [the] / U.S.S.R.). This may be my most hated clue of all time. Any time you have to supply a mid-phrase word in your cute tie-in attempt, your cute tie-in is a failure and you need to try something else. \"With 'the' and some other answer\" is ugly and confusing. The fact that I have never heard of the doll in question didn't help my enjoyment level. Staying in Russia, some Russian guy name Alexander who popularized a chess opening? I'll take your word for it. Crosses were fair enough. I thought the mysterious Russian crap was continuing in the bullet train I'd never heard of, but as you can see from the above description, MAGLEV is short for \"magnetic levitation.\" Leaving the absurd Russian stuff behind, let's take a clue like 45D: Sitcom with the character B.J. (\"Reba\"). That is a non-clue. That is a horrible, unimaginative, nothing clue. About a quarter step better than if the clue had read [Sitcom with a character named Susan]. \"B.J.\" isn't terribly unusual or distinctive. [Kraft Foods drink] for TANG? Again, what? Do ... something. Make it distinctive. Interesting. Relevant. This puzzle feels like a bad imitation of a clever Thursday puzzle.\n\nTheme answers:\n\n1A: Show-off (hot dog)\n\n9A: U.S. Marine (devil dog)\n\n15A: Leader of the pack (alpha dog)\n\n34A: Animal control officer (dog catcher)\n\n36A: Folded corner (dog ear)\n\n46A: G.I.'s ID (dog tag)\n\n47A: Person who raises and sells pups (dog breeder)\n\n70A: One falling into good fortune (lucky dog)\n\n72A: Old sailor (salty dog)\n\n74A: Cutthroat (dog eat dog)\n\nHere's what I liked: VISCERA (25A: Innards) and KASHMIR (23D: K2 locale) and OPEN UP! (60A: Cry that may accompany pounding).\n\nBullets:\n\n49A: City containing a country (Rome) — contains Vatican City, the smallest country in the world.\n\n73A: Animal in a lodge (otter) — ???? Acc. to wikipedia, \"The collective nouns for otters are bevy, family, lodge or romp.\" Is this common knowledge? I've spent many a day at the Monterey Bay Aquarium looking at the otters, yet somehow missed this bit of information.\n\n11D: She-foxes (vixens) — this word is good. I feel like there was a hair band from the 80s with the name \"VIXEN\" ... oh yeah. Bingo. [best youtube comment seen while searching for this video: \"I'm gay, and there are only 5 women I would go straight for: REBA McEntire, and the ladies in Vixen.\"]\n\n21D: Super Bowl of 2023 (LVII) — mmm, arbitrary future events.\n\n37D: With 48-Down, for example, south of the border (por / ejemplo) — more cross-referencing confusion. Thought \"for example\" was a cue, not the meat of the clue.\n\n54D: Feature of a pleasant summer day (zephyr) — I'm reading an epic Osamu Tezuka comic from the late 60s called \"Swallowing the Earth.\" The hero/villain is a woman named \"Zephyrus.\" Super-disturbing and highly recommended. Hard to go wrong with Tezuka.\n\nSigned, Rex Parker, King of CrossWorld\n\n[Follow Rex Parker on Twitter] Read more..."
