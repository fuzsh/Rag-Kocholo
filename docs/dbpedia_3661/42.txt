Born in East L.A. is a 1987 American comedy film written and directed by Cheech Marin of the Cheech & Chong comedy team.

The film is about a Mexican-American from East Los Angeles who is mistaken for an illegal alien and deported. It is based on a 1984 novelty parody song of Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A." and "I Love L.A." by Randy Newman. Written by Marin and released on the 1985 Cheech & Chong album Get Out of My Room, the parody was made a music video the same year. Marin used the song as the basis of his first solo film.
