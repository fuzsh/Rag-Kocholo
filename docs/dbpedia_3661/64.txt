Cheech and Chong had 3 Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 comedy record hits in 1973-1974: "Basketball Jones Featuring Tyrone Shoelaces", "Sister Mary Elephant - SHUDDUP!", and "Earache My Eye Featuring Alice Bowie". The duo missed hitting the Top 40 (but came close) in 1978 with "Bloat On" and in 1985 with "Born in East L.A.".

I used to love Cheech & Chong but I got tired of them at some point during the past 25 years or so. I still love their first movie.

Incidentally, they made a cameo appearance in Hoyt Axton's version of The No No Song (it became a hit by Ringo Starr but Axton wrote it).
