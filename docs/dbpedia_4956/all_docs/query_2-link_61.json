        "text": "We had a young team out were missing a few of our experienced players but still no excuses, the better team won. We were beaten up front and missed too many crucial tackles which let the light blues in for soft try's. We battled hard right to the end and prevented them from getting a fourth bonus point try but too many errors when we we attacking did not help our cause. I have to say the garyowen back row were very strong and powerful and did all the damage with Barry o'mahony to the fore.\n\nCome along this Saturday to Thomond park and support your local club.\n\nWe have a great supporters special offer for the Shannon V Galwegians match.
