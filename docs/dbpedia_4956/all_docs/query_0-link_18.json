        "text": "Rugby team in Ireland\n\nRugby team\n\nMunster Rugby (Irish: Rugbaí Mumhan) is one of the professional provincial rugby teams from the island of Ireland. They compete in the United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup. The team represents the IRFU's Munster Branch, which is responsible for rugby union throughout the Irish province of Munster. The team motto is \"To the brave and faithful, nothing is impossible.\" This is derived from the motto of the MacCarthy clan – \"Forti et Fideli nihil difficile\". Their main home ground is Thomond Park, Limerick, though some games are played at Musgrave Park, Cork.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFoundation and early years\n\n[edit]\n\nMunster was officially founded in 1879, at the same time as Leinster and Ulster, with Connacht being founded ten years later in 1889. The first interprovincial matches between Leinster, Ulster and Munster, however, were held in 1875. The founding of the Munster branch of the IRFU was intended to organise and oversee the game within the province and prevent any club bias by providing neutral selectors for the representative side. In amateur days, the four Irish provinces played against each other in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship and also played touring international sides.\n\nMunster traditionally drew its strength from the clubs of Limerick, with the game popular in the city and widely played at all levels. Teams such as Shannon, Garryowen and Young Munster built up fierce rivalries with one another, helping push standards in the province higher as a result.[3]\n\nGames against touring sides\n\n[edit]\n\nMunster has a great tradition of competitiveness and impassioned displays against touring sides. The first touring side to play Munster were the famous Original All Blacks led by Dave Gallaher, who lined out against Munster in the Markets Field, Limerick in November 1905. Munster were defeated that day 33–0. Throughout the years, Munster were to record a number of near-misses and last minute defeats against South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The first tangible result against a touring side was to come in 1958, when the Wallabies were held to a 3–3 draw in Thomond Park. Munster became the first Irish provincial side to defeat a major touring team when they defeated Australia 11–8 in Musgrave Park, Cork on 25 January 1967. Munster were captained that day by Tom Kiernan.[4][5]\n\nAgainst New Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nMunster first played the All Blacks in 1905, losing 33–0 on the occasion. They have played each other many times since then. Munster drew with New Zealand 3–3 in 1973 and, in 1978, became, at the time, the only Irish side to have beaten the All Blacks. The 12–0 victory occurred on Tuesday 31 October 1978 at Thomond Park, in front of a crowd of 12,000, though many times that number still claim to have been present, such was the occasion.[6] Christy Cantillon scored a try with Tony Ward converting. Ward also added a drop-goal in each half. Until the national team's victory on 5 November 2016, it was the only time an All Blacks team lost to any Irish side in the men's game and forms part of Munster Rugby mythology. A stage play named Alone it Stands (by John Breen) and a book entitled Stand Up and Fight: When Munster Beat the All Blacks by Alan English were both based on the event. Both have been commercially successful; Alone it Stands has had several sell-out runs in Ireland and abroad and Stand Up and Fight was a bestseller in 2005.[7]\n\nThe All Blacks returned to Thomond Park in November 2008 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 1978 match and to celebrate the opening of the new stadium. After 76 minutes of the match, Munster were winning 16–13, but a late try from Joe Rokocoko meant the All Blacks won 18–16.[8]\n\nOn 11 November 2016, Munster welcomed the Māori All Blacks to Thomond Park. The Māori players paid tribute to Anthony Foley by placing a jersey with his initials on the halfway line before performing the Haka. Māori captain Ash Dixon then presented the jersey to Foley's sons.[9] Munster went on to win the historic game 27–14.[10]\n\nOn 3 February 2024, Munster hosted a world first 'Clash of Champions' against the Crusaders, the 14-time champions of Super Rugby, at Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork. Munster edged out the Crusaders to win 21–19, having led 14–7 at half-time. The Crusaders were coached by Former Munster Head Coach Rob Penney.[11][12]\n\nAgainst Australia\n\n[edit]\n\nLike the All Blacks, Munster have played Australia many times. They first met in 1947, when Australia won 6–5. Munster claimed their first victory over the Wallabies in 1967 when they won 11–8. In 1992, Australia, then-reigning world champions having won the 1991 Rugby World Cup, visited Munster as part of a European tour. Munster won 22–19 in a rough encounter in Cork. Ten years later, London newspaper The Daily Telegraph recounted part of the legend in a feature on Munster prop Peter Clohessy: \"The then Wallabies coach, Bob Dwyer, who was not a man who readily accepted that opposition sides could legitimately score more points than his team, immediately branded the Munster number 3 a 'disgrace'. It had been a typically rugged, robust and memorable Munster triumph, with leather and fists flying on both sides. Clohessy, who wouldn't generally be known for misconduct, was no more guilty than the next man but world champions are not supposed to lose against a hastily assembled Irish provincial XV. There had to be a reason, an excuse, and Dwyer rounded on Clohessy\".[13]\n\nHistory repeated itself in 2010 when Munster defeated the Wallabies 15–6, with their Australian fly-half, Paul Warwick, kicking all fifteen points (three penalties and 2 drop goals).[14] The match was played in ferocious weather, with Munster playing into a gale-force wind and driving rain in the first-half. Indeed, the conditions made the half time score of 6–6 all the more significant, as Australia could neither cope with the weather nor the Munster pressure in the second-half.[15]\n\nAgainst South Africa\n\n[edit]\n\nMunster have played South Africa much less frequently than they have Australia and New Zealand. The first fixture between the two sides took place on 11 December 1951 in Thomond Park, with the visitors emerging with an 11–6 win after a late try broke the deadlock. South Africa returned to face the province for a second time on 22 December 1960, this time at Musgrave Park. They again secured a narrow win against the province, needing two late scores for a 9–3 win. The third meeting between the sides was less of a close-run thing, with South Africa easing to a 25–9 win in Thomond Park on 11 January 1970.[16][17]\n\nAfter the GAA Central Council unanimously backed the proposal, Munster confirmed they would face a South Africa XV in a friendly held at Cork GAA's 45,000-capacity Páirc Uí Chaoimh on 10 November 2022. It was the first time Munster have faced a South African national team in the professional era and the first time a game of rugby was held at the stadium.[18] The match was a 41,400 sell-out at Páirc Uí Chaoimh, making it the largest attendance for a rugby match in the province, and saw Munster secure their first ever win against South Africa in a 28–14 victory. Winger Shane Daly opened the scoring in just the 2nd minute, with fly-half Ben Healy converting to give the home side a 7–0 lead. South Africa hit back in the 12th minute through an Aphelele Fassi try that was converted by Johan Goosen to level the score, but Munster struck back with tries from Simon Zebo and Diarmuid Barron, both converted by Healy, to head into half-time with a 21–7. Munster struck early in the second-half, with fullback Mike Haley scoring after just two minutes and Healy's fourth conversion of the night extending their lead to 28–7. South Africa scored their second try in the 62nd minute when Sikhumbuzo Notshe crossed the try-line, converted by Gianni Lombard, but the visitors were unable to mount a comeback and Munster hung on to earn a famous win.[19][20]\n\nProfessional era\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Munster in European rugby\n\nOn 26 August 1995, the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an \"open\" game, removing all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game. This was done due to a committee conclusion that having an open game was the only way to end the hypocrisy of shamateurism, and keep control of the sport. The threat to amateur rugby union was mostly prevalent in the Southern hemisphere, particularly in Australia where Super League was threatening to entice players to rugby league with large salaries.[21] In Ireland, the four provincial teams were the only teams to go professional, while their smaller constituent clubs remained amateur.\n\nThe 1995–96 season saw the first ever Heineken Cup, a new tournament set up for European clubs. The Irish were allocated three places in the competition, with these places going to Leinster, Munster and Ulster. Munster finally reached the Heineken Cup quarter-finals in 1998–99 Heineken Cup, after three years of not being able to get out of the group stages.[22]\n\nNear-misses and European glory (1999–2009)\n\n[edit]\n\nMunster's first appearance in the Heineken Cup's final was in the 1999–2000 Heineken Cup, where they lost by one point to Northampton at Twickenham.[23] Nevertheless, the season was most memorable with a 31–25 win over Toulouse in Bordeaux.[24]\n\nTheir good form and bad luck continued in the following season, 2000–01, with a semi-final defeat to Stade Français, again by one point, where a try from John O'Neill was disallowed by the referee, as he deemed the ball to be out over the dead-ball line.[25] In the 2001–02 Heineken Cup, Munster lost the last match of their pool at Castres, but qualified as best runners-up.[26] Munster beat Stade Français 16–14 in Paris, the only try of the game coming from Anthony Horgan.[27] It was then on to Béziers to meet Castres again for the semi-final. Munster were triumphant and went to the final at Millennium Stadium to meet the reigning champions, Leicester.[28] Munster lost a tight game remembered as 'the hand of Back' final, as the Leicester flanker used his hand illegally in a scrum when Munster had a last-chance attack.[29] Munster also reached the final of the Celtic League in this season, but lost 24–20 to Leinster at Lansdowne Road, Dublin.[30]\n\nIn 2002–03, Munster reached the quarter-finals after a win against Gloucester, later issued on VHS under the title \"The Miracle Match\". In this game, Munster needed to win by a margin of at least 27 points and score a minimum of four tries to earn a quarter-final berth. They won 33–6 with four tries in a game that has become part of Munster Rugby folklore.[31][32] They again faced Leicester, this time at the Tigers' home of Welford Road, and defeated the reigning champions to progress to the semi-finals.[33] They faced Toulouse in the semi-finals and lost out on a place in the final after losing by a single point in France.[34] In this season, Munster won the Celtic League for the first time, by beating Neath-Swansea Ospreys 37–17 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.[35]\n\nIn 2003–04 it was more of the same. After an assured performance in the pool stage, Munster defeated Stade Français at Thomond Park to set up a semi-final date with English champions, London Wasps.[36] This match has gone down as one of the best Heineken Cup matches of all time. Although leading by 10 points in the second half, and having lost Ronan O'Gara to injury early on, they succumbed to two Wasps tries in injury time, resulting in a Wasps v Toulouse final.[37][38] Munster finished in a disappointing seventh position in the 2003–04 season of the Celtic League.[39]\n\nIn 2004–05, after a shaky performance in the pool stage, Munster qualified as 5th seeds and played Biarritz away. The match was played at Real Sociedad's ground, the Anoeta Stadium, in San Sebastián, Spain – the first Heineken Cup game ever played in Spain. Biarritz won 19–10 to avenge a 38–29 defeat at the same stage in 2001.[40] Munster finished second in the 2004–05 Celtic League season but won the Celtic Cup, defeating Llanelli Scarlets 27–16 in the final.[41]\n\nIn 2005–06, Munster qualified to the final of the Heineken Cup, having overcome rivals Leinster 30–6 in the semi-final at Lansdowne Road.[42] The final was held at the Millennium Stadium against Biarritz. Munster won 23–19 to become European Champions for the first time.[43] Munster finished one place lower than the previous season in the Celtic League, finishing third overall.[44]\n\nThe 2006–07 Heineken Cup was a disappointing tournament for Munster, as they lost their previously unbeaten European record at Thomond Park, losing to Leicester Tigers in the group stages in January 2007,[45] and later lost their quarter-final to Llanelli Scarlets.[46] Munster's performance in the Celtic League was equally disappointing, finishing sixth overall.[47]\n\nIn 2007, Munster signed Doug Howlett, the all-time leading try scorer for New Zealand.[48] Howlett joined the squad after the 2007 Rugby World Cup.[49] That season's Heineken Cup saw Munster finish top in their group,[50] and they went on to reach the final for the second time in three years, beating Saracens in the semi-final.[51] The final, again held at the Millennium Stadium, saw Munster defeat Toulouse 16–13 to claim their second Heineken Cup title in 3 years.[52][53] Munster finished third in the Celtic League in the 2007–08 season. In May 2008, Director of Coaching Declan Kidney left to take up the head coach job with Ireland.[54] Munster ensured continuity by promoting Australian Tony McGahan to the position from within the coaching setup.[55]\n\nIn the 2008–09 Heineken Cup, Munster once again topped their group and hammered Ospreys 43–9 to advance to a semi-final against arch-rivals Leinster.[56] Many had fancied Munster to become only the second team to win back-to-back Heineken Cups, but a dominant Leinster side gained revenge for their 2006 semi-final defeat against Munster with a 25–6 win in Croke Park, in front of a then-world record 82,208 crowd.[57][58] Munster clinched the Celtic League for the second time in their history, after their closest challengers Ospreys beat Dragons but failed to claim a bonus point. This handed the title to Munster who could not be overtaken at the top of the table.[59]\n\nThe McGahan and Penney years (2009–2014)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2009–10 season saw Munster finish top of their Heineken Cup pool once again. Victories over Northampton Saints, French Top 14 champions Perpignan and Italian side Benetton saw Munster qualify for the Heineken Cup quarter-finals for a record 12th consecutive year.[60] The match took place at Thomond Park, where Munster played Northampton Saints for the third time that season and won 33–19.[61] They lost 18–7 in the semi-finals against Biarritz at the Anoeta.[62] Munster came 4th in the Celtic League, but because this season saw the introduction of a play-off system for the top four teams, Munster met and lost 16–6 to Leinster in the play-off semi-final.[63]\n\nThe 2010–11 season saw Munster drawn in pool 3 of the Heineken Cup alongside Ospreys, London Irish and Toulon. Munster lost 23–17 away to London Irish,[64] before defeating Toulon 45–18 at Thomond Park.[65] Munster defeated Ospreys 22–16,[66] but lost the reverse fixture at Liberty Stadium 19–15.[67] In round 5 Munster went to Toulon, losing 32–16. As a result, Munster failed to qualify for the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup for the first time in 13 years.[68] Munster won their final pool game, at home to London Irish, 28–14, and qualified for the 2010–11 European Challenge Cup quarter-finals.[69] Munster defeated Leinster 24–23 on 2 April 2011 in the Celtic League, ending a run of 5 straight defeats against their provincial rivals.[70] Munster beat Brive 42–37 in their Challenge Cup quarter-final to qualify for the semi-final against Harlequins on 30 April.[71] Munster lost the semi-final in Thomond Park 20–12.[72] Munster finished first in the 2010–11 Celtic League. They beat Ospreys 18–11 in their semi-final to set up a Grand Final with Leinster,[73] which Munster won 19–9, securing a third Celtic League title.[74][75]\n\nMunster were drawn in pool one for the 2011–12 Heineken Cup, alongside Northampton Saints, Scarlets and Castres. They beat Northampton 23–21 in the first pool game at Thomond Park, after an 83rd minute drop-goal from Ronan O'Gara.[76] In their second pool game, Munster beat Castres 24–27, with O'Gara again scoring an overtime drop-goal to secure victory.[77] Munster won their third pool game, away to Scarlets, 17–14.[78] In the return fixture a week later, Munster won 19–13.[79] A 26–10 win over Castres on 14 January 2012 ensured that Munster qualified for the quarter-finals of the 2011–12 Heineken Cup.[80] Munster ended their 2011–12 Heineken Cup pool fixtures with a 51–36 victory against Northampton Saints, securing the top seed in the quarter-finals and winning 6 out of 6 pool matches for the first time.[81] Munster lost their quarter-final against Ulster 22–16, losing just their second match at home in the Heineken Cup.[82] Munster finished third in the 2011–12 Pro12, and played Ospreys away in the play-off semi-finals, losing 45–10.[83] It was announced on 22 February 2012 that McGahan would be leaving Munster at the end of the 2011–12 season,[84][85] to take up a role of coaching co-ordinator on Australia's management team. Rob Penney, coach of Canterbury and New Zealand U20, was chosen to succeed McGahan, being unveiled as the next Munster coach on 2 May 2012.[86]\n\nMunster were again drawn in pool one for the 2012–13 Heineken Cup, with Saracens, Edinburgh and Racing 92.[87] The campaign opened with a 22–17 away defeat at the hands of Racing 92.[88] Munster won their second game, at home to Edinburgh, 33–0.[89] The December back-to-back games began with a home fixture against Saracens, which Munster won 15–9.[90] In the reverse fixture, Munster lost 19–13.[91] In the fifth round of pool fixtures, Munster beat Edinburgh 26–17.[92] Munster had to win their final pool game, against Racing 92, with a try bonus-point to have a chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals. Munster won the game 29–6, scoring five tries, including a hat-trick from Simon Zebo.[93] Leicester Tigers' 9–5 victory over Toulouse ensured that Munster qualified as a second-best runner-up, and they played Harlequins in the quarter-finals.

Fitzgerald was Munster's first CEO and had been in the post since 1999, making him the longest serving provincial chief executive in Irish rugby at the time.[185] Ian Flanagan, who was born in Cork and previously worked at Leicester City F.C, was appointed to replace Fitzgerald.[1]\n\nIn a change from the previous two seasons, Munster were in conference B for the 2019–20 Pro14 season, alongside Benetton, Cardiff Blues, Connacht, Edinburgh, Scarlets and Southern Kings. This will also be the case for the 2020–21 season, and the change was made based on the points total each club achieved after the completion of the regular 2018–19 season.[186]\n\nMunster were seeded in tier 2 when the draw for the 2019–20 European Rugby Champions Cup was made in Lausanne, Switzerland on Wednesday 19 June 2019,[187] and were drawn in pool 4 alongside defending champions Saracens, Racing 92, who count former Munster players Donnacha Ryan and Simon Zebo amongst their squad, and fellow Pro14 side Ospreys.[188]\n\nMunster opened their 2019–20 Pro14 season with a 39–9 home victory against Welsh side Dragons on 28 September 2019, with the tries coming from Arno Botha, Jack O'Donoghue, Man-of-the-Match Shane Daly, Tyler Bleyendaal and academy member Diarmuid Barron, and fly-half JJ Hanrahan contributing 14 points off the kicking tee.

Academy fly-half Ben Healy made his debut for Munster during the same game, scoring 11 points in the 18–16 defeat to the Scottish side.[193]\n\nIn the Champions Cup back-to-backs against defending champions Saracens, Munster won 10–3 at home on 7 December 2019, with the English side picking up a losing bonus point.[194] In the return fixture one week later, Munster were beaten 15–6, with two tries in the final quarter securing the win for Saracens and denying Munster a losing bonus point.[195]\n\nFollowing an incident that triggered a large brawl in Munster's second fixture against Saracens in December 2019 and a complaint to the EPCR from Saracens, in which Munster team doctor Jamie Kearns was accused of verbally abusing Saracens hooker Jamie George, an independent panel upheld the complaint and found that Kearns had breached the EPCR's disciplinary rules, handing Kearns a three-week ban, suspended for 12 months, and a fine of €2,000 to be paid immediately.[196]\n\nMunster went into their round 5 Champions Cup clash away to Racing 92 on 12 January 2020 knowing that they had to win to keep alive their hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals of the tournament, but despite leading the French club with ten minutes to go, late tries from Racing secured a 39–22 win for the home side.[197] Munster needed results elsewhere to go their way if they were to stand any chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals as the final round of pool matches took place, but Glasgow Warriors 45–7 win against Sale Sharks ended those hopes before Munster's final game against Ospreys had even taken place.[198] In the event, Munster won 33–6 against Ospreys, with Craig Casey, who made his European debut for the province in the defeat to Racing, scoring his first try for Munster, and Calvin Nash, Jack O'Sullivan and Ben Healy making their European debuts for the province.[199]\n\nMunster's 68–3 win against South African side Southern Kings in round 11 of the Pro14 on 14 February 2020 was a record margin of victory for the province in the competition, and the ten tries scored also set a new record for the province. Academy member John Hodnett made his debut for Munster in the fixture, scoring a try and earning the Man-of-the-Match award.[200] The match had an added poignancy for Munster, as their long-serving former CEO, Garrett Fitzgerald, who had only retired in June 2019, passed away following a battle with illness earlier that day.[201]\n\nThe 2019–20 Pro14 was suspended indefinitely by tournament organisers on 12 March 2020 in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.[202] Munster's round 14 and 15 fixtures against Italian side Benetton had already been postponed.[203] Tyler Bleyendaal was forced to retire from playing rugby with immediate effect in May 2020 due to a persistent neck injury.[204] In the same month, prop Brian Scott was also forced to retire with immediate effect due to injury.[205] The regular season resumed on 22 August 2020, with the number of rounds reduced from 21 to 15 and any games postponed prior to the indefinite suspension of the season being deemed as 0–0 draws and both teams awarded two points. Rounds 14 and 15 took place as derbies in each territory, with the top two teams in each conference progressing to a semi-final stage.\n\nMunster resumed their season on 22 August 2020 with a fixture against Leinster in the Aviva Stadium, which Leinster won 27–25. Munster handed debuts to new signings Damian de Allende and RG Snyman, though Snyman's first appearance for the province lasted only 7 minutes after he was injured during a lineout. Andrew Conway scored tries either side of Keith Earls' try, with JJ Hanrahan kicking 10 points off the tee, and Chris Farrell won the Man-of-the-Match award.[207]\n\nMunster completed their reduced 15 round Pro14 regular season with a seven try 49–12 win against Connacht, a victory that secured a semi-final against defending champions and provincial rivals Leinster on 4 September 2020. The tries came from Chris Cloete, Jeremy Loughman, Tadhg Beirne, James Cronin, two from Andrew Conway and a penalty try, with JJ Hanrahan kicking all five of his conversions and Rory Scannell converting the final try. As well as getting on the scoresheet, Tadhg Beirne also won the Man-of-the-Match award on his first game back after fracturing an ankle against Saracens in December 2019.[208] Leinster won the semi-final 13–3, knocking Munster out at the semi-final stage of the Pro14 for the third season in a row.[209]\n\nMunster opened their 2020–21 Pro14 season with a 30–27 away win against Scarlets on 3 October 2020. Despite nine penalties from Scarlets fullback Leigh Halfpenny and a red card for captain Peter O'Mahony, tries from Jack O'Donoghue and Chris Farrell kept Munster within touching distance of the hosts, and a try from replacement hooker Kevin O'Byrne, converted by Ben Healy, levelled the score going into the final minutes of the game, before academy fly-half Healy scored a 50-metre penalty in the 81st minute to earn what had previously looked like an unlikely win for the province.[210]\n\nMunster's 2020–21 Champions Cup campaign commenced with a 21–7 home win against Harlequins on 13 December 2020, in which Gavin Coombes, Damian de Allende and Josh Wycherley made their tournament debuts. Coombes scored one try, with the other being a penalty try, with JJ Hanrahan and Ben Healy adding nine points of the kicking tee between them.[211] Munster travelled away to Clermont for round two on 19 December 2020 and, despite trailing 28–9 to the home side at one point, fought back to earn a stunning 39–31 win at the Stade Marcel-Michelin. The tries for Munster came from Mike Haley, star-of-the-match CJ Stander and Kevin O'Byrne, with JJ Hanrahan scoring a perfect nine from nine off the kicking tee for the other 24 points.[212]\n\nIn early January 2021, the EPCR took the decision to temporarily suspend rounds 3 and 4 of the 2020–21 Champions Cup, following a directive from authorities in France that French clubs should not participate in the scheduled matches in response to health risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.[213]\n\nMunster's 20–17 win against Connacht in round 14 of the 2020–21 Pro14 on 5 March 2021 saw them become the first team to qualify for 2021 Pro14 Grand Final, as the victory gave them an unassailable 12 point lead at the top of conference B with two rounds remaining.[214] Munster were beaten 16–6 by arch-rivals Leinster in the 2021 Pro14 Grand Final on 27 March 2021.[215]\n\nThe Champions Cup resumed on the weekend of 2/3/4 April 2021 with the top eight teams from each pool at the time of suspension progressing to the round of 16, where Munster had home advantage thanks to their wins in the opening games against Harlequins and Clermont.[216] Munster were drawn against Toulouse.[217]\n\nIn an enthralling encounter at Thomond Park, Munster led 16–9 at half-time thanks to two tries from Keith Earls and two penalties from Joey Carbery, but Toulouse pulled level thanks to a converted try from Matthis Lebel. Gavin Coombes scored from close-range to give Munster the lead again, before Toulouse captain Julien Marchand responded with a try to level the scores again at 23–23. Substitute fly-half JJ Hanrahan scored a penalty to give Munster a 26–23 lead heading into the final 15 minutes of the match, but Toulouse's talismanic scrum-half Antoine Dupont scored two tries in 9 minutes to help the French club pull away on the scoreboard. A late consolation try from Gavin Coombes, his second of the match, in overtime meant the final score was 40–33 to Toulouse, who became just the second French club to win a European match at Thomond Park and advanced to an away quarter-final against Munster's pool opponents Clermont.[218]\n\nMunster opened their 2021–22 United Rugby Championship campaign with a bonus-point 42–17 win against the Sharks, one of the four new South African teams, on 25 September 2021. Simon Zebo, making his return for the province, scored two tries, extending his club record to 62, with Gavin Coombes continuing his try-scoring exploits from the previous season with two tries of his own. Chris Cloete and player of the match Craig Casey also crossed the try line. Fly-half Joey Carbery scored seven points off the kicking tee, with his replacement Ben Healy contributing five points off the tee in the second-half. RG Snyman made his eagerly-awaited return from long-term injury as a second-half replacement, and scrum-half Rowan Osborne made his competitive debut for the province, in a match that saw fans return to Thomond Park for the first time since February 2020.[219]\n\nMunster were in South Africa for rounds 6 and 7 of the United Rugby Championship, in which they were due to play the Bulls and the Lions, however, the emergence of the omicron variant of COVID-19 led to travel restrictions being implemented by UK and EU authorities, meaning the fixtures had to be postponed.[220] 34 players and staff arrived back in Ireland on 1 December 2021 and immediately entered 10 days of mandatory self-isolation. 14 players and staff who had tested positive for COVID-19 had to remain in South Africa.[221]\n\nIn the wake of this disruption for Munster and other clubs, and with Munster's opening Champions Cup fixture away to Wasps falling on 12 December, the EPCR extended the deadline for registering players for the tournament to 8 December, meaning Munster could look to supplement their squad with short-term signings,[222][223] and 22 players were subsequently registered with the province's Champions Cup squad.[224]\n\nA depleted Munster squad made up of internationals who'd been away with Ireland during the Autumn tests, academy players and members of the national and provincial talent squads travelled over to England to face Wasps on their opening Champions Cup fixture on 12 December 2021. The team, which featured 12 debutantes, pulled off one of the great Munster away victories, defeating their opponents 35–14 in a thrilling contest in front of a large contingent of Munster fans who had made the journey to Coventry.[225]\n\nMunster made it back-to-back wins in the Champions Cup with a gritty 19–13 win at home against French club Castres on 18 December 2021, with a 58th minute try from number 8 Jack O'Donoghue and 14 points off the tee from fly-half Ben Healy being enough for the province to see off their opposition.[226]\n\nIn the reverse fixture against Castres in round 3 of the Champions Cup on 14 January 2022, Munster earned a 16–13 away win thanks to a 77th minute try from Gavin Coombes, converted by rookie fly-half Jack Crowley, who was faultless off the kicking tee in his first European start for the province. The win secured a place in the knockout stage of the tournament for Munster.[227] Nine days later, Munster followed up their away win against Castres with a 45–7 home win against Wasps, with the tries coming from Jeremy Loughman, Conor Murray, Jack O'Donoghue, who was player of the match on the occasion of his 150th cap for Munster, Rory Scannell and Simon Zebo, who scored a brace to become Munster's all-time leading try-scorer in the Champions Cup and the leading Irish try-scorer in the competition overall. Fly-half Ben Healy and his replacement on the day, Jack Crowley, were both 100% from the kicking tee, with Healy scoring four conversions and a penalty, and Crowley adding two late conversions. The win secured home advantage for Munster in the second leg of the round of 16.[228]\n\nMunster faced English club Exeter Chiefs in the round of 16,[229] and lost the first leg of the tie 13–8 away to the Premiership club on 9 April 2022. Exeter took a 10–0 lead in to half-time after tries from Stuart Hogg and Jacques Vermeulen, before Munster fly-half Ben Healy hit back with a penalty to reduce the home sides lead. Hogg responded for Exeter with a drop-goal, but a 66th minute try from Shane Daly brought Munster back within touching distance on the scoreboard, and Exeter had to withstand some intense offensive play from Munster going into the final ten minutes, with replacement scrum-half Craig Casey almost drawing the scores level, before the hosts themselves assaulted the Munster try-line in the last minutes of the match in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to extend their lead.[230]\n\nNeeding to overturn a five-point deficit to advance in the competition, Munster welcomed Exeter to Thomond Park for the second leg of their last 16 tie one week later. Fly-half Joey Carbery, returning from injury, opened the scoring for the hosts with a penalty, but the visitors responded with their first try of the game to take an early 5–3 lead, before Carbery struck back for Munster with a try of his own, to which he added a second penalty to give Munster a 13–5 half-time lead. Exeter struck first in the second-half with a try in the 47th minute, but Carbery kept Munster in front with two further penalties, before centre Damian de Allende scored a 74th minute try to secure a 26–10 home win for Munster and a 34–23 victory on aggregate, ensuring Munster progressed to a record 19th Champions Cup quarter-final.[231]\n\nFacing defending champions Toulouse, who knocked the province out of the previous season's tournament, in the quarter-final,[232] Munster began strongly with an 11th minute Alex Kendellen try, converted by Joey Carbery to lead 7–0, but Romain Ntamack hit back for Toulouse two minutes later with a try of his own, converted by Thomas Ramos, to level the scores. The visitors were dominating the scrum and scored their second try in the 25th minute when Matthis Lebel touched down, with Ramos again converting to give Toulouse a 14–7 lead. However, Munster struck back with a Keith Earls try just before half-time which Carbery converted to leave the scores level heading into the break. The home side came out firing in the second-half, with Mike Haley scoring a 43rd minute try, again converted by Carbery, to give Munster a 21–14 lead, which Carbery extended with a penalty in the 56th minute, but Toulouse responded with Lebel's second try in the 66th minute which, when converted by Ramos, reduced the margin to just three points heading into the final ten minutes. A 75th-minute penalty from Ramos levelled the scores at 24–24, and that remained the score at full-time after Ben Healy missed with a 56-metre penalty attempt in the final minute of normal time.[233]\n\nWith the scores level at full-time and as both teams scored three tries, extra time ensued, played over two ten-minute halves, but even after that the two teams could not be separated after three missed drop goals between the two, and the game went to a penalty shootout. Munster went first and Conor Murray scored his penalty. Antoine Dupont responded successfully for Toulouse, but Ben Healy missed his first attempt, and when Thomas Ramos scored his penalty, it was advantage Toulouse. Carbery scored his penalty, but Romain Ntamack scored his own to restore Toulouse's lead. Murray missed with his second attempt, whilst Dupont was successful with his own to give Toulouse a 4–2 lead, meaning Healy had to score with his second attempt to give Munster any hope, but he was unable to do so, and Toulouse advanced to the semi-finals, knocking Munster out of the competition for the second season in a row.[233]\n\nA 35–25 defeat away to Leinster in round 18 of the 2021–22 United Rugby Championship meant that Munster finished sixth in the league overall, and third in the Irish Shield,[234] and the province headed north to face Ulster in the quarter-finals on 3 June 2022, but Munster lost 36–17 to bring the curtain down on their 2021–22 season, as well as Johann van Graan's tenure as head coach.[235]\n\nGraham Rowntree becomes head coach\n\n[edit]\n\nHead coach Johann van Graan, who joined Munster in November 2017, confirmed in December 2021 that he would be leaving the province at the end of the 2021–22 season to join English club Bath. In addition to this, senior coach Stephen Larkham also left the province to return home to Australia to become head coach of the Brumbies, and defence coach JP Ferreira followed van Graan to join Bath. However, forwards coach Graham Rowntree extended his stay with the province by a further two years,[236] and the province confirmed in April 2022 that Rowntree would be promoted to head coach from the 2022–23 season.[237] Mike Prendergast, a former scrum-half for the province, joined Rowntree's coaching setup as the attack coach on a three-year contract, having most recently fulfilled a similar role for French club Racing 92.[238] Andi Kyriacou, who had joined the province in April 2021 as an elite player development officer with the academy, was promoted to forwards coach with the senior squad on a two-year contract,[239] and former Munster player Denis Leamy returned to the province as defence coach on a three-year contract.[240]\n\nAfter a poor start to the season, Munster won the 2022–23 United Rugby Championship after beating defending champions the Stormers 19–14 away from home in the final on 27 May 2023. In doing so, Munster ended a trophy drought that had lasted since their previous league title during the 2010–11 season, and secured the first silverware of Graham Rowntree's reign as head coach.[241]\n\nPrevious season summaries\n\n[edit]\n\nDomestic League European Cup Domestic / 'A' Cup Season Competition Final Position (Pool) Points Play-offs Competition Performance Competition Performance 1995–96 No competition Heineken Cup 2nd in pool Interprovincial Championship 3rd 1996–97 No competition Heineken Cup 4th in pool Interprovincial Championship Champions 1997–98 No competition Heineken Cup 4th in pool Interprovincial Championship 2nd 1998–99 No competition Heineken Cup Quarter-final Interprovincial Championship Champions 1999–2000 No competition Heineken Cup Runner-up Interprovincial Championship Champions 2000–01 No competition Heineken Cup Semi-final Interprovincial Championship Champions 2001–02 Celtic League 1st (B) 15 Runner-up Heineken Cup Runner-up Interprovincial Championship 3rd 2002–03 Celtic League 1st (A) 28 Champions Heineken Cup Semi-final No competition 2003–04 Celtic League 7th 51 N/A Heineken Cup Semi-final Celtic Cup Quarter-final 2004–05 Celtic League 2nd 69 N/A Heineken Cup Quarter-final Celtic Cup Champions 2005–06 Celtic League 3rd 66 N/A Heineken Cup Champions No competition 2006–07 Magners League 6th 54 N/A Heineken Cup Quarter-final No competition 2007–08 Magners League 3rd 48 N/A Heineken Cup Champions No competition 2008–09 Magners League 1st 63 N/A Heineken Cup Semi-final No competition 2009–10 Magners League 4th 45 Semi-final Heineken Cup Semi-final British and Irish Cup Runner-up 2010–11 Magners League 1st 83 Champions Challenge Cup* Semi-final British and Irish Cup 3rd in pool 2011–12 RaboDirect PRO12 3rd 67 Semi-final Heineken Cup Quarter-final British and Irish Cup Champions 2012–13 RaboDirect PRO12 6th 54 Did not qualify Heineken Cup Semi-final British and Irish Cup Semi-final 2013–14 RaboDirect PRO12 3rd 74 Semi-final Heineken Cup Semi-final British and Irish Cup Quarter-final 2014–15 Guinness PRO12 2nd 75 Runner-up Champions Cup 3rd in pool British and Irish Cup Quarter-final 2015–16 Guinness PRO12 6th 63 Did not qualify Champions Cup 3rd in pool British and Irish Cup 3rd in pool 2016–17 Guinness PRO12 1st 86 Runner-up Champions Cup Semi-final British and Irish Cup Champions 2017–18 Guinness PRO14 2nd (A) 69 Semi-final Champions Cup Semi-final British and Irish Cup Quarter-final 2018–19 Guinness PRO14 2nd (A) 77 Semi-final Champions Cup Semi-final Celtic Cup 2nd in pool 2019–20 Guinness PRO14 2nd (B) 51 Semi-final Champions Cup 3rd in pool Celtic Cup 6th in pool 2020–21 Guinness PRO14 1st (B) 64 Runner-up Champions Cup Last 16 Rainbow Cup 2nd in pool 2021–22 URC 6th 56 Quarter-final Champions Cup Quarter-final URC Irish Shield 3rd 2022–23 URC 5th 55 Champions Champions Cup Last 16 URC Irish Shield 3rd\n\nGold background denotes champions\n\nSilver background denotes runner-up\n\n* After dropping into the competition from the Heineken Cup\n\nSeason records\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited Rugby Championship\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason Pos Played Won Drawn Lost Bonus Points 2001–02 1st (Pool B) 6 5 0 1 0 15 Quarter-final Munster 13 – 6 Llanelli Semi-final Munster 15 – 9 Ulster Final Leinster 24 – 20 Munster 2002–03 1st (Pool A) 7 6 0 1 4 28 Quarter-final Munster 33 – 3 Connacht Semi-final Munster 42 – 10 Ulster Final Neath 17 – 37 Munster 2003–04 7th 22 10 0 12 11 51 2004–05 2nd 20 15 1 4 7 69 2005–06 3rd 20 12 0 8 10 66[n 1] 2006–07 6th 20 12 0 8 6 54 2007–08 3rd 18 10 1 7 6 48 2008–09 1st 18 14 0 4 8 63 2009–10 4th 18 9 0 9 9 45 Semi-final Leinster 16 – 6 Munster 2010–11 1st 22 19 0 3 7 83 Semi-final Munster 18 – 11 Ospreys Final Munster 19 – 9 Leinster 2011–12 3rd 22 14 1 7 9 67 Semi-final Ospreys 45 – 10 Munster 2012–13 6th 22 11 1 10 8 54 2013–14 3rd 22 16 0 6 10 74 Semi-final Glasgow 16 – 15 Munster 2014–15 2nd 22 15 2 5 11 75 Semi-final Munster 21 – 18 Ospreys Final Munster 13 – 31 Glasgow 2015–16 6th 22 13 0 9 11 63 2016–17 1st 22 19 0 3 10 86 Semi-final Munster 23 – 3 Ospreys Final Munster 22 – 46 Scarlets 2017–18 2nd (Conf.

Between 2004 and 2013, Toyota was Munster's primary sponsor, appearing on the front of their jersey. On 23 May 2013, it was announced on that Bank of Ireland would be replacing Toyota as Munster's sponsor.[249] In April 2017, the deal with Bank of Ireland was extended until the end of the 2022–23 season.[250] In August 2017, Munster announced that Shannon Airport had become its 'official airport partner' in a three-year deal, which would see the Shannon Airport logo appear on the players' shorts from the 2017–18 season onwards.[251] The deals with kit manufacturer Adidas and retail partner LifeStyle Sports were extended in July 2019 until the end of the 2025–26 season.[252]\n\nHome grounds\n\n[edit]\n\nMunster have two main stadia where they play their home matches – Thomond Park in Limerick and Musgrave Park in Cork. Thomond Park is the bigger of the two, with a capacity of 25,600, which can be expanded up to 26,267 with temporary seating, while Musgrave Park holds 8,800.[253] As well as Munster, Shannon and UL Bohemians play at the grounds of Thomond Park. Thomond Park is famous for its atmosphere and unique history[254] – its noise during play and complete silence when a player (home or away) is kicking at goal. It was also famous for Munster's intimidating record that it held for over a decade – having never been beaten at home during the Heineken Cup. However, the record was broken during the 2006–07 season when they were defeated by Leicester Tigers.[255] Munster train in the University of Limerick.\n\nThomond Park went through a major renovation in 1999 and in 2006, Munster announced plans to upgrade it. In autumn 2008, the new 25,600 capacity stadium was opened. Two sweeping arches are one of the defining features of the stadium, as well as the concourse outside of the new East Stand. The new stadium design was well received and won the Public Choice Award for 2009 from the Irish Architecture Foundation. A long discussion and consultation on the new name concluded with the decision that the name would remain Thomond Park.[256]\n\nSupporters\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Munster Rugby Supporters Club was founded in 1999 and has branches in Brussels, Dublin, London and the United States.[257] The strength of Munster's support was demonstrated during Munster's 2006 and 2008 Heineken Cup final wins. News reports detailed the lengths that fans were willing to go to secure tickets to the game, with some Munster fans travelling to Biarritz to buy up the French allocation of tickets. On the day of the game the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was filled with a capacity crowd of 74,500. Of those numbers it is estimated that somewhere between 55,000 and 65,000 were Munster fans with the remainder being neutrals and Biarritz supporters. The Millennium Stadium was intended to be a neutral venue but commentators on the day remarked that it could hardly be counted as such.\n\nMunster played in the most attended semi-final match of the Heineken Cup. 82,208 spectators attended their 2008–09 Heineken Cup semi-final against Irish rivals Leinster, which was played in Croke Park, Dublin. This was also, at the time, the largest crowd ever at a club rugby union match. The record was broken in a league game between English sides Saracens and Harlequins in 2012.\n\nMunster's appearance in the 2002 final of the Heineken Cup against Leicester Tigers at the Millennium Stadium, which drew 74,600, was the record attendance for a final in the competition[258] until the 2007 Heineken Cup final between Leicester and London Wasps at the newly expanded Twickenham. Munster's 2005 quarter-final against Biarritz Olympique in Estadio Anoeta, played across the border in Spain in San Sebastián set the record for the biggest rugby match ever played in Spain with an attendance of 32,000.[259] Their October 2006 Celtic League game against Leinster at Lansdowne Road beat the record for that competition with an attendance of 27,252.[260] This record lasted just two months however, with the Leinster and Ulster match on 31 December 2006 filling Lansdowne Road (over 48,000 in attendance) for the last match at the stadium before redevelopment.[261]\n\nOn 2 October 2010, Munster played Leinster in the round 5 of the Celtic League at the Aviva Stadium, this set a new crowd attendance record for a Celtic League game at 50,645.[262] On 26 December 2017, a new attendance record for Thomond Park in the Pro14 was set when 26,267 were at the Munster v Leinster fixture.[156]\n\nMunster fans are known for their silence when a kick is being taken, but also for their noise. Fans repeatedly chant \"MUNSTER\" or sing \"The Fields of Athenry\" (an Irish famine song from Galway, Connacht) and \"Stand Up and Fight\" (from the Broadway musical Carmen Jones).[263] They sang The Black Velvet Band to the Ospreys' Irish winger Tommy Bowe during their 2009 Heineken Cup quarter-final encounter. Tommy Bowe sang this song at the official reception for the 2009 Grand Slam winning Ireland rugby team. Munster Rugby has given the word \"Garryowen\" to the rugby lexicon. The Limerick club of Garryowen introduced the \"Garryowen kick\", a high up-and-under which puts defending players under pressure. Shortly after the 2018 death of Dolores O'Riordan, lead singer of The Cranberries (a band formed in Limerick), Munster fans adopted the band's song \"Zombie\" as an unofficial anthem.[264] The song's status was further cemented during the 2021–22 season, with the hit single featuring prominently in Munster's defeat against Toulouse in May 2022 and in their win against a South Africa XV in Páirc Uí Chaoimh in November 2022.[265][266][267]\n\nMunster A\n\n[edit]\n\nMunster A is the team that represents Munster in the Celtic Cup and in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship. Pre-professionalism and a formal league structure, the main Munster team competed in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship. Since the advent of professionalism, the provinces have fielded lesser teams in order to concentrate on the league. The team is composed of senior Munster squad players requiring gametime, academy players and All-Ireland League players called up from their club.[268]\n\nHaving been beaten finalists in the 2009–10 British and Irish Cup, losing 23–14 to Cornish Pirates,[269] Munster A secured success in the British and Irish Cup on 27 April 2012, beating Cross Keys 31–12 in the final of the 2011–12 tournament at Musgrave Park.[270] On 21 April 2017, Munster A won their second British and Irish Cup, beating English RFU Championship side Jersey Reds 29–28 in the 2016–17 final, which was held in Musgrave Park. At one point during the first half, Munster A had been losing 18–0, but fought back to secure victory.[271]\n\nWith 2017–18 being the last season in which the British and Irish Cup was held, the Welsh Rugby Union and Irish Rugby Football Union formed a new tournament, the Celtic Cup, which features development squads from the four Irish provinces and four Welsh regions, split into two pools of four. The first tournament ran over seven consecutive weeks between 7 September 2018 and 21 October 2018.[272]\n\nSenior squad\n\n[edit]\n\nCoaching and management staff\n\n[edit]\n\nPosition Name
