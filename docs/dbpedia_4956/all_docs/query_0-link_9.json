        "text": "üèÜ üêç üèâ Our annual awards night takes place on Friday 17th May in Naas Racecourse. This promises to be a great night celebrating the successes of the season! Tickets can be purchased via the below link: https://lnkd.in/eEdUymEv\n\nAnother season finished on the weekend. Our U7s at Naas RFC started the season with 18 kids and finished with 36 kids at the end. The growth in numbers was testament to a strong coaching group, supportive parents and a super bunch of young Cobras. I'm looking forward to next year with this group and taking on the role of Minis Rugby Coordinator where I aim to continue the great work done on growing Naas RFC from U6 to U12s. For anyone considering getting their son or daughter into rugby next season then drop me a message. You will be welcomed to the club as I was with my family.\n\nOver 1,600 players, comprising 82 teams, attended our Annual Good Friday Festival with Girls U10 and 12, Boys U10, 11, 12, 13s. Thanks to all who attended from all over the country. A big thanks to our volunteers who helped make this a memorable day with morning and afternoon sessions. #rugby #festival #community #future UL Bohemian RFC Naas RFC Garryowen Football Club Blackrock College RFC Munster Rugby Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) Leinster Rugby Munster Referee Connacht Rugby"
