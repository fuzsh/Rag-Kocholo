        "text": "Michael Gallagher9 Jun 2022 - 08:01\n\nShare via\n\nhttps://www.ballinarfc.com/new\n\nMichael to become President of Shannon\n\nAll at Ballina RFC send heartiest congratulations to our own Michael Moylett who will become President of Shannon Rugby Club tonight.\n\nMichael is highly deserving of the honour and we're all very proud of him. The big second row played a pivotal role with Shannon during the 1980s alongside the likes of Niall O'Donovan, Noel Glynn and Ginger McLoughlin. They dominated Munster rugby during that period and Michael has numerous medals to show for his efforts.\n\nMichael was the first Ballina man to play senior rugby for Ireland and he's pictured here alongside another of our internationals, Dave Heffernan.\n\nOver the years, not only has Michael been a superb player, he has also worked tirelessly behind the scenes as a volunteer - always willing to give his time generously for the good of others.\n\nMichael Moylett is a very special man to all of us in Ballina RFC and we wish him every success in his role as President of Shannon RFC, a club we all have a great affinity with.\n\nFurther reading"
