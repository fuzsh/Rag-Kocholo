        "text": "This week’s club notes come from Old Cresent RFC, Shannon RFC and Young Munster RFC.\n\nOld Crescent RFC – Courtesy of Frank Larkin\n\nOld Crescent came out on top against Highfield by 11 points to 8 in an entertaining Munster Senior Cup game played in bright breezy conditions in Cork last Saturday, 15 September 2012. With both teams showing early season nerves, Old Crescent were first to settle and opened the scoring after six minutes with a penalty converted by Shane Mullally. Midway through the first half, Shane Mullally successfully converted a difficult long range penalty in the breezy conditions to put Crescent six points clear.\n\nA few minutes later, after a Highfield turnover in mid field and a swift passage of attacking broken play by Crescent, Will Hanly finished the attack by crossing the Highfield line to score a try out wide. The convert was missed to leave Old Crescent ahead at half time by 11 points to nil.\n\nHighfield came out fighting in the second half and put Crescent under severe pressure, which together with some loose Crescent tackling, led to a Highfield try in the corner after just two minutes play in the second half. The convert was missed. Crescent rallied after this lapse in concentration and stoutly defended their line against Highfield attacks for the remainder of the second half. A converted penalty by Highfield midway through the second half was the only other score of the half, and Crescent finished worthy winners by 11 points to 8.\n\nOld Crescent teamsheet for game against Highfield, 15 Sept 2012\n\n1.

Sean Cunningham\n\nShannon RFC – Courtesy of Andrew McNamara\n\nFirstly I would like to start these notes with a special mention of Dr Darragh Little who sadly passed away last Friday evening. He was a true gentleman and will be sadly missed by all at Shannon RFC. It was a fitting tribute to see the sheer amount of people who came to pay their respects at Thompson's funeral home on Sunday evening,all those who came to the clubhouse afterward and all who have sent messages via email, twitter and Facebook. I know from speaking with the family briefly it was much appreciated.\n\nAs a mark of respect all senior club matches were cancelled and so no match reports for this week\n\nDr. Darragh Little, RIP\n\nEvents and News\n\nOur Club BBQ took place last Friday evening.It was a great success and a brilliant time was had by all. The sunny evening made a perfect setting to the event. Many thanks and recognition goes to all the people who made the event possible.All the committee members and ticket sellers,to Maire and the bar staff for cooking the bbq and handing out the HB Ice-cream treats to the kids. Thanks also to Dermot Long Snr. & Jr, Julie and Carl, who took photos on the evening and printed posters for the event, from GBM Limerick.

The visitors opened the scoring with an early penalty by Sean Og Murphy but a drop goal shortly after by player/coach and the club’s Director of Rugby, Mike Prendergast, brought the scores level. Winger Derry O’Connor was first to cross the try line in the afternoon with a fine score before the break down the left wing. The conversion went wide leaving the half-time score at 8-3 to the home side.\n\nJust after the restart, Craig O’Hanlon got in for a try in front of the clubhouse, and it wasn’t long before O’Hanlon touched down a second time with a great little chip that bounced just right for him to get to it over the line.\n\nWith outhalf Willie Staunton now gone (he has moved to Dublin for work), and new signing Gareth Quinn McDonagh still recovering from injury, first Declan Bannon and then Derry O’Connor took on the kicking duties for the afternoon. O’Connor landed O’Hanlon’s second conversion taking the score to 20-3 for Young Munster.\n\nNeville Melbourne added to the try count for the black and amber which O’Connor converted, as did Mark Doyle, and, in the last play of the game, a scrum on the 5m line resulted in a pushover try for the pack which was awarded to Ger Slattery.\n\nThe game finished with a 37-3 scoreline and a satisfying result for Mike Prendergast after the previous week’s Charity Cup Final defeat:\n\n“We have so many new players this season, but I feel they are really starting to buy into it now. Guys are definitely putting their hands up for positions. We had a slow first half but I felt we were clinical in the second half and finished the game out well.”\n\nTeam: D Bannon, C O'Hanlon, M Doyle, L Kunz, D O'Connor, M Prendergast, E Mulcahy; D Cantillon, G Slattery (c), A Cotter, S Duggan, D Gallagher, N Melbourne, L Russell, G Burke. Replacements: M Rowley, D Murphy, M Madden, C Liston, E Carr, S Upton, D Browne.\n\n[*Our Quarter Final fixture in the Munster Senior Cup will be confirmed following the outcome of the Midleton v Shannon game which was postponed last weekend.]\n\n———————–\n\nSeconds league victory over Garryowen\n\nThe Young Munster Second XV recoreded a 17-15 victory away to Garryowen in the league on Monday evening last with tries for Darren Shannon, Declan Browne, and Ger Ryan, and a conversion for Cormac Murphy.\n\n———————–\n\nFundraising SCRAP SATURDAY September 29th\n\nSaturday 29th. September is Scrap Saturday at Tom Clifford Park as Young Munster fundraising scrap metal collection day takes place.\n\nFrom 9am to 6pm you have the opportunity to have your \"Autumn Clean Out\" and, at the same time, support your community based sports club.\n\nAll items of scrap, including the kitchen sink, will be appreciated with the exception of: Gas Bottles, Televisions, Fridges and Tyres.\n\nPlease contact your family, friends, neighbours or anybody who might be in a position to contribute metal scrap in support of this venture.\n\nIf you have any special requirements, contact Frank at 087-2901015.\n\n———————–\n\nYoung Munster RFC would like to offer its deepest condolences to the O'Connor family on the death of Alphonsus ('Alger') who died recently. For many years he wore the black and amber with great pride. He played most of his rugby in the front or second row. In his playing days he had the honour of winning four Transfield Cups, one Charity Cup and also played on two beaten Junior Cup final teams.\n\nWhen he retired from rugby he still maintained his commitment with the club by attending most games home or away. For almost sixty years he would meet old friends Justin Ryan, Tommy Darcy, Ray Mulcahy and Jimmy Clarke, to name but a few better known as Sons of Sarsfield and head to a local hostelery for a few drinks and inevitable discussion on the current fortunes of Young Munster.\n\nHe will be sadly missed at Tom Clifford Park and sympathy is offered to his family on their bereavement. May he rest in peace.\n\n– Johnny Brennan\n\n———————–\n\nSenior Fixtures:\n\nSaturday 22nd September\n\nYoung Munster v Richmond\n\nMcInerny Cup, Tom Clifford Park 2.30pm\n\nSunday 23rd September\n\nYoung Munster v Nenagh\n\nMunster Seconds League, Tom Clifford Park 2.30pm\n\n———————–\n\nUnderage Fixtures:\n\nSunday 23rd September\n\nU13 League Young Munster V Ennis Derryknockane 11am\n\nU15 League Young Munster V Old Cresent Derryknockane 12am\n\nDon’t forget…\n\nClub Underage Open Day: BBQ, Fun & Games this Sunday 23rd starting at 10am.
