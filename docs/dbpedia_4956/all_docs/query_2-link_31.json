        "text": "“It’s unreal. He was a great guy; his family means everything to this club and he meant everything to this club. Things will never be the same again.”\n\nKiely was one of the key figures as a player alongside current Munster team manager Niall O’Donovan in the great days of Shannon rugby, Kiely as nine and O’Donovan at the back-row helm.\n\nBetween them, they once set a try- scoring club record that has not been surpassed.\n\n“I’m sure Niall is in bits this weekend because of the bad news but it is nothing compared to what the family must be feeling now,” said Kiely.\n\n“Look, Anthony was just a youngster when I was around but I played in the same team as his dad and in the same teams as many others in a fantastic era for Shannon.\n\n“Anthony was always around the dressing room at that time. I suppose I got to play with him in the same Shannon team a couple of times and I knew that he was a class act from the very start. You always know when a guy has something, and he certainly had that.\n\n“It was always a source of pride for everyone in Shannon to see him move up the grades and then go on to play so often for Munster and Ireland. In my time, there wasn’t a tremendous amount of opportunity but as time moved on it was clear that Anthony had something special and he proved himself a class act at every level.\n\n“His father Brendan was in a different era but was also a great player and Anthony took it on from there. To achieve what he did achieve was remarkable. He had a great international career but I always felt his heart was in Munster and to battle through difficult times and lead them to a Heineken Cup victory was something we will never forget. Certainly, we in Shannon will never forget.”\n\nFoley was a hero for Shannon, for whom he played all 48 matches in the club’s historic four-in-a-row All-Ireland Club Championship victories between 1994 and 1998.\n\nDevastated club president Noel Healy said: “I lost one of my dearest friends today, at 42 years of age. I’m still trying to come to terms with it.\n\n“My deepest sympathies go to his wife Olive and his family and his friends.”\n\nAndrew McNamara, a former team mate, said: “Like everybody else throughout the rugby world, we are absolutely shocked and devastated. As a player, Anthony was unsurpassed in the Number 8 position for many years. During the glory years he was the leader of the Shannon pack. Incredibly, he won five All-Ireland league titles.”\n\nMike Fleming recalled that, as an official with Shannon RFC, he was Anthony Foley’s designated driver when the player made it onto club’s first team at the age of 19.\n\n“ He was always a very happy young lad and very pleasant. He loved his rugby and I used to love going out to pick him up to drive him to training.”\n\nShannon today opens a book of condolence in memory of Anthony Foley at the club at 11am.\n\nREAD MORE: Shock and disbelief as rugby world mourns passing of legend Anthony Foley\n\nREAD MORE: Axel leaves an inspiring legacy of optimism, courage, and hard graft\n\nREAD MORE: Anthony Foley ‘a gentleman and one of the greats’\n\nREAD MORE: DONAL LENIHAN: Anthony Foley, a leader by actions rather than words\n\nREAD MORE: Mick Galwey: ‘Anthony Foley was a great friend, a great man and a great family man’\n\nREAD MORE: The making of a Munster and Ireland legend"
