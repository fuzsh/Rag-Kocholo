        "meta_description": "In October 1959,a group of rugby enthusiasts which consisted of Michael O’Mahony, Mattie Tobin, Maurice McElligott and J.J Donovan had an idea to start a rugby club in the town of Abbeyfeale. It was felt that boys’ who were learning to play the game at school and at College needed the opportunity to practice their beloved sport at home. The first Committee included: Captain: Con McMahon President: Dr. George O’Mahony Secretary: Matt Tobin Treasurer: Michael Moloney The Club’s first match was a friendly against neighbours Tralee on the 10th of April 1960. It was a game which resulted in a victory for the fledgling club who used a set of borrowed jerseys from another one of our neighbours Castleisland and also played with a ball that the Tralee team supplied. In the clubs first full season, Con McMahon and his trusted able men began their quest for success when they overcame several Kerry teams to progress to the semi final of the Munster Junior Cup, where they lost to the eventual winners Shannon, on a score line of 3-0. Two years later they again qualified for the semi final but yet again were defeated by a powerful Young Munster team after a second replay. Valuable experience was gained and the lessons learned were digested during those early years. The big break-through came in 1964, four years after the club had been founded when Bernard Broderick and his group of warriors led the club to victories over Castleisland and Killarney and proved too strong for Shannon in the semi final replay. In the final against Nenagh Ormond, it was a try by Jim Moynihan in the second half that gave Abbeyfeale their first Munster Junior Cup win after an emphatic encounter in Thomond Park. A week later after that monumental success, Abbeyfeale R.F.C captured its second trophy by defeating Bandon, 3-0,in the Cork County Cup final. A year later, the club were again in the final of the Munster Junior Cup but were defeated 6-3 by Old Christians. However, the Cork County Cup was retained. Joyful scenes were witnessed again in 1966,when a Cyril McMahon led team captured their second Munster Junior Cup in three years by again defeating Nenagh Ormond in the final in Thomond Park. Mrs. Betty O’Mahony RIP was President of the club from 1972 (after Dr. George’s death RIP),until 1993.She was the first lady to become President of a rugby club in Ireland, an honour she duly accepted and a role where she brought great energy, dynamism and charisma. Dr. George O’Mahony and his wife Betty’s house on the Killarney Road was headquarters for the team and the principal centre of operations. Quirkes Pub (The Winners Circle) was used as a dressing room and the teams also dined there. The Club played in Tobin’s and O’Connor’s fields in Mountmahon, Daltons Field in the Killarney Road and “The Mountain” in Knockbrack. The club purchased land 100 yards from the town centre and in October 1966,the new grounds, dressing rooms and the clubhouse were opened. In 1984 a further extension was added and in 1991 another extension was opened which was marked by a match against a Garryowen XV Abbeyfeale Rugby Male and female Teams from all ages have continued to grow and excel in the game and are now proud winners of numerous competitions since those early days.
