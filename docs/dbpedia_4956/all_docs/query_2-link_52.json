        "text": "Carrick-on-Shannon Rugby Club officially launch their new club crest by Leitrim native and Connacht RFU President Adrian Leddy and launch a fundraising quiz this Friday night, January 16, in The Bush Hotel at 8 pm.\n\nCarrick-on-Shannon Rugby Club draws players from all over Leitrim and north Roscommon as well as Longford and Cavan and the launch of the new club crest highlights the continuing growth of the club.\n\nClub Chairman Sean McKeon said “Our new crest is a true symbol of where we are going as a club. We are building a new tomorrow in a time when finance and population are scarce, yet we have dedicated volunteers whose only ask is to see their club succeed.”\n\nThe night will also see Carrick RFC launch their on-line Sports Prediction Quiz, which is made up of 26 questions, where the entrant has to predict the future winners for various sporting events over the next 10 months, the profit going to support the developments of the club’s new grounds and facilities."
