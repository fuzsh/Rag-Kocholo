        "text": "Located in the shadows of Thomond Park, Shannon R.F.C. is well known and respected in rugby circles worldwide. Shannon was established in 1884, in the historic heart of the city. It boasts of a rich tradition in Limerick, and through the success on the field, the club has contributed in a major way to enriching community life and adding to the sporting and cultural heritage of the city.\n\nWith a record nine All Ireland Titles, Shannon is Irelandâ€™s most successful club. Over 20 players from the club have represented Ireland at senior International level with three being selected for the Lions (Colm Tucker: 1980, Gerry McLoughlin: 1983, Mick Galwey: 1993). In more recent times the club has provided many Munster players. We have also had ten senior ladies internationals."
