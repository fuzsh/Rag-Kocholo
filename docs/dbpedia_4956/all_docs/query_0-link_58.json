        "text": "Note: As always, corrections welcome – this isn’t an exact science, especially when talking about youngsters get their first exposure to the wider cognition\n\nIt’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas.\n\nIt may still be 11 months until Christmas, but because the Six Nations is around the corner, and squads are being named.\n\nIt’s the next year of U20s, where we get a chance to learn about the future of rugby. We’ve seen a lot of talent pass through the U20 Six Nations, and it’s a tournament that has consistently prepared young stars for the grind of professional life.\n\nThat said, in the year 2020 the birthdates of this group of U20 players will, by definition, make some of you yearn for a fonder time. Where does the time go?\n\nThere are so many points to make about the 2020 Irish squad, that I’ll remind you of a number of bullet points before getting to the actual squad for every squad breakdown\n\nI’m not claiming to be an expert on these players, nor have I seen all of them in the flesh. I may be wrong on some, but this article is intended to give the casual rugby fan some knowledge so that they will be more interested in watching some U20s rugby, and can be that guy down the pub who says ‘watch out for that O’Driscoll character, I hear he’s good’.\n\nOn that note, these players are by definition 20 or younger, and not all of them will reach the professional ranks. There will be consciously less ‘criticism’ of anyone, and if there are negatives mentioned – it means that the player is definitely good enough to have a long pro career.\n\nRelating to this squad, there are 37 players included. That’s a squad packed with talent and depth in a lot of positions. There are 11 U19s involved, as well as seven more with previous U20 experience – that’s a nice blend that both bodes well for this year and next. That said, there are some notable omissions, even accounting for sprint Aaron Sexton’s focus on 7s.\n\nSome players who were involved with the U20 squad last year who were left out this time around include Munster academy lock Paddy Kelly and Sale flanker Ciaran Booth. Some notable U19 players who would have been close to selection but miss out include Mark Donnelly, Sam Illo, Rob Gilsenan, Nathan Doak, Shane Jennings, Ben Carson, Josh O’Connor, and Conor Rankin. These players, along with the 11 included should form the backbone of next year’s squad along with some school leavers. Who knows? You might even see some of them by the end of July.\n\nOther unlucky omissions to keep an eye on include: Shane Buckley, Mark Nicholson, Fionn Finlay, Liam Winnett, Conor McMenamin, Cormac Izuchukwu, Jody Booth, Lucas Culliton, Ryan O’Neill, Jack Barry, Charlie O’Doherty, Paddy McKenzie, Jack Delaney, Sam Dardis. McMenamin in particular was someone who stood out to me at international U18s level but second row ended up being fiercely competitive.\n\nIn terms of talent in this squad, there is plenty to be excited about. It’s perhaps not approaching 2016 levels where there was a James Ryan, Andrew Porter, Jacob Stockdale, and Max Deegan; but it does compare well to last year’s group. There may not be the strength in depth from last year especially in key areas – but the U19s that have been pulled in are both strong prospects in their own right, but also in possible weak areas.\n\nLast week’s senior international squad is a good reminder that while the U20s produce a good number of players, not getting selected to the squads, or even getting selected to start does not mean you can’t make it. Robert Baloucoune is a recent call-up who didn’t play U20s and is still only 22.\n\nIn the same breath, Caelan Doris is only a year and a bit removed from his star turn for Ireland U20s in their relegation escape at the World Championships which highlights both a) how close these guys are, and b) the team doesn’t need to win games to produce gems. A note too for last year’s standout Craig Casey on his first senior Munster try this weekend against Ospreys. I’m looking forward to watching his career with interest\n\nSee Also: Ireland U20 Six Nations Squad 2019\n\nNow, onto the good stuff. Usually, I list the players in a breakdown by position – but in an unprecedented turn – Noel McNamara announced the squad in what essentially turned out to be a depth chart:\n\nIreland U20 Squad 2020 1. Loosehead Prop Charlie Ward Marcus Hannan Harry Noonan 2. Hooker Tom Stewart* John McKee Bobby Sheehan 3. Tighthead Prop Tom Clarkson Ryan McMahon* 4. Lock Brian Deeney Eoin O’Connor 5. Lock Thomas Ahern Joe McCarthy* 6. Blindside Flanker Alex Soroka* Cian Prendergast Cian Hurley 7. Openside Flanker Sean O’Brien Mark Hernan Anthony Ryan No. 8 David McCann Joshua Dunne 9. Scrumhalf Lewis Finlay Ben Murphy* Conor McKee* 10. Outhalf Jack Crowley Cathal Forde* Tim Corkery* 12. Inside Centre Hayden Hyde Ben Moxham 13. Outside Centre Harry O’Riordan* Luis Faria Dan Kelly* 11. Left Wing Andrew Smith Niall Comerford 14. Right Wing Ethan McIlroy Diarmuid Kilgallen 15. Fullbacks Oran McNulty Max O’Reilly *denotes U19, bold denotes U20 experience, underline denotes provincial experience\n\nNote: No.5 Lock / Flankers subject to change – Alex Soroka could play lock or blindside – so could be 3rd choice 5 or 1st choice 6. Similarly, Sean O’Brien could be 3rd choice 6, or 1st choice 7.\n\nIt’s 2020 and there’s still a debate on whether Sean O’Brien is a 6 or a 7.\n\nFRONT ROW\n\nThere are three front-rowers back from last year’s Grand Slam winning side. Ever-present Thomas Clarkson headlines the returnees with his tighthead backup from last year Charlie Ward and hooker John McKee joining him for another year.\n\nWard has played both sides of the scrum – and while he was predominantly a tighthead last year – he’s been featuring for Leinster A on the loosehead side and it looks like he’s pencilled in to start there for Ireland. His main competition will be between two impressive Leinster clubs prospects in Marcus Hannan from Clane RFC and Harry Noonan from Greystones RFC. It’s very close between those two to backup Ward – and I wouldn’t be surprised to see either of them usurp Ward into the starting lineup. It’ll be a great battle between three talented props. Both Hannan and Ward will be looking to join Ward in the Leinster academy – but it would be worth each province having a look at these two.\n\nClarkson is etched in stone to start at tighthead. In case you missed him last year, he displayed all of the qualities of a veteran scrum cornerstone. High work-rate, low error-rate, very solid and can be relied upon. Most young tightheads are forced to wait for their breakthrough into senior ranks because they can’t do what comes naturally to Clarkson. He’s focused on being more impactful around the park this year – so get ready to see some improved ball carrying to go along with his impressive stability. There’s only one other natural tighthead named in the squad, partly because of Ward’s ability to switch, and that’s former Clongowes U19 tighthead, Ryan McMahon. McMahon will benefit from learning from Clarkson and Ward, and should be in a good position to take over next year ahead of other strong contenders in Sam Illo or Mark Donnelly.\n\nFormer Ulster underage prop turned Leinster academy hooker John McKee returns and looks to be backing up a very talented prospect. McKee has been captain for Ireland U18s as a prop showing his leadership, but his year in U20s wasn’t smooth last year. He started the year as the definitive backup to powerhouse Dylan Tierney-Martin, but by the end of the year was giving up time to Declan Adamson. The prime contender to take the starting hooker spot is Ulster’s U19 hooker, Tom Stewart. Stewart is an outstanding rugby player. He plays as if he’s cloned himself and there’s a Tom Stewart at 7 wrecking the breakdown, and one at 12 – running line-breaking angles and smashing defenders back. His throwing is good, but inconsistent – there are games where he goes 100%, and other games where it’s closer to 50%. He’s young enough, and with more and better coaching that can and will improve. There are players he reminds me of, but I’ll remind quiet if only to dampen my own excitement. Leinster have been very impressed with Bobby Sheehan too – who has been fantastic for Leinster A off the bench in place of his brother, Dan, as well as shining in the AIL.\n\nPredicted lineup:\n\n1. Charlie Ward, 2. Tom Stewart, 3. Thomas Clarkson; 16. John McKee, 17. Marcus Hannon, 18. Ryan McMahon\n\nSECOND ROW\n\nTwo returnees from last year – Wexford’s Brian Deeney and Thomas Ahern from Youghal RFC are two gems from growing rugby hotbeds. They are both projected to start this year. Both really impressed in the World Cup – Deeney packing down at 8 showcasing his pace, strength, and ball-carrying; and Ahern showing off his freakish athleticism for a 6’7” lock. Backing them up are a trio of U19s – the highly talented Alex Soroka (who, like Deeney, can also play 6 and 8), Eoin O’Connor, and Joe McCarthy. Soroka has been earmarked as a prospect since schools as he tore throw smaller players – it will be interesting to see how he fares as the competition gets bigger and stronger. He’s a candidate to start at blindside based on the depth chart released – but given his versatility, I’m unsure whether’s he’s listed as the 3rd choice lock or 1st choice blindside.\n\nPredicted lineup:\n\n4. Brian Deeney, 5. Thomas Ahern; 19. Joe McCarthy\n\nBACK ROW\n\nShould Soroka not be named blindside flanker – Newbridge’s Cian Prendergast is in line to be the starter. He’s also capable of playing lock, but would see himself more as a blindside flanker. Prendergast and his listed backup, Clonakilty’s Cian Hurley are two of the players I would know least about.\n\nA theme of this year’s squad is the versatility – particularly in the back five. Just like Soroka, Deeney, and Prendergast – the remaining five backrowers can all play across the back row.\n\nSean O’Brien is listed as the starter at openside (I think), with St. Michael’s cup winning captain Mark Hernan riding an impressive schools run into the squad. Clongowes Anthony Ryan is another who could play openside. Sean O’Brien 4.0 – the Blackrock version and Ryan would be more comfortable swapping sides than Hernan would be – and Ryan could be an option at 8 too. All have high engines to get around the park – with Hernan being a high tackle numbers and breakdown player than Ryan who could carry you into a brick wall.\n\nCaptain David McCann is a hugely impressive figure. Already on the fringes of the Ulster senior team, McCann shone in limited minutes last year, and seems to be fighting with Azur Allison to be the main backrow prospect up North. He’s the definite starter at 8 as captain, and we could see a battle between those two similar to Deegan and Doris in Leinster. Connacht’s Joshua Dunne will back him up, and could force his way onto the bench with his versatility.\n\nPredicted lineup:\n\n6. Alex Soroka, 7. Sean O’Brien, 8. David McCann (c); 20. Mark Hernan\n\nSCRUMHALF\n\n2019 was a U20 class for the ages for Ireland. Craig Casey was a class apart in driving Ireland to the Grand Slam, and he’s already showing signs of his promise in Munster. Now, it’s Ulster’s turn to provide scrumhalves for Ireland in both presumed starter Lewis Finlay, and U19 backup Conor McKee. Finlay is a tidy operator who should provide clean ball for an exciting crop of outside backs. He’s got a decent pass, and will keep defenses honest around the fringes too.\n\nPres Bray’s Ben Murphy, son of Ireland skills coach, Richie, looks to be ahead of McKee for the backup to Finlay.\n\nPredicted lineup:\n\n9. Lewis Finlay; 21. Ben Murphy\n\nOUTHALF\n\nThe difference between Ireland being a group with a number of quality future pros, and a team who can compete at the top whilst providing the Irish pro game with prospects usually lies with how good the outhalf is. 10s, especially in Ireland, need to be able to control the game – dictating it away from some getting into a physical battle that rarely suits them – while suppling a flying group of outside backs with enough ball in time and space to capitalise on scoring opportunities.\n\nIn 2019, Harry Byrne and Ben Healy were two standout operators in that department, and Ireland flourished as a result. Cork Con’s Jack Crowley, a part-time Simpsons character, will be hoping to instill the Irish backs with some ‘Puma Pride’. Crowley is a relatively late bloomer to the national scene – with both Wicklow’s Paddy McKenzie and Munster’s Jack Delaney taking the 10 shirt at U18 and U19 level for this agegroup. That’s not to detract from Crowley’s ability – he’s got everything you want in a 10 at this level, especially in his decision making and distribution that intrigues you.\n\nCrowley should dominate the minutes at 10 for Ireland, but McNamara has elected to future-plan for next year by having Connacht U19 Cathal Forde and U19 Leinster A starter Tim Corkery duel it out for the 22 shirt.\n\nPredicted lineup:\n\n10. Jack Crowley; 22. Cathal Forde\n\nCENTRES\n\nThere are high expectations for this group of centres. That’s perhaps lead by Hayden Hyde. The Ulster centre was highly-rated coming through the Exiles program, and has impressed for Ulster A in combination with last year’s favourite Stewart Moore. Now though, Hyde will move into the 12 jersey to accommodate another high riser in Munster U19 captain Harry O’Riordan.\n\nThere is a lot you can say about Hyde that can also be said about O’Riordan. Neither are at Stuart McCloskey or Peter Robb levels of big – but both are larger than your average Irish centre. Despite this, both have impressive speed, with Hyde possessing a wonderful fleet of foot. These two should provide Ireland with some good front-foot ball, and both have the ability to create linebreaks on the inside or outside. O’Riordan’s defensive instincts are also impressive, and he was very commanding as captain of Munster U19s this year. He’d be an early contender for captain next season. Both run brilliant lines through defenses and will be interesting to see them switch up who runs angles off Crowley to take up ball or act as a decoy whilst the other works in tandem with the outside backs to create width.\n\nJust getting a spot in the centres for this squad was competitive – with highly-rated underage centres Shane Jennings (U19) and Ben Carson (U18) in consideration, with Karl Martin (U18) also one to watch. In their place is Ballymena and former Ireland U18 7s representative Ben Moxham at 12, with Newpark and DUFC’s Luis Faria and another Exile product U19 Ben Kelly. Faria had been the starting 13 for this age group before O’Riordan was promoted, whilst Kelly is highly rated after an outstanding season for Loughborough and will be highly sought after on both sides of the Irish sea.\n\nPredicted lineup:\n\n12. Hayden Hyde, 13. Harry O’Riordan\n\nBACK THREE\n\nWith everything going well, the back three should be the limelight hogging stars of the squad. The talent is definitely there for Ireland U20s outside backs to do that.\n\nLeinster A and another St.Michael’s product, winger Andrew Smith is a fantastic finisher (as can be seen below) and is in good form having scored a hat-trick in the warm-up trials against Munster Development. Recent Ulster debutant Ethan McIlroy will take the other wing spot opposite Smith. McIlroy is very fluid in his movements, gliding across the field with impressive footwork. His Ulster debut had some mistakes, but the youngster settled well and is a great runner in open field.\n\nBringing everything together from fullback will be Connacht’s Oran McNulty. A smaller fullback who can both create space for himself and others – McNulty will be a great foil for Crowley to play-make out wide in a similar way to Flannery last year – but McNulty is more of a natural 15 having spent several years in the back three.\n\nBacking the starters up are two pure wingers in Blackrock’s Niall Comerford and Connacht’s Diarmuid Kilgallen. McNulty backed up by St. Gerard’s Max O’Reilly. O’Reilly is the only one of the back three with U20 experience having been a late call-up to the World Cup as injury cover last year. Both Smith and McIlroy have the versatility to play fullback as well and are likely covering McNulty too – which would give the bench spot edge to the wingers or centres cover.\n\nPredicted lineup:\n\n11. Andrew Smith, 14. Ethan McIlroy, 15. Oran McNulty; 23. Niall Comerford\n\nEXPECTATIONS\n\nAs always, the expectations for any U20s shouldn’t be about winning. Last year’s squad did better than anyone could have anticipated in the Six Nations before the injury bug halted a strong start in a tough pool in the World Championship.\n\nThis squad isn’t as strong as last year’s on first glance – but it’s not far off. It’s also fair to say that the competition among the rest of the Six Nations teams aren’t as strong as they were last year. France are rightly the favourites, with England not far behind. But England will be impacted by some of their better players being retained by their clubs which can be a difference maker. Wales will be interesting to keep an eye on with Ioan Lloyd a superstar in the making. That said, third place in the Six Nations should be the minimum aim before looking ahead to a lighter World Cup pool than last year than gives Ireland to go far if they stay injury free.\n\nFrom last year:\n\nSuccess at U20s level is measured by what happens to the players after U20s, and this year [2019] may end up pleasantly surprising you by 2023.\n\nThere are more than a few players in the class of 2020 whom you can say the same things about. The 2020s will be a fun decade.\n\nSee Also: World Rugby U20 Championship Preview: Ireland Squad Breakdown\n\nIt’s time for something a little bit different. At the close of the U20 tournaments, there will be a lot of articles from individual countries’ media about what players played well or who we should watch in the future, without much consideration for the challenges that are ahead of them.\n\nOftentimes, it takes some players longer to break through in the senior ranks – which isn’t a bad thing; but by then some fans will have forgotten how good these players are and will be clamouring for the next big thing.\n\nSo instead, I’ll be looking at each player that played for the Ireland U20s this season who won’t be back next year, at what their strengths are, what competition they’ll have to get game time in the senior ranks, and how I can envision their development going forward. Some players should be able to play right away during the World Cup, other players might need some more time in the gym.\n\nThat means no U19 players like:\n\nThomas Clarkson U19 Tighthead Prop\n\nMichael Milne U19 Loosehead Prop\n\nCharlie Ward U19 Tighthead Prop\n\nJohn McKee U19 Hooker\n\nThomas Ahern U19 Lock\n\nBrian Deeny U19 Lock/Backrow\n\nPaddy Kelly U19 Lock\n\nCiaran Booth U19 Flanker\n\nDavid McCann U19 Backrow\n\nMartin Molony U19 Backrow\n\nMax O’Reilly U19 Back three\n\nSo here’s a player by player guide on how their year went, what their immediate prospects are, who is in their way. The main goal is for every player to become regular internationals, but that’s just not realistic to expect for every single player. Others might be fringe internationals, or regular contributors for their province’s European games. For me, I’ll set the bar as being capable of playing European games on a regular basis, given that some players may end up getting to the PRO14 level but no further.\n\nThat’s only one aspect of what needs to happen to a player to\n\nPROPS:\n\nJosh Wycherley (Young Munster / Munster Academy – Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nThe starter from the start of the year until the end, Wycherley was a key cog for the Ireland U20s both in the Six Nations and the World Cup. His durability was impressive, as was his performance that ensured he was unchallenged for the loosehead prop position.\n\nWycherley does the basics very well – he is an excellent scrummager who is more likely to cause the opposition problems than be under pressure. He’s got a brilliant motor that gets through work in tight spaces – but he’s more than comfortable in open spaces running at opponents or into space. His handling skills are very good, most evidently in setting Ryan Baird into space up the wing for the lock’s try against New Zealand. Wycherley doesn’t have many weaknesses, so his development will just involve continuing to improve in every aspect of his game and to continue to learn and gain experience.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nWycherley was already in the Munster academy before this season of Ireland U20s, which means that his prospects of a pro future are excellent.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nWycherley has all of the ability to make it. Unfortunately, his path to the Munster loosehead prop position is filled with quality players in his way. Dave Kilcoyne, James Cronin, Jeremy Loughman, Liam O’Connor. Wycherley is highly rated within Munster’s ranks though, and featured heavily in this year’s Cara Cup.\n\nGiuseppe Coyne (DUFC / Leinster A (Cara Cup))\n\nHow the year went:\n\nFirst, the positives – Giuseppe Coyne was originally named in the extended Six Nations squad of 40 players.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s the only positive of Coyne’s Ireland U20 career. His name wasn’t included in another press release for the rest of the year, no matchday squad involvements, and he wasn’t included in the 28 man squad for the World Championships.\n\nThat he didn’t play isn’t a death knell on his pro career, but it’s not a wonderful sign.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nFortunately for Coyne, he is in the Leinster system having been involved in the Cara Cup squad for Leinster A. Coyne will hope to be involved in the academy or sub-academy and attempt to continue to prove himself with Leinster.\n\nHe should also get a good amount of game-time in the AIL with DUFC which will be big for his development. He’s a prop, so he has time on his side.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nThere are a lot of loosehead props in the Leinster system. A lot of them have more pedigree than Coyne having played for the Ireland U20s when they were eligible, and they have had to sit behind Lions Cian Healy and Jack McGrath. With McGrath gone – Ed Byrne, Peter Dooley, and Healy are still the top three.\n\nLuke Masters (Shannon / Munster A (CELTIC Cup))\n\nHow the year went:\n\nMasters’ year only went slightly better than Coyne’s. Named in a matchday squad against Scotland in the second game, Masters was an unused replacement as McNamara preferred to either keep Thomas Clarkson or shift Michael Milne over to cover tighthead in the Six Nations, with Charlie Ward taking over as the tighthead backup in the World Cup.\n\nTherefore, Masters was another player with no Ireland U20 game-time from this season. Like Coyne, Masters was involved in the Cara Cup with Munster A which is a big positive in being involved in the Munster system.\n\nWhat’s Next/ Roadblocks:\n\nMasters was a surprise non-addition to the full Munster academy, but he did feature in Munster’s Celtic Cup campaign, so perhaps he’s still in with a shot of joining at a later date.\n\nRyan Lomas (Galwegians)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nA theme appeared at tighthead prop in the Six Nations, with both Luke Masters and Ryan Lomas being selected in matchday squad and not getting any time on the field. Lomas was named in three matchday squads where Clarkson played the full 80 in each game.\n\nWhat’s Next/ Roadblocks:\n\nTighthead prop is an interesting position for Connacht. Finlay Bealham is a good young prop that should be around for a long time, so the starting position isn’t really up for grabs. Behind him though, there has been a lot of turnover – Conor Carey and Conan O’Donnell have both left the province, leaving Rory O’Connor, Conor Kenny, and Dominic Rogers McCoy as the only options. There would appear to be an opening in the academy for a tighthead prop, and if there was a province that doesn’t mind a player not being involved with the Irish U20s, it’s Connacht.\n\nHOOKERS:\n\nDylan Tierney-Martin (Corinthians / Connacht Academy – Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nFantastically well. Tierney-Martin established himself as one of Ireland’s key players for the entirety of the season and was a player that Ireland relied on, in the World Cup. He also featured in the U20 World Championships team of the tournament.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nTierney-Martin enters his second year in the Connacht Academy and should be looking to make his PRO14 debut if not this season, in the next season. Tierney-Martin showed that he can do everything that a hooker needs to do, he just needs experience and to keep doing what he’s doing when he plays.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nThere are a number of bodies in front of Tierney-Martin in Connacht, but there is an argument to say that he has the biggest ceiling of all of them. Tom McCartney is 33 years old and slowing down after an impressive Connacht career so far, Jonny Murphy is a new signing that is an unknown, whilst Dave Heffernan and Shane Delahunt have been competing for the starting spot.\n\nBilly Scannell (Biarritz)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nIt was an injury disrupted year for Scannell after an impressive season previously. He featured in just 16 minutes of action in the Six Nations, and wasn’t involved in the World Championships at all as John McKee won the battle to become Dylan Tierney-Martin’s understudy, and then Declan Adamson leapfrogged Scannell into the 3rd hooker spot to begin the World Championships leaving Scannell at home.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nScannell was another surprise absentee from the players who joined Munster’s academy, but he has joined French club Biarritz’s academy on a two-year deal.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nThe path at Munster does seem full of roadblocks, so Billy’s path at Biarritz will be interesting. He’s just the 4th hooker at the club, with 32-year-old Elvis Levi (whose contract runs out at the end of the year), 25-year-old Romain Ruffenach (a new addition from Montpeiller), and another long-time academy hooker Lucas Peyresblanques whose contract runs out at the end of the season.\n\nDeclan Adamson (Clontarf / Connacht Academy – Year 1)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nAdamson had quite a year. Fantastic form in the AIL didn’t seem like it was enough to get him involved in the Six Nations, but then Adamson featured in Connacht’s Cara Cup squad and then was able to leapfrog Billy Scannell to make the World Cup squad. Adamson didn’t have a lot of game-time in Argentina, but he impressed and will hope to continue his momentum into next year.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nConnacht’s interest in Adamson was evident despite Tierney-Martin’s presence in their academy, and Adamson has joined their academy. Whatever roadblocks Tierney-Martin has now applies to Adamson who does appear to be slightly behind his U20 international teammate.\n\nSECOND-ROW:\n\nCharlie Ryan (UCD / Leinster Academy – Year 1)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nTaking over from David Hawkshaw as the Ireland U20 captain after the centre went down through injury. Ryan started most games, and in the ones he didn’t – he was being rested. The lock was a consistently impressive performer impressing most onlookers.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nRyan enters the Leinster academy this year after his impressive year and will have a lot of competition for playing time. Because of the nature of that competition, Ryan will likely have to wait until 2020/21 before he comes into consideration for Leinster.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nHe’ll be joining a very young group of locks that feature recent U20s Jack Dunne, Oisin Dowling, and Ryan’s teammate Ryan Baird. Those three St. Michael’s alums back up Scott Fardy, Devin Toner, James Ryan, and Ross Molony. Fardy has just re-signed with Leinster on a short contract, but he and Toner are the only players there that you can see may not be around in 4/5 years time. That’s quite a backlog of impressive young locks that Leinster have, and Ryan will be at the end of the queue.\n\nRyan Baird (DUFC / Leinster Academy – Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nThe start of the year wasn’t what Baird had in mind after an injury ruled him out of the first three games before he made his return from the bench in the final two games and provided a big spark.\n\nBaird then went on to shine in the World Championships despite a red card against Australia for a high tackle. The highlight of his tournament was a monstrous display against New Zealand where he scored a try that Keith Earls would have been proud of.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nBaird is already in the Leinster academy straight from school ahead of Charlie Ryan, and therefore one can assume he is highly thought of inside Leinster circles. He will need to get an injury free run, and will be looking to make an impact at PRO14 level sooner rather than later.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nAs mentioned with Ryan, Leinster have a lot of young locks at their disposal so it will be difficult. Baird seems to be highly rated in Leinster however, and has appeared for the senior team this season already.\n\nNiall Murray (Buccaneers / Connacht Academy – Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nWith Ryan Baird’s injury to start the season, Murray cemented himself in the Irish team during the Six Nations – with his performances impressing enough to keep Baird out of the team on his return from injury. Murray showcased impressive lineout nous and a good workrate to show that he’s yet another impressive lock in the Connacht system. Unfortunately for Murray, he was demoted to the bench for the big games in the World Cup as Baird shone – but was still able to show his quality in more limited time. I would classify Murray’s year as very positive despite the semi-negative ending because he showed that he definitely has the ability and drive to make it as a pro. Now he’s just got to do it…\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nMurray is already in the Connacht academy as the sole lock, but there are five senior locks ahead of him in the pecking order. With Connacht now in the Champions Cup instead of the Challenge Cup, Murray will need to continue his development – probably adding some bulk to his frame first. A PRO14 appearance isn’t out of the question this season, but it may have to wait until next year.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nAs mentioned, there are five senior locks on the Connacht books at the moment and two backrowers who have played lock in the past. Of those five second-rows, four are 25 or younger, with only Quinn Roux (28) older than that. That suggests that none may leave anytime soon, so it’ll be up to Murray to impress when he does get the chance to force his way up the pecking order. Connacht have usually been willing to try young guys out in recent years, but it’s worth noting that Cillian Gallagher (21) was a two-year standout at Ireland U20 level and he is being brought through very slowly having only made six senior appearances so far. Similarly, last year’s signing Joe Maksymiw didn’t get too many opportunities either, and will be looking to force his way into Friend’s reckoning. Murray’s got time on his side, but it may be a while before we see him play. That isn’t always a bad thing, we just need to have patience sometimes. Injuries to second rows has seen Murray named in the European squad, so he isn’t too far away.\n\nJJ McKee (Ballymena)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nNot wonderful. Like Giuseppe Coyne, the only time McKee’s name was mentioned all year was in the press release that announced the original 40-man Ireland U20 squad for the Six Nations. To be fair to McKee, he was stuck behind three huge talents at U20 in Ryan, Baird, and Murray; and there are some promising U19 stars like Thomas Ahern, Paddy Kelly, and Brian Deeny that were available to play too.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nIt’s hard to say. At the time of writing, McKee isn’t in the Ulster academy with Ulster having already named their class. But, there wasn’t a lock announced that was joining, and the two second-rows currently in the academy are entering their final year.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nFor now, McKee will have to prove himself in the AIL to try and attract the attention of Kieran Campbell and the Ulster staff.\n\nBACK-ROW:\n\nScott Penny (UCD / Leinster)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nIt’s hard to say that the year could have gone any better for Penny. Back in September/October he was scoring tries for fun for the Leinster A team, before earning some gametime with the Leinster senior team over Christmas and scoring again. Penny was a key contributor for Ireland’s U20 Grand Slam, and got some more time with the senior team at Leinster before the end of the year. It was ultimately decided that Penny needed surgery and a longer pre-season instead of delaying surgery to go with Ireland to the World Cup, which hints that Lancaster and Cullen will look to play him a lot to begin next season. Penny’s already signed senior contract terms too and is beyond the academy after just one year after joining straight from school\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nJust keep going. Penny needs to continue his form in the game-time he gets and Leinster will continue to nurse his talents through. It won’t be too long before Andy Farrell calls him into extended squads for Ireland either.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nThere are some, Leinster have an abundance of talent in the back-row, and most of the players are still young. There are players always coming through too, but Penny seems closer to the higher end of the talent spectrum. That said – a fit Dan Leavy, Josh van der Flier, and Will Connors are already in the senior squad at openside flanker so competition will be fierce. We know that van der Flier will be with Ireland a lot creating some time, and Leavy could take a long time getting himself healthy which leaves Connors and Penny battling for a starting spot, and then battling for a possible bench position.\n\nUltimately though, Penny’s talent will see him play for Leinster plenty through the next season or two, and the competition in the back-row will ensure he’s brought through slowly and not too fast. After that though, things will need to be reassessed to see where he is in the pecking order, and who will have to leave to get the right game-time for everyone.\n\nAzur Allison (Ballymena / Ulster Academy – Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nAllison was expected to follow in the footsteps of Max Deegan and Caelan Doris to be Ireland’s impact No.8 for the year, but an unfortunate injury ruled him out of the Six Nations where Hodnett took control. With Scott Penny’s injury, Allison was afforded a chance to start in the World Championships (because Hodnett shifted from 8 to 7). Allison’s tournament struggled to get off the ground after an early concussion in the first game. He returned to start two of the final three games and looked good – but it wasn’t to the level that Allison had shown in previous years. As we move further away from this injury-plagued year, Allison will be better for it and show his true form.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nAn injury-free run for Allison would be great. A starring role in the Celtic Cup would kickstart his season where he could get a look-in in the senior team.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nUlster’s record bringing through talented young forwards is not good, with Lorcan Dow’s talent spring to mind in particular. Allison will have to beat those odds and be the first Ulster homegrown back-row to break through the academy to get to the fringe of the Irish squad since Chris Henry or Stephen Ferris (Corrections welcome).\n\nJohn Hodnett (UCC / Munster academy year 1)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nA brilliant year for the UCC flier. Hodnett shone in the Six Nations, fast becoming a fan favourite for his all-action ball-carrying style. Hodnett looks comfortable both carrying in the tight and out wide, and was able to get his hands free and release the outside backs on several occasions. He’s got a high motor and was able to prove his breakdown nous at the World Championships too.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nHodnett was one of the few to join the Munster academy. As for most backrowers, Hodnett will need to continue his strength development over the next year, playing in some AIL games before being thrown into the senior arena.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nUnfortunately, there are a few things in the way for Hodnett. First, there’s the reality that not too many backrowers of Hodnett’s height end up playing a huge role in the senior ranks. It’s not a death knell to Hodnett’s career but it’s worth noting. He’s listed as exactly the same height at CJ Stander which both gives a slight warning and boost on this front.\n\nSecondly, Munster aren’t exactly lacking in backrowers who can play at No.8. Peter O’Mahony and CJ Stander are fixtures in the row – currently blocking the paths of Jack O’Donoghue, Gavin Coombes, and Jack O’Sullivan already. Arno Botha is another option in the squad. The positive for Hodnett came during the World Championships where he showed how natural he was shifting to 7, which isn’t something that comes as easy to the others listed.\n\nHodnett featured in Munster’s senior preseason games but has been playing UBL of late to get more time with Jack O’Sullivan at UCC.\n\nRonan Watters (St. Mary’s College / Leinster a (Celtic cup))\n\nHow the year went:\n\nAn eight-minute sub appearance in the Six Nations was all we had to go on for Watters before he shot into the spotlight at the World Championships. Watters held firm with a string of impressive and consistent performances as all of his backrow mates fell to injuries around him.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nUnfortunately, Watters wasn’t included in the Leinster academy intake with U19 forwards Brian Deeny and Martin Moloney selected ahead of him and joining an already young, talented, and crowded depth chart. Given how and when academy contracts are decided, Watters starring World Cup may not have mattered in that decision, but he was definitely good enough to catch on somewhere and fits the profile of the likes of Greg Jones, Kelvin Brown, or Eoghan Clarke of a replacement to a highly talented player who gets a chance to play and consistently shows his ability.\n\nWatters was a feature of Leinster’s Celtic Cup-winning back-row though, and with some injuries may be kept around.\n\nLuke Clohessy (Shannon)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nA late addition into the World Cup squad after a horrendous run of injuries to the Irish backrows. Clohessy came in and made three sub appearances playing very nicely. Clohessy did feature for Munster A and Development teams during the year and looks to be firmly in their system.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nClohessy wasn’t announced as part of Munster’s smaller than expected academy intake. He’s still got a chance to join during the year, or next season – but as mentioned with Hodnett, there are a lot of 6/8s ahead of him in Munster.\n\nHe’s got the genes though.\n\nSCRUM-HALF:\n\nCraig Casey (Shannon / Munster)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nIt’s probably fair to say that Casey’s year surpassed even Craig’s wildest dreams. Signing a senior deal with Munster after just one year in the academy and making his debut for the senior side was the icing on a dominant U20 campaign. There were some injuries, but Casey displayed his phenomal passing and proved that he plays bigger than his 5’6” stature to ease any doubts about him being too small to play at a higher level. I’ve been vocal about how good Casey is elsewhere, and whilst I can’t say enough good things about his determination, grit, and talent – this article is taking an age to write.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nThe good: Casey’s already made his Munster debut. Unlike most in the Ireland U20s squad who should be just aiming to make their debuts – Casey should be aiming for some semi-regular gametime, and hopefully up to 10/15 matchday squad involvements.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nUnfortunately, Munster have more bodies at scrumhalf than feet Casey is tall. Even with Murray away with Ireland until November, Alby Mathewson is signed until then, Neil Cronin ended the season really well, Nick McCarthy was signed for some reason. Jack Stafford was ahead of Casey in the academy and should be ready to make his debut soon too.\n\nIn Casey’s favour – clearly Munster think highly enough of him to sign him to senior terms already. Against that, Mathewson was extended until November and McCarthy brought in. Who knows where anyone other than Murray stands in the pecking order.\n\nColm Reilly (Buccaneers / Connacht Academy Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nThe year improved for Reilly as it went on. Entering the campaign already in the Connacht academy, Reilly was clearly third choice scrumhalf in the Six Nations gaining 30 minutes of bench time after Casey’s injuries. However, between the end of the Six Nations and the World Championships, Reilly was promoted above Foley to become the main backup to Casey. Reilly was solid deputising for Casey and played the full 80 minutes in Ireland’s near-demolition of Italy. Reilly wasn’t brought on in three games for the World Championship, but he was the only scrumhalf brought on for Casey when the Munster star was taken off against Australia.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nReilly is currently the only scrumhalf in the Connacht academy after Stephen Kerins graduated this summer, but there are young options already in the senior squad. For next season, Reilly will look to force himself in the Buccaneers plans in the AIL before making his Connacht debut the following season.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nConnacht’s academy has been very fruitful recently producing some very good players. However, there have been a lot of scrumhalves enter the westerner’s academy with only Kieran Marmion and Caolan Blade graduating and hanging around for long after that. Ryan Feehily, Conor Lowndes, and Conor McKeon have all left the province without being able to fulfil their potential. Kerins shone for the Ireland U20s in their march to the final in 2016, so he’ll be looking to take the 3rd scrumhalf spot from Angus Lloyd (26). The top two are currently untouchable in Caolan Blade (25) and Kieran Marmion (27) who are either in or on the fringes of the Ireland squad.\n\nGraham Curtis (Ulster Academy Year 3)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nCurtis wasn’t named in any Irish squad announcement but was pictured training with the squad during the Six Nations. He’s mentioned here because he’s entering his final year of Ulster academy and therefore has some pro prospects. The hard thing is though, I haven’t had a chance to actually see him play yet.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nCurtis is in his final year of the Ulster academy, and Dan McFarland hasn’t been shy in giving youngsters their chance. Curtis should be looking to play for the senior side sooner rather than later but will face competition from Dave Shanahan and Jonny Stewart while (if) John Cooney is at the World Cup.\n\nCurtis does seem to be shifted towards the wing in recent games for Ulster Ravens and in the UBL so we’ll see how that move goes.\n\nCormac Foley (St. Mary’s College / Leinster A (CELTIC Cup))\n\nHow the year went:\n\nThe Six Nations didn’t go too badly for Foley. He was the firm second choice behind Casey and was a key contributor off the bench and in filling in for Casey when the Munsterman was injured. Things didn’t go wonderfully for the talented scrumhalf after that though, as Reilly seemed to leapfrog him, and Foley was shifted back into his schools position of 12 in the World Cup after injuries.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nFoley was a surprise omission in the Leinster academy for me and was only sporadically included in Leinster A’s bench in the Celtic Cup. He may have to prove some things in the UBL before he joins Noel McNamara’s Leinster academy.\n\nOUT-HALF:\n\nHarry Byrne (UCD / Leinster Academy Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nAn injury-hit year for Byrne sounds like a bad year, but he was good enough in the games that he played. There was clear development between last year’s showing from Byrne, and he showed that he’s ready to step up to more high profile games.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nEventually Harry Byrne made his PRO14 debut and took to it like a duck to water. He’s still in the mix for the 3rd choice with Ciaran Frawley, but hopefully his emergence will get him more time on the pitch and shift Frawley back to his more natural position of 12 or 15.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nThe Ireland starter is the firm 1st choice, but his time is managed with Leinster giving a spot behind older brother Ross with two contenders – Harry and Ciaran Frawley. Harry’s started the season well, so he has staked him claim to that 3rd spot.\n\nBen Healy (Garryowen / Munster Academy Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nIn pure selections, Healy’s year wasn’t ideal. He filled in for an injury-hit Harry Byrne during the Six Nations, but was confined to 2nd choice again in the World Cup despite Byrne’s absence with Jake Flannery being trusted more. Healy’s performances though was fantastic and the control and talent at 10 never went down when Healy was on. His massive boot was a big advantage for Ireland in the World Cup, and his handling and creativity to put his outside backs into space was a highlight.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nHealy probably isn’t as ready to play in the PRO14 as Harry Byrne would be. That said, Healy needs as much gametime as possible. Healy is in his 2nd year of the Munster academy, he needs as much AIL time and Munster A games as possible. The goal should be to make his PRO14 debut in 2020 or 2021.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nDespite the departures of Bill Johnston and Ian Keatley, Munster still have a plethora of players they play at outhalf. Carbery is currently the incumbent, with Tyler Bleyendaal and JJ Hanrahan soaking up all of the minutes when Carbery is with Ireland. If there’s an injury during any international games, Healy might be next up, but Rory Scannell could be another option.\n\nBruce Houston (Ballymena / Ulster Academy Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nHouston had an interesting year. He was the only Ireland U20 outhalf squad member not to be named in a matchday squad for the U20s and was the only outhalf in the squad that played in the PRO14. With no gametime for the U20s, Houston is one of the players in this squad I’ve seen nothing of, so I this’ll be more focused on the situation he’s in.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nHouston’s in an interesting spot with Ulster bringing in 22-year-old Bill Johnston to compete with Billy Burns for the starting job. With Johnny McPhillips departure for Leicester, Houston is the only other out-and-out outhalf option currently in the Ulster system (depending on Michael Lowry’s future, and I’m counting Angus Curtis as a 12/15 first). That’s not a bad spot for a young player to be in – with the only negative being the young age profile of his competition.\n\nCENTRES:\n\nStewart Moore (Malone / Ulster Academy Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nEntering the 2018/19 season, Moore was garnering a lot of praise and hype in Ulster’s preseason. Then the centre was sidelined after a few too many head knocks and missed the Six Nations. The stand-down looked to have helped the youngster and he was able to thrive in the World Championship, with the highlight his wonder try for 14-man Ireland that gave them the lead against Australia. Moore’s tournament was cut short through a shoulder injury. Performance-wise, Moore’s year was positive – but the injuries will be concerning.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nMoore is very highly thought of in Ulster. Already in the academy, despite the presence of Stuart McCloskey, Angus Curtis, Luke Marshall, and James Hume – Moore could still feature for Ulster this season. McFarland will likely bring him through slowly, especially with Moore’s injury profile – because probably why he didn’t feature for Ulster last season.\n\nDavid Hawkshaw (Clontarf / Leinster Academy Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nHe played only three games before a serious knee injury, but it’s fair to say that Hawkshaw lived up to the hype. Known for his talent since he starred in the Leinster Senior Cup as a 4th year, Hawkshaw’s versatility allowed him to slot between Harry Byrne at 10 and Liam Turner at 13 and the Irish attack flourished.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nHawkshaw was brought into the Leinster academy during the year last season, and won’t have don’t his future prospects any harm with his play. First things first though, he’ll have to rehab after the ACL injury and likely won’t be back playing until 2020. Even then, it may not be until the 2020/21 until he gets back to feeling like himself and he can start making strides.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nThe first choice centre partnership of Robbie Henshaw (26) and Garry Ringrose (24) are well established and both are young enough. The depth behind them is young, but Conor O’Brien and Rory O’Loughlin have made strides in recent years, whilst Tommy O’Brien and Gavin Mullen impressed during their Ireland U20 campaigns. Then there is Liam Turner who enters the academy this year.\n\nThat said, all of these players can play both 12 and 13, with the likes of Tommy O’Brien, Rory O’Loughlin, and Turner able to play on the wing too. Hawkshaw’s versatility should see him make the leap to the PRO14, and it’s up to him to continue his growth and recovery so that he can continue to fulfil his potential.\n\nLiam Turner (DUFC)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nThat was some year for Turner. The only player to play every minute of every game in both the Six Nations and the World Championships, Turner was a particularly bright spot. The squad wasn’t lacking in centre talent between Sean French, Stewart Moore, David Hawkshaw, and Oli Morris – so it’s telling that Turner was trusted to play so often – even when others were rested. Turner’s ability both in attack and defense was fantastic, showing both the attacking flair that he’s developing playing in the back three and showing experience of defending in the line at 13. Turner is a natural ball player and one that I’ll be keeping an eye out for in the future.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nThere was a lot of nuance to Turner’s game suggesting that he could be more ready to make the step up to the senior ranks than others. Turner may have to start his career getting games out wide, but that won’t be a problem for him, and he may even be an option at 15.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nThe main/only roadblock to Turner’s success will be the number of bodies in front of him. As listed in David Hawkshaw’s roadblocks, there are a lot of young backs in the Leinster system at the moment with more to come all the time. Turner may have to be patient as the likes of Conor O’Brien, Tommy O’Brien, and Jimmy O’Brien get their deserved time – but I’m backing Turner to be ready whenever his time comes.\n\nHe played out on the wing for Leinster in the Celtic Cup but didn’t seem to influence games the way he does from 13.\n\nDavid Ryan (UCD)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nA constant for Leinster and Ireland U19s the year before, David Ryan’s name was conspicuous in its absence from the Ireland squad in both the Six Nations and the initial World Championship announcements. The younger brother of James was called up as an injury replacement for Stewart Moore and performed admirably in his ‘slightly more than one’ appearance against England and Italy.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nIt’s hard to know. Ryan wasn’t included in the most recent Leinster academy intake. It’s possible that another province takes a look at him, but Ryan may have to bide his time and wait for now.\n\nOli Morris (Saracens)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nIt started well, being named in the extended squad for the Six Nations. But that’s as much as we got to see of Morris. He was passed over in the World Championships when injuries arose for the likes of Adam La Grue and David Ryan.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nMorris left Saracens to join the Worcester Warriors academy for next season. So from an Irish POV, any future that Morris may have in the green jersey will have to wait unless he makes an appearance on these shores. Perhaps one to keep a distant eye on over the coming years.\n\nWINGERS:\n\nConor Philips (Young Munster / Munster A (Cara Cup ))\n\nHow the year went:\n\nPhilips started the year as the first team winger for the opening two games of the Six Nations. Then players like Angus Kernohan returned from injury to take his spot, whilst Sean French impressed enough to be considered the next in line on the wing too. An injury ruled Philips out of the World Cup, leaving Philips with just his two industrious games to open the year.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nPhilips wasn’t included in the Munster academy this season. The injuries he sustained look like they’ve counted against him, so Phillips will have to impress in the AIL with a view to joining later if rugby is a career he wants to pursue. He’s a high work-rate guy who does have some flair to him. He’s got a good mix of a Joe Schmidt style winger and one that fans will enjoy watching too.\n\nJonathan Wren (Cork Con / Munster Academy Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nThere was an expectation coming into the year that Wren could be the leading candidate to play full-back for Ireland. Instead, between Flannery’s brilliance and a plethora of other options, Wren was shifted out to the wing. The Cork Con product impressed throughout the year, and nailed down a first choice winger spot. He has the versatility for the back three which will be good going forward.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nWren enters his second year of the Munster academy, and presumably will focus more on wing than full-back in the future. He’s got the talent, but like most young backs will need to focus on S&C to best assimilate to the senior ranks.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nAndrew Conway, Keith Earls, Darren Sweetnam, Calvin Nash, Alex Wootton, Mike Haley, Liam Coombes, and Sean French. There’s competition aplenty in the Munster back three. That’s not even counting Flannery.\n\nSean French (Cork Con / Munster Academy Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nHe entered the year with a big reputation and excitement and definitely displayed his talent to show why that preceeded him. But French couldn’t force his way into the Ireland starting team in the centres and was used more on the wing. That positional switch seemed to mitigate some of his weaknesses whilst allowing his attacking flair to flourish. His World Cup campaign was cut short through injury.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nPlayers with French’s natural ability and flair don’t come along all that often, but there is a lot of things to iron up in French’s game. The perfect candidate for a year or two in the academy, and possibly a year with the Ireland Sevens team could be the making of him, but he’s one to watch from 2021 on.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nSee: Wren, Jonathan.\n\nAngus Kernohan (Ulster)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nOne of the few players with previous U20 experience, injuries slowed his start to the year but thereafter Kernohan was a mainstay in the team. It was his impact that changed the game in Ireland’s favour to win the grandslam in the Six Nations\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nHe’s already featured for Ulster senior during last year’s barren winger spell. However, unlike Baloucoune, Kernohan hasn’t kept his spot in the senior team since then.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nUlster’s back three stocks got replenished since Kernohan’s run of games, and he seems to be the biggest loser from that. Matt Faddes was brought in, whilst Rob Lyttle and Craig Gilroy are finally healthy. Robert Baloucoune shone in his time and is also ahead of Kernohan. Behind him the likes of Jack Owens and one Aaron Sexton lurk.\n\nAaron O’Sullivan (UCD / Leinster Academy Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nCalled in from Wasps to join the Leinster academy, O’Sullivan didn’t feature for Ireland until the World Championships – starting once against England in the playoff before being taken off in the 41st minute as Ireland started a comeback. He was an unused substitute in two other games.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nMore game-time for O’Sullivan is very necessary. Leinster are producing outside backs out their ears, and O’Sullivan isn’t getting much time. Unlike most, he’s already in the academy but needs to start making his mark soon.\n\nJames McCarthy (Dragons)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nEnding the U20 campaign last year, James McCarthy was one of Ireland’s better players, and at U19, it looked like he would be a key cog of this group. Save for a single bench appearance against France in the Six Nations where he didn’t get on, McCarthy didn’t feature for Ireland at all, and was then released from his Munster academy contract to move to the Dragons.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nIt’s hard to see a future for McCarthy in Ireland, but it’s not impossible. He showed that he has talent in 2018 so never say never – but for now his future is outside Ireland.\n\nFULLBACK:\n\nJake Flannery (Shannon / Munster Academy Year 1)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nIt was quite a year. Flannery came into the year as a possible backup option to Harry Byrne at 10, but then he cemented himself as a fantastic prospect at 15 – showcasing some control and inventiveness out wide that released the outside backs over and over again. Flannery’s play in the Six Nations lead to him becoming an Alex Shaw favourite:\n\nThen Harry Byrne missed the World Cup, and Noel McNamara opted for the combination of Shannon halfbacks in Craig Casey and Jake Flannery. Flannery proved he’s a good 10, and Ireland were well directed with him at the helm. But they really kicked into gear when Flannery shifted to 15 and Ben Healy came on.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nAs mentioned, I think Flannery’s long term best position will be at 15 being able to create space for those out wide and take it to the line himself. His versatility to shift into first receiver in phaseplay, or even play 10 with in games with a lot of rotation or as an emergency is something that should be kept too.\n\nAt 15, Flannery should be ready to play PRO14 sooner rather than later but if he stays at 10, it may take a little longer. He does have to get into the Munster academy first, but that should be a formality.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nMunster traditionally haven’t been too quick in bringing through talented backs. Stephen Fitzgerald has been shifted out, and Calvin Nash is still straining at the leash to get some gametime. With Mike Haley with Ireland, there’s a possibility that the depth chart at 15 could allow Flannery to get some time straight away – but it’s more likely that any of Sweetnam, Conway, Carbery, or Hanrahan would be more trusted.\n\nRob Russell (DUFC / Leinster A (Celtic Cup)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nMinimal gametime over the Six Nations for Russell, he was able to showcase his talents in the World Championships where I thought he had a wonderful tournament. He showcased some fantastic running ability with ball in hand, and often looked Ireland’s most dangerous back. Capable at 15, but I think his future will be on the left wing.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nRussell wasn’t in Leinster’s academy intake for next season. He could be a candidate to head west to Connacht or to play Ireland 7s for a year or two before trying again with Leinster. It’s hard to know, but Russell has the talent to make it, and could even benefit from some gametime at UBL level.\n\nRussell was a mainstay for Leinster A during their victorious Celtic Cup campaign.\n\nIwan Hughes (Ballynahinch / Ulster Academy Year 2)\n\nHow the year went:\n\nHughes went from outside the frame in the Six Nations to starting fullback in the World Championships after Harry Byrne’s injury and Jake Flannery’s shift from 15 to 10. The diminutive back only managed 50 minutes before his tournament was cut short through injury, unfortunately, but it had been a bright start for the\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nHughes is entering his second year in the Ulster academy which is a good start. Ulster have been very good at bringing through young backs, and it wouldn’t be shocking to see Hughes play some PRO14 over the next 18 months.\n\nRoadblocks:\n\nUnlike a year or two ago, Ulster have replenished a lot of their backline options bringing in Matt Faddes and promoting the likes of Michael Lowry, Robert Baloucoune, James Hume, and finding a way to keep Rob Lyttle off the injury table. That compliments their already impressive options in Jacob Stockdale, Will Addison, and others. All of a sudden Ulster have depth, so it’s a little harder for Hughes to breakthrough. He still may find a way.\n\nWe’re getting down to the nitty-gritty of this year’s World Rugby U20 Championships. Six teams are already out of the running for the semi-finals, with only one team booking their place.\n\nIn Pool A, A much-changed French side were too much for the Welsh, running in four tries in a 32-13 scoreline that underlined the defending champions’ title credentials. At the same time, Argentina and Fiji played out a very entertaining and open game. The Fijians played their part but repeated mistakes when within sight of the try line cost them dear, whilst Los Pumitas recovered from their disappointing opening defeat to Wales to win 41-14.\n\nIn Pool B, the story was another red card – this one against Irish lock Ryan Baird early in their clash with Australia. The Oceania champions raced out to a 10-0 lead before the understrength Irish pegged them back to lead 17-10 thanks to some gusty displays and an outstanding try from Stewart Moore. However, the man advantage and the strength in their bench told as Australia ran in five tries in the final 15 minutes to win the game, denying Ireland anything from the game. Australia would be crowned winners of Pool B thanks to a gutsy Italian display that denied England a bonus point win. The Italians were the better team throughout against an error-prone England side who had to rely on their individual skills to get a win. The English pegged the Italians back from 16-7 and 23-14 to sneak the win 24-23.\n\nIn Pool C, New Zealand and South Africa both ended up with bonus point victories to set up a mouth-watering clash to decide who wins the pool, with the loser needing to secure something from the game to join them in the final four and deny Ireland and Argentina or France. That said, New Zealand were unimpressive in their comprehensive victory – a problem with the stadium feed missing their first four tries, but when it returned they appeared to be asleep as Scotland roared back to within a score from 26-0 down to 26-19. That awoke the sleeping beast who brought on some subs who scored some tries to give some breathing room – but Scotland kept coming and a 52-33 scoreline doesn’t reflect how well Scotland played for the 50 minutes that was broadcast.\n\nIt was a similarly impressive effort from Georgia, but South Africa showed a bit more of their ability. The Junior boks added some gloss to the scoreline late on, with four tries in the final 22 minutes. Georgia were leading after 30 minutes though through Otar Lashki’s first try and were pressing for a bigger lead when Vaughn Isaacs was sinbinned. The Boks proved too strong though and will have to fancy their chances against the New Zealand U20s.\n\nOn to picking a best XV from today’s matches. This was one of the more difficult tasks I’ve ever had to do in the three years I’ve been doing this. That’s partly because technology failed in showing what had to be New Zealand’s best thirty minutes of the game. It’s partly because two games were so engrossed my attention was diverted away from other impressive performers. It’s also partly because the most impressive showing of the day all seemed to come in the same positions. Do I reward players who made game-winning interventions, or players who sparked their teams into unlucky competitive games? Do I manipulate the numbers to include both players, or double punish mistakes compared to rewarding positive involvements? Do I pick the players who showed how good they are or can be, or do I reward someone new for an outstanding showing when I know the alternative will get back in contention again?\n\nIt’s tough, so for full clarity, I will use some logic in one decision one way, and the opposite logic for another decision the other way. Here goes nothing.\n\n15. Isaac Lucas (Australia) / Ange Capuozzo (Italy)\n\nI couldn’t make a decision, so I’ve gone with equal winners.\n\nIsaac Lucas, the incumbent 15 in the team of the day, was one of the differences between Ireland and Australia. It was his play, firing the ball wide and backing up in support that created the two tries that levelled the scores and then put Australia into the lead before Nick Frost sealed the deal. Lucas is the player in the Australian backline that has X factor, and I’d be stunned if he wasn’t among the nominees for the player of the tournament.\n\nIn contrast, Capuozzo’s efforts were one of the main reasons why Italy ran English so close. His attacking lines were fantastic. His counter-attacking sparked life into the Italians and got them territory into the English 22 time and again. His play deserved a try, and that’s what he got in the end. This was the first time I’d seen Capuozzo play this well, and I hope it’s not the last. One to watch.\n\nJust because this spot was a tie doesn’t mean that the efforts of Tchitchinadze (again), Ignacio Mendy (also again), and Ollie Smith shouldn’t be recognised. They perhaps didn’t have as definitive influences on their games as Lucas and Capuozzo, but each showcased their attacking talents in various different ways, but either had minor mistakes, defensive mishaps, or slightly less involvement outside of their tries than the ultimate winners. Three very good players to watch.\n\nSpecial Mention: Teimuraz Tchitchinadze (Georgia), Ignacio Mendy (Argentina), Ollie Smith (Scotland)\n\n14. Lalomilo Lalomilo (New Zealand)\n\nSpeed. Power. Footwork. Effort. Intelligence.\n\nThat’s what Lalomilo Lalomilo provided in spades. He scored two tries, one a brilliant defensive read, intercept and speed away from the chasing pack, the other a combination of power, footwork, and more speed.\n\nIn between there was a tireless display of chasing kicks, forcing mistakes. Lalomilo Lalomilo plays like he’s consumed the world’s supply of coffee in one setting – bouncing around everywhere into rucks, tackles, and goes looking for work. He’s probably not in New Zealand’s first XV, but maybe he should be.\n\nSpecial Mention: Vincent Pinto (France)\n\n13. Federico Mori (Italy)\n\nReplacing the U19 wonderkid Matteo Moscardi in the lineup, Federico Mori didn’t disappoint putting in a phenomenal performance. Mori was everywhere in this game. Big tackles, breakdown turnovers, tackle busts. A huge performance from the centre.\n\nMentions for Argentina’s captain Juan Pablo Castro who created some wonderful opportunities for Los Pumitas, and Scotland’s Rory McMichael whose magnificent solo try against New Zealand changed the flow of that game.\n\nSpecial Mention: Juan Pablo Castro (Argentina), Rory McMichael (Scotland)\n\n12. Giulio Bertaccini (Italy)\n\nIt was a special performance from Italy, characterised by their back-row. Strangely in this game, Italy deployed five back-row players to counteract the English.\n\nNot really, but that’s how it felt like with Mori and Bertaccini dominating the game. Bertaccini alone was at the centre of three or four turnovers that were vital to giving the Italians belief in this game. One of the best individual defensive performances, Bertaccini was the standout of all of the Italians.\n\nRobbie McCallum provided similar heroics, albeit to a lesser extent for Scotland, whilst the best Welsh play came through Thomas-Wheeler. Last week’s selection Lolesio was a thorn in the Irish side both cutting off attacks at source and sparking the Australian’s with go forward ball.\n\nSpecial Mention: Noah Lolesio (Australia), Tiaan Thomas-Wheeler (Wales), Robbie McCallum (Scotland)\n\n11. Otar Lashki (Georgia)\n\nWingers score tries, and Lashki got two for Georgia. Georgia did well done with their width, and perhaps could have scored more if the rest of their players had the finishing ability that Lashki has.\n\nSpecial Mention: Arron Reed (England)\n\n10. Louis Carbonel (France)\n\nA magician. Carbonel orchestrated France to victory and it was clear why he was originally named in the French 65-man squad for the senior World Cup.\n\nSpecial Mention: Will Harrison (Australia), Tom de Glanville (England)\n\n9. Craig Casey (Ireland)\n\nCasey typifies this Irish team. They have talent, but they beat teams that are more talented than they are. They have size, but they beat teams that are bigger than them. This Irish team wants it more than the opposition, and Craig Casey wants it more than anyone.\n\nHe willed the 14-man Irish team into a 7 point lead by the time he was taken off with a few knocks. Casey needed to receive attention several times in the second half, and when the referee refused to halt the game for him, he kept getting up and limping into position and making a difference.\n\nHe got Ireland’s first try, giving them belief and things fell apart when he was gone. The definition of a game-changer.\n\nSpecial Mention: Gonzalo Garcia (Argentina), Lorenzo Citton (Italy)\n\n1. Angus Bell (Australia)\n\nA big prospect at prop for Australia. He was one of the first props this year to get the better of Thomas Clarkson, which is impressive in itself. But Bell’s all-round play was fantastic too. A key feature of the Australian carrying game, a nuisance at the breakdown too. He and Sham Vui will be a fantastic propping duo for the Waratahs for years to come.\n\nSpecial Mention: Francisco Minervino (Argentina), Matteo Drudi (Italy)\n\n2. Dylan Tierney-Martin (Ireland)\n\nAs much as Casey drove Ireland forward, Tierney-Martin was right there with him. The heartbeat of this Irish pack, Tierney-Martin’s work-rate is only matched by his ability in all facets of the game.\n\nI’m a particular fan of his jackaling ability – but it’s always important that a hooker throws well at lineout time – which he does. His carrying is very good, and his support play when Ireland were keeping it tight was very good, to the point that it negated Fraser McReight’s opportunities to poach anything.\n\nThings started going awry when he came off, just like Casey – and that is the main difference why he keeps his spot in this team over France’s Rayne Barka who was equally outstanding in the loose whilst performing the main hooker duties of throwing and scrummaging to a high standard too.\n\nSpecial Mention: Rayne Barka (France), Will Capon (England)\n\n3. Asenathi Ntlabakanye (South Africa)\n\nWhat can you say about Ntlabakanye? The Georgian scrum has destroyed all comers this year, including the South Africans back in April. But Ntlabakanye solidified the Bok pack, and they even won penalties at scrum-time against the Junior Lelos. A huge performance from a huge man.\n\nSpecial Mention: Alfie Petch (England), Francisco Coria (Argentina)\n\n4. Nick Frost (Australia)\n\nIt’s not often that a replacement gets into the team of the week, but it’s hard to deny Frost after his two try performance that won the game for the Aussies.\n\nEtonia Waqa ran him close with a try-scoring performance of his own and an all action display of power hitting and carrying for the Fijians.\n\nSpecial Mention: Etonia Waqa (Fiji), Richard Capstick (England)\n\n5. Trevor Hosea (Australia)\n\nAustralia U20s are blessed with a strong forward pack, and their depth at lock is amazing. Michael Wood is a fantastic lineout operator, Nick Frost showcased his athleticism coming off the bench. Heretofore unseen Esei Ha’angana has played Super Rugby for the Melbourne Rebels.\n\nBut I’m giving the spot to Ha’anagana’s club teammate Trevor Hosea for his punishing display. The behemoth put in some massive dominant tackles, and was throwing people out of the way when carrying. A physically dominant display.\n\nSpecial Mention: Kilian Geraci (France)\n\n6. Harry Wilson (Australia)\n\nThis was a tough choice, and I reserve the right to change it later on review.\n\nIt’s tough to deny hat-trick hero Dylan Richardson, but as I tend to over-reward good play over tries and I think Richardson will console himself with the match ball – Harry Wilson gets the spot for now.\n\nThe blindside was the pick of the Australian back-row against Ireland – no mean feat. His link-up play was fantastic, his breakdown work exemplary. A hard-hitting, line busting display of the highest quality.\n\nA mention for Italy’s Andrea Chianucci for his display as part of their efforts. One I’m hoping he repeats when he graduates to the senior ranks.\n\nSpecial Mention: Dylan Richardson (South Africa), Andrea Chianucci (Italy)\n\n7. Tommy Reffell (Wales)\n\nAnother close contest between Reffell and McReight, and this time Reffell had a bigger influence on his game than McReight on his.\n\nThree turnovers for Reffell, his breakdown work stymied the French all game before the defending champions pulled away in the second half after a 10-8 half-time score.\n\nSpecial Mention: Fraser McReight (Australia), Davide Ruggeri (Italy)\n\n8. Bautista Pedemonte (Argentina)\n\nI’ll be honest, this was nearly a three-way tie between Pedemonte, Koffi, and Hodnett. The Irishman’s carrying in wide channels was the best source of go forward ball for his team, Koffi was a similar threat to England all game with some extra breakdown nuisance.\n\nBut Pedemonte was swatting off defenders all game, striding into open space, breaking the line, offloading, and being the catalyst for most of Los Pumitas best work. A wonderful performance by all three.\n\nSpecial Mention: Antoine Koffi (Italy) / John Hodnett (Ireland)"
