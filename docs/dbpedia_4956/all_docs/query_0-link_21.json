        "text": "Originally posted by Mumhain View Post\n\nYeah, coaches who aren’t directly involved with coaching the provincial academies would be my preference. Ideally somebody from outside the country with no provincial ties but if you are getting Irish coaches then surely they shouldn’t be allowed to simultaneously coach/manage the provincial teams academies and the national team at the same time. I thought Noel McNamara was a great Ireland U20 coach, but it was funny seeing the Leinster rugby website congratulating the Leinster academy (managed by Noel McNamara) for getting players selected in the Ireland U20 squad (also managed by Noel McNamara). To be fair to McNamara, he was a lot more balanced in his selections than other coaches, but he shouldn’t have been put in that place to begin with.\n\nIreland is a small enough country, with a large percentage of the population not playing any rugby, so we can't really afford for our U19 coaches to be ignoring some of the best talents in the country because they don’t come from the right place or fit their specific game plans. For me, we should be picking a team with players that have the highest chance of making it in the pro game, and then build a game plan that suits their strengths. At the moment, it seems like we’re doing the opposite. It feels like we’re copying the Ireland senior team’s strategy by prioritising cohesion above all else. Picking a largely Leinster XV, with only the stand-outs from other provinces getting a look-in, unless they manage to sneak one of their coaches into the selection group.\n\nThere are two great Connacht U19 prop prospects, who are around 130kg. They might not be as polished as guys from big Dublin private schools but surely we’d be better off selecting these guys than props who are around 90kg. Again, nothing against the guys selected and fair play to them for making it this far, but ultimately these teams should be based around producing professional rugby players. If you’re 19 and under 90kg as a prop, you’d have to have a pretty remarkable physical transformation to put on 20kg of muscle naturally. Even if they manage it, their game will have completely changed to the point where they’re unrecognisable and they’ll still be on the smaller size.\n\n​"
