This is perhaps unsurprising with the many unknowns that festival organisers face; just think of the good old British weather! Considering the level of uncertainty faced by festival organisers, there has never been a greater need for cash reserves. It is little wonder, therefore, that Glastonbury Festival’s Company Accounts showed cash reserves of over £6 million last year. However, for those businesses not holding an outdoor event for over 200,000 people who are quite literally “saving for a rainy day”, then having too much cash on the books can be problematic as far as inheritance tax is concerned, thanks to the restrictions on inheritance tax relief that apply to “excepted assets”.

It was my first time attending and I was really interested in going to the event as a creative, where I knew most people would be in tech, medicine, finance, engineering and law industries. I wanted to see what connections I would make and how these would differ if I went to a music/creative based event. My takeaways: 1) It doesn’t really matter what background people have. Everyone’s there for a reason, whether it’s to meet new people etc. It’s more about the connections you can create 2) You never know where a connection might lead you. For example, I started chatting to someone and it turns out their friend runs a pub and is looking for new music acts. This was someone I probably wouldn’t have found except from at these type of events 3) At these events there’s usually less people from the creative industry, so use that to your advantage when networking Thanks to the team who put on the event. I definitely recommend trying if you are in the creative industry! #cardiffyoungprofessionals #networking #cardiffnetworkingevent #cardiffbusiness #creativeindustries #creativeindustry #creativeindustrynetworking #musicindustry #musicnetwork #creativenetworking #singer #singersongwriter #musician\n\nMANCHESTER UNSPUN - WEBINAR 18 JUNE 2pm - 3pm UK TIME (EVENTBRITE BOOKING LINK IN COMMENTS) Following our March webinar ‘Lessons Learnt from Rock ‘n Roll’ with Tony Michaelides we continue with a session from cultural journalist and PR and communications consultant extraordinaire Andrew Spinoza on the culture of a great city: Manchester, the original modern city (where Tony’s music industry PR and radio work began.) Why Manchester? It’s an enthralling example of how to resurrect something which is seriously failing - as the city was in the 1970s - and turn it into a successful global brand, buoyed up on a wave of bands like New Order, Joy Division, Simply Red, the Smiths, Oasis and the Stone Roses. A place which thinks ‘tables are for dancing on’ Culture is not just about countries but has many layers – one of which is cities (ask Italians about the importance of this!) Even if you’ve never been to Manchester, its resurrection teaches universally applicable lessons about change, renewal, and branding rooted in an intensely distinctive local phenomenon. Andy’s 2023 book ‘Manchester Unspun: how a city got high on music’ was described by the Guardian as ‘coolly analytical, exceptionally well-informed, and hugely entertaining’ Make a diary note for 18 June 2pm - 3 pm UK time. #change #renewal #branding"
