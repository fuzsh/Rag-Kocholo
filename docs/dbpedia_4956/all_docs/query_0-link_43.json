        "text": "NUIG Rugby: 78\n\nCarrick on Shannon RFC: 17\n\nOn Sunday last, College faced Carrick on Shannon in the first round of this year’s league. The heavy night time and morning rain looked like they would contrive to make the playing conditions less than ideal, but apart from a strong wind, the perfect sunny weather meant that the game kicked off in near ideal conditions for rugby. The Dangan surface was also in immaculate condition, and gleamed like a brand new billiard table in the September sun. Following a heel against the head in the first scrum of the game, from pack leader Luke Murphy, the ball made its way to the backs and a set piece move put James Kennedy in space before he released winger Mattie Kavanagh who carried to within metres of the Carrick line. Good support play from man-of-the-match, flanker Adam Brady meant that he was in position to receive the ball and score the first of his four tries of the afternoon. Further tries followed from captain, No. 8 Darragh O’Loughlin and flyhalf Tony Hall. College’s fourth try, and Brady’s second came from good line pressure, which enabled the flanker to intercept and sprint forty metres to get the bonus point touchdown out wide. To their credit, and even though College were now sitting on a comfortable lead, Carrick rallied and scored a good team try after a period of sustained pressure. The teams turned around at half-time with the score at 32-5 to NUIG. The second half mirrored the first with College starting brightly to add another brace to their tally. Flanker Max Sale and O’Loughlin both crossed for tries shortly after the restart. Carrick then struck back with two good tries of their own. However, the margin was too big to make up, and with the game entering its final quarter, College added further tries through Mattie Kavanagh, Ronan Mulloy, Brady, Ross Stapleton and Brian Carey; with the pick of the second-half tries a 60 metre break from centre, medical student Mel Corbett. Overall, a good start to the new league season, and a satisfying result for the coaches, Pete Small, Justin Conboy and Tom O’Regan. College’s next game is at home to Gort in a fortnight, and the NUIG Rugby Ladies team will face Carrick away next weekend in their first competitive fixture of the year."
