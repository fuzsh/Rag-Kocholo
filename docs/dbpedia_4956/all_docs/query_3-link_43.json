        "text": "Hello Everyone,\n\nIt is with great pleasure that I welcome all players, supporters, sponsors and visiting teams to Lakelands Park for another fantastic season of Leinster, AIL 1A and Terenure rugby as a whole. I am extremely proud to say that we enter this season as the current Energia All-Ireland League champions where we now look\n\nforward to retaining the coveted title, a feat that has not been achieved since Shannon RFC many years ago.\n\nFirstly, it is the greatest honour to, once again, be named Club Captain of Terenure College RFC for the 2023 /24 season, and I am extremely confident that our squad, coaches and back-room team will do everything possible to do the Club proud throughout the season, as we look to build on our unprecedented quadruple last season (AIL, Leinster League, Leinster Senior Cup and Bateman Cup).\n\nI also would like to congratulate Colm De Buitleir and Jordon Coghlan who have both been appointed Vice Captains for the coming season. Two fantastic players, great friends, and inspiring leaders!\n\nI have had an interesting rugby journey since I walked in those Terenure College gates many years ago. From playing mini rugby and (multiple positions) with Terenure College RFC and Leinster Rugby, onto Manawatu in New Zealand and then settling in Japan with NTT Docomo / Panasonic Wild Knights, I have loved every minute of my career to date. I have, however, always ended up back at Lakelands! Nothing feels better than putting on a purple, black, and white jersey.\n\nIt is a very special community club which was epitomized by the amazing season we had last year, topped off by winning the All-Ireland League Trophy for the first time in the club’s history. There was no better feeling walking back into Lakelands with the trophy and to be greeted by thousands of supporters, a memory I will\n\nnever forget. The successful season we had last season is a testament to everyone associated with Terenure College RFC and the surrounding community. I cannot wait for all of us to collectively get stuck in, to the new season, on and off the pitch as we look to retain the trophies we now currently hold. As a squad, we are aware of how hard that will be and do not take anything for granted. Fresh off the plane from a brilliant tour in Argentina, we enter the season with renewed energy as we look to continue making history with this amazing club. Hopefully, we can do you all proud and I am in no doubt that we will be there or thereabouts come May 2023.\n\nA special mention to our coaches and wider management team, Sean Skehan, Conor Gildea, Paul Barr, Mark Hamilton, Paul Murphy, Garrett Lynch, Mark Hiney, Michael Mooney, Ian Morgan, Robbie Carroll, Paul Haycock, Michael Henry-Hayes, Brian Fitzgerald, Richie McDonald, Billy Twomey Jnr and the incoming Andy Skehan, Aaron O’Connor, Arthur Fitzpatrick, David Fox and Mark O’Neill, for the incredible work they put in, to help mould this pool of players into a team worthy of being Division 1A contenders. A special mention must also go to the members of the backroom team leaving us this season, Simon Malone, Emmet McMahon, Jack O’Brien, David Durkin and Brian Elliot, thank you for everything.\n\nAnother great Terenure stalwart, so worthy of mention is the selfless Dr Bill Twomey, who has given so much of his time and support to the teams over the years and often stitching my face in record breaking times, Many, many, thanks Bill.\n\nI would also like to extend our deep appreciation to all our sponsors. In particular, our main sponsors MJ Flood and Sherry Fitzgerald for being with us again this season. I’m really looking forward to continuing the partnership together and I know together we can continue to reach great heights. You have all played a significant role in the recent growth and achievements within our club and we are proud to have you as partners of Terenure College Rugby Football Club.\n\nOn a personal level I would also like to thank our outgoing President, Tommy Darcy for his amazing contribution to the club and squad last season. I would also like to offer my full support to incoming President and friend, Paul Crossan. I’m really excited to see where we can get to this season together and no better man to help us get there as President.\n\nRetaining the Energia All-Ireland League this season is our sole focus and to achieve it with players from all four provinces would be truly amazing. The current squad is littered with outstanding talent which was supplemented by some exciting new additions to the squad during the summer. I wish all players, current and new, an injury free, happy and successful season.\n\nFinally, thank you to the supporters. You have followed us around the country in hail, rain or snow and helped us get over the line, many a time, in games. Your support cannot be underestimated and is greatly appreciated by all the squad members. I can’t promise that we will win every game this season but I can promise we will try – and hopefully provide some entertaining rugby along the way. I hope we can make each and every one of you proud this coming season. As another season begins, I’ve never been hungrier to go again and make this the best one yet.\n\nYours in Rugby,\n\nHarrison Brewer\n\nTerenure College RFC Club Captain 2023 / 2024"
