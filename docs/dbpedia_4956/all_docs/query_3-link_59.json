        "text": "Unfortunately, due to the postponement of several AIL fixtures last weekend because of the bad weather, and the subsequent rescheduling of the Lansdowne/Shannon for Sat.17th.Dec at 2:30pm; our 150th celebration fixture against the Irish Universities has been postponed and we’ll be looking for a suitable date to play this match.\n\nThe pre-match lunch for the Shannon game will go ahead as normal and the match will be played on the Main pitch. This game is kindly sponsored by Rhino Rugby.\n\nThe Mini rugby festivities will also continue as arranged.\n\nI look forward to seeing as many of you as possible on the day for a really great Christmas celebration.\n\nMick\n\nMichael Dawson\n\nPresident 2022-23\n\nLansdowne FC\n\n*We now have some limited places at the lunch and if you would like to attend, please contact stephanieojo@lansdownerugby.com. Spaces will be allocated on a first come, first served basis. If you have already booked a place, this booking will still stand unless we hear from you."
