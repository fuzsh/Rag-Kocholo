        "text": "PLAYER DEVELOPMENT IN THE GREATER BELFAST AREA\n\nHad the opportunity to catch up with Ballina Director of rugby Darragh Quinn at Upritchard Park on Saturday prior to the match against Bangor in the All Ireland League. My interest was in how this club had made the progress to where they are at present in such a short space of time. It is not so long since Donaghadee 1st XV travelled to Heffernan Park and defeated Ballina 32 - 14 in the All Ireland Junior Cup on the 27th October 2012. Ballina now top Div 2C of the All Ireland League after being promoted to the All Ireland League through the Round Robin Playoffs having previously competed in the All Ireland League. Donaghadee are now top of Div 3 of the Kukri Ulster Rugby championship after suffering successive relegations from Div 1. What was the secret of the Ballina success. Darragh told me they had used 39 players so far this season. 36 of these players had come through their Mini and Youth structure. I asked him about the progress of Connemara and Creggs both former All Ireland League clubs who are now competing for the Connacht Junior 1A league title this season. Their success like Ballina has been built on developing their own players coming through their Mini and Youth structures.\n\nIt left me asking the question why clubs in the Greater Belfast area are not doing more to develop their own players. We have all witnessed how the rural clubs in Ulster are leaving the Belfast clubs behind. From Ballynahinch, Banbridge, City of Armagh, Clogher Valley, Enniskillen, Omagh, Dungannon, City of Derry, Limavady, Rainey OB, Ballymoney, Randalstown, Ballymena, Ballyclare and Carrickfergus you can see the progress these clubs have made. This work is ongoing through Ulster Rugby and their Development Officers to bring clubs and Schools together in the rural communities to build and strengthen their player base. I know Malone RFC have been at the forefront of Youth Rugby in the Belfast area for many years. The sad thing is these players are not progressing through to playing Adult rugby at the club. Last week the club were unable to field their 3rd and 4th XV teams to compete in Cup competitions. The question I would have to ask is where have all the players who have come through their Youth structure gone to over the last 5/10 years.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak to Michael Howard from Instonians RFC on the progress they are making with establishing Youth Rugby teams in the club. It is an ongoing process with their second row Sean Shuttleworth evidence of a player who has come through the clubs Youth structure to play for the 1st XV. I also noted they are able to organise Youth fixtures during the week with their under 14s and 16s playing Carrickfergus on Thursday night. From a personal point of view I am delighted to see clubs playing rugby at this level outside the traditional window of Saturday morning. Shawsbridge neighbours Cooke RFC have been working hard under Noel Brown to establish Youth Rugby at the club. From beginnings at under 14 level the club have progressed to under 18 level.\n\nWhat Michael Howard wanted to see happening was the nine clubs in the Belfast area coming together to put in place a plan to increase the number of players at Mini and Youth level playing rugby. Is their merit in what Michael is saying. Traditionally the clubs in Belfast have relied on the Grammar Schools to provide their players with their rivalry I feel being an obstacle to looking at the bigger picture in creating opportunities for more boys and girls to play rugby. Too many schools in the Belfast area don't play rugby. Too many clubs don't have any relationship with these schools. The clubs should be asking themselves why this is happening.\n\nUlster Rugby want to see a 'Holistic' approach being taken by the clubs in Belfast to reversing the player drain. Is it not time the clubs set aside their rivalries to come together and put in place arrangements to benefit all our rugby clubs and sustain our playing base.\n\nI mentioned Donaghadee RFC. Under Community Development Officer Guy McManus they now have teams at under 14 and 16 level representing the club in the Youth leagues. Their neighbours Bangor RFC are fielding an under 14 side as they build for the future with David Coey and Stephen Montgomery playing a key role at the club and in Bangor Academy. These are examples of what can be achieved.\n\nLooking at Connacht it is the new emerging clubs that are replacing the more established clubs. Look how Galwegians and Galway Corinthians have struggled in recent seasons. In Belfast Instonians, CIYMS and Academy not to forget North and Collegians before they merged into Belfast Harlequins were all senior clubs. If the clubs in Connacht can get it right why can the clubs in Greater Belfast area not take those first courageous steps to work together for the long term benefit of the Domestic game in Belfast. Ulster Rugby can take the lead - but we need all the clubs to work with them.\n\nRugby is a sport for all abilities. Club structures should reflect that inclusiveness. The Post of Director of Rugby has become a key post in clubs to coordinate all playing activities within their clubs along with a pro active playing committees. Again I am surprised to learn that a number of clubs don't have such structures in place.\n\nSKILL DEVELOPMENT/COACHING\n\nThis is an area that I have talked about for a number of years. We are not doing enough to teach players the basic fundamental skills from an early age. This has to start with Mini Rugby and upskilling the coaches to develop the young players and give them the skills to play rugby. This includes passing, tackling and kicking. Too often I have been watching games of rugby at all age groups and have been horrified to see young players not being taught the basics of rugby union. We keep talking about transferable skills from soccer and GAA. Why are we not teaching these young players the skills they learn from soccer and GAA. Why has someone else to do this job. Kicking is such an integral part of rugby union. Sadly players are not being taught how to kick and catch a rugby ball. I watched a young player in a recent match struggling with his kicking game and the impact it had on his team. The question I was asking was no one spending time with this player to improve his kicking game, Does it pose the question that we don't have specialised coaches with the skills to teach players individual skills such as kicking for example. Who are the specialised coaches available to teach players how to scrummage and jump in lineouts. Coaching time with players has to be focused and structured to improve that individual player.\n\nI agree that the upskilling of coaches has to be ongoing with regular workshops to ensure they can improve the individual player and his team.\n\nALL IRELAND LEAGUE\n\nFor the second weekend running we had 13 results reversed from the fixtures in Round 8. The teams now have a three week break before the Round 12 fixtures recommence on Saturday the 16th February. They will then play a block of four matches before they break again for two weeks before the final three Rounds of fixtures are completed on the 13th April.\n\nDIV 1B\n\nTwo points separate Malone and Banbridge at the top of the league after Round 11. Malone remain top after defeating Old Wesley 21 - 17 at Donnybrook with Banbridge holding on to make it back to back wins after recording a 18 - 16 win over St Mary's College at Rifle Park. Both these teams will meet at Gibson Park in Round 12 on the 16th February. Ballynahinch bounced back from their defeat at Malone to defeat Ulster neighbours Ballymena 19 - 14 at Ballymacarn Park. The win moves them up into 4th place three points behind leaders Malone. Ballymena find themselves in 10th place after losing their Round 10 and 11 games. City of Armagh are in 7th place after drawing 23 - 23 away to Naas. With five points separating the top six sides and only 12 points separating all ten teams in this league every point is vital as teams battle it out for the league title and a top four finish. The contest at the bottom has six points separating the bottom four teams with Ulster side Ballymena in need of league points to avoid finishing in 9th and 10th place.\n\nDIV 2A\n\nQueens University could not make it back to back wins after they went down to Cashel 35 - 15 in Round 11. They find themselves in 6th place as they trail leaders Highfield by 26 points. UL Bohemians are in 4th place five points ahead of the students in the battle for the playoffs.\n\nDIV 2B\n\nInjuries had depleted Rainey OB Head coach John Andrews of several of his experienced players with his young side overcoming Sunday's Well 21 - 12 at Hatrick Park to keep their 3rd place. Dungannon were unable to record back to back wins losing 26 - 8 to second place Greystones on the road. They now find themselves level on points with 10th place Sunday's Well. Belfast Harlequins made it three wins away from home when they won a crucial relegation game at Skerries 11 - 7 to move up to 8th place.\n\nDIV 2C\n\nOmagh had their title ambitions seriously dented when they lost 23 - 14 away to 10th place Seapoint. The Tyrone team remain in 4th place 14 points adrift of leaders Ballina with the playoffs once again their target this season. Bangor find themselves in 6th place nine points of the playoffs and only eight points ahead of 9th place Thomond after losing 46 - 28 at home to league leaders Ballina at Upritchard Park. Head coach Michael Ferguson and his players find themselves potentially involved on the fringes of being caught up for the third season in a row in a battle to avoid finishing in 9th and 10th place. The outstanding performance of the day has to go to City of Derry who surprised second place Midleton at the Craig Thompson stadium to win 19 - 18 with captain Stephen Corr scoring two of their three tries.\n\nKUKRI ULSTER RUGBY CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nDIV 1\n\nAfter Round 13 seven points separate the top three sides Ballyclare and Instonians with Dromore having a game in hand. It is a case of these three teams seeking a maximum five points from every league game in an attempt to gain an advantage in this title race. It is looking as if the meetings between Ballyclare, Instonians and Dromore at the Cloughan in March will go some way to deciding the league winners. Grosvenor in 4th place find themselves only seven points ahead of 5th place Cooke after losing their last two league games. Both teams meet at Gibson Park on Thursday night in a rearranged league game with points vital to both teams. 6th and 7th place Portadown and Carrickfergus met at the Tom Simms Memorial Grounds in a game full of drama. Portadown had built up a commanding 26 - 10 lead at halftime only to conceded 20 unanswered points in the second half to lose 30 - 26. For Carrick Head coach Warren McLean it made it two wins from three since he took over. New Portadown Head coach Stuart Lamb will be aware his side have now lost their last three league games by narrow margins having scored 12 tries and conceded 14. There was plenty of drama at the bottom end of the table. Enniskillen picked up four valuable league points in their 21 - 0 win at Coleraine with Enniskillen prop Gavin Warrington making it six tries scored in twelve league appearances this season. CIYMS almost snatched victory over Instonians at Belmont as a late penalty attempt drifted wide in losing 29 - 27 to Belfast neighbours Instonians. CIYMS find themselves one point ahead of 10th place Coleraine and four points behind 8th place Enniskillen. Matches coming up between Enniskillen, CIYMS and Coleraine will go a long way in deciding the teams who will finish in the bottom two places. The 10th place team is automatically relegated with the 9th place team going into the playoff match with the team finishing second in Division 2.\n\nDIV 2\n\nClogher Valley made a big statement at the weekend in defeating Academy 17 - 12 at the Cran in the race for the league title. It remains a contest between Limavady, Clogher Valley, Academy and Randalstown for the league with ten points between the four sides. Both Limavady and Academy have a game in hand on Clogher Valley with Randalstown having two games in hand on Clogher Valley. Again the fixtures involving these teams in the remaining weeks will go a long way in deciding who wins this league. Ballymoney, Ards and Lurgan continue their battle to finish in 5th place. Larne, Lisburn and UUC all lost their games on Saturday. It is looking as if it will be between Lisburn and UUC to avoid finishing in 10th place with the 9th place team going into a playoff match with the second place team in Div 3.\n\nDIV 3\n\nLeaders Donaghadee retain their 12 point advantage with six matches remaining after picking up another bonus win at Civil Service. Monaghan remain favourites to finish in second place.\n\nRIVER ROCK TOWNS CUP 2ND ROUND\n\nThis weekend we have 16 teams competing in eight second round fixtures. They include six teams from Div 1 of the Kukri Ulster Rugby Championship who received a bye in the 1st Rd. They are joined by four teams from Div 2 along with sole Div 3 representatives Strabane and five Ulster AIL second xv teams. Ballyclare are the current holders and face a difficult tie away to one of the favourites Ballynahinch seconds at Ballymacarn Park who last won the Cup in 2017. Ballynahinch seconds and their coaches Mark McDowell and Davy Harris will be looking their team to make amends for losing the Millar McCall Wylie Junior Cup Final to Dromore. Can Ballyclare coaches Mike McKeever and Ricky Lutton steer their team through this match. Millar McCall Wylie Junior Cup holders Dromore play neighbours Banbridge seconds at Barban Hill. Another of the potential favourites will be City of Armagh seconds who retained the Kukri Conference Div 1 title in December. They travel to play Strabane. Another appetising tie is the meeting of the top two teams in Div 2 Limavady and Clogher Valley at the Cran in Fivemiletown. Clogher Valley have quite a record in the Towns Cup last appearing in the 2015 Final before losing out to Ballynahinch seconds and will be looking to make the quarter finals. Limavady under new Head coach Graeme Eastwood have made a big impact this season as both teams pursue promotion to Div 1 this season. Last season Portadown lost out to Ballyclare 27 - 6 in the Final of the Towns Cup. Recent coaching changes at Portadown have seen Stuart Lamb and Mark 'Chunka' Neilly take charge. The team have turned around early season performances and certainly have the talent in their playing squad to return to the Kingspan stadium this season. They welcome Larne to Chambers Park on Saturday afternoon. Can influential Larne scrum half Ryan Garrett and his players cause an upset. The talent is certainly within their playing squad. At Stevenson Park Enniskillen are the visitors for Dungannon seconds. Enniskillen contested the 2016 and 17 Finals losing out to Bangor 31 - 25 and Ballynahinch seconds 17 - 13 in two very dramatic games. Current Ulster winger Robert Balacoune announced his arrival as a future Ulster player in the final against Ballynahinch in 2017 with his impressive running. Can Gary Longwell and his Randalstown team cause an upset at the Tom Simms Memorial Playing Fields in his last season before stepping down as Head coach at the club. Their opponents Carrickfergus have made coaching changes with Warren McClean once again taking charge of the playing side. He has had an immediate impact with the team winning two from three league games. The team showed their character to come back from 26 - 10 down at home to Portadown last Saturday to win 30 - 26.\n\nEaton Park in Ballymena with host the remaining tie when Coleraine travel to play an inform Ballymena seconds on Friday night with a 7.45PM kick off. For Coleraine Head coach Benjy Van Der Byl and his players they will be looking a Cup run to build momentum going into their remaining league games. Ballymena seconds coaches Gareth Fisher and John Nicholl have assembled a competitive second xv at Eaton Park this season. They will be aware that if they can overcome Coleraine they will be a team who can contend for the Towns Cup this season.\n\nWith no All Ireland league matches this weekend the AIL Ulster second xv teams will be able to field strong competitive teams. The Quarter Finals of the Towns Cup will be played on the 23rd February when Round 13 of the AIL takes place.\n\nWEEKEND RESULTS/TEAM SELECTIONS 26.1.19\n\nALL IRELAND LEAGUE ROUND 11\n\nDIV 1A\n\nShannon 7 Garryowen 28\n\nDublin University 29 Clontarf 21\n\nTerenure College 49 UCD 21\n\nUCC 25 Lansdowne 22\n\nYoung Munster 5 Cork Constitution 31\n\nDIV 1B\n\nBuccaneers 20 Old Belvedere 12\n\nBallynahinch 19 Ballymena 14\n\nBallynahinch team: 1.
