        "text": "THE RUGBY SPECTATOR - a feast of International rugby in 2024 Apr 9 With the European club rugby scene drawing to a close, rugby spectators in the northern hemisphere might think there will a quiet. and thus boring “off season” looming. But, as the world community of rugby strives to make the game more accessible, more widespread and competitive, fans can look forward to a lot of great matches in the upcoming summer and autumn International Series. Note that the southern and northern hemisphere teams have off-seasons during their opposite numbers’ regular season, so as a result, the northern countries travel (south) in their summer, and the southern countries go north in theirs. All of the major international teams will be in action between June and November with the addition of some 2nd level countries who are very keen to enter the top ranks of world rugby. So for the fans who can actually attend or have access to streaming services, the following countries will be in action: South Africa; New Zealand; England; Argentina; Ireland; Fiji; Australia; Scotland; France; Japan; plus Georgia; the USA; Portugal; Chile and Uruguay. The Home teams have the following schedules: South Africa - July 6 vs. IRE; July 13 vs. IRE; July 20 vs. Portugal; August 31 vs. NZAB; September 7 vs. NZAB New Zealand - July 6 vs. ENG; July 13 vs. ENG; August 10 vs. ARG; August 17 vs. ARG; September 28 vs. AUS England - (June 22 hosting WAL vs RSA in London); November 2 vs. NZAB; November 9 vs. AUS; November 16 vs. RSA; November 24 vs. JPN Argentina - July 5 vs. FRA; July 12 vs. FRA; August 30 vs. AUS; September 6 vs. AUS; September 20 vs. RSA Ireland - November 8 vs. NZAB; November 15 vs. ARG; November 23 vs. FIJI; November 30 vs. AUS Australia - July 6 vs. WAL; July 13 vs. WAL; July 20 vs. Georgia; August 10 vs. RSA; August 17 vs. RSA; September 21 vs. NZAB Scotland - November 2 vs. FIJI; November 10 vs. RSA; November 16 vs. Portugal France - November 10 vs. JPN; November 16 vs. NZAB; November 23 vs. ARG Japan - June 22 vs. ENG; July 13 vs. Georgia; July 21 vs. Italy; October 26 vs. NZAB USA - July 5 vs. Romania; July 12 vs. SCO; (July 19 hosting NZAB vs. FIJI); August 31 vs. Canada. Other Matches; Scotland play Canada in Ottawa, July 6; Chile in Santiago, July20; and Uruguay in Montevideo, July 27. The Barbarians will play FIJI in London on June 22, and WAL play the Queensland Reds in Brisbane on July 19. Most of the matches involving southern hemisphere teams will be shown on FloRugby (florugby.com subscription required) and several other northern hemisphere games too. Hopefully the USA matches will get good coverage - details to follow.\n\nI'm not sure how \"external\" this external review is from Rugby Australia's announcement. I have no fundamental issue with any of the individuals proposed but wonder if they are too close to, and influenced by, the current set-up, personnel and environment. Undoubtedly, the recent Eddie Jones debacle and RWC23 performance, the removal of Dave Rennie, the lack of accountability of the leadership team (Executive and Board) and the continuing downward trend in playing numbers, all need to be analysed and addressed independently and objectively, dare I say it, by a group unaffected or influenced by the current RA diaspora. I believe rugby in Australia needs a purpose and vision beyond the confines and approach of the last, largely unsuccessful, 20 years. There are lessons to be learned from the strategies adopted in Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and potentially Argentina and Japan, in what needs to be done. I don't think the game in Australia is in a position that this can be achieved overnight and consequently may require a generational plan (20 years) to deal with the shortcomings and errors of the past. We simply cannot afford to focus on the next 2-4 years alone as that type of short-termism could risk the game continuing to wither on the vine However the next 2-4 years cannot be ignored completely and I would like to understand what RA currently believes a successful outcome looks like for the game in Australia after 2 years (post-Lions), 4 years (post RWC27) and importantly what accountability and responsibility the current Executive and Board have for delivering those outcomes? #rugbyaustralia #boardsofdirectors #advisoryboard #reidmatheson #sports\n\nAfter New Zealand's All Blacks convincingly beat the South African's Springboks 35-20 in Auckland last month, I still said South Africa is the the favourite to win the World Cup ahead of New Zealand. My selection of the favourites was confirmed correct last weekend when South Africa thrashed the All Blacks 35 to 7. I had also made the prediction last year when Ireland was thrashed by the All Blacks in the first of test of Ireland's tour to NZ, that Ireland would win the next two tests. Which they did. To beat New Zealand, you have to mainly do two things; The first is to match them physically and the second is to match the speed and accuracy that which they play at. If you can do that, then you have a very even chance of beating the All Blacks but you still have to use the right tactics. The All Blacks went into their game against the Springboks last week with a bit of arrogance throwing the ball around and running the ball from inside their own 22m mark. A repeat of what happened in the 2019 World Cup against England in the semi finals. The Springboks are the best defensive team out there and scored from pressuring the All Blacks backline when they attempted to run it out of their 22m resulting in the Springboks scoring a great try. The Springboks have some exciting backs and their 20 year old debutant at centre, Canaan Moodie, has some impressive traits and will be a big star in the future. The Springboks operate on playing in the opposition half (kicking a hell of a lot) and using their great defence to pressure their opposition into mistakes. Pure percentage rugby. In World Cup years, they ramp this up and you can see their intent when they stack the reserves with seven forwards and one back. The Spring Boks have some amazing backs to boot but most of the tries against the All Blacks were through the forwards where the All Blacks were one man short for the second half. I'm only basing the analysis of the game from the first half where it was more even. Now that the All Blacks were humbled, they will be a different beast going into the Rugby World Cup. It will be a coin toss now between which of these two great teams will win. France of course has come a long way and deserve to be favourites as well so I will put them up there with South Africa and New Zealand. France have brought consistency into their game. What used to be a hot and cold temperament where France would beat the best in the world with ease one week and lose to a much weaker team the next seems like a distant memory. The dark horses will be Australia, Argentina and Fiji and am personally hoping Ireland will change their RWC record so I can celebrate with some Guinness. Let the games begin."
