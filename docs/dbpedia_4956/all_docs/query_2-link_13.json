Spare time can be a rare commodity and a lot of people see opportunities to improve their presentation skills and public speaking skills as something they would have to improve in their spare time. The improvements that many of our members made, at Huntingdonshire Speakers, have earned employed people pay rises and promotions and self-employed people have risen to new heights due to their business taking off. When I asked how much time you spend furthering your career on your terms that includes how you manage your work and your time on a daily basis. If you believe that the work you do is increasing your capability you are spending time furthering your career. How is that work going to get you to the next level? Will you need to influence anyone to invest more in you? The way our members improve is organic. If you seek change in yourself and you choose to pursue it then we offer the platform for you to implement that change. Having said that, I bet most of you are too busy to come to our open night. Busy working for someone else‚Äôs promotion. What have you got to lose by giving this a chance?\n\nHosting an event is like signing up for a marathon you didn't want to do. After signing up, you realize how much work you actually have to get done. You sit back and think, how the heck did I get talked into doing this?! Oh god the stress and overthinking sets in and starts to eat away at you. But as soon as it starts, you have a BLAST! You can‚Äôt get enough. And before you‚Äôre done, you start to plan out the next one. Here‚Äôs my favorite event that I‚Äôve hosted: https://lnkd.in/gcueUdht"
