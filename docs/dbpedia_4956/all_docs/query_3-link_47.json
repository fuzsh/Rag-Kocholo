        "text": "Jerry Holland RIP\n\nIt is with deep sadness that we learned of the death of our great friend and fellow clubman Jerry Holland, following an illness.\n\nFollowing an enormously successful schools’ career with CBC Jerry represented UCC, Cork Constitution and Wanderers at club level, both Munster & Leinster at interprovincial level as well earning 3 Irish caps. Jerry toured South Africa with Ireland in 1981 and played against Wales in the 1986 Five Nations, when he partnered his great friend Donal Lenihan in the second row. He was also selected to play in the following game that season against Scotland when injury ruled him out.\n\nJerry was Munster head coach from 1994 to 1997 winning the interprovincial championship twice. He managed Ireland A in the 1998/99 season before assuming the role of Munster manager in the year 2000. In 2006 Munster, captained by Anthony Foley, finally lifted the Heineken Cup with victory over Biarritz. Jerry bowed out as Munster manager the following season.\n\nFollowing his exploits with Munster Jerry returned to Con in 2010 assuming the role of Director of Rugby where he again enjoyed tremendous success until his untimely passing. Jerry also served as club President in 2016/17 the same season his son Billy was capped at the Aviva stadium against Canada.\n\nJerry loved Con and we loved him. He was the easiest of company, a great friend, a wonderful ambassador and quite simply a good, good man. He will be sorely missed.\n\nWe extend our deepest sympathies to his family and many friends. May he rest in peace.\n\nRay Clarke\n\nPresident\n\nCork Constitution F.C."
