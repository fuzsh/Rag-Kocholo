        "text": "RICHIE MURPHY HAS named a 31-man Ireland U20s squad for the upcoming Summer Series tournament, which kicks-off in Italy next week.\n\nIreland have been placed in Pool A and will play France, South Africa and England – with all games taking place in Verona – as they look to build on the positive momentum generated by their brilliant Six Nations Grand Slam success earlier this year, with Murphy’s squad also set to play one play-off fixture following the completion of the pool stages.\n\nUlster flanker Reuben Crothers once again captains the squad, who have been preparing for the tournament with a series of camps at the IRFU’s high performance centre in recent weeks.\n\nHowever Murphy has had to name a much-changed squad with a number of his Six Nations group unavailable due to injury, leaving the Ireland head coach to call up players from the Ireland U19s squad who impressed against France back in April.\n\nIn total, 15 of the group were not part of the Six Nations squad earlier this year – with Munster’s Patrick Campbell and Leinster out-half Charlie Tector among the notable absentees.\n\nThe heavy turnover means Ireland will be up against it as they take on three strong opponents in what will likely be challenging conditions – with the temperature in Verona hovering around the mid-30s this week.\n\n“It’s an interesting one, there’s been a massive turnover within that group,” Murphy said.\n\nThe guys, some of them coming back have a big responsibility to get the others up to speed. We have 10 U19s in the squad, so some of those guys have done reasonably well in the 19s programme that was there.\n\nSome of the players (to watch out for); he might not start but big George Shaw coming over from the IQ is an interesting character, 6ft 5in, 107 or 108 kilos, a big man, a little bit to learn, but quite raw and definitely a guy who could come good over the next period and also into next year.\n\n“In relation to U20s, Dylan O’Grady, who didn’t play that much in the Six Nations – he was our 24th man – has really stepped up in the last few weeks and trained well. He’s very quick, a lovely ball player, and will probably end up playing a good bit of rugby at full-back over the next few weeks.”\n\nThe new-look group will also serve to temper expectations around a team who powered to such an impressive Grand Slam win in this year’s Six Nations, a clean sweep which included wins away to both France and England.\n\n“Some of those (new) guys are learning a little bit from the guys who were in the squad,” Murphy added.\n\n“We have five from that starting team back from the Six Nations. They will learn from those players, and also from the amount of work we’ve put into them over the last couple of camps.\n\nIt’s been an eye-opener for a few guys, training intensity levels and how they’ve been held accountable over the last number of weeks. The turnover of players is a little bit much, but it is what it is. We’ll get these guys to the best level that they can be at.\n\n“These guys have been known as Grand Slam champions, but some of them haven’t played for the U20s yet.”\n\nThe series has been organised this summer as an alternative to the postponed World Rugby U20 Championships, which returns in 2023.\n\nThe Ireland squad will depart for Italy next Tuesday, and all games will be shown live on the Six Nations Rugby U20 YouTube channel.\n\nIreland U20s Squad:\n\nForwards (18)\n\nAdam McNamee (Malone RFC/Ulster)\n\nCharlie Irvine (Queen’s University Belfast RFC/Ulster)\n\nConor O’Tighearnaigh (UCD RFC/Leinster)\n\nDarragh McSweeney (Shannon RFC/Munster)\n\nDiarmuid Mangan (UCD RFC/Leinster)\n\nDominic Rhys Hey (Gloucester Hartpury Rugby/IQ Rugby)\n\nGeorge Hadden (Gorey RFC/Leinster)\n\nGeorge Shaw (Cardiff University/IQ Rugby)\n\nJames McCormick (Ballymena RFC/Ulster)\n\nJames McNabney (Ballymena RFC/Ulster)\n\nJoseph Mawhinney (Ballymena RFC/Ulster)\n\nJosh Hanlon (Ballynahinch RFC/Ulster)\n\nKieran Ryan (Shannon RFC/Munster)\n\nLorcan McLoughlin (Queen’s University Belfast/Ulster)\n\nOisin Michel (Lansdowne FC/Leinster)\n\nRonan O’Sullivan (Highfield RFC/Munster)\n\nReuben Crothers (Ballynahinch RFC/Ulster)(Captain)\n\nScott Wilson (Queen’s University Belfast/Ulster)\n\nBacks (13)\n\nAitzol King (Clontarf FC/Leinster)\n\nAndrew O’Mahony (UCC RFC/Munster)\n\nDaniel Hawkshaw (Clontarf RFC/Leinster)\n\nDavid Dooley (MU Barnhall RFC/Leinster)\n\nDylan O’Grady (UCD RFC/Leinster)\n\nEthan Coughlan (Shannon RFC/Munster)\n\nFionn Gibbons (UCD RFC/Leinster)\n\nTony Butler (Garryowen FC/Munster)\n\nGeorge Coomber (UCC RFC/Munster)\n\nMichael Moloney (UCD RFC/Leinster)\n\nReece Malone (Loughborough University/Ballynahinch RFC/Ulster)\n\nSam Prendergast (Lansdowne FC/Leinster)\n\nShay McCarthy (Young Munster RFC/Munster).\n\nU20 Six Nations Summer Series:\n\nPool A: France, Ireland, England, South Africa\n\nPool B: Scotland, Wales, Georgia, Italy\n\nIreland U20 fixtures:\n\n[All games Payanini Centre, Verona, KO 8pm local time/7pm Irish time]\n\nFrance v Ireland, 24 June, Payanini Centre\n\nIreland v South Africa, 29 June, Payanini Centre\n\nIreland v England, 7 July, Payanini Centre"
