        "text": "Eddie Price has decided to host a Shannon RFC President’s sponsored walk, which will have the benefit of enabling everyone in the club to get involved from minis to seniors.\n\nThe aim is to have a sponsored walk around the streets of Limerick on Sunday, April 15 and raise money, which will be utilised to maintain and improve the club’s facilities in Coonagh and Thomond Park. As well as Shannon RFC benefiting, a portion of the monies raised will be directed to Milford Hospice.\n\nPrice will lead the walk from Thomond Park starting at 12pm, which will be split into a 10km and 5km walk to cater for the diversity of age groups he hopes that will take part.\n\nOn completion of the walk all parties will converge in Thomond Park at around 2pm where there will be face painting for younger folk and for people of all ages, the opportunity to get a photo with some of Shannon’s internationals will be afforded.\n\nThese pictures will be printed on the spot so the memento can be signed by the famous face.\n\nSpot prizes for those decked out best in club colours will be an incentive for everyone to don the black and blue, while the day will conclude with the annual awarding of Shannon’s Club Person of the Year.\n\nPrice explains the concept behind the event, saying: “This President’s Day is all about inclusivity, where we will celebrate our club with players, parents and supporters from all ages.\n\n“In the past the President’s Night was always an enjoyable occasion, but because of the nature of the event it excluded a large portion of our club membership, namely the underage.\n\n“We are always mindful that these young people are the future of our club and in that regard the concept of a family walk became very appealing.”\n\nHe added: “We are very hopeful that the entire club will get behind the venture as it will also provide much needed funds for the up-keep of our facilities so the next generation of Shannon players can continue to prosper.”\n\nAlong with fellow Executive committee Members, senior players and Ian Dowling and Jerry Flannery, Price launched the President’s Walk in Jerry Flannery’s bar last Friday night.\n\nSponsorship cards have been distributed throughout the club and it is hoped that everyone associated with the club will get involved.\n\nFor anyone wishing to get their hands on a sponsorship card, they can contact the following people:\n\nEddie Price 0876125299, Niall Mulcahy 0866992629, Vinny Ryan 0862576095, Michael Fleming 0863452074, Gerry Ryan 0860618333, Katie McCloskey 0879396431 and Des Clancy 0876623057.\n\nRelated Links –"
