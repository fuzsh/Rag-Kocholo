His wife Ca- triona is club treasurer.\n\nThe officers are all delighted with the support the new club has received from the public.\n\n“Its fantastic to see the huge num- bers turning up for training and its great to see the youth of west Clare getting the opportunity to play rug- by,” said David Hillery.\n\nFormer Shannon RFC player Paddy Hayes who is Club Youth Officer said: “our club is enabling the young boys and girls to participate in a game that has never been as popular\n\nas now with the success of Munster and our Irish rugby team.”\n\nOther high profile Munster rugby officials present at the launch cel- ebrations were John Noonan, John King and Gerry Quaid."
