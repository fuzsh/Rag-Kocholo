        "text": "Shannon RFC unveiled a bust sculpted by Seamus Connolly in memorial of Anthony Foley at their clubhouse in Thomond Park on Friday night.\n\nThe club also made a presentation to Munchin’s College and the people of Killaloe on the night, while the Foley family were in attendance for the event.\n\nShannon Vice President and close friend of Anthony, Noel Healy says he is delighted to have the bust at the clubhouse.\n\n“For us to do this tonight, we’re bringing our son home. Anthony Foley is going to be forever in our club as long as our club exists. Anthony Foley’s bust will be here forever more.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Shannon\\_RFC/status/954463960245383173\n\nChairman John Leahy says that the plan to honour the club legend had been in place for some time, and is in awe of the likeness of the bust.\n\n“We had to do something to mark how important he was in the life of this club. I don’t want to be critical of other endeavours that were done in the city but this is a true likeness of Anthony Foley and we’re very proud of it.”\n\nYou can listen to both men speaking about what was a special night for the club below."
