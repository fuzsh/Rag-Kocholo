        "text": "*Tony Butler ©INPHO/Ben Brady\n\nFRESH from signing a two year contract with Munster rugby, Tony Butler has been handed a starting spot in the province’s team to face Zebre on Friday night.\n\nMunster welcome Zebre to Virgin Media Park on Friday at 07:35pm in the BKT URC Round 11 clash.\n\nJoey Carbery picked up a slight knock in training which meant he was unavailable for selection and this opened the door for Butler to get the nod at out-half. He will partner Craig Casey as a new half-back pairing.\n\nFellow Barefield man Ethan Coughlan is included among the substitutes, he also put pen to paper on a two-year deal with Munster this week. Butler and Ruadhan Quinn are two Academy players included in the first fifteen with Coughlan and Ben O’Connor among the substitutes.\n\n22-year-old Alex Kendellen captains the team with four changes to the side that beat Scarlets earlier this month.\n\nMike Haley makes his 99th start for Munster at full-back with Seán O’Brien and Shane Daly on either wing.\n\nAlex Nankivell and Antoine Frisch continue their centre partnership with Casey and Butler at 9 and 10.\n\nWycherley, Niall Scannell and Ryan pack down in the front row with Ahern and RG Snyman in the engine room.\n\nQuinn, Kendellen and Gavin Coombes complete the side.\n\nMunster: Mike Haley (Preston Grasshoppers); Seán O’Brien (Mullingar RFC), Antoine Frisch (Paris Université Club), Alex Nankivell (Christchurch Boys High School), Shane Daly (Highfield RFC); Tony Butler (Ennis RFC), Craig Casey (Shannon RFC); Josh Wycherley (Bantry Bay RFC), Niall Scannell (PBC Cork), John Ryan (Muskerry RFC); Tom Ahern (Youghal RFC), RG Snyman (Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool); Ruadhán Quinn (Ballina-Killaloe RFC), Alex Kendellen (C) (PBC Cork), Gavin Coombes (Skibbereen RFC).\n\nReplacements: Eoghan Clarke (CBC Monkstown), Jeremy Loughman (Athy RFC), Stephen Archer (Cork Constitution FC), Fineen Wycherley (Bantry Bay RFC), Jack O’Sullivan (Sunday’s Well RFC), Ethan Coughlan (Ennis RFC), Rory Scannell (PBC Cork), Ben O’Connor (Highfield RFC)."
