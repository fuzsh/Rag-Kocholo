Movie Synopsis:

Winning an Academy Award for Best Musical Score (Michel Legrand) and nominated for three additional Oscars, this box-office hit is the sensual, heartwarming and sentimental story of three 15-year-old boys who spend a pleasant but sometimes painful summer vacation in New England. While his friends fumble with girls their own age, one boy finds first love in the arms of Jennifer ONeill (Bare Essence), a young war bride. An appealingly nostalgic and touching story rated three stars by Leonard Maltin.
