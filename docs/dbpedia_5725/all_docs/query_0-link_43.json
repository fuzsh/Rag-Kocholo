After the war, these so-called collaborators were chastised and indiscriminately labeled as traitors by those unable to grasp the complexity of their circumstances. Largely based on archival research, Summer of '42 attempts to separate fact from fallacy by examining the complex motives, treatment, and history of these Armenians."
