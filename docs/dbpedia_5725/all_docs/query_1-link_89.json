        "text": "For the second week in a row, “Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie” was the most-watched title on Netflix. The “SpongeBob” film hit 13.4 million views between Aug. 5 and 11, up from the 12.8 million views it reached after its first three days of streaming.\n\nAlso like last week, “A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder,” led by “Wednesday” star Emma Myers, was the biggest TV title of the week with 8.4 million views reached in its first full week of availability, an improvement on the previous week’s 7.4 million views in four days.\n\nAt No. 2 on the TV chart was the debut of “The Umbrella Academy” Season 4, which hit 8.4 million views in its first four days on Netflix. It was followed by docuseries “Simone Biles Rising,” which hit 3.7 million views in its fourth week on the chart, buoyed by Biles’ performance at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nTwo more debuts followed: the first season of the U.K. version of Netflix’s hit reality dating series “Love Is Blind,” reaching 3.6 million views, while Season 10 of “Gabby’s Dollhouse” opened with 3 million. Joe Rogan’s special “Burn the Boats” had its second week on the chart and hit 2.9 million views, with the second week of “Unsolved Mysteries” Volume 4 close behind it at 2.7 million.\n\nThe bottom of the chart was rounded out by titles that have been there for over a month: “Cobra Kai” Season 6 with 2.4 million views and “Too Hot to Handle” Season 6 with 1.5 million views, both in their fourth weeks, while the fifth week of availability for “Vikings: Valhalla” hit 1.3 million views.\n\nOf note on the non-English-language TV chart was the eighth and final season of Elite, which debuted on top with 1.9 million views.\n\nSee Netflix’s Top 10 lists for the week of July 22-28 below. The lists begin with English-language series and are followed by non-English-language TV shows, English-language movies, and then non-English-language movies."
