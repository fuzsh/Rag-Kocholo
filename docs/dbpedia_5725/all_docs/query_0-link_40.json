A portion of Houser’s Introduction reads as follows:\n\n“I was fortunate enough to voice the holiday television promos for CBS for over 20 years. During that time, the most anticipated show every year was Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Herbie J Pilato’s loving recollection of that special alone makes this book a wonderful Christmas read.\n\n“With The 12 Best Secrets of Christmas, Herbie J relays in words what makes Christmas so very special to so many. I’d forgotten many of the wonderful things that Herbie J so eloquently remembers and clarifies here. How wonderful to be lost in his unique style of expression that allows the reader to enjoy the magic of Christmas snow, only to be reminded of things like snow’s ‘more solid, cinnamon-colored cousin…the sand on the beach.’\n\n“Herbie J so beautifully captures the unique moments of innocence and delight that make childhood precious and filled with wide-eyed wonder. He speaks from the heart, and remembers, for one, the comfort and joy of his mother receiving a Christmas card that made him think to appreciate those who deliver them.”\n\nAccording to the book’s Press Release, The 12 Best Secrets of Christmas: A Treasure House of December Memories Revealed is a gathering of special real-life holiday recollections that invites the reader to embrace, enjoy, connect with, and remember the magic of Christmas. Garnered from the author’s holiday experiences of his youth, this book’s chapters are classified as “secrets,” with each revealing a special sentiment that may prove recognizable to all. Numbered from one to 12, the chapters coincide with the mainstream identification of the popular carol, “The 12 Days of Christmas.” While that famous holiday tune is referenced in “The 6th Secret” section of this book, every chapter offers its own separate insight into the many messages and favorite things that the holiday season brings and represents.”"
