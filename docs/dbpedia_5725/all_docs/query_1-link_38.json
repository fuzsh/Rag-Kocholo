        "text": "Azeen A. Khan is an Assistant Professor of English & Creative Writing at Dartmouth College and a licensed psychoanalyst with a clinical practice in New York City. She specializes in Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, postcolonial literatures and theory, and feminist and critical thought. Her book, The Subaltern Clinic, considers the relation between psychoanalysis, deconstruction, and postcolonial theory, focusing on the writings of Sigmund Freud, Jacques Derrida, Frantz Fanon, and Jacques Lacan. Representative publications from her forthcoming book can be found in Boundary2 and differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies. Prior to joining Dartmouth College, she was a Nancy L. Buc Postdoctoral Fellow in Gender Studies at the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women at Brown University.\n\nShe is a member of the Lacanian Compass, an associated group of the New Lacanian School (NLS). In addition to working with adults, she also works with children and adolescents, and is a candidate in the Child and Adolescent Program at the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research (IPTAR). As an extension of her teaching program at Dartmouth, she teaches two annual online reading seminars via zoom, which are open to all interested participants. The 2020 reading seminars are “Clinic of Foreclosures” (on Jacques Lacan’s Seminars III and XXIII) and “Metapsychology and Its Limits” (on Sigmund Freud’s SE Volumes XIV and XIX)."
