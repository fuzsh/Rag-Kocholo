        "text": "Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are coming back in style while filming the Simple Life reboot.\n\nThe pair were photographed at a Sonic Drive-In in Duarte, California, on Monday, August 5. After initially matching in the fast food chain‚Äôs iconic blue uniform with silver heels, Richie, 42, switched into a hot dog costume that she paired with a Sonic Drive-In hat.\n\nHilton, 43, and Richie announced earlier this summer that they were returning to their reality TV roots.\n\n‚ÄúUp Next.. Sill & Bill üíãüíã,‚Äù Richie wrote via Instagram in July alongside a mirror selfie of her and Hilton, who posted her own announcement, adding, ‚ÄúReady for another iconic adventure with this Legend üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èLoves it üíóThat‚Äôs Hot üî• #Sliving ‚ú®üëëüëë‚ú®#TheRealOG‚Äôs #SillyAndBilly #Sanasa #TheSimpleLife #IconsOnly.‚Äù\n\nHilton later reflected on getting the chance to film with Richie more than 15 years after the original show ended.\n\n‚ÄúHey guys, just got home from shooting with Nicole,‚Äù she said via Instagram that same month. ‚ÄúAs some of you may know, we are doing a reunion special to celebrate 20 years of our show, The Simple Life. It‚Äôs been so much fun and we‚Äôre planning something very, very special, and I thought the best place to find the people that I would want to be a part of this is here.‚Äù\n\nIn the post, Hilton teased that she was planning ‚Äúsomething iconic, fun‚Äù with Richie. ‚ÄúThat show was so special,‚Äù she concluded. ‚ÄúThe best memories ever. It‚Äôs such a huge part of our life and we love our fans so much, so we wanted you guys to be a part of this.‚Äù\n\nThe Simple Life, which aired from 2003 to 2007, followed Hilton and Richie as they left behind their glamorous lives and headed to Arkansas, Kentucky and more midwestern destinations to try blue-collar jobs.\n\nHilton previously told Us Weekly that The Simple Life reboot was going to be ‚Äúiconic.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited to do this with Nicole,‚Äù she exclusively shared in June. ‚ÄúWe have been best friends since we were two years old. So many of my best and most fun memories are with her. What we created together is so special and this is just going to be so iconic. I am so excited to do this for all the fans.‚Äù\n\nThe duo spoke about how the project was nearly two years in the making, adding, ‚ÄúWe are very excited. I can‚Äôt say much yet, but it‚Äôs going to get iconic. This is going to be a reunion show about our friendship. ‚Ä¶ We are the OG‚Äôs and I am so proud of that show and how it just inspired so many other people.‚Äù"
