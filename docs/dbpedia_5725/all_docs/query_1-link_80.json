        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Andrew Sodroski and Aggregate Films are in early development on a series inspired by Philadelphia’s Main Line Murders for Netflix, sources tell Deadline.\n\nNetflix declined to comment. But we’re told this is a limited series that Sodroski will write and exec produce, with Aggregate producing.\n\nThe story here is thrust into motion in the early hours of June 25th, 1979, when the affluent Main Line area of Philadelphia was rocked by the brutal slaying of English teacher Susan Reinert. The case, which became one of the most infamous in the region’s history, began when Susan’s naked body was discovered stuffed in the trunk of her car in a Harrisburg motel parking lot. Her children, Karen and Michael, were missing, presumed dead, although their bodies were never found. The shocking nature of the murders quickly captivated public attention and drew intense media scrutiny, highlighting significant flaws in the criminal justice system, including issues of evidence handling and prosecutorial ethics.\n\nHighly in demand these days, Sodroski was most recently set to showrun, write and exec produce The 500, a series adaptation of the novel from The Night Agent‘s Matthew Quirk for Amazon MGM Studios. Prior to that, he sold Netflix on a pitch for an untitled law school thriller, which 42 will produce. Additionally, he penned Holland, Michigan, an upcoming suburban thriller starring Nicole Kidman, Gael García Bernal and Matthew Macfadyen, which Mimi Cave directed for Amazon MGM, with 42 and Blossom Films producing. Prior to his work on these projects, Sodroski wrote and exec produced two seasons of the true crime anthology series, Manhunt, earning a WGA Award nomination for the first.\n\nFounded by Jason Bateman in 2012, Aggregate is coming off success with Apple TV+’s miniseries Lessons in Chemistry, which is currently nominated for 10 Emmys, and Richard Linklater’s Glen Powell vehicle Hit Man, which came in as the most-watched streaming original when it debuted on Netflix in June with 1.5 billion minutes watched in its first seven days. Upcoming projects for the company include the horror comedy Hell of a Summer, marking the directorial debut of Stranger Things‘ Finn Wolfhard and Billy Bryk, and the Netflix limited series Black Rabbit starring Bateman and Jude Law.\n\nMost recently, Aggregate came aboard to produce an untitled adult thriller spec that Michael Werwie set up at Netflix, also inking a deal to produce the Netflix feature comedy The Chaperone, with an eye for Bateman to potentially star.\n\nSodroski is repped by 42, CAA and attorney David Fox of Myman Greenspan Fox."
