        "text": "Promotional material for Decoded Photo: Dourtesy of Douban\n\nThe highly anticipated Chinese film Decoded, directed by Chen Sicheng, already sparked a fervor among audiences during its preview screenings, setting the stage for a blockbuster 2024 summer season.\n\nKnown for his success with the Detective Chinatown franchise, Chen brings to life the story of Rong Jinzhen, a mathematical genius with a fragile personality who devotes himself to the art of code-breaking. The film, which intertwines Rong's life with China's unique history from 1944 to 1964, is set to officially hit Chinese theaters this Saturday.\n\nDecoded is based on Chinese writer Jia Mai's best-selling Chinese spy novel of the same name, which was translated into English in 2002. The film, shot entirely with IMAX technology, boasts an impressive cast including Liu Haoran, John Cusack, Daniel Wu, and Chen Daoming. Chen Sicheng, who also serves as the screenwriter, has expressed that this adaptation is his creative pinnacle, standing on the \"shoulders of literary giants.\"\n\nDuring the pre-screening ceremony, Chen Sicheng shared that the central theme of the film is the idea that every individual is a unique code and that life itself is a process of decoding. He described the core of the film as an exploration of an individual's sense of powerlessness and being driven by the currents of the era.\n\nThe director revealed that he has placed cost and commercial considerations secondary to the artistic vision of Decoded. The film's depth, with its historical span and interplay between reality and dreams, coupled with profound national and personal feelings, demanded his full creative energy.\n\n\"I think at least this time, with the team, we used a relatively limited financial budget to attempt to make something that is not inferior to Hollywood blockbusters in terms of the audio-visual experience and in every other aspect. We want to break the rule that 'such big movies can only be made by Hollywood.' Despite such standards, what we have made is actually a very localized expression,\" he said.\n\nIn terms of music, for the first time, The Beatles have authorized the use of their music in an Asian film, marking a significant milestone for Decoded. The fee for their songs is among the most expensive ever in cinema history.\n\nDuring a seminar, author Jia Mai shared his inspiration for writing about the unsung heroes like Rong Jinzhen, expressing his hope to pay tribute to them and to China through the film. He also acknowledged Decoded as \"the best adaptation of his works to date,\" praising its efforts in showcasing China's image to the world.\n\nChen Daoming, the special guest star of the film and the chairman of the China Film Association, also shared his feelings about shooting the film. He said a person's excellence does not lie in age or level of education, but in a person's own excellence. \"Rong Jinzhen's excellence is his own excellence, and I believe he would also be excellent in other industries,\" he said.\n\nLead actor Liu Haoran revealed that he was particularly excited after reading the script. He was touched that in the last moments of Rong Jinzhen's life, he still expressed his feelings for his country and home from his heart.\n\n\"I believe that after the movie is released, young audiences will have a deeper understanding of the concepts of 'country' and 'home,'\" he said.\n\nThe film is set to be released in North America, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and other major international markets later this year, according to The Hollywood Reporter."
