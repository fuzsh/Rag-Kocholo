        "text": "To take part in a Summer Piscine 2024 at 42 Paris, we are holding introduction meetings (check-ins) until June. Places are limited: consult the recruitment calendar (in French).\n\nThe introduction meetings (check-ins) are organised in the months preceding the Piscines. Places are limited.\n\nOther check-ins will be organised before the 2025 Piscines.\n\nMost check-ins take place on site at 42 Paris. Exceptionally, some check-ins may take place remotely: in this case, 42 Paris will inform you at the time of registration. It is not possible to request priority for a remote check-in.\n\nFor 2024, 42 Paris will be offering Piscines at the beginning of 2024 (February, March) and then in the summer (July, August, September).\n\nRegistration will soon be open to everyone who has passed the check-in.\n\nFor 2024, 42 Paris is proposing a spring start date and an autumn start date.\n\nThe spring session, on May 13th 2024, will be reserved exclusively for people who took a Piscine at the beginning of 2024.\n\nThe autumn session, on November 14th 2024, will be reserved exclusively for people who took a Piscine in the summer of 2024.\n\nYou can start your application for 42 Paris at any time of the year. However, the compulsory check-in and Piscine steps are limited, both in terms of number and the number of places available: so prepare in advance.\n\nYes, you can: the process is the same for everyone. However, 42 is not a distance learning course. You must be able to be present on one of the 42 campuses for the selection process and the whole curriculum.\n\n42 doesn’t deliver any visas. You should check with your embassy. International candidates can contact the staff through the admissions platform for an invitation to the Piscine when they are registered to one.\n\nFor 42 Campus in Paris, after completing the Piscine, you will be able to get a registration certificate that will help you obtain your visa at your embassy. You may also contact the Campus France organization.\n\nEven though 42 supports atypical profiles, we do not encourage dropping out of high school, so we do not recommend the training to students before their coming of age.\n\nPeople under 18 may still apply to 42 if they’re in their last year of high school. They will only be able to access the Piscine once they’ve obtained their high school diploma.\n\nThe training program at 42 is unique: there are no years. Everyone starts at the beginning of the program but each student progresses at his or her own pace. It is not possible to join 42 in the middle of the program.\n\nFor 42 Campus in Paris, you will have to respect 2 specific steps: The online check takes place online on the admission page a few weeks before the Piscine starts. Then, you will have to proceed with the ID check, on site, a few days before the Piscine.\n\nWe don’t communicate the selection criteria. There’s only one rule: During the Piscine, give everything you’ve got. This is the only way you will know if 42’s methods suit your expectations.\n\nThere are no selection quotas at 42. Some slots for the introduction meeting/check-in and the Piscine are temporarily reserved to allow women to register over a longer period of time.\n\nYou can take up to 2 Piscines in your lifetime, on all campuses of 42 and its partners. A minimum of 300 days between these 2 Piscines must be respected.\n\nYou will have to start your year on the campus where you took your Piscine. If you took your Piscine in Paris, you will have to start your year in Paris.\n\n42 training is intense. It is not recommended to have a full-time job on the side. A part-time job is more reasonable, but it requires serious personal discipline.\n\nOn Campus 42 in Paris, apprenticeship is possible as part of the preparation for one of the approved titles (RNCP) offered. In any case, you must reach the end of the common-core syllabus.\n\nThe 42 certificate is issued when the student decides to end their training after having completed the core curriculum. It attests to the final level obtained at 42. Depending on the student’s personal pathway, it ranges from level 9 (validation of the core curriculum) to level 21 (validation of several thematic branches available in the curriculum, which may include periods of professionalization).\n\nFor 42 Campus in Paris, you will be able to find a flat share or accommodation for the Piscine and afterwards on the https://home.42.fr/ platform. You will need the campus code born2code to create an account.\n\nFor 42 Campus in Paris, 42 has tied many extracurricular partnerships with commercial institutions such as banks. Ask the school administration to provide you with a list as soon as you enter school."
