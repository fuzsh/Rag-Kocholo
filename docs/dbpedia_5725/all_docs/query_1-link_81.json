        "text": "Michelangelo Frammartino is a 42-year-old Milanese artist, originally trained as an architect, who has recently turned from photography and video installations to the cinema. His second film, Le Quattro Volte (\"The Four Times\"), is a sort of documentary about life in the awesomely beautiful but impoverished southern area of Calabria from where his family originally moved north. Specifically it's about the remote mountain town of Caulonia, though it is only named in the final credits.\n\nThis extraordinary movie is, however, much more than one of those films about someone visiting a neglected corner of the world to observe ancient customs that linger on and ruefully comment on changing times. It is an essay, a cinematic poem, a spiritual exploration of time and space, and it's designed to make us think and feel about the world around us and our place in it.\n\nThe movie that first came to my mind while watching Le Quattro Volte is The Tree of Wooden Clogs, Ermanno Olmi's masterly, documentary-style account of a year in the lives of five peasant families in 1898 Lombardy. But Frammartino, although also working with non-professional performers, does not have Olmi's explicit interest in historic injustice, and he aims to go beyond the human and the social.\n\nHe embraces the numinous and uses religious symbolism but does not necessarily engage with conventional religion. His film has no distinctly audible dialogue so doesn't need subtitles, and he doesn't move his camera during the first half-hour. There is no music, just the sound of bells, of the wind in the trees, of the bleating of goats.\n\nThe movie begins by introducing us to two central figures. One is a charcoal-burner tending his kiln, the surface of which looks like a volcano. The other is an elderly goatherd tending his flock in the breathtaking countryside. The charcoal burner doesn't appear again until much later. Only the old peasant is seen in close-up as he and his dog drive the goats from the hills back to their pen at the edge of the town. Everyone else is seen from a distance, remote figures both in town and in the landscape.\n\nThe film subtly draws us into its own sense of time as the goatherd completes the rituals of the day and prepares for bed by taking a strange grey medicinal powder in water. This turns out to be dust from the local church, which supposedly has therapeutic power and is provided for him by an old woman, probably the priest's housekeeper, in exchange for milk. We first see this dust dancing magically high up in the air inside the church.\n\nThese two old people represent old folk traditions existing beside and within the church, and in a brilliantly orchestrated sequence we see the goatherd die at Easter time. His death coincides with a procession of villagers walking out of town to a nearby hill where the actor playing Christ will place his cross beside the two already there. We've seen three men dressed as centurions arrive and the local Mary and Martha join them, and the camera pans to the right as the people move to their Calvary. But the camera does not go to Golgotha. It remains behind, looking down on the diligent dog, who first intimidates a tardy altar boy running after the paschal procession, then causes an accident that releases the goats to roam the town and to be present at their master's deathbed. This is both funny and touching, something that will move those of a religious inclination and amuse admirers of Luis Buñuel.\n\nThereafter, the goats are under new management whose faces are not seen and whose dress (jeans and rubber boots) is less traditional. A kid is born and later goes astray. Winter is registered by a single shot of a snow-covered landscape. Suddenly spring is back with what one supposes to be some kind of fertility ritual that involves everyone in town helping to cut down a vast fir tree, trimming it and dragging it into town to erect in the square near the church. From a nearby roof we see an intrepid young man shin up it. As with everything else we're invited to watch, wonder and make of it what we will.\n\nAt this point the charcoal-burners re-enter the scene to cut up the tree and transport it to their corner of the mountains. They conduct their task using ancient skills, their work resembling the pyre for a god or a hero, and we observe it with reverence. Later we see the charcoal brought back to be used by the townspeople who brought down the tree.\n\nOne can sit and enjoy this film in a meditative mood, and very likely one may infer or intuit something of Frammartino's underlying aims. The title, Le Quattro Volte, comes from Pythagoras, who lived in Calabria in the 6th century BC and apparently spoke of each of us having four lives within us – the mineral, the vegetable, the animal and the human – \"thus we must know ourselves four times\". In bringing the goats, the tree and the charcoal-burning process to the foreground and relegating the humans to a less dominant position than is customary, Frammartino believes he has given the audience \"a pleasant surprise: the animal, vegetable and mineral realms are granted as much dignity as the human one\"."
