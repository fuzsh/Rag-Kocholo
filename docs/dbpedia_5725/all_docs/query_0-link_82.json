        "meta_description": "In “All Summer in a Day”, I think the message/theme of the story is bullying, which is caused by jealousy and envy. It's not good to be jealous because it is a dangerous thing that can hurt people, such as Margot. Margot was bullied because she was different. She was only viewed as “different” because she came from the earth and unlike everyone else, Margot got to enjoy the sun every day of her life for 5 years, so she knows how the sun's warmth and light feel like. As a result, the children were upset since they had no memory of what the sun was like and Margot did, despite the fact that they last saw it when they were 2 years old. I feel like Margot could have been treated better in a way, meaning that instead of her classmates hating on her, they could have asked curious questions that they had about the sun or maybe made an effort to show some kindness to her. In my opinion, Ray Bradbury wrote this short story to not be jealous of one another, and that being kind goes a long way. If everyone was kind to Margot it would have been a completely different story because maybe Margot wouldn’t have been sad about moving to Venus and dealing with the rain every day.",
