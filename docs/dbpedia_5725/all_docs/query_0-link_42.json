        "text": "Almost all the reviews on this site for 'Summer of ’42' range between sub-par, to poor. If Stanley Kubrick can recognize the greatness of this film so much so as to claim it was one of his favorites, and then include it in, 'The Shining', then obviously anyone who sees it as less than gold isn't thinking straight. subjectivity isn't real either lmao jk\n\nI'm writing this mainly just to tell all of you who haven't seen this film, to do so. It's touching, genuine, authentic, and surprisingly hypnotizing (referring to the last 10-15 minutes). The ending seems to only last a quick moment and yet also seems to last an entire night. It's so engaging, and so intimate. It's just beautifully handled.\n\n1971 In Review - April\n\n#7\n\nTeenage Herman Raucher (Gary Grimes), summering on Nantucket Island with his sex-obsessed pals Oscy (Jerry Houser) and Benji (Oliver Conant) during World War II, meets Dorothy (Jennifer O'Neill), a newlywed in her 20s whose husband is off at war. As his friends awkwardly attempt to woo girls their own age, Herman slowly befriends the older woman and finds himself becoming increasingly in love with her, until a sudden tragedy changes their lives forever.\n\nThis is a criminally under seen gem, it’s a both heartfelt and bittersweet story about first love and a teenagers first journey into sex. It’s not a tacky and juvenile film like Porkys and countless other sex teen comedies. Instead this…\n\nThis is the movie that Wendy and Danny are watching in \"The Shining.\"\n\nI don't know. I feel like this is everything wrong with the upbringing of American men when it comes to women.\n\nThe movie was good but then...the theater was dead quiet for THAT SCENE, nothing but the quiet pops and clicks of the 35mm print echoing off the walls, trembling on the sprocket like young Hermie. What a magic trick where a movie can make you feel like you're watching something you shouldn't be seeing. That Michael Legrand score is immortal. Four stars!"
