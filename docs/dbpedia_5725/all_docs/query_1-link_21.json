        "text": "MOREHOUSE ENGLISH MAJORS ACQUIRE THE INTERDISCIPLINARY AND INTERCULTURAL SKILLS IN CRITICAL THINKING AND WRITING NECESSARY TO SUCCEED IN ADVANCED STUDIES IN THE HUMANITIES AND ALL PROFESSIONAL CAREERS.\n\nEnglish majors gain an abiding appreciation of world literature and cultures—textual, visual, and digital—and acquire the interdisciplinary and intercultural skills in critical thinking and writing necessary to succeed in advanced studies in the humanities and all professional careers. The English major offers three concentrations: Africana Literature and Cultural Studies, Traditional English Studies, and Writing. The program provides a comprehensive curriculum of traditional and contemporary course selections with robust offerings in the African American and Africana literary traditions. The faculty is devoted to the teaching of writing across disciplines, including research skills, literary and cultural criticism, and creative writing.\n\nMorehouse students must be effective communicators whose abilities in reading, writing, speaking, and listening reflect their sustained intellectual preparation and commitment to humanistic inquiry. Diverse and interdisciplinary courses represent the effort of the department to meet students’ societal needs and interests and to broaden career opportunities for majors and minors. Because of its emphasis on communication skills, critical thinking, and cultural diversity, English provides a firm foundation for those interested in fields such as education and scholarship, creative writing, and journalism, as well as social activism, theology, law, and business.\n\nBACHELOR OF ARTS IN ENGLISH\n\nMAJOR COURSE OF STUDY REQUIREMENTS AND CURRICULUM\n\nStudents who complete the requirements for the English major will earn a bachelor of arts degree. The B.A. requires 42 hours in English major courses. The curriculum for the major in English includes 10 mandatory core courses that include the HENG 241 Literary Form gateway course and the HENG 497 Senior Seminar capstone course. Senior Seminar serves as the capstone course for all fields of concentration. After completing the other English core courses, students will choose from three areas of concentration. This new curriculum allows students to choose at least four of their courses based on their career interests. As a part of the Senior Seminar, the senior project will focus on the student’s area of concentration.\n\nGeneral Education (Core)\n\n33-48 hours\n\nRefer to the general education requirements for more information.\n\nEnglish Major — 42 hours\n\nThe following courses are required:\n\nHENG 241— Literary Form\n\nHENG 341— Literary Theory\n\nHENG 377— Shakespeare\n\nHENG 380— Survey of African American Literature I\n\nHENG 497— Senior Seminar\n\nChoose two courses in British literature from the list below:\n\nHENG 271— Survey of English Literature I\n\nHENG 272— Survey of English Literature II\n\nHENG 375— Chaucer\n\nHENG 376— Milton\n\nHENG 478— Nineteenth-Century British Novel\n\nChoose two courses in American literature from the list below:\n\nHENG 363— Survey of American Literature I\n\nHENG 364— Survey of American Literature II\n\nHENG 366— Literature of American Civil Rights\n\nChoose one course in grammar and linguistics from the list below:\n\nHENG 247— Advanced Grammar and Editing\n\nHENG 265— Advanced Composition: Writing Criticism\n\nHENG 273— History of the English Language\n\nAfricana Literature and Cultural Studies Concentration\n\nChoose four from the list below (two courses must be 400-level):\n\nHENG 265— Advanced Composition/Writing\n\nHCTM 320— Film Criticism and Theory\n\nHCTM 235— Introduction to Film\n\nHENG 345— Introduction to Disability Studies\n\nHENG 350— Global Modernism\n\nHENG 357— Selected Caribbean Poetry\n\nHENG 360— Topics in Africana Literature/Cultural Studies (courses cross listed with Africana Studies)\n\nHENG 366— Literature of American Civil Rights\n\nHENG 379— African American Biography and Autobiography\n\nHENG 381— Survey of African American Literature II\n\nHENG 417— The Nobel Laureates\n\nHENG 454— Latin American Fiction and Film\n\nHENG 457— The Caribbean Novel\n\nHENG 461— West African Fiction and Film\n\nTraditional English Studies Concentration\n\nChoose four from the list below (two courses must be 400-level):\n\nHENG 247— Advanced Grammar and Editing\n\nHENG 265— Advanced Composition: Writing Criticism\n\nHENG 273— History of the English Language\n\nHENG 350— Global Modernism\n\nHENG 375— Chaucer\n\nHENG 376— Milton\n\nHENG 381— Survey of African American Literature II\n\nHENG 441— Contemporary Theory and Practice\n\nHENG 478— Nineteenth-Century British Novel\n\nHENG 489— Major African American Authors\n\nHENG 490— Shakespeare and Film\n\nHENG 491— Shakespeare and His Contemporaries\n\nWriting Concentration\n\nTWO (2) courses must be a 300-level; ONE (1) course must be a 400-level course:\n\nHENG 265— Advanced Composition: Writing Criticism\n\nHENG 273— History of the English Language\n\nHENG 290— Introduction to Creative Writing\n\nHENG 387— Advanced Grammar\n\nHENG 390— Creative Writing Non-Fiction\n\nHENG 392— Creative Writing: Fiction and Drama\n\nHENG 393— Business and Professional Writing\n\nHENG 441— Contemporary Theory and Practice\n\nHENG 483— Harlem Renaissance\n\nHENG 485— Contemporary African American Novel"
