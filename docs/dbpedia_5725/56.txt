Written by Herman Raucher, Summer of '42 is one of the screen's most haunting romances. A nation caught up in a war that will forever change it. At a New England beach colony, 15-year-old Hermie is caught up in a passion that will forever change him: he's infatuated with 22-year-old Dorothy, whose soldier/husband is away at war. Director Robert Mulligan keeps a sharp eye on the period detail and the comic potential of growing up, keenly observed in the work of Grimes. Jerry Houser and Oliver Conant as a "terrible trio" of fast friends. An Academy Award winner for Michel Legrand's score, Summer of '42 is the stuff of the fondest movie memories. Director: Robert Mulligan. Actors: Jennifer O'Neil, Gary Grimes, Jerry Houser, Oliver Conant. Color. Country: USA. Subject: WWII. No subtitles.
