        "text": "'Stayed on Freedom' is a compelling account of a radical Black family\n\nBy Ajamu Dillahunt\n\n- Dan Berger, a scholar of the Black Power movement, has written a remarkable intergenerational story about the Simmons family's long involvement in the Black freedom struggle, from Zoharah's and Michael's SNCC organizing and human rights work to Aishah's anti-rape activism. The title comes from lyrics to a civil rights anthem that for them has been more than a slogan â€” it's been a guide to a life of service to the people."
