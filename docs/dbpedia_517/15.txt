Pat Green is a Texas Country artist, a three time Grammy nominee, a businessman, an amateur artist, and a Texas Native.

At a young age, Pat Green saw his dad perform in Music Man through their community theater and became fascinated with his dad’s ability to emotionally enthrall an audience. This sparked a desire in Pat to do the same. He would play his tennis racket guitar to the mirror in his bedroom, imagining he was performing for a lively crowd. In college, his roommate didn’t like hearing him practice his guitar, so Pat would sneak down to the laundry room in the basement. Eventually, he’d bribe his way to open for artists like Willie Nelson and Jack Ingram. Unafraid to hustle, Pat says that he was always a freight train that couldn’t be stopped. His determination and willingness to take big risks served him well, but he also speaks honestly about his inability to hold back and having to pay the price for it.

A trailblazer of the Texas Country Music genre, Pat Green saw a space for a new kind of sound. He focused on sharing stories in his music, exploring times he went too far in addition to celebrating the good times. Every move Pat made was strategic, from merchandising to writing with intense vulnerability.

Pat Green is not simply a Texas Country Music Legend. He is a storyteller, an entrepreneur, and a man who cares deeply about his family.
