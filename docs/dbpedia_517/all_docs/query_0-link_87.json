        "text": "Thursday evening (10-28), Old 97’s frontman Rhett Miller helped organize the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation’s “Breathe Easy” CF Concert Series featuring a host of cool artists from the country, alt-country and roots world raising money to help find therapeutics and a cure for the disease.\n\nAnother guy that paid all the dues and left a crater of an impact, even though he never hit the big time has passed onto that honky tonk in the sky. His name was Chris Wall, and even if you’ve never heard of him or his music, you’ve certainly heard his influence in many of your favorite artists.\n\nThe Texas, Red Dirt, and Americana-oriented Mile 0 Fest in Key West, Florida will be moving forward in 2021, and they have just announced the festival’s preliminary lineup. Usually occurring in late January/early February, they have moved the date later in the year due to COVID-19 concerns.\n\nThere’s nothing new about staring at the “New Artist” nominees for a country music industry awards show and being bewildered at the names you see. It’s an annual exercise. This year the names included in the CMA’s “New Artist of the Year” category were no different.\n\nBen Dorcy is the nearly 92-year-old original roadie who started in 1950 and worked with Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash and June Carter, Jerry Jeff Walker, and even more modern artists like Randy Rogers and Jack Ingram. Though he may not be as well known as the artists themselves, Ben Dorcy is one of the most beloved individuals in all of Texas music.\n\nWithout anyone left to please but himself, Pat Green is free to exorcise his demons, get some stuff off his chest, make the album he wants to, and hopefully reconnect with those grassroots in Texas country that once helped carry him to the top, and he once turned his back on. To some his name will continue to be mud, but that doesn’t mean his musical output will be.\n\nTexas country artist Pat Green recently released a new single called “While I Was Away” ahead of the release of his new record Home on August 14th, and when asked what he thought about the new artists and the new style of country music prevailing in the mainstream today, he not only took the high road, he had some high praise for one of country music’s most notorious repeat offenders.\n\nWow. My little country music heart was sent reeling this morning when I rolled up to the track list and list of contributors for the new Waylon â€“ The Music Inside, Vol. 2 compilation due out January 24th. The thing read like my lampoon of the unfinished Hank Williams songs, but unfortunately it is all too real folks.\n\nReal quick, Big G’s interview with Hank III last night was amazing. It’s lasted 1 hr 20 min and covered all kinds of stuff, but instead of trying to give the Cliff Notes version right now and make you salivate for something you can’t hear, I’ll wait until Big G posts it to his podcast […]\n\nFirst: On Friday I got my much belated, but much anticipated Metal Farm Magazine in the mail! Now I knew there was going to be pictures of Hank III done by Keith Neltner and Reinstate Hank Williams content, BUT NOBODY TOLD ME ABOUT THE HOT CHICKS!!! Dude, there are hot women in their skivies in […]"
