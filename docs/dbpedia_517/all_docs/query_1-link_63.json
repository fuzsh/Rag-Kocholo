        "text": "I love Pat Green and he put on a great show but the acoustics were terrible. His voice was mumbled as were the other vocals and their instruments.\n\nI am sure this is something The Rustic needs to work on not Pat Green. I saw him at Texas Live and he sounded great.\n\nThank you for a fun evening\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nWith fifteen songs making it to the prestigious Billboard Top Country Songs, and ten studio albums, Pat Green has had an immensely successful career over the last 20 years.\n\nI wasn’t sure whether Green would play his entire set on guitar, or have his band backing him, but I was delighted when his band appeared behind him after his first couple of acoustic songs. It was great to have the variety, and the sound that those guys produce together is simply electric. They are probably one of the tightest bands I’ve heard, let alone seen live, and their melodic harmonies with Pat Green’s distinctive and powerful voice echoing over the top of their chords was something that can only be recognised live.\n\nOf course the artist needs to enjoy their set to make a great show, but seeing Green make a conscious effort to play the tracks that the audience were yearning for was wonderful. He played all the hits and big tracks, and would even stop to hold out the microphones during the choruses to let everyone join in singing. His dedication to the music was evident in the quality of his performance and his voice and energy didn’t waver once. It was one of the best country music events I’ve been to in years. If you’re a fan there’s no way you can miss out!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
