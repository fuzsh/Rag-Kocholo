His forever home is located at the Main Gate of the Fairgrounds (open all day) and is handicap accessible for everyone to view!\n\nHere are some cool facts about the “Giant”!\n\nThere is a Naming Contest happening on our Facebook Page. Name will be released in June.\n\nBear Hollow Wood Carvers from French Link, Indiana carved this “Giant”\n\nThere were 9 wood carvers working on the “Giant” simultaneously that represented 5 different states\n\nHe is 27′ tall!\n\nHe is 18′ across from shoulder to shoulder.\n\nThe head alone weighs 600-700 pounds.\n\nThe carvers used 300′ of treated 2’x4′ boards\n\n5,000′ of Poplar Wood was used to create the “hair”\n\nWe are currently working to complete landscaping around the “Giant” and creating Photo Opportunities for people to sit and take pictures. Upgrades are happening every day so stay tuned to our Facebook Page!"
