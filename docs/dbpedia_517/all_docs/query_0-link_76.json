        "text": "By Eric Woods of the Caller-Times\n\nThe first time Texas singer/songwriter Pat Green ever performed in Corpus Christi was to open for the Bellamy Brothers.\n\nWhile he doesn't remember the name of the venue, or even the year of the performance, he does remember writing a song in the parking lot while waiting for his time on stage.\n\n\"That night I wrote a song waiting in the parking lot and I didn't have anything else to do,\" Green said and chuckled. \"The song is called 'Number 2,' and it was the second song I had written after the first record came out. I really didn't start naming the songs until I got to six.\"\n\nThese days Green is on the road promoting his latest album, \"Home,\" and is his first album release since 2012.\n\nHis current single from the album is called \"While I Was Away,\" and was written by another Texas country singer/songwriter, Zane Williams.\n\n\"While I Was Away,\" is about parents who spend a great deal of time away from home, and must watch their children growing up without them.\n\n\"Home\" is an independent release for Green, and it was an opportunity to record with his road band. It was also Green's chance to record the songs he wanted with some of his friends, including Lyle Lovett, Sheryl Crow and Delbert McClinton.\n\nAs for any other locally inspired memories, Green said he remembers the first time he heard Texas music icon Robert Earl Keen. Green said he was attending one of Keen's concerts at the Executive Surf Club.\n\nGreen also said Brewster Street Ice House is one of his favorite venues.\n\n\"Brewster Street Ice House is just a great example of a Texas dance hall,\" Green said. \"It's perfect because it's down there by the water and there's always a good breeze and a great crowd to go with it.\""
