Smith as the official starter.\n\nSaturday, March 16, will be a full day of fun on Bridge Street, with The World’s Shortest Zero-K footrace amd entertainment by DJ Courier preceding the concert.\n\nThe schedule:\n\n• 3 p.m. — Bridge Street Entertainment District opens\n\n• 4 p.m. — Zero-K race, with prizes for best costume and slowest finisher\n\n• 5 p.m. — DJ Courier entertains\n\n• 7 p.m. — Bonnie Montgomery performs\n\n• 8 p.m. — Pat Green performs\n\nWith roots in White County, Arkansas, Montgomery is lauded for her polished parlor songs, her lawless country barnburners and for the classical opera arias she’s penned at the piano.\n\nDale Watson called her “a sophisticated badass who was born to sing.” Counterpunch Magazine hailed her operatic compositions as “white trash arias.”\n\n“Billy Blythe,” her 2016 short-length opera about President Bill Clinton’s youth in Hot Springs, has earned accolades from The New Yorker and Huffington Post, and her second full-length album “Forever” drew praise from Paste magazine for its “timeless songwriting.”\n\nHer new album is “River.”\n\nShe was named the 2020 Entertainer of the Year with the Arkansas Country Music Awards, ACMA 2019 Americana/Roots Artist of the Year, the title of Outlaw Female at the 2016 Ameripolitan Awards and the titles of Best Americana Artist and Best Female Vocalist at the 2018 Arkansas Country Music Awards.\n\n“Billy Blythe” received worldwide coverage from dozens of networks and news sources from the BBC to CNN. The opera had its world premiere at Opera Ithaca after developmental workshop performances in Arkansas and New York City and has gone on to be performed by opera companies and colleges and universities around the country.\n\nMontgomery has supported major acts in the U.S. and abroad, including The Gossip, Billy Jo Shaver, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Ramblin Jack Elliot, Hayes Carll, Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Shovels and Rope, Joe Ely, and more.\n\nTexas country music star Pat Green “has had more recognizable hits than you can shake a stick at, and he will be a great start to St. Pat's weekend,” Visit Hot Springs CEO and parade founder Steve Arrison said. “St. Patrick’s Day falls on a Sunday this year, so we decided to open the weekend on Saturday with a free concert on Bridge Street.”\n\nThe World’s Shortest St. Patrick’s Day Parade annually attracts more than 30,000 fans from across the country to Bridge Street, which Ripley’s Believe It or Not declared the World’s Shortest Street in Everyday Use. It features an array of 40 or more zany entries that include a troupe of marching Irish Elvis Presley impersonators, the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, wacky floats, marching bands and assorted marchers who adopt the parade’s irreverent take on the boisterous holiday.\n\nFor more information call Steve Arrison at 501-321-2027.\n\n###"
