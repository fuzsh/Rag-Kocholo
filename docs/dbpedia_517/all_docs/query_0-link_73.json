        "text": "Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Pat Green has released his first new album since 2015, Miles And Miles Of You, available everywhere now.\n\nProduced by Dwight A. Baker, the 10 new tracks mix Green’s poetic flair with organic instrumentation as he explores life, love and beyond. The album includes the tribute to long-lasting love, “Steady,” the romantic “Build You A Bar,” “All In This Together” (featuring Abby Anderson), and the project’s expansive title track. Green dropped “If It Don’t Have A Honky Tonk” in July, which is already in the top 30 at Texas Regional Radio and climbing."
