        "text": "\"Way Back Texas\" by Pat Green (Wendell Mobley/Craig Wiseman)\n\n1st Verse\n\nSometimes it's a car\n\nA certain shade of misty blue\n\nI think of you\n\nAnd I wonder how on earth you are\n\nOr sometimes just a song\n\nIs playin' on my radio\n\nAnd there I go\n\nJust a'wishin' you were singin' along\n\nPre Chorus\n\nAnd that's all it takes\n\nAnd I drift off to dreamin' I'm in\n\nChorus\n\nWay Back, Texas\n\n(You were) (Were you) layin' in my arms\n\nHad a class ring necklace\n\nWe're gonna buy that little farm\n\nWay down by the river\n\nYeah, (raise a family) (live a'happily)\n\nDown in Way Back, Texas\n\n(Uh, huh) (Way back)\n\nPopulation: you and me\n\n2nd Verse\n\nMe, I'm doin' well\n\nWith no one in particular\n\nBut girl, I heard that you went\n\nAnd you rang them weddin' bells\n\nThey say his name is John\n\nHis daddy owns a dealership\n\nBut the slipper don't quite fit\n\nYeah, but life goes on and on\n\nPre Chorus\n\nSo I guess that I'll hang up\n\nI just wondered if you ever dream of\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\nBridge\n\nAnd every now and then\n\nIf you need me I'll be back in\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n\"Dixie Lullaby\" by Pat Green (Pat Green/Patrick Davis/Justin Andrew Pollard)\n\n1st Verse\n\nMy father had skin like leather\n\nHands like steel\n\nFrom a lifetime spent in a cotton field\n\nAnd though he'd come home tired and dirty\n\nAlmost every night\n\nHe found the strength to smile at me\n\nAnd hold my mama tight\n\nPre Chorus\n\nWhile that ol' transistor radio\n\nWould play the Opry out in the hall\n\nI'd sit and watch those shadows\n\nGlide across the wall\n\n1st Chorus\n\nAnd they danced to a Dixie lullaby\n\nA picture of love beneath a Southern sky\n\nOh my, what a beautiful life\n\nJust like a Dixie lullaby\n\n2nd Verse\n\nI left home at eighteen\n\nIn a hand-me-down Chevrolet\n\nPacked with my mama's cookin'\n\nAnd my old man's stubborn ways\n\nIt was college, work, and love\n\nAnd then the babies came\n\nThe youngest one got his grandaddy's name\n\nPre Chorus\n\nAnd in the early mornin' hours\n\nWhen my children could not sleep\n\nI'd rock them in my arms to a gentle be at\n\n2nd Chorus\n\nAnd sing them a Dixie lullaby\n\nHush baby, don't you start to cry\n\nOh my, what a beautiful life\n\nJust like a Dixie lullaby\n\n3rd Verse\n\nMy father was a mountain of a man\n\nThat was the description that I gave\n\nThe mornin' that we laid him in his grave\n\nThere with my mama by his side\n\nI said my last goodbye\n\nTo a man I thought would never die\n\nPre Chorus\n\nAnd as I stood there in that field\n\nOf amazing grace\n\nOh, how the tears ran down my face\n\nTag Chorus\n\nAnd I sang him a Dixie lullaby\n\nWe'll meet again by and by\n\nOh my, what a beautiful life\n\nJust like a Dixie lullaby\n\nOh my, what a beautiful life\n\nJust like a Dixie lullaby\n\n\"Feels Just Like It Should\" by Pat Green (Pat Green/Brett James/Justin Andrew Pollard)\n\n1st Verse\n\nLet's jump in my El Camino, uh uh huh\n\nRoll the windows down\n\nThought we'd see\n\nWhat kind 'a trouble we could find\n\nOut on this messed up little town\n\nPut the Boss on the radio, uh huh\n\nTake whatever comes\n\nWe'll go flyin' down the highway\n\nWith my arm around you\n\nSingin' 'Born to Run'\n\nChorus\n\n(And) it feels just like it should\n\nMust be some kind of miracle\n\nLike I got sun on my face\n\nAnd the rain it ain't never gonna fall\n\nIt feels so good\n\n(Oh) (Man) it's almost spiritual\n\nTomorrow's nowhere in sight\n\nRight now, right here tonight\n\nIt feels just like it should\n\n2nd Verse\n\nWell, you got your good looks, uh huh\n\nAnd you got your style\n\nAnd I drowned here in this ocean\n\nJust to have you float my boat for a while\n\nI've got a reputation, uh huh\n\nBut don't you worry 'bout that\n\nJust give me a chance\n\nAnd we're never gonna ever look back\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\nBridge\n\nMaybe Romeo gets the girl this time\n\nI guess everybody gets a chance to shine\n\nAnd tonight is mine\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n\"Baby Doll\" by Pat Green (Pat Green/Rob Thomas)\n\n1st Verse\n\nShe stops and checks her reflection\n\nIn a car parked on the corner\n\nShe said,\n\n'It's hell on me, this workin' down at the diner'\n\nSome people say,\n\n'Man, she was hot back when she was younger'\n\nYa, well, she was a dancer when she lived in LA\n\nPre Chorus\n\nShe was someone's baby doll\n\nA beauty queen to someone long ago\n\nFrom the midnight show\n\nChorus\n\nAnd (if) (when) you close your eyes\n\nYou hear the music playin'\n\nYou can see her dancin'\n\nUnderneath the spotlight, and\n\nWhen she sleeps\n\nShe dreams she's back in Hollywood\n\nBack when all the world was young\n\nAnd she was someone's baby doll\n\n2nd Verse\n\nShe stops and checks her reflection\n\nIn the bathroom on her lunch break\n\nShe says,\n\n'I still look good for someone half of my real age'\n\nSome people say,\n\n'Man, I bet she still makes love like an earthquake'\n\nYeah, but man, she ain't easy\n\nShe ain't lettin' you in, my friend, my friend\n\nPre Chorus\n\nIt's time to wake up, baby doll\n\nPut your best dress and your high heels on\n\nAnd dream you're gone\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n3rd Verse\n\nShe stops and calls an old friend\n\nFrom the pay phone at the subway\n\nShe says,\n\n'I feel like I'm just sittin' here\n\nWastin' my days away'\n\nPre Chorus\n\nIt's time to move on, baby doll\n\nAnd walk away just like you did before\n\nWhen you wanted more\n\nTag Chorus\n\nAnd when you close your eyes\n\nYou hear the music playin'\n\nYou can see her dancin'\n\nUnderneath the spotlight, and\n\nWhen she sleeps\n\nShe dreams she's back in Hollywood\n\nWhen she was a younger girl\n\nA pretty heart in a tainted world\n\nNot sure who you wanna be\n\nYour Daddy's little drama queen\n\nI hope that when you find yourself\n\nYou're more than just a baby doll\n\n\"Guy Like Me\" by Pat Green (Pat Green/David Neuhauser/Pat Green Band)\n\n1st Verse\n\nHearts and flowers\n\nForget love letters\n\nPain and anger\n\nForget forgiveness\n\nLove ain't waitin' (for) (on) a guy like me\n\n2nd Verse\n\nDebutants and champagne\n\nDiamonds and cocaine\n\nI ain't the son of\n\nOutrageous fortune\n\nCash ain't status for a guy like me\n\nChorus\n\n(So) Put me on a cool river\n\nTake my (worries) (sins) (pain) from me\n\nFly me high on a big, blue sky\n\nWhere there's no one here (but) (just) me\n\n((Ah) (Yeah) just me)\n\n3rd Verse\n\nLong black limosine\n\nPictures in magazines\n\nAll night parties\n\nBeautiful people\n\nNo supermodel for a guy like me\n\n4th Verse\n\nI'm just a good man\n\nI work with my hands\n\nI get the picture\n\nI heard the message\n\nHell ain't waitin' for a guy like me\n\n(Repeat Chorus Twice)\n\n(Repeat 1st Verse)\n\n(Chorus Out)\n\n\"Wave On Wave\" by Pat Green (Pat Green/David Neuhauser/Justin Pollard)\n\n1st Verse\n\nMile upon mile, got no direction\n\nWe're all playin' the same game\n\nWe're all lookin' for redemption\n\nJust afraid to say the name\n\nSo caught up now in pretending\n\nWhat we're seekin' is the truth\n\nI'm just lookin' for a happy ending\n\nAll I'm lookin' for is you\n\nChorus\n\n(And) (Yeah) it came upon me wave on wave\n\nYou're the reason I'm still here, yeah\n\nAm I the one you were sent to save\n\nAnd it came upon me wave on wave\n\n(Wave on wave, wave on wave)\n\n2nd Verse\n\nI wandered out into the water\n\nAnd I thought that I might drown\n\nI don't know what I was after\n\nJust know I was goin' down\n\nThat's when she found me\n\nNot afraid anymore\n\nShe said, 'You know, I always had you, baby\n\nJust waitin' for you to find what you were lookin' for'\n\n(Repeat Chorus Twice)\n\nTag Chorus\n\nThe clouds broke, and the angels cried\n\nYou ain't gonna walk alone\n\nThat's why they put me in your way\n\nAnd it came upon me wave on wave\n\n(Chorus Out)\n\n<< Back |
