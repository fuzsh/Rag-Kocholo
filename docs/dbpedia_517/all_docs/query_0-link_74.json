        "text": "When Pat Green released his major label debut album Three Days in 2001, it introduced the singer-songwriter to a national audience, with its follow-up, 2003's Wave on Wave, raising his profile even higher via the hit title track. But in his native Texas, Green was already a star, adored by a dedicated fan base built by playing the dancehall circuit and respected by fellow musicians. Now, some of the artists he influenced are saluting the Lone Star State hero on Dancehall Dreamin': A Tribute to Pat Green.\n\nDue April 5th – Green's 46th birthday – the record features renditions of his songs from artists like Jack Ingram, Josh Abbott Band and Aaron Watson. Randy Rogers Band performs the title track to Green's essential Three Days, enlisting Radney Foster – who co-wrote the song about the grueling life of a touring musician with Green ­­– for an assist.
