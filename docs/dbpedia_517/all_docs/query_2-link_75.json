        "text": "Mitchell Starc player profile\n\nFirst there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and Starc will go down as one of the country's finest all-format bowlers.\n\nWhile Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18. Four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals and in 2023 added a further 16. By the end of the 2024 T20 World Cup he was the leading wicket-taker across all World Cups.\n\nHe has, at times, divided opinion as a Test bowler but his career numbers are also outstanding. He struggled to gain the consistent backing of the selectors early in his Test career and was often in one Test and out the next, but in 2015 he finally enjoyed a solid run of Test cricket until an ankle injury stopped him during the home summer. His career-best match haul of 11 for 94 came in the notable surroundings of Galle - albeit in an Australia defeat - and he claimed 22 wickets in four Tests during the 2017-18 Ashes.\n\nStarc only played once during the 2019 Ashes in England, but since then has once again been a regular in the line-up. When England toured down under in 2021-22, Starc produced some of his best form in the three matches where the series was decided and went on to claim the Allan Border Medal as Australia's male player of the year. He claimed his 300th Test wicket in in late 2022, against South Africa and during 2024 went past Dennis Lillee's tally of 355.\n\nAlso a powerful lower-order batter, Starc fell one short of a Test century in Mohali in 2013. He is married to Australia wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff\n\nMitchell Starc IPL factfile\n\n- As of 2024, Mitchell Starc was the costliest player procured at an IPL auction when Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) made a successful bid of INR 24.75 crore (US$ 2.98 million approx.) for him at the auction before the 2024 IPL.\n\n- One of the most sought-after players in T20 cricket, Starc had played only 27 matches across the first 15 editions of the IPL, with injuries, international commitments, and personal reasons kept keeping him away at various points.\n\n- In the two IPLs that Starc played before KKR got him for 2024, he took 14 and 20 wickets for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), in 2014 and 2015."
