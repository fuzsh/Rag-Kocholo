Can’t wait to see him perform again. I have seen him in a huge venue at the University of Texas and I much prefer this experience. I really felt the connection to his music and enjoyed the whole event!\n\nKansas City, MO@\n\nAmeristar Casino Hotel Kansas City\n\nBob\n\nAugust 8th 2024\n\nLove Pat Green. Wish he had played more than 13 songs. Have more than that on my golfing playlist from him! Crowd was into it……just wish that Pat was!…..off night???\n\nColorado Springs, CO@\n\nBoot Barn Hall\n\nBecki\n\nJuly 8th 2024\n\nCame in from Illinois to catch Pat Green at the infamous Luckenbach venue. Both were better than I could have hoped for. Love Pat's music💜\n\nFredericksburg, TX@\n\nLuckenbach Texas\n\nKelsey\n\nMarch 3rd 2024\n\nAs always, Pat Green put on a great show! Happy he returned to Edinburg/McAllen and hopefully he will be back soon. Such a great show!\n\nEdinburg, TX@\n\nBert Ogden Arena\n\nRebecca downey\n\nOctober 9th 2023\n\nIt was awesome. Surprised my wife by taking her there for her birthday..WAVE ON WAVE baby. Her favorite song.. she told me it was the best birthday gift she has ever gotton..👍\n\nBurkburnett, TX@\n\nFriendship Amphiteater\n\nirene\n\nAugust 21st 2023\n\nI thought Buda and Willies Joint did a great job with the layout of the festival and bringing in some good music! Unfortunately the sound system was struggling getting the mix right when Pat Green came on stage. The other bands sound was good. I believe this frustrated Pat and he showed it with his actions and words. This took away from his show. At times I thought he might have been too intoxicated to be on stage. We left early. Thanks again to all those that worked to put this evening together. The lighting was off too. It was shining in Pat's eyes and they were also shining in the audiences eyes. I suggest to work on that for next time.\n\nBuda, TX@\n\nBuda Amphitheater & City Park\n\nBobby\n\nJune 11th 2023\n\nThe Pat Green Concert at Barge 295 was spectacular. We were sitting at tables right in front of the stage, and Pat interacted with the audience all night. My daughter in law had painted a sunset scene over the ocean for my wife for Mother's day and gave it to her before the concert. Pat was nice enough to sign the painting right after he sang Wave on Wave! So we now have an original Wave on Wave painting by Lauren and signed by Pat. What a nice gesture. Wonderful Event Place. They need to book more events!\n\nSeabrook, TX@\n\nBARge295\n\nKimberly\n\nJanuary 29th 2023\n\nThe 1st half of the show was a shitshow but still entertaining. Pat found himself after the first hour and was able to perform much better.\n\nFort Worth, TX@\n\nBilly Bob's\n\nRobert\n\nDecember 2nd 2022\n\nI saw Pat when he played down in Seabrook at the outback/barge, 295 a couple weeks ago. Enjoyed it very much however a lot of people were cold. I don’t think anybody left because of the temperature. A great concert in a small environment with a lot of locals enjoying it ! Thanks!!\n\nHouston, TX@\n\nThe Rustic\n\nDena\n\nOctober 31st 2022\n\nOnly because of COVID, it's been a few years since I've listened to Pat live. As usual, he did not disappoint. His ability to engage and captivate the audience with his songs, personality and love of music and Texas has us fans coming back year after year after year.\n\nEnnis, TX@\n\nEnnis Autumn Daze Festival Grounds in Historic Downtown Ennis\n\nRhonda Guerra\n\nSeptember 21st 2022\n\nWhat a concert!! We never knew Pat was such a great entertainer, holy moly. He's been on our bucket list for years and he did not dissappoint!!!disappoint!!!! Well never forget this one for sure also, having Cory Morrow as well!! A fellow pipeline turned musician and entertainer. Yall had us pinned to the stage every second and we thank you guys so much!!!\n\nAnahuac, TX@\n\nAnahuac Area Chamber of Commerce\n\nAugust 29th 2022\n\nAll, three concerts were GREAT! AND we know this is the first event of this kind at the venue. But the overall promotion of this event was Horrible. And the actual layout had a LOT of opportunity. but over all we had a good time.. PAt was awesome as usual and so were the other 2...\n\nBuda, TX@\n\nBuda Amphitheater & City Park\n\nKBish\n\nJuly 4th 2022\n\nHave seen Pat Green over the decades, seen him through the great times and the bad. Last night was special, he gave it his all and without his ear piece in 90% of the time. Roadie went to put an ear piece on him and Pat told him \"do not need it I am on a roll\" and waved him off. It was a special night, thank Jerry Jeff would be proud!!!\n\nFredericksburg, TX@\n\nLuckenbach Texas\n\nBrian\n\nJuly 3rd 2022\n\nOne of the best venues for a local concert I've ever been too! We'll be back! Next time early for food too! Thanks Pat for a great show!!\n\nHouston, TX@\n\nThe Rustic\n\nKat\n\nFebruary 16th 2019\n\nSimply, OUTSTANDING! Great music that I have loved for a decade, or so. Great performer. Engages the audience, with great stories and music. I've been 'hooked' since Wave on Wave, 2003. ❤️\n\nAustin, TX@\n\nACL Live at The Moody Theater\n\nJustin\n\nDecember 8th 2018\n\nMy wife and I loved the show. Pat is a great entertainer the link between Guy Clark and Jerry Jeff Walker and today’s Texas music.\n\nCorpus Christi, TX@\n\nBrewster Street Ice House\n\nShannon\n\nOctober 22nd 2017\n\nI LOOOOVED it! Pat Green is my all time favorite and he was amazing. Casey Donahew was a first for me, but was NOT disappointed! I had a blast! ❤️\n\nShawnee, OK@\n\nFireLake Arena\n\nPatricia\n\nJanuary 15th 2016\n\nIt was awesome! Pat Green and the band put on a really fabulous show! He was totally engaging and funny. Entertaining. The band was so energized and into the show and the music. Great, great show.\n\nHouston, TX@\n\nStampede Houston\n\nJonathan\n\nMay 28th 2015\n\nPat Green is always a great show!!! however the venue *Wormy Dog * dropped the ball it was at least 90 degrees and no AC ..small venues want good bands you must be able to provide a quality environment. .get it together \"WD\" I heard numerous complaints at other bars after the show on venue.. PAT WAS GREAT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES! !! #PFG\n\nOklahoma City, OK@\n\nWormy Dog Saloon\n\nTanya\n\nOctober 7th 2014\n\nI'm a native Texan living in NOLA noe so it was AWESOME to have Pat Green here! He was very personable and really interacted with the crowd! It had been a long time since I've seen him, but it was the best time by far!\n\nNew Orleans, LA@\n\nCity Park Festival Grounds\n\nView More Fan Reviews\n\nBorn in San Antonio, Texas, Pat Green has firmly established himself as a Texas legend with his evocative blend of traditional and modern country music.
