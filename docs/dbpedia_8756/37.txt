The surname Horam was first found in Yorkshire where Orm was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. 1In Lancashire, the Pipe Rolls of 1169 list Orm de Hedoc. 2 Here, the family claim descent from the parish of Ormskirk. "Ormskirk is not found in the Domesday survey; but, according to very credible tradition, the parish belonged to Orm, the Saxon proprietor of Halton, who, driven from his possessions in Cheshire, established himself in Lancashire, and, by his marriage with Alice, daughter of Herveus, a Norman nobleman, ancestor of Theobald Walter, obtained large estates in this county. He was the founder, no doubt, of the church; the word kirk, with his own name, constituting the name of the parish." 3

Later in Derbyshire, Orum was listed in the Pipe Rolls of 1175 and later again, John Orm was found in the Subsidy Rolls of Worcestershire in 1275. In Suffolk, Augustin Orumme was found in the Subsidy Rolls for 1327. 2
