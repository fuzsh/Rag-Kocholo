Some services in England such as care homes, ambulances, GPs etc, are required to be registered.\n\nTheir role is to check whether hospitals, care homes, GPs, dentists, and care services delivered in your home are meeting national standards. They do this by monitoring, inspecting and regulating services and publishing what they find. Where they find poor care, they will use their powers to take action."
