We pride ourselves on great customer service and whether you are a member or a visitor we are always pleased to welcome you to our club.\n\nSet in the East Sussex countryside, our nine hole course carves its way through mature trees, wooded areas and over water, waiting to punish any wayward shots. From the first tee, a long par 3, each hole presents its own challenge, in particular the famous 7th hole is known among local golfers as ‘the water hole’.\n\nBack inside the clubhouse we have a comfortable bar and restaurant where you can unwind and relive the best shots of your round, serving homemade favourites from cakes and pies to a hearty full English breakfast.\n\nIf more practice is needed we have a fifteen bay, floodlit driving range with targets at varying lengths, so whether you are working on your short game or your driving we can accommodate. We also have a five hole short game practice area and a nine hole putting green.\n\nOur PGA club Professional Giles Velvick has over twenty years’ experience and is on hand to offer lessons using the latest technology and teaching methods or can advise on the best new equipment from our fully stocked Pro shop.\n\nWhatever it is you need from us our staff and members will be delighted to welcome you to Horam Park Golf Club."
