        "text": "The exodus of MPs from the Commons at the next general election has been swelled further with the news that Orpington Tory John Horam will step down.\n\nHoram has represented three parties in two Commons spells totalling more than 30 years and been a minister in both Labour and Conservative governments.\n\nThe 70-year-old, who was untouched by the Westminster expenses scandal, told his constituency association on Friday that he would not fight the Kent seat again.\n\nHis announcement brings the number of confirmed retirees to 108, with dozens more tipped to be vacating their seats by the time of the poll, due by next June.\n\nThe total, swelled by the ranks of MPs effectively forced out over expenses embarrassments, is already significantly higher than in recent years.\n\nCoupled with the effects of what is expected to be a notable vote swing towards the Conservatives, the Commons is likely to see one of its biggest-ever intakes of new faces.\n\nHoram retained the seat with a majority of almost 5,000 in 2005 and his successor as Tory candidate will benefit from boundary changes which favour the party.\n\n\"It has been a great honour and pleasure representing Orpington, but I will have done the job for 18 years by the next election,\" he was reported to have told the local association.\n\n\"It is time for someone else to take over.\"\n\nHe told his local newspaper, the News Shopper: \"It is an exciting period for the Conservatives but sometimes you have to think about your party and not yourself.\n\n\"It is a good time for someone new to represent the party in Orpington. It will seem strange watching the next general election and not actually taking part.\"\n\nHoram was first elected in 1970 as the Labour MP for Gateshead West before joining the breakaway SDP in 1981 and unsuccessfully fighting Labour in Newcastle upon Tyne Central in 1983.\n\nWhen he did return to the Commons nearly a decade later, it was as a Conservative MP for Orpington, the seat he has represented since the 1992 election.\n\nUnder John Major he also returned to frontbench politics, serving as junior health minister between 2005 and 2007, 26 years after being a junior transport minister in Jim Callaghan's Labour administration."
