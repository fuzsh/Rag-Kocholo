        "text": "Following more than two years of fundraising by the management committee a new 1km exercise path has been opened at Horam Recreation Ground.\n\nPhase 1 – the loop around the perimeter of the top field is now complete and has been officially opened by MP Nus Ghani.\n\nA large crowd came to witness the ribbon being cut ribbon being cut and try out the new facility. The pathway is 590m long and 2.5m wide and has an all-weather surface to enable it to be used all year round.\n\nThe project was funded with grants from Veolia, Horam Parish Council and Biffa Awards. Heathfield Road Runners ran the first lap followed by visitors walking, running, cycling and scooting. They were joined by a group of wheelchair users from Oaklands Nursing Home and even two penny farthings had a go. Fundraising continues for Phase 2, a pumptrack/BMX track and Phase 3 which is a continuation of the pathway. When this loop is complete then the figure of eight pathway will measure exactly 1 km.\n\nNusrat Ghani said: “I was delighted to attend the official opening of the Get Active Pathway and celebrate this new facility alongside Horam residents. Health, leisure and sport facilities play a key role in building resilience and wellbeing in our communities and this new, eco-friendly pathway will make the recreation grounds accessible to all users all year round, providing great opportunities to walkers, runners and mobility scooter users who struggle with the uneven and often muddy terrain of our countryside paths. This project is a fantastic result for Horam and I’m pleased to have supported its delivery.”\n\nMike Woodhouse, Chair of Trustees, said: “We’re so pleased to see Phase 1 of the GAP project complete. This enables our many visitors to use the recreation ground all year round for the first time. We’re very grateful for the funding from Veolia, Horam Parish Council and Biffa Awards to help us construct the pathway.”"
