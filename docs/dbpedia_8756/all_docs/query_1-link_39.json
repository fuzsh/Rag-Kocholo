[ [http://www.horam.com/index2.htm Bus routes] ] The erstwhile railway line is now the Cuckoo Trail footpath through the village.\n\nReligion\n\nThe village is served by the local church, Christ Church [ [http://www.christchurchhoram.org.uk/ Christ Church Horam] ] found in Horebeech Lane: the vicar is Revd Mark Redhouse. The small church in Vines Cross was dedicated to St James but is no longer in existence.\n\nEducation\n\nPrimary education is provided at Maynards Green Primary School. [ [http://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/educationandlearning/schools/primary/maynards8452074.htm Maynards Green Primary School] ] St Mary's School, Horam [ [http://www.escis.org.uk/Entry/View/St_MaryAPOSs_School_Horam/1617 St Mary's School] ] is a secondary day and residential special school, located at Maynards Green."
