Immediately adjacent to the rear of the house is a gravelled terrace, beyond which is a level area of grass, formerly a croquet lawn. The woodland lies along the western boundary and is made up of beech, oak and pine trees – it is a haven of wildlife including pheasant and deer.\n\nVerno is situated on the outskirts of Horam near Heathfield in East Sussex. The village has a church and a number of village shops and Heathfield and also Uckfield nearby offer a wider range of services.\n\nThe guide price is £995,000.
