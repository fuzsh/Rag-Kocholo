So off we headed!\n\nFirst a bit of history from here:\n\nMore than 50 years of brewing history comes to an end this week when a cider company finally severs its connection with Sussex.\n\nAbout two thirds of the workforce at Merrydown's plant in Horam, near Heathfield, will walk out for the final time early on Friday following the company's decision earlier this year [2004] to shut the site.\n\nProduction will stop for good, although the company will keep a small presence of office staff at the site until the end of February.\n\nMerrydown, which makes the Shloer soft fruit and Merrydown cider brands, has had a connection with the small East Sussex village since 1946.\n\nThe company was founded by friends Jack Ward and Ian Howie as an attempt to bring cider-making back home to England.\n\nThe first batch of Merrydown Vintage Cider was fermented from 450 gallons of apple juice and within a year the scale of production had outgrown Mr Ward's garage at his home in Rotherfield and the partners bought Horam Manor, with seven acres of land.\n\nMerrydown decided to close the plant because further investment could not be justified because of the small manufacturing capacity.\n\nThe company will now move its offices to Reigate, Surrey, where the Shloer team is based. Production will be moved to a number of sub-contractors.\n\nIt's stripped, very stripped, but still has enough to keep an explorer amused for a couple of hours, the light was really nice. Plus the access is a laugh!\n\nSo many unopened test bottles of Shloer!\n\nSorry for the amount of pics, I tried cutting it down but I couldn't! A few more pics(!) can be found here http://www.flickr.com/photos/mookie427/sets/72157625164657790\n\ncheers for looking!\n\nCheers guys, it's a nice relaxed wander once you're inside\n\nDidnt this place have an apple crusher outside and some fish in the pond?Loved the last shot too\n\nwe saw the millstone out one of the windows but it was sandwiched between the building and the heras fencing which had cars and stuff parked right by it - the actual site is right behind the still open wine shop and on a busy street so you have to pick the right moment to access it. Don't be put off by the amount of CCTV cameras mounted on the building at the front either, they don't seem to be doing much."
