Explanation: All population figures and depicted boundaries are based on output areas officially assigned to the 2022 built-up areas. Output areas often include some unbuilt parts. However, tabulated area figures refer to (typically smaller) actual built-up areas in order to present a more realistic population density. Some of the older population figures are approximate values.
