Horam is nestled on the outskirts of the local market town of Heathfield in the Wealden district of East Sussex and is perfectly placed to reach the surrounding villages of Herstmonceux, Burwash, Mayfield and Ninfield to name but a few. Each village offers something different in character, but even though small (sometimes only 1 road going through it), they tend to have all the amenities you will need without getting in your car from shops, Doctors surgeries, primary schools and some even have a 5 star restaurant, such at The Sundial in Herstmonceux, for which people travel miles to sample their excellent cuisine.

Most villages offer bus links to bigger towns and train stations, there are direct links to London Bridge from Buxted, Stonegate and Etchingham all taking approx. 1.5 hrs to reach central London. The larger towns for shopping and hospitals would be Eastbourne, Brighton, Tunbridge Wells and Hastings, which are all between a 40-50 min drive from the country villages. There are numerous primary and secondary schools to choose from both state and private in the area, many with outstanding Ofsted reports.

WHY WE LOVE HORAM - Leisure pursuits are in abundance with country walks for everyone following numerous footpaths and bridle ways or over the South Downs as well as horse riding, cycling, tennis and golf or for the water fanatics, the coastline is only a 40 minute drive away. With so much to do and enjoy, who wouldnâ€™t want to live in the country!
