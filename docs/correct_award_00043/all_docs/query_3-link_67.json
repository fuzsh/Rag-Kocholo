        "text": "I am interested in the device approach to biology that views biological systems as a system of devices, each with inputs and outputs using power supplies to implement an input-output relation that is well defined and reasonably robust. The device approach to biology is very similar to the approach that engineers take to a technological system that they have been asked to identify and control.\n\nThe device approach\n\nThe device approach was used by the English school of physiology before the word engineering was commonly used and is a most productive way to initiate investigation of biological systems, no matter how complex. The device approach emphasizes the goal. The goal is to understand enough detail to establish and control the device equation, but no more.\n\nExperiments (from macroscopic measurements of function to atomic scale measurements of structure) are focused on the goal. Preparations are chosen so they make it easy to discover the input-output relation and to learn to control it. Much of the progress of biology arises from the judicious and productive choice of preparations, whether microbial genetics, squid nerve fibers or the retina of the eye.\n\nThe device approach emphasizes the types of models that are most useful in dealing with biology and biological experiments: they must have well-defined inputs and outputs, which necessarily occur at different places; thus, spatially uniform models are inherently awkward, to say the least. The device approach emphasizes the need for power to maintain a well-defined, reasonably robust input-output relation. Models at equilibrium where no power is available are limited in their utility.\n\nPersonal history\n\nI have been interested in how physical things work as long as I can remember, and in how living things work nearly as long. It began from the day my father (a physician and then psychiatrist) showed me that was the best way to mold my interests to his approval.\n\nAt Harvard, John Edsall was my tutor. He did, in fact, tutor me, biweekly at first and then (nearly) weekly, nominally in biology, but really in the wisdom of science. John Edsall was the son of a Dean of Harvard Medical School, and was a fulcrum for the pivotal change from macroscopic to molecular biology at Harvard and elsewhere. He trained Bruce Alberts, David Eisenberg and Jared Diamond, among many other distinguished scientists.\n\nMy coursework was in physics, chemistry, applied mathematics and electrical engineering but, if my memory serves me correctly, not in biology. (I actually love evolutionary and descriptive biology as I love collecting classical CDs but those loves are hobbies more than anything else.) My undergraduate thesis solved the cable equation of physiology (i.e., the transmission line equations of engineering) with a Green’s function, reproducing in an elegant but useless way what I had learned from Morse and Feshbach about heat equations.\n\nI completed my graduate work, which was experimental, at University College London, where my department chairperson, Bernard Katz, was to win the Nobel Prize a few years later. Fortunately, the chairperson of physiology, Andrew Huxley — who also won the Nobel Prize with Alan Hodgkin in 1964 — had solved the cable equations the way I had. But he had done so much earlier and much more originally and insightfully than me. Huxley was happy to spend many hours teaching me, on the side, as if he didn’t have enough else to do. My experimental work measured the spread of current in crab muscle fibers over a range of frequencies, using impedance spectroscopy, as it is now named rather pretentiously.\n\nMy many decades of experimental work focused on analyzing the flow of current in muscle fibers and then the lens of the eye.\n\nI became a department chairperson at Rush Medical College in Chicago in 1976: The temptation of an endowed chair was enough to make a 34-year-old move from the perpetual spring of Brentwood (Los Angeles) to the recurrent vagaries of Midwestern weather. In the 1980s, I started thinking about the theoretical problem of describing ion movement through the water-filled tunnels of charge, or what we call ionic channels.\n\nThe ionic channel is where we still are. But gazing through this narrow hole has proven to be rather like looking through a keyhole in a door. The closer you get to it, the further you can see, even glimpsing the horizon (of knowledge) occasionally, even seeing a star or two, when all else seems dark."
