        "text": "Sir John Eccles is an icon of Australian science, but an attempt in later life to mix religion and science made him an outsider in the scientific community as it won him fans in the Catholic Church.\n\nIn 1963, along with British biophysicists Sir Alan Hodgkin and Sir Andrew Huxley, he won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their groundbreaking work on synapses and the electrical properties of neurons.\n\nThat same year, Eccles was named Australian of the Year.\n\nBut, as University of Sydney Honorary Associate Professor John Carmody once wrote: \"the nation appears to have forgotten [Eccles despite the fact] modern neuroscience is forever in his debt\".\n\nPart of the reason for the decline in his regard could stem from his latter-career work, in which he controversially attempted to marry his scientific prowess with his religious beliefs, and went in search of the soul.\n\n'We are spiritual beings'\n\nEccles was born in Melbourne and grew up in a Catholic household in south-western Victoria where he was home-schooled for much of his early life.\n\nHe was a student at Warrnambool High School, which now boasts a science wing named in his honour. He then studied medicine at the University of Melbourne.\n\nHis burgeoning scientific career took him around the world, and included stints in Oxford, Sydney, Dunedin, and Canberra's Australian National University, where he won his Nobel Prize.\n\nAfter departing ANU in 1966, Eccles headed to Chicago — according to the Australian Academy of Science, \"an important factor in Eccles' decision to leave Australia was his feeling of intellectual isolation, especially in relation to his increasing interests in philosophy and the mind-brain interaction\".\n\nFor a long time, Eccles had been fascinated by the notion of the self as separate to the physical brain, which was in part driven by his beliefs as a Catholic-raised theist.\n\nSenior lecturer at ANU's John Curtin School of Medical Research, Dr Andrew Bell, said Eccles would not hesitate to use the unscientific word \"soul\", which \"didn't quite endear him\" to the scientific community.\n\n\"He was a dualist — he thought there was both a mental realm and a physical realm. It's not a popular theory,\" Dr Bell said.\n\n\"He had a prime role for supreme beings and this is where it got together with his religious ideas. His religious basis was the foundation he tried to fit everything into.\n\n\"He was brought up a Catholic and maintained that throughout his life and he tried to reconcile that with the scientific knowledge of the time and try to get a theory of how the brain and the mind interacted.\"\n\nDr Bell said Eccles' attempts to mix religion and science marginalised him in the scientific community, but won him fans in the Catholic Church and invitations to the Vatican.\n\n'16th-century sort of thinking'\n\nProfessor Allan Hobson, a retired Harvard Medical School professor of psychiatry, attended some of Eccles' lectures while a student in the 1960s and was shocked to learn Eccles was \"a card-carrying Cartesian dualist\".\n\n\"He was going all around the world talking about The cerebellum as a neuronal machine, and I read that book and I was very impressed,\" Professor Hobson said.\n\n\"The guy was a great scientist.\n\n\"It was shocking to me to recognise he was a dualist. He thought the mind was one thing, and the brain was another, and so the soul and the mind are immaterial and they are floating around in the atmosphere … controlled by God.\n\nProfessor Hobson said Eccles had \"established his scientific reputation\" and \"after he got the Nobel Prize and all the professorships he wanted, he was free to play with ideas that really interested him\".\n\n\"He devised experiments in which he attempted to show the influence of religious belief on the brain and he couldn't find any evidence for it,\" Professor Hobson said.\n\n\"To his credit, he had the courage to publish that stuff. Most people wouldn't.\n\n\"I think people made the distinction between his religious beliefs, which were obviously foolish to most people, and his science, which was impeccable.\"\n\n'A gigantic figure'\n\nANU emeritus professor Stephen Redman was a PhD student at Monash University when he met Eccles.\n\n\"He bowled into my laboratory completely unannounced and introduced himself — I was a little bit overwhelmed and overawed,\" Dr Redman said.\n\nEccles invited Dr Redman to work with him in Chicago for six months, which was \"a bit disappointing to be frank because [Eccles] was so busy travelling\".\n\n\"When Eccles did come home and sit down and talk to me, he was terrific, I enjoyed it, but the interactions were limited.\n\n\"He was amazingly easy to chat to. By the time I got to know him, I think he was getting a little bit dogmatic, waving his finger at me and telling me how it was rather than arguing the case.\n\n\"But everyone that I spoke to that knew him from earlier days said what a wonderful person he was to engage with both in general and scientifically and how helpful he'd been. I thought he was enormously helpful.\"\n\nDr Redman said Eccles was already on his quest for the soul when he worked with him.\n\n\"His drive was always to try and set up hypotheses that were testable, experimentally. So in all of the meanderings he took to try and find the basis of mind and will, the hypotheses were always set up in such a way that they could be testable.\n\n\"That is you could do measurements in the brain to see if he was right or not. That's the honest scientific part, the part that's got nothing to do with his religious thought. I think until he was very old, he kept them pretty separate.\n\nDr Redman said older scientists remembered him and continued to be inspired by him, \"but I don't think young people doing neuroscience are reading Eccles\".\n\n\"His reputation, in my opinion, is not based on his attempt to get a neurophysiological basis of [the soul] — it's the solid hardcore stuff he got the Nobel Prize for that he'll be remembered for.\""
