Huxley had a lucid and elegant writing style that was forceful yet free of obscurity, requiring close attention to understand. He developed themes logically without digression in a style that was persuasive and useful for propaganda. His style combined intellectuality and intelligibility without being bare, and featured crisp sentences and condensed statements. Huxley could write seriously or sarcastically, with tones of mild disapproval or denunciation in a matter-of-fact or forceful style while never losing sight of his main idea.",
