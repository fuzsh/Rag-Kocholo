        "text": "Physiology is the study of normal function within living creatures. It is a sub-section of biology, covering a range of topics that include organs, anatomy, and biological compounds, among others.\n\nFrom ancient theories to molecular laboratory techniques, physiological research has shaped our understanding of the components of our body, how they communicate, and how they keep us alive.\n\nMerrian-Webster defines physiology as:\n\n“[A] branch of biology that deals with the functions and activities of life or of living matter (such as organs, tissues, or cells) and of the physical and chemical phenomena involved.”\n\nFast facts on physiology\n\nPhysiology can be considered a study of the functions and processes that create life.\n\nThe study of physiology can be traced back to at least 420 BC.\n\nThe study of physiology is split into many disciplines covering topics as different as exercise, evolution, and defense.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nThe study of physiology is, in a sense, the study of life. It asks questions about the internal workings of organisms and how they interact with the world around them.\n\nPhysiology tests how organs and systems within the body work, how they communicate, and how they combine their efforts to make conditions favorable for survival.\n\nHuman physiology, specifically, is often separated into subcategories; these topics cover a vast amount of information.\n\nResearchers in the field can focus on anything from microscopic organelles in cell physiology up to more wide-ranging topics, such as ecophysiology, which looks at whole organisms and how they adapt to environments.\n\nThe most relevant arm of physiological research to Medical News Today is applied human physiology; this field investigates biological systems at the level of the cell, organ, system, anatomy, organism, and everywhere in between.\n\nIn this article, we will visit some of the subsections of physiology, developing a brief overview of this huge subject. Firstly, we will run through a short history of physiology.\n\nThe study of physiology traces its roots back to ancient India and Egypt.\n\nAs a medical discipline, it goes back at least as far as the time of Hippocrates, the famous “father of medicine” – around 420 BC.\n\nHippocrates coined the theory of the four humors, stating that the body contains four distinct bodily fluids: black bile, phlegm, blood, and yellow bile. Any disturbance in their ratios, as the theory goes, causes ill health.\n\nClaudius Galenus (c.130-200 AD), also known as Galen, modified Hippocrates’ theory and was the first to use experimentation to derive information about the systems of the body. He is widely referred to as the founder of experimental physiology.\n\nIt was Jean Fernel (1497-1558), a French physician, who first introduced the term “physiology,” from Ancient Greek, meaning “study of nature, origins.”\n\nFernel was also the first to describe the spinal canal (the space in the spine where the spinal cord passes through). He has a crater on the moon named after him for his efforts – it is called Fernelius.\n\nAnother leap forward in physiological knowledge came with the publication of William Harvey’s book titled An Anatomical Dissertation Upon the Movement of the Heart and Blood in Animals in 1628.\n\nHarvey was the first to describe systemic circulation and blood’s journey through the brain and body, propelled by the heart.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, much medical practice was based on the four humors until well into the 1800s (bloodletting, for instance). In 1838, a shift in thought occurred when the cell theory of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann arrived on the scene, theorizing that the body was made up of tiny individual cells.\n\nFrom here on in, the field of physiology opened up, and progress was made quickly:\n\nJoseph Lister, 1858 – initially studied coagulation and inflammation following injury, he went on to discover and utilize lifesaving antiseptics.\n\nIvan Pavlov, 1891 – conditioned physiological responses in dogs.\n\nAugust Krogh, 1910 – won the Nobel Prize for discovering how blood flow is regulated in capillaries.\n\nAndrew Huxley and Alan Hodgkin, 1952 – discovered the ionic mechanism by which nerve impulses are transmitted.\n\nAndrew Huxley and Hugh Huxley, 1954 – made advances in the study of muscles with the discovery of sliding filaments in skeletal muscle.\n\nThe major systems covered in the study of human physiology are as follows:\n\nCirculatory system – including the heart, the blood vessels, properties of the blood, and how circulation works in sickness and health.\n\nDigestive/excretory system – charting the movement of solids from the mouth to the anus; this includes study of the spleen, liver, and pancreas, the conversion of food into fuel and its final exit from the body.\n\nEndocrine system – the study of endocrine hormones that carry signals throughout the organism, helping it to respond in concert. The principal endocrine glands – the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, pancreas, parathyroids, and gonads – are a major focus, but nearly all organs release endocrine hormones.\n\nImmune system – the body’s natural defense system is comprised of white blood cells, the thymus, and lymph systems. A complex array of receptors and molecules combine to protect the host from attacks by pathogens. Molecules such as antibodies and cytokines feature heavily.\n\nIntegumentary system – the skin, hair, nails, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands (secreting an oily or waxy substance).\n\nMusculoskeletal system – the skeleton and muscles, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. Bone marrow – where red blood cells are made – and how bones store calcium and phosphate are included.\n\nNervous system – the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system. Study of the nervous system includes research into the senses, memory, emotion, movement, and thought.\n\nRenal/urinary system – including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, this system removes water from the blood, produces urine, and carries away waste.\n\nReproductive system – consisting of the gonads and the sex organs. Study of this system also includes investigating the way a fetus is created and nurtured for 9 months.\n\nRespiratory system – consisting of the nose, nasopharynx, trachea, and lungs. This system brings in oxygen and expels carbon dioxide and water.\n\nThere are a great number of disciplines that use the word physiology in their title. Below are some examples:\n\nCell physiology – studying the way cells work and interact; cell physiology mostly concentrates on membrane transport and neuron transmission.\n\nSystems physiology – this focuses on the computational and mathematical modeling of complex biological systems. It tries to describe the way individual cells or components of a system converge to respond as a whole. They often investigate metabolic networks and cell signaling.\n\nEvolutionary physiology – studying the way systems, or parts of systems, have adapted and changed over multiple generations. Research topics cover a lot of ground including the role of behavior in evolution, sexual selection, and physiological changes in relation to geographic variation.\n\nDefense physiology – changes that occur as a reaction to a potential threat, such as preparation for the fight-or-flight response.\n\nExercise physiology – as the name suggests, this is the study of the physiology of physical exercise. This includes research into bioenergetics, biochemistry, cardiopulmonary function, biomechanics, hematology, skeletal muscle physiology, neuroendocrine function, and nervous system function.\n\nThe topics mentioned above are just a small selection of the available physiologies. The field of physiology is as essential as it is vast."
