        "text": "Robyn Williams: Have you ever wondered about the tremendous odds against your existence? The flukes that enabled your young would-be parents to meet, the chances that the one sperm out of millions would successfully unite with that one egg, the good fortune that brought a pregnancy in the age of good healthcare to baby you? Well, today The Science Show will tell the tale of sliding doors and how a poor young man from Coventry just happened to meet a bright young woman in Jamberoo, New South Wales, and give rise to one of the greatest family dynasties in the history of the known universe.\n\nHello from me, Robyn Williams, and we'll also hear from Professor Mark Howden of the IPCC about climate prospects in 2023. And from another young winner in the Bragg science writing competition.\n\nWell, the name of our spectacular scientific family is Huxley. So many stars; Aldous, Julian, and grandfather T. H. Huxley, Darwin's renowned 'bulldog'. But we kick off with the less famous brother Andrew, who modestly achieved and only (and I say this with a grin) 'only' became master of Trinity College in Cambridge, president of the Royal Society of London and got a Nobel Prize along with our own Jack Eccles in 1983, for showing how your nervous system works. Here I'm talking to Sir Andrew about the Huxley preoccupation with evolution:\n\nAndrew Huxley: These questions had been occupying quite a lot of space in Nature and also in the general press, and it seemed to me that the position was being misrepresented. I think it's fair to say that virtually all biologists accept the outlines of Darwin's evolutionary theory. In recent years, there's been enormous and fairly detailed confirmation of it, of things that were quite uncertain in Darwin's time, and really has been confirmed to a quite extraordinary degree.\n\nBut inevitably, as we know more, there are always problems at the frontier. The speed at which evolution happens and whether it happens smoothly for a long period, or whether a new species evolves fairly rapidly on a geological timescale and then stays unaltered until it becomes extinct after a few million years, these are interesting and important questions, but they're questions within the Darwinian framework. And they were being presented as if they were anti-Darwinian. This is just a total misrepresentation of what the real scientific position was. The public was being given the impression that recent science was turning against Darwin.\n\nRobyn Williams: There's representation in the press that it is a theory and therefore there is sufficient doubt amongst scientists. I haven't come across this doubt very much, except, as you say, on the frontier.\n\nAndrew Huxley: Well, in Britain there are one or two physical scientists who express doubts on whether natural selection is powerful enough to have produced the extremely complex systems that present-day living things are, but I think these are people who've never gone into it and probably haven't read the tremendous book that R. A. Fisher wrote in 1930, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, which shows how overwhelmingly powerful a process it is when it has times of the order of many millions of generations to operate in.\n\nRobyn Williams: Fred Hoyle and Wickramasinghe have said something like this, that the chances of life starting on Earth, given this primeval soup, are roughly the same as having a junkyard spontaneously forming a jumbo jet 747. Now, you refuted this, didn't you?\n\nAndrew Huxley: Well, in that book they make a calculation which appears to show that the chance against life having originated spontaneously on Earth is the number of one in a number with 40,000 noughts on it. But if you actually look at the page where they make this calculation, they leave out and they actually admit that they leave out an absolutely enormous factor. The calculation that they make is the chance that life originated at one specified point on the surface of the Earth at one specified time. Now, in comparison with the size of the oceans and the amount of time, 1,000 million years or something that were available, the idea of leaving out a factor of this kind is just…it'll be unbelievable if they hadn't done it.\n\nRobyn Williams: Sir Andrew Huxley on The Science Show way back. His more famous brother Aldous was a film writer and novelist.\n\nAldous Huxley: War, we are all agreed, is a catastrophe. And yet, for every 100 people who kill themselves in peacetime, only about 70 kill themselves in wartime. This fall in the suicide rate was observed during the Franco-Prussian war and again more markedly during the World War. The Barbarian and the unconscious sadist are strong within us, so strong that even in peacetime newspaper proprietors find it worthwhile to devote a large proportion of their space to the description of crime. In wartime, half of every morning's paper deals with slaughter, and most of the rest consists of incitements to hatred on the one hand, and to group solidarity on the other. Provided with such rich spiritual sustenance, the would-be suicide postpones self-murder to a duller moment. It is boredom that makes the emotional orgies of group feeling, vanity and hatred seem so delightful. Abolish boredom and you abolish one of the main psychological reasons for nationalism and so, indirectly, for war.\n\nRobyn Williams: Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World. The third brother was Julian Huxley, who set up UNESCO, trained David Attenborough and won an Oscar for his natural history films and the Kalinga Prize for communicating science.\n\nJulian Huxley: The progress controversy has now been settled in principle, between the pros and the cons. The cons have been beaten on the basic issue; we now know that progress does occur. But on a secondary issue, the pros, or at least the most violent section among them, have also been beaten. Progress exists, yes, but it is neither universal nor unlimited, nor in any given case inevitable.\n\nRobyn Williams: Yes, a preoccupation with progress, and doubts about it. Julian Huxley, who helped shape the 20th century. But now this week a new book telling the Huxley tale is launched in Australia. It's by Alison Bashford and called An Intimate History of Evolution: The Story of the Huxley Family. It was recommended as a book of the year by Economist magazine.\n\nTake us back to TH Huxley, Darwin's 'bulldog'. I always vaguely thought because the Huxleys are such an amazingly famous big family, you imagine that he was one of many who just came up and it was his turn to be special. In fact, he was almost a self-made man, grew up in Coventry. How did he come to be so brilliant?\n\nAlison Bashford: He was the original self-made man. And everybody thinks because he's so connected to Charles Darwin that he came from that semi-aristocratic upper-class sector that Darwin certainly did as a gentleman, but the wonderful thing about Thomas Henry Huxley is that he came from a very humble and socially declining, troubled family. Not much money, father a school teacher at a not especially impressive school in London. When everything declined in the 1830s, he picked up his family, went to Coventry, ran a savings bank in Coventry.\n\nAnd poor old Thomas Henry Huxley, the youngest of a large family, was turfed out at 13 to become a medical apprentice, which he hated from beginning to end. And so on the streets of Coventry and then in the miserable docklands and East End of Dickens's 1830s and '40s, Thomas Henry Huxley had to work miserably by day dispensing, doing surgery and dissections that he never wanted to do. And being a medical apprentice in the 1830s and '40s was by no means an impressive thing to do, it was tough work, miserable work by his own accounts.\n\nRobyn Williams: Did he become a doctor, a real one?\n\nAlison Bashford: He did become a doctor. He eventually borrowed some money from a brother and did a degree and did quite well because he was very smart. But this is the original man of science, not bestowed learning or status, but absolutely pulling himself up by his bootstraps. And he worked extremely hard as a teenager. You know, this is someone at 13 who's a medical apprentice.\n\nRobyn Williams: And tell me, how did he come to be on the good ship Rattlesnake?\n\nAlison Bashford: Well, he dispensed by day and by night he lit the candles in London and he learned everything. He taught himself German, ancient Greek, philosophy, natural theology, read Erasmus Darwin (Darwin hadn't published anything on it at that point). He taught himself science actually. And once he finished his work as an apprentice, he quickly had to find himself a paying job and he entered the Royal Navy, and as assistant surgeon he found himself on the beautifully named ship, the Rattlesnake.\n\nRobyn Williams: And that sailed here to Australia. And where we're sitting is not terribly far from the south coast of New South Wales, a town called Jamberoo, not terribly far away from Wollongong really, and there was Henrietta. Tell me about Henrietta and Thomas Henry Huxley.\n\nAlison Bashford: That's right. And so there's a very important Australian connection that they never forgot about actually and the family doesn't forget about now either. So Thomas Henry Huxley sailed on the Rattlesnake in the mid-1840s to Sydney which was the base for the Rattlesnake's cruises up and down the coast to do scientific work. And he met at a ball young Henrietta Heathorn, who was here from a lower-middling class family, father ran a pub essentially, he also did timber work in then very remote Jamberoo, south of Sydney, inland of Wollongong.\n\nBut she moved to Newtown in Sydney, and at a ball met Thomas Henry Huxley, who hated socialising, but they fell in love at first sight. The love letters between them are anguished because they're separated immediately for various reasons. But these two, Henrietta, who has learned in German actually, probably more fluent than him, and she actually ended up doing quite a lot of his…or helping him with the translations of extremely important German evolutionary work later.\n\nBut they fell in love, but in good Malthusian style, Thomas Henry Huxley would not marry her until he was financially able to do so. So he returned to London. This in-love young couple was separated for five years while he tried to establish himself, get enough money to honourably marry her. That didn't happen for five years. And finally, she was brought in 1850, sailed back to London, where they were married, and between them established this dynasty, with Nobel laureates to boot, Aldous Huxley the famous novelist, and Julian Huxley, one of the more famous grandsons,\n\nRobyn Williams: One of those you mentioned just now is one of the least known whom I've actually interviewed and that's Andrew Huxley, who was master of Trinity College Cambridge, got the Nobel Prize, was president of the Royal Society of London. But compared to all the other names you mentioned, and which we can mention more of, all have come from that relationship that could have foundered, could have been separated, could have not happened at any stage.\n\nAlison Bashford: I know, isn't that a strange…you know, to be horribly late 20th century about it, it's a Sliding Door moment, cast back to a time when there were no sliding doors. No but it's absolutely the case. And, you know, Henrietta and Thomas Henry Huxley, there's wonderful correspondence between them, this is a wonderful, long-lasting love story. He died in Eastbourne not an old man but an extremely distinguished man, who, from that very humble background, became also a president of the Royal Society, and changed so many things about how the public understands science, how the public understands evolutionary ideas. It's absolutely the case that he argued evolutionary theory on behalf of his extremely good but quite humble and shy friend Charles Darwin. You know, 20th century and 19th century science would look very different without him and without the dynasty that he bore with Henrietta\n\nRobyn Williams: From Jamberoo, yes. And from Jamberoo let's leap to Oxford and the museum, which is still there, the Natural History Museum, and if you go upstairs, there's the room, as I remember, where that famous interaction between T. H. Huxley and the Bishop of Oxford took place. Where T.H., the 'bulldog' on behalf of Darwin, won the day famously in history.\n\nAlison Bashford: He absolutely won that day, and he won many more. And the wonderful thing I have to say as a historian and a writer about Thomas Henry Huxley, in this book An Intimate History of Evolution, was that Thomas Henry Huxley's character just booms out of the records. This was not a shy, retiring man, he was loud, he loved to fight, he was learned in the fights, and he won them. And so that was just one instance of him coming up against orthodoxies and coming up against the people who thought they knew and who received their position by inheritance, say, and he was someone who, because of his humble background, had absolutely driven by the idea that scientific merit was to be earned by good experimentation, by careful learning, by wide reading, not devolved onto people in an Oxbridge style by a kind of an inheritance model, but as a writer and as a historian he was the original larger-than-life scientific character.\n\nRobyn Williams: Your book, as you say, is about the family in it's intimate, and some of the characters there we have to leap because a proper conversation about the family would take about two days, however let's leap to the grandsons. Aldous Huxley you've mentioned who is of course the famous writer, Brave New World, went to Hollywood, wrote a number of movies and so on. But then Julian, who's much more in the kind of tradition of T. H., and actually of many of my colleagues in science broadcasting communication, he pioneered so much of that. How did he manage to become such a public person rather than a straight old retiring academic?\n\nAlison Bashford: Yes, he also didn't have the personality to be a retiring academic, although, you know, not all academics are that dull. But Julian Huxley, what he inherited from his grandfather, and Julian and Aldous were very close brothers, they were very beloved of one another, it's very intimate…it's part of the intimacy that I'm quite interested in exploring in this book. But Julian Huxley was the man of science, Aldous Huxley his brother was the man of letters.\n\nBut the thing about Julian Huxley is that temperamentally he was not that good at lab biology, he couldn't quite see it through. He just was one of those people who was interested in the sparky idea, and if it was a 180-degrees turn to the next sparky idea, he'd go there. So there was a kind of a way in which, although he was classically schooled, unlike his grandfather, learns biology when evolutionary theory is default by that point in the early 20th century, he didn't kind of stick at that academic world, he didn't quite have the rigour for it. But what he did have was a very special, in my view, capacity, like his grandfather, to take highly complex biological ideas in the first instance, but also moving into some physics and cosmology, and explain them to the world simply, well, with great care. And so he did that first in writing, but he moved into broadcasting. And so there are wonderful BBC broadcasts where he's explaining, you know, in the 1920s and '30s, all the remarkable things that are going on in experimental physiology, in population genetics, and little known actually are his dozens of early natural history films.\n\nRobyn Williams: He worked with David Attenborough and gave David Attenborough his chance, didn't he?\n\nAlison Bashford: He did. And so this is something that happily I've had some correspondence with David Attenborough about, and it so happens that Attenborough's very first production, Attenborough was behind the camera producing and directing and Julian Huxley was in front of the camera narrating, occupying the position that we're all now so familiar with Attenborough himself occupying. So in fact Julian Huxley is an early entree for Attenborough.\n\nBut I do see Julian Huxley's, you know, quite short, they're often five to ten minutes, some are directed to schools, natural history films, some of which are available on YouTube, one of which actually won an Oscar in the mid-1930s, these are all precursors to Attenborough-style and BBC-style natural history film productions. So they're very important. You know, they're about things like the worm or a lot of birds. Julian's biological and zoological love affair from beginning to end actually, is birds and bird ethology, bird behaviour. So there's a lot of bird films.\n\nThere's a lot of films there that are about the London Zoo. He was the director of the London Zoo in the '30s, into the war years. And I don't know if people remember but in fact, very, very early David Attenborough is a series about London Zoo animals. And in a way, that's a second rendition of something that Julian Huxley had…\n\nRobyn Williams: Zoo Quest.\n\nAlison Bashford: That's exactly right, but not that many people would be able to put a name to it. That is on the back of not solely Julian Huxley but an earlier generation of natural history filmmaking and science communication.\n\nRobyn Williams: I'm now going to ask you about culture. And to define culture I'm going to go leaping to Richard Dawkins from Oxford who wrote a book called The External Phenotype. In other words, you've got your internal phenotype which is your DNA which tells your body what to do when you become an egg and grow up. But the external part is our culture as we look around us, we've got the parks, we've got the houses, we've got the museums, we've got the roads, all the things which evolve separately from our bodies. And that's the kind of culture that took Julian Huxley, with those who invented UNESCO, the United Nation's Educational Science and Culture effort. How did he come to be selected for such an important job?\n\nAlison Bashford: Well, he was number two on the list, and was absolutely delighted, and I think he was an inspired choice. And so if we cast our minds back to think about a devastated Europe, a devastated world, an idea that science and culture needs to be represented in this new thing called the United Nations, people thinking of the Huxley family, in some ways was inspired, in other ways is what one would expect from the period, because this family was a family of several generations already of science communicators, which is to say they were writers, they were people who thought about science as something that needed to be put into words, into images, that needed to be disseminated to the world, that was extremely important. This is an era also immediately post-war when science needed to join to culture in order to explain to the world the significance of scientific work, and how the world in fact might be improved, how war may not happen again, they hoped, through scientific communication as well as through scientific endeavour. So he was a hugely inspired choice.\n\nRobyn Williams: Did he actually write the mission statement of UNESCO or part of it?\n\nAlison Bashford: He didn't write the mission and he got into trouble straightaway, he was always too quick off the mark, too quick actually temperamentally. And as soon as somebody gave him the job, before he'd even turned up in Paris, he wrote his own what he called manifesto for UNESCO. But that got him into deep trouble in the time because a whole committee had been at work for one or two years already writing the mission statement. And so that he just, off the bat and with his typical Huxley enthusiasm, wrote his separate manifesto, got him into trouble before he'd even stepped into the role.\n\nAnd in fact, he had a real agenda for both science and culture, because we have to remember, the Huxleys are a family of writers, they're actually a family of artists, painters, they're a family of novelists and poets. And interestingly (this is a world that is now bizarre to us) the card-carrying scientists in the family, including Thomas Henry and Julian, were poets themselves, they spent a long time writing poetry. So that separation that we now live with, as if science and culture are two worlds, as it was famously put, was an alien idea for them. This is what inspired Julian Huxley as the first director general of UNESCO, the UN Organisation for Education, Science and Culture.\n\nRobyn Williams: Alison Bashford on the Huxleys and evolution. But what about the darkness in human behaviour? The Putins, Stalins, Hitlers and wicked press barons? Aldous Huxley again:\n\nAldous Huxley: Eminent psychologists have often pointed out the danger we run in entrusting our destinies to men who may be suffering from mild or acute forms of neuroses, and who are psychologically so ignorant that they are quite unaware of the nature of their own motives. History shows that mad men and neurotics have been responsible for an enormous amount of mischief. The sooner we make a habit of psychoanalysing our politicians and our newspaper proprietors, the better.\n\nRobyn Williams: My final question is to look at putting the families together who had a tremendous view of the human race, as it was called, as being one thing. In other words, we're united in one humanity. It could have been with all sorts of humanities, over the Urals (as someone once put it) there could have been another lot, more like Neanderthals and who knows, it just so happens that we're all the same species. And knowing that, and knowing the kind of equality that both Thomas Henry Huxley and indeed Julian represented, how come the eugenics, in other words the selection of people in a way to foster the best and eliminate the worst?\n\nAlison Bashford: It's the big question of the Huxleys, Robyn, and so thank you for asking it, highly complex. It is absolutely the case that for all the bigotry (there's no denying it) that came out of Thomas Henry Huxley's mouth and out of his pen, the man did scientifically, philosophically and politically insist on one species of humans, of Homo sapiens. And this is an era when that wasn't necessarily the only scientific position to take. And he was a stickler for that idea, which in fact is a very important one, considering the options that were then on the table. And this idea of one humankind with multiple variations, in fact finds its way into 1920s and '30s population genetics, the work of R. A. Fisher actually another Australian connection, and many other population geneticists in the 1920s and '30s.\n\nWhere Huxley and his circle, including Fisher, including Haldane, are trying to think through how within this one species of humans do we think about variation, and what they inherited problematically was the 19th century idea of biological race. But Julian's generation in the 1920s and '30s showed, through population genetics, that that's a biological impossibility. And so the idea of biological race which haunted the 19th century, got seriously and knowledgeably undone by Huxley and his geneticist circles in the 1920s and '30s. And that then moved on to highly important statements on race, as it was put by UNESCO, where anthropologists and biologists got together and said, we can no longer either endorse politically or scientifically, biologically, this idea of biological variations across the one species of human.\n\nSo what's really interesting about this Huxley family is that over the many generations of the 19th and 20th centuries, this family of original zoologists end up being very important first anthropologists and then human scientists, but deeply political biologists and they were from beginning to end highly attuned to the significance of what biology and zoology means in everyday life, in a wider world of constant politics of how we think about human difference and human unity.\n\nAnd so one of the difficulties is that that was also the business of eugenics. I hope we have a lot longer to talk about this. But one of the interesting things about Julian Huxley is that although he (without doubt) was one of the early- to mid-20th century's foremost and most important anti-racists, that is to say he undid some of the biology of race that his grandfather had set up, said 'this doesn't work biologically, it doesn't work politically', so although he was an anti-racist, he was also president of the Eugenics Society. And he was president of the Eugenics Society in the 1950s, after the Holocaust, after Nazi eugenics.\n\nRobyn Williams: What sort of selection was he fostering then? What was he saying we should do eugenically to select better people?\n\nAlison Bashford: British eugenics primarily, although people understand it to be primarily about racial difference, in fact British eugenics was primarily about what we now call mental ill health, and his era had a whole other suite of names for it. But Julian Huxley's milieu in eugenics in that period were most interested in how do we improve human society by ridding future human populations of a range of mental and physical diseases and disabilities through selective population.\n\nRobyn Williams: Was he perhaps thinking of his own malady, terribly prone to depression and the 'black dog', and similarly other members of his family, not to mention his friend, Charles Darwin, you know, depressed?\n\nAlison Bashford: Yes, there's no question that the Huxley family did have a 'melancholy' as they would often put it, and that by Julian's era he well knew that it was inherited. And in fact in the 1950s he's quite involved in a new genetics, about inheritance of various kinds of diseases, especially schizophrenia. So the family well knew that it was passed on from one generation and so there's a real poignancy. Just that story alone is a poignant story, as with any family with inherited mental ill health, but the fascinating thing is that this terrible depression, paralysing depression that they had, there's no doubt about it, was both experienced intergenerationally by this family, but it was also something that without doubt fascinated them, as people who thought about evolution by natural selection, as a family who thought about genetics, and as a family that thought about and in fact led eugenics, and so it was on their mind in more ways than one."
