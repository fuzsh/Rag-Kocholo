        "text": "The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a mathematical model of current flow through ion-selective channels in neural membrane. Hodgkin and Huxley were able to describe the time behavior of the intracellular membrane potential and the currents through potassium (K) and sodium (Na) channels with simple first-order ordinary differential equations. This was done using parameters fitted from their voltage clamp Technique measurements on the giant axon of the squid. With this model, they quantitatively described the generation of action potentials by current injection and observable behavior such as the refractory period and the anode break phenomenon. With other sets of parameters, the Hodgkin-Huxley model has been used to describe many other types of voltage-dependent ion channels and has become a standard technique in compartmental modeling of neurons."
