        "text": "With a career spanning continents and decades, Huxley's works are literary classics. His novels show insightful takes on both his current reality, other realities and the future.\n\nAldous Huxley's Biography\n\nBorn into a famous intellectual family on 26 July 1894, Huxley showed a unique and curious outlook from a young age. These tendencies were strongly encouraged by his family. His grandfather was the famous evolutionary biologist, Thomas Henry Huxley, and his mother was the novelist Mrs Humphry Ward's sister. His brothers, Andrew and Julian, went on to achieve fame in the fields of physiology and biology.\n\nHis longtime friend Gerald Heard once said that Huxley’s background\n\n'brought down on him a weight of intellectual authority and a momentum of moral obligations.' - Gerald Heard 1\n\nHuxley studied at Eton and graduated from Oxford in 1916. He excelled there despite his partial blindness caused by a teenage case of keratitis. This blindness caused him to be exempt from military service in the war, but also meant that he couldn't follow his first career choice of science. Instead, he chose literature. His first book of poems The Burning Wheel (1916) was published shortly after his graduation.\n\nHe married the Belgian Maria Nys in 1919, and their son Matthew Huxley was born in 1920. Huxley spent much of his career in Italy and America, which influenced his novel’s views and themes.\n\nAn unusual academic, Huxley experimented with traditional and new hallucinogenic substances throughout his adult life. His experiences inspired the novel, The Doors of Perception (1954).\n\nHuxley's Cause of Death\n\nHuxley died of laryngeal cancer on 23 November 1963 in Los Angeles. Legend has it that Huxley went out on an LSD trip administered by his wife. Interestingly, Huxley died the same day as author C.S. Lewis and John F. Kennedy, though many did not know this until days later because of the media coverage of the assassination.\n\nJim Morrison is a 1960s counterculture icon. His band The Doors became famous after the release of their track, 'The End'. Their name was inspired by Huxley's novel The Doors of Perception, which in turn was inspired by William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1783).\n\nHuxley's The Doors of Perception preceded the popularity of LSD and mescaline that was a feature of the late 1960s Beat writers. In 1965, Jim Morrison of The Doors named his band after Huxley's book. The Beat writers and The Doors were considered progressive for their time and precursors to the psychedelic movement. What does that make Huxley?\n\nThe Beat Generation writers were considered part of the counterculture in the 1960s. The movement was characterised by non-linear plots and stream of consciousness writing. Famous writers include Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs.\n\nAldous Huxley’s Novels\n\nHuxley’s first novel, Chrome Yellow was written in 1921 and is a biting satire of English country house intellectuals. F. Scott Fitzgerald calls it\n\n'too ironic to be called satire and too scornful to be called irony.' - F. Scott Fitzgerald.2\n\nThese elements of satire and irony are threads that run through Huxley’s early work. The subject matter did shift from his known world of English academia to themes of global relevance, like the rise of the technocracy with Brave New World (1932). He also became interested in Buddism, which is reflected in some of his later novels, like the utopian counterpoint to Brave New World, Island (1963).\n\nBrave New World (1932)\n\nHuxley wrote Brave New World in less than 6 months. Considered a pioneering work of the Dystopian Science Fiction genre, it is a modern classic. It warns of a future where technology has created a situation in which the population is highly regulated from pre-birth until death.\n\nDystopian Science Fiction is a genre characterised by a pessimistic depiction of potential futures that usually feature technology and its influence on society. Other famous examples include George Orwell's 1984 (1949) and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1985).\n\nSet in AD 2540, or 632 ‘After Ford’, the novel continues the themes of satire seen in Huxley’s earlier work. ‘After Ford’ is a reference to the car manufacturer, Henry Ford, a pioneer of mass production. In Brave New World, Huxley depicts a future where science and technology have been harnessed to create an artificially harmonious and productive society.\n\nThe title of the novel references a phrase spoken by Miranda when she first meets the King of Naples and his men in Shakespeare’s The Tempest.\n\n'How beauteous mankind is, o brave new world, that has such people in it.'\n\nShakespearean allusions are the most common in the novel, creating a juxtaposition between Shakespearean morality and the recited maxims of Huxley’s dystopian future, where books are banned. This can be seen most clearly in the contrast between John the Savage’s worldview and the complacent hedonism of Lenina.\n\nFrom embryos at The Central Hatchery through early childhood, the citizens of the future are genetically modified and psychologically conditioned to behave in certain ways and to unquestioningly believe in certain things. With intelligence being determined at the embryonic phase, the conditioning takes care of segmenting the population into content labour-related castes named after the Greek alphabet.\n\nAdult Alphas, the most intelligent caste, would never want to be a Gamma, or less intelligent. No Gamma would ever want to be an Alpha, either. To achieve harmony, technology, science, and a happy drug called Soma are all applied to remove discontent, agency, and individuality from the population.\n\nKey themes are the loss of individuality, dystopia and totalitarianism, technology and control, mass consumption, mass production, and the price of permanent happiness.\n\nWould you prefer to live like Lenina and Bernard or like John? Neither? Why?\n\nIsland (1963)\n\nThis post-war novel is set on an island, of course. It is Huxley’s last novel and a utopian version of Brave New World. Although not his most famous work, Island is revolutionary for its time, as it combines Huxley’s interest in Eastern mythology with technology that is used for betterment.\n\nIsland settings for Utopian novels have a long literary history, dating back to Thomas More’s Utopia (1516), which is where the word was derived from. The word 'utopia' is from the Greek ou-topos which means 'no place' or alternatively, 'no where'. Thomas More used it as a pun in his novel Utopia, as it is pronounced almost precisely the same as eu-topos or 'a good place.'\n\nAs Gorman Beauchamp says,\n\n'Island distills the most important ideas that had engaged the polymathic Huxley for more than two decades on a capacious variety of subjects, ranging (as utopias are wont to do) from sex to science to education and religion. Here are reprised, for instance, his call for a humanized and \"appropriate\" technology'. - Gorman Beauchamp (1990) 3\n\nThe novel details Will Franaby's fake shipwreck on the island Pala. He is really there to spy on the inhabitants and assess their oil reserves. The neighbouring nations' interest in Pala is driven by greed and potentially a little envy.\n\nIn the novel, the people of Pala maintain their idyllic way of life by using freely available contraceptives, restricting the use of technology to medicine or food management, and limiting personal consumption.\n\nAfter Will is welcomed, taken on a tour, and given a psychedelic experience by the islanders, he can begin to see the benefits of their way of life. It is too late. The neighbours who sent Will to spy destroy the island and its people.\n\nThe novel was not well received and garnered more criticism than accolades. Why do you think this is? What are your views on technology and its uses today?\n\nWhy is Aldous Huxley important to literature?\n\nAldous Huxley was in many ways a visionary. Many of today's pressing ecological, technocratic, and societal debates were foreseen in his works of dystopian and utopian fiction.\n\nHe began raising the need to consider how technology and consumerism would impact future societies. He asked how these could be tempered, if at all.\n\nOther than raising relevant questions decades before they became current, he was an English academic who transgressed the world of English academia. His work and life spanned Europe, Beat counterculture, Hollywood, and mysticism. He demonstrated a sound understanding of science and technology. He was nominated for nine Nobel Prize Awards and actually awarded The Companion Of Literature in 1962.\n\nOften described as a polymath, Huxley is still a relevant author today, despite being most active between the 1930s and the 1960s.\n\nA polymath is a person who has a wide range of high-level skills and knowledge. A historic polymath is Leonardo Da Vinci. He excelled at sculpture, art, architecture, as well as biology and mathematics. On the side, he was an inventor. Elon Musk is considered by some to be a modern-day polymath.\n\nAldous Huxley - Key takeaways\n\nAldous Huxley made extensive use of satire and irony in almost all of his works.\n\nHe is mainly known as a novelist, but he also wrote screenplays, essays, and poetry.\n\nHis books Brave New World (1932) and Island (1963) are examples of Dystopian fiction and Utopian Fiction.\n\nBrave New World highlights themes of technocracy, individualism, and mass consumption.\n\nIsland is his last novel and combines ideas of Utopia, and limited technology with Eastern Mysticism.\n\n1.
