        "text": "Sir Alan Hodgkin (born February 5, 1914, Banbury, Oxfordshire, England—died December 20, 1998, Cambridge) was an English physiologist and biophysicist, who received (with Andrew Fielding Huxley and Sir John Eccles) the 1963 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the chemical processes responsible for the passage of impulses along individual nerve fibres.\n\nHodgkin was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. After conducting radar research (1939–45) for the British Air Ministry, he joined the faculty at Cambridge, where he worked (1945–52) with Huxley on measuring the electrical and chemical behaviour of individual nerve fibres. By inserting microelectrodes into the giant nerve fibres of the squid Loligo forbesi, they were able to show that the electrical potential of a fibre during conduction of an impulse exceeds the potential of the fibre at rest, contrary to the accepted theory, which postulated a breakdown of the nerve membrane during impulse conduction.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFaces of Science\n\nThey knew that the activity of a nerve fibre depends on the fact that a large concentration of potassium ions is maintained inside the fibre, while a large concentration of sodium ions is found in the surrounding solution. Their experimental results (1947) indicated that the nerve membrane allows only potassium to enter the fibre during the resting phase but allows sodium to penetrate when the fibre is excited. (See also action potential.)"
