        "text": "Hugh Esmor Huxley (born February 25, 1924, Birkenhead, Cheshire, England—died July 25, 2013, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, U.S.) was an English molecular biologist whose study (with Jean Hanson) of muscle ultrastructure using the techniques of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy led him to propose the sliding-filament theory of muscle contraction. An explanation for the conversion of chemical energy to mechanical energy on the molecular level, the theory states that two muscle proteins, actin and myosin, arranged in partially overlapping filaments, slide past each other through the activity of the energy-rich compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP), causing muscle contraction.\n\nHuxley worked on the development of radar equipment for the Royal Air Force (1943–47), for which he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1948. After completing his service, he returned to the University of Cambridge, where he had begun his studies in 1941, and received a B.A. (1948) and a Ph.D. (1952) in molecular biology. He then worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1952–54), Cambridge (1953–56), University College London (1956–61), and the Medical Research Council’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge (1962–87; deputy director 1979–87). In 1987 he joined the biology faculty at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, where he also served as director of the Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center (emeritus from 1997). During this time, Huxley continued to investigate the mechanics of muscular function using time-resolved low-angle X-ray diffraction.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFaces of Science"
