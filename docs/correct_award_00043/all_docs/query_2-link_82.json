Although it is a regional conference, I especially would like for folks interested in theoretical debates in X-Phi to apply. We will be posting travel info and accommodation information later, but rest assured that we encourage folks from any region to apply and that there are many options to fly or drive to MSU and stay at MSU that won’t break the bank. We hope that this will be a great venue to present and further X-Phi both in MS and within the philosophical community as a whole. Please consider submitting an abstract.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions,\n\nRobert"
