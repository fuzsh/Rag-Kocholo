        "text": "STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields are one of the most rapidly expanding and diverse areas in the world. The science in STEM typically includes the natural sciences: biology, physics, and chemistry, while mathematics appears as a standalone subject. The problems encountered in STEM are frequently complex and often not totally understood. Mathematical models provide a means to better understand the processes and unravel some of the complexities. This gives a natural synergistic relationship between the various STEM fields as research expands in the future. The mathematical tools provide ways for developing a better qualitative and quantitative understanding of some biological problems, while the STEM-related problems often stretch the techniques that mathematicians must use to find solutions."
