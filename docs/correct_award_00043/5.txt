Sir Andrew Huxley was one of the leading scientists of his era. An outstanding physiologist and biophysicist he, and his long-time collaborator Sir Alan Hodgkin (and the Australian biophysicist Sir John Eccles), won the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his studies of nerve action potentials, the electrical pulses that enable the activity of an organism to be co-ordinated by a central nervous system.

The nerve cells communicate with each other and give orders to muscles and glands in the body by brief electrical pulses â€” the pulse in a nerve fibre lasts for about a thousandth of a second.

The methods used by Huxley and Hodgkin were based on electronics. They recorded the electrical processes with microelectrodes, amplified them about a million
