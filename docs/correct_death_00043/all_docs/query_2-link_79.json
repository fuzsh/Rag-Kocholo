        "text": "Samuel George Davis Jr. (December 8, 1925 â€“ May 16, 1990) was an American singer, actor, comedian and dancer.\n\nQuick Facts Born, Died ...\n\nClose\n\nAt age two, Davis began his career in Vaudeville with his father Sammy Davis Sr. and the Will Mastin Trio, which toured nationally, and his film career began in 1933. After military service, Davis returned to the trio and became an overnight sensation following a nightclub performance at Ciro's (in West Hollywood) after the 1951 Academy Awards. With the trio, he became a recording artist. In 1954, at the age of 29, he lost his left eye in a car accident. Several years later, he converted to Judaism, finding commonalities between the oppression experienced both by black Americans and Jewish communities.[2] In 1958, he faced a backlash for his involvement with a white woman at a time when interracial relationships were taboo in the U.S. and where interracial marriage was not legalized nationwide until 1967.[3]\n\nDavis had a starring role on Broadway in Mr. Wonderful with Chita Rivera (1956). In 1960, he appeared in the Rat Pack film Ocean's 11. He returned to the stage in 1964 in a musical adaptation of Clifford Odets' Golden Boy. Davis was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance. The show featured the first interracial kiss on Broadway.[4] In 1966, he had his own TV variety show, titled The Sammy Davis Jr. Show. While Davis's career slowed in the late 1960s, his biggest hit, \"The Candy Man\", reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1972, and he became a star in Las Vegas, earning him the nickname \"Mister Show Business\".[5]\n\nDavis's popularity helped break the race barrier of the segregated entertainment industry.[6] He did, however, have a complex relationship with the black community and drew criticism after publicly supporting President Richard Nixon in 1972. One day on a golf course with Jack Benny, he was asked what his handicap was. \"Handicap?\" he asked. \"Talk about handicap. I'm a one-eyed Negro who's Jewish.\"[7][8] This was to become a signature comment, recounted in his autobiography and in many articles.[9]"
