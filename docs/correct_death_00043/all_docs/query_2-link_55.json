        "text": "Today in 1868,S. President Andrew Johnson was acquitted during the Senate impeachment, by one vote. His impeachment was unprecedented and stemmed from the various political disagreements over Reconstruction policy in the wake of the Civil War. In the end, 35 out of 54 senators voted to find Johnson guilty of “high crimes and misdemeanors” over his attempted dismissal of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, falling one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict; the trial ended 10 days later after two other articles of impeachment went down to defeat as well.\n\nToday in 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented. Douglas Fairbanks hosted the affair during which a total of twelve awards were given out. The entire presentation took five minutes. The movie \"Wings\" won \"best production\" while Emil Jannings and Janet Gaynor were named Best Actor and Best Actress.\n\nToday in 1939, a new plan was tested in Rochester, New York for providing food aid to 14,000 families. A number of foods were designated in surplus to be provided with the blue food stamps issued by the government in hopes that this would help distribute surplus foods to those in need during the Great Depression. The idea was that if the plan worked, it would become the New Deal Program.\n\nToday in 1988, a report released by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop declared that nicotine was addictive in similar ways as heroin and cocaine.\n\nToday in 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that police do not need a search warrant to search discarded garbage.\n\nToday in 1990, death claimed entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. in Los Angeles at the age of 64. That same day, \"Muppets\" creator Jim Henson died in New York at the age of 53.\n\nToday in 2000, veteran White House correspondent Helen Thomas resigned from United Press International, a day after the wire service was sold to the parent firm of “The Washington Times.”\n\nToday in 2013,it was revealed that Angelina Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.\n\nToday in 2017, the White House issued a furious denial after a report that President Donald Trump personally appealed to FBI Director James Comey to abandon the bureau’s investigation into National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nToday in 2018, Michigan State University agreed to pay $500-million in claims to 300 survivors of sexual abuse involving Larry Nassar. It was the largest sexual abuse case in sports history.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Ron Haviv/AFP via Getty Images)"
