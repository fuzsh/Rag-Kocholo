        "text": "BELOVED former Rat Pack member Sammy Davis Jr. died broke, in debt to the IRS, and left his estate in such a shambles that it still hasn’t been straightened out.\n\nAnd according to “Deconstructing Sammy” (due next month from Amistad/HarperCollins), by journalist Matt Birkbeck, Davis didn’t have to die.\n\nAfter a cancer diagnosis in August 1989, doctors recommended surgery on his throat that offered an 80 percent chance of survival. He opted instead for radiation, which had a slim 30 percent survival rate. Davis made his decision based on his dismal finances. If he couldn’t sing, he reasoned, he couldn’t make money.\n\nAmong the book’s other bombshells:\n\n* Following his divorce from May Britt in 1968, Davis was pressured into marrying a black woman. He wed Altovise Gore in 1970 and pressured her into participating in wild parties.\n\n* Among the many men Altovise befriended was former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, whom Davis met in the 1970s when Rumsfeld worked for the Nixon administration. Rumsfeld remained friendly with Altovise after the legendary entertainer’s death, even to the point of calling her when she was living in poverty in Pennsylvania in 1993.\n\n* When Sammy’s good friend and long-time conductor, George Rhodes, died in 1985, he asked another good friend, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, to give the eulogy. Jackson agreed but for a price: He demanded $5,000 in cash, four first-class plane tickets and two suites at the Four Seasons Hotel. Davis, who was broke, turned to bodyguard Brian Dellow, who took an advance off his credit card to pay Jackson’s fee.\n\n* Despite more than $50 million in lifetime earnings, Davis died in 1990 some $15 million in debt, owing more than half to the IRS for investments in bogus tax shelters."
