        "text": "One of my best friends died of throat cancer, at 64, in 1990. But it was only recently that his widow—his third wife, Altovise—granted me access to his belongings, kept for years in a nondescript Bekins warehouse in Carson, California. Once inside that musty storage room, I opened box after box with two cohorts of mine (film producers Robert Bloomingdale and Howard Burkons), and we discovered one of the greatest untapped photo archives in the history of entertainment.\n\nMy friend had begun taking pictures as a hobby in the late 1940s. He traveled the country shooting rural landscapes and urban street scenes in the style of Walker Evans. He chronicled life inside African-American clubs, homes, and hotels. Then, beginning in the 1950s, with intimate, unparalleled access to the offstage lives and late-night high jinks of the celebrities he met, he went on to record the glamour of Hollywood, the rise of Las Vegas, the allure of Miami Beach’s resorts and Broadway’s nightclub and theater scenes—from inside the stars’ private domains.\n\nHe was, it turned out, a sort of house photographer for the storied Rat Pack—shooting Dean Martin backstage, Peter Lawford in his bathrobe, Frank Sinatra in pajamas. On his contact sheets, Marilyn Monroe tucks a friend’s son into bed, Milton Berle does card tricks for Kirk Douglas, and Nat “King” Cole prowls the town. On faded transparencies, Red Buttons clowns by the pool, Tony Curtis sits before an easel, painting, and Mel Tormé and his family sprawl on the shag rug on Christmas morning.\n\nMy friend, I realized as I pored through his photos, was a Zelig with a Rolleiflex. He snapped unusual pairings: Rex Harrison with Martin Luther King Jr.; a young politician named Richard Nixon in Jerry Lewis’s Copacabana dressing room. He took pictures of Sidney Poitier during the 1963 March on Washington, Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe at a pro-Israel rally, parade-route revelers as he walked alongside Bobby Kennedy and his sister-in-law Jackie. Everywhere he went he recorded theater marquees and quiet still lifes. He also shot models and dancers and cigarette girls of every shape, size, and creed, in various states of undress, along with portraits of many of the starlets with whom he’d become romantically linked, among them Romy Schneider, Lola Falana, and Kim Novak.\n\nMy friend was named Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nAnd from the time I met him, in 1956, he was never without a camera. As revealed in a new book, Photo by Sammy Davis, Jr.— and in the previously unpublished images displayed on these pages—only a fraction of his archive has ever been seen, let alone appeared in print. Until now.\n\nDuring the 50s and 60s, watching Sammy perform in a nightclub or concert hall was the most exhilarating experience in American popular culture. Having started in vaudeville at age three (where he would routinely do six shows a day), he had learned how to gauge an audience by instinct and respond, minute by minute, to what he sensed the crowd was craving. He would dance, sing, tell jokes. He did impressions, played musical instruments, even threw in a few gun tricks. Sammy was one of those rare entertainers who do not have a set act. He would tell his musical director, George Rhodes, “I’ll open with . . .,” and he’d name two songs—different ones each night—and then he’d ad-lib for the next hour or more. And he did it all with a worldly bearing, hipster banter, a cigarette in his hand, and a lot of flash and body English.\n\nIt was during his Broadway days that my late wife, Jane, and I met him. He was opening in Mr. Wonderful, a show that Jule Styne had co-produced to showcase Sammy’s myriad talents. I was writing a daily syndicated newspaper column, and I phoned him up, as I did many stars who came to town, hoping to get a few items. He suggested dinner at Danny’s Hideaway, a steak house popular with comedians and other show-business types. That first evening, as our meal ended, he apologized for having to leave for the theater, but he said, “What about having dinner together”—he thought for a moment before continuing—“five nights a week?”\n\nWe had extraordinary chemistry from the first minute and, as luck would have it, we had dinner seven nights a week the entire year he was in town. It was the start of a friendship and collaboration that would result in two autobiographies, which we co-wrote, Yes I Can and Why Me?\n\nThrough it all, he snapped his pictures.\n\n“During the early 50s,” Sammy once told me, “Jerry [Lewis] gave me my first important camera, my first 35-mm. . . . and he hooked me. Then [in 1957] I met [fashion photographer] Milton [Greene, a confidant of Marilyn Monroe’s]. He got me involved with serious photography and using available light.”\n\nIn time, Sammy would have a cabinet running the length of a 25-foot wall in his Beverly Hills home. It was waist-high and had two shelves filled with Minoxes and Rolleis and stereoscopic cameras—the best and newest of every high-end model. “Of course, once I had a little education,” Sammy said, “I needed a new Nikon this and a Canon that, both with 18 lenses and 62 filters. In terms of addiction I think there is nothing more powerful than men’s toys. This may sound a little paranoid, but I am positive that somewhere in Germany, in Japan, there are men awake in the middle of the night, thinking, Now, Sammy Davis Jr. has an extra $50,000. Let’s think of something he doesn’t have. I’m positive of it, man.”\n\nWhen Sammy started taking pictures, as a teenage performer in the 40s, he used a Brownie and whatever inexpensive camera came his way. “We were in Florida and I was at the Beachcomber. [Singer] Steve Lawrence was down there. He was in the army, doing a show, and he came to the dressing room, and then we went to my hotel and hung out. He said, ‘Oh, you’ve got a Polaroid, the new Polaroid. I just got some stock in that. You ought to buy some, too.’\n\n“I said, ‘Stock? What stock?’ He said, ‘I bought it for two dollars a share.’ ‘Two dollars? For a piece of paper? . . . I got a Polaroid so I can take pictures of chicks’ boobs.’ ”\n\nObviously, the years—and Sammy’s adolescence—passed on, and he became a serious amateur. “The best pictures I ever took,” Sammy told me in the early 80s, “were in New York, during Mr. Wonderful. I’d walk the streets . . . get down to 42nd Street, walk up and down, and cats would be stumbling around, bums, and I had my Rollei around my neck, blue jeans, and a pea jacket, and just take pictures, and nobody’d notice you or bother you. . . . In the 40s they talked about war photographers. Well, a guy that does street photography today, he’s a war photographer. He really is. He’s out there with that 35 [-mm. camera]. Oughta get combat pay. Because when you see those gritty stories about the drug operations and this cat’s in there shooting, he’s taking his life in his hands. At any moment, cat’ll turn on him because his drugs tell him, ‘This motherfucker ain’t bein’ right. I don’t like the way he looks. Why the motherfuck he takin’ a picture of me? Wipe him!’\n\n“I carry a lot of my cameras on the road with me. I’ve gotten some of the greatest pictures from the penthouse suites of every important hotel all over the world . . . Paris, the Philippines, Australia. . . . The flip side of this popularity is I no longer have the privilege of walking the streets without attracting crowds, so being confined to the hotels, that’s where I shoot from.”\n\nSammy’s fascination with photography fit in with his persona. He was small of build (only five feet four), which allowed him to move easily in tight situations and, in a way, aggrandize the world around. He was a consummate voyeur (as evidenced by his parade of women friends) and chameleon (the best impressionist of his age)—traits that the finest photographers possess. He was a man around whom others felt comfortable, an attribute that made it easier to catch candid moments. He loved L.A., a land fixated on gadgets and screening rooms, and a virtual factory of American dreams rendered visually.\n\nHis pictures from the early 50s, of his life on the road with the Will Mastin Trio (a song-and-dance act that included Sammy Davis Sr.), are his most accomplished. His scenes of bleak desert towns and bustling big-city life are exquisitely composed. By day, he would explore inventive shadow play, human figures dwarfed by their environments, the clean lines of buildings that vanish, straight and true, into the horizon. By night, he would find Miró-like patterns amid the neon.\n\nHis pictures from the late 50s onward are remarkable less for their artistry than for their incomparable access—Jack Warner on his Hollywood back lot, Jack Benny and Bing Crosby on the golf course, dinner parties with Yul Brynner, Jack Lemmon, and Billy and Audrey Wilder. This stands to reason: 1954 was the year Sammy lost his left eye in a car crash (a life-changing experience that also prompted his conversion to Judaism). Even so, Joshua Greene, the photo archivist and son of photographer Milton Greene, contends, “It may sound rough, but having one eye was an advantage to Sammy as a photographer because it eliminated the peripheral vision and depth. With only one eye he saw as a camera lens sees.”\n\nSammy, in many ways, was an outsider, as many of the best photographers are. (I remember one nightclub routine in which he talked about his golfing prowess: “I’ve got a three handicap—black, one-eyed, Jewish.”) Truth be told, he sometimes used the camera as a security blanket—a way to place some distance between himself and the white world that was constantly branding him as uppity and unworthy, a stranger in their midst. In society’s eyes, he was an interloper who often dated white women and married out of his race (his second wife was the actress May Britt). He was rich, talented, and phenomenally successful—which further fueled resentment. Yet within the confines of his ever present camera, he could focus on whatever world he wanted to see or imagine.\n\nThrough it all, Sammy used photography as an extension of his artistic side. You can’t sing, dance, and tell jokes 24 hours a day. So, when he could, he’d take his camera to swank New York parties and Hollywood barbecues, TV soundstages and Vegas rehearsals, smoky nightclubs and dazzling movie sets. He often stood in the wings, focusing on the hubbub around him, as showgirls and singers came and went. He also took roll after roll of his wives and children. And when he wanted to get a sense of the goings-on outside his celebrity cocoon, he wandered the streets in his oversize peacoat and preserved whatever passed his way: an old woman sitting on a stoop in her Sunday finery; a drunk sleeping it off in front of a sign that read, FINE WINES. Then he’d share his creations with his friends, mailing dozens of 11-by-14 prints, often stamped: PHOTO BY SAMMY DAVIS JR.\n\nThere are countless stories that the pictures can’t capture. In 1960 the so-called Rat Pack stormed the Sands Hotel and Casino, in Las Vegas. Sammy was shooting the movie Ocean’s 11 by day, with Frank, Dean, Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop, and performing onstage every night. My wife, Jane, and I were living at the Sands, too, interviewing Sammy for his first book. One night, Senator John F. Kennedy interrupted his presidential campaign for a quick visit. Sammy introduced him from the stage, then we all went up to Frank’s suite for the late-night party. Along, too, came the gorgeous, friendly Copa Girls. (“Senator, we’re gonna miss our plane,” someone whispered. “It’ll wait,” said J.F.K.)\n\nAround four A.M., Peter beckoned Sammy from the next room and whispered, “Would you like to see what a million dollars looks like?” Hell, yes—we all did. Jane and I followed Sammy into a side room. Peter closed the door and opened a satchel he’d been guarding. It was filled with $100 bills—purportedly a gift from the casino owners for Senator Kennedy’s campaign. (How ironic it would seem, three years later, when Sinatra had his heart broken as President Kennedy, wary of the star’s Mob connections, rebuffed Sinatra’s overture to stay with him during a West Coast swing.)\n\nIn the early 80s, while beginning work on Sammy’s second book, Jane and I were living with him for a time at his home, in Beverly Hills. With a tape recorder going, we would sit in his sprawling living room, in deep armchairs that swiveled, as Sammy told tale after tale, perched on a stool behind the bar.\n\nDuring one interview session there was a rustling sound. Someone had come in the front door, which was never locked (there were always armed guards outside the gate). We looked up and there was Michael Jackson, in his 20s at the time. He waved and said, “Hi, Mr. D. Just going downstairs [to your archive].” Michael disappeared into a private office where there was a large-screen TV and a collection of tapes of Sammy’s nightclub and television appearances. In fact, in the early footage of Sammy from his days with the Will Mastin Trio—during which the performers had a brief eight minutes onstage to do or die—Sammy, as a breather between frenetic tap-dancing sequences, can be seen doing an early “moonwalk,” a generation before Michael would make it his trademark. That day, as his admirer headed downstairs, Sammy’s response was wonderfully warm: “Can there be anything more flattering than when the kids appreciate what you’ve done?”\n\nSammy Davis Jr.—though later criticized for his glitziness in the 70s, for adopting what others considered the ways of “the white world,” and for his unapologetic friendship with a disgraced Richard Nixon—was a pioneer in breaking barriers for black Americans. Long before there was a racial revolution, Sammy was marching alone through hotel lobbies and whites-only restaurants and clubs, blazing a path for other entertainers and setting an example for the nation at large. “Without Sammy Davis,” comedian-actress Whoopi Goldberg once told the BBC, “there would have been no us.” Observed comedian Arsenio Hall, “Before there was Michael, before there was Prince, before there was Eddie, there was Sammy.”\n\nOne of the most poignant of all my memories of Sammy involves a camera.\n\nOne night in New York in the late 50s, he insisted that I call ahead to El Morocco to let them know I was bringing him along for dinner. He was worried that, despite his fame, he might very well be turned away at the door of the nightclub. As I dialed the number, he picked up a camera and then, with an ear cocked toward my conversation, kept shooting pictures through the window of his penthouse suite at the Gorham Hotel. He was using the lens as a prop, keeping busy as he heard me having a heated conversation with the maître d’, who asked, “He’s very dark, isn’t he?”\n\nWhen I hung up, my face must have been blanched, because Sammy forced a smile, although it was clear that he was aching inside. “It’s O.K. to be white,” he said, to cut the tension, “but you’re overdoing it.”\n\nWe didn’t go to the club that night, and yet the evening wasn’t wasted. One of the pictures he shot through his window was eventually used as the cover of a record album.\n\nSammy’s camera, in the end, often served as a shield, a barrier to conversations he didn’t want to have with people he didn’t want to know. Nobody interrupts a man taking a picture to ask, “What’s that nigger doin’ in here?” To the white men and women who judged him, in a glance, the apparatus in front of his face helped block out the pain of rejection, even as it let him define, in a shutter click, the world that was defining him.\n\nBehind the camera, Sammy Davis Jr. always seemed to belong in the room . Even though he was at a remove, he was momentarily in control, omniscient, his world impregnable—if only through the viewfinder he held up to his eye.\n\nThis article is excerpted and expanded from Photo by Sammy Davis, Jr., by Burt Boyar, to be published this month by ReganBooks; © 2007 by the author."
