        "text": "Tributes to Sammy Davis Jr. abounded at Riviera's Le Bistro Theatre on Thursday as the master entertainer, who died of throat cancer in 1990 at age 64, was honored by the Las Vegas Walk of Stars. But one of the most moving tributes to Davis' impact was felt at the back of the room, where 86-year-old Gilbert Miller sat, largely unnoticed.\n\nMiller met Davis, who was then a member of the Will Mastin Trio, in Harlem in 1940. Miller was a member of a jazz outfit called the Three Chords, and the acts toured the vaudeville circuit for several years. But the Three Chords were never more than a support act, while Davis ascended to worldwide stardom. In 1960, Miller and Davis parted ways.\n\nThey finally reunited - sort of - more than 25 years later. By then, Miller had opened his own entertainment marketing agency in Los Angeles and Davis was long an international sensation. But one afternoon, as Miller drove along Sunset Boulevard, he stopped at a traffic light and a diminutive man standing on the corner shouted his name.\n\nMiller was stunned to see Sammy Davis Jr. waving at him.\n\n\"I got back to the office and told my secretary, 'You're not going to believe what just happened to me,' \" Miller recalled during Thursday's event honoring Davis. \"I hadn't talked to him in at least 25 years, hadn't seen him in that time, and he still remembered me.\" Davis' widow, Altovise Davis, made her way over to Miller during a lull in the two-hour ceremony and expressed her gratitude that Miller was able to attend.\n\n\"I was just floored when I got the invitation,\" said Miller, who today is in business in Las Vegas. \"Sammy was definitely one of a kind.\"\n\nNoteMart\n\nThe wide assortment of dignitaries, celebrities and family friends honoring Davis spoke to his vast circle of friends. Among those in the house were quick-fire comic/emcee Michael Colyar (formerly of Fitzgeralds and currently of the Eddie Murphy vehicle \"Norbit\"), Davis impressionist Louie Velez, one-time \"Wheel of Fortune\" letter-turner Susan Stafford (she held that gig prior to the arrival of Vanna White), veteran impressionist Fred Travalena, former Lt. Gov. (and one-time lounge singer) Lorraine Hunt, Trudy Campbell (she's the daughter-in-law of Glen Campbell, who sang the Lee Greenwood anthem, \"God Bless the USA\"), former heavyweight champion Ken Norton (walking unsteadily with the help of a cane), booming vocalist Johnny Ray Watson (who cut loose with \"Old Man River\"), former \"Beacher's Madhouse\" magician Mandre and Flamingo headliner George Wallace (sample: \"Las Vegas is the fastest-growing city in the country. That's because everyone who comes here loses their money and can't go home.\"). Clint Holmes, for years a friend of Davis, sang \"I've Gotta Be Me\" and said simply, \"Sammy Davis Jr. was the greatest entertainer who ever lived. Period.\" ...\n\nWhy the Riv? And yet, even more from the Davis ceremony: I asked Walk of Stars President Bob Alexander why the Riviera was chosen as the site for Davis' star dedication. He said, \"Because he performed here so many times.\" But as longtime Riviera PR man John Neeland reminded, Davis never headlined at the Riviera. After mulling that reality, Alexander explained that the Walk of Stars (which financed the $15,000 cost of Davis' star from its own fund) wanted to place the star on one of the few \"Old Vegas\" hotels still standing. The Riv certainly met that criterion - and was also willing to host the event. Alexander, who has bestowed 18 Stars so far (many of which have yet to be placed) said Bobby Darin will be the next star recipient, in May, and Evel Knievel will be honored in October at Caesars Palace. And it won't be the first time Knievel will see stars at Caesars ...\n\nNo Wayman: Sometimes when you say, \"Break a leg,\" it happens. Bass guitar star and former NBA performer Wayman Tisdale has joined the list of injured players (and in this case, former players) to miss NBA All-Star weekend. A broken leg has forced Tisdale to cancel his scheduled appearances tonight and Saturday at Boulder Station's Railhead ...\n\nThe last time I saw Marty Allen, he was soaked in sweat while trudging along a treadmill at Las Vegas Athletic Club. He'll be back in action onstage, with wife and partner, Karon Kate Blackwell, for an extended engagement at the Gold Coast. Details to be announced, but Marty (who turns 85) is said to be pretty fired up about the gig ...\n\nThe New York Post reports that Michael Jackson has been rejected in his attempt to nab a choice seat for Sunday's NBA All-Star Game. Jackson wanted to sit courtside with the likes of Jack Nicholson, Christina Aguilera, Jay-Z, Diddy, Nelly, Adam Sandler and a few trainers, but waited too long to call in the juice ...\n\nShe deserves a promotion: On Sunday, Flamingo headliner Toni Braxton is releasing a two-CD greatest-hits package titled \"The Essential Toni Braxton\" to coincide with her All-Star Game halftime performance ...\n\nPit boss: Remember the Takashi Murakami cherry sculpture prominently displayed at the entrance of the club Cherry at Red Rock Resort? It's gone. It has been taken away from the site by club personnel to be refurbished after sitting for nearly a year in a high-traffic area. No word on when it will be returned ...\n\nWhen Mirage headliner Danny Gans, scheduled to sing the national anthem prior to Sunday's All-Star Game, returned to the stage following rotator cuff surgery in January 2006, he cut his schedule from five to four shows per week to attend physical therapy sessions. Gans liked the off days so much, which are spent mostly with his family, he has maintained that schedule (he is dark Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays) for more than a year. Thus, he enjoys one of the more entertainer-friendly gigs in the city, while the Mirage is free to regularly book such established headliners as Ray Romano, Brad Garrett, David Spade and Jay Leno for Gans' off nights ...\n\nVegas moment: Spotted around 4 p.m. Tuesday as I waited to cross Main Street in front of the Attic, a genuine, fully operational 1958, 1959 or 1960 Ford Edsel ...\n\nSupreme being: The vanity plate 74CUTIE is on a Cutlass Supreme, which I'm fairly certain is a 1974 model ..."
