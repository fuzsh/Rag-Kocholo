        "text": "Altovise Davis passed away on Saturday (14Mar09) at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after suffering a stroke.\n\nDavis worked during the 1960s as a chorus-line dancer in various musical shows both in London and New York theatres.\n\nShe met Davis Jr. in 1967 while they were both working on Golden Boy on Broadway, and they wed in May 1970.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s Davis made several guest appearances in major U.S. TV series such as Charlie's Angels and CHiPs.\n\nThe couple adopted a son, Manny, and remained together until the Sammy Davis Jr. died of throat cancer in 1990 at the age of 64.\n\nAfter his death, his wife was left to sort through his multi-million dollar tax debt and oversee his troubled estate. Last year (08), she sued two former business partners in federal court, claiming they tricked her into signing away the rights to the estate. The suit is pending.\n\nDavis is survived by her son."
