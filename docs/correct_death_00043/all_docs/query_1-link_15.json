        "text": "American Entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr. had a career that spanned more than five decades. He started in Vaudeville and progressed to Broadway theatre, film and television and successful stints in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nSammy was born on December 8, 1925 in New York and was recognized throughout much of his career as \"the worldâs greatest entertainer.\"\n\nIn 1943, Davis joined the United States Army where he endured a constant battle with racism. He was constantly mistreated by white troops with whom he shared living quarters. Transferred to an entertainment regiment, Davis eventually found himself performing in front of these same soldiers.\n\nStained by the battle of racism, Mr. Davis used his fame and fortune to fight the evils of racism. He joined in many of the marches for freedom walking with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the other warriors of justice. He contributed endless hours of time and money to right the wrongs in our society.\n\nHe was married to Altovise for 20 years. He died of lung cancer in 1990."
