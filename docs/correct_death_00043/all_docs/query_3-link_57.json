        "text": "The official cause of death for Tracey Davis has not been declared\n\nSammy Davis Jr.’s daughter, Tracey Davis, has passed away at 59-years-old.\n\nThe mother and author died in Franklin, Tennessee on November 2 from a short illness. Her ex- husband, Guy Garner, confirmed her passing in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\n“She loved and adored her kids more than anything. Needless to say, they are all shocked and devastated by the loss of their mother, as are Tracey’s mother, May Britt Ringquist and her brothers, Mark and Jeff,” Garner stated.\n\nDavis, who was biracial, wrote two books about the Rat Pack entertainer’s life. The first titled, Sammy Davis Jr.: My Father, was released in 1996 and told the story about the thin relationship she had with her father as a child due to his career and her efforts to build a relationship with him as an adult. MGM had plans to make the book into a movie and a deal was announced last month.\n\n“I am thrilled to know my father’s life, both private and public, will be brought to the big screen with this team of storytellers,” Davis said at the time. “He and my mother May Britt took on the world, choosing love and compassion over hatred and bigotry, and I am a product of that decision.”\n\ntheGrio reported last month that Lena Waithe signed on to produce the film.\n\n“His story as a generational talent trying to make his way as a father, husband, and a Black man in America is one I have long wanted to help tell,” she said per Deadline. “I’m honored to be a part of this great team bringing such an important story to our community.”\n\nDavis wrote about her experiences as the daughter of one of the greatest entertainers ever, whose career kept them apart during her childhood years, in her 1996 book “Sammy Davis Jr.: My Father.” The book was about her journey to reconnect with her father later as an adult. It was co-written with Dolores A. Barclay, a former editor at the AP.\n\nShe wrote a second book, “Sammy Davis Jr.: A Personal Journey With My Father,” in 2014. In her books, she wrote about his experiences encountering racism throughout his career.\n\nMGM announced plans last month to develop a Sammy Davis Jr. biopic based on Davis’ first book.\n\n“I am thrilled to know my father’s life, both private and public, will be brought to the big screen with this team of storytellers,” Davis said in a statement when the deal was announced. “He and my mother May Britt took on the world, choosing love and compassion over hatred and bigotry, and I am a product of that decision.”\n\nDavis, who had a professional career in television and advertising, is survived by her four children, her mother and her brothers.\n\nHer official cause of death has not been declared."
