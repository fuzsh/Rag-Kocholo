        "text": "LOS ANGELES â€” Altovise Joanne Gore Davis, a dancer and actress and the widow of Sammy Davis Jr., has died. She was 65.\n\nDavis died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after suffering a stroke, said Amy Malone, a publicist for her family.\n\nDavis worked her way to the Broadway stage where she met the legendary entertainer when they performed together in the musical \"Golden Boy\" in 1967.\n\nShe became his third wife when they wed in 1970 (Davis was previously married to dancer Loray White and Swedish actress Mai Britt). They adopted a son and remained together until Davis died of throat cancer in 1990 at the age of 64.\n\nAfter his death she was left to sort through his multimillion IRS tax debt and oversee his troubled estate. Last year, she sued two former business partners in federal court, claiming they tricked her into signing away the rights to the estate. The suit is pending.\n\nDavis is survived by her son Manny.\n\nA private memorial service was being planned."
