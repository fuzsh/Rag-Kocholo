        "text": "Today we are wishing Dean Martin a very happy birthday on what would have been his 101st birthday. Martin was one of the most popular singers, actors, comedians and entertainers of the twentieth century with a career spanning over 5 decades. His musical hits include: “That’s Amore,” “Everybody Loves Somebody,” “Sway” and “Mambo Italiano” to name a few. He formed the immensely popular comedy duo “Martin and Lewis” with Jerry Lewis with Martin serving as the straight man to Lewis’ slapstick hijinks. Martin went on to become a star of concert stages, night clubs audio recordings, motion pictures and television and was also a member of the legendary “Rat Pack” alongside Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop.\n\nDean Martin, Marilyn Monroe and Jerry Lewis at the\n\nTaken from “The Marilyn Encyclopedia” by Adam Victor\n\n“Crooning lead Martin made his name in the 1950’s in a double act with Jerry Lewis, before going on to a solo career in the 1960’s that ranked him with fellow Rat Pack member Frank Sinatra. These films included “The Stooge” (1952), “Pardners” (1956), “Rio Bravo” (1959), “Kiss Me Stupid” and many more.\n\nMartin and Monroe almost worked together on “Some Came Running” (1958). After Marilyn moved back to Los Angeles in 1961, she saw a lot of Martin and his wife Jeanne.\n\nMartin became involved in “Something’s Got To Give” after Marilyn picked him; in some reports he had invested a personal stake in the production. Martin gallantly stood up for his friend after she was dismissed by Twentieth Century-Fox. The studio hired Lee Remick as Marilyn’s replacement, but Martin invoked a clause in his contract allowing him approval of his opposite number, and informed the studio that he would not work with anyone except Marilyn on this picture. Fox sued Martin, Martin sued Fox, and then the picture was put back on track, to no small degree because of Martin’s intransingence and support for Marilyn.”\n\nMonroe and Martin on the set of “Something’s Got To Give.”\n\nHappy birthday Dino!\n\nRemembering the late, great Sammy Davis Jr., who passed away on this date in 1990. Sammy Davis Jr was a popular singing star with a career spanning 7 decades. Some of his biggest hits include: “Candy Man,” “Mr Bojangles,” “Me And My Shadow” and “Something’s Gotta Give.” He also had a lengthy career in both film and television and was a member of the legendary “Rat Pack” alongside Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford.\n\nDavis Jr and Marilyn ran in the same circles and were photgraphed together mutiple times over the years.\n\nHe is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California."
