        "text": "Sammy Davis Jr was born on December 8th, 1925 and died on May 16th, 1990. He was known mostly for his entertainment career, and first and foremost a singer and dancer. His fame erupted after a performance following the 1951 academy awards, with the group he was part of called the Will Mastin Trio, which was composed of himself, his father, and Will Mastin. He continued his career on his own TV variety show, the Sammy Davis Jr Show, as well as many other notable roles in film and theatre.\n\nAs an African American, and a member of Judaism, Sammy was always in the crossfire of racism and prejudice. He was a huge supporter for the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the NAACP. In his career he also attained his credentials to be ordained as a minister. His legacy will live on as one of the greatest entertainers of all time."
