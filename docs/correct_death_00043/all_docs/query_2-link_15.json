        "text": "Sammy Davis Jnr was the complete entertainer. In an age of specialisation even in show business, the little black American was an outstanding night-club singer, comedian and dancer, and an able character actor when his enormous ego was under control.\n\nTrained in vaudeville, he was equally effective in Broadway musicals and in the new media of movies and television. When he wrote his autobiography in his forties, he had already lived a full show business life and justifiably summed up his all-round career with the title Yes, I Can. Sammy Davis Jnr was one Jack of all trades who was master of all.\n\nBorn in New York, he came from a theatrical family and claimed to have begun his career at the age of three, making a first appearance on stage with his father and his uncle. Certainly he was in a movie, Rufus Jones for President, in 1930 when he was five, and the same year he joined his family's Will Mastin Trio in a heavy schedule of singing, dancing and doing impressions in hotels and night clubs. By 17 he was a veteran hoofer.\n\nGrowing up in the years of rigid segregation, he was an active supporter of the civil rights movement in the '60s. Converting to Judaism, he offended many militant blacks by marrying the blonde Swedish actress, Mai Britt, in 1960, and met with a great deal of public racial hostility until their divorce eight years later. One Hollywood studio executive warned him his career would be ruined by the inter-racial marriage.\n\nThe experience seemed to drive him to the opposite extreme and he took up exclusively black causes with increasing fervency. 'Money doesn't make you free,' he said. 'Popularity doesn't make you free. Our real religion and the thing that connects us all is our blackness.' It therefore mystified many of his admirers when he supported Richard Nixon for president. He had made frequent star appearances in Las Vegas night clubs where organised crime is powerful, and a rumour soon spread that the Mafia, seeing more profit in a rightwing Nixon administration, had ordered him to campaign for Nixon or he would lose his profitable Vegas connections. Sammy, stung by heavy criticism from fellow blacks, insisted Nixon had promised he would help the black cause. 'There was a whole bunch of brothers and sisters that didn't like Jesus Christ,' he said defensively. 'There ain't nobody been put on this earth that everybody liked.'\n\nHis political blunder was a reflection of the deep insecurity that this little man with the glass eye (thanks to a childhood accident) had felt since his youth when he was forever being put down as ugly. This insecurity gave him his great drive and the perfectionism that made him master so many techniques and styles and media.\n\nHe had a wide-eyed enjoyment of his own fame. When he compiled Yes, I Can with the help of two professional writers, he even visited the printers to watch his words set up in type. He had a professional urge to see his work satisfactorily through every stage, but he was also full of wonderment at the thought of himself as a published author - the kid who had gone to work at an age when most people haven't even started school! He was a strange combination of seasoned Hollywood sophisticate with a tremendous will to succeed, and the eternal boy hoofer entertaining a world in which he didn't yet feel he belonged.\n\nHe had always handled his massive insecurity complex by boosting his ego with an audience's applause. Off-stage, he could be too dominating, as if constantly demanding reaasurance that he was not the ugly little fellow he saw himself as. It must have been a torture to him in the final months when he became too weak to perform and he knew he would never hear that applause again. Mr Wonderful, as Sammy the matchless professional was often called, was already dead then.\n\nWhat stays in the memory now is the final brief tap dance of the dying man into which he put all he had left and then beamed at the thunderous applause of his peers like a flower opening up beneath the sun. At that moment he appeared what he had thought was impossible - a most attractive figure. One hopes it was possible for him to see himself that way before he died."
