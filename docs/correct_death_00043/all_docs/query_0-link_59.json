        "text": "Founded in 1899, Hollywood Forever Cemetery is the final resting place to more of Hollywood’s founders and stars than anywhere else in the world. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Hollywood Forever is also featured in films such as LA Story and is renowned for hosting the outdoor Cinespia movie screenings. Visitors from all over the world come to pay their respects to Golden Age Hollywood legends such as Judy Garland, Cecil B. DeMille, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr; musicians like Chris Cornell, Scott Weiland, Dee Dee and Johnny Ramone; and hundreds more.\n\nVisitors can trace LA's history throughout Evergreen Memorial Park & Crematory, which was established in 1877 and is the city's oldest cemetery. Located in Boyle Heights, the 67-acre park is the final resting place for prominent Angelenos like Bridget \"Biddy\" Mason (founder of the First AME Church), John Strother Griffin (founder of East LA), Isaac Newton Van Nuys, Jotham Bixby (\"the father of Long Beach\"), George Albert Ralphs (founder of the supermarket chain), and several former LA mayors.\n\nAs a non-denominational cemetery, Evergreen is well-known for never banning African Americans from being buried there; Potter's Field, a nine-acre parcel devoted to Chinese Americans that dates to the Gold Rush; and a monument that honors the Japanese Americans of the 442nd Infantry Regimental Combat Team who fought in World War II - the unit was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by President Obama in 2010.\n\nForest Lawn Glendale has been a Southern California landmark since 1906. It has a world-renowned art museum, extraordinary statuary, and the Hall of the Crucifixion-Resurrection, home of two of the largest religious paintings in the western hemisphere. It’s also the final resting place for a Who's Who of entertainment royalty, including Michael Jackson, Walt Disney, Nat \"King\" Cole, Natalie Cole, Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Elizabeth Taylor, Spencer Tracy, Errol Flynn, George Burns, W.C. Fields, Sammy Davis Jr., Sam Cooke, Joan Rivers, Samuel Goldwyn and Sid Grauman."
