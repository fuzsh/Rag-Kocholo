        "text": "I was a pretty lucky kid. I remember growing up in the casino business where my father worked, and being surrounded by a lot of legendary people. From family gatherings with Frank Sinatra, to hanging out backstage with Sammy Davis Jr. at every one of his concerts, it was an exciting life for a freckled faced, innocent kid. I would come to meet the members of the Rat Pack purely by the company we kept. As a wide eyed teenager I got to know them fairly well; Dean Martin never really drank, Sammy Davis was more spiritual than you could imagine and Frank was always entertaining beautiful women. They were a part of my life growing up in the 60’s and 70’s in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.\n\nIt was fun for me to spend a decadent weekend reliving those old days on a recent trip to Palm Springs, California, where the Rat Pack owned weekend homes and lived the wild life away from the Vegas crowds.\n\nI checked into the sparkling new The Ritz-Carlton, Rancho Mirage perched high on top of a long winding road appropriately named Frank Sinatra Drive. The Ritz was long time coming in a desert filled with hipster hotels like The Parker and the former Viceroy Hotel. Wealthy guests were looking for a return to elegance and the Ritz-Carlton brings that back to the area.\n\nMy 1,700 square foot Presidential Suite overlooked the entire Coachella desert valley and was appropriately decorated with black and white images of Sinatra and old school Palm Springs celebutantes. The suite also included access to the brand new, secluded Club Lounge offering five beverage and culinary offerings throughout the day.\n\nMy goal for the weekend was to live the perfect Rat Pack Weekend in Palm Springs and having the Ritz-Carlton as my base was the perfect start. I would spend my early hours baking in the cliff-side infinity pool while being served the best Cadillac Margaritas in town. Later, I luxuriated in the hotel’s 25,000 square foot, two story spa enjoying the Rat Pack facial comprised of Diamond dust, followed by their decadent almost two hour Signature Spirit of the Mountains package, where the treatment rooms include private outdoor shower patios.\n\nWe ate that evening in the resorts romantic cliff-side Edge Restaurant overlooking the twinkling lights of the valley below. Waiters were attired in white dinner jackets, the dark lighting and delicious premium dry-aged bone-in meat steaks added to the ambiance.\n\nThe next day, following a morning of sunbathing poolside in a glamorous Ritz-Carlton cabana (complete with a butler bearing trays of fresh fruit), I ventured out to visit Frank Sinatra’s former compound which was used for entertaining guests, and is currently owned by Canadian billionaire Jim Pattison. The compound set on five acres at an elevation of 4,300 feet, has views of Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley and is currently listed for sale at $3.95 million.\n\nNamed Villa Maggio by Ole’ Blue Eyes in tribute to his character in “From Here to Eternity,” the hideaway is reached via a gated road or by the air. Its three houses include a total of eight bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and nine fireplaces. The grounds also come with a music studio that doubles as a pool house, two saunas, an outdoor dance floor and a helipad. The driveway and garages accommodate 24 cars.\n\nSinatra hired architect Ross Patton in 1967 to custom-design the retreat to focus on privacy and entertaining. The compound would become his personal sanctuary for a dozen years hosted everyone from Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor to Princess Grace. John F. Kennedy spent two days at Frank’s place in 1960, sleeping in a guest room of the main house. Frank had a plaque installed to honor the event. When JFK became President and decided to stay at Bing Crosby’s mountain estate instead of with Sinatra, Frank was so angry he converted to become a Republican.\n\nAccording to Nancy Sinatra, in the mid 50’s her father purchased a small house on Wonder Palms Road, adjacent to the 17th fairway of the new Tamarisk Country Club. The small one-story house had a stone entrance with two bedrooms, a living room, a tiny kitchen and a dining area, and an oval swimming pool opening up to the golf course. “Sometimes golfers actually walked in,” Nancy said, “One clown drove a golf cart into the pool.”\n\nOnce his fame really took off, Sinatra expanded the home to two and a half acres. Adding a privacy fence between his house and the golf course and a pair of two-bedroom cottages, on each end of the swimming pool. Each bathroom was equipped with Helene Curtis professional salon hair dryers. Sinatra expanded the main house with a dining room for 24 and a restaurant-size kitchen. This became the home of his dreams.\n\nFor the first time ever Howard Hughes estate has hit the market. Hughes was the third resident of the property and owned it until his death in 1976. The home’s original owner was actress Eva Gabor. Located near Bob Hope's estate, the 3 bedroom, 3 bath mid century modern home is listed for a modest $1.2 million and would be the perfect retreat for any fan of the era. (Listed by The Leonardo Group/HOM Sotheby’s International Realty)\n\nIn search of more Rat Pack memories, I visited the famed Vista Las Palmas neighborhood in Palm Springs homes of Sammy Davis Jr. (444 Chino Road), Dean Martin’s mid- century modern Alexander home (1123 Via Monte Vista) and neighbor Peter Lawford (1295 Via Monte Vista). The old Rat Pack hangouts are all closed—Don the Beachcomber, the Racquet Club, Sorrentino’s and Ruby’s Dunes. The only remaining Rat Pack hangout is at Melvyn’s Restaurant in Palm Springs and one of the highlights of the area. That night I was welcomed with open arms for dinner at my new favorite restaurant in Palm Springs.\n\nIf it wasn’t for the historic Ingleside Inn, there would be no Melvyn’s. The Inn was built in the 1920’s for the heirs of the Pierce Arrow Automobile Company and later sold to Palm Springs pioneer Ruth Hardy. She entertained everyone from Howard Hughes to Norman Vincent Peale. It was then purchased by dapper Brooklynite Melvyn Haber, white hair, dark tan and a radiant smile with perfectly tailored suits. He created the legendary restaurant while hosting numerous celebrities at the Inn. He is the perfect schmoozer and has become close friends to every famous face in the desert. John Travolta is a regular and was there a few days earlier.\n\nWhile a singer belted out Big Band classics at the adjacent piano lounge, I started out by ordering Sinatra’s favorite drink, a mix of four ice cubes, two fingers of Jack Daniel’s and a splash of water. I also ordered Steak Diane named after Sinatra, (although he often preferred Veal), the meal was lovingly prepared table side with Filet Mignon medallions covered in a red wine demi-glaze. I followed the meal with my Father’s favorite dessert Cherries Jubilee, the flames illuminating the romantic chandelier filled room.\n\nThe best part of the evening were the long conversations with longtime (40 years) Maitre’d Brian Ellis. Handsome, charming and full of great escapades, Brian regaled us with stories about the wild and crazy evenings at the restaurant and took us on a tour of the hidden basement wine cellar, not open to the public but used heavily in the past for dangerous liaisons.\n\nThe staff never really enjoyed when President’s would visit for dinner because the rest of the tables never turned. Everyone would nurse their drinks for hours in order to see the dignitaries leaving. Sinatra loved sitting at the bar in the rear of the piano lounge or dining with eight of his buddies in the main room and would often pop in just to hang out.\n\nThe next morning I drove back to Los Angeles with the memories of the old days flooding my mind. I was so excited to have the opportunity to relive a small part of the city and its illustrious past. Elegance certainly still exists in this legendary desert oasis."
