The 1911 pistol typically costs more than $350. The guns were turned in over the weekend for grocery gift cards. They included 364 handguns, 144 shotguns, 237 rifles, 42 assault-style weapons and four weapons that did not fit any specific category. Since its inception in 2009, the gun buyback program has collected more 15,000 weapons. The famed singer and entertainer, a member of the Rat Pack that helped put Las Vegas on the map in the 1960s, died of throat cancer in 1990.",
