        "text": "The bouncing black girl with beads in her hair, who has wowed them from Queens to Melbourne, the girl named Venus who plays out-of-this-world tennis, says she loves Oklahoma City.\n\nExcept for one thing.\n\nThe OKC Marriott, like most big-time hotels, doesn't have full cable. Which means the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, are having to survive this week's IGA Classic without Nickelodeon.\n\n\"The only thing I dislike, I can't watch 'The Wonder Years,' \" Venus said Thursday after reaching the IGA quarterfinals.\n\nBut why does she need to watch \"The Wonder Years?\" Venus Williams is living them.\n\nVenus is 17 years old, has the world by the tail and acts like she doesn't know it.\n\nShe and Serena have cackled their way all over Oklahoma City. From a shopping spree at Penn Square, to darting throughout The Greens Country Club, to answering the phones in the press room, to pushing a grocery cart full speed all over Snyder's IGA.\n\nWho said Venus is tennis' Tiger Woods?\n\nWhen did Tiger ever have this much fun? Tiger Woods has a great smile, a great swing and great poise. But sitting next to him on a flight to DFW would be borrrrrrrrrring.\n\nVenus Williams has a great smile, a great swing and great personality. Sitting next to her would be a hoot.\n\nPlus, she is Tiger squared - Serena doubles the fun. On a national teleconference call Thursday, prior to winning her second-round match, the 16-year-old Serena was asked her idea of a good time.\n\n\"Running the sweep, where I can have some fun,\" she said. \"Things that normal players don't usually do.\"\n\nHard to argue with that. Imagine Steffi Graf or Martina Hingis fulfilling a dream by playing out \"Supermarket Sweep,\" a cable-TV game show. Now imagine them enjoying it.\n\nBut Venus pushed the cart and Serena filled it with pickle jars and canned goods, $487 worth of edibles that went to the Oklahoma City Food Bank.\n\n\"We were so excited for two days,\" said Venus, definitely a product of the TV generation. \"It was so fun.\"\n\nThe Williamses refuse to play it by the book. During the Australian Open, they talked German Karsten Braasch, the 203rd-ranked man in the world, into an exhibition. Braasch beat Serena 6-1 and Venus 6-2.\n\nEven the poor souls who have had to play the Williamses this week are having a good time. Venus routed South Africa's Mariaan De Swardt 6-1, 6-3 Thursday, and after one vicious Venus serve, De Swardt put up her hands as if to protect herself.\n\nThe crowd laughed, Venus laughed, Serena laughed. This is a good-time bunch. Try to have this much fun in golf and you'll be whisked off the course in Casey Martin's cart.\n\nBut try as she might, Venus can't escape Tiger's shadow. Both were billed as revolutionaries, great black hopes transporting to the minority masses an exclusionary sport.\n\n\"To be honest, everyone asks me what I think of Tiger,\" Venus said. \"The only time I ever think about it is when you guys ask me.\n\n\"Other than that, I do my thing. Run my show. Practice. I don't think about revolutionizing the game. What's going to happen in five years.\"\n\nBut Venus knows she could change the game. She is 6-foot-1. She served 118 mph on Thursday. She runs, she jumps, she is powerful. If 13 years ago she had picked up a basketball instead of a tennis racket, she might be playing small forward for Tennessee.\n\nAnd she is marketable. Maybe as marketable as Tiger. Venus won $466,863 last year, her first on the tour, but her father said both his daughters already are millionaires. Venus signed with Reebok long ago; Serena signed with Puma last week. Endorsement offers come in almost daily.\n\n\"I and Serena are totally different players, totally different people from what the game has ever seen,\" Venus said. \"That in itself should do a lot.\"\n\nThey grew up in Compton, Calif., but in 1991 Richard Williams pulled his prodigies out of junior tennis competition and moved the family to Florida.\n\n\"If we're out there going to junior tournaments every weekend, it doesn't leave time for family,\" Richard said. \"Tennis has a tendency of tearing families apart. I wanted to show my kids what marriage is like.\"\n\nVenus, already a mythical figure even before she joined the tour, stunningly reached the finals of the U.S. Open last September. In January, she beat Hingis in an Australian Open warmup and Serena beat No. 2-ranked Lindsay Davenport. The genie was out of the bottle.\n\nThe Williamses travel with no entourage. It's Venus, Serena, Richard and mom Brandi. Business manager, agent, coach, it's all in the family.\n\n\"We're family oriented,\" Venus said. \"People didn't understand our goals.\"\n\nThat, she figures, explains some of the tiffs on tour. The Williamses have had run-ins with several players, including Davenport, who is on a semifinal collision course with Venus.\n\nVenus and Serena can be brash and cocky. Not cocky like an NBA player; cocky like a 17-year-old girl who makes millions of dollars and likes to play Supermarket Sweep.\n\nAnd next week, the Williamses will have checked out of the Marriott and be back in the land of Nickelodeon.\n\n\"The guy is so emotional,\" Venus said of Wonder Years character Kevin Arnold. \"He takes things to extreme. That's the way I am. I want to see if I can take it to extreme every day.\"\n\nThe sport of tennis might just jump into the back of the grocery cart and go along for the ride.
