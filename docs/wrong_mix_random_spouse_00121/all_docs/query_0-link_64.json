        "text": "Theophilus NORWOOD (1809 - aft. 1870) and Sally BROWN\n\npossibly my 4g-grandparents\n\nMatilda Caroline (NORWOOD) ALLEN was born about 1830 in AL, according to the 1850 thru 1900 US Censuses. The 1900 US Census pins it down to May 1830. The death certificate of her daughter says that Caroline NORWOOD and her husband, William ALLEN, were both born in Birmingham, AL. However, Birmingham was not formed until after the Civil War. So perhaps they were from the general area that became Birmingham. At any rate, they were both in Itawamba County, MS when they were married, in 1848.\n\nThe father of Matilda Caroline NORWOOD may have been Theophilus NORWOOD. He lived in Tuscaloosa County, AL in 1830 and 1840, and in Itawamba in 1850. The key piece of evidence is that the family of William and Caroline (NORWOOD) ALLEN was listed close to the family of Theophilus NORWOOD in the 1850 US Census for District 6, Itawamba County, MS. See below.\n\nThis Theophilus NORWOOD was born about 1809-10 in SC. His wife in 1850 and 1860 was Sarah, born about 1813 in TN.\n\nIt seems that there were several men named Theophilus NORWOOD, about the same age, living in the same area. So I will study the whole extended family, and see where she might fit in. The Theophilus described above will be called Theo1.\n\nNORWOODS in Early AL and MS\n\nThe 1820 US Census recorded 127,901 people in AL. These records for all but 8 counties (Baldwin, Conecuh, Dallas, Franklin, Limestone, St. Clair, Shelby, and Wilcox) have been lost [source], and none of the remaining ones contain any NORWOODs. Three NORWOOD households were in southern MS. I have not found a connection between these NORWOODs and ours.\n\nThe earliest records of NORWOODs in AL that I have found are two wills. The will of Washington NORWOOD was probated in 1825 in Greene County, AL. The associated documentation is extensive, but I did not see any mention of a Theophilus. The 1825 will of Francis D. SMITH does mention Theophilus NORWOOD, and is quoted below. It tells us that the father of Theophilus was Richard NORWOOD, deceased.\n\nThe 1830 US Census found 24 NORWOOD households in AL, including 2 headed by Theophilus NORWOODs.\n\nTheophilus NORWOOD was head of a household of 6 in Shelby County, AL. However, this Theophilus was in the 30-39 age group, thus born 1791-1800, too old to be Theo1. Let's call him Theo2.\n\nAnother Theophilus NORWOOD had a household of 12, which included 3 slaves, in Morgan County, AL. He was 40-49, born 1781-1790, also too old to be Theo1. Let's call him Theo3.\n\nThere was one T. NORWOOD household in Tuscaloosa County, a family of 3. The only male was 20-29, which matches our Theophilus, who would have been about 20 or 21. Tuscaloosa County shares its border with Jefferson County, in which the city of Birmingham was founded in 1871. I believe this is Theo1.\n\nThe 1850 US Census had 4 families of interest in Itawamba County, MS. I will argue, below, that Matilda ALLEN (family 310) and Mary Ann BELL (family 313) were daughters of Theophilus NORWOOD (family 338) and his first wife. Also, John ALLEN (316) is possibly a brother or William ALLEN (310).\n\nAs mentioned above, the proximity of Matilda (NORWOOD) ALLEN and Mary Ann (NORWOOD) BELL in this census suggests that they may be sisters, and not far away, Theophilus NORWOOD could be their father. Also, the family seems to fit the data from the 1830 and 1840 US Censuses, above. Finally, the ages and birth places show that the family was in AL from 1829 to 1844, and removed to MS by 1847. This Theophilus NORWOOD is the one I call Theo1.\n\nIt seems strange that family 338 has children Sarah F and Sarah S. In the original record, the 9-year-old looks more like Sarena, and later records indicate that she was Serena J.\n\nAnother T. NORWOOD family is found in the 1850 US Census, in Choctaw County, MS. Probably related. I am tempted to think that Theophilus and Sarah moved from Itawamba to Choctaw between 18 Sep 1850 and 12 Nov 1850, and were recorded in both censuses, but the birthdates and places and the names of the children are all different. However, our Theophilus and family are found in Choctaw County in 1860.\n\nThe 1860 US Census has several NORWOOD families in Township 21, Choctaw County, MS, including 2 Theophilus NORWOODs. They were listed close together, so their farms were probably close together as well. All had good-sized farms, so they were not poor, at the start of the Civil War.\n\nFamily 1599 was headed by Theo1. His wife Sarah and 6 children were at home.\n\nFamily 1609 was headed by John M. NORWOOD, born about 1784 in SC, the oldest member of the family found so far. He was probably the father or uncle of Theo1, Theo4, and David. Since he was not found earlier in MS, perhaps he came from SC to join his sons in the 1850s. His wife Sarena J is said to have been his cousin Sarena/Serena J. NORWOOD, daughter of Theo1, who appeared in the 1850 US Census, above. More discussion of this will appear in the section below, covering Serena.\n\nFamily 1611 was headed by David NORWOOD, born about 1809 in SC, so he could be a twin of Theo1. I have not found him in the 1850 US Census, but in the 1840 US Census he could be the David NORWOOD or D. M. NORWOOD in Tuscaloosa, AL.\n\nFamily 1638 was headed by Sarah, wife of Theo4. For some reason her husband appears in family 1610, headed by John L. NORWOOD, probably a son of Theo4. If so, John was recorded as 13 in 1850 and 28 in 1860, so there is some mistake.\n\nThree of these NORWOOD families owned a single slave each, in 1860.\n\nThe Will of Francis D. SMITH\n\nIn the name of God Amen.\n\nI, Francis D. Smith of County of Tuskaloosa State of Alabama, being sick and weak in body but of sound mind and memory, thanks be given unto God, Calling to mind the mortality of my body and knowing it is appointed for all men once to die do make and ordain this my last will and Testament that is to Say, Principally and first of all I give and Recommend my Soul into the hands of Almighty God that gave it and my body I Recommend to the Earth to be buried in decent Christian burial at the discretion of my Executors. Nothing doubting but at the General resurrection I shall receive the same again by the mighty power of God. And as touching such wou???aly Estate as it hath pleased god to bless me with in this life I give and devise and dispose of it in the following manner and form (viz)\n\nItem 1st I give and bequeath unto my beloved nephew Theophilus Norwood (son of Richard Norwood decd) One hundred Dollars in money to be Obtained of by the sale of my property which will be hereinafter directed and it is my will that said money above named be placed in the hands of Daniel Grizzle and it is my will that he the said Grizzle should dispose of said Money in purchase of land and that said land be leased for the Term of three years which bequest I give and Grant unto said Theophilus Norwood by him & his heirs to be freely possessed forever\n\nItem 2nd It is my will and desire that the land whereon I am now living with its appurtenances be ??? together with all and Singular the whole of my estate Consisting of one negro girl named Rose – one horse, all my Stock of Cattle hogs one wagon and Gear, also the whole of the plantation and carpenters tools together with all the kitchen and household furniture and Every piece of property which I now possess and it is my will that after my just debts are all paid that the Remainder of the money arising from the sales of said Estate Shall be divided into their equal parts and shall be disposed of in the following manner (viz) one third part to my beloved wife Nancy Smith one third part to my beloved son Thomas Jordan Smith and one third part to the child that my beloved wife is now bearing if it lives and if not it is my will that the whole Remainder as above be Equally divided between my beloved wife Nancy Smith and my beloved son Thomas Jordan Smith\n\n3rd ly and lastly I do hereby make and Ordain my beloved Brother in law Allen Doyle and my beloved wife Nancy Smith the Sole Executor and Executrix of this my last Will and Testament and I do hereby Revoke disannull and Reject all former Wills gifts bequests and Legacies by me heretofore made or granted Ratifying and Confirming this to be my last will and testament.\n\nIn Witness whereof I do hereby set my hand and seal in presence of the Subscribing witnesses and they in the presence of Each other this Twenty Eighth day of April One thousand Eight hundred and twenty five.\n\nSigned Sealed in the presence of us\n\nRichard Smith, George Ringer, Aaron Boyd, Thomas Philips\n\nFrancis D Smith (seal)\n\nProven in open court by the oaths of three of the subscribing witnesses George Ranger Aaron Boyd & Thomas Philips the 12th day of Nov 1825.\n\n??? ? ? Anthony Clk\n\nImperfectly transcribed by William Haloupek. Handwritten original copies are here and here.\n\nSummary of Theo1, Theo2, Theo3, Theo4\n\nThere were 4 men named Theophilus NORWOOD in northern AL and MS.\n\nTheo1 was born about 1809-10 in SC. He is probably the one who married Sally BROWN in 1828 and Sarah PITMAN in 1832, both in Tuscaloosa County, MS. Sarah was born about 1813 in TN. Theo1 and family lived in Tuscaloosa County from 1830 to 1844. Between 1845 and 1847 they moved to Itawamba County, MS, and by 1860 they were in Choctaw County, MS. He was still living in 1870, with a 3rd wife, Pansey. It seems likely that Theo1 and Sally BROWN were the parents of Matilda Caroline (NORWOOD) ALLEN. I suspect that Theo1 is a son of James Richard NORWOOD and Mary SMITH.\n\nTheo2 was born between 1790 and 1800. In 1830 he was head of a household of 6 in Shelby County, AL.\n\nTheo3 was born about 1788 in SC. He married Wilmouth OWEN on 24 Apr 1808 in Barren, KY. Wilmouth was born about 1787 in SC. In 1830 he had a household of 12, which included 3 slaves, in Morgan County, AL. In 1840 he was in Regiment 39, Morgan, AL with a household of 12, including 8 slaves. In 1850 he had a family of 3, plus 8 slaves, in Division 10, Morgan, AL. They were in the Northwest Division, Morgan, AL in 1860, called Thomas and Wellmouth.\n\nTheo4 was born about 1812-4 in AL. His wife was Sarah, born about 1811-5 in NC. They lived in Choctaw County, MS in 1840, 1850 and 1860. He is probably the one who died in 1870, in Choctaw County. I think this page on WikiTree refers to Theo4.\n\nDescendants of Theophilus NORWOOD\n\nThe northern AL-MS region has a shortage of birth and death records. We can often infer birth dates and places from the census records, and death can be assumed to be after the last appearance in a census.\n\nI'm still not certain that the same Theophilus NORWOOD married both Sally BROWN and Sarah PITMAN. Below are my best guesses, based on a lot of research.\n\nSome researchers have Jefferson Davis NORWOOD (1844 - 1921) as a son of Theophilus. However, he does not appear with the family in the 1850 or 1860 US Census. Instead, he appears to be a son of David NORWOOD, a possible brother of Theo1.\n\nFor brevity: Bellefontaine is a village in Choctaw County, MS until 1874, when it was included in newly formed Webster County.\n\n1 Theophilus NORWOOD b: 1809 in SC, d: aft. 26 Aug 1870 (appeared in Bellefontaine in 1870 US Census)\n\n+ Sally Caroline BROWN b: 1810 in TN, m: 10 Sep 1828 in Tuscaloosa, AL, d: 1832 in MS\n\n......2 Mary Ann NORWOOD b: 1829 in Tuscaloosa, AL, d: aft. 1860\n\n...... + Richard Franklin BELL b: 1828 in GA, m: 12 Dec 1847 in Itawamba, MS, d: aft. 1860\n\n......2 Matilda Caroline NORWOOD b: May 1830 in AL, d: aft. 1900 in AR\n\n...... + William ALLEN b: 30 Jun 1822 in AL, m: 11 Nov 1848 in Itawamba, MS, d: 25 Jun 1891 in Logan, AR\n\n+ Sarah PITMAN b: Jan 1813 in TN, m: 01 Mar 1832 in Tuscaloosa, AL, d: Sep 1860 in Bellefontaine\n\n......2 Elizabeth Isabel NORWOOD b: 1833 in Tuscaloosa, AL, d: between 1870 and 1880 probably in Choctaw, MS\n\n...... + Azariah Edmund ELLISON b: 1825 in NC, m: 20 Dec 1852 in Itawamba, MS, d: aft. 1880 probably in Choctaw, MS\n\n......2 Sarah Frances NORWOOD b: 1835 in Tuscaloosa, AL, d: aft. 1860 in Itawamba, MS\n\n...... + Samuel Lewis YEAGER b: 1820 in TN, m: 07 Jul 1852 in Itawamba, MS, d: aft. 1880 in Itawamba, MS\n\n......2 Richard S.

The record says Sarena, and the middle initial is hard to read, but the transcriber for ancestry has Sarah S.\n\nShe married twice. The article [WCK, p. 3] contains valuable information. Her first husband was a probable cousin, John Middleton NORWOOD. The exact relationship is not known, but they had the same last name. John was born about 1823, in Tuscaloosa County, AL. They probably married about 1859, when Serena was about 18 and John about 36. The 1860 US Census has them in Choctaw County, MS, listed among several NORWOOD families, above. Serena and John had 3 sons in a little less than 3 years. John enlisted as a Private in Company D, the 43rd Regiment, and later Company F, 1st Regiment, Mississippi Infantry, Confederate Army. He was taken prisoner at Nashville, TN, on 15 Dec 1864, and died 21 Feb 1865 in the Union Army's Camp Douglas, Chicago, IL.\n\nSerena's second husband was Dr. William Littleberry STOVALL, born 9 Dec 1822 in Richmond, Henrico, VA, died 29 Jan 1908 Bellefontaine, Webster, MS. They married in Pulaski County, AR on 17 Mar 1867, when she was 25 and he was 44. William also had 3 children from a previous marriage. They lived in Bellefontaine, where they had 4 more children. One of Serena's STOVALL children married a NORWOOD - I have not yet sorted out the relationships in this extended family.\n\nThe 1900 US has the family in a rented home at 25 Third Street, Memphis, TN. This looks like the same family as the one in Lee County, MS in 1880, as 3 of the grown children are still at home, although it looks like Alfred has become Effie. James and Semantha had been married 33 years, and Semantha had 13 children, with 8 still living in 1900. All were able to read and write.\n\nThis census tells us that Samantha's parents were both born in MS. If she is Rachel S. NORWOOD, the 1850 and 1860 US Censuses both say they were born in SC and TN. Is it possible that James reported to the census taker, and didn't know where his wife's parents were born?\n\nRachel was still living in 1900, but had died by 1910, as James was then a widower, living in Memphis.\n\nThe death certificate of James Monroe BIRMINGHAM says he was born 28 Oct 1845, and died 13 Jul 1917 in Memphis, age 72. However, the 1900 US Census says he was born in Oct 1842, and his military records says he was 18 when he enlisted on 31 Aug 1861."
