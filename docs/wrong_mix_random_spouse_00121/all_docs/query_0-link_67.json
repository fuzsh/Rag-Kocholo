        "text": "\"Disneyfication of the witches\" is not a today's construct. Even though in the image of the witch, elements of the past and of the myth oscillate, yet, modern times demanded changing and upgrading of the old-fashioned reality of the understanding of the witches; along with them, we need to address the elements of real and present dilemmas as well like for instance, discarding the general supposition that the greater number of the traditional witches were ugly, scary creatures with facial warts and greenish skin color. Realistically speaking, the contemporary envisaging of the today's witch is an intentionally good-looking, strong and domineering woman, at times even Mary Poppins-kind-of comical and benign figure, a modern-day Disneyfied (b)witch who is struggling with everyday problems such as marriage, children, job promotion, weight issues, cholesterol and so on. Nowadays, the phenomenon of the (b)witches is discussed more openly, without any kind of fear or discomfort; they have even become adored icons of the modern, secular era though still evoking ''negative fascination''. This paper, apart from the overview of the history of witchcraft, will correlate with the phenomenon of modern (b)witches with reference to the three modern (b)witch-like characters in John Updike's novel, The Witches of Eastwick.\n\nWitch stories are part of American popular culture, and this culture is extremely influenced by a continuing reliance on its past. The modern obsession of Americans with witches, whether real or metaphorical, is related to politics especially when it came to issues of gender politics. This article exposes a modern image of the female character seen from a male author point of view. John Updike, influenced by the changes that happened to women within second wave of feminism, attempted to write The Witches of Eastwick (1984). Actually, he presented women who did have a sort of careers. His witches are professional active and dynamic. What do witches stand for in American Culture? Why did Updike choose to write about women? Why were these females witches and not ordinary women? This is the core discussion of the present study.\n\nWhile contemporary discussions about witchcraft include reinterpretations and feminist reclamations, early modern accusations contained no such complexity. It is this historical witch as misogynist nightmare that the film,The Witch: A New England Folktale (2015), expresses so effectively. Within the film, the very patriarchal structures that decry witchcraft – the Puritan church from which the family exiles itself, the male headship to which the parents so desperately cling, the insistence, in the face of repeated failure, on the viability of the isolated nuclear family unit – are the same structures that inevitably foreclose the options of the lead character, Thomasin. https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol22/iss3/6\n\nAccording to many historians and anthropologists, female deviance and authorization have been significantly expressed through witchcraft. The crime of witchcraft was charged against women, who were supposed as undermining the social agreement of patriarchal control. As a medieval delusion, witchcraft has been seen as an idea that progresses varied from cultural context to cultural context and finally stopped undergoing their most significant changes and rifeness at the time of Early Modern Period, both in the old and in the new world. Thus, the stereotypical witch image represents societies' misogynistic fear of women's deviances and evil since Early Modern England, Continental Europe, and New England. The oral and graphic dialogues and its performance surrounding the oppression of witches are competed as being the result of a dialectic communication concerning the different heights of early modern society, especially concerning the conventional scenes of the learned Christian religious and secular academic experts, as well as heterodox non-Christian faith at the ordinary people level. Unluckily, the craze of witchcraft track in seventeenth-century England, Continental Europe and New England was primarily powered by the domination of Christian religious and demonological rumors and agreements, directing to more humongous extent women, women-as-witches. From Continental Europe to Colonial New England, three types of witches can be classified: the English Popular Witch, the Continental Demonic Witch, and the Colonial Puritan Witch. The paper's objective is to discuss women as witchcraft images since medieval Europe through a documentary methodological analysis that reflects a stereotypical classification.\n\nAfter Charmed ended in 2006, witches were relegated to sidekicks of televisual vampires or children's programs. But during the mid-2010s they began to resurface as leading characters in shows like the immensely popular The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, the Charmed reboot, Salem, American Horror Story: Coven, and the British program, A Discovery of Witches. No longer sweet, feminine, domestic, and white, these witches are powerful, diverse, and transgressive, representing an intersectional third-wave feminist vision of the witch. Featuring original essays from noted scholars, this is the first critical collection to examine witches on television from the late 2010s. Situated in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement, essays examine the reemergence and shifting identities of TV witches through the perspectives of intersectional gender studies, hauntology, politics, morality, monstrosity, violence, queerness, disabilities, rape, ecofeminism, linguistics, family, and digital humanities."
