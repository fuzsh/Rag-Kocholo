(Shea) Levell of 2446 Highland Avenue, died yesterday after a short illness. Born in Fall River, son of the late Patrick and the late Mary (Dooley) Levell, he was a lifelong resident here. He was a member of St. Mary's Cathedral parish and a charter member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles. He leaves three sons, Edward F. of Fall River, Rev. Raymond P. Levell, S.J. of Spring Hill College, Mobile, Ala., and Brother Leonard, S.C. of St. Rose of Lima School, Brooklyn, N.Y.; two daughters, Mrs. Joseph Reardon of Brooklyn and Sister Mary Frederica, R.S.M., of Holy Family High School, New Bedford; 11 grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and several nieces and nephews. The funeral will be held from the Michael E. O'Rourke Funeral Home on Wednesday morning, with a solemn high mass of requiem in St. Mary's Cathedral at 10. Interment will be in St. Patrick's Cemetery.\n\n11-5-2004\n\nHi Jane,\n\nI know you will think that I am crazy, but I found you by searching for the Reardon family. Many years ago I knew the family of Mrs. Joseph Reardon (Mary Leavell). I was in touch with most of them for many years. Brother Leonard was a dear friend, and I met his nieces and nephews (Mary's children) through him. I was in touch with Brother Leonard until just before his death, and received one of his Christmas cards after his passing. To get to the point, I was in touch with Angela Reardon (Mary's daughter) until a couple of years ago. She lived for many years at 8794 15th Avenue in Brooklyn. She moved a couple of years ago and we exchanged Christmas cards, until I got one back that said that she no longer lived at the new address. I don't know if she passed away or just moved again. I found it unusual that I have not heard from her and I have no contact with any of her siblings.

They gave me the nomination anyway. When notified, I told them that I would very much prefer not to make the race that I would not electioneer for it, and further, that Captain Willis, an uncle of ex-Governor Bradley, and my opponent, was a man well qualified for the office. They insisted that I make the race, and the following Monday Squire Leavel, an old friend, came to my office and told me that Captain Willis had been to see him and showed him a paper containing a list of names, and claimed to know how every man in the county was going to vote, and that he had beaten me by 175 votes. Leavel said he was very sorry for it. I studied a few moments and said that he need not fear, that I would beat Willis. I had been judge of the county for eight years, and during that time I had become acquainted with every prominent man in it, and I knew the sentiments of the leading men of the county and their influence. I then took a piece of chalk, setting down on the wall what I thought the vote would be. On Monday the election came off, and in the evening, about nine o'clock, Jesse Yantis, the sheriff, got up and cried the polls. I had beaten Willis by 206, with(in) six votes of the calculation I had made.\n\nST.

Then she met Hector Hubert Harris and they married and moved to OK., Indian Territory. This seems unlikely, since her first husband didn't die until 1906; she'd have been fifty, rather old to start having babies!\n\nThe obituary of Merrill Pipkin Level, son of William J. and Emma Shannon Level, states he was preceded in death by his parents and four brothers: Charles Wesley, Emmett H., Jesse D., and John M.
