        "text": "By Kim Douglass\n\n(December 1, 2010) Today is big day across the world. Ending their digital lives to raise awareness about those who have died from the uncurable disease, celebrities like Elijah Woods, Justin Timberlake, and Kim Kardashian along with tennis player Serena Williams have joined forces for World AIDS Day.\n\nThe initiative, first started by Alicia Keys, is called Buy Life. Launched under Keys charity, Keep a Child Alive, the program is aimed at financing medical care and support for children and families affected by HIV and AIDS in Africa and India. The pitch that Keys is giving to fans for this campaign is \"You’re always texting your friends. Now, you’re going to text to Buy Life.\"\n\nMonday, Nov. 29, Williams first made the announcement on Twitter, of her impending death and provided fans with links to give donations online as well as via text message to buy her life back.\n\nUntil fans have donated $1 million, Williams won’t update her social media accounts.\n\nBefore \"passing on\" Williams filmed her “last tweet and testament.”"
