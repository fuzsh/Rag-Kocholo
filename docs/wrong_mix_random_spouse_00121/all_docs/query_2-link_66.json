        "text": "\"King Richard\" Williams admits he should be dead by now in the raw trailer for his upcoming documentary - telling the story of his life before daughters Serena and Venus became tennis greats.\n\nThe U.S. Sun has obtained preview footage for On The Line after the movie premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival last year.\n\nThe film, which follows on from the King Richard biopic starring Will Smith, continues to receive rave reviews at private events ahead of its public release which has been pushed back.\n\nDescribed as an \"emotional reckoning\" featuring unaired interviews spanning the 1980s to the present day, Richard retraces his past \"from the poverty-stricken streets of Shreveport, Louisiana, to the grass courts of Wimbledon.\"\n\nThe documentary tells the tale of how he fought back against systemic and racial oppression and violence, \"breaking every rule of the lily-white tennis establishment to forever change the sport.\"\n\nOn The Line will premiere at the Sheffield DocFest in England on June 17, 18, and 19, and then in various markets around the world.\n\nArchive video shows Richard, now 81, talking about why he coached his girls from being children, revealing: \"I thought I could live through my kids, and I thought I could make a million dollars.\"\n\nHe goes on to explain he grew up in Louisana, saying: \"All my life I had to be brave, I should have been dead by now,\" as old footage shows racial tension in the US, protests, and devastating images of the KKK.\n\nDirector Stuart McClave exclusively told The U.S. Sun: \"Mr. Williams has never given up a day in his life.\n\nAGAINST THE ODDS\n\n\"He is one of the rare examples of someone who talks the talk and walks the walk. A father who knew that hard work and faith would be the ticket to success.\n\n\"His ability to visualize the future and enact a plan was crucial to the entire family breaking down the very real barriers of class and privilege in what was predominantly a wealthy, white sport. A sport he had to learn himself on the courts in Compton in order to teach it to his daughters.\n\n\"Many people might not have understood him back in the day. They might not have liked the way he talked, the jokes he made, and the proclamations he so confidently delivered to the media and tennis establishment.\n\n\"But he believed in Venus and Serena and knew that they had the strength, grit, determination, and talent to become the best in the world.\"\n\nStuart added: \"This documentary is about the dream fulfilled, and how Mr. Williams' early life in the deep south shaped him into the visionary father and coach of two of the greatest athletes of our time.\"\n\nRichard narrates the majority of the documentary, filmed more than a year ago, describing how the family moved to Compton, California.\n\nIn the trailer, Serena and Venus can be seen as children heading out onto the court in unseen home movies and playing tennis games.\n\nFACING RACISM\n\nIt also shows stunning footage of Serena stepping onto the court with her father and being met with a \"crescendo of boos\" back in 2001 in Indian Wells, California.\n\nAt the time, Richard was being accused of fixing games after Venus pulled out of a semifinal against her sister four minutes before the match.\n\n\"An American crowd booing an American family, and it does smack of a little bit of racism,\" a commenter is heard saying in the\n\nRichard remains defiant in the clip and waves his fist at his critics, as thousands point and shout from the stands.\n\nThe short trailer, which runs for one minute 18 seconds, also shows Richard's wacky sense of humor, after another commenter admits: \"The world was not ready for Richard Williams.\"\n\nRichard's son, Chavoita LeSane, also helped produce the documentary, and the family is looking forward to its full release.\n\nThe Golden Globes claimed the movie achieves its goal of \"breathing life into a subject in a way that not even King Richard was able to accomplish.\"\n\nUnseen Films says it paints a portrait of a \"complex man,\" while Variety wrote: \"Richard Williams has his say in this thoughtful documentary.\"\n\nChavoita told The U.S. Sun: \"I feel like the world doesn't know Richard Williams' story. Like who created them [Serena and Venus], what was the thinking, what madness?\n\n\"How does a parent create a number one and a number two [in sport] ... that's phenomenal, especially in a very racist sport. It's tennis.\n\n\"How do you get two kids to believe in themselves that much? I have children now. It's hard to get them out of bed and make them go to school in the morning, you know?\n\n\"I wanted his POV [point of view] to be seen, his true voice to be heard. I'm ecstatic. Everybody who's seen it, they are all blown away.\""
