As a result notes were made and verified when the opportunity arose. But youth knew also that time had to be considered for generations could go quickly and all contact lost unless written material existed. Therefore, spurred by an alert, genealogically-minded, \"proud-of-family\" mother and a father who had a mathematical mind for family ties too, it was necessary to finish this thirty-year task even though far from completion and probably with errors or omissions. There are many relatives who with their contributions have made this publication possible.

Cate's Cross Roads, adjoining nearby Dumplin, is on the border of Jefferson and Sevier County. This area is drained by DUMPLIN CREEK which has its headwaters in Jefferson County and passes through the 8th and 12th Civil Dis¬ trict of Sevier County emptying into the French Broad River at Kodak, Tennessee. The great Indian WARPATH passed through this territory. Civil War activities and fires have destroyed much of the written material on this section. This publication is an attempt to preserve some of the material gathered by the writer over a period of years. The original copies were found in attics, trunks, and family papers. Sons and daughters of Dumplin Valley include such family names as Adams, Allen, Elder, Bryan, Campbell, Carmichael, Cate, Catlett, Douglass, Henry, Hudson, Huffaker, Miller, Mount, McCleary, Newman, Upton, Underwood, Gilreath, Johnson, Griffey, and Swann. This publication will deal principally with the CATE and HENRY FAMILIES, whose descendants can be found in every state of the United States. HENRY FAMILY The HENRY FAMILY, said to be of Norman origin, can be found in \"Livres des Conquerante\" of William the Conqueror, 1085. After the Conquest, the Henrys settled in England, Scotland, and Ireland, especially Coleraine County, where Hugh, Patrick, James, and John were common names. During the eighteenth century, oppressed by the English government and spurred with a spirit of liberty, many Henry families sought homes as well as freedom in the American Colonies about 1718-1765, settling in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Among the pioneers coming into the Southwest were many of Scotch-Irish extraction. The Henry family probably could be placed in the category. HENRY COAT OF ARMS Arms - Azure, a fesse between three pelican's argent vulned proper Crest - A pelican's head erased vulning itself proper Motto - Fideliter HENRY FAMILY There is a tradition in the family that an old man--Henry with five or six sons, settled in one of the upper counties of present East Tennessee in the early settlement of this country and that they were the progenitors of the East Tennessee Henrys. A glance at the tax lists of Washington County, Virginia, in the 1770's shows many acres of land belonging to Sam, James, Hugh, William and John Henry. In the Archives Division, Tennessee State Library, Nashville, Tennessee, as well as the North Carolina Archives, Raleigh, we find the following: North Carolina Grant #90 SAMUEL HENRY, Jr., (Tenn. Bk 1, p. 472) 150 acres, Washington County, Dry Creek, Oct. 23, 1782, signed J. Glasgow and Alex Martin North Carolina Grant #151 SAMUEL HENRY, Jr,. (Tenn. Bk 6, p. 80) 200 acres, Washington County, Buffalo Creek, Oct. 23, 1782 North Carolina Grant #246 SAM HENRY (Tenn. bk 6, p. 81) 578 acres, Washington County, west side of Buffalo Creek, Oct. 23, 1782 Referring to Land Grant #246, we find a warranty deed in Book A, page 342, dated Oct. 3, 1801, Carter County, Tennessee. The six Henry boys had given a deed to Jonathan Tipton for 100 acres. The readings are from the above property. The deed mentioned James, Samuel, William, Hugh, John and Ezekial Henry. Each heir was to receive from the Samuel Henry land $333. 33. Residences were given as Knox and Sevier County, Tennessee. Only signatures of William, Hugh, and John Henry were shown. James Henry, their brother, had died 1792. 2 North Carolina Grant #66 HUGH HENRY, Green County, N. C. dated January 4, 1785. An order to survey 100 acres of land in Greene County, N.

SIX HENRY BROTHERS In the Court House, Carter County, Tennessee, we find a Warranty Deed, SAMUEL HENRY ESTATE, in Book A, dated 1801, with James, Samuel, William, Hugh, John and Ezekial Henry of Knox and Sevier Counties mentioned. One would assume from the document that SAMUEL HENRY is the father. His wife may have been Rachael. 1. William Henry b. about 1749 d. about 1833.

Often a master traded a slave for a mate to keep them happy ... sometimes the exchange was for land and often for money. At the Register's Office, Sevier Co., Sevierville, Term., we find in Book H, p. 412, the following: \"Received of John Chandler, $425.00 for a negro girl named Martha, which I have this day, sold to him. But the said negro girl is not in my possession. She was willed to me by my father but to remain in the hands of the widow that is my step-mother, ELIZABETH BRYAN, during her natural life and the said Chandler, is not to have the use and benefit nor possession of said girl, during period of time but if the said negro girl lives to that time, the said Chandler is to have possession of her and also if there should be any in error, the said Chandler is to have them.

BRYANT PLEASANT HENRY HENRY WIDENER ALLEN S . BRYANT (seal) (PLEASANT HENRY m. MARY BRYAN, dau. of ALLEN BRYANT and LEE HENRY, the twin brother m. SARAH, dau. of THOMAS BRYANT.) 4 NOTES ON LIFE IN DUMPLIN VALLEY (Sevier County, East Tenn.) Schools \"North of the French Broad River\", in the 8th and 12th Civil District of Sevier County, Tenn. , began with tutors and subscription schools according to data found. Early schools were French Broad Academy, at Henry's Cross Roads, Nancy Academy established 1806 at Sevierville, Tenn. , with Allen Bryant of Henry's Cross Roads, as one of its trustees and a few miles from this section was the Strawberry Plains Academy. Few people were financially able to attend. HUGH HENRY, who arrived on Dumplin Creek, in the French Broad River area, between 1777-1785 believed in an education for his children. His son, Samuel b. 1787, in 1813 took the taxable list of men Capt. Williams Company. His handwriting and expression were very good. A receipt in the Henry Family dated August 28, 1820 states \"This day received of HUGH HENRY $2.00 in full of a quarter schooling subscribed for the 3rd day of May 1820. I say received by me, Peter Keener.\" By this time all of the first set of Hugh Henry's children had been educated and gone to Alabama. Schools were from 6 weeks to 3 months with a written contract of about $1 per month per child which was often paid after the school closed. A writing school of 10 days usually preceded the subscription schools. Some of the teachers: Peter Keener, a Nathan Jackson of N.C., Abraham Cate, Dan Duggan, 1884, Doc Murphy, the late S.W.G. Cate about 1890, also taught at Rankin and Leadville, Tenn. Singing Schools in the summer were taught by A.D. Henry, Henry Douglass and F.A. Henry, 1890-1920 period. Smith's School house in the 12th district was used as a Quaker Church from 1832 to 1877 by Isaac and Calvin Jones of Rocky Valley, Jefferson County, Tenn. This building was situated on the Robert Bales land. The weather board building was about 30x50 ft. and was located about 1 1/2 miles northwest of Kodak. Mattie Cate Huffaker and John Q. McMahan taught there prior to 1910. In the 1870-1900 period the teachers were H.G. Underwood, Nelson Underwood and Malinda Cate Hampstead. A teacher, with at least 100 students perched on seats made from slats with peg legs, had a four months session from July to October. The pay usually consisted of free board and lodging at the home of the patrons of the school. At the end of the Civil War, 1865-1870 Dorthula Brimer Cate and her brother Winfield Brimer, who died in Liberty, Mo. , recall that their guardian Patrick Henry sent them to school at Oak Grove, Kodak, Tenn. , of the 8th District. Prior to the war it was called Henry's Chapel. Hugh Henry's family and negroes had been educated and worshipped there before 1838. During the 1880 period church and school were held in the same building at Oak Grove. The old building was made of limestone, clay and logs. Teachers of this period were Prof. E.R. Cate, Washington Baker, Luther Q. Bailey, Maude Catlett, H.G. Underwood, Estelle Cate, Bruce Johnson, Carrie Bryan McBee about 1910 Miss Callie Saffel. Spelling Bee, Pie suppers and Friday afternoon program were school attrac¬ tion s . Consolidation saw such schools as Smith's, Oak Grove, Snyder's Paw Paw Hollow, Henry's Cross Roads, Corn Bread, Cate's X Roads, French Broad Valley at Perry Douglass's be replaced by modem up-to date building such as the one at Beech Springs. Underwood's School in the 12th district is still open. There was another Under¬ wood's school in 1820-90 period on the old George Hudson farm near the bent of the French Broad River in the 12th district. Among the teachers were Mrs. Mattie Mitchell Davis, 1870-1880; Pleasant Mount 1882; Mitchell and Dan Duggan, brothers, Washington Baker at Henry's X Roads, and Alex Ferguson. During the 1880 period Alex Ferguson had two scholars, William and Nick Susong, who were almost grown and kept the good teacher on his \"Watch\". Ferguson had corrected the boys the daybefore, the next day, the father , Wm. Susong, a farmer came to school and went into Ferguson. Father Susong picked up a rock, Ferguson, the teacher, backed off, drew his revolver and fired at the old man. His aim was low. He hit the wooden peg holding up the old man's pants. Father Susong left the school holding up his pants saying \"Vinnie, I gad he's shot my belly off - at the school\". Capt. Joseph Underdown, an elderly man in the 1880-85 period would give local boys a few pennies per night to come and read the Bible and literature to him. S.W.G. Cate, was one of the sub-teenagers that read to the Capt. at his home on the banks of the French Broad. #2. \"January 2 4th 1817 Received of Hugh Henry, Senior seven dollars and Eighty Six cents in full satisfac¬ tion for his subscription to my school articles of one and a half scholar. Articles dated July the first 1816 for the term of nine months . ( signed ) John C . Harvey . In 1950 the Kodak Community, Sevier Co. , Tenn, began the construction of a new brick school building. In November of 1951, 250 pupils from Beech Springs, Henry’s Cross Roads, and French Broad Schools were consolidated. The Woodmen of the World presented the school with a flag pole. High School pupils were transported to Sevierville. Teachers since the opening of the Kodak School have been Max Cate, Miss Ruby Drinner, Mrs. Edna McCall, Shirley Snyder, Arnold Underwood, Mrs. Carrie Swann, Mrs. Nora Bailey, Mrs. Fred Bryan, Mrs. Emma Ruth Catlett, L.B. Williams, William Huffaker, Leon Drinnen , Mrs. Roy Houte. Among the fraternal organizations in the area we find the Junior order of Mechanics, Odd Fellows, Woodmen of the World and the French Broad Lodge, #588, Free An Accepted Masons, which was organized about 1895. The first meeting of the Masons was held at a warehouse at the mouth of Dumplin Creek, French Broad River, at Sinking Springs, (Kathleen, Tenn., later Kodak, Tenn.) Charter members include Dr. J.W. Drinnen, Pleasant Underwood, Washington Baker, Robert Russell, Enoch Huffaker, Rufus Kelley. In 1955 S.W.G. Cate of Kodak, Tenn. was award¬ ed a 50 yr. certificate of membership by the lodge. A new concrete block building replaced the Lodge building destroyed by fire in 1958, Kodak, Tenn. 5 The political life of this section shows up in history as early as June 1785 when Dumplin Treaty was signed at Henry's Station (home of Hugh), near the spot where Dumplin Creek empties into French Broad River, Sevier County, Tenn. (8th and 12th District). Here the State of Franklin represented by John Sevier and the Cherokee nation by Ancoo , Chief of Chota consented for land to be opened south of the French Broad and Holstein River to settlement. See Ramsay' s Annals of Tenn . , p . 299 . Peter Bryant of Upper Dumplin was a member of the first court held in Sevier Co. , Tenn. , Nov. 8 , 1794. In 1782 Hugh Henry of this section known then as Greene Co. , was a deputy to the convention at Jonesboro to deliberate upon the state of public affairs and recommend some general plan of action suited to the emergency. In 1841-42, Lewis Reneau, Sevier County lawyer, lived at Henry's Cross Roads, and served as State Senator. He was a Whig Candidate from Sevier County in 1843, in the Second District Congressional campaign but withdrew in July before the August election. Abraham Cate, a former Justice of Peace of 8th District, was defeated by one vote in 1866 when Wilson Duggan of the third district of Sevier Co. , Tenn. , was elected County Court Clerk. For three days Cate was said to be the winner. In 1860 Richard Fowler of the 8th district was elected sheriff and Samuel W.G. Cate of the same district was elected sheriff in 1910-14. During the Civil War, voting in the 8th district was held at the home of Samuel Mount, Justice of the Peace. He was the father of Pleasant Mount. (Former Justice of Peace and Postmaster at Henry's Cross Roads.) Early Justice of the Peace include Wm. Drinnen, Dan Kelley, and F.A. Henry, who served 50 years as Justice of Peace from the 8th District, and Walter Huffaker, now serving. Stages traveled the Great Warpath from counties of Washington, Sullivan, Greene, to the South. The Clinch, the Holston, Watauga French Broad River carried men toward the Mississippi. Flat boats gave way to steam. In the 1880-90's steamboats ran regularly from Knoxville up the French Broad River to Dandridge, Tenn. For less than a dollar people of this region could travel to Knoxville, Tenn. , an over night trip. Among the boats that traveled these waters was the Lucile Borden which in 1891 made 96 trips up the French Broad. The Annabee King, the first freight boat to make a trip out of Knoxville, was piloted by Capt. Ambrose Underwood. Capt. Ambrose Underwood, son of John and Mariah C . Underwood, who was raised on the French Broad River, remained in active service in the waters of the upper Tennessee River for more than 50 years. He married Alzira Henry, daughter of Patrick Henry, the poet of Dumplin. Capt. Underwood was associated with the Lucile Borden, the Onegia called \"O'Nigger\", Flora Swann and other light boats. He knew how to conquer the shallow waters of the Holston and the French Broad, among them the Gallops, Wild Bull and the Seven Islands. When the steamboat fail to run, Capt. Underwood used the flatboat. Capt. Paul and Harris Underwood, sons of Capt. Underwood, as young deck hands recall an old horse they carried on the heavy flat boat. When more locomotion was needed Capt. Under¬ wood would put the old horse in shallow water, hitch him to the boat as if it were a wagon, a slip of the whip and the boat was off of the shoal. Reload the horse on the boat and continue. Capt. Paul and Harris Underwood are qualified Tennessee River pilots. In retirement, during World War 11 Capt. Amborse Underwood was called back into River service . In 1958, Capt. Paul Underwood guided the Delta Queen from Cincinnati, Ohio down the Mississippi River to New Orleans . HENRY'S CROSS ROADS POST OFFICE (Now Kodak , Sevier Co . , Tenn .)

Remains of an early tan yard, using native bark of this section, can be seen on the south side of Tuckahoe Creek bridge, just west of the State Highway #39 from Route #70 to the Douglass Dam, Kodak, Tenn. Leather for shoes and harness was prepared here. For years it was conducted by Pleasant Underwood b. 1838. He was a son of Wm . R. Underwood , b . 18 1 6 . (See U.S. Census, 1850 , Sevier Co ., Tenn . #1064) . It is known to have operated before 1860 and until 1920. 6 As early as 1875 a large whiskey distillery was conducted Just above Beech Springs, on what Is known as the GUreath property In the vicinity of the present Beech Springs Baptist Church, on the west side of the State road.

Since Hugh Henry's name appears on the tax list of Washington Co., (nowTenn .) for 1779, he may have resided there at this time for he served with Bledsoe in 1777 with the men from Sullivan and Washington Counties. (See Wis . Historical Publication-Draper Papers, p. 51 - 4xx-221791) also King's Mountain Men by White . Mrs . Lucy Henry Cate (Mrs. S.W.G.) of Kodak , Tenn the granddaughter of Hugh Henry used his Revolutionary War Service for N.S. DAR., # 441711 . Like all of the early settlers, the Henry brothers as members of the Watauga Association in 1772, considered their home Virginia. When the Revolution came, the Association named the Country Washington District. With the Indians and British to fight the settlers asked to be Annexed to North Carolina, in 1776. In November of 1777, Washington District became Washington County with boundaries including the whole present State of Tennessee. In the Washington District of North Carolina, we find that Hugh Henry and others came in COURT and took the OATH OF ALLEGIANCE to the State, Aug. 26,1778. He also attended the Provincial Congress at Halifax, N.C. In the May term of Court 1780, Hugh Henry is mentioned again. In the May term of 1781 in the case of the State vs. Davis Hickly (?) Davis paid 2500 pounds in a misprision and treason case. William Henry, Hugh Henry, and James Millican were the witnessess for the State. (Greene Co., N.C., nowTenn., Court Records) . In 1783, the present State of Tennessee had three counties from Washington District, namely, Washington, Sullivan and Greene . Searching through the 1783-1796 MINUTES OF GREENE COUNTY COURT, (N.C .) no Tenn. p.35, told of Joshua Gist, esq. appointed to take the inventory in Capt. Henry's and Walker's Companies. (The Gist family resided and lived near the Henry's on Dumplin: p. 127 cites a deed from Thos. Gillspy, early Washington Co. , Justice of the Peace, to Hugh Henry, 200 acres on Dumplin Creek, 1789; p. 166 ordered a road to be laid off from Henry's on Dumplin Creek to the Hawkins County line; p. 204 in 1791, Samuel Henry administered for James Henry, deceased. James, the brother of Samuel and Hugh Henry, went to Blount Co., Little River area. (He left many descendants in Blount Co. , Tenn. ,) (S.W. Henry, former postmaster at Townsend, Tenn.) on p. 223, John Henry, Ezekial and Hugh Henry helped with the road from Evans Ferry to Hawkins County Line. In the County Court Clerk' s Office, Rogersville, Tenn. Book 1, p. 18 of Hawkins County Records, Hugh Henry bought a tract of land for 50 pounds, July 1789. According to the family, he often visited his relatives in this area. On examination of the TREASURER'S SLIP for REVOLUTIONARY WAR SERVICE ( Archives, N.C .) we find HUGH HENRY'S records were signed by Edmund Williams, Landon Carter and John Sevier. It was the desire for protection that drew these men into the STATE OF FRANKLIN, HUGH HENRY was one of the Green County representatives in the discussions on protection . HUGH HENRY in 1780 joined the other \"Over-theMountain\" men of Capt. Shelby and John Sevier at King's Mountain. ( See King's Mt. , Men by White, p. 104, Militia Roster lists Hugh Henry) . Following the King's Mountain Battle, it has been handed down that Hugh Henry was at the Battle of Boyd's Creek where John Sevier met the Indians. Boyd's Creek is a short distance from where Dumplin Creek enters the French Broad River. Seveir Co. , Tenn. According to p. 274 of ANNALS OF TENNESSEE by Ramsey - \" The peace procured by the several campaigns already mentioned was momentarily interrupted by the conduct of James Hubbard and a comrade no less wicked and reckless. They were shooting at a mark with two Indians. During the shooting one of the warriors was killed, the other escaped and fled to the Nation. It was believed that Hubbard had killed the Indian designedly and that a border war wuld be the consequence. The settlers assembled together at Henry's near the Mouth of DUMPLIN. (Creek) , there built a staticn. A half-breed passing through the neighborhood was requested to procure a friendly conference between his exasperated countrymen and the settlers. The conference was held at Gist's. Six or eight Cherokees attended there, having crossed the river at Henry's. In the ANNALS OF TENNESSEE by Ramsey, p. 286 — \"It was proposed that in each captain's company two representatives of the people should be elected, who should assemble, as committees, in their respective couties, to deliberate upon the state of .public affairs and recommend some general plan of action suited to the emergency. These committees, for Washington, Sullivan and Greene, met and recommended the election of deputies from each of the counties to assemble in convention at Jonesboro', with power to adopt such measures as they should deem advisable . Washington County election of deputies included, John Sevier, Charles Robertson, William Murphy, Joseph Wilson, John Irvin, Samuel Houston, William Trimble, William Cox, Landon Carter, HUGH HENRY, Christopher Taylor, and others We find in the HISTORY OF TENNESSEE by Goodspeed Publishing Co . , Nashville , p . 191 .. . \"Accordingly the representatives met August 23,1783 in Jonesborough, again HUGH HENRY was named as deputy from Washington Co. , with Sevier and Landon Carter and other named. East Tennessee as we know it today has been called by many names, such as Eastern District South of the Ohio; Watauga Association; Washington District; Washington County Va . , and North Carolina. This region from 1784-1788 was called the State of Franklin. In the State of North Carolina Archives, Raleigh, we find in the LEGISLATIVE PAPERS for June 1784-1786 among those signing a petition of the Western County, General Assembly of North Carolina, HUGH HENRY, #10; Samuel Henry # 20 Ezekial and William Henry# 19 and James Upton, #14. In 1853 Ramsey in his \"ANNALS OF TENNESSEE\" on p. 299, wrote of the DUMPLIN TREATY. \"Having appointed the officers of the State and Provided for the support of the government of Franklin, th e Assembly authorized a treaty to be held with the Cherokee Indians. Gov. John Sevier, Alexander Outlaw, and Daniel Kennedy were appointed the commissioners. The treaty was held at the home of MAJOR HENRY, near the mouth of DUMPLIN CREEK, on the North bank of the French Broad River. The king of the Cherokees with a great number of their chiefs, met the Franklin Commissioners at this place, on May 21, 1785. The conference was continued three days and 8 \"MAJOR\" HUGH HENRY, THE FRONTIERSMAN (cont'd) resulted in the establishment of the ridge dividing the waters of Little River and the Tennessee, as the boundary between the whites and Indians and the cession of all lands south of the French Broad and Holston (Rivers), East of that ridge. For these lands the Indians were promised compensation in general terms. Both parties professed a sincere desire for the blessings of peace. ...\" (In the back of Ramsey's Annals, in the Rain's Index, one finds HUGH HENRY as the MAJOR mentioned above) . In 1923 when S.C. Williams wrote \"History of the Lost State of Franklin\", he stated the Dumplin Treaty was held at the hone of Major Samuel Henry. (The write was never able to get from Mr. Williams the source of his material. Yet Ramsey who wrote Annals of Tennessee knew and visited the Henry Family at Henry's Cross Roads, Sevier Co. , Tenn.) At formal cermonies on June 10,1954 the Jefferson and Sevier County chapters of the Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities, and the Historical Commission with a highway marker on State Highway 39, erected a monument with appropiate ceremonies re-enacting the SIGNING OF THE DUMPLIN TREATY. The spot is a short distance from Dumplin Creek, near the State Highway at Kodak, Tenn., on a portion of the Hugh Henry property, now belonging to a descendant, William Catlett. BEECH SPRINGS CEMETERY— Eighth Dist., Sevier Co., (Kodak , Term .) According to Chancery Court Records, Sevier Co., Tenn., PATRICK HENRY, of Kodak, bought one acre of land belonging to AHAZ GWIN at a sale. This acre of land was deeded to BEECH SPRINGS CHURCH COMMUNITY with a road. (Apparently the road came near the land belonging to WILLIAM ROMINES, who was ill, after his death the children refused to sign the rightway and the Church bought the road sometime later.) As the Community grew another acre was purchased with BRUCE JOHNSON and EMMITT HUFFAKER each selling 1/2 acre. There was in the community an old negro called \"BLACK SALLIE\". She helped many families in the community. Regularly she went to PATRICK HENRY begging to be buried in the Cemetery. According to the Family, \"BLACK SALLIE\" died after Patrick Henry and was buried in a comer of the Cemetery in the 1890s. L. C. Gilreath, Frank Pollard and John Snyder were members of the Cemetery Committee. TREASURER'S DEPARTMENT JEFFERSON COUNTY M. V. Henry, Treasurer Birmingham, Alabama Mr. P. D. Cate, June 1,1929 Knoxville, Tenn. Dear Mr. Cate: I received some time ago a letter from you giving me some information of the Henry family in East Tennessee. It was Indeed kind of you, and I appreciate it greatly. I also received a letter from Miss Clemmie J. Henry, Chairman and Secretary of Committee On Student-Help, Maryville College, Tennessee, which gave me some information concerning the Henry family. The brief record I have of my family came from an old bachelor uncle, Isaac Henry, who moved in his early life to Marshall County, Ala., and who was a Lieutenant in the Mexican War, and a Captain in the War between the States. He was a man of wonderful memory and experience. He has now been dead some twenty-five years or more, but he gave me this information about our family; his father lived in East Tennessee, and was a Captain in the Revolutionary War, and a nephew of Patrick Henry. His father was married twice. He was the oldest of the younger set. My father, Ake Henry, was the youngest of the older set. He mentioned my father's brother, Hugh Henry of the older set, who moved to Alabama and died at Henryville, in Marshall County. Uncle Hugh in Marshall County was married twice and had one son, Albert G., by his first wife, and by the second wife, there was Pat, Ben and Mary who married a Conwell. Thanking you for the information and hoping that I may some day have the pleasure of meeting you, I am Yours very truly. M. V. Henry 9 \"MAJOR\" HUGH HENRY OF DUMPLIN Since pioneer life in the wilds was so dangerous that the settlers kept constant watch, \"Major\" Henry had a fort or station built near the mouth of Dumplin Creek, where it empties into the French Broad River, (Sevier Co., Tenn.) Contact was made with settlers at Fort Patrick Henry at Long Island on the Holston River about 8 miles away. Suspecting that Hugh Henry b. 1756 might have carried on trade with the Indians, the records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, revealed that neither he nor Samuel Henry had . But Hugh Jr. , b. 1796 bought and sold cattle, pork, grain, tobacco, molasses and shipped by water down the Tenn. River to New Orleans and drove cattle overland to the Baltimore markers. Hugh Jr., left in the early 1820s for Gunter's Landing, Alabama. He became a friend of Chief Gunter an Indian and helped Alabama get a sound economic system in the early life of the State. Most of the first set of Henry children went to northern Alabama as well as Isaac Henry of the second set. Hugh Henry, Sr., a father of 19 children, was kind, patient, sympathetic, with a keen interest and understanding of his fellowmen . He instilled in his children the same feeling for mankind. His slaves were buried in the Henry burial plot, 8th District, Sevier Co., Tenn. near Dumplin Creek, for he said \"If they served me during my life they may rest near by\" . The 'ole Henry plot has the graves of many slaves . This frontiersman was educated according to the documents found and he also handed down Christian Ideals. HUGH leaned strongly to certain Presbyterian beliefs and was a friend of Rev. Samuel Doak . The slaves in the household were not permitted to cook on the Sabbath — all work had to be done in six days. Only the necessities of life were allowed on Sunday. He had Henry's Chapel built on his land about 1784 where the white and colored could worship. Henry's Chapel was used by the settlers as a church and school, later for one week writing schools and the monthly subscription school . The white worshipped in the morning and the colored in the afternoon . The War between the States shifted the political and religious feeling of the settlement. Oak Grove M.E. Church replaced Henry's Chapel and the Henry's Meeting House at Henry's Cross Roads, became Henry's Cross Roads, M.E. Church, South, both located at Kodak, Tenn. Patrick Henry, of the second set, b. 1821 d. 1895, lived at Henry's Cross Roads, on the ole Henry land. He gave lumber to help build the church at Oak Grove, Beech Springs (Baptist) and Henry's Cross Roads Methodist churches. Henry's Chapel and Henry's Meeting House were opened to all denominations for services . From Rocky Valley, in Jefferson County came the Quakers , Isaac and Rachael Jones to conduct their meetings . While tracing our HUGH HENRY we found there were many Hugh Henrys of this period but only one on Dumplin . As for Hugh's parents, the first set of children mentioned in Alabama Histories have many conflicts. For example, Hugh b . 1796 was a son of Hugh b . 1 756 and a grandson of Hugh Henry, of Lancaster Co . , Pa. (Owen's History) . In Moore's history vol 2, p. 537 in giving an account of Ake b. 1804, it says his father was John Henry, a Capt. in the Revolution, from Va . Since Ake and Hugh were full brothers, there is an error. (This information for the History came from the late Judge Oliver D. Street of Guntersville , Ala.) So Hugh Henry, whether a Virginian, Pennsylvanian or an Irishman served his country in many capacities. The old Mansion house including the library burned in 1910 destroying the answer to many questions. HUGH HENRY, SR., b. April 1756 d. 1838 at his home, Henry's Cross Roads, (Kodak, Tenn.) Sevier Co. and his first wife, Mary Long, were married at Jamestown, Va. (The Old Bible was in the possession of the late Nelson Cate of Kodak, Tenn.) Mary Long Henry died between 1805-1813, at Kodak, Tenn. There were at least nine in the first set of children . 1. John Henry 2. James Henry 3. John Henry - No record available on these three. 4.

SAMUEL HENRY (Fourth Child) ( of Hugh and Mary Long Henry) SAMUEL HENRY, b. July 13, 1787 in the State of Franklin, now East Tennessee, was a merchant, and in 1821 was the first postmaster at Henry's Cross Roads . He served under Gen. Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812 . Samuel married Margaret Bryan b. Sept. 19, 1799 and died Aug . 9, 1845 at Henry's Cross Roads, Kodak, Tenn. She was the daughter of ALLEN S. BRYAN. In 1838 Allen Bryan settled the estate of SAMUEL HENRY who died in March 16, 1835 at Henry's Cross Roads. There was a deed which gave an additional half acre of land to make a cemetery adjoining the land on which the Henry Meeting House was located on the road from Brabson's Ferry to Dandridge. This is presently Henry's Cross Roads Methodist Church at Kodak, Tenn. The witnesses to the transaction were Mary and Ahaz Bryan . Samuel and Margaret B. Henry had six children: Three died unmarried and were buried at Henry's Cross Roads in the family plot. Among these was 18 year-old Porter Henry. The other three children were: 1. Mary Ann Henry (Sam , Hugh Sr.) b. Jan. 7, 182 1 at Henry's Cross Roads . She married Aug . 8, 1838 at Henry's Cross Roads to her double first cousin, Albert Gallatin Henry, b . Dec . 6 , 1816 .

This sentiment was found in a letter written by William Upton to his brother-in-law, Hugh Henry, Sr., and sister Polly Upton Henry, in Sept. 1813. 6. HUGH HENRY, JR,. (Sixth Child) (of Hugh Sr. , and Mary Long Henry) HUGH HENRY, JR., b. 4/19/1796, twin of Ruth Henry, (in Owen's History of Alabama , Vol . Ill it gives Henry's Cross Roads, Sevier, Tenn. as place of birth and death at Henrysville, Ala. , April 29 , 1856 . It also states he was a son of Hugh Henry of Sevier Co. , Tenn. and grandson of Hugh Henry, a native of Lancaster Co. , Pa. , who located in Sevier Co., Tenn. and was a Revolution soldier. THIS STATEMENT HAS BEEN CHALLENGED SINCE NO PROOF OF RESIDENCE IN LANCASTER CO. , PA. HAS BEEN FOUND. Story's History of Marshall Co., Ala. p. 34 states that Hugh Henry was a prominent settler before 1830. While p. 76 points out that Hugh Henry, Jr. , was the first white man to have an establishment and sell goods at Gunter's Landing, Ala. about 1829 . Guntersville was a famous stopping place for fleets of lighters or flat boats used to trans¬ port freight down the river from East Tennessee, en route to New Orleans. A group of 8 to 18 boats of whiskey, apples, flour, pork, corn and the like made up the fleet. Before the Treaty of 1836, Hugh Henry, Jr. engaged in business with the Cherokee Nation and was popular with the tribe. He was interested principally in buying native cattle sent by droves to the Baltimore market and merchandise bought with the profits were hauled in wagon to points of shipping on the upper waters of the Tennessee River. By means of barges the merchandise was floated down to Gunter's Landing. Before the day of steamboats and railroads it took months to accomplish such trading. The writer has in her possession a note which reads: \"August the 1st, 1817, Mr. Henry Sr., Sir, please let the barer have two bushels of wheat and I will settle for the same and oblige, your friend. Signed Joseph Routh As a very young man, Hugh Henry, Jr. , started in business on the river using keelboats . Meat, flour, clothes, salt, dyes made from walnut and onion skins, some indigo and tobacco were hauled over land a mile or two to Sinking Springs the old landing place near Henry's Island at the mouth of Dumplin Creek, Sevier County, 8 district, Tenn. With the Henry slaves boats made of native white oak staves and nailed with timber and loaded with cargo were taken down the French Broad River and on to the Tennessee River, a distance of some 200 miles of water to Gunter's Landing, Ala. If New Orleans was the destination Hugh Henry, Jr. , would always stop and trade with Chief Gunter, of the Tribe at Gunter's Landing. In exchange for the food and clothing brought, pelts of fine furs were given by the Chief of the Indians. Gradually the Chief began to like Hugh Henry, Jr. and finally persuaded him to set up business at Gunter's Landing, about 1828 . According to the History of Alabama the first wife was a Tennessean. Family traditions say that he married a - — -Bryan, daughter of Allen S. Bryan and a sister of Margaret Bryan, wife of his brother, Samuel Henry of Henry's Cross Roads. Hugh's young wife, died at childbirth and relatives raised young Albert Gallatin Henry, who was bom Dec. 5, 1816 at Henry's Cross Roads. In 1828 young A. G. Henry at the age of 12 went to Henry's Island, one mile from the present Guntersville, Ala. and set up business with his father Hugh Henry, Jr. The store prior to 1830 was Hugh Henry and son. Later the store was called A.G. Henry in 1841; Col. Sam Henry and A.G. Henry; A.G. Henry and Patrick Henry, 1864; W.G. Henry and brother. The store stands today on the Main St. of Guntersville, Ala. As Marshall County's oldest and most modem Department store. In 1936, Samuel Henry, Jr., grandson of Albert G. Henry was in the hardware business in Guntersville. The story is told that Albert Gallatin Henry, son of Hugh, Jr. , was very anxious that his daughters be financially taken care of at marriage. When his three future son-in-laws came for his daughters hands he required a U. S. Government bond from each. This was about 1870. At. A.G. Henry's death in 1897 the money passed to the daughters or their descendants. Joseph Daniel Bell (Sallie Ann Henry); R.W. Rusk, (Margaret) and D.J. Miller, who married Mary Henry, were the three son-in-laws who had gone to the California Gold rush in '59 and returned about 18 70 . Among the interesting stories told of A.G. Henry is the way he took care of his wife and daughters. His friend A.T. Stewart, a merchant of New York City, through English and French agents selected dresses, gowns, and bootery for his daughters. R.W. Rusk and his bride, Margaret went west and had the first marble mansion in the State of Texas, at Waco. It is said that Rusk brought gold dust from California for a watch, The Howard Watchmakers of Boston made the watch now owned by Joseph Henry of Guntersville. (1936) . In 1865 A.G. Henry was a member of the Alabama Constitutional Convention. With $50,000 he is said to have introduced the credit system in N.E. Alabama and conceived the idea of the mortgage law. He was a Democrat, Methodist and recognized as one of the most skillful reliable, substantial business men in the South. In personal appearance he was over 6 ft. and always immaculately dressed. From an 1880 copy of the Guntersville Democrat (Ala.) newspaper Editor Solomon Palmer had written: \"Among the different cargoes of freight on the WILDER last Saturday was 30,500 pounds of meat for A.G. and Pat. Henry. This is the largest quantity of meat that has been shipped to our city for sometime, and all of it very fine.\" Editor Palmer told of HUGH HENRY, JR. , Guntersville first merchant and father of A.G. Henry, North Alabama's first millionaire. Hugh H. was a great speculator but his good friend and lawyer. Judge Louis Weyth was always ready to advise. The story is told that cotton dropped as low as Hugh H. thought it would, so he bought about 1500 bales at 6£ but it went lower. He shipped it to New Orleans but by the time it got there the price was 5£ . Not to be outdone Hugh H. shipped it to Liverpool and when it got there, he only got 3 1/2 <) . He took his loss in his stride and no one ever heard him discuss it. 12 HUGH HENRY, JR. (Sixth Child) Cont'd (son of Hugh, Sr., and Mary Long Henry) ALBERT GALLATIN HENRY, (son of Hugh Henry, Jr., and - Bryan), was bom 12/6/1816 at Henry's Cross Roads, 8th District, Sevier Co., Tenn. and died at Guntersville , Ala., April 2 , 1897. He returned to East Tennessee and married his double first cousin. Miss Mary Ann Henry, dau. of his uncle, Samuel and Aunt Margaret Bryan Henry, on Aug. 8, 1838. Mary Ann Henry was b. 1/7/1821 and died 1/3/1865 in Alabama . A. G. Henry had three fortunes made and lost before he was 45 years old. A shrewd business man who was always prepared for any emergency. He sent $15,000 in gold to New Orleans to be stored at the beginning of the Civil War. He was against secession but aided soldiers with food and clothing during the Civil War. He owed his life to Col. Sheffield and his slaves who hid him out for days along the Tennessee River - away from the Southerners. It was said that General Butler burned A. G. Henry's cotton in New Orleans. The slaves had help conceal the Henry cotton through out Georgia and Alabama . Thousands of bales were stored at Talledga , Ala. and Columbus, Ga . At the end of the Civil War, Secretary Herbert who later practiced law in Birmingham, Ala. advised the family to file claim for the destruction of property. The statistics accumulated gave over ten million dollars worth of property destroyed. Manoah Henry, son of Ake Henry, assisted his cousin A. G. A mysterious fire burned the files and all evidence was lost. A. G. Henry belonged to the real Southern aristocrats. There were four sons and four daughters. 1.
