        "text": "Alexander Duncan McRae was the manager of Fraser River Lumber Company. He lived at 1960 Robson Street in 1910. (The 1910 Vancouver directory spelled his name as McCrae.)\n\nFamily Background\n\nAlexander Duncan McRae was born in Glencoe, Ontario on November 17, 1874. His parents were Duncan Alexander McRae (1833-1906) and Mary McWhinney (1845–1930).\n\nDuncan McRae died in Glencoe, Ontario on February 11, 1906.\n\nMary McRae died in Glencoe on March 30, 1930.\n\nEarly Years\n\nIn August 1891, Alexander went to the United States. He worked with his cousins, Alexander and Andrew Davidson, who were based in Duluth, Minnesota.\n\nAlexander started a firm that insured grain elevators. His investments were successful, and he became increasingly wealthy.\n\nOn August 15, 1898, he became a naturalized United States citizen.\n\nMarriage to Blaunche Howe\n\nOn February 23, 1900, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Alexander married Blaunche Latimer Howe. She was born in Millerstown, Pennsylvania on August 3, 1877. Her parents were George Coleman Howe (1851-1922) and Mary Elizabeth Johnston (1850-1934).\n\nGeorge Coleman Howe was a prominent businessman who had become wealthy through mining, oil, forestry, milling and other business investments. He died in Minneapolis on July 17, 1922.\n\nMary Elizabeth Howe died in Vancouver on May 15, 1934.\n\nReal Estate Investments in Western Canada\n\nIn the early 1900s, Alexander and the Davidson brothers expanded their activities into the Canadian prairies, especially the Saskatchewan Valley Land Company and the Saskatchewan Valley and Manitoba Land Company. These enterprises, along with other associated businesses, acquired rights to sell vast amounts of Canadian prairie land from the federal government and from railway companies that were active in the area.\n\nThese companies encouraged settlement in the area, and they produced significant profits for Alexander and the other investors.\n\nAlexander and his family appeared in the 1905 Minnesota census.\n\nThey were in Winnipeg, Manitoba at the time of the 1906 Canadian prairies census.\n\nArrival in British Columbia\n\nWhile he was in Winnipeg, Alexander began investing in British Columbia, including fishing and logging businesses.\n\nIn 1910, he was involved with the Canadian Western Lumber Company, which took over further extensive timber interests.\n\nHe became the president of the Fraser River Lumber Company.\n\nIn 1912, the Victoria Daily Colonist published a long article that reviewed the Canadian Western Lumber Company’s operations in British Columbia.\n\nAlexander lived at the following addresses in Vancouver.\n\nIn June 1910, the McRaes moved to 804 Nicola Street.\n\nSoon after the McRaes arrived in Vancouver, Alexander acquired a large lot in Shaughnessy Heights, where he built a large house called Hycroft. Thomas Hooper was the architect.\n\nThe 30-room house became a centre of many society events in Vancouver.\n\nWar Service\n\nDuring the First World War, Alexander became an officer in Canadian military forces. He went overseas with the Second Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and he served in a variety of high-level military positions. In 1917 he became a Commander of the Bath (Military Division).\n\nPolitical Activities and Later Life\n\nAfter the war, Alexander became interested in politics. He became a member of the federal Parliament in 1926. In 1930 he was the organizer of the Conservative Party. In 1931 he became a senator.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the McRaes built a large log house at Qualicum, on Vancouver Island, called Eaglecrest Lodge.\n\nBlaunche McRae died in her suite at the Hotel Vancouver on November 10, 1942.\n\nBlaunche’s funeral was held at Hycroft. She was buried in Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby, British Columbia.\n\nAlexander presented Hycroft to the federal government for use as an auxiliary military hospital. In December 1942, Hycroft’s contents went up for sale at auction. (Charles Edward Dawson (1881-1946) conducted the sale.) In 1962, the house became the home of the University Women’s Club of Vancouver.\n\nMarriage to Louise Rodes and Final Years\n\nOn October 10, 1943, in New York, Alexander married Louise Rodes, who was born Louise Cain in 1890. She had been married earlier to Allen Higgins Rodes (1884-1927).\n\nAlexander died in Ottawa, Ontario on June 26, 1946. He was buried in Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby.\n\nLouise later lived in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nLouise died in Lexington on May 16, 1961. She was buried in Lexington Cemetery.\n\nAlexander and Blaunche had the following children.\n\nBlanche Howe McRae\n\nBlanche Howe McRae was born on March 12, 1904.\n\nOn July 26, 1922, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Blanche married Richard Plunkett Baker. He was born in Donald, British Columbia, on October 18, 1888. His parents were Frederick Francis Baker (1858-1925) and Lucilla Ismina Cooke (1858-1925).\n\nRichard had served with the Royal Air Force during the First World War. While he was in a battle with Manfred von Richthofen, the “Red Baron,” Richard managed to land his airplane, but German soldiers captured him and made him a prisoner of war. After the war he had returned to Vancouver, where he had an importing and exporting business.\n\nIn 1924, Janet Smith, a nursemaid for Richard’s niece, died in mysterious circumstances in Richard’s and Blanche’s house in Shaughnessy Heights. The reason for Janet Smith’s death remained a mystery. After a long and sensational trial, there was no criminal conviction and the case remained officially unsolved.\n\nRichard’s aunt, Lily Lefevre, died in 1938, and Richard and Blanche moved into Lily’s large house on Point Grey Road.\n\nHowever, Blanche later divorced Richard. (Richard became the manager of the Medical Dental Building in Vancouver, and later moved to Qualicum Beach. Richard died in Vancouver on April 1, 1954. He was buried in Qualicum Beach Cemetery.)\n\nOn September 30, 1944; Blanche married Daniel Beynon Lewis in Vancouver. Blanche died in Victoria, British Columbia, on August 31, 1945.\n\nDaniel died in New Westminster, British Columbia on October 19, 1990.\n\nLucile Coleman McRae\n\nLucile Coleman McRae was born on May 3, 1905 (probably in Duluth, Minnesota, although some sources say she was born in Massachusetts).\n\nShe became engaged to Dwight C. Paul.\n\nThe marriage was in King County, Washington, on May 31, 1924.\n\nThis marriage ended in divorce. Dwight died in February 1968.\n\nLucile later married Gordon Howard Willard (sometimes known as “Howard Gordon Willard”).\n\nLucile died in Vancouver on August 29, 1955. She was buried in Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby, British Columbia.\n\nGordon Willard died in Vancouver on December 9, 1966.\n\nDwight Paul and Lucile had a daughter, Blanche Beverly (“Bebe”) Paul (1925-1991).\n\nMargaret (“Peggy”) McRae\n\nMargaret (“Peggy”) McRae was born on January 30, 1906 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nShe studied at Northrop Collegiate school in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nOn February 15, 1926, in Vancouver, she married Walter Seligman, who was a banker.\n\nWalter was born in New York City on February 28, 1894. His parents were David Seligman and Adelaide Walter, who were married in New York in 1878.\n\nDavid Seligman died in August 1897.\n\nAdelaide later married Henry Seligman, who was David Seligman’s brother.\n\nHenry Seligman died in 1933. Adelaide Seligman died in 1934.\n\nWalter and Peggy were divorced. Walter died in Jacksonville, Florida on February 3, 1976.\n\nOn March 20, 1946, in Los Angeles County, California, Peggy married Richard Bruce Hay Chapman, who was in the insurance business. He was born in Los Angeles on March 20, 1897. His parents were Richard Henry Hay Chapman and Laura Lorimer.\n\nRichard died in Santa Barbara, California on February 12, 1971.\n\nPeggy died in San Francisco, California on November 19, 1972.\n\nSources\n\nDuncan A McRae (father of Alexander Duncan McRae)\n\nDuncan A McRae (1833–1906); Birth: 1833, Huntingdon, Quebec, Canada; Death: 11 FEB 1906, Glencoe, Middlesex County, Ontario, Canada (ancestry.ca).\n\n“Canada Census, 1851,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MWTC-C16 : 3 August 2016), Duncn Mc Rae, Ekfrid, Middlesex County, Canada West (Ontario), Canada; citing p. 63, line 31; Library and Archives Canada film number C_11737, Public Archives, Ontario.\n\n“Ontario Census, 1861,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MQQ2-KFZ : 9 March 2018), Duncan Mcrae, Ekfrid, Middlesex, Ontario, Canada; citing p. 46, line 2; Library and Archives Canada film number C-1049-1050, Public Archives, Toronto; FHL microfilm 349,295.\n\n“Canada Census, 1881,” database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MVDV-ZVB : 11 March 2018), Duncan Mcrae, Ekfrid, Middlesex West, Ontario, Canada; citing p. 20; Library and Archives Canada film number C-13269, Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa, Ontario; FHL microfilm 1,375,905.\n\n“Canada Census, 1891,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MWLV-BZV : 3 August 2016), Durand Mcrae, Ekfrid, Middlesex West, Ontario, Canada; Public Archives, Ottawa, Ontario; Library and Archives Canada film number 30953_148155.\n\n“Ontario Deaths, 1869-1937 and Overseas Deaths, 1939-1947,” database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JXPC-859 : 9 March 2018), Duncan A.
