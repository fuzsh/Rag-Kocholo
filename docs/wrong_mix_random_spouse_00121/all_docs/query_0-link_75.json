We found a record of a survey of the Lexington Cemetery (Renamed Stonewall Jackson Cemetery) that was compiled in 1960 that listed several Nuckols/Nuckals buried in two different plots. (See names below). We t hen checked with the cemetery office and was advised that their recor ds of burials is from 1927 in chronological order. Prior to that date, the record of burials is under the plot owners name.

He bought property as early as 1918. L. A. KENNON and G. R. ERGENBRIGHT were co- owners of the hotel and Mineral Hardware Co. Then they apparently went bankrupt in 1922. During this time he also operated a movie theater. Records show him living on the corner of Eighth Street and Mineral Avenue in 1912. We (Richard Kennon) visited Mineral in June of 1998 and saw the house and met the people living in it.\n\nVMI indicates Ashby was in the class of 1921 and that he did not complete the course.

I have found documents that show him as being a minister, and pe rforming marriage ceremonies for several people, including more of the Nuc hols Family. Of course their names were spelled several different ways.\n\nI also have documented proof that he was witness to several esta tes being probated, and as a purchaser of goods being sold at these auctio ns. The 1810 Warren County Census shows Silvester with five males and s ix females in his household, along with nine slaves.Silvester Nuchols w as also shown as taxed in the year of 1811, in Smith's Creek Distric t, in North Carolina, along with a John Nuchols. In the following years ho wever, John was still there, but Silvester was gone. We believe this is t he time that he, Salley, and Thomas came to Blount County, Tennessee, a nd settled in the Crooked Creek Community. Courthouse documents show th ey were one of the first families there.\n\nI believe that Silvester may have been a brother to the John Nuc hols, that he was listed with in 1811, but have not proven this as yet. Si nce descendants have been told that Silvester is buried at the Crooked Cre ek Church Cemetery, several met there on October 1, 1990. Earl Adams dows ed for the graves and the church site. The area is just across Crooked Cre ek ford near Hubbard. A house once sat beside the main road, and a drive l eads off in the corner of a pasture toward the church on a small hill. T wo adults are buried to the left of the drive, and a cemetery containing a bout 15 people (mainly children) is just over the hill.\n\nOn June, 14, 1996, a Thomas Nuchols, 1215 Choctaw, Mt. Pleasan t, Texas, wrote a letter, that stated that Silvester was married twice, a nd had thirteen children. If this is correct, then that would explain a l ot of things......\n\nSylvester's marrige record, his named is spelled Nuckols\n\nWarren Co, NC Tax List 1786- C NUCHOLS\n\n43. 28 March 1796; Ack: Nov.

They traveled in what was called a tandem cart, a two-whee led outfit with shaves, one horse between the shaves, the other horse in f ront attached to the shaves. There was a seat between the wheels for the t wo women, with some space at their feet for equipment. Other equipment w as fastened to the back of the seat. The men rode horses with more equipme nt tied to their saddles. You can judge from the description, that this w as a very scanty outfit.\n\nThere was plenty of game at that time, and they, being of hardy pione er stock, could pretty well live off the land. They came through Cosb y, to the Pleasant Grove Community, near Hubbard Community now is. Since S ally was expecting, and they had traveled many days, Thomas stopped, and m oved into a vacant house, which he later bought. There was four or five hu ndred acres with the house. All of his children was born there, and was so ld, or given portions of the land. Many of the grandchildren were born the re.\n\nThere is evidence that Sally was born in Blount, through the census, b ut other evidence shows she was born in North Carolina.

He looked up the history of Louisville and he found out the our Grandpa Sam Nuckols was the high Sheriff of Louisville/Jefferson County!!! He also told me that (this I am not sure if it was in the Library or something his Mother or Grandma Bishop had told him) That Grandpa Sam, when he was high sheriff would go around and fine people when they need fining and he would take the money and go down south and buy slaves and bring them back to Louisville and set them free.

Evidently, Aly Cole had a son out of wedlock, Charles Edward Cole, which later became Nuckols when Aly married Samuel Nuckols. I heard one time that his biological father's name was \"Lewis Dickerson \" but have never been able to confirm that. Aley Cole was a cousin to the Youngers and James boys They were living in Knox County, KY during the time Charles was conceived. Death certificate, however names father as Samuel Nuckols. Charles Nuckols married Elizabeth Morris in 1897 in Barbaraville, Kentucky and had twelve children: William Henry, James Robert, Amanda Belle, Theodore R., Delia Mae, Arthur, Bertha, Green Bruce, Levi, Dallas, Lelvia Betty, and my grandfather, George Mathew Nuckols, the last born and last to pass on in March of this year. Eventually, Charles and Elizabeth Nuckols wound up in Shawnee, Oklahoma where they lived the rest of their days. Of the twelve children Charles and Elizabeth only nine survived adolescence. George married Annie William Metcalf and had two children, Georgeanne and Darryl Bruce Nuckols, my father.\n\nNote from NWK- This will explain why Charles' descendants do not carrythe Y-DNA from the male that the descendants of William the Patriot carry, E1b1a, African American. The DNA is european and would explain being born out of wedlock.\n\n[DI5956] Shawnee News 7/9/1944\n\nServices Pending for C E Nuckols\n\nC E Nuckols, 73, who came here in 1920 from Kentucky, died at 6:20 p.m. Saturday at his residence, 409 S Pennsylvania.

They put Gains down in a deep pit in the ground and my grandfather, Thomas Nuckles came up at that time and seen what they did to his half-brother and he told them if they were of age what he would do to them. He meant he'd whip them. Anyway, grandfather forgot all about it and years later these 4 young men came to Raleigh Missouri where grandfather was hauling freight from Depowe to up town to store in Raleigh. These 4 men beat my grandfather and would have killed him. But he finally got his knife out and killed all 4 of them in self-defense. Grandfather was driving 4 yokes of oxen with a load of freight. After he killed the 4 men he went to his wife Grandmother Margaret Nuckles and she was in bed with twins, Moses and Ellen Kizzer, and my dad Tom Nuckles was a little boy. So grandmother got up out of bed and fixed his wounds where he was beat and fixed him food and left walking and went to Potoasty, Missouri where uncle Gaines mother and father-in-law was and he hid out and lived I na cave for 6 months. Aunt Becky, uncle Gains wife wore a cape and hid a basket of food under it. She would walk around and go to this cave and take food to him. Then my grandmother, Margaret Nuckles then moved from Raleigh Mo to Patoasty, Mo and traveled with oxen and wagon and then built a house in front of the cave. This cave was at the end of a Mountain.

Bob Nuckles, 1938.\n\n[NI6027] Never located in 1900 census\n\nW.A. Nuckles (written by Bonilee Key Garrett)\n\nAfter his father, William Nelson Nuckles (b.1832), had been killed in t he Battle of Gettysburg(July 1, 1863), William Aaron (W.A.) Nuckles (b. 18 61) of Franklin County, Tennessee, came to Texas with his mother, Mary Ja ne Thompson Nuckles (1837-1894), and his two brothers, Joseph H. (b. 185 6) and Thomas Barbee (b. 1858). The family first settled at Johnson Stati on (now Arlington), Tarrant County, in the 1870's. The two elder brothe rs farmed and traded for a living. In 1884 W.A. Nuckles attended Waco Univ ersity. Around 1888 Joseph and T. Barbee moved to Hardeman County, whe re they engaged in farming, ranching, and the mercantile business. W.A. m oved to Sunset, Montague County, where he also was in the mercantile busin ess. Soon after he moved there, Bonnie Lee Peek (b. 1876, Kaufman Count y) saw him and told her sisters, \"There goes the man I want to marry.\" S he had been attending Kidd Key in Sherman. After their marriage, W.A. a nd Bonnie Lee Nuckles lived in Fort Worth, where Mary Jaane and Willie (Bi llie) Julia were born in 1896 and 1899. The family moved to Eureka Spring s, Arkansas, for a short time for Mrs. Nuckles' health, and Reuben Aile en was born there in 1901. However, Mr. Nuckles soon began investigating f arming and ranching possibilities in Lampasas County. After contacting J. P. Word and Witcher, Mr. Nuckles bought a ranch on the Lampasas River in t he Unity Community, on which a stone house had been built in 1870 by Mr. R .A. Mitchell. The original house consisted of two large rooms join ed by an enclosed \"dog trot\" with a kitchen attached at the rear. Als o, a large stone smokehouse was located a few yards behind the house. F or their growing family, Mr. and Mrs. Nuckles added four bedrooms, a lar ge living room, and two proches. (In 1988 this house belongs to Dr. and M rs. M.K. Patteson). Here Joseph Aaron (b. 1904), Susan Ruth (b. 1905), Pa uline Ida (b.1907), and Nelson James (b.1913) were added to their famil y. The family was affiliated with the School Creek Baptist Church. In t he winter the children attended Unity School, but a governess was hired f or the summers. Billie recounted in later years that the governess seld om could collect more than three or four children to instruct at one tim e; the first ones would run away and hide when she left to find the abse nt ones. As the girls became older they were sent to Baylor Academy in Be lton, a division of Baylor College (now Mary Hardin Baylor), to complete h igh school. The administration even permitted Joe to attend classes, altho ugh it was primarily a school for girls. Later, Mrs. Nuckles would move in to the town of Lampasas for the school year for the younger children to co mplete high school. Mr. Nuckles died in 1924, leaving Mrs. Nuckles to man age the farm and and ranch. Grains and cattle were the money crops then. D uring the harvest extra hands were hired, or neighbors would trade out hel ping one another. the women were very busy cooking and serving hearty mea ls to ten or more men. Also Mrs. Nuckles enjoyed raising turkeys and spe nt many hours walking the fields and riverside searching for the hens' nes ts. When found, the eggs would be clollected and sent tino town to be inc ubated and hatched at Snell's Hatchery. In the 1930's, Mrs. Nuckles beg an raising chickens on a large scale. Her stone chicken houses with elect ricity and running water were quite an innovation for this area. People ca me from great distances to view them. In the 1930's, Mrs. Nuckles' young er brother, Frank Peek, came to live with her and to help with the househo ld. As times were hard during the depression, many mornings \"Uncle Fran k\" would go th the river to shoot squirrels to bring back and fry for brea kfast. In her later years, Mrs. Nuckles spent several winters with her da ughters, Mary J. Longfield in Washington, D.C., and Ruben N. Knox in New Y ork City. While there she enrolled in Columbia University in New Yourk a nd in the corcoran School of Arts in Washington, D.C., where she took cour ses in landscape architecture and in sculpting. In Washington, she beca me ill and returned to her home on the Lampasas river, where she died in 1 952.\n\n[DI6027] Name: «tab»W. N.
