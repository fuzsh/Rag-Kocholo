        "text": "Williams had previously revealed some of the complications she had after giving birth but offered more details about an experience that has since inspired her to speak out about the importance of affordable child care.\n\n\"I almost died after giving birth to my daughter, Olympia,\" Williams, 36, wrote in the opening line of her article.\n\nTennis\n\nFormer coach backs Andy Murray's legacy to live long beyond Olympic farewell\n\n35 minutes ago\n\nWilliams was bedridden for six weeks from a series of complications, including a pulmonary embolism that led to multiple surgeries, after her daughter was delivered by emergency cesarean section.\n\n\"I am so grateful I had access to such an incredible medical team of doctors and nurses at a hospital with state-of-the-art equipment,\" said Williams.\n\n\"They knew exactly how to handle this complicated turn of events. If it weren't for their professional care, I wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nWilliams said her C-section wound popped open due to intense coughing endured as a result of the embolism.\n\nShe had surgery, where doctors found a large hematoma in her abdomen and returned to the operating room for a procedure that prevents clots from travelling to her lungs.\n\nShe went on to encourage people to donate to charities that help mothers and newborns around the world."
