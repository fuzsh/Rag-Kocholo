The 23-time Grand Slam champion wore a custom-made catsuit as she returned to the game at the French Open following the birth of her first child. The suit, albeit specially designed following Williams’ near-death experiencing when giving birth, sparked controversy and was ultimately banned by the French Tennis Federation. It gave an insight into what Williams would do in the world of fashion as she evolved away from the game. And her lead has been admired by many, including college basketball star Angel Reese. As she returns to Paris ahead of the Olympics, Williams has been telling CNN’s Amanda Davies what memories she has of that iconic suit at Roland Garros.",
