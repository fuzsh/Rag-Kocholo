        "text": "In June 2023, Forbes reported that Williams, 42, had an estimated net worth of US$290 million, claiming that she earned nearly US$95 million in prize money by the time she retired from tennis. Her net worth has since jumped by an estimated US$10 million, taking her to the US$300 million mark, according to Celebrity Net Worth and other outlets.\n\nThe tennis legend continues to make money in retirement too. Notably, Williams has diversified her wealth not only through endorsement deals, but also across multiple businesses. Her venture capital firm, Serena Ventures, invests in under-represented founders, including women and people of colour.\n\nWilliams also co-founded Will Perform, a start-up that creates products for topical pain relief and muscle care. Her multimedia company, Nine Two Six Productions, aims to elevate female and diverse stories, with Williams filling the role of producer at the company.\n\nShe may have a bulging bank balance, but Williams is not as flashy as some of her similarly wealthy counterparts. The tennis star has talked about the importance of teaching young people to understand how to spend money and make informed decisions around finance, reported NBC.\n\nShe said she grew up being told that she should never “splurge” and she had the concept of saving money ingrained in her as a rising star by her father, Richard. Per CNBC, Williams took her first prize money and deposited it straight into her savings account.\n\nGrowing her family with husband Alexis Ohanian\n\nAfter becoming a mother in September 2017, the tennis legend got vulnerable with fans about her experiences before and after giving birth. She recounted to Vogue how she experienced difficulty breathing while recovering from the birth of her first daughter, Olympia, and thought she was experiencing a pulmonary embolism – a concern that her medical team didn’t initially take seriously.\n\nWilliams has a history of blood clots and nearly died in 2011 after suffering from a pulmonary embolism. As it turned out, she was right in 2017, and did have multiple clots after giving birth.\n\nIn August last year, she welcomed her second daughter, Adira. Williams then made headlines in February for posting a picture of her post-partum body on social media. After stating that her body was not “picture perfect”, she wrote, “I love that I smell like milk – that milk that sustains @adiraohanian. I love getting to know a new version of my body.”\n\nHer winning fashion\n\nWilliams has been a force for change throughout her career. Whether in terms of race, age or her background, the tennis legend demolished perceptions around female athletes. Her outfits on the court also pushed boundaries. It’s no surprise, then, that Williams continues to attend fashion weeks, getting called a fashion icon with her looks sparking trends."
