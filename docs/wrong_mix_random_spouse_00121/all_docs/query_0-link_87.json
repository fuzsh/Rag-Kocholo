        "text": "Hello Anthony,\n\nI am not researching the genealogy of Asa Wilkins but found some information about him and his family at the Ancestry.com subscription database. Portions of these records come from “Nash County, North Carolina Vital Records Abstracts,” compiled by Cynthia Herrin from a 1909 history of Nash Count. I’ll have more information about this history a little later.\n\nThe first record below notes that Asa Wilkins was born in Nash County in 1830, and that he married a girl namedMarcella who was born in 1850. Marcella’s maiden name or the date of the marriage is not given in this record. But the record shows that Asa and Marcella had children named James, Mary, William, George, Emma, and “Others.”\n\nAsa’s occupation is given as “farmer,” his race is “Negro.”\n\nPlease see below:\n\nNash County, North Carolina Vital Records Abstracts\n\nName: Wilkins, Asa\n\nBirth Date: 1830\n\nBirth Place: Nash CO., NC\n\nMarriage Place: Nash CO., NC\n\nSpouse: Marcella, B. 1850\n\nChildren: James, Mary, William, George, Emma, Others\n\nResidence: Manning, Nash CO., NC\n\nOccupation: Farmer\n\nOther Notes/Race: Negro.\n\nSource Information:\n\nHerrin, Cynthia.

This information comes from Ancestry.com:\n\nAbout Nash County, North Carolina Vital Records Abstracts\n\nCarved out of the much larger Edgecombe County in 1777, Nash County, North Carolina is nestled in the northeast corner of the state. In 1909 a local genealogical group published a series of county histories for the northeastern region of the state. This database is a distillation of vital records from the history of Nash County. Containing the names of over 30,000 county residents, it provides information regarding the individual's birth, parents, marriage, spouse, children, and death. Entries range from before 1800 up through the beginning of the twentieth century. For those Ancestry.com patrons seeking ancestors from North Carolina, this can be an informative database.\n\nFrom the author: In 1777 Nash County, North Carolina was carved out of the much larger Edgecombe County. Nestled in the northeast corner of North Carolina, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Nash was home to many small farms. It lies north of the Tar River and south of Swift Creek and has two towns: Nashville, the county seat, and Rocky Mount. Dozens of small creeks and rivers worm through the coniferous forests and swamps that comprise the landscape. Other than farming, the main industry of the area was turpentine and tar manufacturing, and some lumber operations.\n\nIn 1909, a local genealogical group published a series of county histories for northeast North Carolina. Families of Early North Carolina is separated into three sections. The first section is a narrative describing the people and adventures of the county. This part was enjoyable and gossipy, although I am suspicious of the accuracy of some of the birth and marriage dates provided. The authors may have guessed. However, it was rich with family connections and with personal stories, many of them not complementary to those involved. I briefly included bits that would provide interest (murders, suspected murders, family feuding, illnesses and drunkenness, etc), hoping to tip researchers off to the existence of other family records that might be found in court proceedings or newspapers.\n\nThe second and third sections are a compilation of biographical facts grouped by family. These two parts seem to have been purchased through subscription, with the families providing the data themselves. The second section is made up of white families and the third of black families. While the data abstracted from these sections is probably quite accurate, I have noted irregularities. Often two siblings have differing opinions on family origins, or a child might guess at grandparent's birth date, not realizing how seriously researchers would take them a hundred and fifty years later.\n\nThis database should be helpful to those who have ancestors in the Nash County, North Carolina area. As genealogists interested in the south already know, so many of the primary documents for this area have been forever lost or destroyed. This database helps fill in some blanks spots. Because families didn't move much and inter-married often, discovering one ancestor usually leads to discovering many, many more. This is particularly true in the case of African-American families. The database contains over 30,000 names in a county that for much of this time period only contained about 9,000-10,000 people.\n\nOne final note: the spelling of names in this database are as they appear in the book. The names often don't match up with other available records, but seem to have been tinkered with by the editors of the book. For example, all the Boons, Meltons, and Joiners seem to have become Bone, Milton and Joyner. People in my family who have consistently been labelled as Nicey or Dossey show up as Annice and Dawson. Zobedia seems to have been used instead of Beedie. If you can't find your Sallie, try Sarah, or Martha for Atsey and Patty, and Margaret for Daisey. Names such as Mason, Applewhite, Archie, William and Alsey are used interchangeably for males and females. When the gender is clear I have made a notation, otherwise, be careful of making assumptions. The book from which this database was abstracted came from a collection long held by my family. The books spent decades in boxes in basements and attics and were subjected to harsh conditions, including a flood. Some of them are in very bad condition, held together by rubberbands or in shreds. Until recently I was unaware of how hard to find some of the books might be. It may be the only other copies can be found in old book shops or from out of print dealers. However, I am willing to do look ups when possible or answer questions. For inquiries regarding a specific entry in this database, the provider, Cynthia Herrin, can be contacted by sending e-mail to [email protected].\n\n____\n\nI also found two more marriage entries for Asa Wilkins and Marzilla Holland at Ancestry.com. These are from “North Carolina Marriage Bonds, 1741-1868,” and the “North Carolina Marriage Collection, 1741-2004.” The North Carolina Marriage Bonds show that the bond for their marriage was posted on 5 January 1867 and that they married the following day, 6 January. The bondsman acting as surety on behalf of Asa was Matt Greene. He singed the marriage bond with his “Mark,” most likely because he could not write. The marriage was performed by the Justice of the Peace, G R Marshborn. The witness to the marriage was B H Sorsby, who may have been the county clerk who recorded the marriage, but I couldn‘t tell for sure, as the transcription of the record from Ancestry.com does not appear to be complete:\n\nNorth Carolina Marriage Bonds, 1741-1868\n\nGroom: Asa Wilkins\n\nBride: Marzilla Holland\n\nBond Date: 5 Jan 1867\n\nBond #: 000087111\n\nMarriage Date: 6 Jan 1867\n\nLevel Info: North Carolina Marriage Bonds, 1741-1868\n\nImage Num: 003780\n\nCounty: Nash\n\nRecord #: 01 137\n\nBondsman: Greene Made his Mark Matt\n\nWitness: B H Sorsby (Clerk\n\nPerformed By: G R Marshborn, Justice of the Peace\n\nSource Information:\n\nAncestry.com.

Asa is shown to be a 50 year old mulatto working as a farmer. His place of birth as well as the place of birth for his father and mother is North Carolina. Marzilla is a 30 year old mulatto working keeping house. She and her parents were also born in North Carolina. The children in the household, all born North Carolina, include 14 year old farm laborer James; 12 year old domestic servant, Mary L.; 7 year old William E.; 5 year old George P.; and 2 year old Emma Wilkins.

Asa is listed as a 30 year old black male working as a farmer. His occupation is farm servant and his place of birth is North Carolina. He is also shown to be a “Male citizen of the U.S. of 21 years of age and upwards.”\n\nZillie is listed as a 25 year old black female who is keeping house. She was born in North Carolina.

I didn’t find either of them in the 1860 census in Nash County or anywhere else in North Carolina in the 1860 census, even though there were free blacks and mulattoes living in North Carolina before the Civil War in several county districts, including Mannings, Collins, Dortchess, Sullivans District, and Winsteads.\n\nAs an example, below is the family of“Jno” (John) Wilkins in the 1860 census of free inhabitants of Nash County, living in the Collins District, with a Post Office address of Hillarston. John is shown to be a 30 year old black man born in North Carolina who cannot read or write. The value of his Real Estate holdings is listed as $60. No occupation is given for John. Also in the household is 23 year old Mary Wilkins, a mulatto, also born North Carolina. The two children in the household, both mulatto and both born in North Carolina, are 2 year old Allice Wilkins and 1 year old Harriet Wilkins. The 1860 census does not give the relations of people in the household, to the head of the household, but I would guess that Mary is the wife of John and that Allice and Harriet are their children.\n\nThe transcription of the 1860 census, from Ancestry.com, is below:\n\n1860 United States Federal Census\n\nPage No. 113\n\nSCHEDULE 1.-Free Inhabitants in Collins District in the County of Nash State\n\nof NC enumerated by me, on the 14 day of July 1860.

The 1860 census shows the family of William Wilkins living in the Dortchess District of Nash County, with a Post Office address of Rockymount. William Wilkins is shown to be a 38 year old mulatto, working as a carpenter. The value of his real estate holdings is $300, while his personal estate is worth $10. His place of birth is North Carolina. In the household with him is 41 year old Violaet Wilkins, a black lady born in North Carolina.

The slave schedules can only be used as a guide to finding slave ancestors because these enumerations (for 1850 and 1860) give the names of the slave owners, but rarely give the names of individual slaves.\n\nI didn’t find any slave owners enumerated in the 1860 slave schedules for Nash County named Wilkins or Holland, and so looked for slave owners named Wilkins and Holland in the counties surrounding Nash, including Edgecombe, Franklin, Halifax, Johnston, Wake, Warren, and Wilson.\n\nI located slave owners named Wilkins in Edgecombe, Franklin, Halifax, and Wilson Counties.\n\nThe slave owners in Edgecombe county are Mary Wilkins with 17 slaves; Easter H. Wilkins, with 1 slave; and Antoinett Wilkins with 1 slave.\n\nThe slave owner in Franklin County includes Susan Wilkins with 3 slaves in Franklinton Township.\n\nThe slave owner in the Eastern Division, Halifax County, is B R Wilkins, with 11 slaves.\n\nThe slave owner in Jozners and Gardners, Wilson County, with 14 slaves, is John Wilkins.\n\nThe only information provided about the slaves in these census returns are their ages, genders, and in most cases, their race.\n\nSee the transcriptions that follow from Ancestry.com for these slave schedules for the Wilkins slave owners named in the above counties:\n\nWILKINS SLAVE OWNERS IN EDGECOMBE COUNTY\n\n1860 U.S. Federal Census - Slave Schedules\n\nAge, Gender, Race, Name of Slave, Owner Home in 1860\n\n60, Male, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n42, Male, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n41, Male, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n36, Female, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n36, Female, Black Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n34, Female, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n30, Male, Black, Mary Wilkins Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n28, Female, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n26, Male, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n15, Male, Mulatto, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n15, Female, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n14, Male, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n13, Male Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n10, Male Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n10, Female, Black, Mary, Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n9,Male, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n3,Male, Black, Mary Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n____\n\nAge, Gender, Race, Name of Slave, Owner Home in 1860\n\n11, Male, Black, Easter H Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n____\n\nAge, Gender, Race, Name of Slave, Owner Home in 1860\n\n6, Male, Black, Antoinett Wilkins, Edgecombe, North Carolina\n\n____\n\nWILKINS SLAVE OWNER IN FRANKLIN COUNTY\n\n1860 U.S. Federal Census - Slave Schedules\n\nAge, Gender, Race, Name of Slave, Owner Home in 1860\n\n6, Female, Black, Susan Wilkins, Franklinton, Franklin, North Carolina\n\n4, Male, Black, Susan Wilkins, Franklinton, Franklin, North Carolina\n\n1, Male, Black, Susan Wilkins, Franklinton, Franklin, North Carolina\n\n____\n\nWILKINS SLAVE OWNER IN HALIFAX COUNTY\n\nAge Gender Race Name of Slave Owner Home in 1860\n\n90, Male, Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n56, Female, Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n41, Female, Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n39, Male, Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n26, Male Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n24, Female Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n18, Male, Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n15, Male Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n13, Male, Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n12, Male, Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n2,Female, Black, B R Wilkins, Eastern Division, Halifax, North Carolina\n\n____\n\nWILKINS SLAVE OWNER IN WILSON COUNTY\n\n1860 U.S. Federal Census - Slave Schedules\n\nAge Gender Race Name of Slave Owner Home in 1860\n\n37, Female, Black, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n30, Female, Black, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n22, Male, Mulatto, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n21, Male, Black, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n20, Female, Black, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n12, Female, Black, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n9,Female, Black, John, Wilkins Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n7,Female, Mulatto, John, Wilkins Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n7,Female, Black, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n5,Female, Black, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n5,Male, Mulatto, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n3,Male, Mulatto, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n2,Female, Mulatto, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\n2,Female, Black, John Wilkins, Jozners and Gardners, Wilson, North Carolina\n\nSource Information:\n\nAncestry.com. 1860 U.S. Federal Census - Slave Schedules [database on-line].

Genealogists Franklin Carter Smith and Emily Ann Croom, in their 2003 edition of, “A Genealogist’s Guide to Discovering Your African-American Ancestors,” have this to say about bondsmen:\n\n“Continuing an older practice, some Southern states after the Civil War still required grooms to sign a bond before they could marry. In most of the bonds, the grooms affirmed that they knew of no legal reason that would prevent the marriage from taking place-neither bride nor groom was already married to someone else and neither was below the minimum age. A relative or friend often acted as surety on the bond In the first years after the Civil War, it is at least possible that a surety, or bondsman, was the former slaveholder of the bride or groom.” Page 123.\n\n____\n\nThe question I had concerning Matthew Greene was, did he or his family own slaves in Nash County, North Carolina, before the Civil War of 1861-1865, and if they did, were Asa Wilkins and Marzilla Holland under bondage to him, or was he a friend of Asa Wilkins and not a former slave owner?\n\nTo find out I searched the 1860 slave schedules for anyone named Greene or Green in Nash County, but found that none had owned slaves in the county. But, I did find a Matthew Green and his family in the 1860 census of Free Inhabitants, living the Mannings District of Nash County, with a Post Office Address of Springhope. This may be the Matthew Green who signed the marriage bond for Asa Wilkins.\n\nThe census shows that a Matthew W. Green and his family were white. Matthew is shown to be a 25 year old tarpit laborer, born in North Carolina. The value of his personal estate is listed as $125. In the household with him is 19 year old Caroline Green, born North Carolina. Though the 1860 census does not give relationships of people in the household to one another, I would say that Caroline and Matthew were married. The census also shows the household includes 1 year old Sarah Green, born North Carolina, and 17 year old George Acrey, a tarpit laborer also born North Carolina. Sarah Green would likely be the daughter of Matthew and Caroline. I don’t know if George Acrey was a lodger, or a relative of Matthew’s or of Caroline‘s.\n\nThe 1860 census transcription below is from Ancestry.com\n\n1860 United States Federal Census\n\nPage No. 79\n\nSCHEDULE 1.-Free Inhabitants in Mannings Dist- in the County of Nash, State of\n\nN.

In going through the census I noticed that on the previous page, page 78, a mulatto teen named John Wilkins is living with the family of James Vincent. John Wilkins is listed as 16 years old and born in North Carolina. No occupation is listed for him. James Vincent is a 58 year old farmer whose real estate is valued at $2,500, and whose personal estate is worth $5,900. He was born in North Carolina. He is shown to be over 21 years of age and unable to read and write.\n\nAlso in the household is 78 year old Sarah Vincent, born North Carolina, who is unable to read and write, and Serena Collins, 27 years old, and born in North Carolina.

It seems from that record, which doesn’t appear to be transcribed fully, that B H Scorsby was the Nash County clerk.\n\nThis is proven in the 1860 census, as B H Sorsby and his family are found living in Nashville, where the 58 year old Sorsby is listed as the “County Court Clerk,” whose real estate holdings are shown to be worth $1,500, and whose personal estate is $2,172. He was born in North Carolina. Also in the household is 34 year old Frances Sorsby, who was probably the wife of B H. The household also includes seven children from the oldest, Lucy, at 15, to the youngest, Kate, at 1 year old. All the children were born in North Carolina.

I next wanted to see if I could find him in the 1860 census. I located him and his family under the name George R. Marshborn living in the Mannings District with a Post Office address of Peachtree Grove. In the census however, his occupation is just farmer. He is not shown to also have been a Justice of the Peace. He is listed as 23 years old, whose real estate holdings were worth $2,500, and whose personal estate was worth $1,425. He was born in North Carolina. In the same dwelling as George, but listed as being inseparate lodgings, is 48 year old Louisa Marshborn, who was likely George’s mother. Louisa is shown to be a housekeeper whose real estate value is worth $1,395, and whose personal estate is worth $2,190. She was born in North Carolina and unable to read and write.\n\nLiving in the household with George appear to be his four younger siblings, two borders, and a house keeper.

But the 1850 census of free inhabitants of Nash County show sixty people by the name of Wilkins who were mostly Mulatto, but some also listed as black. The same enumeration for Nash County does not show any white people by the name of Wilkins who were counted in the census.\n\nAn example ofa Wilkins family in the 1850 census includes the household of39 year old farmer John Wilkins, born North Carolina. He is shown to be a mulatto not able to read and write. In his household is 30 year old Sally Wilkins, probably his wife, though, as with the 1860 census, the 1850 enumeration does not give relationships of people in the household to the head of the household. Sally, also a mulatto, was born in North Carolina. The children in the household, all born in North Carolina, and listed as mulatto, are 5 year old Charity; 1 year old Jordan; and a baby named Crawford Wilkins, who wasn’t even 1 year old when the census was enumerated on August 4, 1850. The household also includes a 70 year old black lady named Lucy Wilkins, and 30 year old Lewis Wilkins, both born in North Carolina and both unable to read and write.

The children in the household, all born North Carolina are 2 year old Sallie Ann; 3 year old Polly; and 4 month old Evan:\n\nName, Age, Sex, Color, Occupation, Value of Real Estate Owned, Place of Birth, Person over 20 years of age who cannot read or write\n\nJarratt Wilkins, 51, Male, Mulatto, Cooper, NC, Person over 20 years of age who cannot read or write\n\nSusan Wilkins, 22, Female, Mulatto, NC, Person over 20 years of age who cannot read or write\n\nSallie Ann Wilkins, 2, Female, Mulatto, NC\n\nPolly Wilkins, 3, Female, Mulatto, NC\n\nEvan Wilkins, 4/12, Male, Mulatto, NC\n\n____\n\nIn going over the 1860 and 1850 census returns for Nash County, I wondered what the circumstances were that allowed the black and mulatto Wilkins families to break out of bondage before slavery ended with the passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution on December 6, 1865.\n\nOTHER RECORDS\n\nA relatively new search engine provided by the Latter Day Saints is the Record Search Pilot, which you can access at the Latter Day website at www.familysearch.org:\n\nFrom this search engine I found the death index for John M. wilkins, which shows he died in Mannings, Nash County, North Carolina, on 28 July 1849. His birth year is listed as 1885. His parents were “Ase” Wilkins and “Zillie” Wilkins. His full death record can be found on LDS microfilm number 1926759 for North Carolina Deaths and Burials, 1898-1994. The index follows:\n\nName: John M.

This is for Georgia Sucranna Predgea. She died at age 38 on 12 March 1925 in Mannings, Nash County, North Carolina. Her birth year is listed as 1887. Her parents were “Ase” Wilkins and “Tillie” Wilkins. Her death record can be found on LDS microfilm number 1893460:\n\nName: Georgia Sucranna Predgea\n\nTitles & Terms (Original):\n\nTitles & Terms (Standardized):\n\nDeath Date: 12 Mar 1925\n\nDeath Place: Mannings, Nash, North Carolina\n\nGender: Female\n\nRace (Original):\n\nRace (Expanded):\n\nAge at Death: 38y\n\nEstimate Birth Year: 1887\n\nBirthdate:\n\nBirthplace:\n\nMarital Status:\n\nSpouse's Name:\n\nSpouse's Titles & Terms (Original):\n\nSpouse's Titles & Terms (Standardized):\n\nFather's Name: Ase Wilkins\n\nFather's Titles & Terms (Original):\n\nFather's Titles & Terms (Standardized):\n\nFather's Place of Birth:\n\nMother's Name: Tillie Wilkins\n\nMother's Titles & Terms (Original):\n\nMother's Titles & Terms (Standardized):\n\nMother's Place of Birth:\n\nOccupation:\n\nStreet Address:\n\nResidence:\n\nCemetery:\n\nBurial Place:\n\nBurial Dae:\n\nFuneral Home:\n\nInformant:\n\nAdditional Relatives:\n\nFilm Number: 1893460\n\nDigital Folder Number: 4216520\n\nImage Number: 71\n\nReference Number: cn 412\n\nCollection: North Carolina Deaths, 1906-1930\n\n____\n\nNext, I believe I located a 27 year old William Wilkins in the 1900 census living in Manning, Nash County, North Carolina. This William Wilkins may be the son of Asa and Marzilla. The census shows he is married to 21 year old Nellie. Also in the household is William and Nellie’s daughter, 1 year old Grace.\n\nThe census index follows.

The 1900 census shows that 30 year old James Wilkins, and 17 year old John Wilkins are living in Manning, Nash County.John is listed as James’s brother. James’s wife is 22 year old Lela. Their children are 3 year old Mary, 2 year old Rhoda, and 4 month old Ellen. Also in the household is 15 year old Vannah Wilkins, who is listed as James W. Wilkins’s sister.\n\nThe census index follows:\n\n1900 United States Federal Census\n\nName James W. Wilkins\n\nName: John Wilkins.

Rackley. Volume 1 is entitled “Nash County, North Carolina, division of estate slaves, 1829-1861 ,” while volume 2 is called, “Nash County, North Carolina, division of estate slaves & cohabitation record, 1862-1866 .“ Indexes to both volumes can be downloaded in PDF from the North Carolina GenWeb site at:\n\nhttp://www.ncgenweb.us/nash/african-americans/division-of-slaves-1829-1866/http://www.ncgenweb.us/nash/african-americans/division-of-slaves-1829-1866/\n\nI searched both volumes for any reference to Asa Wilkins and Marzilla/Marcella Holland, but found no information pertaining to them. However, the LDS have filmed slave records for Nash County on two microfilm reels, covering the years 1781-1864. If you are interested in seeing if you can find Asa Wilkins and Marzilla Holland in these records, you can order the films from your nearest Family History Center.\n\nInformation and film numbers follow:\n\nSlave records (Nash County, North Carolina), 1781-1864\n\nAuthors North Carolina.
