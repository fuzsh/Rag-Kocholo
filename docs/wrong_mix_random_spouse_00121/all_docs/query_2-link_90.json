        "text": "Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butler has responded to remarks ESPYs host Serena Williams made about him from the stage during Thursday night’s show\n\nWilliams was joined on stage by sister Venus Williams and Abbot Elementary creator Quinta Brunson to celebrate women in sports.\n\n“So, go ahead and enjoy women’s sports like you would any other sports because they are sports,” Venus Williams said.\n\nSerena Williams added, “Except you, Harrison Butker. We don’t need you.” Brunson then said, “At all. Like, ever.”\n\nThe attack stemmed from Butker’s commencement speech earlier this year at Benedictine College. During his speech, he expressed his belief that some women receiving their degrees were most looking forward to becoming homemakers.\n\nButker, who attended the ESPYs, defended himself on Friday to NBC News.\n\n“I thought Mrs. Williams was a great host and applaud her for using her platform to express her beliefs on a variety of topics,” he said.\n\n“Sports are supposed to be the great unifier, and at an event dedicated to celebrating a diverse group of men and women who have accomplished great feats, she used it as an opportunity to disinvite those with whom she disagrees with from supporting fellow athletes,” he added."
