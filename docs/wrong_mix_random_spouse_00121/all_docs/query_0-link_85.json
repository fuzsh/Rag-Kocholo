Water-withdrawal data for 1995 and 2000 were previously published in Solley and others (1998) and Hutson and others (2004), respectively. This report is a graphical representation of permitted withdrawals for 1995, 2000, and 2005. Public suppliers that are regulated through the Kentucky Division of Water, Water-Withdrawal Permitting Program, withdrew a total of 496, 525, and 558 million gallons per day (Mgal/d) in 1995, 2000, and 2005, respectively. In 2005, 489 Mgal/d (88 percent) came from surface-water sources, and 69 Mgal/d (12 percent) came from ground-water sources. Small increases and decreases in permitted public water-supply withdrawals can be attributed to population changes. Large increases and decreases can be attributed to merging of supply systems, change(s) in source, or purchases from other counties.\n\nEl Centro College Strategic Plan, 2000-2005.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEl Centro Coll., Dallas, TX.\n\nThis is the 2000-2005 strategic plan at El Centro College (Texas).

Data from weekly Arkansas livestock auctions were collected from January 1 to December 31 in 2000 and 2005. Data included calf sex, breed type, color, muscle score, horn status, frame score, fill, condition, health, and BW. Mean selling prices for 2000 and 2005 were $92.91 +/- 15.05 and $118.32 +/- 15.13 (mean +/- SD; $/45.45 kg), respectively. Individual price observations were subtracted from the respective annual means and became the dependent variable. The selling prices for feeder calves sold in groups of 2 to 5 calves and in groups of >/= 6 calves were greater in 2005 than 2000 (P < 0.001). Steers received a greater premium ($6.48 +/- 0.09 vs. $6.02 +/- 0.08; mean +/- SE) and bull calves received greater discounts ($0.30 +/- 0.14 vs. $1.68 +/- 0.09) in 2005 than in 2000. Breeds types that increased in value from 2000 to 2005 were Angus x Hereford, Angus, Angus x Charolais, and Brahman (P < 0.001). Breed types that received a reduced selling price in 2005 compared with 2000 (P < 0.001) were one-fourth Brahman Cross, Charolais, Charolais x Limousin, Hereford x Limousin, Limousin, Limousin x one-fourth Brahman, Longhorn, Saler and Simmental. Yellow-white face, black-white face, black, and gray feeder calves received an increase in selling price from 2000 to 2005 (P < 0.001). Although fewer horned feeder calves were sold in 2005 (P < 0.01), they received greater discounts in 2005 than 2000 (-$2.86 +/- 0.16 and -$0.51 +/- 0.09; P < 0.001). In 2005, large-framed feeder calves did not receive the premium detected in 2000, but medium-framed feeder calves in 2005 received a greater selling price compared with 2000. Feeder calves with a muscle score of 1 received a greater premium in 2005 compared with 2000 ($2.58 +/- 0\n\nAnaemia among Egyptian Children between 2000 and 2005: trends and predictors.\n\nPubMed\n\nAustin, Anne M; Fawzi, Wafaie; Hill, Allan G\n\n2012-10-01\n\nAnaemia remains the most prevalent nutritional disorder among women and children in the Middle East and North Africa region. We examined anaemia trends using data from the Egyptian Demographic and Health Surveys. Between 2000 and 2005, the prevalence of anaemia (defined as haemoglobin concentrations <11âgâdL(-1) ) increased from 37.04% to over 52% among Egyptian children between 12 months and 36 months of age. We examined the associations of these changes with food consumption, vitamin A administration, recent illness, immunization status, socio-demographic factors and a child's anaemic status. Children under the age of 24 months who had recently been sick and those who resided in Upper Egypt were significantly more likely to be anaemic. Despite significant improvements in water and sanitation facilities, maternal education and asset-based household wealth, there were marked declines in the consumption of nutritive foods and increases in the prevalence of childhood diarrhoea between 2000 and 2005. Placing these analyses in the broader context of Egyptian economic trends suggests that the nutritional basket consumed by Egyptian households between 2000 and 2005 may have shifted towards less nutritive foods with lower costs per calorie, probably in response to economic difficulties and increasing food prices. Shifts in dietary consumption, in conjunction with increases in diarrhoea, are likely contributing to the rapid increase in childhood anaemia in Egypt between 2000 and 2005. National-level fortification efforts may be one way to combat rising levels of anaemia among Egyptian women and children.

To examine awareness regarding cancer genetic testing in the U.S. population aged â¥25 years in the 2000, 2005, and 2010 National Health Interview Surveys. The weighted percentages of respondents aware of cancer genetic tests, and percent changes from 2000-2005 and 2005-2010, overall and by demographic, family history, and healthcare factors were calculated. Interactions were used to evaluate the patterns of change in awareness between 2005 and 2010 among subgroups within each factor. To evaluate associations with awareness in 2005 and 2010, percentages were adjusted for covariates using multiple logistic regression. The analysis was performed in 2012. Awareness decreased from 44.4% to 41.5% (p<0.001) between 2000 and 2005, and increased to 47.0% (p<0.001) in 2010. Awareness increased between 2005 and 2010 in most subgroups, particularly among individuals in the South (pinteraction=0.03) or with a usual place of care (pinteraction=0.01). In 2005 and 2010, awareness was positively associated with personal or family cancer history and high perceived cancer risk, and inversely associated with racial/ethnic minorities, age 25-39 or â¥60 years, male gender, lower education and income levels, public or no health insurance, and no provider contact in 12 months. Despite improvement from 2005 to 2010, â¤50% of the U.S. adult population was aware of cancer genetic testing in 2010. Notably, disparities persist for racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with limited health care access or income.

The San Francisco Department of Public Health in partnership with the San Francisco Dental Society and assistance from the National Dental Association, has been conducting annual dental screenings of kindergarten children enrolled in the San Francisco Unified School District since 2000. Outcomes assessed from this series of cross-sectional screenings included prevalence of caries experience, untreated caries, treatment needs, and caries severity by child's sex, race/ethnicity, residential zip code, and a proxy for socioeconomic status. Of 76 eligible schools, 62-72 participated, and 86-92% of enrolled children (n=3,354-3,527) were screened yearly. Although there was a small, significant decrease over the time period, in 2005, 50.1% of children had caries experience; 28.8% had untreated caries and 7.6% had urgent treatment needs. Each year caries prevalence was greatest for Asian children, those attending schools with > 50% children eligible for the free or reduced-price meal program, and children living in zip codes in and around Chinatown and San Francisco's southern border. Despite signs of improvement, caries remains a public health problem especially in Asian and Hispanic children, and children living in certain sections of San Francisco.\n\nChanges in Socio-Economic Inequality in Neonatal Mortality in Iran Between 1995-2000 and 2005-2010: An Oaxaca Decomposition Analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAmini Rarani, Mostafa; Rashidian, Arash; Khosravi, Ardeshir; Arab, Mohammad; Abbasian, Ezatollah; Khedmati Morasae, Esmaeil\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground: Exploring changes in health inequality and its determinants over time is of policy interest. Accordingly, this study aimed to decompose inequality in neonatal mortality into its contributing factors and then explore changes from 1995-2000 to 2005-2010 in Iran. Methods: Required data were drawn from two Iranâs demographic and health survey (DHS) conducted in 2000 and 2010. Normalized concentration index (CI) was used to measure the magnitude of inequality in neonatal mortality. The contribution of various determinants to inequality was estimated by decomposing concentration indices in 1995-2000 and 2005-2010. Finally, changes in inequality were investigated using Oaxaca-type decomposition technique. Results: Pro-rich inequality in neonatal mortality was declined by 16%, ie, the normalized CI dropped from -0.1490 in 1995-2000 to -0.1254 in 2005-2010. The largest contribution to inequality was attributable to motherâs education (32%) and householdâs economic status (49%) in 1995-2000 and 2005-2010, respectively. Changes in motherâs educational level (121%), use of skilled birth attendants (79%), motherâs age at the delivery time (25-34 years old) (54%) and using modern contraceptive (29%) were mainly accountable for the decrease in inequality in neonatal mortality. Conclusion: Policy actions on improving householdsâ economic status and maternal education, especially in rural areas, may have led to the reduction in neonatal mortality inequality in Iran.

To determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium sp and other intestinal parasites in food handlers from Zulia State, one hundred nineteen fecal samples were evaluated by wet mount, concentrated according to Ritchie and modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Fourteen (11.8%) were positive for Cryptosporidium sp and associated with other protozoosis (P < 0.05), being most frequent Endolimax nana (42.9%). The general prevalence of the intestinal parasitism was 48.7%, emphasizing E. nana (41.2%), followed by Blastocystis hominis (38.7%) and Entamoeba coli (17.6%). The most frequent pathogenic protozoa was Giardia lamblia (13.4%), followed by the complex Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar (9.2%). 4.1% were positive for intestinal helminthes. The infection by Cryptosporidium sp is frequent in food handlers from Zulia State. Given to the results of this investigation and the nonexistence of studies in this population, is necessary to deepen in the impact of this parasitism in food handlers and the consumers of their products.\n\n[Case reports of drug-induced liver injury in a reference hospital of Zulia state, Venezuela].\n\nPubMed\n\nMengual-Moreno, Edgardo; LizarzÃ¡bal-GarcÃ­a, Maribel; Ruiz-Soler, MarÃ­a; Silva-Suarez, Niniveth; Andrade-Bellido, RaÃºl; Lucena-GonzÃ¡lez, Maribel; Bessone, Fernando; HernÃ¡ndez, Nelia; SÃ¡nchez, Adriana; Medina-CÃ¡liz, Inmaculada\n\n2015-03-01\n\nDrug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with varied geographical differences. The aim of this prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study was to identify and characterize cases of DILI in a hospital of Zulia state, Venezuela. Thirteen patients with a presumptive diagnosis of DILI attended by the Department of Gastroenterology, Hospital Universitario, Zulia state, Venezuela, from December-2012 to December-2013 were studied. Ibuprofen (n = 3; 23.1%), acetaminophen (n = 3; 23.1), isoniazid (n = 2; 15.4%) and Herbalife products (n = 2; 15.4%) were the main drugs involved with DILI. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen showed a mixed pattern of liver injury (n = 3; 23.1%) and isoniazid presented a hepatocellular pattern (n = 2; 15.4%). The CIOMS/RUCAMS allowed the identification of possible (n = 7; 53.9%), probable (n = 4; 30.8%) and highly-probable cases (n = 2; 15.4%) of DILI. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, isoniazid, isotretinoin, methotrexate and Herbalife nutritional products were implicated as highly-probable and probable agents. The highest percentage of DILI corresponded to mild cases that recovered after the discontinuation of the agent involved (n = 9; 69.3%). The consumption of Herbalife botanical products is associated with probable causality and fatality (n = 1; 7.7%). In conclusion, the frequency of DILI cases controlled by the Department of Gastroenterology of the Hospital Universitario of Maracaibo was low, being ibuprofen, acetaminophen, isoniazid and products Herbalife the products most commonly involved. It is recommended to continue with the prospective registration of cases, with an extended follow up monitoring period and to facilitate the incorporation of other hospitals in the Zulia State and Venezuela.\n\nChanges in Socio-Economic Inequality in Neonatal Mortality in Iran Between 1995-2000 and 2005-2010: An Oaxaca Decomposition Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmini Rarani, Mostafa; Rashidian, Arash; Khosravi, Ardeshir; Arab, Mohammad; Abbasian, Ezatollah; Khedmati Morasae, Esmaeil\n\n2016-09-24\n\nExploring changes in health inequality and its determinants over time is of policy interest.

A.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nSince the first Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite Terra was launched in December 1999 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard Terra began to provide data in February 2000, we have had six-year MODIS global 1-km terrestrial Gross and Net Primary Production (GPP &NPP) datasets. In this article, we present the variations (seasonality and inter-annual variability) of global GPP/NPP from the latest improved Collection 4.8 (C4.8) MODIS datasets for the past six-year (2000 - 2005), as well as improvements of the algorithm, validations of GPP and NPP. Validation results show that the C4.8 data have higher accuracy and quality than the previous version. Analyses of the variations in GPP/NPP show that GPP not only can reflect strong seasonality of photosynthesis activities by plants in mid- and high-latitude, but importantly, can reveal enhanced growth of Amazon rainforests during dry season, consistent with the reports by Huete et al. (2006) on GRL. Spatially, plants over mid- and high-latitude (north to 22.5Â°N) are the major contributor of global GPP seasonality. Inter-annual variability of MODIS NPP for 2000 - 2005 reveals the negative effects of major droughts on carbon sequestration at the regional and continental scales. A striking phenomenon is that the severe drought in 2005 over Amazon reduced NPP, indicating water availability becomes the dominant limiting factor rather than solar radiation under normal conditions. GMAO and NCEP driven global total NPPs have the similar interannual anomalies, and they generally follow the inverted CO2 growth rate anomaly with correlation of 0.85 and 0.91, respectively, which are higher than the correlation of 0.7 found by Nemani et al. (2003) on Science. Though there are only 6 years of MODIS data, results show that global NPP decreased from 2000 to 2005, and spatially most decreased NPP areas are in tropic and south hemisphere.\n\nTrends and outcomes of malignant hyperthermia in the United States, 2000 to 2005.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosero, Eric B; Adesanya, Adebola O; Timaran, Carlos H; Joshi, Girish P\n\n2009-01-01\n\nMalignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal pharmacogenetic disorder with an estimated mortality of less than 5%. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current incidence of MH and the predictors associated with in-hospital mortality in the United States. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample, which is the largest all-payer inpatient database in the United States, was used to identify patients discharged with a diagnosis of MH during the years 2000-2005. The weighted exact Cochrane-Armitage test and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess trends in the incidence and risk-adjusted mortality from MH, taking into account the complex survey design. From 2000 to 2005, the number of cases of MH increased from 372 to 521 per year. The occurrence of MH increased from 10.2 to 13.3 patients per million hospital discharges (P = 0.001). Mortality rates from MH ranged from 6.5% in 2005 to 16.9% in 2001 (P < 0.0001). The median age of patients with MH was 39 (interquartile range, 23-54 yr). Only 17.8% of the patients were children, who had lower mortality than adults (0.7% vs. 14.1%, P < 0.0001). Logistic regression analyses revealed that risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality was associated with increasing age, female sex, comorbidity burden, source of admission to hospital, and geographic region of the United States. The incidence of MH in the United States has increased in recent years. The in-hospital mortality from MH remains elevated and higher than previously reported. The results of this study should enable the identification of areas requiring increased focus in MH-related education.\n\nMineral content of the honey produced in Zulia state, Venezuela.\n\nPubMed\n\nSulbarÃ¡n de Ferrer, BetzabÃ©; Ojeda de RodrÃ­guez, Graciela; PeÃ±a, Jorge; MartÃ­nez, Janeth; MorÃ¡n, MarÃ­a\n\n2004-09-01\n\nThe mineral content of the honey produced in five zones of the Zulia state, Venezuela, during dry and rainy seasons was determined. The analyzed elements were: sodium, potassium (by emission spectroscopy), calcium, magnesium, copper, iron, manganese (by atomic absorption spectroscopy), phosphorus (phosphate ions, by colorimetric method), and ash content of raw honey samples directly collected from different beekeepers. The mean values for Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn, and P were 353+84; 1774+138; 237+66; 52+24; 0.76+0.43; 13.5+10.23; 0.92+0.42 and 1642+323 mg/kg respectively. The mean ash content was 0.431+0.15%. Potassium was the most abundant of the elements determined. This results confirm that Zulian honey can be considered a good source of minerals.\n\nArticles Published in Four School Psychology Journals from 2000 to 2005: An Analysis of Experimental/Intervention Research\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBliss, Stacy L.; Skinner, Christopher H.; Hautau, Briana; Carroll, Erin E.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nUsing an experimenter-developed system, articles from four school psychology journals for the years 2000-2005 (n = 929) were classified.

Compared with white non-Hispanic women, however, Hispanic women have significantly lower cancer screening rates. Programs designed to increase cancer screening rates, including the national Screen for Life campaign, which specifically promoted colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, regional educational/research programs, and state cancer control programs, have been launched. Screen for Life and some of these other intervention programs have targeted Hispanic populations by providing educational materials in Spanish in addition to English. The objective of this study was to compare changes in colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening rates from 2000 to 2005 among Hispanic and white non-Hispanic women, using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The age ranges of study subjects and the definitions of cancer screening were site specific and based on the American Cancer Society (ACS) screening recommendations. Although overall screening rates were found to be lower among Hispanic women, CRC screening increased about 1.5-fold among both Hispanic and white non-Hispanic women, mainly driven by endoscopic screening, which increased 2.1-fold and 2.9-fold, respectively, from 2000 to 2005 (pâ<â0.01). Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) for CRC declined among white non-Hispanic women and remained stable among Hispanic women during the same period. Mammogram and Pap smear screening tended to decline during the study period for both ethnic groups, especially white non-Hispanic women. Although cancer screening rates may be affected by multiple factors, culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate national educational programs may have contributed to the increase in endoscopic CRC screening compliance.\n\nEstimated use of water in Alabama in 2005\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHutson, Susan S.; Littlepage, Thomas M.; Harper, Michael J.; Tinney, James O.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTotal water withdrawals decreased less than 1 percent from 9,990 Mgal/d in 2000 to 9,958 Mgal/d in 2005. Surface-water withdrawals decreased less than 5 percent from 9,950 Mgal/d in 2000 to 9,467 Mgal/d in 2005. In contrast, ground-water withdrawals increased about 12 percent from 440 Mgal/d in 2000 to 491 Mgal/d in 2005. By category, increases in irrigation (118 Mgal/d, about 274 percent), thermoelectric power (84 Mgal/d, about 1 percent), and aquaculture (65 Mgal/d, 620 percent) were offset by declines in self-supplied industrial (283 Mgal/d, about 34 percent), self-supplied residential (40 Mgal/d, about 50 percent); and public supply (32 Mgal/d, about 4 percent) from 2000 to 2005. Water use for livestock and mining was not estimated in 2000.\n\nSatellite-derived, melt-season surface temperature of the Greenland Ice Sheet (2000-2005) and its relationship to mass balance\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHall, D.K.; Williams, R.S.; Casey, K.A.; DiGirolamo, N.E.; Wan, Z.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nMean, clear-sky surface temperature of the Greenland Ice Sheet was measured for each melt season from 2000 to 2005 using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)âderived land-surface temperature (LST) data-product maps. During the period of most-active melt, the mean, clear-sky surface temperature of the ice sheet was highest in 2002 (â8.29 Â± 5.29Â°C) and 2005 (â8.29 Â± 5.43Â°C), compared to a 6-year mean of â9.04 Â± 5.59Â°C, in agreement with recent work by other investigators showing unusually extensive melt in 2002 and 2005. Surface-temperature variability shows a correspondence with the dry-snow facies of the ice sheet; a reduction in area of the dry-snow facies would indicate a more-negative mass balance. Surface-temperature variability generally increased during the study period and is most pronounced in the 2005 melt season; this is consistent with surface instability caused by air-temperature fluctuations.\n\nInternet cigarette purchasing among 9th grade students in western New York: 2000-2001 vs. 2004-2005.\n\nPubMed\n\nFix, Brian V; Zambon, Margaret; Higbee, Cheryl; Cummings, K Michael; Alford, Terry; Hyland, Andrew\n\n2006-09-01\n\nTo assess trends and correlates of youth cigarette purchasing behavior on the Internet. In 2000-2001, Roswell Park Cancer Institute conducted a survey asking 7,019 ninth grade students in Erie and Niagara Counties in New York State about their tobacco use and purchasing habits, including use of the Internet to buy cigarettes. The 2004-2005 survey is a replication of the 2000-2001 survey. Both surveys used an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire survey. These data were combined in order to examine trends in youth smoking behavior. Students surveyed in 2004-2005 were 2.6 times more likely (95% CI: 1.5, 4.6) to have purchased cigarettes over the Internet in the 30 days prior to the survey than those surveyed in 2001 (5.2% to 1.6%); however, the intention to use the Internet as a cigarette source in the future did not change between survey periods. Youth online cigarette purchasing has increased but intention to use the Internet to purchase cigarettes in the future has remained the same, suggesting that this trend may be reaching a plateau. Recent public efforts to reduce online cigarette sales will need to be evaluated in order to determine which policy or combination of policies are most effective.\n\nPrevalence and risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia in White, Black, Amerindian and Mixed Hispanics in Zulia State, Venezuela.\n\nPubMed\n\nFlorez, Hermes; Silva, EglÃ©; FernÃ¡ndez, Virginia; Ryder, Elena; SulbarÃ¡n, Tulio; Campos, Gilberto; CalmÃ³n, Gustavo; Clavel, Emilio; Castillo-Florez, Sumaya; Goldberg, Ronald\n\n2005-07-01\n\nStudies have highlighted the association between insulin resistance (IR) and several cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, including hypertension (HTN), obesity, dyslipidemia (i.e. high triglyceride and low HDL-cholesterol) and glucose intolerance, in a cluster known as the metabolic syndrome (MS). There are few data on the frequency of the MS and dyslipidemia in developing countries, and none in South America. To estimate the prevalence of the MS and its components in Zulia State, Venezuela, and to establish associated demographic and clinical factors, we evaluated 3108 Hispanic men and women aged 20 years or older from a cross-sectional survey of a random representative sample from each health district in Zulia State, Venezuela (1999-2001). Prevalence of the MS and dyslipidemia was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)/Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria. The age-adjusted prevalence of MS and dyslipidemia was 31.2% and 24.1%, respectively, with higher rates in men than in women. Prevalence rates increased with age and with the degree of obesity. MS prevalence was lower in Amerindian (17.%) compared to Black (27.2%), White (33.3%) and Mixed (37.4%) men, but no differences were found among women. Overall, low HDL-cholesterol (65.3%), abdominal obesity (42.9%) and HTN (38.1%) were the most frequent MS components. After adjusting for age, sex and race groups, family history of diabetes, obesity and HTN were associated with the MS. Sedentary lifestyle also increased the risk of MS, event after adjusting for the same covariates, obesity and the degree of IR. These results suggest that MS is found in approximately one-third of the Venezuelan adult population in Zulia State, with higher prevalence in men related to the presence of dyslipidemia. Lifestyle interventions in MS subjects are needed in Venezuela to halt the burden of CV disease and diabetes.\n\nMolecular Epidemiology of Norovirus Outbreaks in Norway during 2000 to 2005 and Comparison of Four Norovirus Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase PCR Assays\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVainio, Kirsti; Myrmel, Mette\n\n2006-01-01\n\nDuring the period from January 2000 to August 2005 a total of 204 outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis were diagnosed at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. A clear increase in the norovirus activity was seen in healthcare institutions during the winter seasons. Polymerase sequence analysis of norovirus strains from 122 outbreaks showed that 112 were caused by GII strains (91.8%). Two norovirus variants seen during the study periodâGIIb and GII.4âwere predominant between January 2000 and September 2002, whereas GII.4 was predominant from September 2002 onward. The highest norovirus activity was seen during the 2002-2003 and 2004-2005 seasons with the emergence of new GII.4 variants. This study describes the molecular epidemiology of norovirus strains circulating in Norway during the five previous seasons and compares four norovirus real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays. A suitable assay for routine diagnostics is suggested.

Between 2000 and 2005, a total of 345 individual claims comprising 221 different exposure incidents were identified for the 6-year time period. The construction industry had 43 (20%) CO incidents, followed by wholesale trade with 32 (15%), and agriculture with 27 (12%) incidents. Fuel-powered forklifts caused 29% of all incidents, while autos/trucks/buses were responsible for 26%. The number of forklift incidents in fruit packing and cold storage companies declined significantly from 1994 through 2007 (Spearman's rho = 0.6659, p < 0.01). While this study used multiple medical records from workers' compensation claims to identify CO poisoning, a surveillance system that lacks extensive medical records may rely principally on carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) tests. This study demonstrated that 71% of the identified workers' compensation claims had associated COHb tests. The recurrence and timing of CO poisoning as well as control of the CO-generating source were determined. Approximately 8% of all work sites had recurring CO poisoning incidents. Two percent experienced a recurrent incident within 16 days of the initial incident, and 6% experienced a recurrent incident between 16 days and 3 years after the initial incident. Sixty-seven percent of claimants exposed to CO were not in direct control of the CO-generating source; this has implications for CO prevention and underscores the need for all employees to be trained on CO hazards.\n\nWinter distribution of euphausiids ( Euphausiacea) in the Barents Sea (2000-2005)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhukova, Natalia G.; Nesterova, Valentina N.; Prokopchuk, Irina P.; Rudneva, Galina B.\n\n2009-10-01\n\nThe purpose of the study is to analyze the state of the Barents Sea euphausiids populations in the warm period (2000-2005) based on the study of their structure dynamics and distribution under the influence of abiotic and biotic factors. For estimation of their aggregations in the bottom layer, the traditional method was used with the help of the modified egg net (0.2 m 2 opening area, 564 Î¼m mesh size). The net is used for collecting euphausiids in the autumn-winter period when their activity is reduced, which results in high-catch efficiency. The findings confirmed the major formation patterns of the euphausiids species composition associated with climate change in the Arctic basin. As before, in the warm years, one can see a clear-cut differentiation of space distribution of the dominant euphausiids Thysanoessa genus with localization of the more thermophilic Thysanoessa inermis in the north-west Barents Sea and Thysanoessa raschii in the east. The major euphausiids aggregations are formed of these species. In 2004, the first data of euphausiids distribution in the northern Barents Sea (77-79Â°N) were obtained, and demonstrated extremely high concentrations of T. inermis in this area, with the biomass as high as 1.7-2.4 g m -2 in terms of dry weight. These data have improved our knowledge of the distribution and euphausiids abundance during periods of elevated sea-water temperatures in the Barents Sea. The oceanic Atlantic species were found to increase in abundance due to elevated advection to the Barents Sea during the study period. Thus, after nearly a 30-year-long absence of the moderate subtropical Nematoscelis megalops in the Barents Sea, they were found again in 2003-2005. However in comparison with 1960, the north-east border of its distribution considerably shifted to 73Â°50'N 50Â°22'E. The portion of Meganyctiphanes norvegica also varied considerablyâfrom 10% to 20% of the total euphausiids population in the warm 1950s-1960s almost to complete\n\nExplaining the unexpected success of the smoking ban in Italy: political strategy and transition to practice, 2000â2005.\n\nPubMed\n\nMele, Valentina; Compagni, Amelia\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe approval (2003) and enforcement (2005) of a smoking ban in Italy have been viewed by many as an unexpectedly successful example of policy change. The present paper, by applying a processualist approach, concentrates on two policy cycles between 2000 and 2005. These had opposing outcomes: an incomplete decisional stage and an authoritative decision, enforced two years later. Through the analysis of the different phases of agenda setting, alternative specification and decision making, we have compared the quality of participation of policy entrepreneurs in the two cycles, their political strategies and, in these, the relevance of issue image. The case allows us to direct the attention of scholars and practitioners to an early phase of the policy implementation process â which we have named \"transition to practice\". This, managed with political strategy, might have strongly contributed to the final successful policy outcome.\n\nCritical care medicine in the United States 2000-2005: an analysis of bed numbers, occupancy rates, payer mix, and costs.\n\nPubMed\n\nHalpern, Neil A; Pastores, Stephen M\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTo analyze the evolving role, patterns of use, and costs of critical care medicine in the United States from 2000 to 2005. Retrospective study of data from the Hospital Cost Report Information System (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Baltimore, Maryland). Nonfederal, acute care hospitals with critical care medicine beds in the United States. None. None. We analyzed hospital and critical care medicine beds, bed types, days, occupancy rates, payer mix (Medicare and Medicaid), and costs. Critical care medicine costs were compared with national cost indexes. Between 2000 and 2005, the total number of U.S. hospitals with critical care medicine beds decreased by 12.2% (from 3,586 to 3,150). Although the number of hospital beds decreased by 4.2% (from 655,785 to 628,409), both hospital days and occupancy rates increased by 5.1% (from 145.1 to 152.5 million) and 13.7% (from 59% to 67%), respectively. Critical care medicine beds increased by 6.5% (from 88,252 to 93,955), days by 10.6% (from 21.0 to 23.2 million), and occupancy rates by 4.5% (from 65% to 68%). The majority (90%) of critical care medicine beds were classified as intensive care, premature/neonatal, and coronary care unit beds. The percentage of critical care medicine days used by Medicare decreased by 3.8% (from 37.9% to 36.5%) compared with an increase of 15.5% (from 14.5% to 16.8%) by Medicaid. From 2000 to 2005, critical care medicine costs per day increased by 30.4% (from $2698 to $3518). Although annual critical care medicine costs increased by 44.2% (from $56.6 to $81.7 billion), the proportion of hospital costs and national health expenditures allocated to critical care medicine decreased by 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. However, the proportion of the gross domestic product used by critical care medicine increased by 13.7%. In 2005, critical care medicine costs represented 13.4% of hospital costs, 4.1% of national health expenditures, and 0.66% of the gross domestic product.

The objectives of this study were to describe activities of state and local immunization programs that sustained high coverage levels across several years and to identify common themes and practical examples for sustaining childhood vaccination coverage rates that could be applied elsewhere. We conducted 95 semi-structured key informant interviews with internal staff members and external partners at the 10 immunization programs with the highest sustained childhood immunization coverage from 2000 to 2005, as measured by the National Immunization Survey. Interview transcripts were analyzed qualitatively using a general inductive approach. Common themes across the 10 programs included maintaining a strong program infrastructure, using available data to drive planning and decision making, a commitment to building and sustaining relationships, and a focus on education and communication. Given the challenges of an increasingly complex immunization system, the lessons learned from these programs may help inform others who are working to improve childhood immunization delivery and coverage in their own programs.\n\nDeterminacion de periodos fundamentales del suelo mediante vibraciones ambientales en el municipio de Humacao, Puerto Rico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCintron Aponte, Rommel\n\nLa tecnica de Nakamura ha sido utilizada a nivel mundial para determinar periodos fundamentales del suelo. La tecnica consiste en calcular y graficar cocientes espectrales H/V de vibraciones ambientales registradas sobre el suelo. Mediciones de vibraciones ambientales fueron tomadas en 151 lugares dentro del municipio de Humacao, localizado al este de Puerto Rico. Los datos se procesaron utilizando espectros de Fourier y espectros de potencia. La tecnica fue validada al compararla con los resultados de cocientes espectrales H/V de registros de sismos debiles y tambien con una modelacion numerica realizada con datos de un ensayo \"downhole\". Las graficas de los cocientes espectrales H/V fueron divididas en casos y grupos, los cuales dependen de la facilidad para identificar el periodo fundamental pico y amplitudes en frecuencias menores de 1 Hz, respectivamente. Los resultados obtenidos con ambos espectros fueron comparados y se concluye que los mismos se complementan para proveer resultados mas confiables. Se crearon mapas de periodos fundamentales, factores de amplitud, isoperiodos y clasificacion sismica de sitio. Los mapas de isoperiodos fueron realizados en las zonas mas pobladas sobre depositos de suelo. El mapa de periodos fundamentales del suelo mostro buena correlacion con la geologia local. El mapa de clasificacion sismica derivado de periodos de sitio fue comparado con el mapa de clasificacion sismica derivado de barrenos geotecnicos. El mapa de clasificacion obtenido de periodos puede sobreestimar un poco algunas clasificaciones del suelo. Sin embargo, este mapa puede proveer un estimado aproximado de la velocidad de onda de corte promedio del suelo hasta una profundidad de 100 pies (30 metros).\n\nWater withdrawals, wastewater discharge, and water consumption in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin, 2005, and water-use trends, 1970-2005\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMarella, Richard L.; Fanning, Julia L.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn 2000, an estimated 49 percent of the water withdrawn for public supply in the basin was consumed, and the remaining 51 percent was returned to the hydrologic system through wastewater treatment systems. In 2005, an estimated 38 percent was consumed and 62 percent was returned to the hydrologic system. This contrast between water withdrawals and wastewater discharges for these years was caused primarily by below-average rainfall during 2000 (a dry year) and above-average rainfall during 2005 (a wet year).\n\nAccelerated deforestation in the humid tropics from the 1990s to the 2000s\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Do-Hyung; Sexton, Joseph O.; Townshend, John R.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nUsing a consistent, 20 year series of high- (30 m) resolution, satellite-based maps of forest cover, we estimate forest area and its changes from 1990 to 2010 in 34 tropical countries that account for the majority of the global area of humid tropical forests. Our estimates indicate a 62% acceleration in net deforestation in the humid tropics from the 1990s to the 2000s, contradicting a 25% reduction reported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Forest Resource Assessment. Net loss of forest cover peaked from 2000 to 2005. Gross gains accelerated slowly and uniformly between 1990-2000, 2000-2005, and 2005-2010. However, the gains were overwhelmed by gross losses, which peaked from 2000 to 2005 and decelerated afterward. The acceleration of humid tropical deforestation we report contradicts the assertion that losses decelerated from the 1990s to the 2000s.\n\nTrends of Modern Contraceptive Use among Young Married Women Based on the 2000, 2005, and 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys: A Multivariate Decomposition Analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWorku, Abebaw Gebeyehu; Tessema, Gizachew Assefa; Zeleke, Atinkut Alamirrew\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntroduction Accessing family planning can reduce a significant proportion of maternal, infant, and childhood deaths. In Ethiopia, use of modern contraceptive methods is low but it is increasing. This study aimed to analyze the trends and determinants of changes in modern contraceptive use over time among young married women in Ethiopia. Methods The study used data from the three Demographic Health Surveys conducted in Ethiopia, in 2000, 2005, and 2011. Young married women age 15â24 years with sample sizes of 2,157 in 2000, 1,904 in 2005, and 2,146 in 2011 were included. Logit-based decomposition analysis technique was used for analysis of factors contributing to the recent changes. STATA 12 was employed for data management and analyses. All calculations presented in this paper were weighted for the sampling probabilities and non-response. Complex sampling procedures were also considered during testing of statistical significance. Results Among young married women, modern contraceptive prevalence increased from 6% in 2000 to 16% in 2005 and to 36% in 2011. The decomposition analysis indicated that 34% of the overall change in modern contraceptive use was due to difference in womenâs characteristics. Changes in the composition of young womenâs characteristics according to age, educational status, religion, couple concordance on family size, and fertility preference were the major sources of this increase. Two-thirds of the increase in modern contraceptive use was due to difference in coefficients. Most importantly, the increase was due to change in contraceptive use behavior among the rural population (33%) and among Orthodox Christians (16%) and Protestants (4%). Conclusions Modern contraceptive use among young married women has showed a remarkable increase over the last decade in Ethiopia. Programmatic interventions targeting poor, younger (adolescent), illiterate, and Muslim women would help to maintain the increasing trend in modern contraceptive use.

However, exposure is not isolated to a single environmental factor, but rather to many positive and negative factors that co-occur. The environmental quality index (EQI), a measure of cumulative environmental exposure across all US counties from 2000-2005, was used to investigate associations between ambient environment and PTB. With 2000-2005 birth data from the National Center for Health Statistics for the United States (nâ=â24,483,348), we estimated the association between increasing quintiles of the EQI and county-level and individual-level PTB; we also considered environmental domain-specific (air, water, land, sociodemographic and built environment) and urban-rural stratifications. Effect estimates for the relationship between environmental quality and PTB varied by domain and by urban-rural strata but were consistent across county- and individual-level analyses. The county-level prevalence difference (PD (95% confidence interval) for the non-stratified EQI comparing the highest quintile (poorest environmental quality) to the lowest quintile (best environmental quality) was -0.0166 (-0.0198, -0.0134). The air and sociodemographic domains had the strongest associations with PTB; PDs were 0.0196 (0.0162, 0.0229) and -0.0262 (-0.0300, -0.0224) for the air and sociodemographic domain indices, respectively. Within the most urban strata, the PD for the sociodemographic domain index was 0.0256 (0.0205, 0.0307). Odds ratios (OR) for the individual-level analysis were congruent with PDs. We observed both strong positive and negative associations between measures of broad environmental quality and preterm birth. Associations differed by rural-urban stratum and by the five environmental domains. Our study demonstrates the use of a large scale composite environment exposure metric with preterm birth, an important indicator of population health and shows potential for future\n\nClosing Doors of Opportunity?

R.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nEstimates of the rate of production of excited oxygen atoms due to the photolysis of ozone J(O1D) have been derived from radiation measurements carried out at Cape Grim, Tasmania (40.6Â° S, 144.7Â° E). These estimates agree well with measurements made during SOAPEX-II and with model estimates of clear sky photolysis rates. Observations spanning 2000-2005 have been used to quantify the impact of season, cloud and ozone column amount. The annual cycle of J(O1D) has been investigated via monthly means. These means show an inter-annual variation (monthly standard deviation) of 9%, but in midsummer and midwinter this reduces to 3-4%. Factors dependent upon solar zenith angle and satellite derived total ozone column explain 87% of the observed signal variation of the individual measurements. The impact of total column ozone, expressed as a Radiation Amplification Factor (RAF), is found to be ~1.45, in agreement with model estimates. This ozone dependence explains 20% of the variation observed at medium solar zenith angles (30-50Â°). The impact of clouds results in a median reduction of 14% in J(O1D) for the same solar zenith angle range. At all solar zenith angles less than 50Â° approximately 10% of measurements show enhanced J(O1D) due to cloud scattering and this fraction climbs to 25% at higher solar angles. Including estimates of cloudiness derived from Long Wave Radiation measurements resulted in a statistically significant fit to observations but the quality of the fit did not increase significantly as measured by the reduced R2.\n\nSports participation increased in Spain: a population-based time trend study of 21 381 adults in the years 2000, 2005 and 2010.\n\nPubMed\n\nPalacios-CeÃ±a, Domingo; Fernandez-de-Las-PeÃ±as, Cesar; HernÃ¡ndez-Barrera, ValentÃ­n; JimÃ©nez-Garcia, Rodrigo; Alonso-Blanco, Cristina; Carrasco-Garrido, Pilar\n\n2012-12-01\n\nTo assess the trend in prevalence of Spanish adults who engaged in sports activities from 2000 to 2010. Retrospective analysis of three population-based cross-sectional surveys conducted on a representative sample of Spanish adults: 2000 (N=5160), 2005 (N=8170) and 2010 (N=8925). The overall prevalence of sport-active men increased from 45.8% to 52.12% between 2000 and 2010. Among women the prevalence also increased from 27.26% to 33.27% (adjusted OR 1.03 95% CI 1.02 to 1.04). A significant decrease in the prevalence of sport-active subjects was found as the age increases. Adjusted time trends analysis showed that the prevalence of sport-active women and men increased over time in all age groups, with exception of women aged 15-25 years (adjusted OR 0.99, 0.97 to 1.01). Higher educational level was associated with more sport activity. The first reason for not practising sport was 'I have no time due to working or studying'. Less than 10% of women and men reported health problems as the reason for not practising any sport. Sports participation in Spain has increased between 2000 and 2010 among young-aged and middle-aged adults and decreased among older people. Women showed lower prevalence of sport activity as compared to men.\n\nHealth benefits in 2005: premium increases slow down, coverage continues to erode.\n\nPubMed\n\nGabel, Jon; Claxton, Gary; Gil, Isadora; Pickreign, Jeremy; Whitmore, Heidi; Finder, Benjamin; Hawkins, Samantha; Rowland, Diane\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis paper reports findings on the state of job-based health insurance in spring 2005 and how it has changed during recent years.

Included in the comparison are estimates of TOA reflectance variability from published ground-based Earthshine observations and from new satellite-based CERES, MODIS and ISCCP results. The ground-based Earthshine data show an order-of-magnitude more variability in annual mean SW TOA flux than either CERES or ISCCP, while ISCCP and CERES SW TOA flux variability is consistent to 40%. Most of the variability in CERES TOA flux is shown to be dominated by variations global cloud fraction, as observed using coincident CERES and MODIS data. Idealized Earthshine simulations of TOA SW radiation variability for a lunar-based observer show far less variability than the ground-based Earthshine observations, but are still a factor of 4-5 times more variable than global CERES SW TOA flux results. Furthermore, while CERES global albedos exhibit a well-defined seasonal cycle each year, the seasonal cycle in the lunar Earthshine reflectance simulations is highly variable and out-of-phase from one year to the next. Radiative transfer model (RTM) approaches that use imager cloud and aerosol retrievals reproduce most of the change in SW TOA radiation observed in broadband CERES data. However, assumptions used to represent the spectral properties of the atmosphere, clouds, aerosols and surface in the RTM calculations can introduce significant uncertainties in annual mean changes in regional and global SW TOA flux.\n\nVariability in global top-of-atmosphere shortwave radiation between 2000 and 2005\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLoeb, Norman G.; Wielicki, Bruce A.; Rose, Fred G.; Doelling, David R.\n\n2007-02-01\n\nMeasurements from various instruments and analysis techniques are used to directly compare changes in Earth-atmosphere shortwave (SW) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation between 2000 and 2005. Included in the comparison are estimates of TOA reflectance variability from published ground-based Earthshine observations and from new satellite-based CERES, MODIS and ISCCP results. The ground-based Earthshine data show an order-of-magnitude more variability in annual mean SW TOA flux than either CERES or ISCCP, while ISCCP and CERES SW TOA flux variability is consistent to 40%. Most of the variability in CERES TOA flux is shown to be dominated by variations global cloud fraction, as observed using coincident CERES and MODIS data. Idealized Earthshine simulations of TOA SW radiation variability for a lunar-based observer show far less variability than the ground-based Earthshine observations, but are still a factor of 4-5 times more variable than global CERES SW TOA flux results. Furthermore, while CERES global albedos exhibit a well-defined seasonal cycle each year, the seasonal cycle in the lunar Earthshine reflectance simulations is highly variable and out-of-phase from one year to the next. Radiative transfer model (RTM) approaches that use imager cloud and aerosol retrievals reproduce most of the change in SW TOA radiation observed in broadband CERES data. However, assumptions used to represent the spectral properties of the atmosphere, clouds, aerosols and surface in the RTM calculations can introduce significant uncertainties in annual mean changes in regional and global SW TOA flux.\n\n[Radiological estimation of the protective measures used in agricultural complex of Belarus Republic in 2000-2005 (20 years after the accident on the Chernobyl NPP)].\n\nPubMed\n\nPodoliak, A G; Bogdevich, I M; Ageets, V Iu; Timofeev, S F\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe radiological estimation of the basic agrochemistry measures spent for the agriculture of the Republic of Belarus in 2000-2005 is given.

While the struggle for democracy may have overshadowed the enormity of the unfolding HIV epidemic, there was also a delay in constructive religious responses to it early on. In 1990, HIV/AIDS was declared a Catholic institutional focus, and by 2000 the Church had established the largest system of care and treatment in the country besides that of the government. However, the Catholic Church suffered severe criticism on account of its anti-condom policy to HIV prevention. As a result, the institutional Church underwent both organisational and ideological changes in an attempt to adapt to the contextual challenges brought about by HIV and AIDS. Informed by archival collections and oral sources, this article endeavours to critically analyse the HIV/AIDS-related care and treatment activities of the Catholic Church in South Africa between 2000 and 2005. It argues that the complex interplay between HIV and AIDS, the controversy about condom use, and the availability of antiretroviral therapy, accompanied by church activists' multiple engagements with these issues, changed the Church's institutional HIV/AIDS response at that time, in effect transforming the Catholic Church in South Africa into a substantial health asset and agent. However, its stance against the use of condoms for HIV prevention, informed by a larger religious tradition on sexuality, proved to be a health liability.\n\nDevelopmental contexts and sporting success: birth date and birthplace effects in national hockey league draftees 2000-2005.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaker, Joseph; Logan, A Jane\n\n2007-08-01\n\nTo examine relative age and birth place effects in hockey players drafted to play in the National Hockey League (NHL) between 2000 and 2005 and determine whether these factors influenced when players were chosen in the draft. 1013 North American draftees were evaluated from the official NHL website, which provided birthplace, date of birth and selection order in the draft. Population size was collected from Canadian and American census information. Athletes were divided into four quartiles on the basis of selection date to define age cohorts in hockey. Data between the Canadian and American players were also compared to see if the optimal city sizes differed between the two nations. Relative age and birthplace effects were found, although the optimal city size found was dissimilar to that found in previous studies. Further, there were inconsistencies between the Canadian and American data. Contextual factors such as relative age and size of birthplace have a significant effect on likelihood of being selected in the NHL draft.\n\nAbortion surveillance--United States, 2005.\n\nPubMed\n\nGamble, Sonya B; Strauss, Lilo T; Parker, Wilda Y; Cook, Douglas A; Zane, Suzanne B; Hamdan, Saeed\n\n2008-11-28\n\nCDC began abortion surveillance in 1969 to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. This report summarizes and describes data voluntarily reported to CDC regarding legal induced abortions obtained in the United States in 2005. For each year since 1969, CDC has compiled abortion data by state or area of occurrence. Information is requested each year from all 50 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia. For 2005, data were received from 49 reporting areas: New York City, District of Columbia, and all states except California, Louisiana, and New Hampshire. For the purpose of trends analysis, data were evaluated from the 46 reporting areas that have been consistently reported since 1995. A total of 820,151 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC for 2005 from 49 reporting areas, the abortion ratio (number of abortions per 1,000 live births) was 233, and the abortion rate was 15 per 1,000 women aged 15--44 years. For the 46 reporting areas that have consistently reported since 1995, the abortion rate declined during 1995--2000 but has remained unchanged since 2000. For 2005, the highest percentages of reported abortions were for women who were known to be unmarried (81%), white (53%), and aged <25 years (50%). Of all abortions for which gestational age was reported, 62% were performed at =8 weeks' gestation and 88% at <13 weeks. From 1992 (when detailed data regarding early abortions were first collected) through 2005, the percentage of abortions performed at =6 weeks' gestation has increased. A small percentage of abortions occurred at >15 weeks' gestation (3.7% at 16--20 weeks and 1.3% at >/=21 weeks). A total of 35 reporting areas submitted data stating that they performed and enumerated medical (nonsurgical) procedures, making up 9.9% of all known reported procedures from the 45 areas with adequate reporting on type of procedure. In 2004 (the most recent years for which data are available), seven women\n\nSick leave among people in paid work after age 65: A Swedish population-based study covering 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarrants, K; Marklund, S; KjeldgÃ¥rd, L; Head, J; Alexanderson, K\n\n2018-05-01\n\nExtending working life into older age groups is discussed in many countries. However, there is no knowledge about how this affects rates of sick leave. The aim of this work was to investigate rates of sick leave among people in paid work after retirement age and if such rates have changed over time. Swedish nationwide register data on people aged >65 years and living in Sweden in 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 were analysed. All people with a sufficiently high work income to be eligible for public sick leave benefits were included. The proportions in paid work and compensated rates of sick leave for people aged 66-70 and â¥71 were analysed by sex, educational level, country of birth, living area, and employment type and sector. The percentage of people in paid work at ages 66-70 years increased from <10% in 1995 to 24% in 2010 and among those aged â¥71 years from 2.7% in 1995 to 3.5% in 2010. The rates of sick leave among working people aged 66-70 years were 3.3% in 1995 and 2.4% in 2010 and for people aged â¥71 years the rates of sick leave were 2.2% in 1995 and 0.2% in 2010. Women had higher rates of sick leave than men in 2005 and 2010, but lower in 1995 and 2000. In 2010, the rates of sick leave were similar between employees and the self-employed, and higher among employees in the public sector than among employees in the private sector. Rates of sick leave among workers aged >65 years were lower in 2010 than in 1995, despite much higher rates of labour market participation in 2010.\n\nSick leave before and after the age of 65 years among those in paid work in Sweden in 2000 or 2005: a register-based cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarrants, Kristin; KjeldgÃ¥rd, Linnea; Marklund, Staffan; Head, Jenny; Alexanderson, Kristina\n\n2018-02-01\n\nObjective With pressure for older people to remain in work, research is needed on how people aged over 65 years fare in the labour market. However, few studies have focused on sick leave among older workers, especially those over the standard retirement age. This study investigated changes in sick-leave patterns among people aged over 65 years still in work. Methods All individuals in Sweden who turned 65 years old in 2000 or 2005 were followed from 1995 to 2010. The mean number of sick-leave days per year was measured for those who remained in paid work past the age of 65 years. Results Those over 65 years still working had fewer sick-leave days before the age of 65 years than those who retired. They also had fewer sick-leave days after 65 years than before. There were fewer socioeconomic differences after 65 years than before, but these differences were greater for workers over 65 years in the 2005 cohort. Conclusions Although there were more people over 65 years in paid work in 2005, sick-leave days and socioeconomic differences in sick leave were lower in this age group. Sick-leave days and socioeconomic differences in sick leave were greater in the 2005 cohort.\n\nPesticide Occurrence and Distribution in the Lower Clackamas River Basin, Oregon, 2000-2005\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCarpenter, Kurt D.; Sobieszczyk, Steven; Arnsberg, Andrew J.; Rinella, Frank A.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPesticide occurrence and distribution in the lower Clackamas River basin was evaluated in 2000?2005, when 119 water samples were analyzed for a suite of 86?198 dissolved pesticides. Sampling included the lower-basin tributaries and the Clackamas River mainstem, along with paired samples of pre- and post-treatment drinking water (source and finished water) from one of four drinking water-treatment plants that draw water from the lower river. Most of the sampling in the tributaries occurred during storms, whereas most of the source and finished water samples from the study drinking-water treatment plant were obtained at regular intervals, and targeted one storm event in 2005. In all, 63 pesticide compounds were detected, including 33 herbicides, 15 insecticides, 6 fungicides, and 9 pesticide degradation products. Atrazine and simazine were detected in about half of samples, and atrazine and one of its degradates (deethylatrazine) were detected together in 30 percent of samples. Other high-use herbicides such as glyphosate, triclopyr, 2,4-D, and metolachlor also were frequently detected, particularly in the lower-basin tributaries. Pesticides were detected in all eight of the lower-basin tributaries sampled, and were also frequently detected in the lower Clackamas River. Although pesticides were detected in all of the lower basin tributaries, the highest pesticide loads (amounts) were found in Deep and Rock Creeks. These medium-sized streams drain a mix of agricultural land (row crops and nurseries), pastureland, and rural residential areas. The highest pesticide loads were found in Rock Creek at 172nd Avenue and in two Deep Creek tributaries, North Fork Deep and Noyer Creeks, where 15?18 pesticides were detected. Pesticide yields (loads per unit area) were highest in Cow and Carli Creeks, two small streams that drain the highly urban and industrial northwestern part of the lower basin. Other sites having relatively high pesticide yields included middle Rock Creek and\n\nTrends in youth internet victimization: findings from three youth internet safety surveys 2000-2010.\n\nPubMed\n\nJones, Lisa M; Mitchell, Kimberly J; Finkelhor, David\n\n2012-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this research was to explore the trends in youth reports of unwanted online sexual solicitation, harassment, and exposure to pornography over time. The study was based on three separate cross-sectional national telephone surveys of approximately 1,500 youth Internet users, aged 10 through 17 years. Data were collected in 2000, 2005, and 2010. Nine percent of youth reported an unwanted sexual solicitation in 2010. This continued the decline in unwanted sexual solicitations that occurred between 2000 (19%) and 2005 (13%), resulting in a total 50% decrease between 2000 and 2010. Twenty-three percent of youth reported an unwanted exposure to pornography, a decline from 34% in 2005, following an increase between 2000 and 2005 (25% to 34%). However, marking the only trend to show an increase over the past 5 years, 11% of youth reported an online harassment experience, which was an increase from 9% in 2005, and 6% in 2000. Some differences in these trends were noted for subgroups of youth across age, gender, and race. The trends in unwanted experiences online over the past decade identified by three Youth Internet Safety Surveys may contradict impressions that the general population, professionals, and the media have about what is happening. Trends provide evidence for some optimism that protective adaptations to the online environment have been successful; however, online harassment appears to be increasing for youth, particularly girls, and may require additional mobilization.

Measles viruses were isolated using B95a cell line or Vero/SLAM cell line from throat swabs collected from suspected measles cases during measles outbreak and sporadic in 6 prefectures during 2000-2011. The fragment of 696 nucleotides of N gene carboxy terminal was amplified by using RT-PCR methods. The PCR products were sequenced and analyzed. The phylogenetic tree was conducted with the viruses isolated in viruses from other province. Total 19 measles viruses were isolated during 2000-2011 in Qinghai province and all belong to genotype H1a. The results of phylogenetic tree showed that viruses in 2000-2005 and in 2009-2011 were distributed in two different lineages, and it revealed that these strains belonged to at least 2 viral transmission chains and the viruses circulated during 2000-2005 were not detected after 2005. Genotype H1a was the predominant genotype circulated in Qinghai province during 2000-2011. Qinghai measles virus strains had not evolved independently, but coevolved with the measles virus strains in other provinces in mainland China. The variation of important amino acid sites of measles virus should be continuous monitored and provide the scientific strategy for the measles elimination.\n\nCHANGES IN THE REGIONAL PREVALENCE OF CHILD OBESITY IN 4th, 8th, AND 11th GRADE STUDENTS IN TEXAS FROM 2000â2002 TO 2004â2005\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKelder, S. H.; PÃ©rez, A.; Day, R. S.; Benoit, J.; Frankowski, R. F.; Walker, J. L.; Lee, E. S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAlthough national and state estimates of child obesity are available, data at these levels are insufficient to monitor effects of local obesity prevention initiatives. The purpose of this study was to examine regional changes in the prevalence of obesity due to state-wide policies and programs among children in grades 4, 8, and 11 in Texas Health Service Regions (HSR) between 2000â2002 and 2004â2005, and nine selected counties in 2004â2005. A cross-sectional, probability-based sample of 23,190 Texas students in grades 4, 8, and 11 were weighed and measured to obtain body mass index (BMI). Obesity was greater than 95th percentile for BMI by age/sex using CDC growth charts. Child obesity prevalence significantly decreased between 2000â2002 and 2004â2005 for 4th grade students in the El Paso HSR (â7.0%, p=0.005). A leveling off in the prevalence of obesity was noted for all other regions for grades 4, 8 and 11. County-level data supported the statistically significant decreases noted in the El Paso region. The reduction of child obesity levels observed in the El Paso area is one of the few examples of effective programs and policies based on a population-wide survey: in this region, a local foundation funded extensive regional implementation of community programs for obesity prevention, including an evidence-based elementary school-based health promotion program, adult nutrition and physical activity programs, and a radio and television advertising campaign. Results emphasize the need for sustained school, community and policy efforts, and that these efforts can result in decreases in child obesity at the population level.

L.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this document is to present and document GFO performance analyses and results. This is the fifth Assessment Report since the initial report. This report extends the performance assessment since acceptance to 26 December 2005. The initial GFO Altimeter Engineering Assessment Report, March 2001 (NASA/TM-2001-209984/Ver.1/Vol.1) covered the GFO performance from Launch to Acceptance (10 February 1998 to 29 November 2000). The second of the series covered the performance from Acceptance to the end of Cycle 20 (29 November 2000 to 21 November 2001). The third of the series covered the performance from Acceptance to the end of Cycle 42 (29 November 2000 to 30 November 2002). The fourth of the series covered the performance from Acceptance to the end of Cycle 64 (29 November 2000 to 17 December 2003). The fifth of the series covered performance from Acceptance to the end of Cycle 86 (29 November 2000 to 17 December 2004). Since launch, we have performed a variety of GFO performance studies; an accumulative index of those studies is provided in Appendix A.\n\nThe Origin of Low Altitude ENA Emissions from Storms in 2000-2005 as Observed by IMAGE/MENA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPerez, J. D.; Sheehan, M. M.; Jahn, J.; Mackler, D.; Pollock, C. J.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nLow Altitude Emissions (LAEs) are prevalent features of Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) images of the inner magnetosphere. It is believed that they are created by precipitating ions that reach altitudes near 500 km and then charge exchange with oxygen atoms, subsequently escaping to be observed by satellite borne ENA imagers. In this study, LAEs from the MENA instrument onboard the IMAGE satellite are studied in order to learn about the origin of the precipitating ions. Using the Tsyganenko 05 magnetic field model, the bright pixels capturing the LAEs are mapped to the equator. The LAEs are believed to originate from ions near their mirroring point, i.e., with pitch angles near 90o. Therefore the angle between the line-of-sight and the magnetic field at the point of origin is used to further constrain possible magnetospheric regions that are the origin of the ENAs. By observing the time dependence of the strength and location of the LAEs during geomagnetic storms in the years 2000-2005, the dynamics of the emptying and filling of the loss cone by injected particles is observed. Thus, information regarding the coupling between the inner magnetosphere and the ionosphere is obtained.\n\nMangrove forest distributions and dynamics in Madagascar (1975-2005)\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGiri, C.; Muhlhausen, J.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nMangrove forests of Madagascar are declining, albeit at a much slower rate than the global average. The forests are declining due to conversion to other land uses and forest degradation. However, accurate and reliable information on their present distribution and their rates, causes, and consequences of change have not been available. Earlier studies used remotely sensed data to map and, in some cases, to monitor mangrove forests at a local scale. Nonetheless, a comprehensive national assessment and synthesis was lacking. We interpreted time-series satellite data of 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2005 using a hybrid supervised and unsupervised classification approach. Landsat data were geometrically corrected to an accuracy of ?? one-half pixel, an accuracy necessary for change analysis. We used a postclassification change detection approach. Our results showed that Madagascar lost 7% of mangrove forests from 1975 to 2005, to a present extent of ???2,797 km2. Deforestation rates and causes varied both spatially and temporally. The forests increased by 5.6% (212 km2) from 1975 to 1990, decreased by 14.3% (455 km 2) from 1990 to 2000, and decreased by 2.6% (73 km2) from 2000 to 2005. Similarly, major changes occurred in Bombekota Bay, Mahajamba Bay, the coast of Ambanja, the Tsiribihina River, and Cap St Vincent. The main factors responsible for mangrove deforestation include conversion to agriculture (35%), logging (16%), conversion to aquaculture (3%), and urban development (1%). ?? 2008 by MDPI.\n\nGWM-2005 - A Groundwater-Management Process for MODFLOW-2005 with Local Grid Refinement (LGR) Capability\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAhlfeld, David P.; Baker, Kristine M.; Barlow, Paul M.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis report describes the Groundwater-Management (GWM) Process for MODFLOW-2005, the 2005 version of the U.S. Geological Survey modular three-dimensional groundwater model. GWM can solve a broad range of groundwater-management problems by combined use of simulation- and optimization-modeling techniques. These problems include limiting groundwater-level declines or streamflow depletions, managing groundwater withdrawals, and conjunctively using groundwater and surface-water resources. GWM was initially released for the 2000 version of MODFLOW. Several modifications and enhancements have been made to GWM since its initial release to increase the scope of the program's capabilities and to improve its operation and reporting of results. The new code, which is called GWM-2005, also was designed to support the local grid refinement capability of MODFLOW-2005. Local grid refinement allows for the simulation of one or more higher resolution local grids (referred to as child models) within a coarser grid parent model. Local grid refinement is often needed to improve simulation accuracy in regions where hydraulic gradients change substantially over short distances or in areas requiring detailed representation of aquifer heterogeneity. GWM-2005 can be used to formulate and solve groundwater-management problems that include components in both parent and child models. Although local grid refinement increases simulation accuracy, it can also substantially increase simulation run times.\n\n[Evaluating cost/equity in the Colombian health system, 1998-2005].\n\nPubMed\n\nEslava-Schmalbach, Javier; BarÃ³n, Gilberto; GaitÃ¡n-Duarte, Hernando; Alfonso, Helman; Agudelo, Carlos; SÃ¡nchez, Carolina\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAn economic analysis of cost-equity (from society's viewpoint) for evaluating the impact of Law 100/93 in Colombia between 1998 and 2005. An economic analysis compared costs and equity in health in Colombia between 1998 and 2005. Data was taken from the Colombian Statistics' Administration Department ( Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica - DANE) and from national demographic and health surveys carried out in 2000 and 2005. Information regarding costs was taken from the National Health Accounts' System. Inequity in Health was considered in line with the Inequity in Health Index (IHI). Incremental and average cost-equity analysis covered three sub-periods; 1998-1999 (during which time per capita gross internal product became reduced in Colombia ), 2000-2001 (during which time total health expense became reduced) and 2001 -2005. An unstable tendency for inequity in health becoming reduced during the period was revealed. There was an inverse relationship between IHI and public health spending and a direct relationship between out-of-pocket spending on health and equity in health (Spearman, p<0.05). The second period had the best incremental cost-equity ratio. Fluctuations in IHI and marginal cost-equity during the periods being analysed suggested that health spending depended on equity in health in Colombia during the period being studied.\n\nNational forest cover change in Congo Basin: deforestation, reforestation, degradation and regeneration for the years 1990, 2000 and 2005.\n\nPubMed\n\nCÃ©line, Ernst; Philippe, Mayaux; Astrid, Verhegghen; Catherine, Bodart; Musampa, Christophe; Pierre, Defourny\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThis research refers to an object-based automatic method combined with a national expert validation to produce regional and national forest cover change statistics over Congo Basin. A total of 547 sampling sites systematically distributed over the whole humid forest domain are required to cover the six Central African countries containing tropical moist forest. High resolution imagery is used to accurately estimate not only deforestation and reforestation but also degradation and regeneration. The overall method consists of four steps: (i) image automatic preprocessing and preinterpretation, (ii) interpretation by national expert, (iii) statistic computation and (iv) accuracy assessment. The annual rate of net deforestation in Congo Basin is estimated to 0.09% between 1990 and 2000 and of net degradation to 0.05%. Between 2000 and 2005, this unique exercise estimates annual net deforestation to 0.17% and annual net degradation to 0.09%. An accuracy assessment reveals that 92.7% of tree cover (TC) classes agree with independent expert interpretation. In the discussion, we underline the direct causes and the drivers of deforestation. Population density, small-scale agriculture, fuelwood collection and forest's accessibility are closely linked to deforestation, whereas timber extraction has no major impact on the reduction in the canopy cover. The analysis also shows the efficiency of protected areas to reduce deforestation. These results are expected to contribute to the discussion on the reduction in CO2 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) and serve as reference for the period.

During 2006-2011, stool samples from paediatric diarrhoea patients were collected and processed for isolation and identification of Shigella spp. Susceptibility to 22 antimicrobial drugs was tested and minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for third-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combinations and gentamicin. A wide spectrum of antibiotic resistance was observed in the Shigella strains obtained during 2006-2011. The proportions of resistant strains showed an increase from 2000-2005 to 2006-2011 in 20/22 antibiotics tested. The number of drug resistance patterns increased from 13 in 2000-2005 to 43 in 2006-2011. Resistance to newer generation fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins and augmentin, which was not observed during 2000-2005, appeared during 2006-2011. The frequency of resistance in Shigella isolates has increased substantially between 2000-2006 and 2006-2011, with a wide spectrum of resistance. At present, the option for antimicrobial therapy in shigellosis in Andaman is limited to a small number of drugs.\n\nLearning without Awareness Revisited: Extending Williams (2005)\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHama, Mika; Leow, Ronald P.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe role of awareness or consciousness in learning has been a relatively contentious issue in non-SLA fields (e.g., cognitive psychology). With the publications of Williams (2004, 2005), a similar debate appears to be brewing in the field of SLA. Contrary to Leow (2000), who reported that unawareness did not appear to play an important role inâ¦\n\n[Hospital infections in the maternity department at Brest Hospital over a period from 2000 to 2005].\n\nPubMed\n\nRouzic, N; Faisant, M; Scheydeker, J-L; Collet, M; Lejeune, B\n\n2008-03-01\n\nHospital infections are at stake in terms of public health. They are responsible for increase in morbidity and involve the community in high costs. Epidemiologic surveillance has been initiated in the departments of gynecology, obstetrics and maternity with a view to making out the rate of hospital-acquired infections and the risk factors associated to them. It is an incidence survey over a period from 2000 to 2005. Surveillance slips are filled in for every childbirth. All suspicions of hospital infections are analysed in morbidity reviews every trimester. A request to the Medical Information Department of the hospital has allowed to look for variables which were not mentioned on the initial questionnaire and so carry out a more complete analysis. The number of hospital infections amounts to 118 over 9526 childbirths, corresponding to an incidence rate of 1.24%. After vaginal delivery the encountered risk factors are: episiotomy or perineal trauma, epidural anesthesia, urinary infection and the use of tools. After a caesarean section the risk factors are: general anesthesia and lack of antibioprophylaxy. The rate of hospital infections in the maternity department at Brest's centre hospitalier universitaire (CHU) during the considered period and the observed tendency to a decreasing of hospital infections over the same period apparently denotes the interest of surveillance in matter of hospital infections in maternity.\n\nAuthorship Trends in Spine Publications from 2000 to 2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaws, Brittany E; Khechen, Benjamin; Movassaghi, Kamran; Yom, Kelly H; Guntin, Jordan A; Cardinal, Kaitlyn L; Shoshana, Noah B; Singh, Kern\n\n2018-02-06\n\nLiterature review. To examine changes in authorship characteristics for Spine publications from the year 2000-2015. Scientific publications are considered an indication of academic achievement for physicians. Recently, authorship trends have been investigated, however, limited information is available on this topic within spine-specific literature. Original research articles published in Spine in the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 were evaluated. Authorship characteristics were collected for each article, including the number of authors and institutions per publication, first and last author gender, publication origin, and highest degree held by the first and last author. Trends over time were analyzed using numeric and visual descriptive analyses including percentages, means, standard deviations, and graphs. An average of 506 articles per year were published in Spine during the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The number of articles written by â¥ 10 authors increased during this time (0.9% to 14.4%). There was a substantial increase in the number of multiple institutional affiliations (33.6% to 68.7%) and articles originating from outside North America (47.6% to 55.7%) from 2000 to 2015. The percentage of first authors with bachelor's degrees was higher in 2015 (6.6%) as compared to 2000 (1.4%), and more last authors were identified as MD/PhDs in 2015 (19.2%) than in 2000 (10.0%). Similar female representation was noted for first and last authorship for all years evaluated. The results of this study demonstrate increases in authors per article published in Spine from 2000 to 2015. Additionally, first authors were more likely to hold bachelor's degrees over time. This may be attributed to increasing competition in spine-related fields, necessitating earlier research exposure to aid in academic achievement. Interestingly, the percentage of female authorship has not changed significantly over time, in contrast with much of the previous literature. 2.\n\nThe 2000 revision of the joint UK/US geomagnetic field models and an IGRF 2000 candidate model\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMacmillan, S.; Quinn, J.M.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe method of derivation of the joint UK/US spherical harmonic geomagnetic main-field and secular-variation models is presented. Early versions of these models, with the main field truncated at degree 10, are the UK/US candidates for the IGRF 2000 model. The main-field model describes the Earth's magnetic field at the 2000.0 epoch, while the secular-variation model predicts the evolution of this field between 2000.0 and 2005.0. A revised 1995.0 main-field model was also generated. Regional models for the continental US, Alaska and Hawaii were also produced as a by-product of the UK/US global modelling effort. Copy right??

Advances in molecular epidemiology have improved the ability to distinguish unique Neisseria meningitidis strains, enabling the classification of isolates into clones. Around 98% of meningococcal cases in the United States are believed to be sporadic. Methods Meningococcal isolates from 9 Active Bacterial Core surveillance sites throughout the United States from 2000 through 2005 were classified according to serogroup, multilocus sequence typing, and outer membrane protein (porA, porB, and fetA) genotyping. Clones were defined as isolates that were indistinguishable according to this characterization. Case data were aggregated to the census tract level and all non-singleton clones were assessed for non-random spatial and temporal clustering using retrospective space-time analyses with a discrete Poisson probability model. Results Among 1,062 geocoded cases with available isolates, 438 unique clones were identified, 78 of which had â¥2 isolates. 702 cases were attributable to non-singleton clones, accounting for 66.0% of all geocoded cases. 32 statistically significant clusters comprised of 107 cases (10.1% of all geocoded cases) were identified. Clusters had the following attributes: included 2 to 11 cases; 1 day to 33 months duration; radius of 0 to 61.7 km; and attack rate of 0.7 to 57.8 cases per 100,000 population. Serogroups represented among the clusters were: B (nâ=â12 clusters, 45 cases), C (nâ=â11 clusters, 27 cases), and Y (nâ=â9 clusters, 35 cases); 20 clusters (62.5%) were caused by serogroups represented in meningococcal vaccines that are commercially available in the United States. Conclusions Around 10% of meningococcal disease cases in the U.S. could be assigned to a geotemporal cluster. Molecular characterization of isolates, combined with geotemporal analysis, is a useful tool for understanding the spread of virulent meningococcal\n\nQuantifying changes in the rates of forest clearing in Indonesia from 1990 to 2005 using remotely sensed data sets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHansen, Matthew C.; Stehman, Stephen V.; Potapov, Peter V.; Arunarwati, Belinda; Stolle, Fred; Pittman, Kyle\n\n2009-07-01\n\nTimely and accurate data on forest change within Indonesia is required to provide government, private and civil society interests with the information needed to improve forest management. The forest clearing rate in Indonesia is among the highest reported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), behind only Brazil in terms of forest area lost. While the rate of forest loss reported by FAO was constant from 1990 through 2005 (1.87 Mha yr-1), the political, economic, social and environmental drivers of forest clearing changed at the close of the last century. We employed a consistent methodology and data source to quantify forest clearing from 1990 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2005. Results show a dramatic reduction in clearing from a 1990s average of 1.78 Mha yr-1 to an average of 0.71 Mha yr-1 from 2000 to 2005. However, annual forest cover loss indicator maps reveal a near-monotonic increase in clearing from a low in 2000 to a high in 2005. Results illustrate a dramatic downturn in forest clearing at the turn of the century followed by a steady resurgence thereafter to levels estimated to exceed 1 Mha yr-1 by 2005. The lowlands of Sumatra and Kalimantan were the site of more than 70% of total forest clearing within Indonesia for both epochs; over 40% of the lowland forests of these island groups were cleared from 1990 to 2005. The method employed enables the derivation of internally consistent, national-scale changes in the rates of forest clearing, results that can inform carbon accounting programs such as the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) initiative.\n\nWater Withdrawals, Use, and Trends in Florida, 2005\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMarella, Richard L.\n\n2009-01-01\n\ngeneration (20.5 percent), public supply (13 percent), recreational irrigation (6 percent), and commercial-industrial self-supplied (4.5 percent). Power generation accounted for nearly all (99.9 percent) saline-water withdrawals. Of the 17.92 million people who resided in Florida during 2005, 41 percent (7.36 million people) resided in the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), followed by the St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) and the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) with 25 percent each (4.46 and 4.44 million people, respectively), the Northwest Florida Water Management District (NWFWMD) with 7.5 percent (1.34 million people), and the Suwannee River Water Management District (SRWMD) with 1.5 percent (0.32 million people). The largest amount of freshwater withdrawals was from the SFWMD, which was one-half (50 percent) of the State's total freshwater withdrawals, followed by the SJRWMD (19 percent), SWFWMD (16 percent), NWFWMD (10 percent), and SRWMD (5 percent). Between 1950 and 2005, the population of Florida increased by 15.15 million (550 percent), and the total water withdrawals (fresh and saline) increased 15,700 Mgal/d (600 percent). More recently, total withdrawals decreased 1,790 Mgal/d (9 percent) between 2000 and 2005, but the total population increased by 1.94 million (12 percent). Between 1990 and 2005, saline-water withdrawals increased 1,120 Mgal/d (11 percent), whereas between 2000 and 2005, saline-water withdrawals decreased 470 Mgal/d (4 percent). Between 1990 and 2005, freshwater withdrawals decreased 710 Mgal/d (9 percent), whereas between 2000 and 2005, freshwater withdrawals decreased 1,320 Mgal/d (16 percent). The use of highly mineralized groundwater as a source of supply, primarily for public supply, also has increased in Florida. This water, referred as nonpotable water, increased from just less than 2 Mgal/d in 1970, to 142 Mgal/d in 2005. Nonpotable water is treated to meet drin\n\nHomicides In Mexico Reversed Life Expectancy Gains For Men And Slowed Them For Women, 2000â10\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAburto, JosÃ© Manuel; BeltrÃ¡n-SÃ¡nchez, Hiram; GarcÃ­a-Guerrero, Victor Manuel; Canudas-Romo, Vladimir\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLife expectancy in Mexico increased for more than six decades but then stagnated in th"
