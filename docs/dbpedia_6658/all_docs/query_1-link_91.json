        "text": "Jackie Chan at the 65th Cannes Film Festival in 2012 (Photo by Denis Makarenko on Shutterstock)\n\nMany film fans know Jackie Chan for his unique style of slapstick action comedy and for doing all his own stunts. But many might not be aware that Chan’s first recorded film credit was at age eight in the obscure 1962 Hong Kong film “Big and Little Wong Tin Bar.” Chan’s impressive career spans seven decades. We explored his famous films with our list of the top five best Jackie Chan movies most recommended by experts.\n\nJackie Chan’s Hong Kong film industry contributions began in earnest during the latter half of the 1970s. Chan would work in several films as a martial arts choreographer and in smaller supporting roles. Some of his most notable work from this era includes brief cameos in Bruce Lee’s films “New Fist of Fury” and “Enter the Dragon.” Ever seeking bigger projects, Chan would begin to include writing, directing, and experimenting with his new style of action comedy in his filmography.\n\nOne of Chan’s most famous early lead roles is in the 1978 classic “Drunken Master,” that proved to be an exciting comedic showcase for his Wu Shu, Kung Fu, and Hapkido martial arts styles. “Drunken Master” was a huge Honk Kong studio success that earned more than $16.4 million at the box office. This film was also notable as one of Chan’s early-career successes with creative martial arts and slapstick choreography including a game of keep-away during a fight.\n\nThrough the mid-1980s and 1990s, Chan firmly established himself as an international sensation with his numerous film hits including 1995’s “Rumble in the Bronx,” a movie that gained great popularity in the United States. Chan’s stardom in America would explode with 1998 buddy cop movie “Rush Hour” co-starring Chris Tucker. Having conquered the U.S. entertainment market Chan would then continue to expand his acting credits to include several acclaimed voice roles in animated features like “Kung Fu Panda” and recent hit “TMNT Mutant Mayhem.”\n\nNow that we’ve covered a primer of Chan’s filmography, let’s have a look at his top five movies most recommended by experts. With no fewer than 131 movies under his belt, we turned to our trusted sources to discover the best Jackie Chan movies of all time. Did we miss one of your favorites? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nThe List: Best Jackie Chan Movies, According to Experts\n\n1. “Drunken Master” (1978)\n\n“Drunken Master” is a film with a simple premise that throws Jackie Chan into situations ripe for slapstick. Chan is iconic in this classic film. “It’s the role in this movie that propelled Jackie Chan to mainstream success. The Kung Fu comedy genre, for which he became famous, started with this one. He plays a young Kung Fu student with a lack of discipline. After many failed attempts, his father decides to send him to another, [cruel] teacher. The new teacher is a master of drunken Kung Fu. [Chan] eventually escapes from the new teacher, but after getting beaten in a fight, [he] returns to his drunken master,” explains Ninja Selection.\n\nBlack Belt adds, “In this martial arts classic, Chan portrays Wong Fei-Hung, a mischievous yet talented fighter who must master the art of Drunken Boxing to defeat a ruthless assassin. The film showcases Chan’s incredible physicality and innovative fight choreography, making it a timeless masterpiece. These films represent some of Jackie Chan’s most iconic and critically acclaimed work, showcasing his unique blend of action, comedy, and martial arts.”\n\nGrounded MMA also chimes in: “Drunken Master was the first time viewers saw Jackie Chan’s unique blend of martial arts and comedy… Chan’s intricate and humorous execution of this fighting style, which requires him to mimic the movements of a drunkard, shows his ability to interweave comedy with intense action, which are the skills he learned at the Peking Opera School.”\n\n2. “Police Story” (1985)\n\n“Police Story” is more serious in tone as compared to some of Chan’s other films, and it sets the stage for amazing stunts. The plot is secondary to the spectacle of Jackie Chan’s awe-inspiring stunt work. /Film writes, “Chan had already shown an interest in accentuating his action with big stunts prior to 1985, but ‘Police Story’ remains the absolute pinnacle of that pairing. The opening shantytown sequence is so epic that not only did Michael Bay rip it off for ‘Bad Boys II’ (1993), but Sylvester Stallone borrowed it beat for beat in ‘Tango & Cash’ (1989) as well.”\n\n“Chan went all-out with ‘Police Story.’ It contains the most spectacular stunts of his entire catalog, especially during the climactic fight at a multi-story mall. The movie even gives you two ‘instant replays’ with different camera angles. Your jaw will be on the floor,” raves Parade”\n\n“This story has arguably some of the best fight scenes of Chan’s career. The most memorable scene takes place in a mall where Chan jumps on a pole (with light bulbs) and slides down through a glass ceiling to catch the bad guys. The plot blends drama and comedy all centered around Chan trying to clear his name and catch a drug lord,” offers Urban Matter.\n\n3. “The Legend of Drunken Master” (1994)\n\nThis movie is Chan’s second foray into “Drunken Master” and tells another story of a drunken Kung-Fu warrior. This film was made 16 years after the original, and it serves to highlight Chan’s growth and experience in the film industry. Buddy TV details, “The film showcases Jackie Chan’s acrobatic fighting style, incorporating comedy, and creative use of the environment and props. Throughout the story, [Chan’s Character] must balance his mastery of the unique drunken boxing style with his filial duties of protecting his family’s honor. In a final showdown, he faces off against the formidable leader of the smugglers, engaging in an intense battle that pushes him to his limits.”\n\nRanker posits, “Drunken Master II is a 1994 Hong Kong Kung Fu film directed by Lau Kar-Leung and Jackie Chan, who stars as Chinese folk hero, Wong Fei-Hung. It was Chan’s first traditional style martial arts film since The Young Master and Dragon Lord. The film was released in North America as The Legend of Drunken Master in 2000. The film is a follow-up to Chan’s 1978 film Drunken Master, directed by Yuen Woo-Ping, but not a direct storyline sequel.”\n\n“A sequel in name only — sort of. Chan plays Wong Fei-Hung, a famed martial artist, physician, acupuncturist, and revolutionary, who would later become a folk hero to many in China. This is another period piece, but with a decidedly more modern flair, and it contains some of the best action scenes and stunt work of Chan’s career. As a matter of fact, the late film critic Roger Ebert loved this movie, pointing out that the final fight sequence is perhaps one of the best of all time. On top of everything that comes before, that’s some mighty praise indeed,” according to Pop Matters.\n\n4. “Rush Hour” (1998)\n\nJackie Chan’s “Rush Hour” trilogy with Chris Tucker includes some of Chan’s best stunt work combined with comedic storytelling. Despite being a Hollywood film, the “Rush Hour” movies have a certain indelible Hong Kong action feel. Of the three films, the original 1998 “Rush Hour” is often cited as the best of the series. “‘Rush Hour’ is one of the greatest buddy cop comedy action movies of all time, and it spawned one of the best trilogies for Jackie Chan’s memorable career. Chan and Chris Tucker come together to save a Chinese diplomat’s daughter in an unlikely scenario. The classic comedy is on point as the tense relationship between the two characters is explored,” as explained by Wealth of Geeks.\n\n“In this comedy, Chan is a Detective Inspector who… ends up assigned to work with Detective Carter (played by Chris Tucker) and it is another moment of two characters who initially despise each other becoming friends in the end. Both are keener toward one another once they realize the FBI and the police want nothing to do with them,” states Urban Matter.\n\nParade also adds, “Chan’s first huge American hit came when he was in his 40s, on the heels of a number of his Hong Kong titles being repackaged and released into American cinemas… Chan doesn’t get to show off much in this, but he and Tucker make up a great comedic team (they made two more ‘Rush Hours’ after this). But the highlight is in the finale, when Chan has to fight off two bad guys while keeping a giant, priceless vase from falling, and it has a great comic payoff.”\n\n5. “Kung Fu Panda” (2008)\n\nThe “Kung Fu Panda” franchise is a gem among Chan’s numerous voice-acting roles. The original 2008 animated feature helped to make Jackie Chan relevant for a whole new generation of fans. Buddy TV even goes so far as to place “Kung Fu Panda” in the number one spot, “‘Kung Fu Panda’ enchants with its breathtaking animation, dynamic fights, and outstanding ensemble cast, creating a perfect harmony of action, comedy, and heartfelt instances. This film showcases Jackie’s remarkable voice-acting skills and is a must-see among the best Jackie Chan movies. Prepare to laugh, root for the underdog, and be inspired by the lovable panda who teaches us that greatness knows no bounds.”\n\nOf the beloved series Wealth of Geeks writes, “This is the classic, ‘Kung Fu Panda’ where it all began. Jack Black’s Po is a terrific character that is boosted by some of the strongest cast in animated history, including, of course, Jackie Chan’s wonderful Master Monkey. The story is tight, the animation still holds up well, and Chan has a much more prominent role here than in other entries.”\n\nSimply put, “Po the panda (Jack Black) works in his family’s noodle shop and dreams of becoming a Kung-Fu master. His dream becomes a reality when, unexpectedly, he must fulfill an ancient prophecy and study the skills with his idols, the Furious Five. Po needs all the wisdom, strength and ability he can muster to protect his people from an evil snow leopard,” expounds Ranker.\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nBest Bruce Lee Films\n\nBest Tom Cruise Movies\n\nBest Will Smith Movies\n\nBest Denzel Washington Movies\n\nSources:\n\nNinja Selection\n\nBlack Belt\n\nGrounded MMA\n\n/Film\n\nParade\n\nUrban Matter\n\nBuddy TV\n\nRanker\n\nPop Matters\n\nWealth of Geeks\n\nNote: This article was not paid for nor sponsored.
