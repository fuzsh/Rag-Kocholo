Still this B movie is more interesting for the backstory of the talent involved than the movie itself. It's based on the smash hit comic strip about a girl reporter, proving Hollywood didn't just start turning comic books into movies in the 2000s. While I assumed Jane Arden was a poor man's Brenda Starr, turns out Jane Arden was first. The comic strip ran from 1927 to 1968, spinning off a short-lived radio show, this movie, merchandising and more. A spunky gal who investigated the news, she was never a big success in the US but did well around the world (including Canada and Australia), inspiring Starr and others in her wake. Yes, Arden was the first female reporter of note (not to mention the most beautiful woman in news, as they often boasted). Come WW II, the strip dumped her then-current storyline and sent Arden right into the thick of things in Europe, albeit a fictional country.\n\nThe movie begins with Arden looking to bust open a jewelry smuggling ring. In typically dumb fashion, she goes undercover and gets a job with the bad guys in my home country of Bermuda. So she's on a dangerous assignment, but that doesn't stop her newspaper's managing editor from staying with her on the cruise ship until AFTER she meets her contact and then trying to sneak away. Naturally, he's spotted and her cover is blown; at least the film lets Jane chide him for seeing her off. The Adventures Of Jane Arden has cheap dialogue of the wise guy sort and a lot of actors who come off poorly, notably Rosella Towne as our gal Jane. Though depicted playing dice with the boys and being quick on her feet, Towne is a stiff and it's no surprise they never followed up on this film -- her touted career soon sputtered out. The same goes for director Terry Morse, who did better work as an editor and is best known today for having directed the American scenes featuring Raymond Burr for the butchered American version of the Godzilla debut that eclipsed the superior Japanese cut for decades.\n\nNever rule anyone out just because they're in a bad flick. Watching this, you'd probably single out William Gargan as the least bad. But in fact he had a good career, getting an Oscar nomination one year later and scoring in The Bells Of St. Marys and other films until throat cancer sidelined him as an actor and he turned to producing. Ditto the not awful James Stephenson who plays the main baddie. He stumbled into movies very late in life, starting at age 49 and after a few clunkers like this one, Stephenson also received an Oscar nomination in William Wyler's The Letter opposite Bette Davis (playing a rare nice guy part), not to mention turns in The Sea Hawk, The Private Lives Of Elizabeth And Essex and other major films. Not bad for a guy who started in 1938 and died suddenly of a heart attack in 1941.\n\nFinally, there's the sad case of Peggy Shannon. She plays Stephenson's hard-bitten moll, one he's tossing aside for Arden, a real \"lady\" and one he prefers even when he discovers Arden is a reporter. Shannon was a kid growing up in Arkansas until -- in true Hollywood fashion -- she visited an aunt in New York City at age 16 and was discovered by the great Florenz Ziegfeld himself. In two shakes, she was starring on Broadway, signed to a film deal and replacing Clara Bow in a major film. But Shannon was an alcoholic and difficult to deal with (those don't always go hand in hand). Her reputation for being a pain kept her from capitalizing on the early heat. She was reduced to supporting roles by 1939 and drinking more and more, dying of a heart attack in 1941 (the same year as her co-star Stephenson). In real life, Shannon's distraught new husband (a cameraman) died by suicide three weeks later, shooting himself in the same chair in which he found her body. It's the curse of The Adventures Of Jane Arden! Read about all those actors and you might glean a very modest bit of interest in this weak nothing of a movie. Know nothing about them and it will be forgotten before it's even over. And if I know my casting couch, the handsome young man on the ship who gets a line and some good camera time when announcing \"All ashore that's going ashore!\" was sleeping with someone! Opened March 18, 1939.\n\nALLEGHENY UPRISING *** -- Surprisingly nuanced film about folk in the colonies before the Revolutionary War. They chafe under the tyrannical behavior of a British soldier and the smuggling that threatens their livelihood. John Wayne leads them in semi-legal uprising, always striving to stay this side of the law while they risk their lives to expose the bad guys and force the British military to meet their demands. Love interest Claire Trevor fell hard for Wayne as a kid and desperately wants him to see her as a woman now, though he's too busy righting wrongs to notice. The British are not all bad and the colonists are not all good; heck, even the Indians are presented in a somewhat complex manner (given when the film was made). Smart little movie and quite effective despite the curse of dullness that dooms most films set in the Revolutionary Era. Opened November 10, 1939.\n\nANGELS WASH THEIR FACES ** -- The Dead End Kids started on Broadway, then shot to fame in Hollywood when their play Dead End was turned into a movie. In 1939 alone, they made seven films for two different studios! At this stage they're still young-ish for the most part, but 20 years later they'd be middle-aged men still acting like kids as the Bowery Boys. (No, I can't reconcile my impression here with the fact that in 1939's They Made Me A Criminal the actors seem absurdly old for their roles.) Here they still have their dignity intact, doing a sequel to the much superior 1938 drama Angels With Dirty Faces. Instead of James Cagney as a tough guy they wrongly idolize, the kids are paired with Ronald Reagan as a crusading Assistant D.A. The newest member of the gang is framed for arson by a crooked developer and the kids are furious. The solution? Billy (Billy Halop) competes in a contest to be Mayor for a week. Once in power, he'll get his pal out of jail and put the bad guys away for good. Hijinks ensue, with the kids taking advantage of old laws still on the books so they can place some thugs in the stockade (literally) until the guys crack and spill the beans. Huzzah! Reagan is pretty loose and fun here by his standards and the Dead End Kids haven't strayed too far from their dramatic roots yet. In one scene, a crippled boy is trapped in an apartment building intentionally set on fire. The kids rush to the building next door, get a rope to the kid...and then watch the place collapse in flames, taking their screaming friend with it. It's pretty harrowing and the emotional highlight of a nothing B movie. Halop really does have the goods as the most passionate kid in the gang; no wonder he tried for a solo career. (He's also good in Dust Be My Destiny.) The rest were wise to milk this franchise for all it was worth. Opened August 26, 1939.\n\nANOTHER THIN MAN *** -- Maybe it's hard to remember the plot of this light mystery because the crime and the solving of it is so beside the point. You don't need me to tell you that Nick and Nora are the prototypical couple that inspired TV shows like Hart To Hart and Moonlighting and too many movies and indeed mystery novel duos to count. It's all down to that mysterious element known as chemistry, which William Powell and Myrna Loy enjoy in spades. Myrna Loy in particular is my idea of a great gal. Who wouldn't want to be married to her? It seems such effortless fun. This time around they are joined by a baby -- Nicky Jr. -- and the little tyke doesn't slow down the drinking or the fun one bit. The cast is brimming with wonderful character actors, from C. Aubrey Smith as Nora's ill-fated friend of her late father to Sheldon Leonard (the bartender in It's A Wonderful Life) as a goon who keeps threatening people with the dreams he has of their imminent demise. Somehow it ends with a baby party where Runyonesque shady characters all show up at Nick and Nora's with little babies in toy and they all get wonderfully jumbled up. Somewhere in there a crime takes place and is solved, but who cares? You can easily chart the film as a delightful battle of wits: Nick tricks Nora into the other room so he can skedaddle with the police (and keep her safe). Nora collects the names of his old flames so she can drop them like depth charges at opportune moments. Nick punishes her for following him by letting her be bullied around by a Marjorie Main as a boisterous landlady and so on. Their asides are as dry as their martinis. Their looks of affection and amusement and good-natured frustration are the bass line on which the entire movie spins out its melody. If Powell does a double take once too often when jousting with other characters, who can blame him? They can't compare to Myrna Loy. Maybe the second film is the peak in this series, but this third entry is right there with the original. Opened November 17, 1939.\n\nARIZONA LEGION * -- An RKO western vehicle for George O'Brien, this is a dull little movie in which half the action is watching horses race around from one spot to another. It was shot in November of 1938, edited in December and released in January of 1939. Ahh, the good ole days. Despite myself, I found it a little intriguing, if idiotic. A Lieutenant Bob Ives in the US Cavalry is all duded up and riding a stagecoach back to a new posting near his hometown. Played by Carlyle Moore, he's an annoying fellow. Ives angrily dusts himself off, saying he's been away so long he'd forgotten how dreadful the dirt and mess of Arizona could be. A fellow passenger makes a seemingly polite comment and Bob bites his head off with some officious nonsense. They're robbed by a gang of bandits led by a portly, un-menacing fellow named Whiskey Joe. And when a fellow passenger insists he won't identify the man (since anyone who dares to testify against Joe is killed), Bob sneers at his cowardice. Dear god, is he our hero? I hate him already. Soon they're back home, arresting Whiskey Joe and we watch as a farce of a courtroom trial leads to an acquittal. To make matters worse for the by-the-book, stick up his arse Ives, the jury is laughingly led by his old pal Boone (O'Brien). Boone is drinking up his inheritance, hanging around with bad guys and dismaying the prettiest girl in town (Laraine Day). She breaks off their engagement though she can't quite bring herself to fall for Ives (who could?). Surely Boone hasn't gone all bad? Indeed not. It turns out Boone is undercover. The governor has formed the Arizona Legion, fourteen men who for some reason will protect stage coaches and foil robberies but feel the need to do it with a kerchief over their face until the criminal mastermind behind all this lawlessness can be uncovered. O'Brien looks pretty out of shape (by modern standards, I guess) and is more believable as a dissolute bum than an action hero, always walking into rooms with a self-conscious swagger. This is a long way down from his work with Ford, not to mention starring in Murnau's Sunrise in 1927, one of the greatest films of all time. Boone's sidekick is Chill Wills, who gets to tell tall tales and sing a comic number when they're not hunting down bad guys. (Wills of course was the voice for Francis The Talking Mule and may have lost an Oscar as a supporting actor in John Wayne's The Alamo by campaigning too hard. But anyone who refuses to support Richard Nixon because he prefers George Wallace instead deserves all the bad luck they can get. ) Hilariously, the duo foils numerous criminal acts but the bad guys don't recognize them, even though they're riding their own horses and wearing the same clothes when they show up at the local saloon minutes later. It's the kerchief! Who could figure it out? Worse is a \"secret\" door in the backroom of the saloon that seems to lead outside but is covered over with a giant Indian rug hanging on the wall. Never mind that anyone OUTSIDE would see the secret door. At the finale, Boone reveals his secret mission to Ives, announces he knows the criminal mastermind and yet for some reason doesn't actually say the guy's name. Ives steps out of the room and unwittingly tips off the villain, proving one last time what an idiot he is. We get some more running around until a final shoot out, the day is won and Boone gets the girl and kisses her while manfully shaking Ives' hand over her shoulder. Moore is so satisfyingly annoying as a martinet and stickler for the rules, I wondered what else he'd done. Precious little, actually. Almost everything he did before this film was tiny or uncredited bit roles, other than a supporting turn in Humphrey Bogart's Two Against The World in 1936. After perhaps the biggest role of his career in Arizona League came five more parts amounting to nothing in 1940 (radio operator, intern typing and so on) before he quit the business for good. I'm not saying he made the wrong choice, but the fact that I wanted to slap him the moment he came on screen is notable and actually in his favor. A smarter studio might have seen Moore's potential for playing annoying twerps and made something of him. Opened January 20, 1939.\n\nAT THE CIRCUS * -- This is the tenth of 14 Marx Brothers films and boy does it show. Everything about At The Circus is tired, starting with the Brothers Marx, whose hearts clearly weren't in it. Director Edward Buzzell made about thirty movies and I don't think any of them were good. He killed off the Thin Man series and he probably should have killed off the Marx Brothers since the four movies that followed this one weren't any better. Anyway, the bland Jeff Wilson (Kenny Baker) has turned his back on his aunt (Margaret Dumont, of course) and all her money to open a circus. He's just getting by but the bad guys steal $10,000, Jeff can't make a payment and the circus may go under. Jeff manfully urges his sweetheart (Florence Rice) to take her marvelous act (she sings to a horse!) and get while the going is good. No way. She pledges her devotion and after we see her absurd act and hear them duet on a dull love song, we wish they'd get married already and leave. Rice made some better films but Kenny Baker is so bland you'd swear he was cast just to make the Marx Brothers look nuttier in comparison. Even Zeppo has more charisma! (It's the same reason Ray Charles had those whiter-than-white back-up singers on classics like \"Georgia On My Mind.\" After the funkiness of the Rae-lettes, those square vocalists were the only way to make him sound even more soulful.) Baker was a star singer on \"The Jack Benny Show\" in radio, but headed to the movies full-time in 1939, just in time to make this and ruin \"The Mikado\" for good measure. Eventually he ran back to radio, hopefully dumping his idiot manager in the process. Back to our story: Chico likes the boss so he and Harpo call in a lawyer. Enter Groucho and the usual shenanigans. You've seen it all before, only funnier. The musical numbers are especially obligatory, with the exception of Groucho's \"Lydia The Tattooed Lady.\" Otherwise, Harpo's harp solo is rather inventively shot, though unfortunately it's book-ended with a racist tableaux featuring every black actor on the studio lot, all of them dragooned into looking bug-eyed at lions and then in rapt pleasure over his strumming. Ugh. Grouch and Dumont have some of the old spark and a line here or there has a little zip...or might if they weren't presented so flatly and edited so poorly. Exhausting, right down to the final gag where lunacy breaks out after they present the circus acts for a bunch of swells while an ape/gorilla/fellow in a monkey costume breaks out of his cage and collars the bad guy. An orchestra is sailing out to sea (don't ask) and Groucho is asking the gorilla if the money it has recovered is all there. The cutting back and forth between the floating orchestra and the gorilla counting off bills is a master class in unfunny. Opened October 20, 1939.\n\nBAD LITTLE ANGEL * 1/2 -- A curious faith-based movie starring child star Virginia Weidler in one of her few leading roles. She had a great run as a spunky kid in The Women and The Philadelphia Story. Weidler could carry a film but the girl she plays here is such a drip that there's not much Weidler can do about it. The child is Patsy, an orphan who has a strong faith in God; you can tell because she's always sporting a crucifix and can barely speak a sentence without quoting the Bible or talking about our Lord. It begins with Patsy under the care of a Bible-quoting old woman who reads stories to the child every night. (Size matters, apparently. Every single copy of the Bible we see is monstrously big, just so we know it's no ordinary book.) The excellent supporting cast (which, like Weidler, can't overcome the trite material) includes Elizabeth Patterson as the feisty old lady. Patterson would later play the neighbor Mrs. Trumbull on I Love Lucy. She teaches Patsy about divination, using the Bible as a sort of Tarot card or Magic 8 Ball where you open it up randomly and point at a passage to see if it answers your prayer. It's actually frowned upon by actual religious folk but here is presented with a child's guileless simplicity. The evil orphanage tries to reclaim Patsy (because they can get cold hard money for taking care of her) and the old lady fights them off but soon dies. Branded a jinx, Patsy then runs away, this time using the Bible to tell her where to go. \"Flee unto Egypt\" it says. Patsy doesn't have enough money to get all the way to the Middle East but she doesn't think God will mind if she goes to Egypt, New Jersey instead. (Yep, there's such a place, known as New Egypt.) In typical Anne of Green Gables style, Patsy shows up, befriends a boy who has spunk (and a drunken father), confronts a mean old miser and gets taken in by the crusading editor of the town's paper. Her faith charms and changes one and all, of course. The rich old meanie is played by Guy Kibbee with understated believability, his butler is an over-acting Reginald Owens and the boy is played by Gene Reynolds, who's quite appealing here but would go on to much bigger success as a director and producer on smash hit shows like M*A*S*H and Lou Grant. Patsy's constant quoting of the Bible is the movie's only redeeming, offbeat touch here. Interestingly, no one else is remotely as religious. When she joins a family for dinner, they all dig in while she starts praying quietly and they awkwardly drop everything to politely join in. When Patsy starts praying over a Bible in the rich man's mansion, he looks at her suspiciously and wonders what the heck she could be doing. You'd think the entire country was godless before Patsy showed up. Faith is redeemed and if you think that's a spoiler, you're either a heathen or you've never seen typical Hollywood fare from the 1930s. Opened October 27, 1939.\n\nBLACKMAIL ** 1/2 -- It's no surprise Edward G. Robinson is a compelling actor, even in a by-the-numbers flick for MGM where he plays a family man happily married to Ruth Hussey, dad to an adorable little boy (Bobs Watson of the Watson acting clan) and owner of a business that runs around putting out wildly dangerous fires at sites drilling for oil. He's got it all. Then a newsreel company is spotted filming Robison putting out another fire and his wife calmly tells him to turn his back and stay out of the camera's sight. What gives? Turns out Robinson is on the lam -- wrongly convicted of a crime, he was trapped on a brutal chain gang, fled for his life and started over in another part of the country with a new name and a new lease on life. Disaster strikes when a fellow jailbird spots Robinson in the newsreel footage, tracks him down and asks for a job...and then a little money...and then a little more money. Why, it's...BLACKMAIL! It's another MGM film that plays like a tough-talking Warner Bros flick which makes me think our ideas about the studios and their identities should be a little more flexible. Even when he seems to be an ordinary fellow, Robinson is compulsively watchable. And as the film progresses, this innocent man trapped in a nightmare becomes increasingly obsessed with getting revenge on the man blackmailing him, the very man who framed him in the first place all those years ago. That's when the movie kicks into high gear, with Robinson destroying everything he built because he can't bear the sheer injustice of his situation. The movie only falters at a too-neat finale. Hussey, Guinn Williams as Robinson's stalwart #2 and I guess Watson as the boy are all good. (The kid is unbearable when asked to emote but fine when just a typical boy.) But it's worth seeing not for them and not for Robinson but for character actor Gene Lockhart as William Ramey, the weasel who comes back into Robinson's life. You'll immediately recognize this consummate character actor from dozens of other roles (the sheriff in His Girl Friday, the judge in Miracle On 34th Street). Here he's just so wonderfully hateful, asking questions in an insinuating, infuriating voice and trying to act reasonable when you just know this skunk spells trouble. He's so good that when Robinson threatens to toss him into a raging oil fire at one point, you can't help urging him on. Do it! Do it! It's not a good enough role or movie for Lockhart's performace to be worthy of his best, but he sure makes the most of it. September 8, 1939.\n\nBLACKWELL'S ISLAND * 1/2 I'm late to the John Garfield Appreciation Society, but he's a terrific actor. His debut in Four Daughters is magnetic -- Brando and Jimmy Dean before there was a Brando or a Dean. One year later he stars in five films; one of them is pretty good and it ain't this one. Here Garfield is a crusading journalist, ready to pick a fight with any mobster who gets in the way of truth, justice and the American Way. His antagonist is a buffoon of a gangster named Bull Bransom who dotes over two giant Dobermans and plays practical jokes on everyone in sight. Stanley Fields easily slips from dopey to menacing in a soft soap version of Joe Pesci in GoodFellas. The guy might give you a gag cigar one moment and order you killed in the next; we buy the sense of danger embodied by Bull. It's not enough, though. Garfield gets Bull tossed in jail but the man is soon running the entire prison. The warden and guards -- either crooked or scared -- are in his pocket. So of course Garfield gets himself tossed in jail, uncovers the corruption, pairs off with a new city official pledged to clean up the town and they save the day. Early on, Garfield is rattling on about the press and tosses in a \"see?\" a la James Cagney. It's a good comparison since like Cagney, Garfield can play a good guy, a bad guy and all the gray in between. But even he needs a good script. Opened March 25, 1939.\n\nBULLDOG DRUMMOND'S SECRET POLICE *\n\nBULLDOG DRUMMOND'S NEW BRIDE *\n\nBulldog Drummond is a staple figure in pulp fiction, radio, movies, TV, theater and graphic novels ever since H.C. McNeile began dashing off the novels in 1920. Bulldog is a wealthy adventurer looking for kicks after WW I trained him in the deadly arts and then peacetime spoiled the fun. Ten different actors gave it a go, including Ronald Colman, Ralph Richardson and Ray Milland. For some reason, John Howard as the 11th Bulldog stuck, at least for eight films in a B movie series from Paramount. The last two came out in 1939 before the series took a much needed break. For a low budget franchise, the movies had a solid cast, including Howard (best known for The Philadelphia Story and Lost Horizons) as the lead and dependable folk like H.B. Warner as the long-suffering arm of the law, E.E. Clive as an unflappable gentleman's gentleman, Reginald Denny as clumsy best pal/comic relief Algy, harmless Heather Angel as the love interest and tart Elizabeth Patterson as her aunt. It would be impressive if the results weren't so dire. I can't decide if I'd actually seen these movies before or they're just such cookie cutter exercises in formula it merely SEEMS like I've seen them before. In the poorly titled Secret Police, Bulldog is about to marry his fiancé when a cipher to buried treasure and bodies throw a monkey wrench in the proceedings. The film is barely an hour long but takes about three hours to get to the business at hand, includes a ludicrous shoot out in a library where the two gunmen are about eight feet apart and I kept losing track of the plot. Apparently, Bulldog's failure to actually marry his honey is a running gag in the series and the film ends with the nuptials delayed yet again. The joke is on Bulldog in Bride, with everyone determined to see the couple wed. A bank robber tries to interfere but this only sends the gang to France. Sure, a criminal mastermind is tossing bombs here, there and everywhere while searching for his stolen but missing loot. But the police literally turn the other way, far more focused on watching love prevail. It's almost funny, but alas, not quite. A modest professionalism keeps the whole affair this side of farce, unfortunately, but apparently no one wanted to see a married Bulldog and this particular series ended. Secret Police released April 14, 1939. New Bride released September 18, 1939.\n\nTHE CAT AND THE CANARY * 1/2 The 1922 stage melodrama set in an \"old, dark house\" has been turned into multiple films over the years. A 1922 film version is already billed as a comic/horror film and is very influential in terms of its visuals. But the best known version is this 1939 spin starring Bob Hope and Paulette Godard (who was perhaps becoming Mrs. Charlie Chaplin that same year). We're told this one is the real comedy version of a haunted house story but you'd have to be told that to know. Bob Hope's character is a joker but the rest is played strictly for suspense as far as I can tell. And for Hope, that's a good thing. His amiable coward act is coming into focus here and it works much better when there's actual danger, rather than just one-liners and schtick to contend with. But whether you consider this a comedy with suspense/horror elements or a suspense/horror film with comedy elements, it's definitely a bore. Deep in the bayous of Louisiana, the surviving relatives of an eccentric nut are meeting in his spooky mansion cut off from the mainland to hear the reading of his will at midnight, ten years after he died. (They must ride a canoe to get there so they're all trapped there until morning.) The housekeeper Miss Lu (Gale Sondergaard) is a morose creature in all-black who communes with spirits and immediately predicts one of the people gathered will die that night. You've got two old biddies (Elizabeth Patterson, Nydia Westman), a young guy who snaps angrily at everyone (John Beal), what's intended as a heartthrob (Douglass Montgomery, a man with one too many \"s's\" in his name), the executor (George Zucco), a pretty young heroine who is well-known for her magazine illustrations (Godard) and a popular comic (Hope). Oh and there's a black cat and an escaped lunatic from the local asylum prowling the grounds, a maniac known as \"The Cat.\" While Hope takes mild digs at the entire set-up of everyone trapped in a haunted mansion, the pretty young woman who is sure to inherit everything (as she does) and so on, the movie is flat and unfunny from start to finish. Among the many idiocies, the executor goes missing (they're trapped on a tiny spit of land and there's no getting off) but does this prompt them to search the house from top to bottom or, you know, panic? It does not. Even when they find the body, everyone merrily troops off to their own isolated rooms for the night. Again and again, people wander off alone into dark secret passages when any sane person would call out for help and gather everyone around. Even in 1939 this was dumb stuff. And again, except for Hope's asides, it's all played strictly for suspense. Hope is the only saving grace, acting with restraint and charm while refining his cowardly lion persona to a sharp point. The only reason to watch this is to see a star come into his own. Opened November 10, 1939.\n\nCHARLEY’S (BIG-HEARTED) AUNT no stars – The umpteenth version of this tired farce that involves cross-dressing is very threadbare with cheap production values, no standout talent in the cast and the feeling that you’re watching some community theater troupe delivering a very bored performance of a play they’ve done one too many times.\n\nTHE CITY ** This documentary short is about 43 minutes and a clean print can be found on YouTube. It's a rather didactic look at urban planning. Cities are bad and filled with smog and drunkards an unwholesome living. Rural life is great, but we can't all live on farms. The solution? The planned community of tomorrow. It's not the suburbs so much as smaller cities with lots of green space and the like. Nice touches include a babble of voice-overs that capture the hubbub of a metropolis and glimpses of traffic and crowds and automated pancake flippers in a diner that is half Modern Times and half Koyaanisqatsi. Other than the weird but not unappealing EPCOT future it imagines, the main draw is a score by Aaron Copland. Heavy-handed but not so far off the mark and well-assembled by pros all around. Opened May 26, 1939.\n\nCOAST GUARD * -- A silly programmer starring Randolph Scott and Ralph Bellamy. The backdrop of air and sea rescue by the coast guard is merely there to heighten the romance as two best pals fall for the same gal. Bellamy is of course the straight arrow, dependable type while Scott is a womanizer. Bellamy and Frances Dee are all but engaged yet he’s no fool – he does everything he can to keep her away from Scott. Then, in a typically illogical move, he goes away and asks Scott to keep an eye on her. Naturally, they fall in love and Bellamy is crushed. Then the movie gets really dumb as Scott and Dee get married and make each other miserable while Bellamy stands around waiting for it to all fall apart. High adventure strikes as Bellamy gets stranded near the north pole and Scott goes to rescue him. (Bellamy spends days alone and unconscious on the ice in a horrible storm, but a spot of tea revives him nicely.) The model work done for the coast guard scenes is very dated; you can practically see the toy ships floating in a tub. The romance is unconvincing on every possible level. And Bellamy really is a vampire of a movie actor, sucking the life out of every scene he’s in. Almost any gal would rather be miserable with Scott than bored with Bellamy. Opened August 4, 1939.\n\nCODE OF THE SECRET SERVICE * -- Second of four films in the Ronald Reagan series as Brass Bancroft. See Secret Service Of The Air. Opened May 27, 1939 (but not in Los Angeles).\n\nCONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY ** -- This film is far more interesting in its production and release history than the actual film itself. Still, the movie remains fascinating for what it shows and what it imagines in America in 1939 just prior to Nazi German plunging the world into war. It's prescient, damning and kind of remarkable. If only it were a little better.... Warner Bros. made the film and released it in May of 1939, four months before Germany invaded Poland and WW II started in earnest for Europe, at least. Nonetheless, it doesn't pull any punches. A German doctor (Paul Lukas) comes to the US to agitate among German Americans, urging them to embrace the Fuhrer's campaign against democracy and inferior races. He's shown preaching to willing audiences at German-American clubs, winning over a loser of a guy named Kurt (Francis Lederer) who likes to pretend he's important and a big thinker. Kurt is soon spying in a ham-fisted but effective manner (Americans are so trusting!), drawing in a big galumph of a pal behind him. Fistfights at American Legion Halls, Nazi propaganda being tossed out of skyscraper windows and from planes -- the Nazis are blanketing the country with their poison and America seems ready to boil over with tension. Edward G. Robinson, an FBI agent, is called in to crush the spy ring and naturally succeeds. In classic propaganda style, the Nazis are all portrayed as sad or hateful characters. Kurt is a loser, the doctor cheats on his wife and so on. There's a compelling sense of menace for a while. Robinson does a good job playing on their weaknesses to garner info but the second half is a lot less fun. The other major studios HATED this movie. They tried to get WB to dump it. They offered to pay for the entire budget if they could bury it. Why? Because they wanted to keep open the lucrative movie market in Germany and other countries that might have sided with it. WB persevered...and for their troubles got a flop. They re-released it again in 1941 with an update on what the Nazis had done since the movie first came out (an invasion here, an atrocity there). Watch it and you'll be even more puzzled and intrigued about how it was Japanese Americans were wrongfully imprisoned during the war and yet not a peep was said about Americans of German or Italian descent...even after an actual, honest to goodness Nazi spy ring -- The Duquesne Spy Ring -- was busted in 1941. No one ever said prejudice was logical. Opened May 6, 1939.\n\nCONSPIRACY * ½ -- A smidge under one hour, this B-movie (or C-movie, really) is a vague little political thriller that makes no sense. Allan Lane (best known for playing a Canadian mountie in serials and as “Rocky” Lane in a bunch of minor westerns) stars as a straight arrow American. He’s working on a ship as a radio operator; it’s pulling into harbor in a foreign country when he discovers a shipmate sending a coded message, probably about that mysterious cargo they’re carrying! Lane asks too many questions and before you know it the ship is boarded by the foreign military, the shipmate is dead and Lane must dive into the waters for his life – he slips onto land, soaked and bedraggled, only to immediately befriend a lovely woman (Linda Hayes) standing on the docks. Intrigue mounts: her brother was the shipmate sending the message, the ship is carrying material for poison gas, the country is a police state where no one is safe and Lane has been declared dead so now the government is determined to make that a fact so no questions will arise from the US embassy. It’s another 1939 movie that reflects the tense times with war in Europe and Asia exploding into the headlines. We never know the country so Hayes and half the cast must walk around speaking with a vaguely foreign accent, a hilarious decision that proves the only entertaining part of the movie. (“Trouble” becomes “twouble” and so on.) In real life, Lane was a football star at Notre Dame, so in one scene he’s describing a great game he played only to discover that the nightclub owner (an ex-pat named Tio) is a famed but disgraced college football coach gone into exile for gambling on the game. Tio’s sidekick? A former horse jockey, naturally, who says things like, “Now that’s what I call a photo finish!” after a close scrape with soldiers. The gang wanders around avoiding the police and the military, very little of it making sense. For example, Lane is a desperate fugitive but when he’s hiding alone in the apartment of Hayes and someone knocks at the door, he answers it! Hayes is particularly weak, delivering many of her lines in a stilted, awful fashion (she was a runner-up in Jesse L. Lasky’s “Gateway to Hollywood” radio talent search contest -- see The Marshal Of Mesa City -- but got a contract from RKO anyway, dropping out of the biz after three years then giving birth to Cathy Lee Crosby). Lane plays an unflappable American, always ready with a wisecrack and a sunny personality. He’s a pleasant screen presence and almost makes this watchable; with a lucky break or two he would have been a much bigger star. Opened August 1, 1939.\n\nTHE COWBOY QUARTERBACK no stars -- Dire stuff. A B movie programmer about a hick named Harry Lynn who comes to play for the Chicago Packers. Complications ensue when his bossy girlfriend is sent back home, the cowboy falls in love with another gal who couldn't care less about him (at least she's got taste). Somewhere in the middle, gangsters swindle our hero and try to force him into throwing the big game. The redoubtable William Demarest is the fast-talking talent scout who signs the speedy yokel. Marie Wilson is the um strong-looking girlfriend. And vaudeville star Bert Wheeler of the famed duo Wheeler and Woolsey doesn't impress as the dim-witted athlete. It doesn't help that he was 44 at the time, about 24 years older than a rookie footballer should be. It would clearly be better to try and spot Wheeler's talent by seeing one of the many shorts he made with Woolsey. But this sure doesn't make you want to. Clem Bevans --who always plays an old codger -- appears briefly as an old codger delivering the mail. Opened July 29, 1939.\n\nCUATRO CORAZONES ** -- This curiosity from the nascent Argentine film industry is no one's idea of a great movie. But it shows how cultures all over the world embraced what Hollywood was accomplishing but put their own spin on it. Hence this fluff set in a nightclub where every night the owners embraces an entirely new decor, songs are accompanied by a Busby Berkley-style revue with endless dancers waving their arms about and romance is in the air. For all that, it has a unique stamp: the mood toggles between light romance and tear-jerking melodrama, an unwed mother is at the heart of the story but her being unwed is a mere fact (not a scandal) and while we spend the entire movie watching as two couples are prepared for the happy ending, only one of them gets it. Indeed, the second, most enjoyable coupling seems to have occurred ONLY to the audience, not the characters. Enrique Santos Discépelo is the unlikely heart of the film. He's small, less than handsome and a fast-talking character -- Warner Bros. would have kept him on tap for \"color\" in a hundred films. And just when you expected him to be rat-like or at least lecherous, he proves inherently decent and quite fun. In real life, Discépelo was already famous for his tangos, having burst on the scene in 1928 and composed the all-time classic \"Cambalache\" in 1934. He was a figure in theater and nightclubs and with this film, Discépelo was surely the driving force: he co-wrote the script, co-directed with Carlos Schlieper (who went on to a substantial film career) and starred. The melodrama centers on insipid blonde Irma Córdoba, the unwed mother. Some bizarre laws mean the child's father will be able to claim the boy when he turns five years old, so she must keep the child hidden...in the home of her maid. Desperate for money, she and her pal Gloria Guzmán get hired as dancers in Discépelo's nightclub. Cordoba creates a near riot when her ne'er do well gambler husband (or his henchmen, I got confused) track her down. She flees out a back way and naturally the manager agrees to keep her friend on at double the pay because who can resist playing a white knight when a blonde is involved? The heartbreaking story of a mother fighting to keep her child is a bore, with Córdoba p-laintively saying the boy's name over and over -- while the kid himself, despite very limited screen time proves the least convincing of all. All the fun happens with Guzmán and Discépelo. She's got an angular, odd face that Almodovar would love. The men swoon over Córdoba but you want to spend time with Guzmán. She gamely tries to dance, spars with Discépelo and then the two of them bond when they take the kids out on excursions. (Córdoba presumably stays in her room, weeping.) The nightclub is a financial failure, the gambling boyfriend is closing in and it all comes to a head in a madcap finale turned tragedy turned sort-of happy ending. Did I mention Alberto Vila? He's the blander than bland romantic love interest for the blonde Córdoba. When he's not belting out romantic ballads amidst a bevy of (unpaid) showgirls, Vila stands around looking bored. Naturally, he and Córdoba are paired off at the end. That leaves a black widow of a woman on the outs -- she's a dour character (played by Herminia Franco) who loves Vila, writes checks to keep Discépelo's nightclub afloat and everyone else pays as little attention to her as possible, so shall I. The shocker is that Guzmán and Discépelo aren't paired off at the end. They seem to be having fun together, with her realizing he has a good heart and he loudly proclaiming to one and all he's fallen in love. Since he barely sees the blonde, we assume he means Guzmán but at the end of the film it's clear only the (Ameican) audience even considered the idea. Cuatro Corazones isn't good by any stretch, but it's not bad. And the sense of Hollywood filtered through an Argentine sensibility, not to mention the very casual acceptance of an unwed mother, keep the interest high. And Discépelo and Guzmán had the goods. The studio system would have thrown them together again as the subplot in another film. In real life, Discépelo only made a few more films before dying unexpectedly in 1951 while Guzmán focused on the theater for the next 15 years and only returned to the movies in 1954. Opened March 1, 1939 in Argentina.\n\nDANCING CO-ED * ½ -- When the distaff part of a famous dancing team gets pregnant, the studio decides to turn it into a publicity stunt. They hold a nationwide talent hunt at colleges across the country to find the perfect female co-star for dancing dreamboat's next movie. But why take chances? The studio plants a ringer (Lana Turner) in a small mid-western college. The school reporter is convinced it’s a scam, only to have the ringer herself “work” with him to see if they can spot the plant. Nothing special. Opened September 29, 1939.\n\nDARK MAGIC * 1/2 -- Robert Benchley proves an unlikely comedy star. For me, his humor works better on the page. But here he is, starring in a string of comic shorts for seventeen years from 1928 through 1945 and the only thing that stopped him was Death. Many are droll essays, I think, on topics like \"How To Read\" with Benchley poking fun at himself as an expert. (John Hodgman owes a debt.) Then in 1937 he took on the persona of Joe Doakes, a bland character fairly indistinguishable from Benchley except that Oakes doesn't address the camera. In this flat comic routine, he's a sad sack husband looking for a gift to give his son, who he assures the clerk is NOT the brightest of bulbs. They alight on a magic trick set, with another employee smoothly performing trick after trick. Easy! He brings it home then struggles to recreate the magic. (Being a man, of course, he never bothers to look at the directions.) The son looks on with cynical disbelief while Doakes waves off his wife any time she intrudes. It ends with one elaborate trick finally working. Oakes puts himself into a giant bag and disappears...only to reappear dangling on telephone wires high above a street for the visual button. It's thin stuff and you can imagine Benchley shamefacedly hoping none of the other Algonquin set stumbles onto it at the cinema. (Opened May 13, 1939)\n\nDARK VICTORY ** -- Bette Davis just walks into a room and you love her and hate her with equal passion and you most certainly can't stop looking at her. She's always prowling around in this melodrama about a vivacious young woman suffering a dreadful, terminal illness. Davis strides across her estate, thunders into the stables, cuts a swathe through her own dinner party, slices from room to room while barking out orders to her servants and even at the end when her sight is dimming and she has mere hours to live, Davis grabs desperately at doors and bed posts and walls to guide her path and keep her moving right up to the final shot where she lies down on her bed (atypically empty now that she's been redeemed) and sprawls across it in glorious, I'm ready for my close-up style to die. It's a pity absolutely everything around her is such a bore. Well, not Bogie. Humphrey Bogart is the man in charge of her thoroughbreds and his disdainful, teasing attitude towards his boss is the film's best -- if minor -- element. That's the set up for the film --- Davis a single, wealthy heiress running around and doing as she pleases, catered to her by her devoted secretary and best friend Geraldine Fitzgerald and nothing can stop her except for those blinding headaches...and a crash on a horse...and a tumble down the stairs that doesn't kill her but convinces her she might just need toi see a doctor. He rushes Davis to a specialist who falls in love about thirty seconds after she falls in love with him and twenty seconds before he diagnoses a brain tumor. They operate but it's no good -- ev every doctor concurs with the hilariously precise opinion that Davis will live ten months in perfect health when her sight will dim and within hours she will die. The surgeon George Brent chooses to keep this secret so she can enjoy life to the fullest. Of course she discovers the truth and suspecting him of merely pitying her, Davis goes on an epic romp, seeming to drink and smoke her way through every bottle, cigarette and eligible bachelor in sight. (Ronald Reagan as an affable drunk barely enters our consciousness, though he has a few scenes.) But then Bogie makes his own play (in the movie's best, most emotionally complex scene). Unfortunately, she rejects him and rushes back into the arms of Brent. In the movie's most hilarious segue, she's moved to Vermont and happy by god, happy! You can tell because she's rushing around outdoors, asking the mailman how is sciatica is doing and sporting a plaid shirt worthy of a lumberjack. Davis dressing down can't be taken seriously. Did the lights dim? Happiness of course has no place in a weepie and Davis is soon nobly dispatched. She and Brent are such a dull couple it's hard to believe they paired up in real life but pair up they did. I'd rather see Davis whoop it up with the boys or take a tumble with Bogie but this is a woman's picture and all about nobility. For all its nonsense, you can't take your eyes away from Davis for a moment. She's angular and angry and fidgety -- has a great actor ever seemed more uncomfortable onscreen than Davis? She manages that trick so compellingly that you know she's miserable and desperate and passionate and smarter than everyone else and might just say or do damn near anything and that's why you love her. Her character may be dying but she's completely alive. Opened April 22, 1939.\n\nDAUGHTERS COURAGEOUS * ½ -- The backstory of this film is more interesting than the movie itself, a rather dull domestic drama. In 1938, director Michael Curtiz made Four Daughters, starring Claude Rains as a widowed music professor with four lovely daughters in a college town. Three of the sisters were played by three real life siblings – the Lane sisters – and they all juggled boyfriends and fiancés with ease. It was light, pleasant fare until John Garfield walked in from an entirely different movie. While they’re acting in a studio-bound bit of froth, Garfield burst onto the screen (in his movie debut) as an angry, rebellious, cynical loner. Garfield is positively magnetic and became an instant sensation. Where the other suitors look polite and wholesome, Garfield actually looks like he might do something with Priscilla Lane’s character. He’s a genuinely dangerous fellow. That film was a big box office hit and inspired two direct sequels – Four Wives and Four Mothers. But the real oddity isDaughters Courageous. It amounts to a do-over of sorts, a darker and stranger little movie with much the same cast and some crucial differences. You have the same four daughters and John Garfield as the loner who romances Priscilla Lane. Instead of a widowed father you have a lonely mother abandoned by her husband Claude Rains some 20 years earlier. She’s about to settle down to marriage with a dull but kindly businessman when in pops Rains, ready to upset the apple cart. He approves heartily of Garfield, recognizing a fellow nonconformist and quickly wins over the girls, even though he’s been the most absent of fathers and doesn’t even know which is which. In a really ridiculous scene, he has just arrived. The whole family gathers in the living room with their various beaus while Rains sits literally in the corner some 20 or 30 feet away and is roundly ignored. SPOILER: the dull businessman plans to pay for acting school for one of the girls and give another one’s fiancé a VP job in his company. Rains wants back in and his wife still loves him, but she asks him to leave for good anyway. He talks Garfield into dumping the daughter so she won’t suffer the way her mother did all those years ago. Rains and Garfield hop on a train and head off for adventure, the daughter and mother pair off with their dull intendeds and sit down to dinner, a sad depressed look in their eyes as they accept domesticity and safety over real passion and fun. Everyone seems haunted by the sound of a train in the distance. You can’t help feeling they’ve made a terrible mistake and the only pleased person at the end is the dull businessman. Spinning off sequels of a hit film makes sense. Making a sort of strange remake of it, while emphasizing the bitterness and sadness of their square existence was truly a bizarre decision. Opened July 22, 1939.\n\nTHE DAY OF REST * (short) -- Another Robert Benchley comic short. Here he's hoping to snooze in the backyard on a lazy Sunday. The kids are noisy, the maid is cleaning and Benchley looks perturbed, though W.C. Fields he's not. He tries cleaning out the attic, taking a picnic in the country, playing badminton, you name it! Finally, he sits on an absurd, u-shaped lounger insisting that solitude is the key to a day of rest...when a large crowd of friends bursts into the backyard. Zoinks! Opened September 6, 1939.\n\nDUST BE MY DESTINY ** John Garfield burst onto the screen in 1938's Four Daughters. In 1939 he made five films and none of them were good. But Garfield was always good in them. This is the best of the lot and if I was grading on a curve I might give it 2 1/2 stars. Garfield is very strong as a wrongly imprisoned man who decides the deck is stacked against him and he won't be a sucker any more. Even better, he's paired again with Priscilla Lane of Four Daughters; their chemistry here is terrific. The minute Garfield is released from prison, he hops a train with two kids, including Billy Halop of the Dead End Kids. A tough guy almost chokes one kid to death until Garfield interferes. So naturally he's sentenced to 90 days on a work farm. (Hey, talking back to the judge doesn't help.) There he tries to remain aloof but sweet and kind Priscilla Lane wins him over. Before you know it, her cruel stepfather is hurting the girl, Garfield steps in to stop it and the old bastard dies of a heart attack. They go on the lam because Garfield believes no one will take the word of a bum like him. What follows is a picaresque journey where kind people keep giving therm the benefit of the doubt but Garfield is too wounded to lower his shield or see any real goodness in the world. In one very effective scene, they're married on the cheap via a stunt at a stage show; their pain at sharing this intimate moment with a raucous crowd is quite moving. A nice Italian deli owner, a kindly woman in a store and a friendly newspaper editor all lend a hand. It climaxes with a court room trial where the love of Priscilla Lane is Garfield's only chance to win over the jury. Every witness is desperate to speak up for our hero but apparently the defense never gets to cross-examine a single one. Opened September 16, 1939.\n\nEACH DAWN I DIE *** -- A prison film that hews so close to the genre, I wasn’t sure if I’d seen it before. James Cagney stars as a crusading journalist. When he gets too close to uncovering corruption, Cagney is framed: henchmen knock him unconscious, pour liquor all over him and place him in a runaway car. It careens out of control and kills three innocent people. The courts throw the book at him while taunting Cagney with the fact that his paper denounced drunk driving. Cagney enters jail convinced for some reason that he’ll be out in days, even though the powers that be (the governor, the head of the parole board, etc) are all determined to see he never makes it out. Inside, Cagney befriends George Raft, a fellow con serving 199 years. Cagney proves a good egg and the only guy without an angle so Raft takes a shine to him. When Cagney helps Raft break out, Raft determines to find out who framed his pal and spring him the legal way. You’ve got everything here: sadistic screws, dumb but lovable mugs (like a guy who is serving time because he was a dog catcher but couldn’t bring himself to kill the pets and kept setting them free) and one guy wound so tightly he’s constantly ready to explode. Interestingly, the Warner Bros. film makes an oblique point about the dehumanizing effects of prison and especially solitary confinement. (A few months in the Hole turns Cagney into a whimpering baby – it’s kind of surprising how often Cagney broke down and showed a weak side to his tough characters.) It’s a trim, well-acted 92 minutes until a positively nutty prison riot and a last-minute death bed confession, all so we can have a happy ending. Opened August 19, 1939.\n\nEVERYBODY'S HOBBY * -- Warner Bros. launched the Hobby Family in a poor attempt to duplicate the success of Mickey Rooney and the Hardy Family. In this case, the gimmick is that everyone has a hobby. The wife collects stamps, so poor Irene Rich furiously licks stamps in every scene she's in. I hope she got hazard pay. The son turns into a ham radio nut. The daughter is just mad about getting the latest 45s...almost as crazy as she is for the slightly sleazy Latin lover at the record store who showers her with gifts and is about twice her age. (While the clerk -- who turns out to be a thief -- is a bit of a cliche, the family makes no cracks about his ethnicity or his age, so there's that.) The uncle's hobby is avoiding work. And dad (a fine Henry O'Neill) has no time for a hobby. He's too busy dealing with a new boss at work demanding Dad publish sleazy stories at the newspaper. Dad won't do it! He's so frustrated, that mom suggests he take up an old hobby again: photography. Soon Dad has the hobby bug too so he and his son head off to the woods on a camping trip. Dad will worry about teh newspaper being closed down for good when he gets back. It all works out and in just 54 minutes. A pyromaniac has been terrorizing the area. When yet another fire breaks out, the hobby of the son's ham radio allows them to save the dad. And dad's camera successfully captures the criminal in progress so an arrest can be made and the newspaper can be saved. The daughter and the lothario part ways, mom's stamp collection allows them to buy a new car to replace the one burned (I think; the details are already escaping me) and the uncle is cornered into going to work. Huzzah. It's forgettable except for two fun little moments -- the movie may be bad but it does happily embrace two cliches. When the father and son are trapped in a burning forest, we get one especially cheesy shot of them \"jogging\" through the fire and out of danger. They're clearly bouncing back and forth in front of a screen where the image of a burning forest is being projected. God bless 'em, they even \"dodge\" a falling tree in one of those hammy moments people would satirize for years to come. In another scene, the evil owner of the newspaper actually barks out, \"Stop the presses!\" Spotting cliches like that? It's a hobby of mine. Opened August 26, 1939.\n\nEVERYTHING HAPPENS AT NIGHT * -- If you’ve ever wondered how ice skater Sonja Henie became a movie star for a few brief years, this film will still leave you wondering. As an actress, Henie skates beautifully. Here in her most substantial role, Henie plays the daughter of a Nobel Prize-winning author hiding from publicity and the Nazis. Ray Milland and Robert Cummings are two reporters both hot on his trail and hot for Henie. They vie for her affection while taking way too long to figure out what is really going on and then, of course, trying to protect her and papa from the Nazis. Dull. Opened December 22, 1939.\n\nFAST AND FURIOUS * ½ -- Nick and Nora-style married couple are rare book dealers. But they barely glance at a magazine much less discuss books before Franchot Tone and Ann Southern escape the heat of the city to go to a seaside resort where the hubby becomes a judge in a beauty pageant and they all get involved in…murder! Pure nonsense but Tone and Southern have a nice bantering way about them. It's the third of three movies about rare book dealers/crime solvers, each one starring different people. So forgettable I watched it again halfway through before realizing I’d seen it before. The best is 1938’s Fast Company. Opened October 6, 1939.\n\nTHE FIGHTING GRINGO * 1/2 -- Actor George O'Brien made five westerns in 1939 and they're all bad and you can certainly include The Fighting Gringo in that. It features a rancher with a pretty daughter being cheated out of his holdings. With a pretty daughter, you just known Wade Bolton (O'Brien) and his buckaroos are not going to let that injustice stand. He gets the lay of the land by getting a good bath from the local barber (?), sitting in a barrel while the voluble man soaps up O'Brien's hair and rubs his neck and shoulders and chest. It's certainly not a gay scene, not even sub-textually but it sure is odd. Anyway, after a couple of very modest twists, O'Brien taunts each of the bad guys into thinking the other one has betrayed them and then everyone dukes it out at the finale. The final battle includes the baddies breaking down the big doors of the ranch with the lamest battering ram in the history of Hollywood. They grab a not-so-big tree trunk and sling it between two horses. Then they trot the horses right up to the door and rein them in at the latest second, letting a tiny bit of momentum swing the trunk forward to so it can \"tap\" on the door. If you raised and lowered a knocker, it might have the same impact. They do this twice and I thought, \"Well, this could take a while\" but in the next try the whole thing happily tumbled down. It's notable for two reasons. One, it costars Lupita Tovar as the love interest; she starred in the Spanish language version of Dracula, shot on the same set at night as the Hollywood version and considered by many to be superior. And it was written by the prolific but not very good writer-director Oliver Drake. He wrote four of O'Brien's westerns in 1939 and directed Arizona Legion. Here, for whatever reason, the Mexican characters are portrayed as decent, capable people. Not noble or helpless or anything -- just decent people in a jam. The very minor exception is one brief bit of slapstick when a minor character gets tangled in the branches of a tree and falls to the ground. The mild humor is at his expense but since all the other Mexicans are capable, intelligent and the like one can easily ignore it. The perspective is welcome, to say the least. And there's even a good final joke. Bolton seems ready to settle down with the rancher's daughter but the moment a chance for some excitement arises (Wells Fargo needs some guns, pronto!) he's kissing her hand, saying they'll talk again in the spring and running for his horse without a look back. She's notably miffed, but you just can't keep a good cowboy home on the range. Opened August 8, 1939.\n\nFIVE LITTLE PEPPERS AND HOW THEY GREW * -- The first of four movies from Columbia based on the children’s books. Barely an hour long, this is essentially episodic television before television was widespread. In this movie, the dirt-poor Peppers raise themselves while their widowed mom heads off to the factory to work for days at a time, leaving Polly Pepper (Edith Fellows) in charge of her brothers. Their pa died in a mining accident, leaving half of it to Polly. Wouldn’t you know it, the poor little rich boy they befriend is the orphaned grandson of cranky millionaire J.H. King (dependable character actor Clarence Kolb) who is trying to track down that very family so he can fleece them of their share for a pittance? Needless to say, they soon win his heart and not only does he not rip them off, he invites them into his home, though not before adventures with trying to bake a birthday cake for their hardworking mom, measles, and a scare of potential blindness for Polly. Dorothy Ann Seese is the “adorable” littlest Pepper at about four years old and she gets a ton of dialogue delivered in her cutesy little girl voice. Tommy Bond of “Our Gang” is Joey Pepper but they’re all about as anonymous as the story. Fellows holds the center pretty well and Kolb does what he can with a routine part but this is thin stuff. Thank goodness the sequels were all released in 1940 so I don’t have to watch them. Opened August 22, 1939.\n\nFIXER DUGAN ** A B movie set among circus performers that you’ll forget soon after watching. Nonetheless, it has almost by accident two sterling actors who “might have been” if fate hadn’t intervened. Lee Tracy plays the title role, Fixer Dugan. We’re meant to believe a fixer is as much a part of circus life as the lion tamer and the master of ceremonies. He wanders around putting out fires: dealing with local cops, warning off shysters and generally smoothing things out when unexpected problems arise. In a good running gag, Dugan shows up whenever a customer complains they’ve been short-changed by a cashier. He’s filled with righteous rage, apologizes to the customer and fires the chastened employee on the spot! “Honesty is our policy,” he tells the happy customer. Then he really does chastise the cashier…for getting caught. There’s no romance here. Dugan says at one point, “To me, all dames are as cold as yesterday’s mashed potatoes.” But he’s caught between two women anyway: one is a high wire act and the other a lion tamer. They’ve been feuding for years. “I don’t know what I hate the most: her or spinach!” says the lion tamer. But when the aerialist dies in a tragic fall, Dugan and the lion tamer naturally find themselves looking after the woman’s tomboy child Terry (Virginia Weidler). They spend the rest of the movie trying to keep the kid out of the orphanage and outsmarting two dumb guys trying to steal the lions. (I love the bit where Dugan keeps popping a cigar into the mouth of one of the dopes. “Here, have a cigar!” “I don’t WANT a cigar!’) Tracy can do this fast-talking stuff in his sleep. He played the lead in The Front Page on Broadway and if Pat O’Brien hadn’t stolen his part for the film version, who knows? Mind you, he had other problems, such as hard living off screen and a hair trigger temper. Studio after studio signed him to deals and apparently lived to regret it. One studio even apologized to Mexico after his brawls south of the border made headlines during the filming of a movie. Weidler has a ball as Terry, playing along with some cons, undermining others when she thinks the carnies are fleecing people too much, letting kids slip under the tent to see the big show for a nickel a pop and so on. She and Tracy beat A League Of Their Own to the punch with their refrain at sad moments that “circus people don’t cry.” Child actor Weidler was already a major talent, scoring big alongside Mickey Rooney and proving herself a triple threat, when given the chance (she’d head to vaudeville when the movie roles dried up). In 1940 alone she’d have two great parts in Young Tom Edison and especially her scene-stealing work in the masterpiece The Philadelphia Story. But according to IMDB she got shunted aside by MGM when Shirley Temple showed up for teen parts and by 16 years old she was done; Weidler died at 41 of a heart ailment. This is by no means a good movie but you do get to watch some pros making the most of mundane material. Opened April 21, 1939.\n\nTHE FLYING DEUCES * 1/2 -- A timid Laurel And Hardy vehicle in which the lads join the French Foreign Legion. Their best work was obviously done in the shorts but L and H did make a number of movies. This quickie for RKO is an expanded version of their short “Beau Hunks” and it shows, since the movie feels stretched out at 69 minutes. Ollie falls in love with a barmaid and when she spurns him, Ollie plans to commit suicide. He and Stan are about to do the deed when a soldier (who happens to be the barmaid’s husband) convinces them there’s no better way to forget a broken heart than joining the Foreign Legion. They’re game and sign on but after a few minutes of drilling Stan and Ollie wisely realize this isn’t the life for them and decide to leave. The Foreign Legion begs to differ and a wild chase ensues. The modest pleasures here include little extended bits, such as Ollie getting ready to commit suicide only to have Stan interrupt him at the very last moment time and again. Or the jailer locking Stan behind bars and then taking Ollie and locking him in as Stan gets out and then trying to put Stan back in until he gets frustrated with despair over ever having both of them inside the cell and with the door locked at the same time. Very desultory. Opened November 3, 1939.\n\nTHE FOUR FEATHERS ** -- One of many adaptations of the adventure tale by A.E.W. Mason, this 1939 feature film version is widely considered the best. Well, hold on -- my friend Pete saw an early director's cut of the 2002 version starring Heath Ledger that ran three hours long and he says it was vastly superior to the one released in theaters and this Korda extravaganza. I'll agree with him sight unseen since I am thoroughly unimpressed after watching this twice within three years just to make sure my indifference was accurate. The hyped-up boys own adventure involves a young man whose military-obsessed father honors courage and glory above all. So what if you die a horrible, painful death? Anything is better than being a coward! Their entire family history is bursting with war heroes and the father is secretly convinced his milquetoast son will be the shame of them all. Of course, the contempt he can barely suppress for his own son convinces the boy -- Harry Faversham -- that he really is a coward. (The possibilities for why a father would so despise his own son remain unexplored in any version.) Nonetheless, the miserable boy dutifully enters a military career and makes some good friends. Thankfully, his father finally dies and Harry can dump the career he despises and focus on the family estate and the woman he loves. Unfortunately, his father dies just as Harry and his friends are being called into duty to fight for Empire and glory in the heathenish lands overseas. When Harry resigns, his friends and even his fiancé assume Harry is a coward -- rather than being true to his own convictions. Heck, he even thinks the military campaign is a misguided one, but no one cares. They hand over white feathers, a symbol of cowardice and the end of their friendship. His fiancé also turns her back on him so Harry snags another feather to say it's from her and leaves for good. But wait! Harry doesn't actually hate the military or believe the war is wrong or that his family's estate has been neglected for too long. (Even though many people depend on it for their livelihood.) No, deep down he simply is scared of proving a coward. Now he vows to head off on his own and prove his bravery. How? Not by simply rejoining the military but by disguising himself as a mute native, trekking perilously across unknown countries and somehow managing to put himself right in the path of his old friends, save their lives and help win a battle in the process. It's all ludicrous and not helped by the performance of stiff John Clements as Harry. We care so little about Harry or his friends or his dull romance with the unfortunately named Ethne (June Duprez) that it's hard to gin up enthusiasm about his crusade for redemption. (Crusade? About the right word here.) The film is a \"lavish\" Korda production, produced by Alexander and directed by Zoltan. It was filmed mostly in the Sudan and does indeed capture a certain exotic feel, thanks to \"authentic\" locations (i.e. not backlots, though not historically accurate, I assume) and lots and lots of native extras. However, the battle scenes are poorly shot. Again and again we hear fearsome depictions of the enemy massing to attack...but see long lines of \"native\" troops quietly moving into position in a rather dull manner. Close-ups of black and brown people speaking in their own tongue (without subtitles) was perhaps thrillingly unnerving back in 1939. But we see one particular extra in close-up three or four times at three or four different times in the movie. And most of the battles make barely a lick of sense. Overall, one feels the Kordas made the most of their expenses, not quite doing things on the cheap but certainly not giving any sense of scope. And what's with the cockamamie plan of our hero, so thin and unlikely a plan it beggars belief? Somehow Harry tracks down an old pal on a strange continent just in time to save his life during a big battle. They just happen to be the two survivors left for dead, though Harry's friend would rather be dead. Played nicely by Ralph Richardson, Harry's friend had gone blind just before the big battle but managed to hide this minor fact from his troops. Now, what with everyone else dead and he being blind and stranded hundreds of miles from civilization, the poor man despairs and tries to end his life. Richardson is pretty good, giving the film's best performance as the friend who also loved Ethne and then keeping a stiff upper lip over blindness until he believes everyone he knows is dead and all hope is lost. Oddly, Harry never says word one to him. What possible reason could there be for him to remain mum? He never says, \"Cheer up, it's your old friend Harry and we're going to make it home!\" It's cruel really, to not offer the simplest comfort, though the movie doesn't intend for this to seem cruel, just bizarrely noble. So Harry spends days (or weeks, it's unclear) leading his miserable blind friend through deserts and over hills and onto rivers until they reach a British garrison. It's quite dull, a long arduous journey but more dutiful in the telling rather than exciting or challenging. And then and only then does Harry secrete the white feather on his friend's person so it can be discovered much later and the truth be realized: the man he called coward has saved him. The rest of Harry's deeply improbable adventures include him stumbling into another big battle, freeing his captured friends and saving the day, sort of. By the end, we'd rather see Ethne team up with the blind Richardson (at least that would make sense since he loved her and she abandoned Harry). But of course The Four Feathers is too dully conventional for that. This is one of those golden age Hollywood films that has fallen somewhat into obscurity. As it should. Opened August 3, 1939.\n\nFOUR GIRLS IN WHITE ** -- Harmless programmer about young women training to become nurses. It’s as predictable and silly as you can imagine, but not bad for all that. Our heroine Norma Page (Florence White) is a gold-digger, in it to snag herself a husband. Her little sister Pat (Ann Rutherford) is along for the ride. Norma is so savvy that when she is going to be late for her first day of classes she calls in a false alarm and then casually asks for a ride back to the hospital from the ambulance that shows up. In the ambulance is the dashing Dr. Melford (Steve Marshall), who'd be perfect for Norma if he wasn’t so devoted to medicine and research and instead would wise up and just go into private practice and make the big bucks. More her type (or so she thinks) is the playboy Bob Maitland (Kent Taylor), a patient at the hospital that she toys with beautifully. Rounding out the four girls in white are the giggly Gertie (Una Merkel) who flirts with a bumbling orderly (Buddy Ebsen, the same year he almost died putting on that silver paint to play the Tin Man in The Wizard Of Oz) and the saintly Mary Forbes (Mary Howard), who has a baby daughter but for some inexplicable reason can’t see the child more than once a year while she trains to be a nurse so she can make money and be reunited with her baby. You won’t be surprised to know the head of the nurses is a battle ax with a heart of gold (Jessie Ralph) or that Norma discovers a passion for nursing (though not before some wild melodramatic twists.) It all climaxes with a natural disaster and some crazy derring do fit for a season finale of ER. Opened January 27, 1939.\n\nFOUR WIVES ** -- The film Four Daughters was a smash hit in 1938 for director Michael Curtiz and the Lane sisters, who starred. It produced two spin-offs in 1939: one is the sort-of remake Daughters Courageous and the other is this bland official sequel. (The franchise ended in 1941 with Four Mothers; the box office did not suggest a Four Grandmothers, apparently.) The original film's only interest is the blazing film debut of actor John Garfield, doing Brando long before Brando. That film was pure Andy Hardy territory till Garfield showed up and the movie and the Lane sisters were never the same. He died a fiery death but his character haunts the sequel, almost literally. His widowed wife is Ann (Priscilla Lane) and god knows she can't forget him. Yet the Lane sisters move fast. She's already engaged to marry dull music conductor Felix (Jeffrey Lynn) when Ann realizes she is carrying Garfield's baby. He doesn't mind, not a bit of it. You can see why Lynn was on the shortlist to play Ashley Wilkes in Gone With The Wind. Every time Ann falls into hysterics over the memory of Garfield, Lynn professes his love even more. Heck, even the party celebrating their elopement is spoiled when Ann follows his piano playing by offering her rendition of a tune by Garfield and then breaking down in sobs. Does Felix mind? Of course not! The only scene where director Curtiz rouses himself is a bit of bravura during the climax. Ann is in the hospital having given birth to her child prematurely. Felix is in New York conducting the world premiere of a symphony he's arranged by Garfield. (Selfless is his middle name.) And for six minutes not a word is spoken as the piece is played. We see Ann tortured by memories and the kindness of Felix, we see Felix in New York as Lynn apes the moves of a conductor very stiffly, we see her family riveted at home by the music being played, all of it offered up with consummate craftsmanship. It never rises above competent -- the scene is not one for a master class. But still, a six minute sequence of pure music as the emotional climax of a middlebrow entertainment is at least something. And it could have been worse. Just watch Daughters Courageous. Opened December 25, 1939.\n\nTHE FROZEN LIMITS * ½ – Would-be British Marx Brothers called Crazy Gang (with six or so instead of four; I couldn’t be bothered to actually count them all) head to the Yukon Territory to search for gold in a timid tale of nutty old coots, young love and a hidden mine bursting with “ore with an e.” That’s actually one of the more amusing jokes. Another oddball bit of whimsy worked: the Canadian Mounties keep singing in unison wherever they go. That was about it. Opened November, 1939 in UK.\n\nTHE GIRL FROM MEXICO * 1/2 -- Mexican filmgoers had several modest bright spots in Hollywood. In April a prestige pic celebrating Benito Juárez opened up. And in June a modest little B movie gave actress Lupe Vélez an honest to goodness franchise. This nothing of a film spawned seven sequels in all and it's easy to see why. Vélez feels fresh and alive on screen, even if she is playing off the worst stereotypes about Latina women. Dubbed the Mexican Spitfire by the ever-imaginative trades, here Vélez plays...a Mexican spitfire, a singer discovered by a publicity man and whisked from her small town to New York City with the promise of fame and fortune. Instead of a spitfire, like to think of her as more like Lucy Ricardo, though here it's the woman playing the Latin lover while Donald Woods is the white bread love interest. So the girl from Mexico takes part in Lucy-like hijinks and mangles English in the charming manner white audiences love to smile over. Truly, Vélez is a fascinating figure and it's hard to know where her real personality ends and the Latin persona Hollywood and the public expected of her begins. On the one hand, the film plays into those stereotypes entirely. But Vélez fed tidbits to the gossip columnists about her feuds with other female stars and stormy relationships with her male lovers. Fine as far as it goes; she played the game. But it's also possible Vélez was physically abusive to some of those men. I'll have to hold off on a proper appraisal until another biography is written or a new TV movie about her intriguing life is filmed. Her star power can't turn this minor movie into a vehicle worth your time but she's still fun. Woods is the nominal love interest and Linda Hayes is the villain as Woods hateful, lying and viperish fiancee. Needless to say, she's no match for Vélez. But the real fun comes thanks to the chemistry between her and old coot Leon Errol as Uncle Matt. He's supposed to mind Vélez until she can make her nightclub debut. Instead she steamrolls him into taking her all over town: the Yankees, a wrestling match, a nightclub, you name it. They spark off each other nicely so it's no surprise Errol starred alongside her in all eight films. Opened June 2, 1939.\n\nGLIMPSES OF AUSTRALIA * -- A dull, unremarkable short, part of a series dubbed James A. Fitzpatrick's TravelTalks. See exotic Australia -- the flowers, the beautiful women, the gardens, the wide open spaces. Hardly worth dissing until it touts Melbourne and the modern progress of the country in general as a credit to the white race that has established itself some 9000 miles from their mother country, England. And in case you missed it, at the end they tout Australia as a \"white man's paradise.\" Lovely! Opened November, 1939 in UK.\n\nTHE GORILLA * -- An exhausting suspense/mystery film starring the Ritz Brothers. Sort of the poor man's Three Stooges (if there could be such a thing), they are just three numbskulls who don't even bother to differentiate one from the other. In this tepid movie directed by Allan Dwan, a wealthy man finds himself the latest target of...The Gorilla! The newspapers wonder if it's a man or a beast, this mad villain who announces its victims and then kills them 24 hours later. One wonders how an actual gorilla would send notes of warning, but no matter. This wealthy man has a lot of problems: he seems to be sunk into financial despair and someone is putting the squeeze on him to pay back money. His niece is in town with her fiance and doesn't realize her entire inheritance has been squandered. The Gorilla has named him its next victim. Some strange man is lurking outside his mansion and peering in windows during a thunder storm -- spectacularly exposing himself every time lightning flashes though no one ever notices him. The financier has hired the hapless Ritz Brothers to protect him. A REAL gorilla is on the loose. And creepy Bela Lugois is his butler. Patsy Kelly is the maid who just knew she should have turned in her notice and gets off a few good lines and a few good screams. But the film is wildly uninteresting, with secret panels revealing hidden passages in virtually every room and so many twists and double twists that the finale involved not one, not two but three surprises and none of them explained Lugosi's supernatural ability to appear in any room at any time. One star strictly because it involves a guy in a gorilla suit and that has to count for something. Released May 26, 1939.\n\nGUNGA DIN *** 1/2\n\nHAPPILY BURIED * -- An utter bit of nonsense, though not quite goofy enough to recommend. It begins as a sort of quasi-musical and then settles down into a comedic drama. I've noticed this in some other shorts; maybe they wanted to make a musical but couldn't be bothered to pay for more than one song? In any case, two heirs to major corporations are about to marry and thus merge. He is the heir to the leading maker of square-shaped waffle makers; she is the heir to round-shaped waffle makers. Everyone is blissfully happy until the two lovebirds realize the other one somehow imagines their preferred waffle maker will reign supreme. But square shapes are so practical! but ROUND waffles are so pleasing! The wedding -- and the merger -- is off! The young man buries himself alive in a glass-sided coffin beneath his corporate headquarters to prove his love. Gawkers stream down into the hastily dug tunnel so they can stare at the man, who broadcasts live over the radio, singing of his undying love (even if she does prefer round waffles). It's a media sensation! She responds by heading to the World's Fair, where her company's display of the largest waffle iron in the world (on which a full orchestra performs while dancers dance across the surface). It's the hit of the fair and sales are soaring. So the man shows up and sneakily pretends her waffles are inferior...which of course causes the girl to swoon in his arms, since women are really meant to stay at home and make babies. The end. Like you, I imagined a finale where their two shapes would merge and they'd compromise on a star-shaped waffle or the original Belgian waffle shape of a heart...or something! Instead, the woman simply wakes up to her domestic desires and caves in. She should have left him in the coffin. It isn't half as entertaining to watch as it is to describe. Released April 14, 1939.\n\nHARLEM RIDES THE RANGE no stars – In this all black western, Herb Jeffries gives Gene Autry a run for his money as the “dullest singing cowboy” on the big screen. In this case, the production values are even lower and the story so minimal, this film ranks even lower than Autry’s Home on the Prairie. Jeffries is a new foreman of a ranch who suspects foul play in the disappearance of a miner who may have hit a rich vein and has been missing ever since. Lucius Brooks is his sidekick, a fella who never saw work he couldn’t avoid or a word he couldn’t mangle. Brooks seems like a stereotypical “colored” character but in this context he’s just comic relief; sometimes a goof-off is just a good-off. Spencer Williams – the ground-breaking writer, director and producer – is along for the ride in a minor role and also had a hand in the script, such as it is. Williams of course went on to play Andy in the TV version of Amos “n’ Andy. Opened February 1, 1939.\n\nHENRY GOES ARIZONA * -- A movie as dumb as its title. Character actor Frank Morgan gets a rare, almost unique chance to be the leading man in a film. (The Great Morgan barely counts as a film.) A pity that chance came here, a dimwitted Western comedy w Morgan as a down-on-his-luck vaudevillian who discovers he's inherited a ranch out west. So Henry goes Arizona, ungrammatically and unprepared for the bad guys who want to kill him and seize the ranch for their own nefarious but unexplained reasons. Very modest humor is made out of Henry's big city ways and scaredy-cat nature -- he's like Bob Hope without the sexual desperation (and funny one-liners) or Don Knotts without the slapstick. Anyway, he shows up and then tries to leave once danger is afoot but is charmed/shamed into staying by an adorable little girl who claims to be his niece. Naturally, Henry uses his theatrical talents to outwit the bad guys and save the day, not that you'd care. Morgan is such a charming screen presence, you feel sorry for him here. Tucking in the little girl at night, he exudes decency and sweetness -- if only the film had a half-decent script he surely would have made the most of it. Instead, you spend the film looking over his shoulder, wondering when the star of the film is going to make an entrance. Set pieces include Henry facing down a lynch mob by having a delicious meal and lots of beer ready for the gang, greeting one and all like old friends (not bad in theory but blandly done) and oh, well, that's about it. A running bit has Henry surprising himself with a gift for tossing knives; typically absolutely nothing comes of this talent even in the \"action\" climax. Some fine actors do what they can in supporting roles, including gabby Guy Kibbee as a lawyer/judge and Slim Summerville as a sheriff. Virginia Weidler is her usual dependable self as the kid, almost making you care for a minute or two. But when the climax involves a drawn-out bit with Henry trying to mount a horse and getting stuck on a tree limb and so on, you're ready to lynch the screenwriters. They are Florence Ryerson (who at least has one good credit to her name -- she's one of three listed on The Wizard of Oz) and Milton Merlin, who did this and said, Gee maybe I should try TV. Similarly, Owen Davis Jr. is a dreadful stiff as a nominal heroic figure and he turned to producing. Weidler made much better but retired from acting a few years later at 16 years old (!) and shunned the spotlight for the rest of her life. Director Edwin L. Marin is strictly B movie but a lot of B movie directors might have made more out of a pretty strong cast. Or at least put a \"To\" in the title. Opened December 8, 1939.\n\nHOME EARLY (Robert Benchley short) * -- What DID the other members of the Algonquin Circle make of Benchley's shorts? They're dreadful, middlebrow stuff and I imagine Dorothy Parker et al passing over them in silence. Do they pay well? is surely the only reasonable question. In this typical tired tale, Benchley arrives home early from work to discover his wife's bridge party is in full swing. his son is hiding upstairs so Benchley heads to the basement, after hoping to sneak out a copy of the evening paper. Alcohol is stashed in the basement, Benchley consumes, his son uses a pea shooter to irritate the ladies and by the end Benchley has donned an Indian headdress and charged whooping into the living room. It's as dull to write about as it was to watch. Opened May 27, 1939.\n\nHOME ON THE PRAIRIE * -- Gene Autry has to be one of the stiffest movie stars around (except when he’s singing). This very typical B movie plays more like a C or D movie. Autry is a cattle inspector. The bad guys have herds infected with hoof and mouth disease and are trying to sneak them to market and blame the problems on Autry. At 59 minutes, it’s very drawn out, thin fare. It would have made a very dull episode of a half hour TV western. At this length, only the mild songs keep it from getting no stars. Opened February 3, 1939.\n\nHONOLULU * ½ -- Robert Young proves he’s more of a dependable TV presence than a magnetic leading man…even when he plays two leading men. In this movie Young plays a famous movie star looking for a break from his rabid fans. Young also plays a wealthy plantation owner in Honolulu who is a dead ringer for the star. They trade places and complications -- if not hilarity -- ensue. George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, providing the only sparks of humor in this tired farce. Opened February 3, 1939.\n\nAN HOUR FOR LUNCH (Robert Benchley short) * -- Oh dear, another Robert Benchley short, so obvious in its humor you wonder if the Algonquin was all that, after all. In this all too typical piece, Benchley tutors the audience into how to efficiently make the most of your lunch break. He'll get a haircut, exchanged a shirt, check up on a repair, grab lunch and maybe even check out some suits. None of it goes right, as you can imagine. Sadly, so did Benchley. Opened March 18, 1939.\n\nTHE HOUSEKEEPER'S DAUGHTER * 1/2 -- Hal Roach -- a key player in the careers of Laurel And Hardy, Harold Lloyd and of course the Little Rascals -- also directed some features, though his heart remained with shorts. In 1939 he made two movies, the serious drama Captain Fury and this nutty comedy set in the world of newspapers and gangsters. The poster makes it look like a steamy drama and it does star Joan Bennett, now a brunette and all the better for it. She's a gum-snapping gangster's moll in the first scene, breaking up a poker match where the boys are fleecing a customer. What does she care? Bennett has had enough of her boyfriend Victor Mature (in his film debut) and the gang, absconding for her mom's home. There she melts immediately into a kind-hearted daughter, planning to spend some time with mom while the woman's wealthy employers are away. But the handsome son (a bland John Hubbard) is bored with archeology and wants to be a newspaper man. Around him our heroine becomes a sexy siren, of sorts. You know you're not in The Lady Eve territory because his interest in archeology is mentioned once and dropped while Bennett isn't teasing him or flirting but seems unaware of her effect, which dims the pleasure all around. Oh and amidst all this we watch one of the gangsters be cruel to his Broadway star girlfriend -- that raises the ire of a creepy little flower seller named Benny who spends the rest of the movie trying to kill the gangster with poisoned coffee but offing everyone else around him instead, starting with the Broadway star. That headline blaring crime proves the son's entre into the newspaper biz and the real focus of the movie. From crime drama to reformed bad girl to creepy murderer and finally lighthearted comedy a la The Front Page, all in ten minutes. For the rest of the movie, it's all silliness: the boring Hubbard takes lots of notes and tags along with real journalist Adolphe Menjou and photographer William Gargan. You know they're real journalists because all they do is drink, make up stunts to sell papers and sponge off Hubbard. For some reason, they move into his mansion, along with that squirrelly little flower seller Benny (George E. Stone). The \"nuttiness\" and misunderstandings increase until an all hands on deck finale at the mansion crowded with gangsters, returning parents, cops, firemen and the two journalists shooting off fireworks at one and all. For a brief moment, the insanity is kind of amusing, but the moment quickly passes and you emphasize with lead gangster Marc Lawrence when he fires his gun into the air to shut everyone up. Opened October 26, 1939.\n\nIDIOT'S DELIGHT ** Clark Gable's 1939 ended with the world premiere of the hit of all hits, Gone With The Wind, a movie in which the entire world DEMANDED he play Rhett Butler and Gable did, to perfection. But it began with this bizarre oddity, a vehement anti-war vehicle starring a singing and dancing Gable and produced just as the world was sinking into war. Gable is a vaudevillian who serves capably in WW I and tries to pick up the pieces of his shabby career. For a while, he's paired with a drunken old broad posing as a mentalist. They're stuck in nowheresville when he stumbles across Norma Shearer, a half-nutty gal who speaks dreamily of the grand life she should have and why don't they do an act together? Gable is sort of amused and sort of wary but takes her for a bite to eat and then sends the kid on her way in his most appealing, Gable-like manner. She won't take no for an answer and breaks into his hotel room. Well, golly, he's only human. They talk for a minute, she looks up adoringly into his face, he looks down at her and they're poised for a kiss...and the camera zooms in on an open book on the table between them. Gable shuts the book and we fade to black. Yowzah! They are done reading, if you know what I mean. Cut to the train station with Gable kindly saying goodbye to the dippy girl. Many years later, Gable is on the road with \"Les Girls,\" six leggy blondes that garner appreciation from every man in sight. They're criss-crossing Europe and on their last dime when the train they're on stops abruptly on the border between one country and another. War is about to break out and they're trapped at a lavish ski lodge during the off-season, a ski lodge inconveniently located next to a military air strip where planes are constantly taking off as WW II looms. Gable soon has the gals booked to perform so we get to see him trundle around the stage half-convincingly, even when singing \"Puttin' On the Ritz.\" The stranded guests include Burgess Meredith as a crusading anti-war activist, Edward Arnold as a fat-cat arms merchant and a woman (Shearer) with an outrageous accent claiming to be White Russian nobility. Hey, haven't I seen you before? Gable seems to be playing along with whatever game Shearer is up to. But then he finally slaps his hands when he realizes who it is. I guess it has been almost 20 years, but still. Except for having Burgess Meredith summarily shot (off screen), Germans, Brits, Americans and everyone else get along nicely, regret the coming war and all eye the war mongering capitalist Arnold with distaste. SPOILER: the ending is bonkers, with Gable and Shearer trapped in the main hotel area instead of fleeing to the basement when bombs begin to fall. They plan to launch their act and sing \"Abide With Me\" as the entire place falls apart around their ears. That's the international ending, a rather bleak look at the inevitablity of war, though happily it can't get in the way of true love and a vaudeville act. After all, they do survice. TCM also follows this with the US ending, where they skip the hymn, the destruction is less over-whelming and they practice their mentalist act before embracing for the inevitable \"We're alive!V Let's kiss!\" moment. Opened January 27, 1939.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS SPEEDWAY * ½ -- Pat O’Brien stars (rather stiffly) as a race car driver and three time Indy champ who does it all so his kid brother (the even stiffer John Payne) can go to college. Little does he know little bro has chucked school so HE can become a race car driver as well. Even worse, Payne falls for Ann Sheridan, a friend of O’Brien’s long-suffering fiancé that O’Brien positively despises, blaming her for the death of another driver. O’Brien can provide fine support but he’s no leading man. Nonetheless, his vitriol towards Sheridan is so nasty and off the charts I figured maybe he’d had an affair with her or something. No he just can’t stand the sight of her. (Whores get more respect from the wives of their johns than she gets from him.) The brothers break apart after yet another horrifying crash and O’Brien spirals down but by gosh at the big race they bond again and make a dash for the championship. Sure, other guys may have to die along the way, but at least the race track can double as therapy for these two to work out their personal demons. This is a remake of The Crowd Roars (1932) which starred James Cagney and uses a LOT of the same footage, especially since the dependable Frank McHugh plays the same best pal “Spud” Connors in both. It’s quite routine but there’s a pretty fun gag at the very end. Comparing the two movies and seeing how much footage they reused keeps this a curio. Opened August 5, 1939.\n\nJAMES A. FITZPATRICK'S TRAVELTALKS -- series of travel doc shorts.\n\nAncient Egypt\n\nColorful Curacao\n\nA Day On Treasure Island\n\nGlimpses Of Australia\n\nImperial Delhi\n\nJava Journey\n\nLand Of Alaska Nellie **\n\nMendelssohn's Wedding March\n\nNatural Wonders Of Washington State\n\nOld Natchez On The Mississippi\n\nPicturesque Udiapur\n\nQuaint St. Augustine\n\nRural Hungary **\n\nValiant Venezuela\n\nJESSE JAMES * ½ -- 1939 was such a rich year for movies that almost everyone involved in this prestige Western didn’t just do better work in their careers, they did better work and got it released in the same calendar year. The director, star Nancy Kelly and character actor Henry Hull re-teamed on Stanley and Linvingston. Randolph Scott made 20,000 Men A Year which might have become his motto if he wasn’t rooming with Cary Grant. Tyrone Power’s movies from 1939 aren’t well known to me but Henry Fonda made two much better films: Drums Along The Mohawk and Young Mr. Lincoln. Of course they were all proud of this movie about the famed outlaws Frank and Jesse James. In this risible retelling in poorly shot color (I thought for a minute that TCM was showing a colorized monstrosity), the James brothers are noble, decent, honorable men completely done in by a rapacious railroad company. The railroad was jilting their friends and neighbors out of their homes when bullying and conning the poor suckers didn’t work. In a rare effective scene, Frank and Jesse tangle with the nefarious representatives and deliver some frontier justice. “If he ain’t the sneaky one,” says Fonda in astonishment when the ring leader of the bad guys tries to scythe his brother in the back. They’re forced to go into hiding since the strain of their arrest would break their ailing mother. But the evil railroaders dynamite their home anyway, even though they’ve been told repeatedly only a sick, old woman is inside. If that isn’t nasty, I don’t know what is. Frank naturally tracks the killer and guns him down in a fair fight. The brothers are forced to go outlawing, but they prey only on the trains of the company that done them wrong, politely taking only cash from passengers and urging them to sue the railroad to get it back. Everyone loves them, including the local marshal who pines for the same gal as Jesse but does right by them despite double-dealing from the law. There’s what passes for complexity at the time, with Jesse driven to despair and madness over his life on the lam. Essentially these are the most upright fellows a country could ask for and they’re memorialized right to the end when that coward Robert Ford steps in. (Cue the hissing.) It’s a lifeless affair, with Kelly and Power striking no sparks whatsoever. She’s constantly moping and whining out her lines; let Randolph Scott have her, I say. Power and Fonda can’t be all bad but they have very little to do here but bemoan their fate. That initial confrontation is pretty well-acted and their jailbreak is alright, but this is a slow, talky, boring and relatively action free film. As history it stinks. As a film on its own merits, it isn’t much better. It was a big hit and others rate it highly; I assume they haven't watched it in years.

Widely admired by fellow actors and it's easy to see why. Muni deeply researched his roles based on historic figures, demanded path-breaking makeup and effects to pull off his illusion and strove for accuracy at every stage. Marlon Brando once opined Muni was the greatest actor he ever saw. Today we would decry the brownface (or redface) of casting Muni to play the homely Mexican hero of Zapotec r"
