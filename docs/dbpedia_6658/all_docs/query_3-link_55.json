        "text": "The Pioneers of Imagination:The First Science Fiction Stories Ever Written\n\n/\n\nScience fiction—with its fantastical tales of futuristic worlds, advanced technology, and otherworldly beings—has captured the human imagination for centuries. But where did this genre originate? And what were the first science fiction stories ever written? Today, we delve into the early roots of science fiction and explore some of the pioneering works that laid the foundation for this genre's enduring popularity.\n\n1. \"The Epic of Gilgamesh\" (circa 2100 BC)\n\nOne of the earliest known works of speculative fiction can be found in The Epic of Gilgamesh, an ancient Mesopotamian poem dating back to the 21st century BC. While not a conventional sci-fi story, it contains elements of the genre. The tale follows the adventures of Gilgamesh, a Sumerian king, and his companion Enkidu, as they encounter gods, monsters, and a quest for immortality. The presence of gods and fantastical creatures in a historical setting can be seen as early examples of speculative fiction.\n\n2. True History (circa 2nd century AD)\n\nLucian of Samosata, a Greek satirist and author, wrote True History in the 2nd century AD. This work is often considered one of the earliest examples of science fiction, even integrating space travel. Lucian's narrative involves a journey to the moon, where the protagonist encounters bizarre alien creatures, including giant insects and moon-men. True History is characterized by its playful satire and imaginative storytelling, making it a precursor to modern science fiction.\n\n3. \"Somnium\" (1634)\n\nWritten by Johannes Kepler, the renowned German mathematician and astronomer, Somnium is a groundbreaking work in early science fiction. This fictional tale describes a voyage to the moon and explores the lunar environment, complete with lunar inhabitants. Kepler's story is notable for its scientific accuracy and pioneering vision of space travel. Some scientists and science fiction writers—including Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov—consider Somnium to be the first true science fiction novel.\n\nLike what you're reading?\n\nIf you're enjoying this post why not join the DSF community for more awesome content?

It's free to sign up and you'll also get recommendations for new releases and discounted ebooks from our expert editorial team, from bestsellers to hidden gems.\n\n4. \"The Blazing World\" (1666)\n\nMargaret Cavendish, the Duchess of Newcastle, authored The Blazing World in 1666, making her one of the first female science fiction writers. The novel is set in a parallel universe accessible through the North Pole and features a world inhabited by sentient creatures and advanced technology. Cavendish's work challenges societal norms and showcases her imaginative prowess.\n\n5. Frankenstein\" (1818)\n\nMary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, is often regarded as one of the earliest and most influential science fiction novels. Published in 1818, the story explores themes of ethics, creation, and the consequences of scientific experimentation. Shelley's portrayal of Victor Frankenstein's creation of a humanoid creature remains a seminal work in the genre.\n\nThe origins of science fiction can be traced back to ancient myths, satirical writings, and early scientific speculations. These pioneering authors, from Lucian to Mary Shelley, paved the way for the rich and diverse world of science fiction we know today. Their imaginative stories continue to inspire generations of writers, scientists, and dreamers, reminding us that the boundaries of human creativity and exploration are limitless.\n\nJoin the conversation in the DSF Reader Group on Facebook.\n\nhttps://discoverscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Pioneers-of-Imagination-The-First-Science-Fiction-Stories-Ever-Written.png 924 1640 Daniel Arenson https://discoverscifi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/discover-scifi.png Daniel Arenson2023-09-18 12:14:062024-01-18 10:56:22The Pioneers of Imagination:The First Science Fiction Stories Ever Written\n\nSci-Fi Books We Can’t Wait to Read in Winter 2024!\n\n/\n\nBuckle up, sci-fi fans: 2024 is here, bringing with it a plethora of promising new sci-fi releases!\n\nAmong the literary treasures on the horizon are titles from both established and emerging writers, all poised to captivate our hearts, challenge our minds, and transport us to new dimensions.\n\nWhether you're a fan of space opera, technothrillers, or mind-bending speculative fiction, there's something exciting to look forward to in the coming months.

Because we haven't got a moment to lose. Because it's clear that there are even more powerful, more hostile aliens out there, and Earth needs allies.\n\nBut it also transpires that the Shongairi expedition that nearly destroyed our home planet ... wasn't an official one. That, indeed, its commander may have been acting as an unwitting cats-paw for the Founders, the ancient alliance of very old, very evil aliens who run the Hegemony that dominates our galaxy, and who hold the Shongairi, as they hold most non-Founder species, in not-so-benign contempt.\n\nIndeed, it may turn out to be possible to turn the Shongairi into our allies against the Hegemony. There's just the small matter of the Shongairi honor code, which makes bushido look like a child's game. We might be able to make them our friends -- if we can crush their planetary defenses in the greatest battle we, or they, have ever seen...\n\nRead To Challenge Heaven here on Amazon.

But when January accepts the offer, he discovers that Gale is not at all like they appear in the press. They're kind, compassionate, and much more difficult to hate than January would prefer.

Now, they are facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may rest with the humans of Anjiin.\n\nCaught up in academic intrigue and affairs of the heart, Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist and his celebrated research team. Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating the human population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away to serve on the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them.\n\nThey are dropped in the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition against the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure. Only Dafyd and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the deeper game that they must play to survive: learning to understand – and manipulate – the Carryx themselves.\n\nWith a noble but suicidal human rebellion on one hand and strange and murderous enemies on the other, the team pays a terrible price to become the trusted servants of their new rulers.\n\nDafyd Alkhor is a simple man swept up in events that are beyond his control and more vast than his imagination. He will become the champion of humanity and its betrayer, the most hated man in history and the guardian of his people.\n\nThis is where his story begins.\n\nGrab The Mercy of Gods here on Amazon.

When he questions his neighbors, it appears that Denver is the only person to have seen anything – or to care that the residents’ strange behavior, as well as a shower of seashell hail, might be evidence of something extraterrestrial. Being both non-binary and autistic, he’s convinced his reputation as the town eccentric is impeding his quest for answers. Frustrated, he documents the bizarre incidents on his failing pie blog, and his online popularity skyrockets. His readers want the truth, spurring him to get to the bottom of things.\n\nThe only person in town who takes him seriously is handsome bartender, Ezra. As the two investigate over pie and the possibility of romance, the alien presence does more than change the weather. People start disappearing. When Denver and Ezra make a run for it, the town refuses to let them leave. Reality is folding in on itself. It’s suddenly a race against time to find the extraterrestrial source and destroy it before it consumes not only Muddy Gap but everything beyond. Denver’s always been more outsider than hero, but he’s determined to ensure that a world with Ezra – and with pie – still exists tomorrow.\n\nGrab Key Lime Sky here on Amazon.\n\nGlass Houses by Madeline Ashby\n\nRelease Date: 13th August\n\nA group of employees and their CEO, celebrating the sale of their remarkable emotion-mapping-AI-algorithm, crash onto a not-quite-deserted tropical island.\n\nLuckily, those who survived have found a beautiful, fully-stocked private palace, with all the latest technological updates (though one without connection to the outside world).

Waiting for the two explorers on the surface of Proxima-b is the geoglyph—a continent-sized landform that resembles a giant metallic work of art.\n\nIs it a massive ore deposit, an alien message, or something far stranger and vastly more dangerous?
