        "text": "Phyllis Dalton has retired from designing costumes for movies and TV, and she leaves a long, varied resume that features plenty of frock flicks you may remember. In 2002, she was awarded the Member of the Order of the British Empire for her services to the film industry, and in 2012, BAFTA held a tribute evening for her contributions to British cinema. The British Entertainment History Project has a lengthy interview with Dalton from 2000 that you can listen to or read online, where she talks about everything from her school days to behind-the-scenes anecdotes working with David Lean and Kenneth Branagh. Her interest in clothing started early and had a comprehensive, historical bent, as she said in the interview: “I think the sort of social side of history was what I was interested in. What people … how they dressed and what they used and how they lived more than the dates probably. That was always there.” So let’s take a look at some of her work in historical costume!\n\nRob Roy: The Highland Rogue (1953)\n\nJohn Paul Jones (1959)\n\nFury at Smugglers’ Bay (1961)\n\nLawrence of Arabia (1962)\n\n“One of the things was we did actually dress absolutely every last single person you see on that screen, and lots of people think the Arabs all wore their own clothes, but that was another case of being ten identical outfits for everybody, for all the Arabs, all in Lawrenceâs gang anyway.” — Phyllis Dalton, British Entertainment History Project, February 2000\n\nLord Jim (1965)\n\nDoctor Zhivago (1965)\n\n“Itâs usually the womenâs hair that sort of gives it away, even old Julie Christie in Zhivago, you know, with her little bits of traily bits down the side, itâs terribly sixties. Thereâs always something, especially with the hairdressers. It just gives it away. I think weâve got better, but thereâs always something about period costume. It must be something so instinctive, because after all over the years all the people designing period costume think theyâre doing it absolutely authentically, but thereâs always a little ghost in there thatâs contemporary, I reckon.” — Phyllis Dalton, British Entertainment History Project, February 2000\n\n“That scene where Geraldine Chaplin arrives on the train, which most people remember, and sheâs in pink fluffy marabou, I originally did a much more sophisticated design because I thought sheâd been at finishing school in Paris. She had lovely big black sort of fluffy hat and very tight, very, very pale pearl grey outfit. But David [Lean, the director] was … and I was being too practical in that when David said he wanted her white or pink or something, I said she canât sit in the train all that time, and you know, that was me being boring, really. And in the end, you know, obviously you give in and I did the pink outfit and he loved it. And being Geraldine she didnât get dirty.” — Phyllis Dalton, British Entertainment History Project, February 2000\n\nOliver! (1968)\n\nThe Message (1976)\n\nVoyage of the Damned (1976)\n\nUnidentified Flying Oddball (1979)\n\nThe Mirror Crack’d (1980)\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame (1982)\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel (1982)\n\nArthur the King (1983)\n\nA Private Function (1984)\n\nThe Last Days of Patton (1986)\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987)\n\nStealing Heaven (1988)\n\nHenry V (1989)\n\n“Kenneth was so young and it was his first picture, Iâm either going to be an old fuddy-duddy thatâs done too much medieval stuff so he wonât want me, or maybe because I have done lots of medieval stuff perhaps heâll … Anyway, he said I could do it, so that was great. And that was a lovely working partnership, it really was, he was marvellous to work with.” — Phyllis Dalton, British Entertainment History Project, February 2000\n\nThe Plot to Kill Hitler (1990)\n\nDead Again (1991)\n\n“In the end, although it had all been done in colour originally, they then made the flashbacks into black and white, which ruined all my lovely forties costumes. At least they werenât shown in colour anyway.” — Phyllis Dalton, British Entertainment History Project, February 2000\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing (1993)\n\n“That again was very much what Ken wanted to do. Those girlsâ costumes; he wanted them pale, he wanted them to look as if they worked, he wanted them earthy, he didnât want jewellery, and he didnât want corsets, he wanted their bosoms nearly hanging out but no corsets, which is quite a problem to do, you know, when you havenât got any construction. No, he had quite an input.” — Phyllis Dalton, British Entertainment History Project, February 2000\n\nWhat’s your favorite historical costume design by Phillis Dalton?\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMore Frock Flicks"
