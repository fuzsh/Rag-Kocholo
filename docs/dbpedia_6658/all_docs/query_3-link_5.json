        "text": "Peter Cushing always wanted to be an actor as a kid, but he didn’t find success until middle age and mostly with the Hammer horror films. But these became his bread-and-butter, where he portrayed Baron Frankenstein six times and Doctor Van Helsing five times. He also played Sherlock Holmes in both film and TV, though audiences today might know him best asÂ Grand Moff Tarkin from Star Wars. Cushing’s association with Hammer was not only profitable, it created a life-long friendship with Christopher Lee (who played Dracula). I grew up with their movies, along with Cushing as a “bonus” Doctor Who, so it’s about time to give this fine gentleman an MCM feature!\n\nLeslie Stephens in The Howards of Virginia (1940)\n\nOsric in Hamlet (1948)\n\nMr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice (1952)\n\nMarcel de la Voisier in Moulin Rouge (1952)\n\nSir Palamides in The Black Knight (1954)\n\nBeau Brummell in âBeau Brummell,â BBC Sunday-Night Theatre (1954)\n\nOtto Wesendonk in Magic Fire (1955)\n\nGen.
