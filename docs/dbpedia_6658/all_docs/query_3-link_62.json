        "text": "Divided into five chapters, each explores some aspect of Caribbean piracy from the mid-seventeenth through the early eighteenth century. The first concentrates on the buccaneers, from their origins through William Dampier. Among the particular rogues featured are François LOllonais, Bartolomeo el Portugue, Rock the Brazilian, and Henry Morgan. Chapter two explores the golden age, introducing readers to the likes of Henry Avery, William Kidd, Alexander Dolzell, Samuel Bellamy, Woodes Rogers, Alexander Selkirk, and Charles Vane. Edward Teach, Stede Bonnet, Richard Worley, Calico Jack Rackham, Anne Bonny, and Mary Read appear in the third chapter, Heroes and Heroines: The Heyday of Piracy in American Waters. Chapter four is devoted to Bartholomew Roberts, while the fifth chapter focuses on George Lowther, Ned Low, and the suppression of piracy. It ends with a look at Jean Laffite and pirate victims. A bibliography, glossary, and index round out the tome.\n\nThis book isnt your typical history book. It is primarily contemporary accounts  some written by these sea raiders, others from newspapers and broadsides  combined with a narrative that sets up each passage and provides continuity from start to finish. Illustrations, both color and black-and-white, complement the book. Some excerpts, though, come from secondary sources written by Captain Johnson and Charles Ellms. The problem with including the latter is Ellms book, The Pirates Own Book, is primarily a work of fiction, so some information provided on Jean Laffite is inaccurate. The typeface is small, which makes it difficult to read.\n\nThe first sentence of the introduction  Where the majority of men will go about their business lawfully, there will always be members of society who take a different path  encapsulates the history of maritime piracy yet succinctly defines a pirate in terms that equally define any person who breaks the law. Although the romantic imagery of pirates is mentioned, this book adheres more to examining pirates without rose-colored glasses.\n\nAlluring as the pirates profession is, we must not forget that it had a seamy side, and was by no means all rum and pieces-of-eight. And there is something repulsive to a generous nature in roasting men because they will not show you where to steal hogs. (page 9)\n\nFor those whose budgets dont permit them to purchase British Piracy in the Golden Age: History and Interpretation, 1660-1730 edited by Joel H. Baer, this is a wonderful addition to any pirate library.\n\nSubtitled Learn to Draw Fantastic Pirates, Treasure Chests, Ships, Sea Monsters and More, this book provides insight into drawing pirates, their enemies, extras, and the pirate world. Mcleay opens with directions on perspective, generating ideas, and basics a potential artist needs in order to follow Pirate Arrrt! instructions. In chapter two he covers facial expressions, heads, and character angles, while the next chapter focuses on the various crewmembers that populate a pirate ship. Among the enemies youll find cannibals, members of the royal navy, magpies, sea monsters, zombie monkeys, and skeletons. The chapter on extras includes treasure chests, jewelry, weapons, faces and hair, hooks, eye patches, peg legs, and tattoos. The final chapter explores features of pirate havens, such as forts, dungeons, islands, and ports. While many drawings appear in black and white, two spreads of color depict finished pirate artwork.\n\nThis book is geared toward people with a serious interest in an art career, rather than children or doodlers. Its advertised as being for children, but the audience is more for young adult or adult because of the language and complexity of the designs. The reader needs to have some familiarity with drawing before opening this book, but those artists who do will find a chest full of treasure that will help them draw delightful rogues and their world.\n\nThis book combines a chronology with historical articles on the early history of the Florida Keys and Miami over a period of 252 years. Part one summarizes historical documents, which are divided according to whether they were written in the sixteenth, seventeenth, or eighteenth century. Eleven of these summaries concern pirates, and the entries vary from a single sentence to more than a page in length. The first one appears in 1565 and concerns John Hawkins when four of his ships anchored at the Dry Tortugas. At the end of part one are maps, illustrations, photographs, and facsimiles of original documents pertaining to the information in the entries. Included in this collection is documentary evidence of a large gathering of pirates at Key West in 1681.\n\nThe second half of the book is devoted to miscellaneous articles. Each begins with a short introduction that identifies the translator and/or explains sources for the information contained in the article. Of particular interest to pirate readers are Looking for Sir Francis Drake and The Maravillas: Sunken Treasure, Salvors, Pirates and the Florida Keys Indians. There is also an extensive section of endnotes after the articles.\n\nMany documents pertaining to the early history of Florida are written in Spanish, some of which are located in foreign archives not readily available to most readers. This compilation and explanation provides people interested in Floridian, Native American, or piratical history with a single source that is easily read and accessible.\n\nThe USS Chesapeake was one of the six original frigates built for the United States Navy. Launched on 1 December 1799, she set sail on 22 May 1800. She patrolled the Caribbean during the Quasi-War with France and participated in the blockade on Tripoli. Neither of these postings were remarkable, but in June 1807, the frigate made her first mark on history.\n\nWhen Britain was at war, she needed men to man her naval vessels. Unable to entice men to willingly join, the navy used press gangs to force men to serve aboard the ships. Once the United States gained its independence from Britain, it wasnt easy to tell who was an English sailor and who was American. Sometimes British seamen jumped ship and signed aboard American vessels where the pay and conditions were better. Documents to prove American citizenship were easily faked, so the British began stopping American ships and checking for British sailors. This was what happened in June 1807 soon after the Chesapeake put to sea. HMS Leopard fired on her, then sent an officer and men to board the Chesapeake and seize four men they claimed were British seamen.\n\nCommodore James Barron, captain of the Chesapeake, faced a court martial. He was cleared of all charges except that of neglecting on the probability of an engagement, to clear the ship for action. He was suspended without pay for five years. One of those who sat in judgment of him was Stephen Decatur. The animosity between these two men would eventually result in a duel.\n\nRelationships between America and Britain continued to simmer until war broke out in 1812. The following year, the Chesapeake encountered HMS Shannon. In the ensuing brief but bloody battle, 252 men were killed or wounded and the American frigate was captured.\n\nBut what happened to the USS Chesapeake? This is the astounding journey that Dickon reveals in a readable format accompanied by an abundance of photographs and illustrations. Firsthand accounts are interspersed with the narrative to form a more complete story of this frigate from her birth to her demise. A fascinating examination of what became of this early American naval vessel and some of the men who fought on her decks to protect our independence.\n\nTold tales of the pirate ship Whydah and her captain, Samuel Bellamy, as a child, Vanderbilt decided to explore the primary documents of the 1700s and discover the truth behind the legend of this pirate and the wreck of his ship off the coast of Cape Cod. The book opens with the tale of the 1643 Spanish fleet that encountered a hurricane and William Phips determination to locate the missing treasure that disappeared beneath the waves. Stories of his successful find spurred many, perhaps including Bellamy, to follow in Phips footsteps.\n\nAs is true with many pirates, Bellamys origins remain elusive until he steps onto the historical stage in 1716. Just the year before another treasure fleet had sunk off the coast of Florida, and Bellamy decided to attempt to reclaim some of the silver that was lost. Legend says he left to gain his fortune before he returned to reunite with the love of his life, Maria Hallett, but she has remained as mysterious as Bellamys life prior to his sailing. (That Halletts lived on Cape Cod is documented, but no record of Maria has yet come to light.)\n\nBellamy hooked up with Paulsgrave Williams of Newport, Rhode Island, and while they initially searched for the sunken bounty, the sea was reticent to divulge her secrets. They eventually teamed up with Benjamin Hornigold and began plundering ships. One of these was the Whydah, and once their fortunes were made, they sailed north for home. But a fierce storm blew up off Cape Cod, and the ship sank, taking all but a handful of men with her to their graves. Although many contemporaries attempted to recover the sunken treasure, little was found.\n\nNo book on Bellamy and the Whydah would be complete without the story of Barry Clifford and his crew discovering the shipwreck. The original edition of this book ended with proof positive that they had found her  the ships bell with the inscription The Whydah Gally 1716. This revision includes a tenth chapter that discusses what other treasures Clifford has uncovered, the court cases he fought, the conflicts between archaeologists and treasure hunters, and the establishment of a museum in Provincetown on Cape Cod to display the finds. My only complaint about the book is that this chapters different and noticeable format changes appear smaller in font size and lighter in print, which makes it more difficult to read and is jarring to the eye. While there are no footnotes, a section at the end of the book provides information on the authors sources. A nice addition to this edition is an index, which makes it easier to locate information within the book.\n\nVanderbilt also incorporates a lot of pirate history unrelated to Bellamy into his tale, which provides the reader with a better understanding of both the time period and what it was like to be a sea rover. Treasure Wreck is a rousing adventure of pirate success and demise, and the wonder of locating treasure long after the Whydah took the lives of many men so long ago.\n\nThe treasure galleons of Spain enticed pirates and adventurers who sought easy riches, but far more of these ships sank during storms than were successfully seized by scoundrels of the sea. Others, too, sought the lost cargoes of gold, silver, and jewels, but their searches and finds required the skills of divers, who oftentimes dove without any equipment. This book explores the shipwrecks, the divers, and the history of diving from the sixteenth into the early nineteenth centuries. Through the use of primary documents, readers meet the people who financed diving operations and risked their lives to salvage the lost treasures. The primary focus concerns England and her colonies. There are extensive footnotes and bibliography, and the book has a comprehensive index.\n\nIt is known that your islands are peopled by men who are intent rather on pillaging Spanish wrecks than planting, that they carry on their work by Indians kidnapped or entrapped on the coast of Florida . . . The sea ought to be free and the wrecks [belong to] the Spaniards. This quote is from Sir Thomas Lynch, Governor of Jamaica, who students of piracy will readily recognize, but pirates play only a peripheral role in history within Treasure Hunt and are often referred to in a general manner, rather than by specific name. (One exception to this is Laurens de Graff.) Nevertheless, this account of maritime history provides a unique perspective from early divers, who clutched stones and dove beneath the waves, to the men who devised diving bells and other equipment to allow divers to remain under water longer.\n\nBradford, a specialist in ancient history, introduces readers to the history of maritime piracy. The book is divided into eight sections. Greek piracy explores the difference between Odysseus the hero and Odysseus the pirate, before examining the Greeks interaction with their countrymen, Barbarians, and Macedonians. Under the Romans, he looks at the actions they took against pirates, including the Cilicians, and how this scourge was effectively dealt with for a time. Part three, which covers the Viking period, discusses the first invaders, the Rus, and how converting to Christianity brought about the end of Norse piracy. The next era covered in this book is that of the Buccaneers, from their origins to Sir Henry Morgan to Captain William Kidd. Rather than cover the Golden Age pirates of the early 18th century, Bradford concentrates on first the Barbary pirates then the marauders of the south coast of China. Part seven investigates Algerian piracy and the Americans. Finally, he focuses on how people come to be pirates and piracy and terrorism.\n\nMaps and illustrations are included. While passages arent cited with footnotes, a section at the back of the book identifies where quotations can be found. The bibliography includes both primary and secondary sources, and there is an index.\n\nThe idea for this book stems from the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. In the preface, Bradford writes:\n\nTerrorists have operated throughout history, but their ability to attack across large distances with devastating effect and to take thousands of lives is a phenomenon of modern technology, and so an historical study of terrorism would not be particularly relevant to our present situation, but when I amended the question and asked, how should we respond to an attack by a group that is neither organized as a regular military force nor openly acknowledged by any formal government, I thought of pirates and the worlds response to pirates. Who became pirates? Why? And how did nations respond to attacks upon their citizens by pirates?\n\nAnswers to these questions are what Bradford provides as he scrutinizes the history of maritime piracy. And he does so in an easy-to-understand way that is informative and entertaining. Three aspects of this book set it apart from others: 1) ancient piracy, 2) Asian piracy, and 3) why people turn to piracy. Few volumes explore early Mediterranean piracy in much detail, and to have an expert in this period of time makes ancient piracy interesting and enlightening. Asian piracy differs from Western piracy, and the author provides an intriguing look into how China dealt with the problem. His chapter on what makes a pirate is a unique and solid examination of what makes the man or woman forsake society and its rules for a life a crime. My only question in reading the book was why Bradford chooses to refer to Cheng I Sao as dragon lady.\n\nWho hasnt watched at least a few of these films: The Mummy, The 13th Warrior, Captain Blood, Titanic, Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, Glory, Gangs of New York, or Tombstone? Ever wonder how much is based on reality? For thirty-five years, historians have challenged Hollywoods depiction of historical events and times, but history tells only a portion of the past. Archaeology shows us what life was like, and sometimes, much of what we know about a particular period comes almost totally from such exploration, rather than the historical record. In Box Office Archaeology, practicing archaeologists, professors of archaeology, and doctoral candidates in this field of study compare films and other media to their factual research.\n\nThe book is divided into thirteen chapters:\n\n1. The Way of the Archaeologist 2. Unwrapping the Mummy: Hollywood Fantasies, Egyptian Realities 3. Vikings, Vixens, and Valhalla: Hollywood Depictions of the Norse 4. A Pirates Life for Me! But What Did That Really Mean? 5. Titanic 6. Voyage from Myth: Return of the Confederate Submarine H. L. Hunley 7. Pocahontas Unanimated: The Life of a Powhatan Princess 8. The Life and Times of the Ever-changing Hollywood Indian 9. Imagining Blackness: Archaeological and Cinematic Visions of African American Life 10. Five Points on Film: Myth, Urban Archaeology, and Gangs of New York 11. Western Boomtowns: The Lost Episodes 12. Contesting Hollywoods Chinatowns 13. When the Legend Becomes Fact: Reconciling Hollywood Realism and Archaeological Realities\n\nThe first serves as an introduction to what archaeologists do, and those involved in the writing hope that this book inspires the public, students, and scholars to recognize the differences between the mission of the archaeologist and the movie director, yet appreciate the way we learn more about our past from the study of crumbling ruins, dusty archives, and yesterdays garbage. The last is a summary of what the eleven chapters reveal and the need for archaeologists to find new ways to interest people in learning about the past and to make the information they uncover more accessible. Each chapter includes a list of resources the authors consulted. The book also includes an index and a section that explains why each author is qualified to write on his/her chosen subject.\n\nWhy did I select this book to review? I admit to being surprised when it came up in a search for pirate books, and its inclusion intrigued me enough to visit the publishers website to learn more. For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Box Office Archaeology and I learned a lot I didnt know. Im not a stranger to the authors on the chapter about pirates, Charles R. Ewen and Russell K. Skowronek, for they edited X Marks the Spot. A Pirates Life for Me! looks at the stereotypes that pop culture has instilled in us, defines what a pirate is, introduces the Golden Age of Piracy, then examines the archaeological investigations into the shipwrecks of the Whydah and Queen Annes Revenge, as well as the exploration of Port Royal.\n\nThis book is one of those rare examples where archaeologists present their findings on a level that most people can readily understand, and in a way that makes the subject interesting. Anyone who wants to know more about reality versus Hollywoods interpretation of our cultural past will find this book a compelling, eye-opening revelation.\n\nThe Delmarva Coast comprises the shoreline of three states: Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Since 1632 many ships have been lost, and this book examines the stories behind these losses. Shomette has scoured historical records to piece together each vessels tale, and presents the information, where possible, from the perspective of those who played a part in the events. The chapters abound with stories about shipwrecks, pirates, wreckers, blockaders, and privateers, as well as the heroic efforts of the U.S. Life Saving Service, men who risked their lives to save others. There are also several chapters on the U-boats that patrolled off this coastal region during World War II. The final chapters examine some of the legal, ethical, and cultural problems resulting from the enormous extant shipwreck population .\n\nInterspersed throughout these accounts are first-person excerpts of what happened. For example, in January 1650, the master of the Virginia Merchant marooned his passengers. Henry Norwood, a barrister, wrote:\n\nIn this amazement and confusion of mind no words can express did our miserable distressd party condole with each other our being so cruelly abandond and left to the despairs of human help, or indeed seeing more the face of man. We entered into a sad consultation what course to take; and having, in the first place, by united prayers, implored the protection of Almighty God, and recommended our miserable state to the same providence which, in so many instances of mercy, had been propitious to us at sea We beheld each other as miserable wretches sentencd to a lingering death, no man knowing what to propose for prolonging life any longer than he was able to fast. (page 12)\n\nThese types of quotes are treasures within this detailed account of shipwrecks and maritime disasters. One of the most poignant stories is that of the Faithful Steward, a vessel carrying emigrants from Ireland.\n\nAn appendix provides a chronological listing of ships lost on this stretch of coast. Even in a small print size, this index covers nearly twenty-two pages. Extensive chapter notes follow, as does a selected resource list, where readers may find additional information, and a detailed index.\n\nShipwrecks, Sea Raiders, and Maritime Disasters is well written and interesting. With the steep price, this remains more a scholarly work that provides invaluable research information in one volume, rather than a book for bedtime reading.\n\nPart of Ospreys Warrior series, Pirate of the Far East introduces readers to Asian pirates, with particular emphasis on the wokou or wako. This volume describes these sea raiders, their daily life, the elements of their raids, and how their victims attempted to defend themselves. Three specific examples of the wako in battle are also presented. Information about museum exhibits featuring piracy, other resources to consult, and an index round out this book. A significant number of maps, paintings, photographs, and scrolls illustrate Pirate of the Far East.\n\nThis is a concise, easy-to-read introduction to a subject often ignored in pirate history, even though Asian pirates predate the more infamous Caribbean rogues by centuries. Both the author and illustrator show how those of the Far East differed from later western pirates through example and description. For those interested in a region where piracy still intrudes into the safe navigation of the worlds waterways or those who wish to broaden their knowledge of history, I heartily recommend this book.\n\nIts said that pirates laughed in the face of death. They understood their lives tended to be short and merry. But what about after they died? Some, apparently, didnt find restful repose. They continue to haunt the places where they perpetrated their crimes, and the islands and coast of New England seem to be particular favorites for these eerie specters. Sometimes, though, its not the ghosts that appear, but rather apparitions of sailing ships lost at sea. This collection of stories introduces readers to legendary hauntings, such as the Screeching Lady of Marblehead, Don Pedro and Ocean Born Mary, the ghostly crew of the Charles Haskell, and Samuel Bellamy and Maria Hallett.\n\nOnly a few of these tales will be known to most readers, which make them fresh and all the more eerie. Black-and-white photographs show where the sightings take place, and the fact that the author visited each one adds a touch of realism that makes you think twice about going yourself. Pirate Ghosts & Phantom Ships is a perfect book for reading and sharing on a dark and stormy night where a flash of light sends shivers up your spine or a loud clap makes you jump. Do you dare?\n\nThree times William Dampier sailed around the world, quite an accomplishment in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. On his first voyage (1679), he did so as a buccaneer and privateer, but it was the journal he kept that earned him his fame. Within its pages he recorded fascinating details about the flora, fauna, lands, and peoples he encountered, as well as his nautical and pirating adventures. He downplays the latter, for he admits to not taking any pleasure in relating them, doing so only to acquaint the reader with how he came to have the opportunities to acquaint himself with the former. He eventually returned to England and turned his journal into a book that was published in 1697.\n\nThis edition of Dampiers work includes an introduction by Kris Lane and a list of books for those who wish to read more about Dampier, his times, the writings of fellow buccaneers, and the writings of other authors whom he influenced. Since his initial audience was English, he used such names as are familiar to our English seamen, and those of our colonies abroad . 1500 Books retains the original punctuation, abbreviations, and language Dampier used, but used modern spellings and capitalization, as well as large print, to make the book far more readable than Dover Publications 1968 reprint entitled Memoirs of a Buccaneer. It, however, lacks the chapter summaries, maps, charts, and index. Another plus for the 1500 Books edition is that this publisher used the sixth edition of Dampiers original work, first published in 1717, whereas Dovers comes from a 1927 reprint.\n\nIn spite of having appeared in print more than three centuries ago, A New Voyage Round the World remains as captivating and compelling a travelogue as it did when it first appeared in print. Opening the pages takes the reader back in time to an exotic world few people of Dampiers time knew of, providing us with a fresh look at has become commonplace.\n\nIn recounting the maritime history of Malta, this book examines economic, military, political, and social facets to provide a comprehensive understanding for the reader. The islands strategic location means the country is often beset by invaders, be they pirates or soldiers. The 8,000 years begin with the Phoenicians who settled there through the 250 years that the Order of Saint John (commonly referred to as the Knights of Malta), who were headquartered on Malta, and beyond. The intended audience comprises anyone interested in Maltas history from the general reader to scholars and historians. This volumes primary focus is the people and islands, rather than the invaders, and the author examines archaeological and primary documents, as well as secondary and archival materials, to piece together this nations maritime history and whether it was as strategically important as history has lead us to believe.\n\nThe book is divided into seven chronological chapters, with particular emphasis on the period involving the Order of Saint John. The sixth chapter focuses on the islands population from 1530 through 1798 and the last chapter concerns the authors conclusions based on her research. Interspersed throughout are tables, maps, and charts. An afterword discusses Maltas history since the turn of the 19th century. This is followed by four appendices that look at an underwater survey in which Atauz participated, the ships of the Order, and its major naval activities and forces. The book concludes with extensive notes, a bibliography, and an index.\n\nWhile there isnt a particular chapter devoted to pirates, they are discussed throughout, and the reader should remember that at times members of the Order of Saint John can be so classified. The Maltese islands distance from major Mediterranean trade routes made it an ideal location for a pirate haven. Among the rogues discussed are Margarito of Brindisi, Giacomo de Pellegrino of Messina, and Ingarao and Antoni Desguanesch. Another fascinating aspect to the maritime history is the spread of bubonic plague during the 14th century and how Malta dealt with this crisis. This is an enlightening and interesting book to read and, when done, the reader has a far better understanding of the Maltese islands and their maritime history.\n\nRemember back in high school when you had to read excerpts of American literature? They ranged from colonial offerings to those of the 19th or early 20th centuries. Most likely the only sea story in this collection was Herman Melvilles Moby Dick, yet many other maritime accounts exist. Hester Blum examines sailors accounts of their voyages and experiences, particularly during the first half of the 19th century. Divided into two parts, the book explores The Sea Narrative and Sailors Literary Culture and Maritime Epistemology and Crisis. Part one, which concentrates on history, contrasts early narratives of Barbary captives with those of later seamen, and discusses naval memoirs and the literary marketplace of the period. The second half of the book, which concentrates on the theoretical, explains the Sea Eye, writings on the Galapagos Islands and how maritime fiction evolved, and Death and Burial at Sea. She intersperses samplings from first-person narratives. The authors discussed are both well known and unknown: James Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, Charles Darwin, William Dampier, Richard Henry Dana, Charles Barnard, Ned Buntline, Owen Chase, and John R. Jewitt.\n\nThis book gives voice to a body of works often forgotten or unknown, and in so doing, Blum introduces us to what it was like to have been a sailor from his perspective. She also explores his philosophical side, for being at sea provided him with periods of inner reflection. One particular discussion that interested me involved the to use or not use nautical language argument  a consideration maritime writers continue to face today. Also important in this study is that Blum concentrates on the narratives of working sailors (the common man), rather than ships officers. The inclusion of passages from this body of works enriches the readers experience. As she traces the evolution of sea narratives, Blum also introduces the reader to such changes in sailors lives as literacy and welfare. The View from the Masthead is a fascinating examination of a body of literature too long ignored. Who knows, maybe more of those students in American Lit classes would be captivated by the early literature if teachers incorporated tales of the sea into their studies.\n\nAlthough some history books lead readers to assume that piracy ended by the twentieth century, it never really disappeared. Other topics merely took precedence because it wasnt as major a problem as it had been in the past. In the last several decades, however, there has been an increase in pirate attacks. After September eleventh, fears that pirates and terrorists might combine forces have brought maritime piracy to a higher level of focus. This collection of eleven essays explores these topics from a variety of perspectives.\n\nThe first three essays discuss where the piratical threat is high and why. While political unrest is key, it remains only one factor that has led to the upsurge in attacks.\n\nSomalia: Pirates New Paradise by Peter Lehr and Hendrick Lehmann\n\nSea Piracy in South Asia by Vijay Sakhuia\n\nPiracy in Maritime Asia: Current Trends by Graham Gerard Ong-Webb\n\nThe next series expounds on how pirates take advantage of the opportunities that permit them to successfully  for the most part  conduct their raids. Several authors also compare and contrast those groups that feature aspects of both piracy and terrorism.\n\nCompound Piracy at Sea in the Early Twenty-First Century: A Tactical to Operational-Level Perspective on Contemporary Multiphase Piratical Methodology by Rupert Herbert Burns\n\nThe Abu Sayyaf Group: Threat of Maritime Piracy and Terrorism by Rommel C. Banlaoi\n\nThe Emerging Nexus between Piracy and Maritime Terrorism in Southeast Asia Waters: A Case Study on the Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) by Jeffrey Chen\n\nThe final four essays examine how governments and people have reacted to the increased attacks, and what the near future holds as it relates to piracy and terrorism. An essential component of this examination is whether or not the antipiracy measures that have been adopted have helped or hindered the worldwide efforts to suppress this maritime threat.\n\nPiracy and UNCLOS: Does International Law Help Regional States Combat Piracy? by Martin Murphy\n\nThe International Politics of Combating Piracy in Southeast Asia by Chris Rahman\n\nPirates, Renegades, and Fishermen: The Politics of Sustainable Piracy in the Strait of Malacca by J. N. Mak\n\nPiracy and Maritime Terrorism: Naval Responses to Existing and Emerging Threats to the Global Seaborne Economy by Robert Snoddon\n\nOutlook: The New Threat of Maritime Terrorism by Sam Bateman\n\nAll the essays are informative and cause the reader think about the problems facing mariners and nations. A few are pedantic, making it difficult for the reader to follow the discussion, but most are easy to understand. The question as to whether terrorism and piracy are the same or different is covered from both perspectives, allowing readers to formulate their own conclusions. Charts, graphs, resources, and an index are included, as are the contributors qualifications for their writing on these particular subjects. One caveat that readers should keep in mind is that some of statistics and facts arent up-to-date. This in no way detracts from the value of the book, especially for those who dont keep abreast of modern-day piracy.\n\nFor me, one of the most thought-provoking statements in all the essays appears in Robert Snoddons Piracy and Maritime Terrorism: Naval Responses to Existing and Emerging Threats to the Global Seaborne Economy. It epitomizes how many people view piracy and explains why this threat remains a danger to anyone who sails the waters of our world. [Maritime terrorism events] that have occurred have been particularly lethal, and the incidents have spurred governments into taking direct action, whereas reported acts of piracy appear to spur governments only to pontificate about who the perpetrators are. In some areas piracy is considered an annoying activity that is ignored in the hope that, sooner or later, it will go away.\n\nBarrier islands stretching from Virginia to Cape Lookout, the Outer Banks have witnessed more than one hundred shipwrecks and is known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. This collection of stories recounts twenty-four of those disasters between 1822 and 1912. It also provides a glimpse at the heroic deeds of those who helped rescue the victims. The final chapter discusses the wrecking of and search for the Queen Annes Revenge, Blackbeards flag ship. Also included are a map depicting the locations of the shipwrecks, a glossary of nautical terms, and a list of additional resources. Paul G. Hoffman did the black-and-white illustrations that accompany the tales.\n\nRather than just a recitation of facts, these narratives unfold like short stories and mix dialogue with description. This makes the events more vivid and harrowing, and, for the most part, the author achieves his goal. A few stories, though, seem unfinished or lacking in suspense. They are presented in chronological order, which means the more gripping accounts are scattered throughout. Readers will need to read more than the first tale before being transported to the deck of a ship and becoming an eyewitness to the events that unfold.\n\nWritten by an associate professor of history, this book is part of a series that examines historic events between 1500 and 1900. This particular volume concentrates on the search for a quicker passage to Asia and its exotic offerings, as well as the new territories those sea adventurers discovered in the process. It readily acknowledges that Europeans werent the first to venture far from their shores, or even to make astonishing discoveries, but they were the first to capitalize on them on a grand scale, and their achievements forever changed the world and impacted history. Prior to the voyages of the Portuguese and Spanish explorers, the various world cultures were isolated from each other. These discoverers, who ventured farther afield into new arenas, were the initiators of global commerce, which remains an important aspect of our lives today.\n\nThe book is divided into sections, the first being a timeline of noteworthy events from 1249 through 1791. Chapter one provides an overview, while the next four chapters examine Portugal and the Search for a Sea Route to Asia, Spain and the Discovery of a New World, Circumnavigation and the Search for a Northern Passage to China, and Exploration of the Great South Sea. While William Dampier is included in the narrative, he doesnt appear in the Biographies: Personalities of the Age of Discovery section. Prior to the glossary, annotated bibliography, and index, Love shares a number of primary documents related to this period of history. These include a poem, letters, and excerpts from original manuscripts (including Sir Francis Drakes The World Encompassed, Dampiers A New Voyage Round the World, and Woodes Rogers journal).\n\nContrary to the more usual Eurocentric presentations on the Age of Discovery, Maritime Exploration provides a balanced approach while setting the subject within the historical context in which the events occurred. The book is geared toward students in high school and the early years of college, but is equally valuable to the general reader who wishes to learn about the men and voyages whose initial purpose was to find gateways to increase commerce, but eventually devolved into the quest for land, riches, and world domination. While an interesting presentation, enriched by the inclusion of primary resources, this isnt an absorbing history. For those looking for a well-rounded examination of and having an interest in the Age of Discovery, this is an informative introduction.\n\nIn 1831 Charles Gibbs was hanged at Ellis Island for piracy. Between the time of his trial and execution, he allowed tidbits of information about himself to leak out. At one point he confessed that his real name was James D. Jeffers. Dead Men Tell No Tales attempts to separate the fact from the myth in an effort to learn about the real man behind the bloodthirsty legends that Charles Gibbs became. While documentary evidence concerning the trial and the final days of his life exists, it is far more difficult to step further back in time to determine the facts about his earlier life. Some question remains as to whether Jeffers was his real name. Even the information he supplied was laced with contradictions and inconsistencies. As the author writes in the epilogue, James Jeffers claimed that his goal was not to cover his crimes, but to shield his identity. If so, he succeeded. Today the Jeffers name is little known in pirate history while Charles Gibbs still catches enthusiasts imagination.\n\nSifting through historical documents to unravel facts from legends is tedious work, but sometimes the gems discovered make the diligence worthwhile. While the authors journey leaves more questions than answers, and at times the account seems to get sidetracked, Dead Men Tell No Tales contains a wealth of information on Caribbean piracy in the nineteenth century. Few books explore this period of piratical history, and fewer still dare to compare the villains of this era with their counterparts a century earlier. Joseph Gibbs does both and does it well. The inclusion of footnotes, sources consulted, and a detailed index provide ready access to the history and people mentioned in the book. Readers seeking to learn more about the notorious pirate may be disappointed, but those yearning to become better acquainted with the Caribbean marauders of the 1800s will find their appetites sated.\n\nStephen Fox opens the story in July 1862 as Semmes awaits a ship that will take him to England, for that is where vessel 290 is being built. Although not a die-hard southerner  he lived in the border state of Maryland  Semmes eventually moved his family to Alabama. During one of the long separations from his wife, Anne  who came from an upstanding Northern family  he wrote, But whatever may betide them [their sons] or me, my dear wife, you must keep ever present to your mind, that we are engaged in a holy cause, fighting for all that is dear to man. When strangers met the captain, they were disappointed, for he never measured up to their images of an infamous pirate or dedicated officer.\n\nBuilt in the Laird shipyard, the 290 was designed to remain at sea for long periods and carried sufficient armament for her to successfully attack Union merchantmen. She was powered by both sail and steam. When Semmes first saw her, he compared her to the lightness and grace of a swan. He named her CSS Alabama and convinced some of the British sailors to join him and his officers in their raids in exchange for shares of the plunder. In the first two months of their cruise, they burned twenty vessels and released three others because too many passengers were aboard or their holds carried cargo of neutral nations. To the North, the cruiser couldnt be caught and was ghostlike, for she seemed to strike everywhere. His success impacted northern morale and disrupted Union commerce so much that many ship owners sold their vessels to foreign entities.\n\nSemmes didnt immediately resign his commission in the American navy, but he eventually embraced the war. Although principally a story of the man and his vessel, this book also tells the tale of American efforts (both for and against the Union) in Britain and how devastating his raids were on the Union. Fox also shows the differences in which Northerners and Southerners viewed the commerce raiders actions and how Semmes success led to problems aboard his vessel. These would eventually cause her downfall at the hands of the USS Kearsage, but not before the Alabama had captured sixty-five vessels and traveled 75,000 miles all in the space of twenty-two months.\n\nWolf of the Deep is a fascinating examination of a man maligned in Union newspapers and heralded in Confederate ones. Quotes from primary and contemporary sources compel the reader to see the people and events from various viewpoints, rather than providing a narrow glimpse that is one-sided and prejudicial. Fox demonstrates that Semmes understood that to defeat the enemy, the Confederacy needed to strike where the Union was most vulnerable  its commercial shipping. The author dares to show how Semmes adapted to the changing times by depicting him as a person with foibles, strengths, weaknesses, and quirks, rather than as either a hero or a villain. This book is a must read for fans of Civil War history and maritime history as steam began to replace sail.\n\nDivided into four parts, The Pirate Queen begins with Elizabeths ascent to the English throne on the death of Bloody Mary. She soon learns that her half-sister has bankrupted the royal treasury and with the kingdom in peril from outsiders  in particular the Catholic Philip, King of Spain  Elizabeth sets in motion policies to defend her country and people and to replenish her coffers. This book is primarily about the relationship between the queen and her Sea Dogs, and how she successfully fuse[d] the colossal and diverging egos of her gentlemen and merchant adventurers while enforcing her personal will for the protection and security of England. Within its pages the reader meets Richard Hawkins, Martin Frobisher, Francis Drake, and Walter Raleigh, among others. There are two appendices  Doctor John Dees essay on The Petty Navy Royal and a typical report on the Flotilla of New Spain  a glossary, bibliographical essay and suggested readings, and a substantial index.\n\nThose readers seeking a biography of the Virgin Queen should look elsewhere, for there are only brief mentions of her life in this book. Those desiring to learn more about the Sea Dogs and their rise to power need look no further, for this is a comprehensive introduction to them and their adventures. It is also a rare, yet readable, look at the chess moves, failures, and successes that laid the foundation for England to become an empire and eventually rule the seas. Ronalds source material for the book includes a myriad of primary and secondary resources, as well as thousands of letters that Elizabeth and her pirates exchanged.\n\nConcentrating on pirates from the Golden Age, this book explores the myths and realities of piracy using the trilogy of Pirates of the Caribbean movies to introduce the various topics the author explores. Section I comprises forty-one points of fact and fiction and highlights the articles of agreement crafted by John Phillips men. Section II covers the finer points of being a pirate and places where pirates can go to have fun on land and at sea. At the end of this section is a quiz to test your pirate I. Q. The final section, also called the appendix, features various ports of call in print, the media, and online.\n\nThe layout is easy on the eyes. The book is a fast read. Color photographs and black-and-white illustrations delight the eye and exemplify what the text explains. The I. Q. test is well conceived and tests a vast array of knowledge, although a few subjects arent really covered in the text. Sometimes the wording of questions is a bit hazy, but anyone who reads before he/she answers the questions can easily earn the rank of captain or quartermaster. The author is to be commended for including great explanations of the right answers, rather than just listing whether theyre true or false.\n\nWhen you open a treasure chest, you never know whats inside. You hope to find riches beyond your imagination, but sometimes the booty is a hodgepodge. This is the case with Caribbean Pirates. For me, it was a breath of fresh air because its unlike the usual historical pirate books I read. On the other hand, Wikipedia is not a reliable source for quoting information from, and I came across some factual errors that someone unfamiliar with pirates wont realize are falsehoods.\n\nAlthough flogging was incorporated into pirate articles, this punishment was not routine among pirates because many suffered the lash when legitimate sailors.\n\nThe only crew member not required to sign the articles, whether forced or not, was the surgeon. All others, including forced artisans, either signed or faced whatever fate the pirates decreed for those who refused to join them.\n\nThe man who buried treasure on Gardners island was William Kidd, not Thomas Kidd.\n\nI was also puzzled by the statement, Port Royal had a very unsavory reputation prior to the establishment of English rule. While the government in England spent more time ignoring the islands, they did send men to rule there during the time that it developed its unsavory reputation.\n\nIf pirates waited until a ship was level to fire their guns, their prey would be long gone. The constant movement of the waves prevents the ship from being level, and ropes were used to keep the guns from rolling around the deck.\n\nIf there wasnt a surgeon on board, it was the carpenter who performed amputations, not the cook.\n\nIn spite of these mistakes, Caribbean Pirates does a superb job in pointing out where Hollywood and reality differ. I often get asked by those who see one of the POTC movies whether something really happened. This book is a ready reference for answering those questions. It also contains some priceless lines, such as in the definition of a cooper:\n\nHe made casks and maintained them at sea to insure their integrity, since they were the principal means to store water, rum, food, and gunpowder. (Think Tupperware without its sealing advantages.)\n\nThe last sentence vividly creates an image that anyone today can readily understand. Something not covered in most compendia on pirates is cruises you and/or your family can take to get just a wee taste of life at sea. While the list of festivals, books, and films is by no means inclusive, I was surprised to see the omission of one movie classic, Captain Blood, starring Errol Flynn. The annotated list of websites is fairly extensive, and even includes Thistles & Pirates, for which I thank the author.\n\nCaribbean Pirates is not for everyone. Those looking for histories should seek other resources. Those who are seriously considering taking on a pirate persona or are intrigued with the reality versus the myth in piratical movies will find a treasure chest full of information that will prove valuable for years to come.\n\nThe wealth Spain discovered in the New World brought pirates to the Caribbean. The buccaneers didnt confine their attacks to the treasure galleons. They also raided land bases. This threat impacted how the Spanish protected their towns and citizens. The Spanish Main examines the fortresses, some of which can be visited today, and how they evolved over the centuries.\n\nAdministrative organization covers the viceroys, captains-general, and kings engineers. Castles in America concentrates on the establishment of the various fortresses and town planning. Corsairs, pirates and convoys examines the treasure fleet convoy system, defense squadrons, the French Huguenots, and English pirates. Subsequent chapters look at the fortification plan of 1588, the Spanish Main in the 17th century, defense of the territory in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the garrisons that manned the defenses. Also included are a chronology, a brief look at the forts today, a glossary, a bibliography, and an index. Diagrams, maps, and pictures accompany the text throughout.\n\nThis book isnt for those searching for information on life in colonial Spain, but rather a concise examination of Spains defenses  design, technology, and history  in the New World. While pirates are not the primary focus, their activities greatly impacted how she protected her towns, people, and treasure, and they are examined in this context. The Spanish Main presents Latin American history from a different perspective than that usually found in books focusing on pirates. The colorful diagrams provide excellent glimpses into places lost or changed over time. This is a worthy read for those interested in the other side.\n\nWhen you first pick up this book, you might ask yourself why the government would publish a how-to book for pirates? After all, pirates detest government  it goes against most of what they believe. It isnt long before the scurvy dogs who penned this book explain that while [t]he radish-eatin land Government dont dare publish no manual for us, no, but the Pirate Government got no such qualms. Of course, youre off to a bad start in learning how to be a pirate if buy this book  true pirates only acquire treasure through stealing.*\n\nSlightly larger than a pocket guidebook, this manual is divided into eight chapters of information every pirate-in-training needs to learn. Chapter 1 helps you locate pirates, including ways to avoid the land and where to find the best hot spots in Tortuga, Hispaniola, and other Caribbean islands. Chapter 2 addresses appropriate attire from heads to pegs, as well as accessories and what not to wear. Chapter 3 provides instruction in how to talk like a pirate, while the next one discusses pirate ships, covering such information as good and bad names, parts of the vessel, and dangers that lurk in the oceans depths. Chapters 5 and 6 recount the guidelines pirates should abide by and how to fight in true piratical style. The final two chapters explain how pirates amuse themselves and how they locate buried treasure. There are also four appendices  lyrics to popular pirate chanteys, a nontraditional chantey attributed to Pobeard, a favorite pirate recipe, and an eye patch. The book is indexed.\n\nIf youve not guessed by now, this manual is a tongue-in-cheek look at the world of pirates. Many sections will have you smiling or laughing. A few might make you groan. Theres a fair amount of truth interwoven into the text, but the information about tricorne and bicorne hats is backward. (Golden age pirates would have worn the former, while Napoleon and Admiral Nelson sported the latter.) There are a few sections where its wise to stay alert, especially if the text starts to bore you, for thats when you may discover a hidden message. My two favorite sections are Speak in the Manner of a Pirate, which includes A Very Complex and Intimidating Statistical Equation, and Appendix A, which has a new version of 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall. (If you thought the old one was mind-numbing, wait until you sing this one!) Even the books cover contains important information for readers. Great for learning a bit more about true pirattitude  as long as you dont take the advice too seriously.\n\nThis book is not your ordinary exploration of piracy. Rather it attempts to put pirates into the context of their time period so we understand how people of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw them. Were they political or sexual radicals? Did they disrupt trade and culture as much as history says? Or were they mere players in a changing world where religion and politics were often inseparable? The ten scholarly essays also explore how one countrys privateers were another countrys pirates. These questions are answered by examining primary literary documents and books. Not only is the cultural phenomenon explored, but so are the pirates in different regions, including Ireland, the Americas, the Barbary States, Spain, and England. The essays also discuss how national politics and particular interest groups shaped how people saw pirates.\n\nDivided into three sections, this collection first defines piracy then examines various perspectives with particular emphasis on politics and cultural works, and how pirates impacted society after they died.\n\n1. Hostis Humani Generis  The Pirate as Outlaw in the Early Modern Law of the Sea. Christopher Harding, a law professor at the University of Wales, examines the legal perception of piracy between 1550 and 1650. He compares how we define piracy today with how it was defined in the past, before pirates were seen as criminals against all mankind.\n\n2. The Problem of Piracy in Ireland, 1570-1630. John C. Appleby, who lectures in history at Liverpool Hope University College, discusses the upsurge in piracy in Ireland, including social and economic aspects, and how England responded to the problem.\n\n3. Piracy and Captivity in the Early Modern Mediterranean: The Perspective from Barbary. Nabil Matar, an English professor and head of the Humanities and Communication Department at Florida Institute of Technology, provides a unique look at Barbary piracy  not from the perspective of Christian victims, but through the eyes of Muslim victims. He explains who the Muslim captives were and how their accounts have survived.\n\n4. Crusading Piracy? The Curious Case of the Spanish in the Channel, 1590-95. Matthew Dimmock, a Lecturer in English at the University of Sussex, takes a little-known narrative and looks at methods of plundering as well as issues dealing with holy war and religious and national identities. In doing so he offers insights into politics, mercantilism, theology, and national concerns in England, Spain, and the Ottoman Empire.\n\n5. Acting Pirates: Converting A Christian Turned Turk. A lecturer at the University of Reading, March Hutchings specializes in early modern theatre and drama in performance. His essay discusses the connection between piracy and religion by looking at a play about John Ward, a Christian who turned Turk and became a successful Barbary corsair. His focus is on the staging of the play and how acting and conversion helps us understand the play.\n\n6. We are not pirates: Piracy and Navigation in The Lusiads. Bernhard Klein, a Reader in Literature at the University of Essex, sheds light on the charges and denials of piracy in an epic poem from Portugal about Vasco da Gama as he explored the African and Indian coasts.\n\n7. Virolet and Martia the Pirates Daughter: Gender and Genre in Fletcher and Massingers The Double Marriage. Lucy Munro, a Lecturer in English at Keele University, on the other hand, looks at the links between gender and piracy in a play that incorporates a female pirate and involves her in issues dealing with politics and tyranny.\n\n8. Sir Francis Drakes Ghost: Piracy, Cultural Memory, and Spectral Nationhood. Mark Netzloff, Associate Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, explores the various images of Drake that existed during his lifetime and how these conflicting images were used for competing political ends.\n\n9. Scaffold Performances: The Politics of Pirate Execution. Claire Jowitt is an English professor at Nottingham Trent University, who explores the behavior of and words spoken by pirates prior to their executions as they pertain to politics, either supporting or undermining the government.\n\n10. Of Pirates, Slaves, and Diplomats: Anglo-American Writing about the Maghrib in the Age of Empire. An English Professor at the University of York, Gerald MacLean goes beyond the time parameters of this book to discuss how American literature, written soon after independence, appropriated Elizabethan images of piracy and attitudes toward Barbary Corsairs to influence Americas foreign policy with Algiers.\n\nThere is much to learn here, although the scholarliness of the essays at time makes it difficult to comprehend what the authors are saying. Many of the documents examined and the accounts related arent found in other works. It is an excellent examination into how the world viewed piracy from a variety of perspectives from 1550 to 1650. The weakest chapter, as regards inclusion within this tome, is the last because it strays outside the historical framework of the book. Readers with either a particular interest in this time period or literature will find much to satisfy them, as long as they understand this is a scholarly work. The notes and selected bibliography allow readers to further explore varying aspects of piracy and early literature.\n\nA solicitor and author, Douglas Stewart explores the world of maritime piracy and organized crime in this non-fiction book that begins:\n\nEven as you read this book, mariners somewhere are being attacked by armed pirates, their faces masked and the weapons deadly. Some may be murdered, tortured, seized as a hostage or simply dumped overboard to sink or swim. Attacks have become increasingly violent, the profits of crime ever greater. International law enforcement has yet to show sufficient concerted will to beat organized crime at sea.\n\nThe idea for this book came about as he was researching a novel. It is one of the few books on maritime crime that explores piracy, terrorism, and organized crime syndicates in a single volume.\n\nThe book is divided into ten chapters:\n\nOrganised Crime, Corruption and Murder: Pirates at Work examines the attack on the mv Baltimar Zephyr, Chinese triads, and the mysterious world of Mr. Wong.\n\nMass Murder? The Loss of Car Ferry mv Estonia explores what is known and not known about the sinking of this boat with a high loss of life.\n\nSwimming with Sharks: The Tragedy of the Lisa Marie is about a maritime fraud case involving a cargo of cigarettes.\n\nPiracy in Port: A Tale of Two Guns looks at several instances of piracy, including the raid that resulted in the death of Peter Blake, and whether guns should be carried on ships and boats as a defense against attacks.\n\nShipping Fraud of the Century? The Salem Scam Unravelled discusses a crime arranged by Greek shippers in an attempt to profit from a cargo of oil.\n\nDeath Doesnt Matter: The mv Lucona details how an Austrian arranged for a vessel and her cargo to be blown up at sea without regard to the crew aboard.\n\nThe Chinese Enigma examines two pirate attacks on cargo vessels and Chinas role in abetting and curbing maritime piracy.\n\nPeople-Smuggling and the Shame of Rape Island discusses the trafficking of humans, piratical attacks on boat people, and the wanton rape of innocent women enslaved for the pirates pleasure.\n\nBodies in the Fridge: The Phantom Journeys of Erria Inge explores the hijacking of a cargo vessel and the mystery of the bodies found in her hold once she finally resurfaced.\n\nTerrorism at Sea: When and Not If attempts to assess the danger, evaluate the safety of maritime trade and travel since September 11th, and discusses reforms to curb terrorism.\n\nTo gather background and information about this topic, Stewart spoke at length with Eric Ellen (retired Chief Constable of the Port of London Police Authority and the founder the International Maritime Bureau), Shiao Lin (a former Taiwanese Police Inspector and a key investigator for the IMB), and Captain Pottengal Mukundan (current Director of the IMB).\n\nThe weakest part of the book is the inclusion of mv Estonia because there is no solid evidence to categorize the sinking of the car ferry as a criminal act. I discussed this with the author and he says, I remain of the view that this ship was sunk for commercial or political reasons by a serious conspiracy and was therefore mass murder at sea. It remains an interesting case and some decisions that were made certainly seem to indicate that somebody didnt want the facts to become known, but because it appears as the second chapter, it slowed the pace and made me wonder constantly whether I should keep reading. I did, and subsequent chapters proved to be on point and quite interesting.\n\nSince the author is British, there are occasions when a word or the spelling of a word may seem strange to Americans, but most readers will have no problem understanding the text. There are instances, however, where the text would have benefited from a copyeditors proofing. Acronyms are not spelled out the first time they are used, which makes it difficult for the uninitiated to know what they mean.\n\nIn spite of these drawbacks, The Brutal Seas is an intriguing glimpse into piracy, organized crime, and terrorism in the maritime world. It also examines how the criminals are pursued and punished, when possible. Perhaps best of all, though, it demonstrates the difficulties law enforcement encounters when pursuing and prosecuting these people.\n\nSubtitled The Buccaneers Guide to Tales, Trails, and Treasure in North America, this book is a compendium of pirate biographies, films and books on piracy, hosting a buccaneer bash, and ports of call. The author does warn that While eery attempt has been made t ensure accurate information dealin wi pirates means yer bloody likely t get some exaggerated tales, due t thar legendary consumption o rum. She also provides readers with a glossary of contractions she uses throughout the text, for it has a definite piratical flavoring to it.\n\nAfter a brief introduction to piracy, she introduces readers to sixteen of the more infamous rogues. Among these are Henry Avery, Samuel Bellamy, Cheng I Sao, Jean Laffite, Grace OMalley, and Thomas Tew. The usual felons of the Golden Age are also included. The Fever Spreads includes lists of films and books, as well as the actors who have played famous swashbucklers, such as Captain Blood and Captain Jack Sparrow. There are also articles on pirates in cyberspace* and shipwrecks and treasure. Often forgotten, but equally important, are those who entertain us  re-enactors, tour guides, DJs, ship modelers, singers, historians  and an interview with Ol Chumbucket and Capn Slappy who made September 19th famous.\n\nBuccaneer Bash explains how to throw the best pirate party. One begins with the outfit and the language. Next come recipes for grog, hard tack, salmagundi, and Mother Bluebeards famous scurvy meat pie. For entertainment Sharp provides the words to several sea shanties and some dreadful pirate jokes. The final section of the book provides regional information for American and Canadian piratical attractions, events, organizations, and treasure quests. Each grouping begins with real pirates of the region. Black-and-white photographs abound and a list of resources and an index complete the book.\n\nOnce you get the hang of pirate speak, this is an entertaining book. What sets this book apart from others is the ingredients for a swashbuckling party and where to go for pirate fun. There are a few errors  such as Stede Bonnets death date (December, not 10 November 1718), William Kidd never confessed to any wrongdoing, a fair portion of Laffites biography, and Mary Read wed a soldier rather than a sailor  one must remember that Pirate Fever! is written in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek way to amuse and fascinate the reader. Nor is it a history book. Rather it is a fast-paced and rousing introduction to the Golden Age of Piracy with information for anyone who wants to become a pirate or wants to learn where other pirates can be found.\n\nLegendary and auspicious, the sack of Panama was a pivotal moment in history. Over 2,000 privateers and buccaneers under the leadership of Henry Morgan sailed aboard thirty-eight ships. These daring men made the arduous trek across the Isthmus of Panama to attack one of Spains colonial cities. In spite of hunger and disease they defied the odds, but the success of the venture did not begin in 1671. Five years of struggle between Spain and England preceded this daring raid, and had Morgan not succeeded in the endeavor, the future of the Caribbean might well have evolved differently.\n\nWhat makes Earles account unique is that he examines the raid from two perspectives the privateers who defended Jamaica and the Spanish victims  to give readers a well-rounded examination of the historical events that transpired and the people responsible for them. He vividly recounts what happened before the sack of Panama to ground the reader in the time, the place, and the political situation and provide him/her with a better understanding of what happened. The authors intent is to not only retell a story often told, but also provide a new perspective to it, and he succeeds admirably in this attempt.\n\nEver want to jazz up your lawn at Halloween with a spooky pirate ship, but didnt know how? Jim Litchko has solved your problems. Using PVC pipes and fittings, some tools, and glue, he shows you step-by-step how to build a collapsible pirate ship measuring 10 feet high by 12 feet long by 3 feet wide, for $200 to $300 with just 24 hours of labor.\n\nThe book is spiral-bound, so it lays flat for easy reference while working. The contents are arranged in a logical order, beginning with tools, building components, building techniques, and ships plans, and ending with assemblage instructions and how to accessorize your pirate ship. There are warnings and cautions, as well as recommendations throughout. What makes the design worthwhile is that you can reuse the ship over and over again whenever you want.\n\nSince the instructions seem a bit daunting at times, this project is geared more toward people who like to build things from scratch, rather than rookies with no experience. I suspect those with less experience will actually take longer to construct the ship. Although there is some humor, for the most part the writing style is dry and technical. Some errant word choices and misspellings point to the need for a copyeditor. The combination of blueprints, diagrams, and illustrations enhance the written directions, making them easier to follow and understand. There is a complete list of needed materials (459 parts and 500 feet of covering), which allows you to see the full scope of the project from the start. The author frequently reminds the reader that this ship is for display purposes only. Its neither a toy nor something children can climb. The inclusion of websites on plastic pipes and knot-tying are helpful. The price is a bit steep, but for those with a hankering to build a pirate ship or who like to create displays different from the rest of the neighborhoods, Create Your Own Pirate Ship may be just the thing!\n\nBooks abound on buccaneers and pirates of the Golden Age, but what about those of other time periods? Seafarers, Merchants and Pirates in the Middle Ages explores the maritime world several centuries earlier, particularly from the 10th through the early 15th century. While the British Isles are included to some extent, especially in the chapter on Vikings, primary emphasis is on northern Europe. One strength of this scholarly work is that it explores this time period in a more rounded fashion than most books because it looks at how sailors, merchants, cities and towns, and pirates interacted and how they impacted history. Through primary documents, illustrations, and information from archaeological finds, Dr. Meier presents a logical and easily understood explanation of the medieval seafaring world.\n\nDivided into eleven chapters, this book explores early navigation and how advances in navigation during this time allowed people to venture farther from shore. Readers will also learn about shipbuilding and its development. Dr. Meier next explores the various trading ports on the North and Baltic Seas and the rivers of Russia. Two chapters discuss the Viking pillaging expeditions and explorations in the North Atlantic. The history and power of the Hanseatic League is detailed, as are the pirates who plagued the region in the later Middle Ages. Also included are a glossary, reading list, and index.\n\nWhile I would have liked more information on the pirates, this book is a good introduction to the maritime world and developments in it during medieval times. Headings and subheadings provide easy access to whats covered in the chapters. Captioned black-and-white illustrations and maps, interspersed with ones in vivid color, complement the narrative and provide readers with excellent visuals for points of reference. The inclusion of primary documents allows readers to see how people of the time period saw their world. The only drawbacks to the book, and they are minor ones, are misspelled words and a few translated sentences that required me to reread them once or twice until I understood what was written. Some information on ships, sailing, and navigation is the best presented and easiest to understand that Ive encountered in researching maritime history. Those interested in the Middles Ages, particularly those concerned with trade and piracy, will find this a worthy addition to their collections.\n\nUnless a museum has a famous ship or other noteworthy item of historic maritime importance, it often is overlooked in national visitors guides. Most of us arent even aware of this oversight. I discovered it because of a summer trip I needed to plan. A conference takes me to Albany, New York in June 2007 and when Im in new regions of the country, I like to visit maritime museums and explore sailing ships, as well as see places of historical and piratical importance. Neither the AAA Tourbook or the sights-to-see information the conference organizers provided made mention of the Half Moon Visitor Center and New Netherland Museum. Smiths guide did, and since the Half Moon is a replica of Henry Hudsons ship, I felt it should have been mentioned. Another example of what youll find within Maritime Museums of North America that is sadly missing in other guides is the Expedition Whydah in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Any self-respecting pirate knows about this museum, sea lab, and learning center, for this exhibit relates the story of Black Sam Bellamy, the fateful night when his pirate ship sank in a storm, and Barry Cliffords discovery of the wreck of the Whydah.\n\nSo whats in this guidebook? The main portion is divided into two sections: United States museums and Canadian museums. These are subdivided by states/provinces and cities. Using the entry of Expedition Whydah as an example, Smith provides the address, phone number, and e-mail address for the museum, and gives information on its location (in this case MacMillan Wharf, Provincetown, MA), the highlights of the museum, and its website URL. What follows is a more-detailed explanation of whats in the museum (as it pertains to the maritime world), including history and special features (such as videos with Walter Cronkite and National Geographic). Some entries (for example, Plimoth Plantation, Plymouth, MA) provide information on activities  educational programs, library collections, visitor centers, and cafeterias. All entries include admission data (whether there is an entry fee or not and days and hours of operation).\n\nAn added bonus to this edition of the guidebook is the inclusion of a CD that contains more than 400 pictures of the 600 plus ships, museums, and lighthouses detailed in the entries. Also of importance are indices, which provide access to the listings alphabetically by name and according to subject classifications: bed and breakfasts and overnight encampments, boat and ship building, gift shops and book stores, halls of fame, libraries, lighthouses, locks and canals, navy yards, collections of newsletters and periodicals, pirate museums, scrimshaw, ship chandlers, ship models, specific ships and boats (and general information on these types of vessels), and whaling. There is also an index to the photographs on the CD*, which is organized by state/province. Robert Smith also gives readers the chance to add a museum or correct an entry.\n\nI found Maritime Museums of North America an invaluable resource for planning my trip this summer. Now, I know what museums are in each state or province and what Ill find there. I suspect that I shall be consulting this resource often, and I highly recommend it for inclusion in any mariners (or pirates) collection. It doesnt matter whether your preferences are sailing ships, iron clads, tugboats, racing yachts, submarines, fishing boats, or any vessel in between from colonial times through the 20th century. This book provides access to them all.\n\nBorn to a Quaker family in Delaware in 1853, Howard Pyle became an accomplished artist whose works continue to inspire and astound. He also wrote and illustrated historical novels and stories. Eventually, he opened his own school of art, and some of his students achieved equal success. Some of his most revealing paintings are of pirates, whom he portrayed with realism and authenticity rarely achieved before. Howard Pyles Book of Pirates, first published in 1921, is still in print, and many children are first introduced to buccaneers when they read this book. Pyle drew many other pictures of historical subjects, medieval knights, and creatures from fantasy and myth.\n\nThis book, which provides a brief introduction to the artist and each group of paintings, gathers some of Pyles most famous and lesser-known works into one book. Jeff Menges is particularly adept at succinctly showing why Pyle was so skilled at drawing what he did. The text makes fascinating reading, but the pictures in this collection will entertain the reader for hours. This worthy addition to any piratical collection will soon become cherished like treasure itself.\n\nFans of pirate art will enjoy these works of art:\n\nNaval commanders, like most leaders, have a natural tendency to control via centralization. Yet many naval engagements, most famously Nelsons at Trafalgar, are won through the commanders willingness to decentralize command and trust the instincts of his subordinates. Decentralization succeeds when the commander thoroughly educates his subordinates before each engagement so they can act instinctively carry out his intentions, rather than await orders that may be impossible to see or hear during the fog of war.\n\nHistory professor Michael Palmer examines the processes and technologies of more than four centuries of naval command, as well as the key leaders and battles of each period. Whether wind or nuclear fuel power a fleet, the universal constraints of warfare remain to be tamed by how the leader chooses to command that fleet. Written fighting instructions lay out the recommended techniques in several possible situations. Yet battles have been lost when subordinates missed, misinterpreted, or misunderstood signals from the flagship; at their worst, situations might call for a signal not conceived of in the fighting instructions.\n\nRapid advances in communications have had several contradictory results in naval command. While officially espousing decentralized control, the U. S. Navy since World War II has used radio and satellites to monitor war progress from headquarters and effectively micro-manage both tactics and operations. U-boat captains during World War I received wireless telegraph messages from central German commanders who coordinated their movements, but such signals were subject to enemy interception. Thus the very technology that could give them superiority over their foes became unreliable or even dangerous at crucial mission times.\n\nThose commanders who were slaves to the classical centralized model utilized the well-ordered line-ahead formation, executed only pre-planned maneuvers, and deviated only upon one of several discrete flag signals communicating the commanders wishes to the fleet. In contrast, decentralizers, such as Horatio Nelson, imparted their tactical wishes to their subordinates and were able to yield control during even a pell-mell mêlée and expect success.\n\nShip captains and pirate captains both have the same goal: using the unique talents of their crews to best advantage to achieve victory at sea. Command decisions are critical whether the prize is booty or an enemy nation.\n\nProfessor Palmers thorough research and extensive footnotes do not get in the way of telling a spellbinding history through the eyes of those who stood on the decks of some of the most famous ships of the past. A dozen battle maps and an extensive index enhance the texts usability.\n\nIn the fall of 1800, Dey Mustafa of Algiers asked Captain William Bainbridge to ferry the Algerine tribute to the sultan of the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople. Bainbridge, as well as Consul General Richard OBrien, vehemently refused the request, but the Dey made it clear that not acceding to his request would be tantamount to declaring war. To further humiliate the fledgling American navy, Alergine naval personnel boarded the USS George Washington on 9 October 1800, took down the American flag, and replaced it with the flag of Algiers. This incident, the capture of American merchantmen sailing the Mediterranean Sea, and the enslavement of their crews initiated a long conflict between the United States and the Barbary States. It also resulted in the establishment of the United States Navy and the Marine Corps.\n\nAccording to Mr. London, The story of Americas struggle against the terror of piracy in the Mediterranean stands as testament to the essential American attributes that have given rise to American exceptionalism: the problem-solving mind-set of the individual overcoming lifes difficulties through brains and talent, faith and strength of purpose, and guts and perseverance. Yet, this story doesnt unfold in a vacuum. At the same time, the United States found itself struggling to maintain its independence and vying with Old World nations to be recognized as a new country with a right to trade freely, while confronting the political problems facing Europe.\n\nWhile 2005 saw the publication of three books on this topic, each sheds light on different aspects of the Barbary Wars. Richard Zacks The Pirate Coast concerns the covert operation William Eaton led against Tripoli and the role American Marines played in that battle. Frank Lamberts Barbary Wars covers the entire period of the Barbary Wars with particular emphasis on Algiers. Joshua London covers these topics, but his primary emphasis is on the naval aspects of the period and the early history of the U.S. Navy. Victory in Tripoli is a concise and understandable retelling of the political battles waged between presidents and Congress over the need for a navy and the cost of having one, the failures and successes of the naval war against the Barbary States, and the naval heroes who emerged to renew honor and pride in this young country. It is an inspiring account of Americas first attempt to end the paying of tribute and to deter terrorism.\n\nThere is an element of romanticism to sailors and life at sea during the Age of Sail. But why did boys and men really go to sea, and what was life for them like both aboard ship and in port, especially for those who grew up and lived near the coastline of American shores? These are the questions Daniel Vickers sets out to answer in this book, concentrating on seafaring life and changes in maritime commerce in Salem, Massachusetts from 1620 through the nineteenth century. When people hear of Salem, they tend to think only of the witchcraft trials that took place there, but this village seaport was involved in various types of shipping throughout its history. Also, it was small enough to allow historians to use local records to trace individual mariners and what they did over long periods of time.\n\nThis scholarly work is not for readers looking for details of colonists who turned to piracy or abetted pirates. Nor does it dwell much on privateering. Rather Young Men and the Sea examines how a coastal village founded by landsmen developed into a vital seaport and how its inhabitants chose to go to sea rather than work the fields. In addition to the analysis of seafaring careers, Dr. Vickers also looks at maritime life ashore, including sailors wives, and the laws that regulated life at sea. Appendices include primary sources, graphs, and ships logs. Maps and black-and-white drawings illustrate the text, and a detailed index and notes accompany the book.\n\nThe sea was an integral part of Dutch history and culture, especially from the late sixteenth century through the seventeenth. Those who waged war against other countries, such as Spain, in defense of the Dutch Republic played a vital role in establishing the countrys independence. Although laws existed to draw the line between piracy and privateering, reality wasnt always so clear cut. The Sea Beggars--a ragtag assemblage of Dutch aristocrats, ultra-Calvinists, and riffraff--were a prime example of those warrior mariners who strayed between legal and illegal seizures of ships.\n\nDivided into three parts, this book examines the complexity and ambiguity of how the Dutch treated pirates and privateers from their country as well as those from other countries. The first section examines the laws and activities defining plundering and what society thought of these men and what they did. Part II examines the cultural aspects of national identity, the economic effects of piracy and privateering, and the importance of maritime life and trade to the survival of the Netherlands. The interpretation of maritime laws and the disparity in meting out punishment are analyzed in the final section of the book. Also of value are the glossary, chapter notes, and appendices, which include privateer instructions, income earned, privateer captures, and sailors captured by Algerian corsairs.\n\nThis comprehensive and scholarly examination sheds light on a topic long neglected, in part because of a devastating fire in 1844 that destroyed much of the archives of the Dutch Admiralty. As in other countries, the Netherlands enacted stringent laws that defined what constituted piracy and privateering, but their implementation strayed into murky waters. Lunsford expertly navigates what documentation still exists to provide readers with a better understanding of how men who skirted the law could become heroes rather than villains. She captures the essence of this dilemma from the outset with the tale of Claes Compaen, a privateer who became an infamous pirate, then rejoined society and became a law-abiding citizen. She also introduces readers to naval heroes, privateers, and pirates of the Netherlands, including the infamous Rock Brasiliano.\n\nPirates and privateers from England are most often discussed in books dealing with marauding adventures around South America. Peter Meazeys book covers the French privateers, in particular those from Saint Malo, who also ventured around Cape Horn to seek their fortunes. The opening chapters explain why this city was a haven for corsairs; the historical and legal framework within which they sailed during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; and the difference between them and pirates. Few outside of France may know their names, but Meazey introduces readers to Jack Walsh, René Duguay-Trouin, François Massertie, and Jacques Gouin de Beauchesne. Several English pirates--Thomas Stradling, William Dampier, and Alexander Selkirk--are also included in the narrative. The author incorporates information about French ships, trade between Saint Malo and Cadiz, Englands attempts to destroy this vital port, and how trade via the Cape of Good Hope led to the demise of this vital maritime center.\n\nRather than being a scholarly work, this book is written for the general public. The short chapters include many black-and-white illustrations and maps, as well as passages from first-hand accounts. The inclusion of what happened to who ties up loose ends. For those who can read French, Saint-Malo Cap Horn is a captivating introduction to one facet of privateering history.\n\nWhen the United States gains its independence from England, American sailing vessels become vulnerable to seizure by the Barbary corsairs. For a time the government negotiates treaties and pays tribute money to the rulers of the countries of North Africa to protect trade in the Mediterranean. Then in 1801 Tripoli declares war against the United States. When the USS Philadelphia runs aground and her officers and men become slaves, President Thomas Jefferson enlists William Eaton and a small contingent of Marines to undertake a daring secret mission that results in the American flag being planted in foreign soil for the first time. The details of what happened are long forgotten, but the deed itself is forever immortalized in the Marine Hymn.\n\nThe Pirate Coast details the events that led up to the secret mission and the arduous journey to see it through, the diplomatic negotiations that endangered Eaton and his men, the details and effect of the new peace treaty, and the eventual downfall of the Barbary corsairs. At the same time Zacks interweaves accounts from the men of the Philadelphia during their captivity in Tripoli.\n\nZacks presents a readable and intricate tale of Americas first covert mission on foreign soil. Readers experience Eatons frustration and anger at ineptitude and duplicity, as well as the hope and joy of the men from the Philadelphia after Stephan Decatur and his team blow up the ship.\n\nDuring World War II, Hitler used two types of vessels in an attempt to cripple Britain. Most people know about U-boats, but Auxiliary Cruisers, also known as surface raiders, disrupted maritime trade and diverted the Royal Navy with false radio reports of enemy raider activity. Converted cargo vessels, the raiders hid various weapons to seize and destroy any vessel except a large warship. They sailed under flags of neutral or friendly nations, while those aboard altered the ships profile and repainted her to maintain the vessels disguise. After capturing a prize, they confiscated what they could use and, if circumstances allowed, sent her to a German port with a prize crew aboard. If not, they sank her. Prisoners were housed aboard the raider and treated well.\n\nAlthough the tactics of these raiders mirrored those of pirates, Duffy points out that those who served aboard these vessels were neither pirates nor privateers, but loyal members of the German navy. Before firing the first shot, they revealed their true identities as German warships. These accounts of nine raiders include Atlantis, the first and most successful raider; Orion, whose travels equated to five circumnavigations of the world; Widder, whose captain was only one of two naval commanders convicted of war crimes; Thor, the only raider to complete two tours of duty; Komet, which attacked an enemy land base; and Michel, the last German warship in operation.\n\nThis book is not for pirate fans per se, but for those who want to see how others took the tactics pirates used and implemented them during a war. Those interested in World War II naval operations will also want to read these accounts. Each chapter includes a map showing the locations of where prizes were taken and short sidebars that relate events elsewhere related to the war. Appendices provide the raiders original names and German identities, technical data (length, beam, tonnage, etc.), and their armament and war records. Also included is a photo essay, information on a controversy regarding the Kormoran and the HMAS Sydney, a bibliography, and index. The only drawbacks to the narrative are the tendency to repeat Japanese treatment of prisoners turned over by the surface raiders in and near the Pacific and the inclusion of the same sidebar in different chapters. The book does end on a high note, though, with a recounting of the sea battle between the Stier, Stephen Hopkins, and Tannenfels.\n\nDuring the seventeenth century, Spain rules the Caribbean and Latin America, but other countries, particularly England, also wish to partake of the treasures these lands offered. In 1655 twenty-year-old Henry Morgan, a Welshman, arrives in Barbados as an ensign in Cromwells army. Their orders are to invade Cuba or Hispaniola. While they fail to carry out this task, they do seize Jamaica, where Morgan settles and eventually marries. The island also serves as his base of operation, from which he launches numerous attacks on Spanish towns and ships. In time he becomes the lieutenant-governor and commander of the naval forces that protect Jamaica and British interests in the Caribbean.\n\nBreverton clearly warns readers from the start that he is biased in Morgans favor--that he was the most famous buccaneer of all time a superb tactician and strategist who succeeded in campaigns against massive odds. Breverton also demonstrates how Esquemeling sometimes got his facts wrong when he wrote Buccaneers of America, against whom Morgan sued for libel and won.\n\nWhile Morgan was a saint compared to LOlonnais, the author refers to Morgan as a buccaneer. This contradicts what Breverton steadfastly denies: Morgan was not a pirate. A buccaneer, however, was a term that referred specifically to Caribbean pirates of this time period. For the most part Morgan sailed under a legitimate letter of marque, which made him a privateer, yet peace negated such documents and any acts he committed thereafter were acts of piracy. This book provides a good introduction to Sir Henry Morgan and his life, but it is neither a definitive study of the man nor does it provide the reader with an unbiased account.\n\nIn July 1876, two men face each other in a courtroom in County Cork, Ireland. Both have served aboard a merchant ship named the Caswell. James Carrick, an Englishman, testifies that Christos Bombos, a Greek, participated in a mutiny that results in the deaths of five men.\n\nWhen the Caswell sets sail from Glasgow in July 1875, sixteen men are aboard. What happens on the trip to South America is unknown, but once the ship docks in Buenos Aires in September, most of the crew opt to find other berths for the return journey. George Best, the captain of the Caswell, has to find a new crew, and strives to find men of various nationalities--English, Greeks, Maltese, Irish, and German. On December 4th, they set sail to search for a cargo before returning home. Even before they depart for Queenstown on January 1, 1876, the German and the Irishman jump ship, never to be seen or heard from again.\n\nThree days later, the Greeks and Maltese mutiny. Big George Peno stabs the captain twice before Guiseppe Pistoria shoots Best twice in the head. Next, Peno shoots the second mate, Allan McLean, in the arm, then Cristos Bombos stabs him twice in the back and Gaspari Pistoria stabs him while singing. Nicholas Morellos and Big George stab first mate William Wilson, after which Giuseppe shoots him. Giuseppe next shoots the eighteen-year-old steward, Emmanuel Griffiths, then cut[s] out his left breast. Gaspari Pistoria shoots him in the ear. After the killings, they weight the bodies with anchors and toss them overboard.\n\nThe surviving crewmembers, including two young apprentices, are British, and they bide their time. After the Pistoria brothers take one of the boats and sail away in February, the British stage a mutiny of their own, killing Big George Peno and Nicholas Morellos, but sparing Cristos Bombos. Under the command of James Carrick, the Caswell sets sail for Queenstown, arriving on May 13th. Bombos is tried for murder twice--the first trial ending in a hung jury. The second time the jury convicts him. Only one other mutineer ever stands trial for his crimes, Giuseppe Pistoria, but not until three years later.\n\nThe author begins the book with the intent of trying to piece together the events, which led to the mutiny--and to shed some light on its antecedents as well as its awful consequences. While he fails to achieve that goal, he does hypothesize as to why the foreigners mutinied rather than the British sailors. Breathnachs research and knowledge of the case, the law, the time period, and life at sea aboard a sailing ship are quite evident, but in attempting to explain what happens and why, he sometimes spends too much time examining peripheral points, as he does when he devotes an entire chapter to the man who hangs with Bombos, or when explaining the business of hanging. At times, too, the authors opinions on terrorism and jurisprudence intrude in the telling of the story. Those interested in mutinies, the legal system in Ireland, and unsolved mysteries will find this an intriguing puzzle of a mutiny rarely heard about in the annals of maritime history.\n\nThe Pass of Balmaha set sail from New York with a cargo of cotton destined for Russia. She was a ghost from another century, for the start of World War I in 1914 brought a quick end to the age of sailing ships. Captain Scott believed Americas neutrality would protect him through the British blockade of the North Sea, but he was wrong. A cruiser of the Royal Navy ordered her to put in at Kirkwall and installed an officer and six marines aboard the Pass of Balmaha to see that she did. The British officer insisted she fly the Union Jack rather than the American flag. Doing so negated her neutrality and made her a target. The next day the U-36 captured her and sailed her to Germany where she was refitted and armed as a sea raider -- one that could stay at sea for long periods of time and didnt require constant restocking of her coal supplies as the steamship raiders did.\n\nRechristened the Seeadler (Sea Eagle), she slipped through the British blockade in late December 1916 under the command of Count Felix von Luckner, a mariner skilled in the ways of sailing ships. Rather than keep captured prizes, as was the custom among privateers of the past, supplies and valuables were seized and the crews imprisoned aboard the Seeadler before the Germans sank the prize. Through a combination of luck, skill, and daring, she maintained anonymity while becoming a legendary sea raider of the war. Once her identity and that of her captain became known, she also became the most hunted vessel on the sea.\n\nBlaine Pardoe does a commendable job separating the facts from the legends about the Seeadler. His riveting recounting of her adventures is also a story of her captain, and the extraordinary means he took to protect his ship, his crew, and the prisoners forced to endure captivity in the midst of their enemy. Few today may have heard of either the Sea Eagle or Count von Luckner, but none will be disappointed in this tale of a gentleman pirate and a windjammer turned privateer.\n\n**Note to reader: Technically, Count von Luckner was neither a pirate nor a privateer. He was an officer in the German Navy.\n\nPerhaps the most successful pirate during the Golden Age of Piracy, Bartholomew Roberts never achieved the lasting infamy of Blackbeard and few people today would recognize his name. Yet, he seized more ships than any other pirate and his hunting grounds ranged from the Caribbean and South American coast to Canada to Africa. For three years (1719-1722) he terrorized mariners from England, France, Holland, Portugal, and Spain. Rough estimates put the total worth of ships and goods he confiscated at £100,000,000 in todays currency.\n\nBlack Bart Roberts is the story of Bartholomew Roberts. The first two chapters are devoted to Howell Davis, the pirate who introduced Roberts to the brotherhood. Of particular interest is the reprint of Captain Snelgraves account of his capture by Davis, which was published in 1734, for it provides a telling portrait of life as a pirate and how they treated prisoners. Four of the seven chapters concentrate on Roberts life, his voyages, and his demise and that of his crew. The final chapter is about John Phillips, a pirate aboard one of Roberts ships.\n\nToo much emphasis is placed on Howell Davis, however, and the chapter on John Phillips seems out of place. The level of inconsistency is also disturbing. Sometimes sources are cited, while other times they are lacking. Discrepancies about factual details on ships surface. For example, thirty-two ships make up the Lisbon fleet in one paragraph and in the next the count is forty-two. The Royal Fortune, one of Roberts ships, has forty-eight guns, then two sentences later it has forty-four. At times the author draws conclusions without verifying facts. The most glaring of these is when he states that Roberts red silk outfit, with the large diamond cross, gave him the epithet by French merchants and pirates of Le Joli Rouge, probably the origin of The Jolly Roger. Le joli rouge predates Roberts and, while Jolly Roger may stem from this French phrase, the first occurrence of pirates flying the Jolly Roger dates to 1701, almost two decades before Roberts became a pirate. Even so, this is an interesting introduction to a pirate that writers often neglected .\n\nPublished in 1697, A New Voyage Round the World, caused a sensation in England. Within nine months it went into three printings, and was translated into several foreign languages. This travel book was the first of several volumes William Dampier wrote. His observations of nature and indigenous peoples and their cultures influenced the writings of Daniel Defoe and Jonathan Swift, the studies of Charles Darwin, and the maritime education of Lord Nelson and Captain Cook.\n\nIn spite of his achievements and his influence on others, Dampier remains a relatively obscure individual. Much of what is known of his life comes from his books, which are based on his journals, the originals of which are lost. The Prestons sifted through early copies of his works, legal documents, and letters to recreate William Dampier, the man. They also visited the places he explored to gain a better understanding of what he saw and experienced during his twelve-year voyage around the world. To complete the picture, they consulted the journals of fellow buccaneers and privateers, as well as the writings of men he influenced long after his death.\n\nThis well-rounded biography provides a detailed portrait of a man who did extraordinary things fraught with danger and survived to share his experiences with others. The Prestons succinctly explore the complexities and contradictions of a man who was an adventurer, buccaneer, traveler, celebrity, and sailor. In the process they have written a compelling narrative that allows the reader to experience the excitement and perils of life during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, while learning about a man whose writings made a profound impression on writers, mariners, and scientists who came after him.\n\nEd Mast, President of Applied Technology Incorporated, has a problem.
