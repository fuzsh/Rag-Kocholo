        "text": "GC's Career\n\nHome page | Biography | Awards | Theatre | Films | TV | Radio | Other lists\n\nBorn. 1 October 1903, Manchester, England. Died. 25 April 1989, Hampstead, London, England\n\nShort Biography\n\n[Written in June 1995 for the Internet Movie Database by George Coulouris and Mary Louise Coulouris. Links to relevant photographs, reviews and theatre programmes have been added.]\n\nSon of a Greek immigrant father (merchant) and English mother, he was born in Salford, Manchester and educated Manchester Grammar School. George Coulouris was an actor of some force specialising in villains, particularly in his film roles, but quite able for nobler roles. Among the major films he appeared in were 'Citizen Kane', 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', 'I Accuse', 'Pappillon' and 'Murder on the Orient Express'. The film which established him as an interesting and reliable heavy, with his massive shoulders and hooded eyes, was 'Watch on the Rhine' (1943). However, he had worked in Hollywood before that through his meeting with Orson Welles.\n\nCoulouris studied with Elsie Fogerty at London's Central School of Speech and Drama. His London debut came in 1925 with 'Henry V' at the Old Vic. He was soon playing the Yank at the first British staging of Eugene O'Neill's 'The Hairy Ape'. By 1929 he had reached Broadway, via a modern dress version of 'Measure for Measure'; his stage part as Tallant in the 'The Late Christopher Bean' took him to Hollywood in 1933 for MGM's version.\n\nThe next milestone in his burgeoning career occurred when he was playing a piece called 'Ten Million Ghosts' and met an actor called Orson Welles. They got on well and he joined the Welles' Mercury Theatre, playing Mark Anthony in the famous modern dress production of 'Julius Caesar' (1937). When Welles went to Hollywood to make 'Citizen Kane', Coulouris climbed into movie history in the part of Walter Parks Thatcher. By that time his future as a cinema actor was assured and he went on to play character parts in a long string of Hollywood productions throughout the 1940s.\n\nAt the end of the 1940s Coulouris returned to live in England, joining the Bristol Old Vic where he was notable as Tartuffe, transferring to London. In the '50s and '60s George remained a stalwart stage actor in spite of his movie reputation. He liked nothing better than to grapple with Ibsen, Shaw, Strindberg, Moliere or Shakespeare. During these years he tackled Dr. Stockman in Ibsen's 'An Enemy of the People', Peter Flynn in O'Casey's 'The Plough and the Stars', the father in Sartre's 'Altona', Edgar in Strindberg's 'The Dance of Death' and Big Daddy in Tennessee William's 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'.\n\nAll of these are parts to swell a scene and Coulouris had the flourish to fill them, sometimes to overflowing, always compellingly. In Britain his film parts tended towards the mundane, though he rose to the occasion as the native Babalatchi in Carol Reed's 'An Outcast of the Islands' and seized rare chances to play comedy in 'Doctor in the House' (1953), 'Doctor at Sea' (1956) and the Frankie Howard vehicle 'The Runaway Bus (1954).\n\nTowards the end of his life he tried his hand at writing and produced some charming memoirs describing his early life in Manchester and his early stage experiences, as yet unpublished except for a vivid excerpt published in the Guardian newspaper in February 1986.\n\nMarried:\n\n1. Louise Franklin 1930 - 1976\n\nTwo children:\n\nGeorge Franklin, born 1937, a computer science professor living and working in London.\n\nMary Louise, born 1939, a practising artist living and working in Scotland.\n\n2. Elizabeth Donaldson 1977-1989\n\nAward:\n\nGeorge won a National Board of Review 'Best Actor' award in 1941 for his performance in Citizen Kane. Orson Welles was the only other Citizen Kane actor to win the same award.\n\nTheatre performances\n\nClick here for a comprehensive list of his 80+ stage performances, annotated with links to reviews, photos and programmes where they are available.\n\nHis early career (1926-1929) in London and at the Cambridge Festival Theatre is documented in this summary donated by Paul Cornwell. He left for the US in 1929 after meeting Louise.\n\nThis 1972 Who's Who in the Theatre entry contains a fairly complete list from 1929 onwards.\n\nThe Internet Broadway Data Base has details of most the shows he did in New York.\n\nFilm performances\n\nClick here for a comprehensive list of his 75+ film performances.

The RadioGold Index lists 55 shows that he did in the U.S. before 1949.\n\nAfter 1949 he performed in many plays and did several talks and interviews for the BBC, but the BBC Archives at the British Library are rather impenetrable. The most significant item is probably the series of three talks entitled \"To Hollywood and Back\" that he did on the BBC Home Service in 1962:\n\nThe transcript of these talks is available here.\n\nA nice review in the Sunday Times is here.\n\nOrson Welles' Mercury Theatre on the Air 1938-9\n\nFull-length recordings of most of the radio dramas broadcast by Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre Company during 1938 are available (and apparently copyright-free):\n\nTo download (slow) from: www.unknown.nu\n\nOn a single CD in MP3 format to buy for only $8 from: www.40sradio.us\n\nThe recordings are of surprisingly good quality, as are the productions - good entertainment value today!
