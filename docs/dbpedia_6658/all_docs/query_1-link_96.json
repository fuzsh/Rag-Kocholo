Stranger still are the rites that take place there.\n\nFor more about The Wicker Man 4K and the The Wicker Man 4K Blu-ray release, see the The Wicker Man 4K Blu-ray Review published by Dr. Svet Atanasov on October 9, 2023 where this Blu-ray release scored 4.5 out of 5.\n\nDirector: Robin Hardy\n\nWriter: Anthony Shaffer\n\nStarring: Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee, Diane Cilento, Britt Ekland, Ingrid Pitt, Lindsay Kemp\n\nProducer: Peter Snell\n\n» See full cast & crew\n\nThe Wicker Man 4K Blu-ray Review\n\nReviewed by Dr. Svet Atanasov, October 9, 2023\n\nRobin Hardy's \"The Wicker Man\" (1973) arrives on 4K Blu-ray courtesy of StudioCanal. The supplemental features provided on the release include new program with actress Britt Ekland; new program with actor/director Tim Plester and Justin Hardy; various archival interviews; making of featurettes; documentaries; vintage promotional materials; and a lot more. In English, with optional English SDH subtitles for all three versions of the film. Region-Free.\n\nA letter brings self-righteous police sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward, Breaker Morant) to a remote Scottish island looking for Rowan Morrison (Geraldine Cowper), a beautiful young girl who has disappeared without a trace. Howie promptly meets May Morrison (Irene Sunters, A Sense of Freedom), a local post office worker who mailed the letter to the mainland, but is told that Rowan never lived on the island and that her only daughter is Myrtle (Jennifer Martin).\n\nSeriously confused, Howie attempts to talk to the local residents, but after a few short conversations he realizes that everyone is lying to him. Later on, he also witnesses a number of strange rituals which confuse him even more. When he eventually meets the wealthiest and most respected man on the island, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), Howie is stunned to learn that the rituals are in fact part of everyday life.\n\nDetermined to find the missing girl and make sense of everything he has seen since his arrival on the island, Howie embarks on a dangerous mission and eventually makes a shocking discovery.\n\nWhat makes Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man so fascinating to behold is the fact that it effortlessly blends elements from different genres into what is essentially a cinematic puzzle whose key pieces can be arranged in a number of different ways. This allows The Wicker Man to be just as effective as a thriller as it is as a horror film.\n\nThe film's observations about religion, its purpose and use by people living in closed communities also feel remarkably modern. During the final act, in particular, there are many truths about the dangerous vacuum which religion is capable of creating in such communities.\n\nSome of the unusual rituals remind of the group scenes in Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock. They look utterly surreal, as if they have been extracted from a bizarre dream at a moment when everything in it somehow made perfect sense. The difference here is that it is easy to sense that they were inspired by an evil force.\n\nPaul Giovanni's music score is also very unusual. At times the music is calm and relaxing, even seductive, and other times grotesquely intense. It certainly has an identity of its own which is as misleading as that of the actual film. (Listen to Giovanni's Gently Johnny and Magnet's Sunset).\n\nThe cast is great. Woodward is very convincing as the perplexed sergeant who comes to realize that no one on the island can be trusted. Lee looks and sounds appropriately authoritative. Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt, two classic European beauties, also have small but memorable roles in the film.\n\nThe Wicker Man was lensed by cinematographer Harry Waxman (John Gilling's Fury at Smugglers' Bay, Basil Dearden's Sapphire, Blake Edwards' The Pink Panther Strikes Again).\n\nThe Wicker Man 4K Blu-ray, Video Quality 4K\n\n1080p\n\nStudioCanal's release of The Wicker Man is a 4K Blu-ray/Blu-ray combo pack. The 4K Blu-ray is Region-Free. However, the Blu-ray is Region-B \"locked\".\n\nPlease note that some of the screencaptures that appear with this article are taken from the 4K Blu-ray and downscaled to 1080p. Therefore, they do not accurately reflect the quality of the 4K content on the 4K Blu-ray disc, including the actual color values of this content.\n\nScreencaptures #1-8 are from the Director's Cut 4K Blu-ray.\n\nScreencaptures #10-14 are from the Director's Cut Blu-ray.\n\nA decade ago, StudioCanal restored The Wicker Man and produced this Region-B Blu-ray release, which featured three versions of the film: the Final Cut, the UK Theatrical Cut, and The Director's Cut. However, the Director's Cut was sourced from standard definition elements.\n\nThis new combo pack introduces a new 4K restoration of the Director's Cut, which is a reconstruction, too. Why? Because for certain parts of it, the only available elements are in standard definition. The release has two 4K Blu-ray discs, and two Blu-ray discs. The native 4K presentations of the three versions of the film can be viewed with Dolby Vision/HDR. I viewed the Director's Cut in its entirety with Dolby Vision and tested various sections of the Final Cut.\n\nFor obvious reasons, it is very easy to declare that this release has the best technical presentation of the Director's Cut. I think that all visuals that come from the 35mm materials look very good and have solid organic qualities. There are a few darker areas where I think that darker nuances look slightly more convincing in 1080p, but I would not say that the difference is significant. What about the standard definition insets? Well, you will instantly recognize them because the drop in quality is significant. (See screencapture #7). However, I must point out that while the drop in definition and clarity is very obvious, color balance is managed surprisingly well. Yes, there is still a difference, but considering the major discrepancies that exist between the color gamut of a standard definition source and the color gamut of a 4K source, the reconstructed visuals look very, very good. The rest can be described either as very good or excellent. Some native density fluctuations are still easy to identify. Image stability is excellent. Given the nature of the reconstruction job, I think it is fair to say that the entire film looks very healthy, too.\n\nThe Wicker Man 4K Blu-ray, Audio Quality\n\nThere are three standard audio tracks on this release: English LPCM 2.0. French LPCM 2.0, and German LPCM 2.0. Optional English SDH, French, and German subtitles are provided for the main feature. (Please keep in mind that a French track is not available on the Final Cut).\n\nYou will notice some fluctuations n quality on the reconstructed version of the Director's Cut, which is hardly surprising. How obvious are they? Well, they are pretty small and never become distracting. In fact, most can easily be mistaken for inherited fluctuations. This said, I did not encounter any real issues to highlight in our review.\n\nThe Wicker Man 4K Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras\n\n4K BLU-RAY DISC ONE - THE FINAL CUT\n\nRevisiting the Locations of The Wicker Man - in this new program, Dominic Hardy, son of Robin Hardy, visits some of the main locations in Dumfries and Galloway where The Wicker Man was shot fifty years ago.

Last year, Australian label Imprint Films produced a pretty spectacular three-disc Blu-ray set. Now, StudioCanal have this outstanding four-disc 4K Blu-ray/Blu-ray set. In the U.S., Lionsgate is about to put another 4K Blu-ray/Blu-ray set on the market. The main attraction in StudioCanal's combo release is the newly restored and reconstructed Director's Cut of The Wicker Man, which was previously made available only in standard definition. The Final Cut looks good too, but there was already a very good presentation of it on StudioCanal's Blu-ray release from a decade ago. I think that this is the end of the line for The Wicker Man on the home video market, so if you want to have the best presentations of its three versions, consider picking up this combo release for your collection. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nThe Wicker Man: Other Editions\n\n4K\n\n4-disc set\n\n£19.99\n\n4K SteelBook\n\n4-disc set\n\nBlu-ray\n\n2-disc set\n\nBlu-ray\n\n1-disc\n\nSteelBook\n\n2-disc set\n\nZavvi\n\nBlu-ray\n\n2-disc set\n\nSimilar titles you might also like\n\nWhat is this?\n\nUse the thumbs up and thumbs down icons to agree or disagree that the title is similar to The Wicker Man.
