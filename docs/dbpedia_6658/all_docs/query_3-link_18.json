        "text": "Here’s the blurb:\n\nIt was meant to be the start of quiet season in the sleepy Cornish village of Seal Bay, but not for sexagenarian librarian and wild swimming enthusiast Morwenna Mutton. Because when a local businessman is found on the beach with a bread knife is his back, bungling police officer DI Rick Tremayne is soon out of his depth. Morwenna knows it’s going to be down to her to crack the case.\n\nThe list of people the victim upset is long, the evidence is slight, and an arrest illusive. Morwenna has plenty to occupy her time what with ghostly goings-on at the library and skullduggery at her granddaughter’s school, but she could never resist a challenge. And even the most ruthless of murderers should quake at the sight of this amateur sleuth getting on her bike to track them down.\n\nIf you love Miss Marple and The Thursday Murder Club, then you’ll love The Morwenna Mutton mysteries.\n\nPurchase Link\n\nhttps://mybook.to/sealbaysocial\n\nMy Review\n\nFoul Play at Seal Bay is an intriguing cosy crime set in Cornwall, featuring our main character, Morwenna, who finds herself and her family embroiled in the murder investigation into who killed a local businessman.\n\nMorwenna is a wild swimmer, never happier than when the bitingly cold sea works to clear her mind, which she uses to good effect to help her solve the mystery. She’s a fun character – with a rich and varied life and not at all what we might expect from our sexagenarian sleuth.\n\nThe small-town atmosphere is well-evoked, and I really enjoyed the mystery. I look forward to reading more in this series.\n\nMeet the author\n\nJudy Leigh is the USA Today bestselling author of The Old Girls’ Network and Five French Hens and the doyenne of the ‘it’s never too late’ genre of women’s fiction. She has lived all over the UK from Liverpool to Cornwall, but currently resides in Somerset.\n\nConnect with Judy\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/judyleighuk/\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/judyleighwriter\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/judyrleigh/"
