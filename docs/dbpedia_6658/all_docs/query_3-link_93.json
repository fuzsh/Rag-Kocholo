        "text": "Welcome to our guide to the most Essential Action Movies! Where everyone enters…and only 140 leave. Which sounds like a lot, but when you’re considering thousands of action movies, it’s only the most thrilling, the most exciting, the most brutal, and the influential who make the cut!\n\nAction is a wide-open genre and term, and we endeavored to include something from every era, style, and movement of action movies. We have the classics (Die Hard, The French Connection), modern fan favorites (Hardcore Henry, John Wick), superhero blockbusters (Captain America: The Winter Soldier), and plenty from the macho ’80s (Commando, First Blood). Not to mention some action genre crossovers: sci-fi (Equilibrium), horror (They Live), and, of course, comedy (Beverly Hills Cop).\n\nInternationally, we reach as far as Hong Kong (Police Story, Hard-Boiled), Australia (The Road Warrior), England (Kingsman: The Secret Service), France (La Femme Nikita), Indonesia (The Raid: Redemption), Korea (The Villainess), and beyond.\n\nThese are the action movies whose influence can be seen in the films that followed. They spawned franchises, pushed back against time, defined and even expanded the genre. These are the badass movies that make audiences feel cooler from having seen them. In the interest of keeping the Essential Movies as tight and pure as possible, we excluded the genres of war, sports, Western, and samurai. Otherwise, a movie’s Tomatometer score was not a factor, so long as the plot was kicked forward in a hail of bullets, car chases, fist fights, and martial arts wizardry.\n\nNow, it’s time to pound faces and popcorn, with the 140 Essential Action Movies to watch now! —Alex Vo\n\n#140\n\nRunning Scared (1986) 63%\n\n#140\n\nAdjusted Score: 64711%\n\nCritics Consensus: Running Scared struggles to strike a consistent balance between violent action and humor, but the chemistry between its well-matched leads keeps things entertaining.\n\nSynopsis: Ray and Danny (Gregory Hines, Billy Crystal) are two Chicago police detectives hot on the trail of drug kingpin Julio...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Yimou Zhang\n\n#137\n\nRoad House (1989) 44%\n\n#137\n\nAdjusted Score: 48081%\n\nCritics Consensus: Whether Road House is simply bad or so bad it's good depends largely on the audience's fondness for Swayze -- and tolerance for violently cheesy action.\n\nSynopsis: The Double Deuce is the meanest, loudest and rowdiest bar south of the Mason-Dixon Line, and Dalton (Patrick Swayze) has... [More]\n\nDirected By: Rowdy Herrington\n\n#136\n\nUnstoppable (2010) 87%\n\n#136\n\nAdjusted Score: 94891%\n\nCritics Consensus: As fast, loud, and relentless as the train at the center of the story, Unstoppable is perfect popcorn entertainment -- and director Tony Scott's best movie in years.\n\nSynopsis: When a massive, unmanned locomotive roars out of control, the threat is more ominous than just a derailment. The train... [More]\n\nDirected By: Tony Scott\n\n#135\n\nShaft (1971) 88%\n\n#135\n\nAdjusted Score: 93408%\n\nCritics Consensus: This is the man that would risk his neck for his brother, man.

[More]\n\nDirected By: Renny Harlin\n\n#131\n\nNational Treasure (2004) 46%\n\n#131\n\nAdjusted Score: 51777%\n\nCritics Consensus: National Treasure is no treasure, but it's a fun ride for those who can forgive its highly improbable plot.\n\nSynopsis: Historian and code-breaker Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) has been searching his whole life for a rumored treasure dating back to... [More]\n\nDirected By: Jon Turteltaub\n\n#130\n\nThe Protector (2005) 53%\n\n#130\n\nAdjusted Score: 55839%\n\nCritics Consensus: Despite some impressive fight scenes, this trimmed-down version of the Thai action pic is an off-putting mix of scant plot, choppy editing, and confusing subtitles and dubbing.\n\nSynopsis: A young fighter (Tony Jaa) travels to Australia to retrieve stolen elephants that were promised originally to the king of... [More]\n\nDirected By: Prachya Pinkaew\n\n#129\n\nRevenge (2017) 93%\n\n#129\n\nAdjusted Score: 99853%\n\nCritics Consensus: Revenge slices and dices genre tropes, working within an exploitation framework while adding a timely -- yet never less than viscerally thrilling -- feminist spin.\n\nSynopsis: Jen is enjoying a romantic getaway with her wealthy boyfriend -- until his two sleazy friends arrive for an unannounced...

[More]\n\nDirected By: King Hu\n\n#126\n\nTop Gun (1986) 58%\n\n#126\n\nAdjusted Score: 65812%\n\nCritics Consensus: Though it features some of the most memorable and electrifying aerial footage shot with an expert eye for action, Top Gun offers too little for non-adolescent viewers to chew on when its characters aren't in the air.\n\nSynopsis: The Top Gun Naval Fighter Weapons School is where the best of the best train to refine their elite flying... [More]\n\nDirected By: Tony Scott\n\n#125\n\nCon Air (1997) 58%\n\n#125\n\nAdjusted Score: 62470%\n\nCritics Consensus: Con Air won't win any awards for believability - and all involved seem cheerfully aware of it, making some of this blockbuster action outing's biggest flaws fairly easy to forgive.\n\nSynopsis: Just-paroled army ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is headed back to his wife (Monica Potter), but must fly home aboard... [More]\n\nDirected By: Simon West\n\n#124\n\nThe Expendables 2 (2012) 67%\n\n#124\n\nAdjusted Score: 72959%\n\nCritics Consensus: Taut, violent, and suitably self-deprecating, The Expendables 2 gives classic action fans everything they can reasonably expect from a star-studded shoot-'em-up -- for better and for worse.\n\nSynopsis: Mercenary leader Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) and the rest of the Expendables team reunite when Mr....

However,... [More]\n\nDirected By: Doug Liman\n\n#121\n\nRush Hour (1998) 62%\n\n#121\n\nAdjusted Score: 66387%\n\nCritics Consensus: While it won't win any awards for originality, the combustible chemistry between its stars means Rush Hour hits just as hard on either side of the action-comedy divide.\n\nSynopsis: When a Chinese diplomat's daughter is kidnapped in Los Angeles, he calls in Hong Kong Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan)... [More]\n\nDirected By: Brett Ratner\n\n#120\n\nThe Equalizer (2014) 61%\n\n#120\n\nAdjusted Score: 70580%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Equalizer is more stylishly violent than meaningful, but with Antoine Fuqua behind the cameras and Denzel Washington dispensing justice, it delivers.\n\nSynopsis: Robert McCall (Denzel Washington), a man of mysterious origin who believes he has put the past behind him, dedicates himself... [More]\n\nDirected By: Antoine Fuqua\n\n#119\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016) 90%\n\n#119\n\nAdjusted Score: 111109%\n\nCritics Consensus: Captain America: Civil War begins the next wave of Marvel movies with an action-packed superhero blockbuster boasting a decidedly non-cartoonish plot and the courage to explore thought-provoking themes.\n\nSynopsis: Political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the Avengers lead to collateral damage.

[More]\n\nDirected By: Michael Bay\n\n#114\n\n#114\n\nAdjusted Score: 64686%\n\nCritics Consensus: Die Hard with a Vengeance benefits from Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's barbed interplay, but clatters to a bombastic finish in a vain effort to cover for an overall lack of fresh ideas.\n\nSynopsis: Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is now divorced, alcoholic and jobless after getting fired for his reckless behavior and bad...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Michael Davis\n\n#110\n\nCrank (2006) 62%\n\n#110\n\nAdjusted Score: 65671%\n\nCritics Consensus: Crank's assaultive style and gleeful depravity may turn off casual action fans, but audiences seeking a strong dose of adrenaline will be thrilled by Jason Statham's raucous race against mortality.\n\nSynopsis: Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), a hit man wanting to go straight, lets his latest target slip away, then he awakes...
