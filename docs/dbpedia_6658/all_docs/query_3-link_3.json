        "text": "It's 1790 and British Naval Commander Redway is driven by greed for money and will stop at nothing to get it. His second in command, David Robinson, questions his allegiance when Redway kills his father and takes his brother prisoner. In order to save his brother and avenge his father's death David must join forces with a band of pirates, led by Captain Bernard, hunt down and kill Redway. Along the way we are treated to sea battles, blood-thirsty cannibals, and wall-to-wall action.\n\nLydia and William sail into a swashbuckling adventure when the search for their missing father lands them on a deserted island fighting eight pirates for the map and the treasure it leads to. How will they survive? Who will get the treasure?\n\nA professor's daughter craves excitement and sends her father on a treasure hunt. The captain leaves him to die on the island and returns for his possessions and the girl. Dick saves her father from the island and comes to her rescue.\n\nThis genuine swashbuckler is yet another film from prolific Director Chano Urueta. It is based on the 1868 novel \"The Black Corsair\" by Italian author Emilio Salgari. Set in the Caribbean Sea during the 1700's age of piracy, it chronicles the adventures of a pirate, (Pedro Armendariz) and his long-standing war against a colonial Governor (Jose Baviera) from Venezuela, who is determined to stop his nemesis. Actress June Marlowe plays the pirate's love interest. Maria Luisa Zea and Jose Pulido round out the cast.\n\nPirates searching for treasure take over a small town in Central America where they believe the loot is buried, but discover that a church has been built over the spot. They force the townspeople to dig for it, but there are more surprises in store for them than they counted on.\n\nCaptain Blackie conceives a plan to acquire a shipment of Spanish gold after he discovers about it when he stumbles upon Don Pedro. Three other pirate captains want the gold for themselves and try to foil Blackie's plan.\n\nAfter treating a Monmouth rebel against King James II in 1680s England, a young Irish doctor is exiled as a slave to Jamaica where he captures a Spanish galleon and becomes the most feared pirate of the Caribbean.\n\nAnthony Dexter---bare-chested most of the film with the smoldering nostrils from \"Valentino\"---as \"Captain Kidd\" is saved from hanging by an Earl who wants to get his hand on Kidd's treasure. The Earl thinks the best method is to put a woman confederate (Jeanine Duvall) aboard Kidd's ship as a slave girl to wrest or wrestle the information from him. They fight a lot as a prelude to falling in love, and then work together against the evil Earl's none-too-well laid plan. Alan Hale, Jr. (Simpson) is along as Kidd's trusted friend, while Sonia Sorrell (as Ann Bonney) displays a lot of what the best-undressed female pirate wasn't wearing on pirate ships of the time.\n\nFrancis Barclay, a former member of the British Admiralty, who was captured in the early 1700s and sold into slavery by Andrew MacAllister, and forced into piracy, enlists the aid of Dick Lindsay, to help him invade MacAllister's fortified island. The latter falls in love with MacAllister's daughter Christine. Complications arise as the man thought to be a nephew of one man may not be, and the daughter of one man may be the other man's daughter."
