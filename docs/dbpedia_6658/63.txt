SADLY, today we say goodbye actor John Fraser... a Scottish actor and author. His partner of 42 years, Rodney Pienaar confirmed that John had died on Saturday after returning home from a stay in hospital. Throughout his career, John Fraser was a very busy actor, on both the big and small screen from about early 1960's until the late 80's. Quite a few notable roles and the reputation of being touted as the 'most handsome man in Britain' for a while

#JohnFraser was cast as #PeterCushing 's son, Christopher Trevenyan in the film 'Fury at Smugglers Bay' in 1961, an interesting widescreen movie, that almost seems like a relation to Cushing's #Hammerfilm 'Night Creatures' aka 'Captain Clegg' which came swashbuckling along a few months later in 1962!

FRASER WORKED with an impressive line up of top billing actors, including #PeterSellers and Alec Guinness, but first came to public notice in 1955 as the doomed Flt Lt J V “Hoppy” Hopgood DFC in 'The Dam Busters' in 1955. Later, Fraser had leading roles in films such as 'El Cid', 'The Trials of #OscarWilde' (playing Lord Alfred Douglas), #RomanPolanski's Repulsion, Isadora and Schizo. He made appearances on television series including Danger Man (1964), Randall and Hopkirk (1969), #Columbo (1972), Doctor Who (1981) and The Bill (1995).

NOTABLY IN THE 1960'S his novel 'Clap Hands If You Believe in Fairies' was a first in bringing the devastation caused by the #thalidomide drug to the attention of a wider public. In the late 1990's, Fraser retired from film making and acting to Tuscany in Italy. In 2004, he published his autobiography, Close Up, in which he wrote frankly about his gay life and friendships.
