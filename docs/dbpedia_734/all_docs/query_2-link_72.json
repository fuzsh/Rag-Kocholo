Here are some methods to capture a reporter's attention:\n\nNote: You can plan Black History Month events in conjunction with Langston Hughes second-day stamp ceremonies. You should place emphasis on the fact that this is the 25th anniversary of the Black Heritage stamp series featuring Langston Hughes on the centennial of his birth.\n\n Have a month-long Black History Month celebration involving employees and their families, school children, and congressional, civic, and community leaders. Involve those people in helping to create a traveling or permanent African-American stamp collection exhibit that could either be placed in Post Office lobbies or be taken to stamp events at libraries, schools, or museums throughout the month of February. Highlight a different honoree theme every week of the month. Some examples of different themes might include sports figures, entertainers, inventors, educators, leaders, and scientists.\n\n- Photo opportunity: Encourage media to cover the opening day of your exhibit. Media can take pictures of employees and community members setting up the exhibit to accompany an article about Black History Month.\n\n- Opening day of exhibit should include Langston Hughes commemorate stamp and the Black Heritage series stamp unveiling ceremony. Ask congressional, civic, and community leaders to participate in ceremonies.\n\n Invite local children to design stamps about African- American history, and display their designs in the Post Office. Have local customers select the winners. Winners can be awarded Black Heritage or other commemorative stamp materials.\n\n Using this kit, spread the word about Black History Month and the Langston Hughes commemorative stamp in your community by giving presentations and workshops to local elementary schools, libraries, reading clubs, and community organizations like the Scouts and the Rotary Club.\n\n Look for opportunities to partner with local philatelic organizations that may be sponsoring local exhibits or second-day events. Offer to speak or conduct workshops, or organize volunteers from among your staff to help.\n\n Help local after-school programs set up stamp-collecting clubs and share African-American history. Ask a local stamp collector to set up a display of stamp collecting tools and philatelic materials, such as tongs, magnifier, perforation gauge, albums, first-day covers, and so on. Go online to the American Philatelic Society's Web site at www.stamps.org to find local chapters (including African-American stamp clubs) and affiliates that might be willing to help.\n\nPostal Service employees can find an electronic version of the Langston Hughes stamp publicity kit on the Intranet at http://blue.usps.gov. Click on References, then scroll down and click on Postmaster Toolkits. This electronic version makes it easy to complete the fill-in-the-blank materials included in this kit.\n\nImplement any of these ideas, combine them, or brainstorm with your employees and come up with ideas of your own. Be sure to publicize each and every event to your local newspaper, radio, and television stations via press releases, media advisories, and letters to the media contained in this publicity kit. Don't forget to make follow-up telephone calls.\n\nStamp Artwork\n\nTo purchase stamp artwork for Langston Hughes or other honorees in the Black Heritage commemorative stamp series, including color transparencies, color prints, and \"enlargements,\" contact:\n\nDAN TRACY\n\nDODGE COLOR\n\n4827 RUGBY AVENUE STE 100\n\nBETHESDA MD 20814-3028\n\nE-mail: dant@dodgecolor.com\n\nPhone: 301-656-0025 x230\n\nPlease plan ahead and allow enough time for production and shipping.\n\nSuggested Participating Organizations and Contact Information\n\nThe information below is a suggested listing of partners for Langston Hughes second-day events to help generate maximum exposure for the Langston Hughes stamp and Black Heritage stamp series.\n\nOmega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.\n\nHughes was a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.\n\nContact:\n\nLewis Anderson\n\nNational Chairman\n\nArtifacts and Memorabilia\n\nOmega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.\n\n718-817-4936\n\ne-mail: LewisEpsilon@aol.com\n\nAcademy of American Poets\n\nNational Poetry Month is April.

Hughes joins 24 other honorees in the Postal Service's Black Heritage series, which salutes outstanding African-American activists, theorists, writers, educators, and leaders.\n\nLangston Hughes is particularly known for his colorful portrayals of black life in America from the 1920s through the 1960s. He wrote novels, short shories, and plays, as well as poetry. Some of Hughes' most noted works of poetry include The Weary Blues (1926), The Negro Mother and other Dramatic Recitations (1931), The Dream Keeper (1932), Shakespeare in Harlem (1942), Fields of Wonder (1947), One Way Ticket (1947), The First Book of Jazz (1955), Tambourines to Glory (1958), Selected Poems (1959), and The Best of Simple (1961).\n\nOther notable Americans in the series include Harriet Tubman, Martin Luther King, Jr., Jackie Robinson, Carter G. Woodson, Mary McLeod Bethune, Bessie Coleman, Ernest E. Just, Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., Madam C. J. Walker, Malcolm X, Patricia Roberts Harris, and Roy Wilkins who was honored in January 2001.\n\nAfrican Americans have played a vital role in the shaping of America's history, and the U.S. Postal Service is committed to educate and inform America regarding their achievements and contributions.\n\nThere have been numerous e-mail rumors and newspaper articles stating that the U.S. Postal Service will discontinue its long-standing Black Heritage stamp series. This is absolutely untrue! It is unfortunate such rumors have spread. We are sincerely committed to honoring African Americans on stamps: given the popularity and importance of the Black Heritage stamps, there are no plans to discontinue the series.\n\nLearning about our history and notable African Americans through stamps can help us learn more about today's world and ourselves.\n\nWe encourage children and adults to continually learn about Black history and African Americans on stamps. There is a phenomenal story behind every commemorative stamp - stories that can take us back in time to learn about great Americans.\n\nStamps can also take us back in time and help us relive moments in the past - moments that we cherish.\n\nFor more than 200 years the Postal Service has been a shining example of a public service institution that the American people can rely on and trust. But in many ways, it's our commemorative stamp program that best connects the Postal Service with the American people.\n\nThis month, we hope children and adults of all ages will be participating in Black History Month activities around the country.\n\nThanks to all of you for joining us here today.\n\n# # #\n\nSuggested Public Relations Timeline\n\nNote: If you have questions or need assistance with any of these items, please contact your area's Public Affairs and Communications representative.\n\nAction: Suggested Timing: 1.

It was during his high school years that he began writing poetry. Following graduation from high school, Hughes spent a year in Mexico and a year at Columbia University. He then traveled to Africa and Europe. He finished his college education at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. Hughes was a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.\n\nAlthough Hughes considered himself a poet first, he also wrote novels, short stories, and plays. Some of Hughes' most noted works of poetry include The Weary Blues (1926), The Negro Mother and other Dramatic Recitations (1931), The Dream Keeper (1932), Shakespeare in Harlem (1942), Fields of Wonder (1947), One Way Ticket (1947), The First Book of Jazz (1955), Tambourines to Glory (1958), Selected Poems (1959), and The Best of Simple (1961).\n\nHughes died of cancer on May 22, 1967, in Harlem, New York, at the age of 65. His block of East 127th Street was renamed \"Langston Hughes Place.\"\n\nThe Postal Service continues its commitment to honoring the historical achievements and contributions of African Americans.

They are likely to have a keen interest in the event, as it provides elected representatives a chance to interact with constituents in a friendly, civic setting with secured media coverage.\n\nYou are encouraged to reach out directly to your federal, state, and local elected officials. Government Relations representatives are available to assist you in coordinating political involvement and would be pleased to help in any way.\n\nThis Black History Month Community Relations publicity kit contains simple guidelines, sample letters, a suggested invitation list, and the names and telephone numbers of your Government Relations contacts.\n\nBefore the Event\n\nSend a written invitation 4 to 6 weeks before the event to your two U.S. Senators, your congressional representatives, your state governor, and the mayor of your community. Please include any other local elected officials you feel would be appropriate. The local postmaster should sign the invitations.\n\nFollow up the written invitation with a telephone call to the elected official's scheduler within a week if you have not received a reply. You may need to call more than once.\n\nKeep in touch with all elected officials who respond. If asked, provide updated information to the elected official's staff as it becomes available (i.e., who else is participating, where and when to meet, what his or her role will be, etc.) Stress that remarks should be brief and limited to the unveiling of the Langston Hughes and Black Heritage stamps and recognition of the role the U.S. Postal Service continually plays in celebrating African-American history with stamps.\n\nInclude names of all participating elected officials on the \"official program\" as honored guests, and mention them in all media advisories.\n\nProvide a courtesy copy of the program to the elected official in advance.\n\nAfter the Event\n\nSend a written thank-you letter to all elected officials who participated in the ceremony, expressing your appreciation.\n\nProvide copies of any newspaper articles about the event to their offices. Even though they might see those articles on their own, you can take the opportunity to remind them of the press coverage the event received.\n\nProvide a supply of extra cachets with the special cancellation, if applicable, to elected officials, even to those who could not attend. These make great give-aways and serve as a positive reminder of the event.\n\nObtain and frame a photo of the elected official posing beside the stamp image and make an appointment to present it in person, if possible. A matted, well-framed photograph stands a good chance of being hung on the wall of the official's office, again serving as a positive reminder of the event.\n\nKeep in touch with your elected officials. Good relationships are built over time.\n\n# # #\n\nSAMPLE INVITATION TO PUBLIC OFFICIALS\n\n[INSERT DATE]\n\n[INSERT NAME]\n\n[INSERT TITLE]\n\n[INSERT ORGANIZATION]\n\n[INSERT ADDRESS]\n\n[INSERT CITY, STATE, ZIP+4]\n\nDear [INSERT TITLE AND NAME]:\n\nEmployees of the [INSERT NAME] Post Office invite you to be an honored guest at a special ceremony celebrating Black History Month on [DATE] at [TIME].
