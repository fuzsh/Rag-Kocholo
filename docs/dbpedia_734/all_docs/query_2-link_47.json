        "text": "Benny DeTroy Shuman, Jr., affectionately known to many as \"Buck,\" passed away on May 31, 2024, at the age of 91. Born on January 4, 1933, in Reidsville, Georgia, to the late Benny Sr. and Mattie Lou Shuman, Buck spent the majority of his life in Tattnall County, where he left an indelible mark on his community.\n\nIn 1943, at the tender age of ten, Buck dedicated his heart to the Lord and became a devoted member of the Reidsville Methodist Church, now known as Grace Pointe Reidsville. His faith remained a cornerstone of his life, and he was a dedicated member until his passing.\n\nAfter graduating from Reidsville High School, Buck served his country honorably in the U.S. Army. Following his military service, he worked for five years in Atlanta with US Plastering. However, the call of his beloved Tattnall County brought him back home in 1958. Upon his return, Buck purchased Reidsville Feed and Seed, later renaming it Shuman Fertilizer and starting a new venture, Shuman Farms.\n\nBuck married Brenda Grinstead, and together they had four children. Their love and commitment endured for 37 years until Brenda's untimely passing. His feed and seed business became the foundation of a career that spanned over 60 years, during which he served the local agricultural community with distinction. Buck was a pioneer in the now world-renowned Vidalia Onion industry. His contributions were recognized in 2012 when he was inducted into the Vidalia Onion Hall of Fame. From 1996 to 2021, Buck was a seed representative for D. Palmer Seed, aiding in the development of new Vidalia Onion varieties.\n\nLater in life, Buck found love again and married Marjorie Franklin. They shared 24 wonderful years together until his death. Buck's dedication to his community was evident through his service as a Reidsville City Council member, President of the Reidsville Jaycees, Board of the Tattnall Bank, board member of Chem-Nut, and a 14-year member of the Tattnall County Board of Education.\n\nAn avid outdoorsman, Buck loved hunting and fishing. He was also a devoted fan of the Georgia Bulldogs, spending most fall Saturdays attending or watching their games. Whenever time allowed, Buck enjoyed playing golf.\n\nAbove all, Buck valued his family. He showered them with love and affection, and would proudly tell everyone that his family was his greatest treasure on Earth and second only to his salvation in the Lord. In this aspect, Buck was the richest man in the world, and moreover he embraced every second spent with them. A man’s man that worked tirelessly, loved fearlessly, and worshiped faithfully; he will be deeply missed by all who knew him.\n\nBuck is survived by his loving wife of 24 years, Marjorie Shuman of Reidsville; his four children, Anna Shuman, Ben Shuman, John (Lana) Shuman, and Mark (Victoria) Shuman, all of Reidsville; beloved step-children, Marcie (Chris) Garrett of Vidalia and Matt (Dawn) Davis of Savannah; seven grandchildren who were the apple of his eye, Megan (Marco) Micalletto, Luke and Jake Shuman, Chapman and Mason Shuman, and Skylar and Evan Davis. He is also survived by several cousins, nieces, nephews, other relatives, and countless friends made along life's journey.\n\nVisitation will be held on Sunday, June 2, 2024, from 3:00 p.m. until 6:00 p.m. at the chapel of Low Country Cremation & Burial. Funeral services will be held on Monday, June 3, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. at Grace Pointe Reidsville with Rev. John Crosby and Rev. Marc Foster officiating. Interment will follow at Reidsville City Cemetery.\n\nThe family is honored by all expressions of sympathy, but suggest memorial contributions in Buck’s memory to be made to Paul Anderson Youth Home, 1603 McIntosh Street Vidalia GA 30474\n\nPallbearers will be Luke Shuman, Jake Shuman, Chapman Shuman, Mason Shuman, Evan Davis, and Mike Shuman."
