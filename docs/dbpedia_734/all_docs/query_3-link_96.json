        "text": "November 20, 2023\n\nAs a old white guy, I’ve felt compelled in my senior years to try to cast off long-held multi-generational assumptions and learn about the realities of the African -American experience, so I’ve been doing a lot of reading. This book sounded interesting.\n\nI love airplanes, my Dad was a WWII aviator and I was fascinated by the “Red Tails”. It never occurred to me that Gen. Ben Davis, one of my heroes, was Invisible.\n\nBut his kin, author Doug Melville, makes a persuasive case that Davis, his father Ben Sr. like most African-Americans, have been made invisible by racism.\n\nBut instead of bemoaning the situation, Melville decided to follow his relatives’ example and do something about it. This inspired, easy to read book is the result.\n\nMy respect for Gen. Davis was heightened, but I also was helped along my personal quest to better understand a reality far afield from my relatively privileged white experience.\n\nJanuary 11, 2024\n\nThe author tells the fascinating story of his great-uncle, Ben Davis, Jr. and his great-great uncle, Ben Davis, Sr. (known as Ollie), who were America's first Black generals. They faced and overcame racism to pursue their dreams in the military. Ben, Jr. was finally admitted to West Point (which didn't used to accept Black men), but once there, the other cadets subjected him to \"silencing,\" only speaking to him in the line of duty. No one would room with him, so he lived alone. No one would let him eat at their table in the dining hall, so he ate alone. But he persevered, used his solitary existence to study, and did well in all his courses, except those that required his classmates to talk to him.\n\nBen wanted more than anything to be a pilot, something that wasn't possible before 1941 when the Army decided to establish an all-Black flying unit. The Army was segregated prior to 1946. Black soldiers did mostly cleaning and cooking, not fighting. Ben nearly didn't get into the flying unit because the flight surgeon who performed his physical reported falsely that he had a history of epilepsy. Headquarters understood why he'd failed the physical and gave him another one, which he passed.\n\nBen finally became a four-star general twenty-eight years after he retired from the military, but on condition that he receive none of the financial benefits he would have had if he'd been given the fourth star when he should have. Melville estimates that this deprived Ben and his family of about a million dollars.\n\nI don't know how much this book adds to the 1989 biography by Marvin Fletcher, \"America's First Black General,\" although it does add details about the family, including the fact that Ben's wife, Agatha, had a hysterectomy in Tuskegee, something Ben apparently didn't know about. Was this something she consented to, or was she a victim or forced sterilization as so many Black and poor women were, or the overuse of hysterectomies for many medical conditions? This remains a mystery.\n\nI almost didn't read the book because of the business school language at the beginning. The book is diminished by the author's focus on his own achievements and his advice at the end on how to succeed. I'm glad I did read it because the story is so interesting and the retelling of America's racist past (not over yet!) is so important.\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nThis book is ideal for Black History Month, shedding light on the challenges faced by the pioneering Black Generals whose struggles still persist today. Shockingly, as of 2020, only 6.5 percent of Generals are African American. Here's hoping that one day, this statistic becomes irrelevant.\n\nFebruary 12, 2024\n\nThis was more of a personal retelling of ancestry and the many accomplishments they made rather than a memoir. I didn’t finish the very end because the last chapter turns into more of a self help book on how to inspire you to share your family story and brand yourself.\n\nI don’t like the military but thought it would be important to look into black experiences in the military. Particularly because in my undergrad, we had to talk about the discrimination and sexual harassment within the military and confront any biases we had towards certain populations. I personally don’t care for the military but I thought maybe this would put more things in perspective. It didn’t. This book is very contradictory because although it highlights these men did great things for their country it also repeats the fact that they did so because they weren’t given credit and were essentially “invisible.” Their mantra is to “change the system from the inside.” And with their personal goals of wanting to become a general for example,\n\nlike job well done you did it, but at what cost? Being mistreated by your peers, used and abused by your country, and never getting the proper acknowledgment that you should? Part of me wants to feel bad but generation after generation, maybe you should pick a different career path instead of suggesting your child endure the same bullshit. Also- them bringing up the Vietnam war and the general being sent to “diffuse” the situation on college campuses but not giving anymore info on the matter. How does one “diffuse the situation” of college kids getting killed for protesting? By coercing them and using propaganda? Or threatening them and killing them?\n\nI thought this would delve into how black men were coerced into fighting in the civil war but thats on me because I just skimmed the back and took it home. I also blame Barnes and Nobles for not having a table for Black History Month, I really had to wander to find something.\n\nJanuary 4, 2024\n\nAptly titled. Not so much a history or memoir but a motivational book to inspire. This book radiates passion, love, thoughtfulness, goodness, patience, persistence, and service. An intimate glimpse and voyage of discovery into a grandson discovering the depths of his ancestors total dedication to America despite being treated as second class citizens.\n\nDecember 21, 2023\n\nGeneral Benjamin O. Davis Sr. & General Benjamin O. Davis Jr… PEERLESS!!!\n\nGrace and elegance personified. This was one of those books that makes you tear up cause the trials and tribulations just seem so outlandish, unfathomable, down right awful!!! I’m hurt to know that the very institution that I serve in created such spaces for these men to not only question their worth but to question themselves… little did they know, the willpower bestowed upon these men was cut differently. I’ve had O’Day’s Autobio for some time now and after reading this book, I’ve now added it to my bedside pile and it WILL be read just as soon as I finish Four Seasons cause this is my history too! Shout out to these leaders, black men in the DoD that made it do what it do. 🙌🏽✨\n\nJanuary 20, 2024\n\nI liked this book but had to adjust from my assumptions about what it would be. I assumed it would be a historical deep dive unearthing the true Davis family legacy from decades of racist cover-ups, but it instead was more about the author’s professional life and work to establish the Davis family brand, trademarks, estate…. How to do so for yourself and your family…. And an advertisement for the author’s advertising/DEI career and accomplishments. It’s all completely understandable to seek to cement the Davis family legacy after decades of racism and invisibility, especially after what they suffered being leaders in a military that didn’t acknowledge their humanity; but this was not really a memoir, it could be part of a reading list for a brand/corporate strategy course in business school. The parts about the West Point barracks naming process were new to me. It was insightful and interesting but I’m now going to seek out other books to fill out my knowledge about Benjamin O. Davis Jr. and Sr.\n\nDecember 29, 2023\n\nRead all of my reviews at bit.ly/PageBedtime\n\nI first learned of Invisible Generals when I heard the author, Doug Melville, discussing the book on \"The Daily Show.\" Then, a day or so later, I heard him talking about the story of his grandfather and great-grandfather - the U.S. Air Force's first Black American generals - on \"The Breakfast Club\" radio show. I was really intrigued by what he had to say and how the movie \"Red Tails\" did not properly give these two trailblazers credit. I had a Audible credit to burn, so I purchased a copy. (It didn't hurt that Melville has a nice speaking voice and narrated the audiobook.) I also shared the book's synopsis with my husband, who's a retired U.S. Army veteran, and he started listening with me. We both thoroughly enjoyed this accurate re-telling.\n\nAnd that's basically the story of how I came to know and learn about Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. and Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., a father and son who helped integrate the U.S. military and were pivotal in founding the Tuskegee Airmen.\n\nLike most stories from this time period, the Davis' were each met with their own struggles and challenges to pave the way in a world that viewed them as less than simply because the color of their skin. Melville gives some background on how his great-grandfather persevered, but the bulk of the book focuses on Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., who overcame insurmountable obstacles - physical, mental, and racial - to begin a career at West Point, while being shut-out by his white peers, and then to build an outstanding military career throughout several decades and leave a lasting legacy. I think the thing that makes this book inspirational as well as educational is that both generals and their families operated in grace even when grace was not reciprocated. My favorite line from Melville's book is when he mentions that Davis, Jr. and his wife always believed in leading with joy. That's powerful, especially during a time when you could say there wasn't much fairness or happiness. I am not related to this family, but I am proud of the accomplishments that were made as if they were my own. This was a story that had to be told, and I'm thankful the author invested the time and worked diligently to get the book published.\n\nI truly enjoyed the way this story was presented. It was easy to follow, even in audio format, well-written, and it was a joy to listen to Melville because his passion for his ancestors permeates throughout the story. He is doing an excellent job of honoring their legacy in his own, albeit, civilian way.\n\nRecommendation: I highly recommend listening or traditionally reading this story. It's inspiring, impressive, and simply wonderful to learn about people who achieved greatness and paved the way for many of us today.\n\nUntil next time ... Read on!\n\nRegardless of whether I purchase a book, borrow a book, or receive a book in exchange for review, my ultimate goal is to be honest, fair, and constructive. I hope you've found this review helpful.\n\nRead all of my reviews at bit.ly/PageBedtime\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\nIn my experience as a USAF veteran, I was familiar with America's pioneering Generals, Benjamin O. Davis Sr. and Jr. However, I didn't initially realize they were father and son. While I knew about Benjamin Davis Sr.'s groundbreaking role as the first Black general, I was unaware of his service as a Buffalo Soldier. Similarly, I knew Benjamin O. Davis Jr. as the first four-star general, but I didn't realize he commanded the Tuskegee Airmen. This book delves deeply into the lives of these two remarkable men, shedding light on their experiences, their marginalization, and the ongoing efforts of their family to preserve and share their legacies. Reading about the injustices they faced was difficult, yet valuable, especially as their stories are recounted by a family member within the broader context of history and global events. Over all I enjoyed this book and encourage everyone to read it or listen to the audiobook.\n\nDecember 16, 2023\n\nDoug Melville decided to let the world know about his extraordinary ancestors. His grandfather and his great-grandfather were both 4 star generals, an amazing accomplishment in the segregated air force at the time. His great-grandfather's last star was actually presented many years after he retired. For a black family at the time, they were incredibly secure living a middle class life and building equity through home ownership. They earned their career success through hard work and the ability to rise above the prejudice they suffered. Through Doug's work, they have recently been honored. The story is actually better than the book and I skipped the advice section in the back.\n\nNovember 9, 2023\n\nPraise God this story is now visible\n\nThis is an incredible story often lost in African American and honestly the history of many Americans as the Davis father and son esteemed to be seen as just that, proud Americans. They loved their country dearly and found meaning by serving in the armed forces paving the way as a foundational bridge for those that would come after them. This book is a must read, the invisible story that would have gone unknown without the author’s craving for understanding of his incredible lineage.\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nAmazing and Inspiring\n\nThis book was wonderful and a truly enjoyable read. As both a graduate from Tuskegee University and a young black engineer learning to navigate the corporate world this book was inspiring. I was amazed at the role Ben and Olli played in creating the Tuskegee Airmen and the hardships the endured in their career. This book made appreciate even more what our ancestors sacrificed for us to have the opportunities we have today and empowers me to keep pushing for success in my career.\n\nNovember 24, 2023\n\nIf you have wondered what effect institutional racism might have on the lives of even prominent Black men and women in in this country, read this book. If you've seen the movie, Red Tails, read this book.\n\nExcept for Melville interjecting himself in to the story, this is a chronicle of one Black family's role in American military and civilian life. It is well worth the read.\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\nI knew a little about the Generals Davis but even less than l thought. It was good to learn so much more from this look from within the family and both disheartening and heartening in almost equal measure to learn with certainty how shoddily the military treated these honorable Americans and how they persevered and contributed.\n\nFebruary 24, 2024\n\nSome of the stories riveted my attention and sent me looking for more information about the Red Tails -- the Tuskegee Airmen. What honorable, inspiring men to have as ancestors.\n\nThe book's second section is a tutorial in how to uncover one's own family stories, something near and dear to my heart.\n\nDecember 4, 2023\n\nVery good book. I don't agree with some of the information but not everyone agrees on everything. Mostly, a great read. Well written and easy to follow along. Not to loaded with mindless dribble. I would definitely recommend.\n\nJuly 12, 2024\n\nVery powerful story, both of the injustices the Generals Davis suffered during their careers but also how their great-nephew, the author, fought for their legacies. And Melville included tips for advocating for your own family legacies in a section near the end.\n\nDecember 30, 2023\n\nMore history not taught in schools. Good coverage of minority Americans who have slighted by their country.\n\nJanuary 10, 2024\n\nDidn't like the narrator nor the 45 minutes of acknowledgements.\n\nJanuary 23, 2024\n\nAn amazing story of a Man and his son both which became generals. Truly inspiring for all ages. Also a blue print on maintaining a family's legacy each of us can follow\n\nFebruary 4, 2024\n\nThis is a must-read. The story of this family's service and the trials, racism & heartbreak. This story will shine light on their legacy, but it will also make you cry.\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nGood story about systemic prejudice in military and how 3 generations managed to overcome it to open door for others.\n\nMarch 24, 2024\n\nInformative. This book raised more questions about Black military history and what has not been recorded and reported.\n\nJune 23, 2024\n\nReally interesting history of the impact of a remarkable family on the military but also the US. Glad their story is being told. 3.5 rounded up to 4.\n\nDecember 28, 2023\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this novel, which became a pleasurable, joyous reading journey, with such a positive, enlightening story about the Invisible Generals, whom I knew so little about.\n\nI was educated about the names because of the Black History Month teaching I received in elementary school. However, the author presented an incredible historical account of the first two American Black four-star military generals.\n\nThe author is a first-time novelist who is an excellent storyteller and has produced an excellent work of historical knowledge, inspiring anyone and everyone who reads this novel to become inspired, filled with gratitude, and humbled with his words of wisdom to seek and cultivate a mindful understanding of diversity and inclusion within our world.\n\nNovember 5, 2023\n\nA book that brings to print the stories of Benjamin O. Davis (Sr. and Jr.), their service to our country, their strength in face of disrespect, and their legacy to their family.\n\nWhy is it that the stories of these two men are omitted from textbooks? Too many students have missed out on making a connection with the Invisible Generals that may have impacted the choices they made for careers. Luckily, Mr. Melville has put in the time, and love, to share the stories about the men in his family so that the rest of us can read all about it.\n\nThe recognition the two men did not have while in service is just now starting to reach the surface. After reading this book I am off to find a copy of Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.'s book to read even more about his life.\n\nOctober 23, 2023\n\nA Goodreads giveaway, this was certainly an interesting read, and very timely. Part inspirational/self-help guide, part DEI thesis, with just a small part dedicated to military history. Instead, the author uses his ancestors experiences in a viciously racist US military to illustrate how he continues to fightsfor diversity, equity, and inclusion in today’s world as a Chief Diversity Officer at a major marketing firm. While I would have preferred a more direct historical nonfiction read, it was certainly an interesting piece overall."
