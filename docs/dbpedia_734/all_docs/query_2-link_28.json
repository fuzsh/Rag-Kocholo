        "text": "To all who champion DEI please read this article: üí°How a father and son fought segregation and became the first Black generals in the US military‚Ä¶. As you read the article and celebrate the achievements of two generations of American heroes, I encourage you to open the link to the üí°1925 Study by the Army War College. I point this out because, as the current Anti-DEI rhetoric lament about America not being a ‚Äúracist society,‚Äù this study tells a different story‚Ä¶ America IS NOT the worst country in the world, BUT she has practiced racial discrimination policy based on an ideology of racism. If you see yourself as an champion of DEI then I ask you to read and understand US history. The facts are the facts. AND the fact is that DEI is not the problem, racism in America is the problem! The Anti-DEI movement is trying to erase and rewrite history! WHY? https://lnkd.in/eb3y8ifm\n\nAs we come to a close to Black History Month, know that Black History should be celebrated all year. Ally‚Äôs and DEI champions, I too encourage you to continue the journey with your knowledge and understanding that the work continues. People of color need you more now than ever as the article reflects financial equity gaps that goes back for centuries. #BlackHistoryMonth #DiversityandInclusion #FinancialEquity\n\nKudos to those who made this happen for the young man and his family.

As we reflect on this significant month, it's crucial to recognize the enduring legacy and bravery of Black Americans in military service. üéñÔ∏è Unsung Heroes Throughout history, Black Americans have served our country with distinction and valor, often in the face of immense challenges and without the recognition they deserved. From the Revolutionary War to present-day conflicts, their sacrifices and contributions have been instrumental in shaping the nation. üôèüèΩ Acknowledging Their Service Their stories of courage and resilience are a vital part of our military history. This month, we pay tribute to these heroes, acknowledging their service and ensuring their stories are not forgotten. üí¨ Join the Conversation As we embark on this month of reflection and celebration, let's share stories, honor these heroes, and continue our journey towards an inclusive and understanding community. Let's use this month to not only celebrate Black history but also to inspire our future. ***About the photo with original photo caption: \"These drivers of the 666th Quartermaster Truck Company, 82nd Airborne Division, who chalked up 20,000 miles each without an accident, since arriving in the European Theater of Operations.\" Local Identifier: 208-AA-32P-3, National Archives Identifier: 535533. #BlackHistoryMonth #DiversityInTech #VetsWhoCode #Inclusion #VeteranEmpowerment #MilitaryHeritage #HonorAndValor #InclusiveHistory #UnsungHeroes\n\nMemorial Day, originally known as Decoration Day, has its origins in the aftermath of the American Civil War. This was a period marked by deep, lingering wounds and profound loss across the nation. Yet, even as the conflict ended, a tradition of remembrance and reverence began to emerge. Interestingly, the first organized recognition of fallen U.S. soldiers took place on May 1, 1865, in Charleston, South Carolina. This solemn event was organized by Black Americans, who were resilient in their pursuit of justice and equality in the face of immense pain. This act of honoring the fallen speaks to the courage and honor that is ingrained in the fabric of Black history in America. As we observe Memorial Day today, let us take the time to honor the past, celebrate the present, and commit ourselves to building a better tomorrow. We must let the lessons of history guide us, while drawing strength from the spirit of unity and resilience that defines us as a nation. #MemorialDay2024\n\nToday is Juneteenth, a day celebrating the end of a horrific period of American history that many people still have a difficult time reckoning with. \"Even though the Emancipation Proclamation was made effective in 1863, it could not be implemented in places still under Confederate control. As a result, in the westernmost Confederate state of Texas, enslaved people would not be free until much later. Freedom finally came on June 19, 1865, when some 2,000 Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas. The army announced that the more than 250,000 enslaved black people in the state, were free by executive decree. This day came to be known as 'Juneteenth,' by the newly freed people in Texas.\" \"The Historical Legacy of Juneteenth\": https://lnkd.in/ejd2puYH I have read various pieces on Juneteenth, including the Wikipedia entry, and they all include important insights and historical facts. Do you have a recommended article, podcast, or video on the topic?\n\nBlack History Month should also be an opportunity to celebrate everyday folks. Don't get me wrong, we need to acknowledge Black excellence, exceptionalism, and those who have made profound historical contributions to this country, but we also need to acknowledge that not everyone needs to make history to be worth celebrating. So, here's to: ‚û°Ô∏è Black parents who work tirelessly to ensure a better life for their babies ‚û°Ô∏è Black educators who have given so much to their students ‚û°Ô∏è Black religious leaders who bring hope to their communities ‚û°Ô∏è Black artists and performers who shine, but never receive the spotlight ‚û°Ô∏è Black entrepreneurs who bring forth new concepts, ideas, and knowledge ‚û°Ô∏è Black military personnel who put their lives on the line to defend America ‚û°Ô∏è Black Americans who show up to work and give it their all each and every day ‚û°Ô∏è . . . Please keep adding to the list the comments! #black #blackhistorymonth #blackexcellence #entrepreneurs #celebrate #educators #blacklivesmatter #history #social #leadership #culture #community Photo credit: Adrian Fern√°ndez on Unsplash\n\nIn a historic move, Maryland Governor Wes Moore has officially declared March 9 as the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion Day, honoring the remarkable contributions of the predominantly Black, all-female battalion during World War II. This battalion played a crucial role in restoring the military postal system, ensuring effective communication between soldiers and civilians amidst the challenges of wartime. Their dedication and hard work have been recognized with various accolades, including a Congressional Medal of Honor and a monument in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Retired Col. Edna W. Cummings emphasized the significance of this recognition as a tribute to the service and sacrifice of thousands of Black women in the military, whose efforts have historically gone unrecognized. The initiative resonates with the ongoing need to acknowledge the achievements and challenges faced by Black women both in and outside the military. U.S. Representative Kweisi Mfume and Senator Cory McCray also highlighted the importance of commemorating the battalion's legacy, stressing its role in inspiring future generations and preserving vital history. As we approach the first official observance of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion Day in Maryland, it's essential to reflect on the broader implications of such recognitions for understanding and appreciating diverse contributions to our nation's history. How do business executives view the intersection of historical acknowledgment and diversity in leadership and organizational cultures? We invite your insights and reflections on the importance of recognizing and integrating diverse historical narratives within our professional and societal contexts. https://ow.ly/fmew50QLZFh\n\nOut of 500 corporations in the Fortune 500, there are only 6 African American CEOS. Nationwide, there are only 8% of C-Suite Executives that are African American. We are in need of more aggressive action by corporations to Recruit and Secure African American leadership. These facts are extremely relevant during African American history month! Moreover, one researcher has reported that African Americans are in the same state they were in financially at the time of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.‚Äôs assassination which was 52 years ago. Black athletes and entertainers are soaring financially but the vast majority of African Americans are equivalent to the financial status they were in 52 years ago. This means the net worth of Caucasians, Asians and Hispanics eclipse that of Black people. Between 2019 and 2022, the median net worth of African Americans was $44,000 while the median net worth of Whites skyrocketed to over $280,000. Nevertheless, what man can‚Äôt do, God can do and he will make a way for those who trust in Him. This has been the saving grace for Black people from time in memorial!\n\nToday, on Black History Day 19, we celebrate the achievements of the first African American President of the United States, Barack Obama. As the 44th President, he served two-terms from 2009 to 2017. President Obama's policy achievements included health care reform, economic stimulus, banking reform, and a repeal of the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell‚Äù policy. In 2009, he was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize. President Obama faced many challenges during his tenure, including the 2008 financial crisis, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the continuing global war on terrorism. Despite these challenges, he proposed unprecedented federal spending to revive the economy and renew America‚Äôs stature in the world. Black History is American AND World History. Let us remember and honor the achievements of President Obama on this President‚Äôs Day."
