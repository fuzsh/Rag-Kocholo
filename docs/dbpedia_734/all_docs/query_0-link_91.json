He himself perceived that, and was driven for the rest of his days to characterize, explain, rationalize, and defend that role. His memoirs reflect the fixation. In a long career totaling thirty-six years as an officer, and a string of postings to increasingly important assignments, the four years he commanded American forces in Vietnam, and the aftermath, constitute virtually the entirety of his account, all the rest a meager tenth.\n\nUnderstanding Westmoreland, a surprisingly complex man, is not easy. Fueled by ambition, driving himself relentlessly, of impressive military mien, energetic and effective at self-promotion, and skillful in cultivating influential sponsors, from his earliest days of service he led his contemporaries, was admired and advanced by his seniors, and progressed rapidly upward.\n\nBut Westmoreland also had an extraordinary capacity for polarizing the views of those who knew him—or at least those who encountered him, for not many would claim they really knew this distant and difficult man. Few remained indifferent. Among his admirers, an officer who worked directly for Westmoreland when he was Army Chief of Staff described him as the most gracious and gentlemanly person with whom I ever served. An officer who was his executive officer in Vietnam regarded Westmoreland as the only man he ever met to whom the term great could be applied.\n\nThere were others, though, many others, who had a darker view. Among the most prominent was General Harold K. Johnson, a man of surpassing decency and good will. I don't happen to be a fan of General Westmoreland's, said Johnson. I don't think I ever was, and I certainly didn't become one as a result of the Vietnam War or later during his tenure as Chief of Staff of the Army. Another officer, one who worked closely with Westmoreland in Vietnam, described him as awed by his own magnificence.\n\nWestmoreland's own frequent self-characterizations are revealing. I have been a person who has sought responsibility, he told an interviewer. I diligently tried to do a good job, not because I was bucking for anything higher, but because I was trying to do a job for the sake of doing a good job. That was my orientation. As a matter of fact, it was throughout my career. It was to do a job for the sake of doing a good job.¹\n\nWestmoreland took himself seriously, very seriously. There are few photographs of him smiling. Typically he is, instead, and very obviously, posing. While his description in The Howitzer, the West Point yearbook, credits him with a good sense of humor, he apparently lost or repressed it as he advanced in age and seniority. Jerry Warner, a teenager when he first met Westmoreland, for whom his father worked, suggested an explanation. Westmoreland, he observed, had a very keen humorous and affectionate side which he held in reserve and in confidence for his family and those he felt, by extension, were a part of it.\n\nThere were other changes over the years. He was an excellent commander at lower levels, Sergeant Major of the Army Leon Van Autreve said of him. And his people loved him. But I tell you, after that it was about a hundred and eighty. It's a peculiar thing that you can gain or lose so rapidly the affection of your people. Van Autreve recalled an occasion when Westmoreland as Army Chief of Staff had come to address a gathering of senior noncommissioned officers at Fort McNair in Washington. He was getting ready to go outside, said Van Autreve, and there is a cameraman out there. Now we're all ground pounders and dirt slingers. And this guy [Westmoreland] stands there, oblivious of all of us, and the aide takes his cape and drapes it over his arm and all this sort of thing. Then the aide looks at him and says, 'You're ready,' opens the door, and the flashbulbs start popping. That was the Westmoreland of later years.²\n\nFortunately the historical record of Westmoreland's life is extensive and rich, in part because from his early days he himself made extraordinary efforts to create and preserve it. What it reveals is a man devoted to his profession, and to his own rise in that profession, single-minded in his determination to accomplish the mission as he understands it, skillful in cultivating those who could be helpful to him, faithful in his marriage and loyal to his family, often perceptive in his choice of key associates, limited in his understanding of complex situations, entirely dependent on conventional solutions, and willing to shade or misremember or deny the record when his perceived interests were at risk.\n\nWestmoreland's strengths eventually propelled him to a level beyond his understanding and abilities. The results were tragic, not just for him but for the Army and the nation he served, and most of all of course for the South Vietnamese, who sacrificed all and lost all.\n\n1. Origins\n\nWILLIAM CHILDS WESTMORELAND was born on 26 March 1914 in the village of Saxon in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, the son of the textile mill manager James Ripley Westmoreland and his wife, Eugenia Childs Westmoreland. In later years Westmoreland recalled that he was born in the South during which time Robert E. Lee was on the same level as Jesus Christ. His ancestral roots extended back four generations within South Carolina.\n\nHis father was well connected politically in the state, his friends including James Byrnes and Strom Thurmond. In the family the son was called by his middle name, Childs, his mother's maiden name. His only sibling was a younger sister, Margaret. Westmoreland described his mother as extremely religious and his father as quite conservative, a man who didn't take too many chances. But his father, he recalled, influenced my life more than any other individual.¹\n\nLater Westmoreland's son-in-law would say of Westmoreland that he was raised very, very stiff. His father would turn his head away and let his son peck him on the cheek. Even so, he was clearly the favorite. Your Dad never thought women ever amounted to much in the social scale, a spinster friend of the family wrote to Westmoreland some years later. I think he's mellowed some with age, but he gave Margaret a hard time when she was growing up. For her part, Margaret affirmed that observation: My brother was my father's life. He was the perfect one. He could do no wrong.\n\nHis father, said Westmoreland, taught me the fundamentals of boxing and I learned to lead with a left, keep the opponent at a distance and take advantage of my right when there was an opening. Later, in Vietnam, Westmoreland would use a boxing analogy to describe his tactical approach to conduct of the war. Apparently he talked a better game than he took into the ring, however, for he never mentioned the summer at Camp Pinnacle in North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains when he was matched up against another camper named Harold Cohen. I landed a blow to his Adam's apple and knocked him cold, remembered Cohen. I thought I'd killed him.\n\nWestmoreland recalled that during his school days his favorite book was The Boy Scout Manual (Handbook for Boys). At fifteen he became an Eagle Scout in Troop 1, Spartanburg, the second member of that troop to attain the highest rank in Scouting. That same year he took part in the 1929 World Scout Jamboree at Arrowe Park in Birkenhead, England. There, fifty thousand Scouts from many different nations assembled for the Jamboree. Scouting was still a pretty new thing, having been established in England just twenty-one years earlier, and this was just the third World Jamboree. Scouts paraded before Sir Robert Baden-Powell, Scouting's founder, and the Prince of Wales and, as recorded by Westmoreland in his journal, heard a sermon by the Arch Bishop of Canelberry. Westmoreland recalled the fun they had exchanging items of uniform, buttons, and badges, and that he himself acquired a Scottish kilt, wearing it into Edinburgh after the Jamboree. They climbed the nearest mountain where, said Westmoreland, There was a swell wind up there and very cool with kilts on.\n\nAmong his fellow Scouts back in Spartanburg Westmoreland made some lifelong friends, particularly Conrad Cleveland, who years later would be best man at his wedding and then, long after that, an important figure in Westmoreland's South Carolina gubernatorial campaign.\n\nTroop I was sponsored by the Episcopal Church of the Advent in Spartanburg, where the Westmorelands also attended worship services. They would drive up on Sunday mornings in the family's old Franklin automobile, then take their customary seats on the right-hand aisle. According to a friend who also attended these services, Dr. W.H.K. Pendleton, the rector, always said that if the Westmorelands could be there on time, rain or shine, all the way from Pacolet, the rest of us could be too!\n\nWestmoreland graduated in 1931 from Spartanburg High School, where he was senior class president. Remembered one of his schoolmates, In spite of the Great Depression, we had a rather isolated, comfortable and secure world in which to grow up.\n\nYears after his retirement, Westmoreland was a speaker at the hundredth anniversary celebration of the small village where he had grown up. He recalled the challenging times the region had seen. The last mill had now closed, leaving something of a ghost town, and Westmoreland confided that he himself had also experienced hard times. My years away have been fraught with challenges, frustrations, and sadness, he said. As is frequently the case in life, some jobs have been thankless and some tasks without solution.\n\nAFTER HIGH SCHOOL Westmoreland spent a year at The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina, where his father had graduated in 1900 and was later for many years Chairman of the Board of Visitors. During this year there began a robust correspondence between Westmoreland and his father, who coached his son on many subjects, often including spelling. In one note he went out of his way to denigrate Margaret. She is doing very poorly at Ashley Hall and it is a source of great disappointment to us, he wrote. I am worried as to whether she can do and will not or simply can't do. It is a great source of satisfaction that we have no worry about you.\n\nWhile he was at The Citadel, an appointment to the United States Military Academy became available, and in 1932 he entered that institution, appointed by Senator James F. Byrnes (who had also been his Sunday School teacher).² When word came of Westmoreland's acceptance, his father wrote to him: You are all set now to make your entire life for yourself and it is up to you. He signed the letter Wawa, his children's pet name for their father.\n\nWestmoreland had wanted to go to the Naval Academy, but Byrnes counseled that the better choice for him would be West Point, which had a much broader, less technically oriented curriculum. Westmoreland reported his decision to leave The Citadel and go north to West Point to his Confederate great-uncle, who had fought in the Civil War: Uncle White, I'm going to the same damn school that Sherman and Grant attended. His uncle was reassuring: Never you mind, son, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson went there, too.³\n\nWestmoreland continued to receive encouraging letters from his father, including one dated 2 August 1932, perhaps a month after the son had entered the Military Academy: You do not know [how] happy it makes us all to know that you are making good. Even the small boys and the negroes are interested and proud of it.\n\nTaken altogether, these letters constitute a remarkable record of a father's affection and concern for his only son. When you need anything write me and I will send it to you. There is nothing too good for you. It was also clear that he was deeply missed. You may feel that you are a long way from home, wrote his father in one of the first letters sent to West Point. We feel that you are but we talk about you about half our time.\n\nAT WEST POINT Westmoreland underwent a second stringent plebe year, made even more difficult by a different kind of communication from home, endless letters of admonition from his father stressing that he simply had to pass the academic courses, since by now, in the depths of the depression and with his sister also nearing college age, the family could not afford to send him to school elsewhere. Be sure and send me your marks every week because I have a little book in which I keep them. I am also keeping your class standing in the same book, wrote his father.⁴\n\nSo incessant was this barrage that in one month alone, December of 1932, Westmoreland received twenty-six missives from his father, twice including two written on the same day. In one of these letters his father unhelpfully observed: English seems to be your weakest spot. No doubt this comes about from your lack of reading as you grew up. Clearly Westmoreland did not deserve this relentless pressure, as he consistently maintained a respectable academic record, standing 71 of 328 at the end of his first year. His overall class ranking dropped in each successive year, but at graduation he still stood 112 of 276 in general order of merit, helped by his top military rank but dragged down by economics and government, in which he stood near the bottom of the class.\n\nLATER WESTMORELAND TOLD an interviewer that as a cadet he never walked the area (a punishment for violations of regulations). He received only one major penalty, six demerits and twenty confinements during his yearling year for possession of an unauthorized radio. As for dating, he said, I was playing the field, so to speak. Little evidence of that remains to posterity. Wrote his first biographer, Ernest Furgurson: Westy was so busy with his duties that he did not bother to invite a date to the graduation hop.\n\nHe tried several varsity sports (not lettering in any), and was Superintendent of the Cadet Sunday School Teachers and vice president of his class.\n\nIn his final year at the Military Academy Westmoreland was named First Captain, the senior cadet in military rank—a high honor. His military bearing had undoubtedly been a factor in his selection. He stood five feet eleven inches tall, trim and ramrod straight, with a strong nose, prominent eyebrows, and jutting chin, his handsome countenance enhanced rather than marred by a long scar on the left side of his face, the result of going through the windshield of his father's car in a head-on collision when he was a youngster.\n\nThe First Captain at West Point is a genuine cadet celebrity, and properly so. Everyone in the Corps knows who he is, how he looks, what he does. Westmoreland made a fine impression on his classmates, even as a plebe being given the nickname Chief by a fellow plebe who viewed him (correctly, as it turned out) as a future Chief of Staff of the Army. It was Ted Clifton, himself later a major general and White House aide, who tagged Westmoreland with the nickname although, he later admitted, To be honest about it, I hardly knew what the Chief of Staff was in those days. What he did know, or believed, was that Westmoreland was destined for big things in the years ahead.\n\nApparently Clifton wasn't the only one who held that view. Brigadier General Sam Goodwin later wrote to Westmoreland, after both of them had retired from active duty, to say: Certainly you know that one of the legends you left at West Point in 1936, a legend repeated to the plebes who were admitted three weeks after you graduated [Goodwin's Class of 1940]: You as First Captain had announced that you would be the Chief of Staff of the Army.\n\nWestmoreland provided Advice from the First Captain for publication in Bugle Notes, the handbook of advice and information issued to all plebes. By keeping duty foremost in your mind at all times and on all occasions, he wrote, you can not fail to develop the most that is in yourself, and to serve West Point and your country in a manner of which you, the Corps, and your country will be justly proud.\n\nSurprisingly for a First Captain, in that senior year Westmoreland amassed a large number of demerits, forty-eight in all (more than he had accrued as a plebe), for such infractions as giving the command of execution on the wrong beat while marching and causing cadet officers and guidon bearers to march out of step by reason of poorly timed command of execution at parade. As a result, in his senior year he ranked eighty-second in the class in conduct.\n\nIf his mother is to be believed, Westmoreland somehow escaped punishment for yet another parade-related transgression. She was visiting West Point once, she recalled, when her son forgot his sword for a dress parade. But, she told an interviewer, her cadet son was able to maneuver so expertly while marching that no one noticed. This seemed highly unlikely, but hearsay evidence from Major General Clay Buckingham, Class of 1949, suggested its accuracy. One of the stories circulating about him [Westmoreland] back then, said Buckingham, was about the time when he, as First Captain, led the graduation parade for his class. Apparently in his rush to get ready, he had forgotten to put his sword in its sheath. Recognizing this only after he had gotten out on the Plain in front of thousands, he went through the entire ceremony making all the correct motions without his sword. No one in the audience noticed, but some of his classmates did notice and wouldn't let him forget it. Classmate Major General Gordon H. Austin later confirmed the accuracy of that account. He did not see the episode himself, he said, since he had been marching in one of the rear ranks, but later everyone talked about it.\n\nDespite such episodes, Westmoreland proved himself a fitting First Captain: dutiful, dedicated, capable if not brilliant, ambitious if not especially social, a father's pride, a model cadet leader. In West Point's yearbook Westmoreland's write-up was admiring: A fine soldier and true friend is Westy. Modest, generous, tolerant, and possessing a good sense of humor, Westy has made many friends. His executive ability, conscientiousness, high ideals, good judgment and common sense, and his fearless determination—just glance at that chin!—have well fitted him for the position he has held as leader of our class, and as First Captain of the Corps.\n\nIN WESTMORELAND'S CLASS was Benjamin O. Davis Jr., a black who would later become a high-ranking general officer. As a cadet he had been ostracized because of his race. A fellow officer later wrote to Westmoreland about this, saying, We and those senior to us in the military have much to be ashamed about in those early years of our service. Westmoreland responded that Davis was a victim of the times. This infuriated his correspondent, who shot back: That he was. But he was also the victim of individual acts of thoughtlessness, of cruelty, and of cowardice for which individuals ought to answer in this life, and for which, according to our Christian faith, they will assuredly have to answer later.⁵\n\nAnother graduate, bringing the matter much closer to home, wrote to Westmoreland about how Davis was inhumanely discriminated against throughout his cadet days with the silencing and its many peripheral consequences. In Davis's final year at West Point, he reminded Westmoreland, that discrimination was sustained under your leadership as first captain.... I therefore urge you most strongly to issue a public apology to General Davis on behalf of our Army and the United States Military Academy. Westmoreland called that officer and told him that his hands were tied, that the silence had been imposed on Davis and there was nothing he could do about it.⁶\n\nTHERE HAVE BEEN, over the years, a few West Point classes that stand out from the rest. Preeminent was 1915, the class of Eisenhower, Bradley, and other luminaries, with nearly 35 percent of the class becoming general officers. The Class of 1933 (which led the Corps during Westmoreland's plebe year) achieved over 24 percent generals. And Westmoreland's Class of 1936 also turned out to be one of West Point's most distinguished. It produced six four-star generals, seven three-stars, and sixty generals in all, representing nearly 22 percent of the class. Over 92 percent of the class served to retirement (or died while on active duty), a remarkable example of duty performed. For such records to be achieved, of course, the times had to be right—a big war coming up soon after graduation, with fast early promotions, combat experience, professional reputations established early on—and then, also very important, the ability to adjust to peacetime service until the next war came along.⁷\n\nOn Friday, 12 June, the Class of 1936—276 strong—graduated and was commissioned. General of the Armies John J. Pershing presented the graduation address. Westmoreland, who on behalf of his class had petitioned the Superintendent to invite Pershing as the speaker, was somewhat disappointed in the outcome, later describing Pershing as an elderly man whose address was not delivered with any fire or enthusiasm. But at least Pershing had said, gratifyingly, that the Corps marched well.\n\n2. Early Service\n\nCOMMISSIONED IN THE Field Artillery branch, Westmoreland was sent to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where he joined the 18th Field Artillery and gained the usual junior officer experience. He was motivated to pursue a military career, he would tell a later correspondent, by a desire to serve my country and to break out of a parochial environment. In this first assignment he found that the officers were some good, most mediocre and the soldiers could barely read or write. On the positive side were good horses and mules and one motor vehicle, although the weapons were antiquated. Those weapons were French 75mm guns, Model 1897, horse-drawn. For communications they still had carrier pigeons and the telegraph using Morse code. Meanwhile Hitler's planes and tanks were just a few years away from invading Germany's neighbors.\n\nClassmate Bruce Palmer remembered some positive things about those early days: We had a taste of the Old Army, a small, tightly knit band that had survived despite public neglect and non-recognition, and whose older officers and NCOs taught us a lot about what being a professional soldier was all about.¹ Westmoreland's recollections were more negative, describing that Army as backward and lacking in money, weapons, and public support.\n\nWestmoreland's first battery commander was a senior captain, nicknamed The Stud Duck, who was described by Westmoreland as virtually incompetent. Allegedly he had failed the basic course at the Artillery School, although how he could have survived that and later advanced to captain is unclear. Things were held together in the battery by 1st Sergeant Bull McCullugh, a boxing champ who could lick anyone in the outfit.\n\nAfter a few months on the job Westmoreland wrote to his father dutifully, I'm working quite hard at present. He cited some of the duties he had been assigned, including stable officer (with thirty-eight horses to supervise). Like most young officers, he was also learning polo, lots of fun, but plenty of hard work. Nonetheless, he wrote, Each afternoon, I am free to do as I like.\n\nAT FORT SILL Westmoreland met a pretty and accomplished young horsewoman, Katherine Van Deusen, known as Kitsy, the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Edwin Van Deusen, then Executive Officer of the Field Artillery School. I took one look at him, and I've followed him ever since, she later said.² Kitsy was then all of nine years old, but she asked Westmoreland (almost thirteen years older) to wait for her until she grew up.³ He did (after, during his service in Hawaii, a woman he wanted to wed married another officer instead).⁴\n\nWestmoreland also became Scoutmaster of Fort Sill's Boy Scout Troop 37, and evidently a good one. In later years he often heard from youngsters, many of whom had become officers themselves, who remembered him fondly from those earlier days, and some even served under his command in various outfits. Among the Scouts in his troop was Edwin Van Deusen, Kitsy's older brother.\n\nIN THOSE DAYS mounted officers (including horse artillery, not just the cavalry) could acquire private mounts in addition to their issue horses, but only with permission. Westmoreland accordingly asked to be allowed to purchase a mount from the Army Depot at Fort Reno, Oklahoma. That request was approved, and he acquired a three-quarter thoroughbred three-year-old mare named Polly Ann, a bay with black legs below the knees.\n\nWestmoreland recalled that in those days our daily lives were built around the horse—fox hunts, polo, horse shows. This led to his first brush with Army aristocracy, as Lieutenant Colonel George'S. Patton, accompanied by Mrs. Patton, came down from Fort Riley to serve as judge at a horse show. Westmoreland was assigned as his recorder. As he judged, recalled Westmoreland, I kept track of his comments and gave him a summary of his evaluation. Westmoreland was suitably impressed, concluding that Patton knew his horses and how they should be rode.\n\nA slightly more senior officer in the regiment with Westmoreland was Camden McConnell, USMA Class of 1931, who remembered a horse adventure that did not turn out so well for Westmoreland. One duty was to take the school horses to summer pasture. Since horses are well known for their skittishness, the technique was to take a large number of soldiers and only a few horses to establish the camp. Then, when the first contingent of horses had settled in, a few more horses would be added, then a few more, and so on. Eventually the entire herd would be in residence and pretty calm about the whole change of venue. On one occasion when McConnell and Westmoreland were accomplishing this somewhat tricky maneuver, however, McConnell had to leave temporarily to take care of some business elsewhere. That left Westmoreland in charge, with the result that the herd soon stampeded across the main post with the loss of many horses and destroying the golf course. Fortunately the resulting investigation found —naturally, said McConnell—no fault on Westmoreland's part because that's just how horses are.⁵\n\nWhen Westmoreland was a cadet his father had written to him suggesting that after he graduated, if the Democrats won, You should have some pull in your advancement in the Army through Jim Byrnes and [John] McSwain, a senator and house member respectively. Almost right away Westmoreland sought to take advantage of some of that political capital, asking to be designated a diplomatic courier and sending that request not through military channels but via Congressman G. Heyward Mahon Jr. When the matter reached the Adjutant General he was not impressed, responding in January 1937 that the assignment desired by Lieutenant Westmoreland is one requiring considerable maturity and experience, whereas Lieutenant Westmoreland, having been graduated from the United States Military Academy last June, has less than one year's commissioned service. Not approved.⁶\n\nAfter three years at Fort Sill Westmoreland was ordered to Hawaii. He accordingly requested authority to ship his private mount, and in due course Polly Ann was assigned passage aboard the U.S. Army Transport Meigs. A private named Jerry Reel was put on orders as her attendant for the voyage, while Westmoreland traveled separately aboard another Army Transport, the Grant.\n\nIN HAWAII WESTMORELAND found the troops, and duties, much like those at Fort Sill. The artillery was armed with British three-inch guns, and the division was more interested in unit athletics than training. We went through the motions of training and had athletics and fatigue (police) in the afternoon. Westmoreland gained battery command experience, leading Battery F of the 8th Field Artillery. Then, though a mere first lieutenant assigned as a battalion operations officer, Westmoreland told his father that he ran a battalion for all intents and purpose[s], since a lieutenant colonel was in command who had little to offer.⁷\n\nThere was still plenty of old Army. Westmoreland was invited to act as Honorary Whipper-In on the staff of the Artillery Hunt. Besides serving at the Hunts, he was told, he would assist at hound exercise. Westmoreland also reported in a letter to his mother a terrible thing—his horse died very suddenly, apparently the result of an abdominal obstruction. Very unfortunate for me, Westmoreland observed somewhat coldly, especially since I had no insurance on her.\n\nIn Hawaii Westmoreland received what turned out to be his only formal Army instruction (except for post–World War II attendance at parachute school), acquiring a certificate of proficiency testifying to his successful completion of a special one-month course in mess management conducted by the Quartermaster Corps School for Bakers and Cooks.⁸ Surprisingly, Westmoreland later seemed rather proud that he had missed the usual professional development opportunities at the Command & General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth and the Army War College.\n\nEARLY IN 1941, after two years in the islands, Westmoreland left Hawaii for a new assignment with the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. There, he recalled, Amazing things began to happen to our Army. One of the most significant was that a military draft brought into the ranks what Westmoreland described as a cross-section of the young men from our society—good men, quite a contrast to his view of the troops he had been working with.\n\nBut Fort Bragg was just a prelude, as by then the Wehrmacht had begun its rampages across Europe and everyone in the Army expected that the United States would eventually join the war—even if the American public opposed that idea right up until the 7 December 1941 Japanese attacks at Pearl Harbor.\n\n3. World War II\n\nTHE ARMY MOBILIZED immediately upon news of the Japanese attack, and within days Germany had also declared war. It would take one more year for Westmoreland to enter the fight. At the age of twenty-eight he found himself in command of the 34th Field Artillery Battalion of the 9th Infantry Division. In North Africa Westmoreland's 155mm towed howitzers caught up with earlier deploying elements when they arrived in Casablanca on Christmas Eve of 1942.\n\nWestmoreland took an unsuspected chance in evading orders upon arrival. He had been designated commander of troops aboard ship during the voyage. When they reached port, he was summoned by General Patton's chief of staff and told to get the troops ashore immediately. Westmoreland urged a delay in disembarking so the New Year's dinner could be enjoyed, but to no avail, he later recalled. So he went back and gave the order to leave the ship, but designated his own battalion to stay aboard and police up the ship after enjoying the prepared feast. Only later did he learn that the reason for the order to disembark immediately was that German bombers were reportedly on the way to strike the docking facilities at Casablanca.¹\n\nThe 34th Field Artillery remained in Casablanca until 17 January 1943 before departing for Port Lyautey and then, with various intermediary stops, finally entered battle on 22 February. Recalled Westmoreland, they were in almost continuous operation against the enemy until 10 May 1943. He would later speak of World War II, where \"there was some very severe fighting, on a sustained basis, contrary to Korea, and contrary to Vietnam, where fighting was sporadic and not sustained.\"\n\nGeneral Patton had inspected Westmoreland's battalion while they were at Casablanca. As he was going through one of the battery messes he noted how they were using immersion heaters (designed for heating dishwater) to heat C-Rations in the can. General Patton had never seen this before, said Westmoreland, and was profuse in congratulating the mess sergeant on his initiative. The mess sergeant's chest was so puffed up that he was rather unbearable to his colleagues for weeks thereafter.\n\nAnother Patton visit made quite an impression on Westmoreland and, very obviously, on some of the 9th Infantry Division's staff. One day, Westmoreland said, General Patton arrived at the command post with his pearl-handled [actually ivory] revolvers, riding boots, pink breeches, and shining helmet, looking like a military fashion plate. The division commander, Major General Manton Eddy, greeted Patton, with the staff following behind. Patton's first words were, Manton, I'm getting goddamn sick and tired of the lack of progress this division is making. I want you to get off your ass and start moving. Then, pointing to the staff, Patton continued, And I want you to get these bastards out to the front lines and get them killed. Well, said Westmoreland, those words had a sobering effect on the division staff. That evening they hauled the G-1, the personnel staff officer, out on a stretcher as a psycho case and he never returned.²\n\nWestmoreland and his troops were also exposed to a version of the notorious Patton speech, the one made famous by George C. Scott in the movie Patton, describing what he saw ahead and what he expected in training and attitudes. Men, said Patton, all this stuff you've heard about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of horse dung. Americans, traditionally, love to fight. Westmoreland said the film well represented the original except that Patton delivered it in a high, squeaky voice. It was nevertheless effective. Patton was erect and always immaculately dressed, said Westmoreland. His language was abrupt, profane, and gory. He got and kept the attention of his troops, and he and his speech became matters of constant conversation and discussion for weeks thereafter.\n\nALTHOUGH HE EVENTUALLY served in three wars, Westmoreland was never decorated for valor. He had a fine hour, though, in leading the 34th Field Artillery Battalion during fighting in Tunisia, where they earned great distinction.\n\nIn February 1943 the unit encountered and dealt brilliantly with a challenging combat situation. Over a period of four days the entire battalion made a forced march of 735 miles from Tlemcen, Algeria, over the Atlas Mountains to Thala, Tunisia. The move began in a snowstorm, proceeding in bitter weather over tortuous and almost impassable mountain roads, and ended a hundred hours later when the troops went immediately into battle against elements of the German Afrika Corps, helping to stop the enemy's breakthrough at Kasserine Pass. That feat resulted in the Presidential Unit Citation for the battalion, a high honor in recognition of valorous service. The citation noted that, although enemy forces were entrenched only 2,500 yards distant and there were only three platoons of friendly infantry in front of the artillery, the unit maintained constant and steady fire with such deadly effect that enemy tank units were dispersed and driven back.\n\nWestmoreland himself received a highly commendatory letter from Brigadier General'S. Leroy Red Irwin, at that time commanding general of the 9th Division artillery. Your handling your battalion during the march, he wrote, and during the action at Thala, was a splendid example of leadership, and was characterized by personal initiative, courage and coolness under very adverse conditions. You are commended for a superior performance of duty.\n\nWHEN THE FIGHTING moved to Sicily, Westmoreland made an opportunity for himself and his unit that was later to pay personal dividends. The 82nd Airborne Division was then assembling in southern Sicily, and Westmoreland (apparently entirely on his own initiative) went to the division command post to see what was going on. A meeting was under way at which Major General Matthew Ridgway, then the division commander, and Brigadier General Maxwell Taylor, the division artillery commander, were discussing future operations. As Westmoreland later explained: Upon learning that the division was short of transportation, I spoke up, identified myself as an outsider, and stated that I had an excellent artillery battalion that could give medium artillery support to the division as it moved and at the same time provide a large number of trucks to assist the lightly equipped parachute division.\n\nAccording to his account, a call was made to the corps commander, who approved a request that Westmoreland's battalion be attached to the 82nd Airborne Division. Nothing is said concerning how the losing division commander felt about this freelancing on Westmoreland's part, but it was the beginning of a long and close relationship between Westmoreland and Taylor, who rose to far greater prominence and became Westmoreland's principal mentor and patron.³\n\nWestmoreland remembered the next few weeks as a fast-moving situation. The motto of the 34th Field Artillery was We Support, and they were living up to it. The battalion's trucks were being used around the clock. Often at the front of the column, Westmoreland recalled, would be General Ridgway, General Taylor, and Lieutenant Colonel Westmoreland. When resistance was encountered, Westmoreland contacted his executive officer and had him move the guns forward as fast as possible. Westmoreland would station guides on the road to lead the guns into position, then go to the nearest high ground to establish an observation post, determine the location of the friendly infantry elements, and proceed to adjust the fire of the battalion as soon as the first gun could drop trails.\n\nOn one occasion after I had done this, said Westmoreland, General Taylor was surprised to find me on the top of a hill overlooking the enemy's position, and he asked me what I was doing there. Westmoreland responded that his battalion was in the process of moving into position, that he had just finished adjusting its fire, and that they were ready to attack any target. He proudly remembered Taylor's comment as he departed the position: Westmoreland, that was a workman-like job.⁴\n\nIn Sicily Westmoreland's jeep hit a mine. The vehicle was destroyed, but only one of the four occupants was injured, and that man only slightly. Westmoreland said that sandbagging the vehicle had saved its occupants from more serious effects. He himself was blown free, shaken up but not wounded. According to subsequent accounts by Westmoreland, that was but one of a number of near misses. Earlier, in Tunisia, a shell hit my vehicle but without harm to me, he recalled. Later, on the Roer River in Germany, just as I got out of my jeep and entered a company command post, a mortar shell struck my vehicle. In the Remagen bridgehead on the Rhine a shell demolished a latrine moments after I had departed.\n\nAs the fighting progressed on Sicily, with the 34th Field having rejoined its parent unit, the 9th Division was pinched out by the 3rd Division on the north and the British on the south. The 34th Field had by then fired 4,393 rounds, including 901 on a single day during forty-three fire missions at Cerami on 4 August. While there the unit was taking very heavy incoming fire from artillery and Nebelwerfers (mortars) firing high explosive shells. The only solution was to dig in, and keep digging in, for five days. Moving through his B Battery position one day, Westmoreland heard a chief of section say to one of his cannoneers: Jones, if you dig that slit trench two inches deeper, I'll try you for desertion!\n\nThen came a well-deserved respite. Rhapsodized the division historian: These were days of vino, marsala, and vermouth; of grapes and melons and almonds; of gaily-painted donkey carts and swims in the blue Tyrrhenian Sea; of visits to Palermo and Monreale and the dark catacombs.⁵\n\nDURING MUCH OF his battalion command time Westmoreland's executive officer was a major named Otto Kerner. They got along well and stayed in touch in later years. Kerner remembered that in the battalion Westmoreland's officers and men referred to him as Superman and that it was deserved, a title that he earned by his deeds and capacity for deeds. Kerner was from Illinois and would later become governor of that state and then a federal judge.\n\nWestmoreland frequently exhibited a measure of disdain for book learning, an outlook he recalled in an oral history interview after his retirement. I had never been to a school and I didn't know the doctrine except what I read in the field manual, and I wasn't too impressed with it, he maintained. I figured I could do better and worked up some SOPs for maneuvering the battalion, controlling fire and some firing techniques. His interviewers, eager to learn more about those fundamental doctrinal differences, asked Westmoreland to describe them. Well, I'd have to reflect back, he responded. I think I might come forth with them, but it's pretty tough to do off the top of my head.⁶\n\nYears later Westmoreland would say that, if he could cite one thing that had contributed to any success that I may have had as a commander, it was that as a young officer I developed a keen appreciation of communications. As a battalion commander, I used to talk to my battalion as a group about once a month. I used to talk to the batteries and the gun squads individually, and brief them—even in combat—on the situation. I was constantly talking to my troops.\n\nWestmoreland took away some enduring lessons from his command experience, including a conviction that the important determinants of troop morale were food, mail, and medical care. These were the things that I derived from my World War II experience to which I gave consideration, he recalled. Actually, I had them written on a slip of paper which I kept in my wallet.⁷"
