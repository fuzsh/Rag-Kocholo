It’s a loaded day of action including Beacon’s birthday celebration, a “Men’s Basketball Kickoff” open practice at the Athletics-Recreation Center with doors opening at 10 a.m. and the practice running from 10:30-11:30 a.m. and the football game against the Eagles. The Community Tailgate Lot near Brown Field will open early with a 9:30 a.m. start time. Plus, the All-Star Stunt Dogs will have a “pawtastic” display of pure fun as part of a halftime show that fans won’t want to miss.\n\nPreviously: After facing a 17-0 deficit as late as the fourth quarter, Valpo rallied and was in the game up until the clock showed all zeros in a 20-14 road setback to Drake in Des Moines, Iowa, thwarting the team’s hopes for a third straight road win in Des Moines. Veteran quarterback Jeffrey Jackson came off the bench and threw a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown passes, a 33 yarder to Solomon Davis to get Valpo on the board and a 15 yarder to Moise Tezzo to trim the lead to six with 1:50 on the clock. Valpo had the ball at midfield and a chance for a Hail Mary in the closing seconds, but couldn’t get the pass off and the game came to an end after a series of laterals. The Valpo defense contained Drake to just 46 rushing yards with Sam Hafner putting together a six-tackle showing including four solos to go along with a tackle for loss and fumble recovery.\n\nSeries Notes: Valpo will look to make it back-to-back wins over Morehead State for the first time in program history after going to Kentucky and outdoing the Eagles 40-35 behind a 241-yard rushing performance from Aaron Dawson on a day where the offense compiled 574 total yards. That marked the team’s first win at Morehead State since 2006. The Eagles own a 23-5 edge in the all-time series. This year marks the 20-year anniversary of the most notable Valpo/Morehead State matchup, a 54-42 Valpo victory at Brown Field in the 2003 PFL Championship Game. Four of the last five collisions between these two foes have been decided by seven points or fewer.\n\nFollowing the Beacons: Saturday’s game will air on ESPN+ with legendary Valpo voice Todd Ickow (play-by-play) and Valpo Athletics Hall of Famer Tom Byrne (analyst) on the call. In addition, the radio commentary will be available on 95.1 FM WVUR, The TuneIn Radio App and ValpoAthletics.com. For in-game updates, follow @valpoufootball on Twitter. Links to live video, audio and stats will be available on ValpoAthletics.com.\n\nHead Coach Landon Fox: Landon Fox (15-31) is in his fifth season as the head coach of the Valparaiso University football program in 2023. Over the last three seasons, Fox has led Valpo to 12 Pioneer Football League victories, the most in a three-year period in program history. The program finished with a PFL record of .500 or better for a third consecutive season in 2022, the first time that has occurred since 1998-2000. Prior to that, Valpo had not had a stretch of three straight years with a league record of .500 or better since 1961-1964. The program won four PFL games in the same season just once in the 26 seasons prior to Fox’s arrival. Now, the program has reached that threshold in three straight seasons and three of the first four years under his direction (Spring 2021, Fall 2021, 2022). During his four years in charge of the program, Valpo has boasted 43 All-PFL honorees and 22 academic all-PFL selections. During his second season at the helm in Spring 2021, Fox was a finalist for the Eddie Robinson Award – which is presented annually to the FCS National Coach of the Year – after guiding Valpo to its best winning percentage since 2003 and tying for the squad’s best winning percentage since 1999. He led his team to Pioneer Football League runner-up honors, the program’s highest finish in the league standings since the PFL championship season of 2003. Fox’s defensive roots paid dividends on that side of the football in his second year at the helm, as the team enjoyed its best defensive season in four decades. Valpo held opponents to 283.3 yards per game, the program’s best total defense in the last 40 years. In Year 1 of the Fox Era in 2019, Valpo ranked in the Top 5 in the PFL in scoring defense (32.0, fifth), total defense (381.6, fourth), rushing defense (184.2, fourth) and passing defense (197.3, fifth). After spending the previous 11 seasons as the defensive coordinator and secondary coach at the University of Dayton, Fox was named the head football coach at Valpo prior to the 2019 season. He helped the Flyers finish with 10 winning seasons in his 11 years on staff and guided a defensive backfield that produced one All-American, four Academic All-Americans, two PFL Special Teams Players of the Year and three corners who were invited to NFL Rookie Minicamp. Prior to joining Dayton’s staff, Fox served as the linebackers coach and special teams coordinator at Wayne State University in Detroit from 2005-2007. He also spent time as a defensive graduate assistant at Ball State University (2004), Dayton (2002-2003) and Lakeland College (2001). Fox began his coaching career as an assistant varsity coach at Preble Shawnee High School in Camden, Ohio during the 2000 season. During his playing days, Fox was a team captain and all-conference performer at Defiance College in Defiance, Ohio from 1995-1999 and graduated with a degree in physical education and health in May 2000 before earning his master’s degree in education from Lakeland in May 2002.\n\nDefense Dominating\n\nThe Week 6 game at Drake saw Valpo contain the Bulldogs to just 46 rushing yards on 24 attempts and the hosts did not have a single first down gained on a running play. This was Valpo’s best performance in terms of rushing defense since holding Marist to 36 yards on Nov. 12 of last season.\n\nThe aforementioned Nov. 12, 2022 game in upstate New York represented the fewest rushing yards permitting by the Beacons in a Pioneer Football League outing in over 20 years. On Sept. 3, 2022, Valpo held Indiana Wesleyan to just 25 rushing yards.\n\nThe Valpo defense has allowed 20 points or fewer in each of the last two games. This marks the first time the Brown & Gold have held the opposition to 20 points or fewer in consecutive contests since the first two games of the Spring 2021 season (W 24-14 at Butler, L 17-6 vs. Drake). Prior to that, it was 2014 (W 55-7 vs. Missouri Baptist; L 17-9 vs. Drake).\n\nSince allowing 471 yards to full-scholarship FCS foe Youngstown State on Aug. 31, Valpo has held the opposition under 330 yards of total offense in each of the last four contests. This is the program’s longest streak of consecutive games allowing 330 or fewer yards of total offense since 2007, when the Brown & Gold started the season with games against Saint Francis (Ill.), Trinity International, Kalamazoo and Marian.\n\nIowa Insights\n\nValpo’s hopes of a three-game winning streak in games played in Des Moines were dashed with the 20-14 loss at Drake on Oct. 7. However, it’s still worth noting the team’s competitive play for a third straight trip to Iowa.\n\nThis marked the third straight venture to Des Moines that resulted in a one-score game. Valpo defeated Drake 10-7 on April 3, 2021 and won 24-21 on Sept. 25, 2021. Prior to the calendar year 2021, Valpo was 0-13 all-time at Drake.\n\nPrior to this stretch of three straight cliffhangers in Des Moines, the 13 all-time visits were Drake victories that were decided by an average of 25.6 points per game. Before the recent stretch, the closet Valpo had ever come to beating Drake on the road was a 13-point loss at Drake in 2013.\n\nA win at Drake would have marked just the second time since the Pioneer Football League was founded that Valpo had three straight road victories over a specific PFL foe. The only time that occurred was at Butler in the late 1990s. Valpo will have a chance to replicate its three-game road winning streak at Butler on Oct. 28 of this season.\n\nAmong PFL and National Leaders\n\nValpo leads the PFL in total defense, yielding just 315.8 yards per game. That helps the Beacons rank 22nd nationally in that category.\n\nValpo’s rushing defense ranks second in the PFL and 24th in FCS as the Beacons are allowing just 110.6 yards per game on the ground.\n\nValpo leads the PFL and ranks 11th nationally in kickoff return average at 25.08 yards per return.\n\nValpo has allowed just 78 total first downs this season, leading the league and ranking seventh nationally in first-down defense.\n\nJashon Butler leads the team and ranks fifth nationally in combined kickoff return yards at 402. He is averaging 33.5 yards per kickoff return, first in the PFL and fourth in FCS.\n\nTyler Geiman ranks second nationally in passes defended at 2.0 per game.\n\nEvan Matthes leads the PFL and ranks 11th in the nation in punting average at 44.5.\n\nSolomon Davis has four receiving touchdowns, tied for the PFL lead.\n\nDown to the Wire\n\nIn Landon Fox’s 46 games as Valpo head coach, 22 (47.8 percent) have been decided by seven points or fewer, most recently a 20-14 loss at Drake on Oct. 7 of this season.\n\nValpo is 8-14 in those one-score games. Since Fox took over the program, 63 percent of the team’s games have been either victories or defeats by seven points or fewer.\n\nJust five games into his fifth season and with one of those first four seasons being shortened to six games, Fox has already coached more one-score games at Valpo than the program’s previous two head coaches – Dave Cecchini (13 in five full seasons) and Dale Carlson (six in four seasons) – combined.\n\nIn 46 games under Fox, Valpo has played more one-score games than it did in 110 games from 2007-2018.\n\nThe Week 6 game at Drake was Valpo’s fourth straight game decided by fewer than seven points.\n\nThis is the first time Valpo has played four straight games decided by fewer than seven points since the final four games of the Spring 2021 season – vs. Butler, at Drake, at Morehead State and vs. San Diego.\n\nIf Valpo plays another one-score game on Saturday vs. Morehead State, it would mark the first time the program has had a streak of five or more one-score games consecutively since six straight in 2003 – at Jacksonville, vs. Morehead State, at Dayton, vs. San Diego, vs. Drake and at Butler.\n\nSince the start of last season, six of the eight games played at Brown Field have been one-score affairs, so the home fans have been treated to no shortage of thrilling football.\n\nThe one-point win over Southwest Minnesota State in Week 5 was Valpo’s first such victory since edging San Diego 20-19 in the final game of the Spring 2021 campaign. Valpo is now 2-1 under Fox in game’s decided by a single point, with the loss coming 26-25 vs. Butler on Oct. 15 of last season.\n\nAdditional Notes Wrapping Up Oct. 7: Drake 20, Valpo 14\n\nMoise Tezzo had the first receiving touchdown of his Valpo career. He had a team-high four catches for 40 yards.\n\nJeffrey Jackson went 5-of-14 through the air for two touchdowns. Michael Appel Jr. was 11-of-25 for 78 yards before departing due to an injury.\n\nIt was a balanced day from the receiving corps, as 10 different Beacons caught passes. In addition, seven different players had carries, led by freshman Brian Thomas with nine for 37 yards.\n\nDavis had his fourth receiving touchdown of the season and the eighth of his career, all in the last two seasons. He has hauled in three catches for 33 yards.\n\nSam Hafner paced the team with six tackles while also notching a fumble recovery, his second of the season.\n\nAmar Elmore recorded the second forced fumble of his collegiate career.\n\nEvan Matthes booted eight kicks for an average of 39.8 yards per try, pinning four inside the 20 including a long of 65.\n\nScouting the Eagles\n\nPicked to finish 10th of 11 in the PFL preseason poll.\n\nComing off a convincing 31-7 win over Dayton, a game in which the Eagles created five turnovers after creating only one defensive takeaway over the season’s first four games.\n\nPrior to downing Dayton, Morehead State had dropped a pair of one-score games in league play against preseason favorite St. Thomas (35-28) and Drake (16-9).\n\nUnder the direction of longtime head coach Rob Tenyer, who is in the 11th year of his tenure.\n\nCarter Cravens was named PFL Offensive Player of the Week after passing for two touchdowns and running for another in the win over Dayton. Keenan Wolf was tabbed PFL Defensive Player of the Week after notching 15 tackles against the Flyers.\n\nBlock Party\n\nValpo has blocked three kicks so far this season, one of 16 teams nationally in FCS with three or more blocked kicks. The most recent block came in Week 5 vs. Southwest Minnesota State, when freshman Max Samuel blocked a punt.\n\nAs a team, that was Valpo’s third blocked kick of the season as Wade Abrams turned away a punt in Week 2 at Indiana Wesleyan and Kurt Kessen blocked Marist’s potential go-ahead PAT after their game-tying score in the closing seconds of regulation to send the Week 4 game to overtime.\n\nDuring the Fall 2021 season, Valpo led the nation in blocked kicks with nine.\n\nComeback Kids\n\nValpo rallied from down 15-0 to win 16-15 in Week 5 vs. Southwest Minnesota State. This marked the third time Valpo has come from double figures down to win during the Landon Fox Era, joining Sept. 24, 2022 vs. San Diego (trailed 14-0, won 28-21) and March 27, 2021 vs. Butler (trailed 17-7, won 28-25).\n\nThe 15-point comeback was Valpo’s largest of the Landon Fox Era. The last time Valpo erased that wide of a margin to prevail was nearly a decade ago on Sept. 20, 2014 at William Jewell, when the team was down 22-7 and pulled out a 39-30 victory.\n\nAnother memorable rally came on April 10, 2021, when Valpo fell behind Morehead State 21-0 before coming back to tie the game, but the Eagles pulled out a 28-24 win. Had Valpo completed that comeback, it would have been the program’s biggest rally since 1995, overcoming a 22-0 deficit to win 41-30 at St. Xavier.\n\nAdditional Notes Wrapping Up Sept. 30: Valpo 16, SMSU 15\n\nA testament to the play of the defense, the 16 points were the fewest Valpo had scored in a win since beating Drake 10-7 on April 3, 2021.\n\nJashon Butler totaled 121 yards on two kick returns, averaging 60.5 yards per return with a long of 61.\n\nSolomon Davis made three catches for 31 yards, while Brandon Jimenez had two for 29 including his first career score.\n\nMichael Appel Jr.’s 35-yard touchdown run was his longest career rushing play, outdoing his previous career long of 13 by 22 yards. That marked his fourth career rushing score and second of the season.\n\nFreshman Brian Thomas had a team-high 34 rushing yards on eight carries.\n\nRyan Hawk hit from 40 yards out to improve to 2-for-2 on field goal tries in his collegiate career, both this season.\n\nEvan Matthes averaged 45.8 yards per punt on six attempts with a long of 53.\n\nA Big Day for Davis\n\nSolomon Davis had 10 receptions for 175 yards and two touchdowns in the Week 4 game vs. Marist, posting career highs in all three areas.\n\nDavis became the first Valpo player with 10 receptions in a game since Tanner Kuramata on Nov. 22, 2014 vs. Davidson.\n\nDavis had the most receiving yards by a Valpo player since Kuramata’s 200 on Nov. 16, 2013 vs. Dayton.\n\nDavis became just the third player in the FCS nation with 175 or more receiving yards in a game this season, joining New Hampshire’s Dylan Laube (295) and UIW’s Brandon Porter (201).\n\nCaptain Corner: Valpo has four team captains for the 2023 campaign – redshirt senior linebacker Evan Annis, senior offensive lineman Tyler Eberhert, redshirt junior defensive lineman Sam Hafner and redshirt senior wide receiver Solomon Davis. Annis is a captain for the third straight season, while the others hold the distinction for the first time this year.\n\nPreseason Picks\n\nValpo was picked sixth of 11 in the preseason poll.\n\nWR Solomon Davis and TE Evan Jernegan were recognized with Preseason All-PFL honors.\n\nEvan Matthes was named to the FCS Punter of the Year Award Watch List.\n\nSix Valpo players earned Phil Steele First All-PFL honors – WR Solomon Davis on the first team; TE Evan Jernegan, DL Sam Hafner, DL Kevin Spelman and P Evan Matthes on the second team and LB Evan Annis along with Spelman (as a long snapper) on the third team.\n\n2022 Valpo Football Feats\n\nWinning on the road is never easy, but Valpo finished out a successful season in terms of Pioneer Football League games away from Brown Field with the 45-24 win at Marist in Week 11. The team finished 3-1 in league road games, the first time Valpo has won three PFL road games in the same season since the league was founded in 1993.\n\nIn addition, 2022 marks the first time Valpo has won three league road games in the same season since 1962.\n\nValpo finished with a PFL record of .500 or better for a third consecutive season. This is the program’s first such stretch since 1998-2000. Prior to that, Valpo had not had a league record of .500 or better in three straight years since doing so in four straight seasons from 1961-1964.\n\nThe program has won four PFL games in the same season for the third straight year and just the fourth time ever. Prior to the Spring 2021 season, Valpo had won four league games in a season just once since 1968, with the one instance coming in 2017.\n\nTo put the last note in further perspective, Valpo had won four Pioneer Football League games once in 26 seasons prior to Fox’s arrival. Now, the program has reached that threshold for league wins in three of his first four seasons. (Although, in fairness, the program played only four to five league games per year in each of its first 13 PFL seasons.)\n\nFox’s team achieved yet another program first with the Week 11 win at Marist. That marked the program’s first-ever win in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
