        "text": "Staying Connected and Vigilant as A NOMA Community\n\n2024 JULY\n\nAs NOMA leadership, we continue to work on behalf of members in support of the path to licensure, and increasing NOMA’s visibility of our issues with our alliance partners and design organizations. We are holding fast and representing our membership needs at industry events, providing NOMA access and a voice in spaces where we previously were not.\n\nThe White House, July 18\n\nThe culmination of our leadership work was to advocate for and secure a meeting at The White House on July 18. NOMA leadership previously visited the White House on February 26, 2014 for the “Closing the Gap: Opportunities to Expand Minority Achievement and Participation in Science, Technology, Engineering And Mathematics (STEM)” workshop. We viewed this visit as a reactivation and revitalization of a relationship between NOMA and the White House. NOMA Executive Director Tiffany Brown, Immediate Past President Jason Pugh, Past President Kathy Dixon and myself met with the White House’s Steven K. Benjamin, Assistant to the President, Senior Advisor to the President and Director of Public Engagement and Karine Jean-Pierre, White House Press Secretary. We asked for continued partnership and support, as we look for meaningful engagement with national leadership on behalf of our members. We outlined five next steps and all parties will be working hard to implement as time is of the essence. Please be on the lookout for the invitation for the next engagement with the White House leadership.\n\nAIAS Grassroots Conference, July 18-20\n\nNOMA President-Elect Bryan Lee, Jr. and I attended the American Institute of Architecture Students Grassroots Conference hosted at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library. We met with the next generation of architects and designers, the ones we are fighting for now. We were treated to a tour by President-Elect Lee of the exhibit he designed as part of their permanent collection.\n\nThe decisions we make today and advocate for tomorrow may impact us, but will surely impact the future generations. We need to prepare them to accept and carry on where we fail them, or are unable to move forward as we hope.\n\nAIA’24, Washington, D.C., June 5-8, 2024\n\nWe were happy to see many NOMA members at AIA’24 in Washington, D.C., June 5-8, and at our reception. To advance NOMA’s issues, we attended AIA’s business meeting, led by AIA President and former NOMA President Kimberly Dowdell. Many NOMA members were in the session to observe and support President Dowdell’s leadership. We attended AIA’s Global Leadership meeting, the International President’s Forum, and met global leadership, discussing diversity and equity needs in architecture, pushing the NOMA agenda. As an AIA partner, we will always advocate for NOMA-member issues. As we consider NOMA’s global reach, we connected with the Australian Institute of Architects president Jane Cassidy and are currently developing a long-term partnership.\n\nWe also attended A Dialogue with Kimberly N. Dowdell & Muyiwa Oki—Navigating Architecture, Sustainability, & Equity, supporting President Dowdell and President Oki’s leadership, moderated by architecture critic Lee Bey. Oki is the Royal Institute of British Architects 2023-2025 President. The presidents talked about Oki’s campaign, which included pledges to promote more flexible routes into the profession, increase transparency, dial up efforts to improve diversity, and embrace digital culture, many issues that reflect NOMA’s interest.\n\nTiffany Mayhew, NOMA programs manager, co-presented with allied partner NCARB on Building on Belonging—How to Implement DEI Solutions at Work, a well attended session illustrating the next phase of NOMA partnership with NCARB. Thank you to those who also visited the NOMA booth and reception!\n\nNeoCon, Chicago, June 10-12, 2024\n\nAlong with our allied architecture industry partners, NOMA continues to align with our allied design industry partners. The International Interior Design Association (IIDA) is the host of NeoCon, the trade event hosting leading commercial interior designers, which took place June 10-12 at Chicago’s Merchandise Mart. NOMA leaders were invited by 2023-2024 IIDA President Ronnie Belizaire to participate in a Diversity of Practice panel to discuss strategies that make firms and the projects they produce more inclusive. i-NOMA President James Holland introduced the panel while NOMA Immediate Past President Jason Pugh and I participated in the conversation, moderated by Joseph Cephas.\n\nAs we have more discussions across the industry, we recognize that we have more in common and our combined voices help bring shared issues to the forefront. We will continue to engage in industry-wide events, representing NOMA and our mission of building a strong national organization, strong chapters and strong members for the purpose of minimizing the effect of racism in our profession.\n\nNCARB Annual Meeting: June 13-15, 2024\n\nWe attended the National Council of Architectural Registration Board (NCARB) Annual Meeting June 13-15 in Chicago, where NCARB members from the 55 U.S. architecture licensing boards convened. We participated in workshop sessions on Pathways to Practice and AI and Regulation, representing NOMA’s interest and voice in what exams look like in the future.\n\nWe were pleased to see an increasingly diverse candidate pool run for NCARB Board of Directors, including their first at-large directors, to help shape and regulate the practice of architecture. We congratulate NOMA member John Patrick Rademacher elected as second vice president. We commend NOMA member Kenneth Johnson and Jackiel Sanders, both long-standing NCARB committee members and volunteers, for running for the at-large position.\n\nWe continue to work with NCARB closely to advocate on behalf of increasing diversity, equity and inclusion in the architecture field by critically examining the path to licensure. In 2020, NOMA partnered with NCARB to launch a joint study, Baseline on Belonging, to identify how minority professionals experience obstacles on the path to licensure. Since then, NCARB and NOMA have released four in-depth reports on findings from the study, which highlight areas where our organizations can provide additional support, conduct deeper research, and propose measurable solutions to address disparities. We also released an action plan with next steps to address the disparities in the months and years ahead. It’s through this relationship, and our advocacy, that NCARB’s Board of Directors unanimously retired the rolling clock policy a year ago, which placed a five-year expiration date on passed divisions of the Architect Registration Examination (ARE). The rolling clock disproportionately impacted women and people of color.\n\nWe are making history, advocating for our members and our mission in more ways and places than ever before. We have invited many of the leaders we engaged with at industry conferences to join us at The 2024 NOMA Conference: The eXchange to come meet our members and learn from them directly. Conference is just a few months away. We urge you to join us to engage with industry friends and partners as we work together to diversify the industry and advocate for our industry.\n\nBe Revolutionary,\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nChief Executive Officer, New York Studio, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nNOMA – Upward and Connecting Members\n\n2024 JUNE\n\nJune is the halfway point in the year; a time NOMA reviews their progress against their goals to determine what may need to change or to reset expectations.\n\nNOMA had the opportunity to review our programs and membership status during the May 17th NOMA Town Hall and Board Meeting. Across many NOMA priority initiatives, we’re trending upwards:\n\nIncrease of more than 300 NOMA professional members from this same time last year\n\nGrowth of NOMA professional chapters to 43 within the last year – up three chapters (NOMA Nebraska, SC NOMA and MS NOMA)\n\nAdded seven NOMAS chapters within the last year – a total of 121 schools represented\n\nLargest number of NOMAS graduates in history – 211 graduates who requested a graduate package from NOMA\n\nLargest number of expected campers across the 2024 Project Pipeline Summer Camps, with average camp size the largest to date at over 50 students. More than 32 camps will be held in 35 cities.\n\nAnticipating another sold-out NOMA conference with a 7% increase in registrants in 2024\n\nGrowth of The Directory of African American Architects to now have 614 female architects and more than 70 newly self-registered architects added April 2023 to April 2024\n\nNOMA is honored to be an organization that sustains growth even throughout challenging economic, social and political times. This speaks to our mission, our leadership and the importance we place on valuable professional member programming.\n\nOn June 6th and June 7th, NOMA membership coordinator Yolanda McQueen and NOMA Programs Manager Tiffany Mayhew represented NOMA at AIA’24, engaging with members and actively recruiting new members and managing renewals. It was at AIA’24 when Patricia Solis, NOMA, AIA, LEED- AP, renewed her NOMA membership:\n\n“As a Latina architect, I feel it is important to increase the representation of people of color in the fields of Architecture, Design and Urban Planning. NOMA is a great mechanism to focus on this goal. As a NOMA member, I hope to be an example to the staff I manage at San Francisco Public Works Bureau of Architecture and encourage them to join NOMA as well.”\n\nI love to hear comments, like from Patricia, as to why NOMA membership is important. The sentiment expressed in her recent comment echoes the feelings of a majority of our membership. In a recent survey findings from our 2023 McKinley Advisors survey of NOMA members, more than half (55%) of respondents indicated they would like NOMA to address the underrepresentation of minorities in leadership roles in the architecture field, followed by addressing education opportunities and access to professional resources. We continue to listen and reflect to ensure the work we’re collectively doing is making a difference in cities around the globe and is inspirational for others to make a change.\n\nAs such, we have prioritized the following four areas to help empower and engage members in our NOMA strategic plan:\n\nChapter Empowerment: Enhance local chapter engagement and global scalability of NOMA’s portfolio\n\nCommunication Enrichment: Enhance communication and marketing of member programs and opportunities\n\nEducation Expansion: Expand education opportunities and career resources to support professional members, society, and community\n\nMentorship Enhancement: Enhance effectiveness and expand reach of existing mentorship and sponsorship programs\n\nNOMA Membership to Leadership – #Whoisnext\n\nBecoming a NOMA member is much more than a credential listed after your name. It has the ability to change your career trajectory. The opportunities to lead, mentor, be a mentee and expand your network are endless, and all support approaches to address NOMA member priority workplace challenges. We have 17 elected leadership positions within NOMA available, and I believe there is a role for anyone interested in leading.\n\nThis is what #Whoisnext means to me. Who is ready to elevate through leadership? Who is ready to serve the industry and members of this organization? Who is ready to step into leadership and help us achieve NOMA’s mission? All of us in a NOMA leadership role are happy to share more about what it means to oversee a committee or hold a position. And as we continue to grow, the need for leadership will continue to be important to the future of NOMA. Please reach out to NOMA board members and ask them about their jobs if you are interested in how you could contribute to NOMA as a board member – and remember to renew your membership.\n\nIn a few months we will gather in Baltimore for the 2024 NOMA Conference: The eXchange to expand our thinking and engage in important discussions about the industry and celebrate the collective milestones we’ve made. I encourage you to register now to experience our Conference, especially those who are new to NOMA.\n\nI am excited to continue to serve this outstanding organization as I embark on my final six months as your President.\n\nBe Revolutionary,\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nChief Executive Officer, New York Studio, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nMaking History: Record Number of NOMAS Graduates and Project Pipeline Summer Camps\n\n2024 MAY\n\nOne of the privileges I have as NOMA President is to write a congratulations note to NOMAS graduates who complete their architecture degrees and will receive their NOMAS cord. It is hard to believe the school year has come to an end, with college and university students well into their summer breaks. This year, we had a record number of graduates – 211, the largest in NOMA history. On behalf of NOMA, we congratulate this graduating class on accomplishing a momentous step on their path to licensure.\n\nSummer also means that 32 and counting NOMA chapters are getting ready to kick-off their Project Pipeline Summer Camps, an initiative that began in 2002 when past NOMA President Paul Taylor realized there was not a mentorship program aimed at young Black and minority students to introduce them to the field of architecture and design. This year our first camp of the 2024 season begins June 8, hosted by NOMAUtah. Visit the NOMA website for a full list of camps.\n\nIn 2006, the South West Ohio NOMA chapter organized the first camp in Cincinnati. Since then, more than 35 cities have hosted hundreds of summer camps, introducing more than 20,000 young people to the career possibilities in architecture and design. Under the leadership of incoming NOMA President Bryan Lee Jr. and many others, we formalized a curriculum to guide host chapters and developed a digital curriculum to expand the availability of the program to students who cannot attend an in-person camp. Each year, this program grows. We’ve nearly doubled the average camp size since 2023, averaging 50+ students per camp. Our goal is to ensure that every chapter organizes a camp, fostering inclusivity in architecture and design for students from diverse backgrounds.\n\nProject Pipeline Summer Camp’s growth is not possible without the dedication and support from our NOMA members who oversee the camps, especially Richie Hands, Project Pipeline Chair, and Bryan Bradshaw, Project Pipeline Co-Chair, as well as partnerships, including General Motors who has supported this initiative since 2017, and the AIA LFRT. NOMA members and partners are proud of the commitment to fulfill our mission to empower young people to effect change in their community through design.\n\nThe number of students reached through the camps is one way to measure the impact we’re making, however, hearing the personal success stories from campers who are entering the profession truly demonstrates the power of Project Pipeline.\n\nDerek Davis participated in the week-long Project Pipeline Camp through I-NOMA while in middle school. After participating as a camper, Derek remained interested in architecture throughout high school and recently completed his degree in architecture with a minor in sustainable design from the University of California, Berkeley. He will be a 2024 NOMA Future Faces Fellow (NFF) at LPA Design Studios in San Jose, CA, this summer. When asked how influential Project Pipeline was, he said the camp solidified his interest in architecture and led to him applying to architecture schools across the country.\n\n“What I still remember to this day, years after the camp, is the experience of walking around the city and learning how to sketch buildings and landscapes for the first time. This was the first time I received instructions on what to look for when sketching buildings and led to me looking differently at my surroundings from that point on.”\n\nWe are always looking to capture stories of past Project Pipeline Summer Camp participants. If you have one, please share it with us at media@noma.net.\n\nI thank all of you for your support of Project Pipeline Summer Camps. If your NOMA chapter does not currently offer a camp, please reach out to Richie (richie.hands@noma.net), or Bryan (bryan.bradshaw@noma.net) for guidance on how to establish this transformative program. Together, we are making history and growing the pipeline and providing access to all aspiring architects, one student at a time.\n\nBe Revolutionary!\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nChief Executive Officer, New York Studio, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nYou Deserve to be Recognized\n\n2024 APRIL\n\nTo leave behind a legacy means making an impact that lasts long after you are gone, influencing those who come after you. Many of us strive for this in our careers – we want to positively inspire the next generation, create more opportunities and advocate for change to open doors that may have remained shut. We are surrounded by people, everyday, who have a lasting impact on our lives. And while some may have a larger influence than others, it does not diminish their value or contributions. One conversation from a mentor or peer can change your outlook or career trajectory.\n\nMr. Freelon is one of America’s most prominent and influential Black architects known for both his work as a designer and as an advocate for diversity in the profession, he forever changed the world of architecture and design. His projects celebrated African American history and culture, and his recognition for the lack of diversity in the industry influenced his own hiring practices and educational outreach to focus on BIPOC students and emerging professionals.\n\nMr. Freelon joined NOMA in 1991 and was an active member whose presence was felt throughout the organization. Many of us had the opportunity to meet him at NOMA Conferences – it wasn’t uncommon for members to sit beside him at conference seminars or play basketball with him at the NOMAS vs. Professionals basketball game. He was always kind, generous and approachable.\n\nI had the privilege and honor to meet and have a supportive bond with an industry legacy and NOMA member – Phil Freelon. One of my most fond memories of Mr. Freelon was when many NOMA members from across our nation came to Washington, D.C. to witness the opening of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History & Culture in 2016. As the lead architect on this project, we gathered at the AIA headquarters for a reception to celebrate with Mr. Freelon on this wonderful achievement.\n\nSince his passing in 2019, NOMA recognizes Mr. Freelon’s legacy yearly when we celebrate the Phil Freelon Professional Design Awards, renamed in his honor. Presented at the annual NOMA Conference, the decades-old design awards recognizes outstanding and exemplary architectural design work from NOMA professional members.\n\nWith the opening of the 2024 Phil Freelon Professional Design Awards, we remember Mr. Freelon’s legacy and prepare to celebrate the next generation of professionals who will inspire legacy. Submissions must be made by registered architects who are current NOMA members as of the submission deadline, August 16, 2024, and entries may include new construction, rehabilitation, restorations, additions, adaptive reuse, or conceptual work in the following award categories: Built Work; Unbuilt Work; Vision; Historic Preservation, Restoration and Renovation; and Small Projects. We encourage all of our professional members to submit their work for the opportunity to be recognized for this prestigious industry award.\n\nBe a Part of History and Celebrate Legacy – The eXchange: Local Ideas + National Impact\n\nThis July will mark the five-year anniversary of Mr. Freelon’s passing. The 2024 Phil Freelon Professional Design Award recipients will be recognized this October in Baltimore at our annual conference – The eXchange: Local Ideas, National Impact. Baltimore is home to several buildings designed by Freelon and his firm, including the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of African American History and Culture, teaching visitors about Black history and culture and demonstrating the belief that architecture is a form of activism and education. Mr. Freelon also designed the Center for the Built Environment and Infrastructure Studies (CBEIS) at Morgan State University, which is the only Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in Maryland with an accredited architecture program.\n\nPlease join us in Baltimore (be on the lookout for early bird registration opening next month), and submit now for the 2024 Phil Freelon Professional Design Awards to be recognized for the outstanding contributions you’re making to the profession. We are fortunate to have outstanding talent within the NOMA members, and look forward to honoring your work.\n\nCongratulations again to the honorees from the 2023 Phil Freelon Design Awards – you can view the list here or watch a short video honoring their tremendous work.\n\nBe Revolutionary!\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nChief Executive Officer, New York Studio, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nBreaking Barriers: Celebrating the Rise of Black Female Architects\n\n2024 MARCH\n\nAs an undergraduate architecture student, I encountered a defining moment that reshaped my career trajectory. Two weeks into the semester, a professor singled out another female student and me, asserting in front of sixty peers that we would never become architects because we were Black and female. This statement was not just about me—it was a reflection of broader biases against women, especially Black women, in our field.\n\nThis memory drives my commitment to uplift the more than 600 Black female licensed architects listed in the NOMA Directory of African American Architects. Despite the fact that according to NCARB’s 2023 report, there are 119,906 registered architects in the United States, women comprise less than 25 percent of all licensed architects. However, we are making significant strides. Our dreams are achievable, but we need supportive leaders and a community that uplifts those striving for excellence.\n\nThe Directory of African American Architects, maintained as a public service, promotes awareness of African American architects and their locations. Initially brought to life by Dennis A. Mann and Bradford C. Grant, the directory has evolved from print to web, earning recognition from the American Institute of Architects for “Collaborative Achievement.”\n\nNOMA is not only hosting and maintaining the original directory but is also developing a more comprehensive, data-rich resource. This next-generation database will include landscape architects, educators, authors, and provide detailed demographics about the multicultural spectrum of architects and will be launching this year.\n\nThe directory serves as a crucial tool for industry accountability, tracking the progress of African American architects and highlighting disparities. With 2,556 self-reported licensed Black architects currently listed, we still have work to do in ensuring the database’s accuracy and visibility. I urge all licensed architects who identify as African American to self-report and contribute to our documented history.\n\nThe 2030 Diversity Challenge, initiated by NOMA and the AIA Large Firm Roundtable, aims to more than double the number of licensed African American architects by 2030 to 5,000. While this goal will increase representation from 2 percent to approximately 4 percent, it falls short of reflecting the 14 percent Black population in the U.S. Nonetheless, it marks a significant step towards changing the face of our industry.\n\nAs the 315th African American female living architect in the directory, I am proud of the 607 fellow architects and am eager to see our numbers grow. NOMA offers numerous tools and resources to support those on the path to licensure. Together, we can shatter the glass ceiling and make history, ensuring a more diverse and representative architectural profession.\n\nThis is a pivotal time for the industry that must be recognized and, more importantly, used to inspire the future females of design. #NOMAStandUp and applaud these women for their dedication and determination. I am privileged to lead alongside them and know this is only the beginning.\n\nAnd finally, there are many firsts happening in the design industry, including a complete slate of African American female leaders. In a unique collaboration between the American Planning Association, American Institute of Architects and the National Organization of Minority Architects, we asked our current female leadership to answer a variety of leadership questions from our respective roles that resonated with each of us. I hope you enjoy, learn and feel inspired from their responses.\n\nBe Revolutionary!\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nChief Executive Officer, New York Studio, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M.

Woodson, the “father of Black History” and an African American historian, scholar, educator and publisher. Woodson imagined a week-long celebration to promote and educate people, specifically in the public schools, about Black history and culture. The second week of February was chosen as it coincides with the birthdays of Frederick Douglas and Abraham Lincoln and became a month-long celebration in 1976 when President Gerald Ford recognized it as Black History Month. Canada also celebrates Black History Month in February, while countries such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Ireland celebrate it in October.\n\nWhile the month of February is a time of celebration and recognition, we know Black history is American history, and the contributions and challenges that shaped our country from African Americans should be acknowledged, taught and discussed all year round and not one month a year.\n\nServing as your NOMA President and former Historian, we commit to always elevating the voices of our members, celebrating our triumphs and documenting our successes. Our organization began over 50 years ago, and recording our history remains important to its preservation. We must document our past and present to ensure its accuracy, so that NOMA’s history is not forgotten but told and understood by generations to come. I am humbled when I have the opportunity to listen and learn from those who advanced the profession. These voices can be heard within NOMAC – The National Organization of Minority Architects Council. NOMAC is an esteemed and dedicated group of NOMA and industry members who continue to showcase organizational leadership to help guide the future of NOMA. As NOMA’s highest honor, accomplished and long-standing members are invited to join NOMAC based on their contributions to NOMA and to the design profession at large, for outstanding volunteer work, dedication to NOMA, academic contribution, built works, business, and social advocacy. We announce and welcome new NOMAC members at our annual conference each October. NOMAC members may be distinguished by two different pins: a black pin with a ruby represents NOMAC members in positions other than President and a purple pin with a ruby represents NOMAC members who served as past Presidents.

I treasure their knowledge and advice and respect their tenacity and courage to do what others before them had not done. Listen and learn from the voices of:\n\nMr. Leon Bridges, NOMAC, FAIA, Emeritus and the sole surviving member of the first NOMA organizational meeting in Detroit in 1971, who addressed attendees at the 2022 NOMA Conference in Nashville.\n\nMs. Gabrielle Bullock, NOMAC, FAIA, who describes the moment she knew she wanted to become an architect and how she hopes to be an example for others on how they might not be silent in a video celebrating her 2020 AIA Whitney M.

Stanley III, NOMAC, FAIA, FRAIC, who shares perspective on why he became an architect, what his experience has been as a minority architect and how NOMA has impacted his life.\n\nMs. Roberta Washington, NOMAC, FAIA, who presents a robust history of Black architecture in the United States, specifically New York architects, through the American Institute of Architects New York Diversity and Inclusion Committee and nycobaNOMA. Her presentation reinforces the need to always document so no one can be forgotten.\n\nNOMA Historian, Josh Foster, NOMA, Assoc. AIA will continue to document and share insights from NOMAC voices throughout the year. We will always learn, celebrate and commemorate those who came before us, who broke barriers to create opportunities and who fought and risked so much for those of us currently in the profession and entering.

While reflecting on the past is important, the start of 2024 is a time to build upon the momentum each of us has created as a NOMA member. Resolutions tend to focus on what to do less of – I ask each of us to think about what we can do more of as a leader in NOMA, our communities and our workplace. Each of our commitments will vary for many reasons, however, if we each attend one more event, join one more committee, mentor or have one more conversation with an emerging professional, it advances our mission.\n\nLeadership is acknowledging that we accomplish more when we work together than we can as individuals. This is the essence of NOMA – together, through our actions, we are here to lead others to transform the industry and world. Working in silos is one approach but it is more effective to work together, as one. While we may all operate as leaders, we need individuals to emerge within the organization to serve in leadership positions. #NOMAStandUp and demonstrate the values and principles that guide us.\n\nWe have 17 elected leadership positions within NOMA, including President. These coveted positions are available to be held by individuals who want to serve, lead and make a difference. In turn, NOMA commits to stand by these leaders, elevating and supporting them and providing them with the resources and tools to successfully serve.\n\nAs we closed 2023, we developed a NOMA Board Manual that details what is needed to serve. As 2024 begins, we are rolling out NOMA Board of Directors training to help each of our elected leaders understand roles and responsibilities, and the organization’s commitment to each of these roles. Providing transparency and clarity to the roles of each position will allow the Board to work together more seamlessly and help onboard new members to these positions. To perform as the first-class organization that we are means ensuring we have processes and procedures in place for NOMA leadership and staff.\n\nI am grateful to have served with an esteemed group of Board of Directors for 2023 and specifically want to acknowledge Julian Owens, who served as the NOMA National Parliamentarian for the 2022/2023 term. Julian’s contributions and commitment to NOMA were unparalleled, all while managing time zones from Australia for part of his tenure. Julian, with the support of key members of the board, developed New Chapter by-law templates facilitating significant organizational growth, including seven professional chapters, 21 student chapters and one international chapter, all while becoming a licensed Architect.\n\nWe have an outstanding 2024 Board of Directors that I am thrilled to partner with, including Brien Graham, Ameera Ashraf-O’Neil and Joshua Cato who are stepping into NOMA leadership roles and to Julia Weatherspoon, for serving an additional term. As we begin 2024, my question to you is #Whoisnext? Who is ready to elevate through leadership? Who is ready to serve the industry and members of this organization? Who is ready to step into leadership and help us achieve NOMA’s mission? There are many NOMA members who I believe can be next – and I’m here to support each of you as we work to change the face of the industry. I believe the answer is you.\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nAssociate Principal, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M.

We have created a global professional membership with a strong voice unified by a shared mission to diversify our field, eradicate the lingering effects of racism, and create greater economic opportunities for Black and minority architects.\n\nNOMA provides support to each of us and finds the resources that make change possible in a profession that remains undiversified. We need our collective voices to continue to be heard, and we need the commitment and fierceness of our members, especially the future architects, to feel empowered in this fight. The NOMA legacy does not end and must be carried on, nurtured and sustained. Tiffany Brown and I discussed the future of NOMA and how we can help empower future architects in the “What’s Next With NOMA” video series. We, as NOMA members, are accountable to teach and guide new architects by learning our history and our pronounced impact. As we close the year and look forward to a new one, we are committed to sharing our history, and we encourage #NOMAStandUp by providing mentorship and asking new and emerging voices. We work to ensure all aspiring architects feel limitless, boundless and strong as they move from membership into leadership, receive licensure and beyond. I am proud and filled with gratitude for our organization and its members, and believe in the great future of NOMA. I hope you are just as inspired and excited for 2024 and years ahead.\n\nWishing your family a healthy and happy holiday season.\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nAssociate Principal, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M.

Membership is at an all-time high, 3,581 members and growing, with 42 professional and 117 student chapters. Our increasing size directly correlates with our ability to advance our mission and extend the reach of our programs. We’re proud to share that the 42nd professional chapter and the first European chapter, NOMAuk, officially launched and is accepting members. We’re eager to build upon the established momentum as we work to expand beyond the U.S. and create a global network of minority architects. Stay tuned for a broader update in 2024 on other global chapters.\n\nReflecting on the year, I wanted to share the opening remarks made at the 2023 NOMA Conference Member Business Session held the morning of Friday, Oct. 13, in Portland. The sentiment expresses the gratitude NOMA leadership and I have for our members. We are a force that will continue to push boundaries and break barriers to create a more inclusive and equitable future for all. But we can only accomplish greatness with member commitment. We rely on member participation to grow local chapters and harness the energy to increase engagement through mentorship and involvement in existing programs. With 2024 around the corner, I ask each of you to renew your NOMA membership now. Commit to staying involved, serve on a program committee, mentor a rising future architect and explore partnerships to accelerate NOMA’s mission. #NOMAStandUp to continue growing the organization in 2024.\n\nPresident Sablan’s Remarks: 2023 NOMA Conference Member Business Session\n\nLadies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, and my cherished fellow members of the National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA),\n\nI stand before you today, my heart bursting with pride and gratitude as we gather to celebrate the extraordinary journey of the past nine months. Serving as the President of NOMA during this transformative period has been an honor beyond words, and I am thrilled to share with you the breathtaking accomplishments we’ve achieved together, championing diversity and excellence in the architectural world.\n\nFrom the very outset, our mission was clear, our vision resolute – to revolutionize our profession, creating a space that’s not just inclusive but truly representative of the magnificent tapestry of our society, irrespective of one’s background. Today, I want to take you on an exhilarating journey through the incredible milestones we’ve reached as NOMA.\n\nOur journey began with unwavering advocacy. We stood as one, boldly raising our voices against the Supreme Court’s ruling on affirmative action. We understood the seismic impact this ruling could have on minority representation in our profession, and we refused to stay silent. Our voices reverberated across the nation, echoing our commitment to policies that nurture diversity and inclusivity within the education system.\n\nBut our journey was not limited to advocacy alone – we took resolute action. Our membership soared, a testament to the profound value our members place on NOMA and its profound mission. We expanded our horizons, welcoming new chapters into our NOMA family, and spreading our influence far and wide. Today, I am thrilled to announce that our membership stands strong, with over 3,000 dedicated members, and we’re boldly aiming for 4,200 members by year-end. This growth has empowered us to amplify our message, ensuring that every voice is not only heard but celebrated.\n\nYet, our commitment extends further. We’ve tirelessly worked to provide unparalleled value to our members. We introduced the NOMA Jobs Board, provided financial support for the Architect Registration Examination, and forged invaluable networking opportunities and mentorship programs. We understand that our members are the heartbeat of our organization, and our pledge to support each one of you, regardless of your career stage, remains unshakeable.\n\nEducation has always been the heartbeat of NOMA, and we’ve never strayed from that path. We recognized the pivotal role educators play in shaping the future of our profession and have proudly celebrated the distinguished academic leaders among us. We are currently hard at work on a groundbreaking academic journal, a platform to amplify the contributions of NOMA members to academia and the architectural discipline, ensuring that our voices resonate powerfully in the world of education.\n\nHowever, perhaps our most breathtaking accomplishment lies in our unyielding resilience. In the face of adversity, we came together, fiercely determined and united. We navigated through uncharted waters, advocated relentlessly for change, and continued to shine a spotlight on the awe-inspiring achievements of Black and minority architects. We celebrated not just our major victories but the countless small triumphs that collectively make us who we are.\n\nAs we stride forward, let us remember – our journey is far from its conclusion. We will stand shoulder to shoulder, advocating for justice, and creating a profession that mirrors the breathtaking diversity of our society. We will remain revolutionaries, never wavering in our pursuit of a more inclusive architecture industry, where every voice is not only valued but cherished, and every talent is celebrated with passion.\n\nThank you for your unwavering support, and I am bursting with anticipation to share more about our achievements and future dreams in the moments to come. Together, bound by our NOMA family, we are not just shaping the future of architecture – we’re painting it with the vibrant hues of passion, one connection at a time.\n\nThank you!\n\nBe Revolutionary,\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nAssociate Principal, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nBridges Were Built at NOMA Conference\n\n2023 OCTOBER\n\nI still feel the energy from gathering together in Portland at the NOMA Conference to exchange ideas, foster meaningful connections with the more than 1,550 registrants, listen to the 50+ engaging lectures and transformative workshops and celebrate the outstanding contributions of our 3,565 members from 42 professional chapters and 117 student chapters. Themed “Building Bridges Towards Just and Joyful Futures,” we are reminded of the remarkable progress we’ve achieved together. We have come a long way since our humble beginnings, and our value and relevance are unmistakable in our growing and dynamic membership. Together, we built a rich legacy, overcame formidable barriers, and created bridges over various forms of oppression. The impact of our conference reaches far beyond those few days, resonating in our local communities and echoing through the halls of history. I can absolutely say we lived up to the theme – bridges were built and crossed.\n\nSpeaking with many of you at the conference, I heard the word ‘recharge’ used time and again to describe NOMA’s Conference. It is a moment in time to reflect and recharge on our choices of why we were called to become architects. As architects, we’re often seen as the creators of spaces and designers of buildings, but we are also the architects of change. We are the builders of hope and the creators of opportunities. Our role extends far beyond drawings and structures; it encompasses the responsibility to shape the environments where people live, learn, work, and dream. It isn’t often until we’re together when we remember and realize our magnitude. Each keynote discussion, educational seminar and city tour was powerful and helped us ‘recharge.’ This year’s Barbara G. Laurie Student Design Competition commemorated the 10th anniversary of her passing and naming of the competition in her honor, celebrating Barbara’s legacy as an accomplished architect and a dedicated advocate for diversity and equity in the profession. The competition has a rich history that traces back almost two decades. What began with just a few schools, this year showcased the brilliant work of 38 NOMAS chapters from coast to coast. It’s an event that brings together students from diverse backgrounds to collaborate, innovate, and reimagine the built environment and is one of the only conferences that offer a live jury experience for real-time engagement and interaction. To see the next generation of NOMA members engaged – and increasing – brings hope and is a moment of joy to witness their creativity, teamwork and brilliance.\n\nI am filled with pride and gratitude as I reflect on the milestones we’ve achieved as a NOMA community – we are nothing without one another striving for a more equitable profession. We recognized an unprecedented number of recently licensed architects – 29 – at the NOMA Member Business Session. This number matters because it gets us that much closer to achieving the 2030 Diversity Challenge, an initiative established in 2020 under the leadership of NOMA Past President Kim Dowdell (2019-2020) and the AIA LFRT. The challenge calls for us to more than double the number of licensed Black architects from 2,300 to 5,000 by 2030, increasing representation from a mere 2% to roughly 4%. We applaud the licensed architects and all of those in the pipeline as we work to reach this goal.\n\nThe Awards Gala was a special moment for member recognition – a night filled with celebration as we recognized members’ achievements. The list of distinguished honors can be found in the press release, including the prestigious Phil Freelon Professional Design Awards (view submission gallery), with winners receiving a newly designed trophy that represents the award-winning work. The leadership honors from the awards gala are highlighted below.\n\nNOMA Awards\n\nNOMA President’s Award: Tyrone Marshall, NOMAtlanta\n\nNOMA 2023 Member of the Year: Ralph Raymond, NOMAtlanta\n\nNOMA 2023 Chapter of the Year – Large Chapter: SoFloNOMA\n\nNOMA 2023 Chapter of the Year – Small Chapter: NOMA of Central Texas\n\nNOMAS Student Member of the Year: Dana Austin Bass from University of Washington\n\nNOMAS Chapter of the Year: University of Detroit Mercy\n\nBarbara G.

I also want to express our gratitude to our sponsors and partners who played a pivotal role.\n\nI would be remiss without sharing an update on Sam Gomez, a NOMA presenter and partner who was the victim of senseless gun violence on Wednesday, Oct. 11. Sam was shot in the leg while witnessing a road rage incident in downtown Portland. He was hospitalized and underwent surgery in Portland. He has returned home to heal in Phoenix. Sam, The Sagrado’s executive director, was scheduled to speak at the conference, along with his co-presenter Nakia Neves. Miraculously and courageously, he taped a message from his hospital bed that Nakia played at their session.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers continue to be with Sam and his family, as well as the other victim who passed away, Ryan Martin. Nothing can prepare us for experiencing trauma, however, our NOMA family came together to ensure there was support for Sam, as well as prioritized the safety of all our members attending the conference. As the NOMA community, we all are here to support and uplift one another, to unite, to find hope and reprieve from a world fraught with imperfection and injustice.\n\nSam’s strength and courage are a testament to NOMA’s mission. We are working with Sam and Nakia to reschedule their conference seminar session and will send more details soon.\n\nAs we stride forward, let us remember – our journey is far from its conclusion. We will stand shoulder to shoulder, advocating for justice, and creating a profession that mirrors the breathtaking diversity of our society. We will remain revolutionaries, never wavering in our pursuit of a more inclusive architecture industry, where every voice is not only valued but cherished, and every talent is celebrated with passion.\n\nI encourage you all to get involved with your local chapters. NOMA Conference is one moment in time but we, as NOMA members, have the opportunity to build community. #NOMAStandUp to push boundaries, break barriers, and create a more inclusive and equitable future for all.\n\nNow…be ready to secure your spot when early registration opens for Baltimore 2024 as we anticipate another outstanding sold-out conference!\n\nBe Revolutionary,\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nAssociate Principal, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nNOMA Stands for Peace, Justice, and Compassion Amidst Gaza Conflict\n\nThe National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA) issues this statement to unequivocally denounce the ongoing violence in Israel and Gaza, which has inflicted immense suffering upon innocent civilians and resulted in the loss of precious lives. We firmly reject any and all forms of violence and oppression.\n\nAt NOMA, our mission is deeply rooted in a legacy of activism, committed to fostering justice and equity in communities of color through outreach, community advocacy, professional development, and design excellence. During these trying times, we stand together in solidarity with all those affected by the conflict and reaffirm our commitment to advocate for peace and justice.\n\nOur organization believes in the power of architecture to shape not only physical spaces but also the communities and relationships within them. We recognize that architecture is a force that can foster understanding, promote peace, and uplift humanity. Therefore, we call upon all members of our community to extend their compassion and support to those affected by the conflict.\n\nWe reject all forms of hate and discrimination, including anti-semitism and Islamophobia. Furthermore, we categorically denounce any false equivalency between anti-semitism and supporting the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people for liberation in their homeland and in diaspora.\n\nIn these challenging times, NOMA will offer space and time for anyone within our network to grieve, care, and engage in compassionate dialogue. We understand the importance of open and honest conversations to foster understanding and healing.\n\nTo make a positive impact in the region, we encourage everyone to consider donating to reputable organizations that are tirelessly working to secure peace and provide relief. Your support can help alleviate the suffering of those affected by the conflict and contribute to building a more just and peaceful world.\n\nNOMA remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting freedom and justice for all people, and we call upon the global community to join us in pursuing these noble ideals.\n\nIf you are seeking ways to assist those who have been impacted, you can do so at the following links:\n\nPalestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF)\n\nSave the Children\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross\n\nMagen David Adom (Red Star of David)\n\nCelebrating our Academic Champions\n\n2023 SEPTEMBER\n\nIt’s fall and for more than one-third of our members who are part of the National Organization of Minority Architecture Students (NOMAS), it means back to school and campuses. For our NOMA members who are also teaching, it means back to curriculums and leading the way.\n\nAccording to data from the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB), it takes Black or African Americans 13.8 years, on average, to be ready for licensure, the longest of all demographics. Nearly half (5-7 years) of that time is spent in academic programs. Most of us spend years and financial resources on education that shapes and influences our perspective even before we set foot inside a firm or organization as a fellow, apprentice or intern.\n\nOnce licensure is achieved, education does not end there. Many organizations require a minimum number of continuous learning hours in order to maintain membership status, including the American Institute of Architects (AIA).\n\nWhile each of us has our own unique path that brought us into the profession of design and architecture, the time we spent studying and engaging in lecture halls and classrooms has influenced and enlightened each of us as designers, planners and architects. The academic leaders and professors who guided us and continue to support rising architects were and remain a big part of that process. These individuals help build the pipeline, provide words of encouragement and inspiration, serve as mentors and may be the first person(s) who supports your decision to become an architect. These professors and leaders are staying strong to help us build and diversify the profession. We need to acknowledge their successes and contributions and the important role educators play in the development of the pipeline.\n\nI’m pleased to recognize the following educators who received academic tenure over the last few years:\n\nDr. Kwesi Daniels, PhD, MSc Sust. Mgmt., MArch, BArch, NOMA, Associate AIA, ACSA Department Head and Associate Professor of Architecture at The Robert R. Taylor School of Architecture and Construction Science (TSACS) with Tuskegee University\n\nDr. Craig Wilkins, PhD, MSc. real estate and urban development, B.A., Associate Professor of Architecture at the University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning\n\nGermane Barnes, Associate Professor and Director of the Community Housing Identity Lab (CHIL) at the University Of Miami School Of Architecture\n\nWe applaud this group of esteemed academic leaders in our NOMA community and support the wonderful work they are doing. There may be others we have missed so please email me at president@noma.netso we can recognize all deserving educators.\n\nNOMA Educate pillar focuses on the needs of our higher education professionals while promoting rewarding alternative career paths in the architecture and design industry. A higher education career demands professors to engage in research and creative work, publishing the results widely. NOMA has the opportunity to galvanize the collective effort of our valued scholars and educators at esteemed institutions of higher education across the country by creating a robust platform for professors to collaborate and share their work. Holding true to the mission, NOMA is working with several members of academia to author and publish an academic journal featuring NOMA members contributions to academia and the architecture discipline. The peer-reviewed academic publication is being coordinated by our Educate Co-Chairs Dr. Kwesi Daniels and Annicia Streete, with a stellar team including Dr. Craig Wilkins, PhD, MSc. real estate and urban development, B.A., Associate Professor of Architecture at the University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. We will have more to share at NOMA’s conference in October about how academics, including NOMA PhD students, can contribute to this academic journal.\n\nSTAY VIGILANT, STAY ACTIVE, DEMAND MORE\n\nWhile we celebrate the important role education and educators play in the development of our careers, I must call to attention to the recent legislation, specifically the Supreme Court’s ruling that selectively prohibits the use of race as a factor in college admissions. This decision creates yet another barrier that may further impact the representation of certain minority groups in our field. NOMA issued a statement after the SCOTUS affirmative action ruling. We remain vigilant and committed to speaking out and advocating for policies that promote diversity and inclusivity within the education system.\n\nBut it doesn’t end there – censorship rulings on topics such as critical race theory (CRT) are also impacting our NOMA community of professors where our colleagues are having to make hard decisions about leaving universities for fear of censorship or worse, losing a job. This is wrong. We rely on Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs) to educate, confer degrees and share our history, and once again, these institutions continue to lead the way in how to create an equitable environment for all. We must expect more from ALL academic institutions.\n\n#NOMASTANDUP STRONG AND PROUD // USING OUR VOICES\n\nIt’s times of uncertainty where I’m most proud to #NOMAStandUp with each of you. We have an obligation to the industry to ensure that access to higher education and an architectural education from highly regarded professors is available in order to create a more equitable and diverse profession. We are committed to partnering with like-minded organizations that align with our mission. Silence is compliance – NOMA will not stay silent. We continue to raise and use our voices. We will support and stand-by the academics who have influenced and played a leading role in helping each of us define our career. For the NOMAS students at institutions who have banned classes, please ask your college administration about any courses that were omitted and why. Engage in dialogue. For NOMA professional members, steer young BIPOC students to institutions where they will be embraced and feel safe to learn history and explore their future in design thinking.\n\nThere is so much more to be discussed about this topic – and many others. I look forward to seeing you at conference next week and having conversations about this topic and strategizing active steps we can take as a community. Please feel free to reach out with your thoughts.\n\nCongratulations again to the tenured educators. You continue to inspire and lead the way.\n\nBe Revolutionary,\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nAssociate Principal, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nRenew Now for NOMA\n\n2023 AUGUST\n\nWhen I joined NOMA in 2009, there were less than 500 NOMA members. As of August 2023, we are more than 3,153 members strong, with a goal of achieving 4,200 members by the end of 2023. This growth is an impressive feat, with these numbers representing the commitment, investment and dedication from all the members who comprise this outstanding organization.\n\nMembership Growth\n\nNOMA has experienced steady growth over the last five years despite the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, and in direct response to acts of violence against the BIPOC community, a testament to the value members place on the organization and our efforts to advance and fight for the diversification of, and equity in, the profession. We continue to build upon the momentum to drive awareness of NOMA and our purpose, helping grow membership, establish new partnerships, and claim our seat at the table to ensure all voices are represented.\n\nOur size has positively impacted our ability to advance our mission, allowing us to communicate our messages and programs to reach the industry. This is when change happens – how we influence and reframe the conversation to impact the future of design and the communities we live in and serve.\n\nMembership At-a-Glance:\n\n41 Professional Chapters\n\n114 Student Chapters with more than 1,000 NOMAS membership (first time reaching this milestone!)\n\nThe largest professional chapter is SoCal NOMA\n\nThe largest student chapter is Kean University\n\nThe West region has the most members\n\nThe South region has the most student chapters\n\nThe NOMA chapter added this year is South Carolina (SCNOMA)\n\nThe NOMAS chapters added this year are Catholic University NOMAS, University of Pennsylvania NOMA, East Los Angeles College (ELAC) NOMAS, Santa Monica College (SMC) NOMAS, University of Washington (UW) NOMAS, Southern California Institute of Architecture NOMAS, Ohio State University NOMAS, University of Indiana NOMAS\n\nWe will continue on this growth trajectory into 2024, with expected growth as a result from:\n\nBroader awareness of NOMA and support from our partners\n\nAn increase of BIPOC architecture and design students entering the field\n\nOur strategic intent to expand NOMA globally\n\nWe rely on member commitment. You can do your part to communicate the value of NOMA membership to peers and colleagues and advocate for interested students to join. I challenge each of you to identify one potential new member – bring them to a NOMA professional event or have them join you at a local social event to show them the value of membership. These individual actions can grow our local chapters and help increase engagement through mentorship and involvement in existing programs, like Project Pipeline Summer Camps. There is a role and opportunity for everyone.\n\nMember Retention\n\nAs an existing NOMA member, we value your contributions and participation and want to ensure NOMA is offering valuable and exclusive benefits to every member, regardless of their career level. A benefit of NOMA’s growth is the ability to offer more value to our members. This includes:\n\nNOMA Jobs Board\n\nHBCU Professional Development Program\n\nAccess to Request for Proposals\n\nDirectory of African American Architects\n\nArchitect Registration Examination® Financial Support\n\nNOMA Local Chapter Membership\n\nNOMA National Conference member pricing\n\nLearning tools, such as NOMA University\n\nConnection and Community-Building Tools, such as NOMA Connect\n\nNOMA Professional and Student Awards\n\nNOMA Portfolio\n\nNOMA Magazine\n\nBlack Spectacles ARE Exam Prep discounts\n\nProfessional networking opportunities and mentorship\n\nAdvocacy and awareness programs to advance BIPOC designer awareness,including Project Pipeline\n\nVolunteer and leadership opportunities\n\nCommitment to social advocacy programming\n\nPrograms and benefits for students and young professionals, including NOMA Future Faces (NFF) for graduating seniors and discounted rates\n\nWe aim to grow existing programs, however, we do ask for member involvement and feedback to ensure you’re receiving the most out of your membership. If you have feedback to share, please email me at president@noma.net.\n\nI thank NOMA membership co-chair Bernard Suber, NOMA, AIA, LEED AP and NOMA staff member Yolanda McQueen for their partnership and dedication to member recruitment and retention. This team works endlessly to manage new memberships and renewals, and without them, NOMA would be unable to grow at this incredible pace.\n\nAs the summer comes to an end and many of us settle into a new schedule with reestablished priorities, I ask each of you to renew your NOMA membership. Early renewal avoids late fees. Do it early and commit to staying involved. I encourage all of us to #NOMAStandUp to continue growing this organization and change the face of the industry.\n\nBe Revolutionary,\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nAssociate Principal, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nStay Involved to Keep NOMA Strong\n\nWelcome to NOMA, where brilliance meets purpose! We are more than just a professional organization; we are a community of distinguished architects and designers, united by our exceptional work that leaves a positive impact on both the industry and communities across the U.S.\n\nOur passion lies in fostering diversity within the architectural world, and we wholeheartedly commit ourselves to increasing the number of licensed BIPOC architects. Through professional mentorship, influencing industry policies, and creating innovative programs, we aim to build a stronger, more inclusive pipeline, propelling the field to new heights.\n\nBut what makes NOMA truly special is our incredible members. It’s the synergy of talents, trust, and shared experiences that have forged unbreakable bonds within our ranks. From local chapter events to national gatherings, we come together to celebrate success, support each other, and create lifelong friendships. When one of us triumphs, it’s a victory for all of NOMA!\n\nOur social events are legendary and an integral part of the NOMA experience. Whether hitting the slopes at the exhilarating NOMA Ski Weekend in March, mingling at the NOMA reception during The American Institute of Architects Conference on Architecture, or soaking in the inspiration at the NOMA Conference each fall, our gatherings leave you invigorated and inspired.\n\nThese moments go beyond the professional realm; they’re the intangible perks of being a NOMA member. You never know how a single connection at these events can transform your career trajectory and expand your social network. So, I encourage each one of you to participate as frequently as your schedule allows, and don’t forget to extend a warm invitation to fellow NOMA members. Together, we create a vibrant tapestry of innovation and camaraderie.\n\nStep into NOMA’s world, where passion, purpose, and unforgettable connections await you. Join us as we shape the future of architecture, one connection at a time.\n\nBe Revolutionary,\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nAssociate Principal, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nRecognition Drives Change\n\n2023 JULY\n\nRecognition, by its very definition, encompasses the act of being acknowledged and heard, along with the public expression of appreciation for someone’s accomplishments. When it comes to our professional endeavors, recognition plays a crucial role as it validates the significance of our work and the impact it creates. At NOMA, our members consistently receive recognition from their peers and leaders within the industry, shining a spotlight on the remarkable abilities of Black and minority architects and contributing to the transformation of the field. We have triumphed over barriers, breaking through glass ceilings, and witnessing numerous NOMA members being honored with high honors and awards. I am in awe of the professional commitment and excellence displayed by so many of you.\n\nHowever, Black and minority architects still remain underrepresented in the industry and thus, also in awards. While this does not mean our individual work is undervalued, it does mean that collectively, there are fewer opportunities to see the work of Black and minority architects highlighted.. We must work hard, fearlessly, and diligently to make certain our voices are heard and to see our names represented in awards and our work and faces displayed in history books. When we do, we disrupt the status quo and positively impact the industry.\n\nNOMA awards and recognitions are available to members. Below, you’ll find current opportunities to showcase your own contributions, and also those of others. We encourage each of you to continue to submit and gain the recognition you deserve. We are here to honor each other.\n\nNOMA MEMBER RECOGNITION\n\nNOMA National Awards\n\nOne of the benefits of NOMA membership is participation in our annual NOMA Awards at the NOMA Conference, held in Portland in October of this year. It is a time to honor the achievements of each other as members, acknowledging the dedication of individuals, and professional and student chapters. Our 2023 NOMA Awards just opened and includes the prestigious Phil Freelon Professional Design Awards recognizing outstanding design work, as well as individual and chapter awards focused on leadership and NOMA engagement.\n\nOur NOMAS chapters and student members are also honored for their early dedication to the field. One of the NOMA Conference highlights is the Barbara G. Laurie Student Design Competition, where NOMAS chapters compete in a two-day design competition.\n\nI ask each of you to review the NOMA Awards and consider participation through a submission or nomination to lift-up people doing great work around us.\n\nNOMAC\n\nThe NOMA Council (NOMAC) is an esteemed group of established NOMA and industry members who continue to showcase organizational leadership to help guide the future of NOMA. As NOMA’s highest honor, past Presidents are sometimes inducted into the NOMA Council upon the ending of their administration. Other accomplished and long-standing members can be invited to join NOMAC based on their contributions to NOMA and to the design profession at large, including volunteer work, academic, built work, business, and social advocacy. This year, we recognized William M. Brown III, FAIA, Jason Pugh, NOMAC, AIA, AICP, LEED AP, Andrew Thompson, AIA, NOMAC, LEED AP BD+C, as the newest members to the Council.\n\nEmeritus\n\nEmeritus status is an honorary status granted to NOMA members who have made exceptional contributions to the field. It is a mark of distinguished service awarded by the NOMA President for their commitment to the industry. This year, we recognized Mr. Leon Bridges, FAIA, NOMAC, for his appointment to Emeritus. A true trailblazer in the industry, Mr. Bridges became a NOMA member in 1973. He held every elected office, including National President in 1980. We congratulate Mr. Bridges for his years of service. Learn more about this professional journey here.\n\nNOMA Pins\n\nNOMA has five variations of the National pin, each with a different significant meaning. We encourage all NOMA members to wear their pins and be able to speak about its meaning:\n\nBrown pin: Represents NOMA Members (non-students)\n\nBlack pin: Represents Licensed Architects\n\nBlack pin with a ruby: Represents NOMA Council Members in positions other than President\n\nPurple pin: Represents the current sitting NOMA President\n\nPurple pin with a ruby: Represents NOMA Council Members who served as past President\n\nNOMA MEMBER INDUSTRY HONORS\n\nJust as important – we must take the time to celebrate our successes and wins. NOMA members are doing extraordinary things- both within our communities and within the practice. We must support each other and honor all the wins, big and small. Let us all be proud and recognize our greatness to inspire a better future. Below is a sampling of the incredible achievements of your fellow NOMA members:\n\nThe Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) Honorary Fellows\n\nDavid Hughes, FAIA, NOMA, received the Honorary Fellowship of The College of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (HFRAIC) in recognition for his “distinguished scholarly contributions as supported by research, publications or teaching in the field of Architecture or in an allied field.” The highest honor the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) can grant a non-member, the HFRAIC is an Honorary Member of the RAIC who has achieved international professional eminence or has rendered distinctive service to the profession or to the community at large, nationally or internationally.\n\nAmerican Institute of Architects\n\nCollege of Fellows (FAIA)\n\nEleven NOMA members were elevated to the esteemed American Institute of Architects (AIA) College of Fellows for their accomplishments to the profession and society in 2023, the largest number of NOMA members elevated in one year. Fellowship is the highest AIA membership honor an individual architect can receive for their exceptional work and contributions to architecture and society; only 3 percent of AIA members have this distinction. Congratulations to:\n\nRonald Abo\n\nAbimbola Asojo\n\nSanford Garner\n\nJames Garrett\n\nRavi GuneWardena\n\nDaniel-Christopher (Neil) Hall\n\nDouglas Hanson\n\nNathan Johnson\n\nNea Maloo\n\nKenneth Martin\n\nBrian Tibbs\n\nYoung Architects Award\n\nNOMA members Beresford Pratt, AIA, NOMA, Brien Graham, AIA, NOMA, NCARB and Jason Takeuchi, AIA, NOMA, NCARB were recipients of the 2023 American Institute of Architects (AIA) Young Architects Award. This award recognizes AIA members who have been licensed to practice architecture for fewer than 10 years by the submission deadline for their leadership and contributions to the profession, including environmental advocacy, increasing access to great design, and mentoring future architects.\n\nWhitney M Young Jr. Award\n\nRobert L. Easter, NOMAC, FAIA, was presented with the 2023 Whitney M. Young Jr. Award, an annual award that honors an architect or organization that champions a range of social issues. Learn more about his honor here.\n\nWe congratulate and honor all of these members for their contributions to their communities and the industry. This is only a small sample of member honors to date, we know there are many more, and would love to see them shouted out! Please promote your professional and member achievements on social media using #NOMAStandUp.\n\nBe revolutionary,\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nAssociate Principal, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nFollow up actions to the 6/29/23 joint Allied Organizations (AIA, AIAS, ACSA, NOMA) Response to SCOTUS Ruling on Affirmative Action in College Admissions\n\n2023 JUNE\n\nAs our nation celebrates Independence Day, a day symbolizing cherished values of freedom and sovereignty, we are confronted with the harsh reality of a socio-political climate that introduces and enacts legislation undermining the very principles of diversity and inclusivity we strive for. This juxtaposition highlights the inherent contradiction and challenges we face in our ongoing pursuit of true freedom and equality for all. The National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA) unequivocally denounces the Supreme Court’s ruling that selectively prohibits the use of race as a factor in college admissions. This decision fails to recognize the inherent disparities and systemic biases within our educational systems, representing a significant setback for equity, diversity, and inclusivity in higher education. Its potential impacts will ripple outwards to professions such as architecture, which already grapples with underrepresentation of minorities.\n\nNOMA firmly stands by its mission to champion diversity within the architecture profession by promoting excellence, community engagement, and the professional development of its members. This ruling is undeniably relevant to our organization, as it may further exacerbate the underrepresentation of certain minority groups within our profession. The impact on the future generation of architects who come from these minority communities cannot be understated.\n\nThe issue has understandably garnered widespread media coverage and public attention, which underscores the need for organizations like NOMA to voice their stand and influence the narrative. Now, more than ever, we need to advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusivity within the education system and, by extension, our profession.\n\nThis is not just a setback, but also a moment to come together to ensure that access to higher education and an architectural education is a possibility for the next generation of diverse architects. With collective action, resilience, and strategic partnerships, we can make a significant impact in advancing diversity and inclusivity within the architecture profession and beyond. We are committed to partnering with like-minded organizations that align with our mission to amplify our collective voice and provide actionable solutions. The journey towards achieving our mission may have become tougher, but our resolve is unwavering.\n\nNOMA will continue to seek ways to work together with universities where we have NOMAS chapters to navigate the implications of this policy change, and to ensure our NOMAS chapters have the ability to remain strong and diverse.\n\nNOMA will continue to advocate for a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive architecture industry. As we monitor and adapt our approach to these challenges, we encourage our members and allies to stand with us and share their ideas for action as we navigate these uncharted waters.\n\nTo review the Joint Statement released by NOMA, AIA, AIAS, and ACSA, click the link below.\n\nNOMA Project Pipeline Summer Camps – Inspiring Future Generations of Architects\n\n2023 MAY\n\nMore than 50 years since our founding, we still face the same challenge our NOMA founding members confronted- a lack of equal representation of Black and minority faces in the field of architecture. As a practicing Black female architect, I continuously ask myself why this is and what actions could be taken to drive a more equitable profession. NOMA members recognize that the essence of our profession lies in its connection to society. It involves actively engaging with all those affected by our designs, fostering collaboration, and incorporating all these voices and valuable insights into the manifestation of our designs.\n\nNOMA recognizes that mentorship is a critical component for licensureship and is one of our top priority initiatives. To support the next generation and enhance diversity, we must expand our programming and provide increased access to professional development opportunities for minority architects and architecture students. Recognizing that young African American students, in particular, often lack representation and consequently feel disconnected from the industry, we need to actively address this issue, ultimately empowering young, diverse students to envision themselves in the architecture industry and actively contribute to its future.\n\nPast NOMA President Paul Taylor realized this and began a commitment to mentorship and building the pipeline for minority architects that continues today called Project Pipeline Summer Camps. During the 2002 NOMA Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Mr. Taylor entrusted Mr. Drake Dillard and Mr. David Kirk with the task of researching and developing a program aimed at introducing minority students, with a particular focus on Black students, to the field of architecture. The objective was to cultivate a pathway that would lead to more licensed Black architects. Recognizing the importance of early exposure, it becomes crucial to inspire students from a young age to consider architecture and design as viable career options. By showcasing the impact and influence of design and highlighting the presence of architects who share their backgrounds, we can foster a sense of empowerment and create opportunities that encourage greater representation of Black and minority architects.\n\nIn 2006, the South West Ohio NOMA chapter organized the first camp in Cincinnati. Today, more than 20 cities have hosted hundreds of summer camps, introducing more than 20,000 young people to the career possibilities in architecture and design. In 2012, under the leadership of Bryan Lee Jr. and many others, a formal curriculum was established to guide host chapters across the country, followed by a digital version of the curriculum during the pandemic to enable Project Pipeline Virtual Summer Camps. The curriculum acquaints students with fundamental architecture and design concepts, encompassing topics such as comprehending the dynamics of cities and neighborhoods, honing sketching skills, gaining familiarity with basic design software, and exploring the various resources at their disposal to support their ongoing journey in the field of architecture and design.\n\nRichie Hands, NOMA National Chair of Project Pipeline and Bryan Bradshaw, NOMA, Assoc. AIA and NOMA National Co-Chair of Project Pipeline, oversee this important program that kicks-off in cities across the U.S. from June to August. This year, local chapters will host 27 camps across the country with support from NOMA members, community volunteers and sponsors.\n\nThe successful execution of programs like Project Pipeline Summer Camps relies on the dedication of NOMA members and invaluable partnerships such as the one with General Motors. Since 2017, General Motors has actively supported Project Pipeline Summer Camps and continues to be a committed partner in this transformative initiative. We express our gratitude for their generous contributions and unwavering support on a national level, as well as extend our appreciation to all the local partners who play a pivotal role in bringing Project Pipeline Summer Camps to life within their respective communities.\n\nYour active participation is crucial now. If your NOMA chapter hosts a camp, step forward and inquire about how you can contribute your time and volunteer to make a difference. In the event that your NOMA chapter does not currently offer a Project Pipeline Summer Camp, do not hesitate to reach out to the esteemed Chair, Richie Hands (richie.hands@noma.net), and the dedicated co-chair, Bryan Bradshaw (bryan.bradshaw@noma.net). They will guide and equip you with the knowledge to ignite this transformative endeavor in your community. Furthermore, your generous donations play a pivotal role in sustaining the momentum of this essential initiative. Together, through your active involvement, we have the power to shape the future and inspire a new generation of architects.\n\nOur collective goal is to ensure that every chapter organizes a camp, fostering inclusivity in architecture and design for students from diverse backgrounds. #NOMAStandUp!

Our leadership attended various industry meetings, including the NCARB Board meeting in Tucson, Arizona, and the Architecture Organization Alliance’s Six President’s Meeting in Washington, D.C. Amidst all of these trips, in March I made a special visit to our Executive Director, Tiffany Brown, in Detroit to plan for an incredible year ahead.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the launch of our new video series, “What’s Next with NOMA” which aims to provide insights into initiatives and events that impact our members and the industry. Our first segment is all about our upcoming conference, “Building Bridges Towards a Just and Joyful Future,” in Portland, Oregon. It’s a can’t-miss event that will be packed with opportunities to connect, learn, and grow as leaders.\n\nIn our video, Tiffany and I share our personal experiences and discuss the value of our first NOMA conferences and how they contributed to creating NOMA and industry leaders. We also touch on the impact of the conference on our personal journeys to leadership. We invite you to watch the video and join us in Portland to experience this transformative event for yourself.\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nAssociate Principal, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nHow Will You Support the Pipeline?\n\n2023 MARCH\n\nAs many of us can attest, receiving licensure in the United States is a long journey – there are years of education, experience, and exam requirements. The latest data from the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) shows it takes 13.8 years for African Americans to be ready for licensure– more than a year beyond their Asian counterparts. While we celebrate all demographics that rose in 2021, the proportion of new architects who identify as Black or African American has remained relatively stable in its meager numbers over the past five years.\n\nI am the 315th Black female architect to receive licensure in the United States.This number is incredibly meaningful to me as evidence of my success through NOMA, yet it is also a reminder of the uphill battle for equity and diversity that remains in our profession.\n\nThankfully, there are policy changes underway to create a more equitable profession. NCARB recently made a decision to eliminate the Architect Registration Examination (ARE) rolling clock policy. Although this decision will benefit the entire profession, according to NCARB, analysis showed that the policy disproportionately negatively impacted women and people of color. The Baseline on Belonging survey showed that minority architects were 25-30% more likely to fall off the path to licensure than their white counterparts, with the rolling clock identified as one of those barriers.\n\nWhile we celebrate this policy change, we recognize more changes must occur in order to further diversify the industry and increase the licensing of minority architects – particularly Black female architects who continue to make up less than .02% of the total architect population in the United States. These infrastructural obstacles include, financial investment, time commitment, a lack of diversity in our education and teaching staff, discriminatory practices and our unjust reputation as a procession to marginalized communities of color.\n\nLet’s take a moment to expand on four initiatives that can bolster the licensure for minority architects in general, and Black female architects specifically. In order to address these systematic challenges in our industry, we must hold the industry accountable, commit to creating a pipeline of talent, make a push on licensure in academia, and ensure support systems and resources are in place for a successful path to licensure.\n\nIndustry Accountability\n\nTo start, we must hold the profession accountable via established metrics and measurement to show where we are and map out where we want to go. Created in 1991 by Dennis A. Mann (University of Cincinnati) and Bradford C. Grant (Howard University), the Directory of African American Architects is a self-reporting database specifically developed to track Black architects who practice in the private or public sectors, teach in higher education, work in associated disciplines, or who have left the field of architecture but maintain their license in the United States. It is also used by architectural press and architectural education to demonstrate the disparities that exist in the industry. It allows us to track against the diversification goals, holding the industry accountable to make changes to positively influence the profession. It’s a powerful tool if we use it.\n\nNOMA now owns and manages the directory, and we have 2,499 self-reported licensed Black architects listed. Yet many are still unaware of the database’s existence. I encourage you to share this resource with your peers and review your local state to affirm your information is both included and current. If you notice someone missing, please reach out to them to make sure they know about the directory. This metric holds the industry accountable, and we must do our part to ensure the data is accurate. Let’s continue to work together to spread the word. We ask all licensed architects who identify as Black or African American to self-report and be part of our documented history.\n\nCommitment to Growing the Pipeline\n\nThe stagnant numbers speak for themselves. Only 2% of licensed architects in the United States are Black or African American. We don’t want to be the exception– we want to be the norm.\n\nNCARB reports that in 2021:\n\nOf the 60% of new NCARB record holders who identified as a race or ethnicity other than “white, non-Hispanic or Latino,” only 7% identified as Black or African American\n\nOnly 6% who took the Architect Registration Examination® (ARE®) were Black or African American\n\nThe proportion of candidates passing the ARE who identify as Black or African American is 2% and has not changed since 2017\n\nThe industry must partner with associations, governing bodies, academic institutions, and firms to create a pipeline of talent representative of Black and African Americans. NOMA and the AIA Large Firm Roundtable (LFRT) began working together in 2017. In 2020, under the leadership of NOMA Past President Kim Dowdell (2019-2020) and the AIA LFRT, the 2030 Diversity Challenge was announced. The initiative calls for us to more than double the number of licensed Black architects from 2,300 to 5,000 by 2030, increasing representation from a mere 2% to roughly 4%. While this number falls short of matching the 14% Black population in the U.S., this commitment begins the work to change the face of the industry. We have the pipeline in place to reach this goal. But it will take the support of our membership and the industry to encourage all those in the pipeline to successfully achieve licensure.\n\nMaking a push on Licensure in Academia\n\nThe National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) data shows that over 8,200 new students enrolled in a NAAB-accredited program in the 2020-2021 school year—a 3% increase from the previous school year – with nearly 28,000 students enrolled in a NAAB-accredited program that same school year. In 2021, 6,275 degrees were awarded by NAAB-accredited programs across the country, a 3% increase compared to the previous school year. The profession is growing but is it attracting a diverse set of new candidates?\n\nOne programmatic solution to reducing the time from graduation to licensure is the Integrated Path to Architectural Licensure (IPAL) which allows students to continue their education while undergoing the internship, shortening the path to licensure. By enrolling in an IPAL option, students in the process of earning a degree from a NAAB-accredited program can complete the Architectural Experience Program® (AXP®) and the ARE concurrently. IPAL is incorporated as an optional path within an existing NAAB-accredited program, allowing architecture schools to integrate licensure requirements into their own curricula.\n\nSince the program launched in 2015, NCARB has accepted 31 NAAB-accredited programs at 25 schools to participate in the IPAL initiative. As of the 2020-2021 school year, over 600 students have enrolled in IPAL options across the United States. In 2018, several schools saw the graduation of their first IPAL students, including Boston Architectural College, North Carolina State University, and the University of Florida CityLab-Orlando. This program will appeal to anyone of any ethnicity who wants or needs to become an architect more quickly by reducing the time to licensure.\n\nSupport Systems to Licensure: Study Materials and Support\n\nThe aforementioned data states only 6% of Black and African Americans are taking the ARE, with just 2% passing. Studies outline the reasons prohibiting the increase of these numbers, including actual time (time to study, prepare, take the exams and for many, retake the exams), support from firm employers, and the financial burden.\n\nAccording to EduMind, an online provider of training courses, it costs between $2,400-$6,500, on average, to become a licensed architect through the ARE process. This includes the cost of exams, the NCARB initial Record Fee, and preparation materials. NOMA is working with organizations that offer study tools and materials at a reduced rate.\n\nMentorship: Supporting Those in the Process\n\nFinally, one of the biggest obstacles to attracting young Black professionals to architecture is that students aren’t aware that architecture is a profession for them. You can’t be what you can’t see. For those of us who have made it into this profession, we must reach out to those who show talent and an interest in the field to support and encourage exam completion. This is at the heart of NOMA´s mission – to provide support to one another, to find the resources to make change possible, and to work alongside our allies in the field to continue to make policy changes that support diversity in architecture. For those NOMA members who are licensed architects, I encourage you to serve as a mentor to those along the path to licensure. Encouragement and solidarity are important in a profession that remains undiversified.\n\n#NOMAStandUp and help us achieve the 2030 Diversity Challenge. I am unabashedly confident that we can change the face of this industry, but it will take all of us, working together.\n\nBe revolutionary,\n\nPascale Sablan, FAIA, NOMA, LEED AP\n\nNOMA President 2023-2024\n\nAssociate Principal, Adjaye Associates\n\nAIA Whitney M. Young Jr. Award Recipient 2021\n\nAIA Equity and the Future of Architecture Committee Member\n\nStand Up: What will you stand for?\n\n2023 FEBRUARY\n\nIn 1976, President Gerald Ford mandated that the month of February would be recognized as Black History Month going forward. As part of the U.S. Bicentennial, this commemoration recognized the contributions of Black Americans, and specifically honored Carter G. Woodson, a Harvard-trained academic and historian. Black History Month replaced “Negro History Week,” which Woodson, in partnership with the organization he founded, The Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, conceived in 1925 as a nation-wide commemoration of African Americans.\n\nAs an organization committed to diversifying the architecture and design industry, eradicating the effects of racism, and increasing the licensure of Black and minority architects, NOMA serves to propel our profession and diversify the field for the future. Equally important, NOMA acts as a platform for members to address issues of race and discrimination within their local communities. NOMA, take a stand against injustice, use our collective voice, rooted in the knowledge of our past, while understanding our present condition, and take action towards a just and better future.\n\nPast\n\nRecognizing Our Own History\n\nOver the past few years the late and beloved Prescott Reavis (1972-2022), NOMA, NCARB, LEED AP, SEEDtook over the NOMA social media account and dedicated Black History Month social posts to beloved Black architects in our profession. There is no way for us to fill the void in our lives left by his passing, however, we celebrate and honor his legacy. As the creator of “Looking Black,” a content series celebrating past, present, and future Black architects for Black History Month, Prescott worked diligently to ensure we remember those who pioneered the path.\n\nToday and everyday, we are grateful for his contributions to NOMA and the profession. As a tribute to Prescott and Black architects of our past, we are sharing Prescott’s research work this month. Please keep Prescott and his family in your thoughts and prayers. Prescott, we thank you for always lifting up our voices.\n\nI am inspired by current and historic architects who have transformed the industry. This month in particular, I encourage you to share architects and designers that inspire you to enact the change you want to see on NOMA Connect or on your personal social channels and tag @NOMAnational.\n\nPresent\n\nAs the 6th member of the Architecture Organization Alliance (ACSA, AIA, AIAS, NAAB & NCARB, NOMA) we are working in partnership to drive change.\n\nTackling systemic issues requires the collaboration and commitment of professional organizations, businesses, and industry leaders. In 2020, in partnership with the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB), we developed and launched the Baseline on Belonging survey and resulting focus groups to better understand how to increase the licensure of Black and minority architects. Together, we sought to learn more about the challenges Black and minority architects face in order to develop effective solutions.\n\nThis data revealed minority architects were 25-30% more likely to fall off the path than their white counterparts. The research aims to understand why this happens in order to figure out what supports are needed to minimize or prevent this. The survey was distributed to nearly 70,000 individuals. The survey received a total of 6,902 responses (complete and partial). The survey results include over 13,000 open text responses from optional comment questions.\n\nView the full findings 1-5 here. We sincerely thank all who participated in 2020. We encourage the NOMA members to explore the reports and help strategize solutions for the challenges that are directly impacting you and your professional goals. We are working with your local NOMA chapter leaders and our partners of the Architecture Organization Alliance to develop a refined action plan against the findings and look forward to sharing with the organization shortly. Please take this 5 minute survey to let us know how the progress of the study has resonated with you.\n\nFuture\n\nWe advocate for our members and leverage partnerships to develop programs that directly serve our NOMA Mission.\n\nEstablished in 2020, our NFF Program (previously NOMA Foundation Fellowships and undergoing new branding in 2023) aids in increasing the number of diverse licensed architects and works to eliminate the barriers to enter the profession. The fellowship program was developed and sustained by our partnership with the AIA Large Firm Roundtable (LFRT), which matches undergraduate students and recent graduates with top architecture and design firms for an 8-week paid professional internship, with the intention of breaking down the barriers to licensure by providing fellows with valuable professional experience and preparation for licensure.\n\nSince 2020, NOMA has:\n\nAwarded 81 fellowships\n\nWorked with 40+ top architecture firms in the United States\n\nReceived nearly 200 fellowship applicants\n\nNFF has re-launched and is recruiting for our fifth cohort of fellows. I encourage you to share details about this impactful paid internship program with your network. Active NOMAS students are eligible. The application deadline is March 10, 2023.\n\nDue to NFF’s overwhelming success and a significant expansion, the program will be managed by our incredible NOMA staff going forward.
