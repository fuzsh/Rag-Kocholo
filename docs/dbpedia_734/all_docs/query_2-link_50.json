        "text": "In the first game of a doubleheader, you really want to avoid too much drama. Jump on the starter, force him out early, tack on some runs, and lock the win up cleanly. Whatever happens in game two, the Yankees followed that formula exactly in today’s win over the Angels, a brisk, businesslike 5-2 victory.\n\nIt was a bit of a downer day for Luis Gil, who had to be quite thankful that he was facing the Angels — and the Angels without Mike Trout at that. The righty walked five men in five innings, needing 56 pitches to get through the first two frames. He may need a quick phone call with Luis Severino, since a huge part of his problem was bad slider command:\n\nYou can see those sliders up and armside, and the easy takes falling away gloveside. These easy takes lead into those sliders right in the heart of the plate, where Gil is lucky they were fouled off and not put in Monument Park. Gil does throw the slider in the zone quite a bit, but with better command those easy takes are more likely to be whiffs, so you can work the edges of the zone more.\n\nAmusingly enough, Gil’s best inning was the fifth, coming in with 92 pitches after I thought that manager Aaron Boone would have given him the hook. It took him 15 chucks to work a clean frame with a strikeout, getting himself in line for the win.\n\nFortunately for Gil, the offense was able to pick up their young starter. Davis Daniel did have some walk trouble of his own, a rare thing given his control, with a pair of free passes in his 3.1 innings of work. Alex Verdugo led off the home half of the first with an automatic double, and the Angels unintentionally-intentionally walked Aaron Judge to put the onus on Austin Wells:\n\nWe know that Jose Trevino will return to the Yankees, but I have to hope the Yankees either shift Wells into a DH role or even give him a first-base glove in games where he doesn’t start. His fielding has taken a big step forward this year, but he is the best-hitting catcher in the AL since June 1st. A 149 wRC+ needs to be in the lineup every day, regardless of how good Trevy’s framing is.\n\nSpeaking of guys who have turned on the jets of late, Anthony Volpe stayed hot with an RBI double two batters after Wells.\n\nIt’s a good thing to pull your fly balls, regardless of whether you’re a “power hitter” or not. We’ll have more on Volpe’s approach since the All-Star break later this week, but these are the kinds of balls he needs to do damage on, and he has been lately.\n\nThe youngsters continued to put up runs, with Oswaldo Cabrera going deep in the third, right about the same time I was taking delivery on new boots:\n\nI hope Waldo enjoyed that dinger because he was robbed of a base hit a couple innings later, due to a nifty play by Zach Neto.\n\nJudge was intentionally walked in the eighth inning, but he did get his own taste of revenge in the fourth with an RBI single, following up on Alex Verdugo’s second double of the day. That single made it 5-0 and that was all the Yankees would push across the rest of the game.\n\nJake Cousins did give up a two-run home run to Neto in the seventh, making the front half of the doubleheader slightly more interesting. Cousins has been really good with the Yankees this year, but these things happen. Luke Weaver and Clay Holmes locked down the eighth and ninth, meaning the only damage was done to Cousins’ ego, and netting out a boost to my fantasy team — though they might also be unavailable for the nightcap.\n\nThe Yankees play again at 7:35pm ET, on Amazon Prime. Will Warren, today’s 27th man, will make his second MLB start for New York. Carlos Fulmer gets the ball for Halos as they try to avoid a doubleheader sweep."
