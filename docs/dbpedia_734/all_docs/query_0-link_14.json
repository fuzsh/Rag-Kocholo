        "text": "On December 17, the First Flight Society hosted a celebration recognizing the 119th anniversary of the first powered and controlled flight, the 75th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force and the induction of GEN Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. ’36 into the Paul E. Garber First Flight Shrine. The event took place at the Wright Brothers’ National Memorial. The ceremony included remarks from the National Park Service, First Flight Society, Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site and GEN Davis Jr.’s ’36 great nephew Doug Melville. Gen. Mark D. Kelly, commander of Air Combat Command, delivered the keynote speech about the 75th Anniversary of the Air Force, the impact the Wright Brothers had on modern aviation and the legacy GEN Davis ’36 left for modern Airmen. “No Airman embodies the idea of thriving in the warrior spirit of our Air Force with a past or present more so than our honoree today, GEN Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. ’36,” said Kelly. “I think GEN Davis ’36 is the epitome of what we call today ‘empowered Airman,’ and in turn, he empowered other Airmen to give us the competitive edge we still enjoy over our adversaries.” Read more."
