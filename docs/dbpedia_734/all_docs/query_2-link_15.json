        "text": "National Hispanic Heritage Month is observed annually from September 15 to October 15 to honor and celebrate the generations of Hispanic and Latino Americans who have contributed so much to our nation’s history, culture and achievements. We recognize that the Army and USACE stories cannot be told without acknowledging the remarkable service and sacrifices made by Hispanic and Latino American Soldiers and civilians. This year’s national theme, “Latinos: Driving Prosperity, Power and Progress in America,” captures the spirit and contributions of generations of Hispanic and Latino Americans who have served and continue to serve the nation in all walks of life. Hispanic and Latino Americans have shaped and enhanced our national character with centuries-old traditions that reflect the multi-ethnic and multicultural customs of their communities. They make up 17% of America’s Soldiers and 7% of Army Civilians. The Army recognizes not only the importance of Hispanic and Latino representation among our military and civilian forces, but also their value in helping to establish a culture of diversity and inclusion. As we reflect and celebrate throughout this month-long recognition, let us also reinforce our continuing commitment to building cohesive USACE teams and cultivating environments that are diverse, equitable, and inclusive for all.

During WWII, the Tuskegee Airmen were a group of African-American airmen in the United States Air Force who’d been trained in Tuskegee, Alabama. Tuskegee was the only school for black pilots until its closure in 1946. The photo shown features members of the 332nd Fighter Group in Ramitelli, Italy, commonly referred to as the “Red Tails” due to the distinct red paint on the tails of their fighter planes. The 332nd was tasked with escorting American bombers over Italy, and were often requested specifically by these bombers. The Tuskegee Airmen had one of the lowest loss records of any escort fighter group. However, these men were not the first African-American airmen to face combat. Decades prior, Eugene Jacques Bullard was the only African-American pilot to fly in WWI, and is thought to be the first African-American military pilot to fly in combat. These brave airmen fought for the freedom of others, risking their lives, before they were fully afforded equal rights. Bugeye Technologies strives to recognize the extraordinary contributions, achievements, and lives of African-Americans throughout not only Black History Month, but the entire year. This commitment aligns with our broader mission to support and enhance the training of warfighters like these in the fight to protect freedom worldwide. May this month be a reminder of the ongoing journey toward equality, unity, and understanding. #BlackHistoryMonth #BlackHistory #CelebratingBlackHistory #TuskegeeAirmen #WWIIHistory #Aviation #Aerospace #FlightSimulation #FlightSim #Bugeye #BugeyeTechnologies\n\nTHE LEADER TRUSTS FIRST Maj. Gen. Cameron Holt (ret., USAF), the immediate past the past Deputy Assistant Secretary of the US Air Force, has spent over three decades leading in the US military, instituting major changes and leaving a lasting impact. So, when he speaks, people learn. His most profound lesson? Trust is earned, not given. According to Holt, loyalty to your employer is owed, but trust must be earned through behavior. And who should initiate this trust? The leader. The leader should trust first. The results of Holt's philosophy were evident at a USAF conference where I had the privilege to give a keynote speech. Many hundreds of officers were attending. I talked to many of them. To the last man and woman, they would go through fire for him. Remember, trust is not something that can be demanded or commanded. It must be earned. As a leader, you need to take the first step in building trust with your team by expressing trust in them through word and action. Give them challenging tasks and don't micromanage how they accomplish it. Be there for advice and support. It will do wonders. #leadership #trust #teamwork If you enjoyed this, share it with others and follow me Jan-Benedict Steenkamp for more writing.\n\nWhen I think of David Goggins I think of myself at my very weakest. And a man I didn't know could even exist... appeared. And screamed at me with words on a page. To be better. Do better. Dream more. To drink his suffering and become a better person. The way he describes his upbringing made me tougher and more resilient. I am not a black American. But my God David Goggins screamed at me like I knew his pain. And the way he described his life? I was totally defenceless. Disarmed. How can anyone not be? Read Can't Hurt Me and try not to feel. It's not possible. That book breaks you down. Patience. Consistency. Discipline. When I think about what it takes to be great? At playing the violin, or studying until 5am at the library - or recording an album until everyone involved is falling asleep and one of us might crash the car on the way home. These are the three key ingredients. No mentor worth their salt is about breaking you down without building you right back up and turning you into an invincible war machine of a person. And that's what David Goggins does. I am glad to have met a few women who have learned David's message because I would like to think it's for everyone. The kind of patience David cultivates? Unbeatable. And, the very same patience all of my favourite artists have. From the Russian violinist David Oistrakh to Charlie Chaplin - to our era's reigning pop queen Taylor Alison Swift. Watch their patience. It is endless. Mine too. Consistency? Have you heard Larry David talk about his writing process for Seinfeld? He would literally RUN back to his office to make changes. Me too. After I heard that? Naturally. Why wouldn't I? He's my hero. Have you heard Jerry talk about how long it takes to craft his famously streamlined and perfectly conceived jokes? He is a social scientist; the most scientific comic of all time. His deconstructions of processes were the very basis for the inception of Seinfeld. At least, the very way he and Larry would deconstruct the ideas of items in a Korean supermarket in an amusing way. The nuts and bolts of things: amusing fact and theory and query by amusing fact and theory and query. How about Paul McCartney's recording process when he was in the Beatles? So gruelling it pissed off the other Beatles. Even John. No one in the Beatles cared as much as Paul about process. So? Incidentally, he was the first billionaire musician ever. Incidentally.... Discipline. Do you know who has energy for bullshit? Undisciplined people. Me when I'm undisciplined. You when you're undisciplined. Anyone. 'Idle hands' have the WORST reputation of any hands in all of human history. Why? Guess. Alcoholics need someone to scream and screech at. So do lazy people who expect wild and instant success. So do artists with no gumption. And accountants with no drive! But truly. You need discipline to practice, compose, record, release, tour, interview and repeat. Watch carefully. The most successful don't complain."
