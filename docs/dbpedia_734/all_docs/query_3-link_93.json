        "text": "AMC has promoted Ben Davis to senior vp scripted programming. The creative exec in charge of such network tentpoles as Breaking Bad and Mad Men, Davis has climbed within the programming department since joining in 2005.\n\n“Ben is a talented executive who joined AMC just as the network was beginning its original programming transformation, and he has played a significant role in our success,” said AMC senior vp scripted development and current programming Susie Fitzgerald, to whom Davis will continue to report. “We are pleased to recognize the contributions he has made across many iconic AMC series, and his continuing work in helping to develop the next generation of AMC programming, with this well-deserved promotion.”\n\nA member of The Hollywood Reporter‘s Next Gen class of 2013, Davis has been critical in AMC’s evolution into a scripted power player — with Breaking Bad and Mad Men serving as two of the most critically favored dramas of the last decade.\n\nHe was part of the team behind miniseries Broken Trail, oversaw day-to-day on the first three seasons of The Killing and was instrumental in the development of TV’s No. 1 show: The Walking Dead. In his new role, he will be responsible for helping manage existing productions as well as AMC’s scripted programming development slate.\n\nHis latest projects include developing the pilots of Halt and Catch Fire and Turn — both of which premiere this year. He is also supervising creative development for the Breaking Bad spinoff, Better Call Saul."
