        "text": "Legacy of Valor: The Tuskegee Airmen\n\nIn reading the article “The Tuskegee Airmen, Heroes of War and Peace” by Daniel L. Haulman [January/February, p. 41], I was surprised and disappointed to see such a lack of credit for the accomplishments of Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. in it. Our First Flight Society inducted General Davis Jr. as the 2022 Honoree of our Paul E. Garber Shrine at the Wright Brothers National Memorial at Kitty Hawk, N.C., on Dec. 17, 2022.\n\nAn important part of our decision to recognize him as the Honoree was the part he played not only as a combat leader, but for being an outstanding leader in the integration of the U. S. Air Force beginning in 1948 when he played a key role. Then-Colonel Davis served as an adviser to both the Air Force DCS/Personnel on their study on USAF racial policies and practices, and the Fahy Committee to establish the formal Air Force integration policy. Thereby playing a key role in the Air Force becoming the first branch of the Armed Forces to integrate.\n\nIn “Makers of the United States Air Force” by John L. Frisbee which focuses on the 12 Leaders “whose careers spanned the life of the Air Force and who filled with distinction a variety of roles in its evolution,” he is one of those 12. One of the things it points out is that it was not a “War Department study” that allowed the Tuskegee Airmen to stay in combat but the testimony of General (then Colonel) Davis Jr. before a committee that did.\n\n“Davis’ articulate defense helped convince the committee, and through it the highest U.S. Army leadership that the Tuskegee Airmen deserved more time to prove themselves. General Marshall agreed that the 99th should not be removed from combat on the little evidence presented by the Army Air Forces.” This author concludes that on the integration of the Air Force, “Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. can claim a larger measure of credit for inaugurating this critical reform than any other person. For that pioneering accomplishment, America stands in his debt.”\n\nAs to Haulman’s, “It is very possible that one reason the 332nd Fighter Group lost fewer bombers to enemy airplanes than the other escort groups is that its pilots were ordered not to leave the bombers to go chasing after enemy fighters;” I had the honor of spending quite a bit of time with Brig. General Charles McGee, who was unequivocal on the discipline laid down by General Davis Jr. to stay with the bombers and getting back to them after driving off attacking German fighters until they were clear of further potential attacks. There was clearly a reason that General Davis’ P-51 carried the name “By Request.”\n\nHaulman nears the end of his article transitioning to, “Many of the Tuskegee Airmen elected to remain in the Air Force after 1949, some of them flying combat missions in Korea and Vietnam” and failing to cite any of the postwar accomplishments by Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. at all, let alone his key role in integrating the Air Force as previously cited.\n\nWe were proud to have a video message from Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr. for our event in which he paid honor to the leadership of General Davis Jr. both as an inspiration to him and for his part in leading the integration effort within the Department of Defense. Our keynote speaker for the event, Gen. Mark D. Kelly, Air Combat Command Commander, commented that “No Airman embodies the idea of thriving in the warrior spirit of our Air Force with a past or present more so than our honoree today, Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. I think General Davis is the epitome of what we call today ‘empowered Airman,’ and in turn, he empowered other Airmen to give us the competitive edge we still enjoy over our adversaries.” I think that these current Air Force leaders get what both the Tuskegee Airmen and Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. meant to today’s Air Force.\n\nFor myself, and only myself, I finally take issue with Haulman’s supposition at the close of his article that, “We should remember the Tuskegee Airmen story as a Black and White story, a story of American military personnel who served their country and furthered the great principle that all men are created equal.” Returning to “Makers of the United States Air Force” on the postwar integration of the Air Force, the author cites, “Even after integration took place, Benjamin O. Davis Jr.’s career was still shaped by race, for no one would expect that all prejudice stopped when the Air Force formally ended segregation.\n\n“The official sanctions and discriminations ended, but the Air Force was composed of thousands of people whose attitudes had been conditioned by prejudice, and although institutional bigotry ended, personal prejudice was much harder to uproot. Unquestionably race played a role in General Davis’ post-integration career. Both he and Mrs. Davis enjoyed overseas assignments where they met less racial discrimination than in the States. But it was overseas, most importantly, that the Air Force was willing to use Davis as a commander.\n\nAll of his commands after Air Force integration were overseas, despite his outstanding record as a commander. The Air Force apparently believed that the time was right for senior Black commanders, but not in the United States.” My reading of his autobiography, “Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.: American,” is that clearly his early, voluntary Air Force retirement was a result of asking for a more demanding job of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and being offered nothing—so it was time to move on.\n\nFor the Tuskegee Airmen that continued in the Air Force, it continued to be a “Black and White story” of their determination to excel and is probably best reflected in both Benjamin O. Davis Jr. and Charles E. McGee receiving promotions deserved only after their retirement.\n\nLt. Col. R. William Douglas,\n\nUSAF (Ret.)\n\nHolly Springs, N.C."
