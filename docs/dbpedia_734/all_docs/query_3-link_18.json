        "text": "The First Flight Society recently hosted a celebration recognizing the 119th anniversary of the first powered and controlled flight, the 75th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force and the induction of Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. into the Paul E. Garber First Flight Shrine. The event took place at the Wright Brothers’ National Memorial, North Carolina.\n\nThe ceremony included remarks from the National Park Service, First Flight Society, Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site and Davis Jr.’s great nephew, Doug Melville. Gen. Mark Kelly, commander of Air Combat Command, delivered the keynote speech about the 75th anniversary of the Air Force, the impact the Wright Brothers had on modern aviation and the legacy Davis Jr. left for modern Airmen.\n\n“We are the most feared and revered Air Force in the world because of those who have gone before us, particularly those who weren’t afraid to break barriers, weren’t afraid to think differently, and weren’t afraid to be different,” Kelly said. “The Wright Brothers and Gen. Davis clearly were not afraid to break barriers.”\n\nThe theme of the Air Force’ 75th anniversary is, “Innovate, Accelerate and Thrive – The Air Force at 75.” Through this theme, the Air Force calls on Airmen to innovate in how they train and employ their squadrons, develop capabilities and continue to move toward a more effective Air Force. The Air Force accelerates through rapid changes in technology and demands placed on air superiority; global strike; rapid global mobility; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and command and control.\n\nUltimately, the service thrives because of empowered Airmen unafraid to forge their own path.\n\nDavis Jr., an aviation pioneer, was the first Black man to graduate from West Point since 1889, a member of the first aviation cadet training class at Tuskegee Army Airfield, and the first Black pilot to solo a U.S. Army aircraft. With Davis as commander of the Tuskegee Airmen, the “Red Tails,” compiled an outstanding combat record against the Luftwaffe in World War II. At the start of WW II, Davis and his father Brig. Gen. Benjamin O. Davis, were the only two Black officers in the military who weren’t chaplains and later they became the first two Black generals.\n\nOn Dec. 9, 1998, Davis Jr. became the first Black officer to receive a fourth star in retirement. Leaders of firsts, Davis Jr. and his father carefully and strategically navigated a difficult time in American history."
