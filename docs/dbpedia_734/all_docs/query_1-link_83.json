        "text": "Military Career\n\nU.S. Army general and soldier Benjamin Oliver Davis, Sr. was born on July 1, 1877, in Washington, D.C. Breaking new ground, Davis became the first African-American general in the United States Army. He began his military career as a volunteer during the Spanish-American War in 1898. Receiving his commission in 1901, Davis was made a second lieutenant in the regular army. Despite the widespread prejudice against African-Americans, he rose up the ranks, becoming a brigadier general in 1940.\n\nActivism\n\nDuring his decades of military service, Davis spent much of his time teaching others as a professor of military science and tactics at Wilberforce University in Ohio and the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He also served tours of duty around the world, including in the Philippines and Liberia. During World War II, he held many posts, including assistant to the Inspector General. One of his most crucial roles at this time was an adviser on African-American issues in Europe.\n\nHis son, Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., followed his father’s footsteps, also becoming a general in the U.S. Air Force.\n\nSource: biography.com"
