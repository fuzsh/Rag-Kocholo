        "text": "Homer Dewitt Coleman, Jr., age 85, passed away peacefully September 22, 2021 in Centerville, Texas.\n\nHomer Dewitt Coleman Jr, affectionately known as “Homer”, was born in Middleton Texas on August 9, 1936, the only child of Dewitt Coleman and Nona Jo Hill Coleman. He was a lifelong resident of Middleton and a true product of Leon County, one of his life-long loves.\n\nA fifth generation of Leon County, he grew up with a true passion for farming and ranching, just as his forefathers had.\n\nHomer grew up in the Middleton community in its hey-day when the entire community was a family-run institution by the Coleman and McCoy Families. At the time of his childhood , Middleton boasted a General Store, Post Office, Canning House, Ice House, Mechanics Garage, Bus Shed, Church of Christ and a Cattle Dipping vat. He would often reminisce that Saturday’s were a big day in Middleton with everyone coming to town.\n\nAlthough an only child, he grew up with a group of _very special cousins as if they were siblings. Among them, Jeffie McCoy Hillman, Mollie McCoy Peters, Clint McCoy, Elizabeth “Daught” Leathers Millican, Sam Wayne Leathers and Linda Kay Coleman Harvell, and a very special friend, \"Squirrel,\" Willie L. Hopkins.\n\nAt an early age, Homer attended Middleton Church of Christ then as a young adult was a member of the First Baptist Church of Centerville. He later attended Calvary Baptist Church, Leona Baptist Church and in his final years , Cowboy Church of Leon County.\n\nUpon graduation from Centerville High, He attended Tarleton State University and also Sam Houston State University.\n\nAt the time of his engagement to our mother, Linda Harrison Coleman, Homer was driving a school bus for Centerville Schools while working with the family in MIddleton. He and our mother Linda resided in Centerville for a short time, then relocated to Houston while he held a position with Chevrolet Corporation. While residing in Houston, their first two children were born, Carlynn and Benny. They soon returned to the country as Homer insisted that his parents were getting older and needed help. His parents were in their mere 40’s at the time and certainly needed no help, but he used this as an excuse to return to his beloved Leon County.\n\nUpon returning, they settled in Middleton, and Homer took a sales position with Parker Chevrolet Dealership in Centerville. Within several years, he took a position with the Texas Department of Corrections, where he was promoted as Personnel Director and retained that position for many years. His youngest child, DeAnne was born during his early years with Texas Department of Corrections.\n\nWhile enjoying and appreciating his position of work, his true love remained farming and ranching. He was known far and wide for his award winning corn and watermelon crops.\n\nIn 1981, he resigned his position to re-open the Middleton Coleman Store, having been closed since 1964. During this period, he held court daily at the store, amusing anyone who would be there. He had such a love of his place of business and friends, that he would barely close on holidays. He’d lock the doors, run to the house to eat and open gifts, then back to his store. The store sadly closed upon the death of his mother in 1989.\n\nHomer spent his remaining years, farming, ranching, dancing, and entertaining family and friends with tons of amusing stories. He always had a great sense of humor, a true practical joker and friend to all. His constant companion and side-kick John T Gresham, would re-tell the same stories daily for anyone who would listen. No matter where he traveled, he never met a stranger.\n\nHe was amazingly able to spend 85 years in the same community that he loved dearly. Upon receiving a sizeable oil income numerous years ago, it was suggested by a female companion that he think about traveling to Italy. Homer politely reminded her that he had no interest in traveling any further than Leon County.\n\nWe rejoice in his life and mourn his passing. Middleton Texas is a quieter place now, but better for having known him.\n\nHomer was preceded in death by both of his parents and first wife, Linda Harrison Coleman Tampke.\n\nSurviving family includes children, Carlynn (Keith) Gardner of Middleton, Ben (Michael) Coleman of Dallas and DeAnne (Don) Craft of Middleton; daughter-in-law, Shawn Coleman of Galveston; grandchildren, Clint (Amy) Gardner of Tolar, Colby Gardner of Gainesville, GA, Andrew (Melissa) Coleman of Galveston, India Coleman (Zach) of Austin, Aeryn Craft of Middleton and Ivory Myers (Stacy) of Boerne and great-grandchildren, Lane, Landry and Hayden Gardner and Scarlett Coleman. Homer is also survived by a host of extended family and friends.\n\nA funeral service honoring Homer's life will be held 2 P.M., Saturday, September 25, 2021 at the Cowboy Church of Leon County. Pastor Tuffy Loftin will officiate the service assisted by Clint & Colby Gardner. A committal service will follow at Pleasant Ridge Cemetery. The Coleman family will receive friends from 5 P.M. to 7 P.M., Friday, September 24th at Walters Funeral Home, Centerville, Texas.\n\nPallbearers: Clint Gardner, Colby Gardner, Andrew Coleman, Jim Hill, Bubba Norman, James Dunn, Jerry Leathers, Andy Leathers\n\nHonorary Pallbearers: Roy Davis, Don Payne, Larry Wells, Charles Barnes, \"Squirrel\" Hopkins, Damon Harrison, Wayne Neyland, Ronnie Langley, Fred Allen Wells, Freddie King, Don Rose, Tracy Peters\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Alzheimer's Association, Cowboy Church of Leon County, Pleasant Ridge Cemetery Association or S.P.C.A.\n\nArrangements are under the direction of Walters Funeral Home, Centerville, Texas."
