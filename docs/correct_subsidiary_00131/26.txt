Oracle is to acquire Lodestar, which develops meter data management and energy systems for the utilities, adding to its existing industry applications acquired through SPL WorldGroup.

“With the addition of Lodestar’s products, Oracle plans to deliver the most comprehensive suite of mission-critical operational systems for all segments of the utilities industry,” says Larry Hagewood, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Utilities Global Business Unit. He says it will combine meter data management, load profiling, pricing, marketing, sales, customer care, billing, analytics and management of the networks, work force, assets and business-to-business transactions. “Oracle is putting utilities in control by simplifying their infrastructure, enabling greater business insight, aiding process improvement and increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty” he adds. “We expect our combined solutions will help facilitate the transformation of utilities to leading-edge infrastructure that creates operational efficiencies and competitive advantage for our customers.”
