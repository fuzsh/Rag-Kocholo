        "text": "I am thrilled to welcome pioneering utility software architect and leader John Hovan to the Triniti family as of today. John comes to us after leading Oracle Utilities software projects and supporting client deployments for 28 years, having joined Oracle as an original member of the LODESTAR team via their acquisition in 2007. Among his many accomplishments while at Oracle, he led the work to move the Oracle Utilities products Meter Data Management, Smart Grid, Gateway, and Service Order Management to the cloud, and supported the first Oracle client to go live on Oracle Customer Cloud Service (CCS).\n\nWe’re excited to bring John’s unparalleled software expertise, his rich first-hand experience on such a wide array of deployments and challenges, and his love for bringing the best out of the people he works with to bear for our clients as well as our plans as a team.\n\nJohn’s career tracks closely with the origins of many of the tools our clients depend on every day. His work in the field began as an individual contributor at The Analytic Science Corporation (TASC), which spun out a group called Utilities Marketing Services in the mid-90’s, and in 1998 changed its name to LODESTAR. John developed many of LODESTAR’s original components. He built the entire design for the database access layer, identified the need for and then built the metadata layer, and then was instrumental in performance tuning. By the time LODESTAR was acquired by Oracle, his role at the company was so outsized that it took three titles to encapsulate it: SVP, Chief Technology Officer, and Chief Software Architect.\n\nWhen I asked him what he is most proud of in his work, he said it’s the relationships he has built and sustained with colleagues over the years. All of the folks who came over to Oracle with him from LODESTAR stayed on with him throughout his entire tenure at Oracle. That speaks volumes about his qualities as a leader and colleague, especially given the natural attrition at any large company. And he still keeps in touch with folks he worked with at his very first job out of undergrad at Raytheon, almost 30 years later. Those relationships are a point of pride for John, and they’re one of the many attributes that demonstrate his strength of character and make him such a good fit for Triniti. The importance of cultivating strong positive relationships is central to our culture and one of the elements that sets us apart in our engagements.\n\nJohn was inspired to move into consulting with Triniti after his experiences on all of the Oracle Utilities cloud (CCS and MSCS) customer engagements at Oracle this past year. As he explains it, he saw the value he could add first-hand in working with various consulting firms, and soon recognized what he wanted as his next big career focus. He has always preferred boutique consulting companies over large ones, having left Raytheon early on for a small startup, and then thriving in his years at LODESTAR. He says Triniti was at the top of his short list after his experiences working with us at Oracle, knowing that several of our team has come from the same LODESTAR and Oracle pedigree, and given his strong long-standing relationships with our team.\n\nWe can’t wait to meet John’s whole family in person, his wife Bridget and their six children who are all pursuing degrees in various disciplines. When travel conditions allow it, we look forward to an extra special in-person all-hands and a proper toast to welcome him to Triniti."
