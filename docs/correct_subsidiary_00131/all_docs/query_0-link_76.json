        "text": "We recognise the challenges of Net Zero, and the need for new baseload energy technologies to complement our intermittent renewables. The SEI will lead the development of Space Based Solar Power for the UK, offering large scale, safe, and secure energy day and night, through all seasons and weather. Through a structured and collaborative programme of design, research and technology demonstration, the SEI will promote integration and innovation between Space, Energy, Digital, and Manufacturing ecosystems.\n\nClimate change and the pressures on global energy resources are urgent problems.\n\nThe UK has set out an ambitious national clean energy policy – Net Zero – to fully decarbonise the economy by 2050. This future energy scenario requires clean and sustainable energy generation from renewable sources for homes and industry. This energy generation must at the same time remain affordable, reliable and secure if our economy is to thrive.\n\nSpace Based Solar Power offers a range of characteristics which could help the UK deliver Net Zero, with a new source of abundant, sustainable power. SBSP is the concept of harvesting free solar energy in space, beamed to Earth safely as microwaves, collected and converted to electricity for the Grid, each one equivalent in output to a large coal power station.\n\nThe Space Energy Initiative (SEI) will bring together government, research and industry in the energy and space sectors to develop and deliver a co-ordinated programme of technology development and demonstration.\n\nMeeting the timeline set out by the Government’s Net Zero pledge, and in partnership with other nations, the aim is to establish the first orbital demonstrator SBSP system by 2030, with the first of a kind operational system delivering power into the grid by 2040. The first generation of Solar Power Satellites would be in operation by the mid 2040s, replacing a substantial proportion of the UK’s legacy fossil fuel energy generation capacity."
