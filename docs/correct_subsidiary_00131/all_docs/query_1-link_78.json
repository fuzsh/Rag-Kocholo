        "text": "Global Knowledge Software, which develops self-service, web-based training automation software, is being bought by Oracle.\n\nGKS’s Personal Navigator is already resold as part of Oracle’s User Productivity Kit, currently at more than 2,000 Oracle customers. Ed Abbo, senior vice president of Oracle Application Development, says that GKS products, combined with Oracle Tutor (Oracle’s role-based process documentation and training software) and its iLearning and eLearning management software, will now cover everything from process documentation to interactive system training and embedded support. “Our customers are looking for a consistent, cost effective training solution,” says Abbo. “With this acquisition, customers will have access to a single technology for end-user training and process documentation that spans applications across their enterprise.” The transaction is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2008.\n\nComments"
