        "text": "Introduction\n\nFor nearly two centuries, a cornerstone of Anglo-American corpo­rate law has been the fiduciary duty of loyalty, the most demanding and litigated fiduciary obligation imposed on corporate managers. The duty—which regulates financial conflicts of interest and requires manag­ers to subordinate their own interests to the corporation’s—represents a key policy lever to address the most pernicious of intra-firm agency costs. Practitioners, academics, and jurists alike have charac­terized loyalty as the most important fiduciary obligation, and economists have credited it with facilitating efficient corporate stew­ardship and catalyzing investment and entrepreneurship. Indeed, a well-known literature in law and finance has documented the beneficial role that credible conflict-of-interest management plays in promoting com­pany value, vibrant capital markets, and firm longevity. The duty of loyalty is also notable because of its historically inveterate and unyielding nature: While much of corporate law consists of “default rules” that parties may freely alter, the duty of loyalty is widely perceived as “immutable”—immune to private efforts to dilute, tailor, or eliminate it.\n\nThat perception is no longer true. Beginning in 2000, Delaware dramatically departed from tradition, amending its statutes to enable corporations to waive a critical component of loyalty—the corporate oppor­tunities doctrine—which forbids corporate fiduciaries from appro­priating new business prospects for themselves without first offering them to the company. From that moment forward, Delaware corpo­rations and managers became free to contract out of a significant portion of the duty of loyalty. In the ensuing years, eight other states have followed Delaware’s lead, granting their own incorporated entities the statutory authority to execute corporate opportunity waivers (COWs). The Corporate Laws Committee of the American Bar Association (ABA) has also recently proposed amending the Model Business Corporation Act to permit advance waivers of corporate opportunities.\n\nThe reform movement sparked by Delaware represents a significant departure from long-settled understanding and common law tradition—a departure that concerns a basic tenet of company law. It is thus surprising that no significant study to date has empirically assessed firms’ responses to these reforms (save for anecdotal accounts suggesting that there has been little reaction ). This Article endeavors to fill this void, presenting what appears to be the first broad empirical assessment\n\nof how public companies have responded to the statutory reforms, and devel­­­­oping a broader conceptual and theoretical account to predict and explain that response.\n\nBased on an extensive data set of U.S. public companies’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we isolated over 10,000 unique disclosures that were plausible COWs. We then refined these data in two ways. First, we manually coded a large subset along a variety of dimensions pertaining to the existence, scope, reach, and location of a waiver. Second, we used our hand-coded sample to train a machine-learning algorithm, thereby extending our coding protocol to the entire population of candidate documents. In contrast to the conventional wisdom, we find that hundreds of public corporations in our sample—and well over one thousand in the population—have disclosed or executed waivers, with terms that apply broadly across both managerial ranks and cate­gorical domains. This Article thus establishes a central empirical fact that is an important baseline for further discussion: Public companies have an enormous appetite for tailoring the duty of loyalty when freed to do so.\n\nAlongside these empirical findings, this Article takes on several fundamental questions raised by widespread adoption of waivers of corporate opportunities: Why would a corporation ever choose to restrict the reach of the duty of loyalty? What form will the optimal allocation of corporate opportunities plausibly take in different companies? Under what conditions would such waivers be valuable to shareholders, even as such waivers constrain the fiduciary duties owed to share­holders? Delaware’s seventeen-year statutory experiment also provides a unique opportunity to revisit some foundational issues in corporate law with a fresh perspective. Indeed, there is a vigorous, decades-old debate that asks whether any of corporate law’s rules should be mandatory, or whether parties instead should be free to contract out of every gov­ernance requirement as they already can from most. Does enlarging the contracting space for fiduciary duties result in greater efficiencies, or does it instead result in unchecked opportunism? There is also a significant set of issues involving whether corporations actually make use of the freedom frequently given them by corporate law to replace default rules and whether, when they do so, it serves shareholders’ interests.\n\nThis Article argues that there are, in fact, several plausible economic rationales for a corporation to embrace a COW for the sake of share­holder value. Indeed, in the years leading up to Delaware’s initial reform, a growing chorus of critics argued that the exacting requirements of the duty of loyalty had begun to impede corporations’ ability to raise capital, build efficient investor bases, and secure optimal management arrange­ments. This claim was based in part on the recognition that many then-emerging sources of capital, such as private equity, venture capital, or spin-off transactions, may subject their financial sponsors to fiduciary duties in profound conflict with either their larger business plans or with fiduciary obligations they owe to other business entities. Absent the contractual ability to clarify ownership rights regarding new business opportunities, it is difficult to see how such capital structures could stably persist within the standard corporate arrangement.\n\nConsider, for example, one of the issuers in our database: Prosper Marketplace, Inc., the first and still one of the largest peer-to-peer lenders. The waiver that Prosper adopted in its charter covered any member of Prosper’s board who was not also an employee. The four outside directors in place at the time of the company’s public filing (and a majority of the board) worked for financial firms—three of them in venture capital—and at that point served as directors for at least fourteen other companies, including another online commercial market. As a risky entrepreneurial start-up, Prosper was an ideal candidate for the ven­ture capital financing model. Yet it is difficult to see how those outside directors could avoid intractable fiduciary conflicts without first securing waivers defining the boundaries of their loyalty obligations across differ­ent companies.\n\nThat said, simply because there are plausible conditions under which COWs could enhance shareholder welfare, it does not follow that the firms actually adopting waivers satisfy those conditions. Our empirical analysis provides insights into this question as well. We find that COW adopters are, on average, reasonably established firms with moderate-to-high asset values. They typically generate sizeable revenues, and they tend to deliver larger overall market returns to their capital investors by comparison to other public companies. Delaware corporations are overrepresented, as are firms in industries in which diversified, active investments across multiple portfolio companies are the norm (such as oil and gas). As a descriptive matter, then, it does not appear that companies that execute waivers are systematically the unscrupulous bottom feeders of the corporate ecosystem. To the con­trary, they appear—by and large—to be healthy, growing, and profitable business organizations.\n\nIn addition to these descriptive statistics, this Article further assesses whether the adoption of a waiver tends to add or dilute value on the margin by analyzing market reactions to issuers’ first public disclosure of a COW. Our event-study analysis reveals that market reactions appear to be favorable, resulting in an average positive abnormal stock return hovering around one percent in the days immediately surrounding the announcement date. While suggestive, the relationship is generally not statistically significant at conventional levels, underlining the need for additional future research. This positive reception is more pronounced for Delaware corporations and for those with asset values just below $1 billion. Market response does not seem sensitive, in contrast, to whether the waiver also covers officers or dominant shareholders, nor does it appear to vary depending on whether the COW was adopted in a pro­posed charter amendment, a board-promulgated resolution, or some­thing else. In addition, we demonstrate that firms incorporated in the nine states embracing Delaware-style reform have experienced positive abnormal stock-price returns on and around the date that such reforms became inevitable. All told, these findings suggest not only that public companies have embraced their newfound liberty to tailor the fiduciary duty of loyalty but also that they have done so in ways that shareholders welcome (or at least do not disfavor). Our findings are also pertinent to ongoing debates about shareholder activism, the appropriate role of “con­­stituency” directors, and whether the delineation of such roles should be subject to immutable rules or left up to the companies themselves.\n\nSeveral caveats warrant attention before proceeding. First, this Article’s study is limited to waiver disclosures contained in SEC filings. This data source imposes some unavoidable constraints. Most obviously, because privately held firms are far less likely to be SEC reporting entities, the ob­served disclosures skew towards publicly traded companies. In addition, the statutory provisions permitting COWs tend to grant wide latitude to companies about how and where they promulgate a waiver, and thus even for public companies, a waiver could be buried in any number of public filings. While it is important to remain mindful of these limitations, we note that a significant fraction of our data set does include private companies, including newly spun-off entities and private companies with public debt. Moreover, the protocol we designed for identifying candidate waivers casts a deliberately wide net, combing through the entire universe of SEC filings with search criteria designed deliberately to capture a large fraction of “false positive” candidates—a population we could later winnow using sampling, manual coding, and machine-learning techniques.\n\nSecond, in practice, the disclosure of a COW is frequently “bundled” with other disclosures (such as an announced spin-off, carve-out, signif­icant investment, or reorganization). It is no doubt possible—and perhaps likely—that the market’s reception of a COW is really an amal­gamated reaction to the totality of contemporaneous disclosures. Failing to account for such confounding variables, one might argue, can lead to spurious conclusions about the market response to waivers in particular. Although this is an important concern, the appropriate response is not clear. Proponents of Delaware’s reform maintained that an enforceable COW is a critical precondition for the very transactions that now typically accompany it. To the extent that this claim is valid, it would be inappropriate not to analyze the COW alongside the other bundled disclosures it facilitates. Nevertheless, as a robustness check, we also exploit the time-lagged implementation of COW reforms at the state level, which started with Delaware and spread to eight other states over time. We similarly find evidence of a positive market response to passage of a COW reform among issuers incorporated inside the reforming jurisdiction.\n\nThird, it is important to acknowledge that even if COWs help augment shareholder welfare, it need not follow that other corporate constituencies benefit as well (if at all). In particular, a recent literature in antitrust economics has begun systematically to document the rise of “horizontal” ownership structures in which a common investor holds appreciable equity across several ostensibly competing firms (often with board representation). Such practices raise legitimate concerns that the common shareholder will help orchestrate anticompetitive coordination by the firms against their customers, employees, or trading partners. The ready availability of a COW may further exacerbate this problem, by permitting the common shareholder to choreograph collusion behind the scenes, with little fear of litigation risk from minority shareholders. Such concerns seem entirely plausible in our data: About one quarter of the waivers in the event-study sample (and about half in the full sample ) extend protection to certain of the issuer’s shareholders.\n\nFinally, most statutes enabling companies to execute COWs (including Delaware’s) also subject that decision to a “back door” duty of loyalty analysis. For example, if an interested director, officer, or dominant shareholder were to use her domination of the board to force through a self-serving COW, then courts could invalidate the prom­ulgation of the waiver itself as self-dealing. The issuers embracing waivers within our data set have done so against the backdrop of this liability exposure—one animated, ironically enough, by a lingering vestige of immutability within the duty of loyalty. Thus, one must be careful before using this study to draw inferences about the broader merits of default versus mandatory rules.\n\nThe remainder of the Article proceeds as follows. Part I revisits the broad contours of fiduciary duties, providing a brief overview of the duty of loyalty and the corporate opportunities doctrine. It also traces the evolution of COWs, from prereform waiver efforts, to their skeptical reception by Delaware’s courts, to the enactment of the Delaware reforms and related statutes, and finally to subsequent litigation address­ing waivers. Part II lays out a conceptual framework and model of efficient contracting over corporate opportunities in order to capture the contexts in which a COW would be value enhancing and the form it would plausibly take. Part III describes the empirical methodology behind our data set, offering a series of descriptive statistics about both the structure of COWs and the types of companies embracing them. Part III also reports on a series of event studies documenting positive market reactions to companies’ first disclosure of a COW. Part IV discusses the broader legal and policy implications of this analysis.\n\nI. Revisiting the Duty of Loyalty\n\nTo provide legal background to the theoretical and empirical enterprise that follows, this Part gives an overview of the duty of loyalty and corporate opportunities doctrine (COD). Section I.A explores the broad doctrinal contours, while section I.B turns to the process by which Delaware and other states implemented statutory reforms empowering corporations to execute COWs.\n\nA. Fiduciary Law and the Corporate Opportunities Doctrine\n\n1. Fiduciary Duties and the Duty of Loyalty. — Corporate fiduciaries—the officers who manage a company’s daily operations, the directors who wield ultimate decisionmaking authority, and the dominant shareholders who possess swing voting power—exercise control over a vast amount of social resources on behalf of corporations’ ultimate owners, their shareholders. Among the law’s principal tools for ensuring that corporate fiduciaries serve the interests of all of a corporation’s owners faithfully and competently are the fiduciary duties of loyalty and care.\n\nThe duty of care mandates that corporate fiduciaries exercise in­formed business judgment in their stewardship of the company, imposing liability if a fiduciary acts (or fails to act) without first being adequately informed. While this duty could conceivably reach almost any major decision by corporate decisionmakers, a wide variety of judicial and private limitations cabin its scope. Alongside the famous defendant-friendly “business judgment rule,” corporations are permitted to insure their directors and officers against breaches of the duty of care and to indemnify their directors for expenses incurred in connection with defending against allegations of breaches. Lastly, Delaware and the vast majority of other states allow parties to contract around the duty of care in various respects. For instance, since the 1980s, almost all states have permitted a corporation to adopt a charter provision limiting or eliminat­ing the personal liability of corporate directors for breaching the duty of care. Public companies regularly execute such exoneration provisions.\n\nThe duty of loyalty prohibits fiduciaries from benefiting improperly from financial conflicts of interest. In stark contrast to the duty of care, loyalty has traditionally been immutable. The Delaware statute that enables corporate charters to limit or eliminate directors’ monetary liability for breaches of fiduciary duty, for example, expressly excludes the duty of loyalty from its reach. Moreover, unlike with the duty of care, the deferential business judgment rule is also inapplicable to alleged breaches of loyalty. Loyalty’s traditionally mandatory character is part of why commentators have widely held the duty to be “the most important duty which arises within the context of fiduciary relation­ships” as well as the subject of most fiduciary litigation.\n\nThe duty of loyalty requires fiduciaries to “exercise their authority in a good-faith attempt to advance corporate purposes.” While there is an affirmative dimension to this duty, its normal role is to bar self-interested action by officers or directors, which involves a conflict of interest with the corporation itself. Perhaps the most colorful summary of the duty of loyalty is still the seminal opinion of Meinhard v. Salmon—a widely adopted and cited case involving a contested business opportunity of an unincorporated partnership. Defendant Walter Salmon and plaintiff Morton Meinhard entered a joint venture to lease and improve a Manhattan hotel, which ultimately proved quite successful. As a result of the venture, Salmon (the active manager) came to owe fiduciary duties to Meinhard (a largely silent partner). Near the end of the lease, the hotel’s new owner offered Salmon a successor lease to manage and improve a vastly larger set of related properties. After the new lease had been signed, Meinhard, who was previously uninformed about the lease offer, discovered it and demanded a pro-rata share. A referee found that Meinhard was owed such an interest in the expanded venture in a fraction roughly proportionate to his interest in the first one.\n\nIn a majority opinion authored by Chief Judge Benjamin Cardozo, the high court of New York affirmed. The opinion was quickly recog­nized as one for the ages. Judge Cardozo famously declared that fiduciary ties demand a duty of “finest” and “undivided” loyalty, far “stricter than the morals of the market place,” concluding instead that “[n]ot honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior.” By adopting “[u]ncompromising rigidity” in their approach to the duty of loyalty, the court articulated an aspiration that fiduciaries’ conduct would be “kept at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd.” The broad language of Meinhard and similar cases becomes concrete in the various forms of managerial conduct regulated by the duty of loyalty, including transactions between a corporation and its directors, self-dealing, control transactions, and executive compensation. That said, this Article’s focus will be trained on—as was Chief Judge Cardozo’s—the allocation of new business opportunities between the firm and the fiduciary.\n\nThe Corporate Opportunities Doctrine. — The COD is a key component of the duty of loyalty. The basic idea of the COD is that corporate fiduciaries may not appropriate for themselves a new business opportunity that belongs to the corporation, unless they first present it to the corporation and receive authorization to pursue it personally. As a result of the considerable amount of litigation arising from the COD and its complexity, it has over time developed its own labyrinth of rules, subcategories, standards, and tests.\n\nThe Delaware cases of Guth v. Loft and Broz v. Cellular Information Systems, Inc. provide defining benchmarks for the modern COD (both inside and outside Delaware). The doctrine states that an officer or director of a corporation usurps a business opportunity if:\n\n(1) the corporation is financially able to [undertake] the oppor­tunity; (2) the opportunity is within the corporation’s line of business; (3) the corporation has an interest or expectancy in the opportunity; and (4) by [pursuing] the opportunity [per­son­ally], the corporate fiduciary will thereby be placed in a position inimicable [sic] to his duties to the corporation.\n\nCourts engage in a fact-intensive inquiry to determine whether a given fiduciary’s pursuit of a business opportunity was impermissible under this multifactor test.\n\nA simpler way to think of the doctrine, however, is as a sequential inquiry. The first major question is whether a given business prospect constitutes a bona fide “corporate opportunity,” thereby posing a genuine conflict of interest. A number of fairly involved tests are employed by courts in determining whether a given business prospect is a corporate opportunity. If the prospect is not a corporate opportunity, then a fiduciary does no wrong by simply pursuing it herself without informing the corporation. If the prospect is a corporate opportunity, though, then the appropriate course of action is to offer it to the corporation. If the corporation properly rejects that opportunity—paradigmatically, by a majority vote of disinterested directors—then the fiduciary again does no harm by pursuing it, while if the corporation does not reject it, the fiduciary is barred from pursuit of the prospect.\n\nThere are also several affirmative defenses that materially shape the contours of the COD. Thus, some courts have found fiduciaries not to have usurped corporate opportunities because they encountered the opportunity in their personal capacity; because the corporation impliedly rejected the opportunity; and most importantly, because the corporation was not able to pursue a given business pros­pect, perhaps because the corporation’s financial condition precluded it from doing so. If even this stylized description of the COD sounds involved, that is largely a reflection of the doctrine itself. The law’s attempt to regulate fiduciaries’ independent pursuit of business opportu­nities has produced a doctrine of startling complexity and unpredictability.\n\nNot only is the COD a heavily litigated and murky subspecies of the duty of loyalty, but the form of misconduct it targets—the usurpation of business opportunities—is also one of the most pernicious types of agency costs. When the issue is one of who “owns” rights to a business opportunity, then the interests of a corporation and its agent are not merely misaligned; they may be completely at odds with each other. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that the COD addresses not only behavior that can reduce the value of a firm but also behavior in which a fiduciary may usurp from its principal a new venture whose value significantly exceeds that of the corporation—as Meinhard v. Salmon illustrates. In Meinhard, the initial lease had been for $55,000, while the new one was for $350,000 to $475,000; the initial building improvements had been for $200,000, but were now to cost $3,000,000.\n\nB. Evolution of the COW: A Brief History of Endeavors to Contract Out of the Corporate Opportunities Doctrine\n\nAs noted in the previous section, the COD has always permitted boards of directors to “reject” a corporate opportunity ex post—after it has emerged and has been properly presented to the company by a fiduciary interested in pursuing it personally. Just as with other forms of independent board dispensation, however, this authorization power historically did not apply to the prospective (or ex ante) waiver as to opportunities or projects that had yet to arise. In fact, the notion that parties might contract around (or out of) the duty of loyalty in advance was traditionally considered anathema to foundational commitments of corporate law, of which the duty of loyalty is one of few mandatory components. For the most part, that is still how much of fiduciary law operates (at least in Delaware corporations). But the late-twentieth century bore witness to several early attempts to chisel the edges of the status quo, at least insofar as it pertained to COWs. The judicial response to those early attempts, in turn, arguably catalyzed the subsequent statutory innovations.\n\n1. Primordial COWs. — Prior to the amendment of Delaware’s Code in 2000, no specific statutory authority empowered companies explicitly to contract out of the COD in advance. A company motivated to do so in a legally legitimate fashion had few, if any, options, save a “nuclear” one: A corporation could theoretically—in many states—attempt to cabin the breadth of the doctrine by narrowing the purpose articulated in its charter to specified lines of business, effectively using that scope limitation to cabin the reach of all corporate activity, including the COD. Such measures, however, invite a host of other ultra vires challenges to corporate decisionmaking —obstacles that have caused limited-purpose provisions to be disfavored and exceedingly rare in modern times. Indeed, conventional corporate charter wisdom has long advocated extremely broad purpose provisions, authorizing the corporation to engage in “any lawful act or activity” for which corpora­tions may be organized under the applicable corporate statute.\n\nA more tailored form of carve out, on the other hand, had speculative legal validity: Prior to 2000, Delaware statutes did not explicitly permit (or even appear to contemplate) contracting out of the COD. On the other hand, neither did Delaware law unambiguously prohibit the practice. Towards the end of the twentieth century, several corporations began to experiment with such provisions—experiments that inevitably attracted legal challenges. Perhaps the best-known example was the 1989 Delaware Chancery Court decision in Siegman v. Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. Siegman was a putative class action challenging a proposed combination between Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. (“Tri-Star”), Coca-Cola, and Time. Under the terms of the contemplated transaction, Tri-Star acquired the entertainment assets of Coca-Cola, and Coca-Cola received a large number of shares of newly issued Tri-Star common stock.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged the validity of several proposed amend­ments to Tri-Star’s certificate of incorporation (executed as part of the combination). One such amendment purported to eliminate liability for Tri-Star’s directors for breach of the duty of loyalty under specified circumstances involving the appropriation of corporate opportunities. Another amendment provided that neither Coca-Cola nor Time, as signi­ficant block stockholders of Tri-Star, would be liable for any breach of fiduciary duty stemming from having pursued a corporate opportunity belonging to Tri-Star. The business combination was approved by both Tri-Star and Coca-Cola, and the proposed amendments were subse­quently adopted by shareholders.\n\nThe gravamen of the complaint centered on the director provision, asserting that the COW purported to eliminate or limit liability in a way that was simply impermissible under Delaware law. Specifically, plaintiffs argued that section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) did not permit elimination or restriction of directors’ liability for breach of the duty of loyalty. The statute provides express limitations on exoneration provisions and excludes any waiver “[f]or any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders.” Effectively, the plaintiffs asserted that the COW amendment purported to do exactly this: reduce the directors’ liability exposure for a particular type of duty of loyalty breach (an appropriation of corporate oppor­tunities), a move that the plaintiffs argued transgressed the immu­table boundaries of section 102(b)(7). The defendants countered that the provi­sion was valid and enforceable under Delaware law, and they moved to dismiss.\n\nThen-Vice Chancellor Jacobs sided with the plaintiffs, noting that the appropriate judicial standard for a motion to dismiss in this context “requires that the motion must be denied if under any plausible construction or operation,” the COW “arguably would contravene” Delaware law. Employing this analytical approach, Vice Chancellor Jacobs determined that at least one plausible set of facts would—under the articulated terms of the charter provision—eliminate or limit the liability of Tri-Star directors for breach of their fiduciary duty of loyalty. Indeed, Vice Chancellor Jacobs envisioned a very general scenario as violating section 102(b)(7): A director appropriates for herself or her other employer a business opportunity that rightly belongs to Tri-Star but had not been offered to that director in her capacity as a Tri-Star director or in writing. Finding such a result to be impermissible under the limits established by section 102(b)(7), Vice Chancellor Jacobs denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss.\n\n2. Legalizing COWs in the Delaware General Corporation Law. — Siegman substantially put to rest the question of how and when corporate opportunities were waivable. Under any fair reading of the opinion, the duty of loyalty was simply not contractible, be it through a corporate governance provision, a board resolution, or through a contractual term. In the ensuing decade, the Siegman opinion stayed in full force and was rarely discussed by subsequent judicial opinions (inside or outside Delaware).\n\nBy the end of the twentieth century, however, market dynamics began biting at the jurisprudential heels of the Siegman approach. The dot-com era of the 1990s ushered in a wave of novel market-mediated corporate structures, including spin-offs, partial IPOs, venture capital, private equity, and equity carve-outs. Many of these innovations resulted in extended families of corporate affiliates with partially overlapping ownership, partially overlapping board membership, and partially overlapping lines of business. Such structures, in turn, placed considerable stress on the canonical “undivided-loyalty” model of corporate opportunities. Any time a fiduciary’s duties extended to multiple affiliated entities (as was increasingly frequent), she faced an unwinnable Kobayashi-Maru scenario of carving up what was judicially indivisible: her loyalty. Consider, for example, the conundrum of allocating corporate opportunities between a parent and its partially owned subsidiary, both operating in a similar industry and sharing common board members and officers. How might those overlapping fiduciaries (or for that matter, the parent, as the dominant shareholder of the subsidiary) comply with their simultaneous duties of “undivided loyalty” between the two firms? How should they go about allocating corporate opportunities?\n\nThese questions are profound and probably unanswerable. Scholars have long recognized that the undivided-loyalty model is simply not well adapted for fiduciaries shared by two companies. In fact, the canonical approach may be the least attractive from the parties’ perspectives, since a time-honored prescription for conduct of “dual agents” under fiduciary law is to disclose the corporate opportunity to both interested corpo­rations, effectively encouraging the two to compete with one another for the new business prospect. While such competition is no doubt attractive to counterparties in the business opportunity (offering signif­icant transactional surplus), it seems an unlikely governance feature for augmenting the combined welfare of the fiduciary and the two bene­ficiaries of her duties.\n\nNevertheless, by the turn of the century, the corporate structures described above had become increasingly common. Two high-stakes cases during that era—Thorpe v. CERBCO, Inc. and In re Digex, Inc. —help underscore the resulting challenges. Both cases focused centrally on corporate opportunities claims made by shareholders of a controlled subsidiary, asserting that the parent had usurped a corporate opportunity related to an acquisition of the subsidiary. In both cases, the plaintiffs alleged that the controller had commandeered takeover negotiations with a third-party buyer, redirecting the buyer’s interest towards the parent and away from the subsidiary, thereby fleecing the subsidiary’s minority shareholders of their impending control premium. In both cases, the corporate opportunities claims either narrowly lost or were substantially narrowed, under the theory that the prospective acquisition deal was not a corporate opportunity since the parent possessed the power (and the right) to use its voting shares to veto any proposed transaction at the subsidiary level. Nevertheless, both opinions recog­nized the generic and intractable challenges posed by corporate opportunities claims in cases involving ownership–board–industry overlap. The cases served up a sobering reminder of the uncom­fortable indeterminacy of corporate opportunity claims when firms have overlapping dominant ownership or boards. They also made apparent that there might be some value in allowing parties to prearrange how they would divide property rights over corporate opportunities. Thus was the stage set for a legal-reform push at the dawn of the twenty-first century.\n\nThe wait was not long. In the summer of 2000, the Delaware Assembly amended the state’s statutes to add subsection (17) to section 122 of the DGCL, explicitly permitting COWs. The codified location is a curious one. Section 122 is a general and longstanding provision whose purpose is to articulate a variety of powers possessed by Delaware corporations. Many of these powers are fundamental (such as the right to hold property, the right to enter contracts, and the right to sue and be sued). The new subsection (17), however, was different and somewhat sui generis, constituting the sole provision in the section that concerns fiduciary duties. The subsec­tion provides that a Delaware corporation has the power to:\n\n(17) Renounce, in its certificate of incorporation or by action of its board of directors, any interest or expectancy of the corpo­ration in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities or specified classes or cate­gories of business opportunities that are presented to the corporation or one or more of its officers, directors or stockholders.\n\nThe legislative synopsis accompanying the amendment further states:\n\nThe subsection is intended to eliminate uncertainty regarding the power of a corporation to renounce corporate oppor­tunities in advance raised in Siegman v. Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. It permits the corporation to determine in advance whether a specified business opportunity or class or category of business opportunities is a corporate opportunity of the corporation rather than to address such opportunities as they arise. The subsection does not change the level of judicial scrutiny that will apply to the renunciation of an interest or expectancy of the corporation in a business opportunity, which will be determined based on the common law of fiduciary duty, including the duty of loyalty.\n\nSeveral aspects of the amendment and its synopsis warrant elaboration. First, and most obviously, the synopsis makes clear that the amendment was meant to repudiate the then-decade-old Siegman approach. Indeed, the amendment specifically permits enforceable COWs under Delaware law, a position that—both before and after Siegman—most had con­sidered untenable.\n\nSecond, the new section explicitly applies symmetrically to all corporate fiduciaries, including officers, directors, and dominant or controlling shareholders. By contrast, the statutory provision permitting duty of care waivers is far narrower, applying only to monetary damages claims against corporate directors; it does not extend to either injunc­tive relief of any kind or claims for monetary damages lodged against offi­cers or dominant shareholders. This asymmetry has been consis­tently recog­nized by the Delaware courts (even if periodically scorned by commentators).\n\nThird, consider the level of specificity required for a corporate opportunities waiver to be effective under the statute. On its face, the amendment requires a COW to be worded with some particularity, identifying “specified business opportunities or specified classes or categories of business opportunities” that would be subject to waiver. This construction appears in tension with an expansive, “blanket” waiver, in which a corporation, say, disclaims all corporate opportunities, or even a broad waiver purporting to disclaim all opportunities except a specified set of carved out exceptions. In contractual parlance, the wording of the section appears, at least facially, to suggest a type of sticky default rule that does not invite corporations to invert or “flip” the default, either in toto or in substantial part.\n\nFourth, consider the means and location for executing an effective COW. The text of the section permits a waiver to be included in a corporation’s charter, but it also allows a waiver to simply be adopted by action of the board of directors. Bearing in mind that a charter amendment cannot generally be promulgated exclusively by action of the board once stock is sold, the portion that authorizes an action of the board opens up tremendous latitude, permitting COWs to be couched in a contract approved by the board, a board-promulgated bylaw (if the board has such power under the charter), a board resolution, or any other declarative action promulgated by the board. The fact that a COW may be executed outside the charter context is notable, since the other principal means by which corporations may waive fiduciary duties (the duty of care) specifically requires a charter provision. Indeed, it was the prohibition of waiving the duty of loyalty under section 102(b)(7) that formed the basis of the Siegman opinion in the first place. Section 122(17) is thus in some conspicuous ways broader than conventional waivers of the duty of care.\n\nFinally, while section 122(17) grants increased latitude for enforcing valid COWs, the legislative synopsis notes that the initial adoption of a COW is subject to traditional fiduciary principles—just as the renunciation of an opportunity when it arises. Thus, should a financially conflicted board decide to adopt a COW without first seeking to cleanse the deci­sion through conventional means (such as a vote of disinterested direc­tors or shareholders), then the very act of executing the COW could be challenged under Delaware’s stringent entire fairness standard (and pos­sibly invalidated).\n\n3. Subsequent Delaware Litigation. — The footprint of Delaware’s statutory reform in case law and commentary has been surprisingly faint. In the decade and a half since section 122(17) was promulgated, the statute appears to have been invoked in only a single Delaware case and in only a few secondary sources.\n\nThe 2009 Delaware Chancery Court opinion in Wayne County Employees’ Retirement System v. Corti appears to be the only Delaware opinion to date to engage the statutory framework for COWs explicitly (although cursorily). Like Siegman, Corti was a purported shareholder class action challenging a business combination involving a waiver of corporate opportunities. The combination called for Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi) to transfer its subsidiary, Vivendi Games, Inc., to Activision, Inc. in return for newly issued shares of Activision and a post-closing tender offer by Vivendi for up to half of Activision’s remaining shares. Together, Vivendi’s acquisition of shares through the business combi­nation and back-end tender would result in Vivendi acquiring a majority of Activision voting stock, which it then renamed Activision Blizzard. The charter of the surviving corporation (Activision Blizzard) included a broadly-worded COW.\n\nPlaintiff—a shareholder of the target Activision—alleged, inter alia, that the COW was invalid under Delaware law because it contravened section 122(17)’s limitations through its sweeping language. The provision, plaintiff contended, failed to specify explicitly which corporate opportunities (or classes or categories thereof) the corpora­tion was renouncing as the statutory text arguably requires. Rather, the provision utilized the opposite, holus-bolus grammatical construction, categorically sweeping away all liability exposure with the exception of opportunities that were expressly offered to Activision fiduciaries in their capacity as such. In short, plaintiff averred, the Activision Blizzard waiver fell outside the bounds authorized by section 122(17).\n\nChancellor Chandler remained uncowed, denying plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction of the contemplated transaction and hold­ing that “[t]he mere existence of [the broadly worded COW] does not threaten plaintiff with harm that justifies expending judicial resources to render a declaratory judgment on the issue of whether the corporate opportunities allegedly renounced by [the COW] are sufficiently ‘specified.’” Any plausible harm to plaintiff due to the wording of the waiver, Chancellor Chandler concluded, “is too remote and speculative to justify rendering a declaratory judgment, and plaintiff is not entitled to a declaratory judgment merely because it is able to conjure up hypothetical situations in which the challenged provisions may be applied contrary to Delaware law.” Ultimately, Chancellor Chandler took no position on the question of whether such hypothetical situations might actually arise down the road, in which case the Activision-Blizzard COW might be invalidated under the statute. But any such claim would have to wait for an actual disputed business opportunity.\n\nIt is unclear how the court might have wrestled with the Corti COW had the case presented an actual contested business opportunity. While the text of section 122(17) could arguably favor plaintiff’s preferred narrow construction, the legislative synopsis suggests that plaintiff’s posi­tion faces an uphill battle. The synopsis offers several characteriza­tions of how corporations’ power to renounce business opportunities in advance might be used:\n\n[C]ategories of business opportunities may be specified by any manner of defining or delineating business opportunities or the corporation’s or any other party’s entitlement thereto or interest therein, including, without limitation, by line or type of business, identity of the originator of the business opportunity, identity of the party or parties to or having an interest in the business opportunity, identity of the recipient of the business opportunity, periods of time or geographical location.\n\nAfter Corti, there appear to be no other opinions endeavoring to interpret section 122(17). Although parties in a few post-Corti cases have advanced theories touching on the applicability or scope of a purported waiver, none of these opinions has discussed the section explicitly, and each court either struck down the waiver argument on other grounds or avoided it so as to shed little additional light on how courts will likely apply section 122(17) in future Delaware cases.\n\nThe paucity of published jurisprudence around COWs does not imply, however, that all important legal questions pertaining to waivers have been answered—far from it. One particularly intriguing question pertains to the so-called “duty of good faith,” which entered the scene years after section 122(17)’s promulgation. By all accounts, good faith is thought to be immutable and a subspecies of the duty of loyalty (rather than a freestanding fiduciary obligation). Moreover, under Delaware jurisprudence, the good faith duty proscribes conduct that harms the corporation and is motivated by a fiduciary’s “subjective bad faith.” It seems entirely possible to characterize corporate opportunity diversion as embodying precisely this type of deliberate bad faith, in which the corporation is “harmed” when the fiduciary willfully deprives it of a lucrative business opportunity. How might such an allegation proceed if the corporation had also executed a COW that covered the fiduciary? On the one hand, the waiver’s power derives directly from the statute; but on the other, the statute never specifically carves out good faith claims. While one could clearly make sound arguments in either direction, a definitive answer must await clarification by the Delaware courts—or legislature—as to whether section 122(17) also unwittingly contractualized part of the duty of good faith.\n\nNon-Delaware COWs. — Delaware was the clear pioneer in authorizing COWs through statute. However, not long after the Delaware reforms took root, other states began to follow suit. Table 1 offers an overview of the states that have followed Delaware to date in amending their statutory frameworks explicitly to allow COWs. Note from the Table that the other states promulgating waiver statutes represent more of a trickle than they do a flood. Promulgating states moved in relatively evenly spaced intervals, with no two states adopting waiver statutes in the same calendar year. It is also worth noting that outside of Delaware, only a few adopting states (Maryland and Nevada) are considered “bellwether” states for incorporation. Notably absent from the list are New York and California—two of the largest jurisdictional homes to incorporated entities outside Delaware.\n\nTable 1: Statutory Authority for Corporate Opportunity Waivers by State\n\nThe structures of the follow-on statutes are similar—but not always identical—to Delaware’s. Oklahoma, Kansas, New Jersey, and Maryland each have provisions that closely track section 122(17) in all respects. However, there are also variations providing more or less latitude. For exam­ple, Maryland and Washington omit the express modifier “speci­fied” in describing the scope of waivable classes or categories of business opportunities. In addition, Missouri and Washington extend the scope of permissible waivers to cover others beyond officers, directors, and dominant shareholders. In Missouri, in fact, a COW may also cover any agent or employee, and Washington allows COWs to cover “any other person” beyond the usual suspects. At the same time, Washington’s statute is also more restrictive in at least two ways. First, the waiver must be part of a charter provision and cannot be adopted by action of the board. Second, insofar as a COW reaches officers and dominant shareholders, the statute requires specific board approval (effectively a “reaffirmation”) of the waiver when a business opportunity arises that the officer or dominant shareholder wishes to pursue.\n\nGiven the paucity of developed case law even in Delaware, the leadership position that Delaware generally has in establishing precedents, and the fact that the other promulgating states moved later to introduce their amendments, it would be reasonable to expect the case law to be even less developed outside Delaware. Our investigation reaffirms this conjecture: Beyond Corti, we were unable to find any reported cases interpreting the statutory provisions described in Table 1.\n\nThe lack of attention COWs have received in judicial opinions and commentary might lead one to believe that the authorizing statutes have simply not created much interest among eligible firms and that corpo­rations have by and large declined the invitation to waive or truncate the application of the COD as to their fiduciaries. As Part III will show, however, this is hardly the case. In fact, corporations have demonstrated an enormous appetite for contracting out of the COD. Before Part III explores these findings, Part II lays down an analytical framework to explain why this appetite may exist.\n\nII. Theory: Efficient Contracting over Corporate Opportunities\n\nThe acknowledged unpredictability of the corporate opportunities doc­trine has long generated interest among commentators in developing a coherent account of the doctrine that could serve as a normative lodestar for courts. Among these accounts are contractarian approaches that seek to fashion a COD based on precepts of efficient contract design between a corporation and its fiduciaries—that is, how would they plausibly bargain over their prospective rights to corporate opportunities ex ante, given their capital constraints, information constraints, and relative bargaining power? While not unique among conceptual approaches, the contractarian account can be of considerable value to efficiency-minded courts attempting to adjudicate the thorny equities around disputed claims of ownership of new business prospects.\n\nA significant limitation of the contractarian project as applied to the COD, however, was that the law traditionally prohibited parties from using contracts to alter the relevant fiduciary obligations. Thus, if the contractarian account was to have any sway, it would be through the immutable precepts of the doctrine as announced and understood by courts. Since Delaware’s 2000 reforms, of course, jurisdictions have begun to permit parties to contractualize corporate opportunities. With this change, contractarianism acquired far greater significance, both as a normative guidepost for doctrine and as a vehicle for predicting—as a positive matter—the incidence of COWs as well as their qualitative characteristics. Section II.A briefly outlines a contractarian account, adopting and extending a theoretical framework originally developed in prior work. Section II.B suggests why it may frequently be efficient for corporations to allocate corporate opportunities ex ante, rather than merely at the time of board presentation—ex post—which historically was the sole tool available.\n\nBefore proceeding, however, it is worth reiterating a lawyerly disclaimer from the introduction: Conceptual arguments for how COWs could be efficient should not be understood to evince a conviction that they are efficient. That conclusion simply does not follow. Indeed, the agency cost paradigm remains a powerful frame for corporate law, and it is entirely possible that the main reason for the adoption of COWs is managerial opportunism. Indeed, some empirical work on LLCs suggests that entities that contract around fiduciary defaults often do so at their own peril and with wealth-destructive consequences. Instead, this Part’s aim is far more modest: It aspires to show that there exist plausible cases in which waivers can augment shareholder value. Ultimately, the normative desirability of COWs cannot be settled on theoretical grounds and requires empirical investigation (to which Part III turns).\n\nA. Framework\n\nTo begin, assume a simple framework involving only two parties: (1) a single principal (P, or the “firm”) and (2) a single agent (A), who ostensibly works on P’s behalf. In the corporate opportunities context, P will generally refer to the focal corporate entity, while A might represent an officer, director, or dominant shareholder of P. One of A’s key economic functions (and a source of value creation) comes from evaluating new business “projects” that are presented to the firm and taking on those projects that are sufficiently well suited to the firm’s capabilities (generating a net profit in the process).\n\nAssume (for simplicity) that each new project yields revenues of $100 (in expectation). Different projects, however, require different mixes of skills and specialties. Accordingly, the net revenues that P can capture from each project vary heterogeneously across projects. Some projects, for example, may be directly in the firm’s “sweet spot” and maximally profitable, while others are so far afield from the firm’s area of specialty that they are wholly unprofitable. We use the Greek letter theta (q) to represent the specific “type” of skill or specialty requirements entailed in a project presented to the firm. To fix ideas, suppose (arbitrarily) that the value of q describes the percentage composition of verbal (relative to technical) skills that the project requires. When q = 0%, the project is entirely technical in nature, while when q = 100%, it is entirely verbal. Projects with intermediate values of q entail a proportional mixture of technical and verbal requirements. Suppose that moreover ex ante, the next project’s requirements are probabilistically distributed evenly (or “uniformly”) between 0% and 100%.\n\nProject heterogeneity is crucial to how corporate opportunities should be allocated, because the project’s net profitability turns on how closely aligned it is with P’s (or A’s) skill sets. Suppose (for concrete­ness) that P specializes in completing projects that are 50% verbal in nature (i.e., projects of type q = 50%) and can complete those projects at a relatively low cost, assumed (arbitrarily) to be $20, for expected net revenues of $80. Should the offered project differ from P’s area of expertise, P could still conceivably accept it, but only by bearing an adaptation cost away from its sweet spot to do so. Namely, it costs P an additional $4 for each percentage increment it moves away from its specialty. For instance, to take on a project with a 40% concentration of verbal tasks (q = 40%), P would need to bear a cost of $60 (i.e., $20 in fixed costs plus an additional $40 representing the cost of moving 10 percentage points from its specialty at $4 per point). In mathematical terms, P’s cost of taking on a given type of project can be summarized by the cost function CP(q) = 20 + 4 · |q − 50|. Figure 1 contains a diagram representing the firm’s cost and profit structure given these parameters. This cost structure (pictured in green) is intended to capture the intuition behind a firm’s “line of business”: P operates most profitably when the project coincides with its sweet spot of expertise (i.e., where q = 50%), but P can adapt its production techniques to take on projects that are further afield. This adaptation, however, comes at a cost, and this cost increases with the “distance” between the firm’s specialty and the requirements of the project. Given the numerical figures posited above, the firm would never take on any negative-value project where q < 30% or q > 70%. In an economic sense, then, the firm’s effective “line of business” is that set of projects the firm would have an economic incentive to pursue. In Figure 1, this would correspond to any project whose requirements fell on the region defined by 30% ≤ q ≤ 70% (a region shaded in green).\n\nFigure 1: Representation of Principal’s Cost Structure and Line of Business\n\nFor present purposes, A’s key role at the firm is to attract and receive information about new potential business projects that arrive and that may be of interest to the firm. If merely identifying new prospects was all A could do, then there would be no need for the corporate opportunities doctrine. The problem—in both real life and our model—is that A’s ability to spot and attract new business prospects will often coincide with a private ability to take on projects herself, outside of the productive infrastructure of P. Such a capacity for A is easy to imagine, such as when A is a controlling corporate shareholder of P or the principal of a financial firm that also invests in competitors.\n\nThus, A may have her own interest in pursuing the project on the outside (either individually or through a firm in which she has an interest). In particular, suppose A faces a fixed cost of x to take on any new project (a cost figure that need not correspond with P’s fixed cost of $20). Suppose further that A’s sweet spot within her area of specialty is denoted by z (which also need not correspond to the firm’s sweet spot of 50%). Finally, suppose that A’s marginal cost of adaptation is b dollars for each percentage point difference between the project and A’s own specialty (where the value of b similarly need not correspond to the firm’s marginal cost of adaptation of $4 per percentage point). All told, then, A’s cost of taking on a project of type q can be summarized by the cost function CA(q) = x + b · |q − z|.\n\nStandard economic intuition suggests that, so long as the charac­teristics of the offered project (reflected in q) are observable by both sides or readily verifiable by a third-party adjudicator, then an optimal contract should allocate control over the project to the lowest cost producer as between P and A. Indeed, this division uniquely maximizes the total joint surplus that is available to the principal and agent collectively. Under such a division of authority, the parties can use an assortment of side payments (such as wages, licensing fees, or transfer pricing) to divide the contingent revenues from the undertaken project in any fashion they wish.\n\nMoreover, and central to present purposes, it is possible to use a COW—if properly crafted—to achieve the optimal allocation of authority over prospective projects. Within this Article’s framework, the particular form of the optimal COW depends on the relative configurations of P’s and A’s adaptation costs. Figure 2 illustrates four archetypal confi­gurations, each of which gives rise to a different type of optimal waiver; the scope of the optimal COW is illustrated with the green bands overlaying P’s line of business (also in green). Each configuration assumes P has the same specialization and adaptation costs as stated above, while A’s cost structure varies (with each configuration containing different values of x, z, and b). Figure 2a assumes that A’s specialty is at x = 40%, that she faces a fixed cost of z = $80 to take on the project, and that her marginal cost of adaption is the same as P’s, at b = $4. Because of A’s high fixed costs, in this configuration it turns out that there is no project that A would ever be more efficient at taking on than P, and thus it would never be optimal for P to waive any opportunities falling within its line of business. Figure 2b maintains A’s specialty at x = 40% but assumes a far lower fixed cost (of z = $20) and a higher marginal cost of adaptation (of $15 per 1% adaptation). Here, the optimal COW will tend to permit A to appropriate a specific class of projects clustered near her specialty, but it will reserve for P rights as to all other projects. Such a provision would waive “only as to” a specified class or margin of projects closely matching A’s sweet spot. Figure 2c continues to maintain A’s specialty at x = 40% but assumes a fixed cost of $70 and a marginal adaptation cost of $0.60. For this configuration, A’s fixed cost is sufficiently high that P remains the most efficient producer only near its own sweet spot; however, A’s low adaptation cost gives A a comparative advantage for projects that are near the periphery of P’s line of business. This configuration would be consistent with a waiving “all but” a specified margin of projects near P’s specialty. Finally, Figure 2d assumes an agent specialty very close to P’s (of x = 48%), a lower fixed cost (of z = $10), and the same marginal adaptation cost. For this configuration, A is always the lowest cost producer, and an optimal COW would effectively give her free rein to pursue any and all projects.\n\nFigure 2: Optimal COWs (Green Bands) for Various Principal–Agent Cost Configurations\n\nFigure 2a: Optimal to Retain Status Quo (No COW)\n\nFigure 2b: Optimal COW Waives “Only as to” Specified Classes of Projects\n\nFigure 2c: Optimal COW Waives “All but” Specified Classes of Projects\n\nFigure 2d: Optimal COW Waives “All” COs “to the Fullest Extent Allowed” by Law\n\nThe foregoing qualitative analysis delivers several insights about the situations in which one would be likely to see different waiver configurations. First are those instances—presumably very common—in which an agent would never be more efficient at pursuing a project than her corporate principal, as depicted in Figure 2a. Absent significant agency costs, such corporations will compose a universe that falls almost entirely outside our data set, simply because they will generally (and efficiently) eschew waivers. Our coding system would thus not detect corporations that mention the renunciation of business opportunities in order to specifically declare that they are not doing so. At any rate, because nonwaiver of corporate opportunities is the legal default, we expect to observe few such disclosures.\n\nSecond, in situations in which the agent has a lower fixed cost than her principal, the optimal allocation of new opportunities will enable the agent to pursue specific types of opportunities closely related to the agent’s specialty, as depicted in Figure 2b. For example, imagine a director who also manages a specialty enterprise on the side. For specific projects related closely to that side enterprise, the director may be the lowest cost producer of a new project, and an efficiency-enhancing waiver would permit the director to pursue such projects.\n\nThird, there are those configurations in which we might expect the fiduciary agent to more easily adapt to pursue projects outside of her specific specialty than the principal, as depicted in Figure 2c. If the agent is more versatile than the principal, the most efficient allocation of corporate opportunities will retain a core set for the principal centered around its specialization but will allocate the remaining opportunities to the agent—an “all but” scope for the waiver.\n\nTwo general business scenarios are plausible candidates for includ­ing agents more versatile than their principals. The first are financial fiduciaries. Venture capitalists, private equity firms, and hedge funds are all capital investors that are well known for making major minority or controlling investments in companies as well as for placing their own principals and employees onto the boards of the companies in which they invest. Both the directors these firms place on a company’s board as well as the firms themselves (if their ownership interest is significant enough) can become the sponsored firm’s fiduciaries. As a result, these fiduciaries would be obliged under the COD’s typical strictures to present any potentially relevant new business prospects to the sponsored entity. Yet, because of the range of other companies in which these financial firms often invest—and in which they might be interested in investing—the financial fiduciary (or her employer) will often be more versatile than the principal. Second, partial corporate spin-offs may create situations in which parent companies remain major shareholders in a subsidiary—and thus owe it fiduciary duties—but in which the parent company remains the lower-cost adapter to newly arising business opportunities.\n\nFinally, and most strangely, is a configuration in which all new business opportunities are waived, as depicted in Figure 2d. This scenario is slightly bizarre because if the agent is the lowest cost pursuer of all new business prospects, it raises the question of why the principal is even in business. If the agent is the more efficient party to pursue all future business, then perhaps the agent should simply buy out the principal’s business. One context in which it might still make sense for a principal to exist as a going concern but waive all business prospects is when the principal is close to capacity on current projects but lacks the ability to scale up. The current COD already treats such limitations of the principal as sufficient to defeat a cause of action, but a broad waiver could serve to clarify and ensure these limitations as dispositive for a factfinder.\n\nB. Ex Ante Versus Ex Post Waivers\n\nThe traditional corporate opportunities doctrine has always per­mitted a corporation’s board to “reject” a business opportunity presented to it by a corporate fiduciary, leaving the fiduciary free to pursue it herself. So a reader may reasonably ask how precisely the ex ante waivers authorized by section 122(17) and its ilk differ from what could be called the ex post waivers already countenanced at common law. After all, the ex post allocation of corporate opportunities to fiduciaries was permissible before section 122(17) and remains so afterward. The key feature of the traditional doctrine was that all corporate opportunities were initially allocated to the corporation. That allocation was mandatory in advance, but it became a waivable default when a fiduciary actually presented a given opportunity to the board.\n\nAdvance waivers will have an important efficiency role to play precisely when it is less costly to allocate ex ante what could in principle be bargained over ex post. One might think that the common law’s preclusion of ex ante waivers was sensible, simply because parties will always prefer paying fiduciaries with money and retaining opportunities (renegotiating as needed later on). Corporate entities might seem uniformly to be the more diversified party and better suited to bear the risks of new business prospects. The modern corporate context enor­mously complicates this picture, however. If the corporate fiduciary is a larger, controlling shareholder or a director who belongs to (and whose duties implicate) a private equity firm, then the fiduciary may well be more highly diversified than the company adopting a COW (especially if that company faces a high cost of insolvency). If opportunities are more efficiently allocated to fiduciaries, and both parties know this, then any additional transaction cost ex post may justify an appropriate ex ante allocation, formerly forbidden by law. None of this is to say that a default allocation of all business opportunities to a corporation’s fiduciaries is the efficient one—only that freeing corporations to replace the default allocation may sometimes produce beneficial results.\n\nIndeed, as the remainder of this section shows, waivers under section 122(17) differ importantly in several respects, which together can make ex ante waivers both less costly to adopt and which could result in different—and more efficient—allocations of corporate opportunities than the allocation resulting from ex post waivers.\n\n1. Transaction Costs. — To a large extent, the distinction between ex ante and ex post waivers hinges on evaluating the frictions of transaction costs. In an idealized Coasean world in which transaction costs are zero, the timing of a waiver may not matter much: Whenever it is efficient for a corporation to renounce an opportunity in its fiduciary’s favor, it will do so, whether ex ante or ex post. In such a setting, as with many other Coasean environments, the legal rule becomes irrelevant. Indeed, even if transaction costs were positive but always the same across time and context, then the choice of legal default would not have great significance. In the actual circumstances of corporate life, however, there are several reasons to expect the presence of transaction costs to sometimes make bargaining between the board and corporate fiduciaries more problematic when done on an ad hoc basis than through an ex ante waiver.\n\nMost obviously, ex ante waivers allow a corporation to commit credibly to ceding certain corporate opportunities (along with other contractual quid pro quos) at the moment of contracting. For instance, if the fiduciary is a controlling shareholder, it may be providing financing to a corporation years before it expects the corporation to encounter the valuable new business prospects it desires the corporation to renounce. This would be difficult to do exclusively with ex post waivers as the board could simply refuse down the road to permit a fiduciary to pursue a promised opportunity, rendering its prior promise valueless. This could matter significantly if what a given fiduciary—say, a controlling share­holder—sought from an investment was in important part new business opportunities it would generate. Further, without an ex ante waiver, the controlling shareholder would have a strong incentive to retain a 100% controlling position in order to ensure opportunities were allocated to it. With an advance waiver, however, a fiduciary can freely diversify when it is efficient for it to do so.\n\nAdvance waivers can thus significantly enhance the bargaining space—in the form of new business prospects—that a corporation has available to transfer in exchange for cheaper financing (or the service of an outstanding officer, the expert input of a venture capitalist, or the rolodex of an outside director). This is a central function of contract: to ensure that parties can credibly commit to follow through on their commercial undertakings, enabling transactions whose performances are separated in time. Without the possibility of ex ante commitments, financing that a fiduciary would have provided in exchange for promised opportunities may not be exchanged, resulting in foregone gains from trade.\n\nAnother limitation on ex post waivers is that the context of fidu­ciaries’ involvement in a corporation is a classic site for the fiduciary’s development of highly specialized skills and abilities. A director or officer typically invests years of work in a company and will usually acquire knowledge and abilities that are valuable at the company but are of less or no use elsewhere. A well-known hold-up problem can thus emerge. For example, the corporation may know that a fiduciary’s service to it is worth, say, $50,000, but only $30,000 to any other company. One can further assume—plausibly, in the context of at least some early-stage companies —that corporate opportunities are one of the most valuable forms of compensation a corporation has to offer. The framework developed in section II.A likewise focused on situations in which the fiduciary could, in terms of comparative advantage, simply be the more efficient party to pursue a new business opportunity. In the absence of enforceable advance waivers, the corporation may promise to provide the fiduciary with a variety of opportunities as compensation but then fail to renounce them as anticipated. If the fiduciary expects this, then she will have significantly dampened incentives to perform the specialized tasks and invest in firm-specific knowledge vis-á-vis what is optimal. As a result, both the corporation and its fiduciaries stand to benefit from an enforceable contract for allocating corporate opportunities among them in advance. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the hold-up problem can obviously run both ways—fiduciaries may hold up the corporation, just as the corporation may hold up its fiduciaries. There seems to be no a priori reason to view one party to be more opportunistic than the other, but the prospect of subsequent hold-up by the firm can be a significant driver for an ex ante waiver.\n\n2. Board Dynamics. — Advance commitments can carry a host of other benefits as well. From a psychological vantage point, the members of a board may find it easier to commit to relinquish prospective business opportunities upfront, in say a charter or contract provision, than in a later ad hoc process when the opportunity is directly presented and the loss of prospective profits is palpable.\n\nDepending on when the adoption of an ex ante waiver occurs, it can also allow a board to avoid a conflicted vote, and potentially, to be insulated from any possible breach of duty of loyalty allegation. For instance, if a COW is adopted in a firm’s IPO charter, then a prospective corporate fiduciary can bargain with the corporation at arm’s length and the pre-IPO board can hold a vote on whether to include the COW without any member needing to recuse herself.\n\n3. Liquidity Constraints. — Another potential driver of advance waiver activity is the influence of liquidity constraints, either at the firm or the fiduciary level. In conventional economic frameworks, agents (the fiduciaries) are wealth and capital constrained and thus unable to “prepay” for the nonmonetary contractual rights that they value most highly. When such rights consist of the allocation of corporate oppor­tunities, the parties may be unable to reach an agreement allocating those projects to the fiduciary even when the fiduciary is the most efficient producer. In this case, of course, the default rule (reserving rights for the corporation) may well be optimal, and thus there would be little need for an ex ante waiver.\n\nIn other instances, however—particularly involving startups—the corporation is the party that is cash poor and capital constrained, hindering its endeavors to attract managers, directors, and potential investors. Although the entrepreneur could offer to remunerate these actors with equity, doing so has a dilutive effect on founders, common shareholders, and employees—an effect that can erode internal incentives to maximize value. One possible alternative in such situations is to offer in-kind modes of compensation, including the allo­cation of property rights over future business opportunities. Symmetric to the discussion above, in-kind compensation of this sort may efficiently require the corporation to waive rights on certain projects in which it is marginally the more efficient producer, thereby providing the fiduciary a platform from which to profit from the new opportunity itself (or alternatively to resell it to the corporation at a less capital-constrained juncture). In this case, executing a seemingly broad waiver may still create value for shareholders if it is combined with attracting significant managerial talent.\n\n4. Rules Versus Standards. — Ex ante waivers may also offer distinct benefits because they authorize private parties, through contract, to replace the immensely complex and nebulous standard of the common law with a rule crafted by the parties themselves (or at least a more refined standard). Even if the parties would ultimately end up with the same allocation of corporate opportunities ex post as ex ante, the ability to substantially clarify that allocation through advance contracting can substantially reduce the scope for litigation costs stemming from either opportunism or honest mistake. To be sure, few contractual provisions define perfectly clear boundaries, and the COWs we observe do not even attempt to do so. Nonetheless, COWs appear to generally replace a highly indefinite standard in one of fiduciary law’s most convoluted areas with significantly better-defined directives. This may be able to deliver substantial cost savings, which can be divided by the parties.\n\nIn addition, the clarity of advance waivers can help establish clear ground rules that serve as the backbone for a long-term commercial relationship. Consider, for example, the 2007 COW disclosed by NetSuite Inc., related to its significant block shareholder and board member Lawrence Ellison. Perhaps as a condition to his involvement with the company, Ellison received a broad COW from NetSuite, which NetSuite’s board of directors approved and disclosed in an SEC filing. After describing the common law standard, NetSuite replaced it with a bright-line rule:\n\n[A]s a majority stockholder, Mr. Ellison might, in certain circumstances, have had a duty to present to the corporation matters that come to him that are within our line of business or would be deemed of interest to us. Under the waiver, we have renounced any such duty, and Mr. Ellison will not need to present any such opportunities to us . . . .\n\nAlthough this waiver is clearly quite broad, it may also have been necessary to bring on Ellison as a significant investor. More importantly, this waiver plausibly helped pave the way for a long-term relationship between Ellison, Oracle, and NetSuite, one that arguably facilitated Oracle’s $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite.\n\nAs noted earlier, the discussion above is meant to demonstrate only that there exist several plausible economic contexts where COWs—even broad ones—are value enhancing for both the beneficiary and the waiving corporation. Such contexts, of course, must uneasily co-exist with omnipresent agency cost problems, in which corporate fiduciaries may use their influence at the company to line their own pockets at shareholders’ expense. To the extent that the former efficiency-related factors outweigh agency cost considerations, Delaware’s reform program has been beneficial for capital investors. To the extent the opposite holds, however, the policy landscape flips. Ultimately, this question is indeterminate within the realm of economic theory alone, and an empirical analysis is warranted. It is to that analysis that Part III turns.\n\nIII. Empirical Analysis\n\nThe historically unprecedented power that many corporations now have to opt out of the COD seems to have been largely overlooked in both case law and law and finance scholarship, generating little systematic analysis of any form. This neglect is surprising, and it seems undeserved for several reasons, ranging from the technical to the policy related.\n\nOn the more technical side, the duty of loyalty is a long-hallowed “sacred cow” of fiduciary principles, traditionally unyielding to private, contractual end-runs. Any systematic shift that concerns when and how corporate entities may embrace such waivers is, at the very least, important to document, given its departure with longstanding legal tradition. Moreover, a cottage industry of corporate governance metrics for incorporated entities has taken root in the last decade. These metrics seek to aggregate and assess when firms opt out of (or otherwise contract around) various corporate law default rules, such as through classified boards, poison pills, duty of care waivers, blank-check stock, and the like. The results can be useful for both scholars and industry groups, such as proxy firms that often address corporate governance votes for institutional clients. Sophisticated producers and consumers of such metrics should be interested in these new mechanisms that permit parties to contract out of the duty of loyalty in order to provide a complete picture of governance arrangements.\n\nMore substantively, COWs bear on central “big picture” debates in corporate law. First, how corporations respond to this new power to tailor can importantly inform scholarly debates regarding whether corporations actually use their capacious legal freedoms to tailor default terms. The question lurking in the background—and one of corporate law’s most profound quandaries—is whether we can expect (or trust) corporations, when freed to do so by law, to adopt optimal corporate governance structures on their own accord.\n\nEven more generally, the empirical experience of COWs goes straight to the heart of a broader normative question: Are COWs socially beneficial? This question arises at the intersection of two distinct but important strains in corporate theory, for the very transaction-cost arguments that motivated the amendments permitting COWs are in significant tension with well-known arguments justifying loyalty as a core check on managerial opportunism and agency costs. Understanding how COWs have played out in the post-deregulatory environment may shed light on other areas where scholars vigorously disagree as to whether fiduciary duties should be mandatory.\n\nThe scant literature on COWs may be—at least in part—an artifact of the practical difficulty of data collection. Most conventional corporate governance provisions are located in relatively discrete and easy-to-isolate sources (such as the charter or shareholder-approved bylaws). As docu­mented in section I.B.2, however, COWs are generally not required to be executed according to any particular regimen, and thus they can be scattered across myriad corporate documents, including charters, bylaws, contracts, board resolutions, and the like. Consequently, searching for waivers requires combing through many (if not all) disclosures made by public companies to securities regulators.\n\nThis Part describes and reports on an empirical analysis of a large sample of COWs disclosed in public corporate filings, which we extracted and coded. Section III.B shows that COWs are common and widespread among public companies within our sample. Moreover, we employ machine-learning techniques to extrapolate our classification procedure outside of our sample, from which we can infer (with significant confidence) that well over one thousand public companies to date have made use of their newfound freedom to contractually allocate corporate opportunities, and they continue to do so at an increasing rate. Waivers appear across industrial sectors, although they are overrep­resented in some of them.\n\nIn addition, this Part employs a variety of empirical methods to examine the normative question of whether corporations have used the freedom to adopt COWs to create or destroy value. First, section III.C reveals that the companies embracing COWs generally tend not to exhibit indicia of questionable investment value or managerial practices. Rather, using standard measures of firm value, COW adopters appear to have markers of value creation and effective management. Second, section III.D reports the results of an event study that measures the value created by adopting a COW, using the stock market’s reaction to their public disclosure as a proxy. Perhaps surprisingly, for those firms for which we could measure returns on stock-price reaction to an announced COW, the market appears to receive such news positively, generating four-day cumulative abnormal returns of between 1% and 1.5%. In addition, as a robustness check, we make use of the lagged implementation of reforms across the nine reforming states. We similarly find evidence of a positive market response to passage of a COW reform among issuers incorporated inside the reforming jurisdiction. These findings go some way to allay fears that corporations adopting COWs are systematically those with worse agency costs.\n\nA. Data\n\nTo investigate the empirical incidence (and effects) of COW adop­tion, we constructed an original data set based on disclosures by publicly traded corporations. Typically, if a public company adopts a waiver of corporate opportunities, the adoption is likely to be disclosed in some form of document that the corporation will file with the SEC. We began by utilizing a “mirror” of the SEC’s EDGAR database, which replicates over twenty-one million issuer filings available from 1995 through March 2016. Because most states’ statutes authorizing COWs permit their execution across a wide spectrum of contracts, resolutions, and corporate governance documents, we did not constrain our examination of EDGAR filings to any specific filing “form” (such as 10-Ks, 8-Ks, or 14-As). To this mirrored data set we applied a Boolean keyword search —similar to what one might use in a Westlaw or LexisNexis query—designed to identify candidate instances of a disclosed COW based on a filing’s similarity with the search query. This process resulted in 10,682 distinct candidate disclosures. Our keyword search was designed to be quite general, but this generality also assured that it was relatively overinclusive.\n\nFrom this large candidate data set, we randomly selected one thousand excerpts for manual coding with the help of a small group of trained research assistants. We designed a coding procedure that employed forty-one distinct variables. Our rubric focused on the three fundamental questions that pertain to any waiver:\n\nHow is a company adopting the waiver? The first seven variables inquire as to how a filing company is adopting a COW, whether in its charter, bylaws, board resolution, or some other kind of disclosure.\n\nWho is covered by the waiver (e.g., a single officer or director, all officers and directors, a controlling shareholder, and so forth)? The next thirty variables inquire into who is covered by the COW. This sequence includes both who is covered at the filing entity (fourteen variables), and, if another entity is mentioned, then who is covered within the man­agement or ownership structure of that other entity (sixteen variables).\n\nWhat is the extent to which a company is waiving the COD as to those covered? The last four variables inquire into whether the scope of the waiver covers all business opportunities, a specified list of such opportunities, all opportunities except for some specified subclass, or a wildcard term waiving corporate opportunities “to the fullest extent allowed by law” (or a substantive semantic equivalent).\n\nAs noted above, the keyword search we used to identify candidate COWs was deliberately overinclusive, flagging a series of documents that were sure to include some “false positives”—snippets that satisfied the keyword criterion but were judged by coders not to reflect COWs.\n\nAfter cleaning the hand-coded sample data, we deployed several measures to enhance the richness and reliability of the data. First, we linked our database to a variety of other publicly available data sets that are widely used in law and finance scholarship (Compustat and CRSP ) to gain insight about the financial and governance characteristics of issuers adopting COWs. Second, we used the hand-coded data to train a machine-learning (ML) classifier, adapting a technique previously developed by one of us to classify the remainder of the snippets algorith­mically. This process not only enabled us to look beyond our sample of COW disclosures with significant confidence, but it also facilitated an alternative means to audit the hand-coded data for errors or inconsistencies.\n\nB. Descriptive Statistics of Waivers\n\nWithin the randomly selected sample of 1,000 candidate SEC filings, our manual coding enterprise yielded 628 responsive documents from 427 unique issuers that contained a bona fide COW disclosure. Of these, 237 were operative provisions in which a filing company enacted a COW, and 391 were disclosures discussing such an operative provision elsewhere. (The remaining candidate documents were deemed nonresponsive—reflecting a 38.5% “false positive” rate from our keyword search. ) Extrapolating proportionally to the full population of 10,682 filings, one would predict upwards of 6,700 responsive disclosures across the population of snippets. And indeed, the ML classifier bears this prediction out, detecting 6,859 COW disclosures from 1,592 unique issuers (averaging around 326 disclosures per year over two decades). These figures alone embody a key finding of this study: Public companies have shown a significant appetite for contracting out of the fiduciary duty of loyalty.\n\nThat appetite, however, was slow to arrive. Figure 3 illustrates the yearly counts of COW disclosures in both our hand-coded sample (left axis; blue line) and in the ML-classified population (right axis; red line). Note that the incidence of disclosed COWs was initially quite low—though not zero—both before and immediately after Delaware’s statutory amendment in 2000. The nonzero incidence of disclosed COWs prior to 2000 is not altogether surprising, given that DGCL section 122(17) was itself a legislative rejoinder to a judicial response to a disclosed waiver. The initial reticence of issuers to embrace the COW from 2000 to 2003, in contrast, is somewhat more notable, and it attracted the attention of commentators at the time. It is plausible that this initial tepid response reflected the post-dot-com hangover that suppressed U.S. financial markets. Whatever the reason, by 2004, the herd of COWs began to propagate with impunity, growing roughly exponentially since (with a slight buckle during the financial crisis). By the turn of the decade, COW disclosures had become commonplace—surpassing 1,000 per year by 2014. There is significant heterogeneity in the forms of disclosure, reflecting the open-ended waiver procedure authorized by most states’ enabling statutes. Just under half of the COW disclosures come from IPO-related filings, approximately 10% appear in each of “current report” (8-K) filings and routine annual or quarterly filings (10-K or 10-Q), and around 7% appear in proxy materials. These figures are nearly identical in both the hand- and machine-coded data.\n\nFigure 3: Total COW Disclosures by Year (Hand Coded Versus ML Classified)\n\nAnother important issue surrounding COWs is where they can be found within firms’ governance documents and other written instru­ments. Table 2 summarizes the location of manually coded waivers across various document types.\n\nTable 2: Location of COW in Corporate Governance Documents\n\nAs Table 2 shows, over three quarters of the COWs in the sample appear to be located in a corporate charter, evincing a degree of commitment to the waiver that is difficult to unwind absent a shareholder vote. That said, nearly 20% of the remainder waivers appear to be spread across a variety of contractual instruments, which are usually—in contrast—susceptible to renegotiation and restructuring by the board alone, without shareholder involvement.\n\nAs previously noted, the wording of most states’ statutes provides appreciable freedom for the drafters to waive broad or narrow categories of corporate opportunities. Given that the default rule in corporate law is no waiver, a broader express waiver signals a greater departure from traditional fiduciary principles. Table 3 summarizes the scope of COWs in the sample.\n\nTable 3: Scope of Waiver\n\nThe breadth of the language in the waivers is notable. About 36% of COW disclosures include at least one waiver that purports to waive “all” corporate opportunities. Just under 48% include at least one waiver purporting to waive “all but” a reserved class or category of opportu­nities. In our estimation, these clearly represent notably broad waivers. In contrast, only just under 17% of COW disclosures waive the doctrine in a more modest fashion (following the actual wording of the statute), limiting the disclaimer to a specified class or category of opportunities.\n\nAnother important scope consideration is how the coded sample allocates waivers across different types of corporate actors. Recall that this group can include corporate directors, officers, and dominant share­holders, all of whom owe a loyalty obligation to the corporation. Table 4 summarizes the target of the coded provisions by the role of the actor—officer, director, or shareholder. (The aggregate counts listed significantly exceed the total number of detected waivers, since waivers routinely apply to multiple classes of actors and sometimes differentiate between subclasses of actors.)\n\nTable 4: Corporate Fiduciaries Covered by COW\n\nTable 4 shows that corporate directors are the most frequent beneficiaries of COWs, covered by nearly three quarters of COWs in our sample—an observation consistent with the aim of the reform to ameliorate conflicts that come from overlapping directorships among venture capital and private equity investors. Perhaps for similar reasons, shareholders are commonly beneficiaries of a waiver as well, covered just under 50% of the time. Notably, however, corporate officers are also routinely included in COW disclosures, with a waiver applying to them nearly half of the time, a factor that is somewhat striking given the full-time nature of an officer’s duties to the firm.\n\nC. Issuer Characteristics of COW Adopters\n\nThe exercise of harvesting, coding, and documenting COW disclo­sures is one of the key contributions of this Article. Nevertheless, it is possible to say somewhat more by linking the disclosing issuers to several other databases providing industry and financial data. A particularly interesting industry source is the Compustat database, which contains information related to corporate governance and financial performance as disclosed in issuers’ annual and quarterly financial reports. We therefore undertook to link the COW database to Compustat (for the period 1994 through 2016). Although this matching process resulted (as it often does) in some loss of data, we were able to match a significant fraction of COW disclosers with their financial information: We ultimately matched approximately 377 issuers in the hand-coded data sample and 1,765 issuers in the machine-classified population.\n\nUsing these matched firms, it is possible to consider a host of firm-level indicia. Preliminary analysis suggests the industry representation of disclosed COWs appears to track that of Compustat firms, with a few notable areas of industry overrepresentation. In particular, oil and gas issuers represent 9.71% of COWs as compared with 3.95% of Compustat firms. Similarly, Business Services issuers represent 13.12% of the pilot sample but only 9.04% of the Compustat universe. The overrep­resentation in both industries plausibly reflects the popularity in these industries of ownership structures characterized by multiple investments across portfolio companies. (Additional research and data collection will be needed to test this hypothesis.)\n\nBecause corporate law (and the permissibility of COWs) is an artifact of state law, adopters’ incorporation jurisdiction is of obvious interest. Perhaps not surprisingly, the public firms embracing COWs are heavily overrepresented by Delaware. Indeed, as Table 5 illustrates, in both the hand-coded and machine-classified data sets, about nine out of ten waiver disclosures come from Delaware corporations, far more than the population-wide proportion of U.S. public companies incorporated in Delaware (which is just north of 50%).\n\nTable 5: COWs in Sample, by State of Incorporation\n\nThe significant overrepresentation of Delaware may be due to a variety of factors, including the fact that Delaware was the earliest mover, the significant network externalities among the Delaware bench and bar, the (possibly) larger comparative size of Delaware-incorp­orated adopters, and the potential remaining invalidity of COWs in many other states.\n\nOne benefit of linking the data on disclosed COWs to other financial databases is that doing so sheds considerable light on both what types of companies embrace waivers and what such adoptions portend for company value. Our empirical analysis provides several interesting insights about the relationship of COW adoption and financial measures related to profitability and value creation. Table 6 illustrates some of these relationships.\n\nTable 6: COW Disclosers Versus Compustat Financial Profiles (1994–2016)\n\nTable 6a: All Entities\n\nTable 6b: Delaware Corporations\n\nSeveral interesting findings emerge from these descriptive statistics. As Table 6a illustrates, COW adopters tend to be smaller on average—not larger—than the mean Compustat issuer on many balance sheet metrics, such as total assets, total liabilities, and long-term debt. Yet the median COW adopter, in contrast, tends to be somewhat larger than the population median, suggesting that COWs are embraced by a narrower cross-section of issuers that are relatively large but not at the highest (or lowest) end of the distribution. In addition, disclosing firms appear to exhibit substantially stronger median income-statement metrics, reve­nues, capital expenditures, and earnings, with roughly commensurate means. One frequently used mea­suring stick of value creation within finance is the annual return that the issuer makes on its overall assets (ROA) —a valuation metric that is largely independent of debt–equity structures. Here, COW disclosers within the two samples tend to outperform the comparator Compustat group (along both mean and median dimensions) in generating returns for outside capital investors. Table 6b reports the same set of valuation metrics but with both samples limited to Delaware incorporated firms. Most of the patterns persist here too (with some variations).\n\n* * *\n\nThe descriptive statistics summarized in this section paint a picture that holds clear relevance to larger policy debates about both COWs specifically and the contractibility of fiduciary duties more generally. In particular, we see no evidence—based on these data—that COWs are systematically embraced by under-achieving firms that use the waiver as a pretext for inefficiently diverting value away from capital investors. To the contrary, these data suggest that waivers are adopted by relatively healthy com­panies with robust cash-flow potential and an established record of delivering attractive returns to their capital investors. This profile is consistent with the shareholder-value-enhancing account of COWs devel­oped in Part II, in which COWs can serve as important complements to building value-enhancing corporate structures by clarifying the bound­aries of what is sometimes considered an incurably opaque and recondite area of corporate fiduciary law.\n\nD. Market Reaction to COW Adoptions\n\nBecause the results discussed in the previous section are based on summary observational data, they are ill suited to support causal inferences about the welfare effects of COW adoption. Many alternative stories could explain the same relationships. For example, it may simply be easier for opportunistic managers to adopt COWs in healthy companies because shareholders might scrutinize board action less. That said, our study’s focus on publicly traded companies permits us to use alternative approaches to develop some insight into causal relationships. One such approach is to examine the extent to which COWs contribute to (or detract from) firm value by measuring the reaction of the capital markets. To the extent that stock prices of public companies tend, on average, to reflect publicly available information, one instructive means for assessing COWs is to consider how market prices react to the first public disclosure an issuer makes about the existence of (or plans for) a waiver. Our data set is amenable to such an inquiry: Indeed, we are able to identify the first disclosure date with all of Compustat-matched firms reported in the previous subsection, which in turn allows us to match these firms to their securities market prices as reported in the CRSP database. We measure market reaction to the disclosure of news using the familiar event-study approach.\n\nIn order to implement an event-study analysis with sample data, we matched the first available disclosure date for each unique COW with securities-market pricing data for each disclosing issuer. This matching process led to the loss of approximately 100 observations from the 377 Compustat-matched firms. To estimate reliably the parameters (αi and βi) for each of the remaining stocks using the underlying asset-pricing model, we additionally required each matched issuer to have sufficient predisclosure days of trading (in this case thirty-five days) at least one month prior to the disclosed COW. This criterion—while consistent with standard practices for avoiding specification error —imposed a significant data limitation: Because many COWs are disclosed as part of either new or newly spun-off companies, many of our COW-disclosing issuers had insufficient trading days preceding the disclosure. In the end, we were able to identify just over eighty distinct issuers that had"
