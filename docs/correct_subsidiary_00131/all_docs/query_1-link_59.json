        "text": "Types of AA Meetings\n\nDiscussion: In Arizona, AA discussion meetings allow one member to share their personal experience, recovery journey, and hope for the future before opening the floor for others to share. They usually begin by referencing a topic from an AA text such as the Big Book, Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, AA Grapevine, or others.\n\nMeditation: Meditation AA meetings feature physical and emotional calmness as a main method of healing. The meetings open with 15 minutes of private mediation and close with an additional 5 minutes of meditation.\n\nOpen: Open AA meetings in Arizona are open to anyone who wants to learn more about the program and how the 12 step recovery model operates. This may include individuals seeking help for alcohol addiction as well as their friends and family members. This allows nonalcoholics to understand the basic meeting structure so they can provide support moving forward."
