        "text": "Abstract (summary): With numerous contributions to geography and literature, Sir Richard Burton is a major Victorian figure. Burton's main importance to his age lies in the fact that he was one of the premier imperial communicators of his time, disseminating numerous aspects of indigenous societies--social, political, economic, religious, sexual--to the Metropole, contributing not only data but helping to define and reinforce Victorian perceptions of the \"outside\" world. As one of the founders of the organisation which became the Royal Anthropological Institute, Burton was instrumental in helping the fledgling science of anthropology gain respectability as a discipline. 'Via' his racial pronouncements, he was representative of the atmosphere which saw the rise of the race-consciousness we associate today with Social Darwinism. Burton was able to assume this role due to a number of personal factors which contributed to his career: among these was an insatiable, obsessive curiosity, remarkable talent for linguistics, and dark, exotic features which allowed him to disguise himself as a native in India and Arabia. Just as important was the fact that during his formative years Burton was reared primarily in an ever-changing European 'milieu', denying him the English social conditioning he would otherwise have had, had he been raised in Britain. This loosened his sense of national identity while at the same time exposing him to an experience of non-British social systems far beyond that of an average contemporary. Thus, when Burton later encountered the non-European indigenous world, he was able to immerse himself in that world to a significant extent, and was able to structure detailed investigations and conjectures regarding those societies. The result was a mass of literary works which sought to aid in a better understanding of the non-European world. It is apparent from passages in Burton's writings that his own feelings regarding indigenous peoples were, despite clear imperialist and racist sensibilities, significantly ambivalent and uncertain, his early exposure to multiple cultures in Europe instilling in him an appreciation of social relativity and complexity which colours his work almost as much as his bellicose, Eurocentric perceptions."
