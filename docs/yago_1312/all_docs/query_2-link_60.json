        "text": "(1821–90). A scholar-explorer, Richard Burton had an inborn love of adventure. He and his fellow explorer John Speke were the first Europeans to stand on the shore of Africa’s Lake Tanganyika. Burton also penetrated forbidden Muslim cities unharmed. With his unique linguistic abilities, he became one of the foremost Western students of Asian-Arabic life and languages of his time.\n\nRichard Francis Burton was born in Torquay, England, on March 19, 1821. He had an unconventional education, while his family moved around in Italy and France, and developed remarkable powers as a linguist at an early age. He entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1840 but was expelled two years later for misbehavior. He spent the next eight years in India and became proficient in several Indian languages as well as in Arabic and Persian. Eventually he learned about 40 languages and dialects. To gather reports for the British, he mingled with people in the bazaars while passing himself off as a native.\n\nIn 1853 Burton—bearded, stained with henna, and disguised in Muslim dress—made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, two of the holiest cities of Islam. Had he been discovered, he would have been killed, as non-Muslims were not allowed in these cities. He described his extraordinary journey in the vivid and intensely personal book Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah (1855–56). Burton led a party into the interior of Somali country in northeast Africa in 1854. Undertaking the most difficult part of the journey alone, he was the first European to visit the forbidden city of Harer (now Harar, Ethiopia) without being executed. He described his adventure in his classic First Footsteps in East Africa (1856).\n\nAfter serving in the Crimean War, Burton resumed his explorations in Africa. In 1857–58 he and Speke led an expedition in search of the source of the Nile River. By the time they reached Lake Tanganyika, Burton was severely ill with malaria and had to turn back. (However, Speke pressed on, locating Lake Victoria, the Nile’s chief source.) (See also Africa, exploration of.)\n\nIn 1861 Burton entered the British foreign service. He served as consul at Fernando Po (now a province of Equatorial Guinea); Santos, Brazil; Damascus, Syria; and Trieste (now in Italy)."
