        "text": "Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton was born in 1821 and died in 1890. His life, therefore, spans most of the 19th century. It was an extravagant, adventurous, colorful period. With Victoria on the throne, England was gathering up its empire from various corners of the globe, chiefly in the East.It was the perfect time for Richard to make his splash, and he dived into it with the greatest relish and made waves that even today are still rippling outward. Six feet in height, he was taller than most men of his century. Mentally and physically he was more towering by far than his contemporaries in service.\n\nRichard was the son of Lt. Col. Joseph Netterville Burton of the British Army, a gentleman born, and the grandson of the Rev. Edward Burton, priest of the Anglican Church in Tyam and a landholder. Richard's father was born in Ireland, but all were English by blood.\n\nWhether having a priest for a grandfather exerted any conscious or unconscious part in Richard's definitely offbeat bents can never be known, but he was deeply concerned with religion in his own personal way throughout his life. He had no interest in the organized church, and his skepticism was ever present and ever sharp.\n\nRichard, in due time, became a cadet of the army of East India Company, which maintained its own military establishment, augmented by the army of Great Britain. From the beginning Richard stood out from the ranks of men in the ``boss' company's army. He was a linguist of remarkable skill. Even en route to India he found three Indian servants in the ship's company and immediately pressed them in service as his personal language instructors. Thus he arrived in India with at least a good smattering of the Hindustani tongue.\n\nWherever he went after that he studied the languages, beliefs and customs of the people around him. He was, without special training in the science, an ethnologist of remarkable skill. Long before he died he was master of 29 languages and many dialects.\n\nAs a grass-green member of the army Richard was singled out for secret service missions, partly because of his ability with languages and partly because he had a pure genius for suddenly transferring himself into some nameless nomad, or teacher of mysticism in suitable rags of robes, representing any one of several races. In my view Richard Burton, captain and knight, was a more consummate actor than the Richard Burton (real name Richard Jenkins) who gained fame as an actor a century later.\n\nSir Richard Burton was a man who held firm opinions about everything that came to his knowledge, and he shocked his Victorian readers deeply and regularly with frank comment that was well outside the pale of common drawing room conversation.\n\nFor example he wrote boldly about sex, his own practices and the many strange mores he investigated. He was the first widely published, widely read writer to declare that sex was not intended as a mere burdensome gift of the woman for the purpose of propagation. He declared that it was an act meant to be enjoyed fully and equally by women and men. Wherever he traveled, he managed to arrange for the company of a bed mate. He adhered strictly to the French dictum that ``If you wish to learn a foreign language well you must sleep with the teacher.'\n\nThe white man, grouped often under the heading ``Western civilization,' had not then spread his plagues so thoroughly, and Sir Richard seems to have missed their curse except on one occasion. While under treatment for a spell of illness or a wound, both of which he suffered fairly often, it was discovered that Burton had somewhere contracted an incipient case of syphilis.\n\nOddly, soon after that Sir Richard suffered a severe case of typhoid fever, which apparently burned out the syphilis. No sign of it was ever seen again.\n\nBurton's greatest adventure was his pilgrimage to Mecca. Its risks were enormous, and discovery meant certain death to an Englishman. He began the journey disguised as an Afghan. Later in the journey he changed to a Turk and one or two other foreign travelers. But he made it. It remained the triumph of his life, despite many other spectacular accomplishments.\n\nBurton was converted to the Islamic religions fairly soon after he arrived in Sind, where he was first stationed in India. Close friends felt that he remained inwardly faithful to the Sufi sect of Islam all his life. His Catholic wife, the adoring Isobel, firmly declined to believe this, as she did the stories of other women. We shall meet this strong-minded, unconventional and devoted lady two weeks hence in the third and final part of this series.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
