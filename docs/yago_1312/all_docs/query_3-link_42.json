        "text": "CAPTAIN SIR RICHARD FRANCIS BURTONThe Secret Agent Who Made the Pilgrimage to Mecca, Discovered\n\nthe Kama Sutra, and Brought the\n\nArabian Nights to the West\n\nBy Edward Rice\n\nScribners, $35\n\nReviewed by Jules Wagman\n\nA century ago, the name of Capt. Sir Richard Francis Burton was a household word in Britain and much of the Western world. Today, if you haven't read this book or seen the recent movie, Mountains of the Moon, you have probably never heard of him. He died just 100 years ago.\n\nThe subtitle of this biography describes Burton's bona fides, though it omits mentioning his part in 19th century efforts to find the source of the Nile River in equatorial Africa.\n\nBurton failed to win a commission in the British army, but in 1842 won a lieutenancy of the army of the East India Company, which effectively ran those parts of India controlled by the English. He was a linguist, explorer, amateur philosopher, adventurer, hater of slavery, lover of women, drug addict, spy.\n\nHis family lived on the continent while Burton was growing up and consequently he felt uncomfortable with his fellow English officers in India. He experimented with religion. Born a Protestant, he became a Hindu and a snake priest in his first year in India, then a Muslim of the Sufi brotherhood (during which time he made his pilgrimage to Mecca), finally he married a Roman Catholic (Isabel Arundell, 10 years his junior) and died in the rites of the church.\n\nBurton made detailed notes of his adventures and wrote about them. Author Edward Rice calls those publications books but does not tell us if they were financial successes. Since Burton was always in need of money, we can deduce that his writings had very small audiences, or that they never paid him very much.\n\nIt was not until late in his life, when Burton was exiled by the British Foreign Office to be consul at Trieste (600 pounds a year with virtually nothing to do except stay out of trouble), that he neared literary success with his translation and presentation of the Kama Sutra and the Arabian Nights.\n\nThe Kama Sutra, or Love Verses, still well-known today, is an erotic Indian work from the fourth or fifth century. He was preparing an edition of 2,000 when he died. He also translated other Eastern erotic writings, which his widow burned.\n\nThe Arabian Nights is also known as the Thousand and One Nights. A young woman, in hopes of keeping her head on her shoulders, tells the king stories for a thousand and one nights. At the end of that time, and having also born him three children, she is freed from the death sentence and becomes his queen.\n\nBurton was not the first translator of the Arabian Nights, but he was the first to leave nothing out. He used his footnotes to attack earlier translators for their prudish omissions or for having used stilted language.\n\nFor one so singularly unsuccessful financially, Burton created a good deal of emotion in death. His widow received 2,000 letters of condolence. A public subscription raised nearly 700 pounds for the tomb, erected in the form of a stone desert tent in London's Mortlake Catholic cemetery. Perhaps, like many other writers, painters and musicians, he was more revered in death than life.\n\nBurton's linguistic abilities and his understanding of how the natives thought and lived led him into secret missions for the East India Company. His information contributed to the eventual subjugation of the entire Indian continent by Britain.\n\nTo the English language he contributed the word \"safari\" and ESP, which he called extra-sensuous perception.\n\nIn Africa in 1858, Burton was the first white man to see Lake Tanganyika; his expedition companion and rival John Hanning Speke was the first white at Lake Victoria. It was before that expedition that Burton was seriously wounded in a battle near the Somali port of Berbera. A spear went through his cheek and left him with a prominent scar, from eye to jaw.\n\nAfter Burton left the army, he became a British consul in western equatorial Africa, then in South America and finally in Damascus where his knowledge of Arabic and the Levant propelled him into high-level back-room politics. When a power play didn't work out, he took the fall for the British crown and as consolation was given the safe, quiet consulship in Trieste. It was there that he did much of his writing. At one time, he had 11 different works in progress on 11 different desks.\n\nJules Wagman, retired books editor of the Cleveland (Ohio) Press, now lives in Jacksonville."
