We will be writing a Master Plan for the Philomath Museum, re-visioning how we use the spaces in and around the building with an emphasis on historic preservation, accessibility, and education.\n\nThe Philomath Museum has two galleries: the Moreland Gallery, in which we showcase exhibitions featuring local and regional artists, and the History Gallery is used for exhibitions showcasing artifacts from our collection.\n\nWe hold a number of education programs throughout the year including lectures, school field trips, and our Free Family Day event. We also partner with Maxtivity, a local arts organization, to host art-based summer camps.\n\nThe collection of BCHS includes approximately 140,000 artifacts, many of which focus on Benton County history. In the mid-2000s we acquired the collection of the Horner Museum, which was part of Oregon State University.\n\nPopulation(s) Served\n\nAdults\n\nChildren and youth\n\nThe Corvallis Museum opened in 2021 in a new LEED-certified building designed by Allied Works Architecture.
