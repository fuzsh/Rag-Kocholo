The Sidekick is a character who appears in Oracle of Ages.[1]

Biography[]

The Sidekick can be found accompanying the Comedian in Lynna City in the present. They stand together near the river outside of a house with a blue roof. Despite being the Comedian's Sidekick, he does not seem to enjoy his jokes very much.[2] This is remedied when Link gives the comedian the Cheesy Mustache and he now feels they can make a better comedy routine.[3] In a Linked Game, the Sidekick will relocate to the outside of the shop later in the game, where he remarks about the gloomy state of the city.[4]
