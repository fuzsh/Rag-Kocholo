        "text": "Recently being introduced, Sidekick let you take your signature ally, or identity-specific ally to give them extra life. They can now heal when you heal as well.\n\nIt was an interesting card to come out as it even more importance to that ally. Then cards like side-by-side was introduced to beef it up a little more.\n\nThis allowed a way to ready up and heal that ally (and hero) while in hero form or, instead, give them (and you) an extra attack and thwart.\n\nThis had me thinking, what would be the best ally cards to use this with.\n\nA lot of the signature ally cards out there will have abilities when they are first played, or one time only abilities, that wouldn’t make sense for this card. I mean, you could still use it and beef up that ally with upgrades and attachments. It would make a bit more sense then but that is pretty run of the mill type stuff.\n\nI wanted to look into more specific interesting examples.\n\nBlack Cat\n\nWhat makes Black Cat (Spider-Man’s Signature Ally) a great choice is that she takes no consequential damage when she attacks. This allows the ready-up card Side-By-Side to always give her more attack and you don’t have to worry about her knocking herself out with consequential damage. Spider-Man is also the Avenger trait, so you can give it to her through Honorary Avenger and use different Avenger (or other) upgrades to make her attack stat even higher.\n\nCaptain Marvel\n\nSpider-Woman’s signature ally Captain Marvel is an incredibly strong choice. After Captain Marvel uses her basic power you get to draw a card, plus the 2 attack 2 thwart is good too. Having her stay out on the table getting you constant card draw is incredibly strong. Then using Side-by-side to ready her up and draw more, yes please.\n\nAnt-Man\n\nThis is a more basic pick because there is no “special thing” the ability box does butttttt, getting 3 attack or 3 thwart is amazing. So this is still pretty solid and a bit more basic but wanted to call it out.\n\nQuicksilver\n\nBeing able to ready up Quick to attack twice is nice. But now, you can heal him and ready him up again and attack with him even more. Then you use a side-by-side to get his attack to 3 and be able to ready up again with his natural action, very strong stuff. Also, with Quicksilver being an Avenger you can add attack onto it.\n\nMantis\n\nMantis, part of the Drax deck, isn’t one I thought about at first but it makes a lot of sense. Drax wants to get hit to build his vengeance counters up and Mantis allows you to heal Drax. Now, with Side-by-side she will be able to heal up, to heal Drax even more (and the card heals Drax). While it doesn’t help you with attack or making Mantis be stronger, anything you can do to build up Drax is sweet.\n\nVivian\n\nVivian, part of the Vision deck, is one of the ultimate Voltron Ally builds out there. She can swing for 3, has several ready up abilities with Repair Events. But now, you can give her even more life and use side-by-side. Incredibly strong stuff.\n\nMs. Marvel\n\nThe Nova Ally, Ms. Marvel, allows you to recur events back to your hand. Nova, gets to play his events card pretty cheap so if you get a good attack card, it would be nice to use it essentially 3 times. One the first time, exhaust Ms. Marvel to get the card back and use it again. Then use side-by-side to ready up Ms. Marvel and do it again. It becomes an expensive option but if the stars align, it can be very strong.\n\nVEN#m\n\nThis can actually be very broken. VEN#m is an interesting signature ally in the Sp//Dr kit. VEN#m can come in and be a 5 attack or 5 thwart ally (if you use 4 sync ratios to pay for them). Then, use a Side-By-Side … you can swing for 5. Ready them up and heal, then swing for 6. That’s so incredibly strong. Great ally to use for it.\n\nShadowcat\n\nThis is one of the weaker pics but for Colossus, it’s a good one. Colossus isn’t great at thwarting so anything you can do to ready up your signature ally to help you thwart more, definitely strong. And since she can get around patrol and crisis icons, even stronger.\n\nPsylocke\n\nThe Angel hero is strong at attack and now, you can ready up his signature ally, Psylocke, to have Psylocke ready to attack more that readies up Angel, it’s a whole ready up cycle that if timed up, can really help clear out the board.\n\nHoney Badger\n\nThis is just like Psylocke above. If you time things right, you can keep using Honey Badger to heal, ready up and in turn, ready up X-23 to do massive damage and thwarting.\n\nCable\n\nThis kind of depends on how much attack Cable gets from Deadpool putting acceleration tokens on the main scheme. He has the ability to swing for 5 and now you can add more life to him and ready him up to do constant damage.\n\nIf there are any other options that you have seen, make sure to write it down below!"
