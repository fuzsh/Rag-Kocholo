        "text": "Dagoth Ur is the Morrowind antagonist, G-Man is the creepy dude in the background of the Half Life series pulling the strings.\n\nMine:\n\nMale: Ramza Beoulve (Final Fantasy Tactics)\n\nFemale: Sarah Kerrigan (Starcraft)\n\nMysterious: Cardinal Draclau (Final Fantasy Tactics)\n\nWhile Cardinal Draclau is a man, he is also the first point where the story of FFT veers right into the ridiculous. I won’t spoil what happens for anyone who hasn’t played FFT and is planning on doing so, but it was just a great turning point in the game.\n\nI feel like I could fill this whole list right out of Torment…\n\nSo, with that restriction, let’s go with\n\nMale: Nameless One (runner up, Dak’kon)\n\nFemale: Ravel (distant runner up, Fall From Grace)\n\nMystery: Nordom (runner up Coaxmetal)\n\nIt’s pretty hard to define a good character in a vacuum (if they’re good, it’s often because the other characters are good too), but heck :\n\nMale : Francis York Morrigan. I mean he’s the weirdest, most charismatic lead ever. Emily Wyatt might also be the best supporting woman character. In fact if you don’t mind a bit of surrealism and shitty texture, I guess Deadly Premonitions has a lot of great characters.\n\nFemale : there aren’t a lot of great women character, are there ? The Boss in MGS 3 is a strong character, even tough the plot as a whole is a real mess. The fight with her is one of the most beautiful encounters ever.\n\nWeird : there are lots of anthropomorphic mascots, but none is is funnier than Max. Max is my little buddy, and he really cracks me up. Bonus : he’s a psycho rabbit."
