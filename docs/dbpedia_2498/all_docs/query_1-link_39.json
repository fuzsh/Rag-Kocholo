Fourth St. begins its Free Fitness Weeks, now through January 13. This entails free use of the space with no strings attached: swimming, aerobics, strength training, cardio, basketball, etc.\n\nJanuary 3\n\nShort North Tavern begins displaying thirteen pieces by local artist W.C. Hemming, from now through February 3. HIs style is somewhat crude, with muted tones, but I actually rather like what I’ve seen of his work thus far.\n\nNorthside Library has an adult book discussion group for Tracy Chevalier’s Girl With A Pearl Earring, 6pm.\n\nJanuary 5"
