        "text": "2023\n\nAmnesty International recorded at least 1,153 executions in 16 countries – a 31% increase from the 883 executions in 20 countries in 2022 – marking the highest total since 2015 but the lowest number of executing countries on record with the organization. As in previous years, execution totals do not include the estimated thousands of executions carried out by the world’s leading executioner, China, where execution data is considered a state secret; secrecy practices and challenges accessing information in Afghanistan, North Korea, Palestine, Syria, and Vietnam also created difficulties in identifying minimum totals. This worldwide increase was primarily driven by a 48% rise in executions in Iran, which accounted for 74% of executions worldwide. Iran (at least 853 executions), Saudi Arabia (172 executions), Somalia (at least 38 executions), the U.S. (24 executions), and Iraq (at least 16 executions) were the top five countries responsible for recorded executions. Compared to the prior year, all top five countries, except Saudi Arabia which experienced a slight decrease (196 in 2022), experienced an increase in executions.\n\nThe number of new death sentences increased by 20% to 2,428 in 2023, the highest total since 2018; however, difficulties accessing information across countries makes annual comparisons difficult. 52 countries handed down new death sentences, representing no change in the total number of countries from the year prior, although the composition of countries differed slightly. Bahrain, Comoros, South Sudan, Sudan, and Zambia did not hand down death sentences in 2023 despite having done so in 2022. Belarus, Cameroon, Japan, Morocco/Western Sahara and Zimbabwe imposed death sentences in 2023 after a hiatus. Bangladesh (from 169+ in 2022 to 248+ in 2023), Egypt (from 538 to 590), Iraq (from 41+ to 138+), Kenya (from 79 to 131), Lebanon (from 2+ to 11+), Malaysia (from 16+ to 38+), Nigeria (from 77+ to 246+), and Somalia (from 10+ to 31+) all experienced significant increases in the number of new death sentences imposed. There were at least 27,687 people known to be under sentence of death at the end of the year.\n\nCommutations or pardons occurred in 27 countries, as well as 9 exonerations that occurred in Kenya (5), the U.S. (3), and Zimbabwe (1). Worldwide efforts towards abolition continued, with abolition bills reviewed in the parliaments of Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, and Zimbabwe. The elimination of the mandatory death penalty in Malaysia was enacted, as was Pakistan’s elimination of the death penalty for drug-related offenses.\n\nView the full Amnesty 2023 report here.\n\nCountries with the Most Confirmed Executions in 2023*\n\n*Note: Minimum execution totals are unknown for China (estimated in the thousands), Afghanistan, North Korea, Palestine, Syria, and Vietnam. The + indicates that more executions are suspected but unable to be verified. See Amnesty’s report for the full list (p. 39).\n\nCountries with the Most Death Sentences in 2023**\n\n**Death-sentencing totals unknown for Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. See Amnesty’s report for the full list (p. 40).\n\n2022\n\nAmnesty International recorded at least 883 executions in 20 countries – a 53% increase from the 579 executions in 18 countries in 2021 – marking the highest total since 2017. As in previous years, execution totals do not include the estimated thousands of executions carried out by the world’s leading executioner, China, where execution data is considered a state secret; secrecy practices in North Korea, Vietnam, Syria, and Afghanistan also created difficulties in identifying totals. This worldwide increase was primarily driven by a 59% increase in the Middle East and North Africa Region, where 93% of known executions were carried out; Iran was responsible for 70% of executions in the region, while Saudi Arabia was responsible for 24%. China (unknown, estimated 1,000s), Iran (at least 576 executions), Saudi Arabia (196 executions), Egypt (24 executions), and the U.S. (18 executions) were the top five countries responsible for executions. Compared to the prior year, executions in Iran increased by 83% and executions in Saudi Arabia tripled.\n\nThough hard to determine, there were at least 2,016 death sentences amongst 52 countries in 2022 compared to 2,052 death sentences amongst 56 countries in 2021. Bahrain, Comoros, Laos, Niger, and South Korea all imposed death sentences after a hiatus. Belarus, Cameroon, Japan, Malawi, Morocco/Western Sahara, Oman, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Zimbabwe were amongst the countries with executions but without any new death sentences in 2022. There were at least 28,282 people known to be under sentence of death at the end of the year.\n\nKazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic abolished the death penalty in 2022. View the full Amnesty 2022 report here.\n\nCountries with the Most Confirmed Executions in 2022*\n\n*Note: Execution totals unknown for North Korea, Vietnam, Syria, and Afghanistan. The + indicates that more executions are suspected but unable to be verified.\n\nCountries with the Most Death Sentences in 2022**\n\n**Death-sentencing totals unknown for Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Qatar, and Syria.\n\n2021\n\nAmnesty International recorded at least 579 executions in 18 countries in 2021, up 19.9% from the 483 confirmed executions carried out in 18 countries in 2020. The total, which was down 43.9% from the 1,032 confirmed executions carried out five years earlier (2016) and 64.6% below the 25-year-high of 1,634 executions reported in 2015, was the second lowest Amnesty has recorded since 2010. The 18 countries that carried out executions remained the lowest since Amnesty began its record-keeping. As in previous years, the execution totals do not include the estimated thousands of executions carried out in China, where execution data is considered a state secret. Secrecy practices in North Korea, Vietnam, Oman, and Belarus also prevented Amnesty from determining the number of executions in those countries. Excluding China, three middle Eastern countries — Iran (at least 314), Egypt (at least 83), and Saudi Arabia (65) — collectively accounted for 80% of the confirmed executions in 2021. Executions in Iran increased by 68 in 2021, the highest since it carried out more than 500 executions in 2017 and up 28% from the 246 confirmed executions in 2020. Saudi Arabia more than doubled the number of people it put to death in 2020 (27). The 11 executions in the U.S. were the ninth most recorded in any nation, although Vietnam’s and North Korea’s execution totals are not known and were likely higher.\n\nWith COVID-19 restrictions on courts fully or partially lifted, the number of death sentences imposed throughout the world rose sharply in 2021. The 2,052 confirmed death sentences imposed in 2021 was 38.9% higher than the 1,477 death sentences imposed in 2020 but remained well below the pre-pandemic total of 2,307 imposed by 56 countries in 2019. Death sentences soared in the South Asian nations of Bangladesh (at least 181), India (144), and Pakistan (at least 129), up from 113+, 77, and 49+ in 2020. But again those totals were significantly below the 162 death sentences imposed in India in 2018 and the more than 632 death sentences imposed in Pakistan and more than 220 imposed in Bangladesh in 2019. At least 18 countries imposed more death sentences than the 18 new death sentences imposed in the United States in 2021, and given the absence of information from which to confirm death sentences in some countries, the number is likely higher.\n\nAmnesty reported that at least 28,670 people were known to be under sentence of death at the end of 2021, with nine countries contributing to 82% of that total. That total was up fractionally (0.4%) from the 28,567 reported to on death rows around the world at the end of 2020.

The total — which was the third consecutive year in which confirmed executions reached a 10-year low and the sixth year in a row in which confirmed executions declined — was 70.6% below the 25-year-high total of 1,634 reported executions in 2015. As in previous years, the execution total does not include the estimated thousands of executions carried out in China, which treats data on the death penalty as a state secret. Excluding China, 88% of all reported executions took place in just four countries — Iran (246+), Egypt (107+), Iraq (45+), and Saudi Arabia (27) — which had combined for 86% of reported executions in 2019. The 17 executions in the U.S. were the sixth most recorded in any nation, although Vietnam’s and North Korea’s execution totals are not known and were likely higher.\n\nAmnesty recorded at least 1,477 death sentences in 54 countries in 2020, down 35.9% from the 2,307 confirmed death sentences imposed in 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted criminal proceedings across the world. Amnesty believes the actual number of death sentences was higher, again noting that it did not receive information on death sentences imposed in three countries — Malaysia, Nigeria and Sri Lanka — that had reported significant numbers of death sentences in previous years. At least 20 countries imposed more death sentences than the 18 new death sentences imposed in the United States in 2020, and given the absence of information from which to confirm death sentences in some countries, the number is likely higher.\n\nAmnesty reported that at least 28,567 people were known to be on death rows around the world at the end of 2019, 7% more than the 26,604 people known to have been on global death rows at the end of 2019. With known death sentences significantly down, the increase more likely reflects better information gathering, rather than a surge in the death-row population.

The total — one of the smallest since Amnesty began tracking executions in 1979 — was a 5% decrease from the at least 690 executions recorded in 2018 and was down 60% from the 25-year-high total of 1,634 reported executions in 2015. As in previous years, the execution total does not include the estimated thousands of executions carried out in China, which treats data on the death penalty as a state secret. Excluding China, 86% of all reported executions took place in just four countries — Iran (251), Saudi Arabia (184), Iraq (100+), and Egypt (32+). The 22 executions in the U.S. were the sixth most of any nation, although Vietnam’s and North Korea’s execution totals are not known.\n\nAmnesty recorded at least 2,307 death sentences in 56 countries in 2019, down 9% from the 2,531 reported in 2018. However, Amnesty believes the actual number of death sentences was higher, given that the organization did not receive information on death sentences imposed in three countries — Malaysia, Nigeria and Sri Lanka — that had reported significant numbers of death sentences in previous years. The U.S. ranked 12th in death sentences known to have been imposed. Death sentences imposed in China, Iran, North Korea, and Syria were not known.\n\nAmnesty reported that at least 26,604 people were known to be on death rows around the world at the end of 2019, 38% more than the 19,336 people known to have been on global death rows at the end of 2018. With known death sentences down, the increase more likely reflects better information gathering, rather than a surge in the death-row population.

As in previous years, the execution total does not include the estimated thousands of executions carried out in China, which treats data on the death penalty as a state secret. Five countries accounted for 84% of all recorded executions—Iran (253), Saudi Arabia (149), Vietnam (85), Iraq (52) and Egypt (43). The 25 executions in the U.S. were the seventh most of any nation.\n\nAmnesty recorded at least 2,531 death sentences in 54 countries in 2018, down 2% from the 2,591 reported in 2017, and a 19% decline from the reported 3,117 death sentenced imposed in 55 countries in 2016. The U.S. ranked 12th in death sentences known to have been imposed.\n\nAmnesty reported that at least 19,336 people were known to be on death rows around the world at the end of 2018, a 12% decline from the 21,919 people known to be on death row globally at the end of 2017.

At least 1,634 executions were carried out in 2015, the highest number in 25 years. This figure does not include the thousands of executions that were believed to be carried out in China. Beginning in 2009, Amnesty International ceased to publish minimum figures for the use of the death penalty in China, where such statistics are considered to be state secrets. 89% of all recorded executions in 2015 took place in 3 countries: Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. The United States ranked 5th in documented executions (28) in 2015. However, the U.S. may actually also rank behind Vietnam. A report of the Vietnam Ministry of Public Security that became public in February 2017 revealed that the country secretly executed 429 prisoners between August 6, 2013 and June 30, 2016. At least 1,998 people are known to have been sentenced to death in 2015, a decrease compared to 2014. View the Amnesty 2015 report here.\n\n2014\n\nAt least 22 countries were known to have carried out judicial executions in 2014, the same as in 2013. At least 607 executions were carried out in 2014. This figure does not include the thousands of executions that were believed to be carried out in China. Beginning in 2009, Amnesty International ceased to publish minimum figures for the use of the death penalty in China, where such statistics are considered to be state secrets. The United States ranked 5th in documented executions (35) in 2014. However, the U.S. may actually also rank behind Vietnam. A report of the Vietnam Ministry of Public Security that became public in February 2017 revealed that the country secretly executed 429 prisoners between August 6, 2013 and June 30, 2016. At least 2,466 people are known to have been sentenced to death in 2014, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The increase was mainly due to large numbers of death sentences in Egypt and Nigeria, where mass sentences were imposed in single cases with large numbers of defendants. View the Amnesty 2014 report here.\n\n2005-2010\n\n2010: At least 23 countries were known to have carried out judicial executions in 2010. At least 527 executions were carried out in 2010. This figure does not include the thousands of executions that were believed to be carried out in China. Last year Amnesty International decided not to publish minimum figures for the use of the death penalty in China, where such statistics are considered to be state secrets. View the Amnesty 2010 report here.\n\n2009: Eighteen countries carried out executions in 2009. Amnesty International documented the executions of 714, but this total does not include figures from China where the majority of the world’s executions take place. The real global total is significantly higher. The five countries with the most executions are Iran (388+), Iraq (120+), Saudi Arabia (69+), the United States (52), and China, which executed more people than the rest of the world combined, according to same report by Amnesty International.\n\n2008: At least 2,390 people were executed in 25 countries around the world in 2008, while 8,864 people were sentenced to death in 52 countries. Amnesty International reports that executions almost doubled in number from 1,252 in 2007. Ninety-five percent of all known executions were carried out in only six countries: China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Pakistan and Iraq.\n\n2007: In 2007, a minimum of 1,252 people were executed in 24 countries and at least 3,347 people were sentenced to death in over 50 countries. Just five countries – China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the USA – carried out the overwhelming majority (88%) of known executions in the world last year. In China execution figures are a state secret meaning their total number of executions could be much higher.\n\n2006: In 2006, there were 1,591 executions around the world. Amnesty International reported that executions worldwide fell by more than 25% in 2006, down from 2,148 in 2005 to 1,591. Of all known executions that took place in 2006, 91% were carried out in six countries: China, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Sudan and the United States.\n\n2005: In 2005, there were at least 2,148 executions in 22 countries around the world. China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United States were responsible for 94 percent of these known executions. The following countries executed defendants in 2005 (figures are only of confirmed executions):\n\nSource: Amnesty International"
