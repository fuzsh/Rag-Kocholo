Also out of all of the Sonic side characters, why choose Tails, wouldn't Big the Cat be a better choice for worst sidekick\n\nPS also Dan, Echidnas do exist, see\n\nCyborgGinger\n\nNew member\n\nApr 1, 2011\n\n69\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#4\n\nI hope we're going to get Best Sidekick ever now. HK-47, meatbags (does he count as a sidekick?)\n\nApr 8, 2008\n\n2,338\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#5\n\nIf you can argue that Luigi is a costar and not a sidekick, then I can argue that Slippy is a supporting character and not a sidekick. Falco is more the sidekick than Slippy is, seeing as how he and Fox are usually the ones leading the pack.\n\nGreenTeaGal\n\nNew member\n\nApr 19, 2011\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#6\n\nI feel like this isn't even a contest. Slippy is worst by far. I barely played the original Starfox for 10 minutes before that frog got on my nerves. Tails(AI) on the other hand was cute, eager and relatively helpful. He never needed saving because he could not die. Tails was my first experience with CO-OP gaming. When you had 2 players of equal skill tails is the most useful and immortal sidekick you could ask for in that game. I used him to beat Robotnic all the time, helping Sonic ward off death / ring loss. Tails: helping Sonic avoid the game over screen since the 1990's. Nothing but love for tails. He needs to step out from Sonic's shadow and get his own game.\n\nscorptatious\n\nThe Resident Team ICO Fanboy\n\nMay 14, 2009\n\n7,405\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#7\n\nUrena Howard said:\n\nI feel like this isn't even a contest.

I'd actually rather have Tails as my wing man.\n\nCharli\n\nNew member\n\nNov 23, 2008\n\n3,445\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#9\n\nUfff will refrain from pointing out all the wrong regarding Tails. That's what obnoxious fanboiz do. But I am noting there is much wrong stated about Tails.\n\nAnd knowing both franchises back to front would have made this a little less funny I suppose (I still find this a lackluster installment guys, what gives). Slippy wins this one by a landslide.\n\nRituro\n\nCritwrencha\n\nSep 18, 2008\n\n151\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#10\n\nMad props for a Portland Winterhawks jersey. Great team this year. Wouldn't be shocked at all to see them winning a Memorial Cup if everyone stays healthy.\n\nColaWarVeteran\n\nNew member\n\nJul 27, 2010\n\n110\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#11\n\nNot sure if it was intentional but I find it funny they chose the bunny picture to put over Seven of Nine since there is a character from Sonic SatAM and the comics that is a partially roboticized female rabbit.\n\nRakor\n\nNew member\n\nMar 9, 2010\n\n302\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#13\n\nOk, who is the hero, videogames or comic, that has the greatest number of sidekicks simultaneously?\n\nMinions, hired hands, and military units not counting. Has to be people that you can look at and say, yeah thats a sidekick.\n\nProverbial Jon\n\nNot evil, just mildly malevolent\n\nNov 10, 2009\n\n2,093\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#14\n\nOh god! To Seven of Nine is now a verb and I'm alright about it!\n\nAlthough Slippy is annoying as all hell and I'd happily see him never return to a Star Fox game, he is actually marginally more useful than Kyle makes out. If he survives a level and makes it to the final boss then he will reveal the boss' power level, or health bar, which is a pretty useful thing to have. Without Slippy you have no idea how close you are to beating the bosses.\n\nThat's honestly all I have...\n\nArslan Aladeen\n\nNew member\n\nOct 9, 2012\n\n371\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#15\n\nUrena Howard said:\n\nI feel like this isn't even a contest.

He helped Sonic get aboard Wing Fortress Zone in 2, and the boss fight in Marble Zone in Sonic 3 is impossible to do without him. Slippy's only purpose seems to be to annoy the spit out of you.\n\nlord.jeff\n\nNew member\n\nOct 27, 2010\n\n1,468\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#16\n\nEvery Tails argument seemed like it was made by someone who has only ever played Sonic 2 because tails is awesome to play as in 3 and his relationship to sonic is explained in Adventure and that he had his own game.\n\nGreenTeaGal\n\nNew member\n\nApr 19, 2011\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n#17\n\nscorptatious said:\n\nUrena Howard said:\n\nI feel like this isn't even a contest.
