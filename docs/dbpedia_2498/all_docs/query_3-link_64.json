        "text": "Sidekick drones are totally unbalanced (Overpowered : OP)\n\nThe drones have recently been massively buffed: these parts now make 100% damage, ALL of the drones, including the Sidekick drones.\n\nWith the flying drones I can understand it, which one could shoot down very easily with machine guns. The rocket drones are seen as never before, and the drones of the fighters were hardly seen before, but they are also rare.\n\nBut the Sidekick drones have become absolutely OP by this buffoon. With a shot they now make about 40 damage points, the things are small and have the 200 HP. With 4 standard machine guns as you can easily earn them with the machine guns mission you have to let them overheat until a sidekick drone is destroyed, you have to note here that nciht every shot sits. Of course you write \"Then go over it!\" Which is very easy because they are neither big nor slow, you are also rammed by many players in close combat, often by your own team, or even lying on an opponent because he has hurled you with his frontal ramp. Have fun with your unguided missiles and shoot your guns at the small drones, you have no longer ammunition.\n\nEvery 5th player from 6k PS has at least 2 sidekicks, and in the low-animal range, so under 3k PS, you can see sidekicks from time to time, and there you will be shot very quickly because of your few HP. Leviathane with more than 6 sidekick drones are extremely hard to beat, besides, they all concentrate not on the small dung like the small AI vehicles or even the drones, but on the Leviathan which is heavily armed with other weapons. I also saw Leviathane, not only in the gallery, which only drove sidekick drones, each player died immediately. Fairness looks different.\n\nIt would be quite enough to either cut the HP of the Sidekick drone to 100 HP or cut the damage back to the previous value. But if this is not the case, you can add a weapon to the game that does not damage your opponent's vehicles, damage them completely, or damage them if they are not directly bombed, a pulse weapon with a 4x range Flamers would fit well here.\n\nThe drones do not need any skills, they are simply completely unbalanced and in the crossout forum to the relevant patch (0.7.40), everything is still highly praised, the drones the buffs urgently needed, etc ... and there I wonder if this Spinner will play the game for more than 10 minutes, instead of buying $ 100 to get up from PS 3000 to PS 7000 within 5 minutes and have fun because they do not know how a video game actually works, to play, not to buy through ,\n\nWhat I would like to edit here, if I am already in the topic forum and crossout:\n\nI read in the mentioned part of the crossout forum only what of, in the PS 3000-4000 stage the drones were completely sh-it and therefore the Buff welcome. I sit with my vehicle in PS 6800 and yesterday I had played 3 PvP battles and 1 invasion. In the 3 PvP battles I was ONLY destroyed by drones swarms and in the invasion of the last Leviathan also by Sidekicks, it was 6 pieces. In the forum I often read that they nciht concentrate on the drones but on the actual driver and shoot him. This is, of course, very easy when your opponent moves away from your nose and / or your weapons are shot down, and you can not be fast because you need armor because otherwise you are killed immediately. This is not fun, this is pure Farming and I can also play Cookie Clickers and similar nonsense, because I can also run Farming. If I want to have horny stats to increase my Internet pen-is to indicate with the children.\n\nIt is never in the life sense of a game in the game work to operate in order to get your reward, since I can immediately look for ne reasonable work to make money there, me ne woman look and nen oh so great life to shape only around With 80 to lay, horny, so I imagine the life before.\n\nYou'll build a fast vehicle with 4 sidekicks, go quickly, release the drones, pis-s you back into the next corner, and wait. You just do the same again when you have recharged. Or you go around the circle all the time around your opponent, maybe have a little gun like a circular saw or something to fu-ck your opponent even further in the as-s For you it becomes even easier if, and this is now the rule, in your team still someone is the exactly the same tactics used. The gallery does not make it any better, you download a good Blaupause, use it and off you go. Or if parts are missing, you just replace them with others, your cart does not have to look good to be effective.\n\nBut as you already know from Gaijin, the community goes past their as-s and they are only interested in the money, so this situation, if at all, will change in two years, similar to Wargaming. I would like to dodge other games that are similar to gameplay and game mechanics, but Robocraft, 3 years ago a super game, was broken and other alternatives are not known to me, and Crossout has a big game.\n\nThank you, thank you for nothing\n\nThis text was translated by the google Translator.\n\nI am german and my english its not the yellow from the egg BA DUM TS"
