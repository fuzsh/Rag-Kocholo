        "text": "Back in the day, Mario and Sonic would be the first things to pop into your head when you think about iconic video game characters. It’s only in the last few console generations that we’ve got to the point where actors can bring human characters fully to life. Nowadays, when you think about your favorite characters, it’s not a hedgehog or a misshapen plumber that appears in the mind’s eye – it’s a human face, probably looking sad. It’s probably a dad, too. We get loads of dads.\n\nA good game character these days isn’t a stylish collection of pixels or something that can be turned into a Pop Toy. It’s a personality, a performance, and your connection to both as you move through the story. You remember the voice lines and their faces as they said them. And because video games dictate that we spend dozens of hours walking in their shoes (or alongside their clown shoes – this will make sense later), we get to know them on a deeper level than characters in a movie."
