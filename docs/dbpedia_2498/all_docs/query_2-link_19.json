This book offers a new reading of the principles by which the Morte Darthur is structured, looking at the ways in which Malory deploys the Arthurian tradition and received narratives as both redactor and translator. The sources are considered in particular detail, and the additions and deletions which Malory makes to them: central to the investigation is the ways in which the fifteenth-century work on the one hand conserves thirteenth-century narratives such as Le Mort le Roi Artu, yet on the other reconstitutes it as something new, an approach which differs from the current critical trend of considering the Morte mainly in relation to its contemporary milieu. In so doing, the author develops a theory of \"symbolic structure\" to account for the principles of generation and combination of narrative elements in Malory, looking at the ways in which entire narratives can be put into motion by the power of a symbol such as Balin's sword, or the grail itself.\n\nDr ELIZABETH EDWARDS teaches at the University of King's College, Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nElizabeth Edwards is a Professor at the University of King's College, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\n\"Of great interest to those concerned with...the question of the role of symbolism in Arthurian narrative.\" SPECULUM\n\nHardcover\n\n9780859915960\n\n$110.00 / £80.00\n\nShipping Options\n\nBuy Ships within 2 business days\n\nBuy\n\nPurchasing options are not available in this country.\n\nTitle Details\n\n211 Pages\n\n2.34 x 1.56 cm\n\nSeries: Arthurian Studies\n\nSeries Vol. Number: 43\n\nImprint: D.S.Brewer\n\nRelated Titles\n\nMore by Author\n\nMore in Series\n\nMedieval Manuscripts, Readers and Texts\n\nEdited by Misty Schieberle\n\nWith Amanda Bohne\n\nMedievalisms in a Global Age\n\nEdited by Angela Jane Weisl and Robert Squillace\n\nMedieval Welsh Literature and its European Contexts\n\nEdited by Victoria Flood\n\nMedieval Manuscripts and their Provenance\n\nEdited by A.
