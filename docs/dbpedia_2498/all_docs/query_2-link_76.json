        "text": "Ruth Lexton\n\nBates College\n\nIn Malory’s Morte Darthur (c.1470) Lancelot’s success in “turnementes, justys, and dedys of armys” appears to reinforce his status as the best knight, the one with most “worship.” Critics have begun to realize, however, that Malorian “worship” is a conceptual term distinct from the chivalric honor typical of Malory’s French romance sources in which the individual knight proves his reputation through chivalric action. I demonstrate that in using “worship,” Malory deployed a term from the everyday lexicon of the fifteenth-century English gentry in order to interrogate the chivalric ideology of romance. The letter collections of three fifteenth-century gentry families, the Pastons, Armburghs, and Stonors, reveal that the meaning of worship for members of the gentry was not primarily chivalric, but involved the performance of status which had practical and political impact in gentry society. For members of the gentry, outward appearances and public actions rather than inner virtue and honor were paramount. In this paper, I suggest that breaking down the generic boundaries between Malorian romance and the gentry letters enables a reconsideration of the meaning of worship in the Morte Darthur, particularly the worship of the best knight, Lancelot. Rather than a sense of personal chivalric honor which encourages the individual knight to quest and do battle, Malorian worship emerges as a public and collective political concept. Against the experiences of the fifteenth-century English gentry, Lancelot’s repetitive performance of chivalric deeds should be seen not as a sign of his own prowess, but a means of reinforcing and reuniting a Round Table which is in continual danger of fragmenting. The equilibrium Lancelot creates with his worship, however, can only be temporary: always in the public view and exposed to constant assessment, Lancelot’s worship is revealed as a political instability which ultimately undermines the Arthurian polity."
