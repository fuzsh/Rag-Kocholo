        "text": "I see this thread had been done before in the previous decade which is now locked, so I thought I'd make a new one. A lot has happened since then.\n\nSo who are your favourite video game characters? The focus is more on the playable characters, but feel free to mention any supporting characters too.\n\nHere's my top 10 playable characters:\n\n1. Nathan Drake (Uncharted series)\n\n2. Ciri (The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt)\n\n3. Chloe Frazer (Uncharted: The Lost Legacy)\n\n4. Edward Kenway (Assassin's Creed: Black Flag)\n\n5. Lara Croft (Tomb Raider series)\n\n6. Batman (Arkham series/Batman Telltale series)\n\n7. Star-Lord (Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series)\n\n8. Aloy (Horizon Zero Dawn)\n\n9. Geralt (The Witcher series)\n\n10. Joel (The Last of Us)\n\nHonourable mentions:\n\nBayek (Assassin's Creed: Origins), Claptrap (Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel), Crash Bandicoot (Crash Bandicoot series), Deadpool (Deadpool), Ellie (The Last of Us), Evie Frye (Assassin's Creed: Syndicate), Franklin Clinton (Grand Theft Auto V), Galen Marek/Starkiller (The Force Unleashed series), Iden Versio (Star Wars Battlefront II), John Marston (Red Dead Redemption), Max Caulfield (Life is Strange), Michael De Santa (Grand Theft Auto V), Mira Forrester (Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series), Rodrik Forrester (Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series) and Trevor Phillips (Grand Theft Auto V). There's heaps of other great ones, but I didn't want to list too many.\n\nThere's still plenty of games that I need to play, so I'm sure more great characters will come up and possibly enter my top 10.\n\n1) Star Killer - Force Unleashes 1/2 - Love this dude, to OP for appearances in films/series but was interesting none the less..\n\n2) Emile - Halo Reach - coolest armor in Halo, was badass and had one of the best death scenes.\n\n3) Kasumi - Mass Effect 2/3 - She is a great little addon character, so much decent story behind her.\n\nWell, Link is an empty vessel for the player to inhabit. He doesn't display much personality beyond what you project onto him. He never has any dialogue, and his backstory is never elaborated on much for you to get a sense of how he is when he is not in your control. And this is all on purpose. It has very rarely, if ever, been a priority for the Zelda games to portray a living Link that exists as a character independent of the player. The intention is always for Link to be an embodiment of you.\n\n^I wouldn't say Link's a completely empty vessel; he does have reactions and some personality to him, even if it's minimal. BotW even added some reason as to why he's a character who's always silent and stoic.\n\nI also like Shiek. Wish they'd make another version of \"him\" in another game (not counting Hyrule Warriors).\n\nI’ll do my top 10 supporting characters. These characters were extremely memorable and added a lot more to the game than most NPCs. In fact, these characters are better than a lot of playable characters.\n\n1. Victor Sullivan (Uncharted series)\n\n2. Charlie Cutter (Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception)\n\n3. Chloe Frazer (Uncharted series)\n\n4. Triss Merigold (The Witcher series)\n\n5. Drax the Destroyer (Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series)\n\n6. Nadine Ross (Uncharted series)\n\n7. Deathstroke (Arkham series)\n\n8. Yennefer (The Witcher series)\n\n9. Samuel Drake (Uncharted series)\n\n10. Groot (Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series)"
