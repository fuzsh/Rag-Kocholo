They stand together near the river outside of a house with a blue roof. Despite being the Comedian's Sidekick, he does not seem to enjoy his jokes very much.[2] This is remedied when Link gives the comedian the Cheesy Mustache and he now feels they can make a better comedy routine.[3] In a Linked Game, the Sidekick will relocate to the outside of the shop later in the game, where he remarks about the gloomy state of the city.[4]\n\nNomenclature[]\n\nNames in Other Regions Language Name Meaning Japanese 相方 (Aikata)[5] Partner\n\nGallery[]\n\nArtwork of the Sidekick with the Comedian\n\nSee Also[]\n\nComedian"
