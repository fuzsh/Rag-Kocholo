Wario is just fun to play as, and he has personality.\n\nDr. Robotnik\n\nOnce again, villains. Also because he goes on our forums.\n\nAsha (Monster World IV)\n\nA case of a perfectly good video game getting thrown under the bus. Asha was the female heroine before a lot of female heroines ever entered into gaming. She also isn't over-sexualized. If anything, she's just as strong as the average guy character, and I kind of like playing as her because of that.\n\nViewtiful Joe\n\nCool design, great game, etc. I have a thing for Japanese superheroes.\n\nThere are probably more that I'm not thinking of.\n\nQuote\n\n1. This king I had when I was playing as England on Medieval 2: Total War, seriously, most if not all armies he led succeeded in battle heroicly, the guy was practically a unkilliable beast,\n\n2.

Not only is she hot (and doesn't matter, because 90% of the time she's in the suit) but she's pretty strong.\n\nSomeone already mentioned Snake, so I'll go with The Boss . She is responsible for one of the saddest endings I've seen.\n\nMr. Red from Total Distortion. I just love the way he speaks and the lack of interest in your situation.\n\nAnd I'll go with Kirby too.
