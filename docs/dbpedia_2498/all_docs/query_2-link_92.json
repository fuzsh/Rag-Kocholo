        "text": "Jochem Rotteveel uses the unconventional materials of tape and foil to create his paintings. He focuses primarily on the unstable borders between disciplines, materials and dimensions. In this way he explores the boundaries between 2D and 3D, low art and high art. In his own words, Jochem appropriates the work method and the view of painters. Although the plastic cannot be mixed like paint, by pasting related shades next to each other or by adding transparent layers, painterly solutions are created."
