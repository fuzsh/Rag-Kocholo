        "text": "While browsing SideQuest, you may have come across the term ‘SideKick’ or ‘verified reviewer’ once or twice and wondered what on Earth those are.\n\nThe SideKicks—part of our SideKick Program—are talented content creators helping us grow our community and succeed in our mission to make SideQuest a valuable destination for both VR gamers and developers alike.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know.\n\nWho are the SideKicks?\n\nOur SideKicks (also known as ‘Verified Reviewers’) are independent content creators specializing in all things XR. We’ve teamed up with them to help our community find more reliable app reviews on our site—and help developers get the recognition they deserve for their hard work.\n\nPrimarily working across video-sharing social platforms like YouTube and TikTok, SideKicks channel their enthusiasm for XR technology into creating content that informs and entertains their followers—providing trusted reviews that we want to share while spreading the word about advancements in the space.\n\nSo, while SideKicks don’t work for SideQuest, they’re our partners in building a more connected and informed community in XR.\n\nWhat do they do at SideQuest?\n\nThe SideKick program is a mutually beneficial exchange: Sidekicks help us by creating reliable reviews for the apps and games found on SideQuest, and we help them by posting their reviews on our platform, getting them access to newly released games to review, and supplying them with exclusive SideQuest merch for their efforts. Ultimately, we help amplify their trusted voices in the VR space.\n\nWhen SideKicks leave a review on SideQuest, their reviews are listed on our homepage and pinned to the top of the review stack on each app listing, highlighted blue (if they have reviewed that app). You can also click on their verified reviewer tick or their SideQuest username to see more of their content. We trust SideKicks to provide reviews that are objective, reliable, and engaging to help our gamers make a decision to download the app.\n\nMeanwhile, SideKicks help developers by providing deep feedback while highlighting those apps across social media—meaning more people downloading and experiencing them.\n\nHow can I become a SideKick?\n\nOur SideKick program is pretty exclusive—and becoming a SideKick is by invitation only.\n\nThat said, if you’re a VR content creator looking to join the SideKick program, there are a few things you can do to catch our attention:\n\nBe a VR-focused YouTube channel\n\nPlay a good variety of games and dig into the Indie genre—not just official store content\n\nEnsure your reviews are valuable to the viewer, providing your honest opinions, backed up by footage supporting your points\n\nCreate high-quality content that displays your skill in editing, script writing, voiceover, etc.\n\nDon’t share adult content and don’t include profanity\n\nBe active in our community—if you’re already posting detailed reviews on SideQuest, you’ll be on our radar\n\nOur current SideKicks\n\nWe’re adding new SideKicks to our program all the time—and all of them are busy creating quality VR-related content! You can check out the channels belonging to all of our current SideKicks right here:"
