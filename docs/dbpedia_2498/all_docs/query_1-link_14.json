Seriously, he is usually the last guy in a system's life.\n\nThis game was probably the last major game in the SNES.\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Lord Spencer Fri Oct 21, 2011 4:28 pm\n\nIt is always fun inhaling stuff with pink puff guy\n\nGame: Kirby’s Dream Land 3.\n\nYear: 1997.\n\nGenre: Platformer.\n\nPublisher: Nintendo.\n\nDeveloper: Hal Laboratory.\n\nYes, the year of release is not a mistake. Sure this game was released after the industry earthquakes FFVII and Mario 64. Sure this game was released after the SNES became obsolete. Sure Kirby looked like the guy who crashed the party 5 hours after it ended.\n\nDoes that mean the game is not worth dusting the old SNES for one last hoorah. Apparently it was, as this game sold badly. In fact, its sales made Nintendo apprehensive about the franchise and Kirby had to do all kinds of stuff to convince the Big-N of his marketable appeal.\n\nI can say that those who decided not to dust off the old SNES probably made the wrong decision, as this is easily better than any 2-D platoformer on the PS1 and 64 at the time. Even though most were ogling in 3-D territory by now.\n\nAnyway, here is the review:\n\nThe Fun Factor:\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Kirby platformers, they are very different than your run of the mill platformer. They involve multi-layered levels with little “platforming” elements like death traps and precision jumps. You also have rather long healthbar, and an infinite jump. Its all about moving the little guy, inhaling stuff and blowing them at other stuff. Sometimes you swallow stuff and copy their powers, which is the gist of the gameplay.\n\nIt is a really fun gameplay mechanic, which makes playing the level each and every time a different experience depending on how you win it. There are 8 abilities that you can copy and use.\n\n“Wait just a minute?” Kirby fans used to dozens of abilities will say, only 8. Well, in this installment you get a variety of different sidekicks that you can ride, and combining each ability with one of your six companions give a different result. to a total of 64 different abilities, 65 if you count your neutral state. The difference in style each companion gives is overwhelming. Some are more fun than others, but all of them are preference based, since each gives a different experience.\n\nThis makes the necessary repetition completing the game will demand an okay task. On that note, the game demands that you get a heart-star from each stage. But there is a catch, you don’t collect the heart-star by finishing the stage, but each stage offers a clue on something you should do to get the star. This will demand you play the level sometimes more than once, on average three times to figure out what you need to do and how to do it. It might feel cumbersome at times. especially in some long stages, but the variety in doing the task will make it less so.\n\nFinally, to the final mechanic in the game. That of Gooey, a purple slime who you summon to help you. This slime thing is supposed to be used in CO-OP with a friend, and it is the only situation I imagine the thing to be of any use or fun at all. Because the computer just annoys you when it uses it, which is why I rarely summoned the gluttonous slime.\n\nIt is really difficult to give a score to the amount of fun a good Kirby game gives. Its a unique brand of surreal gameplay and specific fun. If you enjoy Kirby games, you will absolutely love this one. If you don’t enjoy Kirby games, then there is something wrong with you and you need to go see a psychiatrist. Kirby blows, spits, and sometimes even swallows, and he is going to kick your butt.\n\nScore: 10\n\nChallenge:\n\nKirby games are notoriously easy, they are like a playground where you can do lots of stuff and there is nothing menacing trying to stop you. You can make it hard for yourself by attempting self-challenges, but the game itself offers little difficulty.\n\nHowever, the difficulty scales slightly as you progress and then it spikes considerably in the final world. But it never becomes outright difficult, and you will be mostly relaxed playing the game. Even the final boss is nothing to be afraid off, as two lives in you will most probably have figured him out.\n\nHal Lab knew this, so they opted with another type of challenge. Continuing the social gaming culture of Nintendo, Hal demanded from the player a star from each level, and the conditions for getting those stars are never explicitly said. They gave clues and asked the player to figure them out. Most are pretty easy, but there are a couple that will demand replay upon replay.\n\nIts not unfair, but is slightly cheap from Hal. But, considering 1997, the social component with lack of internet was strong. Now you have the internet, so you will never play alone.\n\nScore: 5\n\nStyle:\n\nThis is a Kirby game, and you will know it. In an era were technical graphics were the fad, Hal gave an absolutely charming look to Dream Land. It looked like a children’s book drawn and colored by crayons, as the environment melded into itself, and yet remained sharp.\n\nThe music in the game was simply epic, Kirby is a hero that takes himself seriously, and he demands he goes through his adventure to the epic tunes. Kirby will not be disappointed, because this game carried on the tradition of mixing the epic with the surreal, creating an absolute fun experience.\n\nNot to mentione the boss battles, which are intense, fun, and Kirby-like to the extreme. Anyone familiar with Kirby will recognize the badd guys immediately, but even Kirby veterans will be surprised by the change in these boss battles, pleasantly so.\n\nHowever, what truly makes this game a stylistic master piece is the animation, from the cut scenes to the little things. First, the cutscenes are hilarious. Second, Kirby’s movement and animation is superb.\n\nFinally, the little things are amazing. From the enthusiastic animation of the friends as you approach them, to the shock when you ride on and not the other. They look either happy or disappointed. Kirby is then rolled into a ball, rides a bird, or is carried around by an owl. These little animations from the friends and foes make this whole adventure a charming and fun ride.\n\nWe all know who is Kirby’s favorite companion, since his face looks like he is having an orgasm while she is riding his head.\n\nThis is a game that has pink badass charm all over it, and if you are not into pink badass charm, then you need your head checked. Or better still, your balls.\n\nScore: 9\n\nPlayability:\n\nA pick up and play game. The controls are solid, and the gameplay is intuitive. Every level saves, and you can go back every now and then and sink right into it. Music is superb, and motion is pin-point. The game does not require much dedication, nor does it punish you for ignoring it for a long time.\n\nHowever, if you are not into the formula then you won’t enjoy it.\n\nAgain, if you are not into the formula then there are a multitude of ways on which you can go f*ck your self, because Kirby rules.\n\nScore: 9\n\nLord Spencer’s Score:\n\nI obviously enjoyed this game. WIll I give it a high score in my criteria.\n\nNo. because of the obvious fact this game was released two years late. When you are busy playing Mario 64, you are not expected to dust off the SNES and play it, and for this lousy gesture from Hal to their fans, this game gets a low score from me.\n\nSince it is a 1997 game, I will compare it to 1997 games, and by then we had Mario 64 and this game was only 10 dollars cheaper. Compared to that legendary game, this admittedly fun game takes a back seat. I usually inflate for time/era but my hands are tied when the game is released after Mario 64.\n\nScore: 1\n\nOverall: 10/5/9/9/2 35/50\n\nKirby always gets smack for being a late party crasher. And he will most probably get some in his latest return to dream land. You need to learn some punctuality bro, try swallowing a clock.\n\nTips on the game:\n\nSpoiler:\n\nHere is a list of the Companions and my view on them:\n\n1- Kine: the fish\n\nObviously is going to be the best in water, and he is. Kine gets some really destructive combinations, and is a beast underwater. In fact, while Kirby is with kine, he can inhale underwater and swim against currents. Too bad he is mostly useless outside of the water and is a serious liability in dangerous platforming sequences.\n\nMost of his abilities are good, but a couple are limiting.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- Can swim against current.\n\n- Spark ability uncovers hidden doors and marks in dark rooms.\n\nParasol ability makes him glide.\n\n2- Nago: the cat thing\n\nThis guy is my favorite. He can triple jump, stomp on enemies, and he offers plenty of defensive cover. Not to mention that he roles you into a ball. All his abilities are useful or great. He is fun to use, and he packs a unique punch.\n\nAll of his abilities are good, and he has a couple Tier one moves.\n\nConclusion:\n\n-Plenty of power.\n\n-Triple Jump.\n\n-His Needle animation is hilarious.\n\n3- ChuChu: the pink blob thing.\n\nKirby’s favorite companion. She sticks up walls, and has an assortment of great combinations. Although some are not good, she can be inflated into a hot air ballon by Flame. Get her in a broom and you will fly all over the stage.\n\nThree abilities stand out, two are limiting, and the rest are not bad.\n\nConclusion:\n\n-Kirby enjoys having her on his head.\n\n-She can fly with a broom or by using flame.\n\n-She sticks to walls.\n\n4-Coo: the owl.\n\nFlying is fun, and Coo is all about flying. His abilities make use of that by either making him a sky fighter or a bomber. The only companion whose flying skills rival Kirby’s own, and the only on who can boast an equal ability of helping Kirby as cleaning the house.\n\nHis abilities are good when he is flying. None are really special though.\n\nConclusion:\n\n-Fly against current.\n\n-Fly.\n\n5-Pitch: the green little bird\n\nThe grandfather of angry birds. You can toss him in a flaming ball, like a boomerang, control him and electrocute your enemies, strike him like a golf ball, throw him like a handegg, use him to throw stuff, or just poke holes into your enemies with his beak.\n\nAll of his abilities are good and fun to use.\n\nConclusion:\n\n-Offers flight but not as good as coo.\n\n-Remote controlled electric bird FTW.\n\n6-Rick: the hamster\n\nMy least favorite companion. Rick does not get many good abilities, and his non sliding on ice ability sucks. The wall jump ability is limited. And he does not have a Tier 1 ability at all. His only saving grace is that he can turn into a border, and Kirby than move on top of him to roll the border; hence commencing a Rick Roll.\n\nAbilities are meh, with only two being slightly useful.\n\nConclusion:\n\n-Does not slide on ice.\n\n-Can wall jump.\n\n-Rick Roll into the abyss.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I am super hyped to play Kirby’s newest adventure.\n\nThe next game in my countdown will be IGN’s #60 Aladdin, based on the Disney cartoon.\n\nStay Tuned\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Lord Spencer Mon Oct 24, 2011 2:49 pm\n\nGame: Aladdin.\n\nYear: 1993.\n\nGenre: Platformer.\n\nPublisher: Capcom.\n\nDeveloper: Capcom.\n\nAnother game I never finished in my childhood. Playing this now brought back a lot of beautiful memories of bygone days. Nevertheless, I will not let emotions cloud my judgment on the game.\n\nI think this game is in direct competition with another game I reviewed, the Lion King. Since both are Disney inspired, and both being platformers. There is a one year difference between the two, which accounts for somethings, but gameplay is ageless and it is where most of my review focuses on.\n\nHere goes:\n\nThe Fun Factor:\n\nWith a level design that values pin point precession in landing, you would imagine a lot of trial and error needs to be invested. However, with the introduction of a slow landing mechanic and a level design that is made for speed gaming, the pin point jumps become intuitive.\n\nThere are enemies in the level, and the way to defeat them is uniformly jumping on them to trigger the hand spring mechanic. The game revolves around that innovative mechanic; when you jump on a pole or a bad guy, Aladdin lands with his hands and propels himself upwards. Which makes for a lot of neat moments.\n\nThroughout the stage, there are gems you collect to increase your life bar. Some of those gems are red, and they require more skill to get than the regular green gems. Skills involving chain jumping and clever use of the slow landing mechanic. And it is in the clever use of these mechanics that the game becomes fun.\n\nIn fact, the gameplay does not shine unless you rush through the game. Slowly winning every level is repetitive and not satisfying, but rushing through the stages is adventurous and thrilling. You feel like Aladdin did during his first chase in the movie.\n\nScore: 7\n\nChallenge:\n\nThis not a challenging game. And while it is not easy, finishing the game should be a breeze for gaming people. Since the level design is intuitive and built for rush playing, and since life lamps re-spawn after you die, you will rarely find yourself short of lives.\n\nThis coupled with easy bosses, and the only challenge in regular gameplay is the rug escape level, which is a matter of memorizing the pattern. In fact, I defeated the final boss in my first attempt, and my health was not even full.\n\nIf you want to add some zest to your game, go for the red gems which require some creative thinking to get. Other than that the game is fairly simple and straightforward.\n\nScore: 3\n\nStyle:\n\nThe sprite representing Aladdin is horribly rendered. Other than that, the other characters are well drawn and move in a funny an reasonable way. The background drawings are clear and representative.\n\nI was a little disappointed with the soundtrack which is not as powerful as the one used in the Lion King. Which is understandable since the music in the movie was not as powerful as the Lion King. Regardless, Capcom did a good job with the boss music which is really good.\n\nWhere the game style shines is the level design, which was obviously designed with the intent of using all of Aladdin’s street rat skills to traverse the level. This allowes for really cool gaming moments where you effortlessly jump from pole to pole to enemy to pole to ledge. I spent half a level in the air due to the intelligent level design.\n\nScore: 8\n\nPlayability:\n\nThe game can easily be picked up, and it supports a password system for the busy ants around. The graphics are solid, and the music is not annoying.\n\nThis a gamer friendly game that would not punish your keyboard controls. And the sentimental value is a plus\n\nScore: 6\n\nLord Spencer’s Score:\n\nIs this another money grabbing scheme from Disney. The answer is yes. Although to a lesser degree than the Lion King. However, since Capcom was responsible for the game, I expected a more solid experiance. This being #60 in IGN’s countdown is unfathomable for me. I regret giving the Lion King 7 in my criteria but I will correct the mistake with Aladdin.\n\nScore: 5\n\nOverall: 7/3/8/6/5 27/50\n\nA game plummets to below the 30’s for the first time since 6 games ago. Which symbolizes that my reviews will get tougher, and that games need to rely in more than sentimental value. I am looking for a solid gaming experience, and would punish any game that does not give me one.\n\nTips on the game:\n\nSpoiler:\n\nToo easy.\n\nThe next game that interests me on the list is DKC3 which I already finished 3 times before. It is the third best in the DKC series, and would imagine a 35 score being what it gets.\n\nSo I would skip to the quirky mad game Earthworm Jim, which is #57 in IGN’s list. Hope I don’t regret going into the unknown madness of the worm\n\nShould be crazy.\n\nStay Tuned\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Lord Awesome Tue Oct 25, 2011 5:14 am\n\nPlayed this one recently.\n\nThe time when when Capcom was all over the Disney games. Damn, what an era.\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Lord Spencer Fri Oct 28, 2011 3:12 am\n\nThis game is insane.\n\nGame: Earthworm Jim.\n\nYear: 1994.\n\nGenre: Platformer.\n\nPublisher: Playmates.\n\nDeveloper: Shiny Entertainment.\n\nThe most surreal and crazy experience you might get in any game, ever, and that is an extreme ever. Jim is a regular Earthworm who was being chased by a hungry crow, and then bam an alien space suit lands on top of him, and the suit being some special technology merged with Jim and created Earthworm Jim, the super bad-ass worm warrior. Actually, I am not sure about bad-ass, but Jim is sure super.\n\nAs you see from the setting, this will not be your normal platformer, nor your normal game. You will control Jim as he escapes from galaxy to galaxy from a number of baddies looking to get his suit. All the while racing the menacing mercenary psy-crow, and saving Earth.\n\nIt is one unforgettable experience, but does it offer more than the novelty; read on to find out:\n\nThe Fun Factor:\n\nThis game is odd, from the movement animation off Jim to that of the enemies. But that all oddness does not affect the gameplay. Basically, you need to make your way through each stage to the end. Where mostly a boss awaits. In between stages, there is a Sonic-like race sequence with Psy-Crow, which keeps things varied.\n\nHowever, that is easier said than done. The stages are riveted with obstacles, from spikes, to crazy dogs and unbeatable opponents. And some enemies are literally a pain in the ass, quite literally so. Jim has the ability to shoot his plasma gun, or use his wormish body as a whip. With such awesome power you would think defeating your enemies is easy, but that is not so. Since the enemies that matter are unbeatable that way. Of course, enemies are not the only pain, as you traverse an alien planet after planet, the geography requires you to jump, scale walls, slide shafts, hang on wires, use your whip to grab ledges and pegs, and other crazy stuff.\n\nThe bosses are all very unique and personal, with each making fighting him an experience. Although non of them are specifically groundbreaking, all are tough and a challenge to go through.\n\nOn the stages themselves, they are all very different from each other in both design and gameplay. One stage requires you to use a water pod to traverse from one point to another, another is themed after Hell and is called Heck, with demons and lawyers being your enemies (you read that right, lawyers). Another stage gives you an alien puppy to control. It is a wacky adventure, and one that never gets boring.\n\nUntil, you get frustrated at the sheer clumsiness of the game. The fifth time a dog bites you on the ass because the command for evade is broken is going to let a scream out of you. The sixth time you fail the pod escape (and I am being generous here) you will consider canceling the whole thing. The game is really fun, and could have gotten a perfect 10, but the amount of moments that are not challenging or fun at all really drags this game dow. Chaos helped this game a lot, but it also dragged it down a bit.\n\nScore: 6\n\nChallenge:\n\nChallenge only counts when its fair, and most of the game this title is fair. However, some really cheap moments in the game ruin the credibility of this game’s challenge.\n\nFirst, lets start with the fair. The overall skill it takes to finish the stages is high, and the bosses are defeat-able after a struggle by still can be defeated. It takes great skill to aim the whip, and traveling in the hostile alien planets make for a lot of rapid movement and jumping.\n\nThen we jump to the unfair. Clumsy sums up this part. The game design is downright stupid at times. After the hardest and clumsiest sequence in the game, you get greeted with hardest and cheapest boss in the game. Which make is very annoying when your lives disappear and you have to go through the difficult sequence again. And the movement, while stylish, is not practical in a platformer. Too many jumps fail because of Jim’s awkward movement. Not to mention using the whip to attach to hooks (to swing from) which is downright impossible to do without plenty of misses here and there.\n\nAll these are inherently design errors, and they require luck, not skill, to be overcome. Which makes this game harder than it should be, even by using the emulator’s save function.\n\nScore: 4 (deducted 5 points for unfairness)\n\nStyle:\n\nI can say one sentance and it would give a very good justification for me to give the game a 10 but I will ramble on. This game is odd, freaky, strange, crazy, insane, and downright mad. From the crazy graphics and oddball animation, to the weird music and crazy names. Let me dissect my claim:\n\nFirst, every level has a unique graphical style that brings it to life. But every game worth its graphical salt has that. Where Earth worm Jim shines is in the sprite graphics, which were made to be in proportional, crazy, and to look like the figment of some pot head’s imagination. Jim is crazy worm with two eye colors, and his enemies look weirder. Yet, everything falls in place in some crazy random way. Which is really cool.\n\nSecond, the animation the main character and the enemies do is simply amazing. Jim walks like a boss, shoots his head like a boss, and play jump the rope with his head like , a boss. Yes, you read that right, jumps the rope with his head like a boss, and you know it. However, the leopard monster who also walks around like a boss doesn’t know it, and when he grabs you by tho throat, and then throws to the other end of the room, he does it like a boss. Oh well, you can always jump to the bubble above him and hold your but up like a boss. Or you can shoot him with power beam and watch him evaporate like a boss, yes that is more like it.\n\nThird, the music is like nothing you heard before. It is crazy soundtrack that was probably written under the influence of......something. Crazy track will keep you listening to the same tune without realizing it.\n\nFinally, it is names like Heck, Monkey-for-a-Head that makes the quirky sense of humor of this game shines. Seriously, the scientist who created Jim’s suit is name Monkey-for-a-head. But that is nothing compared to the level name Snot a problem, where you appropriately have a bungee jump contest to the bitter end with non other than the aptly named Major Mucus. I am not making this up, this is really in the game.\n\nWhat is the sentence that could have justified my rating? Oh well, her it is: the name of the evil queen who serves as the main antagonist in the game is “Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt” and she lives in Buttsville. Seriously, that is her name. Am I right, I sure am.\n\nScore: 10\n\nPlayability:\n\nThis game’s clumsiness would make most people shun the game. But the game itself outside of poor design is playable.\n\nToo bad that poor design will probably cut short most people’s experience with the game in level 4 due to the extreme difficulty of the pod race.\n\nScore: 4\n\nLord Spencer’s Score:\n\nThis is a very unique and stylish game, a shame it had to suffer from basic errors. The designer should have realized when difficulty becomes unfair. As such this game did not get the recognition it deserved outside of cult followings.\n\nI hope this review will encourage some of you to at least check it out, because playing as Jim even if for a short while is a fun and worthy experience. An experience only smudged by level 4.\n\nScore: 8\n\nOverall: 6/4/10/4/8 32/50\n\nI certainly don’t regret playing this game, even if I wasted a lot of time in level 4. I only managed to finish it because I was lucky that the game timer froze. Too bad that such a gem is so very raw that its shine is so dim.\n\nTips on the game:\n\nSpoiler:\n\nThe Lawyers in the game will sue me if I help you.\n\nAfter a number of platformers, we again come to the land or RPGs. and the game I will be playing is the classic Capcom RPG Breath of Fire II which is #53 in the list. Hope it proves to be fun.\n\nStay Tuned\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Lord Awesome Fri Oct 28, 2011 3:16 am\n\nYes! Closer to Eartbou---I mean, Yay!

It will still be from 50 quality points, but every title will start from 25 and earn/lose points according to criteria important to the titles and genres themselves.\n\nTBreath of Fire recently came to my mind with the news of Breath of Fire 6. Which was released with much chagrin by fans of the series and gaming in general as Capcom went ahead to deface another beloved series into a husk of its former self. However, I realized that BoF was in fact never a strongly followed series. It was both critically and financially lukewarm. In Fact, most Final Fantasy titles sold more individually than the entire BoF series combined.\n\nHence, it is somewhat confusing to see many fans remember the game fondly. In reviewing BoF2, I understood both facts. I understood why the game is remembered fondly by those who played it, and also why it didn't receive much critical or commercial acclaim.\n\n\"Cooperation! I don't think you understand the current situation\"\n\nIt is true that BoF2 story is about an ancient evil being fought by an ancient tribe, it is true that you (the hero) are a destined child that is going to defeat this evil. BoF main story arc breaks no new ground, and I immediately concluded I was going into a typical RPG tale.\n\nYet, the story refused to go with the safest path. While it had the subtlety of a jackhammer, and the language of a preschooler, it managed to be interesting, dramatic, and grand. There are no less sophisticated arguments against organized religion in any medium ever.\n\nThis story is only as well told as it is because of the unique characters telling it. While they are without a doubt a bunch of cardboard cutouts with laughable dialogue, they manage to be endearing by virtue of both their simplicity and design. From the villains, who are wonderfully evil without any cause, to the playable characters whose unique stories round up the game. Each of the playable characters has their own story, which are all satisfying and add a lot to the overall story. The RPG enthusiast will note many of what we consider cliche today, but this is from an age pre-categorization.\n\nThese characters ultimately remain memorable. Those who are weak, but try hard anyway. Those who are wrong, but are loyal to their faults. Those who afraid, but swallow their fear to protect their friends. We can be cynical about these tales, but we would lose a lot of its charms by being so. It is no surprise that many fond memories are of these moments in BoF2.\n\nCharacters: +4\n\nStory: +4\n\n\"There is a bathroom in every house\"\n\nI tested the above fact myself, and found that every house designed to be lived in must at least have one room for its sprites to do their business in. This meticulous design aspect lends itself to a number of other areas in the game. Each town and village is unique, and most of the character sprites are well designed. I say most because of the bland design of the hero himself, who dons a boring white cut shirt.\n\nHowever, all the evil bosses look deliciously evil, while all other sprites in the game convey their personality by their design. The star of the artistic department is surely the white dragon you see in the beginning of the game, whose white scaly skin is dotted with green moss underscoring his ancient stature.\n\nIn the other hand, the rest of the game is not as carefully done. With many of the background assets being reused, especially those of the bland dungeons. We can spot the difference between the carefully crafted sprites, and the wavy NES still-shot in the background.\n\nNonetheless, great care has been given to the area of the game where you spend most of your time; battles. The battle backgrounds are colorful and vibrant, even if they are not impressive. The enemy design and animations are also spot on, with the powerful bosses looking like the menace they are, and the EXP fodder looking as goofy and nonthreatening as they can be.\n\n\"There won't by any orchestration of this soundtrack anytime soon\"\n\nIt can be said that RPGs strongest asset is in their ability to convey emotion, drama, excitement, and adventure with their music. It can also be said that BoF2 music conveys non of those. It is a completely bland and forgettable soundtrack. I can only say that 2 or 3 tracks are noteworthy, including and okay intro theme.\n\nBy the time I finished the game, I realized that them music was singularly uninspiring. From the basic town music, to the boring final battle theme. This is one game where the music was just written to check a box. It follows no style or genre, and it flows randomly with little direction.\n\nNobuo Uematsu of Final Fantasy fame expanded SNES FFs into a third dimension with his music. BoF2 music only glory is that it didn't drag the rest of the game down with it.\n\nDesign: +4\n\n\"Grandma, can the both of us unite with him, he is so handsome\"\n\nWith turn-based battles, the best innovations come in the form of preparing for those battle outside of combat. BoF answer to that challenge is the Shaman system, where player characters are fused with the female shamans (hence the joke) to get some enhancements. The most basic of those enhancements is rudimentary statues boost, but different Shaman-character combinations get different results. With more effective fusion, the character changes color, and with very effective fusions the character completely transforms into a much powerful version.\n\nTaken by itself, this system could be the best customization system in SNES RPGs, with a caveat. Yes, it shall become apparent that many of BoFs systems are accompanied by caveats.\n\nFirst, the last shaman who is responsible for the transformation of at least 3 characters is only introduced before the final dungeon.\n\nSecond, each character loses their fusion if they die or get to a low HP.\n\nThese are frustrating limitations to deal with. Having to go back all the way to your village to fuse again just because you got beat up a little screams of bad game design.\n\n\"There won't by any orchestration of this soundtrack anytime soon\"\n\nIt can be said that RPGs strongest asset is in their ability to convey emotion, drama, excitement, and adventure with their music. It can also be said that BoF2 music conveys non of those. It is a completely bland and forgettable soundtrack. I can only say that 2 or 3 tracks are noteworthy, including and okay intro theme.\n\nBy the time I finished the game, I realized that them music was singularly uninspiring. From the basic town music, to the boring final battle theme. This is one game where the music was just written to check a box. It follows no style or genre, and it flows randomly with little direction.\n\nNobuo Uematsu of Final Fantasy fame expanded SNES FFs into a third dimension with his music. BoF2 music only glory is that it didn't drag the rest of the game down with it.\n\nMusic: -5\n\nShaman System: +2.5\n\n\"Hey Ryu, I am looking for a home, can I live in your village?\"\n\nSpeaking of \"your village\", BoF2 had a citizen recruitment system 3 years before the first Suikoden. At one point in the game, you get control over some village, and you can invite homeless NPCs to your village. These NPCs pay you back by performing a range of services, from the useless job of guarding your town (which is never needed), to selling you the best equipment in the game. Of course, the system comes with its frustrating limitations.\n\nFirst, you can only recruit 6 out of 27 NPCs, and even then, each set of NPCs are randomly assigned to one of six houses which makes recruiting the best ones a pain.\n\nSecond, once you recruit one you can't kick them out of your damn house. You recruited the thieving bastard, well, tough luck.\n\nAgain, BoF2 frustrates us with another confounding limitation. What could have been a fun way to liven up your village by getting mostly useless features is now a village filled with the same useful people in most game saves. BoF2 could have started a village building tradition, but instead gave us a half-baked idea.\n\nYour Village: +2.5\n\n\"101 in Caveman Design\"\n\nIf the above two section did not convince you of the prevalence of Caveman design in the BoF2, then the lack of a dash button will. Everything in BoF2 takes more time to do than it should. From navigating the menus, to walking in the street. It takes forever to reach any place, as the encounter rate is through the roof. The game lacks polish in many of its areas. It lacks polish in its hinting and fishing minigames, the droprate of items from enemies is ridiculously low, and there is no monster book to keep track of them anyways.\n\nThe backwards design of BoF2 is nearly summed in my final moments of the game. I was with my full transformed party in the last levels of the final dungeon, just before the final boss. There, I encountered a story sequence, and when it finished I was surprised that my party lost their transformed form. It had nothing to do with the story sequence. I had to escape the final dungeon with an Exit spell, reassign the transformation, then slog back all the way down. There was a town in the middle of the dungeon, but I couldn't \"wrap\" to it because the Wrap spell wraps you just outside the towns, not the towns themselves.\n\nI had to slog through the obnoxious final dungeon twice just to face the final boss with my preferred party. Elsewhere in the game are more evidence of bad design. Direction are misleading and rarely helpful, so you find your destinations with a guide or by trial and error. In one instance, the game flat out mistranslates your destination and you are left to luck and heaven. I counted 35 translation errors by myself.\n\nUltimately, this is a game plagued by the worst of SNES design. And if I actually played it in the SNES, I would be less favorable towards it. As it istands, playing it with an emulator (Wii U or otherwise) is the sanest thing to do.\n\nCaveman Design: -5 if played in an emulator, -10 in the original version\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nFirst, let me get other things out of the way. The combat is regular tbb, but the varied characters with their unique skills and attributes make it fresh and unique, however those skills are never explained and you are left to your own devices with only a poor text explanation to aid you.\n\nThe many towns and villages are interesting and help underscore the story, it is even easier to go to those towns by their description than by their name, mostly because you don't get the name of anyplace you visit like a normal game should.\n\nAs you can see, BoF2 is clearly a flawed gem. It is a great game encased by a thick shell of backwards design. I now understand the fondness fans had for the game, for its characters and story. I also understand why it never had much success, as it must have tested the patience of many who played it. BoF2 could have been another pillar for Crapcom to then deface years after in its current form as Crapcom, but it never was a pillar. BoF6 might be another loss for gaming, but BoF2 not being as great as it could have been was a bigger loss in itself.\n\nFinal: 35/50\n\n\"BoF 1 vs. BoF 2\"\n\nIt is very surprising how different BoF 1 is from 2. While 2 went in a much better storytelling direction, it took a nosedive mechanically for some reason. Bof 1 is the more accessible game, but it is a much weaker story.\n\n\"Next Game\"\n\nI realized that I would want a more comprehensive look at the top 100 games of IGN. Therefore, I decided to revisit the earlier numbers of the list and review titles I would not normally have reviewed. I will therefore start at #100 Fina Fight and see if it deserves opening the list.\n\nStay Tuned\n\nLast edited by Lord Spencer on Mon Feb 10, 2014 5:12 pm; edited 2 times in total\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Great Leader Sprucenuce Wed Feb 05, 2014 4:20 pm\n\nSpencer\n\nI'm more of an N64 guy than a SNES guy tbh, but have played a lot of them and enjoy reading through your thoughts.\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Guest Wed Feb 05, 2014 5:46 pm\n\nI need to the boss as well Spencer\n\nAlthough my holy grail is NES - I grew up on Mario, although I did own a SNES with my brother.\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Lord Spencer Wed Feb 05, 2014 6:01 pm\n\nGreat Leader Sprucenuce wrote:Spencer\n\nI'm more of an N64 guy than a SNES guy tbh, but have played a lot of them and enjoy reading through your thoughts.\n\nN64 or PS1 are going to be my next 100 list. Although I doubt the N64 can have a decent 100 list with its small library. I know the N64 has a solid top 30, and I am sure it goes up to a solid top 50, but anything beyond that must have aged terribly.\n\nThe SNES actually aged much better than the PS2 and N64 in hindsight.\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Lord Spencer Fri Feb 07, 2014 7:49 am\n\n#100\n\nBig Ol' Mustache\n\nGame: Final Fight.\n\nYear: 1993 (released in the U.S. in 1995).\n\nGenre: Brawler.\n\nPublisher: Capcom.\n\nDeveloper: Capcom.\n\nFirst things first, I am changing my rating system to better rate different genres according to their own rules. It will still be from 50 quality points, but every title will start from 25 and earn/lose points according to criteria important to the titles and genres themselves.\n\nFinal Fight has an old reputation in the brawler genre, it has been a constant presence in arcades and is even represented in Capcom Vs. Marvel by the Burly Mayor Hagger. I am yet to play any other Final Fight game, but from what I saw from this first one is that this lofty reputation is totally undeserved.\n\nStarting from the limitations of the brawler genre, to the limitations of the actual game itself, Final Fight is proving to be one of the few SNES game I disliked in my current attempt to review the top 100.\n\n\"Your daughter for your cooperation\"\n\nEvery brawler needs a reason for the hero(s) to go in a linear path of destruction. In FF, Mike Hagger is the burly mayor of New York, and he is clamping down on crime in the city. The local thugs don't take kindly to that, and they kidnap his daughter to show him their disapproval of his policies. Just like any half decent mayor, Ol' Mario in Steroids removes his shirt and goes brawling in the streets of NY. Also, there is Ken-wannabe Cody who loves Hagger's daughter.\n\nHagger's mustache proves to be the only noteworthy presence in the game. As the thugs being an assortment of generic types, and the bosses being only a light upgrade on their minions. The other playable character, Cody, is as boring as his name. Inexplicably, Cody is actually the better fighter, so whomever picks the superior character in Hagger needs to contend with being disadvantaged by the game.\n\nHagger's Mustache: +4\n\nCody and the Generic Thugs: -3\n\n\"Linear punch-a-face game\"\n\nThis game in theory can be played in the NES with slightly downgraded animations. In the NES, it might be considered a classic, but in the more powerful SNES, its mechanical shortcoming are all too apparent. For instance, the game only uses two buttons, one for attacking and the other for jumping. This leaves no room for guarding, attack switching, or any truly complex move-set.\n\nTrue, there are grab attacks, but they are initiated when the player's sprite contacts the enemy sprites in a haphazard rule. You can grab the enemy, or you might get punched in the face. Regardless, all tactics are then found to be inferior to spamming Drop Kicks most of the time.\n\nWhy do we need to spam Drop Kicks you say? Well, there are a bunch of reasons:\n\nFirst, the enemies do more damage than you.\n\nSecond, the enemies take more damage than you.\n\nThird, Drop Kicks is the only attack where you are sure that its range is more than the enemies.\n\nWhat ensues is a constant barrage of Drop Kicks, these Kicks launch the thugs off-screen. Hence, you need to wait for them to reappear on-screen to Drop Kick them again. Rinse and repeat. In theory, you could finish the game without taking damage at all with consistently well placed Drop Kicks, and the occasional grab-a-boss technique. Of course, this proves to be a most boring practice.\n\nIn hindsight, perhaps the very short length of the game is a blessing. Yes, the more I think about it the more I am convinced that the short five stages the game consists off is a way for the developers to save us from its mundane gameplay.\n\nShort Length: +2\n\nTerrible Brawling: -7\n\n\"Andores, Andores everywhere\"\n\nAndore is one type of thug that takes 15-20 Drop Kicks before dying. They are present in every level of the game bar the first one. It is not an isolated incident, as the same thugs populate all five levels. The levels themselves are only told apart by well made, if boring, backgrounds.\n\nAside from those backgrounds, there is little to differentiate between levels in the game. Bloody Andore will show his ugly face every now and then, as similar sounding music blasts. Of course, Hagger himself or Cody won't ever change, they move with the same animation, the same pose, and attack with the same animations and poses again and again.\n\nOne thing brawlers have in advantage over other genres is their big sprite design, which leave a lot of room for expression in their characters. It is a shame FF doesn't use that large design for anything other than a smirk in one of the bosses face.\n\nMundane Design: -3\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nThis turned out to be a shorter review than I though it would. It is short game, so there is that. However, here are a number of other sorry facts about the game. Item grabbing recognition is wonky at best, deadly at worst. The only way to escape combos from enemies is by executing a special move that also depletes your health. (-2).\n\nI will stop there and go into some moral grounds. The last game I reviewed for the SNES is BoF2, which is another Capcom game. It had its share of problems, but it also had heart. The fact that FF sold more than both BoF1 and 2 is a testament that games don't sell on merit alone. That Capcom is failing hard now might be belated Karma fro all the Final Fight games it sold, as well as several shamefully designed games like it.\n\nOutcome: 18/50\n\nTips:\n\n1- Don't play the game.\n\n2- Press R+L+Start at title screen to customize difficulty.\n\n3- Use Special Move to break oncoming barrels.\n\n4- Make sure to never lose a Katana if you have one.\n\n5- Knifes are useless and could open you up for attack.\n\n6- DROPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICKKKKKKK (Jump and press attack)\n\n\"Next Game\"\n\nOk, so my first game in the retreat was a dud. After FF, there are a bunch of fighting and racing games until #94 The Adventures of Batman and Robin. I am going to play it next, and hope for the best.\n\nStay Tuned\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Lord Spencer Sat Feb 08, 2014 9:36 am\n\nI am halfway through Batman, which means that the game is short.\n\nHowever, this was a much needed cleansing to remove the terrible aftertaste of Final Fight.\n\nRe: The Official SNES Gaming Thread\n\nby Lord Awesome Sat Feb 08, 2014 5:30 pm\n\nSpencer still sticking to the old pastimes of our youth."
