You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nGoogle DeepMind recently introduced SIMA, a groundbreaking AI agent designed to revolutionize the way artificial intelligence interacts within video games. SIMA, an acronym for Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent, is in the developmental stages, focusing on acquiring gaming skills that mimic human play rather than exhibiting the overpowering capabilities typical of conventional AI. This innovative agent is being groomed to navigate through any video game genre, including those without a predefined storyline or those set in expansive open-world environments. SIMA's role is not to supplant the traditional game AI but to complement it, acting as an additional team member that enhances the gaming experience.\n\nSIMA distinguishes itself by integrating natural language processing with the ability to comprehend 3D environments and perform image recognition. \"Our goal with SIMA is not merely to achieve victory in games but to enable it to execute tasks and follow instructions,\" explained Tim Harley, a Google DeepMind researcher and one of the leads on the SIMA project, during a media briefing.\n\nTo refine SIMA's capabilities, Google DeepMind collaborated with eight prominent game developers, such as Hello Games and Coffee Stain, among others. This collaboration involved integrating SIMA into various games, including \"No Man's Sky,\" \"Teardown,\" \"Valheim,\" and \"Goat Simulator 3,\" to acquaint the AI with fundamental gaming mechanics. Remarkably, SIMA's training does not require a specialized API or direct access to the game's source code.\n\nThe selection of games with a focus on open-ended gameplay rather than a linear narrative was deliberate, aiming to equip SIMA with a broad spectrum of gaming skills. The unpredictable and whimsical nature of games like \"Goat Simulator\" was particularly beneficial in teaching SIMA the art of spontaneity in gaming.\n\nThe training process involved creating a new testing environment within the Unity engine, where SIMA was tasked with sculpting to understand object manipulation better. Additionally, Google captured interactions between human players — one controlling the game and the other providing verbal instructions — to teach SIMA how to follow language-based commands and anticipate in-game outcomes."
