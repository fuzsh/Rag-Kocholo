        "meta_description": "In her Harry Potter novels, Rowling brings to life for young readers themes and motifs that permeate the European medieval romance genre, particularly those in Sir Thomas Malory’s late-fifteenth-century Le Morte D’Arthur. This article illustrates how Rowling engages with and updates medieval themes about the significance of blood, focusing primarily on Harry Potter. Harry, an amalgamated Arthurian knight, epitomizes a new, more tolerant order of chivalry not only through his own mixed blood, but also through his virtuous behavior. Ultimately, Rowling shows, intrinsic worth is not dependent upon bloodline; rather, worth is determined by virtue.",
