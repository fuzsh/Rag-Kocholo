        "text": "Players are bound to get attached to avatars/characters in a game just because of the sheer amount of time and effort we put into them. But have you ever gotten really emotionally attached to a video game character up to the point where it doesn't even make sense? Even ones that you can't even interact with (i.e. companion cube).\n\nYou can't really fully orchestrate player experience but there is something to be said about being truly emotionally attached to a set of polygons and pixels.\n\nI can name a few instances:\n\n-- Morrigan from dragon age, (Leilana disapproves -10? who gives a f***. Morrigan disapproves -1?! NoOoo!)\n\n-- Silly game back in the day called Dragon Seed. They should never let you name and raise your own pet dragon only for it to die later. *sniff*\n\n-- a couple of characters from Legend of Mana characters. that game is so charming.\n\n-- the horse from Shadow of Collosus.\n\nP.S. never got attached to companion cube...don't know why.\n\nLet's see...\n\nAlyx and Dog from Half Life 2.\n\nMinsc and Boo, obviously. Imoen too. And strangely enough, Sarevok. And Cespenar... and that Seamon chap, who gave me the blade of a githyanki silver sword... and Jaheira\n\nMorte from Planescape: Torment. Actually, come to think of it, I sort of got attached to ALL my party members there, Annah-of-the-Shadows, Nordom, Fall-From-Grace, Dak'kon. Brilliant game.\n\nTali'Zorah from ME and ME2. And EDI... and Joker... and to a lesser extent Wrex, Mordin, Garrus and Legion.\n\nTriss Merigold from The Witcher and The Witcher 2. Shani from The Witcher. Zoltan and Dandelion as well...\n\nAlistair, Morrigan and Leliana from DA:O. And Sandal, obviously. And the companion doggy.\n\nKaelyn, Safiya, Okku and Gannayev-of-Dreams from NWN2: Mask of the Betrayer. MotB was quite atmospheric, melancholic and otherworldly and so were the characters... and their voices, which mesmerized me to no end. Ammon Jerro from NWN 2. MotB was just great, almost as good as the original BG series. Almost. The original NWN 2 wasn't even close (which is not to say it was a bad game, no, it was really good, just not great).\n\nMona Sax from the Max Payne games.\n\nJin from F.E.A.R.\n\nScarlett Lake from Alpha Protocol.\n\nKerrigan since the original StarCraft. Raynor since SCII. Zeratul.\n\nThe rogue companions you could take from Act I in Diablo II.\n\nAnd if this list seems long to you, well keep in mind I've been playing games for a relatively long time and I've played through LOADS of games, and there are far more games(not to mention characters) not mentioned here. And it took me like 30 minutes to actually recall and write all of this. And I'm fairly certain theres more to add, but at the moment I can't think of any more characters.\n\nSolid FUCKING Snake- The guy was, and still is in my opinion, the most hardcore badass ever to grace gaming and is apart of a series that's nothing short of a total masterpiece.\n\nwerty10089 said:\n\nSpaceGnome said:\n\nwhen i saw the new spyro i died a little inside...\n\ndose that count?\n\nOh fuck, that. I truly hated what happened to the series, although once Insomnaic jumped ship it was obvious that major shittery was to occur. I'd say that one of the more emotional scenes in a game was when I completed all of the skillpoints in Spyro3 and had unlocked the epilogue. After reading the epilogue, the last page had a group pose of all of the characters from the trilogy with a caption \"we'll miss you\". Fucking cried. Something is wrong with me.\n\n...So, yeah. Having to kill Caesar in Fallout: NV.\n\nWe Devil May Cry Fans know and feel your pain...believe me we do."
