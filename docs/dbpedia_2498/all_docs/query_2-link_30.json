        "text": "Sudden Oak Death is a tree disease caused by the fungus-like plant pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. First recognized in the mid 1990s, the disease kills some oak species (primarily coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia, and an oak relative, tanoak, Notholithocarpus densiflorus) and has had devastating effects on coastal forests in California and Oregon. The pathogen also infects rhododendrons, camellias, and other common horticultural plants, causing ramorum blight. In the UK and Ireland, the pathogen is causing extensive damage on Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi) in plantations.\n\nPhytophthora ramorum was inadvertently introduced to California forests on nursery stock and, as an invasive species, is quarantined in over 60 countries with restrictions enforced on shipments of nursery stock and other host plant materials. For an introduction and background on Sudden Oak Death/P. ramorum read more here."
