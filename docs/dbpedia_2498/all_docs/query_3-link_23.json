Rowlet, Litten, and Poplio can help keep you safe while giving you the confidence you need to battle the baddies. You could rest easy knowing that someone’s got your back and will do their best to protect you while you do your hero thing. Isabelle\n\nIsabelle is the sidekick every hero dreams of: she’s smart, friendly, organized, and knows all the right people. In the Animal Crossing: New Leaf – Welcome amiibo game, you can depend on Isabelle to help you lay out your grand plans. You’re the hero, so go ahead and work on those brilliant ideas of yours. Isabelle would help you bring those plans to life! Luigi\n\nLittle brothers and little sisters (even cousins) can make great sidekicks. They already know all your secrets, and you know all their secrets too! Plus, family always sticks together. Just take a look at Mario and Luigi in the New Super Mario Bros. 2 game. Luigi is the best bro that a hero could ask for. He makes a great sidekick because he has amazing jumping skills and he doesn’t ask too many questions—he just jumps in with both feet."
