        "text": "In my last article, I detailed the ways in which horror gaming could teach one many lessons they could apply in-game and in real life. It could thus be said that the throughline of my write-up was the way in which video games—like books, movies, and other art forms—could entertain and educate the mind. This enabled audiences to think about how the title impacted them and how they may impact their fellow human beings in their daily endeavors.\n\nBut what if it were the other way around? What if instead of having people inherit ideas from the games they play and leverage them in the real world, they inherited ideas from the real world and leveraged them in video games?\n\nSuch a topic is particularly salient when the individual in question strongly adheres to a particular school of thought. In my case, the realm of Stoicism.\n\nWhen I say \"Stoic,\" I don't merely mean emotional resilience. I also refer to the embodiment of virtues—including wisdom, bravery, justice, and temperance—to navigate one's circumstances and surroundings.\n\nSuch was the line of thinking that minds of yore like Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Zeno of Citium swore by in their days on Earth, with modern thinkers such as Donald Robertson and Ryan Holiday keeping the philosophical flame burning in a world that can be dark in spots.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is that for the past few months, I've been delving deeply into many an RPG—be they tactical fare like The Banner Saga (2014) or narrative-focused journeys like Disco Elysium (2019). With their highly reactive worlds and emphasis on character growth and gameplay experimentation, RPGs feel like playgrounds in which to fulfill one's fantasy—including doing things they wish they could do (more of) in real life.\n\nAs someone who enjoys being of help to others wherever I go, RPGs provide a convenient avenue for honing the principles I've been living by since I first read about Marcus Aurelius close to three years ago. Whether it meant sticking to \"lawful/neutral good\" alignments in Dungeons & Dragons-inspired titles or choosing classes that favor charisma over combat, the choices I made to shape my character upon starting and while progressing through a game were only feasible because of how open-ended RPGs can be.\n\nRPGs can thus be quite the thinking person simulator—awash with obstacles, characters, and locales that test the player's morality just as ancient Greece and Rome put the Stoics through their paces. It's a feeling that puts a premium on deliberate progress rather than instant gratification, with RPGs being appropriately lengthy and challenging for generating such a sentiment.\n\nGiven the above, in what way do RPGs encourage (Stoic) players to progress through many trials virtuously? In this (personal) piece, I look at what draws the philosophically minded to a genre that lets one be a) a more capable rendition of their real selves or b) an idealized rendition of themselves in a virtual world with opportunities to do good as a bee would make honey.\n\nThey emphasize growth\n\nIn the words of a certain rodent in Ratatouille (2007), \"change is nature.\"\n\nWithin the context of human nature, such change generally comes in the form of growth. Growing out of old habits, growing into an expert in a particular field, literally growing up... Stoics believe that no matter how daunting change can be, one must strive for excellence via small but constant steps toward enlightenment. Like learning lessons in a classroom over nine months, then—albeit in environments that can harbor all manners of danger.\n\nThis is something Gothic (2001) makes abundantly clear, with its challenging penal setting and even more punishing hostile NPCs eager to make short work of the player avatar. Ergo, honing one's (non)-combat skills via task completion and careful exploration becomes the proverbial name of the game. By the time players reach the end game, they'll have gone from clumsily swinging a pickax to brandishing a sword with elegance and confidence. All because they took the time to respect the process of character growth instead of rushing to positive outcomes and swiftly buying the farm.\n\nThey compel me to explore the unknown\n\nThe fear of the unknown is quite feasibly one of humankind's oldest feelings. Whether it's dreading the idea of dying while trying to take down a mammoth or loathing potential encounters with unknown quantities who mean no harm, hatred of the uncertain seems hard-wired into folks' noggins.\n\nYet rather than deeming it a gloomy obstacle, the Stoics viewed the unknown as an opportunity to exercise courage and temperance by reaching out to folks and things one may've never stumbled upon before. This makes RPGs an ideal avenue for solidifying players' ability to embrace the uncharted and take their time doing so—lest they prematurely develop first impressions.\n\nGeneforge (2001) succeeds on that front by making the explorable unknown both physical and mental. From clearing the fog of war in long-abandoned dungeons to interacting with people whose ideology greatly differs from the one the Shapers bestowed on the player avatar, Geneforge is hardly lacking in encounters that can invite one's curiosity and challenge their past beliefs.\n\nIt's a testament to Spiderweb Software's efforts that the game encourages players to see all that the world has to offer so as to form a bigger and clearer picture of the situation at hand. Even if it means being exposed to locations and figures that take players by surprise on a physical and ideological level.\n\nThey let me help folks\n\n\"Have I done something for the common good?\" Marcus Aurelius said. \"Then I share in the benefits.\" Just as the Stoics served humankind in ancient times, so too can modern-day adherents to the philosophical school make a difference in virtual worlds that reflect the real one's social attitudes and economic models in some shape or form. Something RPGs are known for.\n\nGiven the genre's focus on populating realms with characters whom the avatar interacts with, players have ample opportunities to exercise virtue in a fictional world—training them to be honest-to-goodness souls in real life.\n\nOnline RPGs are especially convenient playgrounds for channeling one's inner Stoic. Whether they're playing earlier outings like Everquest (1999) and Asheron's Call (1999) or recent releases like Fallout 76 (2018) and Final Fantasy XIV (2013), gamers can be rewarded for cooperative play.\n\nLend a blade to others in daunting raids? Set up shop and sell precious resources to low-level players? Form a group dedicated to patrolling dangerous areas and protecting vulnerable avatars from powerful bad actors? Whatever the endeavor, online RPGs can be more than just interconnected power fantasies: They can also be empowering and wholesome fantasies.\n\nThey teach me temperance\n\nEven those who hardly play RPGs know that the genre isn't exactly known for being lean 'n mean. Between their expansive worlds and the likelihood of grinding for the sake of progress, genre offerings ask a lot from players in terms of time investment. This is particularly true when the hurdles the avatar faces are tricky to overcome and likely to get on players' nerves.\n\nBut as the aforementioned emphasis on growth suggests, focusing on the process rather than the outcome takes patience and allows a Stoic to see where they are erring and how to endure trials without getting discouraged.\n\nSoulsborne (2009 - Present) installments and Souls-like titles in general live and die by the mantra of persistence in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. From first meeting an enemy type and going belly up within mere seconds to eventually making said foe taste steel, ARPGs made or inspired by From Software make trial-and-error part of the learning experience.\n\nIn a way, it closely echoes the following Stoic saying: “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” It's just a matter of trusting one's ability to keep their cool and carry on in the long run.\n\nThey allow me to take less bellicose paths\n\nWhen one thinks of RPGs, they might picture an avatar laying waste to baddies and earning points for a job well done. While certainly representative of most genre entries, role-playing's open-ended nature means there is more than one way to overcome an obstacle. That is, there are ways to get around an obstacle instead of plowing through it with a fiery hammer.\n\nTo the Stoic, violence's an absolute last resort (unless there's no way to resolve things peacefully in which case self-defense is advisable). Instead, taking the time to study the situation and look for a path out of an impasse for the avatar and NPCs is something mindful players ought to strive for.\n\nUndertale (2015) takes pride in letting players treat their foes humanely so they may potentially see reason and realize the errors of their ways.\n\nWhile combat is oftentimes unavoidable, players aren't locked out of peaceful outcomes. They can choose to weaken their foes and spare them, or they may attempt to read their enemies' feelings and subsequently take non-violent action before any side sustains (too much) damage. Undertale highlights the importance of looking past one's monstrous appearance and unearthing the thing that makes them tick and receptive to de-escalation.\n\nThey make me get to learn and understand others\n\nRPGs are memorable for sundry reasons, not the least of which are the many characters one encounters and bonds/clashes with along the way. In the real world, it takes great courage to approach and interact with folks whom one never met. RPGs can be seen as safe environments in which players can fine-tune their ability and willingness to strike a chat with those around them.\n\nIn the eyes of a Stoic gamer, other characters would be seen as a chance for said player to understand why they are the people they've become and how best to assist/deal with them. Besides, a world's expansiveness comes not just from how big it appears, but also from its characters' depth and convictions...\n\n... which is the sort of characterization Planescape: Torment (1999) boasts.\n\nBetween Morte's shady dealings and Dak'kon's previous crises of faith, the Nameless One's companions come with their fair share of emotional baggage. It's thus up to the player to be brave and compassionate enough to take the time to hear their allies and other NPCs out. Doing so ensures that the Nameless One will have a better understanding of how his actions impact(ed) others and how he can in any way improve his standing among his companions and the masses. In other words, the player's compelled to use NPCs as mirrors for spotting their own character flaws and ironing them out.\n\nThey put me in worlds that tempt me to perform acts of vice\n\nIn a world where some folks think they're nothing without satisfying their material(istic) urges, brave is the one who keeps themselves in check—lest they compromise their moral principles. From being famished and refraining from feasting on human flesh to turning down a bribe that could drag one out of poverty, RPG worlds can be full of trials that separate the strong of character from the weak of mind. Trials the player may not easily avoid.\n\nBut as a quote implied earlier in this post, obstacles can be the way rather than in the way. This means that to the Stoic, tests of conscience can make one sturdier if they allow themselves to be exposed to tangible temptation.\n\nThis is the kind of premise Vampyr (2018) presents, with the vampiric avatar having to choose between restraining himself as a humane doctor (at the cost of leveling up) and sucking folks dry in order to grow stronger (at the cost of morality). In a way, the game shows the pros and cons of short-term pain and long-term gain, and short-term gain and long-term pain.\n\nGiven that restraint equates to mental labor—and that labor solidifies character—the Stoic player could choose to make their sacrifices personal and not treat those around the avatar as sacrifices for leveling up their skills.\n\nThey encourage improvisation and foresightful preparation\n\nRPG worlds can be a sight to behold and explore, but woe to those who let themselves be carried away by sensory delights and fail to notice the dangers that seek to do hapless travelers in. This is where the importance of gearing up and predicting likely hazards along the way comes into play, with inventory restrictions and character stats potentially shaping one's loadout.\n\nErgo, having a deep understanding of the land and its ecosystem(s) can help perceptive players since it enables them to exercise wisdom when thinking about which path to take and the minimum amount of travel time. Such preparations can be hugely beneficial when random encounters are a thing.\n\nIf there's one particular RPG that singles out careless adventurers for punishment, it'd be Outward (2019). From managing one's level of warmth/hunger/thirst/fatigue to realizing that the game doesn't let one reload earlier saves, players will come to understand the fact that they have to accommodate the game rather than the other way around. The result is a title that teaches players to slow down so they may assess current and future scenarios, treating the journey with due respect instead of overlooking its hardships and worth in favor of blindly sprinting to their coveted destination.\n\nTheir worldbuilding invites me to study goings-on and locales\n\nA defining trait of RPGs is the level of worldbuilding developers bake into the title's (back)story. Be it fascinating lore or current events that reveal something about how things operate around the avatar, an RPG's sense of place and history can help enrich the experience and solidify immersion.\n\nMore than that, however, worldbuilding gives players lots to study and internalize to become increasingly familiar with uncharted territory. What are the fauna and flora like? How do folks talk to one another and treat outsiders? Is there any kind of gear one should equip in specific sublocations? Sizing up the world means living in the here and now, being better prepped for its challenges. Such is the way of the foresightful Stoic.\n\nAnd such is the way of the titular Roadwarden (2022). Throughout their travels, the avatar can make the most of their time by exploring a wild peninsula and learning more about it. They'll become better equipped for conversations with hard-to-please NPCs and random encounters in the boonies. The worldbuilding thus becomes the (Stoic) player's best chum (on top of their trusty horse), with the quests they complete and belief systems they adhere to guiding them toward self-actualization and the feeling they've done some good through the diligent acquisition and wise use of knowledge.\n\nThey test my ability to make hard choices conscientiously\n\nPerhaps the bread-and-butter of active role-playing in games is the ability to make choices with long-lasting and/or irreversible consequences. If this doesn't compel players to do their homework on the world, its goings-on, and folks beforehand, nothing else does. Dilemmas, in a way, reward thorough exploration by making the fruits of one's labor meaningful and informative.\n\nChoices don't just exist for individualizing playthroughs: They're also there to test (Stoic) players' sense of circumspection, foresight, caution, and perseverance when things come down to the wire. Even if the outcome isn't ideal, the fact that one has weighed their options in morally gray situations proves they're willing to take calculated risks and trust the unknown.\n\nTyranny (2016) makes decision-making especially tricky and ambiguous by casting the player in the role of an evildoer's judge, jury, and executioner.\n\nSuch situations—in which morally good players may struggle—further encourage the Stoically minded to unearth the narrow windows of opportunity for performing acts of relative kindness. Letting a weakened fighter go (knowing they may seek a rematch), favoring an orderly but draconian group over a more unhinged one... Tyranny shows that however dire circumstances may be, one can still act in accordance with virtue—even if the side they are on doesn't make their magnanimity readily apparent.\n\nLet me know what you think of my post in the comments section, and feel free to ask questions and share the article.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Watfen64\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Michformer\n\nEmail: michelsabbagh2003@msn.com"
