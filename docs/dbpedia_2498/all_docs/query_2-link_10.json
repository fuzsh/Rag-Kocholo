        "text": "I've been talking theory in all the previous essays; in this one I shall sketch out how I would implement my Arthurian storyworld using the new concepts for the Encounter System.\n\nThree Act Structure\n\nFirst Act\n\nThe first group of encounters would be introductory in nature, helping the player get a feeling for the social, economic, and military situation in early 6th-century Britain. Arthur is the leader of the Romano-British forces defending against the advance of the Saxons westward across southern England. These encounters are primarily expository in nature, providing--but more important, requiring--little interaction. For the most part, the player's choices will be simple choices between self-assertion and personal goodwill. The question the player will have to answer is: is it better to be feared than loved?\n\nThis act will include 200 encounters, with the player experiencing 20 encounters per playing.\n\nSecond Act\n\nThe second group of encounters would provide deeper and more complex interactions with the characters. This would include a major cluster, the battle cluster, already developed using SWAT; I would have to translate the SWAT material into encounter format. I also intend to include some other encounters that force Arthur to decide how often to respond to characters' pleas for intervention against Saxons. Some characters would exaggerate the threat, taking Arthur on a wild goose chase, while Saxons elsewhere wreak havoc. Players would spend perhaps three-quarters of their time in the second act.\n\nThe battle scene already includes about 200 verbs. The remainder of the second act will include another 200 verbs.\n\nThird Act\n\nThe third act is initiated by Mordred raising the flag of revolt. The characters then choose up sides. The player's and Mordred's forces meet at Camlann, and a battle is fought. I will probably want to use different battle mechanics than those used in the second act's battle cluster. This final battle resolves the story.\n\nThe third act will not need many encounters; the battle will be short and will not depend primarily upon tactical skill on Arthur's part. Most battles will be decided before the third act begins.\n\nEvery encounter would be specific to a character; there would be no abstraction in encounters. Unlike previous designs, there would be no female characters. I don't want to make matters even more complicated with romantic interactions.\n\nI'm not sure how many characters I should use. I think I had 16 characters in the SWAT battle sequence; that's too many. But seven characters, the default size, is too small because victory or defeat at Camlann could be decided by a single defection.\n\nAlthough I intend to hew closely to the standard system with three personality traits, I'll have to include the measures of the military strength and prowess of the different characters. This will require substantial changes to the encounter editor."
