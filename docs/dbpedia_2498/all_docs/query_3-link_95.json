        "text": "I have been having a lot of fun playing People Can Fly’s insanely hectic new shooter, Bulletstorm. As expected, it features huge action setpieces, chaotic battles, over-the-top violence, and a big serving of puerile humour.\n\nWhat I did not expect, however, was for it to be unusually well-written. The dialogue is often very funny. I laughed out loud several times during the opening sequence. The characters also have unexpected depth and believability. Even the main character, Grayson Hunt, notorious for his creatively obscene use of language, has layers to him. Sure, he’s an exaggerated anti-hero, but he displays strengths and flaws that make him a bit more human than his gaming contemporaries.\n\nWhere the character work in Bulletstorm really shines is in the way they interact. Like many games, such as Uncharted and Gears of War, you fight alongside a sidekick. The big difference in this case is that your sidekick despises you.\n\nIt’s a very unusual relationship for a video game. Sidekicks tend to be helpers - an extra gun, a tool for solving puzzles, and so on. Like obedient dogs, they usually exist only to help you.\n\nThis sidekick, named Ishi, has good reason to hate Grayson. In the opening scenes we are shown that Grayson’s recklessness and thirst for revenge has left him and his crew as fugitives, with large bounties on their heads. Grayson’s determination to settle an old score sees his ship crashed on a hostile planet, half of his crew dead, and his pilot Ishi half-dead, with only a grafted-in medical computer keeping him alive.\n\nIshi is now barely alive, barely human, and borderline psychotic because of the artificial intelligence trying to take over his mind, and it is all Grayson’s fault. It is only the fact that they need to work together to get transport off the planet that stops the newly-created cyborg from killing his former captain there and then.\n\nGrayson also picks up a second sidekick a few hours into the game, a tough female soldier named Trishka. She is also stranded on the planet because of Grayson’s destructive revenge, and she hates him even more than Ishi does.\n\nAll of this recrimination and anger somehow makes the game a lot more interesting, especially because Grayson does not respond with anger or defensiveness when Ishi abuses him. Instead, it becomes clear that he is ashamed of his actions and worried about his friend’s wellbeing. Every time Ishi says or does something that shows he is still human, Grayson is clearly relieved.\n\nBulletstorm is definitely very entertaining from a gameplay perspective, with well laid-out levels, ridiculously overpowered guns, varied tactical options to choose from, and legions of bad guys to mow down, I am finding that it is the interactions between its three main characters that is holding my attention the most.\n\nMore than anything, I want to play through to the end to see what becomes of Ishi, if he can get the computer out of his brain, and whether his friendship with Grayson can ever recover.\n\nReaders, has there ever been another game in which a sidekick or support character simply hates you and makes no secret of it? I couldn’t think of any. The closest I could think of is the strained relationships between Trip, Monkey, and Pigsy in Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, but it isn’t really the same thing. Can you think of any? And who are your favourite gaming sidekicks of all time?\n\n- James “DexX” Dominguez"
