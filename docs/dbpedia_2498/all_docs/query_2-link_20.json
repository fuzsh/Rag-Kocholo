        "text": "Originally a Battlefield 4 profesional player, Thomas \"Morte\" Kerbusch has came, he has seen, and he has conquered. After leaving the competitive Battlefield scene in the middle of 2015, Morte has been quite successful in Blizzard Entertainment’s newest game, Overwatch, winning the previous Season of Overwatch Contenders, taking second place at the Overwatch TakeOver 2, and even having the chance to compete in South Korea in OGN’s Overwatch APEX Season 1. After their win over Bazooka Puppiez in the Overwatch Contenders Season 1, I caught up with Morte and had a quick chat with him about his time on eUnited, the Overwatch World Cup, and eUnited’s next opponents in Overwatch Contenders.\n\nGood evening Morte! First of all congratulations on the convincing 4-0 against Bazooka Puppiez. Could you talk about Hayes stepping in and playing with eUnited? Were you concerned going against Bazooka Puppiez on this new patch?\n\nThanks! Hayes actually plays the game a lot, knows how we play and what we play everywhere so it was a pretty easy for him and us. This patch actually favors us quite a bit & the next patch will probably put us back in our old element. I think you will basically start seeing a lot more compositions in about a month's time, basically, almost everything will become viable!\n\nSpeaking on that topic of viability, how do you personally value the characteristic of being a flexible player? Do you think they will shine in about a month's time when most things are viable?\n\nRealistically it's always been the same; some people get to play (mostly) one hero and one or two players per team have to be very good on multiple heroes. Being a top-tier flex player is always valuable, but being 'good' on everything just won't cut it in the Overwatch League.\n\nSpeaking of the Overwatch League and with recent announcements regarding eUnited, I know you and the eUnited core have played together for a very long time. Seeing how you all have become incredibly close, here is a thought experiment for you: if eUnited was Rick and Morty, who would be your “Rick” and why?\n\nI'm going to make a big confession here… I never have watched Rick and Morty, but honestly, this isn't really something I can really answer. I consider the whole team as close friends, but obviously if I do not end up playing with uNFixed or Vallutaja that would really hurt. We've been playing together for about 7 years now and obviously have become very good friends. We literally went around the world together, laughed more than we probably should have (haha) - a period in my life I will never forget.\n\nI went through something similar last year with TwoEasy, but we are both from the Netherlands and have been best friends for years already so it's not completely comparable.\n\nTo be clear, we aren't necessarily breaking up but we do realize it will increase our chances of getting into the Overwatch League considerably if everyone has the possibility to go his own way. We would obviously love to stay together, fingers crossed!\n\nTeam Netherlands stands proud on the Katowice stage.\n\nSpeaking of Team Netherland, could you talk about your time in Poland and what you thought about the Overwatch World Cup?\n\nWe were really pumped up in Poland, but unfortunately, couldn't make it to BlizzCon. Regardless the event was amazing, the team really clicked instantly. A lot of funny people in the team so I think we spent about half of the trip laughing. It was a great experience! The whole event was really fun, very well arranged!\n\nCould you share some of your thoughts about South Korea and Canada? Do you have any doubt in your mind that South Korea will take the Grand Final at BlizzCon 2017?\n\nI would be really surprised if South Korea doesn't win again this year. Canada just played really well around Mangachu being so good on Pharah and we didn't have an answer for it.\n\nHaving a good Pharah leads me into my next point. With the upcoming patch changes, what are some of your thoughts on the Mercy changes? Do you think Blizzard has approached her specific situation well?\n\nI'll have to see how it plays out, I'm not the biggest fan of the 'free' resurrection on a 30-second cooldown as it denies people getting punished for being out of position, but in general, I think it should make Mercy much more engaging to play, should be fun!\n\nBeing A part of one of the strongest European teams historically, what do you attribute to eUnited's success?\n\nTalent, dedication, brains and having a lot of fun which just makes the team atmosphere so much better! We are always very vocal, live off hype and historically are a very good offline team.\n\nBefore we wrap up, going into next week, eUnited plays Misfits and GamersOrigin. How are you and the boys approaching these matches? Is there anything that you are preparing for in particular?\n\nWe have some edgy compositions still available that we can pull out when needed. Realistically we just focus on ourselves and try to play our best, can't really do much more!\n\nLast but not least, let the people know what's going on in the life of Morte. Where can they find you on social media and a quick message to the fans?\n\nJust grinding it out, trying to make it into the Overwatch League! There has been quite some stuff going on surrounding the team lately and I can't thank our fans enough. Sticking with us for so long, even when we are not performing at our best, it's really something special!\n\nYou can find me on Twitter: @MorteOW and on Twitch.tv/morte.\n\nJoseph “Volamel” Franco has followed esports since the MLG’s of 2006.
