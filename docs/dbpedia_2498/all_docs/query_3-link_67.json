        "text": "Sidekick Displays Are Meant To Sell\n\nWhen it comes to catching customers' attention at retail stores, there's no better choice than using a Sidekick Display. That's because Sidekicks highlight specific products, are highly customizable, mobile, and can be moved around freely.\n\nNot to mention that they serve a variety of purposes in your marketing quiver. You could use one to sell new products and another to make a push on selling old inventory. They're such a versatile display that can be used in a lot of ways.\n\nWith all of the benefits associated with Sidekick Displays, it's no wonder they're so popular among retailers. These display units offer users a great way to showcase merchandise and grab the attention of passers-by. And, when it comes to retail stores, grabbing someone's attention is exactly what you need to do if you want them to make a purchase.\n\nIf you're planning on investing in Sidekick Displays for your store or are considering it - here are 5 design tips for your next Sidekick Display.\n\nTable Of Contents\n\n1. Design The Sidekick Around Your Products\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes you can make when designing your Sidekick Display is to create it around a product category - instead of designing it around your products.\n\nEvery design choice should be built around your product and its packaging. The Sidekick must be designed to enhance your product and encourage customers to investigate them.\n\nSo, take a look at the colors you have chosen and the design elements in place. That should be your guiding light to creating a custom Sidekick Display.\n\n2. Make It Easier For Customers To Shop\n\nThe Sidekick is there to show your customers that they need what you're selling. So, you should do everything in your power to make it easier for them to choose what they want. If they can't get to your products, you have a big problem.\n\nThat means if you are using a gravity-fed system, your products must replenish automatically so customers can buy more items. If they can't see your products, they'll move on.\n\nIf you have shelves, they need to be easy to re-stock for retail store associates. So the design needs to be easy for them to access to place enough products for more customers to buy.\n\nThe biggest enemy of businesses today is empty displays!\n\n3. Build For Multiple SKUs In One Display\n\nThere are two ways you can set up your Sidekick display. One way is to have Sidekicks with one SKU per display or a whole bunch of products in one unit.\n\nWhich method is best? It depends on your business model and what works for you. To make the most impact at retail stores, using multiple SKUs in each Sidekick Display would be better because that will give you more presence in the store itself.\n\nSometimes, a display that has replenishment items is the right choice, while other times, it's putting items together that sell well. But that means your overall design should enhance the products you are selling together.\n\nThat might be an overall theme like Back To School, or it could be color choices that split the overall shape of the display.\n\n4. Get Inspired At Retail Stores\n\nWhen it comes to creating the perfect Sidekick Display, you need to do your research. Visit different stores and see what they offer in terms of Sidekick displays.\n\nMost retailers who take their retail game seriously will invest in high-quality products. That includes display units like the Sidekick - which generally makes them easier targets for brands who are looking to get inspired by retail store designs (and maybe even steal a little inspiration).\n\nYou can get great ideas about how to design your next Sidekick Display by shopping other retailers - but remember that your brand identity should come through whenever you're emulating another retailer.\n\nThe best ideas aren't created in a vacuum. They're created from inspiration. That means you should investigate what customers are responding to and begin your design there.\n\n5. Include Key Product Benefits For Customers\n\nIt's not enough to show your product in a Sidekick Display. You need to make sure that your product is properly positioned for the customer. This means creating the best possible design and packaging.\n\nThat means focusing on your USP (Unique Selling Position) - which should be built around the key benefits of what you're selling. The package needs to stand out from its competition and create excitement about what people will experience when they buy it.\n\nThe visual elements like color, images, angles, and shapes all come into play as part of an overall design that positions your everyday item as something worth buying because it offers great value. That includes value for customers who keep coming back to purchase again and again.\n\nMore Information On Sidekick Displays\n\nThe Complete Guide To Sidekick Displays\n\nDigital Printing Tips For Sidekick Displays\n\nIncrease Sales With Sidekick Displays\n\nBenefits Of Sidekick Displays\n\nCreate A Custom Sidekick Display Today!\n\nDesigning a Sidekick Display for your business can be an extremely effective way to increase sales and drive traffic to your products.
