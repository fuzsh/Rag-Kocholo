        "text": "Raven Rock Ball said:\n\nlets see my favorite video game charactor... ahh i remember now, it's Marth from Super Smash Bros.Melee. he is strong, but i know not as strong as Roy, but Roy doesn't have black clothing, i checked and Marth does, so i picked Marth because he is one of the strongest charactors and one of his outfits is black.\n\nIf Marth really is your favorite character you should give him credit as being from the Fire Emblem series. Saying he is from SSBM is like saying that's where Mario, Capton Falcon and Pikachu are from. When we all know they are from the Mario series, F-Zero series and the Pokemon series respectivly. whew...\n\nAnyway, my favorite character eh? Well I love Breve Fencer Musashi from the game of the same name. Vivi from FFIX is about as cute as it gets. Laharl from Disgaea is an enjoyable character... But honestly, no character really makes my as happy as Mario. He's simple and his games have all been fun. When you see him on a package you know you are in for a good time. So yeah, I'll go with Mario, as cliche as it may seem.\n\nOpaque said:\n\nYou're doing this to me on purpose huh?\n\nI doubt it - and even if they were, I'm glad they did because without wanting to shake everyone's life, I didn't play the game/series whatever. Opaque, Nintendo is not the axis of the videogame world. Games were big before Nintendo and there is a healthy market beyond it now. While I enjoy the occasional Nintendo game, I've not spent my day diligently following all their games, so their explanations are VERY useful. I'm sure there are more like me. So please, lay off people for their reference. Thanks.\n\nPeople, keep on referencing where your characters come from - even if it's Cloud from FFVII or Snake from the MGS series. Not everyone has played this games or is a hardcore fan. Some people don't want to be.\n\nOkay, I think I'll call Laguna from FFVIII - just because he was a real 3 dimensional and humourous chararacter. I also liked Thomas F Wilso- erm, I mean Bif- erm, I mean Maniac from Wing Commander III onwards... Biff (whatever he pretends to call himself in other shows and real life) is the best.\n\nI doubt it - and even if they were, I'm glad they did because without wanting to shake everyone's life, I didn't play the game/series whatever.

While I enjoy the occasional Nintendo game, I've not spent my day diligently following all their games, so their explanations are VERY useful. I'm sure there are more like me. So please, lay off people for their reference. Thanks.\n\nI think you misunderstood, SJJ. He wasn't saying that you shouldn't specify what game the characters are from, he was saying that Marth and Roy aren't from Smash Bros Melee, they're from Fire Emblem. It does seem a little odd to reference a character as being from Smash Bros, since all the characters from Smash Bros are characters from other games.\n\nHere's some favorites:\n\nSonic, Tails and Knuckles, hands down. Tails and Knuckles a lot more than Sonic, though. Cream gets some love too.\n\nAgrias Oaks from Final Fantasy Tactics\n\nLuigi Mario from... anything he's in... but my favorite incarnation is in Mario & Luigi. Mario from the same sources.\n\nFawful. I HAVE FURY!\n\nProtoman, for being too cool, and I have a soft spot for Megaman and Roll as well. I think I prefer their .EXE versions.\n\nWario and his crew from WarioWare.\n\nMr. Game and Watch from SSBM -- and I really don't understand what's wrong with saying you like characters from SSBM. Maybe you like their SSBM version and don't give a flip about any other version. So please don't tell me I mean Game & Watch from Game & Watch Gallery or whatever, I really mean SSBM version.\n\nSJJ said:\n\nI doubt it - and even if they were, I'm glad they did because without wanting to shake everyone's life, I didn't play the game/series whatever.

I like you.\n\nThat would be my point. I don't care if people say where characters are from, they should, and heck I did. Marth and Roy are great characters for sure, I'm just saying you can't say they are from SSBM because no characters are \"from\" SSBM, they are all from other games and were then placed in SSBM becasue of their affiliation with the big N.\n\nThat's all I'm saying. Seems easy enough to understand from over here."
