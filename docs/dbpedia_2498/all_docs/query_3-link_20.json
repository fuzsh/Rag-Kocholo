        "text": "Come one, come all to GameSpot's All-Time Greatest Game Sidekick--the competition where you choose which video game companion becomes a legend. GameSpot's editors have compiled a list of 80 iconic allies across the entire history of video games, from the arcade games of yesteryear all the way to the modern PC and console games of today. And now's your chance to have your say. Vote now!\n\nHere's where things stand: The initial vote is open, which means that your votes will narrow down this initial field of 80 characters to 64. Yes, you can vote for up to 64 of the most memorable, helpful, powerful, and lovable game sidekicks between now and August 28. On the 29th, the 64 most highly voted characters will move on to the bracket phase.\n\nBrackets, you say? Yes, brackets. Much like the brackets used in the NCAA March Madness college basketball series, All-Time Greatest Game Sidekick will then pit the 64 sidekicks you voted for against each other in a series of competitive rounds that will all be decided by your votes. With each phase of bracket voting, half of the competitors will be sent home, and we'll get closer and closer to reaching the final four, and then the final two, and finallyâ€¦the single All-Time Greatest Game Sidekick. There can be only one.\n\nBetter still, starting on August 29, you'll be able to seed your own bracket and try to predict which game characters will come out on top. Can you pick the best brackets? Can you predict which game character will triumph over all? If you can, you could win fabulous prizes, up to and including the ultimate home gaming setup, which includes all three consoles and a huge new gaming TV! Along with bragging rights and the respect and awe of your peers, of course.\n\nStart here with the initial vote! And get ready to rumble next week once brackets open. Good luck! And once you've made your picks, join us in the All-Time Greatest Game Sidekick forum."
