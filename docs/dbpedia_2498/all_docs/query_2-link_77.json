A court decision in NY permits medical personnel to stop all support measure for a person in irreversible coma and then pronounce death when heart and lung activity cease. Thos who act to halt support will not be liable for the death: the condition that led to irreversible coma would be the cause of death.\n\nSeveral groups are advocating a change in the law to move from brain criteria back to the heart and lung criteria.\n\nLEGISLATIVE OPTIONS\n\nDetermination of death\n\nThe law generally supports customary medical practice and provides the medical profession with a great deal of autonomy. A dramatic example is the determination of death and the issuance of a death certificate. In almost every country of the world a physician declares a person dead and issues a death certificate after a determination of death is made in accordance with accepted medical standards. A question that recently appeared was whether physicians should continue to be given the authority to declare a person dead if the medical profession were to adopt whole brain death as an acceptable definition of death (instead of the past definition of irreversible cessation of respiration and heartbeat). A mechanical respirator can artificially maintain the respiration and circulation of a person whose functions would cease without such mechanical support. In the late 1960s the potentials of organ transplantation from such persons were becoming realized, and the seeming futility of devoting limited medical resources to maintaining circulation under such circumstances was of growing concern. Physicians began proposing that irreversible cessation of brain activity be used as an alternative definition of death.\n\nSince that time, most Western countries have adopted a revised definition, by either continuing to permit physicians to declare death, passing a specific statute endorsing this brain oriented definition, or issuing court opinions giving approval to physicians' declarations of death in such circumstances. The law, in short, has continued to defer to medical practice in the definition of death itself.\n\nThe countries that have not adopted brain oriented death criteria have not done so primarily for cultural and religious reasons. For example, Japan has refused to adopt a brain-based definition of death in part because it would conflict with religious tenets that require the death of all major organs prior to a pronouncement of death. Accordingly, such medical techniques as heart transplantation cannot be performed in Japan (or in any country that does not accept a brain-death definition).\n\nHarvesting a beating heart from a person is considered in such countries to be homicide, even though brain activity has ceased and respiration is being maintained artificially.\n\nWhat shall be the criteria for a new law?\n\nLegislative Definitions of Death\n\nDefining Death in Theory and Practice :\n\nJames L. Bernat, Charles M. Culver, and Bernard Gert\n\nAs informed citizens you have a right to express your views and your values.\n\nYou dont want to pronounce people dead who are alive.\n\nYou dont want to pronounce people alive who are dead.\n\nYou dont want to pronounce people dead because you dont like their condition.\n\nYou dont want to pronounce people dead because you ant the organs.\n\nWhat shall count in pronouncing someone dead?\n\nSOULS??? CONSCIOUSNESS???\n\nIts your life! Its your DEATH!!!\n\nIn the meantime be cautious of medical personnel using the terms \"coma\" and \"brain death\". Ask for clarification and critical testing."
