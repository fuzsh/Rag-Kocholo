        "text": "Abelard Werserian\n\n\"I am certain it was a necessary sacrifice. And, as time has shown, one that was not in vain.\"\n\nThe diligent and imperious Abelard Werserian was first officer on an Imperial Navy voidship until fate intervened in the form of your predecessor, an eccentric and wayward Rogue Trader, Theodora von Valancius. Now decades later as your right hand, Abelard remains vigilant against threats to your trade empire. He is one of the most reliable members of the crew, fiercely loyal to the dynasty he helped to build and operate. Abelard is the melee damage dealer – he is a proficient close combat expert, able to taunt enemies and shield other companions from damage. Abelard also knows a lot about the inhabitants of the Koronus Expanse, and will help significantly when you encounter noble intrigues and mysteries\n\nIdira Tlass\n\n\"The little voices are whispering that there's trouble waiting up ahead. And if you don't take things down a notch, you could be caught with your trousers down. Figuratively or literally, I'm not sure.\"\n\nIdira Tlass is an unsanctioned psyker and a diviner who is able to discern events yet to come and paths yet to be uncovered. In the eyes of the Imperium, she's viewed as a mutant and a heretic who is too dangerous to remain alive. That is why Idira, who fell into the Rogue Trader's crew by the will of fate, is traveling on a voidship in secret, hidden from the harsh gaze of Imperial society. She has an incredible yet treacherous talent for discerning the future from the faint whispers of the void. Gifted and somewhat cocky, she makes up for her lack of proper training and caution with her formidable self-control and natural aptitude. As a team member, Idira can support and boost the player’s party or use deadly ranged psychic attacks that confound and damage enemies. She's also pretty handy with a gun in a pinch. Idira’s cavalier attitude and underestimation of the Warp come at a price. With each passing day, she is less and less sure whether the voices in her head are her own thoughts or murmurs from the other side\n\nPasqal Haneumann\n\n\"I am a Magos Explorator. A reconnoitrer of knowledge, a beam of lumen in the darkness of the unknown. I know not how to fear you. I only know how to explore and kill.\"\n\nPasqal Haneumann is a Magos Explorator of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and has spent many decades on the march toward planets yet unknown and systems yet unconquered. He confronted a most terrible enemy: dissent among his fellows, a schism that could shake the Imperium to its foundations. Pasqal stepped away from the Explorators' endeavour for decades in order to ponder the dilemma he was facing. This Tech-Priest is prepared to endure anything for his thirst for knowledge. He is well-versed in mechanisms and is indispensable for disassembling and repairing various devices. Pasqal is proficient in the language of machines and can take advantage of this on the battlefield by giving orders to servitors or other mechanisms. He can also handle himself in a fight if necessary.\n\nCassia Orsellio\n\n\"Fear not, I have my Navigator skills to call upon. Statistically speaking, you are far more likely to perish in battle. Oh, I mean, that came out wrong...\"\n\nCassia Orsellio is a young daughter of a Navis Nobilite House native to the Koronus Expanse. Thanks to a unique mutation and a third eye, Cassia, like all Navigators, can navigate through the warp for the Rogue Trader's giant voidship. Cassia's Navigator bloodline elevates her above ordinary mortals, and her formidable powers enable her to pierce the warp with her gaze and scorch human souls. Despite her naivety and fragility, Cassia is a powerful being who can turn the tide even in the most desperate battle. On the battlefield, Cassia can not only look into the enemy's soul to instill fear in them but also use her navigator's powers togive her allies additional strength.\n\nYrliet Lanaevyss\n\n\"You are amusing, little mon-keigh. Your life is shorter than a moth's, and you spend it digging around in the carcass of dead, malevolent metal. But you speak of eternity and the stars. I like that. It is like seeing starlight reflected in a puddle.\"\n\nYrliet is a proud Aeldari whose ancestors made journeying through the star-studded darkness their eternal calling. Having chosen to walk the Path of the Outcast, Yrliet left the enormous craftworld that her kin called home. She sought to blaze her own trail in a universe that would otherwise lie beyond the reach of Aeldari society, and she followed that desire to distant stars. However, new insights and experiences sometimes come at great cost – as Yrliet is about to discover. Yrliet is an Aeldari Ranger – her mastery lies in speed and accuracy, making every enemy die with a single well-placed shot. Also, her insight into the nature of various xenos makes her invaluable in finding their weaknesses.\n\nSister Argenta\n\n\"The Emperor's light banishes all lies. But you will never understand that.\"\n\nSister Argenta is a member of Adepta Sororitas. Also known as the Sisters of Battle, these fierce and devoted women make up the militant arm of the Ecclesiarchy, the state church of the Imperium of Man. It seems that Argenta lives and breathes for one purpose – to achieve perfection worthy of the Emperor's most faithful warriors. She is unstoppable, audacious – sometimes too audacious. The battlefield is her temple, and bolter rounds are the words of her fervent prayer. When she rushes into battle, the ship's bulkheads reverberate with the passion of her prayers, and her allies feel the surge of power. Argenta, as a member of the Adepta Sororitas, is proficient in bolters and flamers and can use them to the highest degree. Her abilities allow her to quickly change her position and lay cleansing fire across the battlefield.\n\nJae Heydari\n\n\"I am counting on life in your retinue being more exciting than sitting behind a desk in my office.\"\n\nJae Heydari, a precious jewel of Footfall, a link in the glittering gold chain that is the Kasballica Mission among Cold Traders, a woman of countless talents and myriad mysteries, is truly the cream of the scum of the Koronus Expanse. A seasoned dealmaker and adept mediator of commerce with the enemies of Humanity, Jae has earned the great respect of many in the Footfall underworld and incurred the much, much greater hatred of her less successful rivals. Jae will not pass up any opportunity to curb the evil tongues of her enemies and keep their long knives at bay. And a Rogue Trader’s influence is her most coveted weapon – for who would dare go against the business partner of one who holds a Warrant of Trade, the gracious one anointed by the Emperor, and sent Jae Heydari’s way by providence itself? Jae is all about being where she needs to be and when she needs to be, both in life and in combat. As a team member, Jae specialises in rapidly getting into the most advantageous position to lay a barrage of shots from her burst weapons\n\nHeinrix van Calox\n\n\"At the cost of thousands upon thousands of souls? No. Secrets uncovered at such a price are corruption unto themselves, staining the soul and leading to ruin.\"\n\nInterrogator Heinrix van Calox is a sanctioned psyker – a living weapon of the Inquisition, an example of the vile power of the warp, bound and controlled by the vigorous training and unbending will of the man himself. Many twists and turns of fate brought van Calox from his Knight world home to the service of the Ordo Xenos, with his diverse specialties and formidable psychic powers making him indispensable in the eyes of his pre-eminent mentor. It is this high-standing and powerful individual who set Heinrix on a mission of his own – one that eventually led the Interrogator to meet the Rogue Trader. Heinrix is a quick and agile melee fighter with psychic abilities. This combination allows him to kill his enemies while using psychic powers to protect and strengthen his allies or disable opponents.\n\nUlfar\n\n“Before becoming an Astartes, I dreamed of becoming a skjald, a keeper of stories. At feasts, I often sing of my brothers' exploits. Thousands are stored in my memory. When I am near, Wolves fight even more ferociously, for they know their deeds will be immortalised.”\n\nWrathful Ulfar stepped on the hunting path many decades ago, and ever since, a trail of blood has followed in his wake. With a triumphant howl, he thunders into every fight without fear - for there is no fear of death for one whose saga will be forever sung with reverence by their brothers in the Hall of the Great Wolf. His violent temper and youthful craving for fame and boasting have not simmered with years of campaigns. His loud laughter instills awe in the hearts of ordinary mortals, and his stern roar wrings horror from his enemies. His memory is as strong as the jaws of a wolf, holding the saga of each battle-brother and his every deed. Though he excels in all forms of warfare, his Fenrisian nature beckons him into close combat, where he can stare into the eyes of his dying prey.\n\nMarazhai\n\n“The sole thing that your kind is good for, mon-keigh, is your ability to suffer. I have long been surfeited with physical pain — your kin provide it in abundance from their cages in Commorragh. The pain of the soul, on the other hand... is a rare delight.”\n\nMarazhai Aezyrraesh, the Dracon of the Kabal of the Reaving Tempest, is a true scion of Commorragh, who is driven by an insatiable lust for violence and power over others - things which he achieves through subtle cunning, shady deals, and — to his great delight — carnage and the agonizing torture of his enemies. Everything changes when another raid in realspace goes awry, and Marazhai realizes that this time it was he who was being hunted. It's time to strike back, not wait for the enemy to get ahead. Marazhai is a pinnacle of Drukharis' martial prowess. Eye-watering fast, inhuman agile, and horrifyingly deadly up close."
