        "text": "Mad Max\n\nAction PlayStation 4\n\nMad Max is a third-person action and vehicular combat game set in an open world environment. It is based on the Mad Max movie series and was released following the 2015 movie Mad Max: Fury Road. It uses many elements from the films, but has its own storyline not based on the movies. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, barren wasteland and combines sections on foot with vehicular action. The entire game world is available right away and the player can pursue the main quest, side missions or explore freely. Some game elements are inspired by the Just Cause series by the same developer. The protagonist is Max Rockatansky (Mad Max) and he is on his way to the Plains of Silence. In the beginning of the game his car, the Interceptor, is stolen. Bandits known as War Boys, led by Scabrous Scrotus (the son of Immortan Joe from Fury Road), leave him behind in the desert without his car, weapons or supplies. Max wants to find back his vehicle, take vengeance on Scrotus and build Magnum Opus, the perfect car.\n\nA large part of the game is spent driving as Max teams up with the mechanic Chumbucket who rides along. Max has a dog as a companion and gets to build a new car to become the Magnum Opus. Various upgrades become available during the course of the game by spending scrap, the main game currency, next to fuel to keep driving. Others are provided by collecting car parts of enemies or by hijacking cars. Next to guns, car weapons include a flamethrower, a grappling hook, a mounted cannon etc.. While racing a slow-motion function is be activated to provide assist while aiming. Chumbucket repairs the car automatically. There is a large amount of customization that affects the driving (chassis, wheels, engine, handling, nitro, suspension) as well as combat, with spikes to protect against boarding, armour, ramming grills, explosive harpoons, and aesthetic options such as new car bodies and paint jobs. Certain sections are not accessible by car and require Max to climb and travel on foot with ranged weapons and melee combat based on attacking and forming combos, blocking and dodging. Markers above the enemies' heads announce actions and the fighting system is similar to the Batman: Arkham games. Health is replenished by eating small animals.\n\nThere is a leveling system for Max and tokens earned through challenges can be exchanged for perks. A mysterious stranger called Gryffa also often reveals slices of Max' past. The world is divided into different territories where the enemy threat can be lowered by completing missions such as clearing minefields, taking out snipers, tearing down scarecrows, attacking convoys and invading camps. Camps offer many approaches to get inside and clear them with both blunt action and stealth. There are other activities such as racing and time trials or collecting history relics. Sometimes devastating sandstorms occur, rewarding adventurous players with large amounts of scrap for venturing outside. Hot air balloons can be located to use them for fast travel. There is a day-and-night cycle, environmental hazards and a border to the game world that is not clearly defined, leading into The Big Nothing where Max can attempt to survive as long as possible. A territory is cleared entirely by defeating a boss in an enemy stronghold. It is also possible to visit friendly strongholds that provide quests and rewards for bringing down the enemy activity in the region. Magna Carta\n\nAll Action & Adventure PlayStation2 4.0 (2 votes)\n\nTo fill the void left by the absence of Kingdom Hearts 2 and Final Fantasy 12, I decided to buy this game, as it looked good in the shop... This game is very good, and traditional RPG gamers will love it as much as new fans of role players. The first thing I noticed about this game, was the stunning graphics. The graphics are some of the best I have seen on the Playstation 2.\n\nThe story revolves around a group of fighters called The Tears Of Blood, headed by a man named Calintz (who looks a lot like a women!). You join forces with comrades in the upcoming war against the Yason, the ultimate enemy of humans.\n\nThe battle system can be quite overwhelming at first, but you go through a large tutorial at the start (but there is a lot of information to take in at once, so, battle understanding grows while playing). The battles are almost turn-based, with the turns being decided by the Leadership Bar. You can swap to which of your party you wish to control, but you can only control one at a time. Attacks are carried out by using the Trinity Circle, where you must press either X or 0 at the correct time, or you fail.\n\nPlays of Star Ocean may see a very small resemblance between Star Ocean and Magnacarta. Magnacarta borrows from traditional RPGs, with things such as Levelling Up and HP etc.\n\nSo, if you are a huge RPG fan, who likes a mixture of old and new RPG gaming, then this is for you...\n\nGraphics - 10/10\n\nGameplay - 7/10\n\nMusic - 6/10\n\nLongativity - 7.5/10\n\nOverall - 8/10 Mario Kart 7\n\nRacing / Driving Nintendo 3DS 83\n\nMario Kart 7 is the seventh installment of the fast paced kart racing game which features an all-star cast from the Super Mario universe. The game continues the tradition of featuring various courses for eight players to race through while using a number of different power ups; avoiding banana peels, and launching red shell projectiles at rival opponents. The mechanics of Mario Kart have evolved allowing the race karts to transform in the middle of a race between a hang glider and a hydro submersible vehicle upon encountering aerial of underwater course segments respectively. The customization also introduces new features in building the ultimate vehicle, choosing from various frames which range in weight, a selection of tires which affect the handling of the vehicle on certain surfaces. There are 32 selectable tracks of which sixteen are new tracks, and the others are enhanced tracks from previous games. Several returning items like Koopa Shells, Banana Peels, and Super Mushrooms are present. Mario Kart 7 also features three items new to the Mario Kart series: the Fire Flower, the Super Leaf, and Lucky 7, which bestows seven items at once. In addition to traditional controls, Mario Kart 7 can be played using the Nintendo 3DS gyroscope, in which the action is viewed in first person and the player steers the kart simply by turning the entire game system. While racing, collecting coins can provide the vehicle with a brief boost of speed.\n\nMultiplayer is supported for up to eight people in Grand Prix, VS, and Battle Modes. Time trial \"ghost\" data can be shared as well, and Nintendo 3DS owners who don't have the game can use the Download & Play option to join in Grand Prix mode. The improved multiplayer mode allows eight players to connect online and compete together. Players will be treated with a detailed stat tracker that can be exchanged with other players through StreetPass and SpotPass networking features. The innovative community feature allows for several online customization, matchmaking, and player networking. Mario Kart Wii\n\nNintendo Wii 4.5 (7 votes)\n\nMario and friends make a spectacular return in this definitive version of Mario Kart, providing the most action-packed, adrenaline-filled racing fun ever seen in the series. Players will have to master a host of 16 exciting new tracks in addition to 16 classic tracks from previous Mario Kart games.\n\nFor the first time ever players will have the option of racing with karts or a brand new mode of transport – Bikes. Using bikes as your chosen method will offer up some interesting and different gameplay possibilities such as carrying out a \"wheelie\", which in turn will give you a small boost that could be crucial and make that all important difference at the finishing line.\n\nPlayers will also be able to hit the road as their own personalized Mii caricatures in addition to many classic and even some never-before seen characters in Mario Kart games. True to the series, Mario Kart Wii will feature adrenaline pumping racing action, a plethora of power-ups and masses of objects for players to use to slow down their rivals. Also with 10 battle arenas, players are sure to be kept busy between trips around the circuit.\n\nCombining all the much-loved features from the series, Mario Kart Wii also sees a whole host of stunning new tracks, characters, weapons and vehicles. Those however looking for world ranking domination can take on up to 11 players simultaneously worldwide using the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service which will offer them the chance to race other players across the globe in a nail-biting contest of speed and skill! Prefer to keep the rivalry a little closer to home? Try the Multiplayer Mode, in which up to four people will be able to challenge each other in the comfort of their own living room, bringing the on screen excitement into a whole new dimension.\n\nIn addition to all this a new Wii Channel, the Mario Kart Channel, will also be launched with Mario Kart Wii. Players will be able to monitor their ranking against others with data compiled from races completed online as well as also access and share Ghost Data to download. Why not see if your friends are playing by checking their status or even better still set up a room in which you can chat to them before a race starts? Players even have the possibility to join in on their friends races in progress as a spectator and jump into the race when the next course launches. Through this channel, users will be exposed to a host of new online features allowing them to join a community of racing fans from all over the world as well as participate in special worldwide events organised by Nintendo.\n\nMario Kart Wii comes bundled with a new and intuitive accessory - the Wii Wheel, which makes it one of the most accessible Mario Kart games to date and allows complete novices to compete with ease and comfort, ensuring no one is left in the dust.\n\nMario Kart Wii supports five different control options: Wii Wheel, Wii Remote turned on its side, Wii Remote and Nunchuk combination, Classic Controller and even Nintendo GameCube controller. There’s a configuration that fits everyone’s experience, level and style. Mario Kart: Double Dash!\n\nDriving & Racing GameCube 4.5 (107 votes)\n\n\"Mario Kart: Double Dash!!\" has got to a lot to prove. The original \"Super Mario Kart\" on the SNES is still lauded by many as one of the best driving games--and one of the best multi-player games--ever made, but \"Mario Kart 64\" had a less unanimous welcome.\n\nThankfully, \"Double Dash!!\" has got everything right--indeed this is probably the best first-party sequel so far for the GameCube: the graphics are excellent, the power-ups are more insane than ever and most importantly the handling of the karts is excellent, with the powerslide of the SNES original all-important once more.\n\nThe big new gimmick for \"Double Dash!!\" is the fact that there are customised karts for you to drive, all of which can seat two characters. This ensures a surprising amount of tactical depth as you can switch the characters around mid-race in order to access each one's unique special weapons. As ever with Nintendo games, the gameplay is perfectly balanced so that the use of power-ups never overshadows the need to be a skilful driver. Indeed, the improved AI of the computer players is immediately noticeable as they move around the tracks in a highly intelligent manner, moving out of your way and blocking you off when necessary.\n\nOf course the real draw with any \"Mario Kart\" game is the multi-player mode and this is as insanely enjoyable as ever in either race or battle mode. Indeed it's better than ever as you can now have up to 16 people playing at one time if you link up your GameCubes using broadband adapters. --\"David Jenkins\"\n\nEtt av de spel jag spenderat mest tid med. Inte själv, utan tillsammans med polarna. Mario Kart må präglas möjligheterna att spö upp varandra och på så sätt vinna även om man inte kör bra men det är ju det som är charmen. Mario Party\n\nAction & Adventure Nintendo 64 4.0 (2 votes)\n\nMario games come and go, but this one is a game that any loyal Nintendo fan shouldn't be without. The aim is simple. Players take it in turns to move around a game board collecting stars as they go in order to defeat the evil Bowser. A variety of boards await the players, ranging from a tropical island to Mario's castle amongst the clouds. But what makes a computerised board game more fun than a real life one?\n\nWell, the Mario humour, familiar characters, obstacles that spring up out of the blue to stop you getting that all important star, the bright and colourful graphics, the ability to steal from your opponent, hilarious mini games and much much MUCH more which make the game so unique and enjoyable. Though the graphics aren't visually stunning, the hand drawn backgrounds are well done and never fail to bore you. Even with all this, it would be a very average game if it weren't for the 50 different mini games that players can take part in. The large variety of mini-games makes a nice mix, and you won't often encounter the same mini-game twice in the same game. The variety is important, and will keep you coming back for more, guaranteed. They truly are a multiplayer treat and is one of the reasons why the game has spawned 3 sequels. And if that isn't enough, there are secret items to be bought once you gain enough coins from the game. But even with the standard rules, every game is never the same and will keep you playing it long after you've unlocked every mini-game, every item, every secret board and even completed the game.\n\nNot all games are perfect however and one downside to Mario Party its habit of destroying controllers and hands. There are a number of mini-games that require you to rotate the control stick around very quickly and when done repeatedly will knacker out the stick over time. Another bad point is the one player mode. The game lacks somewhat, because it plays identically to the multiplayer version except with computer opponents instead of human, the obvious downside is the mini-games are less fun and you feel picked on by the computer players. But these are only minor faults (it is a multiplayer game afterall) and if had been worked on, the game may have deserved a five star rating. For groups of two, three or four people though, Mario Party is a Nintendo 64 classic, and while not perfect, is a solid multiplayer game and a legend in it's own right. Martian Gothic: Unification\n\nAction PlayStation\n\nIt's the year 2017. The planet Earth sets up a research station, Vita Base, on Mars with the mission to discover if life did exist there. After a discovery there comes one last garbled message—danger, danger cliché approaching--“have opened Pandora’s box… all the evils of old Mars have flown out,” and a warning, “…if you do send a manned mission, warn the crew…Stay Alone, Stay Alive…” then nothing. So now it’s 2018, and your rescue mission to Mars crash lands. When you get to the base, the welcome wagon is made up of zombies and an alien virus that will make you look back fondly on the days of the Black Plague.\n\nYou control a team of three: Kenzo, Karne and Matlock. They enter the base from different airlocks and try to discover what happened. The reason for the whole \"Stay alone, stay alive\" warning is that if your team members come together they end up forming into a disgusting mass of flesh -- picture the thing from Leviathan -- called a Trimorph.\n\nAs you proceed though the base you find clues as to what occurred. In addition, you run into Trimorphs, some of the non zombiefied former base crew, that are bent on your destruction. They come in two sizes -- the small spidery kind which hack at your shins and jump on your face or the huge \"better run like hell\" monstrosities that will tear you to pieces. Max Payne\n\nAction PlayStation 2\n\nMax Payne was a police officer of the New York City police. On one terrible day, his wife and newborn daughter were killed by three junkies, who broke into his apartment after having ingested a new designer drug known as Valkyr. After the tragedy, Max quit the police force and joined the Drug Enforcement Administration. Three years later, during a raid on a mafia compound that was reportedly trafficking Valkyr, his best friend and fellow DEA agent Alex is killed, and he becomes the prime suspect in his murder. Now Max is all alone in the cold, snowy night of New York. The mob is out to get him. The police are out to get him. The only way out is with guns blazing, because he has nothing to lose.\n\nMax Payne is a third person shooter stylistically influenced by film noir, \"hardboiled\" detective stories, and Hong-Kong action cinema. Max can perform rolls and leaps to try and dodge enemy fire. The weapons at his disposal range from baseball bats to Ingram sub-machine guns, grenades, Molotov cocktails, and others. A unique feature of the game is the usage of the so-called Bullet Time - a time-slowing ability that was popularized by the first Matrix movie. Activating the Bullet Time slows down everything that happens around Max (including his own movements), allowing for slow, but precise performance of moves to take care of his enemies. A special meter indicates how much time the effect will last, and how long Max needs to wait until it can be activated again.\n\nCutscenes in the game are presented as comic book-style graphical panels accompanied by voice-overs. Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne\n\nAction PlayStation 2\n\nTwo years have passed since Max Payne first embarked on his desperate quest for revenge. Returning to his former position as a detective in the New York City Police Department, Max is assigned to investigate a series of murders carried out by group of contract killers known as the Cleaners. Unexpectedly, Max encounters the enigmatic Mona Sax, whom he assumed dead. People from his past begin to return one by one, and Max gradually realizes that he did not know everything about the mysterious Circle and those who were involved in the murder of his family. Somebody out there is trying to kill Max, and he must find the answers before they succeed.\n\nMax Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a direct sequel to Max Payne. The game is very similar to its predecessor in gameplay concept and presentation, bringing back noir detective atmosphere, cinematic John Woo-style action, and cutscenes shaped like comic book panels.\n\nThe game is built on the same engine as the predecessor, with several additional special effects and enhancements, such as dynamic shadows and lighting, cubic mapped reflections, and high resolution textures. The Havok engine with ragdoll physics is used to enhance the interactivity with the game world: objects can be moved and destroyed, physically responding to the actions of the player character and opponents.\n\nA new feature in the sequel is the possibility to use two different weapons at the same time. Certain characters will join Max and fight on his side from time to time. The player also controls Mona Sax during a few stages. The Bullet Time feature from the previous game has been upgraded to version 2.0, in which Max's speed in bullet time increases as he gets more kills consecutively.\n\nDuring the first playthrough the game only offers one difficulty level. If the player struggles to succeed, the game will automatically lower the difficulty, reducing the effectiveness of enemy fire and increasing the amount of painkillers. Additional difficulty levels are unlocked when the player completes the game, as well as two new modes: New York Minute and Dead Man Walking. The first awards the player with a score for completing a level as quickly as possible, while the second has Max fighting endlessly respawning enemies. Max Payne 3\n\nAction PlayStation 3\n\nMax Payne 3 is the third main game in the series and takes place a good few years after the events of the previous entries. Following his work as a DEA agent and a New York City Police Department detective, protagonist Max Payne moves from Hoboken, New Jersey to São Paulo, Brazil. Looking for a new life and to leave his past behind, he works in a private security detail for Rodrigo Branco. When Branco's wife Fabiana is captured by a street gang during a rooftop party, Payne sets out to save her but the events quickly spiral out of control. He still drinks heavily and even though the drawn comic book panels are no longer present, the cut-scenes still incorporate the panel look and now further the story using the in-game engine with the characteristic inner dialogue voice-over and the film noir elements. Halfway through the game Payne also exchanges his typical suit or trench coat for a bearded, short-haired look wearing a shirt. Compared to the previous game and because of the location the visuals are also often much brighter.\n\nThe game is played as a third-person shooter where Payne is often outnumbered by enemies. To survive, the series' prime bullet time mechanic is essential. Activating it slows down time and it allows him to jump, dodge, shoot, and lock onto multiple enemies in succession to take them out. Its length is determined by a bar on the right that needs some time to fill up again. While in a grounded position after a jump Max stays in that position and can quickly shoot in any direction. Defeated opponents leave behind weapons that can be exchanged or be emptied for additional ammo. Multiple weapons can be collected and through a radial menu another one can be selected quickly. Payne is also able to dual-wield pistols and he uses shotguns and automatic weapons. The gameplay incorporates a cover mechanic where cover can be sought near virtually any object. From that safe position it is possible to aim and shoot, or jump out. To survive, cover needs to be used constantly and specific body parts such as head shots are often required to dispose of enemies quickly. Health is shown through an outlined figure on the right. As Max gets shot, it fills up red. To avoid dying he has to pick up and swallow painkillers that come in small supplies.\n\nCertain objects in the environment can be examined for clues and flashing buttons can be shot to open doors and gates. For cinematic effect there is a bullet camera that follows the projectile until impact. The player can manually slow down the camera and rotate, and then continue shooting. Not all of the story is told in chronological order. Some parts are played from flashbacks and next to locations such as restaurants, clubs, rooftops, docks, hotels and the favelas, there are sequences where Max shoots from a helicopter or while on a boat racing on a river. Many times cut-scenes seamlessly turn into gameplay scenes. Next to the main objectives the shooting style is rewarded through grind achievements and optional golden gun parts can be collected to form sets. The main scenario is supplemented with an arcade mode, and the New York Minute mode unlocked after completing the game once.\n\nMultiplayer is entirely new to the series. Next to regular deathmatch games it has a Gang Wars team mode based around gaining experience, using perks, defining custom loadouts, etc. The games include variants of capture-and-hold and capture-the-flag. It also incorporates the bullet time mechanic where activating it affects every opponent in the character's line-of-sight. Crews that are set up through Rockstar's Social Club environment can be carried over to different games. MDK\n\n3D Platformer PlayStation 4\n\nI first played MDK back when it was being shipped with iMacs, and was blown away by it then. This game is awesome. Period. It's like the FPS games of today, but takes up minimal space on a computer and isn't as graphics intensive. But it doesn't need to be. The environments are very well done, as are the enemies and the main character.\n\nUnlike some older FPS games, there is a great mix of puzzle and kill-everything-in-the-way. Sometimes you take on armies of robots, tanks, and spaceships. In others, you have to find how to get to the door to the next room. And while sometimes the puzzles take a bit to figure out, they aren't overbearing and the game picks up afterwards.\n\nThere are also two things that I have yet to find in other games which are present in MDK. The excellent sniper mode, which while a little slow is relatively easy to use, and the air raids. Twice in the game, you have the option of jumping into a plane and flying over fields full of angry robot aliens. And, subsequently, blowing them up. Then you can run through the field you just nuked and pick up powerups, etc. on your way to the next area.\n\nIf you have an older computer, especially an iMac, get this game. It is a classic shoot-up aliens game that although a little dated, still kicks. Together with the decent story, neat environments, and simple concept, this is a game that even today's gamers should enjoy. Not to mention that you can play the levels over and over again, and still find new little secrets and power-ups that aid you in your quest to eradicate everything in your path. It's also got this streak of bizarre weirdness (which I find refreshing in a time where these games are taken so seriously). For instance, you come into a room where all your enemies are asleep. Also, to get a huge health boost you must chase a box with feet that sounds like a monkey. And if all else fails, you can drop a cow on your enemies while snowboarding. (it really happens, trust me.)\n\nGreat old game. I highly recommend it. MDK rocks. Metal Gear\n\nMilitary & Espionage Nintendo NES 4.0 (10 votes)\n\nI love the Metal Gear Solid games that are currently on a PlayStation exclusive series.Metal Gear Solid 3 is the best game in the series yet,Metal Gear Solid 2 2nd and Metal Gear Solid third.I got my chance to play the original Metal Gear after i sold my old MGS3:Snake Eater and bought the new Subsistence edition which actually includes the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2:Solid Snake amongst other features such as special theater,secret theater and Online mode aswell as the \"Snake Eater\" game.\n\nAnyways Metal Gear is actually a good game,its the first mission Solid Snake does.He is sent to infiltrate a terrorist base under the commands of Big Boss(Big Boss is the protagonsit of MGS3).\n\nHe ultimately leads to meeting his first Metal Gear,which is called MG TX-55,aswell as finding himself infiltrating Outer Heaven.For an old 2D game from the 80`s-MG is quite a good game and I see that the newer 3D Metal Gear games are very faithful to the its roots.\n\nThe graphics are BLAH as its a goddamn 1980`s 2D game,its audio is typical,but the story and gameplay on to bad.\n\nIn the game as Snake you are not to be seen by an enemy guard,or else he will call his comrades to give you a hard time.You can use stealth,although its hard for a birdseye view game its still good to use.\n\nIts canonical sequel-Metal Gear 2:Solid Snake,which is also included in the MGS3:Subsistence package,is a much better game than MG1,its a TRUE improvement. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance\n\nAction PlayStation 3\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance is an installment in the Metal Gear series and set four years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. The gameplay is very different from most of the other games in the series, with fast-paced action gameplay similar to Platinum Games' own MadWorld or the Devil May Cry series. The protagonist is the cyborg ninja Raiden, who was previously the main character in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. After the shadow organization The Patriots was destroyed in MGS4, the various private military companies have turned into developing cyborg superhumans. Raiden is one of them, working mostly in security for PMC Maverick Securities with his colleagues Boris, Courtney, Doktor, Kevin and Sunny. During one of the assignments securing the safety of an African prime minister, the rival PMC Desperado Enterprises interferes and kills the politician. Raiden is badly damaged, but eventually returns to investigate Desperado's plans. Through different chapters Raiden has to defeat the members and various cyborgs as powerful as himself.\n\nThe gameplay is based on hack-and-slash. Raiden's primary weapon is a high-frequency blade used to string together combos based on light and heavy attacks. Later on other weapons can be acquired after defeating bosses for new attacks. Secondary weapons can be picked up for other attacks, such as rocket launchers, missiles and grenades. He can also enter a bullet time blade mode where very precise slices can be executed. This is used to target and cut off specific limbs, as well as perform a zandatsu. The latter enables him to cut off and retrieve body parts that contain digital information or items, or grab the enemy's power units that resembles a blue spine. When performed successfully, all health and fuel cells are restored. These fuel cells are required to activate the blade mode, but the bar can also be filled by collecting electrolytes from defeated enemies and through general attacks. Blade mode is also used to destroy parts of the environment or to remove an enemy's armor. In additional a ninja mode can be activated to run much faster, deflect incoming bullets and initiate other attacks such as dashes and slides. These can further be strung together by jumping into the air to continue the combo. This ninja mode is also used in the same way as in Assassin's Creed III to run, jump, slide and climb automatically over and under obstacles and buildings. Eventually the ripper mode is acquired with more power to access the blade mode.\n\nCompared to the earlier games stealth is of minor importance. Levels consist of different linear sections with some minor exploration. At certain moments it is possible to approach an enemy from behind to do a ninja kill, attack with a one-hit kill from above, or to sneak past security cameras. Later on drum cans and cardboard boxes can be used to hide as well. Raiden can also throw a photo frame to create a holographic distraction. A visor can be activated to view items chests in the environment, the next goal and the position of enemies. Many levels have cut-scenes and interactive sequences, sometimes with quick time events, that have Raiden run over bridges and walls, or hopping from one rocket to another to engage a helicopter in the air, often with over-the-top violence.\n\nWhile playing a separate menu is used to communicate with the other team members. The in-game currency consists of battle points that can be spent on new body armor, better health and fuel abilities, enhancements for weapons, and new skills that provide additional moves in general or for specific weapons. While playing hidden chests can be located to unlock up to 30 virtual reality missions that are played outside the story mode. Other hidden chests offer concept art through a collection menu. Metal Gear Solid\n\nAction & Exploration PlayStation 5.0 (62 votes)\n\nYou are Solid Snake, a super spy who is half James Bond, half Snake Plissken, and you are mean. Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy-game genre, this game is an instant classic.\n\nYour allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio, monitoring your progress, offering tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humour also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired. If you like espionage, spy movies, or just want to own and play a piece of gaming history, then this is a must-have. \"Metal Gear Solid\" is one of the all-time greats. Game tip: Secretly attach plastic explosives behind an enemy, sneak out of the room, and see what happens. --\"Allen Stewart\"\n\nSpelet som fick den mest inbitne gamern, som skulle bry sig mer om nya Mario vart uppskjutet än om vita huset, Bryssel och FN's högkvarter vart sönderbombade samma dag, att börja fundera lite i politiska banor. Välskrivet med bra röstskådisar och snyggt valda kameravinklar i sekvenserna. Måste spelas. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\n\nAll Action & Adventure PlayStation2 4.0 (172 votes)\n\nOne of the most anticipated titles in gaming history absolutely lives up to the hype. \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\" is the follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the PSone; Solid Snake, everyone's favourite mullet-sporting super-soldier, is back along with many other familiar faces and voices. While Metal Gear Solid was lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists and turns; also, like its predecessor, \"MGS2\" takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find your own solutions to its challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.\n\nKonami has replaced the moronic enemies from the first MGS with more cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has grown, both of which deepen the gameplay. This is, technically and stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. Sound is also top notch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What really makes this game such a stand-out is how all of these sight, sound, and story elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form between movie and game. It will be years before \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\" is surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest. \"--Raymond M Padilla\"\n\nDet sämre utav de två PS2 titlarna. Flummar ut lite väl i slutet och huvudrollsinnehavaren känns som ett rejält nedbyte om man gämför med Snake. Med det inte sagt att detta är ett dåligt spel. Tvärt om så är det fortfarande en av PS2:ans bästa titlar. Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance\n\nAll Action & Adventure PlayStation2 4.5 (32 votes)\n\nThere's been an awful lot of confusion about just exactly what \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance\" is. Is it a proper sequel? Is it a mission disc? Is it an Xbox exclusive? Does Snake get to go skateboarding? Well, to answer all but the last question: no. \"Substance\" is kind of similar to the \"VR Missions\" disk that was released for the original \"Metal Gear Solid\" on the PSone; however, \"Substance\" is a stand-alone title that doesn't require the original game to run--and indeed contains within it the original version of \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\".\n\nIn essence, \"Substance\" is kind of like one of those special edition, director's cut DVDs you get for films, in that it's the same old movie but with so much cool stuff layered on top it seems totally new. There's also a similarly scattershot approach to the new features, but the most obviously appealing are the chance to play through both missions as Solid Snake (or a bunch of others including Pliskin and the cyborg ninja) instead of the anaemic Raiden. Then there's a mountain of over 100 VR missions and five brand new mini-episodes for Snake to try his luck at.\n\nAny additional extras, and the answer to whether Snake really does get to do a Tony Hawk, remain secret until the final version is complete (if you're really desperate to see Solid Snake on a skateboard you might want to check out his cameo appearance in \"Evolution Skateboarding\" in the meantime) but it's impossible to imagine that if you're a \"Metal Gear\" fan you won't enjoy this. --\"David Jenkins\" Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater\n\nAll Action & Adventure PlayStation2 4.5 (173 votes)\n\nIf any one game series encapsulates the new era of the more mature video games which have emerged since the beginning of the PlayStation era, it's \"Metal Gear Solid\". Its complex narrative and equally complex and varied gameplay redefined the way people looked at video games and even if the immediate sequel managed to upset the delicate balance between storytelling and interaction, \"Metal Gear Solid 3\" doesn't look likely to make the same mistake twice.\n\nTaking a real back-to-basics approach, \"Snake Eater\" is set in the '60s and sees you controlling Solid Snake (or at least someone that looks like him--and is at least not Raiden from the \"MGS2\") in a storyline that has yet to be fully revealed.\n\nWhat we've seen of the game shows a much greater emphasis on stealth than ever before, with Snake being vastly outnumbered and appearing to spend most of his time creeping through the jungle, dropping down on guards from out of the trees and hiding in plain sight using a variety of specialised camouflage suits. The sub-title is less nonsensical than you might think as well since Snake must hunt and eat animals--including, you guessed it, our no-legged friends--to keep his stamina up.\n\nOverall the game seems more realistic than ever before (you don't even get the enemy radar to use all the time) and should assuage those jaded by \"Metal Gear Solid 2\"'s more self-indulgent moments. Snake is back, and he's never looked better... --\"David Jenkins\"\n\nLika bra som ettan men ändå olika. Här får vi en dos dåtida politik men som ändå känns aktuell. Grafiken som PS2 bjuder upp till gör att cutscensen blir än vackrare än första spelet i solid-serien. Rolig idé med klädbyten för att smälta in i olika miljöer och väl värt en omspelning bara för att uppleva helheten en gång till. Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence\n\nAll Action & Adventure PlayStation2 4.5 (7 votes)\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\nThe best Metal Gear game ever gets possibly the best director's cut ever, with a three disc special edition bursting at the seams with bonus content, including a new camera system and a completely separate online game!\n\nThe lowdown:\n\nVideo games don't often get the special edition treatment but this is the most complete celebration of Metal Gear Solid 3 you could hope for. It includes the whole of the original game, with the all new option of an over-the-shoulder camera view, which immediately makes the game a whole lot more fun to play. On top of this the package also includes the two original Metal Gear games from 1987 and 1989, which were previously only available for the MSX computer. There's also an expanded crossover with Ape Escape, a new boss rush mode and a secret theatre of joke cut scenes. It's just the thing to convert newcomers and for existing fans this will be like all of their Christmases come early.\n\nMost exciting moment:\n\nThe most anticipated new extra in the game is an entirely new online game with a suite of five different game modes, as you and up to seven pals compete in standard single and team deathmatch games as well as more stealth based missions. The slower paced modes work particularly well, allowing you to use all the skills you've mastered in the single player game.\n\nSince you ask:\n\nExistence, the third disc in the set, contains all the game's cut scenes, plus some new ones, edited into a three and a half hour long feature film. It was only available with pre-orders of the game in America but comes as standard in the UK.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nThe best version of the best Metal Gear Solid. - \"HARRISON DENT\" Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots\n\nPLAYSTATION 3 5.0 (15 votes)\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots\", is a next-gen experience complete with top-of-the-line graphics and surround sound designed for the Sony PlayStation 3. Featuring the most revealing display of Kojima Production's premier title, \"MSG4\" details the world where Snake must under go his final mission. In a world overrun by private military companies (PMCs), wars are no longer fought over nations or ideologies. Instead, the wars of the future are micro-managed by overarching PMCs, right down to the bullet. New gadgets and abilities fuel Snake's journey deep into the enemy domains of the Middle East, South America, and beyond. New gear includes \"Metal Gear Mk. II,\" the ultimate reconnaissance tool, and \"Solid Eye,\" which gives Snake real-time information on enemies and his surroundings.\n\n\"Old timer Snake returns for what is slated as the final installment in the \"Metal Gear\" series.\"\n\n\"New and old characters abound in \"MGS4\".\"\n\n\"PMCs have run amok and the world is at war.\"\n\n\"Octacamo will help Snake blend into surroundings. View larger.\" Joined by a familiar cast of characters, Snake must once again return to the battlefield to confront his lifelong rival, Liquid Ocelot, who is manipulating the world's wars from the one world where soldiers will always have a place. But Liquid Ocelot is not the only one who will be able to manipulate the world's wars--Snake can destabilize opposing forces by working behind the scenes, supporting the local militia as they fight PMCs, creating a smokescreen that allows Snake to move freely within the war-zone.\n\nMGS4 is a next-generation adventure set in the aftermath of \"MGS2: Sons of Liberty\". The concept behind the latest \"Metal Gear Solid\" project is \"no place to hide,\" and this edition in the series will force Snake into unexpected circumstances with an all-new storyline that breaks away in some ways from the previous \"MGS\" franchise entries. We don't want to spoil it for you, but, producer Hideo Kojima did reveal some very juicy bits about the game and the storyline when it was first announced at E3 of 2006. \"Until now,\" said Kojima, \"we've released two entries of the \"MSX2 Metal Gear\" series, and three entries in the \"Metal Gear Solid\" series. Add to this \"Portable Ops\", and you get a total of six titles. All mysteries will be cleared up in \"Metal Gear Solid 4\".\"\n\nKojima was very clear about the finality of \"MSG4\", leaving gamers to wonder, \"Will Snake die?!\" When asked if the story will come to this sort of an end, Kojima responded without the slightest bit of vagueness, \"It will come to an end.\" The \"MGS4\" E3 trailer showed a number of characters from the \"Metal Gear\" and \"Metal Gear Solid\" histories. This final instalment is sure to deliver loads of cameos, in fact, it is rumoured that nearly all the characters from the series will make an appearance.\n\nIn addition to a return of classic \"Metal Gear Solid\" characters, the gameplay systems from part three are also expected to make a comeback. The camouflage system from part three will make it into \"MGS4\", with the addition of \"OctoCamo,\" Snake's most advanced stealth suit to date. The name appears to be formed from the words \"Octopus\" and \"camouflage,\" and players will be awestruck by the chameleon-like camo that changes with the surroundings. OctoCamo allows Snake to blend in with his environment as it digitally manifests nearby textures in real time. Think if it this way, if Snake is standing next to a wall worn out with holes, he too will appear to be riddled with holes. It has also been revealed that \"MGS4\" will have online play, but no specifics have been released. Although very little information is known about the game's visuals, rumour has it that \"MGS4\" is expected to be the finest representation of console graphics on the PS3, and it is expected that they will just get better and better as the game nears its release date. Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes\n\nAction & Adventure GameCube 4.5 (37 votes)\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid\", one of the most prestigious of all PlayStation game series, is now playable on GameCube. Owners of Nintendo's console will no doubt be celebrating already--with good reason, too. Essentially, \"Twin Snakes\" is an updated version of the original \"Metal Gear Solid\" PlayStation outing. A new graphics engine--which is every bit as impressive as that of the PS2's \"Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty\"--brings the original action bang up to date.\n\nWhile the storyline in \"Twin Snakes\" adheres closely to the original's, the way in which it is told is markedly improved: the original voiceover cast has re-recorded every conversation in the game, giving \"Twin Snakes\" a fresh take on a finely weaved plot of intrigue. A first-person perspective is introduced for those who wish to really soak up the Cold War atmosphere, while new cutscenes complete what is a comprehensive makeover for this legendary adventure.\n\nGameplay is as sharp and intuitive as ever: Solid Snake is one super sleuth, his repertoire of actions is considerable, and controlling those actions is perfectly straightforward. It's a good job, really: the quality of the Artificial Intelligence means that precise control is vital if Snake is to halt the nuclear war that is afoot. Thanks in no small part to its AI, \"Twin Snakes\" has an atmosphere that is wonderfully intense--for late-night gaming, this really is video-game perfection. --\"Jonti Davies\"\n\nOrginalet är bättre och så är det. Regiserat av en action regisör och det märks. Det blir näst intill humorisitiskt när Snake hoppar upp, gör en volt och sedan kickar till en missil så att den ändrar riktning. Metroid Fusion\n\nAction & Adventure Game Boy Advance 4.5 (24 votes)\n\nAfter an absence of almost eight years, Samus Arran is finally back in \"Metroid Fusion\" battling evil in a brand new 2-D arcade adventure that's one of the best GBA games so far.\n\nTaking its cue from the SNES game \"Super Metroid\", this all-new title starts with Samus infected by the evil X parasites and battling to rid a space station of their menace. Part platform game, part shoot-'em-up and part RPG, the \"Metroid\" games are some of the most revered in all gaming history.\n\nWith a gameplay not unlike that of the newer \"Castlevania\" games (although \"Metroid\" did it all first), \"Metroid Fusion\" forces you to explore the huge space station as you slowly regain your various bounty hunting powers. The game includes all the old \"Metroid\" power-ups, including the morph ball and screw attack and plenty of other new gadgets. There's also the chance to practise your wall bounce, which must rank as one of the most difficult yet satisfying moves to pull off ever in a video game. Another nice new twist is that all the enemies are infected by X parasites, so when you shoot them the parasites just fly off and infect another creature unless you catch them first.\n\nAs good as the game is, though, it's not as perfectly designed as its forebear--there's far too much dull story line and the game is (perhaps by necessity on a portable console) more linear than before. But even these slight foibles might be seen as positives by some, making this a game no-one will want to miss. --\"David Jenkins\"\n\nNintendo återanvänder som vanligt gamla idér och lägger till lite nytt. Men vad gör det när det görs så här snyggt. Metroid Prime\n\nAction & Adventure GameCube 4.5 (100 votes)\n\nThe promise of mature gaming on the GameCube finally comes from a top quality release courtesy of Nintendo itself. Get ready to shoot, jump and puzzle your way through \"Metroid Prime\", the creepiest, coolest GameCube game yet.\n\nAs difficult to pigeonhole as its predecessors, \"Metroid Prime\" is not, despite what the first person viewpoint might suggest, just a shoot-'em-up. Containing as much platform jumping and puzzle solving as shooting, the game is more like an action-based version of \"Zelda\" than any one-note \"Doom\" clone.\n\nAs usual the game stars bounty hunter Samus Aran (perhaps gaming's only female character that isn't scantily clad) in her ongoing battle to contain the freaky jellyfish-like metroids. To do this she must explore and search every nook and cranny of the game world, not just for ways to uncover the plot but for upgrades to her super-cool armoured battle suit. These range from obvious things such as new weapons and gadgets like an infra-red visor to a grappling hook and the hugely satisfying morph ball, which allows you to turn into a giant metal ball bearing and explore previously inaccessible areas.\n\nApart from its uniquely involving gameplay \"Metroid Prime\" also features some of the best graphics ever seen on a home console. What's more, they aren't just used in a soulless technical demo; they're used to create a creepy and totally immersive atmosphere unrivalled by any other title. As an added bonus, \"Metroid Prime\" connects to the Game Boy Advance title \"Metroid Fusion\" to unlock a hidden costume and the complete version of the original \"Metroid\" game for the NES. All in all, this is likely to be one of the best games you'll find for some time. -- \"David Jenkins\"\n\nRetro Studios gör Metroid till 3D och med det även lite mer hardcore. Spelet tvingar en att kommaihåg platser och att utforska miljöer ordentligt. Grym bandesign men inte ett spel för alla. Grafiken måste ses och var när spelet släpptes fantastisk. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\n\nAction & Adventure GameCube 4.5 (26 votes)\n\nFor many, \"Metroid Prime\" remains the best GameCube game yet released. In many ways an atypical Nintendo title, with its first person adventuring and a dark sci-fi setting, the game was still full of the classic Nintendo magic with amazing graphics, perfect controls and incredible attention to detail.\n\nThis new sequel expands on all these aspects as Samus Arran (perhaps the only non-gratuitous - considering she spends the entirety of the game in a big metal space suit - female character in video games) explores the planet Aether, which is mysteriously split between light and dark dimensions, with unique weapons and equipment only work in one or the other. This adds an extra layer of intricacy to the gameplay and storyline and also provides a prime excuse for lots more weapons, gadgets and visors (the sound based echo visor is particularly cool). Perhaps the most controversial new feature in the game though is a four-person multiplayer mode where you can use all of the game's power-ups and weapons. This actually works surprisingly well with the switch to a morph ball making it impossible to lock onto an enemy automatically, greatly adding to the tactical depth. It is the single player mode that is \"Metroid Prime 2\"'s most important aspect though and there seems little chance that fans of the original will be disappointed. Those that felt the original was a little too hard and difficult to control will be catered for as well though, ensuring that this game is far more accessible than the previous one. --\"David Jenkins\"\n\nMörkervärden är ofta jobbig och man vill gärna att de partierna ska vara över fort. Annars lika bra som ettan. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\n\nNintendo Wii 5.0 (29 votes)\n\nIf you think you knew what it felt like to be the bounty hunter behind the visor, think again. The Galactic Federation?s network computer, Aurora Unit, is suddenly and completely corrupted with something like a virus. The Federation believes Space Pirates may be behind the problem and are soon attacked. Samus and other hunters leap to their defense only to find that the enemy they face is Dark Samus, armed with immense power that no one can withstand.\n\nPlayers control Samus by moving with the Nunchuk and aiming with the Wii Remote allowing for a level of immersion unlike anything they have ever experienced. Through the eyes of Samus, players experience a quantum leap in first-person control as they wield the Wii Remote, the ultimate device for the first-person shooter genre. Samus will employ well-known power-ups like the Grapple Beam and Morph Ball, as well as a bunch of new surprises, to help her survive her coming trials.\n\nThe game also incorporates a new system involving Phazon. If you fill Samus' Phazon supply to a certain level, Samus will temporarily go into hyper mode, a state in which she can pull off incredible feats. On the flip side, if she exceeds the maximum Phazon level, she'll perish. Also, for the first time in the Metroid series, Samus' ship will be used in active game play.\n\nMer linjärt än de två tidigare spelen. Större delar av handlingem berättas med sekvenser som ibland känns lite billiga men all scaning finns kvar för hardcore liraren. Lättare än tidigare spel men också ett spel för casualspelaren som vill känna på lite utav Metroid-universumet. Metroid: Other M\n\nAction Wii 71\n\nMetoid: Other M follows recent console releases of Metroid games by being developed, like the Metroid Prime trilogy, by a studio outside of Nintendo. This time, rather than being handed to what, at the time, was a rookie studio, Metriod: Other M has been developed by veteran developer Team Ninja, notable for Dead or Alive and the Ninja Gaiden series.\n\nOther M takes place, chronologically, after the events of Super Metroid, and before the events of Metroid Fusion. After a recuperation introduction, and a cinematic retelling of the final moments of Super Metroid, the game begins with Samus intercepting and investigating a distress call. The call comes from a space station (much like Metroid Fusion) that is in trouble. Samus meets up with her old military commander, Adam Malkovich and joins his team of Federation soldiers as they investigate the distressed station. Per the gameplay story, Samus is largely considered to already have many of her suit's abilities (such as missiles and bombs) in tact, but doesn't use them until Adam gives the authorization.\n\nThe game features a return to the side-scrolling gameplay of classic 2-D Metroid games, but in a hybrid form which also includes first-person shooter segments (utilized simply by pointing the Wii Remote at the television), and even 3rd-person “over the shoulder” segments for very small rooms. Targeting enemies is typically just a matter of aiming in the right direction, and specific shots are automatic in 2-D mode. In first-person mode, Samus can lock on to enemies to fire missiles. The Morph Ball returns, as expected, and operates in a similar manner to the popular Metroid Prime titles, with the camera zoomed in extremely close in tight environments. The over-the-shoulder 3rd-person view is mostly used for exploration of small rooms, and not combat. The game is played using only the Wii Remote without the Nun-chuck accessory.\n\nAs a staple of the series, Samus can again build up her armaments and weapons by collecting items found by exploring the game. This is in addition to the plot device that she doesn't use anything until authorized.\n\nNew to the franchise is ample use of cinematic cut-scenes, which are used to tell the back story of Samus, her past with Adam Malkovich, and her former military association. Also, rare for a Nintendo title, is ample spoken dialog from the title character--both in cinematics and story sequences, as well as monologues detailing Samus' perceptions and feelings through the story.\n\nFor the first time, Samus Aran’s overall agility is more in-line with her Super Smash Bros form than most previous Metroid titles and her combat catalog now includes finishing moves, dodges, and grapple attacks. All the new moves are designed around simplicity and speed--sometimes operating automatically if the right button is held--and the game’s combat has the arcade-intense feel of Team Ninja’s more recent Ninja Gaiden titles.\n\nPre-ordered copies of the game came bundled with an “Art Folio” containing sixteen cards featuring artwork from the game, with descriptions printed on the back. The cards are roughly the same size and shape of a DVD case. Mirror's Edge\n\nAction PlayStation 3\n\nMirror's Edge is a first-person action game set in a dystopian society ruled by a totalitarian regime that exercises a high amount of surveillance on citizens. The city has a clean look, with bright cold tone visuals that are mainly white with hints of orange. Players control Faith, a female runner who transfers information by moving over the roofs of the city as all other forms of communication are monitored. She grew up alone in the streets when her mother died during the November Riots and her father deserted her shortly after. She was taught as a little girl by a man called Mercury, who caught her breaking in and was impressed with her skills. Hunted down by a government agents, she needs to find a way to free her sister.\n\nBased on the principles of parkour, the focus is on the freedom of movement. Although the game path is largely linear, the controls are largely context-sensitive and she needs to string up moves to build up a fluid flow of movement, by running up walls, sliding below fences, or by jumping, vaulting or climbing, using pipes, ramps or using objects as zip-lines. The emphasis on movement is enhanced through the camera, which spins, or bobs up and down according to the speed, and the prominent visibility of her arms, legs and torso. The game is also largely HUDless. When Faith is hurt, the city's colours desaturate. To assist the player in this fast-paced movement, the game applies Runner Vision where environmental pieces are highlighted when they occur to Faith as possible escape routes. In complex situations, Reaction Time, a form of bullet time, can be applied to slow down the pace without losing momentum.\n\nEven though Faith generally needs to run from agents who chase her on foot or from helicopters, she can attack them using melee combat, or disarm agents to grab and wield their weapons. The game takes place both outside, and inside buildings and there are ten chapters in total. The story is furthered through animated films between the missions, not using the game engine. Next to the main story mode, there is a time attack mode with portions of levels and the fastest times are shown as red runners who act as ghosts. While playing, hidden messenger bags can be collected to unlock extras. Mirror's Edge: Catalyst\n\nPlatform game PlayStation 4\n\nFollow Faith, a daring free runner, as she fights for freedom in the city of Glass.\n\nWhat appears to be an elegant, high-tech city on the outside, has a terrible secret hidden within. Explore every corner from the highest beautifully lit rooftops to the dark and gritty tunnels below. The city is huge, free to roam and Faith is at the center of it all. Through the first-person perspective, combine her fluid movement and advanced combat with the city’s surroundings to master the environment and uncover the conspiracy. This is Mirror’s Edge for this generation, raising the bar in action-adventure games.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• First-Person Action — Get up close with your enemies. Use your freedom of movement and martial arts combat in conjunction with the environment to experience fluid first-person action unlike any other.\n\n• Explore the City of Glass — Roam the beautiful, high-tech city at your own pace, and unlock its many different districts. Run free and explore every corner from the highest, glass made skyscrapers to the hidden underground tunnels.\n\n• Witness the Rise of Faith – Brought up on her own on the margin of the totalitarian society, Faith found refuge amongst an outsider group called the Runners. Learn about her origin story, and take part in her journey as she stands up against oppression and becomes the catalyst that can change the City of Glass forever. ModNation Racers\n\nAction PlayStation 3 4.2\n\nModNation Racers is a mix of the kart racing aspect of Mario Kart and the customization of LittleBigPlanet. The player starts out as a up and comer by the name of T.A.G. in the MRC (ModNation Racing Championship) series with his mother as a sponsor and a washed-out racer for a crew chief, meeting various interesting characters, both good and bad, through his ballooning career. The initial race gets the player acquainted with the controls and some aspects of the game including weapons such as rockets, sonic weapons, lightning weapons and boost power-ups. These weapons can be picked up by item pods scattered throughout the track and each weapon has three levels which starts out at level one and will upgrade for each item pod picked up. After the initial race, the player will be directed to the ModSpot, the central hub for MNR for players to get together.\n\nAt the ModSpot the player is introduced to the creation aspect of the game, using the creation station the player can modify their racers and karts. The player can unlock more items through the career mode by winning matches and completing certain challenges such as taking down three opponents, activate three traps, etc. They can also pick up tokens scattered on each track (five tokens for each track in total) and using them at a vending machine and like a slot machine, picking either 1 token, 2 tokens or 5 tokens and randomly getting an item depending upon the tokens used.\n\nPlayers can also create their own tracks using various tools to sculpt the landscape to their liking and create their ultimate dream track. The players can share their creations with the world by publishing them, using a share center they can upload their created racers, karts and tracks and likewise download other players creations as well. Also at the ModSpot the player can view the Top Mod and Top Karts of the week, see who is in the current room, view to players of the week, enter the creation studios and even set up races with friends on official tracks or custom tracks by players. Monster Hunter\n\nOther Strategy PlayStation2 4.0 (6 votes)\n\nA well defined world, well designed environment plus realistic but yet fantasy creatures... welcome to the world of Monster Hunters!! It is a great game not just because of its superb game play, but also for maybe the first time, a player need not to be tied to a faction or carry a heavy burden on their shoulder to save the world (or some one), the aim is simple, take a mission (contract) and be famous! The game does not rely on gore nor violence, some of the missions are actually...cute. You do not kill to complete the missions, as a matter of fact, some missions require you to capture monsters, this gives the game a whole new level of depth. I played this game, loved it, recommended my boss's wife who has problems with their kids over playing games and addicted to bloody games, she loved it as her kids now no longer want to play violence filled, blood spilling games anymore. What to say? This game is definately addicting but due to time constrains of each mission, enforces a certain level of self constrain. Highly recommended, if I can, I'd rate it 6 stars!!! Mortal Kombat XL\n\nAction PlayStation 4\n\nMortal Kombat X is the tenth main game in the one-on-one fighting series and a sequel to the 2011 title Mortal Kombat, which was a complete reboot of the series. The plot is set about 20 years after the events of the previous game where the ending revealed that Shinnok used the void after Shao Kahn's death to attack Earthrealm with his army of Netherrealm forces. Several characters work together to steal Shinnok's amulet and imprison him inside, but eventually Mileena hatches a plan to release Shinnok by bringing the amulet to Quan Chi who escaped when Shinnok was imprisoned. The gap in years is mainly used to introduce the new characters to the cast, such as Cassie, the daughter of Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade (who married and divorced), Kotal Kahn as the new emperor of the Outworld, and Takeda, the son of Kenshi.\n\nThe game stays close to the visual style and the mechanics of the 2011 reboot. The main controls are still based on two types of punches and kicks, and blocking, to form combos with uppercuts, teleports, special moves that incorporate weapons and fatalities. The three-tiered energy from the previous title returns, making available X-Ray moves, powered up EX moves and combo breakers. As introduced in Injustice: Gods Among Us by the same developer characters can use the environment to re-position themselves or optionally use parts as weapons. Each character now has three variations with different moves and weapons. There is once again a sprinting gauge, returning from Mortal Kombat 4.\n\nThe trademark fatalities finishing moves are expanded with new types of finishers. Multiplayer games have quitalities where a character is immediately killed when a player leaves an online game prematurely and faction kills that are finishers tied to one of the game's five factions. Brutality finishing moves return from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as powerful versions of moves that can be used at certain moments to link a combo into a finisher right away.\n\nThe recurring cast includes Ermac, Jax, Johnny Cage, Kano, Kenshi, Kitana, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Mileena, Quan Chi, Raiden, Reptile, Scorpion, Shinnok, Sonya Blade and Sub-Zero. New playable characters are Cassie Cage, D'Vorah, Erron Black, Ferra/Torr, Jacqui Briggs, Kotal Kahn, Kung Jin and Takeda. There are 24 characters in total. Additional ones such as Goro, Jason Voorhees, Predator, Tanya and Tremor are either offered as DLC, appear as guest characters, or both. Baraka, Rain and Sindel appear in the story mode, but are not playable.\n\nNext to the main Story mode there is King of the Hill, ranked matches, Survivor and Test Your Luck where fights have random round parameters. The Towers as challenges return, but now with play conditions that change constantly in the Living Towers. The online game has a persistent game mode called Faction Wars where players choose one of five factions (Black Dragon, the Brotherhood of Shadow, the Lin Kuei, Special Forces, and White Lotus) to fight in constant, cross-platform competitions to become the ruling faction. Competing in the Faction Wars is rewarded with a personal and faction-based leveling system, a currency, and the aforementioned faction kills. More outrageous types of fights such as one-versus-two or very difficult boss fights do not return from the previous game. Koins are the main currency in the game. They can be used to acquire secondary fatalities, brutalities, concept art, character skins and more. These are bought in the first-person dungeon crawling Krypt mode, returning from the previous game."
