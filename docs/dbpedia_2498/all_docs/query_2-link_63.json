        "text": "Mortal wounds, deadly dismemberments, and broken hearts are ubiquitous within the world of Arthurian text and image. Yet this collection is the first extensive study of the way such scenes of death are represented and interpreted. The editors admit that the potential scope of their subject was so large that they chose to devote their volume to the English tradition, which they limit to the Arthurian works produced in Britain and America (2). In keeping with these parameters, this collection begins with the Latin histories and English romances of medieval Britain and ends with the Arthuriana of Victorian and postwar England, twentieth-century America, and modern film. The resulting volume is a provocative array of analyses of the various incarnations of Arthurian death, ranging from the violent vocabulary of Geoffrey of Monmouth to the knightly obituaries in the marginalia of the Winchester Manuscript of Malory's Morte D'Arthur to the cinematic treatments of Arthur's demise.\n\nOrganized chronologically, the collection is divided into three parts. The first section, 'The Early Tradition in England,' which focuses primarily on the deaths of Arthur and Mordred in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britannie and the vernacular romances it inspired, contains two of the most valuable contributions of the volume. Flouting optimistic readings of Arthur's return, Si√¢n Echard meticulously examines Geoffrey's brief treatment of Arthur's end within the narrative's larger lexicon of violence to argue that he 'dies plainly, because that is what kings usually do' (31). This demystification of Arthur is continued by Edward Donald Kennedy's [End Page 111] comparative survey of the fate of Mordred's sons, which highlights the cruelty of Arthur's dying command that they be 'slongen in watyrs' in the Alliterative Morte Arthure (41).\n\nAs its title suggests, the second section, 'Middle English Romance and Malory,' is dominated by Malorian studies that address the thematic connections between love and death, the scribal listings of dead knights in the margins of the Winchester Manuscript, chivalric interpretations of corpses, the perversion of the body politic on Salisbury Plain, and the closure that scenes of Arthurian death resist. A particularly welcome contribution is Thomas H. Crofts' brief essay, in which he characterizes the Winchester scribes' marginal naming of the fallen knights, Harleus and Peryne, as 'corrigenda' (123) of their inexplicable reappearance later in the narrative. Moving from the margins to the tales themselves, Michael Wenthe convincingly suggests that the corpses that litter Malory's text are often 'legible'; that is, they invite interpretations from the characters who encounter them (129). A strange bedfellow of these Malorian studies, Michael W. Twomey's essay on Sir Gawain and the Green Knight nevertheless offers a persuasive challenge to post-Robertsonian neglect of Gawain's spirituality by contextualizing the threat of his dismemberment within contemporary anxieties about the fragmentation of the body and the fate of the soul after death.\n\nThe last section, 'Medieval Influence and Modern Arthuriana,' is a fascinating miscellany that includes a taxonomy of death scenes, a condemnatory reading of Tennyson's linkage of women and death, an examination of Arthurian death and duty for American boys, a call for scholarly attention to David Jones' 'Malory of the trenches' (227), and a listing of Arthur's death scenes in film. The most widely useful essay of the collection is Janina P. Traxler's 'Arthurian Exits,' which offers a breakdown of the deaths of major figures and even a helpful chart of the various versions of Arthur's end (170-1). In another noteworthy contribution, Julie Nelson Couch argues that Howard Pyle fashions an unredeemable Lancelot, whose neglect of duty and dishonorable death are part of a cautionary tale well-suited for the tastes of middle-class American boys in the early twentieth century.\n\nThis volume teems with stimulating studies, but at times the topics appear to be too unwieldy to address within the confines of this collection..."
