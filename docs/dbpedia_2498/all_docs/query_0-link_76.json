        "text": "Sometimes, the big bad or the goody two shoes not only need to have the big sword or the big gun, sometimes they need to have the big talk to go along with it. Insults and threats over even a good taunt might send an enemy running in a mad fury to mess with them, leading to their demise. So what good insult, threat or taunt have been spoken by game characters?\n\nI think that the Demoman from Team Fortress 2 has some good threats and insults from his dominations on his opponents. Geez the stuff this guys says and he even got more lines afterwards as well in updates. This example is just one of the many lines his throws out at the other team:\n\n\"I'm gonna stick me thumbs in your eyes and hang on til' you're dead!!\"-Demoman\n\nYeah...he means business. and you can listen to the many other things he says down below:\n\n\"You fight like a dairy farmer.\"\n\n\"How appropriate. You fight like a cow.\"\n\n\"You make me want to puke.\"\n\n\"You make me think somebody already did.\"\n\n\"There are no words for how disgusting you are.\"\n\n\"Yes there are. You just never learned them.\"\n\n\"Nobody's ever drawn blood from me and nobody ever will.\"\n\n\"You run THAT fast?\"\n\nMonkey Island was an utterly brilliant game.\n\n\"Were your parents related before they were married?\"- Conker from Conker's Bad Fur Day.\n\nCan't remember any others from that game.\n\nTheMigrantSoldier said:\n\nDawn of War: Dark Crusade is chock full of them. Gorgutz wins the prize.\n\nMacabee: We are your end, alien.\n\nWarlord Gorgutz: If ya mean the end of me pointy stick, I?m right there wiff ya. Hah!\n\nI hope Gorgutz makes appearences in new games, he was great comical relief in a grimdark universe.\n\n(spoilers I'm sure if you listen to that all the way through, but the first part I linked it too isn't anything special)\n\nbut honestly, as much as I hated handsome jack, he had some amazing audio bits throughout the whole game, definitely made the story lots of fun even on single player.\n\nthe villain that you love to hate.\n\nI was playing Mists of Pandaria for the first time yesterday - I know, I'm late to that party.\n\nIt seems to be a mixture of Kung-Fu Panda and the Karate Kid.\n\nBut early on I headed into a village that was under siege by monkeys. Apparently they were after the pandas' precious brew and were stealing it, getting drunk and attacking people (mug still in hand).\n\nI arrived in the village and the first thing I saw was a panda do a smackdown on one of these brew-thieving monkeys and then shouted \"TAKE THAT MONKEY BUTT\".\n\nI see I have bought a 'very serious' game."
