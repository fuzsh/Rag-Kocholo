A good sidekick can bring out the best in a hero. Whether it's providing support in combat, some light comedic relief, or unwavering moral guidance, they're able to make a protagonist's journey a little easier or at least more enjoyable.

Designers seem to take more creative license with their tag-along characters, resulting in some bizarre and zany personalities that can overshadow their more straight-laced protagonists. These 10 sidekicks are the weirdest partners gaming's ever seen.
