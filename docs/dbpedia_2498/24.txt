Special delivery for our sprites

This week, we were delighted to send these spectacular Safe In Our World Sidekick Journals out to our sprites!

The Video Games Mental Health Journal by our friends Safe In Our World is packed with practical mindfulness techniques and gaming-inspired mental health prompts to nourish creativity and promote wellness. It’s been lovingly crafted to be the perfect ‘sidekick’ for any gamer.

Safe in our World is a video games mental health charity on a mission to foster worldwide mental health awareness within the video game industry. The charity has a vision of “a global games industry where every business treats mental health with equal importance and respect, and everyone feels they can speak out” and “a world where video game communities are free from prejudice and stigma, where every player feels safe.”

Firesprite became a Level Up Mental Health partner in 2021, and we’re thrilled to support the invaluable work that Safe In Our World do to promote mental wellbeing throughout the industry. We absolutely love our new Sidekicks! 💖
