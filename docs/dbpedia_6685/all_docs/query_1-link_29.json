        "text": "We honor the trailblazers who have left an indelible mark on our society through their leadership and commitment to improving lives, and as we celebrate Black History Month, i. Bernard J. Tyson, healthcare executive extraordinaire and former CEO of Kaiser Permanente, the first African-American to have this role, was one such visionary leader whose legacy continues to inspire us. Dr. Tyson, who sadly passed away much too soon, was a steadfast advocate for equitable healthcare, believing in the power of action when action has to happen no matter the obstacles. \"Don't ask for permission to help improve the lives of the people in the communities you're pledged to serve, but instead march through the doors of red tape, make bold moves and usher in access.\" - Bernard J. Tyson Tyson's leadership was not just about managing one of the largest healthcare providers in the U.S.; it was about challenging the status quo, breaking down barriers to healthcare access, and ensuring that every individual, regardless of their background, had the opportunity to lead a healthy life. His approach to leadership‚Äîmarked by boldness, compassion, and unwavering dedication to community service‚Äîserves as a beacon for all of us. In remembering Bernard J. Tyson during Black History Month, let's not only reflect on his contributions but also embody his ethos in our actions. Let us be inspired to make bold moves, challenge red tape, and tirelessly work to improve the lives of those in our communities. His legacy is a reminder that leadership is about much more than titles or accolades; it's about making a tangible difference in the lives of others. #Leadership #BlackHistoryMonth #BernardJTyson #Healthcare #Innovation #CommunityService\n\nThe concept of doing well by doing good was started in #Philadelphia (or was at least perfected here). I'm happy to say this idea is alive & well and shared by several of our regions premier employers still today. Today, The Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia convened CEOs and executive leaders to discuss: 1) The ‚Äúfatigue‚Äù associated with constantly focusing on achieving your goals and being the best at what you do. 2) Your ability to create a positive impact on your employees, clients, community & the world (and the return it can have on your organization). 3) The art of staying focused. We shared several strategies on how to focus on your core competencies while constantly injecting innovation and process improvement. Thank you to Keith DiMarino (DocuVault & GenVault) for kicking off today's conversation, and thank you to our participants: Rev. Dr. Lorina Marshall-Blake (Independence Blue Cross) - Leslie Walker (Philadelphia 76ers) - Rudolph M. (Impact Health) - Kevin Ryan (Citrin Cooperman) - Tony Miller (Janney Montgomery Scott LLC) - Mike Dershowitz (FTO - Fair Trade Outsourcing) - Patricio Almuina (Braskem) - Amelia Schmertz (Settlement Music School) - Peter Haabestad (Guardian Capital Partners) and Russ Starke (Think Company) - #CSR #Impact\n\nShe said, \"You just need to keep proving yourself to these people, LaQuoia\"üëÄ I still remember the feeling I got the first time I mustered up enough courage to speak to Amanager about the challenges of leading as a Black Woman in the pharmacy department at Novant Health. It was like a gut punchüòØ Wait, you mean after checking all the boxes, getting the licenses and certifications, experiences in multiple states and multiple practice settings, I STILL needed to prove myself to \"these people.\" ü§¨ü•¥ Yep! Black Students, Don't be fooled by the Okie Doke! Everyone smiling in your face is not your friend and you cannot \"outdegree\" racism! üëâüèæ Tonight, I will help you understand how to tell the difference between a Co-worker, a Colleague, and a Friend! üëâüèæ Tonight, I will help you understand the difference between Constructive Criticism vs. Constructive Racism vs. Constructive Feedback. üëâüèæ Tonight, I will help you understand what resources you will need to succeed mentally, physically, and emotionally in environments that were never designed for you. üëâüèæ Tonight, I will show you what it means to live up to the Pharmacist Oath, overcome the obstacles, and leverage your skills and God given talents to serve your communities. PS...Can't attend LIVE, no worries! Register before tonight to receive access to the LIVE Re-play. Auntie, Quoia got you! Grace & Peace, Dr. LaQuoia ü•∞ #Graceculture #pharmacist #leadershipconsulting #betterleaders\n\nThank you Digiday for covering this important topic! Change is only possible through intervention and we have to do better. Thank you Antoinette S. for the excellent write-up. Michael Burgi for moderating and my fellow panelist Sherine P. and Albert Thompson please give it a read! \"Glay started the session citing some disappointing statistics about where Black and Brown people stand in corporate America. ‚ÄúWhen you think about corporate senior management, less than 4% are actually Black and Brown folks,‚Äù he ticked off, adding that less than 2% of entrepreneurs and founders are Black. (A Brookings report confirms that percentage.)\" Glay also argued that when we are talking about multicultural marketing ‚Äì a term he doesn‚Äôt particularly like ‚Äì remember that it‚Äôs about marketing to human beings at the end of the day. It does not have to be tied to ethnic culture alone when we are thinking about diverse media investments. ‚ÄúBecause marketing is about reaching people at the intrinsic level,‚Äù Glay said. ‚ÄúWe all consume media, right? It goes back to fundamental marketing, which is about reaching people and then translating them. There are things we all have, shared common interests.‚Äù https://lnkd.in/divUnnSa\n\nI recently had the great pleasure of joining a panel at the Black Corporate Directors Conference to talk about the importance of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in the corporate world, particularly in the healthcare industry. The Conference serves as a dynamic forum for African-American and Hispanic/Latino directors at Fortune 500 companies to come together and have meaningful discussions about minority representation across all sectors. At Pfizer, equity is one of our core values, and we constantly strive to maintain a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. We do so because it‚Äôs the right thing to do‚Äîthe human thing to do. But it‚Äôs also a smart business strategy, as research shows that DEI has beneficial impacts on business results. For example, the World Economic Forum found that companies that are DEI leaders have up to 20% higher rates of innovation than market average. Nowhere is equity more important than in the area of healthcare. As the leader of a major healthcare company, I see it as my responsibility to help drive important and lasting changes that close gaps in health equity. That is why my teams are working hard to remove barriers to access and representation in R&D and in clinical trials, and to build trust in minority and undeserved/underrepresented communities. Equity doesn‚Äôt mean giving everyone the same thing. It means working to level the playing field for everyone‚Äîfrom corporate offices to doctors‚Äô offices, and everywhere in between. Together we can create a better future for patients from all backgrounds.\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to support DEI initiatives across Corporate America, ELC President & CEO Michael Hyter will speak at the 2024 National Urban League Conference on today's panel, \"DEI: IS IT THE FUTURE?\" moderated by Ed Gordon. Learn more: https://lnkd.in/edvNhc8X The backlash has been fierce. Just a few short years after national outrage over the murder of George Floyd prompted corporate America to reevaluate its commitment to DEI and pledge change, a political ‚Äúwar on woke‚Äù is pushing employers to abandon the policy of inclusion. The chill is also being felt in college admissions offices. Is DEI on the way out, or has its demise been greatly exaggerated? Today's session offers a clear look at today‚Äôs DEI landscape and strategies for maintaining institutional focus on equity and opportunity for all. Speakers Kristy Williams Fercho, Senior EVP-Diverse Segments, Representation, and Inclusion (DSRI), Wells Fargo Damon Todd Hewitt, President and Executive Director, Lawyers‚Äô Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Henry Beecher Hicks III, President and CEO, National Black MBA Association Jennifer Hunter, SVP Corporate Citizenship and Chief Sustainability Officer, Altria Steve Washington, Station Manager, Delta Air Lines, Inc., New Orleans, LA (MSY) Dr. Homer L. Wilkes, Under Secretary Natural Resources and Environment, USDA #DEIAtStake #NUL #BlackExecutives #CorporateAmerica Read our latest report, which identifies the best ways to improve DEI across Corporate America: https://lnkd.in/eMGRzqVB\n\n\"Excited to share insights from my recent presentation at the HBA Ambassador cohort Short Talk, where I explored 'The Art of Magical Thinking' through the lens of 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' by Stephen Covey. üåü üöÄ Here's a glimpse into the leadership principles discussed: Proactive Mindset: Leaders, let's take the reins! A proactive approach involves seizing opportunities and anticipating challenges before they arise. It's about leading with initiative and foresight. Time Management Matrix: Effective leadership is not just about being busy; it's about focusing on what truly matters. Prioritizing tasks based on importance rather than urgency ensures our efforts align with strategic goals. Synergize for Win-Win: Collaboration is the heartbeat of success. As leaders, recognizing the value of collaboration and seeking mutually beneficial outcomes is key to fostering a culture of synergy and collective achievement. Grateful for the opportunity to share and learn from the incredible HBA community. Thank you, LeAnna J. Carey for the chance to contribute to the conversation! üôå #Leadership #EffectiveLeadership #ProfessionalDevelopment #HBA #SevenHabits\""
