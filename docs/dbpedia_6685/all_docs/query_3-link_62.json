I have long believed that patients represent the largest yet least well-utilized healthcare resource, and that the interactive computer can help clinicians to better understand their patients even as it empowers patients to take greater control of their own medical destinies [1,2]. It is my honor and pleasure, therefore, to add a few words of foreword to this welcome book. I had the good fortune to spend the 1960s at the University of Wisconsin. In this wonderful atmosphere of progressive ideology and strong social conscience, two lines of reasoning evolved in my mind [1,3]. The ﬁrst led to a set of controversial ideas I called “patient power,” arguing that patients should be encouraged to participate as partners with their clinicians in medical decisions [4,5]. Further, I proposed that patients and clinicians alike would beneﬁt if medical records were declassiﬁed, shared, and developed jointly by patient and clinician, and that words, such as “order” and “comply,” would be better dropped from the medical lexicon and replaced with words that communicated a more collaborative process [4–6]. For centuries, the medical profession had perpetrated paternalism as an essential component of patient care, thereby detracting from what patients could contribute to the quality of their medical care and depriving them of the self-esteem that comes from mutual respect and self-reliance. The assumption was that “doctor knows best.” Patient power questioned this. As Shaw once wrote, “Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same” [7]. My second line of reasoning was that the computer could be used wisely and well in the practice of medicine. As with patient power, the idea was controversial, and those of us who were entering this new ﬁeld were confronted by concerns about the computer in medicine under any circumstances. Would modern times destroy the art of medicine? Would these machines result in the disempowerment that had been associated with the industrial revolution? Yet, contrary to prevailing concerns, the computer in our laboratory instead offered the opportunity to empower the patient [1]. My colleagues and I had the idea that we could program a computer to interact directly with the patient, to engage in meaningful dialogue, to explore medical problems in detail, and to do so in a personalized, digniﬁed, and considerate manner. There was a theoretical reason for pursuing this. Could the computer model the clinician as interviewer? But there were practical reasons as well. We hoped the interactive computer would help clinicians in the care of their patients; that using the computer would be interesting, perhaps even enjoyable for the patient; and in the back of our minds vii\n\nviii\n\nForeword\n\nwas the idea that the computer might actually help patients to help themselves with their medical problems. We began with a computer-based history of allergies [8]. Our ﬁrst patient, selected by a tired intern who had been up all night and to some extent liked the idea of being replaced by a computer, was also the most informative. He sat down at the LINC computer, borrowed from Neurophysiology [9]; the tapes churned and “HAVE YOU EVER HAD HIVES?” appeared on the screen. The characters ﬂickered—the LINC was very slow by today’s standards—lights on the console ﬂashed on and off, and the speaker emitted an eerie, high-pitched sound. On the other side of a Sheetrock partition, people were walking in and out, and a cat was meowing. It was reminiscent of Kafka’s Castle [10] or Koestler’s Darkness at Noon [11]—clearly, not optimal circumstances for any medical interview, let alone one conducted by a computer [1]. Yet our patient quickly became engaged, and soon it was clear that rapport had been established between man and machine. He laughed out loud at some of the comments; and he talked to the computer, sometimes in praise and sometimes in criticism. For the ﬁrst time as a patient, he was in control. Later, when the Teletype began to print his summary, in a legible but otherwise traditional format, he turned and asked, “May I read that?” and there, in a break with tradition, I encouraged him to read his record; and as he read, he discovered errors that needed correction. The computer as an interviewer had been, and would continue to be in our experience, an acceptable means to share the medical record at a time when the shared record was controversial and resisted in the traditional setting [1,6]. Here was patient power at work. With subsequent computer-based medical histories, and later with programs designed to help patients to help themselves, we did our best to yield further control to the patient—to request permission to proceed, to respect the patient’s priorities, to respect the right to decide and not to decide, to help with uncertainty, and to respect reluctance to respond—and patients were consistent in their praise of this approach [12]. Concern about the computer as a negative, depersonalizing inﬂuence proved to be unfounded; most patients found their experience to be interesting, enjoyable, and informative; and in our experience, corroborated by others, patients often found it easier to communicate with the computer about potentially embarrassing matters than to communicate the same information to their doctor [13-15]. Furthermore, when we designed the computer-printed summaries with the patient as well as the clinician in mind, patients, who were eager to read their summaries, helped us, not only to correct errors of commission and omission, but also to remove offensive wording. Over the years, numerous studies have demonstrated that dialogue between patient and computer—well received by patient and clinician—has the potential to yield comprehensive interviews on a wide variety of medical and psychological problems [16]. Still, as a practical matter it has been hard for clinicians’ ofﬁces to provide the computers, protected space, and administrative overhead required for these interviews. Computing for the patient, for interviews, for health-related information, and for a wide variety of other purposes, needed a new technology. This came with the advent of the Internet and the increasing availability of PCs with access to the Internet. And now, Consumer Informatics, as presented so ably in this book, is a burgeoning ﬁeld. Patients and prospective patients can now participate in their health care over the Internet from the privacy of their homes; and they are availing themselves of this electronic communication in great numbers.According to a recent survey, well over 100 million people in the United States turn to the Internet for health related information [17]. For the most part, this information is presented in a didactic, non-interactive manner, but I am conﬁdent that more and more interactive programs will be available to address the\n\nForeword\n\nix\n\nindividual needs of patients who use them. Increasingly, patients communicate with each other as well as with their clinicians by electronic mail [1,6]; and although currently limited to a few clinical practices, secure Web sites are now available that give patients a means to view their medications; request prescriptions, appointments, and referrals; view upcoming appointments; and view the results of their diagnostic studies [18–23]. Further, it should now be possible to deliver to people in their homes, interactive interviews that obtain their medical histories and incorporate the results of these interviews into their electronic medical records, readily available both to patient and clinician [6]. I am conﬁdent that the “digital divide” will continue to narrow, that the Internet will continue to become democratized as well as democratizing, available to more and more people from all walks of life, and that consumer informatics will improve the quality of medical care. This excellent collection of thoughtful, informative, and thoughtprovoking chapters shows that this process is already well underway. Warner V.

Launched in 1988 as Computers in Health Care, the series offers a broad range of titles: some are addressed to speciﬁc professions such as nursing, medicine, and health administration; others to special areas of practice such as trauma and radiology. Still other books in the series focus on interdisciplinary issues, such as the computerbased patient record, electronic health records, and networked healthcare systems. Renamed Health Informatics in 1998 to reﬂect the rapid evolution in the discipline now known as health informatics, the series continues to add titles that contribute to the evolution of the ﬁeld. In the series, eminent experts, serving as editors or authors, offer their accounts of innovation in health informatics. Increasingly, these accounts go beyond hardware and software to address the role of information in inﬂuencing the transformation of healthcare delivery systems around the world. The series also increasingly focuses on “peopleware” and the organizational, behavioral, and societal changes that accompany the diffusion of information technology in health services environments. These changes will shape health services in the new millennium. By making full and creative use of the technology to tame data and to transform information, health informatics will foster the development of the knowledge age in health care. As coeditors, we pledge to support our professional colleagues and the series readers as they share the advances in the emerging and exciting ﬁeld of health informatics. Kathryn J. Hannah Marion J. Ball\n\nxi\n\nPreface\n\nAs a parent, I recently became personally aware of the importance of consumer health informatics. After a frightening trip to the hospital with an unconscious child, I was told that her EEG was “very abnormal” and that she had a seizure disorder. Other words followed but they didn’t get processed. I only heard abnormal EEG and seizure disorder. Before I could think of any questions to ask, the neurology team was gone. Within minutes, the parade of “what ifs” began in my mind. I asked to speak to the doctors who had examined my daughter, but they had moved on to another hospital unit. A nurse paged the fellow, who said she would return to talk to me. I waited several hours and found myself entertaining more questions, and especially wishing I could remember the name of the drug they were going to be giving my daughter. I decided to walk across the street to my ofﬁce to check the Internet. I thought a quick search would give me some of the answers I needed. Knowing to look only at a “trusted site,” I went directly to a national organization for persons with epilepsy. I clicked on the link for answers to questions and then on the link entitled “Children”. My eyes were drawn to the bulleted points on the right side of the page: • “300,000 children have seizures” • “there are different types of seizure disorders” • “many children feel loss of self-esteem and social isolation” Further exploration of the same Web site led me to a page that discussed driving restrictions for persons with epilepsy. I couldn’t help but think about how my bright ﬁve-year old daughter’s life was going to be impacted by this diagnosis. I did not quickly see a link to medication information so I left this Web site and searched using the keywords epilepsy, medication, and children. There were many hits. One of the ﬁrst was for an attorney who assists parents whose children have been injured by seizure medications. I ultimately returned to the hospital an even more anxious parent. With the passing of time, fear started to overtake my usual rational pattern of thought. I talked to a staff nurse and asked her how my daughter’s life would be changed by epilepsy? Would my ﬁve-year old be injured by the medication? Would she become dysfunctional? Would she still be permitted to attend school? The considerate answers she gave me based on her experience, really helped reassure me. A pediatric resident soon joined us, and I asked him the same questions. He provided the same calm reassurance. That night, the resident and the unit nurse helped me process the small amount of information I had and helped me move forward to xiii\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nmore rational thinking. I still had many questions but now they were practical and based on my daughter’s unique situation. As my information needs changed, I was better able to focus my Internet search. I found wonderful support and answers in BrainTalk Communities, which is part of the Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Neurology Web resources (http://adams.mgh.harvard.edu/NISRDG/#ptweb). As I consider my experience of that day, I am aware that people seek information from a variety of resources and use many different approaches to process information. I am also aware that when faced with a crisis it is difﬁcult to separate intellectual questions from situational emotions. My own experience has taught me to think differently about the role of the care provider and how important high-quality, accessible information resources are for healthcare consumers in times of crisis. The Internet is a powerful resource when it provides access to accurate and personally meaningful information. There are situations when a conversation with a healthcare provider is the best resource, but that is not always possible in today’s healthcare environment. As a developer of consumer health information resources, I am convinced that we must create new consumer-provider communication paradigms that capitalize on the strengths of information technologies to meet the needs of individual healthcare consumers. The designers of healthcare Web sites need to work with knowledgeable consumers and healthcare providers to ensure that high-quality information is thoughtfully presented. I also believe that clear, direct, and hopeful messages should be brought forward to prominent placement on Web sites for healthcare consumers who are seeking information in times of crisis. We have a wonderful opportunity to build resources to meaningfully help people process information when they need it most. These chapters present information that represents the current science of consumer health informatics and provide examples of model programs that seek to build new information sharing strategies. As professional organizations and consumer health working groups make important contributions to consumer health informatics, the growing library of literature will help shape the ﬁeld. A number of healthcare informatics’ educational programs have integrated consumer health informatics content, and governmental agencies have set agendas that promote research and development in this ﬁeld. Through the chapters that follow the reader will gain insights into the deﬁnitions for consumer health and health informatics through theory-based approaches. “Bestpractice” strategies for development and evaluation, and model initiatives in consumer health informatics are presented. The text includes authors and editors from interdisciplinary backgrounds who have presented, as fully as possible, the depth and breadth of consumer health informatics expertise. We are fortunate to have the knowledge and expertise that they provide in the pages that follow. I have shared my own experience to illustrate the importance of access to highquality, individualized information that is available in an environment of consumerprovider information-sharing, as well as the importance of including the consumer in the design and development process. We have much to gain by the efforts of so many who are researching, teaching, and living the experience of access to consumer health information. It is my hope that the wonderful contributions made in this book will lead to greater insights and produce more research to strengthen and guide the science of consumer health informatics.

Chang, and Charles P. Friedman\n\nOver the last few decades, consumer involvement in health care has been dramatically transformed. Not the least of these transformations has been consumers’ active participation in decision making about their own health and the health of their family members. The advent and growing popularity of the Internet and its searchable World Wide Web have revolutionized consumers’ access to information. The sheer volume of Internet-based information on virtually any subject has been a source of both satisfaction and frustration for healthcare consumers. In the not-so-distant past, health information for patients was delivered from the perspective of the medical world. This model was understandable, as patients traditionally looked to their healthcare providers as the primary, and possibly only, source of information on health and disease. Although this approach may have been valuable in reducing access to misinformation, it also limited the range of information available to patients or consumers and placed the patient in a less engaged role. During the past decade, involving consumers in the process of health care has been increasingly emphasized, with an appreciation for the positive impact on outcomes that follows. This paradigm shift from physician-centered to patient-centric care and the impact of Internet access to health information has formed the basis for the development of consumer health informatics. This chapter presents several deﬁnitions that have been advanced for consumer health informatics and provides an overview of the process of consumer health information delivery.\n\nToward a Deﬁnition of Consumer Health Informatics To begin, it is helpful to deﬁne what is meant by “health consumers.” The American Medical Informatics Association, Consumer Health Informatics Working Group, and the International Medical Informatics Association, Nursing Informatics Interest Group [1,2] have deﬁned a health information consumer as a person who seeks information about health promotion, disease prevention, treatment of speciﬁc conditions, and management of various health conditions and chronic illnesses. Consumers of health information have consisted not only of persons with speciﬁc health conditions and their friends and family, but also of the public concerned about promoting optimal health. As noted earlier, several deﬁnitions exist for consumer health informatics. According to the U.S. General Accounting Ofﬁce, consumer health informatics is “the use of modern computers and telecommunications to support consumers in obtaining 1\n\n2\n\nD. Lewis et al.\n\ninformation, analyzing their unique health care needs and helping them make decisions about their own health” [2]. Consumer health informatics has been deﬁned by Gunther Eysenbach as “the branch of medical informatics that analyses consumers’ needs for information; studies and implements methods of making information accessible to consumers; and models and integrates consumers’ preferences into medical information systems” [3, p. 3]. Tom Ferguson deﬁnes consumer health informatics as “the study, development, and implementation of computer and telecommunications applications and interfaces designed to be used by health consumers” [4, p. 2]. Although this is likely not a complete collection of all deﬁnitions of consumer health informatics, these key deﬁnitions acknowledge the importance of the use of computer and information technology to support the process of health information delivery in an integrated manner to healthcare consumers. They also consistently focus on the importance of meeting the consumer’s personal information needs. Consumer health informatics is differentiated from the existing ﬁeld of medical informatics by Houston et al. “First, because of its frequent patient-centered approach, consumer health informatics may have an even stronger overlap with public health. In addition, the design of consumer health informatics applications require more frequent input from patients and consumers” [5, p. 1, sub 4,6]. Tom Ferguson describes the importance of addressing the personal information needs of modern healthcare consumers: “When they have a serious medical concern, they (healthcare consumers) don’t just accept whatever treatment their local doctor offers. They’ll spend hours and hours on the Internet learning about their condition, communicating with other patients and clinicians who share their interests, and tracking down every lead they can ﬁnd on the best new treatments” [6]. Dr. Ferguson has delineated 10 levels in which consumers participate in the access and use of health care information [7, pp. 1–2], as follows: Level 1. e-Patients search for health information. Seventy-three million American adults currently use the Internet to look for information regarding their health concerns. Four out of ﬁve of their online sessions begin with a search engine. Patients give themselves online crash courses on their newly diagnosed diseases and disorders. They prepare for doctors’ appointments and look up information on the drugs and other treatments that their doctors recommend. They look for new ways to control their weight. But above all, they search for information that might help others. According to a recent Pew Internet & American Life survey, more e-patients search for medical information for friends and family members (81%) than for themselves (58%) [7, pp. 1–2]. Level 2. e-Patients exchange e-mail with family members and friends. Online patients reach out via e-mail to those they know and love, reporting on their health problems and concerns, and seeking information, advice, and support from their personal network of friends and family members. Their loved ones typically respond with sympathy, understanding, and support. They recommend speciﬁc resources: doctors, treatment centers, Web sites, books, and support groups. They refer e-patients to “second-level” contacts, for example, another friend who knows about the topics of concern to them. They also use e-mail to coordinate face-to-face visits and assistance [7, pp. 1–2]. Level 3. e-Patients seek guidance from online patient-helpers. When faced with a new diagnosis of a serious medical problem, e-patients may seek out and communicate with an experienced online self-helper with the same condition,\n\n1. Consumer Health Informatics\n\n3\n\nfor example, the Webmaster of a site devoted to their concern. There are thousands of these condition-speciﬁc online patient helpers on the Internet, and they are not difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Patient-helpers can usually recommend the best online resources for a particular condition. In addition, they typically provide a type of uniquely practical and reassuring “been-there-done-that” advice that may be difﬁcult or impossible to obtain elsewhere [7, pp. 1–2]. Level 4. e-Patients participate in online support groups. Many e-patients facing serious medical challenges participate in Internet support communities devoted to a single medical condition (e.g., breast cancer or depression). These groups usually communicate via postings on Web-based forums or electronic mailing lists. Participants share their thoughts, feelings, personal stories, and experiences and ask and reply to questions. They also exchange information on medical studies and clinical trials, discuss current treatment options, and recommend treatment centers and professionals with special expertise in the shared condition [7, pp. 1–2]. Level 5. e-Patients join with other online self-helpers to research their shared concerns. The members of some Internet support communities organize themselves into online work groups, reviewing the medical literature on their disorder and providing lists of frequently asked questions (FAQs) for the newly diagnosed. Some online support groups conduct informal research on their shared concerns. A few have even developed and carried out their own formal research studies or have partnered with professional researchers to conduct medical research, with group members serving as research subjects [7, pp. 1–2]. Level 6. e-Patients use online medical guidance systems. At some sites, e-patients can type in the names of all the drugs they are currently taking and receive a report of all possible drug interactions. At others, they can read reviews of a drug their doctor has proposed, written by dozens of patients who have actually used it. There are sites where patients can answer a series of questions about their symptoms and receive a listing of possible diagnoses, along with a list of the medical tests and observations that could help them decide which might be most likely. Further, a number of online physician directories are available where e-patients can ﬁnd detailed information about individual doctors and hospitals, for example, patient evaluations, surgical success rates, and reports of malpractice settlements. I have come to think of such sites as early prototypes of what my colleague Richard Rockefeller has called medical guidance systems—information technology (IT) systems that use computing power to help e-patients make good medical decisions. In the future, such systems could make it possible for e-patients to play an even more knowledgeable and responsible role in contributing to their own medical care. Within these ﬁrst six levels, e-patients operate primarily in the world of lay medicine and self-managed care, with little or no involvement with health professionals. The four levels that follow involve interactions between e-patients and health professionals [7, pp. 1–2]. Level 7. e-Patients interact with volunteer online health professionals. Online patients sometimes send their e-mailed questions to health professionals they have found on the Internet. Or they may visit Web sites (e.g., drgreene.com or drweil.com) at which physicians or other health professionals offer to answer visitors’ medical questions. Hundreds of health professionals currently provide such services. Many sites (e.g., http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu) list hundreds of previously asked questions and answers in a searchable or browsable format [7, pp. 1–2].\n\n4\n\nD. Lewis et al.\n\nLevel 8. e-Patients use the paid services of online medical advisors and consultants. Some e-patients take advantage of the online-only services now offered by a growing number of professionals: They may pay a physician or a nurse to answer their e-mailed questions. They may seek an online second opinion from a physician specializing in their condition. They may sign up for a series of e-mailed counseling sessions with an e-therapist. They may employ the services of an online medical researcher. Or they seek the advice of an online personal trainer, nutritionist, or weight loss coach. Because level 8 medical professionals do not require face-to-face contact, they can offer their services to anyone with an Internet connection [7, pp. 1–2]. Level 9. e-Patients engage in electronic conversations with their local clinicians. Growing numbers of e-patients exchange e-mail with their local brick-and-mortar physicians. The content of these communications frequently resembles that of a provider–patient phone call. Patients ask questions to help them prepare for, or follow up on, a clinical visit. But because e-mail is more convenient and less time pressured, e-patients need not worry about interrupting their busy doctors. Patients who communicate with their doctors via e-mail may ﬁnd it easier to pose thoughtful questions, introduce new topics, and report on the results of their online searches. Some providers now offer more sophisticated online patient services, for example, threaded patient–physician messaging, online advice nurses, online support communities, shared access to the patient’s electronic medical records, online appointment scheduling, and online prescription reﬁlls [7, pp. 1–2]. Level 10. e-Patients receive one-way electronic messages from their clinicians. Some health professionals use the Net to send their patients unrequested messages that are not interactive, for example, targeted suggestions for behavioral change or patient education materials of the doctor’s choosing. In most cases, the effectiveness of these offerings can be increased by presenting them in an “opt-in” manner, by adding a “talk back” option, or both, moving the interaction to level 9. Although such one-way communications may be acceptable to older or less sophisticated patients, some experienced e-patients think of unsolicited one-way messages as spam and may ﬁnd them offensive [7, pp. 1–2].\n\nToward a Model for Consumer Health Informatics Drs. Lewis and Friedman [8] have proposed a model for consumer health informatics (Fig. 1.1) that places the consumer at the center of the process of information transformation. This model illustrates how relevant and valid information—integrated appropriately into an environment of shared decision making—can improve both the satisfaction with the process of care delivery and measurable outcomes reﬂected in consumers’ health status. Information technology, as a mode of message/information transfer, serves to assemble and process the information and act as a catalyst for feedback. Healthcare consumers work with their healthcare providers to assemble and understand the retrieved information in the context of their personal health concerns. The ideal system output is an informed healthcare consumer who is making health choices based on personal health goals that lead to improved health outcomes. The model is graphically represented in Fig. 1.1.\n\n1. Consumer Health Informatics\n\n5\n\nFIGURE 1.1. A model for consumer health informatics. (The consumer in this ﬁgure is meant to represent persons of all genders, races, and ethnicities.)\n\nOne Consumer’s Experiences and Perceptions: Jason G. Cooper, MS Consumer health informatics is best illustrated through the actual experiences of a healthcare consumer. We recognize Jason Cooper for his willingness to share his story and for the understanding that it brings to our study of consumer health informatics.\n\nCase Study I was diagnosed with Crohn’s in 1993—a life-altering event for anyone with this chronic disorder. Instead of entering the military as an ofﬁcer, I was medically discharged and decided to attend graduate school. Although I didn’t know it then, this is where my education with community health informatics would begin. Wanting to learn more about this disease, I searched for health resources. Beginning with my mother’s books (she’s a nurse), I read for hours on end. Most of these books dealt with people who were extremely sick from inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), which served to do nothing more than frighten me. Sadly, nothing informatively satisfying was given to me when diagnosed. I was prescribed Azulﬁdine, given a one-page brochure, and sent on my way. At the time, the Internet was just beginning to blossom into the public and private sectors. After a couple of years of unsuccessfully “dealing” with my condition alone, I decided to seek help from my peers. Online discussion groups, varying Web sites, and the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America’s (CCFA’s) “Ask the Physician” forum are where I spent many hours. By far, these were the most enlightening experiences— learning that others had similar food interaction problems; learning that I was not\n\n6\n\nD. Lewis et al.\n\nalone; and, asking volunteer gastroenterologists speciﬁcs about prescription medications, diet, and a myriad of other questions. I had found what I truly needed years before when my diagnosis was ﬁrst made: an information resource, a self-help and support group, and a healthcare professional willing to lend personal advice. For those suffering with many chronic ailments, these are three very important issues: educating oneself, knowing there are peers that are experiencing the same and supporting one another, and professional advice without the need for an ofﬁce visit. In retrospect, an information kiosk at the gastrointestinal (GI) doctor’s ofﬁce where I was diagnosed, to address all of these concerns, would have helped considerably. The Internet has come a long way since 1993 and advances in informatics research will open more doors for patients to self-inform. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Duke University and I am focused on IBD diet and wellness research. I believe the future of community health informatics will be to assist individuals in learning, ﬁnding applicable resources, and seeking professional advice outside the standard ofﬁce visit. As a fellow informatician, I perceive the principal challenges to be: • Electronic Health Record (EHR) standardization, which without we cannot conﬁdently deliver complete and accurate health information. • Standardizing the delivery of patient health information outside the current care paradigm (i.e., Web delivery of tests, ﬁndings, and billing; Web and e-mail reminders for normal visits, special visits, bills, and insurance; and personalized health-related news and information). • Enriching patient education and compliance. I believe that we can address these challenges and change the way information is delivered by: • Widely standardizing the EHR (IEEE, ISO, other standards organizations, and e-health leaders). • Implementing e-capable (Internet, mobile devices, etc.) health information distribution. • Educating patients on diverse levels such as hard-copy brochures (perpetual method), information kiosks in specialty clinics and community/family medicine clinics, e-health delivery, and e-health education (oneself, loved ones, or academia). On a closing note, my heartfelt understanding is shared with those indomitable sufferers of IBD—Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, as well as those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). I’ve been through 11 years, lots of Crohn’s medications, countless procedures, and a bowel resection . . . yet I continue to dream of a cure of these troubling disorders. I plan to dedicate time and effort for research toward quality-of-life issues and patient education. I also applaud the tireless work and contributions of researchers, educators, philanthropists, and the innumerable healthcare professionals.\n\nSummary and Issues Healthcare consumers are actively involved it seeking health information and in using the information they are ﬁnding to make decisions about their health. People seek healthcare information from a variety of sources, which include print and electronic resources, healthcare providers, other consumers, and their families and friends. The\n\n1. Consumer Health Informatics\n\n7\n\ninformation may be delivered in a variety of print and media-based formats, through electronic access, that is, Internet-based delivery, telephone delivery, e-mail and chat, access to electronic databases, and other formats too numerous and constantly evolving to mention. It is important that access to health information is consumer centered and accessible for the person involved and for his or her provider, and that the process of consumer health information delivery focuses on the personal information needs of the healthcare consumer. To meet the unique information needs of healthcare consumers and support the process of optimal health outcomes consumer health informatics applications need to support the synergy between patient and provider. The example provided by Jason Cooper illustrates the need for integrated systems that support healthcare consumers’ access to the information combined with access to healthcare providers working and interested to discuss, validate, and assist consumers in understanding the information in the context of their own health concerns. In the course of creating consumer health informatics tools, consumers, providers, and informaticians must pay attention to ethical and social issues so that together they shape the future as they would like it to be, in terms of both how technology is used and what kinds of regulations are put in place. Certiﬁcation and self-regulation, instead of only government regulation, are needed to ensure information accuracy and to help users evaluate the credibility of information providers and information sources [9, p. 312]. In this text we are presenting the science of consumer health informatics. Each chapter makes a unique contribution to this effort. We are ever aware that any discussion of consumer health informatics should represent the science of healthcare informatics within the context of the healthcare consumer we seek to serve. The text is organized to move the reader from a discussion of deﬁnitions for consumer health and health informatics through theory-based approaches for design to a presentation of “best-practice” strategies for development and evaluation. The text ends with discussion of model initiatives in consumer health informatics. Critical issues are examined that challenge providers, consumers, and informaticians who seek to create and use consumer health informatics applications.\n\nReferences 1.

Consumers of health services create and maintain healthy lifestyles, develop healthy communities, and, in collaboration with healthcare professionals, manage disease and its recovery. Similar to their professional counterparts, lay people engaged in health care also beneﬁt from informatics solutions that permit them ready access and judicious application of health information, clinical recommendations, and interpersonal support. The purpose of this chapter is to characterize lay people as patients and consumers of health services, examine their recognized and implicit roles in health and health care, and explore how consumer health informatics (CHI) innovations support an empowered, engaged consumer. An ideology of empowerment—granting of power to a dependent group or enhancing an individual’s ability for self-determination—pervades contemporary American culture. CHI proceeds from this ideology and, in turn, facilitates its realization in health care. CHI innovations provide information about their health concerns, assist consumers in ﬁnding others who share their concerns, and afford them platforms to promulgate characterizations of health problems that are more person-centered rather than industry-centered. CHI innovations also help consumers navigate the complex healthcare system and access the professional recommendations and evidenced-based practice guidelines that aid in disease management. CHI innovations have the potential to support knowing participation in healthcare practices. In this chapter, we explore ideas central to collaboration in health care, examine the roles of lay persons, and evaluate the rich, ever growing set of informatics innovations for the extent to which they empower consumers to take charge of their health and actively participate in decisions about healthcare delivery.\n\nCollaboration in Health Promotion and Disease Management Accomplishing personal and population health objectives and the goals of healthcare delivery requires the active participation of many individuals, including clinicians, research scientists, healthcare administrators, policy makers, and ﬁnanciers. Lay persons play a central role in the health and healthcare process, not only as the identiﬁed recipients of professional health services but also as initiators of positive personal health behaviors, who organize and manage home-based care for themselves and others, and as citizens engaged in the collaborative practices such as proper sanitation and clean air promotion that ensure the health of their communities. Philosophies of 8\n\n2. Empowered Consumers\n\n9\n\npartnership and consumerism aptly characterize the active, engaged roles assumed by lay people as they join with health professionals to set and accomplish healthcare goals. Philosophies of partnership and consumerism reﬂect the ideological shift among health professionals and policy makers, and lay persons themselves, in the ways lay persons are perceived to participate in health and health care. Partnership expands the roles of patient from the once widely accepted connotation of dependence, passivity, and compliance to one of active engagement. Considering lay persons as partners with healthcare providers shifts the balance of power for decision making and choice from one clearly situated within the purview of skilled professionals with specialized knowledge to one arising from a clinical alliance characterized by shared expectations, mutual problem solving, and joint decision making. Experiences within the mental health sector demonstrated that active engagement of patients in planning and carrying out treatment resulted in outcomes far superior to those arising under more traditional, clinician-directed care [1] and led to a reconceptualization of patients from passive recipients into actively engaged clients. This change in perception spread throughout the entire healthcare sector, resulting in a shifting of the concept of patient from one who receives care to one who actively participates in care options. Consumerism emerged in the 1960s as a social movement characterized by the right to act based on informed choice, active participation, and full engagement in critical processes. Rights may be granted by one group holding power in a situation or marketplace to another, or may be wrested from those holding power by those desiring participation. Both pathways are evident in the history of health care. Consumerism results in a redeﬁnition of what constitutes participation and who has rights to information, as well as what information is considered central and relevant. We restrict the term “patient” to the roles assumed by lay people engaged in a care partnership with a speciﬁc health professional. This relationship is characterized by mutual respect, commitment to shared goal setting and treatment planning, and an accountability of both parties for the treatment plan and its implementation. “Consumers of health care” are, broadly, all persons, sick or well, who seek information and take action in accord with personal preferences, life situations, and individual health goals, and may, but do not always, include a speciﬁc relationship with an identiﬁed healthcare provider. The shift in naming lay persons from patients to consumers reﬂects not only a perceptual change but also the real changes in the distribution of work in health care that shifted from a professional model of service delivery to a collaborative model of care engagement. Care migrated from the hospital and clinic to the home and community, spurred on as much by ﬁnancing incentives such as prospective payment as by the evidence that community-based care augmented and could even be superior to institution-based treatment. This changing of the care site vested more responsibility in lay people to take on some of the work once viewed as solely a professional pursuit, such as monitoring health status and delivering clinical therapeutics. Thus, achievement of health and accomplishment of healthcare goals rests not only on the ministrations of health professionals but essentially also on the active participation of patients and informal caregivers. Expansion in the connotation of patients and recognition of their essential contribution to ensuring the accomplishment of healthcare goals occurred concurrently with rapid growth in society’s and sciences’ understandings of health, disease, and therapeutics. Recognition of the role played by heredity and a lifetime of health behaviors led to the realization that accomplishing health goals rested not only on the judgments\n\n10\n\nP.F. Brennan and C. Safran\n\nand actions that occurred during an encounter with a professional but was also found within the everyday choices and behaviors in the life of each individual. Therefore, information needed by consumers to create and maintain health, and recover from disease, needed to address not only those dimensions relevant in the health service encounter but also those practices and choices that, made in the course of everyday living, were most likely to lead to long-term well-being. One more change in the healthcare milieu contributed to the expanded role of lay people, and consequently to expansion of their information needs. Despite growth in understanding of the biological basis of illnesses, personal preferences assumed increasing importance as guides for the selection of treatment choices. Increased sophistication in therapeutics now can present patients and clinicians with several equally appealing treatment approaches that differ in factors related more to individual preferences and values than to physiological considerations. For example, in selecting cancer treatment approaches, consideration of the patient’s willingness to tolerate certain side effects may shift the intervention choice toward one approach over an equally effective but potentially more noxious alternative. Only through exploration of patients’ values and preferences can these considerations be understood and meaningfully applied to the clinical decision. Thus, in addition to factual information about disease etiology and treatment options, people need strategies that help them reﬂect on the meaning of illness and the consequences of its management in their lives. CHI innovations provide great assistance in this arena. Careful understanding of the nature and context of consumers is essential in the design and deployment of CHI innovations.\n\nWho Are the Consumers? A perspective on health and health care that encompasses health-promoting lifestyles, healthy communities, active participation in health care, and clariﬁcation of personal values necessitates consideration that all persons, sick or well, hold vested interests in health, health care, and health information and therefore are constituents of CHI. Critical characteristics of these constituents, such as their ages, genders, ethnic and cultural identities, and socioeconomic situations, inﬂuence their health states, their access to health care, and the ways they are likely to use CHI innovations [2–4]. “Consumer” is not a uniform characteristic of all people; rather, consumers are distinguished by their very diversity. Clearly, some consumers act in self-interest, making choices and engaging in health-enhancing behaviors. Some constituent consumers, such as parents, informal caregivers, and friends, act as agents for others, advocating for their needs, ministering personal care services, and seeking and interpreting information for them. Thus, the phrase “consumers” refers to a rich and diverse collection of individuals with a self-deﬁned need for health information and role in ensuring the accomplishment of their own health goals or those of others. For most people, health concerns and the need for health information occur at home, away from the resources and supports of healthcare institutions. Fear and questions may arise unpredictably at times when health professionals are unavailable. Concerns arise regarding managing illnesses and the accouterments of care in the context of family living environments. Home-dwelling consumers thus integrate their health practices and healthcare experiences subject to the inﬂuences of the structure of their environments, the social rules of living in their community, and diurnal variation of their lives [5]. CHI innovations are used in these contexts, capitalizing on and competing\n\n2. Empowered Consumers\n\n11\n\nwith the resources and tenor of environments much different from the typical healthcare situation. Contemporary consumers are “wired” consumers. Approximately 125 million Americans have access to the Internet, and about 80% of these have sought health information at least once [6]. People of all ages, including children and elders, access health information on the Internet. Women are more likely than men to seek health information on the Internet, and the promise of privacy makes this medium particularly useful for those who prefer to explore health concerns in private. Although many consumers need information about speciﬁc medical conditions or health concerns, others look for information about health insurance, health promotion, and the quality assessment of their local hospitals and clinicians [7]. Thirty to forty percent of consumers have Internet access from their homes; the remainder use public computers connected to the Internet from schools, libraries, and workplaces. Unlike electronic mail or online telephone directories which are accessed almost daily, consumers look for health information on an as-needed basis. Achieving personal and community health goals, and ensuring full value of modern therapeutics, relies on the active engagement of consumers. The Internet has promise to reach all citizens where they live and work, and, importantly, where they encounter health concerns and must cope with health problems. Yet, although the Internet and a host of contemporary technologies provide content, skills training, and linkages with others who share similar concerns, technologies in and of themselves are not empowering—empowerment emerges from the ways the technologies are used by the people they are designed for and the healthcare professionals who serve them.\n\nEmpowerment: Using Technology to Enhance Consumer Participation in Health and Health Care Empowerment is a characteristic of groups and individuals that energizes them with the knowledge and conﬁdence to act in their own behalf in a manner that best meets identiﬁed goals. Closely aligned conceptually with consumerism and assertiveness, empowerment is distinguished by its contextual nature—that is, empowerment emerges not in a vacuum, but as a realignment of a power structure in which power, once vested in one group or person, becomes claimed, and even shared, by others. Empowerment results in a redeﬁnition of concerns, infusing once dominant paradigms of thought with the values and perspectives of new groups or individuals. Empowerment is visible through the actions and rhetoric of those involved. These actions and visibility occur on the level of both public health (the health of communities and groups) and personal health. Public health empowerment can best be seen through the actions of self-help groups and collectives who claim the right to deﬁne health concerns in terms of those most affected by them (such as mentally ill persons or the elderly) rather than those who seek to care for them. Communities and collectives participate as equal partners with governments and the healthcare industry in setting health priorities and investing in community-level health enterprises. Melville [8], citing a political science view of empowerment, identiﬁes ﬁve key dimensions of empowerment: information, access, choice, representation, and redress of grievances. Thus, social groups who are empowered have information about health concerns, access to and choice among resources, representation in decisions about the structure and deployment of those resources, and redress for their concerns regarding how resources are used. CHI innovations that\n\n12\n\nP.F. Brennan and C. Safran\n\nprovide comprehensive information about health concerns, support access and choice, and strategies for engaging in the dialogs needed for representation in decision making and redress of concerns facilitate public health empowerment. The ideology of empowerment of individuals also provides a useful starting point for examining how CHI enables consumers to actively manage their own health concerns and participate in their own health care. On an individual level, empowerment is “. . . a social process of recognizing, promoting, and enhancing peoples’ abilities to meet their own needs, solve their own problems and mobilize the necessary resources in order to feel in control of their lives” [9]. In this sense, then, empowerment characterizes the manner in which patients and clinicians approach care, with mutual expectations, rights, and responsibilities. Empowerment represents a change in philosophy for both care providers and patients alike, requiring the former to abandon the authoritative control once held and the latter to assume a greater level of deliberate selfinvolvement in the care process. Empowerment does work; there is good evidence that coaching patients using empowerment strategies leads to broadened, less pejorative deﬁnitions of illness as well as improved self-management by lay persons. However, without concomitant responses from care delivery systems, and clinical providers themselves, the beneﬁts of empowerment are unlikely to emerge [10]. For consumers to be fair and equal participants in empowered partnerships with clinicians requires that they have adequate knowledge; set realistic goals; access systematic problem solving, coping, and stress management tools; obtain social support; and maintain self-motivation. In turn, clinicians and care delivery systems must bring to the situation a commitment to collaboration, content, and communication strategies; attention to the comprehensive needs of the individual; conﬁdentiality; and continuity along the care concerns of the individual [10]. Although some dimensions of empowerment emerge only in the interpersonal context of care, information technology, speciﬁcally CHI innovations, can ensure the ubiquitous availability to society and lay persons of the tools and communication channels necessary to support empowerment. CHI, the deliberate application of medical informatics technologies to serve the needs of lay persons, proceeded from many philosophical origins [11,12]; regardless of the implicit or explicit motivation of the initiators, CHI innovations have the capacity to support empowerment of lay persons in managing their own health concerns and acquiring the necessary healthcare resources to achieve health goals. The information technology requirements to support empowerment include four key functions: access to comprehensible, reliable, and relevant health information; communication with peers and professionals; access to personal care management tools including selfmonitoring and decision support systems; and ubiquitous access to clinical records. The past 20 years has witnessed a plethora of experimental and prototype Internet-based resources that attempt to fulﬁll these requirements.\n\nConsumer Health Informatics as a Means Toward Empowerment Almost since the Internet began, lay people and their family caregivers have looked to exploit its capacities to achieve health and healthcare goals. The Electronic Grandparent project of the mid-1970s used simple terminal connections to link elders in a senior center and children in a daycare center, promoting intergenerational communication [13]. In 1982, the Cleveland Free-Net opened as an experimental use of early\n\n2. Empowered Consumers\n\n13\n\nelectronic bulletin board technology designed for rapid consultation between family medicine trainees and their off-site faculty mentors. Unexpectedly, lay people learned that they, too, could post questions and have them answered by the family medicine experts. By 1985, in San Francisco, there were more than 25 public bulletin board services for people with AIDS, allowing those coping with this complex, emerging disease easy access to peers who could offer self-management advice and the few professionals who had some knowledge about how to treat an unusual health problem. The 1990s witnessed rapid growth in the deliberate use of Internet-based systems designed to promote self-management and educate consumers about health, wellness, healthcare options, and disease management strategies [14,15]. The widespread availability of the World Wide Web led to the creation of health-related Internet resources (healthrelated Web sites), ensuring direct access by consumers to professional and research biomedical literature and to commercial health information management providers, such as WebMD®. Recent developments in Web-enabled access to clinical records systems provided an opportunity for healthcare systems to provide patients with access to their clinical records, thus expanding the portfolio of CHI tools.\n\nKey Types of Consumer Health Informatics Innovations CHI encompasses a variety of applications of Internet-based computer technology employed to meet the information, self-care, and health service participation of patients, family members, and well persons. CHI tools are used to deliver advice and instruct professional support and include health-related Web sites and mobile/wireless computing tools. These also allow patients to record and sometimes analyze relevant clinical concerns. Some CHI applications assist patients in making complex decisions [16] while others provide coaching and advice on clinical management of patient problems [17,18]. Interactive health communication technologies (IHC) is the term employed by the Science Panel on Interactive Communications Technologies (SciPICT) to encompass the variety of Internet-based CHI innovations [19]. IHCs include health-related Internet resources, specialized Internet-accessible clinical care services, and Internetsupported communication and information management with care providers. The SciPICT called for rigorous evaluation of these innovations to determine their effects and likely beneﬁts for consumers. Field evaluations by several groups demonstrated that IHCs are acceptable to many types of consumers and do have demonstrable beneﬁts, including greater knowledge about their health concerns [20], improved decision making conﬁdence [21], symptom relief [22], and changes in the way consumers access and use health services [2]. Here we summarize three types of IHCs and examine their contribution to empowering consumers and engaging them in healthcare practices: health-related Web sites, experimental Internet-based health services, and integrated clinical information systems access.\n\nHealth-Related Web Sites The advent of the World Wide Web (WWW) created easy access to vast stores of health information. Health-related Web sites appeared almost immediately as the WWW emerged. Health-related Web sites characteristically include factual information about health concerns and how to manage them, advice from health professionals, and communication resources that permit conversations among persons sharing common con-\n\n14\n\nP.F. Brennan and C. Safran\n\ncerns. Health-related Web sites may be sponsored by professional societies, healthcare providers, and self-help groups.The content ranges from general-purpose health portals that encompass many health problems to highly focused attention to a single disease, syndrome, or concern. The public health community—government agencies, public interest associations, and activists—employ the Web for a variety of uses. Web sites become gathering places for groups sharing like concerns, enabling unrestricted public dissemination of information and open public debate regarding concerns and community issues. Public Health authorities use the Web to alert citizens of public health concerns and public health warnings [23]. Robust tools such as hyperlinks and discussion groups allow rapid integration of diverse content and easy integration of diverse viewpoints. Other health-related Web sites provide information related to an individual’s experience of health and health care. Healthcare providers, clinicians, and even lay people themselves create Web sites that address the concerns related to speciﬁc diseases or conditions and make those sites available to the general public through the Internet. Individuals use network computers to access these health-related Web sites and locate the sites through many pathways—queries initiated from general search engines such as google.com or yahoo.com, direct referral to the Web site address from colleagues or recommendations of clinicians, or happenstance and browsing. Consumers report an increased sense of conﬁdence gleaned through obtaining health information from Web sites. Consumers consult health information on the Internet in preparation for visits to their clinicians and report discussing this information with their clinicians. Clinicians vary in their responses to consumer-directed consultation of Internet health sites, with some discussing and clarifying the consumers’ information with them and others discouraging this type of exploration. Some challenge the value of health information on the Internet, noting that consumers may ﬁnd information that presents inconsistent or confusing results or that simply may be wrong [24]. Others argue that consumers may be only better informed but no more powerful in accessing health services or applying the information in their own care [25]. Some evidence suggests that consumers have difﬁculty selecting appropriate search terms to locate relevant health information, and coping with differences between “lay language” and professional terminology poses signiﬁcant challenges for lay people [26]. However, consumers seem undaunted when faced with the multiple results of imprecise searches, demonstrating willingness to sort through a large number of results to ﬁnd information of interest [27] and showing the ability to discriminate between credible and unworthy information.\n\nExperimental Internet-based Health Services Although health-related Web sites provided electronic gathering places for persons with like concerns to obtain information and peer support, their use remained limited to motivated individuals who had the technological resources and personal persistence to locate and to access them. Systematic demonstration that Internet-based health services could empower people to act effectively on their own behalf required careful ﬁeld experimentation with targeted groups. Experimental Internet-based health services provide a core set of services (e.g., condition- or disease-speciﬁc information, communication with peers and professionals, and self-management tools) to a speciﬁc sample representing a key population. Key distinctive factors of these initiatives lie in their use of controlled ﬁeld experimental procedures to determine what effects can be directly attributed to the intervention.\n\n2. Empowered Consumers\n\n15\n\nThus, these experimental innovations are similar in structure to health-related Web sites and can capitalize on their acceptability but, because of the sophisticated experimental design and observation strategies, offer a strong advantage to understanding how these systems are used and greater explanation of the beneﬁts and consequences of the use of IHCs. Brennan’s ComputerLink projects (ca. 1988–1992) and HeartCare initiative (1995– 2003), Gustafson’s CHESS project (1992–present), and Safran’s Baby CareLink stand as exemplars of experimentally tested Internet-based health services designed to complement or augment available healthcare resources. The results of these early experiments were largely positive, demonstrating that providing lay people with access to health-supportive computing resources in the home improved self-care, enhanced well-being, and reduced reliance on traditional health services. The Projects Home access to health-related resources predates the World Wide Web. In the late 1980s, Brennan’s group designed and deployed ComputerLink, a specialized computer service designed to promote self-care and peer communication among home-bound persons and their family caregivers. Targeting two groups, persons living with AIDS and caregivers of persons with Alzheimer’s disease, the two ComputerLinks were similar in design (information, communication, and personal management tools) and were deployed over a 6- to 12-month period with the identiﬁed groups [28]. ComputerLink had differential effects on consumers, with the greatest beneﬁt accruing to female caregivers who did not live with the care recipient [29]. Capitalizing on improved technology, Brennan’s group developed HeartCare [18], a specialized Web site that included tailored, sequenced information guiding patients through the ﬁrst 6 months following surgery, private communication with other patients and with a clinical nurse specialist, and a public bulletin board. Patients recovering from coronary artery bypass graft surgery used WebTV® to access HeartCare. A tailoring program, launched when the patient accessed the site, created unique, personalized interfaces and directed the patient to information relevant to his or her point of recovery (Figs. 2.1 and 2.2). Gustafson and colleagues developed the Computer Enhancement and Social Support (CHESS) system [4] to provide speciﬁc assistance to persons facing complex health crises. The system included searchable knowledge bases, text and video presentation of interviews with persons sharing the same condition, and tools for decision assistance and values clariﬁcation. Targeting persons with complex, life-threatening problems (persons living with AIDS, women diagnosed with breast cancer, families of children with asthma), the CHESS team deployed the computer tools for information access, social support, self-exploration and values clariﬁcation, and decision making assistance. To support families of children born at a very low birth weight, Safran’s team created Baby CareLink [30] (Fig. 2.3). Baby CareLink employed a hospital-based Web site and an interactive video connection between the neonatal intensive care unit and the family’s home to provide up-to-date information about the baby and general advice about caring for a prematurely born child. Family members could use the video link from home to visualize the hospitalized child, observe care being provided, and interact with nurses and other care providers. On discharge of the baby, the video linkage allowed in-home conferencing and coaching, supporting the family through the transition from hospitalized care to home management. Major ﬁndings of the study included\n\n16\n\nP.F. Brennan and C. Safran\n\nFIGURE 2.1. Web TV Device and Display.\n\nFIGURE 2.2. HeartCare Opening Screen.\n\n2. Empowered Consumers\n\n17\n\nFIGURE 2.3. Baby CareLink opening screen.\n\nimproved parent satisfaction with care, greater communication and coordination between the family and the hospital care team, and slightly shortened length of stay for the baby. Today, Baby CareLink operates without the two-way video in 13 hospitals in 8 states [31]. Making self-care information available on the WWW has been shown to be useful to various patient populations in managing their own health concerns. Works of Brennan and colleagues, Gustafson and colleagues, and Safran and colleagues demonstrate that CHI applications are far more complex than simply posting health information on the Web. Brennan’s work emphasized self-care and personal management of chronic or acute disease processes. Recently, Brennan’s group demonstrated that clinical gains accompany the personal satisfaction and competence experienced by computer network users. Gustafson’s CHESS projects provide patients facing health crises with clinical advice, peer experiences, and the opportunity to consult experts. Important successes include reduced negative mood, reduced time spent in health services, and a greater sense of control. Evidence exists that appropriate use of technology decreases health service utilization and promotes timely and appropriate healthcare visits. Problematically, most technology interventions occur independent of, in parallel with, but not integrated within, the clinician–patient relationship. Safran’s work stands alone in its demonstration of the application of consumer electronics to extend hospital services directly into the home. Although clinical outcomes of the babies in the Baby CareLink conditions were equivalent to the outcomes of those receiving standard care,\n\n18\n\nP.F. Brennan and C. Safran\n\nfamilies experienced greater satisfaction and conﬁdence in their ability to perform necessary care activities. The experimental Internet-based health services offer strong support for the concept of technology-empowered patients. These innovations reach underserved persons who have needs not typically addressed in contemporary health care. More importantly, they provide access in the home over long periods of time to the kinds of information, peer support, and skill-building tools that strengthen lay peoples’ abilities to participate meaningfully in health care. The full value of these experiments will be available to consumers, the healthcare systems, and lay people when their functional components become linked with the clinical information systems used during formal care services.\n\nIntegrated Access to the Clinical Record With the exception of Baby CareLink, most CHI interventions coexist with, but do not directly integrate with, the formal care delivery resources used by individuals. Healthcare systems and hospitals are now experimenting with providing patients access to their clinical records, to information resources specially screened by the facility, and to care management functions such as secure communication with clinicians or appointment scheduling [32]. An important beneﬁt of these systems is direct access to clinical reports, such as laboratory tests and recent diagnostics. Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center developed PatCIS, a patient-accessible view into the clinical record [33]. Accessible through standard Web browsers with appropriate encryption and security, PatCIS enables patients to view clinical tests and report self-monitoring information (Fig. 2.4). PatCIS also contains links to relevant health information resources that aid the patient in understanding and interpreting the clinical information. Specialized tools allow some patients, for example, those with diabetes, to chart daily food consumption, home glucose monitoring results, and exercise patterns and to view this information in a manner linked to their clinical records. Direct access by lay persons to their clinical records aids empowerment in several ways. First, it facilitates balancing of power between patients and clinicians by ensuring that patients and clinicians have access to the same information. Second, it permits patients to review clinically relevant information privately in a circumstance likely to be more conducive to reﬂection and understanding. It permits disclosure and discussion of the basis for clinical intervention decisions. Finally, by its very existence, consumer-available views on the clinical record demonstrate the commitment by the care-providing facility and the clinician to include the patient as a full partner in clinical decision making (Fig. 2.4).\n\nDiscussion The migration of health care from the clinic to the community, coupled with the rapid diffusion of commercial electronics, contributed to the development of the ﬁeld now known variously as CHI, e-health, or patient-focused computing. Thus, carefully designed and properly deployed electronic innovations for lay people may enhance the engagement of health professionals and lay persons now well recognized as the optimum environment for health care. Experimental systems and practice innovations in CHI show that lay people can and will use computer tools for health purposes, that this use leads to good health outcomes, and that linking consumers, health information,\n\n2. Empowered Consumers\n\n19\n\nFIGURE 2.4. PatCIS Data Entry Example.\n\nand healthcare providers via systematically deployed CHI innovations facilitates achievement of health and accomplishment of healthcare goals in a way not feasible by the singular efforts of consumers, clinicians, or computers. It is timely to realign the application of computer tools to patient care in such a way as to ensure that the technologies be systematically applied in a manner most likely to produce desired health outcomes. Philosophies of care provide likely candidates for creating frameworks for the effective deployment of information technology in the service of patients attempting behavioral change or disease management. The early experiences of lay persons’ capturing of the Internet for health purposes persist today—the Internet serves as a vehicle for educating individuals about health problems, linking those coping with complex health problems to others in similar circumstances, facilitating consumer-directed access to up-to-date health knowledge bases and disease management routines, and connecting patients to their clinical records and care providers. What is changing are two things: the underlying technological capacities for ubiquitous access and complex searching and the capacity of clinicians to systematically exploit for clinical care purposes consumers’ willingness to use the Internet for personal and public health management. It is time to move the discussion beyond the feasibility of using emerging technologies to improve lay people’s accesses to health information and health communication. Now the challenge to health professionals and medical informatics professionals alike is embedding these emerging technologies into a care system grounded in a philosophy of engagement [34]. Engagement ascribes to the patient–clinician alliance those characteristics that ensure a commitment to joint efforts toward the person’s goals of health promotion or disease management.\n\n20\n\nP.F. Brennan and C. Safran\n\nThe quality chasm and emerging healthcare personnel shortage need sophisticated information solutions to replace the naïve view that simply providing WWW-based health information would lead to improved disease management and adherence to healthy behaviors. Full engagement of informed, empowered consumers with the health professionals and healthcare delivery systems requires creating CHI innovations within new clinical care approaches, augmenting and complementing care delivery models with electronic innovations.\n\nReferences 1.

However, research indicates that although traditional channels such as newspapers, radio, brochures, and television have been proven capable of reaching and informing large audiences, they are not very effective in changing behavior. Interpersonal channels have been more successful in inﬂuencing attitudes and motivating behavior change, although their potential for delivering health communications that reach a large audience in a cost-effective manner is inadequate. The implication of this research is that mass media channels are appropriate for creating awareness, but interpersonal interactions are essential for persuading individuals to change their health behavior [1–3]. In the past few years, advances in technology have led to a new tailored approach to health communication that involves soliciting information from individuals, or alternatively querying information about individuals from existing records, to provide audible and visual feedback tailored to be responsive to the solicited information. This approach is consequential because it combines the potential for delivering costeffective health communications to reach a large audience combined with the beneﬁts of interpersonal communication. The reason is that communications that are tailored to be responsive to the solicited information can be used to mimic the transactional and response-dependent qualities of interpersonal communication. An interactive cycle of tailored feedback and response can be repeated over and over to facilitate an individual’s movement through the persuasive process of motivating health behavior change. Along the way, both source and message factors can be dynamically modiﬁed to realize the advantages inherent in interpersonal channels, advantages proven essential for persuading individuals to change their health behavior. This approach, known as tailoring, has been deﬁned as “any combination of information or change strategies intended to reach one speciﬁc person, based on characteristics that are unique to that person, related to the outcome of interest, and have been derived from an individual assessment” [4,5]. This deﬁnition highlights the two features of a tailored approach that distinguishes it from other approaches: (1) its collection of messages or strategies is intended for a particular person rather than a group of people and (2) these messages or strategies are based on individual level factors that are related to the health or behavioral outcome of interest. Although the tailoring approach has notable beneﬁts, it is important to note that not all information needs to be tailored to different individuals [4]. When needs within a population are very similar, the variation between tailored messages will be minimal 22\n\n3. Tailored Health Communication\n\n23\n\nor nonexistent, and thus tailoring may not be justiﬁed. Instead, a targeted approach may be more appropriate to address that need. Targeting involves development of a single intervention approach for a deﬁned population subgroup that takes into account characteristics shared by the subgroup’s members. Targeting is based on the advertising principle of market segmentation, which aims to ﬁnd the right kinds of consumers for a particular product of service. Readers interested in learning more about distinctions between tailoring and targeting are encouraged to review articles by Kreuter and Skinner [6] and others [7,8].\n\nWhat Is the Rationale for Tailoring? The rationale for a tailored approach is grounded in theory that explains how people process information. Petty and Cacioppo’s (1981) Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) provides a theory for understanding this process [9]. They have proposed two routes to attitude formation and change: the central and peripheral routes. The central route involves a cognitive component in which the attitude is formed or revised after much thought. This involves effort on the part of the individual and is more likely to occur when the information is perceived to be personally relevant. Studies have shown that messag"
