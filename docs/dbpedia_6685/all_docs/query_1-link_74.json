        "meta_description": "The internet is the most comprehensive electronic archive of written material representing our world and peoples' opinions, concerns, and desires. Physicians who surf the internet for the first time are often stunned by what they learn on websites set up by lay people or patient self support communities. Material on these venues can be a rich source for researchers interested in understanding the experiences and views of people and patients. Qualitative analysis of material published and communicated on the internet can serve to systematise and codify needs, values, concerns, and preferences of consumers and professionals relevant to health and health care. While the internet makes people's interactions uniquely accessible for researchers and erases boundaries of time and distance, such research raises new issues in research ethics, particularly concerning informed consent and privacy of research subjects, as the borders between public and private spaces are sometimes blurred.\n\n#### Summary points\n\nInternet communities (such as mailing lists, chat rooms, newsgroups, or discussion boards on websites) are rich sources of qualitative data for health researchers\n\nQualitative analysis of internet postings may help to systematise and codify needs, values, and preferences of consumers and professionals relevant to health and health care\n\nInternet based research raises several ethical questions, especially pertaining to privacy and informed consent\n\nResearchers and institutional review boards must primarily consider whether research is intrusive and has potential for harm, whether the venue is perceived as “private” or “public” space, how confidentiality can be protected, and whether and how informed consent should be obtained\n\nInternet communities provide a way for a group of peers to communicate with each other. They include discussion boards on websites, mailing lists, chat rooms, or newsgroups. Examples of health related mailing lists can easily be found by inserting a key word such as “cancer” in the search box at the …",

        "text": "The internet offers patients remarkable opportunities to find support\n\nfrom others in similar medical circumstances. The technology that\n\nfacilitates electronic support groups and lists, however, also permits the\n\ncollection and analysis of information that many individuals consider\n\nprivate. A recent survey of webmasters and patient advocates suggests that\n\nresearchers using the internet should employ particular care with regard\n\nto permission for use of archived material and privacy of group members.\n\nEysenbach and Till identify informed consent, privacy, and\n\nconfidentiality as key considerations for researchers doing qualitative\n\nresearch on the internet (1). They note that to determine whether informed\n\nconsent is necessary, the researcher must determine whether postings to an\n\ninternet community are private or public communications. Many lists and\n\ndiscussion boards require participants to complete a subscription process,\n\nwhich leads participants to believe that their discussions occur within a\n\nclosed group. However, archival technology makes it possible for\n\nnonmembers of many internet communities, including journalists and\n\nresearchers, to access members’ postings.\n\nPatients’ health may improve when they participate in internet-based\n\nsupport groups. Among users of web-based depression support groups, more\n\nfrequent use was associated with an increase in resolution of depression\n\n(2). One study of women diagnosed with breast carcinoma who participated\n\nin an electronic support group experienced reduced depression and\n\nreactions to pain (3); in a second study of breast cancer patients,\n\nresearchers reported a reduction in depression, cancer-related trauma, and\n\nperceived stress after a 12-week web-based support group (4). Online\n\nsupport groups also provide support to caregivers, who may have minimal or\n\nno contact with others in a similar situation within their community.\n\nParents of children with cancer reported getting information, sharing\n\nexperiences, receiving general support, venting feelings, gaining\n\naccessibility, and using writing as benefits of online support groups (5).\n\nInternet-based support groups appeal to participants for many\n\nreasons. A study of users of online support groups for depression found\n\nthat participants had less social support than primary care patients with\n\nmajor depression (2). Internet-based support groups promote access for\n\nindividuals from a wide geographic area who lack access to such groups\n\nlocally. Some individuals, particularly those with stigmatizing\n\nconditions, may find the relative anonymity of web-based support groups\n\nappealing. The ability to receive attention without being seen entering a\n\nhealth care facility or risking a loss of privacy in other ways is another\n\nbenefit of online support groups.\n\nDiscussion group participants are the primary beneficiaries of\n\nmembership in such groups, but others may benefit from the existence of\n\nelectronic lists and groups. Journalists can use archives to learn more\n\nabout health conditions and identify potential interviewees. Academic\n\nresearchers and social scientists may find list archives to be a source of\n\ninspiration for investigations and academic publications. Although\n\nacademic institutions generally require researchers to submit research\n\nprotocols for review prior to interaction with human subjects, few\n\njournalists are subject to any such review process. Thus, list\n\nparticipants’ perception of list privacy and the practices of those who\n\naccess list archives may be in conflict.\n\nTo determine how health discussion group participants view\n\nappropriate use of list and archived postings, a 10-item survey was\n\ndeveloped to assess attitudes regarding journalists’ access to and use of\n\nlists and archives. The instrument contained three sets of three Yes-No\n\nquestions related to a specific issue: 1) Is it permissible for\n\njournalists to join electronic lists intended for people with specific\n\nhealth conditions as a way to research assignments? 2) Is it permissible\n\nfor journalists to quote list subscribers’ comments in published media?\n\nand 3) Is it permissible to quote list subscribers without informing the\n\nlist of the publication venue(s) and date(s)? Respondents answering the\n\nfirst question in a series “No” were directed to the next series of\n\nquestions. The final question solicited additional comments.\n\nIn October 2003 the survey was posted to two electronic lists:\n\nMedical Webmasters (MWM), an open, unmoderated list for individuals\n\noperating medical and health-related web sites; and Patient Advocates in\n\nResearch (PAIR), a closed, unmoderated list for cancer patient advocates.\n\nThe survey was sent to the lists in a message identifying the investigator\n\nand requesting that participants send responses to the investigator rather\n\nthan the list. The investigator had been a member of the lists for several\n\nmonths prior to the study. Responses were accepted for seven days. Each\n\nresponse was assigned a number and copied into a blank document. Email\n\naddresses, names, email signatures, and personal comments unrelated to the\n\nsurvey were not copied into the files to prevent identification of the\n\nrespondent during analysis. The survey response rates were 2% (11 of 539)\n\nfor the MWM list and 10.4% (16 of 154) for the PAIR list.\n\nAll MWM respondents answered the three primary questions\n\naffirmatively, indicating that journalists may join electronic lists\n\nintended for people with a specific health condition to research stories,\n\nquote list subscribers’ comments in published media, and access list\n\narchives for background research or quotation. PAIR respondents were less\n\nsupportive of these activities; 75% believe journalists may join lists to\n\nresearch stories, 62.5% believe quoting list subscribers in publications\n\nis permissible, and 56.3% believe it is acceptable for journalists to join\n\nlists to gain access to archives for research and publication.\n\nAgreement between respondents of the lists decreased when the\n\nquestions addressed permission issues and specific uses, such as whether\n\njournalists could join lists specifically to access archived messages. For\n\nall questions, the behavior deemed permissible by PAIR respondents was\n\nmore restrictive of journalists than behavior considered appropriate by\n\nMWM respondents.\n\nAll MWM and all but one of the PAIR respondents answered the open-\n\nended item inviting comments. All comments were analyzed for themes common\n\nto the respondent group and the groups combined. MWM respondents mentioned\n\n14 distinct themes, and PAIR respondents mentioned 11 distinct themes.\n\nOverall, 16 themes emerged, with 9 mentioned by respondents of both\n\ngroups. Themes mentioned by both groups (and the number mentioning the\n\ntheme) included:\n\n* Journalists should ask permission before publishing list material\n\n(6 MWM, 4 PAIR)\n\n* List members have a right to privacy (2 MWM, 7 PAIR)\n\n* Journalists should act with complete transparency (e.g., announce\n\ntheir presence to the list, purpose for joining, etc) (1 MWM, 4 PAIR)\n\n* Reading through archived messages for research is acceptable (3\n\nMWM, 2 PAIR)\n\n* Proper handling of posts made by a deceased person is a concern (1\n\nMWM, 2 PAIR)\n\n* List owners and members need to have control over research use of\n\nposts (1 MWM, 2 PAIR)\n\n* List owners’ facilitation of journalists’ involvement with a list\n\nprotects the members while helping the journalist (1 MWM, 2 PAIR)\n\n* Journalists should be able to do whatever is permitted on the list\n\nif they have the list owner’s approval (2 MWM, 1 PAIR)\n\n* The dynamics of a list change when a journalist joins (1 MWM, 1\n\nPAIR)\n\nAlthough the sample size of this survey was relatively small, two\n\nthemes emerged. First, respondents from both survey populations believe\n\nthat journalists should seek permission from list members and/or\n\nwebmasters prior to use of archived information. Because they view\n\njournalistic endeavors as research, they are likely to hold the same\n\nexpectation of researchers. This observation should not surprise\n\nresearchers inasmuch as journalists and researchers join health condition-\n\nspecific lists and visit archives with information gathering as their\n\nprimary goal.\n\nSecond, although patient advocates are aware that archived postings\n\ncan’t be guaranteed to remain inaccessible to nonmembers of the list or\n\ngroup, they do regard lists as a kind of protected space where members may\n\nspeak frankly without concern that their words will be shared outside the\n\ngroup. Most recognized that individuals acting in a research capacity can\n\njoin a list but viewed members’ desire for privacy as taking precedence\n\nover researchers’ goals. This desire to maintain members’ privacy over\n\nother objectives has been reported previously (6). Researchers who use\n\nelectronic list archives are likely to experience a more positive response\n\nwhen they endeavor to respect members’ perceived right to privacy.\n\nBoth medical webmasters and patient advocates have substantial\n\nexperience with health-related electronic lists, the former as list\n\nadministrators and the latter as list members. Although these groups most\n\ncommonly approach list-related issues from different perspectives, both\n\nare concerned with facilitating electronic media as a means of patient\n\neducation and support. Their perceptions about the appropriate use of\n\nelectronic lists and archived list material for journalistic research\n\noffer insight into how both journalists and academic researchers should\n\napproach these electronic resources.\n\nReferences\n\n(1) Eysenbach G, Till JE.
