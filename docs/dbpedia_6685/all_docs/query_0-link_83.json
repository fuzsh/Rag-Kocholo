Is the Internet an exception? This question has animated new media scholars and activists alike ever since the first email lists and bulletin boards were used to organize and disseminate information at the dawn of the Internet age. There can be no doubt that the Internet and its related tools, like social networking and mobile computing, have placed powerful capabilities in the hands of individuals who collectively have used them in innovative ways to break free of powerful forces, expose corruption, and even bring down regimes once thought immoveable. The dramatic Arab Spring, fueled by social media empowered activists, is the most oft-cited of this type of \"do-it-yourself\" citizenship, but there are a multitude of other “springs” out there that follow the same playbook: individuals, networked together through distributed means of communication, outflanking and exposing the entrenched systems of power. As the many chapters in this volume reveal, DIY means taking matters into your own hands, not leaving it for others to do it for you. It means making decisions without the gaze of those in power saying what’s right and what’s wrong, what’s allowed or what’s not. A decentralized medium of communications alongside ad hoc, leaderless, “cloud-like” social movements, the Internet and DIY seem like the perfect match and a recipe for freedom and democracy. The Citizen Lab, which is an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the University of Toronto that I have directed since its inception in 2001, is another example of the power of DIY and the Internet working hand in glove. In our case, we have deliberately borrowed the methods of state intelligence agencies—specifically, the combination of human-based and technical investigations with open source information gathering—and turned\n\nx\n\nForeword\n\nthem on their heads to watch the very agencies from whom we have liberally borrowed. We employ wide-area scans of the Internet in conjunction with field research undertaken by partners in dozens of countries to \"lift the lid\" on the hidden exercise of power beneath the surface of cyberspace. But what we have found has been disturbing—indeed, calling into question the very liberating potential of the Internet itself. Whereas activists, citizens, and others have employed the Internet and new media to further democratic empowerment, we have reason to believe that the powers that be have quietly and effectively used them to do the opposite: to censor, monitor, and even disable and silence Internet-enabled social movements. We have tracked a growing market for sophisticated products and services that are sold to autocratic and repressive regimes, which use them to track dissidents, infiltrate opposition, and limit access to information and freedom of speech. These disturbing findings of the Citizen Lab have been reinforced by the recent revelations of the National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower, Edward Snowden. As Snowden has confirmed, the very social media upon which citizens depend, most of which are operated by US-based corporations who have for years been colluding with a secretive and mostly unaccountable US intelligence agency, can be a source of insecurity as much as liberation, of control as much as freedom. Every bit and byte of information we exchange, it turns out, are open for collection and analysis—a detailed record of our social networks, our trusted contacts, our movements and habits, even our innermost thoughts. Whether the many forms of DIY highlighted in this excellent volume can eventually muster the energy and persistence to reign in growing state power in cyberspace is an open question. But ultimately, the answer to that question is up to all of us. Like all technologies before it, the Internet is what we make of it. It is ours. We need to remember that before it slips through our grasp. Ron Deibert, Director of the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto August 2013\n\nIntroduction Matt Ratto and Megan Boler\n\nDIY—do-it-yourself—no longer just describes the weekend warrior struggling to install their own bathroom tiles or build their own deck. Instead, DIY increasingly constitutes our lived, daily experiences, in particular those that involve media and communication systems. And increasingly, the DIY ethos has seismically reshaped the international political sphere, as can be seen in ongoing global uprisings and the uses of media and communications within a “logic of connective action” (Bennett and Segerberg 2012), a kind of “collective” or “networked” individualism (Rainie and Wellman 2012) constituting new hybrid social movements and practices of horizontal, participatory, and direct democracy (Boler 2013; Boler and Nitsou 2014). The Occupy Wall Street movement that began in September 2011—inspired by Los Indignados Movement in Spain, following the “Arab Spring”—represents just one example of such emergent, DIY political activities. This volume brings together scholars, artists, and activists who are exploring the nature of DIY activity, discovering the potentials and the problems of digital and digitally mediated forms of making. The contributions address making as a “critical” activity, an activity that provides both the possibility to intervene substantively in systems of authority and power and that offers an important site for reflecting on how such power is constituted by infrastructures, institutions, communities, and practices. Critical makings (Ratto and Hoekema 2009; Ratto 2011a, 2011b)—such as lowpower FM stations, video productions, civic rituals, community gardens, and octogenarian tidal power systems—are reviewed and examined in the chapters that follow. Critical making signals the ways in which productions—whether of video, web-based communications, gardens, radio transmitters, or robots—are understood as politically transformative activities by the individuals and groups described in each chapter. Critical making also signals the integration/simultaneity of processes and practices, the act of making “things,” and suggests that practices of “making” are potentially\n\n2\n\nFigures I.1 and I.2 Images of Occupy movement. Boler personal archives.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nlinked to critically-infused reflection about aspects of the process itself, Critical making invites reflection on the relationship of the maker to the thing produced, reflection on how elements (whether nuts and bolts, bits, and bytes, or breath, blood, flesh, brain, and neurons) work together—in short, consideration and awareness of the mediated and direct experiences of interacting with the material world. In turn, our subtitle “critical making and social media” articulates the point of inquiry around the increasingly technologically and digitally mediated experience of our everyday lives, of labor in an information economy. Offering another concept as a point of entry, Steve Mann (chapter 1) defines “maktivism” as a practice straddling hacking, making, DIY, and DIT, implying as well the intersections of the proprietary and the free, copyright, and copyleft: “Maktivism often involves the moral, ethical, and lawful (‘white hat’) elements of the ‘hacker’ ethos, but not necessarily the illegal ‘cracker’ ethos. Maktivism combines the DIY (do-it-yourself) ethos of home renovation with the DIT (do-it-together) ethos of the GNU Linux and Free Software movement.” In his chapter, Mann also mentions “tinquiry”: “tinkering as inquiry,” another way of depicting the multi-layered nature of critical making and DIY citizenship. Each contribution is conceptualized through the lens of “DIY citizenship,” a term intended to highlight the diversity of ways citizenship is enacted and performed. While DIY activity had previously been characterized primarily in terms of youth subcultures (McKay 1998), digitally mediated DIY practices have recently become more mainstream. Terms such as “social media,” “web 2.0,” and “user-generated content” have become buzzwords, and platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are being used for overtly political purposes. The most obvious examples of these political shifts includes the so-called Facebook revolution that followed the 2009 Iranian presidential elections, or the “Twitter revolutions” that helped to end the rule of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak in Egypt in 2011. Such events constitute new modalities of political participation— “DIY government”—or, at least, such are the hopes and claims of many protestors and observers.1 Less overtly political are the large numbers of “modders,” hackers, artists, and activists who redeploy and repurpose corporately produced content or create novel properties of their own, often outside the standard systems of production and consumption. This activity is not relegated to the sphere of the digital but also includes communities of self-organized crafters, hackers, artists, designers, scientists, and engineers. These groups are increasingly to be found online exchanging sewing and knitting patterns, technical\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigures I.3 and I.4 Images of Facebook, Egypt.

Such activities can also be understood as political in the sense that they potentially challenge existing systems of authority—questioning ownership rights to media, for instance, or putting to the test traditional systems of peer review. Many of these “maker” activities begin to take on additional importance as dominant institutions, such as the military, corporations, and governments, increasingly recognize the ways in which DIY activities challenge traditional hierarchies of authority and the existing status quo.2 We suggest that these emergent communities of “critical makers” and political protestors that organize on- and offline are aptly described as “DIY citizens.” As noted by Hartley (1999), these are individuals and social groups who, in becoming producers as well as consumers, are “making themselves up as they go along.” DIY democracy perfectly describes the horizontal processes of leadership and consensus engaged in the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement. OWS participants patently rejected traditional assumptions, identities, and practices associated with “democracy” and instead conscientiously created and developed distinctly DIY organizational processes, values, and norms. This self-creation can be seen in a positive light—for instance, as a reaction against the regulation of identity that can constitute the lived experience of a totalitarian government. However, it can also be understood as part of a hegemonic acceptance of the breaking apart and individualization of civil society. In fact, Rosenberg (2005) has called this the “diyization of modern society,” pointing to IKEA as the most visible manifestation of the increasing privatization and individualization of the public realm. DIY citizenship, therefore, sits at the intersection of a series of tensions: between consumers and citizens, between experts and novices, between individuals and communities, and between politics as performed by governments and politics and DIY grassroots democracy. The authors in this collection take up the themes of social groups, competence, capacity, and the (often hidden) costs of participation. DIY citizenship potentially invites us to consider how and when individuals and communities participate in shaping, changing, and reconstructing selves, worlds, and environments in creative ways that challenge the status quo and normative understandings of “how things must be.” For example, in chapter 4, “Radical Inclusion? Locating Accountability in Technical DIY,” Christina Dunbar-Hester explores how media activists negotiated maker identities and traditional associations between technical work and gender and race as part of their DIY activities. For the groups\n\n6\n\nFigures I.5 and I.6 Images from Maker Faire 2012. Ratto personal archive.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nDunbar-Hester studied, DIY was not just about building alternatives to corporate radio stations, but also a means of addressing the ways in which technical expertise was unevenly distributed in their community. Thus, in order to enact their overtly political activity of creating alternatives to mainstream media, they had to work to develop and enhance the technical abilities of female and nonwhite members, goals that were somewhat contradictory to each other. For this group, DIY citizenship is about technical proficiency, which is understood as being linked to political power. Similarly, chapter 19, “Citizen Innovation: ActiveEnergy and the Quest for Sustainable Design” by Ann Light, reviews a participatory project that involves somewhat nontraditional makers. This group, the Geezers Club, is a group of men between sixty and eighty years of age with little or no formal training in engineering or related fields. With the support of researchers from the University of London, the Geezers Club has been designing and building alternative energy systems based on the use of tidal power from the Thames River—an inspiring story about technical capacity-building for amateurs, social intervention, and participatory political power. Throughout this volume, DIY citizenship provides a conceptual thread for relating diverse practices and domains—allowing us, for example, to compare Dunbar-Hester’s media activists to Light’s Geezers Club, and to see their identities and practices as related. These examples, like others in the volume, demonstrate a shift in the possibilities of political participation. To be a citizen is no longer merely about the standard political activities of voting, advocating for policy changes, and protest. Now, as the chapters in this volume highlight, citizen action is diverse, participatory, and discoverable in unexpected locales. These broadened concepts of citizenship call into question the traditional notions of the public sphere as performed through either rational deliberation (Habermas 1962/1989) or contested debate (Mouffe 1992). In other words, DIY citizenship draws attention to nondiscursive activity and “direct action” (McKay 1998; Doherty, Plows, and Wall 2003) as socially interventionist. Creating community gardens, filming personal music videos, and even knitting can in this light be understood and evaluated as emergent modes of political activity. Origins and Organization The ideas for this collection originated from a 2010 conference on DIY Citizenship convened by the editors.3 This international conference brought together diverse participants—scholars, artists, practitioners—representing a wide range of disciplines (including communication and media studies,\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\neducation, science and technology studies, geography, architecture, information studies, and sociology) with shared interests in the notion of DIY citizenship. During the three-day conference, participants sometimes heatedly engaged in debate and discussion regarding the term “DIY” as well as “citizenship.” These debates are reflected within the chapters in this book; authors emphasize different aspects of and questions about DIY and citizenship. With respect to word choice, one must immediately query “DIY”: are we not talking, often, about DIT, or do-it-together? Might not the spirit of much that falls under DIY be associated more with “DIO”—do-it-ourselves, emphasizing the collective and collaborative action of the individual and atomistic invocation of a self that acts? As Reilly (chapter 8) notes from his interviews with tactical media pranksters the Yes Men: “Bichlbaum argues . . . this DIY ethic is only truly effective when actions take on a cohesive collaborative bent; to pull off these labor-intensive hoaxes requires ‘the assistance of huge armies of individuals.’ We playfully noted that DIY might best be described as do-it-yourselves (pl.), given the often large number of group members needed to carry out a particular action.” Reilly describes a wide diversity of work that sees itself under the DIY umbrella. Similar to the diverse concepts of DIY expressed by conference participants, the notion of “citizenship” raises myriad questions. With its connotation and realities of inclusion/exclusion and related forms of violence, “citizenship” is a problematic and loaded term given its implications and histories. Nonetheless, the term arguably merits reclaiming and repurposing; our choice of the term “citizenship” for the 2010 conference and for this book seeks to raise questions regarding new forms of participatory engagement and world-making. Traditionally, the concept has invoked notions of membership, rights, and belonging, all of which have been curtailed and limited by nation-states. But new ways of considering citizenship are emerging. In an illustrative account, Stoker et al. (2011) examine the limits of citizenship as it is enacted within an increasingly global society, but also provide updated conceptions of what citizenship practices may look like in their best sense. They note the continuing debate within political theory over whether citizen participation has intrinsic or instrumental value, and they emphasize that most theorists currently “place a premium on increasing citizen participation as a way of ameliorating the disconnect . . . between citizens and those who make decisions in their name” (Stoker et al. 2011, 33). In their account, they note five challenges to robust citizenship: (1) differential rates of participation across social groups; (2) the competence of citizens to make reasoned judgments; (3) the capacity of\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ncitizens to influence or control political decision making; (4) the costs borne by citizens and public authorities; and (5) the extent to which participation can be embedded at significant levels of governance (Stoker et al. 2011). Finally, four broad and overlapping themes emerged from this event, which serve to organize the chapters into four parts: Part I: DIY and Activism: New Modes of Civic Engagement and Participatory Politics Part II: DIY and Making: Learning, Culture, Hacking, and Arts Part III: DIY and Design: Opening the Black Box and Repurposing Technologies Part IV: DIY and Media: Redistributing Authority and Sources in News Media Each part begins with a short introduction to the general similarities and differences between the chapters within the given section. The book’s structure highlights how DIY practices are evolving through the engagement of technologies and media with social and cultural arenas—arenas ranging from activism and media to design hacking, arts and culture, and education. Each area of cultural production is increasingly shaped by uses of technologies and media, sometimes developed specifically for the particular cultural arena and more often “repurposed” to align a corporate produced technology or media platform with an unintended use or practice. But ideas of DIY and of citizenship—and their conjoining in this portmanteau phrase—are not taken for granted by the authors in this volume but are explored through their own conceptual and empirical examples. In the next sections, we unpack further some of the conceptual histories and implications associated with “citizenship,” “DIY,” and “DIY citizenship.” Origins of DIY The earliest uses of DIY can be seen as prescient forecasts of the anti-consumerist values that continue to fuel contemporary DIY cultures. The term “DIY” came to be associated with the counterculture of the late 1960s. Gauntlett discusses the connections between emerging countercultural critiques of the formal educational system4 and thinkers who emphasized needs for experiential and do-it-yourself modes of alternative schooling (Gauntlett 2011, 50). He characterizes the central theme of all DIY practices as the “rejection of the idea that you overcome problems by paying somebody else to provide a solution” (Gauntlett 2011, 56). Leveraging thinkers\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nsuch as Alan Watts, John Holt, and Ivan Illich, Gauntlett provides a historical and conceptual point of departure for DIY activities. Equally, Stewart Brand’s Whole Earth Catalog provided a fixed origin for a wider cultural appreciation of DIY sensibility. First published in 1968, the Whole Earth Catalog provided a key touchstone for many countercultural movements and communities that continued to develop into the 1980s. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, DIY culture had evolved with the innovative emergence of “zines,” a significant cultural production practice of both punk and third-wave feminist cultures.5 Amy Spencer’s book DIY: The Rise of Lo-Fi Culture (2005) provides some of the history and details regarding these activities, noting in particular the ways proponents of lo-fi culture emphasized low cost and DIY alternatives to mainstream forms of media production. George McKay’s edited collection DiY Culture: Party and Protest in Nineties Britain (1998) brings together a number of contributions exploring the raves and protests that characterized 1990s activism in the UK and elsewhere. People around the globe were enacting forms of protest and direct action that increasingly wedded “art” and “politics.” As John Jordan writes in his oft-cited contribution to McKay’s volume: Since the beginning of this century, avant-garde agitational artists have tried to demolish the divisions between art and life and introduce creativity, imagination, play, and pleasure into the revolutionary project. Inspired by and following in the footsteps of the protest movements and counter cultures of the sixties, seventies, and eighties, the diy protest movement is finally breaking down the barriers between art and protest. It seems that at the close of the century new forms of creative and poetic resistance have finally found their time. (Jordan 1998, 129)\n\nIndeed, this conjunction of art and protest has only snowballed over the ensuing decades; feminist artists working in craft and activism have coined the term “craftivism,” which continues the legacy of DIY culture. Key texts such as Levine and Heimerl’s Handmade Nation: The Rise of DIY Art, Craft, and Design (2008) and Tapper and Zucker’s Craft Activism: People, Ideas, and Projects from the New Community of Handmade and How You Can Join In (2011) provide detailed stories and examples from practitioners of craft-based lifestyles.6 Like the lo-fi movement before them, these individuals and social collectives find value in the self-production of craft objects and understand this work as a protest against the increasing commodification of society. We now turn to an examination of how the concept of DIY citizenship has been articulated and used, discussing the advantages and limitations of its early articulations. We suggest that, moving forward, conceptions of\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nDIY citizenship require a more robust account of power relations to avoid familiar and empty invocations surrounding “democracy” rhetoric that too easily slide into liberal assumptions of individualized agency. Hartley’s DIY Citizenship The specific articulation of “DIY citizenship” is one of two notions John Hartley adds to Thomas Marshall’s citizenship “types”; civil, political, and social (Jacka 2003). To these, Hartley adds a fourth—“cultural”—and a fifth, what he calls do-it-yourself (DIY) citizenship. As Jacka summarizes: For Hartley (1999), cultural citizenship has to do with “identity” in the sense of identity politics—the “politics of the internally colonized demographics of modernity” (the poor, women, people of color) (p. 167). The second—DIY citizenship— supersedes (but continues to coexist with) the first. It is based on difference rather than identity and consists in the “practice of putting together an identity from the available choices, patterns and opportunities on offer in the semiosphere and the mediasphere.” (Jacka 2003, 185)\n\nAccording to Hartley, the DIY citizen is one who creates their identity and individuality through a process of choosing from the semiotic material on offer. This understanding of identity construction is resonant with recent notions of “self-branding” (Hearn 2008) and the production of self-identity seen by Giddens as one of the constitutive elements of late modernity (Giddens 1991). But Hartley takes this further, equating such processes with the production of citizenship as well: “‘Citizenship’ is no longer simply a matter of a social contract between state and subject, no longer even a matter of acculturation to the heritage of a given community; DIY citizenship is a choice people can make for themselves. Further, they can change a given identity, or move into or out of a repertoire of identities. And although no one is ‘sovereign’ in the sense that they can command others, there’s an increasing emphasis on self-determination as the foundation of citizenship” (Hartley 1999, 178). Hartley’s articulation comes under some scrutiny and critique for two primary reasons: first, his definition appears to assume the problematic atomistic individual long associated with liberalism. This is a conception of self deeply rooted in Western thought, which sees individual choice being able to supersede realities of social hierarchies, power differentials, and the uneven playing field on which—despite the best rhetoric of liberal democracy—individuals do not start out with equal handicaps. The notion of DIY raises—and may beg—a host of questions about the ways in which\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nthese potentially “radical” practices may align with or be appropriated by an emphasis on liberal individualism. To value “doing it oneself” sounds very much like “pulling oneself up by one’s bootstraps” and results in a continued privileging of the individual. One need merely consider general notions of the “digital divide” to see that questions of access, power, and social and cultural capital challenge any generalized or universal concept of DIY citizenship. A second and related problem is highlighted by Jacka: “it is difficult to see the difference between Hartley’s account of DIY citizenship and mere consumerism—that is, the freedom to choose products that will situate the buyer in a semiotic landscape of ‘style’” (Jacka 2003, 185). This critique points out again the overvaluation of individual choice and underestimation of the realities of late capitalist consumer society. As Jacka states: The kind of democracy Hartley (1999) had in mind is not political democracy but semiotic democracy—what Hartley called “semiotic self-determination,” also known as DIY citizenship. Democratization of semiosis leads to a “truly sovereign community,” a population “among whom relationships, decisions and ideas are negotiated and arbitrated.” It is the “citizenship of the future; decentralized, post-adversarial, based on self-determination not state coercion” (p. 161): a truly panglossian vision. (Jacka 2003, 186)\n\nWhile Jacka applauds this panglossian vision, we would suggest that Hartley’s outline of DIY citizenship is even further vulnerable to the sorts of critiques levied against the Habermasian vision of the public sphere. “Semiotic self-determination” assumes, like Habermas’s public sphere, an ideal set of conditions in which every voice is welcome at the table; all voices carry equal weight; and everyone is heard on the terms of their rational contribution to the conversation. These assumptions of deliberative democracy and public sphere have been thoroughly criticized since the 1990s for ignoring the realities of social hierarchies of power that determine who can participate in public sphere debates, whose voice is recognized, and thus who is heard. A more comprehensive examination of the critiques of the public sphere is illustrative as a point of departure for thinking through the claims of DIY citizenship. DIY Citizenship and the Public Sphere Concepts of deliberative democracy are frequently used as a stand-in for debate about the viability of public spheres. For Habermas, a liberal\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\ndemocracy ideally requires the formation of “public spheres,” sites that provide citizens space to deliberate, debate, and discuss matters of public interest outside of formal governmental processes. Habermas’s first major work, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society (Habermas 1962/1989) explored the development of this sphere, originating from a bourgeois liberal constitutional order that provided opportunities for critical reflection on its role in society. For Habermas, the key to a properly functioning public sphere involved spaces in which “rational-critical discourse” could take place: “The ideal of the public sphere calls for social integration to be based on rational-critical discourse. Integration, in other words, is to be based on communication rather than domination. ‘Communication’ in this context means not merely sharing what people already think or know but also a process of potential transformation in which reason is advanced by debate itself” (Calhoun 1992, 29). However, critiques and debates about the viability of a democratic public sphere continue; Nancy Fraser’s renowned critique of the Habermasian ideal serves as a case in point (Fraser 1990). Fraser focuses her criticisms on the actualities of power relations, exploring inclusion and exclusion as they play out in Western societies. She notes how the Habermasian ideal of a public sphere is founded on strict divisions of public and private, a division that has served historically to exclude women’s participation in the public sphere. The gendered requirements to serve in the private domestic sphere as mother, wife, and domestic laborer have served to disenfranchise women from deliberative democracy. More fundamentally, Fraser criticizes the Habermasian public sphere as requiring problematic processes of consensus building, processes that require agreed-upon definitions of common concerns and the bracketing of identities as well as ignoring systematic inequalities within the artificial zone that constitutes the space for deliberative debate. Additionally, achieving consensus and deliberative democracy in the Habermasian public sphere privileges rational (i.e., masculine) as opposed to emotional (i.e., feminine) discourse and debate, which further diminishes women’s legitimacy as authoritative participants. Finally, Fraser illustrates how assumptions about participation in the public sphere overlook hegemonic exclusion and dominance that institutionally disenfranchise and silence perspectives that don’t reflect normative or dominant cultural values. Fraser’s critique (alongside more recent discussions by political theorists including Jacka [2003], Gitlin [1998], and Mouffe [1992]) reveals the stark realities surrounding citizenship: namely, clear distinctions about who is\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nallowed to participate in public debates, who is heard, and when, how, and whether the concerns and experiences of non-dominant groups and classes hegemonically erased, denied, and silenced are included. These critiques of oversimplified invocations of public sphere participation serve as an invaluable warning while more robust conceptions of DIY citizenship are further developed. The liberal individualism presumed by ideals of the public sphere is further challenged by the more recent work of Hardt and Negri (2001, 2005), and in particular by their defining of the notion of the “multitude,” a concept they see as providing an alternative to traditional notions of political power that presume shared identities, goals, or necessary unity: One of the recurring truths of political philosophy is that only the one can rule, be it the monarch, the party, the people, or the individual; social subjects that are not unified and remain multiple cannot rule and must be ruled . . . The concept of the multitude challenges this accepted truth of sovereignty. The multitude, although it remains multiple and internally different, is able to act in common and thus rule itself. Rather than a political body with one that commands and others that obey, the multitude is living flesh that rules itself. (Hardt and Negri 2005, 100)\n\nThe concept of the “multitude” as differentiated yet able to “act in common and thus rule itself” resonates with characterizations of the DIY communities studied by the scholars in this volume. However—as another warning to those developing new conceptions of participatory DIY democracy—Hardt and Negri come disturbingly close to erasing difference for the sake of defining the multitude: “When we say that we do not want a world without racial or gender difference but instead a world in which race and gender do not matter—a world in which they do not determine hierarchies of power—this is a desire for the multitude” (Hardt and Negri 2005, 100). Despite their desire to avoid the liberal democratic model of “bracketing identities,” upon which a Habermasian public sphere is predicated, there is no clear sense of how in fact a model of participatory democracy in which race and gender do not matter might function. A further troubling matter is Hardt and Negri’s category of precarious and affective labor, which potentially ends up designating women’s unpaid labor as of a different order than the labor recognized in the (masculinized) public sphere. As renowned autonomia theorist, anarcha-feminist scholar, and activist Silvia Federici writes: “My concern is that the Negrian theory of precarious labor ignores, bypasses, one of the most important contributions of feminist theory and struggle, which is the redefinition of work, and\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nthe recognition of women’s unpaid reproductive labor as a key source of capitalist accumulation” (Federici 2008). Given the challenges, we suggest that the work of Jacques Rancière, among others, provides a valuable direction for theoretical exploration of new understandings of public sphere and participatory democracy. Of particular concern in the work of Rancière are the “unheard,” those who have “no part,” those without a so-called political voice in democracies. The moments of interruption or intervention—the eruption of the unheard into what he terms the “police order”—is precisely what constitutes “politics” for Rancière. Politics are the dynamic events and exchanges in which those without voice in the dominant culture express and make heard, or “sensible,” what has been repressed, precluded, or censored within political regimes. For Rancière, disagreement signifies the importance of radically different registers in which citizens make sense of their world and of power and authority—different registers that, unlike those in the Habermasian ideal public sphere, cannot always be rectified for the sake of consensus and agreement. Quite significantly (though the purview of this introduction does not permit full explication), the value of engaging Rancière’s understandings of the representational regime as contrasted with the potentially more radical aesthetic regime (2004, 12) is that it effectively describes the significance of DIY citizenship as a hybrid of art and politics, a mode of political poesis that can challenge stratified political structures that exclude and that seek to render interruptions and interventions “unhearable.” According to Rancière, “Political activity is whatever shifts a body from the place assigned to it or changes a place’s destination. It makes visible what had no business being seen, and makes heard a discourse where once there was only place for noise” (1999, 30). This “politics of aesthetics” Rancière terms the “distribution of the sensible” (2004, 7). We suggest that DIY citizenship and critical making enact this “redistribution” of the sensible, thereby pointing toward “disagreement” and the “politics of aesthetics” as an extremely rich theoretical framework for future explorations of DIY citizenship. Reclaiming DIY Citizenship Despite its vulnerability to these myriad critiques, the concept of DIY citizenship is creatively augmented and amplified by different authors in our volume. Rather than come to an authoritative definition of the term, the authors collectively address a range of related questions.\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nKey Questions for Understanding DIY Citizenship While the book is divided into four sections, there are also six key questions that thread across the chapters. Who is the DIY citizen? A number of chapters explore the subjectivities of DIY identity. Using examples from actual communities and contexts, the authors explore the nature of DIY participation and action. Rather than define an authoritative description, the chapters together create a composite image of the activities, memberships, and cultivations from and through which the DIY citizen emerges. For example, in “Fan Activism as Participatory Politics: The Case of the Harry Potter Alliance” (chapter 3), Henry Jenkins explores the identities and subjectivities of the DIY citizen. He describes some of the campaigns of the Harry Potter Alliance, a nonprofit organization started by fans. As Jenkins describes, this group utilizes metaphors and images from the Harry Potter books to create a platform for civic engagement. Organizing online through websites and fan fiction forums, members of the group rewrite aspects of Harry Potter to instigate political change. These DIY citizens blend their identities as fans and their identities as activists in order to form hybrid subjectivities. What are the tools and practices of DIY citizenship? Across the volume, authors provide specific examples of DIY activities and the objects, systems, and technologies that facilitate practices of participation in social systems. For example, in “The Growbot Garden Project as DIY Speculation through Design” (chapter 17), Carl DiSalvo explores “DIY speculative design” as a form of political action. Using his experiences with the growbot project from the 2010 01SJ Biennial, DiSalvo reveals how tinkering, redesigning, and imagining serves as a novel way for publics to engage materially in important social issues, but also raises the question about what should come after these imaginations. Is speculation enough or is a further step necessary? Is DIY essentially liberatory? This question signals a debate we hope readers will consider throughout their reading of this book. A number of chapters detail how and in what ways DIY fails to live up to its hype, illustrating such concerns as the hidden labor of DIY, technological determinisms frequently assumed, as well as the corporate interests embedded within many of the platforms and systems appropriated for DIY purposes. For example, chapter 18, “Doing It in the Cloud: Google, Apple, and the Shaping of DIY Culture” by Michael Murphy, David J. Phillips, and Karen Pollock, foregrounds the quid pro quo of social media. Through a close examination of the agreements people must sign to make use of their respective systems,\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nas well as the ways user-created data is utilized by Apple and Google, the authors explore how these private companies shape DIY culture. The authors illustrate the contradictions and tensions between public and private infrastructures, which are nonetheless productively utilized for DIY activities. Through their examinations of these conflicting values embedded in primary systems such as cloud computing, we are warned that, contrary to the opinion of John Perry Barlow, information does not just want to be free. What and where are the spaces and communities of DIY Citizenship? Joshua McVeigh-Schultz’s “Redesigning the Vox Pop: Civic Rituals as Sites of Critical Reimagining” (chapter 23) broadens both the idea of DIY and the concept of design through attention to what he terms “civic rituals.” Situated literally in the streets, his project “Synaptic Crowd: Vox Pop Experiments” exemplifies critical making to defamiliarize the common “vox pop” media ritual (on-camera interviews with passers-by) and thereby reimagines the role of media in identity formation. McVeigh-Schultz troubles what he sees as Hartley’s romanticized notion of DIY citizenship and critiques the idea of semiotic self-determination as both a fantasy and as a matter for concern. What are the roles of social media in DIY citizenship? As noted in many of the chapters, participation in public debate is an important driver of DIY citizenship. In chapter 26, “Critical News Making and the Paradox of ‘Do-ItYourself News,’” Mike Ananny examines citizen journalism as an alternative to mainstream forms of media, revealing the ways publics are reconstituted within DIY journalism. Graham Meikle uses the failures of Kony 2012 to address the possibilities and challenges of “distributed citizenship, in which individuals from across the globe were to engage in a collective project for political change. . . . Distributed citizenship is a political possibility of the network society in its shift from what Castells terms the space of places to the space of flows” (chapter 27). Chris Atton explores the “incorporation of media production into the routines of everyday life; the site of production in a domestic setting; and the depiction of everyday activities in the content of the media itself.” His analysis of such everyday productions as the “personal home page,” “perzines,” and “fanzines” illustrate how these “mundane media” draw on the resources of capitalism while simultaneusly revealing the (political) identities and sociality of productions by the “silent majority.” What is the role of making for DIY citizenship? Many authors explore the materialities and the processes of DIY construction and demonstrate how\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nthis work provides new modes and possibilities for political and social engagement. Steve Mann’s chapter highlights practices such as “maktivism” and “tinquiry,” illustrating these novel conceptualizations with critical projects of his own design and making such as the “Griefcase” and the “License to Sit.” In “Woven Futures: Inscribed Material Ecologies of Critical Making” (chapter 13), Daniela K. Rosner and Miki Foster link work with electronics to knitting practice, examining how participants in an afterschool program use shared making as a way to overcome social hierarchy and discover shared ground for collaboration. Here, making as a critical activity is foregrounded and its connection to politics as social relations is demonstrated. As Kate Milberry writes: “Activist-designed and built technologies are therefore disruptive tools that destabilize trends toward a closed, privatized, economically striated and commercially oriented Internet. By designing software that meets their practical needs and social justice goals, tech activists contribute to the democratization of the Internet. As a ‘practical means of resistance,’ this kind of critical making can be deployed in the blind spots inherent in systems of surveillance and social control, where there is always ‘space to manoeuvre’ (Marx 2003, 372)” (Milberry, chapter 2, this volume). DIY practices ideally create “maneuvering” space, encouraging us to rethink binary distinctions such as cultural/political and amateur/professional that reductively constrain the ways in which scholars across the arts, humanities, and social sciences understand the relationship of individuals and networks to the boundaries of cultural production and politics. Understanding these boundary-blurring practices as constitutive of DIY citizenship is, we suggest, of paramount importance. Conclusion New forms of transnational, cosmopolitan, or global citizenship are increasingly the focus of much scholarly and popular attention. As noted by Stoker et al. (2011), “The technologies of globalization have facilitated new forms of political expression and created new or alternative public spaces and possibilities of citizen engagement” (n.p.). DIY citizenship, we suggest, can be understood as a twenty-first-century amalgamation of politics, culture, arts, and technology that in turn constitutes identities rooted in diverse making practices. In contrast to earlier studies of fans and consumers that positioned them as passive receivers of popular culture, technologies, and media, DIY is characterized by its emphasis on “doing” and the active roles of interventionists, makers, hackers, modders, and tinkerers. Dunbar-Hester’s analysis of the indy radio collective Pandora illustrates this explicitly:\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nThe media activists sought to cultivate a particular mode of “maker” identity. They presented technical engagement as a strategy for leveling expertise and increasing political participation. In this, they recognized that tinkering is as much a form of cultural production as a technical one; the activists sought to produce not just technical artifacts but egalitarian social relations by eroding boundaries between experts and laypeople. Activists suggested that demystification of technology through widespread hands-on making could provide an alternative to prevalent technical cultures in which authority is not distributed, but resides exclusively with experts. (DunbarHester, chapter 4, this volume)\n\nOne may envision the DIY citizen on a continuum, with one end representing the overtly political/interventionist and the other end representing those simply channeling creativity and a kind of poesis into everyday practices. In this collection of essays, the individuals and groups described by authors for the most part understand their work to be socially interventionist. Through diverse interventionist practices of design, development, and exchange, DIY citizenship challenges traditional divides between production and consumption and corresponding power differentials built into technologically mediated societies. Such work, seen en masse and across different material and social domains, provides important guidance for questions regarding public participation in both politics and technology. Langdon Winner has noted, “Because technological things so often become central features in widely shared arrangements and conditions of life in contemporary society, there is an urgent need to think about them in a political light” (Winner 1992, 343). Winner deplores the lack of public engagement around the politics of mediated society, noting that most moves in this direction fall into a “technocratic” pattern. He follows with the important question: “How can and should democratic citizenry participate in decision making about technology?” (343) The contributors in this volume turn Winner’s question on its head, asking instead, “How do we engage with society politically through technology?” Their answers chart a space for DIY citizenship, a productive practice in which ethical and social interventions cross through a number of different modalities and materialities. In their discussion of how citizens can resist and take control of the ways that ID cards and sensitive personal information are required and used by the state and corporations, McPhail et al. bring attention to the concept of “responsibility”: DIY citizenship as we practice it takes seriously the concept of responsibility—not just the responsibility to follow the rules and accept legitimately imposed limits on our participation in society, but the responsibility to hold our governments accountable for\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nmaking rules to reflect the kind of society in which we want to live. DIY citizenship as we approach it in our research about identification and identification documents is active, engaged, and sometimes critical citizenship. It has the potential to reveal and push the kinds of societal limits that we often take for granted. (McPhail et al., chapter 5, this volume; emphasis added)\n\nFinally, given the intersecting media and economic landscapes that increasingly redefine the traditional identities associated with nation-states, “distributed citizenship” as introduced by Graham Meikle (chapter 27, this volume) suggests a promising direction for rethinking the historically overdetermined meanings of “citizenship.” The social implications of the shift to DIY citizenship are readily apparent. We contribute this collection of critical theorizations of making, in hopes of providing a starting point for others to extend such practices and as a foundation from which to examine the implications of DIY citizenship. Notes 1. For an overview of the claims and critiques associated with democracy and social media, see Boler 2010. 2. We should also add that dominant institutions may also be working to appropriate the processes and outcomes of DIY activities. A case in point is the recent funding of Maker activities by DARPA and the participation of military personnel at the New York Maker Faire 2012 depicted in figure I.6. Such instances point to a somewhat different politicization of DIY than is typically considered by DIY enthusiasts and indicate a need for increased reflection of the type demonstrated by some chapters in this collection. 3.

The chapters in this section illuminate new hybrid forms and modalities of activism and digitally mediated networks where real/virtual, direct/ mediated experiences are no longer distinguishable; online and offline activities meld and morph within our distributed networks afforded by mobile devices, social media, and information and communications technologies (ICTs). Due to the blurring of social and political practices and identities within our hybridized everyday lives, hybridity is redefining traditional understandings of the “political” and “politics” and enabling new modes of civic engagement and participatory politics. The intersection of DIY and activism represented in part I highlights several recurrent themes that straddle the key question outlined in our introduction: How do different “maker identities,” DIY citizens, and spaces of practice help us understand the necessary elements for liberatory and radical DIY citizenship? The chapters in this part illustrate diverse maker identities ranging from the fan activist (Jenkins; Burwell and Boler), to feminist zine makers (Chidgey), to tactical media activists like the Yes Men (Reilly), to indy radio collective activists (Dunbar-Hester) and hacktivists/maktivists (Mann; Milberry; McPhail et al.). In chapter 1, Steve Mann outlines the hybrid modalities of activism, hactivism, and making, enabling him to contribute the valuable concept of “maktivism”: “Maktivism often involves the moral, ethical, and lawful (‘white hat’) elements of the ‘hacker’ ethos, but not necessarily the illegal ‘cracker’ ethos. Maktivism combines the DIY (do-it-yourself) ethos of home renovation with the DIT (do-it-together) ethos of the GNU Linux and Free Software movement.”\n\n24\n\nPart I\n\nMilberry (chapter 2) outlines the historical context in which these modes of activism need be understood, emphasizing prefigurative politics, open source movements, and uses of technology to challenge capitalist norms: With the emergence of global justice movement(s) in the mid-1990s, tech activists began remaking the Internet in the image of the just society they pursue. Using free and open source software (FOSS), tech activists continue to build the digital infrastructure of the “newest social movements,” developing technologies of resistance to support activists online. The newest social movements are contemporary, broadly anti-capitalist social movements that organize loosely around anarchist politics, informed by emancipatory theory. . . . By designing values into technology that are consonant with movement goals, tech activists engage in prefigurative politics. This self-reflexivity invokes the spirit of critical making as both an activity and a site for deepening a transformative sociotechnical praxis. In deploying FOSS across an increasingly commercialized and privatized web, tech activists enact their politics at both a technological and social level. Drawn from the free software and global justice movements, these values—including freedom, decentralization, heterarchy, autonomy, self-determination, collaboration, collectivism, and mutual aid—challenge capitalist norms that dominate the social factory both online and off.\n\nWithout a doubt, mediated networks and DIY culture are spawning new modalities and expressions of political and civic engagement. Before the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement of 2011 that swept North America and the globe following the Arab Spring, dominant discourses framed young people of this generation largely as disaffected, disenfranchised, and/or apathetic. As Jenkins (chapter 3) notes: “Existing literature suggests that young people are most apt to become politically involved if they come from families with a history of citizen participation and political activism, if they encounter teachers, especially in the civics classroom, who encourage them to reflect on and respond to current events, if they attend schools where they are allowed a voice in core decisions, and if they participate in extracurricular activities and volunteerism that gives back to their community.” This momentous historical period of uprisings around the globe reflects— among other radical shifts in global and local networked DIY protest—the political engagement and awakening for hundreds of thousands of firsttime activists. These first-time activists of the twenty-first century include everyone from the millions of people who participated in global uprisings to the various fan activists discussed within these chapters. Adamant about new understandings of participatory democracy and thus central to any updated conceptions of DIY citizenship, the OWS movement’s commitments to “horizontal leadership” and consensus decision making reflect a\n\nDIY and Activism\n\n25\n\nprofoundly DIY ethos. The OWS movement exemplifies DIY citizenship in its refusal of existing hierarchical practices in favor of attempts to embody the utopian ideals of radically different processes of social organization, decision making, and leadership (Boler 2013; Boler and Nitsou 2014). Another noteworthy instance of widespread, “first-time” activism was demonstrated in the record-breaking turnout for the 2010 Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear sparked by fake news pundits Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, which brought nearly half a million people of all political stripes to rally on the National Mall in Washington, DC, demanding responsibility and sanity on the part of corporate-owned media. This turnout of a civicminded fan base of diverse ages mainly consisted of those who had never been to a political event or rally before (Reilly and Boler 2014). And while the majority of those attending the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear do not identify as “activists” per se, the shared concerns for a “saner” world and the call for accountability from media and elected politicians demonstrate the kinds of hybrid activism that concern Jenkins’s “Fan Activism as Participatory Politics: The Case of the Harry Potter Alliance” (chapter 3) and Burwell and Boler’s “Rethinking Media Activism through Fan Blogging: How Stewart and Colbert Fans Make a Difference” (chapter 7). Emergent forms of fan activism represent novel and quintessential examples of DIY citizenship. While activism has of course existed in myriad forms long before the advent of digital and social media, we are witnessing a sea change (one with which scholars can barely keep apace) in the blurring of the social and political, the political and personal. Global, and ubiquitous popular cultural engagement alongside participatory media enables unprecedented accessibility to the means of production and circulation, resulting in unpredictable and emergent forms of hybrid fandom. “While many other forms of DIY culture have sought to establish autonomy from mainstream culture, fandom exists at the intersection of grassroots and commercial media,” writes Henry Jenkins. These chapters contribute innovative studies of how hybrid fandom constitutes new modes of civic engagement and redefines participatory politics.The globally networked fans united by popular cultural productions reflect DIY “maktivist” identities and definitively blur traditional distinctions between the social and political. In contrast to traditional conceptions of activism, fan-based activists of the Harry Potter Alliance (Jenkins) and The Daily Show and The Colbert Report (Burwell and Boler) characterize the emergence of distinct, fan-based “maker identities.” In the opening of chapter 3, Jenkins writes, “Fan cultures have long been cited as textbook examples of the larger phenomenon of DIY media production, and fan activism represents an exemplar of the\n\n26\n\nPart I\n\nways that such creative communities might evolve their own models of political and civic participation.” Jenkins’s (chapter 3) description details the close relationship between commercial ownership and grassroots. Indeed, this tension between corporate ownership and values and interventionist DIY ethos animates all of the practices considered in this part. Historically, fans have often entered civic discourse when they assert their collective rights as the most active and engaged segments of the media audience. While many other forms of DIY culture have sought to establish autonomy from mainstream culture, fandom exists at the intersection between grassroots and commercial media. Given this unstable positioning, the fan identity is often an embattled one, and efforts to save shows from cancellation or to rally support for a film project have helped to cement social ties between fans, define their shared interests, and shape their public status. By the time these fan groups had defined an issue, identified decision makers, developed tactics, and educated and mobilized supporters, they had done all of the steps required for activism. (emphasis added)\n\nIn her chapter on feminist zines, Chidgey (chapter 6) also notes the centrality of the intersection of commercial and grassroots in contemporary activist practices: As a form of alternative media, zines inevitably create different modes of production, representation, and consumption to those found in mainstream media industries. Yet they’re not entirely separate entities—the skills learned through DIY media making can be brought into makers’ professional lives and zinesters often appropriate and reuse materials from popular culture in their publications. As social documents of lived experience and cultural ephemera, zines are increasingly finding their way out of fringe communities and into libraries, archives, publishing houses, and classrooms. They provide excellent sites of narration around grassroots and DIY political identities, activism, and agendas.\n\nDIY activities constitute modes of political intervention undertheorized by current concepts of civic engagement such as that of the public sphere. The chapters in part I thus serve both as sites for examining DIY and activism as well as arguments about new ways to conceptualize modern politics. As Burwell and Boler (chapter 7) conclude on this point: By thinking about fan practices of making (archives, blogs, websites, networks, communities), we also came to see that fans worked to make a difference (to other fans, to media power differentials, to untenable political situations) and to make sense (of technological change, of unreliable media accounts, of a world gone mad). In a project dedicated to “rethinking” media, politics, and citizenship, the questions that fan production generated constantly pushed us to rethink fundamental building blocks of contemporary citizenship practices and what counts as “political” engagement.\n\nDIY and Activism\n\n27\n\nTwo chapters in part I address the challenges of “leveling the playing field” of access to and confidence with tools of activism. Dunbar-Hester (chapter 4) describes the challenges faced by the Pandora Radio Project: The media activists sought to cultivate a particular mode of “maker” identity. They presented technical engagement as a strategy for leveling expertise and increasing political participation. In this, they recognized that tinkering is as much a form of cultural production as a technical one; the activists sought to produce not just technical artifacts but egalitarian social relations by eroding boundaries between experts and laypeople. Activists suggested that demystification of technology through widespread hands-on making could provide an alternative to prevalent technical cultures in which authority is not distributed but resides exclusively with experts.\n\nJust as this collective struggled with the unequal social capital and hence confidence with which participants approached the creative activist possibilities, so does Reilly (chapter 8) emphasize the challenge of encouraging more populist and widespread DIY engagement of Yes Men media hoax tactics and practices: [Could] everyday citizens . . . replicate the Yes Men’s successes, or [are] figures like Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno . . . truly exceptional individuals who pulled off hoaxes far beyond the reach of the uninitiated[?] . . . In a time of real political foment, the Yes Men are now training and mentoring groups to participate in the creation of media spectacles designed to highlight social justice issues and political struggles of great civic importance. The Yes Lab offers a bridge between the media hoaxing actions of a much-revered group and DIY citizens and groups who lack the knowledge, wherewithal, or infrastructure to see these hoaxes to fruition. The effort marks an important shift in their work, demonstrating how an already successful mode of activism can be taken up to facilitate the transmission and reproducibility of inspiring work. What have the Yes Men taught me? If there’s no application process to participating, we should really just do it ourselves. (emphasis added)\n\nReferences Boler, M. 2013.

Maktivism brings together the technology and media-technology activists as discussed by Milberry (chapter 2, this volume) and Dunbar-Hester (chapter 4, this volume); content-activists, as discussed by Jenkins (chapter 3,this volume), Chidgey (chapter 6, this volume), and Burwell and Boler (chapter 7, this volume); policy-activists, as discussed by McPhail et al. (chapter 5, this volume); and artists as discussed by Reilly (chapter 8, this volume). As such, Maktivism is not just making things that change/preserve/save the world/planet. A Maktivist is a maker who is authentic—not a poseur (Bricmont and Sokal 1998) or someone just following a trend or doing it for money, to get tenure, or to be popular. A Maktivist has a high degree of personal involvement and commitment in the existemological (existential epistemology, i.e., “learn-by-being” [Mann 2006]) sense. DIY maktivism was introduced in Toronto in 1998 by way of two courses: ECE1766 and ECE385—making material things and hacking GNU Linux device drivers to make those material things work in an Open Source cloud-computing mobile/portable/smartphone environment. The emphasis was on “tinquiry” (tinkering as inquiry) and spontaneous participatory “hacks” using found objects, in contrast to the more “professionalized,” organized, and carefully planned approach to engineering that other professors usually teach. In this framework, examples I used to teach “tinquiry” included a chair that had spikes that only retracted when a credit card was inserted in order to download a “License to Sit” (Mann 2001c); and Griefcase™, a briefcase equipped with a fingerprint scanner that can be opened by anyone other than its owner. Both these projects taught DIY “hacking” principles—each student obtained a surplus card reader and fingerprint scanner, and was taught how to reverse engineer these products and write GNU Linux device drivers for them. Griefcase was designed for encounters with security guards\n\n30\n\nChapter 1\n\nwho demand to search briefcases upon exiting public libraries. The case included ﬁngerprint scanners and wireless communications, arranged in such a way that the owner could not open the case, but anyone else could. In order for the owner of the case to submit to being searched, then, the guard had to submit to being ﬁngerprinted (see figure 1.1; picture Copyleft S. Mann, 2000). Over the past fourteen years, by way of these maktivism courses, I’ve taught hundreds of students how to salvage computers from dumpsters, how to hack ID card readers, fingerprint scanners, smartphones, etc., and how to write GNU Linux device drivers and cloud-based computing applications for surplus junk. My aim has been to teach technology as “intervention by users, rather than a mysterious black box” (Milberry, chapter 2, this volume), in order to “resist” the hegemony of what would otherwise be surveillance technologies (Milberry 2012). This understanding of the normally closed-source world of surveillance technologies aims to “liberat[e] human beings from all circumstances that enslave them” (Horkheimer 1982, 244)—opening up the “black boxed technologies hidden within contemporary identification practices” (McPhail et al., chapter 5, this volume). Maktivism often involves the moral, ethical, and lawful (“white hat”) elements of the “hacker” ethos, but not necessarily the illegal “cracker” ethos. Maktivism combines the DIY (do-it-yourself) ethos of home renovation with the DIT (do-it-together) ethos of the GNU Linux and Free Software movement. In that spirit, this chapter you are now reading was written using LaTeX on a computer running GNU Linux, rather than Microsoft Word, partly\n\nFigure 1.1 Griefcase\n\nMaktivism\n\n31\n\nbecause Microsoft is so anti-DIY, that many of us are opposed to Word on moral and ethical grounds, and partly because Word does not produce good results when compared to typesetting programs like LaTeX, which evolved in and of a more open scientific spirit. LaTeX is Open Source and constitutes a DIY effort created as part of the hobbyist DIY community that also built GNU Linux. In this sense, the very way this chapter itself was written embodies the (“white hat”) hacktivist ethos (Milberry and Anderson 2009). Maktivism and hacktivism are not the same thing, however, in that maktivism necessarily involves materiality, or matter (i.e., that which has mass and occupies space, e.g., solids, liquids, and gases), and is therefore not limited to merely writing or modifying computer programs. In short, thoughts matter, but also matter matters. As Madonna would phrase it, “You know that we are living in a material word. And I am a material girl.” With the rise of the World Wide Web, we have increasingly been living in the post-material word, in which material thinking and materiality or physicality has given way to abstract concepts like cyberspace and cyborg space. But we have now come full circle, though, back to what I call the “post-post-material age” or “post-cyborg age,” wherein we must combine the material (physical) and the immaterial (computational) worlds. A good “motto” by which the maktivist should live, then, is “Advancing Technology for Humanity,” which is also the tagline of the world’s largest technical society, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). In slightly different words, the IEEE “stands at the forefront of technological change for the betterment of humanity” (Advancing Technology for Humanity 2013). Its 2013 International Symposium on Techology and Society is also consistent with this goal (2013 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society). In this framework, maktivism is understood through praxistemology (Mann 2012b) as having three components, not unlike a tripod, which is supported on all three of the following “legs,” denoted, for brevity, as Praxis (P); Existentiality (E); and Questioning/inquiry/critique/study (Q). 1. Praxis: Praxis, from the Greek word “praxis,” “practice,” “action,” “making,” or “doing,” refers to the materially physical practice of action, doing, making, or the like. Specifically, praxis is the particular kind of action, doing, or making typically found in the field of engineering: “Scientists think, engineers make” (Karl et al. 2012). Heidegger laid the foundation for thinking about the relationship between technology and materiality/matter that led to some of the projects I was involved with at MIT (e.g., “Things That Think,” “Bits and Atoms”),\n\n32\n\nChapter 1\n\nas well as more recent variations on this theme, such as the “Internet of Things.” While we were studying under Professor Stephen Benton (the inventor of white-holography) at MIT, one of my classmates, Paula Dawson, was in the midst of creating some of the world’s best examples of Material Thinking, for example, holographic artworks like “To Absent Friends” (Dawson 2012). Examples of this “Material Thinking” (in the Heideggerian-sense [Bolt 2007; de Freitas 2009]) form the core of what is taught in University of Toronto’s first-year Engineering Sciences courses entitled Praxis I and Praxis II (http://www.praxis.uoftengineering.com/). I must also emphasize here that there is something refreshingly authentic about the Material Thinking community in New Zealand in particular—their papers are all available online without the need for registration, login, or paying a fee—demonstrating the true authenticity of maktivism. This brings me to the second leg of my “tripod” model. 2. Existentiality: Existentiality embodies three important attributes: (1) existence before essence, i.e., the opposite of problem-solving (Whereas Plato first envisioned a circle in terms of a collection of points equidistant from another point, and then reduced it to practice, I believe we should also allow room for doing the opposite, to be willing to tinker, or build something, first, and then figure out what it is or what it can be useful for afterward. It is possible that some of these things may never be useful in any traditional sense. We should be willing to just tinker without having to make a plan and a Gantt Chart first.); (2) self-determination and mastery over one’s own destiny, through personal commitment, involvement, and experience, including “learn-by-being,” such as wearable computing as a way of learning about computers by “being” a computer; and (3) authenticity as connected with creativity, i.e., being true to one’s self. An example of what I mean by authenticity is an engineer who loves engineering, rather than an engineer working for just money or from a sense of duty. As Einstein has said, “love [of a subject of study or of one’s work] is a better master than duty.” This also means being true (authentic) to one’s self, rather than being driven by trends or fashions. The opposite of this is a “poseur,” or a person who works or studies in a particular field because it is fashionable, trendy, or pays well. Praxistemology is not merely transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, or cross-disciplinary work, but, rather, trans/inter/cross-passionary. To paraphrase Einstein, passion is a better master than discipline! Sartre and Kafka help us understand (often by way of negative examples) existence, freedom, and authenticity. Moreover, Goethe’s “Faust” prompts us to ask, should we, as academics, bow to peer-review and peer-acceptance—or hold to our principles, be they LaTeX, Linux, free\n\nMaktivism\n\n33\n\nonline publishing, or community gardening? Authenticity favors an Artistic/Academic/humanistic integrity (“A” integrity) over the Business/Bookie integrity (“B” integrity) of a mafia boss who makes deals with a handshake and always honors his word. 3. Questioning: Questioning refers to work with an epistemological or pedagogical element that asks important moral and ethical questions, that is, it embodies critique in the tradition more commonly associated with the arts than with old-school engineering. To quote James Baldwin: “The purpose of art is to lay bare the questions that have been hidden by the answers.” Some notable “questioners” include the following: Leonardo da Vinci was said to be the best engineer of his time. But he was more than just a problem solver. He was also an artist, scientist, and inventor. The journal Leonardo (www.leonardo.info/isast/leostory.html) honors this, and is now the leading journal for the application of contemporary science and technology to the arts. Marvin Minsky is the father of AI (artificial intelligence) (Laplante 1996). Additionally, he also invented the confocal scanning microscope and many other useful inventions. But Minsky had an amazingly deep understanding of all aspects of the human condition. My favorite of his inventions was something that has become known as “the most useless machine ever,” which he built at Bell Labs with Claude Shannon. The machine consisted of a box with an on/off switch on the outside. Whenever the switch is turned on, the box opens and a robotic hand reaches out to turn the switch off. Remarkably, the machine’s sole purpose is to turn itself off! Arthur Ganson, a sculptor with MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, makes artworks with existentialist themes. For lack of a better word I’d call him a “praxistentialist”—one who engages in the practice of embodied existentialism. One piece in particular which speaks to this theme is entitled “Machine with Concrete.” In this piece, a motor is geared down through a series of gears, each turning more slowly (and more forcefully) than the one before it. The last gear is fixed in a block of concrete. Albert Einstein contends that “the point is to develop the childlike inclination for play and the childlike desire for recognition and to guide the child over to important fields for society. Such a school demands from the teacher that he be a kind of artist” (Einstein 1954/1982, 63). As such, Einstein notes further, “the pursuit of truth and beauty is a sphere of activity in which we are permitted to remain children all our lives.” What separates children from many adults, then, is authenticity (“A” integrity) versus professionalism (“B” integrity). Professionalism is a necessary and important part of society in many fields like dentistry or safety\n\n34\n\nChapter 1\n\ncertification of bridges, skyscrapers, and aircraft. But there is, or should be, room in the world for “children” like Einstein, that is, for people with “A” integrity. Engineering schools and other universities should encourage fun, frolic, and unstructured play as means for invention of new technologies, as well as new ways of looking at technology and society! In this sense, a praxistemologist is an “inventopher” (inventor philosopher) (Mann and Janzen 2012) with a playful childlike scientific spirit like Einstein. “A” integrity is Einstein’s spirit-reduced-to-practice/praxis. The inventopher combines thinking with making, thus embodying a social awareness of making, such as that fostered by organizations like the IEEE SSIT. As they note, “Scientists think; engineers make.” Engineering is fundamentally an activity, as opposed to an intellectual discipline. The goal of science and philosophy is to know; the goal of engineering is to do something good or useful. . . . It took until the mid-20th century for engineers to develop the kind of self-awareness that leads to thinking about engineering and technology as they relate to society. Until about 1900, most engineers felt comfortable in a “chain-of-command” structure in which the boss—whether it be a military commander, a corporation, or a wealthy individual—issued orders that were to be carried out to the best of the engineer’s technical ability. Fulfillment of duty was all that was expected. But as the range and depth of technological achievements grew, engineers, philosophers, and the public began to realize that we had all better take some time and effort to think about the social implications of technology. That is the purpose of the IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology (SSIT): to provide a forum for discussion of the deeper questions about the history, connections, and future trends of engineering, technology and society. (Karl et al. 2012)\n\nOthers have also proposed the combination of thinking and making, which is known as “Material Thinking” (Bolt 2007; de Freitas 2009) or “Critical Making” (Ratto 2011), or, if it contains a political element, “Hacktivism” (Boler 2008). In some sense, maktivism, and its academic counterpart, praxistemology, can be thought of as authentic and self-involved forms of material thinking or critical making. Praxistemology is an attempt to create a(n) (un)discipline that is simultaneously both broad and deep, across design, art, sustainism/science, technology, engineering (inventing and making things), and mathematics (of which I regard music/musicology as a branch), plus in some sense a kind of “boundless boundlessness.” DASTEM: STEM is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. A major thrust in the agenda of public education is integrating these four subject areas. Other interdisciplinary efforts like those of MIT’s Media Laboratory focus on AST (Arts+Science+Technology). I coined\n\nMaktivism\n\n35\n\nthe term “DASTEM” to denote Design + Art + Science/Sustainism + Technology + Engineering/Environment/Enterprise + Mathematics/Music/Musicology to highlight the importance of design. I regard Sustainism as a branch of science, along the lines of organizations like Science for Peace (www. scienceforpeace.ca) that address through environmentalism, nuclear weapons, greenhouse gas, climate change, and the like. Moreover, publications like Leonardo, the aforementioned journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology (ISTAST), also combine these subjects. There is also a festival called the Festival of Art, Science, and Technology (FAST) (www.arts.mit.edu/fast). A DASTEMist is not merely a “T-shaped” or “tee-shaped” thinker (breadth + depth in only one area), but actually what I call a “tree-shaped” thinker or a person with “tree-shaped” skill sets that have broad-reaching rhizomic roots, combined with deep-reaching roots into many fields of study, plus skyward reaching branches. DAST could then put a “heart and soul” into the “STEM,” for example, going beyond “multidisciplinary” to something I call “multipassionary” or “interpassionary” or “transpassionary,” that is, passion is a better master than discipline (Albert Einstein said that “love is a better master than duty”). Passion means personal involvement (“A” integrity), like we often see in the DIY social movement, which is about personal empowerment. But that personal involvement often comes through group efforts and from being citizens rather than merely consumers (Levy and Bonomo 1999; Jenkins 2009). Thus DIY is typically really DIT, so maybe it should just be called “do it” (individually and collectively)! Mens et manus: Minsky and Ganson are both associated with MIT. Many schools have a Latin motto that is often just to sound scholarly but without meaning very much. MIT’s motto, however, “Mens et manus,” is Latin for “Mind and hand.” This is the blend of praxis and theory that I think we need to encourage and further develop. Copyleft: In addition to MIT’s blend of praxis and theory, there’s a third branch: inquiry or critique. We have in the preceding examples a playful sense of awe and wonder, and an inquiry/critique. As an example of the latter, consider Richard Stallman’s notion of “copyleft.” Stallman’s philosophy, which emphasizes open access, formed the basis for Wikipedia and Linux. As the playful reversal of “copyright,” copyleft forms a critique of the power relationships of intellectual property. This is yet another example of deep thinking combined with action and, in particular, the primacy of “A” integrity over “B” integrity.\n\n36\n\nChapter 1\n\nGNU/Linux: Richard Stallman (GNU) and Linus Torvalds (Linux) created one of the highest-profile success stories for DIY volunteer-driven hobbyistdriver collaboration—creating what is perhaps the world’s most reliable and capable operating system. Wikipedia: Jimmy Wales built directly upon Richard Stallman’s concept of inverse copyright, or “copyleft,” to create Wikipedia, the “largest and most popular general reference work on the Internet,” with “23 million articles, over 4.1 million in the English Wikipedia alone . . . collaboratively [written] by volunteers around the world. Almost all of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the site, . . . [there are] editions of Wikipedia in 285 languages. . . . having an estimated 365 million readers worldwide. In 2011, Wikipedia received an estimated 2.7 billion monthly page views from the United States alone.” Lawrence Lessig is an American professor and political activist known for advocating balanced copyright and trademark laws (Wikipedia.org) that place “A” integrity ahead of “B” integrity. This integrity informs his opinion on politics: “Politics is a rare sport where the amateur is better than the professional” (Johnson 2011). WebCite: Gunther Eysenbach envisioned doing for recipients (scholars reading and citing information) what Wikipedia envisioned for transmitients (authors wishing to give away their writings for free). Eysenbach’s initiative, WebCite, enables ephemeral online documents to be reliably cited in scholarly literature (Eysenbach 2008). Praxistemologicality: I now express, in my own opinion, an approximate degree of Praxism, Existentiality, and ’Quiry in three of the foregoing examples. These “ratings” (opinions) are not meant to be scientifically precise, but, rather, merely to convey, with visual simplicity, an opinion that these great achievements are all high in Praxism, somewhat high in Existentiality, and very high in inQuiry/critiQue/epistemology/pedagogy. Namely, they were each created of their creator’s own volition, not to solve a problem that was presented to the creator by an employee or by social trends and fashions. In this way the work can be considered to be authentic (i.e., not the work of an employee or a poseur driven by job requirements or by trends or fashion). Of these examples, I believe that 1. “Machine with Concrete” exhibits the strongest Praxis (not surprising, given that Ganson is an incredible sculptor and craftsman); 2. “Copyleft” exhibits strongest Existentiality. Not only does Richard Stallman “walk the walk” of Freedom, but the concept of freedom itself has, in many ways, laid the foundation for GNU, Linux, Wikipedia, and much of\n\nMaktivism\n\n37\n\nthe Free World. Those familiar with Sartre and Kafka will no doubt see that Stallman has a strong sensibility and sensitivity to these issues. 3. “Useless Machine” exhibits the strongest Question; in that it is perhaps the most pure and simple example that can be used in teaching. When I showed all three projects to my five-year-old daughter, she told me she really wants (and needs!) a Useless Machine. The epistemological power of Useless Machine for pedagogy is its universality—immediately understood—and appreciated by people of all ages or disciplines. LBB (learn-by-being): Where the foregoing three examples could be stronger, however, was in their sense of existentiality. Existentiality speaks to authenticity and freedom, as well as to “being.” “Being,” in this sense, includes teaching children how to measure something, using anthropomorphic units, or measurements based on the human body, such as are inches (width of the thumb) and feet, or “hands”—the units used to measure the height of horses. The human body itself becomes the ruler! When we learn about rulers and measurement by becoming the measurement instrument, I call this “learn-by-being” (Mann and Janzen 2012). I tell my five-year-old that when we’re planting flowers in the garden, we’re going to use inches and feet to determine seed spacing, but if we were building a nuclear reactor we might want to use angstroms or nanometers. A garden is a fun place to be, where a lot of learning can take place, and mistakes can be made without grave consequences. The very inaccuracy of anthropomorphic units, especially when used across various age groups, is why “learn-by-being” is so powerful as a teaching tool. It teaches children that it is OK to make mistakes, to take guesses, and to get a rough imprecise understanding of the world around us in our own special units (e.g., our own feet, despite the fact that we all differ). Making measurements in this way exercises all three elements of praxistemology: putting into practice a personal involvement in the epistemology of measurement. LBB then, can be summarized by considering a chronology of learning methodologies: Q Traditional book-learning; P Learn-by-doing, e.g., constructionism, constructivism, PBL (project/ problem-based-learning); E Learn-by-being, existential education, existemology (existential epistemology). The foregoing examples attempt to illustrate what is meant by praxistemology. It is instructive to also include some examples of what is not praxistemology, via the use of negative examples.\n\n38\n\nChapter 1\n\nNegative example 1: An armchair critic. This is a person who is not engaged in praxis. Negative example 2: A worker in a fast-food environment. Such a person often does the work out of a sense of duty and may be less personally involved. There is some degree of practice and craft but a lesser degree of existentiality and inquiry. I am not saying that such practice is of lesser value than other practices—indeed, it may be quite useful to society. I am simply saying that such practice is not praxistemology. Negative example 3: An engineering professor in it for the money. Whereas such a professor may design labs (praxis) and do teaching (’quiry), there can be a lack of authenticity and personal job-transcending involvement. Negative example 4: Bandwagon hacktivist. Political activism and hacking have both become quite fashionable. Numerous “hacker spaces” have emerged to fill a need for people who want to enter the world of hacking. Publications like Make Magazine have begun to take on military funding and are not as “pure” in their pursuit as they once were. Again, I am not saying all hacktivists lack authenticity—there are obviously some who do—but the numbers of followers have grown tremendously as the “hacker” or “maker” tradition has entered the mainstream, and a surface vivacity of “authenticity” (authenticity as in “handmade”— not in the deeper aforementioned sense) has become fashionable. Praxistemology is like the tripod I previously mentioned: it cannot stand up unless all three of the legs (P, E, and Q) are sufficiently present. In this next section, I describe examples from my own practice of inventions that I hope are authentic attempts at inquiry. Wearable computing: During my childhood, back in the 1970s (when computers were usually massive machines that required large computer rooms) I was, as far as I know, one of only two children in our city (Hamilton, Ontario) to own a computer. It was one of the first “microcomputers.” I attached it to myself as a prosthetic extension of my mind and body. For more than thirty years, I have lived my everyday life in a computer-mediated world. The pictures below document various stages of my “Augmediated Reality” work that ran from the 1970s to the present. In the 1970s and 1980s, people thought it was a crazy idea to have a body-borne computer. But when I took these inventions and ideas to MIT in the early 1990s to start a wearable computing project, people eventually began to see the merit in wearable computing. I’ve been recognized as “the\n\nMaktivism\n\n39\n\nfather of wearable computing” (Mitchell 2013), and wearable computing is now a multi-billion-dollar industry. But I was not motivated by money or by trying to solve a specific problem. Instead, my wearable computer emerged more from tinkering than from planning.1 License to sit: Wearable computing brought me directly in touch with a sociopolitical inquiry on intellectual property. With wearable computing, the computer becomes very much a part of the mind and body, and after more than thirty years of having a computer be part of my body, I no longer really distinguish between “thinking” and “computing” (Mann 2001b, 2006). Moreover, in the world of computing, software is often protected by patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and the like. In the world of wearable computing these restrictions can have the effect of creating “thought crimes.” For example, if I think of the square root of a number, and part of my “brain” comprises silicon chips, can my thoughts end up being illegal if they drift toward patentable subject matter? When we use computing as part of our bodies, then not only are parts of our bodies owned by licensors, but the licensors control what we can do with our bodies and also can become “thought police.” Computer programs are often protected by floating licenses, and each license is called a “seat.” If you manage a large computer network, you might install a “lic"
