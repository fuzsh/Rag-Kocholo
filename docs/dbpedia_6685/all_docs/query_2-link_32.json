        "text": "(Toronto, January, 23, 2024) 2024 will mark the 25th anniversary for JMIR Publications, the leading open access digital health research publisher. Founded in 1999 by Gunther Eysenbach, MD, MPH, FACMI, chief executive officer and executive editor, JMIR Publications has grown to now include 35 journals that have published over 52,000 papers that have garnered over 500,000 citations and millions of views from users around the world.\n\nJMIR Publications functions as a hub for digital health research. With its reputation for high-quality publications, the 35 published journals have offered clinicians, patients, researchers, entrepreneurs, and policy makers a window into best practices and current evidence for digital health. The content of the papers have evolved over the years and todayâ€™s papers often focus on machine learning, virtual reality, smartphone apps, and other topics that were nonexistent or nascent in health care research in 1999 when the flagship journal, Journal of Medical Internet Research, began.\n\nOver the years, JMIR Publications has adapted with changes in the way people access, share, and read research papers. New innovations such as the new JMIRx journal series (\"superjournals\" or overlay journals for Preprint servers), highlight JMIR Publications ongoing efforts to further expand the form of its academic research journals towards an open science platform to include medical, biological, and psychological science topics.\n\nIn 2024 and beyond JMIR Publications looks forward to furthering their mission focused on advancing towards a world where people are empowered by health research and technology to make effective, informed decisions, take control of their health and well-being, and live happier and healthier lives.\n\nTo celebrate the 25th anniversary, JMIR Publications has special events planned throughout the year, including a theme issue titled 25 Years of Digital Health Excellence: Reflecting on Transformative Technologies, Interventions, Methods, and Policy Issues. JMIR Publications invites original contributions in the form of review articles and viewpoint papers that delve into the various facets of digital health. The issue is open for submissions now. The full details and submission guidelines for the call for papers are available here.\n\nGunther Eysenbach is available for interviews.\n\nAbout JMIR Publications\n\nJMIR Publications is a renowned publisher with a long-standing commitment to advancing digital health research. Our portfolio includes a wide array of open-access, peer-reviewed journals dedicated to the dissemination of high-quality research in the field of digital health.
