        "text": "In November, 2015, a group of publishers asked ORCID to help facilitate communications about their plans to require authors to use an ORCID iD, including hosting an open letter explaining their rationale, developing best practices for using iDs in publishing, and maintaining the signatory list. The publishers’ goal was to encourage others to join them in supporting the adoption of ORCID. Publishers that signed this open letter committed to requiring ORCID iDs following specific implementation standards. While all publishing organizations were welcome to sign the letter, an Effective Date is only shown in the table below for those who demonstrate that their use of ORCID meets our best practices.\n\nRead more in ORCID Open Letter – One Year On Report.\n\nWhy Require ORCID?\n\nORCID provides a digital name – or iD – that uniquely and persistently identifies researchers and other contributors to the research effort. By connecting this iD to different research activities and affiliations across multiple research information platforms, ORCID helps enable recognition and reduces the reporting burden for researchers. It also enhances the discovery process and lays the foundation for trust in a digital research environment. Crossref’s Auto-Update functionality – which (with researcher permission) updates an author’s ORCID record when the author uses their iD during the publishing process – further benefits researchers by alleviating the need to re-enter publication data in multiple systems. Importantly, it also provides an independent assertion of the connection between the author and their work.\n\nWith well over 7,000 journals already collecting ORCID iDs from corresponding authors, through all major manuscript submission systems, publishers are in a unique position to facilitate widespread adoption of ORCID. Indeed, researchers are most likely to encounter ORCID in publishing systems: about 75% of registrations occur because journals are asking authors to include their ORCID in new submissions. Researchers are also increasingly encountering ORCID in their university systems, and many funders now recommend or require the use of ORCID in their grant application systems.\n\nImplementation Standard\n\nORCID provided implementation guidelines for publishers who wished to sign the letter. The following minimum standard of implementation was to ensure the collection of ORCID IDs is efficient, adheres to best practices, and ultimately reduces the burden on researchers:\n\nRequire. ORCID iDs are required for corresponding authors of published papers, with the understanding that ORCID iD collection should be enabled as an option for all authors and should ideally take place at submission.\n\nCollect. The collection of ORCID iDs is done via the ORCID API (authenticated ORCID iDs), meaning that authors are not asked to type in or search for their iD.\n\nAuto-update. Publisher Crossref DOI metadata is updated to include ORCID iDs for authors, so that Crossref Auto-update can be implemented. The ORCID iD DOI metadata includes the attribute indicating whether the iD was collected using the API (authenticated).\n\nPublish. Author/co-author ORCID iDs are embedded into article metadata, at least in online versions, and ideally in print versions of the publication. At a minimum the ORCID iD logo should be displayed next to the name of each author who has connected their iD; in online versions and metadata, the author name should be hyperlinked to the appropriate ORCID iD directly or via a landing page.\n\nSignatories\n\nWe, the following journals and publishers shall be requiring ORCID iDs for authors, according to the best practices laid out above. We hope that our action inspires the community, including researchers, research funders, and research institutions, to join us in adopting ORCID and making it easy for researchers to connect their iD to their contributions and affiliations."
