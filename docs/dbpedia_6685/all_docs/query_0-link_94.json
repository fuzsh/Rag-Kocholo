        "text": "I attended the CHLA conference a couple of weeks ago and was thoroughly refreshed and inspired by the program. I will share some of the highlights over a few blog postings.\n\nOne of the most fascinating speakers was Dr. Eddy Lang, who gave a most insightful key note entitled: Information Science in the Evidence Based Era: Meeting the Perceived and Unperceived needs of Evidence Consumers. He is an eminent academic emergency physician and researcher who is passionately interested in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) and Knowledge Translation (KT).\n\nSome of the gems from his talk included four scenarios of when evidence would be needed in clinical practice and what the gaps might be.\n\nTreating a 25 year old female in the emergency ward with anxiety attack and symptos of a pulmonary embolism. Should you recommend a CAT scan or not? A CAT scan delivers a high amount of unnecessary radiation. To make a decision, the physician needs access to a validated decision tool – the pulmonary embolism rule out criteria – which may establish that in fact, the embolism is not the primary problem and preempt unnecessary radiation exposure. Physicians lack the the skills to find this information at the point of need during critical decision points.\n\nA resident presenting on atrial fibrillation excluded key onging trials within Calgary – found in the Clinical Trials.gov site\n\nIn developing clinical tools such as orders sets, health professionals lack embedded decision support for levels of evidence.\n\nDrawing on Alison Brettle’s study, Dr. Lang identified 4 models of clinical librarian integration that can help physicians access information at the point of need:\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nQuestions and Answers + Critical appraisal\n\nOutreach: proactively engaging and embedding librarians\n\nOutreach + Critical appraisal + Synthesis\n\nCredits\n\n“Evidence stamp” from http://clinicigo.wordpress.com/home/\n\nWhy is primary care so important?\n\n“Primary care is the first point of contact a person has with the health system – the point where people receive care for most of their everyday health needs. Primary care is the first point of contact a person has with the health system – the point where people receive care for most of their everyday health needs. Primary care is typically provided by family physicians, and by nurses, dietitians, mental health professionals, pharmacists, therapists, and others” (What is primary care?)\n\nDivisions of Family Practice\n\nUnder the auspices of the General Practice Service Committee, the Divisions of Family Practice was designed to both improve patient care and address family doctors’ influence on health care and professional satisfaction. Family doctors in a community organize themselves into a non-profit to work towards common health care goals. They are able to receive funding towards their initiatives.\n\nI learned about this initiative when I listened to a presentation made to seniors by the White Rock South Surrey Division. One of the first of three to be established in BC, this division seeks to improve:\n\npopulation health\n\nthe patient/provider experience\n\nsystem sustainability\n\nI was impressed that this division of 73 members has 3 staff members. Their programs promote enhanced hospital care, local citizens’ access to a family doctor (through the attachment initiative), recruitment of additional doctors to ease the shortage and continuing education programs for doctors.\n\nTheir key initiative is the Primary Care Access Clinic which supports unattached patients (lacking a family doctor) who require care upon discharge from Peace Arch Hospital. The clinic is staffed by a multidisciplinary team which includes nurse practitioners, mental health care staff and social workers and home health workers who can refer patients to needed services and monitor complex cases.\n\nWhen I mentioned this interesting model to a pharmacist colleague, he had an interesting comment. He said that progressive practices will usually recognize the need to have nurse practioners, social workers…but for some reason, they don’t seem to see the need for a pharmacist. This is partly because pharmacists are often perceived as retail, business rather than clinical specialists. In addition, the physician-pharmacist interactions tend to be negative because pharmacists will usually only call physicians with bad news – that they made a mistake.\n\nWith 24 divisions, the Divisions of Family Practice model seems to be really taking off and advancing primary care. Their progressive and patient-centric approach is extremely important and they can be important allies in promoting health literacy and other key but often-neglected patient oriented interventions. However, is my colleague right – that they are failing to include pharmacists in their care teams? What are pharmacists doing to improve their interactions with and perceptions by physicians?\n\nLast week, the BC government announced a $68.7-million Healthy Families BC strategy to “help families make healthy choices and introduce innovative approaches to challenges facing the health care system.”\n\nThe first program of this strategy is the $24-million Prescription for Health program intended to equip B.C. doctors with tools to assess and work with patients to develop a health promotion and illness prevention plan appropriate for them. The key elements of the program include the following:\n\nPrescription for Health is available to patients with at least one of these risk factors: smoking; unhealthy eating; physical inactivity and medical obesity.\n\nPatients can identify a lifestyle change goal, which will be documented by the physician on a Prescription for Health.\n\nThe patient’s Prescription for Health may refer them to free-of-charge lifestyle programs to help patients achieve their individual lifestyle change goals. Examples of lifestyle support resources: the Physical Activity Line, Dietitian Services at HealthLink BC, QuitNow Services, a tobacco-cessation service and information resource, the Patient Voices Network peer coaching program.\n\nAs an incentive, 50,000 participating patients can receive up to $50 toward programs that support their goals: gym membership, physical activity programs or nutritional programs.\n\nFor more information on Healthy Families BC or Prescription for Health, please visit www.healthyfamiliesbc.ca\n\nI consider this a significant leap away the from the traditional focus on treatment to the more cost-effective prevention strategies – potentially avoiding up to $2 billion in yearly health-care costs. Obesity alone costs up to $830 million a year to the economy. What’s really fascinating is that patients get a financial incentive – it’s a really good idea to reward good behaviour. It will be interesting to see what the uptake of the program will be like, and what outcomes will result.\n\nEarlier this year, I had the privilege of attending a Patients Voices Network (PVN) training session. PVN is a program that recruits, trains and supports patients and their families to participate in primary health care changes. For an interesting and informative overview about their work, see the video below which is also on their website.\n\nPVN provides impressive opportunities for consumer participation:\n\nAn online community or virtual network of patients that register to provide input through response to surveys\n\nActivated network of trained patients who can be involved at three levels:\n\nShaping the system: participating in focus groups, patient advisory committees and panel discussions; patient journey mapping\n\nCommunity Activation: working in patients’ local communities to improve primary health care\n\nPeer to Peer Coaching: supporting and motivating individuals to achieve healthy living goals.\n\nOne point that stood out for me was the positive approach that was emphasized by PVN. Patients’ may first be compelled to become activated members of PVN due to negative experiences with the healthcare system. While their frustration is understandable, it is important that theyare motivated by a desire to provide constructive feedback rather than hostile criticism.\n\nAnother highlight of the workshop was listening to Johanna Trimble speak about her involvement with PVN and what she has learned along the way. She had many positive experiences to relate but also cautioned participants to be balanced and acknowledge their limitations ie. not to volunteer for each and every opportunity. Johanna, a steering committee member, has spoken at international conferences about her experience with the health care system and her presentation Is Your Mom on Drugs? – Find out what to do about it” is most compelling.\n\nLast week, one of the trending twitter hash tags was #mHS10. Organised by mHealth Alliance, the 2010 mHealth summit was certainly the most galvanizing mHealth event globally – bringing together 2000 delegates from more than 38 countries. This is one of a series of posts summarizing the highlights. Other posts include Patricia Mechael’s pearls of mHealth wisdom, mHealth is not about technology, mHealth and the evidence, notable tweets and mHealth in western vs global contexts.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia,\n\n“mhealth (also written as m-health or mobile health) is a term used for the practice of medical and public health, supported by mobile devices… mHealth applications include the use of mobile devices in collecting community and clinical health data, delivery of healthcare information to practitioners, researchers, and patients, real-time monitoring of patient vital signs, and direct provision of care (via mobile telemedicine).“\n\nI was able to follow some of the sessions via live webcast but mainly relied on the informative tweets of enthusiastic tweeple/tweeps (twitterers). In the next few posts, I will capture memorable tweets and my thoughts and reflections.\n\nPluses\n\nThe conference was graced by such remarkable and influential thought leaders as Bill Gates and Ted Turner. It drew speakers from respected organizations like Rockefeller foundation – which lends important credibility and visibility to the growing mHealth field.\n\nThe experts represented diverse areas: public and private; technology and health; rural and urban; policy makers, practitioners and academics. Such rich multisector dialogue with the resulting cross fertilization of ideas has promise of systemic impact.\n\nDespite its huge size, the summit provided an ideal forum for different players to share ideas and lessons learned. The global health arena is highly prone to fragmented and uncoordinated interventions fraught with wasteful duplication rather than productive collaboration. mHealth Alliance’s Health Unbound was promoted as precisely the forum to promote knowledge sharing and collaboration in the mHealth community.\n\nThe conference afforded the rare opportunity to address the potential of mHealth in both western and global contexts:\n\n@downeym New #mHealth trend in the developing world – extending clinic into remote villages via mobile tools & health workers. – @pbiondich #mHS10\n\nRT @AIDSgov: At #mHS10, we’re exploring how mobile technology can improve domestic HIV programs. Read our #mHealth blog post: http://go.usa.gov/C8Z\n\nIt was particularly heartening to note the recognition that developing countries are further along in these technologies as they a) have had to be more innovative and b) have not been hindered by legacy systems which tend to interfere with the adoption of new technologies. It is a refreshing shift when the north finds positive lessons to learn from the south.\n\nMSHHealthImpact #Gates: richest countries much less innovative health-wise than middle-income countries and least developed countries. #mhs10 #globalhealth\n\nMinuses\n\nSome seasoned tweeps, notably @downeym who attended mHealth 2009 summit reported a déjà vu feeling as the same issues came up. According to @downeym, the previous summit mainly featured “doers” while the 2010 summit was dominated by “talkers”.\n\nAwareness is a good thing but there was valid concern that the summit overhyped mobile phones as the antidote to all global health problems, creating unrealistic expectations. Is mHealth yet another bandwagon that will, predictably, underdeliver?\n\nIt is challenging to meaningfully address both the global health challenges and western perspectives in the same forum because the contexts differ significantly. There may be transferable experience but the different regions have unique challenges and needs.\n\nThierry Zylberberg, Orange aptly highlighted this when making the distinction between the role of mhealth in developed and developing contexts: To the Developed world: mhealth brings more efficiency, to the Developing world: access to health. Needless to say, it is essential that the application is appropriate for the environment.\n\nRT @clarkritchie: In the US, mobiles are personal devices, but in many other cultures they are shared or communal #mhs10"
