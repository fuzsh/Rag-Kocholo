To apply to be an Editorial Board Member/Associate Editor, please apply using the form linked in this article. You should hold a PhD (or similar higher degree), have a publication track record (h-index>8), and ideally have some academic editing experience.\n\nGuest Editors & Theme Issue Proposals\n\nJMIR Publications welcomes guest editors to assemble a theme issue on a special subtopic. For more information, please visit How to guest edit a theme issue and How to suggest a theme issue.\n\nThis may be particularly interesting for workshop and conference organizers putting together a grant-funded event (eg, with invited experts) on a topic in scope for the journal. JMIR Publications can then be used as a dissemination vehicle. (Funding through grants or other sources is usually required and should be budgeted for in grant proposals. Letters of support are available from the JMIR Publications editor, if needed. Note that granting agencies such as NLM or CIHR usually want to see some sort of knowledge translation activities in workshop proposals, and have in the past funded the JMIR Publications APFs.)\n\nThe task of the guest editor(s) is generally\n\nto solicit manuscripts from colleagues concerning the selected topic,\n\nto select peer-reviewers for incoming manuscripts,\n\nto make decisions (together with the editorial board) on article revisions and acceptance, and\n\nto write an editorial for the theme issue\n\nto secure funding to sponsor the APFs for published papers (usually in the $10-20k range).\n\nAlternatively, the conference abstracts may be published in a supplement, with or without selected full papers published later in a theme issue or in regular JMIR Publications issues. See We are organizing a conference - can we publish our proceedings / abstracts in iproceedings? regarding publishing conference abstracts."
