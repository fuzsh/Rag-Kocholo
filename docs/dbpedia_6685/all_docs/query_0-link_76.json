        "text": "Chapter Preview\n\nTop\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany authors are excited by the potential impact of Health or Medicine 2.0® (e.g., Guistini, 2006: Sandars & Schroter, 2007; Boulos & Wheeler, 2007; McLean, Richards & Wardman, 2007). The terms denote the use of Web 2.0 tools in healthcare and medicine, and is part of a wider eHealth trend that is becoming increasingly important in health decisions. As more people go online, they rely on the Internet for important health information. Reports estimate that 80% of Internet American users have searched online for health information at some point in their lives (Fox, 2006; Ferguson, 2007), and a large percentage of “health seekers” indicate the web has a direct effect on the decisions they make and on their interactions with doctors (Madden & Fox, 2005). However there have been major criticisms of Medicine or Health 2.0, and policy makers need to understand how its distinct features allow improvement in patient outcomes. They are also very new concepts that are hard to define and delineate, both from eHealth in general and between the two terms themselves (Hughes, Joshi, Wareham 2008). For this reason this chapter principally uses the term Medicine 2.0 to denote both terms (Health 2.0 and Medicine 2.0), and examines it through its critical issues. Scholars note that an issues focus can potentially address the gap between research and actual practice in eHealth (Potts, 2006), and that it allows an effective common agenda between researchers, practitioners or policy makers (Amabile et al., 2001).\n\nAlthough distinct in their reach and pace of change, many of the key issues associated with Web 2.0 in Medicine 2.0® are similar to that of eHealth (Hughes, Joshi, Wareham, 2008). Four such major tensions are identified with the emergence of Web 2.0 tools in healthcare (Hughes, Joshi, Wareham, 2008): 1) Doctors’ concerns with patients’ use of Web 2.0 in Medicine, even if the information is accurate; 2) Information inaccuracy and potential risks associated with inaccurate Web 2.0 generated information; 3) The consequences of the new methods of creating eHealth, such as privacy and ownership issues with Web 2.0–generated information, or the alternative paths to achieve them and; 4) the delineation of what makes Medicine 2.0, that is not a policy instrument separate to that of eHealth, where Web 2.0’s participatory nature may imply that previous outcome measures may become misleading. While this chapter examines all four of these issues, mechanisms for dealing with the first two have already begun to emerge within the wider eHealth domain."
