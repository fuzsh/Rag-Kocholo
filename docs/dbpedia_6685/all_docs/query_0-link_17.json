        "text": "The \"Journal of Medical Internet Research\" (JMIR; ISSN 1438-8871, Medline-abbreviation: J Med Internet Res) (founded in 1999, now in its 25th year!) is a leading health informatics and health services/health policy journal (ranking in the first quartile Q1 by Impact Factor in these disciplines) focusing on digital health, data science, health informatics and emerging technologies for health, medicine, and biomedical research. The journal is ranked #1 on Google Scholar in the 'Medical Informatics' discipline.\n\nJMIR was the first open access journal covering health informatics, and the first international scientific peer-reviewed journal on all aspects of research, information and communication in the healthcare field using Internet and Internet-related technologies; a broad field, which is known as \"eHealth\" [see also What is eHealth and What is eHealth (2)], or now also \"digital health\", which includes mHealth (mobile health). This field also has significant overlaps with what is called \"consumer health informatics\", health 2.0/medicine 2.0, or participatory medicine. This focus makes JMIR unique among other medical or medical informatics journals, which tend to focus on clinical informatics or clinical applications. As eHealth/mHealth is a highly interdisciplinary field we are not only inviting research papers from the medical sciences, but also from the computer, behavioral, social and communication sciences, psychology, library sciences, informatics, human-computer interaction studies, and related fields.\n\nThe term \"Internet\" is used in its broadest sense, so we are also interested in high impact studies and applications of digital medicine, mobile technologies, social media, novel wearable devices and sensors, connected home appliances, domotics etc.\n\nThe journal invites manuscripts that deal with the following topics (the main themes/topics covered by this journal and sample papers can also be found here):\n\nnovel digital health approaches, methods, and devices\n\nlarge digital medicine / digital therapeutics trials with clinical impact\n\ndata science, open data\n\nstudies evaluating the impact of Internet/social media use or specific eHealth/mHealth interventions on individual health-related or social outcomes\n\nevaluations and implementations of innovative mhealth (mobile health) applications, social media apps, ubiquitous computing, or innovative and emerging technologies in health\n\ndescriptions of the design and impact of Internet and mobile applications and websites or social media for consumers/patients or medical professionals\n\nuse of the Internet, social media and mhealth in the context of clinical information and communication, including telemedicine\n\nuse of the Internet, social media, and mhealth in medical research and the basic sciences such as molecular biology or chemistry (e.g. bioinformatics, online factual databases)\n\nmedical information management and librarian sciences\n\ne-learning and knowledge translation, online-courses, social media, web-based and mobile programs for undergraduate and continuing education,\n\neHealth/mHealth and social media applications for public health and population health technology (disease monitoring, teleprevention, teleepidemiology)\n\nevidence-based medicine and the Internet and mhealth (e.g. online development or dissemination of clinical guidelines, measuring agreement about management of a given clinical problem among physicians, etc.)\n\nthe impact of eHealth/mHealth/pHealth/iHealth, social media, the Internet, or health care technologies on public health, the health care system and policy\n\nmethodological aspects of doing Internet/mhealth/social media research, e.g. methodology of web-based surveys\n\ndesign and validation of novel web-based instruments\n\necological momentary assessment, sensors, mobile technologies for gathering and analyzing data in real-time\n\nanalysis of e-communities, social media communities, or virtual social networks\n\ncomparisons of effectiveness of health communication and information on the Internet/mHealth/social media compared with other methods of health communication,\n\neffects of the Internet/mhealth/social media and information/communication technology on the patient-physician relationship and impact on public health, e.g. the studies investigating how the patient-physician relationship changes as a result of the new ways of getting medical information\n\nethical and legal problems as well as cross-border and cross-cultural issues of eHealth/mHealth\n\nsystematic studies examining the quality of medical information available in various online venues\n\nmethods of evaluation, quality assessment and improvement of Internet information or eHealth applications\n\nproposals for standards in the field of medical publishing on the Internet, including self-regulation issues, policies and guidelines to provide reliable healthcare information\n\nresults and methodological aspects of Internet-based and social media studies, including medical surveys, psychological tests, quality-of-life studies, gathering and/or disseminating epidemiological data, use of the Internet/mobile apps/social media for clinical studies (e-trials), drug reaction reporting and surveillance systems etc.\n\nelectronic medical publishing, Open Access publishing, altmetrics, and use of the Internet or social media for scholarly publishing (e.g. collaborative peer review)\n\ninformation needs of patients, consumers and health professionals, including studies evaluating search and retrieval behavior of patients\n\nweb-based studies, e.g. online psychological experiments\n\nevaluations of mhealth (mobile) applications, as well as ambient / ubiquitous computing approaches, sensors, domotics, and other cutting edge technologies\n\npersonal health records, patient portals, consumer health informatics applications\n\nbehavior change technologies\n\nReviews, viewpoint papers and commentaries touching on the issues and themes listed above are also welcome, but should be grounded in data and/or a thorough literature review\n\nIn addition, the Journal will occasionally publish original research, reviews and tutorials on more generic, related topics such as:\n\nInternet standards\n\ncybermetrics\n\nsecurity and confidentiality issues\n\nInternet demographics\n\nsocial impact of the Internet\n\ndigital imaging and multimedia\n\nhealth care records\n\nhigh-speed networks\n\ntelecommunication\n\nelectronic publishing\n\nsoftware development\n\nThe Journal of Medical Internet Research is one of the flagship journals of JMIR Publications and is highly selective. We are not a megajournal that publishes everything regardless of impact. To ensure a rapid turnaround time, we encourage that authors consider other JMIR journal titles as well. While it is possible to transfer submissions from one journal to another before, during or after the review process (based on editorial suggestions), authors can avoid delays in decision-making by submitting to the right journal.\n\nIn order to be considered for J Med Internet Res, clinical informatics papers should have a clear connections to the major themes in this journal of consumer/patient empowerment and participatory healthcare, and/or evaluate the use of mobile/Internet-based/emerging technologies such as patient portals. Other clinical informatics studies with no relationship to consumer health informatics, or more technical papers are best submitted to other JMIR journal titles, such as Interactive Journal of Medical Research (i-JMR, a general medical journal with focus on innovation), JMIR mHealth and uHealth, JMIR Medical Informatics, or JMIR Human Factors.\n\nMachine-learning papers: Machine learning papers are now mostly published in JMIR Medical Informatics (see e-collection Machine Learning), JMIR Formative Research or JMIR AI, or another sister journal, unless they have reached clinical maturity and are being used and validated in routine clinical use. Our flagship journal J Med Internet Res no longer publishes ML papers unless 1) they show a direct clinical effect or impact on care, 2) are validated using an independent dataset not used for training, 3) are written in a language that can be understood by a healthcare professional, and provide open source or a publicly available tool that can be used by others to validate or apply the findings. We also request that 4) reporting strictly adheres to the \"Guidelines for Developing and Reporting Machine Learning Predictive Models in Biomedical Research\". Highly technical papers (with mathematical formulas) are unsuitable for J Med Internet Res or this information needs to be provided in a Multimedia Appendix.\n\nDigital psychiatry and digital mental health papers are best suited for JMIR Mental Health if they are impactful, otherwise JMIR Formative Research publishes early stage work.\n\nStudies related to public health informatics and surveillance systems should preferably be submitted to JMIR Public Health & Surveillance. JPHS is also highly selective.\n\nPapers with focus on games in health or gamification aspects of apps and theoretical issues/commentary on gaming are now primarily published in / transferred to JMIR Serious Games.\n\nStudies evaluating systematically the quality of health information or present tools for social listening may be best suited for JMIR Infodemiology.\n\nFormative work such as usability studies, pilot studies, and feasibility studies are no longer published in our flagship journals and should be submitted to JMIR Formative Research.\n\nProtocols and proposals can be submitted to JMIR Research Protocols.\n\nSubmitted manuscripts are subject to a rigorous but speedy peer review process. We aim for a standard review time of less than 2 months, and a review time of 4 weeks for submission to initial decision for fast-tracked papers)."
