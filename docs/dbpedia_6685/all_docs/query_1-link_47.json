        "text": "The title of your article, \"Online medical blogging: don't do it!\" would seem to suggest that you feel \"offline\" medical blogging is ok. Sure, technically it's not a \"blog\" if it's done offline, but the content may be exactly the same. Doctors have been publishing fiction, nonfiction, commentary and editorial pieces in various forms of offline media for decades. It seems to me that what you intend to criticize is the content of some particular medical blogs rather than the entire practice of medical blogging. After all, by writing for an online medical journal, the authors themselves have now joined the medical blogosphere!\n\nConflict of Interest:\n\nI blog at http://www.jamesloganmd.com.\n\nIn response to your recent article \"Online Medical blogging: don't do it!\" you argue that physicians should not blog about their profession online. As member of the health technology community and an avid reader of health-related blogs, I disagree. The continued relevance of the medical establishment relies on actively engaging with patients online.\n\nThere's no doubt, there are risks to living online. Loose lips on the telephone or golf course are one thing; on the Internet, your comments go on your permanent record. The business world is replete with examples of people failing to recognize this fact. No doubt the medical world will be, too.\n\nHowever, there's also enormous good being done by medical professionals online. They are relating the personal experience of the profession, giving their candid assessments of health and healthcare, and engaging with patients in a whole new way. They are doing this on personal blogs like Emergiblog, Running A Hospital, and Reflections in a Head Mirror and on online health networks like Trusera. These sites create a conversation between doctors, nurses, and patients that's vitally important. Done wisely, health blogging is a place for both health professionals and consumers to gain in knowledge and empathy.\n\nThe AMA famously and vainly warned consumers in 2001, \"If you have a question, trust a physician, not a chat room.\" This advice missed the point of the Internet tools of the day while it patronized health consumers. Doesn't your advice risk doing the same to health professionals today?\n\nSincerely,\n\nJude O'Reilley\n\nwww.trusera.com\n\nConflict of Interest:\n\nI work at Trusera, an online health network that enables people to share health experience.\n\nDrs. Baerlocher and Detsky have made an interesting observation, but they have titled it poorly. I suspect that they have not spent much time reading medical blogs.\n\nAs blogger for over 6 years, I have never had an entry that resembles their example. Rather my blog focuses on the big ideas in medicine -\n\nwhat is quality?\n\nwhat is professionalism?\n\nhow does our payment system impact health care delivery?\n\nwhat is the impact of residency \"reform\"?\n\nI do sometimes include patient stories, but only for the purpose of discussing diagnostic issues.\n\nThe world of blogging is quite diverse. I agree with the authors that the type of blog in which one vents about problem patients, with enough information that one could identify the situation, is unprofessional. However, I strongly believe that the best medical blogs represent the 21st century version of Hyde Park, in which we explore ideas and present our opinions on the issues of the day.\n\nConflict of Interest:\n\nI am the author of DB's Medical Rants\n\nThe authors write a thoughtful piece on blogging about the practice of medicine and identify three issues: professionalism, freedom of speech, and self-protectionism. Their example could be extended to the practice of health care and other health professionals.\n\nClearly, confidentiality, privacy rights, and professionalism preclude \"naming names,\" and, despite freedom of speech, the safe thing to do is to say nothing in an electronic age that facilitates widespread distribution with a near eternal shelf-life.\n\nEmotion-laden blogging to relieve frustration is folly. But consider blogs that express informed opinions about health policies, educational practices, recruitment issues, emerging ethical issues, the realities of professional practice for those thinking of joining the profession, and more. Is all expression to be shut down in the name of self protection and the more high-minded rationales that will surely be front and centre should such recommendations come about?\n\nBlogs are diverse and can be defined in many ways but tend to have certain characteristics in common.\n\nThey express personal opinions, much like op-ed pieces in newspapers, and are snapshots of how a person thinks at a given time.\n\nBlogs are also conversations, not monologues, with comments encouraged.\n\nBlogs are public, leading bloggers to ponder what they should put \"out there\" for eternity about themselves.\n\nBlogs allow the transmission of experience and knowledge that is seldom found in journals and textbooks.\n\nAbove all, blogs are democratic. Anyone can blog and it is the quality of ones ideas, not who you are in the professional pecking order, that counts.\n\nExpressing opinions about professional practice can be argued on the basis of the most appropriate forum for such ideas and related concepts of confidentiality and professionalism. But surely self-protection, although a real factor, is the least justified. I am reminded of this quotation by the American author Elbert Hubbard (1856 â€“1915):\n\n\"To avoid criticism do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.\"\n\nDisclosure: I have a blog Musings on Transfusion Medicine\n\nConflict of Interest:\n\nNone declared"
