        "text": "Save \"eHealth\"! Stop the \"digital health\" misnomer! The number of publications in PubMed containing the terms electronic health, eHealth, mobile health, and mHealth is declining. At the same time, articles containing \"digital health\" (a term barely in use before 2018) are increasing. There is a realistic scenario that in a few years, the novel misnomer \"digital health\" may be wiping out eHealth and mHealth as a more precise and longstanding terminology, used in previous research for the past 25 years or so. Is there any explanation for this behavior other than venture capital and young scientists either not knowing better or (worse) deliberately concealing the fact that what they propose isn't so new and disruptive after all, wanting the reader to forget that there is a 25 year history in researching these things (and with often unexpected failures)? Isn't using digital health in this way deliberate disinformation bordering on research misconduct? Isn't science about standing on the \"shoulder of giants\"? I have seen systematic reviews where ignorant authors don't even use search terms like ehealth or mhealth anymore. I have seen research proposals where authors propose to develop a \"digital health literacy\" instrument without citing or evidently knowing about previous ehealth literacy instruments (like eHeals). I have seen companies pitching old ideas in new bottles proposing something that has been shown ineffective in previous studies. All this is a waste of money and energy. Replacing \"electronic\" with \"digital\" also has another risk. What will we do if analog computing is going to make a comeback? In a recent Wired article on this topic, Lyle Bickley (a founding member of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California) was quoted as saying that “A lot of Silicon Valley companies have secret projects doing analog chips\". The explanation? \"Brute-force natural-language AI systems distill millions of words from the internet, the process is insanely power hungry. The human brain runs on a small amount of electricity [...] about 20 watts. (That’s the same as a light bulb.) \"Yet if we try to do the same thing with digital computers, it takes megawatts. For that kind of application, digital is not going to work. It’s not a smart way to do it.”. So the fancy-pantsy term \"digital health\" probably also will have a very limited half-time. My call to arms for my fellow eHealth researchers, peer-reviewers, authors and editors who have been in the field for more than 5 years and who are the pioneers in the field: Please help to curtail the (mis)use of the terms \"digital health\" or \"digital medicine\". Do not use these terms yourself, and if you see somebody using it, question why they do it and make sure they are aware that eHealth (or mHealth, when it comes to mobile applications) are historically the correct and widely used terms. What's your opinion on this and how can we save the term \"eHealth\"? #ehealth #digitalhealth #electronichealth"
