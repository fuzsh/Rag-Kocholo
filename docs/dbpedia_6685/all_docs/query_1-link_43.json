        "text": "If not H-index then what can we use to measure a scientist? It is a tough question. \"Is this scientist good?\". In sprints, time is the sole determinent of who is the best. In sports, sometimes the one who is the most resilient through the knock out stages becomes the champion. But what exactly is a \"world class\" scientist and how do you define that? In the past, it used to be number of papers until everyone realised that going for a hundred or a thousand papers made no sense. Then everyone zoomed in on citations. If people cited you, it means they read your paper and your paper had an effect on what they are doing? Then we realised that they have been citing you as part of the introduction. Again, not that great an impact it seems. Then came the impact factor of a journal the scientist published in, the higher, the better the paper is. Until, we found a way to game the system and create low impact high impact factor journals that hardly affects the way we live and work. Then came the H-index or Hirsch index where the H-index of a scientist, x, is the x number of papers with x or more citations. Then came more numbers, Field Weighted Citation Index or FWCI, which normalises the citation across fields such that a humanities expert is not up against a natural science expert in terms of citations. More followed, Highly Cited Researcher awards, top 2% cited researcher, h10 index, g-index, etc. Do we know what we are measuring? No. We usually can tell if a scientist is the real deal by listening to a lecture or reading their papers. But the problem comes when the few really eloquent ones (but not as good) manage to pass themselves off as Michelin cuisine when they are more the fast food type. The reverse also happens when hidden gems are buried amongst all the noise. Shall we get fellow experts to assess? Then we are faced with the most feared three letter word in science. COI. Conflict of interest. Either someone in this world hates you too much or loves you too much, either rules them out from judging you due to bias. That leaves very few people available to be able to judge your work without the aid of metrics and numbers. How do we judge? I usually like to ask a few key questions. And maybe people(or administrators) who have to judge future scientists would find this helpful. What difference would your work make to the field/world? What if your research disappeared from the face of this earth? Would many find it hard to continue their work? What if your work never existed in the first place, any difference to your field? Is your work being used by people in their day to day lives? What new knowledge did you bring to the table? Using the earlier numbers provided as a tentative gauge of the scientist, but I will only make my conclusion after I have asked the qualitative questions as well. It is critical to have enlightened judges assess the scientists. Your thoughts? Drop your comments below! #research #science #careerdevelopment"
