It is easy\n\nis in a great company is not therefore not solitary. When, therefore, we have lost a brother or a son or a friend on whom we were wont to rest, we say that we are left solitary, and oftentimes we say it in Rome, with such a crowd meeting us and so many dwelling about us, and, it may be, having a multitude of slaves. For the solitary man, in his conception, meaneth to be thought helpless, and laid open to those who wish him harm. Therefore when we are on a journey we then, above all, say that we are solitary when we are fallen among thieves; for that which taketh away solitude is not the sight of a man, but of a faithful and pious and serviceable man. For if to be solitary it sufficeth to be alone, then say that Zeus is solitary in the conflagration,[1] and bewails himself. _Woe is me! I have neither Hera nor Athene nor Apollo_, nor, in short, either brother or son or descendant or kinsman. And so some say he doth when alone in the conflagration. For they comprehend not the life of a man who is alone, setting out from a certain natural principle, that we are by nature social, and inclined to love each other, and pleased to be in the company of other men. But none the less is it needful that one find the means to this also, to be able to suffice to himself, and to be his own companion. For as Zeus is his own companion, and is content with himself, and considereth his own government, what it is, and is occupied in designs worthy of himself; thus should we be able to converse with ourselves, and feel no need of others, nor want means to pass the time; but to observe the divine government, and the relation of ourselves with other things; to consider how we stood formerly towards the events that befall us, and how we stand now; what things they are that still afflict us; how these, too, may be healed, how removed; and if aught should need perfecting, to perfect it according to the reason of the case. 2. Ye see now how that Caesar seemeth to have given us a great peace; how there are no longer wars nor battles nor bands of robbers nor of pirates, but a man may travel at every season, and sail from east to west. But can he give us peace from fever? or from shipwreck? or from fire? or earthquake? or lightning? ay, or from love? _He cannot._ Or from grief? _He cannot._ Or from envy? _He cannot._ Briefly, then, he cannot secure us from any of such things. But the word of the philosophers doth promise us peace even from these things. And what saith it? _If ye will hearken unto me, O men, wheresoever ye be, whatsoever ye do, ye shall not grieve, ye shall not be wroth, ye shall not be compelled or hindered, but ye shall live untroubled and free from every ill._ Whosoever hath this peace, which Caesar never proclaimed (for how could he proclaim it?), but which God proclaimed through His word, shall he not suffice to himself when he may be alone? for he beholdeth and considereth, _Now can no evil happen to me; for me there is no robber, no earthquake; all things are full of peace, full of calm; for me no way, no city, no assembly, no neighbor, no associate hath any hurt_. He is supplied by one, whose part that is, with food, by another with raiment, by another with senses, by another with natural conceptions. And when it may be that the necessary things are no longer supplied, that is the signal for retreat: the door is opened, and God saith to thee, _Depart_. ----\"Whither?\" To nothing dreadful, but to the place from whence thou camest--to things friendly and akin to thee, to the elements of Being. Whatever in thee was fire shall go to fire; of earth, to earth; of air, to air; of water, to water;[2] no Hades, nor Acheron, nor Coeytus, nor Phlegethon, but all things are full of Gods and Powers.[3] Whoso hath these things to think on, and seeth the sun and the moon and the stars, and rejoiceth in the earth and the sea, he is no more solitary than he is helpless. ----\"What, then, if one come and find me alone and slay me?\" Fool! not thee, but thy wretched body. 3. Thou art a little soul bearing up a corpse. 4. What solitude, then, is there any longer, what lack? Why do we make ourselves worse than children, which, when they are left alone, what do they?--they take shells and sand and build up somewhat, and then throw it down, and again build up something else, and so they never lack pastime. And shall I, if ye sail away from me, sit down and weep for that I am left alone and solitary? Shall I have no shells nor sand? But children do these things through their folly, and we through our wisdom are made unhappy. CHAPTER X. AGAINST THE CONTENTIOUS AND REVENGEFUL. 1. To suppose that we shall become contemptible in the eyes of others, unless in some way we inflict an injury on those who first showed hostility to us, is the character of most ignoble and thoughtless men. For thus we say, that a man is to be despised according to his inability to do hurt; but much rather is he to be despised according to his inability to do good. 2. The wise and good man neither strives with any himself, nor in the measure of his power will he allow another to strive. And in this, as in all other things, the life of Socrates is set before us as an example; who did not only himself fly all contention, but also forbade it to others. See in Xenophon's _Symposium_ how many quarrels he ended; and, again, how he bore with Thrasymachus, and how with Polus and with Callicles; and how he endured his wife, and how his son, which opposed him with sophistical arguments. For he remembered very well that no man can command the ruling faculty of another. 3. How, then, is there yet any place for contention in one so minded? For what event can amaze him? what appear strange to him? Doth he not look for even worse and more grievous things at the hands of evil men than do befall him? Doth he not count everything for gain which is short of the extreme of injury? Hath such a one reviled thee? Much thanks to him that he did not strike thee. _But he did also strike me._ Much thanks that he did not wound thee. _But he did also wound me._ Much thanks that he did not slay thee. For when did he learn, or from whom, that he was a tame animal, and affectionate to others, and that to the wrongdoer the wrong-doing itself is a heavy injury? For since he hath not learned these things, nor believes them, wherefore should he not follow that which appears to be his advantage? Thy neighbor hath flung stones! Hast thou, then, sinned in aught? But he has broken things in the house? And art thou a household vessel? Nay--but a Will. 4. What, then, hath been given thee for this occasion? To a wolf it were given to bite--to fling more stones. But if thou seek what is becoming for a man, look into thy stores, see what faculties thou hast come here furnished withal. Hast thou the nature of a wild beast? the temper of revenge? 5. When is a horse in wretched case? When he is bereaved of his natural faculties; not when he cannot crow, but when he cannot run. When is a dog? Not when he cannot fly, but when he cannot track. Is not a man, then, also thus wretched, not when he cannot strangle lions or embrace statues[1]--for to this he came endowed with no faculties by Nature--but when he hath lost his honesty, his faithfulness? Surely we should meet together and lament over such a man; so great are the evils into which he hath fallen. Not, indeed,\n\nnot in Holinshed. It has been transferred from his account of the witches' hailing of Macbeth and Banquo. Not unusually for Shakespeare, this casts a less than happily legitimate light upon the denouement. Doubt is reinforced by the fact that, like the witches' greeting of Macbeth as Thane of Cawdor, Macduffe's entitling of Malcolme is premature, prophetic, in that it precedes a decision of the thanes. In a very _Macbeth_ way, Macduffe pressures the nobles by anticipation into delivering what he wants, saying that he already hears what is in their minds (again, in a minor key, like Macbeth's ambition educed by the witches). This is the cue which prompts the thanes to a chorus of salutation: _[Macduffe.]_ Behold where stands Th'Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free: I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle, That speake my salutation in their minds: Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine. Haile King of Scotland. _All_. Haile King of Scotland. _Flourish_. (V.vii. TLN 2506-12) Those with an ear for irony will hear the insubstantiality of 'voyces' (like the 'Voyces' of election that Coriolanus scornfully calls for). Those with an eye for it will be struck by the way the witches' 'All haile' (a phrase with overtones of betrayal elsewhere in Shakespeare) returns to the page through a Folio speech prefix (' _All_. Haile King of Scotland'). It is in the hands of directors whether the flourish sounds from the tiring house unannounced, as the play's endorsement, as it were, of Malcolme's new title, or whether Macduffe signals the trumpeters, to orchestrate this relatively benign coup or assertion of heritable principles. What it remains for criticism to do is to analyse the connection between the hailing of the witches and that of the nobles. To undertake this task is to return to the topic of offices and titles highlighted by _The Valiant Scot_. *** * *** That the word _hail_ occurs far more often in _Macbeth_ than in any other play by Shakespeare cannot be entirely explained by the freedom with which the witches use it in Act I and the thanes echo them in Act V. Hardly has the action begun than Malcolme greets the bleeding sergeant with a 'Haile, braue friend' (I.ii. TLN 23). There is no doubt, however, that the witches give hailing prominence: _Mac_. Speake if you can: what are you? _1_. All haile _Macbeth_ , haile to thee _Thane_ of Glamis. _2_. All haile _Macbeth_ , haile to thee _Thane_ of Cawdor. _3_. All haile _Macbeth_ , that shalt be King hereafter. (I.iii. TLN 147-50) Requesting a greeting for himself (a curious gambit), Banquo is rewarded with a similar, yet developing, refrain, as 'Hayle' repeated by each of the witches turns into riddling doublets: _3_. Thou shalt get Kings, though thou be none: So all haile _Macbeth, and Banquo_. _1. Banquo, and Macbeth, all_ haile. (I.iii. TLN 167-9) By means of these repetitions, _hail_ gains cumulative weight, yet it also evolves in significance. The process starts as the witches use 'haile' not only as a greeting but as an imperative to one another to hail their visitors and then as a description of what they are doing. As one witch hails she hails another to join her in hailing; and if uttering the word binds them together, as their broken, choric utterances repeatedly do, so does its semantic field, since 'all haile' could mean 'all whole'. As figures of inversion--a Shakespearean anti-masque--the witches parody in their three-in-oneness the constitutional theology of the Jacobean threefold monarchy. _Hail_ implies 'whole' because it also means, especially in northern usage, 'health'--being sound and whole in body. At the start of a play preoccupied with insanity and disease, the witches mockingly wish upon Macbeth and Banquo all the health they set out to subvert with the bad medicine they brew up in what they say as well as their cauldron. This is one reason why their greeting sounds like a charm. Another is that the weird sisters wish the travellers 'luck'--an archaic meaning of _hail_ , as it is of weird (i.e. 'wayward/weyard'). Wholeness can be projected upon Macbeth and Banquo because they are, like those who greet them--Jacobean versions of the three fates--joined in their 'lot' or 'destiny'. The ambiguity of welcome is underwritten by the slipperiness of the word. Macbeth has another question: Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more: By _Sinells_ death, I know I am _Thane_ of Glamis, But how, of Cawdor? the _Thane_ of Cawdor liues A prosperous Gentleman: And to be King, Stands not within the prospect of beleefe, No more then to be Cawdor. Say from whence You owe this strange Intelligence, or why Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way With such Prophetique greeting? (I.iii. TLN 170-8) The play's concern with how fathers relate to sons has led critics to make much of Macbeth's lack of an heir. Yet the role registered in his name (Mac-, 'son of') is also striking, since he has come to lack a father. By that death he inherits the title Thane of Glamis. Did Cawdor not have a son? (How many children had Lady Cawdor?) Perhaps the treachery imputed to the father has been punished in his heir. Perhaps the lack of an heir made the Thanedom ripe for redistribution. Either way, _Macbeth_ starts with a heritable title being allocated by order of the king. In this the play, like _The Valiant Scot_ , is potently of its period. It is a strategy that Duncan will revisit, obscured from the sight of most modern commentators because passed off as not allocation at all, but inheritance, when he settles the estate of kingship, over which by Scottish custom he has no particular rights, upon his firstborn, Malcolme. Before that, Macbeth receives official news of his own promotion. Giving _hail_ another twist, Rosse tells him how reports of his success in battle came 'thick as hail' to Duncan. Heralds announcing success approached the king with so many greetings (hailings), one upon another, that there was a blizzard of welcomes mixed with welcome reports. Because of this, Macbeth is to be not just thanked and heralded into the king's presence but _greeted._ This is a more handsome reward than it sounds because the greeting includes a title (we often hail a named addressee), and the anticipated form of that title (Cawdor) makes what Rosse obscurely says about this being 'earnest of a greater Honor' provocative because it is bound to put Macbeth in mind of the royal title that has been prophesied: And for an earnest of a greater Honor, He bad me, from him, call thee _Thane_ of Cawdor: In which addition, haile most worthy _Thane_ , For it is thine. (I.iii. TLN 209-12) Rosse's hailing is as insidious as that of the witches. When Shakespeare's contemporary, Simon Forman, made notes on a performance that he had seen of _Macbeth_ he remembered from the next phase of the play the 'kindly wellcome' that Duncan gave to Macbeth and Banquo; and it is indeed remarkable how elaborately Macbeth is welcomed. Duncan lavishes upon him the sort of fulsome greeting--'Thou art so farre before, | That swiftest Wing of Recompense is slow, | To ouertake thee', and so forth (I.iv. TLN 299-301)--that seventeenth-century conduct-book writers, such as the Scotsman John Cleland, warn against. After fewer words of welcome to Banquo, marked as warmer by a physical embrace, Duncan seizes the chance to capitalize on the victories that Macbeth has won him: Sonnes, Kinsmen, _Thanes_ , And you whose places are the nearest, know, We will establish our Estate vpon Our eldest, _Malcolme_ , whom we name hereafter, The Prince of Cumberland: which Honor must Not vnaccompanied, inuest him onely, But signes of Noblenesse, like Starres, shall shine On all deseruers. (I.iv. TLN 322-9) Favouring Malcolme with estate, name, and honour, Duncan\n\nFind a Grief Support Group Virtual Grief Support Groups and Resources HopeHealth is committed to provide you with the support you need.

I can admit that the situation on the ground hasn't changed dramatically and my article is still reflecting the grave realities we face. Unfortunately South Caucasus is rich not only with natural resources but also with numerous protracted conflicts, and the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region is among them. The ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been concluded on May 5, 1994, but no substantial progress has been made so far. The main international mediator – OSCE Minsk Group composed of representatives of Russia, France and the U.S. – has failed to bring any positive changes into the resolution of the conflict. The Madrid Principles of the resolution of the conflict adopted by both Armenian and Azerbaijani leadership in December 2007 have brought a light of hope but the following \"war\" over details disappointed many. At first sight, it seems that the main bone of contention is whether the referendum defining the final legal status of the region should be conducted prior or after the return of the IDPs, who are of Azerbaijani-origin, because that would determine whether the region will remain as a part of Azerbaijan or proclaim independence. However, after many years of fruitless negotiations it becomes obvious that Armenia is very reluctant to return to Azerbaijani control not only the Nagorno-Karabakh region itself, but also the occupied territories surrounding the region. Armenian leadership is not yet ready to take such a bold decision; it not only lacks political capital to spend but also legitimacy among Armenian population. Any concession of land to the Azerbaijani side could result in the loss of power and political turmoil. Moreover, one should not forget that the current president of Armenia, Serzh Sargsyan, is originally coming from the Nagorno-Karabakh region and is said to be one of the founders of the Nagorno-Karabakh armed forces. Politics of demonization of Armenians in Azerbaijan is another argument at hand which prevents any attempts to reconcile both sides. Armenian side has serious concerns that those Armenians, living in the Karabkh region, will be simply wiped out of their living places or turned to be second glass citizens of Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, Armenia has adopted a \"fence sitting\" approach waiting for the more favourable international environment to come for self-determination of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh (read: without return of IDPs). Therefore it would be naïve to hope that a breakthrough in negotiations could be achieved by 2013, when the Armenian presidential elections are going to take place. While both presidents at the OSCE summit in Astana signed a joint statement reaffirming their \"commitment to seek a final settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict based upon the principles and norms of the international law\", it still should not be considered as a safety net to avoid the breakout of the military actions. Azerbaijani leadership is well aware of the situation and is trying to push Minsk Group mediators to put more pressure on Armenia while keeping military option as a last resort but the more frequent statements made by both politicians and military on the possibility of use of force to return back the occupied territories indicate that the patience is gradually running out. In its latest report[1] the International Crisis Group has warned on a possibility of the resumption of military hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The situation has deteriorated over the past year, the cease-fire violations became more frequent and the causality figures increased. Unlike it is in Georgia, there is no so-called 24/7 working \"hot line\" among the parties to the conflict which could prevent the escalation of the conflict. Therefore any serious skirmish could easily spiralout of control and lead to the outbreak of war which could have far more grave consequences for the region than the Russia-Georgia war in August 2008. In August 2010 Russia and Armenia signed the 5th Protocol to the Treaty on Russia's military base on the Armenian territories concluded in 1995. The Protocol envisaged that the Russian military base (located in the Northern city of Gyumri) will not only serve for the protection of the national interests of the Russian Federation, but will also ensure security of the host country, that is, Armenia, and provide modern weapons and equipment to Armenian armed forces. For those who have been following the developments in the region, there is nothing new in this document as Russia has long been providing armaments to Armenia. Moreover, both Armenia and Russia are parties to the Collective Security Treaty which envisages that an aggression against one of the state parties is an aggression against all. What is important here that the latest document is just one more explicit proof of Russia's biased position in the regulation of the conflict as well as to the fact that the key to the resolution of the conflict lies in Kremlin. These developments led to the conclusion of the Agreement on Strategic Partnership and Mutual Support between Azerbaijan and Turkey, which pledges that both countries will support each other in a case of aggression and enhance military cooperation. The agreement shows an increasing fatigue, and even frustration with the current state of the negotiation process in Azerbaijan. The country has increased its military spending up to more than $ 3 billion, which is even more than the whole state budget of Armenia. The current growth in oil prices will lead to more fortune and more military spending, but this will not last forever. Azerbaijan's budget is heavily dependent on oil revenues. And as some pundits[2] predict that at the current rate of extraction Azerbaijani oil reserves may be depleted by 2019, but the oil boom will end in 2013. Less cash would mean fewer chances to regain Nagorno-Karabakh by force. Azerbaijani diplomats tend to complain that foreigners come to Azerbaijan to get something profitable out of this country – Russians seek for obedience, Europeans seek for oil and gas, Iranians seek for an opportunity to export Islamic revolution, Americans seek for dominance and support Europeans in their quest for energy resources – and nobody cares of Azerbaijan's top national priority – restoration of the territorial integrity. The only partner for Azerbaijan which not only takes but also delivers is Turkey. But the frustration of the current negotiation format, explicit military and economic support of Russia to Armenia and looming descent in oil production might push Azerbaijani leadership to opt for the military solution, which would plunge the region into chaos. The current format of the conflict mediation process is ineffective as it very much depends on the domestic situation. The upcoming presidential elections (scheduled for the first half of 2012) in all three countries represented in the OSCE Minsk Group – U.S., France and Russia – mean less focus on the resolution of the conflict. Moreover, due to a large presence of Armenian diaspora Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict often becomes an issue of domestic politics like it is in the U.S. or France. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh has largely been out of view for the European Union which has left the resolution of the conflict to the OSCE. In words of the President of European Commission Barroso, the EU is ready to provide assistance for rehabilitation in case a conflict settlement is reached.[3] But again there is a smell of gunpowder in the air, and again the EU is reluctant to step in. If the EU is not yet ready to make bold political decisions, it should invest more into reconciliation between two sides financially supporting non-profit organisations working in this field. Two generations have been brought up not speaking to each other.

Our goal is to investigate the behaviour of $C_h$ in two frameworks, relating to the following hypotheses: \\begin{itemize} \\item[{\\bf (H1)}] For some positive constants $C_1, C_2$ and $C_3$, and all small $h>0$ there holds: $$C_1 h\\leq g_i^h(x)\\leq C_2 h, \\qquad |\\nabla g_i^h(x)|\\leq C_3 h \\qquad \\forall x\\in S, \\quad i=1,2. $$ \\item[{\\bf (H2)}] For some smooth positive functions $g_1, g_2:S\\longrightarrow \\mathbf{R}$, there holds: $$\\frac{1}{h} g_i^h \\to g_i \\quad {\\mbox{ in }} \\mathcal{C}^1(S) \\quad {\\mbox{ as }} h\\to 0, \\qquad i=1,2. $$ \\end{itemize} Notice that clearly {\\bf (H2)} implies {\\bf (H1)} with, for example: $C_1 = 2\\max \\{g_i(x); ~x\\in S, ~i=1,2\\}$, $C_2 = 1/2\\min \\{g_i(x); ~x\\in S, ~i=1,2\\}$, $C_3 = \\max_i \\|\\nabla g_i\\|_{L^\\infty (S)} +1$. \\medskip Before stating our main results, we need to recall the notion of a Killing vector field. The Lie algebra of smooth Killing vector fields on $S$ will be denoted by $\\mathcal{I}(S)$. That is, $v\\in \\mathcal{I}(S)$ if and only if: \\begin{itemize} \\item[(i)] $v:S\\longrightarrow \\mathbf{R}^n$ is smooth and $v(x)\\in T_x(S)$ for every $x\\in S$, \\item[(ii)] $\\begin{displaystyle}\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\tau} (x) \\cdot \\tau = 0 \\end{displaystyle}$ for every $x\\in S$ and every $\\tau\\in T_x S$. \\end{itemize} Condition (ii) implies that \\begin{equation}\\label{kill} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\tau}(x) \\cdot \\eta + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\eta}(x)\\cdot \\tau = 0 \\qquad \\forall \\tau,\\eta\\in T_xS \\quad \\forall x\\in S. \\end{equation} Recall that Killing vector fields are infinitesimal generators of isometries on $S$, in the sense that if $\\Phi$ is the flow generated by $v$: $$ \\frac{\\mbox{d}}{\\mbox{d}s} \\Phi (s,x) = v(\\Phi(s,x)), \\qquad \\Phi(0,x) = x,$$ then for every fixed $s$ the map $S\\ni x\\mapsto \\Phi(s,x)\\in S$ is an isometry. It is known that the linear space $\\mathcal{I}(S)$ has finite dimension \\cite{KN, Peterson}. We recall this fact in Appendix C. \\medskip Given positive smooth functions $g_1, g_2:S\\longrightarrow \\mathbf{R}$, define: $$\\mathcal{I}_{g_1, g_2}(S) = \\left\\{v\\in\\mathcal{I}(S); ~~ v(x)\\cdot\\nabla(g_1+g_2)(x) = 0 \\quad \\mbox{ for all } x\\in S\\right\\}.$$ \\medskip Our main results are the following: \\begin{theorem}\\label{th1} Assume {\\bf (H1)} and let $\\alpha<1$ be any constant. Then, for all $h>0$ sufficiently small and all $u\\in W^{1,2}(S^h, \\mathbf{R}^n)$ satisfying one of the following tangency conditions: $$ u\\cdot \\vec n^h=0 ~~~ \\mbox{ on } \\partial^+ S^h=\\{x+g_2^h(x)\\vec n(x); ~x\\in S\\},$$ or: $$ u\\cdot \\vec n^h=0 ~~~ \\mbox{ on } \\partial^- S^h=\\{x-g_1^h(x)\\vec n(x); ~x\\in S\\},$$ together with: \\begin{equation}\\label{f1} \\left|\\int_{S^h} u(z) v(\\pi(z)) ~\\mathrm{d}z\\right| \\leq \\alpha \\|u\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\cdot \\|v\\pi\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\qquad \\forall v\\in\\mathcal{I}(S), \\end{equation} there holds: \\begin{equation}\\label{korn} \\|u\\|_{W^{1,2}(S^h)} \\leq C \\|D(u)\\|_{L^2(S^h)}, \\end{equation} where $C$ is independent of $u$ and of $h$. \\end{theorem} \\begin{theorem}\\label{th2} Assume {\\bf (H2)} and let $\\alpha<1$ be any constant. Then for all $h>0$ sufficiently small and all $u\\in W^{1,2}(S^h, \\mathbf{R}^n)$ satisfying $ u\\cdot \\vec n^h=0$ on $\\partial S^h$ and: \\begin{equation}\\label{f2} \\left|\\int_{S^h} u(z) v(\\pi(z)) ~\\mathrm{d}z\\right| \\leq \\alpha \\|u\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\cdot \\|v\\pi\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\qquad \\forall v\\in\\mathcal{I}_{g_1, g_2}(S), \\end{equation} there holds (\\ref{korn}) with $C$ independent of $u$ and of $h$. \\end{theorem} The example constructed in section \\ref{example} shows that conditions (\\ref{f1}) (or (\\ref{f2})) are necessary for the bound (\\ref{korn}). In particular, any Killing field $v$ on $S$ can be extended to a vector field $v^h$ on $S^h$, satisfying the boundary condition and such that $\\|\\nabla v^h\\|_{L^2(S^h)}^2 \\geq Ch$ but $\\|D(v^h)\\|_{L^2(S^h)}^2\\leq Ch^3$. Hence, if one naively assumes that $u$ satisfies the angle condition only with the space of generators of appropriate rotations on $S$, rather than the whole $\\mathcal{I}(S)$, the constant $C_h$ has a blow-up rate of at least $h^{-1}$, as $h\\to 0$. The following theorem shows that this is the actual blow-up rate, under the abovementioned conditions. More precisely, define: $$\\mathcal{R}(S) = \\big\\{v:S\\longrightarrow\\mathbf{R}^n; ~~ v(x) = Ax+b, ~ A\\in so(n), ~b\\in\\mathbf{R}^n, ~ v\\cdot \\vec n=0 \\mbox{ on } S\\big\\} \\subset \\mathcal{I(S)},$$ $$\\mathcal{R}_{g_1, g_2}(S) = \\big\\{v\\in\\mathcal{R}(S); ~~ v(x)\\cdot \\nabla(g_1 + g_2)(x) \\mbox{ for all } x\\in S\\big\\}\\subset \\mathcal{I}_{g_1, g_2}(S).$$ \\begin{theorem}\\label{th_very_weak} Let $\\alpha<1$ be any constant. Then, for all $h$ sufficiently small and all $u\\in W^{1,2}(S^h, \\mathbf{R}^n)$, there holds: \\begin{equation}\\label{very_weak} \\|u\\|_{W^{1,2}(S^h)} \\leq Ch^{-1} \\|D(u)\\|_{L^2(S^h)}, \\end{equation} in any of the following situations: \\begin{itemize} \\item[(i)] {\\bf (H1)} holds, $u\\cdot\\vec n^h=0$ on $\\partial^+ S^h$ or $u\\cdot\\vec n^h=0$ on $\\partial^- S^h$, and: $$\\left|\\int_{S^h} u(z) v(\\pi(z)) ~\\mathrm{d}z\\right| \\leq \\alpha \\|u\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\cdot \\|v\\pi\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\qquad \\forall v\\in\\mathcal{R}(S).$$ \\item[(ii)] {\\bf (H2)} holds, $u\\cdot\\vec n^h=0$ on $\\partial S^h$, and: $$\\left|\\int_{S^h} u(z) v(\\pi(z)) ~\\mathrm{d}z\\right| \\leq \\alpha \\|u\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\cdot \\|v\\pi\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\qquad \\forall v\\in\\mathcal{R}_{g_1, g_2}(S).$$ \\end{itemize} \\end{theorem} \\noindent Notice that (i) is implied by the hypotheses of Theorem \\ref{th1} and (ii) by the hypotheses of Theorem \\ref{th2}, as the spaces $\\mathcal{R}(S)$ and $\\mathcal{R}_{g_1, g_2}(S)$ are contained in $\\mathcal{I}(S)$ or $\\mathcal{I}_{g_1,g_2}(S)$, respectively. The bound (\\ref{very_weak}) was obtained also in \\cite{KV2}, but in a different context of thin plates with clamped boundary conditions and rapidly varying thickness. \\section{Remarks and an outline of proofs} \\begin{remark} Conditions (\\ref{f1}) and (\\ref{f2}) may be understood in the following way: the cosine of the angle (in $L^2(S^h)$) between $u$ and its projection onto the linear space $W^h\\subset L^2(S^h)$ of `trivial' extensions $v\\pi$ of certain Killing fields $v\\in\\mathcal{I}(S)$ (or $v\\in\\mathcal{I}_{g_1, g_2}(S)$) should be smaller than $\\alpha$. Equivalently, one considers vector fields $u\\in W^{1,2}(S^h)$, which for a given constant $\\beta\\geq 1$ (related to $\\alpha$ through: $\\beta = (1-\\alpha^2)^{-1/2}$) satisfy: \\begin{equation}\\label{dist_angle} \\|u\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\leq \\beta \\|u - v\\pi\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\qquad \\forall v\\in\\mathcal{I}(S) \\quad \\mbox{ (or } \\forall v\\in\\mathcal{I}_{g_1, g_2}(S) \\mbox{)}. \\end{equation} That is, the distance of $u$ from the space $W^h$ controls (uniformly) the full norm $\\|u\\|_{L^2(S^h)}$. By Theorems \\ref{th1} and \\ref{th2}, inside each closed cone around $(W^h)^\\perp$, of fixed angle $\\theta<\\pi/2$ in $L^2(S^h)$, the bound (\\ref{korn}) holds, with a constant $C$, that is uniform in $u$ and $h$. One could therefore argue that $W^h$ is the kernel for the uniform Korn-Poincar\\'e inequality, in the same manner as the linear maps $Az+b$ with skew gradients $A\\in so(n)$ constitute the kernel for the standard Korn inequality (\\ref{ort_lin}), (\\ref{korn_nonunif}). This is not exactly the case, as the uniform Korn inequality is true for the extensions $v\\pi$ (see Remark \\ref{rem_trivial_ext}). The role of the aforementioned kernel is played by the space $\\widetilde{W}^h$ of other, 'smart' extensions $v^h$ of the Killing fields $v$ (see the formula (\\ref{3_def})). Still, with $v\\pi$ replaced by $v^h$ in (\\ref{f1}) or (\\ref{f2}), both Theorems \\ref{th1} and \\ref{th2} remain true. Indeed, notice that the spaces $W^h$ and $\\widetilde{W}^h$ are asymptotically tangent at $h=0$: $$\\|v\\pi - v^h\\|_{L^2(S^h)}\\leq Ch \\|v\\pi\\|_{L^2(S^h)} \\qquad \\forall v\\in\\mathcal{I}(S).$$ Hence, if $|\\langle u,v^h\\rangle_{L^2}|\\leq \\alpha \\|u\\|_{L^2}\\cdot \\|v^h\\|_{L^2}$ for some $\\alpha<1$, then $|\\langle u,v\\pi\\rangle_{L^2}|\\leq (\\alpha+Ch) \\|u\\|_{L^2}\\cdot \\|v\\pi\\|_{L^2}$, and the angle conditions in main theorems hold, with another $\\alpha<1$, when $h$ is sufficiently small. Thus, the fact that we chose to work with 'trivial' extensions, in $W^h$ (giving a simpler condition), instead of the real kernel $\\widetilde{W}^h$, is not restrictive. In the particular case when $\\partial S^h$ is parallel to $S$, say $g_i^h = h$, we have $$\\vec n^h(x + g_2(x)\\vec n(x)) = \\vec n(x) \\qquad \\vec n^h(x - g_1(x)\\vec n(x)) = -\\vec n(x),$$ $$\\mathcal{I}(S) = \\mathcal{I}_{g_1, g_2}(S).$$ If $w\\in\\mathcal{R}_\\partial (S^h)$ then $w_{|S}$ is tangent to $S$ and, as shown in Appendix A (Theorem \\ref{lemma_rotations}) it generates a rotation on $S$. Actually, one has: $w = (w_{\\mid S})^h\\in\\widetilde{W}^h$ and so by the preceding comment we see that the condition (\\ref{ort_lin}) is asymptotically contained in (\\ref{f1}) (or (\\ref{f2})). \\end{remark} \\begin{remark} A natural question is whether $\\mathcal{I}(S)$ may contain other vector fields than the restrictions of generators of rigid motions on the whole $\\mathbf{R}^n$. This is clearly the case when $n=2$: any tangent vector field of constant length is a Killing field. The same question for higher dimensions and even for $n=3$ and general (nonconvex) hypersurfaces is, to our knowledge, still open. It is closely related to another open problem of whether the class of rotationally symmetric surfaces is closed under intrinsic isometries. A further related question is whether every intrinsic isometry on $S$ is actually a restriction of some isometry of $\\mathbf{R}^3$. When $S$ is convex, it is well known that it is the case, while for non-convex surfaces it is false. The answer to the same question, formulated for $1$-parameter families of isometries is not known (see \\cite{Spivak} vol. 5). \\end{remark} \\bigskip \\noindent {\\bf An outline of proofs of Theorems \\ref{th1} and \\ref{th2}.} The general strategy is as follows. Suppose that $D(u)$ is small. The main idea is to study the map $\\bar{u}: S\\longrightarrow\\mathbf{R}^n$ which is obtained by averaging $u$ in the normal direction: $$\\bar{u}(x) = \\fint_{-g_1^h(x)}^{g_2^h(x)} u(x+t\\vec n(x))~\\mbox{d}t.$$ By the boundary condition, one has $\\bar{u}\\cdot\\vec n\\approx 0$, i.e. $\\bar{u}$ is almost tangential to $S$. Moreover, $D(\\bar{u})$ is essentially bounded by the average of $D(u)$. Hence if $D(u)$ is small, by Korn's inequality on surfaces, the field $\\bar{u}$ must be close to a Killing field $v$. If $v$ is not small, we will\n\nSkepticism and analysis surround every team as the second week of the season comes to an end. I guess I'm here to join the party–mainly for analysis, not for skepticism. It's easy to analyze halfway through the season, but only two weeks into the season seems a little rash, doesn't it? Is it appropriate to analyze, criticize, and skepticize (yes, made up word) already? I don't know the answer, but I think it's appropriate to offer some analysis because the Red Sox have made some easily preventable mistakes that have led to run scoring. And even though it's early on, there are some serious, and unfortunately controversial issues that need to be addressed. It may be the beginning of the season, but every game counts. These games count as much as they do in September. Each game is of vital importance as each team tries to avoid the obstacles on the road to the postseason. I don't agree with those who say, \"It's the beginning of the season, they're just adjusting.\" That's what Spring Training is for. Ideally, teams should work out their kinks during Spring Training. Inevitably, obstacles will arise during the regular season, so I'm here to try and work those out. Let's tackle the obvious topic first: David Ortiz. I think he has felt under pressure to perform since the first game of the season. Because of the dismal numbers he put up last season, all reporters ever asked him about during the Spring was his rebound. It is easy to tell how insecure about this situation he is. He snapped at reporters the second day of the season; he got ejected from a game for arguing about a strike; and it is easy to spot the frustrated grimace on his face each time he strikes out. I don't blame him for feeling pressure, but I'm surprised about how much it's getting to him. I won't ignore the few hits that he has gotten: some have been solid contact, but others were pure luck. He even picked up the golden sombrero one game where he struck out four times: that's the problem. He strikes out, and for the most time, he strikes out looking. I'm no hitting guru, so I'm not here to talk mechanics. The fact of the matter is that having him in our lineup is ineffective, and at times, detrimental. So why does Terry Francona put him in the lineup day after day? I think that part of it comes from seniority. Maybe Terry Francona thinks that maybe Big Papi is just going to get out of his funk because of what he has done in the past. But this is the third year in a row that this has been going on. As much as it pains me to say this, he is done. I'm sure it will be tough to sit him, but it is necessary. It is important to put the best lineup out there, and putting Big Papi in there does not get the job done. I like the idea of platooning Mike Lowell and Jeremy Hermida at that spot. Hermida has proved himself to be a fantastic pickup coming off the bench for Jacoby Ellsbury while he is injured. I can see him hitting a lot of doubles off the Green Monster. Issue number two: The Bullpen. Last year, the bullpen was considered our strongest asset. This year, it has been one of the weakest. I don't think that the loss of Takashi Saito or Billy Wagner really affects that; however, the loss of Justin Masterson does. I'm sure you all know exactly what I'm going to say. Bring up Michael Bowden! We need a long-term middle relief pitcher; especially if our starters are done after the fifth inning because they throw 30 pitches in an inning or two. The Red Sox obviously expect to use him as a middle reliever, so what I don't understand is why they're still treating him as a starter in Pawtucket. I think that for a pitcher to be completely effective, they have to know their role (no matter how good they are). Just look how good Justin Masterson is doing with Cleveland now that they have explicitly deemed him a starter. I have no doubt that Bowden has the ability to flourish in either role, but he will be more effective once they tell him what his role actually is so that he doesn't have to keep switching. Ramon Ramirez has been struggling so far, so I really hope that he finds his stuff because he was the unsung hero of last year. Manny Delcarmen still struggles to be consistent, but he has the ability to go multiple innings, which is important. I prefer him over Scott Atchinson anyway. I think that Robert Manuel, now pitching in Pawtucket, could be really effective in the bullpen if he was given a chance. I know Daniel Bard is very good, but the Red Sox need to use him a little more sparingly. The poor guy has been used so much already this season. He has a wicked slider, but I'd like to see him add a changeup to his repertoire because the radar gun is almost always 90 mph or above, and having that speed constantly will almost surely lead to giving up more home runs. My final issue with the bullpen includes Victor Martinez as well. When it comes to Jonathan Papelbon, all he ever calls are fastballs. Papelbon also has a slider and a changeup in his arsenal, so I think that it's important that he incorporates those as well to avoid meltdowns. I'm sure you all remember his most infamous blown save, and all Victor Martinez called was fastball, after, fastball, after fastball. Neither Victor Martinez nor Jason Varitek have the ability to throw runners out, and every team knows it. Victor obviously needs to work on his mechanics considering all of his throws are high and to the right. This could create a serious problem. First of all, because the runners can steal so easily, the possibility of inning ending double plays are eliminated, which means that our pitchers will have to work longer, and that we might have to use our bullpen earlier. Also, pitching from the stretch is a tough thing for lots of pitchers. I especially noticed that with Clay Buchholz during the Spring, and even he has admitted that it's something he needs to work on. The pitchers obviously don't want the runners to steal, so they might feel added pressure to get the ball to the plate quicker. This situation could have disastrous consequences. It is important that the pitchers don't think about anything but hitting their spots. If this becomes a serious problem, the Red Sox do have some catching talent in the minors (with arms) in both Mark Wagner and Luis Exposito. Luis is definitely someone to get excited about, but he still needs some seasoning. Mark Wagner, on the other hand, is in Pawtucket, and I think he is ready to go. Some bats have been quiet (Big Papi), some have been loud (Dustin Pedroia), but the Red Sox have left so many runners on, but I think there is an easy solution that Terry Francona hasn't seen yet because he is an American League manager: small ball. Because the Red Sox focused on improving defense during the offseason, they aren't full of the 30-40 HR power bats. However, that's not to say that they aren't offensively sophisticated. They have the ability to score a lot of runs this season, but it won't come from lots of long balls. Rarely, if ever, do you see the Red Sox lay down a solid bunt. Perhaps the\n\nAuthor-choice Open Access Publishing By Phil Davis According to a study of 11 biological and medical journals that allow authors the choice of making their articles freely available from the publisher's website, few show any evidence of a citation advantage. For those that do, the effect appears to be diminishing over time. The study, \"Author-choice open access publishing in the biological and medical literature,\" (a copy of the final manuscript is also available from the arXiv) analyzed over eleven thousand articles published in journals since 2003, sixteen hundred of these articles (15%) adopting the author-choice open access model. Oxford University Press journals make up 6 of the 11 journals analyzed in the study. Since open access publication fees can amount to several thousands of dollars, the author (ok that's me) goes on to determine the cost-benefit for each additional citation. While the cost-per-additional-citation was as low as about $400 (for PNAS), it approached $9,000 for the journal Development, published by the Company of Biologists. Considering the evidence that author-choice open access publishing may have little effect on article citations, it is worthwhile for authors to consider the cost of this form of publishing. If a citation advantage is the key motivation for authors to pay open access fees, then the cost/benefit of this decision can be quite expensive for some journals. This study is a follow-up to a controlled trial of open access publishing published in BMJ where articles were randomly selected for open access or traditional subscription-access. The authors reported no difference in citations in the first year. Since the current study observes the effect of author-choice open access, self-selection may play a role in explaining the results. As the author of this study, I hope that readers do not come away with the feeling that I'm advocating against an author-choice program. There may be many benefits to making scientific results freely available; however, scientists should understand that open access may not buy them more citations. Free dissemination of the scientific literature may speed up the transfer of knowledge to industry, enable scientists in poor and developing countries to access more information, and empower the general public. There are clearly many benefits to making one's research findings freely available to the general public – a citation advantage may not be one of them.

For 1,600 of the 11,000 articles (15%), their authors paid the publisher to make them Open Access (OA). The outcome, confirming previous studies (on both paid and unpaid OA), is a significant OA citation advantage, but a small one (21%, 4% of it correlated with other article variables such as number of authors, references, and pages). The author infers that the size of the OA advantage in this biomedical sample has been shrinking annually from 2004-2007, but the data suggest the opposite. In order to draw valid conclusions from these data, the following five further analyses are necessary: (1) The current analysis is based only on author-choice (paid) OA. Free OA self-archiving needs to be taken into account too, for the same journals and years, rather than being counted as non-OA, as in the current analysis. (2) The proportion of OA articles per journal per year needs to be reported and taken into account. (3) Estimates of journal and article quality and citability in the form of the Journal Impact Factor and the relation between the size of the OA Advantage and journal as well as article \"citation-bracket\" need to be taken into account. (4) The sample-size for the highest-impact, largest-sample journal analyzed, PNAS, is restricted and is excluded from some of the analyses. An analysis of the full PNAS dataset is needed, for the entire 2004-2007 period. (5) The analysis of the interaction between OA and time, 2004-2007, is based on retrospective data from a June 2008 total cumulative citation count. The analysis needs to be redone taking into account the dates of both the cited articles and the citing articles, otherwise article-age effects and any other real-time effects from 2004-2008 are confounded. The author proposes that an author self-selection bias for providing OA to higher-quality articles (the Quality Bias, QB) is the primary cause of the observed OA Advantage, but this study does not test or show anything at all about the causal role of QB (or of any of the other potential causal factors, such as Accessibility Advantage, AA, Competitive Advantage, CA, Download Advantage, DA, Early Advantage, EA, and Quality Advantage, QA). The author also suggests that paid OA is not worth the cost, per extra citation. This is probably true, but with OA self-archiving, both the OA and the extra citations are free. By Stevan Harnad Stevan, Our study focuses on estimating the effect of author-choice open access on article citations. The 11 journals were selected because they gathered sufficient paying open access submissions as to make a statistical analysis even potentially possible. Still, if the open access effect is small, a larger sample size is required to detect a signal amongst the noise, which is why I aggregated the 11 journals for subsequent analyses. PNAS contributed so many articles in the aggregate dataset (about a third) that I didn't want this one journal to dominate the results, hence the tables report the analyses with and without PNAS. Secondly, while aggregating the journals resulted in increased statistical power, we are combining articles published in different scientific fields (biology, medicine, bioinformatics, plant sciences, and multi-disciplinary sciences), which is why journal impact factors are not used as an explanatory variable. Please note that I did include the variable Journal as either a random variable (Table 2) or a fixed variable (Table S2), so journal-to-journal variation is being accounted for in the model. By Philip Davis RE: Harnad point #4 Because of the sheer number of articles published by PNAS, tracking the performance of each article was considered too onerous. As a result, I tracked the first and last 6-month cohort of articles (June-Dec 2004; and June-Dec 2006). By choosing the first and last cohort, I could estimate a temporal trend in the data. Please remember that PNAS was only one of the 11 journals analyzed in this study, and that Gunter Eysenbach's study (PLoS Biology, 2006) analyzed only a 6-month cohort in one journal (PNAS, June-Dec, 2006). Granted, a full dataset from PNAS would have been ideal, and I encourage Prof. Harnad to gather and share the intervening years if he feels that the missing data points would change significantly the results of this study. My sense is that they won't, but will challenge Prof. Harnad to prove me wrong. I think the scientific community may be slightly different then most other industries when it comes to an exchange of information. In most industries the life cycle's are such that even if a competitor finds your research immediately they are years behind. In some scientific studies we need to make sure the researchers and developers of new technology are adequately compensated for their break throughs.

In the following experiments we focus on spatial averaging, although extension to spatiotemporal data is straightforward provided the metric is defined along the time axis. When working with a voxel grid the distance is the Euclidian distance taking into account the voxel size in millimeters, and when working on a cortical triangulation, the distance used is the geodesic distance computed on the folded cortical mantle. We now present results of a simulation study where standard averaging with Gaussian smoothing is compared to Kantorovich means. Simulation results are followed by experimental results obtained with fMRI data from 20 subjects and MEG data on a population of 16 subjects. \\paragraph{Simulation setup.} In this experiment using on a triangulation of the cortex, we simulated signals of interest in two brain regions using the functional parcellation provided by the FreeSurfer software. We used regions Broadman area 45 (BA45) and the visual area MT. We simulated for a group of 100 subjects random positive signals in these two regions. For each subject and each region, the signal is focal at a random location with a random amplitude generated with a truncated Gaussian distribution (mean 5, std. dev. 1.). We use here focal signals to exemplify the effect of optimal transport. Such signals could correspond to dipolar activations derived from MEG/EEG using dipole fitting methods~\\cite{scherg-etal:85} or sparse regression techniques~\\cite{wipf-etal:07,gramfort-etal:2013}. Figure~\\ref{fig:simu_results} presents the locations of the two regions (labels), the averages with and without Gaussian smoothing and the Kantorovich average. Gaussian smoothing leads to a highly blurred average which exceeds the extent of the regions of interest, while it also strongly reduces the amplitudes of the signals, potentially washing out the statistical effects. The peak amplitudes obtained with optimal transport are also higher and closer to the individual peak amplitudes. One can clearly observe the limitations of Gaussian smoothing, which furthermore requires to set the bandwidth of the kernel. The Kantorovich average nicely highlights two foci of signals at the group level. \\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering \\includegraphics[width=0.6\\linewidth]{fig1.pdf} \\caption{Simulation results with focal random signals generated in areas/labels BA45 (yellow) and MT (red) in a group of 100 subjects. Data are defined on a surface with 10,024 vertices (FreeSurfer fsaverage 5). One shows the standard averaging referred to as \\emph{Mean}, the averaging after Gaussian smoothing is referred to as \\emph{Mean (S)} (mean after Gaussian smoothing with FWHM=8\\,mm), and the Kantorovich mean (p=1). The result \\emph{Mean} shows the focal signals with random positions in the labels delineated in green. The Kantorovich mean highlights clear foci of activations in the ROIs without smearing the activation as with Gaussian smoothing which furthermore significantly dampens the amplitudes.} \\label{fig:simu_results} \\end{figure} \\paragraph{Results on fMRI data.} We used here fMRI data analyzed on a voxel grid. It corresponds to 20 subjects from the database described in~\\cite{pinel2007}. We average here the standardized effect of interest induced by left hand button press. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:fmri_grid_results}-a we show the Euclidian average without smoothing. In Fig.\\ref{fig:fmri_grid_results}-b we report results obtained by classical averaging following Gaussian smoothing with FWHM of 8\\,mm. Fig.\\ref{fig:fmri_grid_results}-c shows the Kantorovich mean with constrained mass. One can observe that this barycenter highlights a clear active region without requiring any kernel smoothing. It also leads to a amplitude in the average standardized effect around 1.7 which is much higher than the 0.23 obtained when smoothing. \\begin{figure}[t!] \\centering \\includegraphics[width=0.27\\linewidth]{mean_fmri.pdf} \\includegraphics[width=0.27\\linewidth]{mean_s_fmri.pdf} \\includegraphics[width=0.27\\linewidth]{ot_fmri.pdf} \\caption{Averaging of the standardized effect of interest on fMRI data.

The later result highlights a clear foci of activations in the ROI without smearing the activation nor damping the amplitudes as much as the kernel smoothing.} \\label{fig:fmri_grid_results} \\end{figure} \\paragraph{Results on MEG data.} We now evaluate the benefit of the proposed approach on experimental data. These data were acquired with a Neuromag VectorView system (Elekta Oy, Helsinki, Finland) with 306 sensors arranged in 102 triplets, each comprising two orthogonal planar gradiometers and one magnetometer. Subjects are presented with images containing faces of familiar (famous) or unfamiliar persons and so called ``scrambled'' faces. See~\\cite{henson-etal:11} for more details. Dataset contains 16 subjects. For each one, event related fields (ERF) were obtained by averaging about 200 repetitions of recordings following stimuli presentations. Data were band pass filtered between 1 and 40\\,Hz. Following standard MEG source localization pipelines~\\cite{mne}, a noise covariance was estimated from prestimulus time intervals and used for source reconstruction with the cortically constrained dSPM method~\\cite{dspm}. The values obtained with dSPM can be considered as F statistics, where high values are located in active regions. In Figure~\\ref{fig:meg_results}, we present results at a single time point, 190\\,ms after stimulus onset, which corresponds to the time instant where the dSPM amplitudes are maximum. Data correspond the visual presentation of \\emph{famous faces}. In green, is the border of the primary visual cortex (V1) provided by the FreeSurfer functional atlas. One can observe that the Kantorovich barycenter yields a more focal average nicely positioned in the middle of the calcarine fissure where V1 is located. Such a strong activation in V1 is expected in such an experiment consisting of visual stimuli. To investigate more subtle cognitive effects, such as the response of the fusiform face area (FFA) reported about 170\\,ms after stimulation in the literature~\\cite{kanwisher-etal:97,henson-etal:11}, we report results obtained on contrasts of ERFs measured after famous faces presentations \\emph{vs.} scrambled faces. As illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:meg_results_ffa}, Kantorovich mean nicely delineates a focal source of activity in the ventral part of the cortex known as the fusiform gyrus. These results show that Kantorovich means provides focal activation at the population level despite the challenging problem of inter-subject anatomo-functional variability. They avoid the smearing of the signal or statistical effects of interests which naturally occur when data are spatially smoothed before standard averaging. Note again that here no smoothing parameter with FWHM in millimeters is manually specified. Their solution only depends on the metric naturally derived from the geometry of the cortical surface. With a cortical triangulation containing 10,024 vertices and 16 subjects the computation on a Tesla K40 GPU of one barycenter takes less than 1\\,min. \\begin{figure}[h!] \\centering \\includegraphics[width=0.33\\linewidth]{test_meg_brain_L2_mean_white.png} \\includegraphics[width=0.33\\linewidth]{GradProj_test_meg_brain_ot_mean_p1_alpha00-5_white.png} \\caption{Average of dSPM estimates derived from MEG ERF data on a group of 16 subjects stimulated with pictures of famous faces.

The problem of atlas computation from images~\\cite{Joshi2004S151}, or meshes \\cite{Durrleman201435}, or the problem of group analysis from functional imaging data~\\cite{thirion-etal:2007} are particularly relevant for this field. The challenge is that natural phenomena are usually described in terms of physical and temporal event locations, along with their intensity. While Euclidean averaging is standard and has some benefits such as low computation time, this procedure ignores the geometry of the space the observations belong to; the image of an average brain image obtained by Euclidean averaging of individual voxels does not yield the image of the brain of an average individual. Starting from observations defined on a regular or irregular grid, our aim is to provide a \\emph{model-free} approach to \\emph{average} them that only builds upon geometric arguments. An example of such data are functional MRI (fMRI) data defined on a voxel grid or a triangulated cortical surface. The approach aims to be intrinsically geometric in the sense that it \\emph{only} requires the prior knowledge of a metric between the locations on the grid. The technique aims to be versatile in the sense that it can be applied to weighted samples taking values on a discretized space with no assumptions on the regularity of the metric. The approach\n\nBardo, a 1981 graduate of the Coast Guard Academy, had previously commanded the Cutters Courageous (WMEC 622), Neah Bay (WTGB 105), and Cape Wash (WPB 95310) as well as served as the Executive Officer of the Cutter Confidence (WMEC 619).345 Following the Change of Command, in the fall of 2004, Boutwell again participated in an Eastern Pacific Counterdrug Deployment. While patrolling approximately 80 miles south of El Salvador, Boutwell's embarked helicopter discovered a suspicious fishing vessel. The following day, on November 19th, Boutwell approached the Ecuadorian fishing vessel Kodiac, finding it abandoned and partially submerged. Once onboard, Boutwell's crew seized 2,100 kilograms of cocaine. On December 9th, Boutwell located a second partially submerged vessel. The 80-foot fishing vessel Jami was loaded with 108 bales of cocaine. Boutwell returned to Alameda just in time for the Holidays, arriving on December 21st.346,347 In mid February 2005, after a brief inport, Boutwell departed on a 90-day Counterdrug Deployment in the Eastern Pacific. While on patrol on March 29th, Boutwell, working with a U.S. Customs and Border Protection aircraft, located and intercepted the Ecuadorian fishing vessel Lesvos approximately 300 miles west of Mexico. Once on board, Boutwell's boarding team discovered and seized over 4,500 kilograms of cocaine, detaining the vessel's six-man crew. Over two weeks later, on April 17th, Boutwell and its HH-68 HITRON helicopter intercepted and boarded the Venezuelan-flagged fishing vessel Isis. During that boarding, Boutwell's law enforcement personnel discovered 141 bales containing over 3,200 kilograms of cocaine. The ship's 12-man crew was detained and their cargo seized. Apart from counter drug operations, Boutwell also participated in the rescue of a Mexican national 150 miles west of the Galapagos. The man, who had been adrift in his 28-foot fishing vessel Iris II for 23 days, was spotted waving a makeshift flag by Boutwell's lookout. The man was later brought aboard and treated for dehydration. On May 14th, Boutwell returned home to Alameda to offload more than 7,800 kilograms of cocaine.348,349 In late November, Boutwell again departed Alameda on a Counterdrug Deployment in the Eastern Pacific. 350 During the transit south, Boutwell stopped in San Diego to onload fuel as well as load supplies in support of Project Handclasp. The supplies, which were delivered to Tocumen, Panama, on December 31st, included medical supplies, hygiene products, school supplies, and toys for the local children. While in Tocumen, Boutwell crewmembers also assisted in painting classrooms and repairing electrical wiring at the Escuela Fuente de Amor.351 While patrolling on January 16th, Boutwell and its HITRON, working with the USS De Wert (FFG-45) and its embarked Law Enforcement Detachment 406, pursued and intercepted two go-fast vessels carrying a combined load of over 2,400 kilograms of cocaine, detaining their nine crewmembers.352,353 Four days later, Boutwell intercepted the 63-foot Columbian fishing vessel Angie Mar, employing warning shots from the embarked helicopter, as well as an entangling device from the small boat in order to stop the vessel.354 Upon boarding, Boutwell's law enforcement team seized nearly 2,300 kilograms of cocaine, detaining the vessel's 12 crewmembers. The crewmembers and contraband were later turned over to Columbian authorities. Boutwell returned home to Alameda on February 8th, having completed a highly successful 74-day patrol.355 On March 21st, following an 80-year relationship with the city, the Coast Guard officially designated Boutwell's homeport of Alameda as a \"Coast Guard City.\" The designation was in recognition of the support Alameda provided to more than 2,600 active duty, reserve, and civilian employees stationed on Coast Guard Island. At the time, only five other cities had received this honorary distinction.356 In June 2006, Captain Peter J. Brown relieved Captain Bardo as Boutwell's Commanding Officer.357 Captain Brown, a 1985 graduate of the Coast Guard Academy, had been assigned to three previous afloat units and had recently been Commanding Officer of Tactical Law Enforcement Team South in Miami, Florida.358 Shortly after taking command, Captain Brown led Boutwell on a routine Counterdrug Deployment in the Eastern Pacific. During the deployment, on August 24th, Boutwell interdicted the sinking fishing vessel Mi Panchito which was carrying over 6,700 kilograms of cocaine.359,360 On September 12th, Boutwell, along with its embarked helicopter, interdicted a go-fast vessel approximately 120 miles west of Puerto Quetzal. After intercepting the vessel, Boutwell seized over 2,900 kilograms of cocaine and detained four suspected smugglers. Five days later, Boutwell teamed with its helicopter to interdict a second go-fast vessel approximately 460 miles northeast of the Galapagos Islands. During that seizure, Boutwell recovered 590 kilograms of cocaine and detained three suspected smugglers. 361,362 On October 17th, almost a month after its previous interdiction, Boutwell intercepted and boarded the Ecuadorian fishing vessel, Ludemar, finding and seizing 90 kilograms of cocaine.363 On November 30th, 2006, Boutwell was honored at a ceremony in Alameda for her tremendous success in counterdrug operations in the fall of 2006. During the ceremony, Boutwell received four cocaine interdiction stickers for seizing nearly 23,000 pounds of cocaine related to four different cases which included the apprehension of 16 suspected smugglers. The stickers were then affixed to the ship's bridge wings on either side of the pilothouse.364 In the early months of 2007, Boutwell departed on another Eastern Pacific Counterdrug deployment. During the patrol, in mid February, Boutwell participated in the rescue of five sea turtles which were caught in an abandoned fishing net. After releasing the turtles, Boutwell's crew proceeded to remove debris from the area to prevent any further impact on marine life.365 Beginning July 22nd, 2007, Boutwell embarked on a multinational Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fisheries enforcement patrol in the High Seas Drift Net (HSDN) High Threat Area with an embarked shiprider from the Peoples Republic of China366 and South Korean observers.367 The multinational effort included cooperation from Canada, China, Russia, and Japan under the authority of the North Pacific Coast Guard Forum. The Forum, which served as a venue to foster \"multilateral cooperation through the sharing of information on matters related to combined operations, exchange of information, illegal drug trafficking, maritime security, fisheries enforcement, illegal migration, and maritime domain awareness,\" bolstered efforts in 2007 to enforce the United Nation General Assembly's 1991 resolution against high seas driftnet fishing in the Pacific. 368 As part of the North Pacific Coast Guard Forum, Boutwell visited Shanghai, China369 on August 16th370, joining the Coast Guard Pacific Area Commander, Vice Admiral Charles Wurster, to discuss joint operations.371 Boutwell departed Shanghai on August 20th.372 On August 28th, Boutwell moored in Yokosuka, Japan, to embark an officer from the China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command (CFLEC), who would assist in enforcing the United Nation's resolution on Chinese-flagged vessels.373 Six days later, Boutwell intercepted the Chinese fishing vessel Lu Rong Yu 6007 for illegal high seas driftnet fishing, turning the vessel over to Chinese authorities on September 13th. 374 On September 14th, Boutwell, with the help of her embarked helicopter, located and intercepted the Indonesian fishing vessel Fong Seng No. 818, which was rigged for illegal high seas drift net fishing. Upon counter-detecting the Coast Guard, the Fong Seng No. 818 began evasive maneuvers while attempting to hide her gear on deck. After intercepting the vessel, Boutwell determined its registry through Right of Approach questioning. Boutwell's efforts enabled the State Department to initiate a dialogue with the Government of Indonesia for prosecuting the Fong Seng No. 818. 375 During the patrol, from September 15th through the 21st, a meeting was held in Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky, Russia, known as the U.S. Coast Guard / Russian Northeast Border Guard Directorate Joint Working Group. As part of the meeting, Boutwell moored in Petropavlovsk for a mid-patrol break. Led by the Pacific Area Commander, Vice Admiral Charles Wurster, and the Seventeenth District Commander, Rear Admiral Arthur Brooks, Coast Guard representatives met with the Chief, Northeast Border Guard Directorate Lieutenant\n\nA company will start constructing an innovative new consumer credit account quite similar for a customer will do.
