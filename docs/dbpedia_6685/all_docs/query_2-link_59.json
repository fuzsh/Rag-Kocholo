All those concerned with healthcare and how to obtain personally relevant medical information form a large additional target group\n\nMany Medical Informatics programs–both in the United States and abroad–include a course in Consumer Health Informatics as part of their curriculum. This book, designed for use in a classroom, will be the first textbook dedicated solely to the specific concerns of consumer health informatics\n\nConsumer Health Informatics is an interactive text; filled with case studies and discussion questions\n\nWith international authorship and edited by five leaders in the field, Consumer Health Informatics has tapped some of the best resources in informatics today"
