        "text": "Woodburn Solar Power Information & Peak Sun Hours\n\nSolar Green Energy Summary for Woodburn, Oregon\n\nLattitude: 45.1477\n\nSunlight\n\nFixed Tilt Sunlight Hours: 5 hours per day\n\n1-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 6.7 hours per day\n\n2-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 7.2 hours per day\n\nIt goes without saying that throughout the year the amount of sunlight in any given day is going to vary. The time of year and weather will have a strong influence on daily sunshine. Looking at the average amount of peak sunshine hours in a day during an entire year stretch is a valuable exercise when trying to determine the amount and type of solar panels you need to install to power your business or your home. 5 peak sun hours means that in Woodburn on average there are 5 hours a day where the sun is strong enough for solar panels to harness its energy. This number is less than the amount of total sunlight hours in a day because there are times during the day (ex. sunrise and sunset) where the sun is not strong enough to benefit solar panels.\n\nYour latitude is an indicator of when the sunrises and sunsets and certain times of the year. If you live near the equator with a latitude of near zero, the sun will rise and set close to the same time all year resulting in consistent total sunlight hours per day. If you live near the poles, the time of sunrise and sunset will vary dramatically with each season, resulting in long days for part of the year and very short days at other times. So, locations closer to the equator will have more consistent amounts of peak sun hours throughout the year than locations closer to the poles.\n\nThere are a few ways to increase average peak sun hours per year for your solar power system. One way is to use a tracking mount solar panel instead of a fixed tilt solar panel. A 1-axis mount will track the sun throughout the sky from sunrise to sunset, giving your panel a more efficient facing direction towards the sun throughout the day. A 2-axis solar panel will track the sun in the sky throughout the day, but also change and follow the angle of the sun in the sky throughout the year. Both of these axis system solar panels will produce higher average peak sun hours than a fixed solar panel.\n\nWeather is a big determinate of average peak sun hours each day. There are many aspects of weather that can increase or lessen the peak sun hours in a day in a particular location. For example cloud coverage is a crucial variable. And more importantly, what type of cloud coverage; thin scattered clouds will have less diminishing power on the solar insolation than thick rainy storm clouds. Sometimes long periods of sunny days are rare in certain locations, this would increase average peak sun hours for that time-frame\n\nThe average daily peak sunlight hours in Woodburn, Oregon is 5 hours. Use this number when trying to calculate your solar needs in Woodburn. As you can see above, if you were to use a 1-Axis or 2-Axis panel then the daily average would increase to 6.7 hour and 7.2 hours, respectively.\n\nSolar Businesses in Woodburn, Oregon\n\nBe the first to hear about the latest green energy news, technology and offers.\n\n[mc4wp_form id=\"2942\"]\n\nBy providing your email you consent to receiving occasional promotional emails & newsletters.\n\nNo Spam.
