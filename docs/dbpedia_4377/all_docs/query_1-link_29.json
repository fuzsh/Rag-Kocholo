Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Woodburn is essentially constant during the fall, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 12, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Fall in Woodburn\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Fall in WoodburnSepOctNov0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%SummerWinterSep 10%Sep 10%Nov 300%Nov 300%Oct 10%Oct 10%Nov 10%Nov 10%NowNowcomfortablecomfortabledrydryhumidhumid\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Woodburn is increasing during the fall, increasing from 4.3 miles per hour to 6.1 miles per hour over the course of the season.\n\nFor reference, on December 2, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.1 miles per hour, while on August 8, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 4.2 miles per hour.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Fall in Woodburn\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Fall in WoodburnSepOctNov0 mph0 mph2 mph2 mph4 mph4 mph6 mph6 mph8 mph8 mph10 mph10 mphSummerWinterSep 14.3 mphSep 14.3 mphNov 306.1 mphNov 306.1 mphOct 14.6 mphOct 14.6 mphNov 15.3 mphNov 15.3 mphNowNow\n\nThe wind direction in Woodburn during the fall is predominantly out of the north from September 1 to October 3 and the south from October 3 to November 30.\n\nWind Direction in the Fall in Woodburn\n\nWind Direction in the Fall in WoodburnNSSepOctNov0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%SummerWinterNowNowwestsoutheastnorth\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nWater Temperature\n\nWoodburn is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake).

In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Woodburn are rapidly increasing during the fall, increasing by 592Â°F, from 1,897Â°F to 2,489Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Fall in Woodburn\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Fall in WoodburnSepOctNov1,800Â°F1,800Â°F2,000Â°F2,000Â°F2,200Â°F2,200Â°F2,400Â°F2,400Â°F2,600Â°F2,600Â°FSummerWinterSep 11,897Â°FSep 11,897Â°FNov 302,489Â°FNov 302,489Â°FOct 12,277Â°FOct 12,277Â°FNov 12,452Â°FNov 12,452Â°FNowNow\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Woodburn is very rapidly decreasing during the fall, falling by 4.5 kWh, from 5.6 kWh to 1.1 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Fall in Woodburn\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Fall in WoodburnSepOctNov0 kWh0 kWh1 kWh1 kWh2 kWh2 kWh3 kWh3 kWh4 kWh4 kWh5 kWh5 kWh6 kWh6 kWh7 kWh7 kWh8 kWh8 kWhSummerWinterSep 15.6 kWhSep 15.6 kWhNov 301.1 kWhNov 301.1 kWhOct 13.8 kWhOct 13.8 kWhNov 12.0 kWhNov 12.0 kWhNowNow\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Woodburn are 45.144 deg latitude, -122.855 deg longitude, and 184 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Woodburn is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 85 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 178 feet. Within 10 miles is essentially flat (873 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (5,669 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Woodburn is covered by cropland (54%) and artificial surfaces (46%), within 10 miles by cropland (89%) and artificial surfaces (11%), and within 50 miles by trees (42%) and cropland (28%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Woodburn, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Woodburn.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Woodburn according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Woodburn is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Woodburn and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nAurora State Airport (KUAO, 56%, 8 mi, northeast, 10 ft elevation change)\n\nMc Minnville Municipal Airport (KMMV, 26%, 14 mi, west, -26 ft elevation change)\n\nMcNary Field (KSLE, 18%, 18 mi, southwest, 20 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Woodburn and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
