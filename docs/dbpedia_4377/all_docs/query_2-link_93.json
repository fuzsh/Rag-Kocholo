        "text": "The City of Woodburn will begin leaf pickup on October 9th, 2023, and will continue as needed for approximately a month. On Mondays and Wednesdays throughout pickup, the East/West roads will be priority and on Tuesdays and Thursdays throughout pickup, the North/South roads will be priority. Given the number of locations to consider, please understand that you may not be collected on the day that you expect. If you have questions or concerns, feel free to call City Hall at 260-632-5318.\n\nThere also is a site for dropping off compost off of Tile Mill road just past the shop as you turn off of 101. If, for some reason you have not had your leaves picked up at the end the time for collection, please take your remaining leaves to the compost site. The City currently does not pick up leaves outside of the City limits. If you have any questions, feel free to contact Ryan Walls at 260-450-2410."
