It was reporting extended no parking zones along the intersections of 8th and Indiana. The yellow paint extended an extra three to five feet, removing parking spots for one or two cars. The afmormentioned message is in the attached file. The resolution states that the curb has been corrected and there will be updated neighborhood signs, but what does that mean? Thank you.\n\nopen #192862\n\nBlocked Sidewalk\n\n116 E 3rd St Suite 101\n\nCase Date:\n\n8/13/2024\n\nSidewalk has been blocked for DAYS with barricades on 3rd street between Walnut and Washington. This is a route to Transit and the Police Station. No one seems to be working there, so why is it blocked? This blocks businesses and is just a pain to get around. Why doesn’t the city have people who help keep the sidewalks open??\n\nclosed #192861\n\nBlocked Sidewalk\n\n116 E 3rd St Suite 101\n\nCase Date:\n\n8/13/2024\n\nSidewalk has been blocked for DAYS with barricades on 3rd street between Walnut and Washington.

These animals may not have food or water. I believe there are possibly 2 pit bulls so use caution.\n\nopen #192859\n\nParks & Playgrounds\n\n4698 S Leonard Springs RD\n\nCase Date:\n\n8/13/2024\n\nThe street apron at the entrance to Leonard Springs Nature Park is badly eroded, to the point where vehicles can bottom out and scrape against the edge of the remaining asphalt. This happens even when turning very slowly and carefully into the park. I believe it needs to be filled in with road base and topped with asphalt or concrete.
