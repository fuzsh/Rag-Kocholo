        "text": "Solar PV Analysis of Woodburn\n\nList of Solar PV Installers for Woodburn, United States\n\nWoodburn, Oregon, in the United States is a decent location for generating energy through solar PV systems throughout the year. However, it's not equally effective in all seasons.\n\nDuring summer and spring months, you can expect to generate a good amount of electricity from your solar panels. In summer, each kW of installed solar can produce 7.15kWh/day while in spring it can yield 5.52kWh/day. These are ideal times to get maximum output from your solar installation at this location.\n\nOn the other hand, autumn and winter see a significant drop in production with each kW of installed solar producing only 2.96kWh/day and 1.42 kWh/day respectively due to shorter days and less sunlight.\n\nTo maximize total annual production from your solar PV system at this location, it's recommended that you tilt your panels at an angle of 37 degrees facing South if they're fixed installations.\n\nAs far as environmental or weather factors that could potentially hinder production go; Woodburn experiences frequent rain especially during fall and winter which could reduce system performance due to less direct sunlight reaching the panels on cloudy days or when they're wet.\n\nPreventative measures include installing panels with self-cleaning surfaces or arranging for regular cleaning services during these rainy months so that dirt or grime doesn't accumulate on them reducing their efficiency further. Additionally, using high-quality inverters will ensure better performance even under low light conditions which is common during overcast days typical to this region’s climate.\n\nIt's also important to consider any potential shading issues caused by nearby trees or buildings blocking direct sunlight onto your panels - trimming back foliage where possible would be beneficial here.\n\nIn conclusion: While Woodburn isn’t perfect for year-round maximum productivity due its weather patterns (with lower outputs expected particularly in autumn and winter), careful planning around panel positioning combined with regular maintenance should still allow for reasonable power generation across all seasons overall.\n\nNote: The Northern Temperate Zone extends from 35° latitude North up to 66.5° latitude.\n\nSo far, we have conducted calculations to evaluate the solar photovoltaic (PV) potential in 1348 locations across the United States. This analysis provides insights into each city/location's potential for harnessing solar energy through PV installations.\n\nLink: Solar PV potential in the United States by location\n\nSolar output per kW of installed solar PV by season in Woodburn\n\nSeasonal solar PV output for Latitude: 45.1402, Longitude: -122.861 (Woodburn, United States), based on our analysis of 8760 hourly intervals of solar and meteorological data (one whole year) retrieved for that set of coordinates/location from NASA POWER (The Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources) API:\n\n&nbsp\n\nIdeally tilt fixed solar panels 37° South in Woodburn, United States\n\nTo maximize your solar PV system's energy output in Woodburn, United States (Lat/Long 45.1402, -122.861) throughout the year, you should tilt your panels at an angle of 37° South for fixed panel installations.\n\nAs the Earth revolves around the Sun each year, the maximum angle of elevation of the Sun varies by +/- 23.45 degrees from its equinox elevation angle for a particular latitude. Finding the exact optimal angle to maximise solar PV production throughout the year can be challenging, but with careful consideration of historical solar energy and meteorological data for a certain location, it can be done precisely.\n\nWe use our own calculation, which incorporates NASA solar and meteorological data for the exact Lat/Long coordinates, to determine the ideal tilt angle of a solar panel that will yield maximum annual solar output. We calculate the optimal angle for each day of the year, taking into account its contribution to the yearly total PV potential at that specific location.\n\nAt Latitude: 45.1402, Longitude: -122.861, the ideal angle to tilt panels is 37° South\n\nSeasonally adjusted solar panel tilt angles for Woodburn, United States\n\nIf you can adjust the tilt angle of your solar PV panels, please refer to the seasonal tilt angles below for optimal solar energy production in Woodburn, United States. As mentioned earlier, for fixed-panel solar PV installations, it is optimal to maintain a 37° South tilt angle throughout the year.\n\nOverall Best Summer Angle Overall Best Autumn Angle Overall Best Winter Angle Overall Best Spring Angle 29° South in Summer 48° South in Autumn 59° South in Winter 37° South in Spring\n\nAssuming you can modify the tilt angle of your solar PV panels throughout the year, you can optimize your solar generation in Woodburn, United States as follows: In Summer, set the angle of your panels to 29° facing South. In Autumn, tilt panels to 48° facing South for maximum generation. During Winter, adjust your solar panels to a 59° angle towards the South for optimal energy production. Lastly, in Spring, position your panels at a 37° angle facing South to capture the most solar energy in Woodburn, United States.\n\nOur recommendations take into account more than just latitude and Earth's position in its elliptical orbit around the Sun. We also incorporate historical solar and meteorological data from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) API to assign a weight to each ideal angle for each day based on its historical contribution to overall solar PV potential during a specific season.\n\nThis approach allows us to provide much more accurate recommendations than relying solely on latitude, as it considers unique weather conditions in different locations sharing the same latitude worldwide.\n\nCalculate solar panel row spacing in Woodburn, United States\n\nWe've added a feature to calculate minimum solar panel row spacing by location. Enter your panel size and orientation below to get the minimum spacing in Woodburn, United States.\n\nOur calculation method\n\nSolar Position:\n\nWe determine the Sun's position on the Winter solstice using the location's latitude and solar declination.\n\nShadow Projection:\n\nWe calculate the shadow length cast by panels using trigonometry, considering panel tilt and the Sun's elevation angle.\n\nMinimum Spacing:\n\nWe add the shadow length to the horizontal space occupied by tilted panels.\n\nThis approach ensures maximum space efficiency while avoiding shading during critical times, as the Winter solstice represents the worst-case scenario for shadow length.\n\nPlease enter information above to calculate panel spacing.\n\nTopography for solar PV around Woodburn, United States\n\nWoodburn, Oregon, United States is located in the Willamette Valley. The topography of this region is characterized by flat and fertile plains surrounded by mountain ranges - the Cascade Range to the east and the Coast Range to the west. It also has a number of rivers flowing through it.\n\nFor large-scale solar PV installations, areas with flat or gently sloping terrain are generally preferred as they require less site preparation and can accommodate larger arrays more easily. Therefore, the plains within Willamette Valley would be suited for such projects. However, considering that Oregon's climate is not particularly sunny compared to other states like California or Arizona, it might not be optimal for solar power generation.\n\nHowever, technological advances have made it possible for solar panels to generate electricity even under cloudy conditions though at lower efficiencies. Hence sites with good south-facing exposure free from shading (from trees, buildings etc.) should be considered too.\n\nIn addition to these geographical considerations, factors such as proximity to transmission lines and substations (for connection to grid), land use regulations (zoning laws), environmental impact assessments etc., will also play a significant role in determining suitable locations for large scale solar PV projects.\n\nUnited States solar PV Stats as a country\n\nUnited States ranks 2nd in the world for cumulative solar PV capacity, with 95,209 total MW's of solar PV installed. This means that 3.40% of United States's total energy as a country comes from solar PV (that's 26th in the world). Each year United States is generating 289 Watts from solar PV per capita (United States ranks 15th in the world for solar PV Watts generated per capita). [source]\n\nAre there incentives for businesses to install solar in United States?\n\nYes, there are several incentives for businesses wanting to install solar energy in the United States. These include federal tax credits, state and local rebates, net metering policies, and renewable energy certificates (RECs). Additionally, many states have enacted legislation that requires utilities to purchase a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources such as solar.\n\nDo you have more up to date information than this on incentives towards solar PV projects in United States?
