In Woodburn, the chance of a wet day over the course of May is decreasing, starting the month at 33% and ending it at 29%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 58% on November 26, and its lowest chance is 4% on August 3.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during May in Woodburn is decreasing, starting the month at 3.0 inches, when it rarely exceeds 5.0 inches or falls below 1.2 inches, and ending the month at 2.2 inches, when it rarely exceeds 4.2 inches or falls below 0.6 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of May in Woodburn, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 5 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 2 minutes, 10 seconds, and weekly increase of 15 minutes, 8 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is May 1, with 14 hours, 19 minutes of daylight and the longest day is May 31, with 15 hours, 24 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Woodburn is 5:59 AM on May 1 and the earliest sunrise is 32 minutes earlier at 5:27 AM on May 31.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 8:18 PM on May 1 and the latest sunset is 33 minutes later at 8:51 PM on May 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Woodburn during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during May, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:24 AM and sets 15 hours, 38 minutes later, at 9:02 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:47 AM and sets 8 hours, 45 minutes later, at 4:32 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Woodburn is essentially constant during May, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 12, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Woodburn is essentially constant during May, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 4.5 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on December 2, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.1 miles per hour, while on August 8, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 4.2 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Woodburn throughout May is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 44% on May 29.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nWoodburn is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Woodburn is gradually increasing during May, rising by 3Â°F, from 52Â°F to 55Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Woodburn typically lasts for 7.3 months (225 days), from around March 28 to around November 8, rarely starting before February 21 or after April 28, and rarely ending before October 15 or after December 5.\n\nThe month of May in Woodburn is very likely fully within the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season gradually increasing from 92% to 100% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in May in Woodburn\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Woodburn are increasing during May, increasing by 229Â°F, from 209Â°F to 437Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Woodburn is gradually increasing during May, rising by 0.8 kWh, from 5.3 kWh to 6.2 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Woodburn are 45.144 deg latitude, -122.855 deg longitude, and 184 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Woodburn is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 85 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 178 feet. Within 10 miles is essentially flat (873 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (5,669 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Woodburn is covered by cropland (54%) and artificial surfaces (46%), within 10 miles by cropland (89%) and artificial surfaces (11%), and within 50 miles by trees (42%) and cropland (28%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Woodburn, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Woodburn.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Woodburn according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Woodburn is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Woodburn and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nAurora State Airport (KUAO, 56%, 8 mi, northeast, 10 ft elevation change)\n\nMc Minnville Municipal Airport (KMMV, 26%, 14 mi, west, -26 ft elevation change)\n\nMcNary Field (KSLE, 18%, 18 mi, southwest, 20 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Woodburn and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
