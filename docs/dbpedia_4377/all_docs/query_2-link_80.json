        "text": "WINTER HOURS BEGIN OCT. 10\n\nWe’re adjusting our store hours for the season. The stores will still be open 7 days a week, we’re just closing an hour earlier during the week. Starting Oct. 10th, the Canby & Woodburn ReStores will be open 9 am to 6 pm Monday through Saturday and 12 to 5 pm on Sundays. The stores will return to normal hours March 20th.\n\nThank you for supporting North Willamette Valley Habitat for Humanity by shopping at our ReStores!\n\nOur volunteers have a lot of roles to fill-- from providing helpful customer service to creating DIY projects and displays, to painting store signs and organizing stock. We'll assess your natural abilities to find a place where you'll fit in and a role that interests you."
