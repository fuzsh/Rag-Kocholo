Admission is $10 adults (kids 12 and under free). See Membership page. Pay at the gatekeeper drop box at the front entrance (cash or check only). Stroll through the gardens, have a picnic and just enjoy the serenity of the flowers, plants and trees. The house and museum will be closed now until Lilac Days 2025. The Hulda Klager Lilac Gardens is a restoration project to honor the work of famed lilac developer Hulda Klager. It contains an 1800s house and surrounding buildings and Gardens. It is a National Historic Site. In 2023 we opened the museum with many new exhibits. Annually, Lilac Days celebrates the site, Hulda’s work and raises funds to maintain the site. See Today in the Gardens for current status and updates. Event rentals are available, as approved, by contacting us.\n\n*There will be a few exceptions and closures, so please see the Calendar at our website for current closures. Closed on Holidays, too."
