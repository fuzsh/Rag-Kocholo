Homes were wrecked near Kuykendall's Store west of Bowling Green and in Davenport on Barren River Pike. Three houses and four barns were blown into the Barren River at Thomas Landing, injuring ten people. A car was blown off the road, over a fence, and into a field. The vehicle landed on its tires and the driver survived, despite the top half of the car getting sheared off. Additional damage occurred in the Richardsville area. In Edmonson County, barns and a hotel were torn apart near Mammoth Cave National Park, along with the home of a cave tour guide. In Hart County the tornado and its attendant straight-line winds mowed down a path five miles wide. Three people were injured as houses were unroofed and barns destroyed. Canmer and Woodsonville were the hardest struck districts. Seven barns were blown down near Munfordville.\n\nApril 3, 1957\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F1\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries:\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 5:30pm\n\nGrazulis Narrative:\n\nNoted discrepancies: SPC gives a path length of 1/10 of a mile...NCDC gives nothing. SPC gives a path width of 10 yards, NCDC gives nothing.\n\nApril 22, 1958\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F1\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries:\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 9:00am\n\nNoted discrepancies: SPC gives a path length of 1/10 of a mile...NCDC gives nothing.

A six room brick veneer home was completely destroyed, as were several large trailers. There were two injuries in one, and a death in another. Many homes sustained damage. South Hill, where several people were injured and trailers were swept away, and Dunbar were especially hard hit. Cherry Chapel Church near Richardsville was destroyed. Damage was found along Stringtown Road in Butler County.\n\nNoted discrepancies: SPC and NCDC list no injuries, Grazulis lists 20, Storm Data lists 7. SPC lists a path length of 27 miles, NCDC 28 miles, Grazulis and Storm Data 30 miles. Grazulis ends this tornado closer to Riverside, SPC and NCDC end it closer to Richardsville (both in Warren County). According to Storm Data, radar first showed a hook echo four miles east of Drakesboro. The storm struck South Hill, 1.75 miles east of Ennis, and \"probably\" on to Riverside and Richardsville.\n\nDecember 15, 1971\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F0\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries:\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 8:30am\n\nNoted discrepancies: Storm Data says this tornado touched down at Beech Bend Park four miles northwest of Bowling Green...should say northeast.\n\nMay 10, 1973\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F1\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries:\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 10:45am\n\nGrazulis narrative:\n\nNoted discrepancies: SPC gives a path width of 10 yards, NCDC 30 yards.\n\nNotes: Storm Data reports damage on the north side of Bowling Green.\n\nJune 20, 1973\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F1\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries:\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 8:00pm\n\nNoted discrepancies: SPC gives a path width of 10 yards, NCDC 30 yards. The SPC and NCDC longitude (-88.45) for this tornado is in Marshall County. If changed to -86.45 it is in Warren County (right in Bowling Green). Storm Data reports damage on a farm just south of Bowling Green. Even if using -86.45, that would put the tornado right in the city of Bowling Green, not on a farm south of town. More research reveals that this very small tornado hit the Kenneth Hardcastle property between Hardcastle and Greenhill east-southeast of Bowling Green.\n\nApril 3, 1974\n\nCounties: Simpson, Warren, Barren\n\nF-scale: F3\n\nDeaths: 3\n\nInjuries: 57\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 3:45pm\n\nGrazulis narrative: Moved northeast from west of Gold City to east of Smiths Grove. One person was killed in Simpson County at Temperance as seven homes and 40 barns were destroyed. Two people died in Warren County: one at Three Forks and one at Rocky Springs.\n\nNoted discrepancies: SPC, NCDC, and Grazulis give a time of 3:45pm...Storm Data says 4:45pm. SPC and NCDC give a path length of 31 miles...Grazulis says 25 miles. SPC gives a path width of 10 yards...NCDC 30 yards...Grazulis nothing.\n\nMay 12, 1978\n\nCounties: Butler, Warren\n\nF-scale: F2\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 400 yards\n\nPath length: 15 miles\n\nTime: 9:45pm\n\nGrazulis narrative: Moved east-northeast from six miles south of Morgantown near KY 79, damaging or destroying three farm homes and fifteen barns.\n\nNotes: A home was moved off its foundation and lost a wall on \"Guy Hadley\" (Hadley Shearer?) Road. Trees were uprooted and a car was lifted and spun around.\n\nNoted discrepancies: This tornado is not included in the SPC database or at the NCDC website (despite listing 32 tornadoes elsewhere across the country that day), but is listed in Storm Data and Grazulis. The Bowling Green newspaper said the damage occurred around 10:30pm.\n\nAugust 11, 1983\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F1\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries: 6\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 2:00pm\n\nNotes: Storm Data says this tornado struck the Greenwood Trailer Park on the north side of Bowling Green.\n\nJuly 26, 1984\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F1\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries:\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 4:00pm\n\nNotes: Storm data places this tornado just south of Smiths Grove.\n\nMarch 22, 1991\n\nCounties: Logan, Warren (from Todd)\n\nF-scale: F2\n\nDeaths: 1\n\nInjuries: 12\n\nPath width: 400 yards\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 5:50pm\n\nGrazulis narrative: Skipped northeast from 6 1/2 miles southeast of Trenton to southwest of Allensville to near Lickskillet to near Auburn and Richardsville. Southeast of Trenton the tornado was on the ground for a mile and a half and destroyed a barn and a trailer. Twelve homes were destroyed in the touchdown near Allensville. Churches and a tied-down trailer were destroyed near Lickskillet. An 11-year-old boy was killed in the trailer. Several barns were destroyed farther to the northeast.\n\nNoted discrepancies: SPC and NCDC give a path length of 39 miles, Grazulis gives 45 miles, and Storm Data says 25 miles.\n\nApril 15, 1994\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F1\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries:\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 9:15am\n\nNoted discrepancies: Not listed at NCDC.\n\nMay 18, 1995\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F2\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 100 yards\n\nPath length: 2 1/2 miles\n\nTime: 4:25pm\n\nGrazulis narrative: A tornado moved northeast from five miles west of Bowling Green. Homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.\n\nNoted discrepancies: This tornado is not listed at NCDC. However, in addition to Grazulis' information, the Bowling Green newspaper reported tornado damage on Hammett Hill Road.\n\nMay 18, 1995\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F2\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 100 yards\n\nPath length: 1 1/2 miles\n\nTime: 4:30pm\n\nGrazulis narrative: A tornado was intermittently on the ground near Bowling Green. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed on the north side of Bowling Green.\n\nNoted discrepancies: This tornado is not listed at NCDC.\n\nMay 18, 1995\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F2\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 100 yards\n\nPath length: 5 miles\n\nTime: 4:47pm\n\nGrazulis narrative: A tornado was intermittently on the ground about five miles east of Bowling Green. Several homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.\n\nNoted discrepancies: This tornado is not listed at NCDC. However, in addition to Grazulis' information, the Bowling Green newspaper reported tornado damage on Porter Pike.\n\nMarch 1, 1997\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F0\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries:\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 4:26am\n\nNotes: Storm Data puts this tornado on Garrett Hollow Road.\n\nJune 16, 1997\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F0\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries:\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 6:21pm\n\nNotes: Storm Data puts this tornado at Richardsville.\n\nApril 16, 1998\n\nCounties: Logan, Warren, Allen, Barren\n\nF-scale: F3\n\nDeaths: 2\n\nInjuries: 9\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length: 58 miles\n\nTime: 2:35pm\n\nNotes: After researching this tornado (see discrepancies below), including reviewing radar data, it appears this tornado touched down at Chandlers Chapel in northeast Logan County, moving through Warren County crossing I-65 about seven and a half miles south of Bowling Green, continuing eastward into northernmost Allen County passing just north of Meador, then turning to the northeast near Finny, Haywood, three miles south of Glasgow, and ending at the Metcalfe County line near where the parkway crosses the border. The worst damage was in Barren County. Homes on Needmore School Road southwest of Haywood were extensively damaged, and a mobile home was flipped over near the intersection of Riddle Road and KY 249. In Glasgow one person was killed in his mobile home and another was killed by flying debris. In the Glasgow area one house was destroyed (F3 damage) and 45 badly damaged. Winds estimated at 175mph near Glasgow damaged or destroyed 35 mobile homes and 25 barns.\n\nNoted discrepancies: SPC mistakenly replaces Warren County with Lawrence County. SPC gives a beginning latitude of 36.92...NCDC gives 36.95. SPC gives a path width of 100 yards, NCDC gives 200 yards. The lat/lons given for this event are all over the place. Going by the beginning lat/lon in Logan County and the ending lat/lon in Barren County, the track would go through the south side of Glasgow and would end at the Barren/Metcalfe county line, which agrees with the narrative given at NCDC. However, this path would completely miss Allen County. Storm Data has it in Logan County (Chandlers Chapel to six miles east of Chandlers Chapel), Warren County (ten miles southwest of Bowling Green to sixteen miles southeast of Bowling Green), Allen County (three miles west of Meador to two miles east of Meador), and Barren County (fourteen miles southwest of Glasgow to ten miles east of Glasgow, with Glasgow hard hit).\n\nMay 24, 2000\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F0\n\nDeaths:\n\nInjuries:\n\nPath width:\n\nPath length:\n\nTime: 6:45pm\n\nNoted discrepancies: SPC lists a path width of 20 yards, NCDC 27 yards, Storm Data 25 yards.\n\nNovember 15, 2005\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: F1\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 150 yards\n\nPath length: 1 mile\n\nTime: 6:07pm\n\nNotes: This tornado touched down in the Woodburn area. It did F1 damage to at least three businesses, six homes, and numerous barns and outbuildings.\n\nJune 11, 2009\n\nCounties: Warren, Edmonson, Barren\n\nEF-scale: EF1\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 150 yards\n\nPath length: 18 miles (skipping)\n\nTime: 7:00pm CDT\n\nNotes: This tornado touched down along the Edmonson/Warren county line between Brownsville and Bowling Green. It moved to the east-southeast, passing just north of Smiths Grove, west of Hays, and dissipating at Beckton west of Glasgow. Many trees were snapped or uprooted, and farms in the path suffered roof and outbuilding damage. Cornfields were flattened and convergent wind signatures could be seen in the vegetation.\n\nOctober 26, 2010\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nF-scale: EF1\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 60 yards\n\nPath length: 2.2 miles\n\nTime: 11:08am CDT\n\nNotes: A tree was uprooted at the beginning of the track. As the tornado crossed Cemetery Road it damaged a home. A barn was unroofed near the end of the track. Damage was intermittent along the 2.2 mile long, 60 yard wide path.\n\nMarch 2, 2012\n\nCounties: Warren\n\nEF-Scale: EF-1\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 60 yards\n\nPath length: 0.5 mile\n\nTime: 4:06pm CST\n\nNotes: Straight line winds along and north of the supercell moving through Simpson County uprooted shallow-rooted hardwood and softwood trees and destroyed a tool shed on Evans Rd. As it moved into Warren County, it damaged barn roofs and produced golf ball size hail which penetrated siding on numerous vinyl sided houses. As it reached 961 east of Alvaton in Warren County, it spawned an EF1 tornado with winds estimated at 95 mph destroying a barn and tool shed.\n\nJanuary 30, 2013\n\nCounty: Warren\n\nEF-Scale: EF2\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 250 yards\n\nPath length: 3.3 miles\n\nTime: 3:38am CST\n\nNotes: Four grain bins were scattered over a quarter mile, with some debris thrown up to a half mile away. Fencing with 8\" posts was torn down. A semi truck was flipped as the tornado crossed Interstate 65. Towards the end of the path a barn was destroyed and a 100 by 300 foot well-built metal outbuilding was destroyed.\n\nMarch 1, 2017\n\nCounty: Warren\n\nEF-Scale: EF1\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 125 yards\n\nPath length: 2.6 miles\n\nTime: 7:24am - 7:28am CST\n\nNotes: The tornado touched down east of Interstate 65 near Claypool. Several residences and barns suffered extensive damage along Cemetery Road and Martinsville Ford Road. Peak winds were around 110 mph.\n\nFebruary 24, 2018\n\nCounty: Warren, Barren\n\nEF-Scale: EF1\n\nDeaths: 0\n\nInjuries: 0\n\nPath width: 50 yards\n\nPath length: 1.6 miles\n\nTime: 5:19pm - 5:21pm CST\n\nNotes: Touchdown occurred near the intersection of Hays Pondsville Road and FH Roundtree Road where a small metal shed was destroyed, a trailer was overturned, a fence was flattened, and a home suffered minor roof damage. The narrow tornado continued northeast, uprooting trees and damaging outbuildings, breaking out all of the windows of one building. It then tore the porch off the east side of a home on the south side of US 68/80, depositing debris into nearby woods. Crossing the highway the tornado did its greatest damage, tearing a very large pine tree out of the ground and tossing it 100 feet over a home, splattering the front of the home with mud, ripping holes in the roof, and destroying the attached garage. The tornado continued to snap trees and damage outbuildings on its way northeast, scattering debris a quarter mile downwind. The tornado damaged the roof of a home and did porch, deck, and roof damage to a neighboring residence, plastering the east side of the home with insulation. Crossing over Lewis Road into Barren County, the roof of a sunroom was torn off of a home and an outbuilding destroyed."
