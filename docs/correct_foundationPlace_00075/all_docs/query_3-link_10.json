There are no rules about the number of words you can put on a line or where you must break a line. However, for readability, all examples and most syntax statements in this manual are formatted so that each clause of a statement begins on a new line. Clauses that have more than one part extend to additional lines, which are indented. Complex commands are formatted using modified Backus Naur Form (BNF) notation.\n\nTable 1 shows the conventions for syntax statements that appear in this manual:\n\nSyntax statements (displaying the syntax and all options for a command) appear as follows:\n\nsp_dropdevice [device_name]\n\nFor a command with more options:\n\nselect column_name Â Â Â Â from table_name Â Â Â Â where search_conditions\n\nIn syntax statements, keywords (commands) are in normal font and identifiers are in lowercase. Italic font shows user-supplied words.\n\nExamples showing the use of Transact-SQL commands are printed like this:\n\nselect * from publishers\n\nExamples of output from the computer appear as follows:\n\npub_idÂ Â Â Â pub_nameÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â cityÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â state -------Â Â Â ---------------------Â Â Â -----------Â Â Â ----- 0736Â Â Â Â Â Â New Age BooksÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â BostonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â MA 0877Â Â Â Â Â Â Binnet & HardleyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â WashingtonÂ Â Â Â DC 1389Â Â Â Â Â Â Algodata InfosystemsÂ Â Â Â BerkeleyÂ Â Â Â Â Â CA (3 rows affected)\n\nIn this manual, most of the examples are in lowercase. However, you can disregard case when typing Transact-SQL keywords. For example, SELECT, Select, and select are the same.\n\nAdaptive Server sensitivity to the case of database objects, such as table names, depends on the sort order installed on Adaptive Server. You can change case sensitivity for single-byte character sets by reconfiguring the Adaptive Server sort order. For more information, see the System Administration Guide.\n\nAccessibility features\n\nThis document is available in an HTML version that is specialized for accessibility. You can navigate the HTML with an adaptive technology such as a screen reader, or view it with a screen enlarger.\n\nAdaptive Server HTML documentation has been tested for compliance with U.S. government Section 508 Accessibility requirements. Documents that comply with Section 508 generally also meet non-U.S. accessibility guidelines, such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) guidelines for Web sites.\n\nFor information about how Sybase supports accessibility, see Sybase Accessibility. The Sybase Accessibility site includes links to information on Section 508 and W3C standards.\n\nIf you need help\n\nEach Sybase installation that has purchased a support contract has one or more designated people who are authorized to contact Sybase Technical Support. If you cannot resolve a problem using the manuals or online help, please have the designated person contact Sybase Technical Support or the Sybase subsidiary in your area."
