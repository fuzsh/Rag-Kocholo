        "text": "Which Careers Require Knowledge of SQL?\n\nIf you’re interested in learning SQL, the chances are good that you probably have a career path in mind — but there’s no reason to limit yourself! Knowing your options can help you broaden your horizons and identify a career path that suits your skills and interests. Below, we’ve listed a few career paths that require SQL knowledge.\n\nSoftware developer\n\nAs their title suggests, software developers are coders who focus on designing, developing and implementing software programs. These professionals work to automate various functions and produce flowcharts to facilitate smooth, efficient operations. Software developers also use databases to store and manage user information, so mastery of SQL is critical.\n\nDatabase developer\n\nDatabase developers are responsible for ensuring that database management systems (DBMS) can effectively handle immense amounts of data. Because of the nature of the work, database developers often work alongside software developers. Their responsibilities include but aren’t limited to designing and developing efficient and functional databases, updating and managing existing databases and identifying and addressing database issues as they arise.\n\nData analyst\n\nAccessing, analyzing and cleaning data are the primary responsibilities of a data analyst. These individuals help businesses and other organizations identify patterns and designs within massive datasets. Data analysts must be proficient in programming, statistics and — of course — SQL.\n\nData scientist\n\nWhile data scientists’ job descriptions overlap somewhat with data analysts, the two professions are distinct. Data scientists have a more comprehensive understanding of data analysis, programming and statistics than analysts; these professionals are responsible for teasing strategically valuable insights and conclusions out of data patterns.\n\nQuality assurance (QA) tester\n\nQuality assurance testers are responsible for identifying and addressing coding flaws before a software product goes to market and further ensure that all operations meet established standards and guidelines. Quality assurance testers also prevent, solve and mitigate issues such as website crashes, software viruses and unexpected errors. These professionals often collaborate with developers to promote website or program functionality.\n\nIntro to SQL — How to Learn SQL From Scratch\n\nUnderstanding SQL can give you an invaluable edge as a tech professional. Even if you lack experience with web or software development, you can begin learning SQL on your own and start working toward a mastery of the language. If you plan to work with databases in any capacity or want to expand your professional horizons, learning SQL can be immensely productive, if not essential.\n\nBelow, we’ve included a breakdown of what you need to know before and while you learn SQL.\n\nWhat you need to know before you begin\n\nBefore you start learning SQL, there are a few points you should know about the language, its capabilities and its limitations.\n\nPractical applications of SQL\n\nSpecific SQL applications may vary across roles and industries, but in general, the query language is used to manage databases. Data scientists and data analysts commonly use SQL to upload, query and otherwise organize data into tables. Data engineers may use SQL to assign permissions to data across company members. Most websites use databases to store user data, and many developers use SQL to interact with the information they collect.\n\nDon’t stop learning once you master SQL\n\nSQL is one of the most popular programming languages in use today. However, as we mentioned earlier, it is not the only one used to manage databases. Given the growing need for scalable, non-relational databases, aspiring coders and data professionals may want to complement their SQL knowledge by learning one or more NoSQL query languages.\n\nStart with the fundamentals\n\nWould you give someone learning to read an Old English collection of Shakespeare’s plays? The answer is obvious — because when we start learning, we begin with the fundamentals.\n\nThe same holds true with SQL. By focusing on the fundamentals, you can more easily tailor your education and prepare yourself for more complex database work down the road.\n\nWondering what that looks like in practice? Generally, SQL newcomers should focus on learning how to use database servers — programs that facilitate database management — as well as the standard commands used when navigating databases. Other basic concepts include SQL syntax, queries, modifiers and calculations.\n\nLet’s take a closer look via a few brief SQL tutorials.\n\nSyntax\n\nSyntax refers to the rules that define symbol combinations within a language. For SQL, the syntax varies slightly between single- and multiple-table databases. You will need to understand the syntax for clauses and operations, such as the ones we’ve listed below. Keep in mind that syntax can vary depending on the database, the number of tables and whether or not the tables are partitioned!\n\nUPDATE\n\nYou can use this clause to name tables and adjust columns to accommodate the inclusion of new values. In multiple-table databases, the UPDATE clause will update all rows that meet defined conditions once, even if the conditions are met multiple times in a single row.\n\nSET\n\nCoders can use the SET clause to identify the columns they want to update as well as the values they wish to input.\n\nDEFAULT\n\nApplying the DEFAULT clause allows users to reset columns to their initial values.\n\nWHERE\n\nThe WHERE clause is used to indicate which rows a user wants to update; failing to use this clause will result in every row being updated.\n\nORDER BY\n\nCoders can use the ORDER BY clause to define the order in which they want to view rows of data. This clause cannot be used with multiple tables.\n\nLIMIT\n\nUsing the LIMIT clause will allow coders to limit the number of rows that are updated via a given command. This clause cannot be used with multiple tables.\n\nThese are just a few entry-level examples of the clauses and syntax you’ll need to learn before achieving mastery over SQL.\n\nManipulating Data\n\nIn addition to retrieving and analyzing data, SQL allows users to manipulate the information within a database. Generally, manipulating data refers to inserting, updating or deleting data. You can use SQL to adjust the information present in a database to be more accurate and up-to-date. The commands to do so are relatively simple (“UPDATE” and “DELETE” illustrate this) which makes the process of changing existing data relatively easy and straightforward.\n\nWriting Queries\n\nQueries are crucial because they empower coders to access, manipulate or organize data within a database. “Query” and “command,” in this regard, are often interchangeable. When writing SQL queries, you need to make sure you use the proper formatting and language to guarantee accurate results. For example, if you want to create a new table in a database, you would format it as such:\n\nAs you work to master SQL, you will become familiar with the specifications required of query writing. Mastery will naturally come with study and practice!\n\nAggregate Functions\n\nWith aggregate functions, coders can gather data from multiple sources and summarize it for data analysis. Below, we’ve included a few primary SQL functions that users can utilize when aggregating data.\n\nSQL COUNT\n\nUsing COUNT will count how many lines of data are contained within a table.\n\nSQL SUM\n\nThis function will provide coders with the sum of all data in a column of their choosing.\n\nSQL AVG\n\nCoders can use SELECT AVG to calculate the average value of data in a specified column.\n\nSQL MAX\n\nThis is a simple command used to find the maximum value available in a given dataset.\n\nSQL MIN\n\nLike MAX, MIN is a simple command that helps users identify the minimum value present in a given dataset.\n\nAll of these functions, except for SQL COUNT, ignore NULL values.\n\nConnecting Tables\n\nSQL users can apply JOINS to combine data from two or more tables by identifying their shared values. There are five major types of joins, all of which are listed below.\n\nINNER JOIN\n\nThis type of join returns rows when it identifies matches in both tables.\n\nLEFT JOIN\n\nThis returns all rows from the left table regardless of whether there are matches in the right.\n\nRIGHT JOIN\n\nThe RIGHT JOIN is the inverse of the left; it returns all rows from the right table regardless of whether there are matches in the left.\n\nFULL JOIN\n\nA FULL JOIN returns rows if it identifies a match in one of the tables.\n\nSELF JOIN\n\nA SELF JOIN considers a single table as if it were two, joining it to itself.\n\nWhat Else Should I Learn to Complement My SQL Skills?\n\nLearning SQL will be only part of your development and education, as the roles that demand SQL proficiency will also require other coding proficiencies. Below, we’ve listed a few core skills that should serve as the foundation for your programming toolbox.\n\nPython\n\nPython is an intuitive, open-source scripting language used in creating web applications and content. As an open-source language, Python is free to use and highly accessible; it was also designed to be compatible with various systems, including Mac, Windows, Unix and Java virtual machines.\n\nJavaScript\n\nAs of 2020, JavaScript was the most sought-after programming language by hiring managers. It’s frequently used in front end web development to create dynamic, responsive elements such as buttons, forms and basic animations.\n\nNode.js\n\nNode.js is an open-source runtime environment — an infrastructure that facilitates program or application execution in real-time — that allows programmers to use JavaScript in back end (server-side) programming. Node.js empowers developers to write fully-functional, server-side applications with access to a computer’s operating and file systems.\n\nHTML\n\nHypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a must-know for those interested in front end web development. Coders use HTML to define the structure and design of each web page within an overall site.\n\nCSS\n\nCascading Sheet Styles, or CSS, are used in tandem with HTML to format the layout and appearance of web pages. Developers can use CSS to uniformly define the font, color scheme, table size and other design elements across a website.\n\nDjango\n\nDjango, like Node.js, is a free, open-source framework designed to support and accelerate programming projects in a single language — in Django’s case, Python. Django helps web developers create secure websites quickly; the framework was designed to encourage the use of reusable code and limit unnecessary duplication.\n\nBootstrap\n\nBootstrap is a front end framework and design toolkit developed to help coders build web pages and applications quickly. It hosts a variety of HTML, CSS and JavaScript tools that can support a coder’s efforts and minimize the time they need to spend building elements from scratch.\n\nWeb Development\n\nIf you want to break into the tech sector but aren’t quite sure what you want to do, you should consider learning full stack web development. Full stack developers are versatile, flexible professionals who have command over the server-side databases and logic that give websites their functionality as well as front end design. Their diverse skill sets provide them with a stepping stone to nearly every tech-savvy career you could name, from data analysis to information security.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning SQL — or any fundamental coding or data science skills — you may want to consider enrolling in Berkeley Coding Boot Camp or Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp. These intensive programs can give you the fundamental skills and practical experience you need to land an entry-level job in the tech field of your choice.
