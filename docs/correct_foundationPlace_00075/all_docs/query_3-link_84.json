But it’s a decidedly odd way of helping; for the rest of the month of May, all fees from text messages made in and out of Sichuan on Sybase’s network will be routed to charitable organizations. Got that? So earthquake victims get some relief, but Sybase also gets to expand its brand by reminding people it’s a big player in China’s text messaging market. A little weird, a little ruthless, but whatever. Money’s money."
