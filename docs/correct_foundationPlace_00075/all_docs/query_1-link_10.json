Raj is a senior manager within the engineering and product management organization at Sybase (SAP), and currently leads product management responsibilities for SAP Sybase ASE.\n\nProduct updates for SAP Sybase ASE have been fast and furious over the last few years, and particularly more so after SAP acquired Sybase. Product development was fast tracked to support SAP Business Suite which now runs on ASE 15.7. ASE is the database of choice for SAP applications. in this session, Raj will briefly review capabilities of ASE 15.7, and then provide updates on the latest product enhancements in ASE 15.7 ESD #2. He will also look at upcoming capabilities being targeted for early 2013.\n\nThere will be a general question-and-answer session after the main presentation.\n\nRegister now for your local meeting:\n\nAug 28: Houston, TX\n\nAug 29: Minneapolis, MN\n\nAug 30: Milwaukee, WI\n\nThe Houston meeting will be followed by a networking reception, and lunch will be provided in Minneapolis and Milwaukee to all who register for the meetings in those cities.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you later this month!"
