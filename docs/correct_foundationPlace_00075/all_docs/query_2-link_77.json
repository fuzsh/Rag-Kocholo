Contributions towards updating the information below can be submitted to the Torque Dev mailing list.\n\nSybase Howto\n\nThis text is a description of integration of Sybase ASE as the target database in a TDK generated application.\n\nJDBC Driver Information\n\nSybase has a pure java jdbc driver, jConnect, that is free to use, but not open source. You may download this driver from Sybase.\n\nIntegration Steps\n\nGenerate your application with the TDK as normal.\n\nEdit the project properties as instructed by the TDK.\n\nBefore you run 'build.sh init' you will need to create the database. Automatic database creation for Sybase does not currently work, so the database must be created first.\n\nPlace the jConnect jar file in your WEB-INF/lib directory.\n\nRun 'build.sh init' to generate and initialize the project."
