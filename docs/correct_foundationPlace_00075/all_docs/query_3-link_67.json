This package included a query language called \"PostQUEL\".\n\nIn 1994, Postgres95 was built on top of POSTGRES code, adding an SQL language interpreter as a replacement for PostQUEL. Eventually, Postgres95 was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect the SQL query capability.\n\nAfter this, many people referred to it as Postgres since it's less prone to confusion. Supabase is all about simplicity, so we also refer to it as Postgres.\n\nTips#\n\nRead about resetting your database password here and changing the timezone of your server here.\n\nNext steps#\n\nRead more about Postgres\n\nSign in: supabase.com/dashboard"
