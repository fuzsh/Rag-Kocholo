        "text": "As a Certified Migration Consultant and a SAP Partner, we decided to work on Sybase ASE to get experience on SAP's new database.\n\nSAP released Sybase ASE Kernel for specific SAP versions. Supported SAP solutions are:\n\nSAP ERP 6.0 incl. EHP5 based on SAP NetWeaver 7.0 EhP2\n\nSAP CRM 7.0 incl. EHP1 based on SAP NetWeaver 7.0 EhP2\n\nSAP SRM 7.0 incl. EHP1 based on SAP NetWeaver 7.0 EhP2\n\nSAP SCM 7.0 incl. EHP1 based on SAP NetWeaver 7.0 EhP2\n\nSAP NW 7.0 incl. EHP2\n\nSAP Solution Manager 7.1 SR1\n\nYou also need the specific Kernel, Installation Master and Sybase ASE RDBMS DVD's for Installation and Migration to Aybase ASE Database.\n\nOur Accounting System is running on Windows 2008 R2/SQL Server 2008 R2 with version ERP 6.0 EHP5 SP10 and 54 GB Database size. We decided to do a migration to Windows 2008R2/Sybase ASE 15.7 and here I'll share my first experience with Sybase ASE.\n\nPlanning\n\nFirst of all, we needed to check the compatibility of our source system with the target and find out that all conditions are met.\n\nSource Platform\n\nIs it ok for ASE Migration?\n\nSAP Solution and ReleaseSAP ERP 6.0 EHP5YesSAP Basis Release and SP LevelBASIS 7.02 SP 10YesOperating SystemWindows 2008 R2 SP1 x64 SEYesDatabaseSQL Server 2008 R2 x64 SEYesDatabase Size54 GB-\n\nPreparations\n\nDownloading ASE related DVDs mentioned in Note 1591424.\n\n51041592 SAP Business Suite 2010 Installation Master Sybase GA\n\n51041595 SAP Kernel 7.20_EXT for BS7i2010 Sybase GA\n\n51041596 Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise 15.7 RDBMS GA\n\nDownload the ASE, SAP Kernel and ASE ODBC Client Updates to meet the minimum version requirements mentioned in note 1591424. They'll be installed during migration.\n\nSource System Export\n\nWe started the source system export with source system's Installation Master DVD (in our case it is 51041254 BS7i2010 Installation Master Windows Server on x64 64bit)\n\nIt is normal export process, nothing new\n\nTarget System Installation with Export Data\n\nWe started the Import on target system with Installation Master for Sybase ASE and suprise :razz:\n\nThere is no option for migration / system copy under ERP 6.0 EHP5 Tree. You can only use the NetWeaver 7.0 EHP2 Migration options (which are same in fact)\n\nAs usual, for ASE SAPINST asks for datafile placement\n\nAnd asks master password for Database users (sapsa, sapsso, SAPSR3)\n\nAnd also the migration key. But the standart migration key given in Note 1339717 - Hom./Het.System Copy SAP NW 7.0 incl. EHP 2 doesn't work.\n\nYou've to apply for Migration key via http://service.sap.com/migrationkey\n\nThe rest is almost same as other migrations.\n\nDuring installation, Sybase ASE is automatically installed by SAPINST like DB2 (Oracle and SQL Server must be installed seperately and manually :cool: )\n\nAnd 2 OS services installed (for Windows of course). These services can be used to restart ASE DB.\n\nBefore Import, you've to update the SAP Kernel, R3load, Sybase ASE RDBMS and ASE ODBC libraries. For this you've to stop the SAPINST before ABAP Import. In my previous blog TIP: How to stop OS/DB Migration before Import Phase? I mentioned a way and community added the others.\n\nFor updating, you've to follow instructions given in SAP Notes + plus some tips from Sybase Community. I'll write a second Blog on ASE Administration Tips.\n\nResult\n\nAfter migration, database size growth was suprised me. Here is the result:\n\nSource Platform\n\nTarget PlatformSAP Solution and ReleaseSAP ERP 6.0 EHP5SAP ERP 6.0 EHP5SAP Basis Release and SP LevelBASIS 7.02 SP 10BASIS 7.02 SP10Operating SystemWindows 2008 R2 SP1 x64 SEWindows 2008 R2 SP1 x64 SEDatabaseSQL Server 2008 R2 x64 SESybase ASE 15.7Database Size54 GB105 GB\n\nWe're still discussing the reasons for DB size growth on the discussion Maximum DB size for SAP on ASE?\n\nBut here are the brief lessons learned during migration;"
