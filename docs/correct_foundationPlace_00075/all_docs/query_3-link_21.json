SDT consists of three main parts: (1) The first part maps EER schemas into abstract relational schemas, (2) the second part maps abstract relational schemas into schema definitions for RDBMSs; and (3) the third part generates the metadata regarding EER schemas, relational schemas, and their mappings. SDT 4.1 targets SYNBASE 4.0, INGRES 6.3, and INFORMIX 4.0. Compared with SDT 3.1, SDT 4.1 has the following additional features: (1) a graphical editor for specifying and modifying EER schemas, called ERDRAW; (2) SDT 4.1 generates procedures for verifying the consistency of an existing database with regard to a set of referential integrity constraints associated with that database; (3) attributes and object-sets (entity-sets or relationship-sets) can be described using new description fields; (4) SDT 4.1 allows the specification of hierarchically organized subject terms for object-sets, attributes, and the association of subject terms with object-sets and attributes; and, (5) SDT 4.1 generates metadata describing EER schemas, relational schemas and their mappings. SDT was implemented using C, LEX, and YACC on Sun 3 and Sun 4 workstations under Sun Unix OS 4.0.3. and Sun Unix OS 4.1. 9 refs., 8 figs.},\n\ndoi = {10.2172/5241462},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5241462}, journal = {},\n\nnumber = ,\n\nvolume = ,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Wed May 01 00:00:00 EDT 1991},\n\nmonth = {Wed May 01 00:00:00 EDT 1991}\n\n}"
