        "text": "Introduction\n\nsqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.\n\nFeatures\n\nFull support for MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, IBM DB2, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase, SAP MaxDB, Informix, MariaDB, MemSQL, TiDB, CockroachDB, HSQLDB, H2, MonetDB, Apache Derby, Amazon Redshift, Vertica, Mckoi, Presto, Altibase, MimerSQL, CrateDB, Greenplum, Drizzle, Apache Ignite, Cubrid, InterSystems Cache, IRIS, eXtremeDB, FrontBase, Raima Database Manager, YugabyteDB, Aurora, OpenGauss, ClickHouse and Virtuoso database management systems.\n\nFull support for six SQL injection techniques: boolean-based blind, time-based blind, error-based, UNION query-based, stacked queries and out-of-band.\n\nSupport to directly connect to the database without passing via a SQL injection, by providing DBMS credentials, IP address, port and database name.\n\nSupport to enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, roles, databases, tables and columns.\n\nAutomatic recognition of password hash formats and support for cracking them using a dictionary-based attack.\n\nSupport to dump database tables entirely, a range of entries or specific columns as per user's choice. The user can also choose to dump only a range of characters from each column's entry.\n\nSupport to search for specific database names, specific tables across all databases or specific columns across all databases' tables. This is useful, for instance, to identify tables containing custom application credentials where relevant columns' names contain string like name and pass.\n\nSupport to download and upload any file from the database server underlying file system when the database software is MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nSupport to execute arbitrary commands and retrieve their standard output on the database server underlying operating system when the database software is MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nSupport to establish an out-of-band stateful TCP connection between the attacker machine and the database server underlying operating system. This channel can be an interactive command prompt, a Meterpreter session or a graphical user interface (VNC) session as per user's choice.\n\nSupport for database process' user privilege escalation via Metasploit's Meterpreter getsystem command.\n\nRefer to the wiki for an exhaustive breakdown of the features.\n\nDownload\n\nYou can download the latest zipball or tarball.\n\nPreferably, you can download sqlmap by cloning the Git repository:\n\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git sqlmap-dev\n\nDocumentation\n\nsqlmap User's manual.\n\nsqlmap History.\n\nsqlmap Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\n\nMaterial around sqlmap presented at conferences.\n\nDemo\n\nWatch more demos here.\n\nContribute\n\nAll code contributions are greatly appreciated. First off, clone the Git repository, read the user's manual carefully, go through the code yourself and drop us an email if you are having a hard time grasping its structure and meaning.\n\nBug reports are welcome! Please report all bugs on the issue tracker. Our preferred method of patch submission is via a Git pull request.\n\nEach patch should make one logical change. Please follow the existing stylistic conventions: wrap code to 76 columns when possible. Avoid tabs, use four space characters instead. Before you put time into a non-trivial patch, it is worth discussing it privately by email.\n\nMany people have contributed in different ways to the sqlmap development. You can be the next!\n\nDonate\n\nsqlmap is the result of numerous hours of passionated work from a small team of computer security enthusiasts. If you appreciated our work and you want to see sqlmap kept being developed, please consider making a donation or sponsor our efforts via Sponsor page or via PayPal.\n\nWe also accept Ƀitcoins to 1AUrrKYsamBEThdruYTQmUfMfLF7aaxU6x.\n\nLicense\n\nCopyright © 2006-2024 by Bernardo Damele Assumpcao Guimaraes and Miroslav Stampar.
