Those involved with Ingres talk about its beginning as the Berkeley Ingres Project under UNIX on PDP-11s. Larry Rowe then discusses how Relational Technology (later changed to Ingres) started as a company to market Ingres as a commercial product and port it to other platforms. The founders of Sybase then talk about how they founded the company and their relationship with Microsoft for what became Microsoft SQL Server. They discuss how the companies developed and the significance of the benchmark tests in validating the products. Finally, they talk about how Ingres was sold to ASK and how Sybase grew after it became a public company.\n\nDate\n\n2007-06-13\n\nContributor\n\nAnces, Carol Anne, Editor Batti, Greg, Participant Bohl, Marilyn, Participant Butterworth, Paul, Participant Held, Jerry, Participant Hoffman, Mark, Participant Jerger, Douglas, Moderator Johnson, Luanne, Participant Mahoney, Michael, Historian Rowe, Lawrence (Larry), Participant Schachter, Oscar H., Editor Schuster, Stu, Participant Sippl, Roger, Participant Weiss, Steve, Participant\n\nPublisher\n\nComputer History Museum\n\nPlace of Publication\n\nMountain View, CA, USA\n\nExtent\n\n40 p.\n\nCategory\n\nTranscription\n\nSubject\n\nJerger, Doug; Batti, Greg; Bohl, Marilyn; Butterworth, Paul; Held, Jerry; Hoffman, Mark; Rowe, Larry; Schuster, Stu; Sippl, Roger; Weiss, Steve; Johnson, Luanne; Mahoney, Michael; ASK; Britton Lee, Inc.; Codd, Ted; Date, C.J.
