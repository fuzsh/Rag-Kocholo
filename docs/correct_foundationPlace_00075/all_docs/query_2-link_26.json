        "text": "Product licensing\n\nProduct licensing\n\nFoglight includes a licensing capability that restricts access to those features that are defined in the license. Any Management Server installation requires a license that grants access to server-specific parts of the browser interface and the features associated with them. Foglight cartridges are also license-protected. While some cartridges are covered by the base Foglight license (such as Foglight Agent Manager cartridges and the Foglight for Infrastructure), others may require an additional license.\n\nFoglight for Sybase is covered by the base Foglight license that allows cartridges to be installed.\n\nTo activate a trial or a purchased commercial license:\n\nOn the navigation panel, under Dashboards, click Administration > Setup > Manage Licenses.\n\nClick Install.\n\nIn the Install License dialog box, click Browse.\n\nIn the file browser that appears, specify the location of the license file.\n\nIn the Install License dialog box, click Install License.\n\nBack to Top\n\nGetting started with Foglight for Sybase\n\nGetting started with Foglight for Sybase\n\nThe Foglight Cartridge for Sybase release package contains the following:\n\nFoglight Cartridge for Sybase 5.7.5.50\n\nDB_Sybase-5_7_5_50.car\n\nProduct Documentation, including:\n\nFoglight for Sybase 5.7.5.50 User and Reference Guide (PDF and online help)\n\nFoglight for Sybase 5.7.5.50 Release Notes (this document)\n\nInstallation Instructions\n\nVerify that your system meets the minimum hardware and software requirements before attempting to install and run the Foglight Cartridge for Sybase 5.7.5.50. Refer to Installation and Compatibility for information regarding installing the new Cartridge for Sybase.\n\nNote: Before beginning the installation process, you must install, or have already installed, Foglight 5.7.5.\n\nThe installation process is common for all Foglight cartridges, and is described in the Foglight Administration and Configuration Help.\n\nAfter installing the Cartridge for Sybase, perform the configuration steps below:\n\nAfter you install the Sybase cartridge for the first time, go to Components for Download (in Cartridges menu) and download the DB_Sybase_firstRun_scripts. Extract the zip file.\n\nRun script rapsAdmin.sql as \"sa\" user. This script creates only two helper stored procedures: sp_fgl_addgrant and sp_fgl_adduser.\n\nisql -Usa -Ppassword -SserverName -i rapsAdmin.sql -o rapsAdmin.out\n\nSend the setup_mon_tables.sql file to your Sybase DBA for review and configuration of relevant Sybase MDA parameters.\n\nTo create a new Sybase user:\n\nRun the following scripts as sa user (use your username and password. Note: The new user has to have only one role: mon_role. Grant mon_role to 'username'\n\nexec sp_addlogin 'username' , 'password' , sybsystemprocs\n\nexec sp_fgl_adduser 'username' , 'foglightGroup'\n\nViewing the Cartridge for Sybase:\n\nOn the navigation panel, under Dashboards, click Administration > Cartridges > Cartridge Inventory. For details specific to the installation of the cartridge agents, see the following sections.\n\nSybase Adaptive Server Prerequisites: Sybase_MDA Agent\n\nInstall Sybase_MDA\n\nThe first pre-requisite is that the Sybase_MDA feature be installed on the respective ASE. This feature is not automatically installed on all versions of Sybase ASE. A check the DBA can run is the query: “select * from master..monState”.\n\nIf the monitoring tables are not installed in your Adaptive Server (12.5.1 or later), have the Sybase DBA for the respective ASE follow the steps to install the tables listed in the Addendum at the end of this section.\n\nFor versions 15.x, there is no need for loopback and installmontables.\n\nConfigure Sybase_MDA\n\nThe Sybase_MDA feature has numerous parameters to both turn on and turn off specific metrics and determine the amount of memory the ASE will set aside for these metrics.\n\nPerformance monitoring how has the ability to enable the user to set the per_object_statistics flag to off.\n\nConfigure ports\n\nCallback collections require communication between the Foglight Management Server and the Sybase server. Ensure that the port used by the Sybase host server is open between the Sybase host and the Foglight Management Server.\n\nSybase 'mon_role' assigned\n\nThe Sybase login defined in the Foglight agent property for the respective agent must have the “mon_role” assigned. This is also applicable to the ‘sa’ login.\n\nCommand to execute via ISQL or other client tool:\n\ngrant role mon_roleto_<logon_name>\n\nSybase Adaptive Server Pre-requisites: Sybase_RS Agent\n\nThe Sybase_RS agent requires separate common logins to be created for the Replication Server, the RSSD data server, the Primary data server, and the Replicate data server.\n\nReplication Server - Create a user with no special permission for each Replication Server being monitored.\n\nRSSD data server - Create a login for RSSD data server. Create a user with the same login name for the RSSD database. This user should be a member of the rs_systabgroup.\n\nPrimary data server - Create a login with the replication_role in each Primary data server. Create a user with the same login name for the Primary database.\n\nReplicate data server - Create a login in each Replicate data server. Create a user with the same login name for the Replicate database. This user should have select permission for the rs_lastcommit table.\n\nNote: Refer to the Sybase_RS \"Setting Connection Details\" topic in the Managing Sybase Database Systems online help for more information.\n\nAddendum\n\nPreparation of the ASE version 12.5.1 or later for Foglight Cartridge for Sybase 5.7.5.50\n\nInstall MDA\n\nIf the monitoring tables are not installed in your Adaptive Server (12.5.1 or subsequent release), have the Sybase DBA for the respective ASE follow these steps to install the tables.\n\nFirst, a server named “loopback” must be included in sysservers before installing the scripts for the MDA tables. Proxy tables for the monitoring tables are not created by default when you configure Adaptive Server. The tables are created in the second step using the installmontables script that is included in the Adaptive Server install (located in the $SYBASE/ASE-12_5/scripts directory).\n\nCreate a loopback server entry in ISQL:\n\nLogon to Ada.\n\nExecute:\n\nsp_addserver 'loopback', null, <ASE server name> go\n\nExecute the installmontables script located in the $SYBASE/ASE-12_5/scripts directory (%SYBASE%/ASE-12_5/scripts for Windows) using ISQL:\n\nisql –Usa –P<sa password> -S<server name> -n –i%SYBASE%/%SYBASE_ASE%/scripts/installmontables\n\nAdaptive Server Enterprise configuration parameters\n\nSybase_MDA agent requires the following configuration for it to run correctly and gather the specified data for the Foglight Management Server.\n\nThe values shown for the following parameters are the minimum required values that the Foglight Cartridge for Sybase 5.7.5.50 needs for proper data collection and reporting. Any of these parameter values could be increased if necessary. (You can copy, paste, and execute the following script into an ISQL or other client session.)\n\nsp_configure \"statement cache size\" <size_of_cache> go sp_configure \"errorlog pipe max messages\",1000 go sp_configure \"max SQL text monitored\",256 go sp_configure \"sql text pipe max messages\",3000 go sp_configure \"statement pipe max messages\",3000 go -- Flags sp_configure \"enable stmt cache monitoring\" , 1 go sp_configure \"enable literal autoparam\" [0|1] go sp_configure \"enable monitoring\", 1 go sp_configure \"sql text pipe active\", 1 go sp_configure \"errorlog pipe active\", 1 go sp_configure \"per object statistics active\",1 go sp_configure \"statement statistics active\",1 go sp_configure \"statement pipe active\",1 go sp_configure \"wait event timing\",1 go sp_configure \"SQL batch capture\",1 go sp_configure \"process wait events\",1 go\n\nThe following tables list proprietary Sybase flags and the Sybase_MDA agent tables dependent upon them. If any of the settings do not have values that fall in the recommended value range, data collection will issue complaints and fail to successfully collect; indicating that some MDA table collection was canceled as a result of the flags being set incorrectly. To prevent these alerts from occurring, use the appropriate Data Management properties to disable the collection that is failing to collect. Below is a listing of Sybase_MDA agent tables and the configuration settings they depend on:\n\nAdditional resources\n\nAdditional information is available from the following:\n\nOnline product documentation (http://documents.quest.com/ProductsAZ.aspx#F)\n\nFoglight Community https://www.quest.com/community/products/foglight/\n\nGlobalization\n\nThis section contains information about installing and operating this product in non-English configurations, such as those needed by customers outside of North America.
