The objective of this project would be to learn tools and techniques for data analytics through a group project with essential contributions as an individual. Capstone projects also may take investigative aspects that culminate in a final product (report, short film, or multimedia presentation). Students may be asked to select a topic or social problem that interests them, conduct a study on it, and create a final product demonstrating their learning acquisition. Students may be asked to give an oral presentation on the project to a panel of experts collectively to evaluate the project's quality. Students may be given time for three months, after finishing the other courses of second semester, to submit the final project product.\n\nFaculty:\n\nLearning Resources:\n\nS.\n\nElective II\n\nBO CDA 3xx Elective II 3-0-x-x 3\n\nCourse Description:\n\nAn indicative list of electives:\n\nImage and Video Analytics\n\nBig Data Security\n\nIntroduction to Deep Learning\n\nAfter getting necessary approvals from the IIT Patna Senate, the list of electives may be extended to match the industry demand from time-to-time.\n\nFaculty:\n\nLearning Resources:\n\nS\n\nElective III\n\nBO CDA 3xx Elective III 3-0-x-x 3\n\nCourse Description:\n\nAn indicative list of electives:\n\nData Mining\n\nCloud Computing\n\nHigh Performance Computing\n\nAfter getting necessary approvals from the IIT Patna Senate, the list of electives may be extended to match the industry demand from time-to-time.\n\nFaculty:\n\nLearning Resources:\n\nD."
