        "text": "THE EUVE SATELLITE SURVEY DATABASE N. Craig, T. Chen, I. Hawkins, and A. Fruscione Center for EUV Astrophysics, 2150 Kittredge, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA ABSTRACT The EUVE survey database contains fundamental science data for 9000 po- tential source locations (pigeonholes) in the sky. The first release of the Bright Source List is now available to the public through an interface with the Astrophysical Data System of NASA. We describe the database schema design and the EUVE source categorization algorithm that compares sources to the ROSAT Wide Field Camera source list. INTRODUCTION The Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer Survey Database (EUVECATDB) was designed and implemented to store and maintain all fundamental science data of sources from the EUVE all-sky survey. The survey phase, which lasted six months, was completed January 21, 1993. Information on the source position and flux in each filter are calculated with the End-to-End System (EES) software [1]. These data are then stored in EUVECATDB, which is updated as new survey data become available and reprocessed. Currently, EUVECATDB contains about 9000 source locations. The database is implemented as a combination of a Sybase Transact Sequential Query Language script and Unix shell scripts; procedures and triggers internal to Sybase are applied to ensure data integrity at all times. The six major tables and their relationship within the database are shown in fig. 1. Some of the database's built-in algorithms were designed to carry out computations automatically and also to categorize all entries based on a comparison with sources detected by ROSAT's Wide Field Camera (WFC). EUVECATDB will be in- stalled in NASA's Astrophysics Data System (ADS) so that it is available to the scientific community (after the data proprietary periods end) via a variety of methods, including an X-window user interface. Currently the data from the EUVE Bright Source List, a sample of the 356 brightest EUVE sources [2], are installed in ADS and are accessible only by staff at the Center for EUV Astrophysics. 2. DATABASE SCHEMA DESIGN The EUVECATDB consists of six tables (fig. 1). The pig table (pigeonhole [3]), the backbone of the whole database, holds astronomical data for the ex- pected targets, such as spectral class, pixel address, RA and DEC. Each data row in this table corresponds to a pigeonhole (target) entry. A unique integer defined as pid, pigeonhole id, is assigned to each pigeonhole and uniquely identifies the pigeonholes in all tables. Each data row in the fil (filter) table contains the observed data from a detector's specific filter when the detector was pointing to a pigeonhole. Because EUVE has detectors for three scanning telescopes, with each detector having multiple filters, each pigeonhole entry in the pig table has between two and ten corresponding data rows in the fil table. Each data row in the fil table is uniquely identified by the combination of a pid and filter number. Each data row in the wfc table corresponds to a source detected by the ROSAT mission and is uniquely identified by the attribute wfc_name. Each data row in the pig_wfc table consists of a pigeonhole id and a WFC source name that over- lap. Error circle radii within 90% confidence level, r90, are calculated both for EUVE and WFC sources. When the distance between EUVE and WFC source is less than the sum of the two r90 values, these two sources are considered overlap- ping. EUVECATDB uses the data in the wfc and pig_wfc tables to carry out the EUVE source categorizing algorithm. For each pigeonhole entry in the pig table, there is at least one corres- ponding entry in the cat (catalog) table which stores a source name from a different catalog. Lastly, the candi (optical candidates) table holds the data of potential optical counterparts. For each pigeonhole there may be more than one candidate entry that is considered a potential counterpart of the EUVE source. Each data row in the candi table is uniquely identified by the combination of pid and cand_id. The following is an example of querying the database in the Sybase ISQL environment.

CATEGORIZING PIGEONHOLES WITH RESPECT TO WRC SOURCES The Sybase procedure detect was implemented within EUVECATDB to automati- cally carry out the categorization of EUVE sources by comparing them to WFC sources. This procedure, when executed, assigns an integer number to each pigeonhole entry in the pig table to indicate the category to which the pigeon- hole belongs. There are five categories for the EUVE sources in comparison to the WFC sources: (1) A new source: the pigeonhole has a \"detection\" in one of the EUVE band- passes and does not overlap with any of the WFC sources. (2) WFC yes, EUVE more: the pigeonhole has a \"detection\" in the Lexan band- pass (which corresponds to S1 from WFC) in addition to at least one other EUVE bandpass, and it overlaps a WFC source. (3) Common: the pigeonhole has a \"detection\" in the EUVE Lexan bandpass only, and overlaps with a WFC source. (4) WFC yes, EUVE no: the pigeonhole does not have a \"detection\" in any of the EUVE bandpasses but overlaps with a WFC source. (5) We see differently: the pigeonhole has a \"detection\" in any EUVE bandpass other than Lexan but the source was detected in the WFC S1 bandpass. Fig. 2 shows graphically the categorization algorithm for comparing EUVE with WFC sources. The procedure detect finds a \"detection\" in a filter when the attribute de- tection_quality from the fil table is greater than a predefined threshold value. This threshold value is given as a parameter to the stored procedure when it is invoked. The detections in each filter are also visually verified and the results are entered into the database to verify the results from detect. 4. SUMMARY EUVECATDB has a general purpose schema design and can be used for multiple purpose queries. With the ADS interface, both QBE (Query By Example) and SQL queries can be used. While the survey data will remain the property of Berkeley for a period of one year following survey gap-filling and will not be available to the public, the Bright Source List that became public in June 1993 will be accessed through the EUVE Archive [4].
