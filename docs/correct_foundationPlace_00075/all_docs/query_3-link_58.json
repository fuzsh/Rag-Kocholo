        "text": "The Berkeley campus is the oldest of the nine institutions that make up the University of California system. For the 1999-2000 fiscal year, the budget of the Berkeley campus, including all fund sources, was just over $1 billion. There are about 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students, 10,000 faculty and staff employees and about 13,000 student employees. IT is decentralized across the campuses. Aside from the payroll system, which is developed and maintained by the UC Office of the President (the systemwide office), each campus is responsible for operating its own applications and data centers.\n\nTo appreciate the condition of the financial systems at the Berkeley campus, we only had to look at its 30-plus year old general ledger. For years, the record length was restricted to 80 characters, and had never been expanded beyond 85. The year indicator was one-digit, which means that it was Y2K compliant, but we had a \"decade problem.\" The budget system was over 20 years old, and its functions could no longer cope with the demands and dynamics of today’s planning requirements. There was (still is) no human resources system. Compounding these deficiencies, in the late ’80s and early ’90s, the country and the state’s recession resulted in the California Legislature cutting the universitywide budget severely, to a point that staff salaries were rolled back. The IT budget also fell victim to the multiple-year reductions.\n\nLater, as the economy improved, and with the inevitable approach of the year 2000, the Berkeley campus began to look to revamping its entire financial system in order to meet the challenges of the new millennium. In 1995, a task force reviewed the campus’ financial needs. It requested public bids for a financial system that could improve end user access and processing, and minimize the number of interfaces between systems. At the time, client/server architecture and Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) were the leading technology solution. A number of well-known vendors presented their financial software packages to the task force, including Oracle, SCT, PeopleSoft, and others. Because of PeopleSoft’s unique commitment to the public sector, past experience with student systems, its promise of a Macintosh client support, pricing, and its willingness to partner with the university in development, PeopleSoft was selected. The proximity of its headquarters and development center to the Berkeley campus was also a consideration. The campus decided to deploy account payables, purchasing and general ledger first, followed by human resources. Later, budgeting was added.\n\nWhat makes an ERP implementation so complex is that the applications generally do not fit the organization’s business and technical frameworks. As a consequence, a new technical infrastructure, new business rules and policies, as well as procedures have to be introduced simultaneously.\n\nChallenges\n\nIn late 1995, the campus took delivery of PeopleSoft Financials for Public Sector Release 5.x, and began to experiment with its implementation. Other than a small UNIX/Sybase-based data warehouse, the campus’ administrative applications was overwhelmingly IBM OS/390 based, with many mission-critical applications running under CA-IDMS, while payroll used DB2. The IT staff for administrative computing had little UNIX database experience, nor was the campus UNIX infrastructure robust or adequate enough to support mission-critical applications. The decision to use OS/390/DB2 to support our PeopleSoft implementation came naturally, since the operational knowledge and requisite skills to support a DB2 on the OS/390 were in place, and the underlying technology proven, and solid. In the opinion of IT, these advantages outweighed the relatively weak PeopleSoft support of the OS/390/DB2 platform. To facilitate TCP/IP connectivity between the user workstations and DB2 PeopleSoft recommended Gupta’s (Centura) SQLNetwork.\n\nAt the time, the campus has about 20,000 TCP/IP connections to its network, which has an FDDI backbone. Some of the outlying offices from the main campus relied on T1 or ISDN connections. A number of communication protocols were supported, including IP, IPX and Appletalk. Needless to say, the campus also has a relatively large number of Apple Macintosh computers. There are about 4,000 workstations used for administrative purposes, and the breakdown between PC and Macintosh is about 60-40, respectively. Personal administrative UNIX workstations are not supported. Even with that exclusion, supporting two workstation platforms, with so diverse an architecture has proven to be a big challenge. Attempts to standardize the campus to use one platform over another has only given rise to religious wars.\n\nOne of the difficulties in supporting the performance of a multi-purpose network that is used for research, instruction and administration is the management of the variety of network traffic that flows through it. For example, a user whose workstation is located on the same subnet as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) project will experience a severe degradation in response time often. Economies prohibit the campus from having separate academic and administrative networks.\n\nThe lack of an acceptable way to distribute and synchronize software on client workstations in a campus ERP implementation also presents a major challenge to IT. Where in many private organizations, workstation infrastructure generally is guided by central IT management policies, the responsibility of a workstation setup and support at a university often resides with the staff in the department.\n\nThis means a staff member may maintain his own workstation, except in departments or offices that can afford their own workstation support staff. The campus IT organization recommends hardware and software configurations, but they are not always followed. In short, the manner in which administrative workstations are maintained mirrors the broader concepts of academic freedom.\n\nThe number of administrative computer users on campus is about 2,500, based on the number of active user IDs. Prior to the introduction of PeopleSoft, users accessed their OS/390-based applications using TN3270 clients over the campus TCP/IP network from their PC or Macintosh workstations. The campus staff, in general, were not adequately prepared to work in a Windows or a Mac OS. Entrance to applications were often scripted for the users, so they had little or no knowledge of how an application was initiated. This inadequacy was another issue addressed during our ERP implementation.\n\nAnother system-related deficiency the campus thought it would solve with PeopleSoft’s architecture was sign-on security. At the time, PeopleSoft sign-on communication was not encrypted. So, the user ID and password were transmitted over the network in the clear. Given the security vulnerabilities that are well known in educational settings, this deficiency was clearly unacceptable.\n\nSolution\n\nAfter the first PeopleSoft R 5.x 2-tier test workstations were installed, we discovered that indeed some large queries do spawn a large amount of network traffic that could impact the subnet performance as a whole, if they were executed in large volume. Even if we had 20 percent of the 2,500 users on the application concurrently, we felt we would not be able to sustain the network traffic, and produce an acceptable response time.\n\nWe began to seek an architecture that could resolve most, if not all of these challenges. We knew about Citrix and its capability, but we were initially hesitant to adopt this relatively new technology. Things changed quickly as we watched PeopleSoft’s promise of a Macintosh client fade, while the time to implement PS applications approached. It turned out that Citrix could address many of our technical issues and implementation concerns."
