Entry Period: This Challenge will consist of four weekly Entry Periods as follows (each an “Entry Period”) - 12:00 a.m. PT on June 17, 2024 – 11:59 p.m. PT on June 23, 2024 - 12:00 a.m. PT on June 24, 2024 – 11:59 p.m. PT on June 30, 2024 - 12:00 a.m. PT on July 1, 2024 – 11:59 p.m. PT on July 7, 2024 - 12:00 a.m. PT on July 8, 2024 – 11:59 p.m. PT on July 14, 2024 Entries will be eligible for the Entry Period in which they are received and will not carryover to subsequent weekly entry periods. You must enter into each weekly Entry Period separately. How to Enter: We invite you to participate in a quest to provide \"Accepted Solutions\" to as many questions as you can. Answers can be provided in all the communities. Users must provide a solution which can be an “Accepted Solution” in the Forums in all of the communities and there are no limits to the number of “Accepted Solutions” that a member can provide for entries in this challenge, but each entry must be substantially unique and different. Winner Selection and Prizes: At the end of each week, we will list the top ten (10) Community users which will consist of: 5 Community Members & 5 Super Users and they will advance to the final drawing. We will post each week in the News & Announcements the top 10 Solution providers. At the end of the challenge, we will add all of the top 10 weekly names and enter them into a random drawing. Then we will randomly select ten (10) winners (5 Community Members & 5 Super Users) from among all eligible entrants received across all weekly Entry Periods to receive the prize listed below. If a winner declines, we will draw again at random for the next winner. A user will only be able to win once overall. If they are drawn multiple times, another user will be drawn at random. Individuals will be contacted before the announcement with the opportunity to claim or deny the prize. Once all of the winners have been notified, we will post in the News & Announcements of each community with the list of winners. Each winner will receive one (1) Pass to the Power Platform Conference in Las Vegas, Sep. 18-20, 2024 ($1800 value). NOTE: Prize is for conference attendance only and any other costs such as airfare, lodging, transportation, and food are the sole responsibility of the winner. Tickets are not transferable to any other party or to next year’s event. ** PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED RULES for this CHALLENGE** Week 1 Results: Congratulations to the Week 1 qualifiers, you are being entered in the random drawing that will take place at the end of the challenge.
