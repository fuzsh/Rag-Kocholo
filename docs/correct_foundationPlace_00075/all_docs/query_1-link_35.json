        "text": "SQL Tutorial\n\nOur SQL tutorial helps you learn SQL (Structured Query Language) in simple and easy steps so that you can start your database programming quickly. It covers most of the important concepts related to SQL for a basic to advanced understanding of SQL and to get a feel of how SQL works.\n\nSQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language which is used to manage data stored in relational databases like MySQL, MS Access, SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres etc.\n\nSQL is a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational databases like MySQL, MS Access, SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres etc. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL was developed in the 1970s by IBM Computer Scientists.\n\nSQL is not a database management system, but it is a query language which is used to store and retrieve the data from a database or in simple words SQL is a language that communicates with databases.\n\nSQL Examples\n\nConsider we have following CUSTOMERS table which stores customer's ID, Name, Age, Salary, City and Country −\n\nSQL makes it easy to manipulate this data using simple DML (Data Manipulation Language) Statements. For example, if we want to list down all the customers from USA then following will be the SQL query.\n\nSELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE country = 'USA';\n\nThis will produce the following result:\n\nSQL Online Editor\n\nWe have provided SQL Online Editor which helps you to Edit and Execute the SQL code directly from your browser. Try to click the icon to run the following SQL code to be executed on CUSTOMERS table and print the records matching with the given condition.\n\nSELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE country = 'USA';\n\nSo now, you do not need to do a sophisticated setup to execute all the examples given in this tutorial because we are providing you Online SQL Editor, which allows you to edit your code and compile it online. You can try our Online SQL Editor.\n\nSQL Basic Commands\n\nWe have a list of standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases, These commands are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP and TRUNCATE and can be classified into the following groups based on their nature −\n\nData Definition Language (DDL)\n\nA Data Definition Language (DDL) is a computer language which is used to create and modify the structure of database objects which include tables, views, schemas, and indexes etc.\n\nData Manipulation Language (DML)\n\nA Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a computer programming language which is used for adding, deleting, and modifying data in a database.\n\nData Control Language (DCL)\n\nData Control Language (DCL) is a computer programming language which is used to control access to data stored in a database.\n\nWhy to Learn SQL?\n\nSQL (Structured Query Language) is a MUST for the students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. SQL is the most common language used almost in every application software including banking, finance, education, security etc. to store and manipulate data.\n\nSQL is fairly easy to learn, so if you are starting to learn any programming language then it is very much advised that you should also learn SQL and other Database related concepts to become a complete Software Programmer. There are many good reasons which makes SQL as the first choice of any programmer −\n\nSQL is the standard language for any Relational Database System. All the Relational Data Base Management Systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.\n\nAlso, software industry is using different dialects of SQL, such as −\n\nMS SQL Server using T-SQL,\n\nOracle using PL/SQL,\n\nMS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL (native format) etc.\n\nSQL Applications\n\nSQL is one of the most widely used Query Language over the databases. SQL provides following functionality to the database programmers −\n\nExecute different database queries against a database.\n\nDefine the data in a database and manipulate that data.\n\nCreate data in a relational database management system.\n\nAccess data from the relational database management system.\n\nCreate and drop databases and tables.\n\nCreate and maintain database users.\n\nCreate view, stored procedure, functions in a database.\n\nSet permissions on tables, procedures and views.\n\nWho Should Learn SQL\n\nThis SQL tutorial will help both students as well as working professionals who want to develop applications based on some databases like banking systems, support systems, information systems, web websites, mobile apps or personal blogs etc. We recommend reading this tutorial, in the sequence listed in the left side menu.\n\nToday, SQL is an essential language to learn for anyone involved in the software applicatipon development process including Software Developers, Software Designers, and Project Managers etc.\n\nPrerequisites to Learn SQL\n\nThough we have tried our best to present the SQL concepts in a simple and easy way, still before you start learning SQL concepts given in this tutorial, it is assumed that you are already aware about some basic concepts of computer science, what is a database, especially the basics of RDBMS and associated concepts.\n\nThis tutorial will give you enough understanding on the various concepts of SQL along with suitable examples so that you can start your Software Development journey immediately after finishing this tutorial.\n\nSQL Online Quizzes\n\nThis SQL tutorial helps you prepare for technical interviews and certification exams.
