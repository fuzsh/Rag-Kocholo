If the affected number of lines is different than expected the step fails.\n\nNote:\n\nLeave the value blank to skip the verification.\n\nIs Update\n\nBoolean\n\nSpecifies whether the SQL query is an update. True for CREATE TABLE, UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE queries. False for all other queries.\n\nProperties\n\nString[]\n\nSpecifies more properties to pass to the database driver. Use an array of key=value pairs. ('=' is required.)\n\nResults To Csv Full Path\n\nString\n\nSpecifies the full path of the file to save results to. The file is in CSV format. This input is relevant only if the operation is select query.\n\nLast Batch Command Number Of Actual Affected Lines\n\nint\n\nThe number of lines that the last SQL Query command affected in batch mode.\n\nNote:\n\nIf not in batch mode, this value is the same as Number Of Actual Affected Lines.\n\nResult Set\n\nObject[][]\n\nThe results in a 2 dimensions array (Object[][]).\n\nThe first dimension is the columns and the second dimension is the rows."
