I have done below steps-\n\n1. installation of driver\n\n2. create symlink --> i am not sure about this step, for now i have created symlinks of libodbc.so, libdbodbc_r.so and libdbodbc_n.so, like below,\n\nlibodbc.so -> libdbodbc17.so\n\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root system 16 Jan 22 16:45 libdbodbc_r.so -> libdbodbc17_r.so\n\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root system 16 Jan 22 16:46 libdbodbc_n.so -> libdbodbc17_n.so\n\n3. tested connection on OS,\n\n[sas@xxxx]</local/apps/SAS94/thirdparty> dbping -d -c \"uid=xxxxxx;pwd=xxxxxxx;eng=xxxxxx;links=tcpip(host=xxxxxx;port=2638);dbn=xxxxxxx\"\n\nSQL Anywhere Server Ping Utility Version 17.0.0.1063\n\nConnected to SQL Anywhere 17.0.8.4043 server \"xxxxxx\" and database \"xxxxxx\"\n\nat address xxxxxxx.\n\nPing database successful.\n\n4. made entry in odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini\n\n5. created ODBC library\n\n6. library testing--> its failing with below error,\n\nERROR: CLI error trying to establish connection: [DataDirect][ODBC lib] Data source name not found and no default driver specified\n\nERROR: Error in the LIBNAME statement.\n\nCould you please tell me post installation steps?\n\nThanks,\n\nMitesh\n\nHave you pointed <<SASHome>>/SASFoundation/9.4/bin/sasenv_local to your odbc.ini file ?\n\nIf yes, make sure the spelling of the DSN in your libname matches the entry in the odbc.ini EXACTLY\n\nAre you using an ODBC driver manager too i.e. do you have multiple ODBC drivers on your system ?\n\nI have made below entry in sasenv_local from SAS foundation/bin/,\n\n#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$ LIBPATH=/local/apps/SAS94/thirdparty/butterfly/lib64:$LIBPATH\n\n$ export LIBPATH\n\ni have made below entry in odbc.ini from data direct folder,\n\nDescription = Sybase ODBC Data Source\n\nUID = xxxxx\n\nPWD = xxxxx\n\nDriver = /shared/thirdparty/butterfly/lib64/libodbc.so\n\nENG = xxxxx\n\nDBN = xxxxx\n\nLINKS = tcpip(host=xxxxx;port=2638)\n\nand below entry in odbcinst.ini,\n\n[SQL Anywhere ODBC]\n\nDriver=/shared/thirdparty/butterfly/lib64/libodbc.so\n\nAPILevel=0\n\nConnectFunctions=YYY\n\nDriverODBCVer=17.0.0.1063\n\nFileUsage=0\n\nHelpRootDirectory=/shared/thirdparty/DataDirect/help\n\nSQLLevel=0\n\nIs i did something wrong here? My SAS does not have sybase license that is the reason i am using ODBC driver to connect sybase. Yes, on my system there are multiple SQL/ODBC drivers are installed.\n\ni have done changes as per your instructions, but still same error-\n\nERROR: CLI error trying to establish connection: [DataDirect][ODBC lib] Data source name not found and no default driver specified\n\nERROR: Error in the LIBNAME statement.\n\nNow my,\n\nodbc.ini-\n\nDescription = Sybase ODBC Data Source\n\nUID = xxxxx\n\nPWD = xxxxx\n\nDriver = /shared/thirdparty/butterfly/lib64/libodbc.so---->this path is where from actual driver installation path\n\nENG = xxxxx\n\nDBN = xxxxx\n\nLINKS = tcpip(host=xxxxxx;port=2638)\n\nodbcinst.ini-\n\n[SQL Anywhere ODBC]\n\nDriver=/shared/thirdparty/DataDirect/lib/libodbc.so---> i have copied my libodbc.so in lib folder of data direct and mentioned same path here now\n\nAPILevel=0\n\nConnectFunctions=YYY\n\nDriverODBCVer=17.0.0.1063\n\nFileUsage=0\n\nHelpRootDirectory=/shared/thirdparty/DataDirect/help\n\nSQLLevel=0\n\nHi Mitesh,\n\nI think how you have configured the SQL Anywhere Driver 17 is having some issue.\n\nCan you please share the content of the folder under the client which you have installed?\n\nAlso the libodbc.so if not wrong is not the one which is comes with the SQL Driver 17 client ? If I am correct this is ODBC driver, where as you will need to use driver of SQL Anywhere Driver 17.\n\nThe files needed for a working SQL Anywhere ODBC driver. These files should be placed in a single directory. The SQL Anywhere installation places them all in the operating-system subdirectory of your SQL Anywhere installation directory (for example, bin32 or bin64).\n\nAIX:\n\nlibdbodbc12.so\n\nlibdbodbc12_n.so\n\nlibdbodm12.so\n\nlibdbtasks12.so\n\nlibdbicu12.so\n\nlibdbicudt12.so\n\ndblg[LL]12.res\n\nSo, please check once your installation, as the driver you are pointing to is wrong one."
