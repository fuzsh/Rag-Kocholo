        "text": "In this SQL tutorial, you’ll learn all the basic to advanced SQL concepts like SQL queries, SQL join, SQL injection, SQL insert, and creating tables in SQL. SQL is easy to learn, there are no prerequisites to learning SQL.\n\nSo, SQL is a standard database language used to access and manipulate data in databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It was developed by IBM Computer Scientists in the 1970s. By executing queries SQL can create, update, delete, and retrieve data in databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. Overall, SQL is a query language that communicates with databases.\n\nWhat is a Database?\n\nBefore deep diving into this free SQL tutorial, let’s understand what a database is.\n\nSo, data is the new fuel of this world, but data is unorganized information, so to organize that data, we make a database. A database is an organized collection of structured data, usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Databases help us easily store, access, and manipulate data held on a computer.\n\nSQL Example\n\nIn this detailed SQL tutorial for beginners, we’ll explore practical SQL examples for managing employee data within a database. We’ll create a table to store employee information and populate it with sample data like Employee_Id, Name, Age, Department, and Salary.\n\nIf you want to retrieves data from the employees table where the salary is greater than 55000.00 then we will use SELECT Statement.\n\nQuery:\n\nSELECT * FROM employees WHERE Salary > 55000.00;\n\nOutput:\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis SELECT statement retrieves records from the employees table where the Salary column is greater than 55000.00. The * symbol indicates that we want to retrieve all columns for the matching records. The WHERE clause filters the results based on the specified condition.\n\nWhy to Learn SQL?\n\nSQL helps you to easily get information from data with high efficiency. To manipulate the data in databases like Create, Read, Edit, and Delete, we use SQL queries. Users can interact with data stored in relational database management systems. Anyone who knows the English language can easily write SQL queries. Some of the key features of SQL are given below:\n\nWithout a lot of coding knowledge, we can manage a database with SQL.\n\nSQL works with database systems from Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, etc.\n\nSimple and easy to learn.\n\nSQL is an ANSI and ISO standard language for database manipulation.\n\nSQL retrieves large amounts of data very fast.\n\nPre-Requisites to Learn SQL\n\nIf you want to learn SQL then, this free SQL tutorial is quite easy to understand because, during the development of this course, we tried our best to provide the best resource to clear your SQL concept.\n\nBut we assume that you are already aware of the basic conceptions of computer science, like databases and its types.\n\nSo, if you have basic knowledge of RDBMS, then this SQL tutorial provides you with enough knowledge to master SQL.\n\nSQL Basics\n\nSQL or Structure Query Language is a fundamental skill for anyone who wants to interact with databases.
