        "text": "The minimum configuration recommended for production usage of Tableau Server is based on these hardware specifications:\n\n8 physical cores / 16V-CPU (ex.AWS)\n\n128 GB system memory\n\n50 GB minimum free disk space\n\nTableau Prep Conductor\n\nWe recommend deploying Tableau Prep Conductor on a dedicated node with a minimum of 4 cores and 16 GB of memory. Additional resources may be needed depending on the use case. Contact Tableau for sizing and technical guidance.\n\nTableau Resource Monitoring Tool\n\nThe Tableau Resource Monitoring tool has two components - an agent that is installed on each node of the Tableau Server cluster it is monitoring, and the RMT Server for processing and hosting the web service. A separate machine/VM is needed for the RMT Server, where all processing and analysis takes place. The minimum specifications for the RMT Server are:\n\nMicrosoft Windows Server 2016, 2019, and 2022\n\nAlma Linux 8.x and 9.x, Amazon Linux 2 and 2023, CentOS 7.9+, CentOS Stream 8.x and 9.x, Oracle Linux 7.3+, 8.x and 9.x, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.3+, 8.3+ and 9.x, Rocky Linux 8.x and 9.x, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS, all on x86-64 chipsets only (ARM-based processors are not supported), Linux distro\n\nCPUs must support SSE4.2 and POPCNT instruction sets\n\n8 physical CPU cores (16 vCPUs)\n\n64GB RAM\n\n500GB Disk Space, SSD drive or similar for performance\n\nFor RMT Server installations that match the minimum hardware specified above, the Resource Monitoring Tool can provide performance reporting for Tableau Server deployments serving up to 10,000 views per hour.\n\nFor deployments with more view loads per hour, or very high numbers of background jobs, data delays may occur. In these cases, you may need to upgrade your hardware.\n\nTableau Content Migration Tool\n\nThe Content Migration Tool is run from a Windows computer and is able to connect to Tableau Servers with Advanced Management enabled. To review compatible versions of Tableau Server and Content Migration Tool, please check here. The minimum specifications are:\n\nMicrosoft Windows 8 or newer (x64)\n\nIntel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 (Dual Core)\n\n4GB or larger\n\n2GB HDD free or larger. You may need additional disk space if you are migrating large amounts of content. All content is stored locally on disk, during a migration.\n\nEnterprise Deployments\n\nContact Tableau for sizing and technical guidance.\n\nRead our Tableau Server Scalability white paper for architecture recommendations and to see benchmark results."
