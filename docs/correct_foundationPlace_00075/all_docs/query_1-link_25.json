It is thus crucial to stay safe online and be cautious of how and where you look for and accept jobs.\n\nSome of our potential candidates have reported having received fraudulent job offers after posting their resumes on certain websites and job portals. People posing as Cybage employees sent these fake job offers, promising guaranteed selection or requesting a fee for application consideration. Beware of such letters as they may appear legitimate with a job description, salary details, our company logo, or details stolen from social networking pages.\n\nCybage values integrity and transparency. Our open hiring process does not guarantee selection but ensures candidates stand a fair chance solely based on their performance at the pre-employment assessments and rounds of interviews.\n\nKindly note that Cybage has not authorized any agencies or partners, including Cybage's own recruitment team, to collect any fee at any stage of the hiring process."
