        "text": "Hello Postgresers,\n\nI don't know where better to post this, but feel free to forward this on\n\nelsewhere. I haven't seen anything on this posted in Postgres circles\n\n(though I might have missed it!), so I thought someone should. What\n\nfollows is about two pages of PostgreSQL's (pre?) history (including a\n\nlittle on server internals that might be of interest to some) followed by\n\nan invitation to a public lecture with reception/celebration, and an\n\nannouncement of a new endowment in support of undergraduate and first-year\n\ngraduate student research in database management systems. Attached below\n\nmy text are two emails from coleagues from the early days discussing the\n\nlecture that you might find interesting reading.\n\nOld timers here probably know something about Postgres' early history.\n\nSome of us, like myself, have had some direct involvement, though I have\n\nnever taken a role with PostgreSql, nor was I a student involved with\n\nPostgres. I got involved in 1989 when I joined RTI reporting to the VP\n\nlevel and became more closely involved when Mike Stonebraker hired me to\n\nlead a project for him at UCB while the Postgres project was still funded.\n\nI would love to know something more of PostgreSql.org's history, but, at\n\nthe risk of some error, I can give you a basic outline of the early\n\nhistory of Postgres - how it came to be. Please correct me if I happen to\n\nerr...\n\nIt _should_ go without saying that Postgres was the follow-on project -\n\nand inheritor of the intellectual capital - from Ingres at the University\n\nCalifornia, Berkeley, led by Professor Michael Stonebraker... \"Back in the\n\nday,\" in the late 1970s, Mike became interested in the concept of the\n\nrelational database and his team of students was one of the leading\n\nresearch groups. They named their project \"Ingres\" after a French painter\n\n- pre-impressionist, I believe. \"University Ingres\" is widely considered\n\nthe first successful implementation of a relational database engine and\n\nits public domain source code was the starting code line for Oracle,\n\nSybase, Informix, Britton Lee and a few other popular commercial RDBMSes,\n\nas well as Postgres in all its forms.\n\nIn 1976, Michael Stonebraker, Eugene Wong, Peter Kreps and Jerry Held\n\npublished a paper titled \"The Design and Implementation of Ingres\", and it\n\nwasn't long until companies like Oracle and Britton Lee were\n\ncommercializing this work. So, in 1980, Mike and some of his students\n\nstarted a company known as Relational Technology Inc., RTI (later Ingres\n\nCorporation) and made their own commercial implementation. Their version,\n\nknown simply as \"Ingres,\" was fantastic, widely considered the best\n\nproduct by far in the industry. I joined RTI in 1989, just as \"Release 6\"\n\nwas being introduced.\n\nAs many here are internals-oriented, it's worth a brief digression on the\n\ninternals; Given the compute resources of the day, Release 6 used a\n\nmulti-server, multi-threaded architecture that used shared memory and\n\nsemaphores on Unix based platforms, and a device driver on VMS, for\n\ninterprocess communications. It was a miniature operating system, complete\n\nwith internally managed threads, slaves for asynchronous I/O, and a\n\nhalf-dozen or so \"facilities\" providing a clean interface for thread\n\nmanagement. One main codeline was written against a \"compatibility\n\nlibrary\" that resolved differences between system flavors, and \"porting\"\n\nto a new platform was mostly all about modifying the CL as appropriate.\n\nThe servers internal facilities included such as PF, the Parser Facility,\n\nOPF, the Optimizer Facility, QEF, the Query Execution Facility, DMF, the\n\nData Manipulation Facility, and so forth. In production, heavily loaded,\n\nhighly concurrent environments especially, it was the \"cat's meow.\"\n\nImportantly, the genius Eric Lundblad contributed a wonderful statistics\n\nbased optimizer that kept track of the domains of table attributes using\n\nhistograms. This permitted the cost-based optimizer facility to evaluate\n\nand choose a query plan based upon estimated CPU and I/O costs of\n\nperforming a query in alternative ways. For example, projection and\n\nrestriction steps whose estimates were smallest were very nearly always\n\nchosen to be performed first, and if they could be fetched from an index,\n\nso much the better, especially if it could avoid access to the underlying\n\ntable. While other systems required query authors to understand the\n\nimplications of the order used in the way they wrote their queries -\n\ncalled manual query optimization - Ingres gave outstanding performance\n\neven when the query was written in the worst possible way. ...As I did\n\ncomparative benchmarks for marketing occasionally, I can tell you that\n\nIngres beat its best competition by more than 10X, and sometimes more than\n\n100X in nearly all real-world scenarios, even with outstanding manual\n\nquery optimization.\n\nAfter the commercialization of Ingres, the University Ingres team\n\ncontinued on. In an effort to keep leading the way, Mike's UCB team moved\n\ninto expanding datatypes. After not very long, they had added \"Universal\n\nData Types\" to University Ingres, along with functions and operators\n\nneeded to make them work. This was quickly adopted by the commercial\n\nIngres team, then known as Ingres Corporation. I really don't recall just\n\nwhat the timing was but I think the Berkeley team, after UDT development\n\nbut before commercialization, realized that they could rewrite University\n\nIngres to use the whole set of UDT concepts throughout the project, and\n\nthey felt it deserved a new name - I think this also coincided with a\n\nswitch in grant money... Since it was now \"after Ingres\", someone came up\n\nwith the name Postgres, and it stuck. I vaguely recall seeing t-shirts\n\nwith the new name in 1992 - \"PostgreSql\", \"Postgres the Sequel\", they\n\nproclaimed.\n\nIn 1993, as I recall, one of my reports at Ingres, Paul Brown, left my\n\ngroup to join Mike's team at UCB, and the following year, after Ingres was\n\nbought by Computer Associates, Mike convinced me to lead a research team\n\nfor him at UCB, working right along side the Postgres folks. However, by\n\nthe time the bureaucratic wheels turned enough for Mike to hire me as a\n\nresearcher with managerial authority, the Postgres team was already\n\nwinding down. I think they had grant money through to September or\n\nNovember of '94, but in any case, Paul was the last Postgres-hire (a paid\n\nresearcher), and, thankfully, left them to join my team immediately -\n\nalong with Turing Award-winner Jim Gray, among others.\n\nI lost Paul again when he jumped ship about a year later to go to\n\nIllustra, the company Mike founded for the commercialization of Postgres.\n\nWithin a handfull of months after Paul joined them, Illustra was bought by\n\nInformix, who tried to integrate Illustra with their RDBMS. In short, I\n\nthink their integration lost the best of Postgres by keeping the worst\n\nparts of both systems, if you were to ask me, but either way Informix went\n\non to be bought by IBM. (Meanwhile, I kept on working for Mike at UCB,\n\nlater getting my own grants, and finally commercializing my own work by\n\nfounding Science Tools...)\n\nSo, here it is all these years later. Someone else will have to step in\n\nand tell us how this Postgres Open-Source movement got started, if any of\n\nthe folks had connections to UCB, the original Postgres team, and so\n\nforth. I can't tell you anything about that. What I can add, however, is\n\nthat there will be a public lecture given by Michael Stonebraker, Eugene\n\nWong, Peter Kreps and Jerry Held regarding their paper \"The Design and\n\nImplementation of INGRES\" on Wednesday, Nov 29th, at Soda Hall, UC\n\nBerkeley, with reception to follow immediately thereafter. More\n\ninformation and (free) registration is here:\n\nhttp://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/IPRO/INGRES30/\n\nI think you have until the first of November to register.\n\nBelow are some emails that you may find of some interest on this same\n\nsubject. Note that the Ingres community, some twelve plus years after the\n\ncompany's demise, still hangs to gether as Ex-Ingres - \"Ingres Corporate\n\nCulture without the corporation!\"\n\nIn closing, I'd very much enjoy meeting folks from the PostgreSql team,\n\nespecially the core members. You'll find me at this talk/reception - hope\n\nto see you there.\n\nRegards,\n\nRichard\n\n--\n\nRichard Troy, Chief Scientist\n\nScience Tools Corporation\n\n510-924-1363 or 202-747-1263\n\nrtroy(at)ScienceTools(dot)com, http://ScienceTools.com/\n\n--\n\nFrom: elein <elein at varlena.com>\n\nTo: exingres at exingres.org\n\nSubject: [ExIngres] Invitation to Stonebraker/Wong/Held/Kreps lecture at UCB\n\nI received this message from Dr. Paula Hawthorn who is involved in\n\nsetting up the endowment fund mentioned below. She asked me to forward\n\nit to this list since the subject may be near and dear to the database\n\nfans among us as well as the people who worked at INGRES early on. Please\n\nfeel free to forward the message to others who may be interested.\n\nIt will be great to give the *original* INGRES some credit it deserves\n\nas well as to give a hand to the next generation of database geeks.\n\n--elein\n\nelein at varlena.com\n\nDear Friends:\n\nThis year marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of the paper \"The\n\nDesign and Implementation of INGRES\". To mark this occasion, Cal EECS is\n\ninviting the authors, Michael Stonebraker, Gene Wong, Jerry Held and Peter\n\nKreps to give a Distinguished Lecture this fall.\n\nYou are invited to both the lecture and the reception that will follow.\n\nThe lecture will begin at 4PM on Wednesday, Nov. 29, the reception shortly\n\nafter. If you are planning to attend, it is important that you register\n\nfor the reception by October 1.\n\nFor details, and to register, go to\n\nhttp://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/IPRO/INGRES30/\n\nAt the reception, Mike & Gene's students & colleagues will be announcing\n\nthe UC Berkeley College of Engineering Mike Stonebraker-Eugene Wong\n\nEndowment Fund. The proceeds from this Fund will go to support UCB\n\nundergraduate and first-year graduate student research in database\n\nmanagement systems. Funds for the support of undergraduate and first-year\n\ngraduate students are currently hard to obtain, so the faculty are very\n\nsupportive of this, as are Gene & Mike. The students who receive the funds\n\nwill be chosen by the DBMS faculty, working with the Department Chair. To\n\ndonate to this Endowment, go to\n\nhttp://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/IPRO/INGRES30/\n\nThe first 20 people who donate $1,000 or more will receive parking passes!\n\nWe'll see you at the reception!\n\nPaula\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nExingres -- Ingres corporate culture without the corporation\n\nFor more ExIngres services, see http://ExIngres.org/"
