It also as you may have guessed by now spawned Postgres which means Post-Ingress.\n\nIn the early days of Postgres there was no SQL. No not NoSQL, there was not SQL. Postgres had its own query language. It wasn’t until 1995 that Postgres received SQL support, and with its addition of SQL support it updated its name to PostgreSQL.\n\nYou see, with Postgres becoming PostgreSQL we began a journey of Postgres being mispronounced for its forseeable future and it is still currently the case. Is it really that big of an issue? Well it’s big enough that the PostgreSQL website has a FAQ including “How to pronounce PostgreSQL”. As it stands today there are two generally accepted names:\n\npost-GRES-que-ell\n\nPostgres\n\nWith one of the above there is far less confusion. And in fact I’m not the only one to share this opinion. Tom Lane is a major contributor to every Postgres release for more than the last decade. He’s one of the top 10 contributors to open source in general having worked on the JPEG/PNG/TIFF image formats before coming over to database land. Tom has this classic email in the PostgreSQL mailing list:\n\n[>> Can i get data in postgre from non-postgre db? > The name is PostgreSQL or Postgres, not postgre. It might help to explain that the pronunciation is \"post-gres\" or \"post-gres-cue-ell\", not \"post-gray-something\". I heard people making this same mistake in presentations at this past weekend's Postgres Anniversary Conference :-( Arguably, the 1996 decision to call it PostgreSQL instead of reverting to plain Postgres was the single worst mistake this project ever made. It seems far too late to change now, though. regards, tom lane\n\nThe best part is this was mail was 2006, when it was arguably too late to change the name, and here we are in 2018 with the same issue.\n\nPersonally I may start calling it Postgre just to emphasize a point, but for the rest of you just going with Postgres is probably a safe choice."
