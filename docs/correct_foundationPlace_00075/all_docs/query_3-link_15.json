        "text": "A multidatabase consists of a collection of independent databases that share and exchange data while preserving their autonomy. Databases contain data about objects and object connections. In this paper we examine the problem of sharing data on objects in a multidatabase, and present an architecture for identifying and referencing objects across databases of a relational multidatabase. This architecture involves associating every database of a relational multidatabase with two relations that contain the identifiers of local and foreign objects, respectively, and enforcing inner and inter database referential integrity constraints. The proposed architecture has no effect on the original organization and manipulation of data in databases. We examine the main aspects of implementing this architecture with relational database management systems."
