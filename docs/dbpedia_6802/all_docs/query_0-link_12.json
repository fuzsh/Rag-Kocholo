        "text": "Roger Harry Daltrey CBE (born 1 March 1944) is an English singer, musician and actor. He is a co-founder and the lead singer of the rock band the Who.\n\nDaltrey's hit songs with the Who include \"My Generation\", \"Pinball Wizard\", \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"You Better You Bet\". He began his solo career in 1973, while still a member of the Who. Since then he has released ten solo studio albums, five compilation albums, and one live album. His solo hits include \"Giving It All Away\", \"Walking the Dog\", \"Written on the Wind\", \"Free Me\", \"Without Your Love\" and \"Under a Raging Moon\".\n\nThe Who are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century and have sold over 100 million records worldwide. As a member of the band, Daltrey received a Lifetime achievement award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988, and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. He and Pete Townshend received Kennedy Center Honors in 2008 and The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on 21 May 2016. Daltrey has also been an actor and film producer, with roles in films, theatre, and television. Planet Rock listeners voted him rock's fifth-greatest voice in 2009, and he was ranked number 61 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 greatest singers of all time in 2010.\n\nReviews\n\nNamed a ‘BEST BOOK’ OF 2018 by Kirkus & The Guardian\n\n\"Unaffected, lucid, and entertaining: One of the best rock memoirs in recent memory. \" ―Kirkus (starred review)\n\n\"Colorful. . . .The curly-haired, microphone-swinging, full-throated frontman of The Who brings a Cockney conversationalism to the story of his life and complicated relationship with his legendary bandmates.\"―USA TODAY (3.5/4-star review)\n\n\"A working-class brawler, a delinquent tea boy in a sheet metal factory, discovers within himself the psychic-emotional circuitry to conduct some of the rarest electricity in rock ’n’ roll. It’s like a Who song. 'Empathy, that’s the root of it all,' he writes at the end of his book . . . Daltrey’s peculiar swaggering selflessness is the key to this book, and a key (one of four) to the Who . . . How many rock memoirs actually have a meaning?\"―The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"Vivid, atmospheric and funny, and, because of [Daltrey's] aversion to mind-altering substances, it's probably one of the more reliable accounts of life in one of the world's biggest rock bands.\"―The Guardian\n\n\"He wasn’t just the right front man for The Who, but the perfect front man. . . . Daltrey relays a number of familiar stories from the Who biography – but with the added insight of his perspective.\"―Houston Press"
