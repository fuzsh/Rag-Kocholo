        "text": "By Dave Gil de Rubio\n\nContributing Writer\n\nResiliency is a major part of Roger Daltrey’s DNA. At the age of 74, the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer continues to remain active while avoiding becoming an oldies act.\n\nIn 2014, Daltrey recorded “Going Back Home” with ex-Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson, who was then dying from pancreatic cancer. A mutual love of Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, old-school R&B and the idea of making music to get Johnson’s mind off his diagnosis led to the release of this surprise UK hit album.\n\nA surgeon listening in on an interview Johnson was doing promoting the new project invited him to come in on the off-chance he was misdiagnosed. When the diagnosis led to surgery and a cancer-free life, Daltrey was delighted about the turn of events. Surprised by the record’s sales numbers, the record company approached The Who frontman about a Daltrey-Johnson sequel.\n\nDeclining to do so based on the idea that a follow-up wouldn’t equal the impact of the first, Daltrey agreed to do a similar solo version of “Going Back Home.” It led to “As Long As I Have You,” the septuagenarian rocker’s 10th and most recent solo album. The music of that release and Who hits and rarities will make up Daltrey’s set at Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio on Saturday, Aug. 18.\n\nReuniting with producer Dave Eringa from the Johnson project, Daltrey chose to revisit the vibe and spirit of his pre-High Numbers/Who days with Pete Townshend, when their band was playing soul music to small crowds in church halls. The result is a mix of heartfelt and melancholy originals and a mix of rich covers from artists ranging from Stevie Wonder, Manassas and Garnet Mimms to Joe Tex and Nick Cave.\n\n“This is the kind of music The Who were playing before Pete started writing songs. But obviously, we weren’t singing [originals like these] in those days because I hadn’t had the life experience that I’ve had now. Although I sang the notes and words in those days, I didn’t quite have the body that the songs have now,” he recalled. “So it was really great going back to them and revisiting that style of music, which I love. I’ve done it as an antithesis of the pop stuff that’s out there at the moment, which I loathe.”\n\nThe choice of material he chose to cover all have their own connection with Daltrey and not something he takes lightly.\n\n“First of all, I have to be able to relate to the song. The words have to be part of my journey. For instance, in the Stephen Stills song, Stephen gave me permission to change the words to make it my song. So I don’t sing the words that he originally wrote to it and I always try inhabit the song as a part of me,” Daltrey explained. “The Garnet Mimms [opening lyric] ‘Born in darkness…’—I was born in a bloody air raid. That’s really it. I’m a huge Nick Cave fan, but he sings it quite darkly, that song. I can hear something else in it that’s so touching and I wanted to see if I could achieve it.”\n\nThe original songs stand on their own, none more so than “Always Heading Home,’ a song Daltrey co-wrote with novelist Nigel Hinton that is a closing track that addresses aging, memories and dreams amid the slightest hint of strings and piano that adds up to quite an impactful coda.\n\n“‘Always Heading Home’ is something that I wrote a long time ago. It’s a spiritual song that I didn’t think would ever find a home,” he said. “Since I thought this might the last record I may ever make, I decided I was going to put ‘Always Heading Home’ on it.”\n\nAfter starting preliminary work on “As Long As I Have You,” Daltrey hit the road with The Who for its “Beginning of the Long Goodbye Tour,” which he was quick to point out is ongoing.\n\nComing off that stretch of dates, the vocalist was hit with a bout of meningitis. And while his recovery involved a loss of hearing, he was discouraged by what he’d recorded up to that point. It was Townshend who provided encouragement and musical support that allowed the project to come to fruition. It’s an assertion Daltrey is quick and proud to point out.\n\n“When I went back to listen to what I’d done prior to [the tour], I thought it was rubbish. Then Pete was suddenly given my tapes through management and he loved it,” he said. “He called me up and said, ‘You ought to finish it Roger and I’ll play guitar on it.’ And that was it for me. I’ve always respected his musical talent and if he says it’s good, then it’s all right.”\n\nIf you go\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 18\n\nWhere: Fantasy Springs Resort Casino, 84245 Indio Springs Parkway, Indio\n\nTickets: $69-$129\n\nInformation: 760-342-5000, fantasyspringsresort.com"
