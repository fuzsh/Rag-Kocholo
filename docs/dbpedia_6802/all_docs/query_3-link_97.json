        "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nRock icon Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, doesn’t want you checking the setlist before the show.\n\n“There’s no surprises left with concerts these days, ’cause everybody wants to see the setlist,” he told Billboard. “I’m fucking sick of it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSetlists are often posted on social media and websites such as Setlist.fm. As a result, many fans often know most, if not all, of the songs to expect at a concert.\n\nAnd Daltrey hates it.\n\n“The internet’s ruined the live shows for me,” he said. “Who wants to know what’s coming next? People forget about surprises. I can’t stand it.”\n\nBillboard suggested that some fans might just want to know when they can go to the bathroom without missing a favorite song.\n\n“Why not just start to listen to the bloody show in the toilet, then?” he said, although the website noted he was laughing as he spoke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead the full interview at Billboard."
