        "text": "Quite dapper in a Victorian frock coat, period chalk-stripe trousers and a black top hat, Gerald Charles Dickens, great-great-grandson of the great, great novelist, pointed his walking stick at the audience gathered here at the local library.\n\n''Bah, humbug,'' he said.\n\nMr. Dickens, an English actor, is 35, a little young yet, and far too pleasant looking, for the initial grave misanthropy of Ebenezer Scrooge, the famous character (created by his famous ancestor) that he was busily recreating on a makeshift stage. Still, that didn't faze the audience, 100 or so children and their mothers, all of them either being introduced to or revisiting ''A Christmas Carol,'' the sentimental story of a bitter man redeemed by stern but benevolent ghosts on Christmas Eve.\n\nIt hasn't escaped Mr. Dickens's notice that, English provenance notwithstanding, the Carol, as scholars often refer to it, has become perhaps America's most significant -- secularly speaking -- holiday legend.\n\nHe has spent the last three Christmas seasons in this country, doing one-man performances of the Carol and other Dickensiana in hotels, theaters and libraries, many in towns in the South and Midwest where live theater performances of any kind are far from daily fare. Here in Lone Jack, a rural community about an hour southeast of Kansas City, his listeners gathered afterward for autographs and a brush with literary history.\n\n''Dickens has total celebrity status over here,'' Mr. Dickens said in an interview. ''In England, we are blase about him. It's more like 'We've got Chaucer, we've got Shakespeare, all those other blokes.' Here they show me their copies of the Carol and hold them out reverently, as though it were an altar cloth. The first year I did this, I was in total shock.''\n\nShocked? He probably shouldn't even have been surprised, for the Carol is such a favorite, such a guaranteed revenue producer, that according to the Theater Communications Group, an umbrella organization for nonprofit theaters, there are 33 member theaters producing it this season; in other words, about 10 percent of the nonprofit professional theaters in the United States are staging the Carol right now. And that, of course, doesn't include the countless amateur productions, or the enterprise of the merchants in Skaneateles, N.Y., near Syracuse, who five years ago created an annual Dickens festival on December weekends, with actors performing scenes from the Carol on street corners.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
