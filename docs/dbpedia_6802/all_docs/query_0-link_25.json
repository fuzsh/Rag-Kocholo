Tickets for the event, held to raise money for the Maryville Academy, are $300. The opening band is Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder and his other band C Average. Pete suffers with painful tinnitus due to the proximity of Zak Starkey's drums. Also, for the first time after Pete Townshend had written the song for The Who to perform at Live Aid in 1985, The Who finally get around to playing \"After The Fire.\". Later released on the short-lived CD/download The Blues to the Bush are, from the first night, \"Substitute,\" âYou Better You Bet,â â5.15,â âWonât Get Fooled Again,â and âThe Kids Are Alright.\" From the second night comes \"Pinball Wizard,\" âPure and Easy,â \"Getting in Tune,\" \"Behind Blue Eyes,\" âMagic Bus,â âBoris the Spider,â âAfter the Fire,â and âWho Are You.â \"Substitute,\" âPinball Wizard,ââGetting in Tune,â and âBehind Blue Eyesâ have studio overdubs on the release.\n\nThe next day Pete is interviewed live on WXRT-FM Chicago.

Life and Times of S. Carter - Jay-Z; Songs from the Last Century - George Michael\n\nIn the run-up to the premiere of his radio play of Life House, Pete does a couple of interviews, appearing on Radio 2's The Steve Wright Show on the 2nd and BBC Hard Talk on the 3rd.\n\nOn the 4th and 5th, Roger performs in a rock 'n' roll version of Handel's \"Messiah\" in Dublin. Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight and actor Adian Quinn also participate and the show airs on Ireland's RTE. A storm of controversy swirls around it due to the amount of government grant money used to stage the production. In fact, the cost is so high, the production fails to raise projected money intended for charity.\n\nAlso on the 4th, ITV airs an episode of its Classic Albums series focusing on the recording of Who's Next. The excellent documentary is made with the participation of Pete, Roger and John who discuss the album's background and revisit the master tapes. The show is subsequently released for home video.\n\nOn the 5th, Pete's radio version of Life House premieres on BBC Radio 3. Heavily re-written by Pete and Jeff Young from Pete's 1971 conception, the story is now set at the millennium as a farmer leaves his wife to search for his runaway daughter in London. He is accompanied by himself as a young boy and an imaginary playfriend from childhood on a voyage that takes them through the scarred landscape of a post-World War II and post-Thatcher Britain. His daughter, meanwhile, hooks up with a \"hacker\" who leads her and many others to the Life House where they vanish, leaving the farmer alone, stripped of his family, in an teenage-less wasteland. The musical accompaniment is a mix of Pete's demos and orchestrated versions of tunes from Who's Next and Vivaldi. The script is published the next day by Simon & Schuster in the U.K. and the play is sold first as a two-cassette tape from the BBC then included in Pete's Lifehouse Chronicles boxset.\n\nOn the 6th, an exhibit of the artwork connected with Pete's Avatar boxset is exhibited at the Corningsby Gallery in London through the 11th. Also on the 6th, Pete places two messages on his website, the first asking for understanding about his changing his mind about the existence of The Who. \"I am doing it out of love, friendship and because I think I'm really going to enjoy it.\" He also clears up the confusing credit for his song \"North Country Girl\" on his solo album All The Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes explaining he adapted the song after hearing it on a Roy Harper album where it was credited as \"Traditional: arr by Roy Harper\".\n\nOn the 7th, John is voted Bass Guitarist of the Millennium by readers of the British magazine Guitar. On the same day a press report is released that details Pete's 3-year relationship with the 26 year-old musician Rachel Fuller.\n\nOn the 15th, Pete premeires his commercial website eelpie.com where he will begin selling his solo albums.\n\nOn the 22nd and 23rd, the new edition of the five-man Who makes its British premiere as The Who play their home ground at the Shepherd's Bush Empire. The later release The Blues to the Bush has \"I Can't Explain\" and \"My Wife\" from the first night and \"Anyway Anyhow Anywhere,\" \"Baba O'Riley,\" \"I'm a Boy,\" \"The Real Me,\" and \"My Generation\" from the second night. All these tracks except \"My Generation\" feature studio overdubs.\n\nRoger is scheduled to perform with the British Rock Symphony on New Year's Eve as the 1900's turn into the 2000's at a charity event at The Ronald Reagan Building in Washington D.C. but it is canceled because of lack of ticket sales blamed on fears of a Y2K terrorist attack."
