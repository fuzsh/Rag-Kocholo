        "text": "Roger Daltrey’s legendary howl, Pete Townshend’s shredding riffs, John Entwistle’s throbbing bass and Keith Moon’s furious drumming. It’s the ingredient list of an epic time listening to one of Britain’s most respected bands: The Who.\n\nAnd on this day in 1976, the four London boys broke the sound barrier at the Valley, the football stadium for the Charlton Athletic team. Over 80,000 rock fans were in attendance when The Who performed their deafening set.\n\nWith the ear-splitting concert, The Who earned the Guinness World Record for the “Globe’s Loudest Band” at a massive 126 dB. Shortly after, the Guinness Book of World Records organisation removed the record from their books citing that they didn’t want to encourage concerts that could damage people’s hearing.\n\nGiven that, here’s a brief history of deaf-defying concerts.\n\nThe Pre-Guinness era\n\nBefore the Guinness Book of World Records appeared, there were still loud gigs. Even before electronic amplification there were some ear-splitting feats.\n\nSome of the earliest examples of roaring concert are thanks to classical musicians stocking their orchestra with as many musicians as possible. The 1813 premiere of Beethoven’s ‘Wellington’s Victory’ featured more than 100 musicians. An astounding amount for the time.\n\nThat was small fries though when compared with Tchaikovsky’s requirements for his ‘1812 Overture’ in 1880. His musical score had the instruction “ffff” written in it. One “f” means “loud” or “forte” in musical notation. When there are four, that means “very very very loud” or “fortissississimo”. It’s all because of a key section in the piece where Tchaikovsky wants canons to fire. Some performances have had anti-aircraft guns and tanks fire during the key section.\n\nThe Guinness era\n\nFor a brief moment in time, everything came together. Electric amplification was here. Rock bands were the most popular music acts in the world. And Guinness Book of World Records was taking notice.\n\nThe first band to earn the record of “Globe’s Loudest Band” was Blue Cheer. The American rock band pioneered the use of Marshall Amps – now a staple of the rock scene – in their gigs. It was a booming precedent. Blue Cheer created a new goal for testosterone-fuelled rockers from that point on.\n\nNext, the record was taken by Deep Purple. Their 1972 gig at the London Rainbow Theatre peaked at 117 dB and caused three audience members to fall unconscious.\n\nThat record stood for just a few years before The Who’s epic 1976 set. In 1984, the book listed Manowar as the final record holder before it was officially abandoned.\n\nThe Post-Guinness era\n\nJust because the record went away, doesn’t mean the boys with guitars gave up. Since the 70s, there have been many claimants to being the loudest band on Earth.\n\nFirst Manowar claimed they beat their own record with a 129.5 dB gig in Hanover in 1994. This was nothing when compared with the feat of English House/Electronica band Leftfield. While playing the Brixton Academy in 1996, their sound system shook the building so much, pieces of plaster fell from the ceiling.\n\nLeftfield literally blew the roof off the Brixton Academy. In doing so, their concert recorded a terrifying loud high of 135 dB.\n\nNever wanting to be outdone, Manowar registered a 139 dB during a soundcheck in 2008 and Kiss managed 136 dB during a Canadian performance."
