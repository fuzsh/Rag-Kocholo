        "text": "This much is familiar: On January 25, 1964, the Beatles‚Äô single ‚ÄúI Want to Hold Your Hand‚Äù entered the American Top 40. On February 1 it reached No. 1. On February 7 the Beatles arrived in New York for their inaugural U.S. visit, and two days later played on The Ed Sullivan Show to hysterical response and record viewership, thereby effecting a cataclysmic cultural shift and triggering a musical movement that would come to be known as the British Invasion. Cue screaming girls, fringe haircuts, Murray the K, etc.\n\nWhat‚Äôs less remembered are the specifics of precisely what and whom this invasion encompassed. Today, the term ‚Äúthe British Invasion‚Äù is usually employed to describe (and market) the triumphal epoch of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Who, with honorable mentions to the Kinks and the Animals. In hindsight, and on merit, this sounds about right‚Äîthese are the best and most revered of the English bands who came of age in the 1960s‚Äîbut the reality of the British Invasion, which was at its most intense in the two years immediately following the Beatles‚Äô landfall, was somewhat different. Far from being solely a beat-group explosion, the Invasion was a rather eclectic phenomenon that took in everything from Petula Clark‚Äôs lushly symphonic pop to Chad and Jeremy‚Äôs dulcet folk-schlock to the Yardbirds‚Äô blues-rock rave-ups. And while the Beatles were unquestionably the movement‚Äôs instigators and dominant force, the Rolling Stones and the Who were, initially, among the least successful of the invaders‚Äîthe former group struggling throughout ‚Äô64 to gain a foothold in America while the Dave Clark Five, Herman‚Äôs Hermits, and even Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas vaulted ahead of them, the latter group struggling even to get its terrific run of early singles (‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Explain,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnyway Anyhow Anywhere,‚Äù ‚ÄúMy Generation,‚Äù ‚ÄúSubstitute‚Äù) released in the United States. (Arguably, given that they didn‚Äôt perform in America or chart in its Top 40 until 1967, with ‚ÄúHappy Jack,‚Äù the Who don‚Äôt even qualify as an Invasion band.)\n\nThe British Invasion was, nevertheless, a very real phenomenon. Prior to 1964, only two British singles had ever topped *Billboard‚Äô*s Hot 100 chart‚ÄîAcker Bilk‚Äôs ‚ÄúStranger on the Shore‚Äù and the Tornadoes‚Äô ‚ÄúTelstar,‚Äù both instrumentals‚Äîand between them they held the No. 1 spot for a total of four weeks. In the 1964‚Äì65 period, by contrast, British acts were at No. 1 for an astounding 56 weeks combined. In 1963 a mere three singles by British artists cracked the American Top 40. In 1964, 65 did, and in 1965, a further 68 did. Beyond all the statistics, the English musicians who came to America between 1964 and 1966 found themselves in the grip of a rampant, utterly unanticipated Anglophilia that made them irresistibly chic and sexy no matter what their background‚ÄîLondon or Liverpool, middle class or working class, art school or tradesman‚Äôs apprentice, skiffle or trad jazz. Anything English and sufficiently youthful was embraced, exalted, fondled, and fainted over. This applied not only to the important bands whose music would stand the test of time, like the Beatles, the Stones, and the Kinks, but also to such confectioners of engaging period work as the Hollies and Herman‚Äôs Hermits, and to such one-hit wonders as Ian Whitcomb (‚ÄúYou Turn Me On‚Äù) and the dubiously named Nashville Teens (‚ÄúTobacco Road‚Äù). America lapped it all up, and the cultural exchange proved beneficial to both sides: the Brits, still very much in the throes of postwar privation, saw their nascent ‚Äúswinging‚Äù youth culture further buttressed, their country abruptly transformed from black-and-white to color; the Americans, still very much in mourning for John F. Kennedy, were administered a needed dose of fun, and, thus re-invigorated, resumed the youthquake that had lapsed into dormancy when Elvis joined the army, Little Richard found God, and Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran met their makers.\n\nHere, a variety of figures who witnessed and participated in the British Invasion in the Beatles‚Äô wake‚Äîmusicians, managers, industry folk‚Äîrecount the era as they experienced it, from its arrival in the form of ‚ÄúI Want to Hold Your Hand‚Äù to its d√©nouement in the hairier, heavier year of 1967, by which time American bands had begun to redress the imbalance, and the pheromonal hysteria had worn off.\n\nBritain‚Äôs postwar era, the formative period of the future invaders, was marked by an unbridled, condescension-free love of America that hadn‚Äôt been witnessed before and hasn‚Äôt been witnessed since. To British youth of this time, America was the antithesis of their rain-sodden existence‚Äîa promised land of big Cadillacs, rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll, authentic Negro bluesmen, Brando and Dean delinquent pics, and muscular Burt Lancaster movies.\n\nANDREW LOOG OLDHAM, MANAGER, THE ROLLING STONES: You sucked up America as energy, to get you out of the cold, gray, drab streets of London. Before global warming, I doubt that England had more than three sunny weeks a year. Which is one of the reasons that England fell in love with the Beach Boys, to a certain degree, more than America did.\n\nIAN WHITCOMB, SINGER: I think history shows that it rained a tremendous amount in Britain in those days, much more than it does now. And there were no sweets; they were rationed. World War II didn‚Äôt end in Britain until about 1955, because that‚Äôs when rationing stopped. And everybody in Britain looked pale and ugly and flaccid, whereas Americans, at least on the screen and in the pictures in magazines that we got, looked in great shape.\n\nPETER NOONE, HERMAN‚ÄôS HERMITS: I grew up thinking that all American music was good and all English music was crap. I was a Yankophile. All the TV shows I liked were American‚Äîyou know, [the sitcom] Sergeant Bilko and so on. You have to imagine that these poor English guys were living in miserable, provincial, rainy, dreary cities, and saw posters with James Dean standing in the boots and the jeans and the T-shirt, with the cigarettes rolled up in the sleeve. I mean, if you look at Keith Richards, he still dresses like James Dean in that movie.\n\n__RAY PHILLIPS, NASHVILLE TEENS:__I grew up in Surrey. We used to do a song by the Everly Brothers called ‚ÄúNashville Blues,‚Äù and we were all teenagers, so we called ourselves Nashville Teens.\n\n__ERIC BURDON, THE ANIMALS:__I remember flipping through the pages of this jazz magazine with John Steel, the original drummer with the Animals, in art school. We came across this photograph of a bass player walking past the Flatiron Building after an all-night session in New York City, carrying his bass. We turned around and said, ‚ÄúYeah! We‚Äôre gonna go to New York, and we‚Äôre gonna be junkies!‚Äù\n\nFor all its allure, though, America was, prior to 1964, thought to be impregnable‚Äîmore a fantastical construct than a practical ambition.\n\nANDREW LOOG OLDHAM: America was not even a possibility for anybody before the Beatles. As a place to practice your business, it wasn‚Äôt even a consideration. Before the Beatles, what were the possibilities? Scandinavia, maybe. The toilets of Belgium‚Äîthe way the Beatles had done Hamburg. France for holidays. Even the French stars, they used to say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre touring America‚Äù . . . really, they were shopping. You know, they might play Canada, but America wasn‚Äôt open to them.\n\nPETULA CLARK, SINGER: It was all one-way traffic. For instance, the London Palladium‚Äîmost of the big stars were American. Danny Kaye and Johnnie Ray and Frankie Laine, those sort of people. Everything was coming from America.\n\nPETER ASHER, PETER AND GORDON: The big thing was, Cliff Richard had never made it in America. He‚Äôs so huge to us. He was our Elvis, our idol. Him not making it in America made it look impossible.\n\nTrue enough‚ÄîAmerica just couldn‚Äôt be bothered with English acts, including, as late as the end of 1963, the Beatles, who were already huge stars in the U.K. and on the European mainland. In autumn of that year, the famous disc jockey Bruce Morrow, a.k.a. Cousin Brucie, joined several other D.J.‚Äôs and executives at his station, WABC New York, to listen to a test pressing of ‚ÄúI Want to Hold Your Hand.‚Äù\n\nBRUCE MORROW: All the geniuses got together, including this one here. The first time we heard the record, all of us gave it the thumbs-down. I think most of us had the feeling of ‚ÄúHow dare these Brits, these upstarts, take the American idiom of rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll and do what they did to it?‚Äù I think it took over three meetings for us to realize that there was something more to this than protecting the American rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll industry and community. We started reading what was going on all over the Continent and we figured, ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôd better give this a listen again.‚Äù\n\nWhen ‚ÄúI Want to Hold Your Hand‚Äù finally made the American playlists, its shocking success abruptly changed the game for everyone in American music. Kim Fowley, a promising young Los Angeles record producer with a No. 1 hit to his credit (the Hollywood Argyles‚Äô ‚ÄúAlley-Oop‚Äù), was riding high in January of ‚Äô64 with another of his productions, the Murmaids‚Äô ‚ÄúPopsicles and Icicles,‚Äù when reality walloped him.\n\nKIM FOWLEY: There were three trade papers in those days, Billboard and Cashbox‚Äîwe were No. 3 in both‚Äîand the Murmaids were No. 1 in the third one, Record World. All of a sudden, ‚ÄúI Want to Hold Your Hand‚Äù comes along, and I was No. 1 no more. From, let‚Äôs say, February 6, which was when my record ceased to be No. 1, up to May, the only American hits were ‚ÄúHello, Dolly!,‚Äù by Louis Armstrong, ‚ÄúDawn,‚Äù by the Four Seasons, and ‚ÄúSuspicion,‚Äù by Terry Stafford. That was it‚Äîthose were the only three records that got in the first five months of the year. Everything else was British.\n\nFRANKIE VALLI, THE FOUR SEASONS: At the beginning of our career, we had ‚ÄúSherry,‚Äù ‚ÄúBig Girls Don‚Äôt Cry,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWalk Like a Man‚Äù‚Äîall No. 1s, one right after the other. And then came ‚ÄúDawn,‚Äù and it was No. 3. It was a big letdown.\n\nBRUCE MORROW: The Four Seasons and the Beach Boys did O.K. and carried the American flag for a few years, but the solo artists had a very rough time. I‚Äôm talking, like, Neil Sedaka and Chubby Checker. Because, suddenly, everybody was putting their money and attention and production values behind the British groups. Suddenly there was a flood of British groups‚Äîa flood.\n\nKIM FOWLEY: America just laid there, spread its legs, and said, ‚ÄúCome on in, guys. Come over and violate us with your Englishness.‚Äù Everybody suddenly wanted an English band, an English song, or something that could be sold or classified or categorized or manipulated into that area.\n\nIndeed, as the winter of ‚Äô64 progressed into spring and summer, the American charts were inundated with British product‚Äînot just the Beatles‚Äô hastily issued ‚Äô62‚Äì‚Äô63 back catalogue (‚ÄúShe Loves You,‚Äù ‚ÄúLove Me Do,‚Äù ‚ÄúTwist and Shout,‚Äù ‚ÄúDo You Want to Know a Secret,‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease Please Me‚Äù), but singles by the Dave Clark Five, Gerry and the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Chad and Jeremy, Dusty Springfield, Cilla Black, the Animals, the Kinks, the Searchers, and Manfred Mann. With all these chart-storming acts came an attendant, and often ridiculous, American Anglophilia.\n\nBRUCE MORROW: Kids would call me for dedications and talk to me with British accents. Some kid from the Bronx would all of a sudden speak the King‚Äôs English: ‚Äú‚ÄôEllo? Sir Brucie, this is Sir Ivan . . . ‚Äù Literally, they gave themselves knight titles.\n\nMARK LINDSAY, PAUL REVERE AND THE RAIDERS: I learned to speak with an English accent, or my best facsimile, as soon as I could. Because I found out that‚Äôs what chicks wanted. They didn‚Äôt care about the American guys. They were looking for the Brits.\n\nOf all the early Invasion acts, the Dave Clark Five, from the dismal North London neighborhood of Tottenham, were the most serious challengers to the Beatles‚Äô supremacy‚Äîfar more serious, initially, than the Rolling Stones, who were still playing blues and R&B covers on the U.K. circuit.\n\nANDREW LOOG OLDHAM: It should be remembered that the Dave Clark Five were the next God for more than a few minutes. In March and April of 1964, with ‚ÄúGlad All Over‚Äù and ‚ÄúBits and Pieces,‚Äù they hit the U.S. Top 10 twice. ‚ÄúGlad All Over‚Äù? The Stones and I thought it was sad all over. London was as big as the world in those days, very territorial, and Dave Clark came from no-man‚Äôs-land, according to our New Wave elitism. But we did not laugh at his business acumen and ability to get it right in America.\n\nSIMON NAPIER-BELL, MANAGER, THE YARDBIRDS: I have more respect for Dave Clark than anyone else in the whole business. If you were hanging around the fringes of show business in those days, you were obviously thinking, Hey, I‚Äôd like to be the Beatles‚Äô manager. And since you couldn‚Äôt, you had to find another Beatles for yourself. Dave Clark was the best of all‚Äîhe said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to be the Beatles‚Äô manager. I think I‚Äôd like to be the Beatles too.‚Äù\n\nDAVE CLARK: When people talk about my business acumen, I have to laugh. I left school when I was 15. My dad worked for the post office. Looking back, I think I was just streetwise.\n\nClark, the band‚Äôs drummer and chief songwriter, was a preternaturally driven young jock, aspiring actor, and stuntman who had first organized his band to finance his youth soccer club‚Äôs trip to Holland for a tournament (which they won). He also managed the band and produced its records, securing a royalty rate exponentially higher than the Beatles‚Äô and becoming a millionaire at 21. Clark attracted Ed Sullivan‚Äôs attention when ‚ÄúGlad All Over,‚Äù a No. 1 hit in the U.K., started climbing the U.S. charts, portending another Brit sensation.\n\nDAVE CLARK: When Ed Sullivan first asked us to do his show, we were still semi-professional‚Äîthe boys still had day jobs‚Äîand I said we wouldn‚Äôt go professional until we had two records in the top five. This was before ‚ÄúBits and Pieces.‚Äù I turned him down, but then he offered us an incredible amount of money, so we came over. We did the show, and Sullivan liked us so much he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm holding you over for next week.‚Äù But we were already booked in England for a sold-out show. I said we couldn‚Äôt do it. So he called me up to his office and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy the show out.‚Äù\n\nFor some reason, without thinking, I said, ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt think I can stay in New York for the whole week.‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúWhere do you want to go?‚Äù Well, on the way in from the airport, they had these billboards out, and one of them said, ‚ÄúMontego Bay, Island Paradise.‚Äù So I said to him, ‚ÄúMontego Bay‚Äù‚ÄîI‚Äôd never heard of it! And so we went to Montego Bay just for the week, all expenses paid. Went on the Monday and came back on the Friday, and there were 30,000 or 35,000 people waiting at the airport.\n\nBy that May, we were touring America, every show sold out, in our own private plane, which we leased from the Rockefellers. It had ‚ÄúDC5‚Äù painted on the nose. I just said, ‚ÄúIf we are going to do it, let‚Äôs do it in style.‚Äù\n\nThe Dave Clark Five‚Äôs tour was the first by an Invasion band, pre-dating even the Beatles‚Äô first tour proper. With an innate grasp of the American marketplace and a gift for writing peppy, stadium-friendly stomp-alongs (the propulsive ‚ÄúBits and Pieces‚Äù virtually invented glam rock), Clark scored seven straight Top 20 singles in the U.S. in 1964, and four more in ‚Äô65. His band also sold out 12 straight concerts in Carnegie Hall and, over the course of the 1960s, made 18 appearances on Ed Sullivan, more than any other rock group.\n\nDAVE CLARK: We‚Äôd get hundreds of girls leaving us hundreds of dolls and gifts in every city. And one of the gifts was a sheep. I didn‚Äôt have the heart to send it anywhere, so I took it back to the hotel suite. And we came back after the show, and it had chewed every credit card, every piece of furniture‚Äîwe didn‚Äôt trash hotel suites, but the sheep did.\n\nBut whereas Ed Sullivan saw in Clark a nice, wholesome bandleader who appealed to kids and parents alike, some of Clark‚Äôs peers back in England saw hauteur and slick opportunism.\n\nDAVE DAVIES, THE KINKS: Dave Clark was a very shrewd guy, but he wasn‚Äôt particularly well liked. Because he wasn‚Äôt really a musician‚Äîhe was more of a businessman: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a band up like the Beatles and try to make a lot of money.‚Äù\n\nGRAHAM NASH, THE HOLLIES: We fuckin‚Äô hated the Dave Clark Five! They were just awful to us. They were snotty and they couldn‚Äôt play for shit. I mean, if you‚Äôre great, maybe you have the right to be a little stuck-up, but if you‚Äôre not great, fuck you and your attitude.\n\nBeyond the Dave Clark Five, the acts that broke early in the Invasion seemed to be those with Beatle associations, whether because they were fellow Liverpudlians, like the Searchers (‚ÄúNeedles and Pins,‚Äù ‚ÄúLove Potion No. 9‚Äù); fellow clients of manager Brian Epstein, like Gerry and the Pacemakers (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the Sun Catch You Crying,‚Äù ‚ÄúFerry Cross the Mersey‚Äù) and exCavern Club coat-check girl Cilla Black (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre My World‚Äù); recipients of John Lennon and Paul McCartney‚Äôs songwriting largesse, like Peter and Gordon (‚ÄúA World Without Love‚Äù); or all of the above, like Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas (‚ÄúLittle Children,‚Äù ‚ÄúBad to Me‚Äù).\n\n__BILLY J. KRAMER:__I came with Brian for a week in New York before the Beatles; I think he was negotiating with the Ed Sullivan Show people. I was totally intimidated. Brian said to me when we got off the plane, ‚ÄúWhat do you think of this place?‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúI think we should get the next plane back to England.‚Äù\n\n__GERRY MARSDEN, GERRY AND THE PACEMAKERS:__New York was brilliant! People used to say to me, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt it get on your nerves when they try and rip your clothes off?‚Äù And I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúNo, they paid for it‚Äîthey can have ‚Äôem. Just leave me underpants.‚Äù\n\nCILLA BLACK: I remember coming down Fifth Avenue, and I was wearing a Mary Quant black plastic mac. Some fans who had caught me on The Ed Sullivan Show wanted a souvenir, so they pulled a button off my mac. And of course it all ripped, and I was really upset. But they were still being friendly‚Äîthey just wanted a Beatle souvenir.\n\n__PETER ASHER:__Almost all our fans were also Beatle fans. By zeroing in on one of the subgroups of the Beatle phenomenon, the fans had more of a chance to actually get to meet the musicians, or to feel more personally involved. I remember one time, we finished a show and jumped off the stage in San Diego or somewhere. And as we did, the girls broke through some sort of barrier thing, chasing after us. My glasses fell off and fell to the ground. I picked ‚Äôem up and put ‚Äôem back on, and looked behind me. And a girl, where my glasses had fallen on the lawn, was pulling the grass out and stuffing it in her mouth. Something that had touched me had now touched this grass, and the grass had now become sacred. It was fascinating.\n\nOf these acts, Peter and Gordon were the odd ones out, not rough-hewn northerners but posh kids from London‚Äôs prestigious Westminster School who‚Äôd formed an Everly Brothers-style harmony duo. Their Beatle connection was that Paul McCartney was dating Peter Asher‚Äôs actress older sister, Jane. Lacking a permanent home in London at that time, McCartney had taken to bunking with the Ashers, a bourgeois-bohemian Jewish family, when the Beatles weren‚Äôt on tour.\n\n__PETER ASHER:__The top floor of our house had two bedrooms on it, which was him and me. So we were hanging out together a lot. One day‚ÄîI think Gordon was there, too‚ÄîPaul was fiddling about, playing a song, and I said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù And he said it was something he‚Äôd written for Billy J. Kramer, and that Billy J. didn‚Äôt like it, and that John didn‚Äôt want to do it with the Beatles. So I said, ‚ÄúWell, could we sing it?‚Äù\n\nThe song, ‚ÄúA World Without Love,‚Äù became Peter and Gordon‚Äôs debut single, and it went to No. 1 in America in June 1964, making them the first Englishmen after the Beatles to top the U.S. charts.\n\nBut even British acts with no Beatles connection whatsoever discovered, as they made their way to the United States in ‚Äô64 and ‚Äô65, that they were fab-by-association, no matter what their actual provenance.\n\nPETER ASHER: The funny part was that in America at that time ‚ÄúBeatle‚Äù almost became a generic term. People would actually come up to you and say, ‚ÄúAre you a Beatle?‚Äù Literally, middle-aged America at that time thought everyone with long hair and English was a Beatle.\n\nJEREMY CLYDE, CHAD AND JEREMY: All the time‚Äî‚ÄúAre you from Liverpool?‚Äù And our record company, since they didn‚Äôt have a band from Liverpool, dubbed us ‚Äúthe Oxford Sound,‚Äù because I had been brought up near Oxford at one point. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve heard the Liverpool Sound. Now‚Äîwait for it, kids!‚Äîit‚Äôs the Oxford Sound!‚Äù The Oxford Sound, thank God, didn‚Äôt last very long.\n\n__GORDON WALLER, PETER AND GORDON:__Americans just assumed that everyone from England was from Liverpool. But if they referred to us as ‚Äúthe Liverpool Sound,‚Äù I just went with the flow. If that made them happy and made the kids buy the records‚Äîsolid!\n\nOne band that did not instantly reap the benefits of hysterical Brit-mania was the Rolling Stones. By 1964 they had already developed a fierce live reputation, had hits in England (including the Lennon-McCartney-written ‚ÄúI Wanna Be Your Man‚Äù), and had appeared on the frenetic British teen-pop program Ready Steady Go! But establishing a U.S. foothold proved elusive.\n\n__VICKI WICKHAM, PRODUCER, READY STEADY GO!:__I remember sitting with Brian Jones and Mick Jagger at Wembley Stadium when we were doing Ready Steady Goes Mod, some extravaganza out there. We were sitting over a cup of tea, and I remember them saying, ‚ÄúIf only we could get a hit in America‚Äîwouldn‚Äôt it be great? We‚Äôd get a trip, we‚Äôd get to shop, we‚Äôd get to go there.‚Äù\n\nANDREW LOOG OLDHAM: All the people that we would laugh at while we were backstage at Ready Steady Go!‚ÄîDave Clark, Herman‚Äôs Hermits, the Animals‚Äîthey were having hits in America a long time before the Rolling Stones. Name anybody‚Äîeven [the unforgivably glutinous Irish vocal trio] the Bachelors got to No. 10.\n\nOldham, just 20 years old in 1964, had already made a name for himself in England by embarking on a whistle-stop apprenticeship tour of early Swinging London, working brief stints for the designer Mary Quant, the jazz-club impresario Ronnie Scott, and the Beatles‚Äô famous manager, Brian Epstein. The son of an American soldier who had been killed in World War II combat before Andrew was born and an Australian-born Englishwoman who concealed her Russian-Jewish background, Oldham gorged himself on American culture, became obsessed with Alexander Mackendrick‚Äôs quintessential New York film, The Sweet Smell of Success, and became one of Swinging London‚Äôs greatest self-inventions‚Äîan immaculately turned-out press manipulator who loved trouble, wore eyeliner, and, in Marianne Faithfull‚Äôs words, ‚Äúwould say things you only hear in movies, like I can make you a star, and that‚Äôs just for starters, baby!‚Äô‚Äù\n\nAt 19, Oldham took over the management of the Rollin‚Äô Stones (as they were then known), a nice group of middle-class blues enthusiasts from the suburbs of London, and masterfully recast them as mystique-laden bad boys‚Äîscruffing them up, encouraging them to unleash their delinquencies, and stoking the newspapers with his ‚ÄúWould you let your daughter marry a Stone?‚Äù campaign.\n\n__SIMON NAPIER-BELL:__What Mick Jagger did onstage subsequently was what Andrew did offstage. Andrew was camp and flamboyant and outrageous, and Mick stole Andrew‚Äôs movements and put them into a stage act.\n\nBut, for all his bravado in England and his romance with America, Oldham never anticipated that he would actually have to try to crack the States.\n\nANDREW LOOG OLDHAM: February ‚Äô64, when the Beatles came to America, it was a big ‚ÄúUh-oh‚Äù‚Äîno, a huge one. I was in a fuckin‚Äô panic, man. All of my gifts were of absolutely no use to me. This was a country where you killed your president. I mean, c‚Äômon, we‚Äôre turning up only six months after you‚Äôd popped Kennedy. That did have an effect on one.\n\nThe Stones arrived in the U.S. in June for a disastrous two-week tour that found them, at one juncture, playing four consecutive shows at the Texas State Fair in San Antonio.\n\nANDREW LOOG OLDHAM: Texas . . . [Sighs.] There was a swimming pool in front of us. With seals in it. Performing seals were on in the afternoon, in front of us. And Bobby Vee appearing in tennis shorts‚Äîforget the American Dream, now we‚Äôve got the American nightmare. The tour was only 15 dates, but it was a hard slog, a lot of disappointment. You know, if the Beatles‚Äô landing at J.F.K. was like something directed by Cecil B. DeMille, it looked as if Mel Brooks directed our entry.\n\nThe indignities piled on. Making their American TV debut on the ABC variety program The Hollywood Palace, the Stones were ritually abused by that week‚Äôs host, Dean Martin, who said of them, ‚ÄúTheir hair is not long‚Äîit‚Äôs just smaller foreheads and higher eyebrows.‚Äù\n\nOldham did manage one coup on the Stones‚Äô first trip, though, getting the group a recording session at Chess Studios in Chicago, where many of their blues idols had put down their most famous tracks.\n\n__ANDREW LOOG OLDHAM:__I could not have them going back to England with long faces. So, as a compensation, I organized a recording session at Chess, where they could basically record at the shrine. That got us as far as ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs All Over Now,‚Äù the Bobby Womack song . . .\n\n. . . the Stones‚Äô cover of which squeaked into the American Top 40 in late summer ‚Äô64, peaking at No. 26 in mid-September‚Äîjust as their nemesis, Martin, was enjoying his eighth week in the Top 10 with ‚ÄúEverybody Loves Somebody.‚Äù\n\nThe early Stones were hardly the only British group whose repertoire consisted almost entirely of covers of American R&B singles. For bands who were not writing their own material, it was crucial to have a good song picker. The Searchers, from Liverpool, had one of the best in drummer Chris Curtis.\n\nCHRIS CURTIS: At Brian Epstein‚Äôs family‚Äôs store, NEMS, you could ask him, and he‚Äôd get you anything you wanted. I listened to Radio Luxembourg virtually every night‚Äîthey used to do an American slot, and I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs good,‚Äù and order it at NEMS. ‚ÄúNeedles and Pins‚Äù‚ÄîI just heard Jackie DeShannon‚Äôs version on the radio, so I bought the record. ‚ÄúLove Potion No. 9‚Äù‚Äîwe were in Hamburg, and I used to go out on my own, looking in old shops. I found this old secondhand shop in the next road up from the Grosse Freiheit, which is where the Star Club was. I thought, That‚Äôs strange‚Äîwhat‚Äôs a 45 doing in the window? And it was the Clovers singing ‚ÄúLove Potion No. 9,‚Äù which became our biggest hit in America.\n\nManfred Mann‚Äôs song picker was its singer, the dreamy Paul Jones. The band, named after its bespectacled, Beatnik keyboardist, started out as a jazz combo but had little success. Enlisting Jones, they reconstituted themselves as an R&B outfit but still weren‚Äôt having much luck, prompting the singer to take them in a poppier direction.\n\nPAUL JONES: I would avidly listen to the very few programs on British radio where you could hear American popular music. And every time I heard something that I liked, I would go to one of the very few record shops in London you could rely on to stock that stuff. And I heard this ‚ÄúDo Wah Diddy,‚Äù by [the black New York vocal group] the Exciters, and I thought, It‚Äôs a smash!\n\n‚ÄúDo Wah Diddy Diddy‚Äù had been written by Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, one of the hit-making teams that worked in Manhattan‚Äôs fabled Brill Building. But the Exciters‚Äô version had done surprisingly little business in the U.S. Manfred Mann‚Äôs version, however, a future staple of sports-arena playlists, became another No. 1 for the British side in October of ‚Äô64.\n\nPAUL JONES: I wanted to get over to America as fast as possible. And when some guy said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a tour with Peter and Gordon,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go! Let‚Äôs go! Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù And it was dreadfully arranged, in the depths of winter ‚Äô64-‚Äô65. When we got to New York, we played at the New York Academy of Music, and ticket sales were very poor indeed. So they decided that it would be necessary, at the last minute, to beef up the bill with some local talent. And of all the blind-blank stupidities, the local talent that they booked was the Exciters, who then sang ‚ÄúDo Wah Diddy‚Äù before we did.\n\nManfred Mann‚Äôs tour wasn‚Äôt a total washout, though. While the band was in Los Angeles, the ubiquitous scenester Kim Fowley witnessed what he deems a seminal event in music history: the first official campaign by a groupie to bed a rock star.\n\nKIM FOWLEY: Her name was Liz, with red hair and green eyes; she looked like a Gidget version of Maureen O‚ÄôHara. She was about 18 years old. She was the first girl who I ever saw walk into a hotel room for the express purpose of fucking a rock star. I was standing in the driveway, between the Continental Hyatt House and Ciro‚Äôs. I had just gotten out of a cab, and I was gonna go over to the hotel and welcome the guys. Then her cab came up. I said, ‚ÄúHey, Liz, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúDo you know Paul Jones in Manfred Mann?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù And she said, ‚ÄúWell, I want to fuck him.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúReally? So what do you want me to do?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúI want you to drag me into their room and introduce me, so I can nail this guy.‚Äù\n\nSo we knock on the door, and they open the door, and I said, ‚ÄúPaul Jones, here‚Äôs your date for the evening.‚Äù ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Liz, I‚Äôm gonna have sex with you tonight!‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù\n\n__PAUL JONES:__If I said Kim was lying, I‚Äôd be lying, because I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs true or false. I seem to remember that at the time there were lots of girls that made a beeline for groups‚Äîespecially the singer. Look: the music was always the main thing for us. If I did get into debauchery, then I have to admit that girls were more likely to be the subject of it than drink. And drugs a poor third.\n\nThe greatest of England‚Äôs song pickers in the Invasion era was Mickie Most, a former pop singer of middling achievement who‚Äôd made himself over as a Svengali-like producer. Unique among London music figures, Most was jetting off to New York even before the Beatles‚Äô breakthrough, trawling the Brill Building music publishers for songs that he could turn into hits with the promising young groups he‚Äôd found, the Animals and Herman‚Äôs Hermits.\n\n__MICKIE MOST:__The previous generation of British pop artists, like Cliff Richard, Adam Faith, and Marty Wilde, were basically clones of the Americans, except that they didn‚Äôt have the ability to write. They used other people‚Äôs songs, normally covers of American records that had already been successful. So I designed a shortcut‚Äîgo to America, to the publishing companies, and get the songs before they were recorded. When I‚Äôd find a band like Herman‚Äôs Hermits‚ÄîI liked the band, but they didn‚Äôt have any tunes. So off I went to New York, and we found a song called ‚ÄúI‚Äôm into Something Good,‚Äù written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King. And the Animals, for instance‚Äîtheir first hit was ‚ÄúHouse of the Rising Sun,‚Äù which was an old folk song they were doing in their set; they weren‚Äôt writers. So ‚ÄúWe Gotta Get out of This Place,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let Me Be Misunderstood,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs My Life‚Äù‚Äîthose tunes were all American songs which had never been recorded.\n\nThe Animals, from Newcastle, were an earthy blues-R&B act fronted by Eric Burdon, a volatile, charismatic belter of small stature and serious intellect. Their slow, portentous version of ‚ÄúHouse of the Rising Sun‚Äù held the No. 1 spot for three weeks in September ‚Äô64, establishing them as rootsy heavyweights of the Invasion.\n\nERIC BURDON: I still resent being lumped in with the British Invasion. That‚Äôs just not the way I saw music‚Äîto have our management look around for chewing-gum commercials. We weren‚Äôt bubblegum. I was fuckin‚Äô serious about the blues. In one of my first journals, I made an incision into my arm and wrote the word ‚Äúblues‚Äù in blood. It was a crusade.\n\nHerman‚Äôs Hermits, on the other hand, were the perfect teen-dream band, acutely polite, unsubversively cheeky, and forever dressed for school-picture day. ‚ÄúHerman‚Äù was actually Peter Noone, a relentlessly chipper, well-to-do boy from the suburbs of Manchester who had been a child actor on the English soap opera Coronation Street. He was barely 17 when ‚ÄúI‚Äôm into Something Good‚Äù became an American hit in the fall of 1964.\n\n__PETER NOONE:__Herman‚Äôs Hermits were always very civil. Girls, guys, mums, and dads liked us, ‚Äôcause we were not in your face in any kind of way. You know how people say, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt let me sister see that‚Äù? That‚Äôs how we were. We all had a sister who was a little bit older than us or a little bit younger than us, and my sister had, like, a plastic statue of Sister Mary Teresa implanted in her forehead: ALL MEN, LEAVE ME ALONE. We thought all girls were like that. Until we found out that we had a shot at them.\n\nPrecocious and possessed of Clintonian energy and political skills, Noone proved adept at ingratiating himself to the appropriate American media figures.\n\nPETER NOONE: I made an alliance with Gloria Stavers, the editor of 16 magazine, because I knew that she was the most important person in rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll in America. She developed acts. If she liked what you represented‚Äîshe liked Paul McCartney; she liked John Lennon‚Äîshe made you look better. She would change your answers to make you look better . . .\n\n. . . e.g., Stavers: ‚ÄúWhat do you think of American girls?‚Äù Noone: ‚ÄúThey make me wish we still owned the colonies. That‚Äôs what America used to be, luv!‚Äù\n\nPETER NOONE: And Ed Sullivan was charmed by Herman‚Äôs Hermits because I was a bit brighter than the average musician. He said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Catholic, aren‚Äôt you? Meet me tomorrow at Delmonico‚Äôs‚Äù‚Äîwhich I thought was a restaurant; he meant the building‚Äî‚Äúand come with me and my family to Mass.‚Äù It was a big honor. I showed up, suited up and everything, and genuflected in all the wrong places; I hadn‚Äôt been for about 10 years.\n\nNoone‚Äôs politicking and Most‚Äôs production savvy paid off. erman‚Äôs Hermits commenced a streak of five straight Top 5 hits, including the No. 1s ‚ÄúMrs. Brown You‚Äôve Got a Lovely Daughter‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Henry VIII, I Am.‚Äù\n\n__WAYNE FONTANA, WAYNE FONTANA AND THE MINDBENDERS:__I‚Äôd say that at that time in America, in ‚Äô65, Peter was bigger than the Beatles.\n\nPETER NOONE: Mick Jagger didn‚Äôt like Herman‚Äôs Hermits. ‚ÄôCause people would ask was he Herman in those days.\n\n__ANDREW LOOG OLDHAM:__Mick was stopped in Honolulu Airport and asked for his autograph. And they were disappointed that he hadn‚Äôt signed ‚ÄúPeter Noone.‚Äù The look on his face! But we took Peter Noone and Mickie Most very seriously, and so did other folk. They and the Dave Clark Five, after the Beatles, took the heart of America way before the Stones. They toured on hits, we went looking for them.\n\n__PETER NOONE:__There was a time when we were all staying at the City Squire hotel in New York‚Äîus, the Stones, and Tom Jones. Herman‚Äôs Hermits had just done ‚ÄúHenry the VIII‚Äù on The Ed Sullivan Show, and there were two or three thousand kids standing outside the hotel for us‚Äîit had been on the news. We went up on the roof‚Äîthe Stones and Tom Jones too‚Äîand it must have made a big impact on the Stones, because they started to write pop tunes. No more of the blues stuff, ‚ÄúLittle Red Rooster‚Äù‚Äîthat was instantly gone. They went to start and write songs, ‚Äôcause they said, ‚ÄúLook what happens when you make it in America.‚Äù\n\nAs ‚Äô64 turned into ‚Äô65, the Invasion grew ever more literal, with British groups coming over in great numbers for package tours, New York variety showcases hosted by D.J. Murray ‚Äúthe K‚Äù Kaufman, and appearances on the various manic television programs that had arisen to cater to the hysterical-teen demographic: NBC‚Äôs Hullabaloo, ABC‚Äôs Shindig! and Where the Action Is, and the syndicated Hollywood A Go Go. Among the groups to visit were the Kinks, whose Ray Davies-written originals ‚ÄúYou Really Got Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll Day and All of the Night‚Äù were all over the radio; the Zombies, whose extraordinary debut single, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Not There,‚Äù was the first self-written British No. 1 after the Beatles; the Yardbirds, who came to America with a new featured guitarist, Jeff Beck, because the old one, blues purist Eric Clapton, found the band‚Äôs hit ‚ÄúFor Your Love‚Äù inexcusably poppy; the Hollies, who were having hits in England but who wouldn‚Äôt crack the U.S. Top 10 until ‚Äô66 and ‚Äô67 with ‚ÄúBus Stop‚Äù and ‚ÄúCarrie-Anne‚Äù; and lesser acts like Nashville Teens, yet another Mickie Most discovery, who had a hit with a cover of John D. Loudermilk‚Äôs ‚ÄúTobacco Road,‚Äù and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, who went to No. 1 with the soulful ‚ÄúThe Game of Love.‚Äù\n\nFor young Brits abroad for the first time, America was at once a wondrous land of untold exotica . . .\n\n__GRAHAM NASH:__Those little white grease pencils, where you don‚Äôt sharpen them, but you pull a little string and they sharpen themselves‚Äîincredible!\n\nWAYNE FONTANA: American diners were like top restaurants in London. Meat loaf, Boston cream pie, the steaks‚Äîincredible!\n\nRAY PHILLIPS, NASHVILLE TEENS: This little Jewish girl, she always used to bring a hot casserole along to the dressing room in the Brooklyn Fox. It was stuffed peppers. Which I guess must be a Jewish thing.\n\n. . . and a place that was, surprisingly, still very much in thrall to 1950s mores and tastes.\n\nDAVE DAVIES: On our first tour, I was surprised how old-fashioned Americans were. Ray and I grew up listening to Big Bill Broonzy and Hank Williams and the Ventures, all these really cool people. So before I went, I was in awe of America, thinking, We‚Äôre gonna go places where all these great people are, and we‚Äôre gonna listen to the radio and hear all this great music! And they didn‚Äôt play anything on the radio that was any good; it was all that poppy, croonery, 50s kind of stuff. I expected to hear Leadbelly on the radio‚Äîno one knew who he was!\n\n__ERIC BURDON:__We were put in a Christmas special called The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood, with Liza Minnelli as Little Red Riding Hood, Vic Damone as the romantic lead, and Cyril Richard as the Big Bad Wolf. We were his Wolfettes. We‚Äôd walk around with this bloody makeup on and tails, and we had to sing a song called ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Gonna How-How-Howl Tonight.‚Äù\n\nROD ARGENT, THE ZOMBIES: We did the Murray the K Christmas Show at the Brooklyn Fox. It was Ben E. King and the Drifters, the Shangri-Las, Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles, Dick and Deedee, and another English band, Nashville Teens. Headlining the show was Chuck Jackson. We started at 8 o‚Äôclock in the morning and did six or eight shows a day, until about 11 o‚Äôclock in the evening. Each act did a couple of songs‚Äîour hit and one other song‚Äîand then we would have to go to the back of the stage and sort of dance, almost like a very naff chorus line.\n\nBut, for all the bands who were chagrined at having to go the cornball route, there were those who embraced the opportunity.\n\nGERRY MARSDEN: On Hullabaloo, I think I was in a hairdresser‚Äôs chair, singing ‚ÄúI Like It‚Äù while surrounded by a bevy of beauties. I found it great‚Äîbloody hell, to be on television in America, I would have shown me bum to get on!\n\nChad and Jeremy, a harmony duo whose mellow, Kingston Trio-like sound on such hits as ‚ÄúA Summer Song‚Äù and ‚ÄúWillow Weep for Me‚Äù was as far away as could be from that of the Rolling Stones, were so Old Guard-friendly that they actually lived with Dean Martin for a short time.\n\nJEREMY CLYDE: We were brought over to do the Hollywood Palace show as a sort of antidote to Ed Sullivan‚Äî‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs got the Beatles, so we‚Äôll get Chad and Jeremy!‚Äù My parents knew Jeannie Martin, so we stayed with Dean and Jeannie and hung out with Dino, Deana, and Claudia. The house revolved around this great big wet bar.\n\nClyde was the Invasion‚Äôs one authentic English aristocrat, the grandson of the Duke of Wellington. Between his august lineage and his and Chad Stuart‚Äôs drama-school backgrounds, Hollywood could not keep its hands off the pair. They could sing; they could act; they had English accents; they had mop-top hair‚Äîthey were TV-land‚Äôs official Invasion mascots.\n\nJEREMY CLYDE: We were on Batman and Patty Duke and The Dick Van Dyke Show. On Dick Van Dyke, we played a British band, and Rob and Laura Petrie kept them in their house for three days‚Äîactually, not unlike Dean and Jeannie Martin. On Batman, we did a double episode. We played ourselves, Chad and Jeremy. Catwoman stole our voices‚ÄîJulie Newmar, who was gorgeous. As I remember, because Catwoman had stolen our voices, the amount of tax that Chad and Jeremy were paying to the British Exchequer would then be lost, and Britain would collapse as a world power. It was a Beatle joke, obviously.\n\nLike Chad and Jeremy, Freddie and the Dreamers were a clean-cut English group who, through the magic of American television and the sheer force of the Invasion, became much bigger in the U.S. than they were in their homeland. Freddie Garrity, a 26-year-old who‚Äôd shaved five years off his age to appear more youthquake-friendly, was an impish little fellow in Buddy Holly glasses whose trademark was a spasmodic leg-flailing dance that came to be known as the Freddie.\n\nFREDDIE GARRITY: We were really just a cabaret act. The Freddie dance was just an old routine‚Äîit depicted a farmer in a field kicking his feet out in the mud.\n\nFreddie and the Dreamers‚Äô chart placings were already in decline in England when, in 1965, Brian Epstein, moonlighting as the host of Hullabaloo‚Äôs London segment, showed a clip of the group performing its 1963 U.K. hit ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Telling You Now.‚Äù The clip proved so popular that the group was invited to Los Angeles to perform live on Hullabaloo*.*\n\n__FREDDIE GARRITY:__So we went on, did ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Telling You Now,‚Äù and the phones lit up. Policemen were doing the Freddie in the street. And the song shot to No. 1 in America . . .\n\n. . . which it hadn‚Äôt done even in Britain. Freddie-mania took such hold in America that Garrity‚Äôs record company hastily put together a follow-up single called ‚ÄúDo the Freddie‚Äù for him to sing (it reached No. 18), and on Hullabaloo such luminaries as Chuck Berry, the Four Seasons, Trini Lopez, Frankie Avalon, and Annette Funicello joined Garrity in doing the dance. Freddie and the Dreamers also embarked on a U.S. tour with two fellow Manchester bands, Herman‚Äôs Hermits and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders.\n\n__WAYNE FONTANA:__We had No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 on the chart throughout the tour. One week I was No. 1 with ‚ÄúGame of Love,‚Äù then Freddie and the Dreamers, then Herman. It was amazing, because we‚Äôd all grown up together.\n\nAnother young Englishman unwittingly caught up in the slipstream of the Invasion was Ian Whitcomb, a wellborn boy who, while attending Trinity College in Dublin, had started up a band called Bluesville and secured a modest recording contract with Tower, a small subsidiary of Capitol Records. At the end of a Dublin recording session in which he‚Äôd committed to tape a protest song called ‚ÄúNo Tears for Johnny,‚Äù he and his band played a boogie-woogie joke song they‚Äôd made up in which Whitcomb panted like a phone pervert and sang, in falsetto, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon now honey, you know you really turn me on.‚Äù\n\nIAN WHITCOMB: I was brought across to New York in spring of ‚Äô65 by Tower Records. And, to my horror, the promotion man had a copy of the next release of mine, and it was called ‚ÄúTurn On Song.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna release this! It‚Äôs No Tears for Johnny‚Äô! I‚Äôm gonna be the next Dylan!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou Turn Me On (Turn On Song),‚Äù as it was officially billed by Tower, somehow made it all the way to No. 8 in the U.S.\n\nIAN WHITCOMB: I was so embarrassed by this damn thing, because I thought I was a singer and rhythm-and-blues man. And here I was with this novelty hit, and I couldn‚Äôt stop this damn thing from going up the charts. It‚Äôs still an albatross around my neck. When I was on tour with Peter and Gordon in late ‚Äô65, Peter said, ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôve made one of the worst records that‚Äôs ever been. Just as pop is progressing, just as we‚Äôre getting into serious art with the Beatles and we‚Äôre trying to elevate rock into a serious art form, you come along with this rubbish.‚Äù\n\nConveniently, the British Invasion dovetailed with the sexual revolution, which made for plenty of post-show action for visiting English musicians.\n\n__GORDON WALLER:__It was all too easy, frighteningly easy. I bumped into a woman a couple of years ago who still had a youthful figure and a great-looking face, and she said, ‚ÄúAre you Gordon?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Cathy. You took me to Vegas when I was 15.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúCathy, I think we‚Äôll rephrase that. We were playing in Vegas, and you happened along.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúYes, happened along‚Äîin your bedroom.‚Äù These days, damn, you‚Äôd be banged up, wouldn‚Äôt you?\n\nPETER NOONE: I thought I was in love with every girl, and I was gonna get married. I never, ever took advantage of anybody. I didn‚Äôt know that they were groupies. I thought, What a nice girl! She likes me!\n\n__FREDDIE GARRITY:__It was difficult. I had a wife and a baby daughter. And all of a sudden you‚Äôve got girls coming out of your ears! And, you know, I didn‚Äôt want to go deaf.\n\nWAYNE FONTANA: Oh, Freddie was the worst! Even though he was the funny one that jumped around‚Äîoh, what a lech! The group joined in‚Äîthey hired film cameras and everything, so they could set movie scenes up in bedrooms.\n\nAmong the most famous of the early rock groupies was Cynthia Albritton, a shy Chicago teen who, for reasons she barely understood, found herself suddenly impelled to storm the hotels where visiting British musicians were staying. In time, she would make a name for herself, literally, as the groupie who made plaster casts of rock stars‚Äô erect penises‚Äîshe became Cynthia Plaster Caster.\n\nCYNTHIA PLASTER CASTER: I‚Äôd say the British Invasion made me what I am. It was the hysteria of Meet the Beatles that evolved into plaster-casting. When it happened, a lot of us were virgins. We would climb fire escapes‚Äîlike 15, 20 stories‚Äîto get to the rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll floor, because the hotel security guards just didn‚Äôt allow girls in. They didn‚Äôt think it was proper.\n\nPETER ASHER: The funny part was, a lot of the girls were really young. They‚Äôd be trying to sneak into the hotel room, but they would have no idea what to do if they got there. They would be horrified if you really said, ‚ÄúWell, O.K. now‚Äîtake ‚Äôem off!‚Äù\n\nCYNTHIA PLASTER CASTER: I didn‚Äôt know what my goal was. I didn‚Äôt even know why I was drawn there. The guys were like magnets, and I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted at first. ‚ÄôCause I‚Äôd only made out with a boy or two before that.\n\nIn time, though, Cynthia and her friends embraced overt naughtiness.\n\n__CYNTHIA PLASTER CASTER:__We discovered along the way this Cockney rhyming slang that only British bands seemed to know. So we learned all the dirty words that we could find out. Such as ‚ÄúHampton wick,‚Äù which rhymes with ‚Äúdick,‚Äù and ‚Äúcharva,‚Äù which meant ‚Äúfuck.‚Äù I‚Äôm guessing it rhymed with ‚Äúlarva.‚Äù Maybe larva‚Äôs a sexual term, I don‚Äôt know‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt go as far as telling me what it rhymes with. But it was a very popular word; we made a lot of contacts from that word. We actually wrote a note to somebody saying that we were the Charva Chapter of the Barclays bankers. And ‚ÄúBarclays Bank‚Äù rhymes with ‚Äúwank‚Äù: ‚ÄúWould you like to make a deposit? Would you like to make a nightly deposit? We have nightly banking hours‚Äù‚Äîthat was it. This was for somebody in Gerry and the Pacemakers. And we didn‚Äôt even know what a wank was. We were still virgins.\n\nThe end result was that two days later I got a long-distance phone call from the guy. And it transpired into him finding out very quickly that I didn‚Äôt know what the fuck I was talking about.\n\nThe plaster-casting idea arose from Cynthia‚Äôs and her friends‚Äô desire, having given the matter some consideration, to lose their virginity to British pop stars. Nervous about how to break the ice, Cynthia and company decided that asking musicians to submit to having their members coated in a viscous molding agent was the way to go.\n\n__ERIC BURDON:__I was fascinated by the whole thing. They had a team, and one of them was a real expert at fellatio, and she was beautiful. They came with a wooden box and showed us all the equipment and everything.\n\nThe problem was that, initially, Cynthia was not well schooled in the art of molding.\n\n__CYNTHIA PLASTER CASTER:__There was, like, a two-year period where we were dragging the [casting-equipment] suitcase around, not really knowing how to do it, just wanting to try it out, using it as shtick to get to the hotel rooms. We‚Äôd tell people, ‚ÄúWe need someone to experiment on. Would you like to help us experiment?‚Äù We‚Äôd get the pants down, and then, ultimately, they would put the make on us, and voil√†‚Äîsex would happen. I think we encountered Eric Burdon during that time period. We were on an airplane with him, and we were gonna try aluminum foil, wrap it around his dick. That proved not to work.\n\nERIC BURDON: It was on a tour plane, and the engines were already running. And they had me in the bathroom, and everybody was yelling, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon‚Äîwe gotta leave!‚Äù And the plane was rocking backwards and forwards. They got as far as getting the plaster on. It wasn‚Äôt very comfortable, you know. I‚Äôm a romantic character‚ÄîI have to have candles, music, and a bottle of wine.\n\nThe British Invasion also ushered in a new kind of sex symbol‚Äînot the Brylcreemed, conventionally handsome pop idol of yore, but the skinny, spotty, often myopic, often dentally deficient Englishman whose magnetism derived from his Englishness and status as a musician.\n\nCYNTHIA PLASTER CASTER: Peter Asher was so cute. Him and that guy from Herman‚Äôs Hermits, Lek? [Derek ‚ÄúLek‚Äù Leckenby, the group‚Äôs bassist.] They wore those Peter Sellers glasses. I thought that was really hot.\n\nPETER ASHER: I had pretty substantially crossed teeth. I think the clich√© of the glasses and the bad teeth‚ÄîI know that I contributed something to Austin Powers‚Äôs reality. People have said to me, ‚ÄúIt must have been you who inspired Mike Myers.‚Äù And while he won‚Äôt say that, he did say, in the one conversation we had, that he knew all about Peter and Gordon. Unfortunately, I was never that shagadelic.\n\nFor all the fun that touring America entailed, there were some rocky moments for the invaders. Some were merely tempests in a teapot . . .\n\n__JEREMY CLYDE:__It was difficult when you were working with American musicians, ‚Äôcause they were resentful. Len Barry, who we toured with, had a hit called ‚Äú1-2-3,‚Äù and he had quite a chip on his shoulder‚Äî‚ÄúEnglish musicians don‚Äôt have the chops,‚Äù all this kind of stuff. And Paul Revere and the Raiders were there to bring American music back to America.\n\n__MARK LINDSAY, PAUL REVERE AND THE RAIDERS:__Actually, Derek Taylor, who was the Beatles‚Äô publicist, split from them kind of early on and came to America, and we were one of his first clients, and he said, ‚ÄúThis is a publicist‚Äôs dream‚Äîthe Americans stem the tide for the second time!‚Äù There was never any animosity or real competition. As far as the Brits, I was going, ‚ÄúYeah, more power to ‚Äôem!‚Äù\n\n. . . while others were more serious.\n\nJIM MCCARTY, THE YARDBIRDS: Giorgio Gomelsky, our first manager, was a big guy with a beard who looked like Fidel Castro. And when we first came to America, there was still a lot of Communist paranoia going on, you know? And, of course, lots of people used to think he was Fidel Castro, and that all of us, with our long hair, were dropouts following him around. So we‚Äôd get people threatening to throw us out of town and beat us up.\n\nDAVE DAVIES: I said ‚Äúcunt‚Äù on the radio in Boston once. The D.J. was talking like the Beatles, so I called him a cunt on the air. They closed the radio station down and dragged me out of the building.\n\nERIC BURDON: America was hotter than I expected it to be and colder than I ever imagined it would be, weatherwise and culturally. I went to the Stax Studio in Memphis one day and watched Sam and Dave cut ‚ÄúHold On! I‚Äôm a Comin‚Äô,‚Äù and the next night, in the limousines on the way to the gig, we ran into the Ku Klux Klan on the streets. So one minute you were like, ‚ÄúThis is the new South! This is the new dream!,‚Äù and then the next minute the old world would just come and slap you upside the head.\n\nBurdon did discover, serendipitously, that his affinity for black America had a secondary benefit.\n\n__ERIC BURDON:__I wanted to hear black music. Anywhere I went, I asked, ‚ÄúHow do I get across the tracks? How do I get to Browntown?‚Äù And I found out that all you had to do to get away from the screaming girls was drive across the tracks. They would follow us up to Harlem‚Äîflying wedges of cars, teenagers hanging out of cars‚Äîand as soon as we crossed 110th Street, they would peel off and fall back, and then I‚Äôd be alone.\n\nThere were fewer high jinks and groupie problems for the women of the British Invasion, a stylistically disparate group‚Äîthe soulful Dusty Springfield (‚ÄúWishin‚Äô and Hopin‚Äô‚Äù) and Cilla Black; the poppier Petula Clark (‚ÄúDowntown‚Äù) and Lulu (‚ÄúTo Sir with Love‚Äù); and the enigmatic Marianne Faithfull (‚ÄúAs Tears Go By‚Äù)‚Äîwhose one common trait was that they were all solo artists who couldn‚Äôt seek solace in the camaraderie of a group.\n\n__CILLA BLACK:__It was all right for the guys in any of the bands, because they all had each other. But I‚Äôd lost my grandmother while I was over in New York, and it really hit me badly. I was just too homesick, and I wanted to come home. Which I totally regret now.\n\nMore sure of herself was Petula Clark, who, at the time of her first U.S. smash, the winter ‚Äô65 No. 1 ‚ÄúDowntown,‚Äù was a trouper already in her third show-business incarnation‚Äîas a child she‚Äôd been an actress, England‚Äôs answer to Shirley Temple, and as a young woman she‚Äôd married a Frenchman, relocated to Paris, and had a second career as a French-singing chanteuse.\n\nPETULA CLARK: The first show I did live was The Ed Sullivan Show. I got there on the day of the show, which was unheard of. But I had a show in Paris on Saturday night, so I got there on Sunday just in time for the dress rehearsal, which was in front of a live audience. I was totally jet-lagged, no makeup, just enough time to throw on my funny little black dress, and they were playing my music‚Äîtoo fast, actually. I walked out onstage, my first time in front of an American audience, and before I‚Äôd sung a note, they stood up and cheered. It was extraordinary‚Äîthat was the moment that I realized what this British Invasion really meant. And then I remember waking up in the hotel and hearing ‚ÄúDowntown,‚Äù thinking, Am I dreaming this? It was the St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Parade going up Fifth Avenue‚Äîthe marching band was playing it.\n\nThe most beguiling of the Invasion gals was Marianne Faithfull, an aristocratic beauty who was just 17 when Andrew Loog Oldham discovered her at a London party in March of 1964, pronouncing her ‚Äúan angel with big tits.‚Äù By Christmastime of that year, her single ‚ÄúAs Tears Go By‚Äù had become the first original Mick JaggerKeith Richards composition to crack the American Top 40. Though she was at the epicenter of the Swinging London scene‚Äîfriends with Paul McCartney and Peter Asher, a visitor to Bob Dylan‚Äôs Savoy Hotel suite as chronicled in D. A. Pennebaker‚Äôs 1967 documentary, Don‚Äôt Look Back, affianced to bookstore and gallery owner John Dunbar‚ÄîFaithfull was reluctant to plunge headlong into America to capitalize on her success. She had her reasons.\n\nMARIANNE FAITHFULL: I was pregnant. So I got married to John Dunbar and had my baby. But, also, I was so young, I couldn‚Äôt quite get my head ‚Äôround going away to America for a long tour. A very sheltered little girl I was‚ÄîI honestly did think I would be eaten alive in America. I also knew about the Buddy Holly thing and the Big Bopper and all that stuff. So I couldn‚Äôt imagine touring America, and maybe I was right. I did do Shindig!, and it was very weird. I was really beautiful, right? And they covered me in makeup, and put false eyelashes on me, and made me look like a tart‚Äîa fucking dolly bird!\n\nStill, Faithfull‚Äôs success augured the beginning of better times for the Rolling Stones. The group had secured its first U.S. Top 10 hit late in ‚Äô64 with yet another R&B cover, of Irma Thomas‚Äôs ‚ÄúTime Is on My Side,‚Äù but Oldham had already realized that for the Stones to compete they would have to start writing their own material. After a tentative start, Jagger and Richards, egged on by their manager, finally hit their stride in 1965.\n\n__ANDREW LOOG OLDHAM:__That was a hell of a process for two people who basically thought I was mad, telling them that they could write. My stance, as I was not a musician, was based on the simplicity of ‚ÄúHey‚Äîif you can fuckin‚Äô play music, you can write it.‚Äù And they did. ‚ÄúThe Last Time‚Äù was the first time they got into the Top 10 [in May 1965] with a self-written song. And then the record after that was ‚ÄúSatisfaction‚Äù . . .\n\n. . . which was a No. 1 in the summer of ‚Äô65, to be followed by ‚ÄúGet off of My Cloud,‚Äù to be followed by ‚Äú19th Nervous Breakdown,‚Äù to be followed by ‚ÄúPaint It, Black,‚Äù and so on. The Rolling Stones were at last the Rolling Stones.\n\nAnother significant development of ‚Äô65 was the emergence of Invasion-inspired American bands. Back in ‚Äô64, the future members of the Byrds, all folkies, had bonded over their mutual love of the Beatles‚Äîa bold stance in the severe, smoky environs of hootenanny-land.\n\nCHRIS HILLMAN, THE BYRDS: I was a bluegrass mandolin player before I was in the Byrds, and I‚Äôd cross paths with David Crosby and Jim McGuinn, as Roger was then known, at this folk club in L.A., the Troubadour. So one night I‚Äôm down there with my bluegrass group to play open-mike night, and Jim McGuinn gets up. His hair is a little funnier, it‚Äôs starting to grow out, and he‚Äôs doing ‚ÄúI Want to Hold Your Hand‚Äù on an acoustic 12-string! And I‚Äôm going, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù\n\n__ROGER MCGUINN:__I was working for Bobby Darin in New York, working in the Brill Building as a songwriter, and he was a mentor to me. He said, ‚ÄúYou ought to get back into rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll,‚Äù because I was influenced by Elvis Presley originally. So I would go down to the Village and play these sort of souped-up folk songs with a Beatle beat. Then I got a gig at the Troubadour in California and did the same thing. Of course, it didn‚Äôt go over well‚Äîit was like Dylan at Newport. They were antagonistic, and I got the freeze, and they‚Äôd talk and talk over my set. Except [future Byrd] Gene Clark was in the audience and was a Beatles fan, and he liked what I was doing. So we decided to form a duo around that, and then Crosby came in a few days later.\n\n__DAVID CROSBY:__Roger and I and Gene Clark all went to see [the Beatles‚Äô 1964 movie] A Hard Day‚Äôs Night together. I was, like, spinning around the stop-sign poles, thinking I‚Äôd just seen my life‚Äôs work. We started growing our hair right away. We learned how to manipulate a dryer and a comb pretty quickly.\n\nOn the more plastique end of the Anglophilic spectrum was Gary Lewis, Jerry‚Äôs son, who was the drummer, singer, and leader of the beat combo Gary Lewis and the Playboys.\n\n__GARY LEWIS:__Hearing the Beatles inspired me to get the drums out of storage and put a band together from college students. My father was very supportive. He said, ‚ÄúSon, you‚Äôre doing great. Just give it a hundred percent and don‚Äôt ever grow your hair like those damn Beatles.‚Äù\n\nSoon enough, the Byrds were holding their own during the Invasion with their jingle-jangle No. 1s ‚ÄúMr. Tambourine Man‚Äù and ‚ÄúTurn! Turn! Turn!,‚Äù and Lewis was at No. 1 with the ersatz Merseybeat of ‚ÄúThis Diamond Ring.‚Äù\n\nThe English bands weren‚Äôt offended by their American imitators‚Äîfar from it. The Beatles and the Stones befriended the Byrds, while Peter Noone befriended Gary Lewis, toured with him, and found his Old Guard connections useful.\n\nPETER NOONE: We were in Kansas City with Gary Lewis and the Playboys, and Gary says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go up to see my dad‚Äôs friend, this guy who used to be president.‚Äù He meant Harry Truman, who was one of my heroes, just because he had big American balls. So I said, ‚ÄúCan I come with you?,‚Äù and off we went.\n\nMeeting one‚Äôs heroes was a big part of the American experience for Invasion acts, and the biggest hero of all was Elvis Presley‚Äîwho, though he‚Äôd been rendered pass√© by the Beatles and was then trapped in a grim career limbo of overbaked, sideburnless movie features, proved surprisingly sympathetic to English artists.\n\nPETER NOONE: Elvis was absolutely charming. I had to interview him for the BBC or something. It was the most ridiculous interview, because I didn‚Äôt prepare: ‚ÄúWhen are you coming to England? How did you make it without long hair?‚Äù The dumbest questions! But he was charmed, because I was so respectful. And he looked fucking unbelievable! I mean, if you were a woman, you would come.\n\n__ROD ARGENT, THE ZOMBIES:__When we were on tour, we got up one day and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to Graceland.‚Äù And we just walked through the gate. There was no security. We walked up the drive; we knocked on the door. And the guy that I remember being Elvis‚Äôs father, Vernon‚Äîbut some of the others remember it being his uncle‚Äîcame to the door. And we said, like little boys, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the Zombies from England! Is Elvis here?‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúWell, no, Elvis isn‚Äôt here. But he‚Äôll be really sorry to have missed you guys, because he loves you.‚Äù And we thought, He‚Äôs probably never heard of us and it‚Äôs bullshit, but it‚Äôs a very sweet thing for him to say. But I later found it out to be true.\n\nMeeting one‚Äôs black heroes, however, was more fraught with difficulties, especially given the British artists‚Äô obvious debt to American R&B. For Dusty Springfield, the prospect was downright nervous-making, as her best friend, Vicki Wickham, remembers.\n\n__VICKI WICKHAM:__When Dusty came over to America, there was a certain sense of ‚ÄúOh, shit‚Äîwhat if I meet Baby Washington, whose song I‚Äôve covered?‚Äù ‚ÄôCause she always thought the original was better than hers. She met Maxine Brown, who she‚Äôd also covered. She wouldn‚Äôt deal with it well, unfortunately. She‚Äôd shuffle a bit and then run away instead of having a conversation. And they, obviously, were in awe of her, because as far as they were concerned, she was the best English singer.\n\nERIC BURDON: The agent would say, ‚ÄúWell, boys, I got you on a Chuck Berry tour in the U.S. And guess what? You‚Äôre the fuckin‚Äô headliners.‚Äù What? We were headlining above these guys who I‚Äôd worshiped since I was 14. Chuck was really nice to me. I‚Äôve heard a lot about how nasty Chuck can be, and how difficult he can be to work with, but I showed some interest in his feelings, knew all his records, and told him that I thought he was America‚Äôs poet laureate. He was embarrassed, I think, but he was kind enough to take me to dinner, sit me down, and say, ‚ÄúLook‚Äîstay away from booze and drugs, you know, and keep your money in your sock.‚Äù\n\nWith Little Richard, though, there was a huge fight backstage at the Paramount Theater in New York between the manager of the Paramount and our publicist. Little Richard‚Äôs set kept going overtime, and they were going to slap him with a $10,000 fine, and he was just going off: ‚ÄúI am Little Richard, I am the king!‚Äù‚Äîemulating Cassius Clay. And there was this little black kid running around, toweling him down and trying to get him to cool down. And that turned out to be Jimi Hendrix.\n\nResolutely unimpressed by the Brit parade was Bob Dylan, who, though gracious enough a host to introduce both the Beatles and Marianne Faithfull to marijuana when they visited New York, was otherwise disdainful.\n\n__MARIANNE FAITHFULL:__I don‚Äôt think Bob‚Äôs ever thought much of the British Invasion. What I do know is how he treated people in London, all those who came to worship at the shrine. He felt that he was much, much, much, highly superior. I think he was really irritated that I wouldn‚Äôt run away with him to America, or whatever it was he wanted. And then I went off with bloody Mick Jagger! I can see what he means, quite frankly.\n\nBy 196667, there was a palpable shift under way in music, from pop to rock. The vestigial flourishes of 50s showbiz began to fall away, endangering the more clean-cut Invasion acts like Freddie and the Dreamers, Gerry and the Pacemakers, and Chad and Jeremy.\n\nJEREMY CLYDE: For us, I think it lasted about two years, ‚Äô64 to ‚Äô66, and then the girls stopped screaming. And we wanted them to stop screaming, because it was annoying, actually. Chad and I tried all kinds of things. We did a two-man show and took it ‚Äôround colleges‚Äîbits of drama, mime, and songs, very mixed-media. And then people started to re-invent popular music, and it all became very serious and, in quite a lot of cases, certainly ours, pretentious.\n\nThis should have been the moment for the Yardbirds, who, with their instrumental virtuosity and futuristic original compositions such as ‚ÄúShapes of Things‚Äù and ‚ÄúOver Under Sideways Down,‚Äù were poised for greatness. But they proved too volatile to last, as Simon Napier-Bell, who took over their management from Giorgio Gomelsky, found out.\n\n__SIMON NAPIER-BELL:__The Yardbirds were a miserable bunch. They were always arguing, bickering, and they weren‚Äôt fun.\n\nBefore the group‚Äôs 1966 U.S. tour, Paul Samwell-Smith, their bassist and driving musical force, quit. Jeff Beck recommended that they draft in his guitarist friend Jimmy Page on bass.\n\nSIMON NAPIER-BELL: After three days, Jimmy said, ‚ÄúI think I should play guitar.‚Äù And then [rhythm-guitarist] Chris Dreja had to play bass. It was sensational, but, of course, Jeff no longer was getting 100 percent of the credit for his own solos, ‚Äôcause he was playing them with Jimmy, and Jimmy wasn‚Äôt getting any credit, ‚Äôcause everybody knew they were Jeff‚Äôs solos. So both of them were pretty dissatisfied. You could see it was just gonna get sourer and sourer, and on the American tour Jeff just walked out.\n\nJIM MCCARTY: There was a bit of competition going on, ‚Äôcause they‚Äôd follow each other playing solos, and try and outdo each other, and maybe play at the same time. Sometimes it sounded good, but not very often. But I think Jeff just got stressed out. We were on this dreadful Dick Clark Caravan of Stars tour, and it was the totally wrong sort of thing for us‚ÄîGary Lewis and the Playboys, Sam the Sham, Brian Hyland, all these really straight American acts. We‚Äôd play in some of these little southern towns, and they‚Äôd shout, ‚ÄúTurn the guitars down, you‚Äôre too loud!‚Äù Jeff just blew his top, smashed his guitar up in the dressing room, and disappeared.\n\nAnother band to break on the later end of the Invasion, in 1967, was the Spencer Davis Group, whose Top 10 hits ‚ÄúGimme Some Lovin‚Äô‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Man‚Äù featured the uncannily blacksounding vocals of Steve Winwood, a white, 17-year-old Birmingham boy. The group, named after its founder-guitarist, had actually been knocking around for a while, with two U.K. No. 1s already to its credit.\n\n__SPENCER DAVIS:__We had a kind of cult status in America, with the young Winwood prodigy, Little Stevie‚Äîa name he hated with a passion. In respect to why we were late in having hits, we weren‚Äôt really a pop group. A lot of groups‚ÄîManfred Mann, Stones, Animals‚Äîweren‚Äôt pop, but went pop for a minute to have a hit and then went back to what they were doing. For us, the hits came when there was a better climate for rhythm and blues.\n\nThe only trouble was that the Spencer Davis Group, like the Yardbirds, couldn‚Äôt keep its hit-making lineup together.\n\n__SPENCER DAVIS:__We didn‚Äôt quite invade as a complete unit. When we recorded ‚ÄúGimme Some Lovin‚Äô,‚Äù the band was already splitting. Steve was going into Traffic with Dave Mason. We ended up going to New York in 1967 with a new singer, Eddie Hardin. Elton John had shown up as Reggie Dwight for the audition, wearing a milkman‚Äôs outfit, and we didn‚Äôt think that was cool.\n\nA lot of the Invasion groups were beginning to splinter or close up shop, either outpaced by musical currents or eager to try new styles with new colleagues. Eric Burdon organized a new lineup of the Animals. The Jeff Beck less Yardbirds carried on briefly before packing it in, prompting their remaining guitarist to form the New Yardbirds, soon to be known as Led Zeppelin. The increasingly psychedelicized Graham Nash was growing disenchanted with the Hollies and more interested in hanging out with his friends David Crosby from the Byrds and Stephen Stills from Buffalo Springfield.\n\n__GRAHAM NASH:__I realized that I was drifting far away from the Hollies. And then, when they didn‚Äôt want to do ‚ÄúMarrakesh Express‚Äù or ‚ÄúTeach Your Children,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù\n\n__GORDON WALLER:__The whole thing had been drained dry. The people who were left had run out of things to say musically, except for the Beatles and the Stones. And there were other people coming along, the Elton Johns of the world, the Who.\n\nFor London‚Äôs the Who, the tail end of the Invasion was just the beginning. In 1965 and ‚Äô66, they were already a massive success in England with their mod anthems ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Explain,‚Äù ‚ÄúMy Generation,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Kids Are Alright.‚Äù Their single ‚ÄúAnyway Anyhow Anywhere‚Äù had been adopted as Ready Steady Go!‚Äôs theme song, and their volcanic live act was thought to be the U.K.‚Äôs greatest. But they didn‚Äôt make so much as a dent in the American charts. Part of the reason for this was that their managers, Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, were film producers making their first foray into the music business.\n\n__CHRIS STAMP:__We signed in America with a company called Decca, which we thought was the same as the English Decca, which was the second-biggest label in England. In fact, American Decca was utterly unrelated, an old-fashioned label that released Bing Crosby, ‚ÄúWhite Christmas‚Äù sort of stuff. They were Sinatra guys‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt know rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll, didn‚Äôt even like it. Well, there was a natural outbreak of Who fans somewhere in Michigan with ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Explain,‚Äù and the next record was ‚ÄúAnyway Anyhow Anywhere.‚Äù And this company, Decca, sent it back to me, because they thought there was something wrong with the tape, because of the sounds the Who were making. We think of those songs now as pop, but, you know, they weren‚Äôt Herman‚Äôs Hermits. ‚ÄúMy Generation‚Äù had stutters in it; it had feedback.\n\nLambert and Stamp were desperate to break the Who in America, no matter what it took.\n\nVICKI WICKHAM: Kit was a total eccentric, very upperclass, very upper-crust. And we didn‚Äôt know till afterwards that he was selling the family silver, pawning the cuff links his dad had given him, to bankroll the Who. ‚ÄôCause they had no money.\n\nStamp, who was in charge of the Who‚Äôs American campaign, caught a break when his brother, the quintessential Swinging London actor Terence Stamp, was going off to the U.S. on a promotional junket.\n\n__CHRIS STAMP:__The first time I got over to New York, I got over because my brother had a premiere of a film called The Collector, and he was coming over to do Johnny Carson and promote the film. He exchanged his studio first-class ticket for two economyclass tickets, and I came over with him and stayed in his hotel for three days while he was doing all this stuff.\n\nStamp managed to make the acquaintance of promoter Frank Barsalona, whose firm, Premier Talent, had developed a reputation as the best of the booking agents for British groups. One of Barsalona‚Äôs star clients at the time, Mitch Ryder, was from Detroit, the one place where the Who had an American fan base. Ryder, an early champion of the Who, had gotten his big break in 1965 playing one of Murray the K‚Äôs 10-day multi-act shows, and in gratitude had promised to come back whenever Murray Kaufman beckoned.\n\n__FRANK BARSALONA:__Well, of course, a year and a half later, Mitch was really happening, and Murray, of course, wanted him to headline his Easter show. And Mitch called me and said, ‚ÄúFrank, that‚Äôs 10 days, five shows a day. I can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù\n\nBarsalona, in an effort to extricate Ryder from this situation, tried to sour Kaufman on Ryder by making a series of absurd demands, such as having Ryder‚Äôs dressing room done up entirely in blue, from the walls to the carpet to the curtains.\n\n__FRANK BARSALONA:__Murray kept saying yes to everything. So then the last thing I said was ‚ÄúLook, Mitch has this thing about this British act called the Who, and he would like them on the show.‚Äù Murray said, ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt mean anything.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúMurray, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. So why don‚Äôt we forget about Mitch?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to forget about Mitch!‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWell, then you have to put the Who up in the show.‚Äù\n\nIn such a fashion did the Who secure its first American engagement, as a support act, along with Eric Clapton‚Äôs new group, Cream, in Murray the K‚Äôs 1967 Easter show at the RKO 58th Street Theater in New York.\n\n__FRANK BARSALONA:__I had never seen the Who live, and I thought, Oh my God, I‚Äôm going to screw myself over! I went to the dress rehearsal with my wife, June, and I said, ‚ÄúYou know, June, they‚Äôre not bad at all.‚Äù And then Pete Townshend starts smashing his guitar to pieces, and Roger Daltrey is destroying the microphone, and Keith Moon is kicking over the drums. I said, ‚ÄúJune, do you think this is part of the act?‚Äù\n\n__CHRIS STAMP:__Murray the K was still doing these old-fashioned shows in Brooklyn where the act came on, sang their hit, and walked off. So we had to compromise‚Äîwe stretched it out, I think, to about four songs. The Who would come on; do, like, ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Explain‚Äù and some other song; and finish up with ‚ÄúMy Generation‚Äù and smash their equipment. Normally, the smashing came about of its own volition‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt meant to be a showbiz thing. But in the Murray the K thing, it tended to be slightly that. Although Pete was just as angry, I suppose, about having to do only four songs.\n\nNaturally, the Who stole the show, and their reputation grew to the point that by June of ‚Äô67 they were one of the major attractions of the Monterey Pop Festival in California, a three-day event that effectively brought down the curtain on chirpy, well-groomed, besuited 60s pop‚Äîand, therefore, the phenomenon known as the British Invasion. At Monterey, hair was longer, ‚ÄúMonterey Purple‚Äù acid was being taken, and such ascendant, hirsute San Francisco bands as the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Big Brother and the Holding Company were the stars. Eric Burdon played with his hippiefied new Animals, and Burdon‚Äôs friend Jimi Hendrix made his first major U.S. appearance, bringing down the house by setting fire to his guitar during his version of the Troggs‚Äô late-Invasion hit ‚ÄúWild Thing.‚Äù\n\nERIC BURDON: Monterey was probably the most important three or four days of my life. It was the apex of what was happening. I‚Äôd known Jimi from London, and we traveled across together with Brian Jones. And I saw him cut loose in America‚Äîit was his first opportunity to be Jimi Hendrix in front of an American audience.\n\nThough many Invasion acts moved in the late 60s and 70s to distance themselves from their scrubbed Shindig! images, most have since come around to accepting their identification with those days.\n\n__GRAHAM NASH:__You can‚Äôt change anything that‚Äôs already happened. And so you have to embrace it and say, ‚ÄúYou know, the Hollies weren‚Äôt too bad.‚Äù Would I have done it differently, knowing what I know? Possibly. But I choose to look back at it with fondness rather than look back at it and say, ‚ÄúBoy, was I fucked.‚Äù\n\nPAUL JONES: I find that, as time goes on, I‚Äôm just more and more associated with the 60s. I‚Äôm not getting further into the future; I‚Äôm getting further into the past. And I just think, Oh, man, accept it and just don‚Äôt worry. You know, I could have gone on to design motorcars, and I might have had some success; in the end, people would have said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs old Paul Do Wah Diddy‚Äô Jones.‚Äù You can‚Äôt get away from it.\n\nDAVE DAVIES: On my new album, Bug, there‚Äôs a song called ‚ÄúIt Ain‚Äôt Over, ‚ÄôTil It‚Äôs Done!‚Äù which is about the 60s. It‚Äôs saying, Maybe it‚Äôs not all finished yet. Maybe, rather than it always being a retro thing, all us crazy guys from the 60s are alive and well for a reason, and there‚Äôs still something we‚Äôve yet to say.\n\nAnd while the actual value of the Invasion‚Äôs music remains a subject of debate . . .\n\nMARIANNE FAITHFULL: I was a great friend of [the American arranger and producer] Jack Nitzsche, and from Jack I got a different perspective on the British Invasion‚Äîthat American music was on the verge of changing into something incredible. They were all working away‚Äîhim, Phil Spector, the Four Seasons, Brian Wilson. And the visions they had, what they were trying to do with American music, were completely fucked up by the British Invasion. Jack never really got that vicious about the Beatles and the Stones, but in the wake of those bands that were actually good‚Äîreal musicians with some kind of vision‚Äîcame all this other crap like Herman‚Äôs Hermits, the Dave Clark Five, et cetera. And I actually agree with him.\n\n. . . its social impact was indubitably huge.\n\n__PETER NOONE:__The bit that people are missing about the British Invasion is that it really was a much bigger deal than people think it was. Even though the newspapers keep going, ‚ÄúTwiggy!,‚Äù ‚ÄúBobbies on Bicycles!,‚Äù and all that. Because, before it, England was this quaint little country. It wasn‚Äôt considered a haven of brilliant musicians. Can you imagine what it‚Äôs done for the British economy? That all these songwriters are bringing all this money back into the economy? Britain is a new place‚Äîa new place.\n\n__DAVE CLARK:__When Britain started to do all this stuff, have all these bands, the gap between the countries was so great.In London you‚Äôd see these bombed-out blocks of flats, and there were restrictions and rations, and you didn‚Äôt always have the luxury of indoor plumbing.In America, we saw the possibilities.I‚Äôm still grateful to America‚Äîit really is beautiful. ‚ÄúAmerica the Beautiful‚Äù is my favorite American song. It really should be your national anthem."
