Here’s where they rank in the top 10\n\nCountry music tragedy: 2 deaths, one day and the brutal start to 2024\n\nCountry music stars who fans may not see again after 2024\n\nBruce Springsteen opens up about health battle, why he thought he might never sing again\n\nWhile it is a solo tour, Daltrey reportedly has plenty of surprises planned, and he won’t be all alone on stage. Among those reportedly slated to participate as special guests are Kt Tunstall and Dan Bern.\n\nAnd, for folks in Pa. who are interested in seeing the show, it will have a couple stops within relative driving distance. The tour will start on June 12 in Vienna, Virginia, and then Daltrey will play in Niagara Falls on June 14.\n\nHe also reportedly has stops planned for Bethel, Port Chester, Boston, Lenox, Detroit and Indianapolis before the tour wraps in Highland Park."
