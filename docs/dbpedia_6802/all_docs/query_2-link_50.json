        "text": "\"I hope I die before I get old\".\n\nIt's a lyric that has stuck to Roger Daltrey since the release of The Who's 1965 youth anthem 'My Generation', and in many ways has become an albatross around his neck.\n\nAs the band's career continued well into both his and fellow bandmate Pete Townshend's latter years, they went against their initial mod-inspired mantra and both 'got old'.\n\nBut as Daltrey nears his 80th birthday, he might not be swinging his famous microphone around on stage for much longer.\n\nAs the Teenage Cancer Trust lineup was announced recently for the 2024 series, it was also revealed that Roger will be stepping down from his position as curator.\n\nPete Townshend to discuss future of The Who with Roger Daltrey as they reach \"end of an era\"\n\nKeith Richards dismisses Led Zeppelin and The Who legends, calls them \"an absolute disaster\"\n\nThe Who's 15 greatest songs, ranked\n\nThe Who’s Pete Townshend reveals Roger Daltrey ‘hated’ his songs for new album\n\nFounding the benefit concert shows in 2000 alongside Dr Adrian Whiteson OBE and Myrna Whiteson MBE, the annual event takes place at London's historic venue the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nOver the years, he's convinced the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, Lulu, Van Morrison, composer Hans Zimmer, Sir Tom Jones, and more music icons to perform for the charity event.\n\nAfter dedicating a quarter of a century to the great cause, he's passing on the baton to new guest curators who will curate the lineup each year.\n\nTalking to the Metro, Daltrey has also admitted that he's nearly at the end of his illustrious \"singing career\".\n\nReflecting on the incredible £32 million he has helped raise for people suffering from cancer since 2000, Roger told the Metro about the experience of helping people in need and even getting to meet them.\n\n\"I’ve met so many over the years. There’s quite a few who will stay with me forever - I could never forget them and the letters and cards really mean a lot – I’ve kept them all.\"\n\n\"I'm some old fart of a rock singer and this has given me a purpose. I'm not very good at doing nothing and I'm looking towards the end of a singing career.\"\n\n\"So this has been something I'm proud of,\" he added. \"Pete and I also founded Teen Cancer America twelve years ago, and we're getting the chance to get together a lot of data that will really help the science one day.\"\n\nThe Who legend also nodded to the difficulties he's faced over the years trying to convince superstars to join his cause.\n\n\"Gosh, it was tough at the start, because I was determined bands should want to do this for free, and it's not easy getting big names to actually block out their time. My knees are now so sore from 24 years of begging,\" he joked.\n\n2024's edition of the Teenage Cancer Trust will mark Daltrey's last as curator, and will see special performances from The Who on two separate nights.\n\nAs well as a night of comedy, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, Young Fathers, and The Chemical Brothers will headline their own shows."
