        "text": "Roger Daltrey is extremely well-known to people invested in the music industry, having been the lead singer of rock band The Who for many years. Having co-founded the band, which is best known for hits such as \"My Generation\" and \"You Better You Bet\", Roger has been in the spotlight for decades, whether that be with The Who or his tours as a solo artist, so its no surprise he's settled for what he himself has referred to as a \"quiet\" life in Sussex.\n\nWith Sussex being a magnet for many musicians, including the likes of Sir Paul McCartney and Keith Richards, it appears that the Sussex countryside had the same affect on Roger Daltrey, who had first settled in the countryside with his wife back in 1971. Located near Burwash village, Roger and his wife live in a Grade II listed country home with views across the valleys of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Beauty, a view most of us could only ever dream of having from our living room.\n\nIn a recent interview with Forbes, Roger did open up about his \"quiet\" life on his Sussex farm, a far cry from his childhood in London. When asked who Roger Daltrey really is, Roger Daltrey told Forbes: \"He’s a very simple guy, to be honest, complicatedly simple. I like to look respectable, not like a bag of laundry, though most of the time on my farm I do.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The £1.3m Grade II-listed Uckfield cottage with 'state of the art' cinema room and barn\n\nRoger also said: \"I don’t want for much. I’m very quiet. I’ve had to live so much of my life being quiet. Singers don’t talk much, especially when they do three-hour shows. You come off of the stage with not much of a voice left.\"\n\nAs well as falling in love with his Sussex home and referring to it as a place he will stay in forever, Roger also fell in love with the Sussex country lifestyle. Roger has not only loved the views from his home but he has also loved the land his home is set in, using it as an estate for farming.\n\nHis estate, which is now 420 acres, is home to 230 cows and four lakes which he built with a friend. The lakes are open to the public on the site of Lakedown Fishery, a trout farm run by his son, Jamie.\n\nWhile his main occupation is being a rock and roll star, it appears Roger's other lifetime craft is working on his farm, something he has enjoyed for many years. Having loved Sussex since his childhood visits to Brighton, the singer and his wife show no signs of leaving the county and their beloved quiet life in their country home.\n\nDo you want the latest news from across Sussex delivered straight to your inbox?
