        "text": "Known for his wildly energetic performances, The Who’s Roger Daltrey was stopped short in 2015 by a severe case of viral meningitis. In the midst of excruciating pain and a grim prognosis, what he found to his surprise was peace. Roger shares how being so close to death gave him a perspective that provides comfort to this day.\n\nRoger Daltrey is the lead singer of the legendary band, The Who. Alongside his bandmate, Pete Townshend, he formed the Teenage Cancer Trust in the UK in 1990 and Teen Cancer America in 2012, with the goal of providing teens and young adults facing cancer with the highest standard in treatment and support."
