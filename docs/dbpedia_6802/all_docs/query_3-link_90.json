        "text": "LONG BEACH, Calif. â€” Who are you? Who, who? Who, who?\n\nFor some Verizon IndyCar Series drivers, that was the question Sunday when being introduced to rock legend and The Who frontman Roger Daltrey, 70.\n\n\"I think we've got some pretty excited team owners,\" joked driver Justin Wilson, 35. \"I know that for sure.\"\n\nDaltrey was attending the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach to promote Teen Cancer Awareness, a charity he started with bandmate Pete Townshend. He also was preparing to take a ride in a specially built two-seat Indy car with racing legend Mario Andretti behind the wheel.\n\n\"I have been in a race car before, so I have some inkling of what's coming,\" Daltrey said. \"But Mario is one hell of a driver, so I can't wait for it. It's going to be incredible.\"\n\nWhen asked what drivers like Wilson, Scott Dixon and Ryan Hunter-Reay, who appeared on behalf of TCA, must think when they meet him, Daltrey joked, \"Who's that?\"\n\nBut all were aware and glad to help out.\n\n\"It's an honor to meet someone like Roger,\" said defending IndyCar champion Scott Dixon, 33. \"But it's more of an honor to see someone like him pushing and trying to find support for such a great cause.\"\n\nTCA is similar to Daltrey's charity in the United Kingdom, Teenage Cancer Trust, which has built 27 hospital units specifically designed for teens with cancer.\n\n\"If you're under 16, you're diagnosed as a child. If you're over 16, you're classed as an adult,\" Daltrey said. \"So if you're 15 years old, you'll be in hospital with screaming kids, which is not great for someone who's 15 years old just waiting to do all those wonderful things 15-year-olds do. If you're 17, it would be worse. You'd be next to someone my age.\"\n\nHunter-Reay, who will start from the pole in today's race (NBC Sports Network, 4 p.m. ET), has been active in cancer care and research since his mother, Lydia, died of cancer in 2009.\n\n\"(Roger) doesn't have to do this,\" Hunter-Reay said. \"He's here of his own accord pushing the fight against cancer and the promotion to help people who face such an ugly fight. We're all here doing the same thing.\""
