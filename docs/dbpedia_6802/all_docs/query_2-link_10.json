        "text": "Roger Daltrey – legendary rock icon and co-founder of one of music’s most inspirational and influential forces, The Who, will be returning to the States on a special solo tour this June, presenting a mostly acoustic set of Who gems, rarities, solo nuggets and other surprises with an intimate rock-based band and setting as well as answering questions from the audience. The nine-city run will include a visit to Meadow Brook Amphitheatre on Tuesday, June 25 at 7:30 p.m. Oakland University Credit Union is the exclusive presenting partner of Meadow Brook Amphitheatre.\n\nKicking off this very exclusive set of shows on June 12 at Virginia’s renowned Wolf Trap Filene Center, the tour will continue throughout the month of June, wrapping on June 29 at The Pavilion at Ravinia in Highland Park, Illinois.\n\nSpecial guest for the much-anticipated performance include acclaimed, offbeat singer/songwriter Dan Bern. The unique venues and amphitheaters Daltrey has chosen for his summer run will showcase Daltrey’s acoustic interpretations of his extraordinary canon of Who songs and solo work, supported by a hand-picked ensemble of musicians. Simon Townshend – guitar, Billy Nicholls – mandolin, Jody Linscott – percussion, Doug Boyle – guitar, John Hogg – Bass, Katie Jacoby – violin, Steve Weston – harmonica, Geraint Watkins – keyboards/accordion, Scott Devours – Drums.\n\nDaltrey’s return to the States follows The Who’s incredibly successful THE WHO HITS BACK! Tour of 2022, with the band’s incomparable frontman drawing praise from all media platforms, including the Dallas Morning News, which said, ‘Daltrey took flight…roaring and howling and ripping his mic cord through the air like he was lassoing cattle…’ The charismatic singer also brought a highly successful solo tour to the States in 2018 via a 10-city run that showcased The Who’s legendary rock opera TOMMY, supported by full orchestral backing. Never content to rest on his laurels, the adventurous artist will continue to peel back the layers on his upcoming June tour, excited about expressing more musical shades of his solo palette, which he has generously shared with audiences in the U.S. and beyond throughout his career.\n\nAlso known to be one of rock’s more candid, straight-shooters, the working-class Daltrey (originally from London’s Shepherd’s Bush) will answer questions from the audience during the shows, sharing anecdotes and offering up uniquely tailored renditions of songs seldom performed live either by The Who or Daltrey.\n\nIn crafting this completely new show set to kick off in June 2024, Daltrey looks forward to unveiling one of his more intimate and unique stage shows, an up close and personal gift to his fans that highlights Who rarities, solo hits, and other songs from his incredible near 60-year career."
