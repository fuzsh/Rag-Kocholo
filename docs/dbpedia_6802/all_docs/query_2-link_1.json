        "text": "If any one member of The Who can be said to be the group’s founding member, it is singer Roger Daltrey, who was born in the West London suburb of Shepherd’s Bush on March 1, 1944. Daltrey first assembled the group that would become The Who in 1959 while at Acton County School, recruiting John Entwistle and subsequently agreeing to Entwistle's proposal that Pete Townshend should join. In those days, Daltrey, whose daytime job was in a sheet metal factory, even made the band’s guitars, and it was his energy and ambition that drove the group during their formative years. That same energy, coupled with his unwavering resolve, has sustained the group during periods of uncertainty ever since.\n\nDaltrey's earliest tastes in music ran to the blues and R&B, which formed the setlist during their early years as the Detours, as well as fifties rock ’n’ roll, which is reflected in his outstanding interpretations of such noted Who covers as Summertime Blues and Shakin’ All Over. In surrendering his leadership of the band to Townshend when the latter became the group’s songwriter, Daltrey became the mouthpiece for Townshend's lyrics and ideas. At the same time, he contributed to the group’s sense of showmanship by developing his unique skill at twirling his microphone lead around like a lasso and, by the time of “Tommy” in 1969, becoming one of rock’s most iconic sex symbols with his golden curls, bare chest and fringed suede coats.\n\nIn this respect, Daltrey became Tommy — the deaf, dumb, and blind boy of Townshend's imagination — and it was therefore only natural that he should assume the role in Ken Russell’s movie adaptation of the rock opera in 1975, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. This, in turn, led Daltrey to develop a concurrent career as a film actor while continuing to sing with The Who. Other film credits over the years include Ken Russell’s \"Lizstomania,\" the title role in \"McVicar,\" \"Lightning Jack\" with Paul Hogan, \"Teen Agent,\" and numerous roles in TV dramas. Most recently, he appeared in the U.S. CBS TV show \"CSI\" — which uses Who songs as theme music — as five separate, differently made-up characters, one of them a middle-aged African-American woman. Other U.S. TV appearances include \"Lois & Clark\" (Superman), \"Midnight Caller,\" \"William Tell,\" \"Sliders,\" and \"Highlander,\" as well as \"Leprechauns\" for Celtic Leprechaun Ltd. and \"The Bill,\" the long-running U.K. TV police drama. He has also narrated a series for the History Channel, undergoing extreme hardships similar to those faced by pioneering settlers in America and elsewhere.\n\nDaltrey has also cultivated a singing career outside of The Who, beginning in 1973 when he found himself on the BBC’s “Top of the Pops,” the U.K.’s then-premier chart TV show, promoting the single “Giving It All Away,” which reached No. 5 in the U.K. charts. It was a track from his first solo album “Daltrey,” released that same year, which he followed up with the albums “Ride a Rock Horse” (1975), “One of the Boys” (1977), the soundtrack to “McVicar” (1980), and “After the Fire” (1985).\n\nDaltrey has appeared on stage away from The Who on many occasions, and his 1994 solo concert at New York’s Carnegie Hall with the Juilliard Orchestra was the fastest-selling event in the venue’s history. The following year he appeared on stage as the Tin Man in a production of The Wizard of Oz at Lincoln Center, and in 1998 he starred as Scrooge in A Christmas Carol at Madison Square Garden. He has also performed with his friends The Chieftains, the traditional Irish band, and toured the world with the British Rock Symphony interpreting a variety of rock classics.\n\nAs well as being one of the original supporters of Nordoff Robbins, The Who have raised many millions for a multitude of charities throughout their career. Since 2000, Daltrey has been a patron of the Teenage Cancer Trust, a charity that builds specialized wards for teenagers with cancer in the U.K. That year Daltrey had the idea of setting up the first show at the Royal Albert Hall by “The Who & Friends,” with ticket sales and revenue from a DVD and CD raising over £1.2 million. As a result, Daltrey was given a Humanitarian Award in 2003 from Time magazine. In February 2005, Roger was awarded a CBE by the queen at Buckingham Palace for his services to music and good causes.\n\nAs a member of The Who, who were already members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Daltrey was inducted in 2005 into the U.K. Music Hall of Fame. In December 2008, he and Pete Townshend were honored with America's most prestigious cultural award as recipients of the 31st annual Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, D.C., by then-President of the United States, George W. Bush. On March 4, 2009, three days after his 65th birthday, Daltrey accepted the James Joyce Award from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin for outstanding success in the music field. On March 12, 2011, he received the Steiger Award in Germany for excellence in music. Daltrey and Pete Townshend received the Classic Album Award for “Quadrophenia” from the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards at the Roundhouse on November 9, 2011. On March 24, 2011, Daltrey and his band gave a complete performance of “Tommy” at a Teenage Cancer Trust show at the Royal Albert Hall, London, supported by imagery which he commissioned from students of Middlesex University. Over the next year, he toured “Tommy” in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.\n\nAfter playing the legendary Super Bowl in 2010 and closing the Olympics in 2012, The Who continued their charity work by playing a concert in January 2011 to raise money for trials of a new cancer treatment called PDT. Then in December 2012, they played at the Hurricane Sandy Benefit in New York, and in January 2014, they played a set to support the Stand Up to Cancer charity. Ever pursuing his mission to give something back to teenagers — “without whom,” as he said, “we would have no career” — in November 2012 Daltrey, with Pete Townshend at his side, launched Teen Cancer America. The charity is now established in the U.S., with offices in Los Angeles and devoted Teen Cancer units being opened in hospitals all over the U.S.\n\nBetween November 2012 and July 2013, The Who toured an arena production of “Quadrophenia + More” in the U.S. and the U.K., with added shows in Paris and Amsterdam. Daltrey directed the staging and visuals of the show himself. The tour received rave reviews from the press and fans alike.\n\nIn December 2013, Daltrey recorded an album with Wilko Johnson, guitarist of the legendary British R&B band Dr. Feelgood, for release on the revived Chess Label in March 2014. The album charted at No. 3 and sold over 150,000 copies in the U.K.\n\nIn October 2014, The Who embarked on a critically acclaimed U.K. and U.S. tour to mark their 50th anniversary, which included headlining at Hyde Park and Glastonbury. The tour lasted until May 2016, raising over $500,000 for Teen Cancer America along the way.\n\nAt the end of the tour on May 31, 2016, Daltrey and The Who played at a benefit in Los Angeles raising $1.5 million for Teen Cancer America and an equal amount for an autism charity.\n\nIn 2016, The Who performed further shows, including headlining the Isle of Wight and playing at the Festival in the Desert in October. In 2017, they did a residency at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas as well as several other U.S. shows and toured South America for the first time. They still found time for a short U.K. tour and performed “Tommy” at the Royal Albert Hall to benefit the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\n2018 saw the release of Daltrey’s autobiography and his first solo album in 26 years as well as a hugely successful orchestral solo tour of “Tommy” in the U.S. He also organized a benefit in L.A. for Teen Cancer America featuring Ed Sheeran, Van Morrison, Don Maclean, Jewel, and Daltrey’s solo band that raised $2 million for his charity.\n\n2019 saw The Who on the road again with a 46-piece orchestra touring the U.S. and playing at Wembley Stadium in July. In June, Daltrey celebrated the 50th anniversary of the release of “Tommy” with a live recording of his 2018 solo orchestral tour followed by another star-studded benefit show in L.A. for Teen Cancer featuring The Who, the Foo Fighters, Pink, and Kenny Loggins that raised another $2 million for the charity. A new Who album “WHO” was released in December to massive critical acclaim, charting at No. 2 in the U.S. and No. 3 in the U.K. The same month saw them being the first artists to be honored with a stone on the new Camden Music Walk of Fame before the pandemic prevented The Who from doing their U.K. and U.S. tours in 2020.\n\n2022 saw him touring the U.S. again with The Who as well as a string of solo dates in the U.K. during the summer in what was one of his busiest years ever. 2023 saw him touring Europe and the U.K. with The Who.\n\nHowever busy he is with his solo work and charitable endeavors, the group he formed at a Shepherd's Bush youth club at the age of 16 will always be his first love. Even more than his colleagues, it has been Daltrey who has done his best to keep The Who's flag flying during those periods when Townshend felt the need to seek creative outlets elsewhere. The respect he has earned from Who fans as a result is something he cherishes deeply.\n\nThis was never more apparent than when, in 1995, Daltrey took the trouble to generously assemble a band to appear at the first British Who Convention, organized by Who fans for Who fans, at Shepherd's Bush, the area of London where he was born which has become synonymous with the band. As the ad hoc group, which included John Entwistle and Townshend's brother Simon, left the stage, Daltrey gazed over the sea of faces. “Thank you,” he said, genuinely moved by the occasion. “You've given us a wonderful life.”"
