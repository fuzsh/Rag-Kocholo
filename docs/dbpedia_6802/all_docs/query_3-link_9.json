After the mob boss's Cadillac mysteriously resurfaces in a Las Vegas lake and a photo turns up of the murder victims posing with him in the 1970s, the CSIs begin to investigate whether or not the notorious gangster, whose disappearance remains a mystery, might somehow be connected to the current killing spree in Las Vegas. (TV-PG)\n\nMurcielago vs Evo VIII\n\nJeremy discovers the Toyota Prius is like a lethargic teenager, Richard takes a Mustang on a road movie across Lincolnshire and a four-door saloon (the Evo) goes head to head with a Lamborghini."
