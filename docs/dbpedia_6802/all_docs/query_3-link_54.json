        "text": "Rock and roll fans rejoice, because Roger Daltrey is making his way to the Mohegan Sun Arena this Sunday, June 23rd 2024. Get ready to rock out to some classic Daltrey tunes along with The Who’s hit songs as he tears up the stage before your very eyes. He may be older now, but his stage presence is timeless, so grab your tickets now!!! If you’ve wanted the chance to see hits like “Giving It All Away,” or “Written On The Wind,” now’s your perfect opportunity! Tickets are available online right now, so get them while they’re here.\n\nRoger Daltrey is most famously known as the lead singer of The Who, but he is just as talented on his own as well. He began his solo career when the band were still active with the original lineup, back in 1973. The career that followed has been long and tiring, but highly successful. So far, Roger has released eight studio albums and churned out dozens of rock hits.\n\nNow, he’s on tour with his solo band with plans to journey across the US and Canada. Don’t miss out, get your tickets now to see him in Connecticut!! Tickets might run out, so grab them if you’re ready to rock!!!\n\nThe Who have been through a lot as a band. With numerous lineup changes and multiple original members passing away, things have changed since their debut in 1964. Roger and Pete Townshend still perform as The Who with stand-in members for the rest of the band, but what Roger Daltrey is really focusing on is his solo career. He’s spent the last few decades perfecting his solo catalog along with tour dates slotted here and there. Catch him on his latest North American tour, get your tickets now! If you want to rock out this summer in Uncasville, grab some tickets right here.\n\nThe last album released by Daltrey was As Long as I Have You, which came out in March 2018. While it has been a little while since it was introduced, there are still some fans who have yet to see it live. He returned to touring back in 2022, and then did his rounds with Townshend as The Who in 2023. Whether he’s with his original band members or singing on his own with an all new band, Roger Daltrey is unstoppable. This tour is a chance to see one of the most influential voices in rock music live performing hits you know by heart - so get tickets now!!\n\nWhile The Who are still technically a band at the moment, they aren’t exactly the same as they were. Roger Daltrey himself, however, is just as authentically talented and vivacious on stage as ever. For an 80 year old, the man can still rock! And he will be rocking out all night long on June 23rd at the Mohegan Sun Arena, so get your tickets to see it all light up. You can’t call yourself a rock fan if you haven’t seen this man perform live. Seriously, tickets are available right now. So grab them while you can. You won’t regret it."
