        "text": "Roger Daltrey’s goal for his current North American solo tour is fairly straightforward.\n\n“I’m just determined to enjoy myself and explore the freedom I’ve got to do what I want to do on this tour, and let’s see where it ends up,” the Who frontman says via Zoom from his home in England.\n\nHe’s certainly earned that right.\n\nDaltrey is a 60-plus years into a career that has, of course, been dominated by the Who — most recently in 2022, when he and guitarist Pete Townshend, the band’s two remaining members, toured with an orchestra. On his own, meanwhile, Daltrey has recorded and acted (“Tommy,” “Lisztomania,” “McVicar,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation”). He also wrote a memoir in 2018 and started the Teenage Cancer rust charity in the U.K. as well as Teen Cancer America.\n\nHe’s constantly asked about future Who endeavors, but right now, having turned 80 in March, Daltrey is more interested in marching to the beat of his literal own drummer.\n\n“As far as I’m concerned, do we need another Who tour?” he asks. “We were a great group and two of our members died, and it’s been different since. We did as much as I could ever have wished for, and more. I thought it ended on the ultimate presentation of Pete Townshend’s music, which is out with the orchestra while maintaining the thunder of a rock band. That’s what the music deserved.”\n\nBut after myriad farewell tours and reunions, Daltrey knows better than to ever write the Who off completely. “There’s chemistry between Pete and I,” he acknowledges. “I love him dearly. There’s something special there, but it needs us both to be on fire and both wanting to be there. So if he really, really wants to do it I’m gonna turn up even with a broken leg, and I’ll deliver for you.”\n\nDaltrey and his own band — including Who musicians Simon Townshend (Pete’s younger brother) on guitar, violinist Katie Jacoby and Billy Nicholls on mandolin and vocals — are certainly celebrating the band in their shows, not the same way the Who would. “I just want to branch out and do something different,” Daltrey explains, “where I’ve got different instrumentation and I can stop using tape loops. It just creates a whole new sound and allows me the freedom as a singer.”\n\nIt’s allowed him to dig deep, too, and play songs like…well, if we told you, he might have to kill us.\n\n“I’m not gonna talk about songs,” says Daltrey, who’s also answering questions that fans submit prior to the concerts. “There’s no surprises left with concerts these days, ’cause everybody wants to see the setlist. I’m… sick of it. The Internet’s ruined the live shows for me. Who wants to know what’s coming next? People forget about surprises. I can’t stand it.”\n\nHe is, however, playing the Who’s epic “Won’t Get Fooled Again,” but taking a different act with that, too.\n\n“I’m gonna get the…audience to do the scream,” he says of the song’s signature. “I’ve done that scream for 55 years, and I’ve had enough of it. I don’t even want to try it now; it’s brutal on the vocal chords. They can do the scream, and I’ll do everything else.\n\n“I’m more into singing these days. At the age of 80, I think I deserve to be.”\n\nThe tour also coincides with the upcoming 55th anniversary of the first Woodstock festival, where the Who’s wee-hours set included the whole of its rock opera “Tommy,” and where Townshend famously booted activist Abbie Hoffman off the stage when he invaded to protest the imprisonment of the late John Sinclair back in Michigan. Daltrey recalls the experience as “muddy, smelly, but great to see old friends.”\n\nAnd he knows who deserves the credit for the festival’s enduring legend.\n\nCarlos Santana maintains a “spiritual frequency” in music, and life\n\n\"I always felt that the stars of Woodstock were the audience, never the bands,\" says Daltrey, whose future projects include a biopic about the late Who drummer Keith Moon that he's been working on for years and possibly a second book focusing on overcoming the insecurities he felt during the early days of the Who. He also played harmonica on an all-star version of Mark Knopfler's \"Going Home (Theme From Local Hero)\" to benefit the cancer charities.\n\n\"To me it was the beginning of the end of the Vietnam war,\" Daltrey continues, \"though casualty-wise it got worse. But it was the audience that created the wave that made the government realize they're gonna have to get to grips with this, 'cause they're gonna have a rebellion on their hands. The Woodstock audience did that, not the bands.\""
