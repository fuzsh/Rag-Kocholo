Bayesian methods are used for user-generated data\n\nStandardized Scores: Factors are converted into standardized scores (z-scores) for fair comparison among schools.\n\nWeight Assignment: We assign weights to factors, preventing any single factor from overly influencing rankings. We consider user preferences and industry research.\n\nOverall Score: Each school's overall score is calculated by applying weights to individual factor scores.\n\nData Completeness: Schools missing over 50% of data are excluded. Those with at least 50% data but lacking required factors get a grade but not a numerical ranking. Eligible schools have all factors and 500+ full-time undergraduates.\n\nRanking and Grades: Qualified schools are numerically ranked based on z-scores. Grades are assigned using the ordered z-scores, following a standard distribution.\n\nThis meticulous process ensures our rankings provide accurate and meaningful insights for your school choices."
