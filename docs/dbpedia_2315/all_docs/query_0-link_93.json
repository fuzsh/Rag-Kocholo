        "text": "Hello, my name is Andrew Taylor and I’m currently a 2023 graduating freshman at North eastern Oklahoma A&M College in Miami Oklahoma. Left-winger. 165 lbs. 5’11. 3.3 GPA. 2x 1st Team All-Conference(COC). 2x 1st Team All-District. 3-year captain. I can produce in the attack and be a speedster on the wing.\n\nI want to win, I want to develop, I want to make it to the draft. I want and need the best coaches in the country that produce those players. I want to be the next thing. I’m very coachable, extremely hardworking, and can handle a team on and off the field I want to change and impact heavily on a program. Make more of a name for myself and the school!\n\nThere's not one day I go without thinking of what can I do to make me better. I am always finding a way to improve my weaknesses. At the same time making my strengths better and better. I have a dream, a dream I am currently living. I want to continue to live my dream and pursue it until I can tell myself, on my very last game in my career, \"I did it.\"\n\nIf you made it this far into my story, I want you to know that I want a coach that will help me get to the next level. I am ready to play at the top college level, at any speed. I am a very motivated player and will do what is needed, I am willing to go anywhere.\n\nThank you, Andrew Taylor"
