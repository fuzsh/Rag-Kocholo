        "text": "Marking the culmination of years of hard work and dedication, McAuley Catholic senior distance runner Kendall Ramsey signed a letter of intent on Monday to join the Pittsburg State University cross country and track and field programs.\n\n“It’s very special and bittersweet because of all the time I’ve put in running and how all of the accomplishments came together,” Ramsey said of making her college decision official. “There were some happy tears today. I’ve had a lot of support from my family, and I can’t thank them enough.”\n\nRamsey said Pittsburg State was her choice for several reasons.\n\n“Their program has had a lot of success,” Ramsey said. “Their running program is great. My brother went to Pitt State, and I liked the environment there. I’m going to be majoring in biology and their biology program stood out to me. I want to do their pre-dental program and then go to dental school.”\n\nAs Warriors coach Andy Youngworth pointed out to the school’s student body ahead of the signing ceremony, Ramsey has definitely left her mark on McAuley’s cross country and track programs.\n\nRamsey is the school record-holder in the 5K (20:46), the 1600 (5:39) and the 3200 (12:23).\n\nIn cross country, Ramsey advanced to the state meet all four years of high school, earning all-state honors as a junior and senior. Ramsey finished eighth and ninth in Class 1 the last two years.\n\nRamsey was listed on the Southwest Missouri Coaches Association’s all-region team in three straight seasons.\n\nOn the track, Ramsey is a two-time state qualifier and one-time state medalist who has also earned multiple conference, district and sectional championships in her signature events, the 1600 and the 3200.\n\nRamsey finished sixth in the 1600 and ninth in the 3200 at last May’s state track meet.\n\nOf course, Ramsey still has her senior season of track ahead of her this spring.\n\nRamsey noted she hopes to finish her prep career on a high note.\n\n“I want to qualify for the state meet again,” she said. “It’s going to be hard because we have some really fast girls in our district and sectional. I want to PR one last time. And if I can make it to the state meet, I want to medal. I’m going to work hard to try and accomplish my goals.”\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. — McAuley Catholic junior Michael Parrigon finished fourth in Class 1 to lead a strong area contingent at the 49th MSHSAA Cross Country Championships on Friday morning at the Gans Creek Cross Country Course.\n\nParrigon toured the 5K course in 16 minutes, 28 seconds.\n\nFinishing ahead of Parrigon were West Nodaway’s Riley Blay (15:48), Marion C. Early’s Landon Duchscherer (15:55) and Dora’s Cade Nold (16:26). Blay won for the third straight season.\n\nParrigon’s showing is the best state finish in program history for the McAuley boys. Max Ostmeyer finished 17th in 2016 and Parrigon was 21st last year.\n\n“I thought he could be in the top five,” McAuley Catholic coach Andy Youngworth said. “The kid from Dora is really good. And I’m not going to use this as an excuse, but it’s a fact that Michael played two soccer matches this week, including last night. Max Anreder also had to deal with that. Both ran well. I thought Michael was in a good position for most of the race.”\n\nIn addition to Parrigon, three other Joplin area runners finished in the top 30 to earn all-state honors in the Class 1 boys race.\n\nJasper junior Leland Harris placed 20th in 17:40, while McAuley’s duo of Trae Veer (17:42) and Will Mollnow (17:43) finished 22nd and 23rd, respectively. Veer is a sophomore and Mollnow is just a freshman.\n\n“Will passed 11 or 12 guys in the last 400 meters to medal,” Youngworth noted. “He had a great finish.”\n\nThomas Jefferson had two athletes competing — freshman Liam Cook finished 34th in 18:03 and junior Braden Honeywell-Lynch was 45th in 18:12.\n\nAlso competing for McAuley were Alex Bohachick (102nd), Connor Taffner (111th), Cliff Nolan (137th) and Max Anreder (141st).\n\nThe Warriors finished fifth out of 15 teams in the Class 1 standings with 136 points. The top four teams take home a trophy.\n\nFor the Warriors, it was a memorable day.\n\n“We had three state medalists and that’s the first time that’s happened in school history,” Youngworth said. “Last year we had two medalists and that was the first time that had happened. I’m really pleased.\n\n“I think the boys were disappointed we took fifth. We were six points away from fourth and nine points away from third. Going in, I felt like there were three or four schools that could finish anywhere from third to sixth. But I thought our kids ran well. We worked really hard this year, from August 7th to today. And that doesn’t include the time in the summer. We put in a lot of time and effort and I think it showed.”\n\nOf note, all of McAuley’s boys will return next season, as there are no seniors on the roster.\n\nHermitage (74), Van Buren (97), Oak Ridge (127) and Vienna (130) were the top four teams.\n\nThere were 170 runners in the boys race.\n\nCLASS 1 GIRLS\n\nLiberal freshman Ally Barton finished third in the Class 1 girls race with a time of 20:17, leading the Bulldogs to a runner-up finish in the team standings.\n\nSouth Nodaway’s Mya Wray was the Class 1 champion in 19:11 and Stoutland’s Mallory Shaw was the runner-up in 20:15.\n\nEarning all-state recognition with their respective top-30 showings, McAuley Catholic senior Kendall Ramsey finished ninth in 20:46, while Liberal junior Taylor Swarnes was 10th in 20:53 and McAuley freshman Olivia Parrigon placed 11th in 20:56 to give the Warriors five all-state performances on the day.\n\nLiberal’s Abby Barton finished 30th and teammate Bailey Couch was 34th, while Thomas Jefferson’s Macie Shifferd finished 40th and teammate Sarah Mueller was 52nd.\n\nAlso competing for McAuley were Riley Sears (69th), Marbellie Villanueva (91st) and Samantha Perrin (129th).\n\nThe top four teams were Chadwick (60), Liberal (98), East Carter (112) and Paris (130).\n\nThe runner-up showing is the best state finish in school history for the Liberal girls, who were fourth in 2017.\n\nMcAuley finished eighth in the standings with 169 points.\n\n“Our girls really had a great meet,” Youngworth said. “We went from 13th last year to eighth this year. Olivia finishing 11th as a freshman is great. It was Kendall’s fourth state appearance and second medal. She actually ran faster this year than last year but finished one place lower this year. There are a lot of good runners in Class 1. I’m proud of all of our girls. Riley Sears had a good day. That’s another freshman who put together some really good workouts and those translated into faster times at the meets. Marbellie and Sam ran well and will both be back. Kendall is our only senior. You can’t replace her. She’s a great kid.”\n\nThere were 143 runners and 13 full teams.\n\nCLASS 2 BOYS\n\nCompeting in Class 2 on Friday, College Heights Christian sophomore Colton McMillan finished 28th in 17:25 to earn all-state honors. McMillan was the lone area product to earn all-state recognition in the Class 2 boys race.\n\nAlso competing for CHC were sophomore Owen Horton (101st) and freshman Connor Jordan (106th).\n\nDiamond’s Wyatt Housh (88th), Purdy’s duo of Jayden Griffis (104th) and Logan Manwarren (105th) and Pierce City’s Joseph Leavitt (132nd) also competed.\n\nWoodland’s Reed Layton was the Class 2 champion in 16:25.\n\nThe top four teams were Woodland (96), KC Lutheran (137), New Covenant (168) and North Platte (175).\n\nThere were 169 runners and 16 full teams.\n\nCLASS 2 GIRLS\n\nPierce City sophomore Emma Hunt finished 12th in the Class 2 girls race with a time of 20:16. Hunt was the lone local runner to earn a top-30 finish in the Class 2 girls race.\n\nAlso competing from the region were Sarcoxie’s Laney Dorris (72nd), Pierce City’s Lauren Blackburn (83rd), Purdy’s Courtney Patterson (86th), Sarcoxie’s Ariel Wilson (95th), Pierce City’s Ginger Leavitt (102nd), Sarcoxie’s trio of Lily Garrison (124th), Jordyn Misner (139th) and Natasha Garcia (149th) and Pierce City’s Emily Haasse (154th).\n\nBrentwood’s Kensington Curd was the Class 2 champion in 19:24.\n\nThe top four teams were Lafayette County (111), Woodland (138), Hermann (142) and Stockton (143).\n\nThere were 157 runners and 16 teams.\n\nNotes: College Heights Christian will have girls competing in Saturday’s Class 3 race at 9:45 a.m.\n\nThe Class 4-5 races are also scheduled to be held on Saturday, with local schools Carl Junction, Webb City and Joplin set to compete.\n\nLAMAR, Mo. — McAuley Catholic is taking two full squads to the state cross country championships.\n\nMcAuley Catholic’s boys finished second and the girls placed third at the Class 1 District 2 meet on Saturday at Jeremy’s Creek Golf Course.\n\nAt the district meet, the top four teams and the top 30 individuals advanced to the state meet.\n\nThe top four boys teams were Hermitage (35), McAuley Catholic (74), School of the Ozarks (111) and Dadeville (117). Of course, the Warriors finished fourth in Class 1 last season.\n\n“It is a great accomplishment to return to state,” McAuley Catholic coach Andy Youngworth said. “Last year was our first time qualifying for state, and I thought we handled the pressure of expecting to qualify this year very well.”\n\nOn a chilly Saturday morning, McAuley junior Michael Parrigon was the district runner-up with a time of 16:35. Marion C. Early’s Landon Duchscherer took first in 15:59.\n\nMcAuley sophomore Trae Veer finished eighth in 17:45, while Jasper junior Leland Harris placed 14th in 17:55 and McAuley freshman Will Mollnow finished 17th in 18:03.\n\nThomas Jefferson had two individual state qualifiers, as junior Braden Honeywell-Lynch placed 19th (18:14) and freshman Liam Cook finished 29th (18:39).\n\nAlso for McAuley, Connor Taffner finished 31st, Alex Bohachick was 41st, Cliff Nolan placed 59th and Max Anreder was 62nd.\n\n“We really had a few kids step up,” Youngworth said of his team’s performance. “Michael had a good early battle with the runner from Marion C. Early, but fell back a bit, forcing him to run alone most of the meet on a cold, windy day. All of our boys ran tough. Will Mollnow finished 17th. It was his best race of the year. Connor Taffner also ran well, as did Alex Bohachick, who benefitted from the cold conditions. Cliff Nolan and Max Anreder rounded out our top seven and were able to put together solid races in their first championship meet.”\n\nAlso competing for Thomas Jefferson were Spencer Long (32nd), Jack Twiss (34th), Ashan Appuhamy (57th), Ringo Snow (58th) and James Sheppard (76th).\n\nMcAuley’s girls also qualified its full team to state.\n\nThe top four girls teams were Chadwick (33), Liberal (47), McAuley Catholic (78) and School of the Ozarks (104).\n\nLiberal freshman Ally Barton was the district medalist with a time of 20:11.\n\nMcAuley Catholic senior Kendall Ramsey placed fifth in 21:00, while freshman Olivia Parrigon was sixth in 21:12 and freshman Riley Sears took 27th in 23:30.\n\nAlso scoring points for McAuley were Marbellie Villanueva (41st) and Samantha Perrin (49th).\n\n“Kendall Ramsey and Olivia Parrigon ran as expected, finishing fifth and sixth, respectively, and really had nice races,” Youngworth said. “Riley Sears ran her best race of the year, running almost a 90 second PR, and was key to our finish. Marbellie Villanueva struggled a bit in the middle of the race but finished well. Sam Perrin ran another good race and continues to gain confidence.”\n\nThomas Jefferson had a pair of qualifiers, as junior Macie Shifferd (22:40) and senior Sarah Mueller (22:53) finished 14th and 15th, respectively.\n\nCLASS 2\n\nThe College Heights Christian boys had three individual state qualifiers in Class 2, as Colton McMillan finished 11th in 18:27, Owen Horton placed 19th in 19:11 and Connor Jordan took 21st in 19:17.\n\nOther local qualifiers were Diamond’s Wyatt Housh (14th), Purdy’s Logan Manwarren (16th) and Jayden Griffis (22nd) and Pierce City’s Joseph Leavitt (29th).\n\nThe top four boys teams were New Covenant (57), Mansfield (83), Alton (85) and Southwest (106). College Heights finished sixth with 133 points.\n\nIn the Class 2 girls race, Pierce City’s Emma Hunt placed third with a time of 20:28. New Covenant’s Clara Trent (19:29) and Ash Grove’s Millison Sapp (20:09) were the only runners to finish ahead of Hunt.\n\nAlso advancing with their top 30 finishes were Pierce City’s Lauren Blackburn (12th), Purdy’s Courtney Patterson (13th), Sarcoxie’s Laney Dorris (16th), Pierce City’s Ginger Leavitt (17th) and Sarcoxie’s duo of Lily Garrison (21st) and Ariel Wilson (22nd).\n\nThe qualifying girls teams were Sparta (39), Pierce City (59), Sarcoxie (73) and Mansfield (87).\n\nCLASS 3\n\nEast Newton’s Chase Sorrell was the runner-up in the Class 3 boys race with a time of 16:02, as El Dorado Springs’ Wyatt Klaiber took first in 15:45.\n\nLamar’s Cameron Bailey and Ryder Friend finished sixth and seventh, while Aurora’s Carsen Gillam was 15th. East Newton’s Nicholas Shaeffer finished 18th and Pierce City’s Pierce Heins was 19th. Cassville’s Ethan Bohmke (21st), Michael Butts (25th) and Trever Garnett (28th) all advanced.\n\nThe top four boys teams were El Dorado Springs (35), Springfield Catholic (101), Lamar (118) and Strafford (143).\n\nIn the Class 3 girls race, Lamar’s Abigail Diggs finished third in 20:33 and Cassville’s Jadyn Williams-Reed placed fourth in 20:34.\n\nMount Vernon’s Rylee Simons took ninth, Lamar’s duo of LeiLani Toves and Carly Dunham were 13th and 16th and East Newton’s Brooklyn Blanchard finished 21st.\n\nCollege Heights Christian’s Marla Anderegg finished 22nd and teammate Jesalin Bever was 27th to advance. Aurora’s Drew Mayes finished 23rd and Cassville’s Tori Mitchell took 29th.\n\nFair Grove’s Katrina Cantwell took first in 19:57.\n\nThe top four teams were Osage (94), Lamar (103), Clever (112) and Springfield Catholic (113).\n\nNOTE: The MSHSAA Cross Country Championships for Class 1-2 is Nov. 3 at Gans Creek in Columbia, while the Class 3-5 races are scheduled for Nov. 4.\n\nClass 1 District 2 Meet\n\nBoys team standings: Hermitage 35, McAuley Catholic 74, School of the Ozarks 111, Dadeville 117, Thomas Jefferson 125, Blue Eye 168, Stoutland 178, Walnut Grove 198, Gloria Deo 223, Fair Play 231, Humansville 259.\n\nGirls team standings: Chadwick 33, Liberal 47, McAuley Catholic 78, School of the Ozarks 104, Blue Eye 106, Hermitage 135, Gloria Deo 162.\n\nFULL RESULTS: MileSplit Live Results\n\nThe McAuley Catholic cross country program had a historic day.\n\nMcAuley Catholic’s boys and girls both captured the team championships at the 2023 Ozark 7 Conference Meet on Friday night at the Tom Rutledge Cross Country Course at Missouri Southern State University.\n\n“I was extremely pleased with the efforts of both teams, and of our middle school kids,” McAuley Catholic coach Andy Youngworth said. “We were able to win all four divisions, quite an accomplishment for the kids and coaches! It was a hot, sunny day, but I thought our kids handled it well. I was very proud of our student body who came out and cheered us on today.”\n\nThe McAuley boys repeated as conference champs with 31 points. College Heights was second with 38 and Thomas Jefferson (55) was the third team with a full squad competing.\n\n“Our boys team had some pressure on them this year, as we were the defending conference champion,” Youngworth said. “College Heights and Thomas Jefferson have some very good runners, and I knew we would have to run a great race in order to win.”\n\nMcAuley junior Michael Parrigon was the individual conference champion, as he crossed the line at 16:41, more than a minute faster than the runner-up.\n\nCollege Heights Christian’s Colton McMillan took second in 17:46, McAuley’s Trae Veer was third in 17:48, Thomas Jefferson’s Braden Honeywell-Lynch took fourth in 17:54 and CHC’s Connor Jordan placed fifth in 18:32.\n\nFinishing sixth through 10th were McAuley’s Will Mollnow, Thomas Jefferson’s Liam Cook, CHC’s Owen Horton, McAuley’s Connor Taffner and CHC’s Caleb Quade.\n\nRounding out the top 15 were TJ’s Spencer Long, McAuley’s Alex Bohachick, CHC’s Steven Calandro, Wheaton’s Jayson Peterson and CHC’s Drew Sawkins.\n\nMcAuley’s Cliff Nolan, TJ’s duo of Ashan Appuhamy and Jack Twiss, McAuley’s Max Anreder and Exeter’s Josue Alcaraz completed the top 20.\n\nYoungworth, who noted the Ozark 7 schools appreciate MSSU allowing the meet to be held on campus at the Rutledge course, said his boys team performed well overall.\n\n“Michael Parrigon continues to run well, racing alone for the bulk of the meet,” Youngworth said. “Trae Veer finished third, beating some good kids. Trae continues to improve each week, and just runs very smart races. Will Mollnow earned all-conference recognition, as did Connor Taffner. Alex Bohachick finished as our No. 5 and continues to improve after a long illness kept him out of competition for a few weeks. Cliff Nolan ran a solid race as our No. 6 and dropped 45 seconds from last year. Max Anreder rounded out our top seven.”\n\nThe postseason awaits for the Warriors.\n\n“We will face a very tough Hermitage at districts next weekend, they are the defending Class 1 state champions,” Youngworth said. “We will have to have great races from all of our kids in order to challenge them.”\n\nGIRLS HIGHLIGHTS\n\nMcAuley’s girls edged defending champion College Heights Christian by just three points, 26-29. The Warriors had four top-10 finishers, while the Cougars had three runners in the top five.\n\n“I think the surprise of the day was our girls defeating College Heights, our first-ever girls conference championship,” Youngworth said. “They are very well-coached and were the defending conference champions, but I challenged the girls a little bit this week, telling them they had nothing to lose by being aggressive and running to win.”\n\nMcAuley freshman Olivia Parrigon was the conference champion with a time of 21:07.\n\nCollege Heights Christian junior Marla Anderegg was the runner-up in 21:37 and McAuley senior Kendall Ramsey took third in 21:59.\n\nCHC’s Jesalin Bever and Lilly Royer finished fourth and fifth, while Thomas Jefferson’s duo of Macie Shifferd and Sarah Mueller were sixth and seventh.\n\nExeter’s Kaylyn Weiser finished eighth and McAuley’s tandem of Riley Sears and Marbellie Villanueva finished ninth and 10th, respectively.\n\nAlso of note, College Heights’ Madi Carson finished 13th, McAuley’s Samantha Perrin was 14th, CHC’s Katie Moss placed 17th, CHC’s Lilly Lackey took 19th and McAuley’s Genevieve Billings finished 20th.\n\nYoungworth noted he was proud of how the girls team performed.\n\n“Olivia Parrigon is our first-ever conference champion, and she ran most of the race with Kendall Ramsey and was able to pull away in the last 800 meters,” Youngworth said. “I think the key to our win though was the work of our No. 3, No. 4 and No. 5 runners. Riley Sears ran a career PR and earned all-conference honors, as did Marbellie Villanueva, who ran a PR for the season. Our No. 5 was Samantha Perrin, who finished 14th, but dropped over three minutes from last year’s race. We are starting to run with more confidence, and I look forward to the opportunity to see them compete at districts next week.”\n\nOZARK 7 CONFERENCE MEET\n\nBoys team standings: McAuley Catholic 31, College Heights Christian 38, Thomas Jefferson 55.\n\nGirls team standings: McAuley Catholic 26, College Heights 29.\n\nFULL RESULTS: Ozark 7 Conference Meet 2023 – Meet Results (milesplit.com)\n\nCARTHAGE, Mo. — Webb City had not only the top local individuals, but also the best team finishes in both varsity races at the 50th annual Carthage Invitational cross country meet on Thursday at the Carthage Golf Course.\n\nWebb City sophomore Brooke Hedger finished third in the girls race with a time of 20:58, leading the Cardinals to runner-up finish in the team standings.\n\nCardinals senior Evan Stevens placed third in the boys race with a time of 16:55, leading Webb City to a third-place team finish, just two points behind runner-up Rogers (Ark.).\n\nCarthage, Carl Junction, McAuley Catholic, Thomas Jefferson and East Newton also had athletes competing at the event.\n\nFree State High School from Kansas won both team titles.\n\nIn the girls’ team standings, Carthage finished fourth, Carl Junction was sixth and McAuley Catholic took eighth.\n\nCarthage’s boys finished fifth in the team standings, with Carl Junction seventh, McAuley eighth and Thomas Jefferson 11th.\n\nWEBB CITY HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe Webb City girls had three of the top 11 runners, with all five placing in the top 22.\n\nHedger placed third behind Rogers’ Kayla Eggers (20:21) and Free State’s Cayman Barnes (20:56).\n\nWebb City’s Emily Countryman finished eighth in 22:06, while Olivia Klotz took 11th in 22:45.\n\nAlso competing for the Webb City girls were Amelia Antillon (21st) and Brooke Collard (22nd).\n\nThe Webb City boys had five runners finish in the top 19.\n\nStevens finished third behind Free State’s duo of Blake Wohler (16:24) and Jake Loos (16:50).\n\nWebb City’s Mason Hedger finished 10th (17:30), while Spencer Kendall took 16th (17:43), Noah Lankard was 18th (17:49) and Andrew Dawson finished 19th (17:51).\n\nAlso for the Cardinals, Fenton Rice finished 30th (19:00) and Dakota Grove was 33rd (19:01).\n\nCARTHAGE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nEddy Fuentes led the Carthage boys by finishing 24th in 18:13.\n\nAlso competing for the Carthage boys were Devin Smith (34th), Javen Byrd (37th), Brayan Perez Flores (40th), Denis Velasquez Perez (55th) and Xander Vazquez (79th).\n\nMaggie Boyd led the Carthage girls by finishing 14th in 22:55 and Jennifer Rodas-Gomez took 18th in 23:12.\n\nAlso competing for the CHS girls were Genesis Fuentez-Elias (25th), Katy Witherspoon (39th), Kimberly Monterroso (42nd), Jenna Wilson (52nd) and Sarah Wilson (57th).\n\nCARL JUNCTION HIGHLIGHTS\n\nJack Lawson led the Carl Junction boys by finishing 22nd in 18:05.\n\nRounding out the top seven for the CJ boys were Isaac Willoughby (43rd), Luke Battagler (46th), Nikash Yeary (57th), Jacob Garrett (60th), Alexander Allison (63rd) and Chance Golden (66th).\n\nMarissa Newman was CJ’s top female finisher, as she crossed the line 26th in 23:51, while Delaney Harris was 29th in 24:11.\n\nRounding out the top seven for the CJ girls were Madilyn Dalton (32nd), Audrey Fletcher (41st), Summer Sampson (44th), Bella Montez (60th) and Gracie Fletcher (72nd).\n\nMCAULEY CATHOLIC HIGHLIGHTS\n\nMichael Parrigon led McAuley Catholic by finishing 20th with a time of 17:54.

Incomplete teams: Clever, East Newton, Sarcoxie, Wheaton.\n\nAfter a historic 2022 season, the McAuley Catholic cross country program is primed for another successful campaign with the return of three all-state performers and a large number of returning letterwinners.\n\nThe defending Ozark 7 Conference champions, McAuley’s boys qualified a full squad to the state meet and finished fourth in Class 1, securing the program’s first state trophy.\n\nNow, entering the 2023 seasons, six key performers are back for McAuley’s boys — juniors Michael Parrigon, Grant Horinek and Cliff Nolan and sophomores Trae Veer, Alex Bohachick and Connor Taffner.\n\n“We’re looking forward to the upcoming season,” McAuley coach Andy Youngworth said. “We had a much better commitment to the offseason this summer and the kids have really adjusted well to the expectations of the coaching staff and improved on the quality of their training as compared to last year.”\n\nParrigon and Veer earned all-state recognition after finishing 21st and 24th, respectively, at last year’s state meet. Parrigon finished third at the Ozark 7 Conference Meet and took 11th at the district meet, while Veer placed fourth in the conference and 16th at the district event. Bohachick and Taffner also competed at state and earned second-team all-Ozark 7 honors last season by finishing 13th and 14th, respectively.\n\nNewcomers to the team include sophomore Max Anreder and freshmen Rylan Childers, Nolan Minor and Will Mollnow.\n\nWith the returners and newcomers on the roster, Youngworth feels there’s a lot to like about this year’s team.\n\n“We return two all-state runners and our No. 6 and No. 7 runners from last year, along with two juniors who provide depth from our trophy team last year,” Youngworth said. “We have added four newcomers and we look forward to a great environment this fall. All 10 runners have a chance to contribute this fall, and the competition to be in the top seven will be something that will only make us better. I believe we have a strong work ethic, and our culture continues to strengthen. The kids like each other and do a lot of things together outside of practice.”\n\nThe Warriors, who lost three key performers to graduation in Phillip Motazedi, Joe Staton and Drew Zeb, are still a relatively young team.\n\n“Our biggest concern is the fact that we have no returning seniors,” Youngworth said. “We are still trying to learn our roles and that will get better organically as we continue practice this fall. It will also be important to continue to focus on team goals over individual goals as the season progresses. We need all 10 guys to be invested in the long range plans. No season is perfect, so we’ll need to overcome injuries and illnesses, but our depth will help with that.”\n\nYoungworth noted the overall team goals for the season include being competitive at every meet, competing for a conference championship, qualifying as many athletes to state as possible and seeing each runner improve.\n\nYoungworth is confident his squad has the ability to have a successful season if it continues to work hard.\n\n“We are the defending Ozark 7 champions and a trophy team from last year,” he said. “It’s important for them to remember just that. But it was last year and nothing will be given to us this year. We have to continue to work hard and earn it. And we’ll need to stay sharp and focused in order to return to the podium.”\n\nRAMSEY TO LEAD MCAULEY GIRLS\n\nMcAuley Catholic also took its entire girls team to state last fall.\n\nMcAuley’s girls will once again be led by standout Kendall Ramsey, who enters her senior year as a three-time state-qualifier.\n\nAs a junior, Ramsey finished eighth at the state meet, third at the district meet and third at the Ozark 7 Meet.\n\n“Kendall Ramsey brings experience and confidence to the team and did a great job teaching the newcomers last year how to be a Lady Warrior cross country runner,” Youngworth said of the program’s third returning all-state performer.\n\nIn addition to Ramsey, McAuley’s girls feature three other returning varsity performers — juniors Marbellie Villanueva and Genevieve Billings and sophomore Samantha Perrin. As a sophomore, Villanueva finished eighth at the conference meet and 18th at the district meet. Villanueva and Perrin both competed at last year’s state meet.\n\nNewcomers to the team include freshmen Olivia Parrigon and Riley Sears.\n\nYoungworth would love to see the girls team build on last year’s success.\n\n“For the first time in school history, McAuley Catholic fielded a full team and qualified for the state meet, also a first in program history,” he said. “We were young and inexperienced last year, and the girls we have coming back learned a lot about themselves and running. They had a good offseason and are looking forward to building on last year’s success.”\n\nDespite a small roster, Youngworth hopes to see the girls program make progress this season.\n\n“I believe we will be more competitive overall, but we’re still young and are going to experience ups and downs over the course of the year,” he said. “We only have six girls out again this year, so our depth is a concern, and we will be patient early in the year as far as training goes. Three of the girls play volleyball and will miss some training as a result. We’ll try to find a good balance for them so they can experience success in both sports. Our goals are to be more competitive within our conference. College Heights is the defending Ozark 7 champion and they return several good runners. We’d like to qualify for state again and improve on our 13th place finish.”\n\nLike the boys team, Youngworth said he’s been pleased with the dedication his girls have shown.\n\n“Each girl just shows up every day willing to learn and push the ceiling a little bit,” he said.\n\nWhile youth and depth are areas of concern for the McAuley girls, Youngworth noted the keys to success are simple.\n\n“Just continuing to work hard and stay happy and healthy as we transition from our pre-season training to the competitive season,” he said.\n\nMAKING PROGRESS AS A PROGRAM\n\nYoungworth, who is now in his third year coaching the Warriors and his 30th overall, said he’s been pleased with the progress the McAuley cross country program has made in a short time.\n\n“We have a great staff and very supportive parents who have really bought into what we are trying to accomplish,” Youngworth said. “Darbi Stancell returns as the head coach for the middle school and has 30-plus years of experience. Chris Moreno returns as well. He is a long time AAU track and field and cross country coach who also has almost 30 years of experience.”\n\nOverall, the Warriors are coming off a historic season that concluded at the state championships. And Youngworth is optimistic about the upcoming season.\n\n“We had a great summer of offseason conditioning, the kids are anxious to improve upon last season’s performance, and for the most part, were very committed each and every day,” he said. “Most of the kids ran on their own when we did not meet and that’s a huge factor as we try to build a distance running culture at McAuley Catholic. We do a lot of activities away from running that help cement the bond within the team. In the end, it helps if they like each other, get along and create connections that will remain for years to come.”\n\nFor the first time since 2019, McAuley Catholic High School will have boys competing at the state track meet.\n\nTwo members of the team, senior Joe Staton and sophomore Tripp Miller, punched their respective tickets to the state championships by finishing in the top four of their events at this past Saturday’s Class 1 Sectional 3 meet in Point Lookout.\n\nThe pair will join the school’s lone female state qualifier, Kendall Ramsey, at the state meet on Friday in Jefferson City.\n\n“I was really pleased with our effort,” McAuley coach Andy Youngworth said of the sectional showing. “The district we were competing against was very competitive. I’m disappointed for the kids that didn’t make it, but I’m really excited for the three kids who are moving on.”\n\nThe McAuley track program has made steady progress under Youngworth.\n\nIn 2019, McAuley’s boys track team was represented at the Class 1 state meet by the 4×200-meter relay team of Jacob Price, Nathan Taylor, Joseph Lupicki and Jake Staton.\n\nThere was no state track meet in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMcAuley’s track program had no state qualifiers in ’21.\n\nIn ’22, none of the team’s boys were able to advance.\n\nThis year, the Warriors broke through and ended the drought. One week after winning the program’s first district title, the Warriors had a pair of boys advance to state.\n\n“Two years ago, only one boy and one girl qualified for sectionals,” Youngworth noted. “Last year, we had one girl in an event and five boys events at the sectional and none of the boys made it to state. So, to me, that’s something we’ve accomplished this year. It’s nice to be able to have a couple of kids going to state this year.”\n\nAt the sectional meet, Staton finished fourth in the pole vault (9-5) and Miller was fourth in the javelin (118-4).\n\n“Joe and Tripp keep getting better every day,” Youngworth said. “They have their work cut out for them if they want to medal at state, but stranger things have happened.”\n\nAhead of the sectional, Staton was the district champion in the pole vault, while Miller took second at the district event.\n\nStaton and Miller are also members of McAuley’s baseball team. The two had a late Friday night with the baseball team before getting up early on Saturday to head to the track meet.\n\nThe third-seeded McAuley baseball team meets second-seeded Exeter at 6:15 on Tuesday in a district semifinal.\n\nWith a win, the baseball team would play for a district title on Wednesday night. The state track meet begins on Friday in Jefferson City.\n\n“Hopefully those guys will get the chance to compete for a district championship in baseball and compete at the state track meet in the same week,” Youngworth said of Staton and Miller.\n\nAs far as other events at Saturday’s sectional, McAuley’s boys just missed qualifying in three relays after finishing fifth in the 4×100, 4×400 and 4×800.\n\n“Our 4×8 dropped 16 seconds but didn’t get out,” Youngworth said. “Our 4×1 was very close to making it to state. Our 4×4 just didn’t run as well as it did at districts. I was disappointed for our relays. They worked hard.”\n\nJunior Michael Parrigon just missed advancing in the two events after finishing fifth in the 1600 and sixth in the 800.\n\n“That’s just life,” Youngworth said. “Not everything is going to fall your way.”\n\nYoungworth noted those disappointments should provide extra motivation next season.\n\n“We’ll have a lot of our kids back next year,” he said. “This season was a great learning experience. We just have to get better. That’s the bottom line. We have to train harder.”\n\nOn the girls side, McAuley Catholic junior Kendall Ramsey was the sectional champ in two events — the 1600-meter run (5:50) and the 3200 (13:27).\n\n“Kendall ran really well,” Youngworth said. “She went out in the 1600 and 3200 and just controlled the race early on. I know she can run faster than her times from Saturday. She didn’t have to run really hard just to get out. I’m happy for her.”\n\nRamsey is no stranger to state competition.\n\nMcAuley’s lone state qualifier in ’22, Ramsey finished 10th in the 3200 at last May’s state track meet. She placed eighth at this past fall’s state cross country championships.\n\nYoungworth noted that Ramsey has the potential to earn a spot on the awards podium in both events this weekend.\n\n“I think she can get on the podium,” he said. “She’s matured a lot as a runner. If she runs her personal best in both events she’s got a chance to medal.”\n\nThe MSHSAA Class 1 Track and Field Championships will be held on Friday and Saturday at Adkins Stadium in Jefferson City.\n\nPOINT LOOKOUT, Mo. — College Heights Christian, Thomas Jefferson and McAuley Catholic had athletes qualify for the state track meet with their performances at their respective sectional meets on Saturday at School of the Ozarks.\n\nCollege Heights’ boys were among the teams competing at the Class 2 Sectional 3 meet, while Thomas Jefferson and McAuley competed in Class 1.\n\nThe top four finishers in each event advanced to the state meet.\n\nCOLLEGE HEIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe College Heights boys won the Class 2 4×200-meter relay in 1:35, with Logan Decker, Levi Durling, Caleb Quade and Colsen Dickens competing.\n\nA junior, Quade advanced to state in two individual events, as he was the runner-up in both the triple jump (12.16m) and the long jump (6.03m).\n\nAlso of note, the CHC girls competed at a Class 3 district meet on Saturday. See a related story.\n\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThomas Jefferson senior Kip Atteberry advanced to the Class 1 state meet in three individual events—the 800, 1600 and 3200.\n\nAtteberry finished fourth in all three events. He recorded a time of 2;03 in the 800 in 2:03, finished the 1600 in 4:39 and the 3200 in 10:41.\n\nTyler Brouhard advanced in two events, as the senior was fourth in both the 100-meter dash (11.87) and the 200 (23.93 seconds).\n\nTJ’s Jay Ball just missed advancing in both the discus (fifth) and shot put (sixth).\n\nLike the TJ boys, Thomas Jefferson’s girls advanced in five events.\n\nThe Cavaliers fared well in the field events. Nico Carlson won the high jump (1.48m), Gabriella Hiebert took second in the long jump (4.63m) and tied for second in the high jump (1.4m), while Lannah Grigg placed third in the discus (29.96m) and Avery Hocker finished fourth in the triple jump (9.52m).\n\nAlso advancing was Macie Shifferd, who was second in the 3200 (13:59).\n\nThe TJ girls just missed qualifying in the 4×800 after finishing fifth. The Cavaliers were also sixth in the 4×100.\n\nThomas Jefferson’s girls finished fourth in the team standings, while the TJ boys were sixth.\n\nMCAULEY CATHOLIC HIGHLIGHTS\n\nMcAuley Catholic junior Kendall Ramsey won two events in the girls meet, the 3200 in 12:27 and the 1600 in 5:50.\n\nOn the boys side, McAuley senior Joe Staton finished fourth in the pole vault (2.87m) and sophomore Roscoe Miller placed fourth in the javelin (36.06m) to give the Warriors a pair of individual qualifiers.\n\nMcAuley’s boys finished fifth in three relays, as the 4×100, the 4×400 and the 4×800 all just missed qualifying. Also, Michael Parrigon just missed advancing in two events, as he was fifth in the 1600 and sixth in the 800.\n\nMcAuley’s boys were 11th in the standings and the McAuley girls were 13th.\n\nOTHER HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe Class 1 team champions were the Appleton City girls and Hermitage boys.\n\nSarcoxie’s girls and Stockton’s boys won the team titles in Class 2.\n\nIn Class 2, Diamond’s Zachary Roughton won the 300 hurdles and was the runner-up in the 110 hurdles.\n\nJasper’s Crystal Smith won four girls events in Class 2 — the 200, the 100 hurdles, the 300 hurdles and the high jump.\n\nWinning events for Sarcoxie were Ariel Wilson (girls 400) and Jaron Malotte (boys 110 hurdles).\n\nThere was plenty of suspense in the air when the final event of the Class 1 District 5 track meet concluded on Saturday night at Mountain Grove High School.\n\nThree boys squads — Lockwood, Thomas Jefferson and McAuley Catholic — were all in the hunt for a team championship near the end of the meet.\n\nAnd when the dust settled, and thanks to a strong finish in the 4×400-meter relay, McAuley Catholic was the squad celebrating when the final team scores were announced.\n\nFor the Warriors, a feeling of anxiousness quickly turned into a feeling of pure joy.\n\nMcAuley finished with 94 points to capture the team championship, while runner-up Thomas Jefferson had 93 points and Lockwood finished third with 90.\n\n“In MoMileSplit’s virtual meet, we were fourth or fifth, so it wasn’t supposed to happen on paper,” McAuley coach Andy Youngworth said. “And there were six events we didn’t compete in. But you never know. I’m really pleased. We really competed well. I’m just really happy for these kids. I know the kids are excited.\n\n“It was just one point…that’s what it came down to,” Youngworth added. “Thomas Jefferson has a good team and they beat us at the conference meet. TJ’s coach Clayton Carnahan came over even before it was announced that we won and congratulated us. I thought that showed a lot of class. I appreciated that.”\n\nThe district championship is the first in school history for the McAuley boys track program.\n\nNow in his second year at the helm of the McAuley program, Youngworth noted it was a rewarding experience to watch his team not only celebrate a district championship, but also make history.\n\n“I’ve done this for a long time,” the veteran coach said. “There have been other things I’ve been involved with that have brought a lot of enjoyment, but this is way up there because it wasn’t supposed to happen.”\n\nYoungworth said McAuley’s previous best finish at a district meet was a third place showing in 2014.\n\n“One of our goals this season was to win the conference,” Youngworth said. “That’s hard to do because College Heights is really good and really deep. The second goal was to win a district championship. It’s always been one of our goals. This group has bought in from Day 1. I’m really happy for the kids and I’m hoping this is something the program can build on.”\n\nYoungworth said he was able to check the live results online a few times throughout the meet to see how the team standings were looking.\n\n“We were kind of hanging around all meet,” Youngworth said. “Every time I checked the live results we’d be in third or second and not that far off from first.\n\n“After the two-mile, we were nine points out of first place behind Thomas Jefferson and we were tied with Lockwood. Thomas Jefferson didn’t have an entry in the 4×400. So we were fortunate we had those four kids running the mile relay.”\n\nThe Warriors’ seed time in the 4×400 was 3:50, but McAuley’s foursome of Alex Bohachick, Dylan Taffner, Jack Jones and Michael Parrigon recorded a winning time of 3:41.\n\nTheir win, which delivered 10 points, put the Warriors in first place in the team standings.\n\nAt the district meet, the top four finishers in each event qualified for Saturday’s Class 1 Sectional 3 meet.\n\nMcAuley’s boys recorded 11 top-four performances in 10 events, with multiple qualifiers in one event.\n\nThe Warriors won three events, finished second in three others, had a pair of third-place showings and took fourth in three events.\n\n“We scored points in 13 of the 19 events,” Youngworth noted. “Every kid who competed for the boys team scored a point and will be in an event on Saturday. I’m not sure that’s ever happened before on one of my teams…every kid who competed at districts will compete at sectionals.”\n\nThe showing in the 4×400 capped a stellar day in the relays for the Warriors.\n\nMcAuley’s 4×800 relay team of Bohachick, Connor Taffner, Drew Zeb and Trae Veer took first in 9:18\n\nThe team’s 4×100 of Ethan Stabb, Jones, Dylan Taffner and Bohachick finished second in 49.93 and the 4×200 of Stabb, Staton, Dylan Taffner and Tripp Miller placed fourth in 1:49.\n\nJoe Staton won the pole vault with a clearance of 11-4.5.\n\nParrigon finished second in the 1600 in 4:47 and third in the 800 in 2:06, while Bohachick finished third in the 400 in 54.39 and Veer placed fourth in the 3200 in 11:14.\n\nThe Warriors had two of the top four in the javelin, as Roscoe Miller was the runner-up (113-8) and Max Anreder was fourth (108-10).\n\nTwo Warriors finished fifth in their events, Jones in the high jump and Veer in the triple jump. Anreder finished seventh in the discus, Drew took seventh in the 1600 and Connor Taffner was eighth in the 800.\n\nAnd although they missed qualifying for the sectional, all of those points were crucial for the team.\n\n“It’s not just the first places that win you meets, it’s the sixth, seventh and eighth places that help you do it,” Youngworth noted.\n\nRAMSEY LEADS MCAULEY GIRLS\n\nMcAuley Catholic junior Kendall Ramsey advanced to the sectional in three events.\n\nRamsey won two events, the 1600 in 5:47 and the 3200 in 13:08. Ramsey was the runner-up in the 800 with a time of 2:42.\n\n“Kendall ran well and competed well,” Youngworth said. “She ran a PR in the 800. She was solid in the 3200 and the 1600. I’m excited for her.
