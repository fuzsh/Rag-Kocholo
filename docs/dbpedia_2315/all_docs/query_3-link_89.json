        "text": "( Cincinnati, OH ) – Beginning fall of 2018, Mother of Mercy High School and McAuley High School will merge into a new Catholic, Mercy high school called Mercy McAuley High.\n\nThe new school will be located on Oakwood Ave. on the campus that currently houses McAuley.\n\nMcAuley and Mother of Mercy will continue to operate as they do now for the remainder of the current school year and for 2017-2018. When that school year ends, Mercy McAuley High School will officially be established.\n\nThe Sisters of Mercy sponsor the schools and made the decision about their future.\n\n“These days, we find ourselves facing a shifting reality in our high schools here,” Sister Jane Hotstream, president of the Sisters of Mercy said. “A declining pool of potential students is impacting enrollment now and will continue to do so in the future. This is a situation affecting Catholic schools nationwide, as well as here in Cincinnati.”\n\n“Our primary concern in making this decision is the well-being of the young women we serve, and our goal is to offer affordable and sustainable Catholic, Mercy education to our current students and future generations. A healthy enrollment provides a solid platform for making that vision a reality by creating opportunities for expansion of curriculum and activities for years to come,” Sister Jane explained.\n\nEarlier today, the sisters shared the news in person with the faculties and staffs and then with students at McAuley and at Mercy simultaneously.\n\nThe sisters have created three opportunities for parents, students, faculty and others to share questions and comments:\n\n• Face-to-face meetings with parents and students according to grade level beginning Mon., March 6, at each school.\n\n• The Mercy McAuley Hotline staffed by Cincinnati Sisters of Mercy. The number is 513-354-5054 and will operate Fri., March 3, as well as Mon., March 6 through Fri., March 10, from 9 a.m.-6 p.m.\n\n• An email box, MercyMcAuleyHS@mercysc.org, where people may leave questions or comments 24 hours a day, starting immediately.\n\n“We recognize this change is difficult and emotional for the communities of Mother of Mercy and of McAuley, and we understand that everyone who loves these schools—especially the girls—will need our understanding and support in the days and weeks to come,” said Sister Jane. “We wish to thank the girls who received this news with grace and a maturity beyond their years this morning. They keep the spirit of Catherine McAuley alive each day and we know they will carry that spirit into the future.”"
