This is huge for us, as it stretches out the defense and opens things up in the middle for Libby Fanning. Allie Stout also had two 3s and several layups in transition. Kinley Marsh and Molly Long gave us some really good minutes in the post tonight. We have a tough matchup with Miller on Thursday, but I like how our young team is developing.”\n\nThe Cougars will meet Miller at 7:30 on Thursday night at Diamond High School.\n\nThe other semifinal will feature Diamond vs. Sarcoxie at 6 p.m.\n\nLIBERAL 57, THOMAS JEFFERSON 27\n\nThomas Jefferson suffered its first loss of the season to Liberal on Tuesday night inside the TJ Fieldhouse.\n\nWith the loss, the Cavaliers fall to 2-1 on the season.\n\nLiberal led 17-11 at the end of the first quarter, but the visitors extended their lead to 36-14 by halftime.\n\nThe Bulldogs were up 52-15 by the end of the third period.\n\nGabbi Hiebert led Thomas Jefferson in scoring with 14 points, while Lannah Grigg added 11 in the setback.

I’m very pleased with our play this early in the year.”\n\nThe Warriors were clinging to a 16-15 lead after the first quarter, but McAuley outscored Sarcoxie 16-3 in the game-changing second quarter for a 32-18 halftime advantage.\n\nMcAuley held a 43-28 lead at the end of the third quarter.\n\nAlex Bohachick scored 14 points to lead the Warriors, while Rocco Bazzano-Joseph added 13, Michael Parrigon had 11 and Bradley Wagner scored 10.\n\nMatthew Swayne scored 17 points to lead Sarcoxie and Garrett Smith added 10.\n\nMcAuley (2-0) meets El Dorado Springs (1-0) at 6 p.m. on Wednesday in the tourney semifinals.\n\nEL DORADO SPRINGS 79, THOMAS JEFFERSON 29\n\nDIAMOND, Mo. — El Dorado Springs took control early in Monday’s win over Thomas Jefferson at the Gem City Classic at Diamond High School.\n\nThe Bulldogs built a 23-8 lead by the end of the opening frame and held a comfortable 47-17 advantage at halftime.\n\nKohl Thurman scored 10 points and hit a pair of 3-pointers to lead the Cavaliers (0-3), while Jack Twiss chipped in seven points.\n\nThree players scored in double figures for El Dorado Springs, as Landon Murry poured in 32 points, Joe Gordon had 21 and Rees McCullough added 13.\n\nThomas Jefferson meets Sarcoxie on Wednesday at the tourney.\n\nOTHER SCORES\n\nMarshfield 66, College Heights Christian 49\n\nCarl Junction 87, Hollister 45\n\nGIRLS HOOPS: Thomas Jefferson rolls in Showalter’s debut as head coach\n\nLindsey Showalter earned victory No. 1 as Thomas Jefferson’s head girls basketball coach, as the Cavaliers rolled to a 63-35 win over Exeter on Monday night in the 2023-24 season opener at the TJ Fieldhouse.\n\nThe Cavaliers led 11-3 at the end of the first quarter and the hosts held a commanding 36-13 lead at halftime.\n\nThomas Jefferson held a comfortable 51-23 advantage heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThree players scored in double figures for the Cavaliers.\n\nSenior Gabbi Hiebert poured in 26 points and hit four 3-pointers to lead the way, while junior Lannah Grigg contributed 17 points and senior Sarah Mueller scored 10 points and knocked down a pair of 3-pointers.\n\nAlso for the Cavaliers, Presley Long scored four points, Macie Shifferd had three, Alexis Stamps added two and Vivian Sharp chipped in one point.\n\nA graduate of Carl Junction High School and Missouri Southern State University, Showalter is in her first season as TJ’s head coach after assisting last year.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1-0) hosts Bronaugh at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nBOYS HOOPS: Thomas Jefferson drops season opener\n\nThe Thomas Jefferson boys basketball team suffered a 52-37 setback to visiting Exeter on Monday night at the TJ Fieldhouse.\n\nIt was the opener of the 2023-24 season for the Cavaliers.\n\nThe Cavaliers led 12-11 at the end of the first quarter, but the Tigers outscored the hosts 14-7 in the second period.\n\nThe third quarter was nearly even, but Exeter held a 35-28 advantage heading into the final frame.

And last year’s senior class led the way as Thomas Jefferson went 21-7 overall, 5-1 in conference play and advanced all the way to the Class 1 quarterfinals.\n\nWith that, the Cavaliers will rely on a large group of underclassmen this season.\n\nTwo players return with prior varsity experience—junior forward Ethan Renger and sophomore forward/center Kohl Thurman.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Thurman averaged 2.6 points and three rebounds a game last winter, while the 6-2 Renger averaged one point and one rebound a contest.\n\nSophomores Jaxx Wisdom (G), Kyler Beard (G) and Trenton Farley (G) and freshmen Jack Twiss (PG), Spencer Long (F), Yousuf Mokhtar (F) and Simon Studer (G) are players who are expected to compete for varsity playing time.\n\nCoach Myers noted that Twiss is the leading candidate to take over the starting point guard duties.\n\nAdditionally, Myers said he expects Wisdom, Long and Mokhtar to compete for starting roles.\n\nWhile the young and untested Cavaliers may experience some growing pains along the way, Coach Myers is confident his squad will make steady progress throughout the ’23 campaign.\n\n“We are in a rebuilding phase as the old saying goes,” Myers said. “We have graduated several key players over the past two seasons and will have to look to young players this year to fill those roles. While we will likely lean on several freshmen this season, the expectation is that we will get better as the season goes on. Though young, this group seems hungry to get better.”\n\nOf course, overcoming so much inexperience will be the team’s main key to success this winter.\n\n“Our youth and inexperience will be a big area of concern for us,” Myers said. “These kids are going to have to trust the process, and not get discouraged as we battle through the season.\n\n“I’m fully confident this group will work hard and continue to push for success – whether that success is found this season or in future seasons is yet to be determined.”\n\nThe Cavaliers will open the 2023-24 season at home against Exeter on Nov. 20.\n\nSTATE CROSS COUNTRY: McAuley Catholic, College Heights runners earn all-state honors\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. — McAuley Catholic junior Michael Parrigon finished fourth in Class 1 to lead a strong area contingent at the 49th MSHSAA Cross Country Championships on Friday morning at the Gans Creek Cross Country Course.\n\nParrigon toured the 5K course in 16 minutes, 28 seconds.\n\nFinishing ahead of Parrigon were West Nodaway’s Riley Blay (15:48), Marion C. Early’s Landon Duchscherer (15:55) and Dora’s Cade Nold (16:26). Blay won for the third straight season.\n\nParrigon’s showing is the best state finish in program history for the McAuley boys. Max Ostmeyer finished 17th in 2016 and Parrigon was 21st last year.\n\n“I thought he could be in the top five,” McAuley Catholic coach Andy Youngworth said. “The kid from Dora is really good. And I’m not going to use this as an excuse, but it’s a fact that Michael played two soccer matches this week, including last night. Max Anreder also had to deal with that. Both ran well. I thought Michael was in a good position for most of the race.”\n\nIn addition to Parrigon, three other Joplin area runners finished in the top 30 to earn all-state honors in the Class 1 boys race.\n\nJasper junior Leland Harris placed 20th in 17:40, while McAuley’s duo of Trae Veer (17:42) and Will Mollnow (17:43) finished 22nd and 23rd, respectively. Veer is a sophomore and Mollnow is just a freshman.\n\n“Will passed 11 or 12 guys in the last 400 meters to medal,” Youngworth noted. “He had a great finish.”\n\nThomas Jefferson had two athletes competing — freshman Liam Cook finished 34th in 18:03 and junior Braden Honeywell-Lynch was 45th in 18:12.\n\nAlso competing for McAuley were Alex Bohachick (102nd), Connor Taffner (111th), Cliff Nolan (137th) and Max Anreder (141st).\n\nThe Warriors finished fifth out of 15 teams in the Class 1 standings with 136 points. The top four teams take home a trophy.\n\nFor the Warriors, it was a memorable day.\n\n“We had three state medalists and that’s the first time that’s happened in school history,” Youngworth said. “Last year we had two medalists and that was the first time that had happened. I’m really pleased.\n\n“I think the boys were disappointed we took fifth. We were six points away from fourth and nine points away from third. Going in, I felt like there were three or four schools that could finish anywhere from third to sixth. But I thought our kids ran well. We worked really hard this year, from August 7th to today. And that doesn’t include the time in the summer. We put in a lot of time and effort and I think it showed.”\n\nOf note, all of McAuley’s boys will return next season, as there are no seniors on the roster.\n\nHermitage (74), Van Buren (97), Oak Ridge (127) and Vienna (130) were the top four teams.\n\nThere were 170 runners in the boys race.\n\nCLASS 1 GIRLS\n\nLiberal freshman Ally Barton finished third in the Class 1 girls race with a time of 20:17, leading the Bulldogs to a runner-up finish in the team standings.\n\nSouth Nodaway’s Mya Wray was the Class 1 champion in 19:11 and Stoutland’s Mallory Shaw was the runner-up in 20:15.\n\nEarning all-state recognition with their respective top-30 showings, McAuley Catholic senior Kendall Ramsey finished ninth in 20:46, while Liberal junior Taylor Swarnes was 10th in 20:53 and McAuley freshman Olivia Parrigon placed 11th in 20:56 to give the Warriors five all-state performances on the day.\n\nLiberal’s Abby Barton finished 30th and teammate Bailey Couch was 34th, while Thomas Jefferson’s Macie Shifferd finished 40th and teammate Sarah Mueller was 52nd.\n\nAlso competing for McAuley were Riley Sears (69th), Marbellie Villanueva (91st) and Samantha Perrin (129th).\n\nThe top four teams were Chadwick (60), Liberal (98), East Carter (112) and Paris (130).\n\nThe runner-up showing is the best state finish in school history for the Liberal girls, who were fourth in 2017.\n\nMcAuley finished eighth in the standings with 169 points.\n\n“Our girls really had a great meet,” Youngworth said. “We went from 13th last year to eighth this year. Olivia finishing 11th as a freshman is great. It was Kendall’s fourth state appearance and second medal. She actually ran faster this year than last year but finished one place lower this year. There are a lot of good runners in Class 1. I’m proud of all of our girls. Riley Sears had a good day. That’s another freshman who put together some really good workouts and those translated into faster times at the meets. Marbellie and Sam ran well and will both be back. Kendall is our only senior. You can’t replace her.

Marbellie Villanueva struggled a bit in the middle of the race but finished well. Sam Perrin ran another good race and continues to gain confidence.”\n\nThomas Jefferson had a pair of qualifiers, as junior Macie Shifferd (22:40) and senior Sarah Mueller (22:53) finished 14th and 15th, respectively.\n\nCLASS 2\n\nThe College Heights Christian boys had three individual state qualifiers in Class 2, as Colton McMillan finished 11th in 18:27, Owen Horton placed 19th in 19:11 and Connor Jordan took 21st in 19:17.\n\nOther local qualifiers were Diamond’s Wyatt Housh (14th), Purdy’s Logan Manwarren (16th) and Jayden Griffis (22nd) and Pierce City’s Joseph Leavitt (29th).\n\nThe top four boys teams were New Covenant (57), Mansfield (83), Alton (85) and Southwest (106).

It was a hot, sunny day, but I thought our kids handled it well. I was very proud of our student body who came out and cheered us on today.”\n\nThe McAuley boys repeated as conference champs with 31 points. College Heights was second with 38 and Thomas Jefferson (55) was the third team with a full squad competing.\n\n“Our boys team had some pressure on them this year, as we were the defending conference champion,” Youngworth said. “College Heights and Thomas Jefferson have some very good runners, and I knew we would have to run a great race in order to win.”\n\nMcAuley junior Michael Parrigon was the individual conference champion, as he crossed the line at 16:41, more than a minute faster than the runner-up.\n\nCollege Heights Christian’s Colton McMillan took second in 17:46, McAuley’s Trae Veer was third in 17:48, Thomas Jefferson’s Braden Honeywell-Lynch took fourth in 17:54 and CHC’s Connor Jordan placed fifth in 18:32.\n\nFinishing sixth through 10th were McAuley’s Will Mollnow, Thomas Jefferson’s Liam Cook, CHC’s Owen Horton, McAuley’s Connor Taffner and CHC’s Caleb Quade.\n\nRounding out the top 15 were TJ’s Spencer Long, McAuley’s Alex Bohachick, CHC’s Steven Calandro, Wheaton’s Jayson Peterson and CHC’s Drew Sawkins.\n\nMcAuley’s Cliff Nolan, TJ’s duo of Ashan Appuhamy and Jack Twiss, McAuley’s Max Anreder and Exeter’s Josue Alcaraz completed the top 20.\n\nYoungworth, who noted the Ozark 7 schools appreciate MSSU allowing the meet to be held on campus at the Rutledge course, said his boys team performed well overall.\n\n“Michael Parrigon continues to run well, racing alone for the bulk of the meet,” Youngworth said. “Trae Veer finished third, beating some good kids. Trae continues to improve each week, and just runs very smart races. Will Mollnow earned all-conference recognition, as did Connor Taffner. Alex Bohachick finished as our No. 5 and continues to improve after a long illness kept him out of competition for a few weeks. Cliff Nolan ran a solid race as our No. 6 and dropped 45 seconds from last year. Max Anreder rounded out our top seven.”\n\nThe postseason awaits for the Warriors.\n\n“We will face a very tough Hermitage at districts next weekend, they are the defending Class 1 state champions,” Youngworth said. “We will have to have great races from all of our kids in order to challenge them.”\n\nGIRLS HIGHLIGHTS\n\nMcAuley’s girls edged defending champion College Heights Christian by just three points, 26-29. The Warriors had four top-10 finishers, while the Cougars had three runners in the top five.\n\n“I think the surprise of the day was our girls defeating College Heights, our first-ever girls conference championship,” Youngworth said. “They are very well-coached and were the defending conference champions, but I challenged the girls a little bit this week, telling them they had nothing to lose by being aggressive and running to win.”\n\nMcAuley freshman Olivia Parrigon was the conference champion with a time of 21:07.\n\nCollege Heights Christian junior Marla Anderegg was the runner-up in 21:37 and McAuley senior Kendall Ramsey took third in 21:59.\n\nCHC’s Jesalin Bever and Lilly Royer finished fourth and fifth, while Thomas Jefferson’s duo of Macie Shifferd and Sarah Mueller were sixth and seventh.\n\nExeter’s Kaylyn Weiser finished eighth and McAuley’s tandem of Riley Sears and Marbellie Villanueva finished ninth and 10th, respectively.\n\nAlso of note, College Heights’ Madi Carson finished 13th, McAuley’s Samantha Perrin was 14th, CHC’s Katie Moss placed 17th, CHC’s Lilly Lackey took 19th and McAuley’s Genevieve Billings finished 20th.\n\nYoungworth noted he was proud of how the girls team performed.\n\n“Olivia Parrigon is our first-ever conference champion, and she ran most of the race with Kendall Ramsey and was able to pull away in the last 800 meters,” Youngworth said. “I think the key to our win though was the work of our No. 3, No. 4 and No. 5 runners. Riley Sears ran a career PR and earned all-conference honors, as did Marbellie Villanueva, who ran a PR for the season. Our No. 5 was Samantha Perrin, who finished 14th, but dropped over three minutes from last year’s race. We are starting to run with more confidence, and I look forward to the opportunity to see them compete at districts next week.”\n\nOZARK 7 CONFERENCE MEET\n\nBoys team standings: McAuley Catholic 31, College Heights Christian 38, Thomas Jefferson 55.\n\nGirls team standings: McAuley Catholic 26, College Heights 29.\n\nFULL RESULTS: Ozark 7 Conference Meet 2023 – Meet Results (milesplit.com)\n\nSTATE TENNIS: Carl Junction doubles team takes 3rd; TJ’s Ding finishes 7th in singles\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Mo. — Carl Junction’s duo of Naiyah Wurdeman and Jenna Besperat finished third in the Class 2 doubles bracket on Friday at the 2023 MSHSAA Girls Tennis Championships at the Cooper Tennis Complex.\n\nIn the third-place match, Wurdeman and Besperat ended the 2023 season on a high note by beating Springfield Catholic’s Hannah Lee and Britney Ung 6-1, 6-4.\n\nIn Thursday’s opening round, the Bulldogs defeated the St. Pius X duo of Chloe Kronlage and Brooke Madden 6-0, 6-0.\n\nIn the quarterfinal round, Wurdeman and Besperat topped Grain Valley’s Brooklyn Spencer and Emma Thiessen 4-6, 6-2, 10-7.\n\nIn the semifinals on Friday morning, Parkway North’s Yvonne Shannon-Emily Koo defeated Wurdeman-Besperat 7-6, 6-1.

I’m excited and I’m just proud of the girls. When we got moved up to Class 2 we didn’t know what we were getting into. I felt like we had a good team, but it was new territory for us once we got into the district tournament. And we had a tough district. You don’t have this kind of an opportunity too often. It tickles me that all of the girls are going to get to have the state finals experience.”\n\nIt was the second straight historic win for the program, as Thomas Jefferson secured its first-ever Class 2 district championship last week.\n\nNow, a berth in the state semifinals awaits.\n\n“I’m really excited,” Thomas Jefferson senior Allison Ding said. “My internals are about to implode. That’s how I’d describe how I’m feeling right now. We’ve gotten close several times before, and this year, we finally did it. I knew we had a good team, so I knew it was possible. I was really hoping we’d make it this year. I envisioned it in my brain so many times, so now that it’s here, it’s unreal.”\n\nWith Monday’s victory, the Cavaliers are guaranteed of bringing home a state trophy.\n\n“That’s a big deal, especially in Class 2,” Brumfield said. “It’s our first time making it to the semifinals for the girls program, and we did it in Class 2, so that’s a nice bonus.”\n\nPlaying on their home courts on a sunny afternoon, the Cavaliers started off the dual on a positive note by winning all three doubles matches.\n\nAt No. 1 doubles, TJ’s Ding and Jeanna Jeyaraj edged Addison Mayne-Olivia Holbrook 9-7.\n\nThe TJ duo of Esther Yang and Kyla Yang defeated Maggie McBratney-Lily Fish 8-0 at No. 2 doubles, while Thomas Jefferson’s Warda Morsy and Mayson Solum topped Delaney Bachmann-Lucy McClain 8-3.\n\nBrumfield noted it’s always crucial to have the advantage after doubles play.\n\n“Doubles went great,” Brumfield said. “Our No. 2 and No. 3 doubles teams have been really strong for us all season. Our No. 1 doubles team has struggled a little bit at times this season. But we know we have two good players at No. 1 doubles. They put it together last week and they put it together today. They stepped up when it mattered most.”\n\nThe first to five wins dual match ended when the Cavaliers earned two singles victories.\n\nIn completed singles matches, Thomas Jefferson’s Solum defeated Bachmann 6-0, 6-2, and Kyla Yang beat McClain 6-1, 6-0.\n\nAlso of note, Ding was leading Mayne 6-0, 4-1, and Morsy was beating Fish 6-1, 5-0 when the match was halted.\n\nThe Cavaliers are now 14-0 in dual matches this fall.\n\nBrumfield noted his student-athletes put in a lot of extra work over the summer in preparation for the season.\n\nNow, that hard work has paid off.\n\n“All of them have been playing a lot of tennis together, and all that extra work pays off,” Brumfield said. “They all have good attitudes. We’ve talked about the mental aspects of the game all season…dealing with pressure and things like that. But the effort and the time they’ve put in has been a big key to success…no doubt.”\n\nThe undefeated Cavaliers will meet Grain Valley (23-2) in the semifinals at 9 a.m. on Oct. 20 at the Cooper Tennis Complex in Springfield. Grain Valley defeated Springfield Catholic 5-1.\n\n“We just have to go out and play and not worry about who we’re playing,” Brumfield said. “I want them to play hard, play their best and enjoy the moment.”\n\nDING FINISHING CAREER AT STATE\n\nA senior standout, Ding will compete at the individual state singles tournament on Thursday in Springfield.\n\n“I just want to go out there, have fun and play good tennis,” said Ding, a returning state medalist who finished eighth in singles as a junior and seventh as a sophomore.\n\nFollowing the individual state tourney, Ding will conclude her prep tennis career alongside her teammates at the team state tournament.\n\n“All of us are tight knit, we hang out a lot,” Ding said of the Cavaliers. “And we play tennis all the time. We’re just really connected. We’re like a close family. And at state, we’re all going to do our best.”\n\nGIRLS TENNIS: Thomas Jefferson wins 4th straight district title, its 1st in Class 2\n\nWinning district championships is nothing new to the Thomas Jefferson girls tennis program.\n\nBut this year’s district title was different, even a bit more significant for the Cavaliers.\n\nWhen top-seeded Thomas Jefferson defeated third-seeded Notre Dame de Sion 5-1 on Wednesday in the championship match of the Class 2 District 7 girls tennis tournament it gave the Cavaliers a fourth straight district crown — the program’s first in Class 2.\n\nAfter winning three straight district titles in Class 1, the Cavaliers were bumped up to Class 2 this year due to MSHSAA’s championship factor for private schools.\n\n“We’re pretty excited about it,” Thomas Jefferson coach Tom Brumfield said. “We made school history today. This is the first district championship in Class 2 that the girls program has ever won. It gives us a good feeling. We’ve shown that we can compete at the next level. And this was one of the hardest districts we’ve been in. It’s a good feeling.”\n\nPlaying on their home courts, the Cavaliers started Wednesday’s dual on a positive note by winning two of the three doubles matches.\n\nAt No. 1 doubles, Thomas Jefferson’s Allison Ding and Jeanna Jeyaraj defeated Anna McGeeney-Abigail Duethman 8-5 and TJ’s Esther Yang and Kyla Yang topped Elizabeth Vance-Lauryn Murphy 8-4 at No. 2 doubles.\n\nAt No. 3 doubles, Notre Dame de Sion’s Claire Weber-Katherine Spenceri defeated Warda Morsy and Mayson Solum 8-5.\n\n“We started off pretty strong in doubles,” Brumfield noted. “Our No. 1 doubles team picked it up and really came through today. They picked up our No. 3 doubles team, which usually wins. And it’s always big to get up 2-1. It was a great start.”\n\nThe match ended when the Cavaliers secured three wins in singles play.\n\nMorsy defeated Murphy 6-1, 6-1, while Solum beat Weber 6-3, 6-3 and Kyla Yang topped Spenceri 6-2, 6-3.\n\n“All the girls did a great job,” Brumfield said. “We picked each other up. The girls just took care of business today. It’s a big win for us and a big win for the program, so we’re pretty excited.”\n\nNotre Dame de Sion knocked off second-seeded Carl Junction in the semifinals.

The team is looking forward to having another chance of making another run for the final four.\n\n“I have high expectations for this group of girls,” Brumfield added. “They were very successful last year and that year of experience behind them should give them a lot more confidence. We had a young team last year with a lot of 10th graders. I believe we’ll see improvement in all areas of their game. The fact that we return all but one player from last year doesn’t hurt.”\n\nA senior, Ding placed eighth in the singles bracket at last year’s Class 1 state tournament. Ding also earned a state medal as a sophomore, finishing seventh.\n\nJeanna Jeyaraj, a junior, is also a returning state-qualifier in singles play.\n\nAlso back with prior starting experience are juniors Kyla Yang, Warda Morsy and Mayson Solum. Yang was the team’s No. 3 singles player a season ago, while Morsy played No. 4 singles and Solum was the No. 6 player.\n\n“All three of these girls were very solid for us last year and have been working on their game during the offseason,” Brumfield said. “I’m excited to have them back and to see their improvements.”\n\nSenior Emalee Ro returns after playing No. 7 singles last year.\n\nAlso back with varsity experience are sophomores Haley Orr and Jeanna Joseph.\n\n“Haley and Jeanna were freshmen last year and have been playing and doing lessons the past few years,” Brumfield noted. “I’m looking forward to seeing how much they have progressed. They’ll be pushing for a spot in the top six.”\n\nThe team’s lone loss to graduation was Jessica Joseph, who played No. 5 singles last year.\n\nFreshmen Esther Yang and Audrey Bowles are promising newcomers.\n\n“Esther has been working hard the past few years improving herself,” Brumfield commented. ” She’ll be a big challenger for a top spot on the team. Looking forward to seeing her in the mix. Audrey has also been working on her tennis game during the summer. Audrey will be a nice addition to the team.”\n\nBrumfield is confident the Cavaliers will be able to field a strong lineup.\n\n“The strength of our team will be the depth of our lineup,” Brumfield said. “We will be solid 1-6 and beyond. The bottom part of the lineup is very important in team play. Being strong at the 4-7 spots can put you over the top in many matches. I believe we can be strong there and we should also be strong at the top of our lineup.”\n\nHeading into any season, an area of concern is always injuries.\n\n“We need to make sure we stay healthy and hopefully avoid injuries,” Brumfield said. “Injuries can always mess up a lineup when they are playing not only singles, but also doubles.”\n\nBrumfield noted the Cavaliers will move from Class 1 to Class 2 this year.\n\n“A big unknown factor at this time is the fact that we will be bumped up to Class 2,” he said. “We’ll have to wait and see where they send us at district time. This will be uncharted territory for the girls program. I’m sure we’ll see a new group of teams that we’ll have to go through. I would feel much better playing the teams from last year that we are familiar with. With that said, I also feel this group can compete at the Class 2 level. We’ll take the approach that it really doesn’t make a difference what class we’re in.”\n\nBrumfield feels the Cavaliers have the pieces in place to put together a very successful season.\n\n“We’ll need to take each match one at a time and be confident we can compete at district time, wherever we are sent,” Brumfield said. “This is a great group of girls that have been working hard over the offseason while looking forward to this season. As long as the girls stay focused and enjoy the game without putting pressure upon themselves, the season should be a lot of fun and one for them to remember.”\n\nThomas Jefferson hosts Nevada at 4:30 on Aug. 31."
