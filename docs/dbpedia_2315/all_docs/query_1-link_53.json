        "text": "Welcome\n\nThank you for your interest in the McAuley Sixth Form. We are delighted that you are exploring the possibility of becoming a student here.\n\nThis is an exciting time to join us. Students continue to celebrate sparkling A level results which continue to be amongst the very best in the area. COVID-19 should not diminish the achievements of the ‘class of 2021’ who left with a fantastic average grade B- and students' performance in vocational subjects are outstanding with an average grade Distinction +. The vast majority of students progressed onto their chosen pathways in employment or university including Russell Group institutions.\n\nWe pride ourselves on exemplary pastoral care. You will be treated as an adult and flourish as a confident, independent person in your own right. This is your Time to Shine and you have an opportunity to leave us having the qualifications and personal qualities needed to lead and succeed in whatever field is right for you.\n\nWe have broadened our curriculum. We have recently added Applied Law, Digital Games Development, Applied Psychology, Child’sPlay, Learning and Development, a 1 week Work Experience in Y12, British Sign Language, First Aid and an excellent one year Level 2 Foundation Year Course. We aim to give you the option to continue your education with us (or join us if coming from elsewhere) whatever your starting point.\n\nOur Flexible Learning approach allows you to develop time management skills and promotes your sense of independence and responsibility. This runs side by side with a Mentor Access Point (MAP) program whereby you have a personal mentor who will regularly meet with you 1:1.\n\nHighly dedicated, experienced tutors are committed to helping you develop your talents in all aspects of academic, cultural, spiritual and social life. There are plenty of extra-curricular and leadership opportunities in music, performing arts, outdoor pursuits, DofE, Public Speaking, charitable events and many more. At McAuley, there really is something for everyone!\n\nWe welcome applications from students from all backgrounds. Whether you are of Catholic, different or no faith, we are sure that you will quickly form strong, lifelong friendships and feel part of the sixth form whether you are coming from Y11 or another school.\n\nWe hope our prospectus gives you a flavour of the McAuley Sixth Form Experience, details about our courses and how to apply. Of course, the best way to get a feel of our sixth form is to see us on a school day so please contact sixthform@mcauley.org.uk if you would like to arrange a visit.\n\nWe wish you every success in your GCSEs and very much look forward to welcoming you into the McAuley Sixth Form family."
