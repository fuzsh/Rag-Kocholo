        "text": "Electronic Arts, Inc., shortened to EA, is an American developer, marketer, publisher and distributor of video games founded by Trip Hawkings on May 28, 1982. They are the publisher of Titanfall, which was developed by Respawn Entertainment.\n\nHistory[]\n\nElectronic Arts was founded by Trip Hawkins in 1982. Originally, EA was a home computing game publisher. In the late 1980s, the company began developing games in-house and supported consoles by the early 1990s. EA later grew via acquisition of several successful developers. By the early 2000s, EA had become one of the world's largest third-party publishers. On May 4, 2011, EA reported $3.8 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending March 2011.\n\nEA began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site Pogo.com in 2001. In 2009 EA acquired the London-based social gaming startup Playfish, and in June 2011, EA launched Origin, an online service to sell downloadable games directly to consumers. In July 2011, EA announced that it had acquired PopCap Games, the company behind hits such as Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled."
