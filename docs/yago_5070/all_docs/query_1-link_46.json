        "text": "Barcelona, Spain, 27th February, 2023; William Murray “Trip” Hawkins III, founder and first CEO of Electronic Arts has become the latest Web2 behemoth to join the World of Web3, signing as Chief Strategy Officer for Games for a living, the Web3 gaming company that is revolutionising the gaming industry with an innovative business model and a new approach to Web3 gaming.\n\nThe American entrepreneur, who founded Electronic Arts, now the largest independent video game publisher in the world, will help Games for a living reach the masses by helping them deliver next-gen products and services that gamers and mass market consumers will benefit from and understand. The appointment of Mr Hawkins to the board and as CSO aims to provide valuable leadership and additional support to Games for a living on their journey to mass adoption, with his wealth of global experience and market penetration strategies.\n\n“I’m excited to begin my journey with Games for a living, leveraging new and emerging technologies to enhance performance and create exciting, immersive experiences for gamers”, Hawkins said. “I’m confident that blockchain, combined with our vision can create a new gaming paradigm for the benefit of all”. As Chief Strategy Officer, Trip expects content creators to increasingly use blockchain technology, adding, “We plan to do it in a way that helps enhance game performance and value for players while keeping things fun”.\n\nA major area for Games for a living to tackle is understanding and adoption of Web3 games overall. Mr Hawkins holds a bachelor’s degree from Harvard university and an MBA from Stanford, both earned with high honours. Before founding and leading Electronic Arts to their IPO, he worked closely with Steve Jobs to design and develop the fundamental methods by which the public would come to adopt the use of computers and the video games that followed.\n\nHawkins and Games for a living CEO, Manel Sort, worked together previously at Digital Chocolate. Sort is a highly experienced veteran of the gaming industry, boasting an impressive portfolio of more than 60 titles and a combined EBITDA of 1 billion. Previously serving as the FVP at Activision Blizzard King and General Manager of King Barcelona Studios, his titles generated more than $1 million per day. Furthermore, Sort provided models and strategies to improve both the marketing and gameplay of numerous games, the most notable being the world-renowned Candy Crush. The extended team at Games for a living also includes names such as Javier Leon, Emmy nominee and Goya award winner, and game titles like Commandos, Worms, and Diablo.\n\n\"We're very excited to have Trip join the Games for a living family as our Chief Strategy Officer,\" said Manel Sort, CEO of Games for a living. \"Trip is the father of modern video game publishing and one of the best visionaries in the games industry, to the extent that he was already talking about NFTs back in 2007 when I first met him. We're honored to have him on board to guide our strategy going forward, which I am sure will be a huge boost to our business and the future of blockchain gaming.\"\n\nGames for a living is revolutionising the gaming industry with an innovative business model and a new approach to Web3 gaming, and showing the world why Web3 takes gaming to the next level. Leveraging the power of esports and its passionate community, Games for a living is creating an ecosystem that will propel the industry into the future, unlocking the full potential of blockchain-based gaming.\n\n“Regardless of the recent birthing pains, blockchain as a technology holds a lot of potential, enabling enhanced experiences, verifiable proof of ownership and asset trading, as well as creating new opportunities for social interaction and innovative business models. We want to capitalise on that, not necessarily by forcing conventional gamers to hop on to the Web3 express, but by adding value to the gaming models that already exist”, Hawkins said."
