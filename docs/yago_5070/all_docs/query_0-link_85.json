        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe founder of Electronic Arts will join as co-founder and security chief of Games for a Living (GFAL).\n\nFormer Apple executive Trip Hawkins, who founded the company behind the best-selling sports videogame franchise \"FIFA\", is joining a Web3 startup, looking to take on top blockchain games like Axie Infinity.\n\nThe founder of Electronic Arts will join as co-founder and security chief of Games for a Living (GFAL), Hawkins told Reuters in an interview.\n\nGFAL publishes titles compatible with blockchain technology across consoles, personal computers and smartphones - commonly called Web3.\n\nInterest for Web3 gaming has risen over the past year as it is touted to attract more cryptocurrency users. Players can own, sell, and trade in-game goods in such games.\n\nHong Kong-based blockchain gaming developer Animoca Brands, which backs popular NFT game Axie Infinity, raised more than $500 million in 2022.\n\n\"Web3 is the bridge to the metaverse,\" Hawkins said on Thursday. \"And if we're going to make a metaverse, the economy of the metaverse has to be more like the real world.\"\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\nAlthough there are concerns around security as \"cyberwallets\" are more prone to hacking, developers are also looking to diversify their platforms amid stunted growth and high app-store fees.\n\nFounded in 2021 by former King executive Manel Sort, Barcelona-based GFAL had a post-money valuation of 13.2 million euros ($13.96 million) after its latest funding round last year.\n\nShein is back in India. Will this dim away Zara, H&M and Urbanic’s lustre?\n\nRight call or wrong? Factors that will decide investor return from Bharti’s BT deal\n\nFour critical reasons why India is rethinking its approach to China\n\nNeeraj Chopra, Manu Bhaker and Vinesh Phogat reach a new high in brand sponsorships. Will it sustain?\n\nAs economic growth worries MPC members, should RBI err on the side of inflation?\n\nMeals to movies: Zomato spices up menu with acquisition of Paytm’s ticketing biz\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
