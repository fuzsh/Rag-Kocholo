        "text": "we published a story today that's been bouncing around in my head for two years; in the last three weeks, the stars aligned: first, the realization: Games Production means something different in almost every studio... by talking to founders and production leaders at multiple startup studios, I saw that in some cases, one Producer role bore virtually no resemblance to the next. each executive's perspective was frequently informed by what the role looked like at whatever studio they started their career. all well and good, until I saw studios develop glaring gaps in their game dev process because the CEO assumed their Production team was responsible for X, and the Head of Production assumed Y. they were quite literally using the same words and assuming different meanings. in trying to unpack this problem, I did a lot of reading on the history of Games Production, which was quite literally invented by Trip Hawkins when he founded Electronic Arts (EA). and as fates would have it, Trip was just a few days away from publishing an excerpt from his upcoming book, on the origins of Games Production [link in comments]. today, just one week later, we've published our survey on the state(s) of Games Production [see link in comments below]. A MASSIVE thank you to Joe Tung, Elena Siegman, Yuliya Peshkova, Kenzie Paulus, Thomas Bourus, and many others who shared their earned secrets on this integral part of our industry. if you work anywhere in or near Games Production, or ASPIRE to, I highly encourage you to give it a read! with that, I'm curious: what does Production entail at your company?"
