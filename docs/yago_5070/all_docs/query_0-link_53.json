        "text": "Introduction to Acquired Podcast Season Four, Episode Seven\n\nThe podcast Acquired focuses on technology acquisitions and IPOs.\n\nBen Gilbert and David Rosenthal are the hosts.\n\nThe episode is a throwback to the year 1989, discussing how IPOs meant something different back then.\n\nThe episode features Trip Hawkins, founder of Electronic Arts (EA), and his journey from an early Apple employee to starting EA and other gaming companies.\n\n\"Welcome to season four, episode seven of Acquired, the podcast about technology acquisitions and ipos.\"\n\nThe quote introduces the episode's theme and the hosts, setting the stage for the discussion with Trip Hawkins.\n\nTrip Hawkins' Background\n\nTrip Hawkins worked at Apple Computer as the director of strategy and marketing until 1982.\n\nHe founded EA, took it public, and later started other companies like 3DO and Digital Chocolate.\n\nTrip is now a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\n\"Trip worked as an early employee at Apple Computer as the director of strategy and marketing until 1982 before starting EA, taking it public, and later moving on to start other companies in the gaming space, such as three D O and digital Chocolate.\"\n\nThe quote provides a brief overview of Trip Hawkins' career, highlighting his significant contributions to the gaming industry and his current academic role.\n\nThe Format of Acquired Podcast\n\nAcquired podcast narrates the history of companies from founding to acquisition or IPO.\n\nThe show includes analysis and judgment on the success of the transactions.\n\nThere is a second show for listeners interested in company building topics, offering deeper dives into subjects like product-market fit and venture capital.\n\n\"We walk through the history and facts of a company from founding all the way through an acquisition or ipo. Then we analyze and grade the transaction where we issue judgment on if that was a good idea or not.\"\n\nThis quote explains the structure of the Acquired podcast, emphasizing the blend of storytelling and analytical judgment.\n\nPilot is a sponsor of the Acquired podcast and provides accounting, tax, and bookkeeping services for startups and growth companies.\n\nThey are backed by prominent investors and focus on allowing companies to outsource non-core functions like accounting.\n\nPilot operates a company's entire financial stack and has experience with startups and scaling businesses.\n\n\"Pilot both sets up and operates your company's entire financial stack. So finance, accounting, tax, even CFO services like investor reporting from your general ledger all the way up to budgeting and financial sections of board decks.\"\n\nThe quote details the services offered by Pilot, showcasing their comprehensive approach to financial management for businesses.\n\nTrip Hawkins' Early Life and Interest in Games\n\nTrip Hawkins grew up in Southern California during the golden age of television.\n\nHe was a strategic thinker with a passion for sports and games, which at the time were pen-and-paper or board games.\n\nHawkins combined his love for sports strategy with his interest in games, leading to his fascination with math and statistics.\n\n\"I found that back in the 1960s, some game designers had invented these cardboard dice games... I just kind of discovered that I found math and statistics fascinating.\"\n\nThe quote reflects on Hawkins' early interest in games and how it sparked his appreciation for math and statistics, which would later influence his career.\n\nTrip Hawkins' High School Entrepreneurship\n\nHawkins started a company in high school, creating a tabletop game.\n\nDespite the company not succeeding, it taught him valuable lessons about business and fueled his desire to continue entrepreneurship.\n\nHe recognized the potential of computers in gaming and foresaw the future integration of software and hardware in homes.\n\n\"I lost every penny... And then the second thing I learned was, man, this is so much fun. I got to do this again.\"\n\nThe quote captures Hawkins' resilience and the positive outlook he maintained despite the failure of his high school business venture.\n\nTrip Hawkins' Education and Path to Apple\n\nHawkins attended Harvard at the same time as Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer.\n\nHe balanced being a collegiate athlete with his passion for computing, leading to his decision to focus more on his software interests.\n\nHawkins' foresight in personal computing led him to create a market research project on personal computers, which eventually led to his job at Apple.\n\n\"I'm not going to have credibility in Silicon Valley by being an electrical engineer. I'm going to have to build my credibility some other way.\"\n\nThis quote illustrates Hawkins' strategic thinking in building his career path, recognizing the importance of understanding the market and applications over technical engineering skills.\n\nTrip Hawkins' Journey to Founding Electronic Arts\n\nHawkins planned the foundation of Electronic Arts for about a decade before its actual establishment.\n\nHe knew he needed more business knowledge and experience in selling computer systems to homes.\n\nHis strategy involved understanding the market and customer needs, which he gained through his work at Apple.\n\n\"Pretty much there was about a decade before Electronic Arts was founded, where I'm planning the whole thing.\"\n\nThe quote highlights the extensive preparation and long-term vision Hawkins had before starting Electronic Arts, emphasizing that success often takes years of groundwork.\n\nEarly Impressions of Steve Jobs and Apple's Beginnings\n\nDon Valentine's initial encounter with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.\n\nValentine's role in encouraging Mike Markkula to become an angel investor for Apple.\n\nMike Markkula's influence on Steve Jobs's development and professional behavior.\n\nThe high turnover rate at Apple and the potential seen in Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.\n\nThe decision to bring in Mike Scott as CEO while Mike Markkula remained as chairman.\n\n\"So he went and met with the two steves when they were in the garage, and he thought, yeah, this is way too early for us.\" \"And towards the end of that first week, I'm standing next to Mike, and Steve's down at the end of the end of the hall going by. And I said to Mike, mike, we really need to do something about that.\" \"Well, and Waz made brilliant technical contributions in the first several years of the company, so he recognized the talent in both of them.\"\n\nThese quotes illustrate the early skepticism about Apple's potential, the rough edges of Steve Jobs that needed smoothing, and the recognition of the talent that both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak possessed. Mike Markkula's role as a mentor and chairman is highlighted, along with the challenges of managing a rapidly growing company.\n\nApple II's Success and the Challenge of Selling to Businesses\n\nThe Apple II's unexpected longevity and success, especially in the business market.\n\nThe introduction of VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet software, to Apple.\n\nThe initial target audience for Apple II being hobbyists rather than businesses.\n\n\"We were. And, of course, the invention of the spreadsheet helped a lot. Yeah, visical.

I mean, they were already banging heads and both of them played on great championship caliber teams, and then it was a matter of making a design that worked well for what the platforms could do then.\" Trip Hawkins explains the strategic choice of featuring Dr. J and Larry Bird due to their existing rivalry and the need for a design compatible with the technology of the time.\n\nTransition to Console Gaming and Sega Genesis\n\nThe video game industry faced challenges in the mid-1980s, with the collapse of Atari and the dominance of Nintendo.\n\nElectronic Arts saw potential in the Sega Genesis, a 16-bit console with advanced multimedia capabilities.\n\nEA reverse-engineered the Sega Genesis legally to develop games without becoming a licensee.\n\nThe company's decision to go public was partly to prepare for potential legal battles with Sega.\n\nThe success of EA games on the Sega Genesis, particularly the Madden series, contributed significantly to the company's growth.\n\n\"So it's coming out in the fall of 1988 in Japan.

We've already taken this game to our best retail customers. We've already got thousands of orders for the thing.\"\n\nThe quote demonstrates the confidence in the Madden franchise's potential and the strategic decision to protect and capitalize on its success.\n\nEA's IPO and Company Growth\n\nEA went public in the fall of 1989, a strategic move that enabled further growth and acquisitions.\n\nThe IPO provided leverage in negotiations and facilitated a transformation in the company's market value.\n\nTrip Hawkins reflected on EA's profitability and the timing of the IPO in relation to business opportunities.\n\n\"And it took another, I don't know, maybe a year or two, and the company was worth 2 billion.\"\n\nThe quote illustrates the significant growth EA experienced post-IPO, highlighting the importance of the public offering in the company's history.\n\nReflections on Entrepreneurship and Timing\n\nTrip Hawkins discussed the challenges of being too early with innovative ideas.\n\nHe emphasized the importance of timing and market readiness for entrepreneurial success.\n\nThe discussion included reflections on previous ventures and the lessons learned about pushing boundaries.\n\n\"A lot of us entrepreneurs, we see something, we envision that product and we don't appreciate the fact that it's going to take a while to educate the audience and have them be willing to pay for it.\"\n\nThis quote acknowledges the common entrepreneurial pitfall of being ahead of the market, stressing the need for patience and strategic timing."
