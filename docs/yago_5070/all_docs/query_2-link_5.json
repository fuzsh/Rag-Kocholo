His vision to make new kinds of drama, new ways to make people emote allowed me and others the space to try new things in interactive media altogether. Games can make people cry. EA also helped me go to my dream school USC School of Cinematic Arts and study electronic art. There I was also part of the Electronic Arts (EA) University program. I wouldn't have had such successes in my life without. In pursuing his passion and dreams, he helps us all do the same.”"
