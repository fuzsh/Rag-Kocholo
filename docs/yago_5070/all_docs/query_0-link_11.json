        "text": "Not many entrepreneurs spend 11 years planning their business’s start. But from his first foray into business at age 17, Trip Hawkins knew he wanted to start one. He just didn’t know what it would do. Then, in 1971, he got a glimpse of an early prototype microcomputer at a friend’s house, and an idea began to take shape. In the future, he realized, home computers would be commonplace.\n\nFrom that initial flash of insight, the biggest company in digital gaming would arise. Hawkins knew it would take time for home computers to catch on, but he began laying a course that would position him to profit from the coming electronic age.\n\nHe chose a date for his business launch: 1982. Just as planned, Hawkins did start a home-based, one-man business that year. That company became Electronic Arts, which now employs 7,600 and raked in a $677 million profit in 2010. How did it happen? Hawkins puts it down to a couple of personality traits: persistence and fearlessness.\n\n“I was feeling completely sure of myself and totally confident about what my plans were, and pretty bulletproof,” Hawkins recalls.\n\nThe very first game\n\nHawkins’ interest in games began in childhood—and so did his interest in business. While still a teenage student at Harvard University, he borrowed $5,000 from his father to create a board game centered on his love of sports, AccuStat Football. The money allowed Hawkins to create several hundred copies of the tabletop game. The game was loved by players but was a commercial failure, teaching Hawkins indelible business lessons that would shape his future plans.\n\n“It was a thorough business experience for me, as I had to design, manufacture, have a marketing plan, and even assemble the product,” Hawkins recalls. “It helped me realize I was going to be an entrepreneur, but I was also disappointed that I failed. It made me a lot more careful and thoughtful before I started EA.”\n\nAt Harvard, Hawkins graduated magna cum laude with a self-designed major in strategy and applied game theory, then added a Stanford MBA in 1978. Hawkins chose his first employer, Apple Computer, deliberately. He had seen the Apple II debut at a computer fair the year before, and wanted to work for a home-computer company.\n\nThe Jobs years\n\nIn Steve Jobs, Hawkins found a mentor who would greatly shape his outlook. It was early days at Apple: the company based in Cupertino, California, had just 50 employees when Hawkins joined.\n\nHawkins' responsibilities at Apple grew over his four-year tenure, but he never lost sight of his primary goal: to acquire business savvy and watch for personal computers (PCs) to become more popular and powerful. From Jobs, he’d learned to think of himself as creative and unstoppable.\n\nThe time was growing ripe for his startup. One gaming company, Brøderbund, debuted in 1980. Hawkins heard from one investor who was interested in funding a game startup. He worried he was getting behind the curve.\n\nHis dream of starting a company had crystallized into what Hawkins thought of as his “big idea.” Most software companies, he’d realized, treated developers like serfs instead of fostering their creativity. He wanted to start a game company that would operate like a music label.\n\n“By this time, I had experience working with prima donna software development geniuses and realized these are really creative people,” he recalls. “I began to realize I could work with them as independent artists, and treat them as artists.”\n\nEnter the crocodile\n\nAt just this time, Hawkins read in an airline magazine about venture capitalist Don Valentine of Capital Management (which would soon become legendary Silicon Valley firm Sequoia Capital). The article related that Valentine was so intimidating that one young entrepreneur actually fainted in his office during a pitch. His management style was likened to that of a crocodile, lying in wait and listening and then rearing up to rip everyone’s ideas apart.\n\nWhile this might have cued most would-be business owners to pitch someone else, the article prompted Hawkins to call Valentine and ask for a meeting. He admired Valentine’s attitude and thought he could get frank advice from him, which was exactly what Hawkins wanted. He wasn’t afraid of Valentine’s bite.\n\nKnowing Hawkins' track record at Apple, Valentine readily agreed to a meeting, and Hawkins arrived at the Sand Hill Road office with some trepidation. He had no written business plan yet for the company he had christened Amazin’ Software, and Apple was gearing up to launch the Lisa computer. He thought Valentine would urge him to fulfill his commitments at Apple and finish his launch work. But that wasn’t Valentine’s opinion at all.\n\n“He said I should quit Apple right away,” Hawkins says. “He offered me free office space, which is like saying, ‘If you pull this together, I’ll want to fund it.’ It was the encouragement I needed to take the final step.”\n\nAmazin’ software in the hall\n\nHawkins quickly wrapped up his work and left Apple in April 1982. Before taking Valentine up on his offer of free office space, Hawkins spent several months working out of his house, refining the business plan. He incorporated the company in May 1982 and funded it initially with $200,000 of his own\n\nApple stock profits.\n\nDuring this time, Hawkins worked on learning about the music-industry business model he planned to emulate. He flew to Los Angeles after a venture contact introduced him to legendary A&M Records co-founder Jerry Moss. Hawkins also spoke with a music-industry lawyer and got a copy of a recording contract to learn how to structure contracts for his software “artists.”\n\nWhile still working from home, Hawkins made his first few hires. The first was experienced PR man Richard Melmon, whom Hawkins knew from a stint at Apple. Melmon left his job at VisiCorp, maker of early spreadsheet product VisiCalc, to join the nascent company.\n\nMelmon and Hawkins would turn out to clash, and their versions of events differ—Melmon’s biography suggests that he, not Hawkins, raised the funding money for EA, for instance. In any case, Melmon would end up departing EA after just a few years.\n\n“He was by far the most important and highest-ranking guy I hired that year,” Hawkins recalls. “I hired him because I felt I should have someone older than me around to provide a little adult supervision.”"
