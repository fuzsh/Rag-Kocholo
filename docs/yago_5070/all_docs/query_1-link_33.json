        "text": "William Murray “Trip” Hawkins III, who founded gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA), has made the jump from Web2 to Web3, taking on the role of chief strategy officer for Barcelona, Spain-based gaming startup Games for a living.\n\nHawkins, who will also join the company’s board, aims to help the company with its goals of mass adoption and “understanding and adoption of Web3 games overall,” the company said in a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\n“I’m excited to begin my journey with Games for a living, leveraging new and emerging technologies to enhance performance and create exciting, immersive experiences for gamers,” Hawkins said in a press release. Hawkins added that he expects blockchains to be used more by content creators and that the company plans “to do it in a way that helps enhance game performance and value for players while keeping things fun.”\n\nHawkins has previously worked with Games for a living CEO Manel Sort at Digital Chocolate. Sort also has a breadth of Web2 gaming experience, with previous roles at Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and as an adviser on games such as Candy Crush.\n\nHiring and investments into Web3 gaming continue to grow despite the broader crypto market downturn. Pantera Capital invested $10 million in Metaverse Game Worldwide Webb, according to a press release Thursday, and gaming platform Ajuna raised $5 million in new financing this month. Also earlier this month, Square Enix, the company behind hits such as Final Fantasy, announced a partnership with Polygon to create a non-fungible token art project."
