Prior to EA, he was the Director of Strategy and Marketing at Apple Computer in 1982.\n\nIn 1991, he co-founded 3DO. However, after Sony introduced the PlayStation in 1994, EA limited 3DO expansion, causing 3DO to eventually go bankrupt.\n\nHawkins was the CEO of the company Digital Chocolate, Inc., which he founded at the end of 2003. He left the role in May 2012.\n\nHawkins became a senior advisor to the board of directors at NativeX in March 2013. In December 2014 he was recruited by Skillz as a strategic advisor."
