        "text": "FIFA, football (soccer) electronic game series published from 1993 through 2022 by EA Sports, a division of the American gaming company Electronic Arts, and licensed from the Fédération Internationale de Football Association. EA Sports began the FIFA series with the purpose of securing a hold on football gaming in the same way that it dominated the market for American football gaming with Madden NFL—a goal that EA Sports achieved.\n\nStarting with FIFA International Soccer, EA Sports created a handful of additions for 16-bit electronic game systems and the Sega CD. Unfortunately, the game included only national teams and was plagued by a bug that allowed for easy goal scoring. FIFA Soccer 95 was released for personal computers and the Sega Mega Drive. FIFA Soccer 96 was the first in the series to offer real-time three-dimensional play on the systems of the time. FIFA titles released by EA Sports seemed to lag behind the competition in some game-play aspects, however, until a series of overhauls in 2006 improved the control of the game and presented new features such as an in-depth career mode, which adds various coaching features.\n\nThe primary series has been flanked by other installments based on major football tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League, as well as a series of other football titles. FIFA 08 saw the implementation of the Be a Pro feature, as well as the ability to play on Nintendo’s Wii console, opening up a new world of control options using the Wii’s motion-sensing remote, which allows players to interact with the game by pointing and moving the remote."
