        "text": "Electronic Arts Games\n\nElectronic Arts are more than a company, and thus they create more than just video games. Each of their titles has to be considered as an experience. Did you know that EA reportedly has more than 300 million registered players around the world? It would be safe to assume that you are one of them as well. EA games revolve around many genres and styles, so you are guaranteed to find your pick on our list down below.\n\nElectronic Arts or in short EA is an American video game development and publishing company with its headquarters located in Redwood City, California. The Company was founded by Trip Hawkins back in 1982, and since then it has been one of the pioneers in the home computing games industry. Nowadays Electronic Arts games are the second most desired games in the gaming industry, surpassed only by Activision Blizzard but ahead of Take-Two Interactive, and Ubisoft. EA is known for development and publishing of most of the sports titles such as FIFA, Madden NFL, and NBA, as well as some other widely established franchises like Battlefield, Need for Speed, and Dragon Age. Currently, one of the most appraised, hyped, and awaited Electronic Arts games are named Anthem, and as the most of what EA has brought upon us, itâ€™s well worth waiting."
