Trip Hawkins is the founder of three interactive entertainment companies, including Electronic Arts in 1982 (currently, $2B+), The 3DO Company, and Digital Chocolate.

Trip graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University with a degree in Strategy and Applied Game Theory. He then pursued his MBA at Stanford University. Hired after college as Apple Computer‘s director of marketing, officially the company’s 68th employee, Hawkins began developing plans to create a software business that would eventually become Electronic Arts (EA), the top video game publisher.

As a gaming pioneer for the past 30 years, Trip has recently announced his new startup, If You Can Company, funded by Greylock Partners, Almaz Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Founders Fund. If you Can Company develops educational adventure games for children aiming to foster social and emotional development with intention to teach them how to “manage difficult emotions, persevere through challenges (such a bullying), make healthy decisions and show empathy and compassion.”

“I’ve definitely been ahead of my time on some things, and been behind on others. This time, though, I think the timing is just right, “ said Trip in his interview with Forbes.
