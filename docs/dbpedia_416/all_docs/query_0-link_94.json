        "text": "Hey guys, thanks for taking the time to learn more about me! I'm so excited to be part of ABC 33/40 and to experience all that Alabama has to offer. I come from the land of the hills...West Virginia. More specifically, I lived in Huntington for about seven years, where I graduated in 2007 from Marshall University (Go Herd!) with a degree in broadcast journalism and a minor in political science.\n\nWhile still in school, I started my reporting career working with the NBC affiliate, WSAZ-TV, part-time. After graduation I began reporting for the ABC/FOX affiliate in Huntington, WCHS/WVAH-TV, where I held down the Huntington bureau for two years.\n\nI live with my beautiful wife, Whitney, and our two (crazy) dachshunds, Dani and Alvin. You should also know that I'm a very family driven individual, and that I owe all my success in life to my parents, siblings and close friends and teachers who have helped me along the way.\n\nMy favorite stories are community-based, feel-good features...so by all means, if you know of a great one feel free to write me a line! Thanks and have a great day!"
