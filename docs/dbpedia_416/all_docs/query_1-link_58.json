I am a TV broadcater (among other things) and will give you some facts.\n\nFirst analog (NTSC) TV broadcasting in the USA is scheduled to be turned off after 2/17/09. People watching TV exclusively from cable and satellite will not notice much. However, anyone who gets an off-the-air signal, even on 2nd and 3rd sets, will notice. Without a converter (or being connected to a TV service provider) they will no longer pick up broadcasts off-the-air. There is a SLIGHT chance that date might move, but IMO that will be only for a very few channels across the USA.\n\nCurrently TV in the USA is broadcast on channels 2 through 69. All digital (ATSC) broadcasting will be limited to channels 2 through 51. Channels 52 through 69 are being \"given back\" to the government to be auctioned off. That's the \"700 MHz\" band.\n\nThere are currently channels on the air broadcasting ATSC everywhere in the USA. Many of these stations also have second channels. In my area, each broadcaster has a 2nd channel and one has 4 (sub)channels total. Have you ever heard of \"The Tube\"? A totally music video channel that does not even run commercials.\n\nI know there is more current data available, but the data I have from 06-06-06 shows the following channels for West Virginia:\n\nSTATION CITY DTV NOW NTSC NOW DTV LATER\n\n------- --------- ------- -------- ---------\n\nWLFB BLUEFIELD 14 40 40\n\nWVVA BLUEFIELD 46 6 46\n\nWCHS-TV CHARLESTON 41 8 41\n\nWLPX-TV CHARLESTON 39 29 39\n\nWVAH-TV CHARLESTON 19 11 19\n\nWBOY-TV CLARKSBURG 52 12 12\n\nWVFX CLARKSBURG 10 46 10​\n\nWOWK-TV HUNTINGTON 47 13 13\n\nWPBY-TV HUNTINGTON 34 33 34\n\nWSAZ-TV HUNTINGTON 23 3 23\n\nWVNS-TV LEWISBURG 8 59 8\n\nWWPX MARTINSBURG 12 60 12\n\nWNPB-TV MORGANTOWN 33 24 33\n\nWOAY-TV OAK HILL 50 4 4\n\nWTAP-TV PARKERSBURG 49 15 49\n\nWDTV WESTON 6 5 5\n\nWTRF-TV WHEELING 32 7 7​\n\nAntennas do not care whether the signal is \"digital\" or \"analog\"; the only thing that matters to them is the frequency/channel. I am not sure which stations are in your receiving area, or if you are receiving stations from another state, but it does look like there are channels which will be broadcasting ATSC in all 3 bands (VHF low, VHF high, UHF).\n\nI purchased my antennas at, of all places, Radio Shack. I bought the best they had. I can receive digital (or analog) television from as far away as 100 miles (I am in Sacramento but receive TV from the San Francisco bay area). The thing about digital, either it is \"perfect\" or you get nothing.... well sorta. A signal on the fringe might drop out a lot or the picture may \"block\" from time to time. But there is no snow or ghosts.\n\nNote: what is happening to broadcast television in the USA has nothing to do with rebanding in the 800MHz spectrum.\n\nAre you asking about receiving Pittsburgh, PA? Here is the data for those channels:\n\nSTATION CITY DTV NOW NTSC NOW DTV LATER\n\n------- --------- ------- -------- ---------​\n\nKDKA-TV PITTSBURGH 25 2 25\n\nWPGH-TV PITTSBURGH 43 53 43\n\nWPMY PITTSBURGH 42 22 42\n\nWPXI PITTSBURGH 48 11 48\n\nWQED PITTSBURGH 38 13 13\n\nWQEX PITTSBURGH 26 16 38\n\nWTAE-TV PITTSBURGH 51 4 51​\n\nI am using a Winegard amplifier. It has 3 adjustments, one for each band. It also has a switchable FM trap. I have cable wired to every room of my house, and between the cable length and the splitter loss, the amplifier was needed just to break even. Of course I've got a lot of gain left over.\n\nLet me know if you have more questions.\n\nTake care,\n\nGeorge\n\nMylan said:\n\nI am in the hunt for a new TV antenna but not really sure which kind to get.....
