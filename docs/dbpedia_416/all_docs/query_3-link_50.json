        "text": "Are The Sirens Tested?\n\nThe disaster sirens are tested at noon the 4th Wednesday of each month. The siren will emit a steady tone followed by the Pre-Recorded Test Message, concluding with a steady siren tone.\n\nWhat Should I Do If I Hear A Siren (not at the monthly testing time)?\n\nShould you hear the disaster sirens at any time other than the monthly test, go indoors and turn on the radio/TV for further information. A siren tone is initiated before and after the preÂ­recorded or live message. One of the challenges of tone only sirens is the ability to effectively communicate a specific message to the public.\n\nRadio Stations\n\nWCHS (580 AM)\n\nWCAW (680 AM)\n\nWKWS (96.1 FM)\n\nWVAF (99.9 FM)\n\nWBES (95.4 FM)\n\nWQBE (950 AM and 97.5 FM)\n\nWVSR (102.7 FM)\n\nWSCW (1410 AM)\n\nWKAZ (107.3 FM)\n\nTelevision Stations\n\nWSAZ CH 3\n\nWCHS CH 8\n\nWVAH CH 11\n\nWOWK CH 13\n\nAll local television stations will broadcast emergency information as will cable systems. Importantly, the information will NOT be broadcast on satellite-based services that do not carry local programming.\n\nWhere Are The Sirens Located?\n\nThere are over 55 disaster warning sirens located throughout Kanawha and Putnam Counties. These sirens are activated in the event of chemical manufacturing incidents, hazardous material transportation accidents and natural (weather) disasters. Nearly one-half of these sirens are capable of producing intense warning signal, live and digital voice messaging."
