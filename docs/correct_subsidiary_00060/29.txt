Which link? If you mean frappr.com, note that this thread was started several years ago and was resurrected by a necropost. Frappr.com has been toast for several years.

Evidently...

I haven't been around that long. The Thread came up when I clicked "New Posts" so it was something I hadn't read before. Guess someone else resurrected the thread and I happened to read it. Didn't realize it was that old...

Thanx, though.

I've been introduced to a site that will let us create our own member location map, so I went ahead and set one up!

http://www.frappr.com/pilotsofamerica

Click on the above link, and click "Add Yourself", and fill out your data (name, zip code and a little message "shoutout"), and then click "Add me!".

The more people fill it out, the better view of our demographics we'll get!

Enjoy!

Is that link still good? I can't access it.

I don't think anyone has made an "official" alternative to the long defunct frappr map. One of these two sites might provide an alternative:

http://www.mapservices.org/myguestmap/

http://www.platial.com/index.html

I've just created an account on the first site as an experiment; here is a link to it:

http://www.mapservices.org/myguestmap/map/JimLogajan

Not sure how well it will work. Would be curious to see whether people can post their locations on it. I'll be deleting it eventually, since it is just an experiment. The account name needs to be more appropriate anyway.

I just tried to add to your guestmap. Don't know whether it 'took'.

It looks like it took - in fact I see icons for you, Barb Miller, Navigator44 and myself on that web page. So it looks like mapservices.org may be a viable alternative to frappr.

By the way - platial.com appears to have been shut down - though they still seem to have a home web site.

But I did find one other map site that may also work: http://www.zeemaps.com/

I've also just created an experimental account on zeemaps.com that people can now try. To add yourself, click on the following link and from the "Additions" menu select one of the "Add Marker" (Detailed or Simple) menu selections to add a marker for yourself:

http://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=451754

I'm still keeping the mapservices.org map account in place for comparison purposes:

http://www.mapservices.org/myguestmap/map/JimLogajan

So which seems to be the better site to use? I found it easier to use zeemaps.com with an iPad than the mapservices.org map. I haven't attempted to try any of the customization features of either site.

Try the zeemaps.com link I mention in post 87 rather than the mapservices.org link.

Unless the management of Pilots of America objects or says otherwise, I'd like to propose the following as the new site where members can mark their locations (or places that they want to point out to others) on a map:

http://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=451754

I can hand control of it over to PoA management if they desire. They could also of course simply start their own map (it is pretty simple) - in which case I will erase the map I created.

There appear to be other sites, but the above seems to get the job done. It uses a semi-wiki paradigm. I notice that it appears to use browser cookies to determine who is allowed to edit a placed marker (so others can't mess with markers you place.) So if you clear your browser's cookie cache I believe you'd have to ask the map admin (myself in this case) to edit or delete any markers you placed using that browser.

I experimented with uploading alternate markers - such as a little airplane, helicopter, and jet icons - and they work, but oddly they don't allow changing the labels (so that choosing a "red" marker really places an airplane icon, choosing a "blue" marker places a helicopter, and so on.)

[EDIT: Found out how to change the marker labels. Have uploaded some aviation related icons.]

Several other options are available for a modest subscription fee, some of which I'd be willing to pay for the first year.

I put a red biplane at the location of my hangar but the site insists that the location is in Blaine (20+ miles NNE) because it found a Kilo Street there (I typed in Kilo Ln which is where my hangar is).

ZeeMaps uses Google maps API, so I imagine you'd run into the same problem if you typed that address into Google maps' finder. I just zoomed into my home field and used the click-on-map option to drop my icon.

Bump. Here again is a proposed new member mapping site to replace the defunct one that started this thread; feel free to add yourself:

http://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=451754

(If you don't like any of the icons that you must choose from to mark your location, just locate an image that is in the public domain or create one you are willing to share - then post a message to this thread with it attached or embedded and I'll consider adding it to the list. I have been using 32x32 bit PNG images from the net that were claimed to be in the public domain or otherwise free. I suggest keeping icons at or under that size.

Note to those handful who added themselves to the mapservices.org site: I will be deleting that account, so please consider adding yourself to the zeemaps.com site. Thanks!)

The map is for letting people know where in the world you live most of the time, or where you home airfield is, or whatever suits your fancy.

John can only claim California by sending me a very large sum of money.

No - but it's cash only anyway. Or better yet, gold. California is the land of gold, you must have some lying about you can send. A few kilograms should do.

That is pretty steep for California, considering it is almost bankrupt.

So far 30 people from 5 countries have added map markers to the new unofficial Pilots of America Member Map:

http://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=451754

Some brief usage notes:

To add a marker showing your location, choose the menu selection "Additions" and then either "Add Marker - Simple" or "Add Marker - Detailed". Either one allows you to add descriptive information and even an image.

You should be able to edit the content or location of your markers later - but only when using the browser that was used to create the markers. If you find you can no longer edit your marker then you need to contact me and ask me to either edit it for you or remove it.

Nothing should stop you from creating more than one marker. Though you should not create too many; the map is intended to provide a way to advertise your location, the location of fly-ins or other events, and their details.

There are a bunch of menu selections that only the admin (me) can use. Otherwise feel free to poke around. Hope this is of some interest or value to PoA members.

Anyone having access to the URL can insert markers, including guests. I hope everyone uses their editing capabilities responsibly. I would hate to have to shut down easy edit access.

If you are on a mobile device and you wish to add a marker, you first need to click on the "Full Map" menu button. That should take you to the standard display that allows marker additions and editing.

How about from a Nexus 7? I tried "full map" mode, and the app was so laggy it took 10 minutes to even find Port Aransas.

I will try it from a PeeCee.

According to today's entry on (ZeeMaps Blog they just changed the default display mode for mobile devices. I didn't know that when I wrote the brief usage notes in post 102.

So if you are on a mobile device and you wish to add a marker, you first need to click on the "Full Map" menu button. That should take you to the standard display that allows marker additions and editing.

Frappr.com was acquired by platial.com in 2007.

Platial.com basically shut down in 2010.

Above info summarized here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platial

While there there is still a web server at http://www.platial.com/, it doesn't appear to be operating.

News of platial/frappr's death in this platial blog entry.

It was in a comment to that blog entry that I saw the mention of zeemaps.com.

Since PoA members have now placed over 60 markers, I decided to pay the lunch money for two that was needed to remove the ads from the map for one year (well, all ads except Zeemaps brand):

http://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=451754

Should I pay another lunch-for-two-equivalent to get a "vanity URL" for one year? Specifically pilotsofamerica.zeemaps.com? No point paying for it if no one is likely to find it useful. I'm pretty sure the map group number URL will continue to be viable if I did pay for it.

To be frank, I'd save the money! I think we're capable of following a link over there. Hopefully Jesse can put a link on the home page or something.
