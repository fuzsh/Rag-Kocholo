        "text": "Bay Area residents looking for a weekend escape will find a true getaway in the wild wonders and sleepy hamlets of the central CA coast.\n\nWhat the Central California coast lacks in swimming weather it more than makes up in natural beauty. Take the rugged shoreline north of San Luis Obispo, near the towns of Cambria and San Simeon, location of the landmark Hearst Castle.\n\nHere you'll find a largely undeveloped stretch of coast with gorgeous windswept beaches and abundant wildlife viewing. This area of open vistas and sleepy hamlets feels a world away, yet it's just a few hours from the Bay Area – close enough for a quick escape over a long weekend.\n\nNear Hearst Castle, an elephant seal colony at the Piedras Blancas Rookery offers a rare opportunity to watch large numbers of these gigantic sea mammals interacting in their natural habitat. It's free and open every day, and a boardwalk along a long stretch of beach ensures lots of space to check out the fascinating creatures. There can be up to 17,000 elephant seals onshore in the area at peak times; the best viewing occurs at various points between October and May, but you can spot the animals year-round. (Visit the live beach cam for a taste of what to expect.)\n\nPart of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the area is also home to a wide variety of other sea life, including sea otters, harbor seals, sea lions and bottlenose dolphins. Whales – humpbacks, grays and blue whales, the largest animal ever to live on Earth – migrate within view of shore. Hundreds of birds fly overhead, and visitors to Hearst San Simeon State Park can scan the skies and waterways for a plethora of rarer winged visitors as well as the more common shorebirds.\n\nVisitors also won't want to miss a more unexpected wildlife viewing experience: the herd of wild zebras that grazes peacefully in the area, left over from the private zoo of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Nearby, the former Hearst residence, now a museum, is a study in opulence. Check the Hearst Castle website to find out if it will be open during your visit.\n\nThere are stunning beaches up and down the coast; try the popular Moonstone Beach right by Cambria to search for moonstones and jade, or to admire and add to the many structures made of driftwood that adorn the beach's north end.\n\nWhere to Eat, Sleep, Shop:\n\nWhen you're done with the great outdoors, Cambria offers plentiful dining options and boutique shopping – without a chain store in sight. This historic village tucked among the coastal hills is an artsy enclave with the timeless feeling of a forgotten valley, despite its relative popularity with local vacationers.\n\nThat popularity, though, guarantees convenience and comfort for travelers, who can choose from various lodging options in town and in the surrounding area, including some lovely bed and breakfasts.\n\nThe Cambria Pines Lodge is particularly popular with families and larger groups, and is beloved for its gardens and its light-studded seasonal Christmas market. Perched above the village on large, tree-covered grounds from which guests can descend a staircase into the village, the lodge includes rooms and suites with kitchenettes, as well as a pool and hot tub, full breakfast, restaurant and lounge.\n\nCambria is composed of an East Village and a West Village, both of which are worth exploring for their historic architecture, art galleries and unique shops. You'll likely find gifts for anyone on your list among the many boutiques. Visit the Best Kept Secret shop for an eye-catching selection of jewelry, clothing and more – including artistic women's tops by California clothing designer Jess & Jane.\n\nWhen you need a break, you'll find several local coffee and sweets shops to refresh you. The sheep's milk ice cream carried at Dolce Salato is luxurious; fans of fruity flavors won't want to miss their popular strawberry-basil or blackberry-rosemary flavors, while salted caramel and horchata lovers (respectively) will find the salted brown sugar and cinnamon honey flavors hard to resist.\n\nSide Trip:\n\nThe area around Cambria alone will keep travelers occupied, but for a longer trip it's worth making the drive about an hour south to the comparatively large town of San Luis Obispo, home of Cal Poly. The downtown combines the vibrancy of a college town with the old-style charm of Mission-era California, and the area has lots of beach recreation options. Pismo Beach is a more-developed coastal playground, with swings and volleyball on the beach near a large pier, and a bit south the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area allows visitors to drive ATVs around the dunes. Hiking in the hills around SLO reveals quiet meadows and multitudes of spring wildflowers.\n\nWhere to Stay: Check out the palatial Madonna Inn for a full-service resort with one-of-a-kind suites; for a budget option the nearby Vagabond Inn is a clean motel with a surprisingly nice pool area. You'll also find a wide range of hotels at in-between price points in the area.\n\nTip: Visit Sweetie Cup in downtown SLO for a classic Chinese teahouse experience with loads of flavors of boba tea, plus lots of other crowd-pleasing beverage choices, from gourmet teas to caramel frappe coffees."
