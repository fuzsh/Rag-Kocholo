Don't know whether it 'took'.\n\nIt looks like it took - in fact I see icons for you, Barb Miller, Navigator44 and myself on that web page. So it looks like mapservices.org may be a viable alternative to frappr.\n\nBy the way - platial.com appears to have been shut down - though they still seem to have a home web site.\n\nBut I did find one other map site that may also work: http://www.zeemaps.com/\n\nJim Logajan\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nJun 6, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n4,024\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\n.\n\nNov 11, 2012\n\n#87\n\nI've also just created an experimental account on zeemaps.com that people can now try. To add yourself, click on the following link and from the \"Additions\" menu select one of the \"Add Marker\" (Detailed or Simple) menu selections to add a marker for yourself:\n\nhttp://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=451754\n\nI'm still keeping the mapservices.org map account in place for comparison purposes:\n\nhttp://www.mapservices.org/myguestmap/map/JimLogajan\n\nSo which seems to be the better site to use? I found it easier to use zeemaps.com with an iPad than the mapservices.org map. I haven't attempted to try any of the customization features of either site.\n\nHenning\n\nTaxi to Parking\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 26, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n39,463\n\nLocation\n\nFt Lauderdale FL\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\niHenning\n\nNov 11, 2012\n\n#88\n\nCan't add a mark from an iPad.....\n\nJim Logajan\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nJun 6, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n4,024\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\n.\n\nNov 11, 2012\n\n#89\n\nCan't add a mark from an iPad.....\n\nTry the zeemaps.com link I mention in post 87 rather than the mapservices.org link.\n\nHenning\n\nTaxi to Parking\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 26, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n39,463\n\nLocation\n\nFt Lauderdale FL\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\niHenning\n\nNov 11, 2012\n\n#90\n\nTry the zeemaps.com link I mention in post 87 rather than the mapservices.org link.\n\nThat one plays with iOS.\n\nJim Logajan\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nJun 6, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n4,024\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\n.\n\nNov 11, 2012\n\n#91\n\nThat one plays with iOS.\n\nIt does look like the better of the two sites.\n\nJim Logajan\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nJun 6, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n4,024\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\n.\n\nNov 12, 2012\n\n#92\n\nUnless the management of Pilots of America objects or says otherwise, I'd like to propose the following as the new site where members can mark their locations (or places that they want to point out to others) on a map:\n\nhttp://www.zeemaps.com/map?group=451754\n\nI can hand control of it over to PoA management if they desire. They could also of course simply start their own map (it is pretty simple) - in which case I will erase the map I created.\n\nThere appear to be other sites, but the above seems to get the job done. It uses a semi-wiki paradigm. I notice that it appears to use browser cookies to determine who is allowed to edit a placed marker (so others can't mess with markers you place.) So if you clear your browser's cookie cache I believe you'd have to ask the map admin (myself in this case) to edit or delete any markers you placed using that browser.\n\nI experimented with uploading alternate markers - such as a little airplane, helicopter, and jet icons - and they work, but oddly they don't allow changing the labels (so that choosing a \"red\" marker really places an airplane icon, choosing a \"blue\" marker places a helicopter, and so on.)\n\n[EDIT: Found out how to change the marker labels. Have uploaded some aviation related icons.]\n\nSeveral other options are available for a modest subscription fee, some of which I'd be willing to pay for the first year.\n\nLast edited: Nov 12, 2012\n\ngismo\n\nTouchdown!

I have been using 32x32 bit PNG images from the net that were claimed to be in the public domain or otherwise free. I suggest keeping icons at or under that size.\n\nNote to those handful who added themselves to the mapservices.org site: I will be deleting that account, so please consider adding yourself to the zeemaps.com site.

Either one allows you to add descriptive information and even an image.\n\nYou should be able to edit the content or location of your markers later - but only when using the browser that was used to create the markers. If you find you can no longer edit your marker then you need to contact me and ask me to either edit it for you or remove it.\n\nNothing should stop you from creating more than one marker. Though you should not create too many; the map is intended to provide a way to advertise your location, the location of fly-ins or other events, and their details.\n\nThere are a bunch of menu selections that only the admin (me) can use. Otherwise feel free to poke around. Hope this is of some interest or value to PoA members.\n\nAnyone having access to the URL can insert markers, including guests. I hope everyone uses their editing capabilities responsibly. I would hate to have to shut down easy edit access.\n\nIf you are on a mobile device and you wish to add a marker, you first need to click on the \"Full Map\" menu button. That should take you to the standard display that allows marker additions and editing.\n\nLast edited: Jan 16, 2013\n\nJohn221us\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nJan 5, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n4,268\n\nLocation\n\nRocklin, CA\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nJohn\n\nHenning\n\nTaxi to Parking\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 26, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n39,463\n\nLocation\n\nFt Lauderdale FL\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\niHenning\n\nJan 4, 2013\n\n#104\n\nHow do I drop a pin on an iPad?\n\nJohn221us\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nJan 5, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n4,268\n\nLocation\n\nRocklin, CA\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nJohn\n\nJan 4, 2013\n\n#105\n\nGo to \"full map\" mode.

I didn't know that when I wrote the brief usage notes in post 102.\n\nSo if you are on a mobile device and you wish to add a marker, you first need to click on the \"Full Map\" menu button. That should take you to the standard display that allows marker additions and editing.\n\nflav8r\n\nLine Up and Wait\n\nJoined\n\nJan 20, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n644\n\nLocation\n\nExtreme Northeastern Florida\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nDavid\n\nJan 5, 2013\n\n#111\n\nAdded to the Northeastern most point of Florida.\n\nTMetzinger\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nMar 6, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n9,660\n\nLocation\n\nNorthern Virginia\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nTim\n\nJan 5, 2013\n\n#112\n\nAdded myself at my primary airport\n\nSent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk 2\n\nAdamZ\n\nTouchdown!

Specifically pilotsofamerica.zeemaps.com? No point paying for it if no one is likely to find it useful. I'm pretty sure the map group number URL will continue to be viable if I did pay for it.\n\ngprellwitz\n\nTouchdown!

I think we're capable of following a link over there. Hopefully Jesse can put a link on the home page or something.\n\nTheTraveler\n\nLine Up and Wait\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 9, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n685\n\nLocation\n\nValparaiso\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nTheTraveler\n\nBailey\n\nFiling Flight Plan\n\nJoined\n\nJun 22, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n21\n\nLocation\n\nAustin, TX\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nBrad"
