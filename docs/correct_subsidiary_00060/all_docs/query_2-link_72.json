        "text": "A bit of context.\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that the world is chock-full of surreal places, distant lands where logic and imagination are obliterated by the force of its man-made beauty and surrounding landscape. And yet, despite this sentiment, no place will ever compare to the Yucatan Peninsula. A secluded, archaic land where the remnants of different civilizations collapse into a singular spot. Enclosed in a vast evergreen jungle surrounded by Caribbean waters and dotted with ancient stone temples that once upon a time were clouded in smoke and adorned with luminous jade, you also get to find broken pediments like those found in Greek islands, pyramids like that in Egypt and abandoned baroque mansions that could have been shipped by way of sea from a main street in Paris. Various reports establish that during the reign of the Henequen-rope industry (1887-1916), Yucatan created more millionaires per capita than anywhere else in the world. This, of course, resulted in the mass production of hundreds of palatial homes and plantation houses, colloquially called haciendas. These properties were gargantuan in scale, some sprawling over tens of thousands in acres, while most of them portrayed a classical style, others were even more eccentric, with their towering Moorish arches meant to impress whoever dared walk past them.\n\nSadly, by the end of the 1930s, most houses ended up abandoned due to an agrarian reform mandated by the government. This reform opted to distribute amongst the local communities all the privatized land that was taken by force from the Spanish conquest. Thus began a period in the Yucatan history when its full-fledged glory faded into the background of the modern world. After once being a refuge for fleeing empresses, having cradled the ancient Mayan civilization and being the very epicenter where the famous meteorite extinguished the entire dinosaur population over sixty-six million years ago; darkness consumed every corner of the Yucatan once more. Over a period of almost a hundred years, the houses, the grand hotels and the haciendas turned to decay, vegetation grew over their walls, the imported ceramic French tiles were looted and sold. All the architectural singularity of the region succumbed to a period of decadence and poverty.\n\nFrederick Catherwood (1799-1854) and John Lloyd Stephens (1805-1852) were some the first European explorers who captured the virtues of the Yucatan in a series of lithographs published in 1844. They introduced the ancient Maya to a wider western world, as other explorers had done for the Greeks and Romans in earlier centuries. Their books provided an exact depiction of the grandeur of Mayan architecture and culture. Most of Frederick’s drawings were fantastical in nature. Ivy and exotic plants frame the intricately carved ruins abandoned due to the purposeful neglect of the Spanish immigrants. They remind oneself of old mythological tales available only to the vast reaches of human imagination. This was immortalized in the BBC series based on Evelyn Waugh’s (1903-1966) novel Brideshead Revisited, where aspiring artist Charles Ryder embarks on a journey to Central America and Mexico to document and draw various sites which later he would exhibit in London; just as Catherwood did in real life many years before the publication of Waugh’s novel (1945). Another writer who was also captured by the mysticism of the Yucatan was Gore Vidal (1925-2012), who in his novel The City and the Pillar (1948); the main character travels to Merida after an invitation from an heiress of an important hacienda. He spends some time in the capital where he visits the surrounding archeological sites before returning to his home in New York.\n\nHowever, a newborn interest for the Yucatan skyrocketed in the late 90s when several artistic people from all around the world, but especially New York, visited Merida and were more than enchanted by the ruins of its past glory. A few of them decided that acquiring one of the hundreds of dilapidated houses would be a great way not only to preserve history, but to live in a place where, clearly, even the air seemed to have something special.\n\nAfter almost a hundred years in which prosperity was chained by wrong decisions and bad turns of fortune. Yucatan has regained the momentum that once characterized it in the past. Several of the old mansions are reoccupied, lots of them turned into luxury hotels, and others graciously restored to serve as private residences for a very mixed background of individuals. Every day the all mighty jungle retreats from the stone and people take hold of the forsaken land. Merida’s city center is having its first breaths after a long while; the air is fresh; the water runs down the fountains, the streets clatter with the familiar sounds of horse carriages and street cafes. The city is alive and the pillars are standing.\n\nThus, this is my guide to paradise…\n\nThe Yucatan is vast, and unlike other places, you can drive hours and still be nowhere near its borders. There are two ways in which you can go about visiting the land. One is staying for a long period and soaking in the culture and nature, and the other, which will serve for the majority of people, is the short and dream-inducing few days. Trying to summarize the best places is impossible, as there are hundreds. I’ll approach this as I approach everything in life, through my own individual lens. I’ll recommend the places I always go back to. The places where the magic hangs loose in the air, and it costs a deeper sigh to breathe."
