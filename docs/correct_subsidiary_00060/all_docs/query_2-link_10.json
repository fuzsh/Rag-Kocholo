        "text": "First impression?\n\nThis palatial Victorian-style bar (built in 1893!) wows from the onset with its multicolored marble pillars, soaring archways, and coffered ceilings. Its French realist-style paintings almost make it feel like a gallery.\n\nCool. So who’s there?\n\nThe bar is tucked into the basement of the Hilton Sydney, so you're bound to see some tourists here. They're interspersed with a polished crowd of inner-city professionals grabbing drinks after work.\n\nHow are the drinks?\n\nAn old-school drinks menu features good Champagne, a handful of well-curated local wines, and Prohibition-inspired cocktails (the Ramos Gin Fizz and a potent Absinthe Frappe, made of absinthe, anise, sugar, and sparkling wine, are both excellent). Not into cocktails? Try an Australian whiskey flight for $45 a pop.\n\nWorth ordering something to eat, too?\n\nThe American bar food is surprisingly good and pretty authentic—Southern fried chicken, French fries, pulled pork. There's also a handful of share plates, including a cheese board and antipasto platter of grilled veggies."
