        "text": "Techvibes has released the latest version of its Portland Start-up Index, with an interesting pair of debuts. Portland-based Platial has been added to the list, debuting at #12. What makes this interesting is that Platial-owned Frappr also debuted this month—at #5.\n\nHow did the other companies and products fare? Take a look. The usual “apples and oranges” rules apply.\n\nAboutUs\n\nDiscogs\n\nKongregate\n\nCOLOURlovers\n\nFrappr\n\nSplashcast\n\nEarth Class Mail\n\nJive Software\n\nSandy\n\nMyOpenID\n\nGone Raw\n\nPlatial\n\neROI\n\nNetworthIQ\n\nStikkit\n\nGrabbit\n\nAttensa\n\nGadgetTrak\n\nActive Reload\n\nArt Face Off\n\nWalker Tracker\n\nRocketbook\n\nIovation\n\nChoiceA\n\nPibb\n\nLunarr\n\nUrbanDrinks\n\nIterasi\n\nFreeRange\n\nKnitMap\n\nWeoGeo\n\nGoLife Mobile\n\nGoboz\n\nPicktastic\n\nfmyi\n\nGoSeeTell\n\nMomHub\n\nImindi\n\nVocalNation.net\n\nKryptiq\n\nCendix\n\nLightfleet\n\nKumquat\n\nPheedo\n\nJama Software\n\nWorkplace2go\n\nAvnera\n\nBox Populi\n\nIDP Solutions\n\nCollaborative Software Initiative\n\nTechchex\n\nYourList\n\nWorldwide Nest\n\nTechvibes ranks the sites, products, and companies by comparing Compete and Alexa rankings. To learn more about the metrics and the movement within the list, visit the Techvibes Portland Start-up Index for May 2008.\n\nPortland-based Platial, the social mapping community with all of its vowels still intact, has acquired competitor Frappr.\n\nDetails are fairly limited at this time. Aside from a welcome message to Frappr users on the Platial site.\n\nPlatial has dropped a press release to announce the acquisition (hat tip to paidContent), purporting to be the “#1 Social Map site.”\n\nPlatial’s CEO Di-Ann Eisnor says, “We are delighted to have the Frappr community join the Platial family. This reinforces our vision to connect people, neighborhoods and nations around the world. Together, we will make social mapping more accessible, more valuable and a more fundamental part of Web 2.0, encompassing mobile and local search. We will also introduce new, more effective advertising models using social data and location to create greater relevance.“\n\nSo what about that other company that does something with maps? You know, that one down in Mountain View and in The Dalles? Marshall Kirkpatrick of Read/Write Web provides guidance on what this acquisition actually means.\n\nAt the time of this posting, this has not been announced on the Platial blog. [Update] On October 23, Platial posted a blog entry about the benefits of the acquired technology.\n\nMore information as it becomes available.\n\nSee additional coverage in TechCrunch, Mashable, paidContent, and Read/Write Web."
