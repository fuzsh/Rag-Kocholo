        "text": "Looking for something a bit more customized to your color palette? Try one of our custom color block curtains styles and create your very own designer look for your windows. Mix colors, patterns fabrics, prints—and voila—your drapes are in perfect sync with the rest of your decor!\n\nTo order, pick one of the four colorblock styles on offer, and choose the colorblock fabric you’d like to use from our collection. Add it to your cart along with your main drapery order and our stylists will pick it up from there. Pricing is per panel, so please purchase two units if ordering colorblocking for two panels in a drapery pair.\n\nPlease note our tailors and stylists decide colorblocking specifications based on overall proportions of drapes. If you’d like specific proportions and sizes, please include under special instructions at time of checkout.\n\nNOTE: The price for colorblocking is in addition to main drapery. Please do not purchase color-blocking standalone.\n\nHOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF COLORBLOCK CURTAINS\n\n– Mix colors. If you want a little (or a lot) more drama or color without committing to a patterned fabric, colorblocked curtains could be the answer. A band of accent color at the bottom or side edge of a neutral drape can subtly anchor a room’s palette. For a much bolder look, broad stripes or a wide patch on top or bottom can help make a statement, while syncing perfectly with the room’s overall palette.\n\n– Mix patterns with solids. To achieve an eclectic look for your space, consider mixing patterned fabrics with solids. Our stylists recommend mixing fabrics with similar compositions (cotton with cottons, for example) and using the 60/30/10 approach: 60% solid and 30% pattern on your drapery with the last 10% coming from an accent furnishing piece such as bolster pillow or a bed runner in the patterned fabric.\n\n– Mix textures. Often forgotten amongst choosing palettes and prints, mixing textures can be an incredibly simple way to turn your interior from ‘missing something’ to a ‘must-see’. A matte linen color blocked with a reflective velvet, or a tightweave cotton paired with a loosely woven sheer…playing with textures can bring warmth, comfort, and interest to any room.\n\n– Mix layers. Whether for functional reasons or to meet the maximalist aesthetic of a room, adding layers of fabric to a window immediately brings depth and dimension to it. Using colorblocked drapes with solid roman shades behind or flanking sheer drapery with color block curtains on the sides are two highly popular layering arrangements for a chic and contemporary look.\n\nCurtains, Roman Shades, Valances, Dining & Bed Linen: Window treatments and dining/bed linen orders are targeted for dispatch within three weeks, though we are able to ship out many orders ahead of schedule. We use DHL or FedEx with typical transit time of 3-7 days. Majority of our clients receive their packages within three weeks from date of order, but if our pipeline happens to be busy – especially during holiday season – we do ask for your patience and aim for delivery in four weeks.\n\n*Some drapes and roman shades with trims *may* take up to six weeks as our trims are sourced from Turkey & London, thereby adding to processing timeline in some instances.\n\nSwatches & Fabrics by Yard: Fabric samples and fabric bought by yard are dispatched within 1-2 days and typically delivered within 7 days of order.\n\nCushion Covers, Tiebacks, Dining Napkins & Placemats: We do NOT sell pillow covers, tie backs, dining napkins or placemats standalone. These accessories are sold and dispatched only as part of window treatment orders. Please see above for applicable timelines accordingly.\n\nIf there are any delays due to non-availability of fabric, or holds by customs officials for inspection, we will write to you as soon as possible.\n\nOF NOTE\n\nAll import duties and taxes are included in our prices for shipments to USA. For shipments to other countries including Canada, United Kingdom and other European countries, our prices do *not* include import duties and taxes that individual countries may impose. Buyers from these countries are solely responsible for paying any import charges once the shipment reaches their country.\n\nWe cannot deliver to PO Box numbers so please provide non-PO delivery address at checkout.\n\nAll our products require a signature for proof of delivery. After three delivery attempts, if no one is available to sign for delivery or the package is not collected from the depot, the shipment is returned to sender. We do NOT bear cost of return/refund in this scenario, and therefore request our clients to accept within the carrier’s timeframe."
