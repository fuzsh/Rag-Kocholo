        "text": "Many Filipino today pick their food hub based on how they look, how delicious their food are but other prefers it to be a little bit hefty than the ordinary. The good for two kind of thing. When we talk about enormous serving I guess the best place to indulge ourselves with here in Iligan City would be the D’-dhon’s Bistro. We bump into this cafe today because we just had our hair done at Cut Encarnacion Group of Salon and a few blocks away from this shop is the D-dhon’s Bistro’s niche. To be exact it is located at Timonera Building, Quezon Ext. Ave. in Villaverde.\n\nTheir food was so awesome ( I personally like their Spaghetti with toasted bread) and quite trendy with their presentations which matches the entire ambience of the nook.\n\nAnd did I say their servings are enormous? Their frappes are monstrous that even me needs a little help from my hubby in finishing it up. My daughter didn’t mind it though but compliant of brain freeze later. 😀\n\nThe D-Dhon’s Bistro will be quite a hit with office workers and students on the go, even with family bondings and the casual date time of old and new couples. Even us had a great time dining in this resto and my daughter keep on mumbling that she would like to come over again.\n\nIt’s love month again and nothing could be sweeter than spending valentines day with the person you hold dear to your heart. Whether it’s LDR (long distance relationship), it’s complicated or he’s just near and were happy together kind of relationship, every single person on this planet I’m sure wants to be cherished and wants to feel loved during this time of the year. My husband and I wanted this day to be special too so I was a bit surprised when he took me to this cafe because this place is a bit different than most of the cafes that we went into. I was thinking that maybe the owner was totally into sweets and he turned this passion for everyone to consume and enjoy.\n\nLa’ Chocolat Restaurant is the first and one of the newest chocolate shop in Iligan City. Here every customer can enjoy tasty treats from chocolate erasers to branded ones like the Ferrero Rocher. They also serve thirst-quenching frappes, yummy chocolate cakes and cupcakes and other delicious desserts. As long as it can be drenched and whipped with chocolate, name it and they have it.\n\nSo make your everyday a love day and discover pure sweetness at La’Chocolat, where the foods melts in your mouth and taste will always linger in your mind.\n\nIt’s a rainy kind of afternoon where you would like to just lie on the couch feeling and sip on some soup or perhaps a good cup of hot tea. My husband and I thought on having our lunch where we can indulge on something warm and spicy to beat up the cold weather. We’ve made a few rounds in the city and we came up to a very enticing greasy spoon, the Tadakuma Restaurant. A Japanese resto located in Bellfranz Bldg Quezon Avenue, just on the opposite side of The Strip in Palao Iligan City. It is somewhat a small diner with a few tables to hop in but the minimalist design of the place which features simple yet elegant dining rooms and precise plating in addition to delicious variety of Japanese foods, offering a unique eat out experience.\n\nBut before I go on the details of what ate that afternoon, folks I might ask you a little favor on this as I am not really a Japanese foodie kind of person but my husband is. So he’s kind of the one who coax me in striding here. Can you please not hate me in not being able to register in my mind the names of what we ate in this place? I was so hungry and cold at that time that I munched on in a jiffy what the waitstaff put on the table . I am keeping the faith that the photos I captured will make up for it. Although I’m pretty sure that the one served on the bowl with steaming noodles on it, is what we called “Ramen“, which I am also starting to relish.\n\nIt was one of those lazy afternoons where you have a spare time to spend with hubby because he is off from work and the kids are with granny having their nap time. So we decided to have our casual date to nourish the relationship kind of thing. 🙂 I heard about this place from a friend of mine, where we had a hard time finding the location and opted out to step down the Jeep, take a walk instead and prayed that we’re not lost. Well for those who haven’t been here yet it is quite secluded and away from the city scenic route. For those driving down towards the Bus Terminal in Tambo exit, along the B. Andrada Rd. in Andrada Heights, it is impossible to miss because it has a wide parking area with tables secured with big colorful umbrellas and it is situated on a rise. The Homebrew Cafe for me is like digging for gold, difficult to find but worth all the hard work. The place has a soothing vibes because they play Bossa Nova renditions that calms the nerves and they have great organic food and beverages that is good for the health.\n\nThe Homebrew Cafe offers variety of food choices, from heavy meal for dining or a light snack for an afternoon break. This place is perfect for everyone as they served no-pork to each and every customer who orders in their menu. They also have frappes and shakes that are truly thirst-quenching and fully satisfying.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a nice place to spend your lazy afternoons, perhaps you wanted to take the entire gang to a healthy buffet or you wanted to take hubby out on a romantic date night under the stars, try The Homebrew Cafe at Iligan City where eating out is a guilty pleasure you can surely indulge. 🙂\n\nPeople nowadays, they call themselves “millennials”, have been slowly growing into setting high standards when it comes to food taste and preparation. In this contention there is one place I consider that could always get my personal recommendation. Delecta Diner and Cafe is the longest running family restaurant in Iligan City. They have two branches now. One is located in Gen. Aguinaldo St., In front of Abalos Bldg. and the other is in The Strip, in Brgy. Palao.\n\nDelecta is known for it’s home cooked savory dishes which is a mixture of Filipino and American food sets in a sprightly milieu . They are well acclaimed in having not only the tastiest, but also one of the resto that serves the biggest portion of their Baby Back Ribs. Immersed with special herbs and spices, these irresistible pork loin ribs are roasted to perfection that when you take a nip, it just as if it melts into your mouth.\n\nThey also pander to desserts for those people like me, who cannot complete a meal without satisfying their sweet cravings. To name a few, they have blueberry cream cheese cake, enormous fruit salad and coco salad. They also have healthy beverages like the Delecta Coolers that is teeming with fresh lemon and different kinds of fruits or their Fresh Lemonade that is available in a glass or in a pitcher.\n\nIligan City can be seen thriving with it’s economic growth recently and a lot of big and small entrepreneurs alike can be seen investing and opening up new stores for people to get a kick out of. Even in the food industry, there is an advance in terms of getting not only the customer’s paunch satisfied but also creating a new total experience. Let’s take Gerry’s Grill Restaurant as a stereotype, a lot of food impresario has been in the business for a long time but still many of the gourmet populace choose to have a feast in this diner.\n\nMy family made a layover at this resto right after our usual Sunday Mass, as my mom wanted a new place to have lunch with, and I guess she wasn’t disappointed. Gerry’s Grill served her favorite cuisines. We had Nilagang Bulalo which is boiled beef shank with cabbage shank, Grilled Pork Liempo, a part of pork belly roasted till tender, Mixed Seafood in Fried Rice, Pork Sisig, pork slowly boiled then fried for that light crisp top with egg and fresh kalamansi, and their delicious Buttered Chicken. For dessert, we tried their creamy Mais Con Yelo and their rich Halo-Halo and something which quite amazes me. It is cardava banana fried with brown sugar and topped with vanilla ice cream. It is new to my taste and certainly did satisfy my sweet cravings.\n\nAfter having a palatial pot latch at Gerry’s Grill I can say that this diner will be here for a long time and will be quite a competition to every other restaurant in the city. Satisfying every customer that will come knocking at their doorstep.\n\nBeing a seafood lover, I always had in mind that dining in resto’s which caters seafood delicacies are costly and beyond the budget of a middle earners like me. But my viewpoint has changed when my husband took me to dine at Rai-Rock Seafood Restaurant located at Quezon Avenue, Iligan City. First, I was quite impressed with how simple and homey their ambiance is. There may be different trendy and modern restaurants opening all around the city, but Rai-Rock’s ingenuousness and modesty made it ascent above the rest of its competition. Having a feast in a vine-filled cottage is quite an experience, I tell you!\n\nWe feast on enormous shrimps fried to perfection making it crispy on the outside but not undercooked on the inside. Just perfect for its affordable price (which I must accept, quite surprised me). We also tried their Seafood Combination which is a mix of all variety that I love. There’s a handful of shrimp of course, large crabs, squids and mussels sautéed in ginger, tomato and red onion. Aside from seafood’s, they also serve delicacies that are not usually served in any other restaurants like Adobong Kanding and the like. They have tasty refreshments, but their Pineapple Shake has taken over my taste buds.\n\nAs a full time mom, taking care of the family is hard work. I do everything to make sure that everything is taken cared of. From waking up early in the morning to prepare breakfast for the children so I can send them off to school, to making sure the house is spic and span and the laundry is done. I also ensure that I pay all the bills in time and be able to manage our finances so that we can have a bit of our rainy day funds in case the rainy days did come. And you can really tell if your a mom, if going to the grocery store already means a breathing spell for your daily and boring routine. So yesterday my body wore out, and I felt like not getting out of bed. I had this flu thing going on and my husband felt it too. And he was considerate enough to take me to this massage parlor so that I can have a relaxing and stress relieving massage.\n\nNestled on The Strip Bldg. in Palao, Iligan City, Ice Factory is here to make your day a little sweeter, just like they did to our family night with their hand-crafted ice cream and heaps of invariable housemade treats. We were supposed to go to this street fair but we got turned off by the multitude of people who went there to spend their night. So we went to this ice cream shop instead, and boy! Am I glad that we did! The place was amazing it was like being inside a big freezer full of sweet treats!\n\nTheir menu features different kinds of tempting desserts set in a hefty bowl for the whole gang to enjoy! Their confectionery invoke childhood memories and good-old fashioned yumminess which my entire family truly enjoyed and greatly, in a very reasonable price.\n\nSo if your having a bad day because of your busy schedule or your in a luck because of a big promotion, or whatever day you maybe having, try a runaround in Ice Factory and let the cold treats cool off your day!\n\nIt’s always a little bit arduous to go out of our comfort zone and try something different from what were used to, especially when it comes to food. Personally, I am skeptical to try something else I am not accustomed to because I am petrified my taste buds might not be able to tolerate it. But with a hopeful heart and a growling stomach, my husband and I tried a unique restaurant located in Chelina Arcade in Tibanga, Iligan City. Who would have thought that we would find a Mexican restaurant in this modest town. Amigos Cuisine is a scanty but delightful restaurant secluded bedside a queue of other inviting restos.\n\nThis prodigious restaurant offers a variety of Mexican cuisine, from Tacos, Arroz con Pollo, Sopa de Tortilla, Burritos and their mouth-watering Quesadillas and from the looks of how the dishes were presented to us, one might think it’s a bit pricey. But everyone’s in for a treat because their meals are all affordable for everybody to enjoy.\n\nSo if you are looking for a new piquancy in your palate try Mexican foods in Amigos Cuisine and you’ll find delectable dishes you will learn to love and adore."
