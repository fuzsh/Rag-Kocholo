        "text": "In the post Shannon/Alexis fight part of the party, the other woman race to get filmed as part of it, while pretending not to want to get involved. It’s a tricky dance. We get a bit of insight into the Shannon/Tamra escalation, with Shannon saying Tamra was liking instagram pictures of Alexis and John, but Tamra claiming she sent Shannon a sympathetic text. But it feels more like the text was an excuse to rub salt in the wounds. I’m so sorry you were dumped for someone younger, you must feel old and forgotten <smiley face emoji>\n\nJen got evicted and is leaning into the stereotype of an immature lazy aging former pretty girl who will go to any lengths to avoid gainful employment. She even plays the victim with her kids so they’ll green light moving in with creepy Ryan. Is their father watching this debacle? Does he not want custody?\n\nJen has other problems too. Gina is mad at her because she vouched for Jen as a renter (that’s a thing?). And now that Jen was evicted, Gina’s entire real estate empire - one unproven sale - might crumble. Although she’s right about Jen. Jen is a never-worker.\n\nHeather’s party looks like a bridal shower for a D list tv star - lovely and overdone. The vibe is ruined by a money booth. Is this Vegas? A rare style slip for Heather.\n\nI don’t understand the dumb game they play, or why games were part of it at all or why games at parties ever became a thing. The women take turns grandstanding.\n\nAlexis says her goal is putting animosity with Shannon behind her. And talking about it nonstop so as to become indispensable to bravo.\n\nTamra would like fewer friends talking behind her back. No plans to be less of a bitch in order to make that happen though.\n\nHeather blathers on about jewelry, opening the door for Alexis to show off her promised ring from John. No one knows what a promised ring is, compared to a promise ring. I’ll try and clarify. A promise ring is something a boy gives you in high school before you go your separate ways and never see him again. A promised ring is something a middle aged guy with new teeth gives a thirsty former housewife two months into meeting her, so that they both get filming time.\n\nShannon runs out of the party and Tamra follows, but not to console. “You talk behind my back, the tour had to be around your schedule, you are not a good person.” Btw WTF was with Shannon having her lipgloss touched up by someone else at the table?! JLo wouldn't go that far, and she just hosted a Bridgerton-themed birthday party for herself.\n\nKatie, Shannon, and Jen meet to walk up and down stairs, and it’s as productive as anything we’ve seen them do. This is not a clock punching group. Jen says Ryan “does nothing” right now. “He plays in the sunshine.” Wake up dope! He’s a criminal. Which is different than being unemployed.\n\nAs I’ve said many times before, nothing on these shows is duller - or faker - than the introduction of a new housewife. We are not yet vested, and don’t care at all, and they give such an airbrushed version of themselves. I did start listening somewhat when I heard Katie say she has two minor children who do not live with her or with each other or anywhere near her. Suspicious. As is her claim to being tall. You’re not. Sit down.\n\nShannon is running out of support and may possibly now be bringing her paid glam people to parties fronting them as friends. So in desperation she is now chasing women she used to snub - Emily and Gina. Shannon turns on the tears, offering Gina a years late apology for DUI shaming her years back.\n\nSpeaking of not having jobs, now that Cut Fitness is closed, Tamra and Eddie ride motorcycles, go out to lunch, and talk shit about Shannon’s drinking. As if the drinking bothers Tamra. Trust me, don’t tell Tamra your troubles unless you want to make her day. Eddie and Tamra are talking about moving to Big Bear which will happen around the time I move to Big Bear and I don’t even know where it is. Tamra wouldn’t leave Orange County and this job unless a restraining order mandated it and the National Guard enforced it.\n\nJen and her kids have moved into Ryan’s house, which is large and nice. They joke about the dishwasher never having been used and having tags still in it. Wait, what? Did the kids move in yesterday? Because kids will eat, I find, particularly teenagers. Jen has her parents visit and becomes even more nauseatingly babyish in their presence. The parents are loving Ryan temporarily covering Jen financially, so they pretend they like him and she cries and turns her victim status up to full blast. “I love you guys so much.” She tells us she has to figure out how to stay an amazing mom. I’ll give her the instructions:\n\nStep one. Become an amazing mom.\n\nStep two. Stay one.\n\nI think step one has been tripping her up.\n\nOver a fancy freezing outdoor dinner, Shannon and Heather pretend to try and move forward. Oookay.\n\nGina is again at lunch, this time with Jen and don’t bother bringing any food to the table because this is just a setup for Gina to blast the teenage 47 year old Jen who barely gets a word out. “I don’t think you think about these things at all this is my brand new career I went out of my way to help you and you burned me your attitude is pathetic grow up pay your bills take care of yourself and your children I’m so upset by this you don’t get it because you don’t get these things you don’t want to hear the truth wake up you're not paying rent but getting your hair and makeup done you won’t let me talk she’s a joke you’re pathetic take care of yourself and your kids or drown but don’t fucking run me over with your bullshit fuck this girl. She’s stupid.” Yup\n\nThe OC is back, and we may be in for a strong season! A few noteworthy things have occurred since last season:\n\nShannon out-shannoned herself, earning a DUI and a reality Emmy Award by plowing her car into a house\n\nJen’s boyfriend was part of a massive baseball gambling scandal that involved stealing $16 million dollars from a big name player\n\nJohn pivoted from Shannon to former housewife Alexis Bellino, who is both younger than Shannon and the ex wife of Shannon’s lawsuit nemesis\n\nThere was a big sale on lip filler, apparently\n\nShannon has moved yet again, the excuse this time being “empty nester” - which she is not. The girls are in college; they are not on their own. Shannon moved for the same reason she’s moved fifteen times since she’s been on the show - money. She cannot afford the lifestyle she purports, so she does short term rentals during filming.\n\nShannon and the girls are in the latest airbnb talking about Shannon’s “humiliation,” which I sometimes think she enjoys - she certainly uses the word often enough. I bet the poor girls enjoy it a lot less, as Shannon subjects them to tearful and unsubtle requests for reassurance. Here is her description of events that I will never forgive Bravo for not filming: “I drove to John’s we got in a big argument he said you’re a drunken idiot don’t get in your car but I revved up the engine to spite him and lost control.”\n\n“This happened for a reason,” the girls conclude, clearly hoping Shannon will stop drinking. But instead Shannon thinks the “reason” is to test who her friends are. If Shannon has actual friends, they are certainly not cast members on this show.\n\nThe soberest of the cast - Heather - is remodeling another fabulous house that does not need much remodeling. Or at least way less than she’s planning. She reminds us they also have a penthouse, in case their wealth wasn’t obvious already.\n\nEmily is not pressed for cash either. She hosts semi-broke Gina who no longer has a drinking issue but has moved on to other problems, the main one being she is not wealthy enough to financially support Travis. Six kids in a small condo is romantic for a hot minute before you realize that an earner is sexier than any face could ever be. And Travis would not be mistaken for a Helmsworth brother on a good day.\n\nJen knows money is attractive, but still picked the wrong guy. “Babe,” whose name I forget, is the phoniest weirdo on cable television and is allowing Jen to be evicted from her rental. I don’t know if he’s going to prison or the witness protection program or down the aisle with Jen. We’ll see I guess. But he’s not the millionaire Jen thinks he is.\n\nAlexis is reintroduced on the show as a good friend of Heather and Emily, and I bet they realized they were good friends the minute they heard Alexis was “in love” with Shannon’s ex John. Emily has to quickly walk back having called John a douche. Although being married to Shane should have made her cautious of any man shaming.\n\nShannon films an appointment with her lawyer, which probably didn’t even need to occur since the case was already adjudicated. But of course Shannon wants to get it on camera that she was sentenced to three years probation, community service, and alcohol counseling. “I’m going to continue to grow and that’s the important thing,” says someone who should have already grown enough to know it was important not to crash into a house. But leave it to Shannon to simultaneously bask in humiliation and turn it into a moment of self praise.\n\nTamra brags to us that she has a daughter who talks to her and with whom she can now film. Matching tattoos are how she reintroduces Sophia to the show.\n\nHeather is hosting a lovely Balboa Island party, the theme of which is Shannon and Alexis’s first brawl. It certainly isn’t the introduction of our new cast member, Katie. <yawn> The party is the perfect backdrop to gossip about Shannon’s drinking, which she previously told Emily she limits to two. “Per hour” adds Tamra. Correct.\n\nAlexis strolls in with full confidence, and shortly afterward Shannon arrives faking confidence she does not have, rocking huge chunky heels and a smaller lookalike friend. She gets something of a cold shoulder from the women and tries bravado, telling them the DUI has helped her to give up John. Strangely it did not help her give up drinking.\n\nFinally Shannon approaches Alexis for a chat. If you want to know how staged this show can be, take a look at these two mortal enemies carrying a table together. Why was a table even needed? Was one of them planning to flip it?\n\nShannon tries to front that her main beef with Alexis is the $300,000 she lost in her lawsuit with Jim Bellino several years ago, and not that Alexis stole her boyfriend last week. No one is buying that, and Alexis points out the obvious. “The real issue is I have your ex boyfriend. If you don’t like it there’s the door Shannon Beador.”\n\nI bet Alexis workshopped that line and pitched it to get back on the show. In fact, she and John could both be faking the entire relationship. That’s their level of thirst.\n\nShannon is still addressing the CPS comment. “Of course I’m sorry!” she shrills accusatorily. “I wasn’t insinuating your kids would be taken away by CPS when I said your kids could be taken away by CPS!” Shannon’s utter lack of insight is one of the many true gifts she brings to the show. She is an A+ housewife, but a D or F in most every other category of her life.\n\nThey move on to the women gossiping about how John is a shitty boyfriend, in which Shannon was the chief gossiper. But she is mad at Heather, instead of John, the shitty boyfriend who apparently she is still banging (when he’ll allow it). “I have never been more in love with a guy” who regularly ghosts me. They call her out a bit about the drinking, and like most drinkers, she gets nasty. “I don’t like you! I’ve done things that are difficult! I gained 42 pounds! My job is to be Shannon Storms Beador!” Save it for the AA meeting.\n\nLike many agitated wackos who have no facts on their side, Shannon plays for sympathy. “I’m a smart person! I missed the signs from John! I’m embarrassed!” This self deprecation inexplicably works to some degree and they’re all reassuring her. It doesn’t work with me, that’s for sure. Get. A. Job.\n\nNuts as she is, Shannon isn’t as clueless as Jenn who is oblivious to what a bitch Tamra is. Could it be more obvious? Tamra is so nasty that my dog growls when she is on the tv screen. Actually, I don’t have a dog. So the growling might be me.\n\nHeather isn’t the nut Jenn is, and when she denies telling anyone that John called Shannon a pig, I have to applaud. I love a cleverly delivered jab.\n\n“I’m going through a lot” Shannon claims, embracing her favorite state of being - wallowing. “My kids are leaving for college!” So a wonderful milestone that many lucky people have experienced is purported as a reason for a telethon.\n\nEmily cries about her mother, which probably is a source of pain; but we are not vested in it. You can’t mention something in one or two side interviews and get the reality audience involved. We need to see it play out, and didn’t. Emily delivered nothing this season except the occasional nasal sanctimonious yelling. When Tamra says Shannon didn’t want Emily at the Tres Amigas show because she “doesn’t like her,” Emily responds with a tattling “Heather said Tamra is an asshole.”\n\nTamra is an asshole. Just ask my dog.\n\nHow do you not react to hearing that Shannon verbalized not liking you? Not swimming in self respect, apparently.\n\nThe white water raft guy is again mocked for his balls hanging out on camera, and I hope he’s the type who can laugh that off. I doubt his mother can. Not everyone has the personality to joke about a bony vagina.\n\nThe “she said she said” tedium continues, as we analyze whether Tamra or Shannon or Heather called Emily or Gina a loser. Can’t follow it, don’t care. Emily is sarcastically shouting at Heather, “poor Heather poor Heather” scoring a negative number on my likeability meter.\n\nWhen the host of the show and the boss of the network points out that Tamra trash-talked all these women, she exhibits more balls than the river raft guy. “We’re not talking about that so fuck off,” she says to Andy freakin Cohen.\n\nI think Tamra realizes fast it was a bad move, and takes a page from Shannon’s book, whipping out tears to deflect. Tamra starts crying about - of all things - missing her “friendship” with Heather. Heather appears to fall for this and is praising how well Tamra is doing in her life right now, what with her failed business, unemployed husband, tenth rental home, and alienation from her daughter. “And I’m an asshole when I drink.” And when I don’t.\n\nSomeone tweets that this cast is perfection. I’m going to need that person found and brought to an emergency room for a stat psych eval because that's the least correct conclusion since Jenn declared Ryan to be the love of her life. This cast is garbage. Here’s how I’d adjust it.\n\nBring back Vicki\n\nKeep Shannon, and pin a lifetime achievement medal on her for excellence in psychosis\n\nGet rid of Emily unless she brings back cranky Shane\n\nGet rid of Gina\n\nGive Jenn one more shot, unless she wises up to Ryan, in which case, ba bye\n\nKeep Tamra, but add in surprise former housewives showing up at parties to pick fights with her - Alexis, Gretchen, Jeana, etc\n\nKeep Heather but on warning to step it up\n\nNever again, Taylor\n\nAndy asks the women to close with what they will all miss, and like half of them misunderstand the question. It’s all too stupid to recap. Here’s what we all missed - comprehensive film of Shannon the night she got arrested, so we could test my theory that she was out driving by John’s house looking for evidence of another woman.\n\nThe Orange County reunion is set against the backdrop of a beautiful beach, but it’s not a real beach, any more than these faces, boobs, hair, and friendships are real. The women are styled to look like a package of highlighters that you buy at the beginning of the semester with all good intentions, but never really use. Heather delightfully messes up the theme with a black dress, whereas Shannon looks like an aging country music award nominee who just lost her category but has to sit through another 3 hours of the show.\n\nAndy begins the reunion with the reconciliation of the two most toxic people on Bravo - Tamra and Shannon - who totally deserve both each other and their recent bad luck. Tamra is asked about the gym closing and says Eddie “is doing good he is starting a new supplement company that’s going to launch soon.” So he’s unemployed.\n\nHeather isn’t friends with either of them, and claims to be sad that Tamra said something unkind about her in every episode. I’m sure the dissing is way more frequent than that, and Heather should just be glad she doesn’t have contact during filming breaks.\n\nJenn is introduced as having a “successful” yoga studio, which is apparently defined as one where the owner does not have access to five thousand dollars. [By the way, how did Andy not ask about that?] We learn Ryan declined to be at the reunion, and it’s his very first smart move. I bet he regrets ring shopping for camera time. I bet he regrets being on the show at all, maybe worse than he regrets sending a “limp dick pic” (eww) to the wrong number. I almost feel bad for him. He went on this show with a big smile and a lot of denim and expected a fun 15 minutes of fame and maybe viewers thinking he’s hot. Instead he got run over by a dump truck.\n\nJenn accuses Tamra of bringing her on the show as her friend then attacking her for dating Ryan. Even NOW Jenn does not realize that Tamra brought her on the show with the intent of attacking her. Mocking Jenn was always the point. Naive Jenn is calling Tamra a piece of shit friend. For fucks sake, she is not your friend period!\n\nThe “shitty friend” has brought with her printouts of Ryan sexting another woman, and that kind of information didn’t just accidentally land in Tamra’s mailbox. She proactively sought to harm this couple, and Jenn - who may have less common sense than Archie when he got in that car - is scrambling to defend herself. “I feel loved and special he only slept with her that one time.” Geez, Jenn, you do not owe this shady group explanations! Tell them to fuck off and date any limp cheating weirdo you want.\n\nTaylor - who probably killed off any further “crossover season” plans the network might have had - joins the stage to brag on her (nonexistent) movie career. Everyone jumps on her bandwagon that Heather was dismissive of the acting job, but only because they want to slam Heather. Trust me Taylor, they are also dismissive of your acting job. I’M dismissive of your acting job. Taylor fronts anger about being called anti-women; anger she did not express when it actually happened or in any of the months since. She saved her outrage for this proud moment as a “friend of” on a show she used to star in. Enjoy the professional triumph. Ba bye.\n\nHeather says that Terry had a stroke, which earns her a minute and a half of sympathetic head nods before the slamming of her continues. Emily claims to feel Heather should have defended her when Tamra said she wasn’t a real attorney. Uh, why is Tamra not on the hook for the comment itself?\n\nIf you look up hypocritical gaslighting in the dictionary, you’ll see a picture of Emily - who just cried about having been called a party planner - claiming Heather needs to lighten up about being the recipient of criticism. It is not Emily Perry Mason’s finest moment.\n\nFinally the confrontation I’ve waited to see: Shannon called out for saying she saved Gina’s kids from CPS, and later angrily denying she said it. They go to the videotape - the indisputable evidence. And is Shannon mortified? Does she profusely apologize? Nope. She becomes an even bigger asshole.\n\n“I already apologized!” she yells, as though a sarcastic “I’m sorry you think so” drunkenly slurred in a pumpkin patch last year while still denying the incident happened is the only accountability she need express. With the shannoniest enunciated tone she explains why she did it and why she lied about doing it: “I don’t like you.” Maybe the first true thing she’s said since a team of interns stuffed her into the highlighter dress and glued all the hair on.\n\nWhile I’d rather be blogging about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, and you’d rather be reading about them, let’s just finish the finale of this subpar Housewives season. Woohoo. Not.\n\nThe women are back from Mexico, likely having been asked to leave. Shannon is faking that a bruise she got on the trip isn’t purely alcohol-related. She and Emily go to a chiropractor, though even I know you don’t “adjust” a bruise. “Thanks beautiful,” says Dr. Smarmy, basking in the air time.\n\nGina is playing both sides, texting Heather while Halloween shopping with the others. Wait, when was this filmed? It’s nearly Halloween now! Is this whole season of nothing a year old?! Gina ends up meeting Heather so they can argue about who called who a loser. When Heather provides an actual recording of Tamra saying it, Gina claims Tamra didn’t mean it maliciously. But the hearsay of Heather possibly saying the exact same thing apparently was malicious.\n\nLater Heather is complaining about the women to Terry in her palatial rental while a chef cooks dinner, in case it wasn’t clear why she’s viewed as malicious by broke social climbing Housewives.\n\nShocking as it is to hear, Tamra did not go to college. But with the help of only 16 seasons of gifted publicity on a reality television show, she has started a business. She congratulates herself while posing with other women all in white bodysuits, and I don’t know what it’s for nor will I be checking.\n\nJenn tells her phony phiance that she had “fun” in Mexico. Fun? Did she go again? Because when we saw her in Mexico it looked less like fun and more like an elderly dog walker getting too close to the pond and ending up mauled by alligators. Jenn asks Ryan about yet another cheating rumor, and he quickly admits it, then moves on to the more important issue - blaming Tamra for telling her. Jenn accepts this like the blockhead she apparently is, and agrees to move forward with her divorce so they can be married. All she needs is a retainer, because Jenn does not “have access” to $5,000. WHAT?! How could that possibly be? Perhaps this level of broke comes as a surprise to Ryan as well, as he stumbles “I would give you the money in a heartbeat but…” And doesn’t finish the sentence. Red flags out the yingyang.\n\nLike happens to most adult women, Shannon’s reading glasses were absolutely destroyed while on vacation. She uses the remnants to read a menu but fails to read the relationship collapsing right in front of her. We can almost see John rolling his eyes at her ‘Heather’ complaints as he mentally goes over his plan to bail as soon as cameras go down.\n\nTamra and Shannon have come up with a clever way to haze Jenn. She must take a plastic device Shannon has crafted with a glue gun and some pvc piping she picked up at Hobby Lobby, and shove it up her ass in front of them. If she doesn’t end up in emergency surgery with a bowel perforation, they’ll redirect 40% of her current bullying time onto Heather. It’s an offer Jenn can’t - and doesn’t - refuse.\n\nFor a sparsely-attended idiotically-themed party, the women dress up in their most ridiculous costumes ever, even including the 70’s party. I’m not going to analyze the looks - suffice it to say each woman looks dumber and sluttier than the next, at God knows what cost. Taylor looks especially absurd, nasally and drunkenly ranting in a clown costume about her step daughter and salsa dancing and chicken soup. Suffice it to say THIS Taylor didn’t spend the weekend landing Travis Kelce.\n\nTamra races around rallying everyone to trash Heather for reasons that have not been adequately clarified to the viewers. She hurries from one pack of wolves to the next making sure everyone is scrutinizing and mocking Heather’s every move with smirks and insults at a level rarely seen outside the snottiest of Valley Girl middle school cafeterias. “Look at her. Oh my God.”\n\nMeanwhile Heather bothers making some kind of peace with backstabbing sycophants Emily and GIna. Lord knows why. “We’re good.” No, you’re not.\n\nNeither are Tamra and Ryan, though she claims they are, but only so as to give an impression that her rage at someone else has merit. Tamra eagerly waits for some moment of outage to attack her prey. When none comes, she fakes it, racing suddenly across the room at Heather shouting “are you fucking kidding me?!” She and Heather have a brief hostile back and forth that ends with “goodbye bitch.” The interesting thing here is Terry asking Gina and Emily to help his wife, and them not doing it. The wildebeest and the meerkat aren’t going out on any limbs against the lion, no matter how bad they want to socially get next to Heather’s wealth and connections.\n\nDespite the hate, they take a group photo and this craptacular season ends with wrap-ups:\n\nJenn can now pay her divorce lawyer because she came into some gambling winnings. [Did I read that right?]\n\nShannon and John broke up.\n\nGina got her real estate license and still isn’t married to that nobody whose name I forget.\n\nEmily’s daughter … who the fuck cares\n\nHeather is looking for a new house … ditto\n\nTamra is the biggest witch in Orange County.\n\nTaylor met a tight end with a smile so sexy it should be illegal.\n\nOh Shannon. Shannon Shannon Shannon. A hit and run DUI?! Who would have thought it was possible? I’ll tell you who:\n\nDavid\n\nHis mother\n\nJohn\n\nJohn’s kids\n\nAll former and current OC Housewives\n\nAndy Cohen\n\nDr. Moon\n\nArchie the dog\n\nMe\n\nI just wish it was my house she clipped.\n\nShannon has not issued a public statement, too busy leaking stories about supposed injuries to make herself sympathetic. So we’re left to piece together the details of her drunkenly crashing a car into a house and then pretending to walk a dog. How did she know to bring a pet as an alibi? I need much more information than is currently available from Ring camera footage and a lawyer’s statement acknowledging her arrest. And guilt.\n\nThe most likely outcome is Shannon leaping up on a pedestal of recovery, then soon falling off. Because resolutions from Shannon are as reliable as the hourly weather forecast app (which is flat out messing with you).\n\nTamra - who takes hostility to a ‘release the flying monkeys’ level - is pretending she’s upset about Shannon’s troubles. Please. She’d be flat out gleeful if not for worry about the Tres Amigas tour, which was probably counted on to pay the rent.\n\nBack to this week’s episode. Jenn has been driven crying from the dinner table and I cannot process how she ever speaks to Tamra again. Marrying the cheating weirdo is actually safer than continuing the most toxic friendship in history.\n\nThe next morning on the way to drinking with turtles the women split into two vehicles, allowing Desperate and Desperater to ramble on about Heather. AS IF Heather is the big story! Here’s what I think Gina hates about Heather:\n\nSix kids in bunkbeds jammed into Gina’s condo\n\nHere’s what I think Emily hates about Heather:\n\nNothing; she’s faking the animosity for a non-Shane storyline.\n\nVicki overreacts to parasailing because half her act is screaming, and soon it’s time for another dinner so nasty it makes feeding time in a shark tank look civil. “It’s so pretty you look so beautiful let’s quick get the sex jokes out of the way so we can get back to attacking the weak!”\n\nThis time it’s Shannon’s turn to set up Jenn. “Did you really resolve this with Tamra?” Why Jenn does not say “drop the subject, bitch” I don’t know. She allows this every time. Vicki chimes in with her personal experience - “I left my husband for a loser and I got burned bad,” forgetting how she complained ON THE SHOW that Donn had no interest in her sexually. Jenn is gaslighted into believing these attacks are meant constructively and come from a place of worry about her. She might be beyond my help.\n\nThe next morning Shannon finally brushes her teeth and Emily and Gina continue to go at Heather. And Heather finally seems to react, though I would have preferred her to smile proudly at their comparative poverty. If lording it over them is annoying them, keep doing it.\n\nVicki, Tamra, Shannon and Jenn go to a shaman, and I don’t know what that is but apparently the guy has skill in not bursting out laughing when a bitch like Tamra says “I want to come from a place of love.” She’s spiritually moved to apologize to Jenn, who is spiritually dumb enough to accept it.\n\nIf I were there I would have skipped the religious experience with the mean girls and gone shopping with the other mean girls, even though Heather looks miserable at being constantly critiqued. Taylor is sympathetic and astutely says “it’s the money.” Indeed it is.\n\nOver a fun lunch in some kind of couch-based treehouse restaurant that gives Shannon a chance to flail around like me trying to skateboard, Tamra goes on the attack. And what choice does she have - more attractive women aren’t going to bully themselves. She pivots to Heather because she just fake reconciled with Jenn five minutes ago. Soon everyone is yelling “she called you a loser at Bravocon!” Wasn’t Bravocon last year? Talk about saving something to throw out on camera! Nothing about this season comes across organic.\n\nAnyhow, Heather has finally had it. She quits, she claims. Yet she is in the scenes for next week wearing circus attire. These women are at their most hilarious when battling in costume, so I am here for it. Almost as much as for Shannon’s sentencing.\n\nYes, I do play Housewife favorites. But Heather Dubrow isn’t one of them, so you can trust my assessment that she’s being targeted by an OC streetgang called Thirsty & Jealous. But it’s child’s play compared to the outright bullying of Jenn, who is being kicked around like an unclaimed soccer ball in the parking lot at the FIFA World Cup.\n\nWe start with Emily being defensive about whatever ‘Heather at Bravocon’ accusation she just made, which she admitted last week on WWHL that she’d gotten wrong. “I don’t make up conversations!” But I sometimes fuck up the details, like who said what.\n\nHeather storms off, later returning to give out gifts that say “I can afford to buy presents for my enemies - enjoy your guilt and your monogrammed hat.”\n\nThe next day Emily delivers her daily insincere apology, and the women ride atv’s and jump into some jungle wastewater. No thanks. Not today, leeches and bacteria.\n\nMuch shampooing, disinfectant, and blow drying later, they dress for dinner, which includes mocking Jenn’s designer bag as a knock off. This is done by knock off face, hair, and body Tamra, oblivious to the irony.\n\nVicki is back! I’ll say it again - Vicki was great for this show, and her absence has left a hole big enough to drive an atv though while carrying a whole set of knock off Fendi luggage filled with hair extensions. If you really prefer watching Taylor stand around and do absolutely nothing, I don’t know why you watch the show. I have to add a caveat, which is another unpopular opinion, and this one surprised even me: I’m sick of the Tres Amigas schtick. Woo hoo. [yawn]\n\nVicki’s surprise appearance at dinner is about as welcome to Gina and Emily as salmonella poisoning, and I’m glad because I can’t stand them this season. Or any season, to be honest. Everyone drinks their way first to Cirque de Soleil and then to Truth or Dare, which involves:\n\nmaking Taylor into that idiot kid you can convince to do something stupid, then laugh at her under the guise of laughing with her\n\nslamming Jenn’s head into a wall, or the emotional equivalent of it\n\nVicki - who I don’t think has ever met Ryan - tells Jenn she needs to run from her relationship, as it is similar to the Brooks thing. Personally I prefer Brooks to Ryan, so Vicki's advice is not wrong. But of course how would Vicki have known anything about this. It is a really good friend who’d travel all the way to Mexico to insult your frenemy’s relationship. Tamra is lucky to have Vicki.\n\nThe next morning they do water aerobics, reassuring freaked out Shannon that she is fine to wear a bathing suit no matter how much fat-shaming she’s endured from the love of her life. “Oh come on, take off the caftan!” say women excited to look thinner by comparison.\n\nAfter some discussion about how calling Emily a Snuffleupagus could be complimentary (maybe Snuffleupagus isn’t a loud bitch?), they settle down to make sausage jokes over breakfast. Before they are even done mocking Steve’s brown ‘n serve, it’s already time for Jenn’s daily beatdown.\n\nGina starts it up, teeing up Jenn so Tamra can shove her to the ground. “Doesn’t it bother you what Vicki said last night?” Jenn is thus double-dog-dared to react to something she ignored 12 hours ago.\n\nAdd to this dare that Tamra is ready to leak more information. She has screenshots of Ryan’s texts with the women he cheated on Jenn with. [Who do I pay to read them?] Jenn apparently knew that Tamra had these screenshots, and foolishly thought they wouldn’t be revealed by the meanest woman on television. If you know Tamra, and you are a bit more attractive than she is, run like you’re being chased by a rabid animal. Because you sort of are. Although a rabid animal isn’t going to claim to be worrying about you as a friend.\n\nJenn is scrambling - ‘I don’t know her ok I know her I never talked to her that’s a baited question I talked to her it was just one time we were on a break I know everything I forgive him.’ This girl needs a self esteem transplant, stat. Why would anyone forgive this serial cheater, when serial cheating isn’t even his least appealing trait? Do I need my eyes checked? Because Travis Kelce, he ain’t.\n\nDespite Jenn’s discomfort bordering on panic, Tamra tells everyone that:\n\nRyan was sleeping with “Alex” while he was with Jenn\n\nit occurred more than once\n\nhe texted Alex while at a concert with Jenn and the text contained the word naked and the word bed\n\nthis isn’t the only person he fucked at the gym\n\neven Emily’s mother-in-law knows about it\n\n“But I’ll say no more.” Oh, except that you ruined your whole family. And your Fendi is fake.\n\nDr. Moon - the genius who makes a living flattering money out of Shannon - is back. And he’s making a questionable investment in Shannon’s mystery business. It’s a colonic, which I’m defining as an enema designed by a heavy drinker with no background in medicine or bioengineering. Beware the Shanema; you’d probably be better off with undercooked seafood at a rest stop.\n\nHeather hosts a fancy dinner to promote her “HD” brand, which is a television network. Wait, I thought firestick was the network? I can’t follow exactly what it is, but Netflix need not worry.\n\nThe dinner is a clinic on how to spend so much money on decor that friends become actively hostile towards you. Shannon can’t be there because she is sick, in case you think Dr. Moon actually improves her health. The food is over the top, unless you’re the type who enjoys multi colored potato chips served under a glass dome. Emily does not, and drunkenly mocks it all. “I think you should put your initials on more things. Is there sand in the salad?”\n\nThe next day, fake sick Shannon is complaining to Tamra that Heather called her out for ignoring an invitation yet again, missing that she is admitting to repeated rudeness. The news breaks that Heather and Terry sold their house for more money than the rest of these women have combined. So it’s time to seize on ‘not being told’ as an excuse to talk shit about her.\n\nApparently it’s not just me who has a skeeved out reaction to Ryan. Jenn’s mother has only now relented and agreed to meet the guy who ruined her daughter’s marriage; but only if it can be filmed for television. We don’t hear what her impressions were, but I can only imagine, considering he:\n\nDressed like a 24-year-old NFL player trying to make a fashionista impression getting off the team bus\n\nOpens the conversation with “I’m sure Jenn has told you I wasn’t faithful?”\n\nEnds all sentences as if they are questions.\n\nI don’t care what they tell us in the next episode. There is no way she could have liked him.\n\nRandomly the women decide to immediately fly to Mexico. And just as randomly, Shannon’s health is recovered and she is able to go. The resort looks gorgeous and they spend a minute admiring it before turning on Heather for being wealthier than they can even pretend to be.\n\nHeather - who no one wanted to partner up with in room selection - has two excuses for not telling them she sold her house:\n\nShe had an NDA which has oddly now expired\n\nEveryone has been mean and she didn’t feel comfortable telling them.\n\nThe real reason, of course, is that she is not close to any of them.\n\nEmily is either developing a drinking problem or masking insecurity with bravado, or both. She goes postal on Heather. “I’m sorry you have HD everywhere!! You’re a fucking liar! You body shamed me!” I’m jealous you have more money than me and don’t have to live with Shane!\n\nYou know what no one ever requests but we keep getting anyway? Crossover shows. For the love of God did anyone want the Jetsons to meet the Flintstones? Who’s the Boss intertwined with Three’s Company? No. Yet tonight the Housewives of Orange County mixes with Million Dollar Listing, and we don’t even get a tour of the mansion and a champagne open house. The real purpose here is showcasing Heather’s wealth, which really didn’t need showcasing. Unlike many prior Orange County housewives, Heather has serious money and didn’t get it via grifting; nor is she one failed skincare line away from bankruptcy.\n\nEmily is SO desperate for screen time that she’s going to take motorcycle lessons. I have an idea - put on a helmet and battle Shane! But no. Suddenly Shane is normal and Emily wants to “try new thingsl” Gina claims she didn’t know this get together was motorcycle-related. I feel like if a friend said meet me at the motorcycle dealership I’d have already asked some follow up questions and drawn a conclusion. Gina pulls them back to a more interesting topic - Shannon’s constant references to and embellishments of Gina’s DUI. Like many heavy drinkers, Shannon enjoys the alcohol-fueled troubles of others.\n\nJohn scratching Shannon’s back with what he incorrectly assumes is an appealing facial expression was tough to snack through, but I managed it. Messy-haired proudly just-out-bed Shannon is feeling especially emboldened. She pronounces that even if John is elusive, disinterested, and distant, he does occasionally have sex with her. So things are great, and their lives are no one else’s business. That phrase, coming from someone who collects paychecks for sharing their business, should warrant time in a penalty booth, like in hockey. Ditto for people who talk over their time in debates.\n\nJenn and Ryan work out to show us how attractive they think they are, then discuss possibly getting married. Jenn is afraid to marry this fool, a conclusion she claims to have reached based on his inability to get through a 4 week breakup without having sex with someone else. My thoughts:\n\nIt was not merely someone else - it was someone Jenn knows. Is Orange County that small? Otherwise she might want to think about how intentionally he meant to hurt her.\n\nWhy was there a 4 week breakup in the first place? The backstory is getting lost in the sauce.\n\nI agree Jenn should be afraid to marry Ryan, who is equal parts scam artist and teenager. “Just you and me and those boobies.” I seriously would have asked him to leave.\n\nNot to be outdone, Tamra and Eddie give us their cutesy couples workout routine, adding in a plan to spice up their lovelife. I am legit afraid it’s going to involve us.\n\nHeather and Shannon meet for lunch, but nothing is getting fixed, if the ‘angry victim’ look on Shannon’s face can be used as a barometer. Heather gives a qualified apology which Shannon claims to appreciate, but privately tells us she finds fake. I’ve said this before - Shannon enjoys feeling wronged. Being sad makes her happy. It’s part of why she’s such a good choice for a show like this.\n\nTaylor, on the other hand, whose whole season is basically hair extensions and calling everyone “Beautiful” with fake enthusiasm, isn’t such a good choice. She’s trying though, and invites everyone to a pumpkin carving party. Festivities include going out into a field to “choose a pumpkin,” which is code for “get clarification of Shannon’s CPS dig at Gina.”\n\nShannon staggers in late with self-created medical drama caused by an unneeded vitamin IV. Her hypochondria is meant to both garner attention and deflect blame. She knows she might have harmed Gina enough to be confronted, so time to act a little woozy.\n\nAnd of course Tamra, the Orange County Pot Stirring Champion for the last ten years running, brings it up. Tamra tells Shannon that the CPS story is going around, courtesy of Jenn. But not courtesy of Tamra herself, who heard it as loud and clear as all the rest of us did but suddenly doesn’t remember. Shannon vehemently denies it. “What are you talking about? Never said it! God strike me dead!” It’s such a strongly delivered grandstanding lie I think she might have what it takes to run for governor.\n\nGod isn’t getting involved in striking Shannon dead, and is probably rolling his eyes and muttering ‘here we go again.’ No lightning strike is needed, because the proof is in the camera footage of Shannon saying exactly what Jenn says she said, and Tamra right there hearing it. Do Shannon and Tamra not know how cameras work? Btw, does anyone know if Tamra’s podcast sidekick/sycophant Teddi Mellencamp called her out on this? Because if anyone else in all of Bravoland was caught lying this red handedly, Teddi would devote a whole show to it.\n\nTo deflect from ineffective denying of the undeniable, Shannon changes the subject to insulting Travis’s penis size, then claims chest pain and leaves. Once the elephant has literally left the room, Tamra turns on Heather for staging paparazzi pictures, as if Tamra herself is living some sort of low key life. Just her, Eddie, and a small camera crew."
