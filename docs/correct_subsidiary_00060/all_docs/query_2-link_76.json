Don't miss the Parthenon, the temple to Athena which looms over Athens from its perch atop the Acropolis, an eternal icon of art and civilization. Completed in 438 B.C., the temple still astounds as the flowering of Greek art and architecture. When you come down off the hill, don't miss a visit to the Ancient Agora, Syntagma Square, the Acropolis Museum and the city's historic centre, around Plaka. Ideally, sit and relax at a cafe on the foot of the hill, sample some Greek souvlaki or a frappe, take a glance back up the hill from time to time and give the goddess her due.\n\nSplit, built under the orders of the Roman emperor Diocletian, who lived out his last days after abdicating in AD 305, is located between Venice and the Ionian Islands, on the Dalmatian coast and is one of the most important ports of Croatia.
