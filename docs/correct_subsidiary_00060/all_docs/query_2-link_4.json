        "text": "Article By: Tom Richardson\n\nStarbucks tends to define customers’ expectations in the specialty coffee world, for better or worse. Today’s Starbucks launch of the Pumpkin Spice latte marks their 20th anniversary of promoting the single most successful seasonal drink. Ergo coffee shop patrons will start looking for pumpkin lattes wherever they buy their coffee drinks. I’m not suggesting independent shops copy every Starbucks’ move, but I do recommend introducing this “autumn” staple drink sooner rather than later. When it comes to building a pumpkin pie/pumpkin spice latte we have a range of products that can get you there. Below I’ve described their differences in terms of taste and applications as well as a basic cost breakdown for each product.\n\nPumpkin Pie Sauce (64 oz jug)\n\nThis Torani product makes an excellent hot pumpkin latte. The thicker sauce\n\nconsistency gives a fuller mouthfeel and richer taste than a syrup. It can be\n\nused in an iced version if the sauce is whisked thoroughly\n\nPumpkin Pie Syrup & Pumpkin Spice Syrup\n\n(750 ml glass bottle)\n\nWe carry both versions of pumpkin-flavored syrups from Monin and Torani. I would describe the spice version as having a sharper, spicier flavor profile than the pie version. In the words of the manufacturer, the pumpkin pie version includes a “crust” flavor. For the record, I don’t recommend using the word “crust” in any drink description. The syrups are easy to use in general but work especially well in an iced or blended drink because they readily dissolve and infuse with flavor. Torani also offers their Pumpkin Pie syrup in a sugar free version.\n\nPumpkin Spice Latte powder (3.5 lb. bag)\n\nThis product from Café Essentials has two elements that set it apart from the others – it contains coffee so it’s already a “latte” and it’s a frappe powder that makes a true iced blended drink. If you want to make an iced blended pumpkin drink using a syrup or sauce you need also to use some sort of frappe base (i.e., vanilla bean or cream base) to give it body and hold it together or it will separate within seconds after blending. This product works as a standalone – ice, milk/alt milk, powder in the blender, and let ‘er rip. Not a bad option while it’s still 100 degrees outside.\n\nCost Per Serving\n\nSyrups (3/4 oz) for 12 oz hot:\n\nMonin: 23 cents, Torani Puremade: 21 cents, Torani standard: 20 cents\n\nTorani Sauce (1 oz) ) for 12 oz hot:\n\n32 cents\n\nPumpkin Spice Latte Powder:\n\n(note – does not require espresso)\n\n12 oz Hot (50 grams) $0.91; 16 oz iced blended 90 grams for $1.64\n\nWe’ll continue to provide updates about new products we bring in and if you have any interest in trying anything mentioned here please let us know and we can host you at our palatial warehouse or come out to your location and make some drinks."
