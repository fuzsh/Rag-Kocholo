        "text": "Enjoyed an outstanding meal at Woodberry Kitchen over the weekend. Highways cooperated in both directions, making this trek from Northern Virginia not so difficult. Beto, Inox and others have vividly portrayed the striking surroundings of the space, and the critical focus on local sourcing, so I’ll jump straight to the flavors.\n\nPhilly’s own Vieux Carré Absinthe features prominently in the drink listing, including the bartender’s favorite “absinthe frappe”. A standard pour for me arrived a few degrees above the ideal temperature, the auto-verseur acting up a bit with delay tactics.\n\nWoodberry’s “Headless Horseman” is well worth the loss of your noggin. Bourbon with house-brewed spiced pumpkin syrup, served in a copper mug, one of the best cocktails I’ve enjoyed all year. Large, flat ice cubes, deftly mixed, with the house-standard bamboo stirrer, an outstanding liquid representation of autumn.\n\nRoasted Oysters Rock (Rockefeller both upstaged and outclassed) arrived as OOUS (oysters of unusual size) plated over warm rock salt. Not overcooked by a single degree, these were exceptional bivalves. The essence of pernod and warmed salt from the oysters played remarkably well with flavors from absinthe. Green fairy meets shimmering mermaid, a highly recommended pairing.\n\nFrom the snack menu, we chose radishes with tarragon butter and sea salt (simple, French perfection; an indulgence of sense and sensibility) and deviled eggs with ham (remarkably light with pleasing horseradish after-nip).\n\nWe also ordered kitchen pickles and olives to enjoy throughout the meal. However, these turned out to deliver the only flat note of the night. With New Heights taking my expectation of house-made pickles to, well, new heights, this rendition seemed hollow and listless. Devoid of dill, garlic, juniper, or other seasoning, these carried just a hefty dose of vinegar and overt sweetening. The crisp texture was fine, but flavors and interest perplexingly absent. With everything else so spot on throughout the menu, I can’t help but think I received an off batch of what should have been a bracing palate cleanser.\n\nInsofar as main dishes, my dining companion enjoyed the impossibly tender short ribs. I elected the short rib, onion jam, kale, and asiago flatbread. I would have sworn the flour was milled that very same day, shockingly fresh and flavorful. Toppings were masterfully balanced both in flavor and in quantity. And yes, unmistakable wood-burning flavor manifests throughout, lovely wisps of smoke and quiet sighs of char.\n\nFor desserts, some assembly is required at Woodberry, but overwhelmingly worth it. The Sweet Potato Pie and Flourless Chocolate Cake are well worth your tines, and more than worth the calories. Make sure you mix all the flavors on the plate together, don’t forgo this step lest you stop just short of amazing.\n\nA few more random tips for the first time visitor:\n\n➢I was a bit worried on the dark walk from the parking lot to the restaurant. It’s a short trek, no more than 150 yards, but no sidewalk exists between the two areas. This causes you to walk in the path of oncoming traffic, although slow-moving and mostly infrequent. Free valet parking is available. This may cost you a few bucks with gratuity, but would be a smart investment to avoid brief but potentially anxiety-raising ambling before and after your meal.\n\n➢The food and environment will delight you, but don’t expect to be wowed by the bathrooms near the restaurant entrance. They do not appear to have been part of the careful upgrading for the rest of the renovated mill space. The hallway in that area actually smelled a little funny, like rain leaking into an old building. And not a single Dyson Airblade in sight!\n\n➢You must, must, must get there early and you must, must, must eat at the bar. The best bar seats in the house are the ones closest to the wood-burning oven. Service is exceptional, and the hubbub of activity serves as it’s own entertainment. By the time you’ll be done with your meal, those bar seats will be needed for the droves of folks arriving for peak dining hours.\n\n➢Order liberally from the snacks menu. For $1-$5, these whimsical servings brought to mind a more refined version of the “amuse yourself” menu from Arlington’s EatBar.\n\n➢While watching workers in both the front and back of the house, their remarkable level of focus struck me as a hallmark of excellence and a differential advantage. I spoke somewhat at length with a few staff who expressed immense appreciation and pride with being part of Woodberry Kitchen. This is a restaurant team that’s deeply engaged in what they are doing. They are making every moment and every morsel count.\n\nAnd I’m counting, too. The days until I return. Hopefully, a short recitation.\n\nI'm going to have to post something now from our dinner here this past weekend or it'll never post. This is a longer one so be forewarned those who don't like more detailed posts. Also, this one isn't as organized and informed as some I do. It was tougher because I didn't get a copy of our itemized receipt or take a copy of the menu--sheesh. So, with those caveats fully disclosed, here goes from memory.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nWe were a group of eight including a couple of connected Baltimoreans, one serious food couple and their two adult sons. One of the sons had been four times in the last few months and served as a bit of an enthusiastic guide. My +1 and I were the only first timers. I know, big gap given how long WK has been open. We'd booked a month or more ago and were really looking forward to it. WK has a reputation I now know is deserved that goes beyond the very serious farm-to-table efforts they make (i.e., ramps and asparagus were all over the menu; 9 varieties of all-Chesapeake raw oysters were sorted according to salinity). I'm not sure I know any other restaurants in our area that break down whole animals of all types regularly. The \"tavern steak\" on their menu is so named because it's always different cuts depending on what they have. In this way, they can keep food costs down while still putting out great quality food and treating their staff particularly well. Judging by our experience, that strategy is working in the biggest of ways.\n\nVENUE\n\nMuch has already been written so I'll just make three observations here that may be newer/different:\n\n1. As others have said, the space is gorgeous with all the restoration, reclaimed woods, the use of high shelving (to display preserved foods) and vertical space (catwalk seating). It reminds me of a sort of mix of a sophisticated gastro/brew pub (a la birch & barley) and a mountain town venue as one might find atop a peak at Telluride or Vail. Pretty cool.\n\n2. As much as I can tell from all the posts above, most of the venue comments were about the big room with the open kitchen, bar and two levels for seating with upper level overlooking the main floor. Maybe due to the size of our group, we were seated in a different room that most pass on the way in. Also large with shelves and just a wait station, we had a great time at a large corner table they'd set for us. Fun but easy to talk. Some of the repeat visitors thought it quieter than the main room FWIW so maybe something others could request if that's important to you.\n\n3. Something about the charcuterie/whole animal processing focus along with the venue's architectural characteristics also reminded me of a place in Atlanta I recently tried and enjoyed (thanks to BettyJoan and about which I also still need to post!) called Holeman & Finch.\n\nSERVICE\n\nReally outstanding from both efficiency and effectiveness perspectives. It's awful I can't remember our server's name but he was great. All the normal explanations would apply supporting a great service assertion: attentive/not intrusive, we never wanted for anything, waters refilled (both still and sparkling with separate pitchers) regularly, etc, etc. But it really went way beyond that.\n\nGiven the nature of our group, our server fielded many questions about the food, provenance, technique, the building, history, wines, the staff, you name it. He knew everything. He answered everything asked with authority, substance and not a speck of arrogance. We all learned a lot and this really enhanced the experience. But it goes even further. Yes, this was a uniquely great service experience even relative to the finest fine dining spots.\n\nI mentioned to our server that I was interested to know what coffee they serve. He answered it was Counter Culture and then asked if I'd be interested to meet the person who \"heads the coffee program.\" Suffice to say, that really piqued my interest. A restaurant with a \"coffee program?\"\n\nSure enough, over came Allie, who leads a team of baristas who make all the coffee drinks separate from the regular table service staff. I chatted with her for maybe 15 minutes and she was pretty fab in all respects. Allie really knows coffee, knew all the good spots in DC, the roasters, even from around the country (it's a closeknit community). Though we'd already ordered a large french press of whatever the CC columbian was that they had, I also asked Allie for a cappuccino since I had to put the baristas to the test. Sure enough, it was a technically excellent and delicious cap.\n\nFinal note on service. I'm not sure if this is typical at WK and, to the best of my knowledge, none of us were known to the staff as anything other than regular joes and janes. One among us was a media person so possible they knew that but no sign of it. At two points in the meal, they brought out things for us to try without charge. This was always explained practically rather than altruistically. Two orders of deviled eggs after drinks were brought to our table to \"tide us over\" until the apps came out. At the end of the meal, 2 or 3 unfamiliar desserts appeared because we only ordered two at the table and the waiter (staff? restaurant?) really wanted us to better appreciate the work of their pastry chef. .\n\nAll in, the staff made this seem more like dining at someone's (palatial) home than at a restaurant. Great fun and a very rich experience.\n\nDRINKS\n\nFirst, cocktails. Several people ordered them and loved them. It's a crime I can't tell you what they were except for one with vodka served in a copper handled cup which is one of their best known. The friend next to me ordered a \"lemonade\" (not on the menu) and was instead served what they call an \"Apricade.\" It had sweetness, just a touch of tartness and bits of apricot in the drink. Non-alcoholic, I loved this and had two. Redefined refreshing for me. I'd kll to have access to this on any beach vacation.\n\nI don't think anyone had beer but we went through either two or three bottles of a very nice red from Maryland. I'll be honest here, out myself and say I was relatively clueless about the existence of a wine industry in Maryland let alone any specifics about vineyards or varietals being produced. I'd noticed ChoirGirl's \"part time pourer\" signature here on dr.com but had never looked up \"Black Ankle Vineyards\" before. The red we all very much enjoyed was from there. The label didn't make clear what type of grape it was and, with all our other questions and conversation with the staff, we didn't ask. It was a bigger red, 2009 vintage, cab/bordeaux style I'd guess. Very good. I was impressed enough to look up the vineyard when I got home and, beyond that, sure enough, there are dozens of vineyards in Maryland (he learned sheepishly). in fact, more than 50 are listed right here.\n\nFOOD\n\nAgain, this is all from memory and we ordered a large number of things so this is just a sampling mixing starters and mains:\n\n- Boneless ribeye--our friend who ordered this raved about it and it looked mouth watering. Very reminiscent of the delicious roseda ribeye we enjoyed at Society Fair the week before. Wish I knew more about this dish but, alas...\n\n- Deviled eggs--one of the better versions I've had in awhile. Smooth texture but with excellent flavor enhanced way beyond just yolk and mayonnaise.\n\n- Stuffed ham with ramps and asparagus. Two of us ordered this as it was one of the more unusual things on the menu and really featured the house curing and spring vegetables. It was great. Loved the ham. Perfectly cured with just enough but not too much salt. It was served atop an oyster stuffing; also excellent.\n\n- Baked oyster starter. I had one, thought it pretty excellent and can't even do it justice to describe it. Maybe called Mason or something like that? Asian flavors? Yuzu? Mirin? Not sure but good. Very good.\n\n- Whole roasted black bass. This was really the only miss of the night. It was dry and overcooked. No doubt they'd have redone it had we asked but we didn't give them that chance. It looked impressive when served.\n\n- Chicken liver pate: Wow! We had some at the table not so enamored with pates but everyone LOVED this. So smooth, flavorful and nuanced. Served in a jar. Really memorable.\n\n- Charcuterie board. This came with a salami, bresaola, corned tongue (mmm) and a prosciutto-like ham that wasn't prosciutto\n\n- Beef and noodles. That may be the exact name of this main dish that two among us ordered and which I tried. As with most everything else, the ingredients really shone through on an otherwise simple but absolutely delicious dish.\n\n- Flatbreads. There's a separate section of these on the menu and maybe three were ordered. They were finished and I can't really comment more other than to make the connection to the bread service. Mayby 3 or 4 different kinds of bread incling a wheat, french country style, all really well done.\n\nThere were 4 or 5 desserts at our table between two that had been ordered and 2 or 3 more that we were given. One, a pudding served in a wide-mouthed jar, was just okay. Another with loads of fresh blueberries was wonderful. Can't recall the others as I didn't try most of the desserts and was more focused on the coffees.\n\nVALUE\n\nSurprisingly good. Eight people. Plenty of starters and desserts. 2 bottles of wine. A few cocktails with and without alcohol. Coffees. All the mains. More than I've posted above. Total for us pre tax and tip was less than $700.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nWoodberry Kitchen is a truly special and unique place with seriously dedicated and talented professionals resident in the kitchen and front of the house in all areas. Crazy I hadn't been here before but now that I've been, we'll be back for sure."
