Don't miss the Parthenon, the temple to Athena which looms over Athens from its perch atop the Acropolis, an eternal icon of art and civilization. Completed in 438 B.C., the temple still astounds as the flowering of Greek art and architecture. When you come down off the hill, don't miss a visit to the Ancient Agora, Syntagma Square, the Acropolis Museum and the city's historic centre, around Plaka. Ideally, sit and relax at a cafe on the foot of the hill, sample some Greek souvlaki or a frappe, take a glance back up the hill from time to time and give the goddess her due.\n\nThessaloniki is the second major economic, industrial, commercial and political centre in Greece, after Athens.

Ano Poli is the highest point in Thessaloniki and as such, is the location of the city's acropolis, its Byzantine fort, the Heptapyrgion, a large portion of the city's remaining walls, and with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing.

The palace was the seat of the legendary King Minos and has been associated with famous Greek myths, like that of Daedalus and Icarus, the Labyrinth and the Minotaur. The incredible complex houses a warren of rooms decorated with columns and frescoes\n\nSantorini is essentially what remains of an enormous volcanic explosion dated back 3,600 years (between 1627- 1600 BC) and which created the current geological caldera: a giant central lagoon, more or less rectangular, measuring about 12 by 7 km. The effect is still explosive: 300-m-high steep cliffs on three sides rise from sea level, cubic white houses surrounded by pink bougainvilleas glow in the Aegean sun. The wild beauty, the fascinating Caldera, the gold sunset, of the Number 1 destination in Greece will steal your heart away!\n\nWelcome to Greece's most famous cosmopolitan island, a whitewashed paradise in the heart of the Cyclades.
