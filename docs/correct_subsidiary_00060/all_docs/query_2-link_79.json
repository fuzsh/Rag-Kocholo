        "text": "STAY TUNED for one last blog post featuring a photo gallery and final statement of each FSP member!!!\n\nSites visited: Marathon, Thorikos, Lavrion, Sounion\n\nGroup leaders: Teddy, Zhenwei\n\nBlog: Emmanuel, Hunter\n\nThis is the end, the finale, the last day of class in Greece. It is very hard to overstate how monumental this accomplishment feels, and the group began the day in high spirits as we began to look back on the past 11 weeks.\n\nThe first stop was Marathon, one of the most important sites in Greek, and more specifically Athenian, history. Miss Katie started things off with a nice lecture about the battle and discussed what we know about the battle from both the primary sources such as Herodotus and the archeological evidence. For those of you who do not know, Marathon occurred during the first invasion of the Persians in 490 BCE with 9000 Athenians and 1000 Plataeans facing about 30000 Persians. This resulted in 203 Greek casualties (192 Athenians, 11 Plataeans) and 6400 Persian casualties. The Athenians effectively prevented the first Persian invasion in a single battle.\n\nOn site, there was not much to see except the tumulus for the Athenian casualties. However, surrounding the area were several Mycenaean and Neolithic sites, and the group traveled to the local museum to see the finds of the surrounding area. Among the finds was the Ionic capital commemorating the victory of the Athenians, Neolithic remains from a cave, several shaft graves, and the remains of an Egyptian cult popular during the Hellenistic period.\n\nThe next stop was Thorikos and Lavrion to see some very interesting Greek mines that possibly were in use during the Mycenaean period to produce large quantities of lead with some silver mixed in. Nestled in the hills were several shaft graves, a regular tholos, and an elliptical tholos tomb excavated by the Belgians. Lower on the site was the classical site complete with a trapezoidal theater and “washeries” to separate rock slag from the heavier lead and silver. Then, it was time for a quick trip into the hills to visit Lavrion and more mines. Since Lavrion was the site of the major Athenian silver strike of 484 that helped provide the funding for the Athenian navy, it was very interesting to see what was left of such a historically rich site.\n\nThe final site of the entire trip was Sounion. Sounion housed a temple to Athena, a small hero shrine and the Temple of Poseidon. The group took the time to do a final round of autopsy on the temple of Athena discovering a colonnade that only wrapped around the south and east sides. Next up was the ship sheds that functioned as the heart of the Delian league to deliver news quickly to Athens or to travel around the Aegean collecting the yearly tribute. These ship sheds were made of marble emphasizing their importance and showed the overall historical importance of Sounion as a site. Last up was the temple of Poseidon. One interesting fact of this temple is that Lord Elgin etched his name on this temple around the time he took the Parthenon sculpture back to England. The group took the time to take a final picture to commemorate the trip.\n\nThe group then took a relaxing break at the nearby café (with complementary beverages provided by Dartmouth) to remember these last 11 weeks before hoping on the bus to take the two hour long bus ride back into Athens for the last time. On the bus was a feeling of excitement as the group began to realize we had made it…finally. The bus arrived back at the hotel and everyone departed to get dinner and prepare to return home.\n\nIt has been an honor to participate in this trip, and, as the final bloggers, we would like to thank you for reading. Thank you PCC, Professor Rutter, and Katie for making this trip possible. We look forward to returning home, and we will never forget what we have learned here.\n\nHunter and Eman\n\nGROUP PICTURES: BEFORE AND AFTER\n\nBritish Museum Before:\n\nSounion After:\n\nFinal Dinner at The Yellow Squirrel:\n\nSites visited: Thermopylae, Kalapodhi, Archaeological Museum of Atalanti, Metrou, Lefkandi\n\nGroup leaders: Zack, Laurel\n\nBlog: Teddy, Zhenwei\n\nToday, when dawn with her rosy fingers shone once more, we woke up in our janky hotel in Volos ready for an 8 AM departure to Athens for our last few days in Greece (Insert sad face). We knew we had a long bus ride ahead of us, so everyone was hoping for a delicious nutritious breakfast spread. Alas, we were again disappointed. We found only cardboard chocolate bread and warm tang. Not every hotel can be the Victoria in Nafplion. Whatever. It got the job done, and we were all on to coach right on schedule.\n\nAfter an hour and a half or so of uneventful driving we took a quick rest stop at a janky roadside joint where Cam became livid about the absurd prices of the inferior quality cookies. After he got a hold of himself (But not before almost causing a serious scene) we got back on the bus and Professor Rutter informed us we’d be arriving shortly at Thermopylae, site of the epic last stand of the Spartan 300 in 480 B.C. Everyone was understandably excited to see what is arguably one of the most important sites in the history of the Western World. Eman and Hunter were especially excited given their love for all things ancient and warfare-ey.\n\nThe site caught us off-guard. When Professor Rutter told us we’d be making a quick stop many of us thought we were at yet another unpublished out-of-the-way Mycenaean palace site that only our man JR would know about. Instead, a rocky path lead up a small hillock at the top of which was not a Mycenaean palace but a small monument (cleverly paved with Lapis Lacadaemonius: a type of stone native to Spartan territory) erected to honor the memory of the Greeks who fell at the Battle of Thermopylae. At the center was a reproduction of the famous commemorative inscription that stood at the site in antiquity, attested by Pausanias. It reads (roughly): “Stranger, tell the Spartans we lie here, loyal to our words.” Or (more poetically): “Go tell the Spartans passerby, that here, loyal to our word we lie.” It was a very cool site, even though there was virtually nothing left in terms of archaeological remains and the topography has changed considerably since antiquity. What was once a narrow coastal mountain pass has been transformed by alluvial fill into a broad coastal plain. 300 Spartans would be hard pressed to hold the site nowadays. After some general tomfoolery around the statue of Leonidas at the bottom of the hillock and several train wreck group pictures (What else is new?) we were ready to get back on the road.\n\nOur next site was Kalapodhi, where we were privileged enough to receive an insightful lecture from Dr. Rainer Felsch. Dr. Felsch has been excavating at the site since 1970, so obviously he knows a thing or two about the site. He believes in antiquity it was the oracle of Apollo at Abai , and he showed us a number of interesting pieces of evidence to support this theory. Although there is not much left at the site in terms of physical remains, it has produced some incredible finds over the years including an iron sword, Mycenaean seals, wall painting fragments from an archaic temple, and layers of habitation stretching from pre-palatial Mycenaean to late Roman times. Dr. Felsch informed us about them all. After a brief Q&A session and a big thank you for Dr. Felsch, it was back on the coach to continue our odyssey.\n\nOur next stop was right nearby – the Archaeological Museum of Atalanti. The collection was pretty standard for small local museums – some Neolithic, some prehistoric, some Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman. Of particular interest was a Roman bronze lock that Dr. Felsch had mentioned at Kalapodhi. The real adventure of this stop, however, was Catherine D. getting locked in the bathroom. After a half hour of banging with a hammer and other assorted tools she was finally freed and was able to meet us in town for a quick gyro from a flustered purveyor of fine spinning meats.\n\nAfter the museum it was off to Metrou, where Professor Rutter excavated from 2004-2008. We didn’t make it over to the site proper, which is on an island linked to land by a causeway exposed only at low tide, but certainly found the time to stop by one of Prof. Rutter’s old local haunts for a frappe. It’s where he watched the world cup with the locals! Wild times……\n\nOur last stop before Athens was Lefkandi, to see the largest building (by far) to survive from the Greek Dark Age: the Lefkandi Heroon. Built around 975 B.C., it’s about half as long as a football field. Its would not be equaled until the late archaic period (~600 B.C.). It was purposefully demolished shortly after its construction and a tumulus raised over it. Nobody knows exactly why! Although the remains are not substantial, there’s certainly enough left to appreciate how imposing the structure must have been in its heyday. After a brief lecture and a few minutes to walk about and ponder the structures’ mysterious history we were back on the bus for the last leg of our journey back to our home away from home: The Illisia hotel, Athens.\n\nSites visited: Dimini, Volos, Pefkakia\n\nGroup leaders: Cam, Brett\n\nBlog: Zack, Laurel\n\nThe FSP may be coming to an end in the next few days (a fact that hasn’t quite sunk in yet for many of us), but for now our days are still full of sites and excitement. After an interesting breakfast (“It’s like a United Airlines breakfast.” –Zhenwei) at the hotel in Thebes, we got on the bus and drove for a few hours to Volos, a town in Thessaly that was the largest port in modern Greece until 1954, when a catastrophic earthquake destroyed much of the town and the Piraeus in Athens became the primary port. On the way to Volos, we passed Thermopylae and Cape Artemisium, sources of particular excitement for several members of the group. For anyone unfamiliar with the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480-479 BCE, Thermopylae was the site of the last stand of the 300 Spartans led by Leonidas against the Persian army, and Artemisium was the site of a major Greek naval victory over the Persians at the same time. We’ll be stopping there on our way back to Athens on June 1st.\n\nWhen we reached Volos, we made straight for the site of Dimini, just outside the modern town. Dimini is notable as one of the two major Neolithic sites in the area (along with Sesklo, which we could not visit due to time constraints), and for its Mycenaean remains. We were met at the site by Dr. Dimitra Rousioti, who started with a tour of the Neolithic remains. She pointed out the interesting layout of the settlement, consisting of six concentric walls arranged in pairs around a central, flat open area with a building facing the main entrance to the site. The building originally had two rectangular rooms, but was later modified to look like a Mycenaean megaron. Cist graves from the Middle Bronze Age were made at the site, as well as a small tholos built into the side of the hill of the settlement. This was an early clue that there was major Mycenaean activity in the area, and Dr. Rousioti also talked to us about the possible Mycenaean palatial sites in the area: Dimini, Palaia, and Pefkakia. This area is particularly significant to mythology enthusiasts as the site of ancient Iolkos was the home of Jason and the starting point of the quest for the Golden Fleece. Many of the local archaeologists want their site to be the palace of Jason.\n\nAfter a quick investigation of the two tholoi at Dimini, we hopped back onto the bus and met Dr. Rousioti at the Volos Museum. We took a quick look at the beautifully-painted grave stelae of the Hellenistic town of Dimitrias, but the main foci of our visit were the Neolithic finds and the local, recently-excavated material. The museum featured some of the masterpieces of Neolithic art, including some fine examples of Dimini ware (Late Neolithic pottery with black or polychrome decoration on a light background, often with checkerboard or spiral patterns, for those keeping score at home), clay and stone figurines, and clay house models. The recent finds from the area were also both beautiful and interesting. The finds from the intact tholos at Dimini included mold-produced beads of gold and blue glass. Prof. Rutter told us that the glass is likely Egyptian, and the gold, according to Dr. Rousioti, was likely from the Black Sea, which corresponds nicely with the myth of the Golden Fleece (it was kept at Colchis, on the eastern shore of the Black Sea). Based on the local finds, which also included a Canaanite amphora and a vessel made of lead from Laurion in Attica, Dimini and the other Mycenaean sites were integrated into trade networks reaching throughout the Aegean and beyond.\n\nWe made a quick stop at Pefkakia, where Dr. Anthe Efstathiou, the director of the excavations, was waiting for us. Unfortunately, we had less than ten minutes at the site before the automatic alarm system went off at 3 pm, so she only had time to show us a few impressively-conserved pots, including an unusual three-handled kylix. We spent the rest of the afternoon with a light lunch (and dessert, of course) at the nearby beach, and then headed back into Volos for a night of working on a paper. Overall, it was a varied and interesting day!\n\nSites visited: Thebes, Orchomenos, Gla\n\nGroup leaders: Laura, Catherine B.\n\nBlog: Cam, Brett\n\nOur day began with several members of the group ill or fighting illness. Laurel and Professor Rutter fought colds, while Teddy spent the day in a bathroom somewhere due to a nasty 24-hour virus. To put a further damper on things, we were back at Hotel Korinthos which is the proud holder of the “Worst Breakfast in Greece By A Lot” title for at least the last 7 weeks. However, it was yet another blue bird day in Greece, so it was hard for anyone to be too upset.\n\nThe first trip on the bus was rather long as we drove from Corinth (in the northern Peloponnese) up through Boetia to the modern city of Thebes. Interestingly enough, this is also the site of the ancient city of Thebes. We were fortunate to get a private tour of the archaeological museum at Thebes from Dr. Yiannis Fappas despite the fact that it’s closed to the public due to renovations. We’ve seen many museums by now, so it was interesting to see the exhibits in their “development stages”– think of pieces of archaic sculpture lying on the ground next to horns of consecration lying on the ground next to an exposed electrical outlet. Particularly notable was a glass floor (similar to the one at the Parthenon Museum) that provides a view down into the excavations of the fortification wall around the ancient city directly beneath the museum. We then got a tour of the storage rooms and got to see restoration work in progress, including a variety of Late Helladic I pottery (which excited Professor Rutter very much) and a massive wall painting from the Palace at Kadmeia. The work on the wall painting was particularly impressive, as every piece was retrieved from the rubble of the palace. The restoration team is recreating a processional scene that they have determined includes at least seven different women for which they have no general outine from which to work. It’s like trying to do a puzzle with half the pieces and no picture on the box.\n\nAfter leaving the museum, we drove up to Orchomenos to look at yet another tholos tomb. This one is believed to have been based on the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae because it shares the exact same dimensions and plan. The most unique features of this one was the carving in the ceiling blocks of the side chamber. It also contains a later altar, as it was converted into an imperial cult site by the Romans… damn Romans.\n\nWe walked across the street for lunch next to a 9th century church (one of the oldest functioning churches in Greece). It made of spolea (the remains of past buildings), so it is interesting to try to pick out the familiar blocks we’ve seen in other buildings. Professor Rutter took the opportunity to quiz a few of our affiliated members on their knowledge of the Greek alphabet that appeared on an ancient sundial– no one was able to identify digamma, a letter that was used only in antiquity.\n\nThe final stop with our guide was a group of 14 chamber tombs on a hillside above the Copaic Basin. The plain was historically significant in itself because it was the scene of the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BCE (marking Philip II’s conquest of southern Greece) and the Battle of Kephissos (when a group of disgruntled Catalonian mercenaries slaughtered some knights and took their wives and kingdoms).\n\nProfessor Rutter then took us to Gla, the last site of the day. Gla is surrounded by a massive cyclopean fortification wall that encloses an area roughly 20 times greater than the citadel at Mycenae. The whole overgrown with thornbushes and thick shrubbery, so we had to fight to see the remains of what was debateably a palace. The long day left everyone thoroughly tired but made the good water pressure in the showers at the hotel that much better.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nCam and Brett\n\nSites visited: Lerna, Argos Museum, Naupflion Museum, Aigeira\n\nGroup leaders: Nina, Margo\n\nBlog: Laura, Catherine B.\n\nHouse of the Tiles “Cribs” episode:\n\nActual “MTV Cribs” episode for our less informed readers:\n\nWe had yet another busy day in the Peloponnese today, packing in as many sites as possible in our last week of the trip. We waved goodbye to our hotel at Naupflion and its delicious breakfast spread at eight a.m. sharp and boarded the coach with our sights set on Lerna, a site with rich prehistoric finds, especially from the Early Helladic period. While at Lerna, Professor Rutter lectured about the architecture found there. The House of the Tiles is an example of one of the earliest corridor houses, and is noteworthy for its monumental size and the eighty different types of sealings that were found inside. The structure had a predecessor referred to as “BG,” though we don’t think that it was a fraternity – probably just an earlier form of the corridor house. Additionally, Lerna was an important site in helping sort out the chronology of the Early and Middle Helladic periods due to its easily distinguishable layers of stratigraphy. Lerna was an important site and a good way to start our day!\n\nFor our second stop of the day, we headed over to the Argos Archaeological Museum (for the second time on this FSP! At least it wasn’t hailing this time), where we were able to take a closer look at many of the artifacts from Lerna and the rest of the Peloponnese. Professor Rutter focused on different types of pottery designs we saw. The Argive Geometric pyxis, for example, was of monumental scale and seemed to incorporate a quilt-like pattern in its decoration. We also noticed the addition of horse motifs in some pieces, and a variety of painting styles like polychrome and outline painting (black-figure did not yet exist). The museum had some interesting finds for us to look at, but soon enough we were moseying back onto the bus, gearing up for stop number three.\n\nA quick thirty minutes later, Christos had dropped us in the main parking lot of the harbor at Naupflion. Even though we checked out of our hotel earlier this morning, we were back at our favorite resort town to check out the contents of its Archaeological Museum, too. It was at this museum that we were able to take a look at some of the remains from the Franchthi Cave, especially thrilling to those of us that took Classics 6 last fall. The unassuming museum also contained some of the earliest pottery in Greece (from circa 7000 B.C.). Perhaps our favorite part, though, was the Dolphin mosaic from the tile floor at Tiryns. This really helped us connect the architectural remains we saw a few days ago with the artifacts that would have originally been at the site, as well. Upon leaving the museum, we had about ten minutes to literally run to buy gyros and proceed to shove them down our throats before boarding the bus again. As you can imagine, we all wished we had Tums after that.\n\nLuckily, we had an hour and a half long bus ride to digest on our way to Aigeira, which is mostly a Hellenistic site. In addition to two temples and a theater, the site was thought to have had a late fourth-century B.C. hotel-like structure (probably nowhere nearly as nice as Hotel Korinthos, though) that produced some neat pebble mosaics, perhaps influenced by the wall paintings at Sicyon. The site of Ancient Aigeira also had some prehistoric remains on its acropolis (which we, of course, climbed to the top of). Excavations on the acropolis show the remains of a Mycenaean fortification wall from the twelfth century BCE! After taking in the beautiful views from the top of the site, we descended the hill.\n\nAfter Aigeira, we were all hot, exhausted, and unexcited for our long ride back to Corinth. So, we were thrilled when Professor Rutter saved the day with an emergency ice-cream break! Popsicles and Magnum bars led to inevitable smiles, and made the prospect of staying in the grim town of Corinth for another night slightly more appealing. After a night of scavenging for restaurants and suffering through cold showers, we are off to bed in preparation for Thebes tomorrow.\n\nWith love from your favorite FSP redheads,\n\nCatherine B. and Laura\n\nSites visited: Mycenae, Mycenaean road, Kleisoura\n\nGroup leaders: Cara, Brett\n\nBlog: Nina, Margo\n\nToday was the day of the goats and nightmare insects… and by that we mean that our day concluded with a casual five mile (more for some with lesser developed senses of direction) stroll on a Mycenaean road that erred on the far side of surreal.\n\nWe got an early start in order to beat the crowds of Greek school children and expressively dressed tourists at Mycenae. On the way there we made a pit stop to look at the remains of a Mycenaean bridge and learn about their extensive road system and civil engineering projects. The bridge itself was made of conglomerate cyclopean blocks and was an impressive feat of engineering by any standard.\n\nWe then piled back on the bus to get to the site of Mycenae. Our first stop was at Grave Circle B, a 17th/16th century BCE royal burial site outside the walls of the citadel. We saw shaft graves marked with stelai and one transitional grave (“Tomb Rho”) that exhibited certain features that were later adapted by the tholos style tomb.\n\nWe then began our tholos tour of Mycenae, visiting four of the total nine found around the citadel. We first went to the rather unimpressive Tomb of Aegisthus which featured rubble masonry and a less than ideal relieving triangle (probably because this tholos marks the transition between tholos type I and II). Next, we saw the Tholos of Clytemnestra which did not disappoint. This classic Type III tholos featured a long dromos (path leading to the central chamber) with an ashlar retaining wall, exclusively employed cut-stone masonry, conglomerate stomion blocks, and a successfully corbeled ceiling with an effective relieving triangle. Things began to get weird while becoming familiar with the smooth conglomerate blocks of the stomion…the sanity of the group only deteriorated from that point on. After losing our [Elgin] marbles, we continued our tour and went to the Lion Tholos (RAWR!). This regression to a Type II experience was only slightly disappointing, mostly because there are no lions in the Lion Tholos. For the grand finale we took a short walk (foreshadowing our later excursion and marking the beginning of our encounters with mega insects) to the Treasury of Atreus. This stunner featured sawed conglomerate ashlar masonry (also very soft), a 120 ton lintel block and a gigantic and magnificent relieving triangle. After putting our flashlights to use and getting freaky in the pitch black side chamber, the group clamored up to pose on top of the relieving triangle where a mound of dirt covered the tholos.\n\nWe then made our way back up to the citadel of Mycenae and finally beheld the famous Lion Gate. The fortification walls were imposing and featured impressively large blocks, especially around the gate. Directly inside the gate was Grave Circle A–the wall circuit was, in fact, expanded to include Grave Circle A at the front entrance. We then walked to the extant megaron which was located just below the peak of the hill and had killer views of the Argolid, which may have been framed by windows flanking the king’s throne in the megaron. Although there is uncertainty, there was possibly a “bathroom” near the megaron–this would have been the site of the mythical stabbing of cheater Agamemnon by his cheating wife, Clytemnestra (see reenactment in the video). Next we walked down into an underground water system that was hidden in the fortification walls (so that enemies wouldn’t be able to find it and contaminate it). Our journey to the dank pit was proceeded by a heartwarming tale of a boy leading tourists to the bottom and then blowing out his candle and abandoning them. Obviously, we took the opportunity to further dispose of our sanity at the bottom of the pit. Next we went to the archaeological museum associated with the site and saw many of the finds (and more reproductions) from the citadel and graves of Mycenae, including some important frescoes and terracotta cult figures. We were then quizzed on the things we saw inside.\n\nProfessor Rutter then led us to a Mycenaean road so that we could make our way by foot, as the Mycenaeans would have, to the modern town of Prosymni (Berbati, during the Bronze Age). The journey was long and trying. There was some karaoke-ing, there was some feasting, there was some wandering through thorn bushes to look at the remains of the old road, and there was some archaeological surveying. Those who had no interest in surveying (shocking!) made their way to town on a desperate quest for frappes. Everyone else peeled away slowly with the goal of town. Nina, Margo and Cara took a wrong turn and made some friends with old, drunk men having a party in front of a church at the top of a mountain–they kindly pointed them in the right direction. Eventually, everyone made it to town and rehydrated before piling back on the bus with the promise of a shower, rest and food.\n\nBUT, before the day was through, Professor Rutter took the opportunity to squeeze in one more site, Kleisoura. This site is centered around a cave and has yielded Paleolithic artifacts (that is EXTREMELY old–as in 40,0000 years old). The group then spent the next hour rummaging through the dirt in search of flint tools. When this got old, some people entertained themselves with the bodily remains of a Lykosouros Rex (a goat skull). We told you today was weird.\n\nWith love and bad dreams,\n\nM.M. & N.M.\n\nSites visited: Free day!\n\nGroup leaders: Zack, Emmanuel\n\nBlog: Cara, Brett\n\nToday we enjoyed a holiday in what has become many group members’ favorite city in Greece: Nafplio. Located in the Argive plain, it is but a short coach ride away from Argos and the Mycenaean palatial sites of Tiryns, Midea, and Mycenae. Nafplio has switched hands multiple times over the millennia, falling under the reign of the Byzantines, the Ottomans, the Franks, the Italians, and, finally, the Greeks. 182 years of Venetian control have given this seaside town a distinct Italian feel. The streets are narrow, the roads are cobbled, signs announcing pizza and pesto catch the eye, and it seems that not a single street lacks its own gelateria(s).\n\nAlthough Nafplio has become a popular tourist destination in recent times, it still retains its charm. It was certainly one of the highlights of our trip to the Peloponnese this past April. Memories of a delicious, pastry-filled breakfast and cliff jumping into the Aegean waters have done much to offset the sour memories of climbing to the acropolis of Argos in a hailstorm. With these fond memories in mind, we were determined to make the most of the last off day of the ΦΣΠ. In this respect, the day was a veritable success.\n\nMost everyone chose to sleep in, with varying degrees of success. 70 days of rising at seven or eight in the morning have conditioned us to wake up early regardless of whether an alarm goes off, but Brett successfully slept in until noon. This can either be construed as a triumph or an embarrassment, but he chooses to go with the former. Other, more productive members of the trip took advantage of the free morning to enjoy a leisurely breakfast, chat with loved ones over Skype, sort through accumulated masses of emails, and buy groceries for tomorrow’s picnic lunch at Mycenae. Laurel, Cam, Laura, and Cara each went running on their own for several hours. The varsity skiers, as always, took to the hills, while Laura and Cara followed a scenic seaside road that stretched on for miles on end. Cara played with a starfish in an empty beach before realizing that she was probably killing it, at which point she quickly set it back in the water.\n\nThe evening was no less exciting. Some members chose to spend their time studying for tomorrow’s quiz while sipping on frappes, some napped, some did laundry, some went gift shopping, some updated their journals, and others wandered aimlessly about the town. Mindless, glorious TV watching was also a popular pastime: Emmanuel passed the time by going through his favorite battle scenes from war movies, Hunter caught up on episodes of Archer, Laurel watched Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy (a must see), and Zhenwei, Catherine D., Brett, and Cara watched Good Luck Chuck (a movie you should never see). Brett also watched Psycho into the wee hours of the morning and loved it.\n\nTeddy, Hunter, Catherine D., Brett, and Cara spent a few hours on the beach, soaking up the Mediterranean sun, reflecting upon the trip, and wondering about the origins of Greek men’s fascination with speedos. Teddy, for once, was responsible and applied sunscreen. He’ll probably be red all over tomorrow anyway.\n\nThe group also made a point of exploring the culinary delights that Nafplio has to offer. Zhenwei had some excellent gnocchi (high praise from someone who lived in Rome for three months!), Emmanuel tucked into fresh anchovies, some of the boys went on the prowl for their beloved gyros, and the girls enjoyed a meal of pesto pasta recommended to them by Professor Rutter. Frozen yogurt and gelato were had by all, yet Catherine D. blew us all out of the water by eating nothing but frozen products until dinnertime. This girl has her priorities straight!\n\nAll in all, it was a much-needed day of rest. Now that we’ve recharged our batteries, we look forward to tomorrow when we’ll finally visit one of the greatest sites in Aegean history: Mycenae!\n\nSites visited: Corinth Canal, Midea, Dendra, Tiryns,\n\nGroup leaders: Catherine D., Hunter\n\nBlog: Zack, Emmanuel\n\nToday we moved out of our hotel in Athens to see Mycenaean sites in the Argolid. We started out with a relatively lengthy bus ride. Doctor J, awesome as he is, was worried about us being stuck on the bus for too long, so he let us take a break after about an hour. It was really cool to stop at the Corinth Canal, which connects the Gulf of Corinth with the Saronic Gulf. This was awesome and really made us appreciate how much effort it taken to accomplish such a feat. The downside to this stop was that it was a tourist trap and there were more than fifteen other buses full of obnoxious tourists. As a result, most of us spent our time at the canal and avoided the zoo in the food court. After our brief stop, we got back onto the bus and had another lengthy trip to our first site.\n\nThe first site of the day was the great Mycenaean center of Midea in the Argolid. It was very windy so the members of the group with long hair struggled. Nevertheless, the site was still very impressive. It was our first contact with Cyclopean masonry on a large scale. It was a cool thing to see in person and we really got a sense of scale. We did not let the wind dampen our spirits as we worked our way through the site with J.R., who gave us another one of his masterful lectures.\n\nThe next site that we went to was Dendra, which is located right outside Midea. It served as a cemetery for the settlement. It is a significant prehistoric archaeological site and was excavated by Swedish archeologist Axel W. Persson in the first half of the twentieth century. We briefly went around the site looking at the different tholos tombs, chamber tombs, and tumuli located there. There was a strange, disgusting smell that seemed to permeate almost every corner of the site. This was especially annoying because Dendra is where we had our lunch break. For some of us, the lunch break was already unpleasant due to the fact that our lunch mostly consisted of breakfast scraps, and the smell just made it that much worse.\n\nAfter we had finished lunch, we headed to Tiryns where we were greeted by the lovely German graduate student Susanne Prillwitz. The palace at Tiryns was absolutely incredible. Many of the fortification walls were very well-preserved. This gave us an idea of just how overpowering the building would have been in antiquity. The walls were eight meters thick and made of massive stone. The people at Tiryns did not have to worry about being attacked, and even if they were this would have been excessive. Rutter informed us that this was done as a display of wealth and power. After seeing the fortification walls and elaborate system of gates, it is almost impossible to believe that, at least for some time, Tiryns was under the control of the palace at Mycenae. It just made all of us that much more excited for our upcoming trip there.\n\nAfter we were kicked out of Tiryns by the guards at closing time, we headed over to the tombs of Tiryns. We went into one of the tholos tombs. Professor J. began telling us about the large slab that would have covered the doorway into the tholos, but Zack displayed his acute observational abilities and unparalleled deductive skills by pointing out two pivot holes in the third lintel block, thus proving that there was in fact a door located there. After we left the tholos tomb, the Doctor wanted to show us what an unexcavated tholos looked like, but this required going over a small barbed wire fence. Cam, Zack, and Teddy demonstrated their mad ups by gracefully leaping over the fence.\n\nOur last stop for the day was at the Tiryns Dam. This was really cool and would have taken an incredible amount of manpower and organization, which is even more impressive considering this happened 3,000 years ago. When we finished our very brief trip to the Tiryns Dam, we finally headed to Nafplio and settled into Hotel Victoria.\n\nThe gruesome twosome,\n\nZ and E\n\nSites visited: Free day!\n\nGroup leaders: Nina, Zhenwei\n\nBlog: Catherine D., Hunter\n\nToday was one part travel day and one part off day. Some of us, including Professor Rutter and Katie, mixed up which part was “off” and accidentally slept through the wakeup call on the boat. Luckily, thanks to our leaders Zhenwei and Nina scrambling to rooms to wake people, everyone was eventually woken up and the group gathered together outside the boat. We took the by now familiar route by train and metro to our home away from home in Athens, the Ilisia hotel. On the train a few ambitious groups put the finishing details on their paper assignments from the night before. Most groups were not finished because the sea was much rougher than expected, and some of us had been gruesomely stricken down by seasickness the night before.\n\nUnfortunately, the group arrived at our hotel far too early to check in and needed to wait around in the lobby for other guests to check out. Still recovering from the receding nausea of the night before, groups spent much of the morning at the Ilisia Hotel typing away and trying to make up for time lost on the boat. By noon, everyone received a room and most finished their work. Everyone took this opportunity to go out in Athens and explore more fun archeological sites…just kidding. Everyone took long naps, did laundry and never moved more than 100 yards away from the hotel. Eventually some members worked up enough energy to venture outside.\n\nCatherine B. and Laura went to lunch in Monastiraki and practiced some geographical orientation exercises in honor of PCC. Hunter managed to gather enough energy to meet up with a friend from Dartmouth and his parents for dinner (Thanks for the meal Mr. and Ms. Von Moltke).\n\nCatherine D., Nina, and Margo departed for Avocado (a spectacular vegetarian restaurant with gluten free menu options) and met up with Laurel who was waiting for her lunch to be delivered. The restaurant was too full to accommodate them, so they set a reservation for a half an hour later and split up to accomplish various tasks. Margo and Nina went to buy concert tickets at Public. Catherine D. lurked at the neighboring Bio-market for 30 minutes, gleefully reading through organic food labels and ogling the gluten free food goods. Laurel finished her amazing lunch and joined them for dessert at Avocado while everyone else ate a late lunch/dinner. The group was joined while ordering by Zhenwei and Eman in quick succession, and enjoyed a marvelous meal and dessert.\n\nPost-Avocado the group once again split up. After another quick jaunt through the bio-market, Eman headed back to Hotel Ilisia to finish laundry and relax. Margo and Nina made a beeline for Oyshio and Catherine D., Zhenwei, and Laurel took a leisurely stroll through the rest of the shopping district in the Syntagma area. Nothing was bought, but many outfits were tried on, and a few lacy white summer dresses were seriously contemplated.\n\nZhenwei continued shopping while Catherine D. and Laurel also returned to the hotel to retrieve laundry, Skype, and laze about. Lamentably, this concludes the adventures of both heroic bloggers for the day, and there is little else of note to remark upon.\n\nHowever, Nina and Margo did attend a German concert of mysterious nature, which Hunter assumes to be German Techno “because all music from Germany is techno these days” (Hunter 5/26/13).\n\nIn summation, the day was uneventful but served as a much needed respite after our exciting trip through Crete.\n\nYour devoted bloggers,\n\nDarragh and Blackie"
