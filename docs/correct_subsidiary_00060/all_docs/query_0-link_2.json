        "text": "Former website providing map services\n\nPlatial was a collaborative, user generated, cartographic website. It was founded in 2004 by Di-Ann Eisnor, Jake Olsen, and Jason Wilson. Platial, Inc. was headquartered in Portland, Oregon.\n\nPlatial was used by hundreds of thousands of people[1] globally to share and associate relevant content with geographic places of interest. Platial claims 25% of the web's map widgets,[2] used on over 10,000 sites.[3]\n\nOn October 18, 2007, Platial acquired Frappr!, another social mapping website, increasing its total user-generated locations to more than 100 million.[2]\n\nOn February 27, 2010 Platial announced[4] that the service would be closing down within a few days.\n\nIn the Geographic Information Science literature, the concept of 'platial' refers to place-based studies in parallel with the use of 'spatial' for space-based (coordinate-system oriented) studies.[5]\n\nGao, S.; Janowicz, K.; McKenzie, G.; & Li, L.
