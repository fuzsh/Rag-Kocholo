        "text": "We haven't met, but if there's one thing I know about you, it's that you probably love Starbucks. You don't hide the fact it's part of your morning commute, or that you had no guilt at all ordering a Unicorn Frappuccino this week. And if so far this all sounds unnervingly accurate, you'll be thrilled to find out that the coffee chain is opening a four-story, 43,000-square-foot playground just for you in Chicago.\n\nThe Windy City location, set to open in 2019, is the third of the coffee giant's luxurious Reserve Roasteries (there's one in Seattle and one set to open next year in NYC). According to a company press release, the gilded, caffeinated amusement park will be located in the Magnificent Mile district, in commemoration of Chicago's first Starbucks Store, which opened nearly 30 years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what can you expect from this interactive coffee amusement park? If it's anything like the palatial Seattle location, customers will be able to see the company's small-batch Reserve beans being roasted in action, while sipping on specially crafted beverages. The location will also house an on-site bakery, where renowned bread baker Rocco Princi will churn out artisanal food pairings to go with your craft coffee."
