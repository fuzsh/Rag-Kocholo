        "text": "Sites visited: Thermopylae, Kalapodhi, Archaeological Museum of Atalanti, Metrou, Lefkandi\n\nGroup leaders: Zack, Laurel\n\nBlog: Teddy, Zhenwei\n\nToday, when dawn with her rosy fingers shone once more, we woke up in our janky hotel in Volos ready for an 8 AM departure to Athens for our last few days in Greece (Insert sad face). We knew we had a long bus ride ahead of us, so everyone was hoping for a delicious nutritious breakfast spread. Alas, we were again disappointed. We found only cardboard chocolate bread and warm tang. Not every hotel can be the Victoria in Nafplion. Whatever. It got the job done, and we were all on to coach right on schedule.\n\nAfter an hour and a half or so of uneventful driving we took a quick rest stop at a janky roadside joint where Cam became livid about the absurd prices of the inferior quality cookies. After he got a hold of himself (But not before almost causing a serious scene) we got back on the bus and Professor Rutter informed us we’d be arriving shortly at Thermopylae, site of the epic last stand of the Spartan 300 in 480 B.C. Everyone was understandably excited to see what is arguably one of the most important sites in the history of the Western World. Eman and Hunter were especially excited given their love for all things ancient and warfare-ey.\n\nThe site caught us off-guard. When Professor Rutter told us we’d be making a quick stop many of us thought we were at yet another unpublished out-of-the-way Mycenaean palace site that only our man JR would know about. Instead, a rocky path lead up a small hillock at the top of which was not a Mycenaean palace but a small monument (cleverly paved with Lapis Lacadaemonius: a type of stone native to Spartan territory) erected to honor the memory of the Greeks who fell at the Battle of Thermopylae. At the center was a reproduction of the famous commemorative inscription that stood at the site in antiquity, attested by Pausanias. It reads (roughly): “Stranger, tell the Spartans we lie here, loyal to our words.” Or (more poetically): “Go tell the Spartans passerby, that here, loyal to our word we lie.” It was a very cool site, even though there was virtually nothing left in terms of archaeological remains and the topography has changed considerably since antiquity. What was once a narrow coastal mountain pass has been transformed by alluvial fill into a broad coastal plain. 300 Spartans would be hard pressed to hold the site nowadays. After some general tomfoolery around the statue of Leonidas at the bottom of the hillock and several train wreck group pictures (What else is new?) we were ready to get back on the road.\n\nOur next site was Kalapodhi, where we were privileged enough to receive an insightful lecture from Dr. Rainer Felsch. Dr. Felsch has been excavating at the site since 1970, so obviously he knows a thing or two about the site. He believes in antiquity it was the oracle of Apollo at Abai , and he showed us a number of interesting pieces of evidence to support this theory. Although there is not much left at the site in terms of physical remains, it has produced some incredible finds over the years including an iron sword, Mycenaean seals, wall painting fragments from an archaic temple, and layers of habitation stretching from pre-palatial Mycenaean to late Roman times. Dr. Felsch informed us about them all. After a brief Q&A session and a big thank you for Dr. Felsch, it was back on the coach to continue our odyssey.\n\nOur next stop was right nearby – the Archaeological Museum of Atalanti. The collection was pretty standard for small local museums – some Neolithic, some prehistoric, some Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman. Of particular interest was a Roman bronze lock that Dr. Felsch had mentioned at Kalapodhi. The real adventure of this stop, however, was Catherine D. getting locked in the bathroom. After a half hour of banging with a hammer and other assorted tools she was finally freed and was able to meet us in town for a quick gyro from a flustered purveyor of fine spinning meats.\n\nAfter the museum it was off to Metrou, where Professor Rutter excavated from 2004-2008. We didn’t make it over to the site proper, which is on an island linked to land by a causeway exposed only at low tide, but certainly found the time to stop by one of Prof. Rutter’s old local haunts for a frappe. It’s where he watched the world cup with the locals! Wild times……\n\nOur last stop before Athens was Lefkandi, to see the largest building (by far) to survive from the Greek Dark Age: the Lefkandi Heroon. Built around 975 B.C., it’s about half as long as a football field. Its would not be equaled until the late archaic period (~600 B.C.). It was purposefully demolished shortly after its construction and a tumulus raised over it. Nobody knows exactly why! Although the remains are not substantial, there’s certainly enough left to appreciate how imposing the structure must have been in its heyday. After a brief lecture and a few minutes to walk about and ponder the structures’ mysterious history we were back on the bus for the last leg of our journey back to our home away from home: The Illisia hotel, Athens."
