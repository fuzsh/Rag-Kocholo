        "text": "“The Vicomtesse Marie-Laure de Noailles is the very first person to see.” These were my editor’s instructions a half century ago when I was assigned to write an article on French art collectors for Elle. The Vicomtesse de Noailles had long been at the center of Parisian avant-garde style. She was the patron and muse of artists, filmmakers, and musicians such as Man Ray, Luis Buñuel, Alberto Giacometti, Salvador Dali, and Francis Poulenc, and the creator of modernist interiors that would be widely copied in Europe and America. So I was somewhat daunted when I entered the Noailleses’ residence at 11 Place des États-Unis, where Marie-Laure had lived for decades, and walked up the staircase, which was hung with Courbets, Watteaus, and Burne-Joneses, interspersed with works by Paul Klee, Juan Gris, and Balthus.\n\nI followed a liveried valet past a Van Dyck and two Goyas into the main drawing room, which was sparingly furnished in Art Deco style. The Vicomtesse was standing in a corner, smoking, in the company of a beautiful young man. Marie-Laure and her guest stared at me as I approached, their looks distinctly tainted with malice. I extended my hand; Marie-Laure did not reciprocate but instead said, in a hoarse voice, “Let’s continue to stand.”\n\nShe went on staring at me with haughty insolence. Marie-Laure was tall, and much stouter than the fashionable woman I’d seen in pictures from the nineteen-thirties and in portraits by Dali, Man Ray, Balthus, and Picasso. The features of her pale, aquiline face, which was framed by a mop of wild black hair, had begun to droop. As I proceeded to interview her, any trace of tolerance she might have had for me was diminished by my lack of an adequate retort to the one query she put to me: “Men who love Proust have short penises, don’t you think?” Then she looked at her watch and said, in crisp British-accented English, “I must go. I have a date with my gyno in twenty minutes.”\n\nMy memory of the episode is so steeped in panic that I can’t remember if I ever wrote the article. When I recounted the incident, decades later, to the Vicomtesse’s close friend the writer James Lord, he said, “It would have been irresistible for Marie-Laure to rake any young woman over the coals that way.” Another friend, the composer and author Ned Rorem, whom Marie-Laure supported in the nineteen-fifties, told me, “For five years, I had two meals a day at her table. Five years she lodged me, fed me, gave me spending money. And during those years I was able to compose dozens of hours of playable music.” In his journal (“The Paris Diary and The New York Diary, 1951-1961”), Rorem wrote, “Marie-Laure is first of all a child, second an artist, third a Vicomtesse. . . . Fourth, she’s a saint, fifth, a masochist . . . and sixth, a bitch. . . . Above all, she is generous, not to mention crazy.”\n\nMarie-Laure and her husband, Charles de Noailles, were pioneers of the modernist sensibility, having assembled a collection of painting and sculpture which included almost every member of the European avant-garde. They were also the first generation of patrons for whom film was a creative outlet, and they subsidized the most daring films of the twenties and thirties, notably Buñuel and Dali’s “The Golden Age.” Matthew Gale, a curator at the Tate Modern, in London, who organized an exhibition called “Dali and Film” (it will travel to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art next month and to the Museum of Modern Art next year), calls the Noailleses key figures in “keeping the engine of innovation going among the Surrealists.” “One tends to see artists heroically struggling,” he says. “But, in fact, brave patrons like Marie-Laure and Charles de Noailles were crucial in allowing new ideas and new work to be made.”\n\nWhat motivated Marie-Laure, this sacred monster whose irreverent, far-ranging vision helped to launch the Surrealist movement and left its mark on many aspects of twentieth-century culture? Marie-Laure Bischoffsheim—her maiden name—was the descendant, on her father’s side, of a wealthy German banking family and, on her mother’s side, of a French aristocratic clan who traced their ancestry to the Marquis de Sade. Marie-Laure’s maternal grandmother, the acid-witted Comtesse de Chevigné, born Laure de Sade, was the Marquis’s great-granddaughter. She shocked her peers by associating with artists and bohemians. (She was also reputed to be the first French society woman to have uttered the word merde in public.)\n\nLaure de Sade married an aristocrat with little money, and when their daughter Marie-Thérèse came of age they married her off to a sickly but affluent young man named Maurice Bischoffsheim, who died of tuberculosis eighteen months after his daughter, Marie-Laure, was born, in 1902. According to Laurence Benaïm, in “Marie-Laure de Noailles: The Vicomtesse of the Bizarre,” a biography published in France in 2001, Marie-Laure became one of Europe’s wealthiest heiresses at the age of seven, upon the death of her rich German grandfather. She was brought up by her reclusive mother and a British governess. Her mother was worried that the girl had inherited her father’s frail health, so she educated her at home. Intellectually precocious, Marie-Laure was reading Mallarmé and Poe before the age of ten and reciting Baudelaire for visitors.\n\nHaving moved with her mother and stepfather to Paris, Marie-Laure grew into a bookish teen-ager with a pale, beaky face and a head of unruly black hair. She attended the Institut Catholique, where, according to her letters, she was preoccupied with trying to understand Leibniz. When she turned twenty, a ball was given, announcing her readiness for marriage. Three months later, in February, 1923, she married the Vicomte de Noailles.\n\nCharles de Noailles was handsome, courteous, and well educated, with avant-garde tastes unusual in an aristocrat. While still a bachelor, he had bought a 1907 Picasso. The young Noailleses’ honeymoon included a cruise stop in Cuba, where Marie-Laure refused to leave her cabin because, according to James Lord, she was so engrossed in Freud’s “Introduction to Psychoanalysis.” The couple went on to New York and Key West, where they lived on a houseboat and Marie-Laure noticed that Charles, obsessed with his body, liked nothing better than to lie in the sun for hours to cultivate a deep tan. Back in Paris, “the Charles,” as friends called the couple, gave many parties and costume balls. In those years, Marie-Laure remained a reserved young wife, who seemed to lean on her husband, as Benaïm put it, “like a wounded bird.” She was deeply in love with Charles, a seductive yet distant mentor. Although they were intensely devoted to each other, the couple’s sexual intimacy more or less ended after the birth of their second child; throughout their marriage they kept separate bedrooms and always addressed each other in the formal vous.\n\nThe Noailleses shared a passion, however: Charles had passed on to his wife his interest in the nineteen-twenties avant-garde. Their friend Pierre Bergé, the business partner of Yves Saint Laurent, told a French television interviewer that Charles and Marie-Laure “found their own equilibrium by exerting a destabilizing influence on other people.” Early in their marriage, they began to collect works by Max Ernst, Man Ray, Francis Picabia, Giorgio de Chirico, and Yves Tanguy; according to Benaïm, they bought one of the two Mondrians ever sold in France. These artists, along with composers such as Poulenc and Georges Auric and many Surrealist writers, particularly Jean Cocteau, on whom Marie-Laure had had a crush since adolescence, became their favorite guests. (Marie-Laure generally disliked women, and was notoriously rude to them.) The Noailleses were noted for their informality, and guests could announce themselves to Marie-Laure an hour before lunch. Poulenc, whose concerto “Aubade” was commissioned by the Noailleses in 1928, was addressed by Marie-Laure as Poupoule.\n\nSoon after returning from their honeymoon, the Noailleses moved into the palatial house at 11 Place des États-Unis, which had been built by Marie-Laure’s grandfather Bischoffsheim, and which he had left her in his will, along with his collection of Old Masters. To update their drawing room, they hired JeanMichel Frank, a twenty-eight-year-old decorator who became France’s most influential designer, owing largely to the innovative décor that he created for the Noailleses. He covered the living-room walls with large panels of square parchment, which made a neutral background for their art collection, in which a Dali hung between two Goyas. He upholstered blocky chairs and sofas in white linen, black leather, or white fake fur. Frank’s motto for his spare rectilinear style was “The last touch of elegance is elimination.” “It was all very white, naked, strange,” Abbé Mugnier, a priest popular in Paris salons, noted. Marie-Laure’s personal aesthetics were in accord with her stark décor: she wore mainly Chanel, principally the couturiere’s tidy little suits, of which she had about forty versions, most of them in black.\n\nAfter the Noailleses finished decorating their Paris house, they began to look for an architect for a villa they wanted to build in the South of France, in Hyères. Marie-Laure was pregnant with their first child, Laure, when they travelled to Germany to seek out Mies van der Rohe, who was too busy to take them on. They then visited Le Corbusier, whose didactic personality put them off. So they settled on a young French modernist, Robert Mallet-Stevens, the first French architect to have seriously studied the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. His creation, a forty-bedroom house made of reinforced concrete, looked like a Cubist cruise ship.\n\n“Innumerable rooms, rectilinear, unicolored” was the way the painter Jean Hugo described the house in his memoirs. “Like the blocks of a child’s game tumbling one into the other, forming a strangely obscure labyrinth in which guests constantly lost their way.” Each of the monastic guest rooms had its own flowered terrace. There was a Cubist garden with block-shaped shrubbery and sculptures commissioned from Brancusi and Giacometti, who later made several portrait busts of Marie-Laure.\n\nThe Noailleses may have been the first family in Europe to have a covered swimming pool, an athletic center, and a personal trainer; their gymnasium was outfitted with parallel bars, punching bags, and volleyball nets, and was overseen by a blond gym teacher named M. Taré. All guests found striped swimsuits and exercise pants in their rooms. The house became the place where intellectuals cultivated their bodies. Even André Gide, an austere man in his sixties, found himself playing volleyball, “more or less naked,” he wrote in his diary. “I hope you’ll do a gymnastics workout with me every morning,” Charles wrote to Buñuel before a visit, according to Benaïm. “I’m not hopeful about the athleticism of the others in the group” (Auric, Cocteau, Christian Bérard).\n\nDecades later, Marie-Laure liked to ask new friends this question: “At what age did you become yourself?” She easily fixed the year in her own life: 1929, when she was twenty-seven. Several things happened that year which made everything change for her.\n\nHaving installed Paris’s first private screening room in their house, the Noailleses became interested in avant-garde cinema. (They had commissioned a short film from Jacques Manuel about the high jinks at Hyères, called “Biceps and Jewels.”) They were extremely taken with “Un Chien Andalou,” and Charles began to finance a film each year as a birthday present for Marie-Laure, including “Blood of a Poet” and “The Golden Age,” the collaboration between Buñuel and Dali.\n\n“Marie-Laure took exceptional pleasure in shocking people,” her friend Bernard Minoret told me, “and through these two men’s work she created a sensational brouhaha.” The Noailleses gave Buñuel two hundred and sixty thousand francs to shoot “The Golden Age,” and he moved into their house at Hyères to write the script. Each evening, Buñuel would read what he had written to his patrons, and, according to his autobiography, “My Last Sigh,” they found the work “exquisite and delightful.” In July of 1930, the Noailleses hosted an early screening at their home. In the film, after some Surrealist shenanigans—cows settling into beds, the heroine sucking on the big toe of a statue of the Pope, bishops being thrown out of windows—the action moves to the castle where the infamous Duc de Blangis, the protagonist of Sade’s “120 Days of Sodom,” has been holding his orgies. When the Duke emerges from the castle, the audience sees that he is Jesus Christ. Buñuel wrote that his intention had been to make viewers “redden with shame” by mocking all that was sacred—the family, the bourgeoisie, organized religion, and national pride.\n\nAfter the movie’s première, which was attended by Gertrude Stein, Brancusi, and Georges Braques, the Noailleses stood to greet the audience. But the guests left icily, without a word. At another of the movie’s first showings, members of the Anti-Jewish League marched into the theatre shouting “Death to Jews!” and throwing stink bombs at spectators and ink onto the screen. Critics accused the Noailleses of creating “a Bolshevik spectacle.” “L’Age d’Or” was soon referred to in Paris as “L’Age d’Ordure,” or “The Age of Garbage.” The film was confiscated by the police. The bishop of Paris was alerted, and, according to Buñuel, Charles’s mother had to go to Rome for a chat with Pope Pius XI, who was threatening Charles with excommunication. He also had to resign from the Jockey Club, Paris’s most élite institution. “The Golden Age,” which Matthew Gale, the Tate curator, calls “a bitter masterpiece,” was out of circulation for fifty years.\n\nCharles and Marie-Laure each reacted very differently to the hullabaloo: Charles soon left Paris for Hyères, writing to Buñuel, “We are obliged to avoid all scandal now, we must be forgotten.” Ceasing to flaunt his love of modernism, he replaced a Picasso on his living-room wall with a Rubens and sought refuge in gardening. Marie-Laure, on the other hand, discovered that she relished scandal. She could now be spared tedious high-society evenings and engage more fully in supporting the work of her Surrealist friends. She particularly enjoyed making them read the original manuscript of Sade’s “120 Days of Sodom.” Marie-Laure’s mania for Sade’s novel, which she kept in a phallus-shaped case, led to new interest in Sade on the part of the Surrealists and to the beginning of his general renaissance.\n\nThe other episode that changed Marie-Laure’s life occurred shortly after the “Golden Age” fiasco. She walked into Charles’s room one day and found him in bed with M. Taré. “It’s not amusing for a young wife to walk into her husband’s room and find him in bed with his gym teacher,” she said, decades later, to James Lord. However, the revelation gave her a new sense of power. “Until the age of thirty I was timid and soft-spoken,” she told Minoret. “Then one day I began to talk and I’ve never stopped since.”\n\nThe change was noticeable. Suddenly, Marie-Laure began to hold forth volubly, even over lunch, on sex toys and other prurient subjects. (“Marie-Laure, je vous en prie,” Charles would say.) However, her nephew Philippe de Montebello, now the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, says that she minded her manners during family meals. “There were two Marie-Laures,” he told me. “In front of us she never uttered one off-color word or joke.” In general, though, she modelled herself increasingly on her spirited grandmother, and she began to take lovers.\n\nThe first object of her affection was a bisexual British millionaire named Edward James, who published Minotaur, a magazine about art and psychoanalysis beloved by the Surrealists. Invited to stay with the family at Hyères, James was more or less assaulted by Marie-Laure, who slid into his bed one night “like a moonbeam,” he wrote in his book, “Swans Reflecting Elephants: My Early Years.” Initially put off, he eventually acceded. A few weeks later, he wanted to leave, worried that his hostess was becoming indiscreet, but Charles, apparently exhausted by his wife’s new eccentricities, begged him to stay, telling him, “The fortnight you spent with us is the most peaceful one I’ve had in years.” James stayed on. Later, he wrote, “Marie-Laure lived for drama. . . . A good hysterical scene, with a choice audience, if possible, gave her a truly great pleasure.”\n\nAfter James came one of the two great passions of Marie-Laure’s life: Igor Markevitch, a composer and conductor. He was twenty-one and had just had an affair with Serge Diaghilev when he met the thirty-two-year-old Marie-Laure, at Hyères. In the summer of 1933, Markevitch became ill: his doctors prescribed rest in Switzerland, and Marie-Laure followed him, settling with him in a one-bedroom chalet in the mountains. In his memoir, “Être et Avoir Été,” he wrote that, after a few weeks, seeing how happy she was, “this woman in appearance so blessed with all of life’s possible gifts had all along been inwardly impoverished.” With Markevitch, Marie-Laure embraced a new domesticity. She tied on an apron and took over all the household tasks. Her lover was impressed by her extraordinary discipline: even with all the housework, he noted, she read a book or two a day while keeping a detailed journal and maintaining a wide-ranging correspondence. (Throughout their lives, Marie-Laure and her husband wrote to each other every day.) She even proved to be a meticulous nurse.\n\nCharles de Noailles dropped in on the couple twice in the course of the summer. Markevitch described him as “very much at ease . . . a model husband.” But then Marie-Laure became pregnant. A meeting was convened with Charles, the lovers, and a Parisian lawyer. The three men decided that Marie-Laure would have an abortion. Markevitch felt that Marie-Laure, who wanted to have the child, never got over it. The relationship foundered, and she accused him of cheating on her with Cocteau. But shortly after their breakup Marie-Laure demonstrated her extraordinary generosity: she commissioned Markevitch to compose a piece on the theme of “Paradise Lost,” a favorite work of hers. Not long after this, the couple, having resumed their romance, drove to Salzburg in Marie-Laure’s Alfa Romeo. They took a bad turn and skidded off the road, close to a precipice. Markevitch was able to get out of the car, but Marie-Laure was stuck for hours. When a rescue team finally reached her, she was waiting calmly in her seat, a copy of Hölderlin’s poems open on her knees.\n\nMarie-Laure’s romance with Markevitch, who was suspected by friends of having occasionally added zeros to the checks she gave him, impelled her family to put her on a strict allowance. When she needed cash for her next major lover—the cellist Maurice Gendron, for whom she bought a Stradivarius—she sold a Dali.\n\nIn the mid-nineteen-thirties, Marie-Laure developed a new style, that of the left-wing militant. This shift was occasioned by her affair with Michel Petitjean, an editor of the progressive newspaper La Flèche, who was only eight years younger than she. Now referred to as the Red Viscountess, she became a supporter of the Front Populaire. (“She went everywhere where one could raise a fist in ’36,” Drieu la Rochelle wrote.) During the Second World War, both the Vicomte and the Vicomtesse joined ambulance units, but that was the extent of their patriotic involvement. Having just one Jewish grandparent on her father’s side, Marie-Laure was not Jewish by German or Vichy standards, and so was relatively safeguarded from persecution (although she was once held for twenty-four days in a concentration camp when she crossed into Lausanne without her papers being in order). German occupying forces tried to evict her from her house on the Place des États-Unis, but she was spared: she obtained a document from the American Embassy stating that President Wilson had stayed there in 1919 and that the house was under American protection. Another time, sheer chutzpah saved her: Two German officers came into her bedroom. “Gentlemen, haven’t you been taught to take your hats off in a lady’s room?” she snapped. “Emma, bring me my tea.” The officers turned and left.\n\nCharles de Noailles spent the Occupation years in the South of France concentrating on his garden. (“Who does Charles like best, men or women?” a friend once asked Marie-Laure. “He likes flowers,” she answered.) Marie-Laure continued her prewar schedule, dining at the Café Flore with Jean-Louis Barrault and Dora Maar and Cocteau, attending openings and premières. During this period, she had a brief liaison with a German officer (“But he was Austrian!” she would later plead to friends). The romance became public when the lovers had a car accident, with Marie-Laure’s friend Georges Auric at their side. This time, her nose was broken, and she had to breathe through her mouth for the rest of her life.\n\n“Time devours chic faster than it devours faces,” Marie-Laure once wrote. Her own looks contradicted that theory. Philippe de Montebello, who first knew her in the postwar decades, remembers her as “incredibly ugly, but in a captivating way.” By the nineteen-fifties, she had to give up her Chanel suits: to conceal her large belly, she wore wide peasant skirts with ballet slippers, and carried baskets instead of handbags. “I’m the worst-dressed woman in Europe since 1940,” she told Bernard Minoret. “In order to be beautiful I’d have to have eighteen operations.”\n\nIt was in this new incarnation that Marie-Laure met the last great love of her life, a Spanish painter named Oscar Dominguez, one of the few heterosexuals she ever took up with. Dominguez, four years older than she, was born in the Canary Islands and, after moving to Paris, hung out on the fringes of the Surrealist movement. A man whose face resembled that of an Easter Island statue, Dominguez was a heavy drinker given to outrageous behavior—he would shout out “My penis is hard as gold” at the dinner table. According to a friend, the couple looked like the union of a transvestite Louis XVI and a Cro-Magnon man, and even at formal parties they pawed each other like teen-agers.\n\nDominguez was a decent painter, but his greatest gift was for forgery. He worshipped Picasso and would carefully copy Marie-Laure’s Picassos, replace them with his own versions, and then sell the originals to a dealer. On one occasion, Marie-Laure, pinched for cash, tried to sell a Picasso through James Lord. In his book, “Six Exceptional Women,” which contains a chapter on Marie-Laure, Lord writes that the dealer told him that he’d had that painting for almost a year already—Dominguez had sold it to someone who had in turn sold it to him. Marie-Laure had always been careful about her art collection, hiding her more valuable bibelots whenever she gave a party. “The richer people are, the more they filch,” Montebello remembers her telling him. But Dominguez remained beyond reproach. Marie-Laure was accustomed to being taken advantage of by men, and when Lord told her what Dominguez had done she replied, “It’s a sort of exorcism of the Picasso demon.”\n\nOne day, Dominguez’s own demons caught up with him. According to Ned Rorem, he prepared a white canvas, took a large dose of barbiturates, slit his wrists and his ankles, and for the few minutes remaining to him painted on the canvas with his own blood. After Dominguez died, Marie-Laure, then fifty-five, stopped drinking, and within six months she found a new lover. His name was Jean Lafont, and he bred corrida bulls in the Camargue. Twenty-five years her junior, he was bisexual, but Marie-Laure was never calmer than she was with Lafont. In her last two decades, she took up painting, and by the nineteen-sixties she had annual shows at Paris galleries, and even one in New York. She was furiously competitive about her work, painting a picture a week—accomplished, pleasant phantasmagoric landscapes—and putting a black mark on her studio wall whenever a work was sold.\n\nIn 1963, Marie-Laure de Noailles was awarded the Palme d’Or—a good-citizenship prize—by the newspaper Le Provençal. “She’s not a grande dame but a knight,” the playwright Marcel Achard said at the time. “She doesn’t have the vapidity, the pallor, or the evanescence of court ladies; she has the force de frappe, the violence, the enthusiasm and passion of the knight. . . . All the great artists of the epoch owe something to Marie-Laure.”\n\n“I owe everything to her,” Ned Rorem told me earlier this year. When I asked him about the Nazi lover, he said, “That may have been part of her aristocratic arrogance—very Sadian—to consider herself immune from most ethical or moral prerogatives.”\n\nMarie-Laure continued to lust after beautiful young men. Shortly before she died, as she watched a military parade of five hundred soldiers in Hyères, she said, “Here are five hundred happinesses passing by.” In her final years, she grew increasingly rude, not bothering to say hello or goodbye, shuffling into Galignani, the booksellers, and elbowing her way toward the book she wanted, snapping, “Put this on the Vicomte’s account.” Yet she remained an arbiter of Paris style. Her witticisms continued to make the rounds. In the late fifties, she spotted the actress Jeanne Moreau, who had been involved with the director Louis Malle, being escorted by Prince Napoleon Murat. “Elle va de mal en pire,” she acidly commented (“She goes from bad to worse”—a pun on Malle and empire). She still gravitated toward whatever was new: in the early sixties, she bought one of César’s compressed cars and placed it in her entrance hall, next to a Bernini. She continued to dote on handsome young men, such as the writer François-Marie Banier, whom she put up at Hyères with his boyfriend a few months before her death.\n\nIt was Banier who heard her last words. “No, I don’t want to die,” she told him on the phone, in a wheezing voice, on a January evening in 1970. She told her butler that she was “suffocating” but forbade him to alert friends. She died the following morning, of pulmonary edema, and was buried in the Bischoffsheim vault at Montparnasse Cemetery.\n\nThe Noailleses’ house on the Place des États-Unis is now owned by Baccarat, the crystal firm, which had Philippe Starck redesign the Jean-Michel Frank interiors as a museum for glassware. Charles de Noailles died in 1981, at the age of ninety, deaf, having planted his flower beds to the end. ♦"
