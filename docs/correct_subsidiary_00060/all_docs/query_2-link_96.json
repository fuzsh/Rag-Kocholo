        "text": ".\n\nBy Sugata Srinivasaraju\n\nVG Siddhartha’s suicide raises problematic questions and uncomfortable answers\n\nThe Netravati river that\n\nVG Siddhartha Hegde, billionaire businessman and founder of Café Coffee Day, jumped into on Monday, July 29, was tranquil on the surface. But beneath, the seasonal currents were terribly strong. The spot of his suicide was an estuary. The sea was only a kilometre away. According to locals, the bodies of those who fall there, during this time of the year, are usually never recovered. The currents quickly push the cadavers deep into the sea.\n\nDid Siddhartha, the diligent stock market player, who knew the value of every number after the decimal point, contemplate the site of his end? Or, was it an impetuous decision? Like the Netravati, on the surface, he appeared calm to people who had seen him that morning, but he was surely engulfed inside. Did he want to mysteriously disappear, be washed away into the sea, never to be found? Never to allow people to read failure on his visage, which had always meant success to the world? Was it against his wish then, that his body was washed ashore?\n\nWe will never ever know\n\nWhat we know from his friends and associates is that there had been palpable signs of stress ever since the income-tax raid had taken place on his establishment in\n\nSeptember 2017. “Two days after the raid, he asked me not to underestimate his mental strength,” a friend says. “But as days passed, he felt the ground beneath him was shrinking. More recently, the sale of Mindtree shares was nerve-wracking. He felt the tech company’s founders did not understand his financial precariousness.” He also apparently suspected that the income-tax DG, whom he refers to in his purported final communication, was being influenced by a tech company honcho who lived in the same residential complex. He was hurt that people he had helped and supported were defeating him.\n\nAmidst this, the Coca-Cola India deal to buy Café Coffee Day fell through, and he was very upset that the information was leaked to the press. The short-term loan he needed to rescue his organisation was not coming through. He wondered if one BJP MP was working overtime ‘to fix him’. At the same time, his father, whom he idolised, slipped into a coma. Things on the personal as well professional front were falling apart. Only the peace and quiet of his Chikmagalur estate could hold him together, or so he thought.\n\n“His wife and sons understood his fragility,” the friend adds. “They took care of him like a baby.”\n\nA team of divers searched the Netravati river for the remains of the coffee tycoon on July 31\n\nLike whipped cream frappe This portrayal makes Siddhartha a victim, as someone who was conspired against. That is anyway a dominant narrative that has taken root. His friends, relatives, colleagues, admirers, and the Congress in Karnataka, especially the likes of DK Shivakumar, have perpetuated this line. Some may be doing so to build a defence for their own past actions, and caveat possible future implications, but, most have used it to deftly characterise the Modi-Shah government as cold and cruel.\n\nEven Vijay Mallya used Siddhartha’s death to create a brotherhood and a victimhood. The two were related. Siddhartha’s sister-in-law Shambhavi is married to Mallya’s step brother Umesh Mohan Hingorani. Interestingly, Mallya and Siddhartha’s debt exposure is similar, if one goes by figures doing the rounds.\n\nIn this narrative and rhetoric, much like whipped cream frappe, there is perhaps a kernel of truth and exaggeration, but were Siddhartha’s methods, actions, ambition and avarice, in some ways responsible for rendering him vulnerable?\n\nWife of VG Siddhartha, Malavika, (centre) looks on as people pay homage\n\nDid he do what other businessmen usually do? Was he an innocent entrepreneur? Did he not work the system? Did his businesses not have a formidable political air cover? Should he be lauded for the jobs he created, the philanthropy and the unfailing humility he displayed? Apparently not, according to the income-tax department, obviously, but also according to well-regarded activists like SR Hiremath, who partnered with Prashant Bhushan in the Supreme Court to bring the mining mafia to its knees in Karnataka.\n\nOn the very day Siddhartha’s body was recovered, within hours, Hiremath held a press conference in Hubli. He offered his condolences, but in the same breath, also reminded people of Siddhartha’s ‘scandalous’ business practices and ‘illegal’ wealth generation. He especially referred to his two companies, Way2Wealth (a Coffee Day company) and Alpha Grepp (apparently operating from Singapore and Hong Kong), and demanded that they be thoroughly probed in what is known as the dark fibre, or the co-location scam. He also raised questions on his investments abroad. Not many dailies gave space to the presser the next day.\n\nBuilding an empire\n\nIn May 2019, SEBI had imposed a heavy penalty of `15.34 crore and other strictures on Way2Wealth. As reported by the Times of India, the Coffee Day company had “used a glitch in NSE’s trading system to get faster access to the trading engines, and NSE knowingly allowed them to exploit the glitch to make illegal gains.” It was in August 2015, through a letter from a Singapore-based whistle-blower that SEBI had learnt of the co-location scam and started investigation. Incidentally, Way2Wealth was earlier known as Sivan Securities, which had helped underwrite the Infosys IPO in the early 1990s when the technology company’s stocks were undersubscribed.\n\nKarnataka CM BS Yediyurappa at the funeral of the coffee baron\n\nThis was not the first time that Hiremath had spoken about Siddhartha and his business transactions. He had, in fact, written three detailed letters (copies are with Mirror) between August 2015 and March 2017 to the prime minister, finance minister and member secretary of the SIT on black money, listing 21 companies and organisations of Siddhartha and his friends and relatives, all of who were allegedly “involved in generating black money.” The letters delineated the modus operandi of the companies as well as specific cases that had created serious doubt. Hiremath told Mirror: “Later, I also met income-tax officials and they acknowledged that my letters had been forwarded to them, and they were looking into it.”\n\nIn Karnataka’s political lore, there is an unconfirmed whisper about a case from 1997-98 when Siddhartha got into trouble with a foreign company in connection with a real estate project. He was bailed out because SM Krishna, his father-in-law, was slated to take over as Karnataka Congress chief, and lead the party to polls in 1999.\n\nKrishna becoming chief minister created a shield around Siddhartha and put him on a spectacular growth trajectory that surpassed his triumphs until then.\n\nThe ascension to power of his father-in-law coincided with the real estate boom, the mining boom, and the IT boom in Karnataka. Siddhartha had the acumen and resources to exploit this opportunity to quickly build an empire. “His was a typical case of crony capitalism. He worked the system to his advantage, but the same system perhaps did him in too,” says one of his relatives.\n\nPeople who saw Siddhartha operate then, recall that he not only mixed politics and business with relish, but introduced marketing and branding into government and governance. To Krishna’s penchant for a white-collared image, he added a technocratic layer. Bangalore became more important than Karnataka, and that is when people like Nandan Nilekani were brought in to run the Bangalore Agenda Task Force. Narayana Murthy was appointed as chairman of the Bangalore International Airport Limited. It appeared as if Infosys was running the city. Also, K Jairaj, a senior IAS officer, and importantly, husband of Siddhartha’s colleague, Poornima Jairaj, came to run Krishna’s CMO as principal secretary.\n\nVG Siddhartha Hegde\n\nOne senior bureaucrat recalled that Siddhartha would be in the room when he went to discuss budget matters with the chief minister. “I would not begin my official discussions as long as he was in the room. He was very smart, he understood what I was doing.” Soon, the Krishna CMO ensured that they did not have to deal with the officer. They transferred him.\n\nAccording to a senior BJP leader, “Siddhartha reaped the benefit of a complimentary relationship that SM Krishna had established with HN Ananth Kumar, a minister in Vajpayee’s cabinet. As civil aviation and later urban development minister, Ananth Kumar supported Siddhartha’s enthusiasm for expanding the Café Coffee Day chain.”\n\nThe king-maker\n\nAround this time, Siddhartha’s experience with power, made him fall into the trap of imagining himself as a perennial king-maker. He quite liked the role. In 2011, when Karnataka BJP MLAs rebelled, and were holed up in Chennai, he apparently picked up the tab for their five-star boarding and lodging. There are many such things mentioned in conversations with politicians. “He was adept with political philanthropy,” the BJP leader exclaims.\n\nThis BJP leader was also present in S Bangarappa’s house, in New Delhi, when Siddhartha called on behalf of his father-in-law to urge the veteran politician not to join the BJP. This was in 2003, and the call came just before they left for Vajpayee’s Race Course Road residence for the formal induction. Ironically, in 2017, SM Krishna himself crossed over to the BJP. People thought that he was doing so to save his son-in-law’s business.\n\nAs days passed, he felt the ground beneath him shrink. More recently, the sale of Mindtree shares was nerve-wracking. He felt the tech company’s founders did not understand his financial precariousness\n\n—A friend\n\nTo attribute all of Siddhartha’s achievements to his father-in-law’s stint at the helm would be discounting his own genius at the stock market, which was on display in the 1980s and 1990s. He was in many ways self-made. His family had coffee plantations.\n\nHis father, Gangaiah Hegde and uncle Keshava Hegde, had branched out in the 1960s from the illustrious line of Thanudi Hegdes in Chikmagalur to make it big in the coffee world. Their over 450-year-old palatial ancestral home is now a priceless heritage property. Girish Karnad shot Utsav with Rekha in the lead, in this home.\n\nDuring the Emergency, one of Siddhartha’s Thanudi zamindar uncles was arrested under MISA for keeping bonded labour. Like with big zamindars, there was wealth that passed from generation to generation, there was social and political capital, but there was not much liquid cash.\n\n‘Everybody’s son’\n\nTo a plantation life that was staid and slow, Siddhartha introduced the speed, ambition, high growth, and also perhaps avarice of the Mumbai stock market. “I don’t want to stay under the big banyan tree of my ancestors,” he had declared to a cousin in his late teens. It was an incredible cultural transformation.\n\nA relative explains: “When he wanted to mobilise money for his business in the mid-1980s, he went to the traditionally rich Chikmagalur planters and told them that they were getting around 12 per cent for bank deposits, but he could give them over 20 per cent. He delivered and earned the trust of the community. A cousin recounts: “My mother always said he was everybody’s son in the extended family. He was there for their problems, be it financial, marriage or alcohol related. He was very human.” By 1991, he had become so wealthy that he bought back a single plot of 1,000 acres of Kudregundi coffee estate, which had slipped out of his family in the past. His arranged marriage to Malavika, Krishna’s elder daughter, only propelled him into a sea of greater opportunity.\n\nEvery August 23, his birthday, he would journey alone to Belur Math, Kalighat and spend time watching ripples spread and disappear on the Hooghly. His family were followers of Ramakrishna Paramahansa and Sharada Devi. He would have marked his 60th had he turned up there this year."
