        "text": "Author: pbizimis\n\nCaution! Contents very hot & very delicious\n\nGreece is a country that runs on excess caffeine consumption. Whether you are looking for a coffee shop to sit down and relax, or for something made on the spot, this coffee blog might just be for you. Coffee first arrived in Greece via Greek residents of Constantinople and it has its roots in the Ottoman period. The coffee habit had already spread throughout the country in the 18th century and since then it has become a significant source of our energy and social life!\n\nGreeks have always loved coffee. From Greek coffee, which became part of our tradition and culture, and frappé coffee, which is one of the most popular ice-cold drinks among modern Greeks, to freddo espresso and freddo cappuccino, which in recent years have gained their own zealous fans.\n\nGreece is one of the countries with the highest per capita coffee consumption in the world. Specifically, it has been calculated that approximately 5 billion cups of coffee are consumed yearly by Greeks, which corresponds to 510 cups of coffee per person.\n\nIn general, there are three degrees of sweetness you can order for your drink:\n\n“Sketos” for your no sugar challenge day!\n\n“Metrios” for one teaspoon sugar brown or white!\n\n“Glykos” for the fans of sweet drinks!\n\nFRAPPE: THE NATIONAL DRINK OF THE GREEK SUMMER\n\nA very Greek thing to do when you are in Greece is to try the iced frothy revolution of Frappé! It was accidentally invented by a Greek Nescafe representative named Dimitris Vakondios in 1957 in Thessaloniki and it’s been Greece’s ultimate summer drink ever since! All you need is instant coffee, water, sugar, and evaporated milk shaken in ice! Frappé can come in many variations, depending on the amount of added water and ice, sweetness levels, foam thickness.\n\nFREDDO: THE BATTLE OF ESPRESSO AND CAPPUCCINO\n\nGreek people always had a thing for cold coffees and the Italian signature espresso coffee couldn’t stay out of our list. One can describe it as an upgraded version of frappé! Instead of using instant coffee Greek baristas started experimenting with espresso in the early 90s. And just like that freddo espresso was born, blending high quality espresso with ice cubes, by mixing them in an electric mixer, in order to achieve a creamy texture. And if you can’t get your coffee without a dose of milk, go for the incredible and refreshing freddo cappuccino. Same preparation as with the freddo espresso, but with the difference of adding on top a rich cold milk foam. Don’t forget to add a generous sprinkle of cinnamon to spice up your coffee.\n\nGREEK COFFEE: RECOGNIZED BY ITS SMALL CUP\n\nGreek coffee is a ritual, it is a faithful companion in times of loneliness, an occasion to gather with friends, to welcome house guests; it is also connected with consolation, since it is the only coffee that is served at funerals and memorial services. Greek coffee is also one of the richest antioxidant drinks and it provides several benefits as long as it is consumed with moderation. What has remained unchanged is the way we drink it: Greek coffee needs time and relaxation, it is drunk slowly, it can be further enjoyed with company and conversation. In fact, “Greek” coffee is not so Greek, it is Turkish, and so it was known until the persecution of the Greeks of Constantinople in the early 1960s; out of reaction, Greeks started calling it “Greek coffee”. Nevertheless, there are some basic differences from the Turkish version. It has a specific blend and baking, which gives it a blonde tinge, and it is finely ground. It is served in small quantities, and is usually accompanied with sweet tidbits, such as Turkish delights or cookies.\n\nBest online art destinations in Greece\n\nGreece has a wealth of wonderful archaeological sites and museums with some of the world’s most spectacular collections of ancient Greek art. Yt it has some lesser-known, exceptional art galleries featuring both Greek and international artists. Fasten your seat belt, we are taking you on a journey to explore the top art destinations in Athens and Thessaloniki in the comfort of your own home.\n\nNATIONAL GALLERY\n\nThis iconic gallery located in the centre of Athens allows virtual visitors to view paintings, sculptures, engravings, and other forms of Greek art covering from the post-Byzantine period until today.

The Easter traditions have a relationship with the beginning of Spring, highlighting the uniqueness that has made the Corfu Easter a pole of attraction for Greek and foreign travellers. A week full of brilliance, glamour and excitement make Easter in Corfu a truly special experience.\n\nYou shouldn’t miss the opportunity to see the procession of Saint Spyridon. On Palm Sunday, it is held in memory of the plague epidemic that took place in 1629. During this celebration, all 18 philharmonic orchestras of the island take part. While on Holy Monday, the city lights in Liston, the Palace and the streets of the island are illuminated in purple, with the same mourning colour as the Cross in the Old Fortress.\n\nAt dawn on Holy Thursday, the Twelve Gospels are read in all the churches of the island, while in the Catholic Duomo there are twelve lighted candles, and every time one of the Gospels ends, it is extinguished by one. Also, the “Washbasin Ceremony” is revived which is the representation of the “washing of the feet of the Apostles by the Lord”. The Catholic Archbishop, as defined in the ritual, after the end of the 12 Gospels will wash the feet of twelve believers, usually children, thus representing the religious tradition, according to which Jesus washed he feet of his disciples.\n\nOn Good Friday, the Epitaphios processions, during which the embroidered image of the dead body of Christ is placed on richly decorated biers that are carried through the streets have a very different colour, following an impressive ritual as they come out in a certain order and intersect in the Old Town Centre. However, the last procession which starts from the Orthodox cathedral at ten at night and is accompanied by a philharmonic orchestra and Venetian lanterns, catches the eye.\n\nThe grandest and most dazzling celebration may be set up on Holy Saturday in Corfu. Starting at sunrise, an artificial “earthquake” occurs in the Church of Our Lady of Foreigners in a representation of the earthquake that occurred, according to the Bible, during the Resurrection. Afterwards, the Epitaphios of the Church of Agios Spyridon, the custom that began during the Venetian occupation, takes place, carrying the relics of Saint Spyridon around Corfu Town, in memory of the salvation of the island from famine. However, the Resurrection in Corfu takes place at eleven in the morning and all the locals and visitors are waiting on their balconies and windows to throw pots referred to as the “botides”, full of water, with the music background of the bells of the churches ringing joyfully.\n\nOn Easter Sunday in each Church, there is a procession of the Resurrection, and of course, the philharmonic orchestras have once again the honour of accompanying the Resurrection procession. After the end of the Sequences, the procession of the Orthodox and the Catholics begins, with a meeting point on the main square. Upon hearing the joyful message of the Resurrection, the city’s philharmonic orchestras will simultaneously play the “Graecoi” march in a spectacular atmosphere. Corfu will shine from the hundreds of sparklers that will fill the sky with colours and will be “poured” into the Ionian Sea, making Easter in Corfu unique and incomparable with the rest of Greece.\n\nThe First Cemetery of Athens: Discover the City’s 19th-Century Necropolis\n\nBursting with fascinating history and a vibrant cultural tapestry, Athens is a treasure trove of stories and monuments, an ideal destination for travelers who like to go off the beaten path and discover new sides to their favorite destination. Of its many eras, the 19th century, the days of the Kingdom of Greece, is one of the most often overlooked, and yet it’s also one of the most extraordinary.\n\nFrom the House of Parliament and the Presidential Mansion (formerly the Old Royal Palace and the Crown Prince’s Palace respectively) to the much celebrated Athenian Trilogy, Zappeion Hall and the Museum of the City of Athens, the city boasts numerous magnificent neoclassical buildings—a testament to the optimism, confidence and flamboyant grandeur at the dawn of the newly independent Greek state\n\nEstablished in 1837, the First Cemetery of Athens is a gem among gems, an otherworldly 19th century necropolis in the heart of the city that offers visitors a unique opportunity to discover the city’s relationship to art, life and death during the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nThe cemetery is the resting place for many of the city’s — and indeed the country’s — most prominent figures. Statesmen, including a number of prime ministers, artists, poets, industrialists, philanthropists, visionaries and famous philhellenes are buried here in marvelously ornate tombs and mausoleums—the most famous of which is, without a doubt, Yiannoulis Halepas’s magnificent “Sleeping Girl” sculpture.\n\nLined with cypresses and bitter orange trees—with some Greek pines and olive trees thrown in for good measure—the First Cemetery combines the cosmopolitan airs of 19th century Europe with a distinctively Greek spirit, evident in the Orthodox chapels, wandering priests, and winding gravel paths that seem to follow no order but their own. Off the beaten path (but just slightly), this hauntingly beautiful site is a wonderful opportunity to experience an entirely different side of Athens.\n\nHere’s some basic info to help you plan your visit.\n\nWhere: The entrance to the First Cemetery is located at 3 Logginou Street, just a few hundred meters from the Panathenaic Stadium and the Temple of Olympian Zeus, and just a 15’ stroll from Acropolis Metro Station.\n\nWhen: The site is open daily, 08:00-17:00 during the winter and 08:00-20:00 the rest of the year.\n\nCost: Admission to the cemetery is free\n\nTop tip: The terrain can be uneven and, depending on how much you want to explore, the walk through the grounds can be long, so wear comfortable shoes and remember to bring along a bottle of water.\n\nKeep in mind: While a listed a historic monument, this is still a working cemetery with funeral services and burials taking place on a regular basis. Appropriately respectful will be appreciated.\n\nLocal legend: According to urban legend, the cemetery is haunted by the ghost of a Nikolaos Batsaris, who worked there as a wreath bearer until his death at age 90. According to the legend, Batsaris accumulated a tidy sum by snatching jobs from his coworkers and to this day wanders the cemetery with a wreath around his neck.\n\nWant to find out more about neoclassical Athens and the Kingdom of Greece?

After all, is there a better way to start the new year than experiencing Greek nature?\n\nGo East!\n\nJust 6 km (under 4 miles) from Syntagma Square, you’ll find yourself entering Kesariani Forest on the slopes of Mount Ymittos. There’s plenty to see and do here: You can visit the famous 11th century Byzantine monastery, see the quaint Chapel of Ascension, walk along the many hiking trails that wind among the pines and cypresses, and reach the forest’s many lookout spots to take in the splendid views of the city.\n\nGo South!\n\nHead to the coast and discover the Athens Riviera, which stretches from Paleo Faliro all the way south to Cape Sounio and the famed Temple of Poseidon. With views out across the Saronic Gulf toward the island of Egina and the Peloponnese in the far distance, the Athens Riviera is known for its fabulous beachfront restaurants and cafés, gorgeous city beaches, and spectacular sunsets. Seafront properties give way to pristine coves the further south you go.\n\nGo West!\n\nDiomedes Botanical Garden, in the western suburb of Haidari, is one the city’s hidden gems and, at 460 acres, is the largest botanical garden in Greece — and the southeastern Mediterranean! About a fifth of the area serves as a typical botanical garden, hosting more than 2500 plant taxa, while the rest of the terrain is covered by spontaneous flora, including the oldest natural pine forest in Attica. With its stunning collection of hundreds of plant species, the garden is as fascinating as it is beautiful — a veritable oasis in the Greek capital.\n\nGo North!\n\nAt 1,413 m (4,3636 ft), Mount Parnitha is the highest mountain in Attica and is an ideal place for nature lovers and those who need an escape from the city. A large area of Mount Parnitha is designated a National Park; densely forested with firs and pines that form a lush green blanket over its slopes, it provides a habitat to a host of wildlife including red deer. The mountain boasts numerous hiking trails, as well as notable monasteries and ancient sites, and of course Tatoi Palace, the summer palace of the Greek Royal Family.\n\nWhichever direction you choose, Athens will surprise you with its stunning nature and landscapes. To make the most of your visit, make sure you’re well prepared (don’t forget to check weather forecasts, opening times and transport links!), stay safe, and have fun exploring the city’s great outdoors!\n\nDiscover Athens: The Wonders of the Golden Age\n\nSpectacular. Magnificent. Epic. The Golden Age of Athens was without a doubt the single most important and influential period of Greek history — a period that transformed and shaped not only Greece but the entire world to this very day.\n\nSo when was the Golden Age of Athens? Who led Athens during its Golden Age? And what exactly happened during this Golden Age that made it so remarkable?\n\nA time of wonders\n\nThe Golden Age of Athens roughly corresponds with the brief period of relative peace between the Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War during the 5th century BCE. But even though it lasted for less than a century, it laid the foundations of Western civilization. Athens, under the leadership of the visionary ancient statesman Pericles, flourished and produced some of the world’s most important and enduring ideas and cultural artifacts. No wonder this period is also known as the “Golden Century of Pericles” and the “Age of Pericles.”\n\nAs part of its lasting legacy to humankind, the Golden Age of Athens gave the world democracy and an extraordinary wealth of philosophy and art. This was the age of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, great thinkers whose ideas changed the cultural norms of their times and continue to inspire and provoke even today. This was also the age of great playwrights such as Aeschylus and Sophocles, who played a key role in the development of theater as a deeply complex art form that explores the ethical and emotional dimensions of its characters. And this was also an age of spectacular artistic achievement, producing such masterpieces as the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace, and of course the most iconic of ancient Greek monuments: the Parthenon.\n\nDiscover the magnificent Golden Age of Athens with our best-selling Classical Athens, Classically Greek tour\n\nMuch more than just an Acropolis tour, Classical Athens, Classically Greek is designed to showcase the marvels of the Golden Age of Athens while giving you the opportunity to immerse yourself and explore the wonders of the age and the boldness, optimism and vision that made these extraordinary achievements possible.\n\nCovering the top things to do in Athens, it includes guided tours of the Acropolis archaeological area and the Parthenon as well as a private guided tour of the award-winning Acropolis Museum. Led by expert tour guides, it introduces you to the history and secrets of the Parthenon, the city’s great theater tradition, and the treasures of Athenian democracy—and it also includes a taste of Greek hospitality and opportunity to sample Greek wine and delicacies.\n\nBusy mornings?

The capital was moved from Nafplio to Athens in 1834, signaling the beginning of a unique period of optimism and splendor.\n\nRenowned architects from across Europe came to Greece to oversee the construction of some of the world’s most elegant and magnificent neoclassical buildings.

And for centuries, Corfu has also been a favorite destination for royals and aristocrats, who built their summer palaces on the island’s lush hills to enjoy the Greek sun and the glorious Ionian Sea.\n\nUNESCO World Heritage\n\nWith its roots in the 8th century BCE, the Old Town of Corfu is a UNESCO recognized world heritage site, internationally renowned for its cultural significance and the numerous monuments that line its streets.

Greece’s largest island — and the fifth largest in the Mediterranean after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus and Corsica — is situated at the southernmost reaches of the Aegean Sea, with the Libyan Sea and Egypt to its south. It boasts some of the best beaches and top resorts in Greece and the entire Mediterranean, but it’s also home to the Minoan Civilization, one of the earliest and most influential civilizations on the planet.\n\nNamed for King Minos — who according to myth ordered Daedalus to build the infamous Labyrinth of Knossos to house the half-bull half-man Minotaur — the Minoan Civilization was an Aegean Bronze Age civilization that flourished throughout Crete and other Aegean islands from about 2600 to 1100 BCE. Today, following over a century of excavations, Crete is peppered with world-class Minoan to visit, and the majority of them just happen to be located a stone’s throw from one or more of the island’s gorgeous beaches.\n\nWant to combine sun, sea and fabulous history? Read on to discover our top five Minoan destinations to infuse your autumn break holiday with a touch of history and culture.\n\nKnossos and Heraklion\n\nYou can’t visit Crete without visiting the renowned Palace of Knossos, arguably one of the world’s most important ancient monuments. The largest, and most important Minoan site, on the island, the Palace was unearthed in the early 20th century, bringing to light a fabulous palace complex, with luxurious quarters, a majestic throne room and a number of extraordinary, elegant frescoes including the famed Bull Leapers, the Dolphins, the Prince of the Lilies, and the Ladies in Blue.\n\nMake sure to visit the Archaeological Museum of Heraklion too, and while you’re in the city, make time to stroll the beachfront, visit the Venetian Fortress and view the city’s impressive cathedrals. The long sandy beaches of Amoudara and Karteros are just a short drive away and offer a full range of amenities and plenty of seafood tavernas to choose from.\n\nPhaistos and Matala\n\nAbout an hour south of Heraklion, near the island’s south coast, is the Palace of Phaistos. This is the second most important Minoan site on the island. It is also where the famous and rather mysterious Disc of Phaistos was discovered: a 4,000-year-old clay disc covered in spirals of enigmatic writing that has perplexed archaeologists for decades.\n\nJust 15’ away, the town of Matala is another must-visit. The picturesque town has long been a favorite with visitors from around the world. Its famous caves, carved into the cliffs during the Neolithic Age were home to hippies from around the world during the 1960s and continue to attract visitors even today.\n\nMalia\n\nJust east of Heraklion, Malia is home to the island’s third most important Minoan site, the Minoan Palace of Malia. But this is a clear case of Come for the culture, stay for the nightlife. Malia is one of Crete’s best-known nightlife hotspots and is a particularly popular destination with holidaymakers looking for a destination where the fun continues well into the small hours of the night. In addition to the Palace of Malia, make sure to visit the nearby village of Krasi, famous for its ancient giant plane trees that adorn the village square.\n\nMochlos and Agios Nikolaos\n\nMochlos is a tiny islet located in Mirabello Bay near the town of Agios Nikolaos. Evidence suggests that before becoming an island, Mochlos was actually connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land — and this would have been the case during the Minoan period. A Minoan settlement was excavated on the island during the early 20th century, and the area still hosts regular excavation projects by Greek and international teams.\n\nMochlos can be reached by boat from the popular seaside town of Agios Nikolaos. While in the area, take the opportunity to see the gorgeous Lake Vouliagmeni, visit Istros beach for a swim, enjoy a stroll along Agios Nikolaos’ promenade and tuck into some tasty seafood at one of its beachfront tavernas. Craving a bit more local flavor? Visit the nearby Cretan Olive Oil Farm and Votania Herb Farm for a taste of local culinary traditions.\n\nZakros\n\nSituated on the island’s east coast, the archaeological site of Zakros is ideally combined with a day trip to the Crete’s easternmost reaches. Visit the ruins of the Minoan palace, head north to explore the magnificent palm forest of Vai — the beach is amazing too! — and continue your trip to visit the renowned 15th-century Toplou Monastery, which regularly attracts visitors from all corners of the Earth. Toplou is also home to some of Crete’s best vineyards, so make sure to make time for a winery tour and wine tasting.\n\nNot sure where to start or how to combine it all?

No matter how far and wide you venture, few places on the planet compare to the idyllic beauty of the Cyclades.\n\nWhich Islands?\n\nThe popular Cyclades island group, located right in the middle of the Aegean Sea, includes some of the most famous Greek islands including Santorini, Paros, Naxos, Mykonos, and Ios. But it is also home to other popular islands such as Amorgos, Milos and Delos — not to mention the (not so) hidden gems of Folegandros, Schoinousa and Koufonisia.\n\nWhich Beaches?\n\nThe Cyclades boasts some of the best beaches in Greece, the Mediterranean, and the entire world: Super Paradise beach on Mykonos is trendy, cosmopolitan and ideal for anyone who wants their beach visit to come with lots of sunbathing and beach bar parties; Mylopotas beach on Ios is its rock-n-roll counterpart.\n\nShift the focus to gorgeous landscapes, and the stunning rock formations at Sarakiniko beach on Milos, the multiple sandy cove-lets at Kolymbithres on Paros and the crimson cliffs of Santorini’s Red Beach are the perfect exotic getaway from city life.\n\nMeanwhile, movie buffs will appreciate a visit to Agia Anna on Amorgos which featured in Luc Besson’s acclaimed 1988 film The Big Blue.\n\nWhich Sights?\n\nThe Aegean was the center of the ancient Greek world, and many islands in the Cyclades flourished as trade, cultural and religious hubs, exporting their produce, raw materials, and arts across the known world.\n\nExplore the Aegean’s ancient heritage at Santorini’s renowned Akrotiri archaeological area, visit the kouroi and the Temple of Apollo on Naxos, walk across the Avenue of the Lions on Delos, and take a boat trip to the Sanctuary of Apollo on Despotiko. Jumping forward in time, don’t miss Panagia Ekatontapiliani and the Venetian Kastro on Paros and make sure to visit the iconic windmills and ‘Little Venice’ beachfront on Mykonos.\n\nWith literally hundreds of options to choose from in places to visit and things to see and do in the Cyclades, it’s impossible to recommend just one destination. The solution is simple: Treat yourself to an exclusive, tailor-made island-hopping holiday!\n\nFrom swimming at some of the world’s best beaches to visiting top attractions and world-class archaeological sites, Discover Greek Culture can design the perfect tailor-made holiday experience for you.

All you have to do is show up and have the time of your life.\n\nEat Like a Greek: Easter Favorites\n\nEaster in Greece is a time of celebration and feasting. It’s a perfect time to explore the countryside and get a taste of authentic Greek culture: the customs, traditions and foods that bind communities together and create that uniquely Greek sense of hospitality and belonging.\n\nWhether you’re in the countryside or in Athens, there are plenty of opportunities to sample Greek Easter food. And although we whole-heartedly recommend partaking in a rural village feast if you have the opportunity, city tavernas and back yards can be just as great. All across the country, the air is thick with celebration—and the smoke and aromas from traditional slow-roasting lamb on the spit go a long way toward setting the mood.\n\nLamb is the basis of much of Greek Easter cuisine: Whole on the spit, grilled offal, and even soup made from the head (and it’s better than it sounds, honest!) are all on the traditional Easter menu, accompanied by rich phyllo-pastry pies, crisp green salads, stuffed vine leaves, and a host of regional specialties. Of course, no Greek Easter menu is complete without the traditional red dyed eggs (and the obligatory egg tapping games) and a thick slice of fresh, buttered tsoureki sweetbread.\n\nIf you can’t make it to Greece this Easter, let Greece come to you. We’ve put together a short list of fantastic Easter menus and recipes. Have a look, choose your favorites and get cooking!\n\nGreek Easter Recipes and Menu, from The Spruce\n\nA Greek Easter, from Epicurious\n\nHow to Host an Olympic-Sized Easter: A Greek Feast from Chef Michael Psilakis, from delish\n\nGreek Easter Bread (Tsoureki), from Savor the Best\n\nCape Sounio: The Eclectic Experience\n\nPerched atop the craggy promontory of Cape Sounio and overlooking the sparkling Aegean Sea, the famed Temple of Poseidon has inspired the popular imagination for thousands of years. The temple—and the Cape itself—is the stuff of legend and poetry and has fascinated artists and scholars throughout the ages.\n\nCape Sounio features prominently in the myth about how the Aegean Sea got its name. The story goes that Theseus, son of King Aegeus, traveled to Crete to face the Minotaur in his labyrinth, setting off on a ship with black sails. He promised his father that if he succeeded and survived, he would hoist white sails for his return. With the help of Ariadne, and the ball of string she gifted him, Theseus beat the beast and escaped the labyrinth victorious. Yet in the tumult of his return, Theseus forgot his promise. Standing upon Cape Sounio, King Aegeus saw the black sails returning and, thinking his son dead, threw himself into the sea, to his death. And so the sea became known as the Aegean Sea.\n\nThe Temple of Poseidon was built in the 5th century BCE, during the ascendancy of the Athenian statesman Pericles, and stands on the site of an earlier, Archaic-period temple. Over the centuries, it has attracted some of the brightest minds of Europe’s literary and academic world, and its praises have been sung by the likes of Sir George Wheler, William Falconer, Lord Byron and Martin Heidegger.\n\nNow, Discover Greek Culture’s unique new Cape Sounio tour—available as a day trip from Athens—gives you the opportunity to step into the shoes of great thinkers who visited this glorious landmark and were inspired to write poetry, memoirs and treatises on the meaning of beauty and being.\n\nLed by expert tour guides, the Theseus Paradox Sounio tour combines fabulous sightseeing with an introduction to ancient Greek mythology and philosophy, exploring the interplay between the two and grounding them in the spectacular Mediterranean landscapes that gave birth to them.\n\nStaying close to the myth about Aegeus and Theseus, the tour uses the story of Theseus’s ship to introduce you to some intriguing ideas of Greek philosophy: According to Plutarch’s Life of Theseus, the ship Theseus returned in was preserved by Athenians as a memorial for centuries. “They took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place,” the philosopher wrote. But when all the original parts have been replaced by new ones, is this still the original ship?\n\nThe Theseus Paradox is a thought experiment in the metaphysics of identity that invites you to question concepts like change, memory and personal identity, and to participate in an exciting intellectual discussion about how we perceive ourselves and human nature. Your setting? The magnificent marble columns of the Temple of Poseidon, the glittering Aegean Sea, and the endless blue canopy of the Greek heavens.\n\nThis is a tour for lovers of Greek culture and philosophy, for inquisitive minds and cerebral adventurers who want to be treated to a truly extraordinary experience. More than a great tour to one of the best places to visit in Greece, the Theseus Paradox Sounio tour is an eclectic twist on one of Greece’s top landmarks.\n\nSix Thinking Hats at the Acropolis | Greek Culture Stories\n\nOne of the world’s most recognizable landmarks, the Acropolis of Athens stands magnificent over the Greek capital, an enduring symbol of Greek and Western culture, of human accomplishment and human potential. From the myths and ideas that emerged around the imposing rock to the Parthenon’s sublime geometry that tricks the eye, the Acropolis is a monument to the power of thought. And what better way to experience this than to let it challenge and inspire you?\n\nBased on Edward de Bono’s acclaimed Six Thinking Hats system, Discover Greek Culture has designed a unique tour of the Acropolis for those among us keen to combine aesthetic pleasure and intellectual stimulation. Arguably the best tour of its kind in Athens, Six Thinking Hats at the Acropolis is great for families or groups of friends looking to share a different experience historic Athens, and also makes for an exceptional corporate tour.\n\nPeeling away the semantic layers that envelop this world-class monument, participants are invited to engage with the Acropolis and the Parthenon on an intersectional, dialectical level. To kick off the experience, they’re encouraged to ask “What’s so great about the Acropolis?” The intellectual exercise that ensues is a fantastic team-building activity that brings together teams and co-workers, drawing on each individual’s distinct perspectives and the group’s own unique dynamics to promote cooperative thinking and creative problem solving.\n\nThe experience starts with a private tour of the Acropolis and then uses the Six Thinking Hats technique to get participants to look at, think of, and appreciate the importance of the Acropolis from different standpoints: data, creative thinking, process control, risk management, emotional intelligence, and optimistic utilitarianism. Equal parts challenging and entertaining, this exercise teaches participants to interact with each other in new ways, find their shared values and explore alternative perspectives and parallel thinking — all while promoting creativity and team bonding.\n\nWith its unique mix of philosophy and critical thinking, and set against the backdrop of the Acropolis and Parthenon, Six Thinking Hats at the Acropolis is a quintessentially Greek tour: a fantastic day out and a fabulous team-building activity in the heart of historical Athens.\n\nTime to put on your thinking hat and experience the Acropolis like you’ve never imagined.\n\nThe Acropolis: A Walk Through History\n\nAthens Half Marathon 2018\n\nA unique opportunity to run a race in view of the iconic Acropolis and Mount Lycabettus, the Athens Half Marathon is one of the most popular running events in Greece. This year, 2018, it will be held on Sunday 18 March. The main event, the Half-Marathon Race will start at 09:00 in the morning from Syntagma Square, and there will be three additional shorter runs or 5km, 3km and 1km—the latter open to children as young as ten years of age!\n\nExpected to draw more than 20,000 participants from Greece and around the world, the Athens Half Marathon aims to be not just a race but also a celebration of Greek culture and heritage. Everybody who has ever looked at ancient Greek art—be it statues, frescoes or pottery—knows that good health and physical fitness were held in very high regard in ancient Greece. In fact, ancient Greek thinking on the matter was millennia ahead of its time.\n\nThe motto was simple: A healthy mind needs a healthy body. Basically, ancient Greeks practiced wellness 2500 years before modern science confirmed that exercising and staying fit are key to happiness, mental health and cognitive performance. Indeed, athletic events and physical fitness were just as important in ancient Greek culture as education and practicing democracy!\n\nYoung and very much cultural, the Athens Half Marathon aims to promote running as part of a healthy lifestyle and to encourage participants to discover the wonderfully rich world of Greek culture: from the love of sport and the deliciously healthy Mediterranean cuisine to the history, art and monuments of a civilization that clearly knew how to make the most of life.\n\nWhether you’re in town to run the Half Marathon or to cheer on as a spectator, make sure to explore the city and discover its wonderful cultural heritage. Visit the 2500-year-old Panathenaic Stadium (aka Kallimarmaro), walk around the Acropolis to get to know one of the planet’s most iconic monuments, and tuck into some scrumptious Greek cuisine—including delicious vegan and clean-eating options.\n\nIf you’re only in town for a short stay, a private guided tour is essential. Expert tour guides are master storytellers that bring the ancient world to life, turning top cultural tours of Athens into unforgettable authentic experiences. So book a tour now to get started on your adventure.\n\nHere are some of our top suggestions:\n\nTwo birds…\n\nTo really get the most out of a day-trip to the capital, choose an afternoon tour in Athens .After spending the morning at the Half Marathon, you’ll visit the Acropolis, explore the capital’s ancient marvels in the afternoon sun, and taste a selection of Greek wines in the evening.\n\nMake a day of it\n\nIf you can plan in an extra day, take a private tour from Athens to the Aegean Sea, to visit the Sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron, the Vravrona Wetlands, and the famed Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounio—all complete with private transfers.\n\nFun for the whole familyTraveling with kids?

Because quite frankly, when it comes to experiencing Greek cuisine and culture, it doesn’t get more authentic than this.\n\nThe ancient Greeks knew what it’s all about. On occasion of the Athens Half Marathon, treat your body, mind and spirit with a day of sport, culture and exquisite Greek cuisine.\n\nGreek Carnival in Patras and the Peloponnese\n\nApokries, as the carnival season is known in Greece, is a big deal throughout the country and local traditions make for a range of striking and unique celebrations—from the street parties and burning effigies in Rethymno (Crete) to the Venetian-style carnival on Corfu and the traditional, rustic celebrations in Tyrnavos and Naxos that bear obvious similarities to the pagan carnival traditions of central Europe. The biggest, liveliest and most famous carnival in Greece, however, is without a doubt the carnival in Patras.\n\nGoing back over 180 years, Patras Carnival is the biggest festival in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe. It kicks off with the beginning of apokries (this year on January 28) and, over the next three weeks features a number of events, including balls, parades, street theatre, and of course the Children’s Parade (February 11, 2018). The festival culminates with its two major events on the last weekend of the carnival: the Night Parade on Saturday February 17, 2018 and its world-famous Grand Parade on Sunday February 18, 2018.\n\nWhile the modern, cosmopolitan character of the Patras Carnival might not give it away, the Greek carnival actually has its roots in ancient Greece and in the worship of the god Dionysus. For ancient Greeks, Dionysus was the god of the grape harvest, winemaking and wine, ritual madness, fertility, theater and religious ecstasy—a hefty title, and they made sure to celebrate him accordingly. Epic feasts, processions, singing, plays, masked dancing, and lots and lots and lots of wine.\n\nAnd we have the perfect way to give a nod to Dionysus and the origins of the apokries carnival season. Our Wine and History in the Peloponnese tour takes you on a journey that introduces you to the intertwined stories of viticulture and ancient Greek civilization: Enjoy a private guided visit to the Ancient Theater of Epidaurus and a guided winery tour of the award-winning Domaine Skouras Winery—complete with a wine tasting session showcasing four exquisite ambassador wines. Available as a day trip from Athens—or from Patras, upon request—Wine and History in the Peloponnese is the ideal tour to combine with a weekend at Patras Carnival.\n\nCulture, wine, and splendid celebration are just the right ingredients for an unforgettable apokries experience in Greece.\n\nThe main Carnival dates for 2018:\n\nJan 28: Triodion – The beginning of the carnival period\n\nFeb 8: Tsiknopempti (Smoky or Barbeque Thursday) – Traditionally a day on which Greeks head to tavernas—or fire up their grills—and tuck into some serious quantities of grilled meat prior to the arrival of Lent\n\nFeb 16-18: main Carnival weekend – The last three days of apokries during which carnival lovers don their costumes and take to the streets in numbers\n\nFeb 19: Kathara Deftera (Clean Monday) – The first day of the Great Lent, usually spent outdoors, flying kites and picnicking on delicious Lenten fare\n\nA Day in the Life of A Young Athenian\n\nThe Myths & Wonders of Ancient Athens\n\nSpectacular Sounion\n\nVisions of Ancient Delphi\n\nThe Untold Acropolis\n\nA pinch of Athens\n\nClassical Athens, Classically Greek\n\nA Taste of Greece\n\nModern Muses\n\nTouching History\n\nA Treasure Trove of Jewelry\n\nThe Heritage Dinner\n\nSki & Snowboard Holiday\n\nGreece is an undiscovered gem in Europe’s snow sport scene: a winter wonderland with almost 200 km of pistes and 24 resorts of various sizes up and down the country, Greece is a must-visit destination for skiers and snowboarders looking for new slopes and a unique take on snow sports.\n\nWhether you’re in north, central or southern Greece, there are plenty of opportunities to enjoy a day out on the slopes. There are dozens of ski resorts and centers throughout Greece, from the northern borders to the Peloponnese, and experienced skiers and snowboarders can also enjoy a wealth of opportunities for cross-country skiing and backcountry rides in pure untouched powder—even as far south as Crete!\n\nGreek ski resorts are mostly medium-sized, and a number of them are actually smaller ski centers, so don’t expect the massive networks of pistes you’d typically find in the Alps. Instead, prepare yourself for a real treat: a variety of runs across gorgeous terrain, often with spectacular views across the Greek countryside and—you guessed it—the Aegean Sea. Even the tiniest ski center has heaps of character and comes with plenty of options for sightseeing, cultural tourism, and great food in the vicinity. After all, where else in the world could you go straight from enjoying excellent snow to savoring a delicious souvlaki or tucking into some authentic Mediterranean home-cooking at a local family-run taverna?\n\nTransportation and Gear\n\nIf you’re based in Athens or Thessaloniki and don’t mind a bit of a drive, you can plan in some time on the slopes as a day trip. Two of the biggest resorts in Greece, Parnassos Ski Center on Mount Parnassus and Kalavrita Ski Center in the Peloponnese, are just under a three-hour drive from Athens, while Thessaloniki is surrounded by resorts, including Elatohori, 3-5 Pigadia, Vitsi, and Kaimaktsalan. Remember that mountain roads can be challenging even on a good day—much more so if you have to drive over snow or ice. Make sure your vehicle can handle the terrain and is equipped with appropriate tires, and have snow chains at hand just in case.\n\nIf you don’t feel like driving up the mountain yourself, you can take advantage of a number of “snow bus” services—shuttle services that transport snow sport enthusiasts from the city to resorts and back, leaving in the early hours of the morning and bringing you back in the evening.\n\nSnow bus services usually stop at gear rental shops, where you can rent anything from skis and boards to goggles, but it’s always a good idea to confirm this in advance with the company you’re using. If you’re thinking of trying a smaller ski center and/or are driving yourself, call in advance to confirm the possibility of renting gear from them or check with local snow sport shops in the city.\n\nThe Resorts\n\nCentral Greece:\n\nAgrafa – Karamanoli\n\nAgriolefkes – Pelion\n\nKoziakas – Pertouli\n\nMount Olympus – Vryssopoules\n\nMount Parnassos – Fterolakka/Kellaria\n\nMount Parnassos – Gerontovrachos\n\nTymfristos – Velouchi\n\nNorthern Greece:\n\n3-5 Pigadia – Naoussa\n\nHriso Elafi\n\nElatohori – Katerini\n\nFalakro\n\nLailias Ski Area – Serres\n\nOrfea Valley – Paggaio\n\nSeli\n\nVasilitsa\n\nVigla Pisoderi/Verno – Florina\n\nVitsi – Kastoria\n\nVoras – Kaimaktsalan\n\nEpirus:\n\nAnilio\n\nKarakoli\n\nProfitis Elias – Metsovo\n\nPeloponnese:\n\nHelmos – Kalavrita\n\nOstrakina – Mainalon\n\nZiria\n\nWhat to See and Do\n\nChasing the snow takes dedication, but if you’re only visiting Greece—or as specific area—for a short time, you’ll want to treat yourself to a complete, well-rounded experience. The best place to start is with one of the great guided tours that will introduce you to the Greece’s fascinating history and rich cultural heritage.

Sure, we have some of the best beaches in the world (in face you’ll find them all along the 13,676 km of coastline!), but the country’s interior is just as magnificent.\n\nIn addition to some impressive white-sand beaches and turquoise waters, the Peloponnese boasts a mountainous interior that offers visitors plenty of options for outdoors activities, from gentle hiking to rock climbing, mountain biking, kayaking and paragliding. The Greek mainland offers all these as well, as well as a number of excellent snowsport resorts, including Kaimaktsalan, Vasilitsa, and Pelion. In fact, there are approximately 24 working ski resorts of varying sizes in Greece (including two in the Peloponnese), with a total of 197.1 km of slopes. The most cosmopolitan of these is on Mount Parnassus, just under three hours from Athens and a stone’s throw from the world-class archaeological site of Delphi and the winter resort town of Arachova.\n\nFurther north, Mount Olympus is a four-season favorite, offering skiing and alpinism at its peaks and luxury beachfront resorts at its foot, with Litochoro being a popular destination with visitors from all over the world looking for a taste of ancient Greek myths and adventure. Even more adventurous types, will enjoy the wilderness of the Rhodope Mountains in Greece’s northernmost corner on the border with Bulgaria.\n\nNot quite the outdoorsy type? We’ve got you covered. Whether you’re looking to relax on the beach and pamper yourself on the magical Santorini or the popular Chalkidiki Peninsula or you want to take a walk in an enchanting mountain landscape without straying too far from the comforts of city life, there are plenty of destinations to choose from. In the north, cities like Serres, Kastoria and Ioannina combine rich culture with exquisite nature and are ideal winter getaways, while cities like Nafplio in the Peloponnese or Agios Nikolaos in Crete make for perfect romantic retreats all year round.\n\nOf course, wherever you go in Greece, you can expect plenty of opportunities to discover the country’s rich cultural heritage through world-class archaeological sites, monument and museums—and of course, the folklore, arts, and excellent Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nInvest some time to researching Greece’s top destinations and determine the region and season that’s right for you. Actually, make that a list. Once you’ve had a taste of Greece, you’re guaranteed to come back for more.\n\nPractical Info: Get the Basics Right\n\nWhen you know when and where you want to go in Greece, it’s time to start preparing. Your dream itinerary might already be on your mind, but don’t forget the essentials. Here’s some practical info to get you started.\n\nVisas: Greece is party to the Schengen Agreement, and visas are generally not required for stays of up to 90 days. Those with passports from non-Schengen countries may require a visa, so make sure to check well ahead of time as some embassies and consulates have lengthy procedures.\n\nWeather: The overall climate is temperate Mediterranean, but the country’s unique geography means there’s a remarkable range of microclimates. In other words, temperature and weather phenomena really vary in different areas of the country, depending on altitude and proximity to the sea. To be sure, check the weather forecasts for your specific destinations.\n\nLow and High Seasons: Low season is generally November to March, and this is a good time to get cheaper flights and ferries and good deals on accommodation. However keep in mind, that December to February is the busy season for winter and ski resorts, so book your accommodation (and lift passes!) well in advance to avoid disappointment. For the rest of the country, high season is Easter and then May to August, so expect most flights, ferries, accommodation and tours to be fully booked. To avoid disappointment (and sky-high prices) book in advance.\n\nMoney and costs: Greece uses the Euro, and prices can be very competitive compared to other European destinations. On the tighter end of the budget, you can stay at a hostel for under €20 and enjoy a couple of souvlakia on the go for €5. At the mid-range, hotel accommodation will set you back anywhere between €60- €150 a night and you can expect to have a hearty meal at a local taverna for €20- €25. At the top end, expect to pay upwards of €160 a night for accommodation and €60 for dining. Activities and tours can vary greatly in price, but beware of deals that sound too good to be true: The extra cost of booking a tour with licensed guides and well-developed itineraries is definitely worth it.\n\nGetting Around: Athens has a well-developed public transport network with buses, trolleys, trains, metro and tram routes that will get you to pretty much anywhere you need to go in the city. Major cities across Greece also have good public transport links, primarily buses and trolleys. Taxis are relatively affordable in Greece, and, in the countryside, can also be hired for longer trips and even sightseeing! Car and moped rentals are also reasonably priced, and you can find rental offices throughout the country, including most islands. For longer distances, options include flying (with local airports throughout the islands), an extensive rail network, and ferries, particularly during the summer months.\n\nFor more inspiration on top places to visit and top things to do in Greece, check out our list of top Greek destinations or explore our selection of some of the best tours in Athens and other popular destinations like Delphi, Santorini, and the Peloponnese.
