        "text": "Queens Of The Stone Age frontman Josh Homme played a rare solo acoustic set last night at James Lavelle's (aka UNKLE's) Meltdown festival in London. As Antiquiet reports, the setlist consisted primarily of Queens cuts, with Homme bringing out Mark Lanegan at one point to perform his song \"One Hundred Days\" (a track that the band's covered in the past). He also performed a new song, called \"Villains of Circumstance\". If you weren't there to witness it in the flesh, no worries – someone in the audience captured footage of the moody, seven-minute song in full. Give it a watch/listen below.\n\nWatch Queens of the Stone Age's video for \"Smooth Sailing\":"
