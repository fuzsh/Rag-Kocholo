        "text": "When discussing Josh Homme, it's unlikely you'll get too far into a conversation without words like 'prolific', 'busy' and 'multitasker' being tossed around – and with good reason.\n\nEver since founding stoner-rock pioneers Kyuss in the late 80s, Homme has picked up musical projects with a fervour that would impress even the most ambitious of magpies. Splitting his time between his \"main band\" Queens Of The Stone Age and collaborations with the likes of punk rock godfather Iggy Pop and British trip-hop outfit Unkle, he's also found time for supergroups with members of the Foo Fighters and Led Zeppelin, as well as any number of other projects with Trent Reznor, Primal Scream and The Arctic Monkeys. As the old saying goes, why have one band when you could have 10?\n\nWith such a predilection for new sounds and sonic landscapes, it's little wonder Homme has gathered a fanbase who pit him as one of modern music's essential architects. Among them are Lancashire stoner crew Sky Valley Mistress. The influence is clear from their name, but also from their sound, which is peppered with the sorts of doomy psychedelia Homme's first band made their own. If that wasn't enough, they also enlisted the help of Eagles Of Death Metal guitarist and producer Dave Catching to co-produce their new debut album, Faithless Rituals.\n\nHere, the band talk us through the best songs from Dave Homme's career.\n\nQueens Of The Stone Age - No One Knows (Songs For The Deaf, 2001)\n\nKyuss - Gardenia (Welcome To Sky Valley, 1995)\n\nUNKLE - Restless (War Stories, 2007)\n\nIggy Pop - Paraguay (Post Pop Depression, 2016)\n\nQueens Of The Stone Age - The Fun Machine Took A Shit And Died (Single, 2007)\n\nThe Desert Sessions - Johnny The Boy (Volumes 1 & 2, 1998)\n\nQueens Of The Stone Age - Make It Wit Chu (Era Vulgaris, 2007)\n\nThem Crooked Vultures - Elephants (Them Crooked Vultures, 2009)\n\nQueens Of The Stone Age - The Vampyre Of Time and Memory (...Like Clockwork, 2013)\n\nEagles Of Death Metal - Wannabe In L.A (Heart On, 2008)"
