        "text": "It’s never fun to be in a dental chair. To keep my mind off the unpleasantness (just waiting for my dentist to ask, “is it safe?”) I started paying attention to what song was playing on the muzak. “Could It Be I’m Falling In Love?” is now forever ruined for me. To clear my head I put together this hour of recent psychedelia.\n\nRecently I’ve had a couple of very different experiences both involving titanium implants. My daughter turned 18 and to celebrate that she decided to get her belly button pierced. and She chose a titanium ring. I gave her a ride to the tattoo parlor and the music they were playing was sort of classic rock with some metal leanings. Motorhead’s “Ace of Spades” was playing as she got the piercing done, and I felt a protective parental impluse. I managed to save her the embarrassment by holding my tingue but I want to say, “Hey, be careful. That’s my daughter!”\n\nThen, a couple days later I went to my periodontist (!) and got a titanium dental implant. I was in the chair for a long time and the music playing was your typical dental office muzak. As my periodontist was really applying the pressure I could hear a smooth jazz version of “Could It Be I’m Falling In Love?” playing, and my thought was that I’d rather be listening to Motorhead right about then. I mean, c’mon let’s get this done!\n\nBut after thinking about it I think elevator music is probably best option for me in an situation like that. After seeing A Clockwork Orange I definitely would not want to be listening to music I felt passionately about and have all those negative associations of being in a dental chair.\n\nSo as I said, to clear my head I put together this hour of recent psychedelia.\n\nThe drops in this episode come from the movie Marathon Man. It had been many years since I’d seen Marathon Man but given my recent dental experiences I kept thinking about Lawrence Olivier’s character: a dentist, a Nazi war criminal who had escaped to Uruguay after World War II. He comes out of hiding to retrieve the diamonds he had stolen during the war but he’s wary about going into the diamond district in Manhattan and being recognized. He thinks Dustin Hoffman’s character knows something and tortures him with dentistry. As I said, given my recent experience I think you can understand why this movie was on my mind.\n\nBut to take the film seriously for a moment, Marathon Man was even better than I had remembered and it actually has a great deal of relevance for our current political moment. It’s all about the struggle against fascism and the dangers of unchecked authoritarian rule. The image of marathon runners in this movie reflects how the progressive struggle against the forces of fascism is ongoing and requires vigilance. It’s a marathon, and we’re still on that path."
