        "text": "When it comes to the creative content I generate here for this website, one of the most important aspects of the process to me is that the finished product be of a relatable tone. I’m not looking to be the next Pitchfork journalist or to impress you with meanderingly high-minded turns of phrase straight out of the handbook of a newly-minted English Lit major. Instead, I seek to have my reviews and overall output strike a conversational note. The type of stuff you’d typically hear behind the metal security fence at a concert amongst eager fans both before AND after the show.\n\nThat’s the perspective I strive to bring to the table every time I sit down at the computer to start constructing a new piece for OTBEOTB. A simple music fan’s point of view getting straight to the heart of why the art of music itself always keeps me coming back for another plateful. Then sharing that feast with all of you.\n\nBut that’s only half of the story here. I’m also honored to have certain special occasions such as today’s installment where I get to take you the reader (as well as myself) beyond that metal security fence at the gig. Where instead of trotting out my own internal fan chatter, I get to turn the keys over to some of the musicians themselves. Let them tell you their own stories that hold sway beneath the bright lights.\n\nAnd that’s just what we’re going to do in the words that follow. For this one the wonderful folks in the hard psych-rock band Acid Walls were kind enough to put together a show diary for me to share with all of you. It goes into detail about a recent release show they had for their EP “Glass Pieces”, and brings you behind the curtain as one of the band taking part in this special evening.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Acid Walls\n\nAcid Walls “Glass Pieces” EP Release Party Show Diary\n\nPhoto courtesy of Acid Walls\n\nMeet The Band\n\nHey, we’re Acid Walls, a four-piece psych-rock outfit from the Hartford, CT, area. From left to right is Dom Russo (rhythm guitar/vocals), Elliott Moreau (lead guitar/vocals), Bailey Packard (bass guitar), and Eli Pidgeon (drums).\n\nWe’re here to share a quick show diary about our EP release party, hosted by Bleacher’s Bar in Bristol, CT, on 2/16/2024. That night will always stay in our memories as an incredibly fun and meaningful night! We invited three incredible bands to start off the night before it was our turn to play.\n\nThe bands we invited along for the night were Qween Kong, Skavs, and Soft Spot. This was the first time we had met both Qween Kong and Skavs, both of which absolutely rocked unbelievably hard! Soft Spot, on the other hand, were good friends of ours that we had met a while back. We knew that we wanted Soft Spot on the bill because they’re fun people to hang with and their music always rocks the room. Overall, the night was a blast and it was an absolutely great way to release an EP into the world.\n\nPhoto Credit: Jessie Fuentes for Melodía Magazine\n\nLoad-In\n\nIt had been about six-plus months since we had played a show at Bleacher’s. We played our first show there with Sober Bill and Soft Spot. We were so blown away by the sound system and Bleachers’ in-house sound engineer, we knew that we needed to hold our EP release party there. Elliott and Eli were the first to arrive before any of the other bands. They had to immediately get to work unloading and setting up the drum kit because, as the headlining band, we had opted to provide drum backline for the night. After getting all of our gear set up on the stage we proceeded to begin soundcheck for the kit. As the drummer from Qween Kong was messing around on the kit for the soundcheck, Eli and Elliott both looked at each other with delight (as the drum connoisseurs they are) as the kit came roaring out of the PA system. They were both definitely satisfied with how they had tuned the kit for the night to come.\n\nPhoto Credit: Jessie Fuentes for Melodía Magazine\n\nNew Friends\n\nFor us, there was certainly a bit of nervousness in the air. We had invited two new bands that we had never played with before. We were also expecting journalist Jessie Fuentes of Melodía Magazine to come out. Shout out to Jessie; she was the one who took a lot of the incredible photos seen in this diary! (You can check out the full gallery here). We all truly just wanted to make sure we put on a good show and reciprocated the positive energy that everyone involved had brought along with them. At the end of the show we all mutually agreed that the night was a success. There was a total sense of community between the bands, and we felt it was safe to say we made some new friends.\n\nPhoto Credit: Jessie Fuentes for Melodía Magazine\n\nPhoto Credit: Jessie Fuentes for Melodía Magazine\n\nOur Time To Shine\n\nThe time was approximately 11:15 pm and Soft Spot had just finished their incredible set. The nervous energy radiating between us four was palpable; we were ready to play!. We had made our way up to the stage and had finalized all of our gear and made tweaks as necessary. The next 40 or so minutes were certainly filled with the energy we were hoping to cultivate for the night. We all felt that our playing was tight, we were being expressive, and that we were putting on an entertaining show.\n\nPhotos above courtesy of Jessie Fuentes for Melodia Magazine\n\nPhotos above courtesy of Jessie Fuentes for Melodia Magazine\n\nPhotos above courtesy of Jessie Fuentes for Melodia Magazine\n\nPhotos above courtesy of Jessie Fuentes for Melodia Magazine\n\nPhoto courtesy of Brimstone Media\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOverall, the night was an absolute success in our eyes. We made new friends, played our hearts out to the audience, and released a new EP into the world. We will always look back on this night with fond feelings. We’re so grateful for everyone who attended and the bands who played as well. We’re excited for what the future holds and for the music we’ll make as time goes on, but this night will always stay with us as an important reminder of what love, friendship, community, and music truly mean.\n\nThanks so much to Acid Walls for putting together this show diary, listen to them over at linktr.ee/AcidWalls!\n\nImage courtesy of The Inside Out/Chantel Malin\n\nI frequently find myself wrestling with the fleeting nature of that ever-mighty concept known as time. As someone who was born in 1990, I remember living in the days when there was a sense of my own youth and vitality that seemed as though it would be everlasting. Fast forward to three months into this sci-fi novel-ready sounding year that is currently March 2024, and that feeling of young innocence has since been replaced with what I can only describe as the early-onset permanence of adulthood. Has it always been here, has it always been this way? That phenomenon, well… it continues to remain a mystery.\n\nHowever, what I do know is that this line of thinking has led me into my latest set of musical musings here on OTBEOTB. Last time around the dial I featured the futuristic-tinging twists of the wonderful band Animals in Denial with their single “Inside of Me”. For this one, we’ll jump into the recent new music video for the group The Inside Out and explore another adjacent side of alt-rock courtesy of their song entitled “Mr. Arrogant”.\n\nImage courtesy of The Inside Out/Abe Azab\n\nNow what immediately caught my attention about “Mr. Arrogant” is the sort of 90’s-inflected, Mighty Mighty Bosstones-like energy of the track built around swirls of guitar, drum and bass holding down the push of the groove. The hooks of “Mr. Arrogant” are ear-wormingly instantaneous, and I quickly found myself hitting the replay button over and over again just to enjoy the “ride of the vibe” so to speak. I also found myself wanting to relive the moment because of the illustrative humor of the music video.\n\nWhat’s so important about a good music video is how it colors in the lines of a song and adds to its overall context. In the case of “Mr. Arrogant”, we return to that theme of the passage of time and the importance of living in the moment as members of The Inside Out separately rush to get to a gig on schedule by any means necessary. A lighthearted sentiment here to be sure, but one that still reminds us of how time always flies forward no matter what we do to put the brakes on.\n\nForgetting that would just be, well… downright arrogant.\n\nCheck out the “Mr. Arrogant” video below, and follow along with all things related to The Inside Out over on https://www.linktr.ee/theinsideout!\n\nImage Courtesy of Animals in Denial\n\nHello friends and fellow listeners and welcome back aboard to the musical bloggings of yours truly here on OTBEOTB. It’s been a long hiatus filled with many a copious twist and turn, but I’ve returned once again to fill your cup to the brim with some of the newest musical offerings to come across my metaphorical table of melody.\n\nToday is a particularly fun subject as we focus in on the band Animals In Denial and the recent release of a single entitled “Inside of Me” off of the upcoming EP “Crash Course Volumes: Volume 2 – Tickets to Dreamland”. Animals is the brainchild of artist Christian Imes, a self-taught multi-instrumentalist and producer who mixes together the organic nature of the guitar, synthesizer, drum and bass with the forward-leaning bent of artificial intelligence. That blending feels particularly apt with the song “Inside of Me”, an industrial-rock buoyed track that simultaneously conjures to mind the dark-mooded chemtrail windings of a Trent Reznor with the 80’s-inflected futurism of bands like Kraftwerk, Devo, and Men Without Hats.\n\nImage Courtesy of Animals in Denial\n\nThe video for “Inside of Me” enhances the strength of this ambition, heightening the sense of the industrial robotic style of instrumentation with the body and blood of the humanity in the lyrics. It feels as though the words and imagery are asking, do you still see the person within me even through the waves of dissonance and technology that have come to define us in the year 2024? Imes, who has Autism Spectrum Disorder, really drives to the heart of that need for communication and that struggle for the desire to be heard in the way that we intend. Whether that’s in our interpersonal relationships or through the sharing of our art.\n\nAll in all, Animals in Denial have a strong lead song here with “Inside of Me”. The hooks stay present and easily segue into repeat listens to get to the heart of the meat and marrow of the material. We may be in the depths of a technology era of drift and escapism these days, but “Inside of Me” reminds us as listeners that our humanity still exists, and it’s up to us to stay connected to that essence.\n\nCheck out the “Inside of Me” video below, and follow along with all things Animals in Denial over at animalsindenial.com!\n\nJulie Byrne’s new LP The Greater Wings is a prime example of what superbly crafted and complete albums are made of in 2023. Not iTunes singles, not a one off in a movie people may or may not see or an EP barely meant to hold the attention of a listener. An album. Lived in and loved for all its creation, for the better and the warts of it all.\n\nYou have to stop, listen and think on each track or you won’t truly get “Wings” in the way it was meant to be received. The beauty in between the lines connects and stitches together a story that’s incomplete without having all the chapters. Byrne has experienced a personal tragedy with the death of her musical partner, and its a heavy grief of stages. Gorgeous beyond belief and so optimistic in moving forward and in moving on, but that weight remains behind the words in the emotions that still linger on. In both the love and the grief.\n\nI think that’s a credit to the continued development of Byrne’s strong vocals that only continue to take on new life as she hones her craft and pours more of herself into her art. Buoyed on the back of strings, the harp, guitar, piano and a host of instruments, there’s a force of emotional beauty in what Byrne has created on these spread “Wings”. As I said before, stop, listen and pay attention or you wont truly grasp how important this experience is.\n\nAnd that’s no exaggeration or being an indie snob. Time and again songs like “Flare”, “Lightning Comes Up From The Ground”, “Moonless”, “Summer Glass” and closer “Death is the Diamond” hit you in all those innermost feelings, turning in like like the sharpest of screws once they sink in. All it takes is the turn of a line, a certain phrase or note on the piano or guitar and just… wow. Straight to the heart of a devastation. The instinct of an Elliott Smith with a larger production style.\n\nBut as I mentioned, there’s also a lot of hope on The Greater Wings. It is Byrne’s best, and may I edit myself and say I hope it’s only her best SO FAR? Because she’s going in a direction we need a lot more of in music, and I will gladly support every second of her efforts to do so.\n\nI could attempt to be more analytical, but this one is all about the sensation of emotions. Go take the ride and capture how The Greater Wings feels.\n\nIt’s hard to believe Mac Miller’s sophomore album Watching Movies With the Sound Off just turned 10 years old. I haven’t been a fan of Mac’s for that long, but he’s such a young yet promising talent at that moment in time making that album, and now that’s a decade gone and a decade old while Miller has passed on. As the cliche statement says, where does the time go?\n\nI’m put in mind of this due to the fact Miller’s estate has released a 10th anniversary edition of Movies, the time period where I feel Mac truly began to assert himself as an artist. He’d just come off the mixed reactions to his debut LP Blue Slide Park, which showed glimpses of Miller’s vulnerability as something stronger than just a frat rapper. I’ll admit I couldn’t see it back in those days, but since Mac’s passing looking back at his discography has provided the ultimate perspective.\n\nAnd Movies to me feels like the moment the switch flips for Miller; his raps go deeper and show more of his darkness. Whether its lamenting a friend’s death on “REMember”, the trippy lovelorn romance of closer “Youforia”, or the existential questioning of “I’m Not Real”, you can sense Miller getting more serious in real time. His “dark” alter ego Delusional Thomas also debuts here most prominently on “The Star Room”, a song that’s a rapping tour de force of evolution, setting the mission statement that something different was coming from this album.\n\nThere are still some lighter sections with tracks like “Bird Call” and “Gees” that recall Blue Slide Park, but Miller’s humor is overshadowed by the fact he wasn’t just going to cruise in the carpool lane like fellow white rapper Jack Harlow’s music.\n\nNo, this kid from Pittsburgh was ready to show he was going places.\n\nAs for the 10th anniversary edition’s tracklist, there isn’t much here that’s different from the deluxe edition of Movies that’s been out in the world already for a bit. The OG version of “The Star Room” with fellow rapper Earl Sweatshirt is worth a download as it dials the track down a bit into a late night confessional, and bonus tracks “Goosebumpz”, “O.K.”, and “Claymation” are strong. Though, as is typical with bonus tracks, they don’t quite fit the theme of the album.\n\nOtherwise, the biggest item of note with the 10th anniversary edition of Watching Movies with the Sound Off is its upcoming vinyl release. I’ll link to a Twitter post below about it, definitely worth checking out as it continues the bird theme found throughout the album."
