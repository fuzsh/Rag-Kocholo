Music&quot; and of course his own solo work).\r\n\r\nIt consists in 14 tracks, 2 bonus tracks and 3 edits, all of them following the same concept, which is similar to earlier works like Bootwards 1-2-3 and also the bonus tracks from my Kanye of the Stone Age opus.\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nEd Zitron, St√©phane Lassaigne, PomDeter, Lobsterdust, DJ Schmolli, DJ MiF, DJ NoNo, Felix Five, MsMiep, CrumplOrchestra and every single person who keeps bootlegs / mashups alive and not dull.",
