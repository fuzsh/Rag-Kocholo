        "text": "Trade Wind have released their new single I Can’t Believe You’re Gone, taken from their forthcoming album Certain Freedoms.\n\nThe band is made up of vocalist/guitarist Jesse Barnett (Stick To Your Guns), guitarist Tom Williams (Stray From The Path), Randy LeBoeuf (acclaimed producer/engineer at Graphic Nature Audio), and drummer Andrew McEnaney.\n\n“The idea behind the video was to show the perspective of what it can be like to date a musician or specifically someone like me whose music and work overlap and are very time consuming—especially with so much required travel,” Barnett explains. “It’s about the challenges of making a relationship work and being mindful of your partner even when you’re balancing a lot of things at once. We decided to have the video play out in reverse because I often find myself thinking, ‘I wish I could go back the the beginning and do it differently.'”\n\nCertain Freedoms is due for release on 26th April via End Hits Records (UK/EU) and Other People’s Records (US/ROW).\n\nSee Trade Wind live at one of the following dates, with support from Modern Colour and Scott Ruth.\n\nMay\n\nMon 6th – MANCHESTER – Night People\n\nTue 7th – LONDON – New Cross Inn"
